WEBVTT

00:01.086 --> 00:02.907
All right, good, so we're gonna get going.

00:04.107 --> 00:05.367
All right, we're good.

00:06.628 --> 00:11.009
Yeah, everybody on that side was not sitting, so I was like, wait a minute, half the board is missing.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.471
All from charters.

00:17.231 --> 00:20.372
All right, good morning.

00:21.993 --> 00:23.273
We're going to get started.

00:33.905 --> 00:34.985
We're reconvening.

00:35.005 --> 00:43.069
All right.

00:45.510 --> 00:49.551
Reconvening the January 8th, 9th, 2020 meeting of the State Board.

00:50.511 --> 00:51.592
Good morning, everyone.

00:52.918 --> 00:53.459
Come on.

00:57.826 --> 00:59.589
With bright, shiny faces.

00:59.749 --> 01:02.914
And this is the way we start our new day.

01:02.934 --> 01:04.116
Yeah, there we go.

01:04.176 --> 01:04.596
Thank you.

01:06.187 --> 01:08.109
I don't know, but we're from a cohort.

01:08.149 --> 01:09.890
We're from the same cohort.

01:11.091 --> 01:15.294
We could sing it for you, but I'm not quite ready to sing this morning.

01:16.795 --> 01:19.638
Item 11 is our first item of the day.

01:19.658 --> 01:31.067
It is the special education item, state annual performance report for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, covering program year 2018-19.

01:31.727 --> 01:34.369
And the item will be presented by Kristen Wright of the CDE.

01:35.310 --> 01:36.650
Kristen, please begin.

01:37.150 --> 01:37.711
Good morning.

01:37.791 --> 01:38.291
Good morning.

01:38.831 --> 01:41.511
Happy New Year, board members, President Darling-Hammond.

01:42.091 --> 01:46.352
I'm Kristen Wright, Director of the Special Education Division here at the Department of Education.

01:47.172 --> 01:57.955
I will be joined up shortly by Shiloh Bessariel, who is our California State Data Administrator for Special Education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and she is

01:59.295 --> 02:07.626
responsible for ensuring that we collect our data from special education and that we report it properly and accurately.

02:07.646 --> 02:15.256
I'm going to bookend today's presentation, but before I hand it off to Shiloh, I wanted to share a couple quick updates with you.

02:16.858 --> 02:26.386
Again, we are excited and overwhelmed with the focus that we have on special education right now and our students with disabilities and we look forward to seeing the needle really start to move around that.

02:26.647 --> 02:34.153
We feel like it's a really collective effort that's happening in the state with the assistance of obviously the dashboard and the accountability system but also

02:35.134 --> 02:50.080
the wonderful colleagues across the state system of support, including you all, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence and Carla Estrada, and our county offices, and all of our partners that we work with in the Special Education Division.

02:50.440 --> 02:52.441
It is really an all-hands-on-deck effort.

02:53.061 --> 03:00.884
I also want to give a shout-out to Shiloh and her data team, and the CALPADS team, because they have been working

03:01.544 --> 03:04.045
tirelessly to merge the data systems.

03:04.105 --> 03:14.429
And I think you all know what a feat that has been to take our very antiquated special ed data system and evolve it into CALPADS and all the idiosyncrasies that go with that.

03:15.030 --> 03:17.190
So that is still happening.

03:18.351 --> 03:19.932
It's real.

03:20.252 --> 03:23.333
And the casemist data system is officially retired.

03:24.878 --> 03:25.098
Yes.

03:29.244 --> 03:39.277
And I know the task force for special education would have been happy to know that we are now having more one coherent system of data in California and we look forward to more of that.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.741
And finally I just want to let you know that

03:42.902 --> 03:51.068
We have promoted within the division, Dr. Tina Transor, who has taken on the role to oversee our six focus monitoring units.

03:51.568 --> 03:54.950
And so you will see her around and hear of her.

03:55.430 --> 04:01.855
She brings a wealth of knowledge and experience as a teacher, principal, and leadership coach from Oakland Unified, as well as some other districts.

04:02.155 --> 04:06.578
And she's been in the division for the last few years and recently promoted to that position.

04:06.618 --> 04:08.219
So she oversees all those units.

04:08.239 --> 04:11.281
And we'll be doing a lot of updates to our monitoring system over the next year.

04:11.341 --> 04:12.382
So she'll be leading that work.

04:13.263 --> 04:18.047
So I'm going to now hand over the mic to Shiloh, who will provide you with the data.

04:18.228 --> 04:24.974
It's the what that we'd like your approval to send on to the US Department of Education Office of Special Education Programs.

04:26.376 --> 04:28.258
And then I'll come up at the end if you have any questions.

04:28.298 --> 04:29.739
Shiloh and I will tag team that.

04:30.180 --> 04:30.400
Thank you.

04:35.523 --> 04:36.564
Good morning board members.

04:36.584 --> 04:37.865
Good morning.

04:37.905 --> 04:38.666
It's so good to see you.

04:38.926 --> 04:44.450
I see there's some new faces so I am just going to introduce myself and tell you a little bit about what I do.

04:44.470 --> 04:45.791
My name is Shiloh Duncan-Bessariel.

04:45.871 --> 04:56.560
I'm the Data Administrator for Special Education here at CDE and my primary responsibility is all the data collection and reporting, state and federal reporting for students with disabilities in California.

04:56.980 --> 05:02.582
So, that includes data that was in the now-retired KCMIS system and will be in the CALPADS system.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.683
So, I oversee all the collection, all the analysis, and all the reporting.

05:06.004 --> 05:08.124
I'm lucky I have a really great team, so it's not just me.

05:08.144 --> 05:08.545
Don't worry.

05:09.445 --> 05:12.166
So, today I'm going to bring to you our annual performance report.

05:12.186 --> 05:16.368
I'm going to talk a little bit about what that is, but I'll start with an overview for

05:17.248 --> 05:23.894
you all about where we are, the state of the state for students with disabilities, how many students we have, what their compositions are.

05:23.914 --> 05:26.676
I'm happy to answer questions as we move forward.

05:26.696 --> 05:39.287
And then I'm going to walk through the annual performance report, not every indicator, because as much as I love this data thing, I know it's not everybody's thing, and at 8.30 in the morning it might be hard to walk through 16 indicators.

05:41.028 --> 05:47.872
So I'm gonna select some indicators to go through, but I can answer questions about any of the indicators in the executive summary.

05:48.432 --> 05:56.756
This is going to be the first of sort of a three-part sets of presentations that we will do before you over the next several meetings.

05:58.397 --> 06:04.960
So there'll be this annual performance report, which is how we did as a state for students with disabilities during the 18-19 school year.

06:06.961 --> 06:12.965
We will also be presenting some extension targets for the 19-20 year, and I'll talk about that in a moment.

06:13.605 --> 06:20.149
And then in your March meeting, we'll be presenting our state systemic improvement plan, which is known as Indicator 17.

06:20.349 --> 06:22.770
It's sort of an indicator that the U.S.

06:22.790 --> 06:31.015
Department of Education requires us to submit that talks about all of our improvement activities and how we're improving outcomes for students with disabilities.

06:31.875 --> 06:37.378
And then we are now at the end of a six year state performance plan cycle.

06:37.519 --> 06:47.284
So we will be coming to you all in the next several months to talk about how we're going to set targets for the next set of six years and what that looks like.

06:47.364 --> 06:59.392
So we will be walking through a number of performance indicators and looking at what our stakeholders have suggested for targets and allowing you all to discuss that pride input and you will need to

07:00.112 --> 07:02.854
provide approval on those targets.

07:03.175 --> 07:06.978
So that will happen over the next several meetings.

07:07.658 --> 07:11.441
There is a little bit of a hitch in that, and I'll talk about that in a little bit.

07:12.562 --> 07:16.985
So we are required to submit the report that I'm going to present to you today to the U.S.

07:17.025 --> 07:21.729
Department of Education in order to receive our $1.3 billion in federal funds.

07:22.730 --> 07:25.192
And if we do not submit it, they can withhold those funds.

07:25.612 --> 07:30.038
So that is something to keep in mind, and the report is due February 1st.

07:31.119 --> 07:34.844
We do have the ability to do some amendments later on if it's necessary.

07:35.845 --> 07:40.110
We are also going to review some of the new requirements that the U.S.

07:40.131 --> 07:43.254
Department of Education has implemented this year.

07:45.150 --> 07:47.951
I always like to start with this education code.

07:47.971 --> 07:50.352
It's something that Kristen likes to also start with.

07:50.712 --> 07:54.014
This is not from the special education section of the education code.

07:54.074 --> 08:06.939
It is from 33080, and it says each child is a unique person with unique needs, and the purpose of the education system of this state is to enable each child to develop his or her own potential.

08:07.439 --> 08:10.961
And so I feel like that really sets the stage for what we're gonna be talking about today.

08:12.398 --> 08:22.681
So one of my main jobs that I do is to talk about how many students with disabilities there are in California and what their outcomes are.

08:22.761 --> 08:24.201
So I always like to start with that.

08:24.301 --> 08:31.543
So in 2018-19 there were, on any given day in California, about 800,000 students with disabilities.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.644
Our census count is 795,000.

08:37.425 --> 08:39.545
And those are students who are ages zero through 22.

08:39.826 --> 08:46.968
Keep in mind, we do serve children who are zero through five by local education agencies.

08:47.348 --> 08:51.610
We also serve about 85,000 preschoolers ages three through five.

08:51.690 --> 08:55.011
And I will be talking about preschoolers a little bit later and what that composition looks like.

08:55.631 --> 08:58.732
We have about 720,000 K-12 students and that represents 11.6% of California's K-12 population.

09:04.634 --> 09:08.877
So sometimes you'll hear different percentages out in the world, like 12%, 13%.

09:10.277 --> 09:28.708
Keep in mind that in order to have sort of an exact percentage where you have the number of students in the numerator, the same as the number in the denominator, we don't have a comparative group for that zero to five population, so we tend to look at, we're talking about percent of students with disabilities, we look at that K-12 population, and this is that percentage.

09:31.501 --> 09:33.783
I used to do a really great chart called the Pac-Man charts.

09:33.823 --> 09:41.952
It was little circle charts that compared the composition of students with disabilities in the different LCFF student groups.

09:42.352 --> 09:44.555
This is a table that represents that chart.

09:46.056 --> 09:50.119
So about 11.6% is this number of students with disabilities throughout the entire population.

09:50.559 --> 10:00.866
But as you'll see in this table, in each of the student groups, the LCFF student groups, you will notice that the percentage of students with disabilities is greater than that 11%.

10:01.727 --> 10:08.792
So for students who are on free and reduced price meal eligibility, it's 13% of those students are students with disabilities.

10:09.432 --> 10:13.435
Students who are foster youth, 28% of foster youth are children with disabilities.

10:14.015 --> 10:17.981
And for our English language learners, 17% are children with disabilities.

10:18.001 --> 10:24.290
So there's a greater representation of students with disabilities within each of the LCFF student groups.

10:26.894 --> 10:27.154
Sure.

10:28.556 --> 10:29.438
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:31.630 --> 10:35.971
That's okay, so we have 11.6% of students with disabilities throughout the state.

10:36.411 --> 10:40.912
But for students who are free and reduced price meal eligible, it's 13%.

10:42.453 --> 10:44.133
And for students who are foster youth, it's 28%.

10:44.353 --> 10:49.195
Our students with disabilities and for our English language learners, it is 17%.

10:49.295 --> 10:57.417
So a larger population within each of the groups than we would see in the general, the total student population.

10:59.689 --> 11:06.891
And then 70% of our students with disabilities are in one or more of the LCFF student groups.

11:07.071 --> 11:08.472
So there's great overlap.

11:08.532 --> 11:18.375
So when we started talking about LCFF student groups and we started looking at data from the dashboard, a lot of folks would say, well, this doesn't include students with disabilities, but it does.

11:18.555 --> 11:20.156
It overwhelmingly includes them.

11:20.216 --> 11:27.498
And so this idea of having all students represented and looking at all your student groups that you don't have one child that sits in one box,

11:28.098 --> 11:29.419
and isn't touching anything else.

11:30.239 --> 11:33.741
This was really illuminating to that, to folks especially at the LEA level.

11:35.662 --> 11:42.825
So one of the things you'll notice is that we have increased the number of students with disabilities in the state year after year since 2005-6.

11:43.045 --> 11:53.431
And if you look at our total K-12 student population on this chart, you will notice that we've actually decreased the number of students in public schools in California.

11:55.633 --> 11:58.697
But while the number of students with disabilities has increased.

11:58.937 --> 12:03.663
So we increased between 10 and 20,000 students with disabilities every year.

12:04.504 --> 12:09.171
While the number of students in California has either remained flat or decreased.

12:13.004 --> 12:16.406
Folks often ask what is our most common disability categories.

12:16.887 --> 12:23.211
And so our most common disability categories are specific learning disabilities, which is about 37% of our students with disabilities.

12:24.592 --> 12:27.053
20% of our students with disabilities have a speech or language impairment.

12:27.593 --> 12:31.276
And 15% have autism.

12:31.536 --> 12:34.218
We also have 13% who have other health impairment.

12:34.298 --> 12:37.900
And other health impairment includes students who have ADHD.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.542
So you'll find that in there as well.

12:42.409 --> 12:48.151
And there's been quite a bit of change in what the categories have been over a period of time.

12:48.211 --> 12:54.852
So since 2005, we've seen a 10% increase in the number of students who are identified with autism.

12:55.673 --> 13:00.934
We have also seen a 7% increase in the number of students who are identified with an other health impairment.

13:01.494 --> 13:05.235
While we've seen a decrease in the number of students who have a speech and language impairment.

13:05.295 --> 13:11.057
So while that's gone down, and also specific learning disability has gone down, we've seen an increase in the other categories.

13:14.204 --> 13:21.730
And then by race or ethnicity, you'll see the percent of students with disabilities is greater in some of the categories.

13:21.810 --> 13:29.075
For example, students who are Hispanic or Latino, there's a 3%, it's 3% higher than what we would see in the general population.

13:30.036 --> 13:36.381
And there's also 3% lower for our Asian population and for African American population.

13:36.721 --> 13:40.964
It's about 2 to 3% higher than what we would see in our general population.

13:41.544 --> 13:43.205
So we do see some disproportionality.

13:43.245 --> 13:47.948
I'm going to talk about what we do around disproportionality a little bit later so we can talk a little bit more about that.

13:48.008 --> 13:50.770
It is an indicator represented in the annual performance report.

13:52.796 --> 13:56.921
So there are about 86,000 preschool students with disabilities in California.

13:56.941 --> 13:58.723
And these are children ages three through five.

13:58.783 --> 14:02.687
So the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act does not go by grade.

14:03.128 --> 14:03.989
It goes by age.

14:04.449 --> 14:09.035
And so all children ages three to five are considered preschool students for the purposes of IDEA.

14:10.456 --> 14:18.763
What that means is we do have some students who are in transitional kindergarten and kindergarten who are represented in our preschool numbers because they're age five on census date.

14:19.664 --> 14:22.686
And I'll talk a little bit more about some of the changes that we might see from the U.S.

14:22.706 --> 14:26.109
Department of Education around this issue.

14:26.489 --> 14:33.935
Overwhelmingly, the majority of our preschool students have a speech or language impairment, about 60%, followed by students with autism at 26%.

14:36.237 --> 14:38.659
And that's been pretty steady over the last several years.

14:40.461 --> 14:47.767
And then we don't have a comparison group for students with, or for our students with children with disabilities ages three through five to a general population.

14:47.947 --> 14:51.369
We do not have universal preschool, so it's hard to know what those numbers are.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.771
So I'm only presenting the students with disabilities here.

14:54.111 --> 14:59.295
But you'll see it's very similar to what we would see in the K-12 population.

14:59.335 --> 15:05.400
About 57% of our Hispanic and Latino students, or students with disabilities are Hispanic or Latino, 21% white.

15:07.041 --> 15:13.346
We do see 4.9%, which is a little bit different than what we see in the K-12 population.

15:13.366 --> 15:18.710
Okay, so I overwhelmed you with a lot of introductory data.

15:18.750 --> 15:23.333
Does anybody have any questions before we move on to the meat of our presentation today?

15:25.414 --> 15:29.998
That was just the introductory data, just to make you feel good about data, right?

15:32.093 --> 15:38.238
So for example, for African American students, children with disabilities ages 3 to 5, that percentage is 4.9%.

15:38.278 --> 15:42.801
But when you look at the percentage of students with disabilities K-12, you'll see that it's around 7%.

15:56.272 --> 15:57.233
So that is a difference.

15:57.773 --> 16:02.277
For Asian students, it's about 11% of Asian students have a disability.

16:03.038 --> 16:04.979
K-12, where it's about 9% here.

16:05.179 --> 16:06.460
So there's some variation.

16:06.480 --> 16:10.984
And is the hypothesis that it's under identification in the early?

16:12.705 --> 16:13.846
I don't know.

16:13.866 --> 16:17.990
I don't have that data right offhand, something we could look into a little bit more.

16:19.251 --> 16:20.972
But it's not something that I have right now.

16:20.992 --> 16:23.074
It's just a difference that we are noting.

16:27.777 --> 16:30.458
Okay, I'm going to move on, but I'll be happy to come back.

16:31.259 --> 16:33.100
So today I'm presenting the annual performance report.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.761
And so you'll hear a couple of terms that we talk about throughout this report.

16:37.142 --> 16:39.863
One is called the APR, which stands for annual performance report.

16:39.903 --> 16:43.265
We'll also be talking about something called the SPP, which is the state performance plan.

16:44.005 --> 16:44.466
So the U.S.

16:44.486 --> 16:52.036
Department of Education requires states to set targets on a number of indicators that it identifies and then annually report on those targets.

16:52.157 --> 17:00.709
So the setting of those targets is a state performance plan and the reporting on those targets and our outcomes is the APR.

17:02.710 --> 17:10.895
We are submitting the APR and typically during this time we would also be having you all look at targets and submitting targets as well.

17:11.315 --> 17:12.016
However, the U.S.

17:12.036 --> 17:23.462
Department of Education notified us in October that they were not ready to publish the new six-year cycle of the annual performance report and that they would be requiring states to set extension targets.

17:24.503 --> 17:35.857
So when we did this last time in 2013, what we do typically is we look at our current levels of data and set new baselines for the six-year cycle, and then we set targets based on that baseline.

17:36.458 --> 17:38.561
However, this year we can't do that.

17:38.601 --> 17:41.825
We're not setting new baselines, so we're simply setting extension targets.

17:42.185 --> 17:50.627
So you will notice inside of your executive summary target there is a set of one-year extension targets that are simply an extension of what the target is.

17:50.647 --> 17:57.889
So for example, if the target has been 1% per year increase or decrease, we followed that in the extension targets.

17:58.269 --> 18:05.691
And so part of the approval of this item is also to approve those extension targets because we have to submit them to the U.S.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.072
Department of Education on February 1st.

18:08.412 --> 18:19.894
We do, we will need over the course of this year, once the US Department of Education publishes its six year state performance plan indicators, we'll have to set new targets for those indicators.

18:20.394 --> 18:24.775
They have indicated that they will make changes to the state performance plan indicators.

18:25.976 --> 18:27.676
I don't know what those changes are gonna be yet.

18:28.276 --> 18:32.817
We have some indication that they are looking to make

18:34.277 --> 18:44.242
include students who are in kindergarten, in the school age, like least restrictive environment, and those kinds of indicators, as opposed to putting them in preschool, because it didn't always exactly fit.

18:45.182 --> 18:51.925
And so there's some indication around those things, but we won't know exactly what they are until we have the packet.

18:52.065 --> 18:53.405
We hope that the packet will come out.

18:53.845 --> 19:01.989
They told us spring, and so spring goes all the way through June, so my hope is it's not that long that we will see a packet in April.

19:02.589 --> 19:11.452
And we can kind of work with our stakeholder group and bring you back some draft targets to provide feedback to us.

19:12.492 --> 19:16.093
We will not need to submit targets until February next year.

19:16.413 --> 19:23.055
So we do have a lot of time to work with our stakeholder groups, to work with you all, to receive feedback, and to identify the right amount of targets.

19:23.135 --> 19:29.777
And this has become important because there were some concerns in our federal court case around our targets, and we want to make sure we get it right.

19:32.064 --> 19:38.468
So the State Board, I'm sorry, the State Board must approve this item and the Annual Performance Report consists of 17 indicators.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.010
Some of them are compliance and some of them are performance.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.792
The compliance targets, we cannot set a different target.

19:44.852 --> 19:45.713
It's either zero or 100%.

19:45.753 --> 19:54.278
And then the performance indicators, they must be set with a collaboration of stakeholders approved by the State Board of Education.

19:55.398 --> 19:58.820
They were re-binged in 2013 and they will now go through 19-20.

20:01.266 --> 20:11.196
So the data for the annual performance report for the annual performance report you're seeing before you is collected with data from the CalPAD system and the KSMA system.

20:11.216 --> 20:13.178
18-19, we still use the KSMA system.

20:13.658 --> 20:15.820
When we present to you next year in 19-20, it will be

20:20.385 --> 20:21.346
only the CALPADS system.

20:21.466 --> 20:25.749
So we're very excited to see that K-SMIS was now retired as of this year.

20:25.769 --> 20:27.031
It's very exciting.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.972
It's a five long year process.

20:29.933 --> 20:34.377
And we included almost 400 new validations around data.

20:35.660 --> 20:38.901
for students with disabilities, we may see data that's different next year.

20:39.221 --> 20:42.422
And that doesn't mean our data this year is wrong, or that data is incorrect.

20:42.782 --> 20:52.205
What people are doing now, which I think is very exciting, is that they're having a lot of conversations about where students are enrolled, because enrollment is being compared, race and ethnicity is being compared.

20:52.465 --> 21:00.928
So a lot of LEA conversations are happening around, do we have the right data, is this correct, we wanna make sure it's consistent, or is everybody trained in the right way.

21:01.448 --> 21:05.269
And so I think we're gonna see a little bit of a change in the data, but I think it's gonna be better.

21:05.709 --> 21:07.250
So I'm actually very excited about it.

21:07.370 --> 21:18.718
And the fact that we're going to have longitudinal data around students with disabilities means I can go back and see for a student how long they've been in it and have an IEP, how long they've been in district, what districts they were in.

21:18.979 --> 21:20.320
I think that's really exciting.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.761
And associating it with enrollment is very exciting.

21:22.861 --> 21:26.344
We also received data from the Office of Administrative Hearings for this report as well.

21:28.811 --> 21:31.873
This data will reflect 18-19 school year data.

21:33.434 --> 21:41.780
There are three indicators that are lag year, which means they are actually 17-18 data, and those are graduation, dropout, and suspension expulsion.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.512
Okay, so now we can actually get to the indicators.

21:45.892 --> 21:55.140
So I'm going to provide you all in the item and also on the presentation this table, just like this, that identifies all the indicators.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.764
And these indicators, I believe, are on page 13 and 14 of your item.

22:01.825 --> 22:08.147
And it's a very, it's like a one or two page document that goes through all the indicators and whether or not we met the target and what the changes were.

22:08.587 --> 22:10.307
I will not be going through each indicator.

22:10.527 --> 22:11.748
I'm gonna select some indicators.

22:11.808 --> 22:17.149
However, if any of you all have questions about any of the indicators, I was joking with one of my colleagues.

22:17.949 --> 22:25.091
I started this job when my son was a baby and now he's 10 and this has been my, like one of my pieces of work that whole time.

22:25.131 --> 22:28.772
So him and my, this and him are like the same age in my life.

22:29.833 --> 22:30.174
10 years.

22:31.175 --> 22:32.698
So this is one thing I do know.

22:33.680 --> 22:38.528
So we're going to talk a little bit about, I want to talk about disproportionality.

22:41.644 --> 22:48.070
The – in the annual performance report, we have things called suspension and assessment and graduation.

22:48.451 --> 22:52.815
And they're not the same as what's in the dashboard, which I know can feel very confusing.

22:53.235 --> 22:54.336
We – the U.S.

22:54.356 --> 23:00.482
Department of Education publishes the indicators and also publishes the only ways we can calculate the indicators.

23:00.522 --> 23:04.866
So we actually don't have a choice about how we calculate and present this data to the U.S.

23:04.886 --> 23:05.667
Department of Education.

23:06.147 --> 23:09.849
So it will be different than what's presented in the dashboard.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.989
It's a different calculation, different sets of data.

23:12.310 --> 23:24.715
However, we have, and we can talk about this in your next meeting in March around the state systemic improvement plan, we have aligned all of our monitoring and how we hold districts accountable the same manner.

23:25.255 --> 23:31.798
So while we report something different to the US Department of Education, when we work with LEAs, we make sure we're using a consistent methodology.

23:33.558 --> 23:36.459
There are several indicators associated with disproportionality.

23:36.559 --> 23:52.365
One of them is indicator 4B, which identifies disproportionality based on race or ethnicity, with suspension, expulsion, and then we determine if students, if we review files and if there are non-compliances associated with disproportionality.

23:52.525 --> 23:55.145
So we identify a district, we review files,

23:56.886 --> 23:59.568
And then we determine whether or not there's noncompliance.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.110
And that's what this indicator is.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.872
That's why it's a compliance indicator, not a performance indicator.

24:04.393 --> 24:09.998
And so in 2017, we were at 6.3% of districts who were disproportionate had noncompliance.

24:10.118 --> 24:15.562
And this year, we identified 4.8% of districts had noncompliance.

24:15.582 --> 24:16.543
So that's a change of about 1.4%.

24:17.864 --> 24:20.086
Keep in mind, it's a 0% indicator.

24:20.186 --> 24:21.828
So we did not meet the target.

24:23.836 --> 24:28.960
Indicator 9 and the subsequent indicator 10 are disproportionate representation by identification.

24:29.300 --> 24:34.784
So it looks at the race or ethnicity of students with disabilities and determines if the district is disproportionate.

24:34.904 --> 24:41.468
If it is disproportionate, then the district is required to go through a review process reviewing files to determine if there's noncompliance.

24:41.988 --> 24:48.052
Last year we had 0.8% of students of districts identified noncompliance.

24:48.093 --> 24:50.814
This year 1.6% identified noncompliance.

24:50.854 --> 24:52.535
So an increase of a little bit less than 1%.

24:54.698 --> 25:03.387
And then indicator 10, we identified districts who were disproportionate, and this is based on a specific disability category.

25:03.728 --> 25:13.859
So we looked at all the disability categories by race or ethnicity, identified if a district was disproportionate, and then they went through a compliance review.

25:14.660 --> 25:19.105
Last year we had 27.76% identified noncompliance.

25:19.466 --> 25:22.690
This year we had 9% identified noncompliance.

25:23.310 --> 25:24.972
So a change of about 17%.

25:26.474 --> 25:27.916
But again, we're not meeting the target.

25:28.096 --> 25:29.017
The target is zero.

25:30.318 --> 25:35.380
So let's talk a little bit about what disproportionality is and how that leads to something called significant disproportionality.

25:35.400 --> 25:39.641
Because if you work near or around LEAs, this is probably an important hot topic.

25:40.201 --> 25:46.243
So the requirement to identify disproportionality has always existed in IDEA.

25:47.903 --> 25:57.213
And so in 2016, though, prior to 2016, districts could identify any method they wanted to identify disproportionality.

25:57.693 --> 25:59.795
And that led to a lot of variability among states.

25:59.875 --> 26:10.106
For example, in California, we always identified districts as being disproportionate and significantly disproportionate, but states like Missouri never identified a district as being disproportionate.

26:10.866 --> 26:12.869
in part because of the methodology that they used.

26:13.029 --> 26:13.710
And so the U.S.

26:13.730 --> 26:26.707
Department of Education changed the regulations in 2016 and required districts, all states, to use a common methodology for identifying districts for being disproportionate, and that is the risk ratio calculation.

26:29.469 --> 26:36.433
It also required the state to set a minimum end size, a minimum cell size, and to set a determination for reasonable progress, and we also walked through that.

26:37.133 --> 26:53.802
So we define disproportionality, significant disproportionality, sort of as it's put into the law, which is must ensure that LEAs identify students with disabilities and provide the resources and supports they need to have equal access to education regardless of race or ethnicity.

26:55.720 --> 27:01.082
And so the way that disproportionality works is we go through that calculation methodology with the alternate risk ratio.

27:01.142 --> 27:14.266
And the alternate risk ratio is like looking at how you as a district with a specific race or ethnicity category are identifying students compared to how all the other students in the district are being identified.

27:15.066 --> 27:27.433
And our risk ratio threshold is three, which means you have to be over-identifying three times what we would expect based on your composition in order to be selected, which is a pretty standard methodology nationwide.

27:28.193 --> 27:34.556
And so the disproportionality calculation is a one-year calculation, and each district is required to complete a compliance review.

27:35.257 --> 27:41.420
And then if a district is disproportionate over three years, they become significantly disproportionate.

27:42.100 --> 27:52.728
And so as a state, we decided to use disproportionality as an early warning system to districts so that they could make changes prior to becoming significantly disproportionate.

27:53.068 --> 28:06.837
Because if a district is significantly disproportionate, then they must set aside 15% of their federal funds for students with disabilities and use it to develop a coordinated early intervening services plan.

28:08.138 --> 28:10.340
So it becomes sort of a fiscal implication.

28:11.361 --> 28:15.984
So the first year they're identified for disproportionality, they should do a root cause, identify what the issues are.

28:16.445 --> 28:20.868
Second year, if they're identified, they should be changing practices, implementing evidence-based practices.

28:21.388 --> 28:25.712
And then if they are still identified in the third year, they will have that fiscal consequence of that set aside.

28:28.419 --> 28:35.906
So we applied the new methodology stepwise instead of going back and recalculating previous years of data.

28:36.226 --> 28:39.669
We started in 16-17 identifying LEAs.

28:40.330 --> 28:44.914
And then we, so we added the new methodology each year.

28:44.934 --> 28:46.355
So it was a hybrid methodology.

28:46.415 --> 28:49.859
This is the first year we'll actually be using three years of the new methodology.

28:50.499 --> 28:56.440
So in 16-17, we identified 945 LEAs.

28:56.480 --> 29:02.102
In 17-18, we identified 677 LEAs for disproportionality, the one-year calculation.

29:02.482 --> 29:05.423
And this year, we identified 322 LEAs.

29:08.923 --> 29:15.265
Some of that was due to some clarification from the US Department of Education around the utilization of the risk ratio.

29:15.345 --> 29:17.385
So I don't want to get too statistic-y.

29:17.805 --> 29:18.446
That's a real word.

29:21.763 --> 29:25.745
The way the risk ratio works is very sensitive to small size, small end size.

29:26.026 --> 29:34.692
And even though I go all over the country, people, everybody in the country thinks, oh, California has huge districts like LA, but we also have very small districts and rural districts.

29:35.112 --> 29:42.317
And because of that, very small districts can easily get caught up in disproportionality when it's one or two students using a risk ratio.

29:42.377 --> 29:43.318
And so the U.S.

29:43.338 --> 29:49.302
Department of Education has published clarification that we can use an exclusionary criteria when the end size is too low.

29:49.822 --> 29:58.286
And we work through a stakeholder group also to set the minimum end size to sort of exclude students or to use an alternate risk ratio where it's appropriate.

29:58.606 --> 30:07.269
So that's why you kind of see over the course of time, one of the reasons you see a decrease in the numbers is because we sort of refined our methodology.

30:07.289 --> 30:12.852
I also think there's districts who are making improvements over time and so we're seeing that as well.

30:13.552 --> 30:17.514
This year we're using the three year significant disproportionality using all

30:19.114 --> 30:28.016
Three years of the new methodology will find 138 LEAs will be significantly disproportionate, which is a big increase.

30:28.436 --> 30:30.136
Last year we identified 20.

30:31.297 --> 30:36.158
So we'll see about 100 more LEAs identified in significant disproportionality.

30:36.518 --> 30:43.139
They will need to set aside 15% of their IDEA funds and they will need to create a coordinated early intervening services plan.

30:43.619 --> 30:50.462
These districts have been working through disproportionality over the last three years, so it's not necessarily a new set of information.

30:52.763 --> 31:02.427
So I know people typically have lots of questions about disproportionality, so I just wanted to pause here and give folks a minute if they had questions about this calculation, the process, the districts.

31:08.138 --> 31:12.980
First of all, Shiloh, I want to begin by saying thank you for the work that you and your department do on this.

31:13.340 --> 31:20.743
I've had an opportunity to go to a lot of the stakeholder meetings concerning disproportionality and observe the conversations.

31:21.143 --> 31:32.248
The people in the room are intensely interested not only in this policy but the impact of the change and how the risk ratio computations are actually made.

31:32.688 --> 31:45.560
They were very thoughtful in giving advice on the type of waiver, the type of work that California needs to do as this process and this policy was going to affect or have an impact on rural school districts.

31:46.041 --> 31:47.222
I do have a question.

31:47.322 --> 31:50.505
Understanding that the plan requires them to encumber

31:51.025 --> 31:57.090
some of their federal funds from IDA to implement this plan.

31:57.150 --> 32:14.766
I want to also understand what is the nexus between the type of planning they need to do as it relates to their IDEA program and their LCAP since we continue to try to educate locals that special ed students or general ed students as well.

32:15.486 --> 32:18.549
Is there a nexus in any of this work or consideration

32:19.009 --> 32:23.933
in what we task districts or county offices to do with regard to their LCAP?

32:24.934 --> 32:39.546
Yes, and we are in the process right now of sort of coalescing and making more coherent our monitoring practices, including over time, this has been a very separate thing, even from some of the other special education

32:40.567 --> 32:41.788
monitoring activities, right?

32:41.828 --> 32:45.712
So it was kind of sitting over here, but what we know is that it's all interrelated.

32:46.092 --> 32:52.678
This happens coming out of a lot of things from general ed from the beginning as opposed to just a special ed type of treatment.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.681
So the answer is at this point we are

32:57.483 --> 33:08.852
putting significant disproportionality within the context of one plan for special education for districts instead of multiple plans so that there can start to be some cohesion.

33:08.912 --> 33:24.143
So when, as we start to develop this even more over time, there can be that direct tie between that one special ed plan that looks at disproportionality as well as the other issues because we have a lot of districts in numerous different activities.

33:24.523 --> 33:26.745
They're working on increasing assessment scores,

33:27.625 --> 33:37.949
behavioral issues, other things that really need to all dovetail into one coherent plan versus all these separate things and then different people are assigned in districts or whatever to these separate things.

33:37.989 --> 33:41.451
So yes, we are absolutely thinking about that.

33:42.111 --> 33:49.294
We're enacting sort of a basic model this year and we're bringing significant, so for our districts that are in intensive review,

33:50.414 --> 33:57.299
significant disproportionality is going to fit in that category of getting that intensive technical assistance, and we're trying to kind of marry those things.

33:57.379 --> 33:57.939
Does that help?

33:58.199 --> 33:59.040
Yes, that does help.

33:59.200 --> 34:11.828
On its face, I know I should be concerned that the number of LEAs identified as being in significant disproportionality jumped from 20 to 138, and on its face, I know I should be concerned

34:12.168 --> 34:22.501
particularly because the students who are impacted are language learners, Hispanic students and African American students.

34:23.021 --> 34:31.572
But because of the explanation you gave about the state's effort to create some coherence and how to do the planning and in that way

34:31.992 --> 34:46.382
exerting the leadership in this vacuum for these LEAs, I'm going to hold on to that concern and that anxiety to see what the sustained effect for this statewide planning and assertive guidance is actually going to look like.

34:46.402 --> 34:50.905
Thank you.

34:50.925 --> 34:52.906
Other questions about disproportionality?

34:55.972 --> 35:03.114
Is there somewhere that we could see which districts have the significant disproportionality?

35:03.434 --> 35:05.595
We don't have it publicly posted yet.

35:05.795 --> 35:09.536
We haven't notified all the districts yet, and so we will.

35:09.576 --> 35:13.638
So this will actually affect their 2021 budget year set aside.

35:14.018 --> 35:19.939
So we are getting ready to notify them this month so that they can prepare their budgets for the upcoming 2020 fiscal year.

35:26.569 --> 35:27.790
I'm going to continue on.

35:29.732 --> 35:32.034
There are a number of performance indicators.

35:32.094 --> 35:33.735
Again, we will not be going through all of them.

35:34.616 --> 35:38.740
Here's the general takeaway I will give you around the performance indicators.

35:38.940 --> 35:40.081
Some indicators we did better.

35:40.361 --> 35:41.623
Some indicators we did worse.

35:41.843 --> 35:45.126
In general, we are going in the direction where we would like to go.

35:45.146 --> 35:48.449
So we are improving where we need to improve, and we are

35:50.116 --> 35:54.337
going down where we need to go down, it's just not at a rate we would prefer to see.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.338
So in many cases, it's about 1% change.

35:59.079 --> 36:05.840
The thing I do like people to remember when we talk about students with disabilities, 1% does equal about 7,000 to 8,000 students.

36:06.401 --> 36:10.402
So when we're thinking of it that way, it is a change for those 7,000 students.

36:10.782 --> 36:15.403
We wanna see more, we wanna see more growth, especially in some of the areas that I'm gonna point out today.

36:17.978 --> 36:20.941
So I wanna talk a little bit about the statewide assessment indicator.

36:21.021 --> 36:29.268
So again, this is an indicator that is a little bit different in terms of the way that we present the data for the dashboard.

36:29.308 --> 36:34.192
So this does not look at how close students are to meeting the standard.

36:34.312 --> 36:39.036
It has the percentage of students who are meeting standards or exceeding standards.

36:39.656 --> 36:42.459
And it does not take into account the change from the previous year.

36:43.911 --> 36:56.643
So the target for participation is 95%, and the targets for proficiency is 15.9% in ELA and 13.6% in math.

36:58.205 --> 37:01.528
Folks often ask me, why are those targets seemingly so low?

37:01.668 --> 37:04.851
In part, because when we started the benchmark process, when the CASP

37:05.351 --> 37:27.075
first came out the the results where we started the baseline was low and so we've increased since that time but we didn't we started at around 10% and we're not going to set the target at 30 we're gonna kind of continue that process but we'd have those conversations when we start the the target setting process in the upcoming year for the state performance plan.

37:28.846 --> 37:33.447
So for participation in general, the target is 95%.

37:34.567 --> 37:37.828
We did not meet the target in math or in ELA this year.

37:37.868 --> 37:39.928
We were a little bit below, 94.5% and 94.1%.

37:44.209 --> 37:48.490
We did have indicator three, which is our proficiency rate.

37:48.910 --> 37:55.532
So the top chart here is where we are this year as compared to last year's, the bottom chart.

37:56.744 --> 38:01.605
We met the targets for ELA and math for all types of districts.

38:02.165 --> 38:08.306
We separate the data by the type of district because elementary schools are different than high school districts and unified school districts.

38:08.606 --> 38:14.908
We do see more variability among our high school districts because typically that is solely 11th grade.

38:15.688 --> 38:17.428
So it's that one year 11th grade test.

38:17.508 --> 38:18.989
You will see more variability there.

38:19.009 --> 38:20.949
But we did meet the target for ELA.

38:21.749 --> 38:25.170
And in fact, we increased from the previous year in all the categories in ELA.

38:26.110 --> 38:32.752
In math, we also saw increases across the board, but we did not meet the target in high school districts and unified districts.

38:34.473 --> 38:38.354
So unified, the target for high school districts is a 13.6%.

38:38.414 --> 38:39.295
We have been improving.

38:39.575 --> 38:40.175
We're still only at 8.1%.

38:40.255 --> 38:44.536
Did anyone have questions there?

38:44.776 --> 38:45.577
I'm going to continue on.

38:47.168 --> 38:53.792
Um, so I want to talk a little bit about least restrictive environment and people typically talk about this about placement and there are 3 categories.

38:53.852 --> 38:57.074
This is where a student goes to school the majority of their day.

38:57.774 --> 39:01.736
So, are they spending 80% of their more of their time in a regular classroom?

39:01.836 --> 39:04.678
Are they spending less than 40% of time in a classroom?

39:04.998 --> 39:07.700
Are they in a separate school or placement altogether?

39:08.440 --> 39:15.706
And so our targets for those are 52% for students all day in a class, 21% for students who are 40% of the day or less in a class, and 38% of students, or 3.8% of students who are served in a separate placement altogether.

39:25.123 --> 39:30.567
And the good news is that we did meet the target for each one of these indicators, which is very good.

39:31.787 --> 39:35.930
However, for each one of these indicators, we saw less than a 1% gain.

39:37.191 --> 39:42.735
So for example, we only saw a change from our 2017 result, which was 56.1% to 56.8%, a 0.7% increase.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.356
So we did see an increase, that's the good news.

39:44.376 --> 39:46.017
We did not see as much of an increase as we would like.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.246
Preschool least restrictive environment.

40:01.108 --> 40:06.232
So one of the things that we are, we're measured against, so preschool's a little bit different.

40:06.392 --> 40:11.996
It's not necessarily where the student goes to preschool, it's where they're provided their services, right?

40:12.036 --> 40:17.381
So are the services being provided in a regular preschool program or are they provided in a separate school or somewhere else?

40:18.121 --> 40:30.172
And so in general, we met the target for students who were in a regular preschool program receiving services, but we did decrease.

40:30.552 --> 40:39.179
So that's something to kind of point out, is that we went from 37% of students who were receiving their services in a regular preschool classroom to 36.5%.

40:41.221 --> 40:46.751
We do want to see fewer students being served in a separate class, and we did see that, but it's a small percentage decline of 0.05%.

40:46.831 --> 40:48.194
So it's really almost the same.

40:53.956 --> 41:09.663
The key kind of takeaway that we wanna really identify is that while we saw fewer students being served in a regular classroom, we also wanna make sure that we're not seeing a decline in students who are having access to a regular education curriculum.

41:09.703 --> 41:19.507
And Kristen will often talk about this, is that when we start to have students in regular classrooms included at the preschool level, it sort of carries on into their elementary school.

41:19.527 --> 41:21.048
It's sort of like that's the on-ramp.

41:21.588 --> 41:39.678
And so that idea that we can have students in preschool, more access to preschool, more preschool options for students, children with disabilities at that age, where they're kind of accessing and practicing positive behavior, appropriate levels of behavior for children, where they are practicing social emotional and language skills, that's really important.

41:39.738 --> 41:44.220
And we want to see that because that continues when they start their school age and K-12 journey.

41:46.485 --> 41:51.047
So one area that we did see a decline is in our post-secondary outcomes.

41:51.947 --> 41:55.368
I wanna always sort of set the caveat on how this is measured.

41:55.588 --> 42:13.495
We measure this data by asking districts to follow up on students one year after they've left school and then see if the student is going to college, if they're competitively employed, if they're in some other kind of training program, other kind of employment.

42:14.455 --> 42:16.416
And so this is a rolling indicator.

42:16.476 --> 42:21.777
So the first part of the indicator identifies students in higher education one year after they leave school.

42:22.357 --> 42:27.499
The second part of the indicator, B, identifies students who are both in higher education and competitively employed.

42:27.559 --> 42:37.462
So adding B into A. And then C is any student who's in any kind of employment or education, competitively in great employment, higher education.

42:39.409 --> 42:47.493
So one of the things that we did see here was we met the target and increased slightly for students who are enrolled in higher education.

42:47.893 --> 42:59.038
However, we decreased almost 7% for students with disabilities who are accessing competitive integrated employment after high school.

42:59.258 --> 42:59.778
Almost 7% decrease.

43:01.559 --> 43:03.900
So that's not something that we would typically wanna see.

43:03.960 --> 43:08.102
We wanna see more access to competitive and great employment for our children who are leaving high school.

43:09.183 --> 43:15.566
And then we pretty much, we increase a little bit for students who are accessing some other type of employment or education.

43:18.907 --> 43:20.248
So questions about that?

43:29.718 --> 43:40.386
Okay, so those are the only indicators I've selected to go through, but I wanted to provide this opportunity to anybody who had any questions about any other indicators or any of the things I've presented today.

43:47.986 --> 43:58.137
Shiloh, thank you so much, because this is really, you made what was a really deep dive pretty simple to understand, I think, even though it can be quite complicated.

43:58.978 --> 44:07.888
Can you go back to indicator 10, because even though you were talking about the challenges of disproportionality, I think in relationship to the

44:09.744 --> 44:12.685
decrease you saw there, that's huge there.

44:12.845 --> 44:13.605
Can you speak to that?

44:14.185 --> 44:22.627
So one of the things we saw is that students with disability, or I'm sorry, districts who are identified with being disproportionate, it's the same districts, and I think they're continuing to work.

44:22.667 --> 44:29.468
So I went through a review last year, so they're continuing to work on their practices, policies, and procedures.

44:30.048 --> 44:34.529
We are continuing to review that and making sure that we're identifying the right items as we're going forward.

44:35.583 --> 44:47.952
I mean, because I think the ad for me is just, boy, if we saw minus 17%, we'd be lighting confetti cannons for any other data.

44:48.012 --> 44:53.035
And I think it's important to call out that this is significant.

44:54.356 --> 45:00.741
Number two, we've made study growth, but the caveat is not enough.

45:02.347 --> 45:18.105
So when we're thinking about this 7% access to competitive employment, it's probably related to the reality that only about 14% of our students with disabilities are acquiring a higher degree, like a BA and beyond.

45:18.567 --> 45:28.609
And that's directly related to the least restrictive environment issue, which is that they have access and high expectations around rigorous curriculum in the general education classroom.

45:29.089 --> 45:44.373
So I think the LRE data is probably the key to where we can have a boost, a shot in the arm, because it appears, if maybe you can speak to that, it appears that even though we've seen an increase of approximately 5,000 students

45:46.164 --> 45:54.022
it's over several years, which is less than, so essentially we're not really tapping the needle, right?

45:54.042 --> 45:55.446
Am I understanding that correctly?

45:55.799 --> 45:56.319
That is correct.

45:56.419 --> 46:03.241
So, we do see 5,000 students who are moving to a more integrated classroom, which is exciting.

46:03.841 --> 46:08.163
I always liken that to the student population of San Francisco Unified.

46:09.143 --> 46:11.364
However, it's still just not enough.

46:11.404 --> 46:16.705
I mean, if you think about statewide, we have 2,200 school districts and charter schools.

46:17.686 --> 46:25.588
That's two students per LEA, and so we wanna see more, right, obviously, and I think Kristen can speak to that.

46:26.877 --> 46:33.779
Yeah, and I think it's important to keep in mind, too, that every student on their IEP is on an individual entitlement for where their placement is.

46:34.340 --> 46:39.641
And so what we do want to see is definitely an increase in access to general education.

46:39.662 --> 46:48.565
What we don't want to see is some sweeping, you know, one day you have a system and everyone has an IEP that's saying where they're being served, and then the next day it's something completely different.

46:48.585 --> 46:52.246
Because every IEP has to be discussed, as you know, Matt.

46:52.666 --> 46:57.931
with parents to determine, you know, and a lot of this is around a culture shift.

46:58.352 --> 47:05.379
And that's why the preschool piece is so important, is because you're telling parents at the beginning that children belong and that their family belongs.

47:05.659 --> 47:07.181
And so that does carry on.

47:07.521 --> 47:10.204
So I think we're at a really pivotal point in our state.

47:10.224 --> 47:16.290
We're really shifting that with all that we're putting into preschool and the partnerships around inclusion in preschool.

47:16.770 --> 47:24.036
Hopefully we'll start to see that trend, but we have kids in high school that have been in separate settings their entire life, that started in preschool their entire life.

47:24.577 --> 47:33.084
So there is some, you know, we talk to a lot of parents and there is some fear about all of a sudden one day you're going to be fully included in your high school when you've never been included before.

47:33.704 --> 47:45.312
And so we have a lot of work to do there, and we're doing a lot of work around our Supporting Inclusive Practices Project and other projects around the preschool issues to address those things.

47:45.832 --> 47:55.199
And then also to Matt's point about the competitive integrated employment, we still have a really significant issue around the diploma.

47:55.659 --> 48:01.463
And so if you consider that most employers require a high school diploma even to get in the door,

48:02.123 --> 48:08.045
And so unless you're volunteering, which is not competitive integrated employment, you cannot get a viable job unless you have a diploma.

48:08.065 --> 48:11.426
We're at 66% graduation rate right now for students with disabilities.

48:11.486 --> 48:19.169
And I know we want to get into in the discussion a little bit more about the diploma question, but we are now getting into discussion and we're supposed to be in clarification.

48:19.189 --> 48:28.592
So I just want to give Nikki Sandoval an opportunity as our liaison to make any comments before we then, you know, get into public comment and then we'll come back to discussion.

48:31.789 --> 48:32.129
Thank you.

48:32.169 --> 48:35.570
Well, it's I appreciate the great work that you do.

48:35.590 --> 48:42.412
I just I don't know how you all get any sleep really because you're just so deep into this and then also don't.

48:45.052 --> 48:54.395
And I think this particular executive summary that we're being asked to review and approve today is the what, you know, the state of special education in the state.

48:55.195 --> 49:03.301
And there's going to be more work around the data and what we do with it and how do we act on it to better serve our students.

49:03.761 --> 49:10.826
And there's a lot of great work happening I think to move the needle in the right direction.

49:11.107 --> 49:15.029
And in March we'll talk more about the what and what's happening.

49:15.350 --> 49:21.754
And I think there's more integration and cohesion now than has been in a really long time.

49:23.553 --> 49:28.437
a lot of agency coordination, and we've got such a great team in place working on this.

49:28.537 --> 49:46.932
So I just thank you for breaking it down and for anticipating the questions in those key areas, especially around disproportionality, suspension and expulsion, graduation and assessment, because we have some incremental successes to acknowledge, but also a really long way to go.

49:47.573 --> 49:52.136
So I don't have any further clarifying questions because your presentation was really clear.

49:52.416 --> 49:52.737
Thank you.

49:53.938 --> 50:00.583
But I do say, you know, stay tuned for a deeper discussion in the how we're addressing it as a state in March.

50:00.964 --> 50:01.664
This is the what.

50:04.286 --> 50:08.810
So I do want to get to public comment, then we'll come back and really do a deeper discussion.

50:09.611 --> 50:10.752
Do we have any public comment?

50:14.455 --> 50:14.715
Yes.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.361
Gina Plate.

50:26.676 --> 50:29.017
And please state your name and affiliation for the record.

50:29.037 --> 50:29.077
OK.

50:30.578 --> 50:35.701
Frederick Augustus Gale, Jr., September 22, 1931.

50:38.302 --> 50:45.986
And previously, I served on the Rio Linda Union School, not Rio Linda, elementary school district board of directors and the grant one.

50:47.747 --> 50:49.708
And I was just charting some things down.

50:51.769 --> 50:56.011
Nash, Packard, DeSoto, Plymouth, LaSalle, Hudson, Tucker,

50:56.488 --> 50:59.269
Mercury, Oldsmobile, and Austin.

51:00.769 --> 51:08.790
And I'm with Paul Robeson, Thomas Payne, Allison Davis, Wolfgang von Goethe, Common Sense Society.

51:10.091 --> 51:23.253
But I would ask you to read, this is a classic case of special education, Sac City, the Holland case, versus Sacramento City University School District.

51:23.993 --> 51:26.455
It was monitored by McGeorge School of Law.

51:27.135 --> 51:28.116
Everybody should have it.

51:28.316 --> 51:31.398
And some of the questions we're asking about was covered.

51:32.199 --> 51:35.461
The common one, we don't have the resources, et cetera, et cetera.

51:36.242 --> 51:38.543
Did not pass the muster.

51:39.504 --> 51:45.208
Read that, and you really see we are not trying to reinvent the wheel.

51:46.229 --> 51:47.490
The law is there.

51:48.143 --> 51:51.826
It's the Magna Carta of special education.

51:52.066 --> 51:57.231
We can't, you know, poor districts don't have the resources, no skills.

51:58.412 --> 51:59.733
So read that.

52:00.753 --> 52:01.814
It might save some time.

52:02.875 --> 52:10.101
And you can get a copy, probably online, but if you might go to the school of law, you can go back and get it.

52:10.121 --> 52:10.822
It's relentless.

52:11.422 --> 52:11.983
Sac City.

52:13.226 --> 52:13.646
Right here.

52:13.726 --> 52:14.047
Time.

52:14.607 --> 52:19.531
It was Holland case for the person.

52:20.272 --> 52:22.374
And the rules were set there.

52:23.334 --> 52:23.675
Time.

52:24.175 --> 52:25.156
Exclusion was limited.

52:26.477 --> 52:27.738
And thank you very much.

52:28.098 --> 52:28.479
Thank you.

52:39.585 --> 52:45.049
Good morning President Darling-Hammond, members of the board, Chief Deputy.

52:45.229 --> 52:45.869
Happy New Year.

52:46.770 --> 52:49.532
Gina Plate, Special Education and CCSA.

52:50.152 --> 52:59.619
And first I want to thank Kristen Wright and Shiloh for their presentation and share that the Advisory Commission on Special Ed heard this information back in October.

53:00.359 --> 53:03.261
and are in full support, encourage you to be in full support.

53:03.301 --> 53:08.825
It sounds like I don't even have to say that because folks are in full support because of the detail they provided.

53:09.345 --> 53:14.469
I also want to commend the department because as Kristen said early on, this is an exciting time.

53:15.370 --> 53:21.074
And the way, you know, Board Member Navo, the way that you commented on how Shiloh broke down the data,

53:21.714 --> 53:42.301
is what the department is doing statewide, and they're doing such a nice job of helping the field understand how to take this complex data, and to your point, board member Rucker, include it in their LCAP discussions, and bring together many discussions in a way that includes each and every child.

53:42.721 --> 53:45.062
So I encourage you to support, and thank you for the time.

53:51.233 --> 54:06.503
Seeing no other public comment, let's open the floor for a board discussion, which we were well launched on and Member Navo, thank you so much for getting us into that observation about the places where we're really showing serious gains.

54:07.263 --> 54:21.616
I just want to add to that as we're launching the further discussion that it would be great to look at some of the places where those gains are happening and really study that and be able to speak to what they're doing that's producing that effect.

54:21.716 --> 54:23.137
So we should look into that.

54:23.998 --> 54:26.800
Other comments that folks want to make?

54:26.920 --> 54:28.722
Yes, member Strauss.

54:30.516 --> 54:34.098
I want to thank the team for the really hard work in the presentation.

54:34.418 --> 54:39.140
I think the data is really starting to impact local district practice and special education.

54:39.520 --> 54:49.004
So from our dashboard and highlighting it and being out and working in districts, districts who are high achieving districts are suddenly getting a red and then having to take a look at what happened.

54:49.384 --> 54:53.866
And so in my work out in school districts just to reinforce the benefit of use of data

54:54.406 --> 55:04.175
It's really helping districts take a look at universal design for learning, more inclusive classrooms, where the traditional practice had been less inclusivity in the early training many years ago.

55:04.556 --> 55:15.586
And the CTC is working on additional training through credentialing programs, and it's really generated a really strong conversation about what is best practice for students with a variety of disabilities.

55:15.967 --> 55:19.410
So I just want to support the use of the data and the rollout and the

55:19.790 --> 55:28.433
work that's going on around the state to help them understand the data that districts are getting now and to recognize that this is so going to benefit our students in the long run.

55:29.353 --> 55:39.297
So using data, helping them understand how to unpack it and what practices to do when they identify a problem because they honestly don't know sometimes what to do to change it because that's how they were trained.

55:39.657 --> 55:43.643
So I just think I really am excited about the direction we're going in, in the use of data.

55:43.683 --> 55:51.233
And I'd be interested to hear, I know Nikki said it's coming back in March, about sort of what are we doing out in the field to help them understand and unpack and change practice.

55:51.654 --> 55:51.854
Thanks.

55:52.745 --> 55:53.525
Yes, Member Sung.

55:54.726 --> 55:58.608
My comments are very similar to Member Strauss.

55:58.628 --> 56:00.229
I look forward to this data every year.

56:00.249 --> 56:05.111
I really appreciate how much work goes into it, and it's always so illustrative.

56:05.971 --> 56:10.574
I always feel, however, that we stop short of having that next conversation.

56:10.714 --> 56:15.016
So I'm very happy to hear that we will be talking about this in March.

56:15.797 --> 56:19.200
about what now do we do as a state.

56:19.381 --> 56:20.662
We know the issues.

56:20.922 --> 56:23.045
We don't broach on the funding.

56:23.065 --> 56:29.492
I mean, resources and funding and our current system that we have for the funding of special education.

56:30.433 --> 56:34.915
what's not working, what is working, what we need to do to fix, to make it better.

56:34.935 --> 56:50.461
It is a mindset, a cultural shift, as Kristen had said about what we need to do at the school site level for many of us, but what are we doing to help shift that?

56:50.842 --> 56:58.145
And it goes into our curriculum and looking at how instruction is done.

56:59.285 --> 57:00.146
for all students.

57:00.666 --> 57:02.847
So there's a lot that we need to talk about.

57:02.887 --> 57:04.868
We have shortages in special education.

57:04.908 --> 57:12.433
It's hard, very, very difficult to find qualified, trained teachers, psychologists, all kinds of staff.

57:13.393 --> 57:17.116
So in order to meet these targets, we have to talk about

57:17.936 --> 57:23.221
the surround and I'm not sure that we as a state have really had that conversation.

57:23.361 --> 57:35.713
So I'm hoping that in March that we get a little bit deeper into that and it's not just looking at the data and we get into really kind of roll up our sleeves and talk about what now we need to do and where we want to go.

57:38.131 --> 57:53.409
I think that's a really good point, and I'm going to come over to Member Patio-Bronson, but I will note that last year the governor put $90 million in the budget for addressing teacher shortages through scholarships for special education teachers, math and science teachers.

57:53.449 --> 57:54.510
That begins this month.

57:55.111 --> 58:03.199
So those will go out on the street to schools of education to encourage people to go into those fields.

58:04.180 --> 58:12.868
And last year also there was an allocation of funding for professional development around social emotional learning and restorative practices, which we know are really related to the.

58:13.608 --> 58:14.689
issues of suspension.

58:15.169 --> 58:29.560
Again, that's about to go out into the field and we'll want to monitor how some of those attempts and whatever comes this year are helping us really build a support system for those actions.

58:30.000 --> 58:30.881
Member Patel-Bronson.

58:32.158 --> 58:36.682
I also just want to thank the team, Shaila and Kristen, for the presentation.

58:36.722 --> 58:41.786
This data is just very well presented and digestible.

58:42.006 --> 58:52.515
One question or maybe area for highlight, and this picks up on Ting's point around what next for March is around indicator 12 and early childhood transitions.

58:53.675 --> 59:05.081
for the data where we haven't been meeting our transition targets consistently from the 2013 to 2018 period.

59:06.041 --> 59:14.225
And this is the data around the percentage of children who are found eligible for Part B have an IEP developed.

59:14.705 --> 59:17.046
but not implemented by their third birthday.

59:17.506 --> 59:26.468
This gets to this idea of preventing the achievement gap early and getting services to children before they become a lot more expensive, candidly.

59:27.848 --> 59:36.130
Thinking about, as we get to March, what we can learn about where it's not happening, but also where there are bright spots that can be emulated and shared across districts.

59:36.890 --> 59:53.218
I think the rule of thumb that you had described earlier was that a percentage point is about 7,000 kids, and we're falling short by about 5 percent of our target, which is 35,000 kids across the state.

59:54.379 --> 01:00:02.603
This is an area for growth, for sure, but also one that has huge implications for LEAs who then have the kids a couple years later.

01:00:03.463 --> 01:00:04.624
May I comment to that?

01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:18.333
You may be interested that in this last budget there was a $500,000 allocation for us to convene two work groups under SB 75, one for the C to B transition.

01:00:18.813 --> 01:00:26.258
And so one of our charges, and we've just begun that work with the Department of Developmental Services, is to look at what the barriers are

01:00:26.678 --> 01:00:40.014
to smooth C to B transition and to make recommendations to the legislature about what needs to happen if there's some kind of statutory changes or whatever those barriers are, whether they're local, regional or statewide.

01:00:40.555 --> 01:00:45.861
And so we are really excited to be doing that work and are happy to keep you apprised of that or if you want to be involved in some way as well.

01:00:46.659 --> 01:00:50.041
And part C to part B, so our part C program is our infant and toddler program.

01:00:50.501 --> 01:01:03.990
While we serve about 5,000 children with disabilities in that program at local education agencies, there is another about 45,000 infants and toddlers with disabilities that are served at regional centers, which is administered by the Department of Developmental Services.

01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:13.396
And so it's working in coordination with those entities as the children are moving from those regional center programs into preschool programs.

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:15.297
And we know that districts have found that

01:01:15.717 --> 01:01:19.821
timeline to be challenging as they're moving on and ensuring that coordination.

01:01:19.861 --> 01:01:27.688
So I think part of that work group is also working through helping districts improve communication between the regional centers, help children make that timely transition.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:29.490
And also start those conversations earlier.

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:32.853
So not waiting till almost three to try to figure out what's next.

01:01:33.394 --> 01:01:34.895
So a lot of good work happening there.

01:01:34.935 --> 01:01:36.897
Thank you for bringing that up.

01:01:36.917 --> 01:01:38.178
Other discussion?

01:01:38.218 --> 01:01:38.739
Member Rucker?

01:01:40.202 --> 01:01:49.113
Well, there's a couple of the items in the statistics that I wanted to ask you to go and show again because I have both a question and a comment.

01:01:50.034 --> 01:01:57.683
On the placement goals, and you had the three categories of the placement goals for least restrictive environment.

01:01:58.143 --> 01:02:08.786
The conversation that we are having about those goals is very different than the conversation that school districts and classroom teachers have.

01:02:09.366 --> 01:02:19.489
Particularly as it relates to the push to increase the number of students with disabilities who are in general education programs.

01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:24.070
Because while we have this very specific and important goal,

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:36.438
Many schools do not understand what the program and support requirements are for those classroom teachers and those students in the classroom.

01:02:36.859 --> 01:02:54.191
So part of the reason why I asked Kristen what is the plan or what is the nexus in doing the planning for this, because one of the things I was struck by Shiloh's data is the continuing increase in the number of students being identified in the special education population.

01:02:54.731 --> 01:03:08.463
If the percentage of students in general ed classrooms is going to continue to grow, the urgency for the type of planning and the support requirements that should be happening at the classroom level is not happening.

01:03:08.803 --> 01:03:20.513
And so part two of our conversation in March or whenever we have that conversation, I would really like to hear from your division what is in your plan, what is the,

01:03:23.014 --> 01:03:30.556
of the support that you're giving and the guidance you're offering in this broad state plan and how does it contemplate that impact.

01:03:31.176 --> 01:03:36.217
But the other thing I think about is I sit here and I'm the liaison for the math framework.

01:03:36.817 --> 01:03:41.658
I found this data compelling because it informs some other conversations.

01:03:42.199 --> 01:03:48.320
We're looking at every single month we have waivers concerning resource programs.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:04:03.580
And while one of the compelling reasons why we can deny a waiver is because it's not in the best interest of the students, we've done a lot of work to work with districts directly to give them greater responsibility for the due diligence and the decisions they make.

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:26.097
about staffing these programs, but I think this data tells us we should be doing more in having the conversation about those resource program waivers and what districts are doing because by the time they get to the point that they need to request a waiver from the board, it's not, there's some other things that are going on about the delivery of services for those students that aren't happening.

01:04:26.398 --> 01:04:28.059
We need to think about those things.

01:04:28.499 --> 01:04:32.743
And then as I sit here looking at the work that we're about to undertake in reviving

01:04:33.323 --> 01:04:35.784
revising the math framework.

01:04:35.824 --> 01:04:37.945
And I did actually want to say reviving.

01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:46.348
I'm sensitive to the fact that there's a lot of criticism in what resulted in the adoption that came from that framework.

01:04:47.028 --> 01:04:54.771
And I'm also sensitive to the fact that we still need to do more work to provide an instructional frame for the classroom teachers.

01:04:55.211 --> 01:05:01.594
I think that this information also should inform the way we revise and even rewrite some of those scenarios

01:05:02.114 --> 01:05:19.723
in that are in the framework that show instructional sequences or that give examples of instructional interaction activities because we're not knowing that our students with disabilities are emerging as a priority student subgroup across the state providing instructional resources and guidance

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:32.549
about what the integration of those students into general ed programs and the lesson planning considerations, we have an opportunity in the framework to reframe that conversation as well because this data defines that.

01:05:32.649 --> 01:05:46.256
So even though it's a separate and related item, I'm hoping as part of that conversation in March, the board also suggests some guidance for what we should be doing in writing about universal designs for learning in our framework.

01:05:46.736 --> 01:05:52.744
and how we write instructional scenarios for the framework that give teachers a great deal of guidance.

01:05:56.208 --> 01:06:00.053
Discussion before we make a motion to adopt this report?

01:06:02.116 --> 01:06:02.356
Yes.

01:06:04.117 --> 01:06:07.358
I know this is jumping ahead to March, but it does follow up on member Rutgers.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:14.421
But if you could speak just a little bit, Kristen, about the system of support and the improvement leads.

01:06:14.461 --> 01:06:18.102
And I know there's a launch of a website and that has some professional learning resources.

01:06:18.522 --> 01:06:20.084
So those are things that are already happening.

01:06:20.104 --> 01:06:22.926
If you could just elaborate a bit on that.

01:06:23.667 --> 01:06:30.333
There is definitely a lot happening around understanding that the field and teachers in particular need a lot of support.

01:06:30.393 --> 01:06:38.000
They're getting a whole new set of students many times in their classrooms and we've heard back from teachers that they feel unprepared for certain

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.562
types of disabilities and behaviors, and so how do we make sure we're empowering them?

01:06:43.002 --> 01:06:50.265
We have from last year a series, and in the budget, a series of SELPA leads that you've had presented, coming to present to you before.

01:06:50.665 --> 01:07:03.270
Those SELPA leads are doing some incredible work developing resources, and we've asked them to not just support, their task is to support other SELPAs in being able to support the LEAs in their district.

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:05.271
or in their catchment area.

01:07:05.571 --> 01:07:09.834
But what they're doing is developing resources at all the tiers.

01:07:10.174 --> 01:07:17.539
So there's tier one resources for everyone and tier two resources for them to be, they're doing statewide trainings.

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.384
And they're also supporting SELPAs that have districts and differentiated assistance.

01:07:23.424 --> 01:07:25.205
They're working across the leads.

01:07:25.245 --> 01:07:27.086
So they're also informing the GEO leads.

01:07:27.106 --> 01:07:31.390
They're working closely within the state system of support as a team member.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:38.695
And so there's a lot of sharing happening that hasn't really happened in our state up to now.

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:46.100
And so thank you for asking that question because I do think we are sort of trying to build overall state capacity.

01:07:46.380 --> 01:08:01.349
We're also doing that from the special ed division lens where we have our own projects and contractors that were also working with districts directly like our supporting inclusive practice project and other projects that also are now becoming integrated with the system of support.

01:08:01.569 --> 01:08:04.651
So usually we had our own activities and we did our thing and then

01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:06.752
The other parts of the system did their own thing.

01:08:07.133 --> 01:08:14.519
Really, everyone is coming together like never before to be able to build that capacity with teachers.

01:08:14.579 --> 01:08:19.543
And one of the things, we've had quite a bit of research over the past couple of years.

01:08:19.783 --> 01:08:24.147
I think you heard the Ventura research around access to general ed for students with disabilities.

01:08:24.547 --> 01:08:31.573
The data is compelling around how much better students do when they get access to good teaching and curriculum.

01:08:33.414 --> 01:08:39.839
Traditionally, we've had very separate curriculum for students with disabilities who are served in separate classrooms.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:49.747
And so when teachers are trying to bring in kids to include them in gen ed, they're completely lost because they're not even on the same track or trajectory with what they're learning.

01:08:50.188 --> 01:08:54.551
And so part of this is, how can everyone be on the same trajectory with their learning?

01:08:54.611 --> 01:08:56.033
Because we do require that

01:08:56.873 --> 01:08:59.115
IEP goals are aligned to grade level standards.

01:08:59.215 --> 01:09:06.101
We expect that kids get to learn new information every year and have access to all that's in our frameworks and our standards.

01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:11.045
And so the curriculum piece does become a huge piece.

01:09:11.065 --> 01:09:24.697
And it would be our dream to have that integrated in one curriculum where you have universal design for learning as the foundation because it requires so much less going back and changing things later and modifying because you have so much built into that.

01:09:25.257 --> 01:09:26.678
first here, so thank you.

01:09:27.278 --> 01:09:27.598
Thanks.

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:31.501
Member Burr and then member Ortiz.

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:49.591
I can't let this go by without circling back to our accountability system and reminding folks that a couple of years ago when we first revealed the data for the dashboard, folks were shocked that the student subgroup that was most reflected were students with disabilities.

01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:59.738
and both Shiloh and Kristen's done this before, show the important overlap with our also underrepresented groups and the basis on which we fund LCFF.

01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:12.308
But I really believe that the shining the light on students with disabilities made districts sit back and go, whoa, we have been maybe paying attention to wrong things.

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:16.730
or organizing in a way that's not the most beneficial to all of our students.

01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:28.958
And I think I just wanted to reinforce that because to me that's kind of when the light bulb went on and also celebrate again what Kristen said at the very beginning, the elimination of a separate data system for special ed.

01:10:29.418 --> 01:10:39.442
This sort of segregation, to use a nasty word, that we have had with students with disabilities for so many years is slowly but surely being broken down.

01:10:40.042 --> 01:10:47.285
And we have to have the next conversation, which a number of people have mentioned, which is what do we do about it and how do we fund it and all of that.

01:10:47.825 --> 01:10:51.808
But I think we have to celebrate that, that we're moving in the right direction.

01:10:51.908 --> 01:10:53.089
We have a lot of work to do.

01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:57.712
And this conversation about the system of support is very important.

01:10:58.373 --> 01:11:02.816
Again, I think without that initial identification, we wouldn't have gotten additional funding.

01:11:02.856 --> 01:11:04.577
We wouldn't be focused on the SELPAs.

01:11:04.637 --> 01:11:08.280
So I just want to say, yay, we're moving in the right direction.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:19.667
And it's also, I think, an opportunity to say our accountability system that said, if you tell LEAs the information that they need, they will do what's right on behalf of students.

01:11:22.109 --> 01:11:22.930
Member Ortiz-Laco?

01:11:24.935 --> 01:11:29.380
I actually wanted to touch upon that too, because I think that the conversations have been so siloed.

01:11:30.741 --> 01:11:40.711
I am glad we're moving more towards integration, but we also have to build a capacity going back to what Board Member Rucker was saying, teacher practice and just environments.

01:11:40.751 --> 01:11:43.854
When you look at students with disabilities, 57% are Latino students.

01:11:45.856 --> 01:11:51.840
And so you could look at a student who's Latino, who's an English learner, who has a speech delay, who's low income.

01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:58.203
There's four different characteristics or identities of the student that have to be met in four different ways.

01:11:58.843 --> 01:12:11.810
And so we also want to make sure that we integrate without melting the identity of that student and making sure that we have an approach and expertise to tease out those needs from that student group.

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:12.911
So it's not just a student,

01:12:14.051 --> 01:12:21.115
a student with disabilities is a student with disability that is an English learner, that is low income, that needs to be taught in culturally competent ways.

01:12:21.935 --> 01:12:24.016
I don't know that we have those expertise.

01:12:24.116 --> 01:12:31.500
I don't know that people could look at a student and sort of tease out all of those identities and that intersectionality is going to be critical moving forward.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.442
So I think that was initially the concern that we're blending it all into one.

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:47.637
So I do think that it's important for us to take an approach that understands that these are our students, but within that approach, have those expertise that are looking at the different needs that student has.

01:12:48.618 --> 01:12:48.879
Thank you.

01:12:53.308 --> 01:13:10.633
point that member Burr made also note that you know while we're having these conversations the Commission on Teacher Credentialing is redefining the credentialing standards for general ed teachers to include a stronger knowledge base about students with disabilities and differentiation.

01:13:12.094 --> 01:13:19.916
The credentialing standards for education specialists are also being changed and that the old standards led to some of the segregation

01:13:20.676 --> 01:13:26.578
because of the way they were defined and then teachers couldn't work across groups of students.

01:13:27.538 --> 01:13:39.021
So we are moving in multiple places and we're going to need to do that because the most fundamental thing for the students we're concerned about here is that they have expert teachers.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:44.902
So we've got to solve the teacher shortage, we've got to build the capacity in pre-service and in in-service

01:13:45.482 --> 01:13:53.473
And then also do all this work that Kristen has talked about and the whole team about what the service delivery models are, et cetera.

01:13:54.414 --> 01:14:00.102
I know we want to get to moving this forward and it's been a great conversation.

01:14:00.142 --> 01:14:01.303
We're going to come back to it in March.

01:14:02.785 --> 01:14:11.248
And I do want for us to take a minute just to hear what you had to say about the diploma question, but we will obviously come back to it.

01:14:11.288 --> 01:14:17.530
So I promise you, we won't discuss it now, but would you at least flag what that reference was about?

01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:18.870
And then we'll come back to it in March.

01:14:19.312 --> 01:14:24.175
So currently, for students with disabilities, our graduation rate is fairly low.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:30.039
And Shiloh can talk whether or not adding the fifth year has helped that.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:43.329
But one of the things that we often hear from superintendents is, especially the superintendents who have taken on a larger percentage of students with more significant disabilities, who have traditionally been on the certificate track.

01:14:44.329 --> 01:14:53.116
And those certificates do not count for our accountability system nor for the Office of Special Education Programs overall accountability.

01:14:53.216 --> 01:15:01.421
So if a student is taking the alternate assessments and is on a certificate track, they receive that certificate and it is not a graduation.

01:15:02.302 --> 01:15:08.407
And so it's an accountability liability for schools and districts, especially in our accountability system.

01:15:08.487 --> 01:15:17.515
So there is an option under ESSA to have states develop an alternate diploma or alternate diploma pathway.

01:15:17.956 --> 01:15:19.817
And many states have already started to do this.

01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:27.464
And this is really just for the 1%, which is 10% of students with disabilities that have the most significant cognitive disabilities.

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:29.706
They're the ones that take the alternate assessment.

01:15:31.086 --> 01:15:43.931
And so it's not, it's a very specific group of students, but it is a group of students who we hear often become sort of like that piece for superintendents, like what can we do?

01:15:44.051 --> 01:15:54.215
So if we're at that point where we're trying to do improvement and there is no way for us to get them a diploma if they're on this certificate track, it just brings up the question of do we want to take some

01:15:54.815 --> 01:15:59.996
you know, do we want to look at that in the future and is that something the state is interested in?

01:16:00.016 --> 01:16:02.857
So I'm just throwing it out there because it is an option under ESSA.

01:16:02.877 --> 01:16:07.318
Looking at some of these questions over the coming months will be important.

01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:12.539
Do we have a motion to move this very helpful report forward?

01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:17.481
I move approval of the CDE's executive summary.

01:16:17.501 --> 01:16:19.861
Do member Sandoval second?

01:16:19.901 --> 01:16:20.901
Thank you member Navo.

01:16:21.982 --> 01:16:22.902
Any further discussion?

01:16:24.966 --> 01:16:25.967
All in favor say aye.

01:16:25.987 --> 01:16:26.047
Aye.

01:16:26.888 --> 01:16:27.929
Any opposed say nay.

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:29.410
Any abstentions?

01:16:29.811 --> 01:16:31.332
All right the motion passes.

01:16:31.392 --> 01:16:34.355
Thank you so much for the wonderful presentation.

01:16:36.036 --> 01:16:40.801
And so now I'd like to reconvene the board and move to our consent calendars.

01:16:42.002 --> 01:16:45.946
First we'll take up the waiver consent items 1 through 6 and 8 through 12.

01:16:49.709 --> 01:17:03.817
Item number 7 and item 13 were withdrawn by the districts that had originally brought them So we want to start with public comment on any waiver 1 through 6 And a through 12 if there is any no public comment.

01:17:04.277 --> 01:17:07.679
All right Do I have a motion?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:16.123
Thank you second second, all right, thank you very much any discussion

01:17:18.951 --> 01:17:21.193
All right, all those in favor say aye.

01:17:21.873 --> 01:17:21.953
Aye.

01:17:22.073 --> 01:17:22.974
Any opposed, nay.

01:17:24.195 --> 01:17:24.915
Any abstentions?

01:17:25.276 --> 01:17:26.316
All right, motion carries.

01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:32.661
Now we'll take up the regular consent items and those are items six and items 13 through 16.

01:17:33.201 --> 01:17:37.304
And please note that item 12 was withdrawn by CDE yesterday.

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:40.406
So we'll now take up item six and items 13 through 16.

01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:45.190
Are there any public comments on item six and 13 through 16?

01:17:45.230 --> 01:17:45.310
No.

01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:58.361
All right with no public comment ask for a motion on consent for items 6 and 13 through 16 move the consent Thank you very much any discussion

01:18:00.683 --> 01:18:02.524
All right all those in favor say aye.

01:18:03.164 --> 01:18:03.264
Aye.

01:18:03.344 --> 01:18:04.224
Any opposed nay.

01:18:04.964 --> 01:18:05.805
Any abstentions.

01:18:06.545 --> 01:18:07.365
Motion passes.

01:18:08.686 --> 01:18:20.750
Agenda item 17 is for the new school of San Francisco and this is a public hearing to consider the petition to renew the charter currently authorized by the State Board of Education.

01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:32.419
CDE proposes to recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to renew New School of San Francisco, a K-5 charter school, for a five-year term.

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:35.496
effective July 1, 2020 through June 30th, 2025.

01:18:37.637 --> 01:18:41.458
And the item will be presented by Lisa Constancio of the department.

01:18:42.498 --> 01:18:43.339
Good morning, everyone.

01:18:43.359 --> 01:18:46.060
I'm going to echo the Michelle Center.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:50.101
I think people are coming in, so let's let people come in.

01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:56.783
If you need to stretch or grab coffee or something, this, you know, take a minute and we'll let folks get into their seats.

01:18:57.924 --> 01:19:00.985
Just so we will all be attentive at the point where we start.

01:19:02.062 --> 01:19:08.685
But if you get up and leave, you must be back in two minutes.

01:19:08.725 --> 01:19:10.485
No, I'm fine.

01:19:13.626 --> 01:19:15.807
If you need to take a break, go ahead.

01:19:16.427 --> 01:19:17.348
Take a couple of minutes.

01:19:17.368 --> 01:19:20.089
Everybody needs to run to the bathroom.

01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:24.090
Everybody who's already had their two cups of coffee.

01:19:26.271 --> 01:19:26.791
Quick, quick, quick.

01:19:42.382 --> 01:19:44.183
So we'll try to catch up with.

01:19:56.405 --> 01:19:57.666
It's all right, it's okay.

01:20:16.494 --> 01:20:16.576
Oh.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:10.036
Okay so we have a quorum and this item will be presented by Lisa Constanzio of the department.

01:23:10.076 --> 01:23:28.312
Lisa please begin and I want to point out to the board members that in your basket you have two sets of CDE slides for items 17 and 18 and one set of slides from the new school so if you want to follow along in vivid color with your packets you may do so.

01:23:29.814 --> 01:23:30.615
Good morning, everyone.

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:40.519
I wanted to quickly mention that this will be my, in the spirit of Michelle's Center, I started saying this will be my last charter school presentation.

01:23:41.539 --> 01:23:49.503
So we have three charter items today, two that are before you about new school, and then we also have a charter item about the public charter school grant program.

01:23:50.163 --> 01:23:55.505
So, the superintendent yesterday announced that Stephanie Farland is the new charter school division director.

01:23:55.945 --> 01:23:57.425
Her and I are going to tag team today.

01:23:57.525 --> 01:24:02.587
So, she'll be presenting the item on the public charter school grant program.

01:24:02.627 --> 01:24:04.587
So, Stephanie, if you want to stand up for a moment.

01:24:05.668 --> 01:24:06.328
And there's Stephanie.

01:24:08.068 --> 01:24:11.369
And after today, I'll be handing over all charter items to Stephanie.

01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:13.750
So, we'll go ahead and get started.

01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:16.871
So, item number 17 is New School of San Francisco.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.572
It is before you as a renewal petition.

01:24:21.437 --> 01:24:30.101
In terms of the timeline, New School of San Francisco is currently a state board authorized charter school and the charter term ends this June 2019.

01:24:30.841 --> 01:24:46.028
Pursuant to the Ed Code around renewals, any charter school that is currently a state board school has to first go to their authorizing district locally to petition there locally before they can come back before the state board.

01:24:46.909 --> 01:24:58.743
In this case, New School went before San Francisco Unified School District, not only with an item for renewal, but also an item for a material revision, which is the second item we're going to be talking about today.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.868
That material revision is to expand their current charter school.

01:25:02.888 --> 01:25:05.431
We'll talk more about that as we get through the presentation.

01:25:06.192 --> 01:25:12.615
So the petition for renewal and material revision was presented to the San Francisco Unified School District on June 14th, 2019.

01:25:14.256 --> 01:25:22.680
On September 24th, 2019, the governing board denied both the renewal and the material revision by a unanimous vote of six to zero.

01:25:23.281 --> 01:25:29.484
And then on September 30th, CDE received both of the petitions for appeal to the state board.

01:25:31.311 --> 01:25:45.237
The CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to renew New School of San Francisco, a K-5 charter school under the oversight of the State Board, for a five-year term, which would be effective July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2025.

01:25:50.501 --> 01:26:02.988
The new School of San Francisco meets the renewal criteria under Education Code 47607, and they do perform overall at least equal to the comparable schools where the majority of the pupils would otherwise attend.

01:26:03.628 --> 01:26:09.692
The school is also consistent with sound educational practice and is demonstrably likely to implement the program.

01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:22.217
CDE also finds that the petition would be reasonably comprehensive if some additional conditions were actually included as part of this approval.

01:26:22.638 --> 01:26:33.566
So we'll talk about these a little bit more, but we are actually requesting some conditions in the areas of race and ethnic balance and also in admissions to further

01:26:34.747 --> 01:26:42.951
to further add to the concerns we have and address some of the concerns we have as we get into the demographics of the school as it currently is.

01:26:43.252 --> 01:26:49.955
So we'll talk about that a little bit further, but we are recommending that these changes be conditions as part of the approval for this renewal.

01:26:52.056 --> 01:26:55.818
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on December 10th, 2019.

01:26:56.279 --> 01:27:02.482
The Advisory Commission moved staff recommendation to approve the petition to the State Board and the motion was passed unanimously.

01:27:04.562 --> 01:27:06.164
A little bit of background on the school.

01:27:06.224 --> 01:27:10.749
It was approved by the state board on March 12, 2015 for a five-year term.

01:27:11.249 --> 01:27:13.832
And as I mentioned, it will expire on June 30.

01:27:14.933 --> 01:27:15.574
Actually, that should be 2019.

01:27:15.614 --> 01:27:16.916
There's a typo there.

01:27:18.884 --> 01:27:20.626
Oh, I'm sorry, it is 2020, apology.

01:27:21.146 --> 01:27:22.727
I mean, we're in 2020.

01:27:22.867 --> 01:27:25.069
It's the other slide that was incorrect, I apologize.

01:27:25.089 --> 01:27:37.578
And the new school has also submitted a material revision, as I mentioned, to expand from K-5 to a K-8, so we'll be talking about that as the second item for new school.

01:27:37.978 --> 01:27:43.282
And that would begin this school year as well, which, as I mentioned, is presented as a subsequent item.

01:27:45.202 --> 01:27:52.692
The mission for the school that all San Francisco's pupils, regardless of their background, receive an education equal to their extraordinary potential.

01:27:53.213 --> 01:28:02.986
The instructional approach incorporates an inquiry-based model with personalized learning, integrated social-emotional development, and connectedness to the community and the world.

01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:11.956
In terms of their facility, they are currently in a Prop 39 facility with the San Francisco Unified School District.

01:28:12.337 --> 01:28:21.669
They serve 288 pupils in grades K through grade 5, and they also have petitioned the school district for another facility under Prop 39.

01:28:24.662 --> 01:28:33.470
In terms of the renewal criteria, we take a look, the renewal criteria is governed by education codes both 47605 and 47607.

01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:46.983
So specifically, we take a look at whether the school itself has determined that the academic performance is equal to the academic performance of the pupil schools that charter schools would otherwise have been required to attend.

01:28:47.824 --> 01:28:57.477
as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the pupil population that is being served at the charter school.

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:09.644
Also, under Education Code 52052, in terms of alternative measures, some of these areas, as we've talked about before, no longer exist.

01:29:09.724 --> 01:29:20.249
It does allow for API, which hasn't been calculated since 2013-14, and it provides for determining whether a charter is meeting the legislative or programmatic requirements.

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:30.967
In terms of CDE for alternative measures, we use CASP and, in essence, the dashboard as the alternative measure when we take a look at criteria for purposes of renewal.

01:29:33.672 --> 01:29:41.998
In terms of the comparison schools, CDE selected four grade five through grade K through grade five comparison schools.

01:29:42.738 --> 01:29:49.043
And those also are the same schools that the district selected as comparable schools and that new school used as well.

01:29:50.123 --> 01:29:55.147
In 2017-18, that was the first year the students in grade three took the state assessments.

01:29:55.527 --> 01:29:59.390
So we have some dashboard information here for you, but it won't start until the 2017-18 school year.

01:30:01.671 --> 01:30:08.176
and we did assess that the students performed at least equal to the schools that pupils would otherwise be required to attend.

01:30:08.716 --> 01:30:26.289
The next couple of slides are the charts that show the actual CASP scores for new school here at the top and then for the four comparison schools that we used and again the San Francisco Unified School District used as well as new school itself in their comparison.

01:30:29.231 --> 01:30:31.032
And I'll just pause here for a second if there's any

01:30:32.645 --> 01:30:35.467
Okay.

01:30:35.487 --> 01:30:45.236
Also, in terms of demographically similar schools, we did also verify information that New School and San Francisco Unified also used.

01:30:45.536 --> 01:30:58.307
They selected other schools in the district that were demographically more similar, and the school itself did also do better than exceeded in these areas as well, either comparable or better than those schools.

01:31:01.024 --> 01:31:04.425
This next slide is also, we always include this in charter items.

01:31:04.445 --> 01:31:06.886
This is the demographics of the comparable schools.

01:31:07.687 --> 01:31:16.330
And as you can tell, there are some significant distinctions here between the students that are currently being served by the charter and the demographics.

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:18.071
We'll talk about that a little bit further.

01:31:18.131 --> 01:31:24.894
Again, that's just part of some of the conditions we're adding under race and ethnic balance as we get further into the item.

01:31:27.176 --> 01:31:30.860
This chart here is the 2017 new school dashboard indicators.

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:36.045
Again, as I mentioned, this was the first year the third graders took the assessments.

01:31:37.719 --> 01:31:42.240
Then we have 2017, I'm sorry, 2018 dashboard indicators.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.141
And here in chronic absenteeism and suspension rate.

01:31:47.942 --> 01:31:57.624
Again, only the second, until we have two years of data, which is in our next slide here in 2019, is when we can actually see colors in ELA and math.

01:31:58.484 --> 01:32:04.466
So on this slide, the school is blue in chronic absenteeism, blue in suspension rate.

01:32:05.246 --> 01:32:08.048
blue in ELA and blue in math as well.

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:11.749
And then the local indicators have each been met.

01:32:14.391 --> 01:32:26.517
And then for 2019, since we have two years worth of data, we also have here in ELA that they increased their scores by 4.6 points and in math they maintained in essence.

01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:32.813
Okay, a little bit more information now.

01:32:32.853 --> 01:32:41.419
The new school also used the same schools as I mentioned that we used as well in terms of comparable schools.

01:32:41.899 --> 01:32:49.805
What they did add in this chart is their scores in comparison to the district and also overall for California.

01:32:50.225 --> 01:32:56.910
So those are the additions in this chart and also then similarly the demographic chart that they included as well.

01:33:00.003 --> 01:33:07.008
San Francisco Unified, in their review, the staff of San Francisco Unified did recommend approval.

01:33:07.988 --> 01:33:22.118
Academic performance was considered under the Ed Code 47607, which governs comparable schools, and stated that the performance is at least equal to the San Francisco Unified schools that new school pupils would otherwise attend.

01:33:22.658 --> 01:33:31.085
And again, San Francisco Unified used the same schools as New School and CDE, so we didn't include those charts again, just because you already have those available to you.

01:33:33.326 --> 01:33:35.868
Past history under state board authorization.

01:33:37.229 --> 01:33:40.692
They do have a record of educational success as a state board authorized school.

01:33:41.192 --> 01:33:48.198
The program was implemented as described in their petition, and they were in compliance with their MOU, with the state board.

01:33:48.778 --> 01:34:07.306
They did have, under appropriate responses to concerns, they did have some letters of concern from us in terms of teacher credentialing, but those issues were resolved to our satisfaction, so those were all cleared in terms of letters of concern with us as their authorizer.

01:34:09.645 --> 01:34:12.727
In terms of their ability to implement, they are fiscally viable.

01:34:13.527 --> 01:34:22.452
They do have a positive ending fund balance for the next three years and do have larger reserves than we actually require under our MOU, which is 5%.

01:34:26.351 --> 01:34:31.916
In terms of their preliminary budget report, it does, again, have a positive ending fund balance.

01:34:32.577 --> 01:34:36.700
And in terms of their audit, there was no audit findings as well.

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:39.763
So we wanted to pass that information on to you as well.

01:34:42.133 --> 01:34:51.760
So in terms of the charter elements, we do find that four of these elements, two in particular, do not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter elements.

01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.483
So the main two that we're focused on are the racial and ethnic balance and the admission preferences.

01:34:58.624 --> 01:35:12.196
So this slide, it does, in just one chart, show the difference in terms of the racial and ethnic balance and the students being served by the school and what is being served by the district.

01:35:12.697 --> 01:35:19.122
And so the chart does show that there's not a reflective, the students that they're serving are not reflective of the school district.

01:35:21.164 --> 01:35:33.912
So we have had some conversations with the school and one of the conditions that we are asking for as part of this approval is they currently have a community engagement plan that is included as an appendices to their petition.

01:35:34.552 --> 01:35:40.336
We are asking that that community engagement plan actually be included in the petition as part of their contract.

01:35:40.876 --> 01:35:45.719
You have a copy of this as well with you in case you wanted to refer to it.

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.862
But the school itself, they'll talk a little bit more about this in their presentation.

01:35:50.422 --> 01:35:52.944
but they do talk about their recruitment efforts here.

01:35:53.385 --> 01:36:02.113
They talk about how they do want to make free and reduced-price meal a priority as one of their admission preferences, and we'll get into that.

01:36:02.393 --> 01:36:10.460
That is actually something we are recommending as well, and they do talk about how to broaden their communication with the community.

01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:13.983
in terms of even getting into preschools that are in areas.

01:36:14.644 --> 01:36:21.211
And so I'll let them talk a little bit more about that, but we did feel that this was a really important piece that should be included in the petition.

01:36:21.631 --> 01:36:25.215
So we are making that a recommendation as one of the conditions.

01:36:27.997 --> 01:36:42.649
In terms of admission requirements, as I just mentioned, prior to the petition that came before us, the admission preferences were siblings of pupils first, and then the second was pupils eligible for free and reduced-price meals.

01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:46.352
One of the conditions is that we are asking that the first

01:36:47.313 --> 01:36:57.681
The first criteria in terms of when they have their lottery will be that pupils eligible for free and reduced price meals is the first admission requirement to move it to the very top.

01:36:58.221 --> 01:37:08.710
In the hopes that we know that this hopefully will help in terms of having a better population at the school that will meet that of the district.

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:14.294
So that is also one of the conditions that we are asking for, recommending as part of the approval.

01:37:16.314 --> 01:37:28.570
And then we have two elements in terms of employee qualifications and dispute resolutions that are minor to this, but we do have some language that we'd like to be included in both of these charter elements as well.

01:37:30.256 --> 01:37:35.579
and I won't get into these specifically because they are minor, but we do have some language changes we'd like there as well.

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:41.683
So in summary, CDE staff is recommending approval with the conditions we've recommended.

01:37:42.144 --> 01:37:51.850
The petition is consistent with sound educational program and they do perform overall at least equal to the comparable schools where the majority of the pupils would otherwise attend.

01:37:52.630 --> 01:37:54.872
They are demonstrably likely to implement the program.

01:37:54.892 --> 01:38:03.217
They are fiscally viable and overall they have described most of the charter elements as reasonably comprehensive.

01:38:04.438 --> 01:38:05.658
So that's the end of my presentation.

01:38:05.678 --> 01:38:08.380
Are there any questions I can answer at this point?

01:38:12.526 --> 01:38:17.771
Clarified questions because we do want to hear from the petitioners member Burr and then member Navajo.

01:38:19.132 --> 01:38:25.598
So Lisa first, but I just want to start by saying thank you so much for your service relative to charter schools.

01:38:25.678 --> 01:38:26.539
It's been wonderful.

01:38:26.579 --> 01:38:30.562
We're going to miss you, but I know you're moving on to better things and we'll still get to see you.

01:38:32.985 --> 01:38:41.253
During the ACCS meeting, there was a lot of conversation about the issue that you identified, the diversity of the school didn't seem to be reflective of San Francisco Unified.

01:38:41.954 --> 01:38:50.863
And clarify one point that the school asserted that they requested a change during the term of their petition, which would have been a material revision.

01:38:51.543 --> 01:39:05.539
My understanding is though that request never came to the board And I just want to make sure the board understands that because it got a little bit confusing in the public testimony I think the school was under the impression that the department turning them down

01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:19.706
They just had to continue to operate so I think it's important for the board members to know they Recognize this issue early in their operation and we're trying to do something about it But for whatever reason it didn't come to the board.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:22.027
So if you could just clarify that I'd appreciate it.

01:39:22.147 --> 01:39:23.227
Yes, so

01:39:24.608 --> 01:39:28.892
When I started in 2017, I am aware of one request for material revision.

01:39:28.932 --> 01:39:30.334
I know that there were others.

01:39:31.295 --> 01:39:36.840
At that time, when we received those at CDE, we do look at those.

01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:43.207
We work with board staff to determine if, at that time, this is an appropriate material revision to come before the board.

01:39:44.008 --> 01:39:51.695
They only had one year left on their term, so at that time it really wasn't an appropriate time to bring that material revision to the board.

01:39:51.795 --> 01:39:53.317
It wasn't something you ever saw.

01:39:53.797 --> 01:39:59.403
It was handled at the administrative level, and there were also changes to admission.

01:39:59.503 --> 01:40:03.207
The law changed AB 1360 for admission preferences as well.

01:40:03.747 --> 01:40:08.671
So that also was part of our decision as to you only have a year left.

01:40:09.512 --> 01:40:12.534
They did bring that before us to make those changes.

01:40:13.435 --> 01:40:17.097
With only one year left in their term, we wanted them to finish out their term.

01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:28.446
Just want to make sure I understood it because it flew by real quick, but I heard you say the staff for San Francisco Unified recommended approval.

01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:31.132
Correct, but the board denied.

01:40:31.292 --> 01:40:32.594
In a unanimous vote.

01:40:32.654 --> 01:40:32.974
Correct.

01:40:33.334 --> 01:40:38.099
All right, any other clarifying questions?

01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:39.020
Let's move then.

01:40:39.141 --> 01:40:42.864
I'm going to open the public hearing at

01:40:46.034 --> 01:40:46.814
10-11 a.m.

01:40:47.575 --> 01:40:49.236
First we'll hear from the petitioners.

01:40:49.396 --> 01:40:50.936
The petitioners will have 10 minutes.

01:40:51.456 --> 01:40:54.438
Then we'll hear from the district that is opposing the renewal petition.

01:40:54.878 --> 01:40:56.699
They will also have a total of 10 minutes.

01:40:57.259 --> 01:41:05.303
After the presentations from both sides, there will then be an opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each.

01:41:07.403 --> 01:41:10.705
And we'll now take the petitioners.

01:41:20.402 --> 01:41:22.165
Okay.

01:41:22.185 --> 01:41:23.246
Can this be raised a little bit?

01:41:35.996 --> 01:41:50.366
I'll just remind the board that we will not be asking questions of the petitioners as they present at this moment, but we can come back to them or the district in later discussion if we need to.

01:41:57.571 --> 01:41:58.432
Good morning everybody.

01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:00.945
Good morning.

01:42:01.545 --> 01:42:06.670
My name is Sharnice Lazar and I'm the Director of Curriculum Instruction at the New School of San Francisco.

01:42:07.511 --> 01:42:21.905
I've been in education for over 20 years and I left my post at the UCLA Lab School after 10 years when I had the opportunity to help found a public school that centers inquiry and equity, two things that I am deeply passionate about.

01:42:22.285 --> 01:42:25.366
So in the few minutes that we have, I want to talk a little bit about our school.

01:42:25.726 --> 01:42:29.588
I want to talk about our areas of success and discuss our areas of growth.

01:42:30.608 --> 01:42:34.030
I was going to introduce you, play a video, so you could introduce.

01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:37.031
We wanted to bring our entire school community, but that's not possible.

01:42:37.291 --> 01:42:40.272
We had 850 people who wanted to come.

01:42:41.093 --> 01:42:44.554
But we did want to share a video to show you our school.

01:42:44.574 --> 01:42:48.196
I am a member of the new school of San Francisco.

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:51.577
We are curious learners.

01:42:52.285 --> 01:42:55.127
and courageous problem solvers.

01:42:55.948 --> 01:43:04.775
I show respect and kindness to myself, others, and my community.

01:43:05.616 --> 01:43:19.607
I make responsible choices and bring my best self to school, so I can learn, explore, and have fun to most new schools.

01:43:20.745 --> 01:43:29.393
We've created a school that takes together many best practices in education and says all of these things really matter and they matter for all kids.

01:43:29.973 --> 01:43:41.244
So whether that's personalization, social-emotional learning, deeper learning, inquiry as a philosophy that guides our work, posing big questions to kids, we believe that this is imperative for our children.

01:43:45.555 --> 01:43:56.617
I actually think the fundamental thing in the world today is essentially coming from a love-based awareness of other people and the commitment to honestly teach everyone their emotions is amazing to me.

01:43:56.837 --> 01:43:59.837
I don't know of another school where that's part of the curriculum.

01:44:01.818 --> 01:44:11.099
Kids are really encouraged to ask questions and take ownership of their own learning and explore things that they're interested in and make mistakes and be unsure of things and work together.

01:44:11.119 --> 01:44:14.920
I think all of those skills really support the whole child so that they're

01:44:15.393 --> 01:44:18.816
not just learning a skill in math or a skill in science, but it's all connected.

01:44:19.236 --> 01:44:23.239
And so the way that New School structures the learning is really empowering for kids.

01:44:25.300 --> 01:44:27.322
Children don't come to us as empty vessels.

01:44:27.462 --> 01:44:29.023
They have things to contribute.

01:44:29.403 --> 01:44:34.227
And as a teacher, it's my job to pull those out and to tap into those.

01:44:34.287 --> 01:44:36.629
And those are lifelong skills.

01:44:37.329 --> 01:44:39.911
I believe inquiry teaches kids how to think.

01:44:40.515 --> 01:44:54.945
and thinking skills are the skills that will make kids successful, that narrows an opportunity gap.

01:44:55.725 --> 01:45:01.909
We are purposely trying to find different types of people to put into this building because that's what the world is.

01:45:02.269 --> 01:45:09.214
And we want these different types of people, smalls and talls, to really tackle and answer some really big questions.

01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:17.383
You walk into this building and you walk into every classroom and there's a sense of love and joy.

01:45:17.683 --> 01:45:31.230
And that feels so valuable to know your child is going somewhere every day where the adults and the kids around him are happy and are valuing our kids and loving our kids.

01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:32.970
That is so special.

01:45:33.611 --> 01:45:34.311
It's so special.

01:45:40.234 --> 01:45:40.654
So those

01:45:42.139 --> 01:45:44.000
Is this back on?

01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.301
That's some of our community.

01:45:45.801 --> 01:45:49.703
I want to talk just a little bit about what our school is founded on.

01:45:49.943 --> 01:45:53.145
It's three principles, equity, inquiry, and personalization.

01:45:53.646 --> 01:45:55.487
For us, equity is a daily practice.

01:45:55.807 --> 01:46:03.011
Equity is the curriculum that explores big questions like, what is the master narrative, and why does it include all perspectives?

01:46:03.531 --> 01:46:07.333
Or questions like, why do we say black lives matter and not all lives matter?

01:46:07.733 --> 01:46:09.775
And we start these conversations with five-year-olds.

01:46:10.595 --> 01:46:18.464
Equity is the restorative practices that we teach our third graders about intention versus impact and how entitlement of some oppresses others.

01:46:19.205 --> 01:46:31.498
Equity is our SEL program that's integrated into every part of our day, specifically focused on students who have experienced trauma to name, understand, and process those big emotions of abandonment, loss, and grief.

01:46:32.259 --> 01:46:42.261
Equity is filling our libraries with the books like Her Right Foot, a story told from the perspective of the Statue of Liberty, and How We Embrace the Immigrant Story with Compassion and Empathy.

01:46:43.081 --> 01:46:45.141
Inquiry is our teaching and learning philosophy.

01:46:45.621 --> 01:46:52.983
It's a philosophy that asks our first graders to elevate their sound unit in science and turn it into a soundtrack of love and joy.

01:46:53.723 --> 01:47:00.804
Or a second grade unit that studies the earth movements to help students spark their own social movements about animals and humans.

01:47:01.644 --> 01:47:04.767
Personalized learning undergirds all that we do.

01:47:05.667 --> 01:47:10.151
It's a multi-tiered system that includes community targeted and individualized supports.

01:47:10.731 --> 01:47:15.095
It's therapy facilitated by our full-time counselor or weekly social groups.

01:47:15.615 --> 01:47:20.600
It's setting 2,240 personalized goals for our students.

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.564
It's providing a before and after school academic intervention we lovingly call Brain Gym.

01:47:26.821 --> 01:47:28.904
It's an administrator picking up a student at home.

01:47:29.424 --> 01:47:32.628
It's coordinating gift drives for our students who are in foster care.

01:47:32.968 --> 01:47:40.577
It's providing camp during breaks for working families and teachers doing visits to all 288 students.

01:47:41.098 --> 01:47:43.280
For us, personalization is personal.

01:47:44.421 --> 01:47:45.822
All of this doesn't just happen.

01:47:45.982 --> 01:47:48.163
We are intentional about everything that we do.

01:47:48.604 --> 01:47:51.966
This begins with hiring exceptionally and highly qualified educators.

01:47:52.426 --> 01:47:59.150
It's a strong co-teaching model, which includes a resident teacher program that allows beginning teachers to build their instructional toolboxes.

01:47:59.530 --> 01:48:04.013
And it's our team participating in over 300 hours of professional development a year.

01:48:04.953 --> 01:48:06.334
And we don't do this work alone.

01:48:06.774 --> 01:48:10.475
We have some incredible partners up and down the state that help us.

01:48:10.955 --> 01:48:15.577
These friends of New School are like-minded and they're committed to supporting our students.

01:48:16.257 --> 01:48:22.279
In turn, we're doing what we're asking our students to do and that's share our learning.

01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:29.061
We're slowly building a laboratory school model which allows us to learn from others and alongside others.

01:48:29.481 --> 01:48:40.130
Over the past few years, we've had hundreds of visitors from all over the world, we've facilitated citywide learning walks, and we're currently providing professional development to several other area schools.

01:48:42.270 --> 01:48:47.954
So Sharnice just spoke about our intent and how intentional we are about what we do.

01:48:47.974 --> 01:48:54.339
I'm going to talk a little bit about our impact, some of which has already been presented by the staff, so I'll move through it quickly.

01:48:54.619 --> 01:48:55.419
My name is Ryan Chapman.

01:48:55.459 --> 01:48:58.542
I'm a co-founder and co-head of school at the New School of San Francisco.

01:48:59.602 --> 01:49:05.847
It's good to see many of you who are here in our original authorization, and it's a pleasure to meet some who are new.

01:49:07.742 --> 01:49:12.963
We've gone through our dashboard results, which we are proud of and work hard to achieve.

01:49:15.144 --> 01:49:24.887
Our outcomes are exceeding both the city and state, both in ELA and in numeracy, and we're seeing important increases year on year in both English language arts and in math.

01:49:26.348 --> 01:49:41.738
Our academic success is all built on a culture and climate, a focus on culture and climate, which we actually look at and spend enormous amounts of time and resources from weeks before the school doors open and every minute of the day from 745 in the morning until six o'clock at night.

01:49:42.078 --> 01:49:51.504
And this has led to a high average daily attendance, low chronic absenteeism, zero expulsions in five years, one suspension in five years,

01:49:52.305 --> 01:49:57.353
100% participation in family conferences, and families universally feeling welcomed at the school.

01:50:00.663 --> 01:50:09.931
We also, as Sharnice mentioned, equity for us is not something you kind of check off having done through a PD, but something you practice day in and day out.

01:50:10.491 --> 01:50:15.456
We start by devoting 30 plus hours to diversity, equity, and inclusion PD for all of our staff.

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:19.239
And it's something that we then look at across our communities.

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:23.422
We have three student-led expositions per year with our students and families.

01:50:23.602 --> 01:50:26.725
We have a home and school council, which is designed to engage across difference.

01:50:27.145 --> 01:50:28.927
And we have interpretation and translation

01:50:29.941 --> 01:50:31.382
and all events and communications.

01:50:32.863 --> 01:50:35.306
This has led to overwhelming demand for our school.

01:50:36.007 --> 01:50:41.953
Last year we had 714 families apply, 114 of which were FRPM eligible.

01:50:42.393 --> 01:50:45.476
We have a 71% accept rate across the school.

01:50:45.977 --> 01:50:49.580
It's 90% for those families who qualify for free and reduced price meals.

01:50:50.701 --> 01:50:51.902
And our waitlist is long.

01:50:52.322 --> 01:50:56.025
We have on our waitlist currently 109 families who are FRP ineligible.

01:50:56.726 --> 01:51:00.328
And we're receiving applications from across the city from every corner.

01:51:01.329 --> 01:51:05.672
In total, we received 2,341 applications in our five recruitment cycles.

01:51:05.712 --> 01:51:11.777
And you'll see year on year, we're seeing just extraordinary demand and increase in those applications.

01:51:13.091 --> 01:51:15.734
We have a lot to celebrate, but we know we still have places to grow.

01:51:16.714 --> 01:51:20.458
Here are our outcomes for our students by subgroups.

01:51:20.778 --> 01:51:24.801
And as you see, we are exceeding the district and the state with the exception of two measures.

01:51:25.222 --> 01:51:30.246
And that's for our English language learners and our economically disadvantaged students, particularly in math.

01:51:30.726 --> 01:51:33.048
And so we are doing lots to address that.

01:51:33.169 --> 01:51:34.650
We are laser-focused on numeracy.

01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:36.392
That's become our content focus.

01:51:36.712 --> 01:51:40.235
We've added MAP to our already kind of robust suite of assessments.

01:51:40.535 --> 01:51:43.258
We're doing that intervention that we call Brain Gym.

01:51:43.738 --> 01:51:51.586
And we've also engaged our ELAC community to really support these English language learners, particularly, again, in concepts related to numeracy.

01:51:52.904 --> 01:52:00.671
Another area of focus for our growth and a priority is the increase in access to families who are eligible for free, no-price meals.

01:52:00.951 --> 01:52:11.179
We cannot emphasize this enough, that one, those conditions that were set out by the CDC staff, we willingly accept and have been trying to put into place for the last three years.

01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:11.700
Thank you.

01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:15.910
All right, thank you very much.

01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:24.273
I think at this point we want to hear from the district and then we'll have any public comment and then we'll come back if we have other questions for you.

01:52:24.473 --> 01:52:24.834
Thank you.

01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.701
Good morning to ongoing and new board members.

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:42.701
My name is Michael Davis.

01:52:42.721 --> 01:52:46.923
I'm the director for charter schools for San Francisco Unified School District.

01:52:47.563 --> 01:52:49.843
And I'm here with one of our board members.

01:52:49.903 --> 01:52:55.625
This is Allison Collins, one of the commissioners of the San Francisco Unified School Board.

01:52:57.222 --> 01:53:17.193
So you've already heard the presentation from the staff and as you know the staff of the San Francisco Unified School District recommended renewal of new school for a five-year period at grades K through 5 which they have are currently operating and we were

01:53:18.974 --> 01:53:27.286
tasked with reviewing the operations over the last four years of that school, even though it was not authorized by our district.

01:53:28.408 --> 01:53:34.797
We found using the criteria outlined in the law that they did meet

01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:46.494
the requirement for renewal under the most important factor which was increases in academic achievement across the school and for all significant subgroups.

01:53:47.755 --> 01:53:59.920
We did note that although the school is or has a mission statement that includes design for diversity by design that

01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:14.308
the school had demonstrably failed in being diverse, particularly in the areas of socioeconomic disadvantaged students, where the district is currently at about 54% and they are at about 11.5%.

01:54:14.388 --> 01:54:19.251
And in SFUSD, the white student population is about 14% and new school is at 52 or 53.

01:54:27.596 --> 01:54:33.642
So, we made the findings for renewal K-5 only and presented that to the board.

01:54:37.165 --> 01:54:37.845
Okay, I can speak.

01:54:38.305 --> 01:54:39.345
My name's Allison Collins.

01:54:39.385 --> 01:54:40.806
I'm a commissioner on the Board of Education.

01:54:41.306 --> 01:54:43.506
I joined this past January.

01:54:44.006 --> 01:54:47.067
Previous to that, I was an educator at the high school level.

01:54:47.527 --> 01:55:03.250
I have worked in charter schools at the charter level, in charter management organizations, centrally, and then I came back to the district when my daughters entered the district, and I became a parent leader because I wanted to help families understand

01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:08.372
how they can best advocate for quality public schools for all young people.

01:55:09.032 --> 01:55:16.775
Because I've seen the ways that at the high school level, some of our systems and structures prevent students from accessing higher education.

01:55:17.915 --> 01:55:27.379
And so I am also an active member of the African American Parent Advisory Council, and over the years have advocated for our schools in getting resources from the district.

01:55:27.799 --> 01:55:34.522
I decided to join the board last year because I wanted to, I believe that policy matters, right?

01:55:34.662 --> 01:55:45.146
And so you can advocate on a local level, but policies are actually the ways that we, and budgets, are the ways that we actualize our values.

01:55:45.726 --> 01:55:56.714
And what I have seen in San Francisco over the 20 years that I've been there is, on the one hand, I think San Francisco Unified has made me proud as both an educator and a parent.

01:55:57.014 --> 01:55:59.976
We've increased our investment in wellness in our district.

01:56:01.477 --> 01:56:03.058
All schools have social workers.

01:56:03.478 --> 01:56:04.839
All schools have librarians.

01:56:05.159 --> 01:56:09.843
This goes above and beyond our budget because board members have worked with

01:56:10.743 --> 01:56:18.167
labor and other organizations to put ballot measures on the ballot for us to be able to supplement services that we know our budget does not provide for.

01:56:19.688 --> 01:56:30.994
And at the high school level we have student services, we have, you know, a lot of the services that you're seeing the new school provides, we provide those services as well.

01:56:31.074 --> 01:56:39.038
And I can speak as a parent, I mean my daughter's just entered ninth grade this year, we entered a predominantly low-income school in Chinatown

01:56:39.618 --> 01:56:46.584
80 percent of those students were Chinese, 60 percent were English learners, 80 percent were free and reduced lunch.

01:56:46.944 --> 01:57:02.496
And I can say that it was an amazing experience for both me and my daughters because the instruction was exceptional, but also it was an opportunity for them and us to build community with folks that normally I would have been segregated from.

01:57:03.017 --> 01:57:07.160
And I'm very, very thankful that I was able to be in a community where I could learn from

01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:10.181
other parents and other immigrants.

01:57:10.641 --> 01:57:15.222
I have friends who live in public housing about their experiences in our system.

01:57:15.843 --> 01:57:28.146
And so that is why it's really, really important to me that we create a system that actually supports the needs of our most needy students.

01:57:28.626 --> 01:57:36.309
And what's been frustrating for me on the board is to see that our system, as we're expanding our investments,

01:57:37.369 --> 01:57:40.130
in programs that meet the needs of our neediest students.

01:57:41.731 --> 01:57:55.136
Charter expansion in our district and just the existence of charter schools is impeding our ability as an organization to be strategic and intentional in really resourcing students that are of highest need.

01:57:56.016 --> 01:58:02.979
And so to be specific about the new school, we as a district have approved other charter schools.

01:58:03.079 --> 01:58:11.863
And those charter schools, the ones that really stand out, where we are consistently supportive, are Five Keys and Life Learning Academy.

01:58:12.263 --> 01:58:16.285
Those are charters that have actually met the needs of students that we have not been able to meet.

01:58:16.405 --> 01:58:18.506
And we're okay in admitting that.

01:58:19.306 --> 01:58:26.170
Five Keys supports students that are incarcerated in our juvenile justice system and Life Learning Academy.

01:58:26.590 --> 01:58:29.972
They've actually built housing for students that are facing housing insecurity.

01:58:30.312 --> 01:58:34.355
We aren't capable of doing that and we're very glad that there are partners in that work.

01:58:35.695 --> 01:58:51.263
But where I am concerned is when there are charter organizations that take space in our facilities and they end up displacing both students and also programming in our district that are meant to meet the needs of our most needy students.

01:58:51.283 --> 01:59:01.589
So to be specific, I came up here last year as a parent organizer because there was a charter that wanted to take space and we had to co-locate them based on Prop 39

01:59:02.389 --> 01:59:09.554
which is a policy and due to that policy we had to remove services from a school for classroom space.

01:59:10.075 --> 01:59:23.104
And so when you look at a school like the new school that is basically a predominantly white and affluent school, it is housed in a facility that is serving predominantly refugee children.

01:59:23.465 --> 01:59:25.266
The international school is located there.

01:59:25.686 --> 01:59:29.608
and we are not able to expand services there because the new school is there.

01:59:30.028 --> 01:59:37.491
If we want to expand, then they would have to move and they would displace another, you know, program or another population.

01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:46.315
And we don't see, you know, charters like the new school expanding into schools of ours that are highly affluent.

01:59:46.595 --> 01:59:53.958
We see them expanding into schools that are low-income and are the ones that are actually doing the most work in our system.

01:59:54.498 --> 02:00:03.182
So for that reason, as a unanimous board, we all unanimously denied their charter application.

02:00:03.822 --> 02:00:11.605
And I think the results show that they are doing as well as we are with all the resources that they have.

02:00:12.025 --> 02:00:13.326
I am not surprised about that.

02:00:13.966 --> 02:00:18.731
It's very easy to teach white affluent students that have this amount of support.

02:00:19.031 --> 02:00:21.513
It's not surprising to me that they have a lot of parent involvement.

02:00:21.893 --> 02:00:27.238
That is evident in many of our schools in our district that serve predominantly white and affluent students.

02:00:27.658 --> 02:00:30.901
So that is not a criteria for me about approving a charter.

02:00:31.162 --> 02:00:36.366
For me, a charter is about thinking differently, thinking outside of the box, and really reaching out and

02:00:37.407 --> 02:00:41.768
and working with students in ways that we are not traditionally able to do.

02:00:42.128 --> 02:00:43.529
And I am in full support of that.

02:00:43.909 --> 02:00:57.453
But otherwise, we all need to look to work together and focus our needs and our resources, both facilities, staffing and money in supporting students that are the most needy students.

02:00:57.753 --> 02:00:59.374
And they are not evident in this school.

02:00:59.774 --> 02:01:07.036
So I just wanted to provide framework and background and appreciate the opportunity and the privilege to be able to speak today.

02:01:11.871 --> 02:01:14.513
I think at this point we want to take public comment.

02:01:16.695 --> 02:01:19.437
Would the following people please line up at the podium.

02:01:36.454 --> 02:01:40.837
And please state your name and affiliation for the record as you proceed.

02:01:42.418 --> 02:01:46.800
Good morning, my name is Michael Juba and I represent the California Teachers Association.

02:01:47.701 --> 02:01:57.226
CTA is opposed to both the renewal of and the request for the material revision of the new school of San Francisco in agenda items 17 and 18.

02:01:58.507 --> 02:02:01.109
And we oppose these items for the following two main reasons.

02:02:01.989 --> 02:02:10.758
First, the new school does not serve a student population that is reflective of the racial and ethnic balance of San Francisco Unified School District as a whole.

02:02:11.679 --> 02:02:22.490
Not only has the new school served the population that is not reflective of the Unified School District's demographics, but they've also become even less diverse each year of their existence.

02:02:23.450 --> 02:02:42.368
And two, the new school underserves students who are homeless, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and have a disability, demonstrating that it is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in this petition because it does not serve all students.

02:02:42.829 --> 02:02:45.211
And for these reasons, we oppose this charter removal.

02:02:45.632 --> 02:02:45.892
Thank you.

02:02:54.309 --> 02:02:56.311
Good morning, Madam Chair and members.

02:02:56.751 --> 02:02:57.772
My name is Art Agnos.

02:02:57.852 --> 02:03:07.581
I'm the former mayor of San Francisco, and the last time I was here asking for help was in 1989 after a terrible earthquake when I asked the governor and the legislature for a billion dollars.

02:03:08.362 --> 02:03:10.844
I'm not going to ask you for that today, but I am going to

02:03:12.023 --> 02:03:24.332
I am going to ask that you approve the new school of San Francisco's request to become a K-8 and add a floor to their admissions lottery for free and reduced price meals eligible families.

02:03:26.093 --> 02:03:36.801
About ten years ago, I worked with young parents in my neighborhood on Potrero Hill in San Francisco, the fastest growing family area in San Francisco, to save Daniel Webster

02:03:37.461 --> 02:03:59.742
public elementary school a K through 5 school that was going to be closed by the same School district that you heard about because of low attendance even though it was the fastest growing family neighborhood in all of San Francisco we saved that working with a bunch of mothers and Turned it around Someone say something time

02:04:01.724 --> 02:04:02.365
Is my time up?

02:04:02.585 --> 02:04:02.845
Yes.

02:04:03.265 --> 02:04:09.331
You know, in San Francisco, we have a tradition where the former mayor gets an extra minute.

02:04:10.492 --> 02:04:11.373
That doesn't work here.

02:04:11.393 --> 02:04:11.993
Bill time.

02:04:12.013 --> 02:04:12.714
That doesn't work.

02:04:13.114 --> 02:04:15.536
Well, look, this is a fabulous school.

02:04:15.737 --> 02:04:16.858
It does a great job.

02:04:17.238 --> 02:04:23.744
They're asking for your help to increase the conditions and improve on the conditions that you've outlined for them to

02:04:26.504 --> 02:04:31.728
to accomplish and I respectfully ask you to follow the CDE's recommendations.

02:04:31.788 --> 02:04:32.088
Thank you.

02:04:55.488 --> 02:04:55.929
Just say hi.

02:05:00.936 --> 02:05:02.457
Good morning State Board.

02:05:02.837 --> 02:05:05.819
I'm Ethan Chastain and I am a third grader.

02:05:06.340 --> 02:05:10.062
I am multiracial and bilingual in Spanish.

02:05:10.662 --> 02:05:13.644
This is my first year at New School and I love it.

02:05:14.165 --> 02:05:18.548
Last year my teacher used to say I was a wiggle worm and I wasn't very challenged.

02:05:19.088 --> 02:05:25.712
Being at New School has helped me grow as a person because everyone has individual learning plans there.

02:05:27.515 --> 02:05:32.021
My teachers have helped me to learn to take my time with great feedback.

02:05:32.943 --> 02:05:37.109
I have three great teachers who always teach us that mistakes are marvelous.

02:05:37.810 --> 02:05:42.297
The day before our expo night, I was making and solving my number story.

02:05:42.737 --> 02:05:46.281
I used the standard algorithm strategy but added it backwards.

02:05:46.722 --> 02:05:47.122
Then Ms.

02:05:47.142 --> 02:05:48.003
Chloe checked it.

02:05:48.283 --> 02:05:50.866
She asked me a question to show me how to correct it.

02:05:51.207 --> 02:05:53.709
She helped me turn a mistake into a marvelous mistake.

02:05:54.130 --> 02:05:55.491
They do that every day.

02:05:56.032 --> 02:06:02.759
State Board members, please say yes to New School.

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:04.101
Thank you for listening.

02:06:11.994 --> 02:06:16.435
Don't start my time now, because I'm doing this.

02:06:16.455 --> 02:06:17.515
Hi, thank you for listening.

02:06:17.815 --> 02:06:18.975
My name is Layla Mominee.

02:06:20.056 --> 02:06:25.257
My husband and I are educators with years of experience spanning both public and private schools.

02:06:25.817 --> 02:06:30.018
We are also new school parents to an amazing fourth grader named Zadie, who's behind me.

02:06:31.238 --> 02:06:40.020
The school's approach to education, referred to as inquiry for all, and the school's spirit of hands on and minds on, is valuable and worth preserving.

02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:53.704
While standard public schools may contain silos of individual teachers who are passionate about project-based learning and curriculum that responds and adapts to student interest, what new school offers is cohesiveness.

02:06:54.164 --> 02:06:57.965
The entire school is rooted in these principles and it is magical.

02:06:59.105 --> 02:07:06.748
I want you to know that the innate creativity and critical thinking skills of children are valued, encouraged, and further developed at New School.

02:07:07.308 --> 02:07:14.631
This enables teaching and learning to be accessible, joyful, and relevant for both traditional and non-traditional learners.

02:07:15.192 --> 02:07:21.974
I've spent my career in special education, so when I say non-traditional learners, I'm being very honest about that.

02:07:22.074 --> 02:07:27.817
If you understand anything about New School, please know that it is an exciting, humane, and inclusive place to learn and grow.

02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:28.517
Thank you.

02:07:43.328 --> 02:07:43.428
Yeah.

02:07:44.609 --> 02:07:45.349
Good morning.

02:07:45.449 --> 02:07:46.690
How are you doing today.

02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:50.932
My name is Aaliyah and I'm in third grade at New School.

02:07:51.632 --> 02:07:53.913
Before I came here I did not like school.

02:07:54.493 --> 02:07:55.094
Now I do.

02:07:55.874 --> 02:07:58.535
New School is a warm and welcoming school.

02:07:59.736 --> 02:08:03.658
The school is nice in a lot of ways and so are the students.

02:08:04.478 --> 02:08:11.041
All the teachers try to get you into your comfort zone and they challenge you to do your best every day.

02:08:12.216 --> 02:08:18.661
I would love to continue to go to new school with my cousin and still have my new friends with me.

02:08:19.722 --> 02:08:24.666
I want new school to go on to middle school so I can grow here for years.

02:08:25.067 --> 02:08:26.668
Please vote yes for new school.

02:08:26.748 --> 02:08:27.289
Thank you.

02:08:40.595 --> 02:08:41.916
Hello, my name is Surya.

02:08:42.036 --> 02:08:43.756
Thank you for letting me speak here today.

02:08:44.236 --> 02:08:46.937
One thing I'm going to talk about is what I love about New School.

02:08:47.337 --> 02:08:49.798
Something I love about my school is we have inquiry.

02:08:50.219 --> 02:08:55.040
Inquiry is a subject where we get to explore and investigate different topics that we get to choose from.

02:08:55.541 --> 02:08:58.201
It might be in groups, pairs, or by ourselves.

02:08:58.682 --> 02:09:02.443
One guide that helps us prepare for our exposition is our inquiry process.

02:09:02.743 --> 02:09:05.764
That process is to plan, draft, create, redesign, and reflect.

02:09:06.164 --> 02:09:07.525
And then you are ready for Expo.

02:09:07.785 --> 02:09:10.246
This process might also go for most other subjects.

02:09:10.726 --> 02:09:13.687
Another thing I would like to talk about is the power of yet.

02:09:14.047 --> 02:09:16.807
This is something we use so no one feels like they can't do something.

02:09:17.187 --> 02:09:21.348
For example, I was doing a math sheet and I didn't know the answer for a multiplication problem.

02:09:21.708 --> 02:09:24.709
I put on the paper, I don't know this yet, and the next year I learned it.

02:09:25.789 --> 02:09:28.309
The last thing I want to talk about is my favorite subject this year.

02:09:28.369 --> 02:09:29.229
For me, it is writing.

02:09:29.349 --> 02:09:34.730
I have loved what we learned about realistic fiction, but every year my favorite subject will change depending on how much I love it.

02:09:35.671 --> 02:09:36.471
Thank you for listening.

02:09:36.551 --> 02:09:37.371
Please vote for New School.

02:09:41.451 --> 02:09:43.165
I'm gonna have to move this up just a little bit.

02:09:49.616 --> 02:09:50.097
Good morning.

02:09:50.917 --> 02:09:56.160
My name is Cristina Canamara and I am reading a testimony on behalf of Gregory Peters.

02:09:56.900 --> 02:10:14.410
My name is Gregory Peters and I am the executive director of the San Francisco coalition of essential small schools, a nonprofit whose mission is to interrupt, transform current and systemic educational inequities to ensure all students have access to personalized, equitable and high-performing schools that believe and demonstrate each student can, should and will succeed.

02:10:15.190 --> 02:10:28.539
Our organization has been in partnership with New School for the past two years and in that short time they have demonstrated the commitment, will, skill and the courage to engage their staff in the transformative work necessary to address the diverse needs of San Francisco students and families.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:42.188
In response to the school's goal to have and serve a more diverse community, our partnership has been forged out of an honest and integrity based commitment to do the adult and system change work necessary to best support the diverse student body they desire to have.

02:10:43.209 --> 02:10:44.511
Equity work is not easy.

02:10:44.911 --> 02:10:54.762
New school has demonstrated a commitment to the long haul as is evidenced by the way they have shifted their discourse, inquiry, collaboration and improvement efforts to focus on traditionally least served students.

02:10:55.543 --> 02:11:02.371
While the work of transformation is constant in continuance, my confidence in the school's efforts to date lead me to strongly recommend their charter to be approved.

02:11:02.391 --> 02:11:02.731
Thank you.

02:11:10.458 --> 02:11:10.898
Good morning.

02:11:11.559 --> 02:11:15.283
My name is Terry Lee and I'm here today with my son, Dean, who is a first grader.

02:11:15.923 --> 02:11:22.209
We are a family that stands with our community and we stand before you today asking for your approval to reauthorize our school.

02:11:22.890 --> 02:11:28.976
My son was primarily raised by my parents while I worked and he had little to no social interaction with other children leading up to preschool.

02:11:29.577 --> 02:11:31.899
While at preschool, he was a shy introvert.

02:11:32.359 --> 02:11:39.563
On his third birthday, his teacher sent me a video with his friends and teacher singing him happy birthday the entire time Dean was looking down almost in tears.

02:11:40.144 --> 02:11:41.164
He didn't like the spotlight.

02:11:41.665 --> 02:11:49.890
Fast forward to kindergarten, he has blossomed into a confident extrovert who is able to stand up in front of the entire student body and lead them in their school pledge.

02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:53.172
He wouldn't be who he is today without the impact of this community.

02:11:53.692 --> 02:11:59.016
While on the outside, we may appear to be a minority, but we have always felt at home at New School.

02:11:59.696 --> 02:12:06.420
The balance of the individualized learning plans and social-emotional learning have made a lasting impact on how Dean learns and carries himself.

02:12:06.941 --> 02:12:10.283
He has self-declared his most favorite part of his day is going to school.

02:12:10.923 --> 02:12:19.589
This love has transcended to his four-year-old sister, Lauren, who proudly puts on her very own New School t-shirt despite being two years away from being able to attend.

02:12:20.509 --> 02:12:25.974
New school magic is real, and I hope with your approval, both my children will be able to experience the magic this school brings.

02:12:26.174 --> 02:12:26.574
Thank you.

02:12:27.375 --> 02:12:29.436
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

02:12:29.596 --> 02:12:43.167
Belen Enriquez, Bita Nazarian, Misool Rao, Nate Malav, Eric Premack, Luis Nevoa, Maria Breaux, Ruth Weiner, Penelope Wayland-Daga, Patience Yee, Enrica Thomas.

02:12:53.866 --> 02:13:00.287
Hi SBE, my name is Belen Enriquez, I am a student at New School of San Francisco.

02:13:00.947 --> 02:13:02.828
I love New School for many reasons.

02:13:02.968 --> 02:13:07.308
One of those reasons is because of my teachers, they support me in many ways.

02:13:07.828 --> 02:13:10.989
I love that they teach us how special we are in our own way.

02:13:11.549 --> 02:13:14.090
I have a 10-year-old brother, his name is Roberto.

02:13:14.590 --> 02:13:16.630
I love seeing him at recess and lunch.

02:13:17.090 --> 02:13:21.631
That is very important to me since we get to spend some time together.

02:13:22.171 --> 02:13:32.356
This is why it is very important to me that new school is approved and expands to middle school so we can continue growing together with the support of our amazing teachers.

02:13:32.796 --> 02:13:33.757
Thank you for listening.

02:13:42.089 --> 02:13:42.790
Good morning, everybody.

02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:46.533
My name is Luis Novoa, and my daughter's Maya is currently a fourth grader at New School.

02:13:46.933 --> 02:13:50.656
I'm here to ask you today for the support for the renewal from K-5 charter.

02:13:51.157 --> 02:13:57.782
It's unfortunate that the San Francisco Public Board of Education didn't support them in this, but I'm glad that we have the opportunity to appeal in front of you.

02:13:58.243 --> 02:14:03.927
I am personally a graduate of San Francisco Unified School District, and I also am a current teacher at San Francisco Unified School Teacher.

02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:08.272
I ask that we focus on New School's approach to student learning.

02:14:08.633 --> 02:14:12.838
New School has created an environment that is responsive to many different learning styles kids have.

02:14:13.158 --> 02:14:20.026
This learning environment has helped my daughter and many other students to find their voices and become advocates and active participants in their own education.

02:14:20.527 --> 02:14:23.130
Some teaching practices I've witnessed at New School, I've tried to

02:14:23.570 --> 02:14:26.453
bring back to my own classroom to also engage with my students.

02:14:27.334 --> 02:14:34.502
I ask that you all support New School's request for a renewal so that they may continue to inspire students to become courageous and creative in their own learning.

02:14:34.702 --> 02:14:35.263
Thank you very much.

02:14:42.907 --> 02:14:50.195
Hi everybody, my name is Bita Nazarian, my daughter Saia is a second grader and my son Ezra is a fourth grader.

02:14:50.215 --> 02:15:01.748
I've spent 18 years working as a public middle school teacher and administrator, working the entire time to support low income students of color through needed school reforms.

02:15:02.649 --> 02:15:05.711
The process for choosing a school for my children was fraught.

02:15:06.392 --> 02:15:17.039
I deeply believed in the values and methods Emily and Ryan envisioned, but also questioned the charter school system and felt torn due to my personal investment in SFUSD.

02:15:18.140 --> 02:15:20.942
Ultimately, I chose New School and couldn't be happier.

02:15:21.622 --> 02:15:27.887
Ezra and Sire are getting a high quality, joyful education that every single child deserves.

02:15:28.797 --> 02:15:34.922
My views on charters have also changed as I see the innovation that is possible in the alternative system.

02:15:35.903 --> 02:15:38.325
Now I serve as new school's board chair.

02:15:39.165 --> 02:15:42.868
We all agree that we should increase the diversity of our school.

02:15:43.389 --> 02:15:49.193
What we need is a material revision that allows us to do so and approval of our expansion.

02:15:49.454 --> 02:15:49.814
Thank you.

02:16:10.401 --> 02:16:12.924
Hi, my name is Mathur and I'm in second grade.

02:16:13.344 --> 02:16:15.327
I think you should reauthorize new school books.

02:16:15.407 --> 02:16:16.869
I like the unique way they teach.

02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:25.621
That way it's just small questions first and then I add on additional small questions to the first and put it all together to answer a big question.

02:16:27.923 --> 02:16:30.745
I like this approach because it makes learning fun.

02:16:31.145 --> 02:16:35.407
In exploration, we learned about flowers and pollinators, and that bees were dying.

02:16:35.808 --> 02:16:40.610
Next, in expression, we used all of that knowledge to figure out, how do we save the bees?

02:16:41.071 --> 02:16:46.574
Some kids thought we should build a robotic PI to take over the bee population of our fountain.

02:16:46.974 --> 02:16:50.656
And others thought we should send letters, videos, to important people.

02:16:51.016 --> 02:16:55.419
Since there were so many ideas, our teachers split us up into four groups with different missions.

02:16:55.979 --> 02:16:59.801
My group created a model robotic beehive to enhance the bees' lives.

02:17:00.761 --> 02:17:07.124
Exposition night is when you share with your parents and others what you learned in that hour.

02:17:07.445 --> 02:17:09.986
I was super excited to show them our beehive.

02:17:10.546 --> 02:17:12.027
Please reauthorize new school.

02:17:12.647 --> 02:17:15.148
I really like the school and the way they teach.

02:17:15.348 --> 02:17:15.809
Thank you.

02:17:15.829 --> 02:17:22.812
Good morning.

02:17:23.766 --> 02:17:28.128
My name is Nate Malath, and I've been teaching and training educators across the country for almost 10 years.

02:17:29.368 --> 02:17:38.572
For years, I struggled to find a way to balance my desire for creative, innovative teaching with my passion for serving students and families challenged by our country's systemic inequities.

02:17:39.332 --> 02:17:46.435
In 2017, I finally found a school that provides that space, and I've had the privilege of teaching third grade at the New School of San Francisco for the last three years.

02:17:47.576 --> 02:17:47.976
At New School,

02:17:48.652 --> 02:17:55.414
I spend hours in personalized professional training, developing curriculum, pedagogy, and leadership skills at the cutting edge of cultural responsiveness.

02:17:56.235 --> 02:18:00.796
It's humbling, challenging, and inspiring, and it's also a typical Wednesday afternoon for us.

02:18:02.017 --> 02:18:02.757
The work is hard.

02:18:03.517 --> 02:18:04.938
New School asks a lot of us teachers.

02:18:05.818 --> 02:18:13.781
It asks us to believe deeply in ourselves and challenges us to find the best way to make our teaching magical and accessible to every student.

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:18.279
With the trust and support of our fellow educators, we do, every day.

02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.964
Now I ask you to believe with us and approve our petition.

02:18:22.645 --> 02:18:22.946
Thank you.

02:18:28.783 --> 02:18:29.323
Good morning.

02:18:29.963 --> 02:18:44.029
My name is Maria, and I'm a proud parent of a second grader at New School of San Francisco, also a member of the Families of Color at New School, otherwise known as the 48% and Growing, and along with my wife, Sarah, a member of the LGBT Affinity Group.

02:18:44.629 --> 02:18:51.492
I grew up in a low-income family to a schizophrenic Jamaican mother and a French Creole father who grew up in the backwoods of Louisiana.

02:18:52.072 --> 02:19:02.889
During the first 18 years of my life, I faced multiple traumas of domestic abuse, food insecurity, and sometimes hunger, late night neighborhood gunfire, dilapidated housing, and the list goes on.

02:19:03.769 --> 02:19:08.392
We know that similar crises continue to be realities for many San Francisco families.

02:19:09.072 --> 02:19:15.596
Our city has among the largest academic gaps in California between white and black students, and it's also one of the most segregated districts.

02:19:16.397 --> 02:19:30.646
I love new school, not only for my own child's chance to never know any of the hardships I endured, but to pay it solidly forward and give the same opportunities to our English learners, our kids with special needs, and our growing numbers of racial and economic minorities.

02:19:31.246 --> 02:19:35.828
We're trying hard to raise those numbers, and we think that now we have a chance to do that even more rapidly.

02:19:36.488 --> 02:19:40.230
And we've done it in a much shorter time than it has taken others to do the same.

02:19:40.450 --> 02:19:44.292
Thank you so much for your consideration, and I hope that you will extend our reauthorization.

02:19:44.492 --> 02:19:45.052
Much respect.

02:19:54.576 --> 02:19:56.017
Hi, my name is Ruth.

02:19:56.717 --> 02:20:00.519
I am a non-binary fourth grader at New School San Francisco.

02:20:02.170 --> 02:20:05.353
Non-binary for me means neither girl or boy.

02:20:05.953 --> 02:20:11.638
I came to New School SF a week into second grade when everyone already knew each other.

02:20:12.458 --> 02:20:20.665
My teachers helped my class learn my pronouns, they, them, theirs, to make sure I felt comfortable in my new community right away.

02:20:22.133 --> 02:20:26.614
They also invited the author of a book about gender identity to read in our class.

02:20:27.635 --> 02:20:32.036
Not having to explain my gender all the time gives me room to focus and learn.

02:20:32.956 --> 02:20:40.219
New School helps me show my true self without having to worry about teasing and bullying.

02:20:40.759 --> 02:20:47.881
I've been at New School for two and a half years, which is the longest I've been at any school, and I want this experience to continue.

02:20:48.061 --> 02:20:49.782
Please vote yes on New School SF.

02:20:50.122 --> 02:20:50.502
Thank you.

02:20:59.829 --> 02:21:01.150
Hello, my name is Penelope.

02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:03.831
I'm here to talk to you about why we should keep the school going K-3.

02:21:04.312 --> 02:21:09.975
One reason is because all the teachers are kind, loving, and respectful to all of us, and help us when we need it most.

02:21:10.315 --> 02:21:12.096
All of them support being unique and ourselves.

02:21:12.396 --> 02:21:15.658
Any school mistakes are expected, respected, inspected, and corrected.

02:21:16.038 --> 02:21:18.660
Besides the teachers, I also love how diverse our school is.

02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:20.922
where everyone is included and respected.

02:21:21.122 --> 02:21:26.866
On top of that, my favorite subject is math, which may be surprising to some people because I was struggling in math last year.

02:21:27.267 --> 02:21:29.408
I started to love it when we did standard algorithm.

02:21:29.748 --> 02:21:32.831
They gave us so many strategies, but that was one of them that worked for me.

02:21:33.491 --> 02:21:35.293
New School believes struggle is good for your mind.

02:21:35.493 --> 02:21:37.514
I agree because my evidence proves it.

02:21:37.554 --> 02:21:39.556
There is so much more to talk about, but I will end here.

02:21:39.876 --> 02:21:40.196
Thank you.

02:21:40.216 --> 02:21:41.658
Please vote to keep New School K-3A.

02:21:47.921 --> 02:21:49.742
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

02:21:49.942 --> 02:21:52.724
Glad I'm too old that I'll never have to compete with these kids.

02:21:55.627 --> 02:21:57.748
By all accounts, this is a very successful school.

02:21:57.888 --> 02:22:11.398
They do have some diversity challenges, but the solutions that they've put forward, specifically the low-income admissions preference, has proven very successful in many other charter schools in similar circumstances, including some that are authorized by this board.

02:22:12.339 --> 02:22:23.670
So, we recommend approval of that, thank CDE staff and the ACCS for their recommendation, and in the interest of time, ditto for number 18, because I'm probably going to be off at a dental appointment at that point.

02:22:23.690 --> 02:22:24.550
So, thank you very much.

02:22:30.017 --> 02:22:34.244
I'm Patience Yee, a parent of a mixed race child and a board member at New School.

02:22:35.025 --> 02:22:37.909
And when I was 12, I experienced a major trauma from assault.

02:22:38.310 --> 02:22:44.139
And because my school was not equipped to support my needs, I went from earning straight A's to dropping out of high school in the ninth grade.

02:22:45.420 --> 02:22:47.562
And I wanted more for my son and for other kids.

02:22:48.143 --> 02:22:57.030
And I chose New School because they've done this work, they've done the hard work up front to implement these systems to support these kids, especially kids who need more support like I did.

02:23:01.174 --> 02:23:03.395
I also chose New School because of their commitment to all kids.

02:23:05.237 --> 02:23:09.620
The things that they've implemented are things like learning plans and goals specific to each kid.

02:23:10.101 --> 02:23:14.404
They also have an on-site wellness center so kids can go if they need a quiet place to de-escalate.

02:23:14.765 --> 02:23:20.709
And they have a full-time on-site therapist that's providing counseling and interventions for these kids.

02:23:21.890 --> 02:23:29.155
And it also has a low student-to-teacher ratio, which is, I can't even explain how important that is for these kids that need support every day.

02:23:29.916 --> 02:23:32.978
Parents and students call it new school magic, but it is not magic.

02:23:33.118 --> 02:23:40.683
It's intentional and it's by design, and I implore you to not only let this school continue, but to grow to serve more of the kids that need this most.

02:23:40.743 --> 02:23:41.003
Thank you.

02:23:47.245 --> 02:23:53.968
My name is Rika Thomas-Antoniotti, and I'm the parent of two new schoolers, a fourth grader and a first grader.

02:23:54.688 --> 02:24:08.454
My kids have learned many things over their years at new school, but they've really become experts at being upstanders, standing up for what they believe to be right and lending their voices to those without one.

02:24:09.924 --> 02:24:26.213
So I am here today to follow their example and stand up not just for my kids and their classmates, but also on behalf of children whose calls have historically gone unheeded in the current education system.

02:24:27.213 --> 02:24:33.357
I'm standing up today for children who are overlooked, marginalized, and neglected.

02:24:34.750 --> 02:25:02.128
I ask you too to stand up for these children today by ensuring that they have access to the kind of equitable, robust, diverse, and inclusive public education that New School provides so that all kids like mine have the opportunity to realize and exceed their potential and one day use their voices to stand up for others.

02:25:02.568 --> 02:25:02.969
Thank you.

02:25:05.656 --> 02:25:06.567
Ramel Antoine.

02:25:20.183 --> 02:25:20.824
Good morning board.

02:25:20.844 --> 02:25:25.986
Ramel Antoine, California Charter Schools Association here speaking in support of new school.

02:25:26.467 --> 02:25:41.675
I'm just here to state that they've met all the criteria for renewal and associating with Eric Premack's comments from charter school development that they have had challenges and have done a lot of work to correct that over the course of the past five years.

02:25:42.976 --> 02:25:48.079
I know that there will be some discussion about what that has looked like and what they've done but I think the school has shown that they have

02:25:48.879 --> 02:25:53.082
created a long system of support for students in trying to integrate more and more students.

02:25:53.142 --> 02:26:03.670
I think it's an important conversation to have about parents who have access in San Francisco Unified and who don't, and what the school is trying to do to disrupt what they call white dominant practices.

02:26:03.730 --> 02:26:06.612
I think that's super important for us to think about, urge your support.

02:26:06.892 --> 02:26:07.172
Thank you.

02:26:13.484 --> 02:26:15.706
I'm assuming that's the end of public comment.

02:26:15.787 --> 02:26:16.668
Thank you very much.

02:26:18.289 --> 02:26:21.293
Seeing no other public comment, I will close the public.

02:26:21.593 --> 02:26:22.774
Oh, sorry.

02:26:24.076 --> 02:26:25.257
Sorry, I signed in.

02:26:25.918 --> 02:26:27.019
Impact over intent.

02:26:27.359 --> 02:26:33.265
Here's the story of focal students at SF International impacted by the new school's co-location who can't make it here today.

02:26:34.727 --> 02:26:36.768
This is Julie Roberts-Fung, Families Union.

02:26:37.369 --> 02:26:39.651
This is a newcomer high school for students in the U.S.

02:26:39.691 --> 02:26:40.591
less than four years.

02:26:40.731 --> 02:26:42.673
They're high-need immigrant and refugee students.

02:26:43.313 --> 02:26:45.395
Picture the SF International student body.

02:26:45.415 --> 02:26:47.316
87% are ELLs, 71% are low SES, 6% are white.

02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:53.781
Now picture the new school student body.

02:26:54.341 --> 02:26:59.023
9% are ELLs, 11% are low SES, 52% are white.

02:26:59.763 --> 02:27:05.125
Charters like Mission Prep serve low SES students and students of color with no special enrollment tools in San Francisco.

02:27:05.845 --> 02:27:08.866
At SF International, demographics are not destiny.

02:27:09.027 --> 02:27:11.748
82% of grads are in college, 99% persist.

02:27:12.368 --> 02:27:20.071
They serve our focal students and are recognized for a fifth year hybrid program where students take high school and college courses and give support to high risk graduates.

02:27:21.031 --> 02:27:26.532
Because the new school takes their space, immigrant and refugee students who arrive mid-year can't access this amazing school.

02:27:26.812 --> 02:27:30.153
While the new school is there, SF International can only shrink, never grow.

02:27:30.833 --> 02:27:37.175
My kids are at a similar school and our students arrive year-round, driven by the Yemeni civil war or the caravan from Latin America.

02:27:38.455 --> 02:27:40.016
White families have enough choices.

02:27:40.336 --> 02:27:44.397
If we allow them to choose to expand their majority white charter, it's our most vulnerable students who pay.

02:27:44.557 --> 02:27:44.817
Thank you.

02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:52.886
Okay, and now we're done with public comment, I think.

02:27:53.206 --> 02:27:53.427
Yes?

02:27:53.447 --> 02:27:54.528
Okay.

02:27:55.510 --> 02:28:01.819
So, I'm now going to close the public hearing for this item at

02:28:03.832 --> 02:28:04.832
1059 a.m.

02:28:05.652 --> 02:28:21.276
And I'm going to ask Sue Burr as our SBA liaison if she has any initial comments, and I would ask if you might include in those what the request for material revision was previously, because I didn't really get a sense of that.

02:28:22.496 --> 02:28:25.557
And then we can maybe open up for further board discussion.

02:28:26.677 --> 02:28:47.446
I might need Lisa's help here and or the schools First I'll just say and I think you heard this in some of the testimony This item was heard thoroughly by the Advisory Commission on charter schools And as you see in your item the Advisory Commission voted unanimously to reckon to adopt the department's recommendation to renew the charter So I will just put that out there

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:53.048
But in the course of the conversation, the issue about diversity was kind of front and center.

02:28:53.588 --> 02:28:58.890
And what we heard from the school was they saw that early on in their operation.

02:28:58.910 --> 02:29:02.432
Remember, they've been one of our charters since 2015.

02:29:03.072 --> 02:29:11.776
And that they requested of the department, which is the process, to make a material revision to allow them to change their lottery preferences.

02:29:12.456 --> 02:29:31.430
My under I believe it's similar to what is being requested now or being suggested as a condition by the department and as our charter school advocates have testified that's proven very successful and if you see on their their data that they presented I think you have a hundred and nine students that are on your waitlist that qualify already and

02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:36.295
So just changing that preference was going to give them a big bump in theory.

02:29:36.656 --> 02:29:41.701
But for a variety of reasons, and I'm not, I really am not trying to point the finger at the department.

02:29:41.781 --> 02:29:43.664
I think there were lots of changes going on.

02:29:43.724 --> 02:29:46.867
We had changes in leadership and the charter division.

02:29:47.167 --> 02:29:52.854
We also had legislative changes that were affecting the department's judgment and bringing it to the board.

02:29:53.294 --> 02:30:00.018
But the fact of the matter is for a couple of years they tried to make the changes and were not able to because it got blocked.

02:30:00.038 --> 02:30:02.560
It never came to the board for a vote.

02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:10.905
So I feel like the school got caught in a catch-22 and now they're being criticized heavily for that reason.

02:30:11.865 --> 02:30:16.866
which they actually tried to correct on their own, but you might want to clarify, Lisa.

02:30:17.066 --> 02:30:18.047
I was just going to echo that.

02:30:18.107 --> 02:30:18.647
That is true.

02:30:18.767 --> 02:30:34.891
I think there were three attempts, and I was aware of the one that I spoke to in 2017, and it was to change their admission preferences to noticing, realizing that they had this issue early on, trying to change their admission preferences to try and address that.

02:30:38.258 --> 02:30:39.619
without any preference?

02:30:39.639 --> 02:30:50.166
No, the preference, if I can, I call to your attention, Lisa mentioned this, but I do think this Appendix D, the community engagement model that we all have copies of, is very helpful.

02:30:50.546 --> 02:31:00.172
This was included in the renewal petition, but as Lisa mentioned, it wasn't in the petition itself, it was an appendix, and it's so important, we think it needs to be

02:31:01.273 --> 02:31:02.695
contained in the actual petition.

02:31:03.195 --> 02:31:19.555
But this both talks about what their preferences are, let me see if I can find the right page here, and it also gives targets for diversity, how much they will increase their diversity based on those changes in the preferences.

02:31:23.163 --> 02:31:24.566
So, I would just call that to attention.

02:31:24.586 --> 02:31:25.768
I think that clarifies.

02:31:25.888 --> 02:31:26.589
Thank you very much.

02:31:26.889 --> 02:31:27.130
All right.

02:31:28.292 --> 02:31:31.798
So, with those introductory comments, we want to open this to board discussion.

02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:34.302
Member Ortiz-Lacon?

02:31:37.519 --> 02:31:43.260
Thank you, and I want to thank all the community members that came and also San Francisco Unified.

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:54.283
I understand why this is a difficult, sort of difficult, because we're seeing amazing and impressive academic performance, right, and a great model.

02:31:54.703 --> 02:31:58.064
And so when I was looking through the item, I thought, how are they doing this?

02:31:58.884 --> 02:32:01.645
because they had impressive academic gains.

02:32:02.186 --> 02:32:07.328
Then I looked into the demographic section, I thought, oh, that's how it's happening.

02:32:08.168 --> 02:32:15.452
When you look at the original criteria, it said not to exceed 33% of students free and reduced lunch.

02:32:16.372 --> 02:32:21.995
And I was really confused by that, because to an extent, the population you have is by design.

02:32:22.972 --> 02:32:39.549
However, what I think happened was, in reading your supplementary, your community engagement model, it seems to me that the initial intent was not to segregate the school or have a racially isolated school.

02:32:39.749 --> 02:32:45.675
And so there was this effort to balance, because we know that free and reduced is a proxy for race,

02:32:46.215 --> 02:32:55.299
there was an effort to balance the number of students so that it would be a more, not a racially isolated school, but one that was racially integrated.

02:32:56.180 --> 02:33:06.385
However, along the way, I am assuming they realized that that didn't quite work because they had a disproportionate number of white students compared to San Francisco Unified and the neighborhood.

02:33:08.406 --> 02:33:12.808
And that's when they attempted to come for the material revision and for whatever reason they couldn't.

02:33:13.308 --> 02:33:29.020
So what we have now is really a school that has excelled in academic performance, that has a great model, which I think will really be tested if we change the criteria selection, because the only real way to understand privilege is to lose it.

02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:38.867
And if we move to moving the sibling criteria down, you have to be ready for those parents who are going to be inconvenienced by that.

02:33:39.307 --> 02:33:48.875
You have to be ready for those parents who are going to say, that's not fair for my child because now there's a practical reality of having to go to two different schools, or I want a piece of that model.

02:33:49.755 --> 02:33:51.537
But that is what real equity is.

02:33:52.157 --> 02:34:08.189
And so I love your framework, but I have to say, I think it's been in theory mode until you diversify the student population, then you'll understand what reality looks like when you're working with low income, racially diverse students from all walks of life.

02:34:08.789 --> 02:34:18.476
I am very interested to see if you're able to maintain this level of performance and this model intact when you move from theory to practice.

02:34:18.977 --> 02:34:19.237
Thank you.

02:34:22.915 --> 02:34:23.815
Want to get in the queue?

02:34:25.496 --> 02:34:25.756
Okay.

02:34:26.196 --> 02:34:33.620
Well, this is a difficult conversation to have for all the reasons that board member Ortiz-Lacombe has laid out.

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:45.865
And so, I'm disturbed by a couple of statements that were made and even though there was probably no harm intended in the statements,

02:34:47.206 --> 02:35:00.434
These are some classic examples of microaggressions that always pop up in conversations where diversity is one of the issues in addition to academic performance.

02:35:00.935 --> 02:35:14.044
And so one of the statements I heard, and I'm going to paraphrase the statement without attribution, was that this is a high-achieving school with some minor issues concerning diversity.

02:35:14.824 --> 02:35:17.425
So diversity is not a minor issue.

02:35:18.005 --> 02:35:34.733
Diversity is a very important and central issue in a state like California, in a community like San Francisco, and in particular at this particular school site where the students who are in the neighborhood who attend that school

02:35:35.453 --> 02:35:42.397
will be displaced, are being displaced by the students who attend that charter school.

02:35:42.917 --> 02:35:54.964
And in this particular circumstance, the charter school was created with the promise of creating recruitment and focused attention on a particular type of student.

02:35:55.925 --> 02:36:04.450
And while the statements and assertions are being made that they worked really hard on this, the data says, no, you didn't.

02:36:05.521 --> 02:36:22.489
And while the statements and assertions about how they will improve based on some practices for other schools, the context of the neighborhood where these students attend says you don't need those admissions preferences.

02:36:22.849 --> 02:36:29.052
I remember years ago when the Department of Ed, when they were first implementing their Public Schools Accountability Act,

02:36:29.493 --> 02:36:38.708
said that they were having a hard time finding enough black students to give a test to so they could identify the subgroup performance, I'm like, would you like me to tell you where they live?

02:36:39.824 --> 02:36:43.427
So diversity is a habit of mind.

02:36:44.167 --> 02:36:59.979
If you're looking for students to bring into your school and you are in a neighborhood in a community such as where this school is located in a city like San Francisco, it is really not that difficult to recruit a student population that is reflective of the community.

02:37:00.399 --> 02:37:13.030
So no, I do not accept the premise despite the mistake that was made and I agree and I appreciate the clarification that was made this morning because I didn't have that information until this morning.

02:37:13.371 --> 02:37:16.814
So I agree that there was an effort made

02:37:17.384 --> 02:37:22.889
in the fourth year of their five-year charter to try to address this problem.

02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:39.723
I agree with all of that, that that happened, but it doesn't change the fact that they were hopping merrily along with an enrollment that wasn't reflective of their plan, and they come here today bragging about achievement that is not based on that performance.

02:37:41.104 --> 02:37:45.668
Since they're saying diversity is their concern and that they're doing all this great work for students,

02:37:46.028 --> 02:37:59.741
I would have liked them to take a look at the data about their students who are their ethnic minority population and present that information to me about their four-year or five-year performance over the arc of time in their school if they really are doing their work.

02:38:00.121 --> 02:38:01.463
They chose not to do that.

02:38:02.003 --> 02:38:23.849
So, I'm not going to dispute that it's an achieving school, but I definitely dispute that diversity is the centerpiece of the work that they are attempting to do, and I'm not sure I can agree that the plan for recruitment they have is going to work because it truly doesn't consider the context of the community and the neighborhood where they are working.

02:38:23.969 --> 02:38:29.130
Just because it works someplace else doesn't mean it's going to work for you.

02:38:32.352 --> 02:38:40.939
But again, given the conversation that we have heard, diversity is taking a back seat to the academic achievement and success of this school.

02:38:41.559 --> 02:38:54.330
And so while that may not have been the intentional statement that was made, that is the priority and the centerpiece of the conversation that was heard and that was discussed in the presentation today.

02:38:54.970 --> 02:39:08.723
And while I did take a look at what happened at the ACCS, there was a lot of confusion about the diversity plan and what they actually intended to do that really clouded this part of the conversation.

02:39:09.304 --> 02:39:13.368
So, while I understand what happened, I do not trust.

02:39:14.588 --> 02:39:17.769
what the outcome is going to be and I am very concerned.

02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:29.874
We have spent a lot of time over these last two days talking about stakeholders, talking about the impact of stakeholders and what we continue to do at this level because we have the comfort to do that

02:39:30.314 --> 02:39:47.020
is we continue to isolate, segregate, and even compartmentalize what stakeholders are, what it means to think about stakeholders, and in this particular conversation, what the ideals of diversity are actually supposed to be operating to do.

02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:49.721
And this has been a wholesale failure.

02:39:51.184 --> 02:39:53.845
I want to move to Member Sun.

02:39:53.985 --> 02:39:57.086
Is there anybody else who's and then Member Strauss.

02:39:57.966 --> 02:40:01.388
I also want to ask a clarifying question about our process.

02:40:02.968 --> 02:40:16.293
Item 18 will be about the material revision requested which is when we will hear more about how the school plans to implement that piece of the proposal and yet we're asked to

02:40:17.693 --> 02:40:24.158
vote on the renewal before we've had the opportunity to hear the plans for the material revision.

02:40:24.879 --> 02:40:28.141
And I don't know if there's any, yes.

02:40:28.922 --> 02:40:33.105
Just to clarify, the material revision has to do with expanding grades.

02:40:33.706 --> 02:40:35.887
But it also had to go to K-8.

02:40:36.768 --> 02:40:45.575
The issue about reflecting the diversity and changing the lottery preferences is contained in this item.

02:40:45.675 --> 02:40:45.875
Right.

02:40:46.335 --> 02:40:48.897
Then there is more of it that goes in the other item as well.

02:40:49.877 --> 02:41:02.585
Maybe what we will want to do is give plaintiffs an opportunity to come and explain what their plans are with respect to this part of it and then save the rest.

02:41:03.525 --> 02:41:04.105
Member Sun.

02:41:05.066 --> 02:41:11.708
Well, I will respectfully disagree with my colleague that the school is dismissive of equity.

02:41:13.609 --> 02:41:27.834
In looking at their model in describing the charter and the practices in the testimony of the students who have come up here and the parents who have come up here, it is very clear that equity inquiry is at the heart of the school.

02:41:28.594 --> 02:41:37.124
And I don't believe that the petitioners who have come up that they were making this up for this particular session.

02:41:37.344 --> 02:41:40.128
It truly is reflective of what the school is about.

02:41:40.748 --> 02:41:43.011
The fact that the school has resulted in

02:41:46.174 --> 02:41:56.681
the lack of diversity within the population as far as ethnicity and some of the areas that the state tracks.

02:41:57.481 --> 02:41:58.842
They do have a plan for it.

02:41:59.142 --> 02:42:06.847
It sounds like they did make attempts early on to try to make some changes so that their school can be reflective of what their vision is.

02:42:07.928 --> 02:42:09.749
I do want to say a couple of things.

02:42:10.169 --> 02:42:14.552
Having worked with small schools and when you work with small

02:42:15.132 --> 02:42:15.672
numbers.

02:42:15.933 --> 02:42:18.274
Percentages can sometimes be deceiving.

02:42:18.894 --> 02:42:27.298
So, when you're looking at sometimes five additional students increasing, can increase percentages by 15%.

02:42:27.338 --> 02:42:35.923
So, you know, part of looking at the percentages and kind of weighing the percentages and all that

02:42:36.643 --> 02:42:48.428
while I completely agree that we want to be reflective of the student population of the district, that the fluctuations there, you will see up and down because of small numbers.

02:42:49.089 --> 02:43:01.714
The other piece I want to point out about diversity is the state of California tracks these are kind of traditional numbers of students, foster youth, socioeconomically disadvantaged,

02:43:02.855 --> 02:43:04.195
racial, ethnic diversity.

02:43:04.636 --> 02:43:06.897
But there are other types of diversity.

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:12.260
And I was very impressed with the student who came up here, the non-binary student.

02:43:14.081 --> 02:43:24.468
It is, there's LGBTQ students who choose small schools because they are safe and they feel that they are accepted in those kinds of schools.

02:43:24.608 --> 02:43:29.611
And that is not information and that is not demographics or diversity that we track as a state.

02:43:30.211 --> 02:43:33.292
And so there are lots of other types of equity.

02:43:34.133 --> 02:43:43.737
And I am also concerned that we say, well, because it's white, somehow that it's easy for all those white students.

02:43:44.117 --> 02:43:48.979
Well, those white students also are inclusive of different types of students within there as well.

02:43:49.539 --> 02:43:56.982
So I think we just need to be aware of that and look at diversity more broadly than what might be currently in the

02:43:57.688 --> 02:43:59.451
numbers that we track as a state.

02:44:01.253 --> 02:44:01.734
I think that is it.

02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:23.238
the data and for the school and for people who came today to testify on behalf of both sides about the benefits and the students and the parents that came from New School.

02:44:23.298 --> 02:44:32.224
I just, and the staff, I really appreciate, I think we all do, the time that you take to help us understand how the school's practices directly impact your daily lives.

02:44:32.244 --> 02:44:33.746
I just so appreciate the model.

02:44:33.786 --> 02:44:33.966
I mean,

02:44:34.366 --> 02:44:43.771
In some ways, when you listen to the faculty talk about the qualities and expectations of school, you want this for all your schools, you want it for your kids and your grandkids, that kind of energy, but you want it for all kids.

02:44:44.211 --> 02:44:54.836
I appreciate that the conditions that the CDE is approving with, recommending approving with conditions address some of the issues that we've been talking about, about increasing diversity and the preferences.

02:44:55.916 --> 02:45:02.400
I think our board members have shared some issues about the fact that parents do want their siblings in the same school, and that could be a challenge.

02:45:02.460 --> 02:45:07.463
And as someone who does pick up for grandkids sometimes, I understand what the challenges are of different schools.

02:45:07.863 --> 02:45:09.944
But I think what we're trying to do is create an opportunity.

02:45:09.964 --> 02:45:20.030
The other thing that I think the San Francisco Unified's challenged with is Prop 39 and where to find the right space in the right community to help schools who are entitled to space.

02:45:20.450 --> 02:45:28.594
So now we have an area where the space is impacting newcomer school and that's a decision that the district don't have to look at with their Prop 39 because we don't want to disadvantage.

02:45:28.614 --> 02:45:39.000
We want to create great schools for all kids and I appreciate as what Member Sung said is small schools where kids are known really well there's some great benefits and I would say not just at elementary but at middle and high school as well.

02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:41.501
We want places where kids feel successful

02:45:41.861 --> 02:45:44.023
can find their voice, feel comfortable, not judged.

02:45:44.503 --> 02:45:50.327
And the qualities that the staff at New School is creating is things that I think are great models that we could look at.

02:45:51.427 --> 02:45:57.131
So I would support the recommendation with the conditions and the addressing specifically.

02:45:57.171 --> 02:45:59.933
And I know President Darling-Hammond talked about

02:46:00.293 --> 02:46:04.557
We want to really understand what they're going to do with their preferences to change the admission policy.

02:46:04.597 --> 02:46:07.139
My understanding is they have some specifics.

02:46:07.159 --> 02:46:13.585
There's a big waiting list so that when we look at the data, we will see an increased diversity and opportunity for the students.

02:46:13.985 --> 02:46:16.527
That was the intent initially of the charter.

02:46:16.768 --> 02:46:17.048
Thank you.

02:46:24.158 --> 02:46:37.093
I do want to ask the petitioners to be available to answer some of those specific questions so they may want to come back to the podium after those two comments so we can get questions answered.

02:46:38.994 --> 02:46:45.482
So I find the failure to be able to recruit sufficiently for diversity very troubling.

02:46:46.303 --> 02:46:56.595
These are – there are models, there are ways to do these things, and over a long period of time to continuously fall back on that is troubling.

02:46:58.316 --> 02:47:16.281
It is also, I think, the case that small numbers in small schools do shift percentages, but small numbers in small schools also mean the difference between a child being a single black child, a single Latino kid in a class, and I think that's also something to think about.

02:47:19.703 --> 02:47:30.272
Standing up for equity and standing up for equity inquiry is one thing, and then there's also standing up for equity in action, which I think you need both.

02:47:31.533 --> 02:47:38.879
So I'm very interested to hear more about what the plan is that is going to be proposed.

02:47:40.140 --> 02:47:46.343
Because an equity inquiry, I think, is very powerful, and it very much shapes mental models for the future.

02:47:46.403 --> 02:48:00.248
But I think part of a diverse learning experience is not just thinking about how equity plays out, but actually interacting with kids in your actual classroom environment.

02:48:00.929 --> 02:48:09.092
And so figuring out how to make that not just a theoretical concept, but a lived experience of lived applied learning matters.

02:48:13.997 --> 02:48:22.508
Do you want to hear some of the answers about the question before you speak or do you want to make a point and then we will hear from the petitioners?

02:48:30.899 --> 02:48:33.061
You put up the admission requirements.

02:48:34.862 --> 02:48:40.307
In this slide, you don't recommend a minimum of 33%, but the next item does.

02:48:40.927 --> 02:48:43.549
So how are these two items working?

02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:52.557
Because if we approve this, I'm assuming that if this is approved, there's a high possibility that the next item will be approved, but what if it isn't, right?

02:48:52.597 --> 02:48:54.559
And so are we also plugging in 33%

02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:03.304
And if we put this into the main proposal, they have identified their own projected targets.

02:49:03.764 --> 02:49:08.086
What are we holding them accountable to their projected targets or to our minimum 33%?

02:49:08.166 --> 02:49:14.450
Our minimum 33% and then actually with the material revision, we're going even further than that.

02:49:14.966 --> 02:49:15.926
with the expansion.

02:49:16.266 --> 02:49:22.688
We're actually recommending going to 50% for kindergarten and for their expansion into sixth grade.

02:49:23.088 --> 02:49:24.769
So we're even going a little further in that.

02:49:25.049 --> 02:49:27.289
Okay, so this admission requirement does not include the 33%.

02:49:27.389 --> 02:49:31.250
It was not on the slide, but it is as part of the recommendation.

02:49:31.270 --> 02:49:32.151
So it's a minimum?

02:49:32.671 --> 02:49:32.871
Yes.

02:49:34.191 --> 02:49:37.612
Well, that's why we're getting these questions answered, yeah.

02:49:37.632 --> 02:49:38.993
So that's correct, it was the minimum.

02:49:39.033 --> 02:49:44.134
And then, as I mentioned, we'll go a little further in the next item in terms of their expansion.

02:49:45.013 --> 02:49:52.534
So for clarification, you're requiring those percentages in the grade levels for next year coming in.

02:49:52.554 --> 02:49:53.735
Is that right?

02:49:53.795 --> 02:49:56.495
If they were to be approved for the sixth grade?

02:49:56.555 --> 02:49:57.355
Correct.

02:49:57.515 --> 02:49:58.616
And also for kindergarten.

02:49:58.636 --> 02:50:01.616
Because they're going to expand a grade level per year.

02:50:02.296 --> 02:50:04.937
So next year it'll only go to sixth grade.

02:50:05.037 --> 02:50:10.938
So we are recommending that for the kinders that are coming in and then for the sixth grade where they're expanding to.

02:50:11.118 --> 02:50:16.941
Because it would be very hard if they don't have, they're not expanding within the current grade levels that they have.

02:50:17.021 --> 02:50:21.944
The only places that they can expand these percentages is in the new grade levels.

02:50:22.144 --> 02:50:22.464
Correct.

02:50:22.824 --> 02:50:24.185
New classes that are coming in.

02:50:24.225 --> 02:50:29.908
Because once they're locked in, it's hard, you may have two or three spaces and it's really hard to get to that.

02:50:30.048 --> 02:50:37.172
So they almost need additional room growth in order to hit some of these larger targets.

02:50:38.277 --> 02:50:43.577
Okay, I want to move to Member Pangelinan, who was waiting, and then I'll come back over here.

02:50:45.208 --> 02:50:57.672
So my comment was almost exactly identical to Member Bronson, but the idea that equity does have to live, and you have to see, hello?

02:50:58.133 --> 02:50:59.353
Yeah, it's on.

02:50:59.613 --> 02:51:07.756
And you have to see diversity in your own classmates, and on the slide about equity, specifically it says curriculum that explores

02:51:08.516 --> 02:51:21.471
race, power, and privilege beginning in kindergarten, but I do think that exploring really can't be done unless you're interacting with students from different backgrounds, and a curriculum that explores isn't really enough.

02:51:23.433 --> 02:51:25.737
considering that you need to see that in real life.

02:51:27.259 --> 02:51:39.116
And then also just I am interested to see the recruitment process because free and reduced lunch, including that, I do think will help increase diversity, but there's so much more than just that as well.

02:51:40.157 --> 02:51:54.067
And then also, if there is in a small school, like you said, you know, one student that is a minority or because, you know, those percentages are small in small numbers, what does the staff look like?

02:51:54.087 --> 02:52:00.292
I don't think that was necessarily presented, but are minorities seeing themselves in the staff if they're underrepresented?

02:52:00.352 --> 02:52:04.395
So another just, you know, concern and something to look into,

02:52:05.155 --> 02:52:09.840
and I am interested to see the recruitment process that is being planned.

02:52:10.603 --> 02:52:20.087
So I think those are really good questions and I'd like to ask somebody from the petitioners to come up and be available to answer some of those questions and we can ask that they come up now.

02:52:20.127 --> 02:52:23.068
We've got a couple of more comments from board members.

02:52:24.048 --> 02:52:27.330
Is there somebody from the petitioners who will be able to answer some of these questions?

02:52:27.830 --> 02:52:34.633
I think I also will want to ask about, this is what we would put in the approval, but I'd like to know how

02:52:35.293 --> 02:52:38.257
the school is planning to implement those things.

02:52:38.357 --> 02:52:40.179
So, hold your thought.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:48.390
I want to get to member Rucker and member Burr and then we're going to come back to you to answer some of the questions that have been raised, okay?

02:52:49.648 --> 02:53:14.761
Okay, so part of what I'm struggling with is there's some information here that I'm, that I wasn't clear on in coming into today's meeting and so what I'm still confused about is what exactly we, the action that we're voting on is and let me see if I can explain where my confusion is and that might be helpful for the staff.

02:53:15.141 --> 02:53:15.441
Right.

02:53:15.941 --> 02:53:19.043
The staff from the department to

02:53:19.793 --> 02:53:20.353
Yeah.

02:53:20.413 --> 02:53:21.474
No, you won't be helpful.

02:53:22.074 --> 02:53:22.715
I can promise you.

02:53:23.135 --> 02:53:33.781
So, the action that we're voting on for this item, and I'm uncomfortable that we're talking about two items at once also.

02:53:34.341 --> 02:53:42.526
The action that we're voting on for this item is related to the approval of the charter itself.

02:53:43.667 --> 02:53:45.148
The renewal of the charter.

02:53:45.528 --> 02:53:47.109
And so, but what I'm hearing

02:53:48.254 --> 02:54:03.213
for K-5, but what I'm hearing is that because one of the issues is about the diversity of the student enrollment, what I'm hearing is that part of the resolution for that problem

02:54:03.833 --> 02:54:25.765
is related to the changes that they have made concerning their enrollment practice and practically, and this is where I'm confused, but practically, in order to make the percentages work, they need the other item to be approved so that they have the grade levels to expand into.

02:54:25.785 --> 02:54:27.625
This is where I'm getting confused.

02:54:28.326 --> 02:54:28.506
Yeah.

02:54:32.399 --> 02:54:37.421
staff explain and then member Burr you may want to add on.

02:54:37.878 --> 02:54:39.079
First, we're looking at the renewal.

02:54:39.279 --> 02:54:41.381
This is Judy Sias, Chief Counsel for the State Board.

02:54:41.961 --> 02:54:47.086
First, we're looking at the renewal and staff has analyzed the petition and determined they meet the criteria for renewal.

02:54:47.966 --> 02:54:53.311
As part of that analysis though, they have recommended some changes to the mission preferences, 33%.

02:54:55.232 --> 02:54:59.516
But again, as member Sun pointed out, that would only be for K-5.

02:54:59.896 --> 02:55:04.280
So, when you have entering kindergartners and you already have a population in grades one through four,

02:55:05.582 --> 02:55:12.164
She said it would be difficult to me, but that is what we're going to hold them accountable to you Should you approve the renewal now again?

02:55:12.184 --> 02:55:27.668
They met the criteria legally for the renewal and then moving on as we talk about their expansion I think that is a separate item so I would suggest maybe if we focus on the renewal have they met the criteria for the renewal and then we can talk more about their recruitment and

02:55:28.988 --> 02:55:34.352
other issues and how they're going to communicate with families as part of the material revision because that's part of the expansion.

02:55:34.592 --> 02:55:35.953
Okay, that helps me.

02:55:36.233 --> 02:55:37.014
That helps me a lot.

02:55:37.254 --> 02:55:42.597
Okay, so Judy, I just want to pare back what you said and so I can make sure I have a clear answer.

02:55:42.958 --> 02:55:49.262
So the item we're voting on or the action we're asked to take as it relates to this item is purely about the renewal.

02:55:49.282 --> 02:55:50.162
All right.

02:55:50.883 --> 02:55:53.485
So we have heard from the staff and we have heard

02:55:53.945 --> 02:56:10.936
from the ACCS about issues related to the renewal and so the motion would be with the conditions you've established concerning criteria for admission as it relates to the K-5 program they have in place right now.

02:56:11.637 --> 02:56:13.538
That's what you're asking us to vote on.

02:56:13.718 --> 02:56:14.199
Correct.

02:56:14.219 --> 02:56:14.959
Okay.

02:56:15.039 --> 02:56:15.740
Now I'm clear.

02:56:15.800 --> 02:56:16.500
You're clear about that.

02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:20.923
And should when we hear the material revision there's additional criteria we can consider it at that point.

02:56:20.943 --> 02:56:21.403
At that time.

02:56:21.443 --> 02:56:21.704
Okay.

02:56:22.504 --> 02:56:23.625
And Member Burr.

02:56:23.985 --> 02:56:26.588
So I just, I wanted to agree with you.

02:56:26.608 --> 02:56:31.674
Yes, yes, yes, correct.

02:56:32.495 --> 02:56:42.126
And is there a slide or something that we should be looking at that will be helpful to people to clearly see the conditions?

02:56:42.867 --> 02:56:52.435
Yes there are two so there are the ones around the admission preferences and then the conditions around the race and ethnic balance.

02:56:52.916 --> 02:57:03.745
Okay so why don't we get to those and we'll just review them so everybody has very strong clarity and then member Burr I'm going to come back to you as soon as we've had a chance to

02:57:07.122 --> 02:57:10.664
So the one for racial and ethnic balance is on slide 28.

02:57:11.785 --> 02:57:24.031
That's the first condition, which is the one where we want to incorporate the community outreach plan into the petition itself as part of our, in essence, the petition is our contract with the school.

02:57:24.111 --> 02:57:25.312
So we want that incorporated.

02:57:25.712 --> 02:57:26.893
That's our first condition.

02:57:26.913 --> 02:57:33.737
And then the second condition is on the next slide under admission requirements.

02:57:34.557 --> 02:57:40.960
and then we lay out what we're actually recommending here on slide 30, and as you've all mentioned, outside of the 33%.

02:57:41.940 --> 02:57:47.342
So I invertedly omitted that, but that is part of this as well, a minimum, yes.

02:57:49.883 --> 02:57:52.945
Oh, I'm sorry, I was in the wrong view here.

02:57:55.186 --> 02:57:55.846
Yes, thank you.

02:58:01.874 --> 02:58:02.094
Okay.

02:58:02.374 --> 02:58:02.674
Okay.

02:58:03.735 --> 02:58:04.255
Member Burr.

02:58:06.636 --> 02:58:17.059
Per your suggestion I think it would be helpful to have the petitioners come back up and I have a couple of specific questions and I think hopefully it will respond to some of the comments that folks have asked about.

02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:19.420
So petitioner.

02:58:19.440 --> 02:58:20.581
You can now come back up.

02:58:21.841 --> 02:58:37.582
We do have some questions for you so that we understand the... I have first I just have the specific question about how many times did you ask the department to change your admissions preferences during the first term of your operation?

02:58:38.069 --> 02:58:41.390
So with this appeal, this will be our fourth attempt.

02:58:42.530 --> 02:58:44.390
The first attempt came in October of 2016.

02:58:45.891 --> 02:58:47.971
So one recruitment cycle.

02:58:48.991 --> 02:58:56.573
And it became really clear that demand from our school was overwhelming and that we weren't going to achieve the diversity we needed in our school, period.

02:58:56.613 --> 02:59:02.154
And access was being limited by virtue of the fact that we had such high demand in a random lottery.

02:59:02.874 --> 02:59:06.755
The second, we were denied in that request.

02:59:07.656 --> 02:59:09.976
The reasons for that, we did not yet have a 5 percent reserve.

02:59:10.577 --> 02:59:13.638
And that was the basis of the 5 percent reserve.

02:59:13.998 --> 02:59:15.218
And that was the reason for that denial.

02:59:15.878 --> 02:59:19.399
We then, the next year, followed up almost to the day on October 2nd, 2017.

02:59:21.400 --> 02:59:23.322
and requested another material revision.

02:59:24.223 --> 02:59:27.686
At that point, we also didn't have our 5% reserve, but we were on track to achieving that.

02:59:27.727 --> 02:59:31.210
In fact, we exceeded that reserve at the end of the year to 8%.

02:59:32.531 --> 02:59:35.775
But we were also denied based on the fact that we did not have that 5%.

02:59:37.136 --> 02:59:40.259
We then came back for the third time in February of 2019.

02:59:41.867 --> 02:59:44.648
to make sure that this current year would be impacted by preference.

02:59:45.008 --> 02:59:49.570
And we're told, as Lisa had said, that it was within the authorization year.

02:59:49.590 --> 02:59:50.891
It was going to be a really tough request.

02:59:51.211 --> 02:59:59.454
We were also going to be going up to our local authorizer first, and that out of concerns for local control and others, it would be best if we did it there.

03:00:00.094 --> 03:00:02.035
So those were the three attempts.

03:00:02.275 --> 03:00:02.795
This is the fourth.

03:00:07.092 --> 03:00:11.233
I just want to clarify that because I think there was an assertion made that this was your first time.

03:00:11.253 --> 03:00:20.276
I think the chronology demonstrates that you recognized it very early on in the operation and you made an attempt to correct it.

03:00:21.196 --> 03:00:21.616
That's right.

03:00:21.936 --> 03:00:26.298
I also want to just clarify because I agree completely that equity as a practice

03:00:28.118 --> 03:00:29.579
is something that can exist in theory.

03:00:29.699 --> 03:00:33.042
It's something you must carry out in your classrooms every single day.

03:00:33.663 --> 03:00:37.366
So, in shorthand, we define equity as not what's equal, what's fair.

03:00:38.086 --> 03:00:45.672
For a lot of kids, and a lot of families, and a lot of educators, that's a really tough principle to organize within a diverse school.

03:00:46.653 --> 03:00:49.976
We challenge ourselves to do that practically every single day.

03:00:50.333 --> 03:00:51.854
And I think that's just really, really important.

03:00:52.094 --> 03:00:58.280
The one thing I would say is our community has come together understanding that our demographics are not what we want to be.

03:00:58.320 --> 03:01:04.565
And we are not as accessible specifically to those families who qualify for free New Bruce Trice meals as we need to.

03:01:05.065 --> 03:01:12.552
When we came forward to our community saying these are the conditions that the CDE is laying out for approval.

03:01:13.871 --> 03:01:15.112
And there were two sets of conditions.

03:01:15.152 --> 03:01:17.034
The first that came before the ACCS.

03:01:17.695 --> 03:01:24.801
Not one member of our community came out in opposition to a preference for Free and Drew's Price meal eligible families to come before siblings.

03:01:25.041 --> 03:01:25.401
Not one.

03:01:26.022 --> 03:01:26.583
Everyone agreed.

03:01:26.863 --> 03:01:30.366
And then when that was up to 50% in kindergarten and sixth grade, the same thing happened.

03:01:30.546 --> 03:01:32.388
Not one person came out in opposition of it.

03:01:33.888 --> 03:01:35.969
Diversity and access is the core of what we did.

03:01:36.029 --> 03:01:37.550
We started it from the very beginning.

03:01:37.590 --> 03:01:39.891
It's a principle that, yes, you're absolutely right.

03:01:39.951 --> 03:01:44.994
We have not been able to achieve, but that we are focused as a community on in achieving.

03:01:45.614 --> 03:01:52.477
I think that's important from a sense of like, we as administrators aren't trying to achieve this, one, for the purpose of reauthorization.

03:01:52.657 --> 03:01:54.799
This is year upon year upon year of our focus.

03:01:54.819 --> 03:01:59.401
And I want to make sure that Christina has time to be able to take you through not the things that we will do,

03:02:00.353 --> 03:02:08.497
but the things that we have been doing over the last four years to ensure the things we have control over to help ensure access to lower income communities.

03:02:08.758 --> 03:02:10.999
So I want to make sure that we do that.

03:02:11.239 --> 03:02:13.700
I don't know, would you like us to get into that part of our presentation?

03:02:17.362 --> 03:02:20.665
short on time here and you have another item that's coming up.

03:02:21.686 --> 03:02:29.592
I just want to point out and it was up on the screen and we changed it back to the department but for folks who have the hard copy and maybe we can get it back up on the screen.

03:02:30.192 --> 03:02:34.396
The very last slide of the school's presentation which is page 11 slide 21

03:02:36.717 --> 03:02:44.920
talks about what they will do to increase the percentage of students or families who are eligible for enrollment via this preference.

03:02:45.200 --> 03:02:48.401
And it's not just by changing it and magically it's going to happen.

03:02:48.881 --> 03:02:59.865
And in fact, it's also outlined in quite a lot of detail again in this appendix which will become part of the petition around outreach, around services you're providing, transportation plans, etc.

03:03:01.025 --> 03:03:11.528
If you could sort of limit your comments just to focus on that and let people understand going forward how these changes might help you increase your diversity.

03:03:12.968 --> 03:03:14.468
How they build on what you're doing now.

03:03:14.488 --> 03:03:16.169
I'm sorry, could you say that one more time?

03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:19.229
If it's relevant, how they build on what you're doing now.

03:03:20.090 --> 03:03:25.131
Would it be helpful for me to go through the slides that actually walk through that or just to try and quickly answer?

03:03:25.971 --> 03:03:26.271
Thank you.

03:03:28.442 --> 03:03:34.027
Great, because I'm more of like a reading-off-my-paper type of person, because I get very nervous.

03:03:34.467 --> 03:03:36.389
And it will help me to go through the slides so that.

03:03:36.409 --> 03:03:40.072
Got it.

03:03:40.472 --> 03:03:41.913
I have timed it and everything.

03:03:42.874 --> 03:03:45.356
And I will start by introducing myself.

03:03:45.376 --> 03:03:46.697
My name is Cristina Cañaveral.

03:03:46.918 --> 03:03:55.445
And I stand before you as a biracial Latina and English language learner, a San Francisco native, and the incredibly proud founding director of community at the New School of San Francisco.

03:03:56.025 --> 03:04:06.728
And just a little background, Director of Community, I am both in charge of what is the recruitment of our student body as well as what happens with our student body and our families once they are in the building.

03:04:07.949 --> 03:04:22.233
So as the staff member that leads our recruitment efforts and our school-wide priority of diversifying our student body, I'm here to talk about the area of growth that has been pulled out by the CDE, which is ensuring that our program is accessible to all, in particular for low-income San Francisco families.

03:04:23.153 --> 03:04:32.901
I want to walk through what we have committed to and have done to date and we are excited that many of the strategies mirror the conditions of the CDE upon approval and that we accept those conditions.

03:04:33.561 --> 03:04:45.551
So these strategies include adding a preference to our lottery for FRPM eligible families, expanding on an equity-based transportation plan that can adapt to changing locations, since it's possible that we might change locations.

03:04:46.369 --> 03:04:57.873
and continuing our targeted outreach, widening access to information, and reducing, removing barriers for families that need it, such as pursuing, hopefully, continued collaboration with the district for a stable location for our school.

03:04:57.893 --> 03:05:10.137
I think it's important to note that our commitment to adding the preference, as we've already talked about, this is our fourth time coming to it, and we are, I am, and we all are, very thrilled to see this as a condition for approval.

03:05:10.257 --> 03:05:14.518
And yet, in the absence of this preference, here is what we're celebrating in our efforts,

03:05:17.031 --> 03:05:22.055
Last year we had two and a half times the number of FRPM eligible families as the number of open seats.

03:05:22.595 --> 03:05:26.097
Our acceptance rate for FRPM eligible families has grown to 90%.

03:05:27.378 --> 03:05:31.341
We also have a 90% retention rate from FRPM eligible families.

03:05:31.801 --> 03:05:36.905
We have a full-time staff person, that's me, focused on recruitment and community engagement.

03:05:36.945 --> 03:05:39.307
We have a full-time counselor and we have the

03:05:39.967 --> 03:05:49.755
30-plus hours of DEI professional development throughout the year for our staff so that they are able to implement it in their classrooms, in our after-school program, at recess, in morning care, everywhere.

03:05:50.936 --> 03:05:53.598
So you might ask what these intentional strategies are to recruit.

03:05:53.618 --> 03:05:56.701
Well, we recruit solely in underrepresented neighborhoods in San Francisco.

03:05:57.321 --> 03:06:08.410
As a San Francisco native, San Francisco, I know, is a highly segregated city with neighborhoods that have high concentrations of low-income families that are primarily located in the east and southeast sectors, as you can see on the map.

03:06:08.871 --> 03:06:09.992
That's where I grew up right there.

03:06:12.333 --> 03:06:15.275
So I know the neighborhoods that I am going out and recruiting in.

03:06:18.337 --> 03:06:18.637
Thank you.

03:06:18.717 --> 03:06:20.659
And this is where we go in this area.

03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.641
What are we doing when we recruit?

03:06:23.701 --> 03:06:29.084
First and foremost, we are building awareness and partnerships because we know that families listen to people that they know.

03:06:30.822 --> 03:06:36.805
In addition to working with well-known organizations and preschools that primarily serve low-income families, we go where families go.

03:06:37.006 --> 03:06:37.726
We go to parks.

03:06:38.106 --> 03:06:38.947
We go to libraries.

03:06:38.967 --> 03:06:40.427
We go to faith-based organizations.

03:06:40.447 --> 03:06:41.288
We go to food banks.

03:06:41.308 --> 03:06:43.689
We go to grocery stores, laundromats, and so much more.

03:06:44.070 --> 03:06:56.336
And when I say we, I just want to clarify that that is myself and my team, which is primarily staff and parent volunteers that go out at night, on weekends, on Sundays, throughout the entirety of the school year.

03:06:56.356 --> 03:06:57.937
This is a 12-month job.

03:06:59.824 --> 03:07:03.686
When we engage with families, we are working on building relationships and trust.

03:07:04.706 --> 03:07:10.149
And I want to pause here to highlight that San Francisco Unified is a district of choice and in a highly segregated city.

03:07:10.810 --> 03:07:15.312
This system of choice by default privileges those with the most access and resource to information.

03:07:15.772 --> 03:07:25.597
And our targeted strategies attempt to address this inequity by having multiple ways to apply on the phone, online, in person, with me, in paper, and it's available in multiple languages.

03:07:26.325 --> 03:07:33.789
We provide multiple personal touch points with families in order to provide as much information as possible throughout the application and the enrollment process.

03:07:34.189 --> 03:07:44.875
This ranges from text-based correspondence with the school application, talking to members of the leadership team, to other families at new school, to teachers are calling their phone banking families once they've applied.

03:07:44.915 --> 03:07:46.276
Do you have a question about our school?

03:07:46.556 --> 03:07:47.757
Would you like to come and tour?

03:07:47.777 --> 03:07:50.619
We give private tours to families that are FRPM eligible.

03:07:52.279 --> 03:07:53.100
And then we also have

03:07:53.536 --> 03:07:58.158
specific recruitment events where students and families can meet with and speak with members of our team and current families.

03:08:00.119 --> 03:08:00.439
Thank you.

03:08:00.860 --> 03:08:16.087
In the 10 years that I've been working with low-income families in San Francisco and across the United States, I believe that having these numerous touch points is necessary because when we think about families applying to school, especially for the first time, all families want the safe, supportive environment where their children can thrive.

03:08:17.363 --> 03:08:29.815
However, in addition to this, low income families, and I speak to this primarily as someone who was low income and now is no longer low income, but I think about what my father and what my mother needed when they were applying for schools.

03:08:30.755 --> 03:08:35.640
And so there are additional barriers that need to be addressed in order to succeed in a system of choice.

03:08:36.120 --> 03:08:42.346
Our touch points, our personal touch points, aim to specifically address the barriers that have most come up, which are,

03:08:43.018 --> 03:08:56.861
talking through our transportation plan with families, giving details on our afterschool program, which is either free or very low cost for all families that qualify for FRPM so that they know that there is a safe and consistent place for their children from 7.45 a.m.

03:08:57.281 --> 03:08:58.181
until 6 p.m.

03:08:58.621 --> 03:09:02.602
on professional development days and during breaks, because that really is helpful.

03:09:02.642 --> 03:09:08.323
And also, of course, a desire to pursue a stable facility in collaboration with the district, because a moving school

03:09:09.102 --> 03:09:12.865
places an additional barrier for working families and low-income families.

03:09:14.286 --> 03:09:27.815
And so I think with this slide, it's clear that the strategies that we have control over, that we have intentionally implemented and grown year upon year, have led to an overall increase in our applications for free and reduced priced eligible families.

03:09:29.656 --> 03:09:37.642
And yet when they're matched with the total number of applications without the structural change in our lottery, FRPM eligible families are not receiving as many offers

03:09:38.018 --> 03:09:39.399
and the randomness of our lottery.

03:09:40.019 --> 03:09:52.547
I want to pull out some of the things to note in this slide, which highlights our growth of FRPM eligible applications, which last year would have filled five kindergarten classrooms, as well as the exponential growth in applications overall.

03:09:53.334 --> 03:10:05.081
I've spoken at length about what we do for targeted outreach to see this number grow, but I want to point out that the vast majority of our general applications come solely from our website and word of mouth.

03:10:05.581 --> 03:10:05.901
That's it.

03:10:06.461 --> 03:10:09.703
We do nothing else additional for the general application.

03:10:09.883 --> 03:10:14.246
Our entire recruitment strategy is focused on FRPM eligible families.

03:10:15.086 --> 03:10:27.856
And so, we believe that with a strong foundation we've built, in addition to the lottery preference that ensures a floor for FRPM eligible families, we will see a meaningful shift in all aspects of our demographics from kindergarten through eighth grade.

03:10:29.437 --> 03:10:31.939
I hope that answered your question, and I'm happy to answer more.

03:10:31.979 --> 03:10:33.140
I just really needed to get through those.

03:10:35.010 --> 03:10:39.195
Thank you as expeditious as requested and very informative.

03:10:40.236 --> 03:10:53.310
So I think at this point we've gotten a lot of information on the table and I would be ready to entertain a motion if there is one on this part of the petition.

03:10:54.505 --> 03:11:17.010
So if I can, um, Lisa, maybe let's put up the recommendations again, just so people have it because I'm going to move the department's recommendation to approve the renewal with the conditions that they've requested, uh, having to do with the, um, incorporate the community engagement plan and element seven.

03:11:17.030 --> 03:11:18.350
I want to make sure I get all of these.

03:11:18.370 --> 03:11:20.631
Okay.

03:11:22.463 --> 03:11:39.410
And also to reflect the SBE as an authorizer and include the necessary language for Element 8 admission requirements to reorder the admission preferences to attempt to achieve a racial and ethnic balance that is reflective of San Francisco Unified.

03:11:39.470 --> 03:11:43.112
And I think you just saw in the chart what their hopes are about that.

03:11:44.452 --> 03:11:47.475
And the next page just shows what the preference would be.

03:11:47.735 --> 03:11:52.259
So by the adoption of the motion, that would be the preference.

03:11:53.060 --> 03:12:00.487
There's also a condition related to employee qualifications, which these are sort of technical changes and dispute resolution.

03:12:00.787 --> 03:12:02.449
So that's my motion.

03:12:02.589 --> 03:12:08.835
I would just also like to say that thanks to the folks that come and that I am proud that we authorize this school.

03:12:09.776 --> 03:12:14.479
and I would be proud to reauthorize it through this amendment or through this motion.

03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:16.821
Thank you.

03:12:17.102 --> 03:12:18.202
I will second that motion.

03:12:19.283 --> 03:12:19.584
Okay.

03:12:20.564 --> 03:12:21.505
Any further discussion?

03:12:22.926 --> 03:12:26.870
All those in favor, please both say aye and raise your hand so we can have a count.

03:12:28.451 --> 03:12:28.591
Aye.

03:12:29.832 --> 03:12:30.853
Any opposed say nay.

03:12:32.074 --> 03:12:32.855
Any abstentions?

03:12:33.475 --> 03:12:34.156
One abstention.

03:12:34.696 --> 03:12:36.017
All right, the motion passes.

03:12:36.097 --> 03:12:36.538
Thank you.

03:12:37.799 --> 03:12:38.059
Now,

03:12:42.159 --> 03:12:54.273
Now, our lunches are here, and we're going to take a little break and pick up our lunches and then take up the next part of the petition in about, let's say 12 o'clock.

03:12:54.813 --> 03:12:56.355
Let everyone take a little break.

03:12:57.597 --> 03:12:59.539
Yeah, and then we'll resume at 12 o'clock.

03:13:11.206 --> 03:13:12.227
Good afternoon.

03:13:16.750 --> 03:13:18.151
We're going to resume.

03:13:18.171 --> 03:13:24.656
Yeah.

03:13:24.936 --> 03:13:27.357
Do you want to speak to the overflow room?

03:13:27.398 --> 03:13:31.380
There is an overflow room, which is they would get to by going to the left.

03:13:32.721 --> 03:13:36.444
If there's not enough chairs, how would they get to the overflow room?

03:13:38.632 --> 03:13:47.795
Go out the door and turn left and then turn left again, pass the elevators and turn left again and you could have a chair there if there's not enough chairs here.

03:13:49.475 --> 03:13:50.916
Or wait right outside.

03:13:50.936 --> 03:13:53.517
Okay.

03:13:54.637 --> 03:13:58.418
Just so people can be comfortable for the next part of the conversation.

03:14:01.379 --> 03:14:03.380
And we'll

03:14:05.253 --> 03:14:08.416
Beg the indulgence of the audience as we eat in front of you.

03:14:10.218 --> 03:14:20.547
And we're going to start agenda item 18 for the New School of San Francisco, consideration of a material revision of the charter to change from kindergarten through grade five to kindergarten through grade eight.

03:14:22.409 --> 03:14:27.414
And Lisa Constancio of CDE will present the item.

03:14:29.155 --> 03:14:29.935
Okay, great.

03:14:30.035 --> 03:14:35.600
So as we mentioned, we're talking, this is the second item, which is the material revision.

03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:45.367
I will go through some of these slides, because they will be duplicative of what we've talked about earlier in the other slide, and get to the crux of what the material revision is.

03:14:45.928 --> 03:14:49.751
So in essence, the request is to expand.

03:14:49.911 --> 03:14:56.216
Now that we have renewed the K through five, this request is to expand the school to sixth through eighth grade.

03:14:57.036 --> 03:15:10.992
They're currently serving 288 students in grades K-5, and they're projecting to serve up to 468 if this material revision is approved and they're able to expand to grade 8 by 2024-25.

03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:24.165
So for material revisions, just very quickly, it's during the term of the charter, a school may request an amendment to its current approved charter.

03:15:24.966 --> 03:15:29.369
We took this item in two parts because the district had done that as well.

03:15:29.629 --> 03:15:36.193
San Francisco Unified looked at this in two pieces, so we also did the same, which is why this is a separate item.

03:15:37.353 --> 03:15:45.755
Amendments may only be made with the approval of the authority that granted the charter, and they're governed by standards and criteria set forth in 47605.

03:15:46.175 --> 03:15:49.215
And what I mean by that is we take a look at the whole picture again.

03:15:49.395 --> 03:15:57.537
So in essence, we've done that for the previous item, so there isn't really a lapse time here, but we do look at everything all over again.

03:15:57.577 --> 03:16:04.658
We look at the petition, we look at their financial standing, and we look at their overall ability to implement, so we take a look

03:16:20.711 --> 03:16:29.559
So we look at the entire package, once again, any time we receive a request for material revision.

03:16:29.579 --> 03:16:38.106
So the written findings, this slide is about 47605, which lays out the criteria that the governing board shall use to deny a petition.

03:16:38.726 --> 03:16:43.570
And so we'll deny a petition unless it meets one of these written findings.

03:16:44.291 --> 03:16:47.133
And as I mentioned, we look at educational soundness,

03:16:49.963 --> 03:17:01.011
pieces, here we go, aligned in the education, I knew I was live, I know I'm loud, but in the other pieces we then take a look at their charter elements as well as part of our review.

03:17:04.195 --> 03:17:21.765
The California Department of Education is proposing to recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request for a material revision for new school to change it from a K-5 to a K-8 based on the Education Code 47605 and the California Code of Regulations.

03:17:24.425 --> 03:17:28.728
We talked a little bit already about the background of the school, so I'm not going to get into this slide.

03:17:30.430 --> 03:17:40.156
One question I will say, one issue that I will bring up is that initially when the school was before us five years ago, they always did have the intention of being a K-12 school.

03:17:40.197 --> 03:17:46.961
That is where they ultimately would like to be, but the State Board approved a K-5, which is what we're dealing with today.

03:17:47.021 --> 03:17:49.123
So I just wanted to make that clarification.

03:17:53.256 --> 03:18:06.346
Okay, so the only thing I'll state on here is if the material, now that the board has approved the renewal for this school, if the material revision request is not approved by the board, the school will continue to operate as a K-5.

03:18:06.566 --> 03:18:08.548
So I just want to make sure I make that clarification.

03:18:10.635 --> 03:18:18.483
So our basis for recommendation is sound educational program and they're demonstrably likely to successfully implement the program.

03:18:19.584 --> 03:18:26.711
We will get into the additional conditions that CDE is recommending as part of this expansion.

03:18:27.091 --> 03:18:29.614
So I'll get into that a little further in the presentation.

03:18:33.746 --> 03:18:41.392
So one of the recommendations that we are, one of the conditions that we are recommending is an additional change to the admission preferences.

03:18:41.672 --> 03:18:45.135
And I got into this a little bit earlier when we were talking about the item.

03:18:46.236 --> 03:18:51.640
And also, and I'll just mention this here, when we went into the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools meeting,

03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:53.761
CDE was recommending denial.

03:18:54.221 --> 03:19:06.745
We did have some concerns about this school expanding, already knowing some of the issues that we had addressed and we had talked about under race and ethnic balance and also the admission preferences.

03:19:07.246 --> 03:19:18.790
So we continue to have concerns about whether if we recommended the school expand, if those issues would still be there and if the school would be able to serve the students of San Francisco Unified.

03:19:19.390 --> 03:19:30.738
So we listened to the Advisory Commission meeting, continued to talk to the practitioners and the petitioners, and since then have changed our recommendation to the board to recommend approval.

03:19:31.619 --> 03:19:42.724
And one of the additional conditions that we are recommending is that for the 2021 school lottery, so that the first preference will be the pupils eligible for free and reduced price meals.

03:19:42.784 --> 03:19:44.945
We've established that in the previous item.

03:19:45.445 --> 03:19:52.208
But we are also asking that the floor be set for the kindergartners and the sixth graders at 50%.

03:19:53.828 --> 03:20:00.191
So that is our additional condition that we are recommending to the board as part of the expansion of this school.

03:20:01.471 --> 03:20:05.345
And then the other admission preferences are the same as they were in the previous item.

03:20:08.385 --> 03:20:15.151
Okay, we also took a look at the community engagement plan, again, as we have continued to talk about that.

03:20:15.992 --> 03:20:25.880
One of the issues, or I would say one of the conversations at the Advisory Commission meeting that came up from the petitioner was that it was, one of the challenges was outreach.

03:20:26.441 --> 03:20:33.147
And outreach in terms of families being able to get to the school and some transportation issues that they were hearing in the community.

03:20:33.787 --> 03:20:41.832
So part of our recommendation is revising the community engagement plan to address some transportation challenges for prospective families.

03:20:42.232 --> 03:20:45.454
So we want them to take an active look in that as part of their outreach.

03:20:46.015 --> 03:20:50.237
And then we have two conditions that actually will fall upon CDE as part of our oversight.

03:20:50.698 --> 03:20:55.441
So we will do monthly updates on enrollment of the socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

03:20:56.221 --> 03:21:07.986
And on a monthly basis, or actually I think this is an annual basis, we are asking that after every lottery that the school report back to us what the racial and ethnic balance is of each of those lotteries.

03:21:08.086 --> 03:21:18.291
So we have even talked about going as far as attending the lottery to have a kind of firsthand experience of what's happening at the community level as well.

03:21:18.691 --> 03:21:22.493
And those things will be handled under our oversight responsibilities.

03:21:25.011 --> 03:21:33.374
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the petition for renewal and they did not move staff recommendation because we were recommending denial at the time.

03:21:33.474 --> 03:21:41.816
So the Advisory Commission moved to approve the material revision and on the vote of 6 to 1.

03:21:41.956 --> 03:21:44.697
So it was a 6 to 1 vote to move the material revision.

03:21:47.699 --> 03:21:50.723
So again, as part of our review, it's a material revision request.

03:21:51.343 --> 03:21:52.444
So we do a full review.

03:21:52.464 --> 03:21:56.930
I won't get into this slide, but we take a look at the entire package, as I mentioned earlier.

03:21:56.950 --> 03:22:04.718
We took a look at the educational program, their fiscal viability, which we talked about in the last item.

03:22:06.027 --> 03:22:07.427
their educational program.

03:22:07.808 --> 03:22:13.429
One thing I'll just call to your attention here is they are planning to expand one grade at a time.

03:22:13.549 --> 03:22:18.971
So they are really being process and thoughtful oriented about how they go about doing that.

03:22:19.411 --> 03:22:28.793
So for this coming school year they would add 6th grade, following year 7th grade and then 8th grade and continue with that through the end of the five-year term with the state board.

03:22:29.073 --> 03:22:34.335
So that is how they're recommending to expand over the 6th to 8th grade term.

03:22:35.632 --> 03:22:41.574
So they do have plans for a small community of 60 students for middle school to ensure a low people to teacher ratio.

03:22:43.714 --> 03:22:56.778
So in summary, we are recommending approval of the material revision based on their educational program, fiscal viability, and also the additional language that I mentioned in our recommendation here.

03:22:57.178 --> 03:23:00.939
And I can always go back to that slide if that's helpful.

03:23:03.533 --> 03:23:06.734
to see what the additional recommendations are that we are making.

03:23:06.834 --> 03:23:08.874
So they are here.

03:23:10.294 --> 03:23:12.395
I don't know the slide numbers.

03:23:12.435 --> 03:23:13.375
I apologize on this one.

03:23:13.415 --> 03:23:26.557
But towards the beginning of the presentation, here are the recommendations we're making, additional conditions under admission preferences on the community engagement plan, and then the additional roles we will play in terms of oversight as well.

03:23:28.137 --> 03:23:29.438
OK, that's the end of the presentation.

03:23:29.458 --> 03:23:31.118
Are there questions I can answer?

03:23:33.001 --> 03:23:36.323
We'll go ahead and hear from the petitioners first.

03:23:38.284 --> 03:23:40.866
So I hereby open the public hearing.

03:23:41.952 --> 03:23:43.533
at 1210 p.m.

03:23:44.534 --> 03:23:50.779
First, we'll hear from the petitioners who will have 10 minutes, then we'll hear from the county or districts that are opposing the material revision.

03:23:51.359 --> 03:23:53.001
They'll also have a total of 10 minutes.

03:23:53.741 --> 03:24:01.928
After the presentations from both sides, there will then be an opportunity for public comment from any individuals not already presented for one minute each.

03:24:03.289 --> 03:24:04.830
So, the petitioner.

03:24:04.850 --> 03:24:07.312
Okay.

03:24:07.352 --> 03:24:08.413
Do you want it up?

03:24:08.733 --> 03:24:09.093
Thank you.

03:24:22.273 --> 03:24:24.414
Great.

03:24:24.535 --> 03:24:25.555
Good afternoon, everyone.

03:24:26.436 --> 03:24:31.179
My name is Emily Kilduff, and I'm one of the co-founders and heads of school for the New School of San Francisco.

03:24:31.979 --> 03:24:35.942
It's a privilege to be back in front of many of you that we spoke to five years ago.

03:24:36.322 --> 03:24:38.604
Thank you for authorizing our school five years ago.

03:24:38.624 --> 03:24:44.087
And thank you for giving us the opportunity today to talk to you about the growth ahead.

03:24:44.647 --> 03:24:47.649
So behind me are all of our fifth graders.

03:24:48.750 --> 03:24:49.931
Can they all just quickly?

03:24:49.951 --> 03:24:51.012
Oh, they're going to wave their hands.

03:24:51.072 --> 03:24:51.272
Great.

03:24:52.453 --> 03:24:58.437
They are just coming from a tour of the Senate with Scott Wiener and some of them are in the overflow room as well.

03:24:59.358 --> 03:25:04.582
These are the faces of our founding first graders and our soon to be sixth graders.

03:25:05.523 --> 03:25:11.828
So they are here both to advocate for their school and to share their voice and story as well.

03:25:14.005 --> 03:25:23.234
And so when I think about them, I think about the path that they want to be on to ensure success in life.

03:25:23.374 --> 03:25:26.457
We think about beyond just academic readiness for our students.

03:25:26.517 --> 03:25:30.320
We know that being deeply reflective individuals is incredibly important.

03:25:30.400 --> 03:25:37.707
Understanding who they are as leaders, the skin they're in, their identity, and continuing to make meaning of their experience in life.

03:25:38.247 --> 03:25:47.353
so that they can work across lines of difference to solve big, messy problems, all in pursuit of making the world a more just place for all.

03:25:48.973 --> 03:25:49.834
So why middle school?

03:25:50.334 --> 03:25:51.135
Where does that fit in?

03:25:52.115 --> 03:25:54.317
So four key reasons, in our opinion, for the middle school.

03:25:54.397 --> 03:25:58.159
First and foremost, we've made a 13-year commitment to our students and families.

03:25:58.819 --> 03:26:12.851
So when we were here five years ago, we talked about a petition for K-12 and why that 13-year continuum is incredibly important for students, both to narrow an opportunity gap, but also to have a highly intentional and personalized approach with students.

03:26:13.691 --> 03:26:23.759
A lot of research, in fact, research by Linda Darling Hammond shows that a highly student-centered model is one of the fastest ways to narrow an opportunity gap, and that work takes time.

03:26:24.680 --> 03:26:26.362
The second reason is continuity.

03:26:26.922 --> 03:26:33.869
Our families have chosen a small school because it is highly personalized, it's inclusive, and it's inquiry-based.

03:26:34.069 --> 03:26:39.074
Many of our students will struggle in a more traditional, very large middle school.

03:26:40.171 --> 03:26:41.633
Third is stability for our families.

03:26:41.853 --> 03:26:44.456
San Francisco Unified has eight K-8 schools.

03:26:44.816 --> 03:26:49.001
They receive 596 more applications than they have spots for.

03:26:49.522 --> 03:26:53.787
Attrition in San Francisco is the highest from fifth to sixth grade in our city.

03:26:53.807 --> 03:26:58.232
So if we can eliminate that transition for families, we're doing an important service.

03:26:58.852 --> 03:27:02.595
Finally, in San Francisco, families need better middle school options.

03:27:03.216 --> 03:27:08.700
I'm going to show you the four closest middle schools to where we're located, Everett, James Lick, MLK, Willie Brown.

03:27:09.180 --> 03:27:13.884
You can see that all four are significantly underperforming, both the city and the state.

03:27:14.525 --> 03:27:24.633
I think it's also worth noting that the city at large, for English and math proficiency in our city, only half of our kids are reading and performing math at grade level.

03:27:28.075 --> 03:27:28.675
So what did we do?

03:27:28.716 --> 03:27:32.058
We started the middle school design process over a year and a half ago.

03:27:32.298 --> 03:27:40.324
We brought together a team of researchers, practitioners, parents to start asking really big important questions about the adolescent experience.

03:27:40.724 --> 03:27:43.846
What is fundamentally different about sixth through eighth grade?

03:27:43.866 --> 03:27:48.389
What is happening to our children's bodies and minds as they're going through this period of time?

03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:50.311
And then in turn, what does that mean they need?

03:27:50.511 --> 03:27:51.752
What do they need from curriculum?

03:27:51.772 --> 03:27:52.772
What do they need from peers?

03:27:52.812 --> 03:27:54.634
What do they need from the educators around them?

03:27:55.374 --> 03:28:02.037
I don't think I have time to go through every research insight we came to, but that's part of the reason we printed out the packets for you.

03:28:02.417 --> 03:28:08.900
Want you to have in the appendix some of the big research insights that our design team really centered our model around.

03:28:10.909 --> 03:28:14.632
So at a high level, here are some of the things that we believe our middle schoolers need.

03:28:15.092 --> 03:28:21.296
One, they need really safe space to continue that identity discovery and understanding of who they are.

03:28:21.696 --> 03:28:30.962
We know that adolescents can be particularly worried about who they are, and in particular, what other people think about them at this stage in their life.

03:28:31.022 --> 03:28:36.466
They are really working to build their own self-confidence and ask important questions about who am I?

03:28:37.126 --> 03:28:40.287
Who am I in the world, and what do others think of me?

03:28:41.168 --> 03:28:49.571
Collaborative and social, social environments are really, really important for middle schoolers, and opportunities to engage with peers and adults as well.

03:28:51.432 --> 03:28:53.533
Time, again, I mentioned the self-reflection.

03:28:54.253 --> 03:28:58.535
Middle schools are also asking this big question, I think I said, but like, why does what I'm doing matter?

03:28:58.915 --> 03:29:00.436
I'm not an adult yet, right?

03:29:00.496 --> 03:29:02.197
I can't vote, I can't drive, but I want to.

03:29:02.757 --> 03:29:07.622
And so I want to know that what I'm learning and what I'm doing has relevance in the world around me.

03:29:08.964 --> 03:29:09.684
So what does that mean?

03:29:09.885 --> 03:29:12.507
So we took those concepts and we thought about what do middle schoolers need?

03:29:12.567 --> 03:29:16.331
What are those big questions that they're asking themselves and trying to figure out about who they are?

03:29:16.892 --> 03:29:22.638
And then how does that translate into the design principles of a program in terms of curriculum and then day in the life?

03:29:24.019 --> 03:29:26.741
So here's some of our big design principles.

03:29:27.041 --> 03:29:28.482
Our inquiry program continues.

03:29:28.782 --> 03:29:36.346
We start with the next generation science standards, and then we build the curriculum and the inquiry and the big questions students are asking around those content standards.

03:29:36.967 --> 03:29:39.928
Our through line of social justice continues into middle school.

03:29:40.328 --> 03:29:49.194
We allow, again, time and space to have honest, real conversations about power, about white dominant systems, and about race, class, and privilege.

03:29:50.354 --> 03:29:53.217
The rigorous and personalized approach continues.

03:29:53.457 --> 03:30:03.985
So you heard earlier, every child at New School of San Francisco has an individualized learning plan with at least 10 personalized either habit or skill goals that we monitor progress.

03:30:04.005 --> 03:30:07.108
We come alongside families to build those goals and think about progress.

03:30:07.528 --> 03:30:08.149
We already have.

03:30:08.169 --> 03:30:12.212
So we have with our fifth graders five years of data and understanding.

03:30:12.652 --> 03:30:18.897
a holistic look at who they are as a person, what are their stretches, what are their growth areas, and what do they need to continue to be successful.

03:30:18.978 --> 03:30:25.763
We get the opportunity in a small school to continue building with all that institutional knowledge about how each child best learns.

03:30:27.244 --> 03:30:30.227
And the next is space to develop self and community.

03:30:30.467 --> 03:30:33.089
So we've thought a lot about an advisory program.

03:30:33.570 --> 03:30:40.716
We've partnered with the Institute for Social Emotional Learning to think about what does that space of the day need to look like in small environments

03:30:41.416 --> 03:30:45.580
for students to feel comfortable exploring and asking questions about themselves.

03:30:46.540 --> 03:31:07.477
And then finally, one of the things that gets me really excited, I forgot to mention, I started my career as a middle school math and science teacher, part of the reason I get very excited talking about middle school, that are clubs and specials, so lots of opportunities built into the model for children to try different things, challenge themselves, and figure out what are you really curious and excited about going deeper into.

03:31:09.744 --> 03:31:15.151
So this is where we were going to now talk about some of the conditions and our recruitment efforts.

03:31:15.452 --> 03:31:17.514
Christina's already taken us through.

03:31:17.534 --> 03:31:23.803
I'd love to just point out, and it might be helpful to point out, because now we're talking about sixth grade recruitment, which is

03:31:24.744 --> 03:31:26.444
pretty different from kindergarten recruitment.

03:31:26.464 --> 03:31:32.325
However, I truly believe that the foundation of what I laid out previously helps to grow that.

03:31:32.405 --> 03:31:36.546
So one thing I will note is that our fifth grade classes are our most diverse class.

03:31:36.586 --> 03:31:46.228
And so being able to add even more diversity to our fifth grade class when they go into sixth grade is going to be incredibly helpful to see that equity in action.

03:31:46.648 --> 03:31:51.089
If they are already doing it in practice every single day, and that will only grow more.

03:31:53.317 --> 03:32:00.460
When I talked about we will continue to recruit in underrepresented communities, however, the organizations change, right?

03:32:00.500 --> 03:32:03.602
So I'm not going to Head Start anymore because that is where preschoolers are.

03:32:03.682 --> 03:32:13.266
However, it is worth noting that many times when I go into a Head Start and I sit down with families and they talk, they're not just filling out one application for their new kindergarten.

03:32:13.286 --> 03:32:16.188
They're actually filling out one for their kindergarten student.

03:32:16.468 --> 03:32:16.948
And you know what?

03:32:17.048 --> 03:32:21.190
Also, I think my third grader and my incoming second grader would also benefit from this model.

03:32:22.010 --> 03:32:35.240
And so I think that I will continue to do that with my team and also switch up some of the organizations going to different places that primarily serve fifth graders, elementary school students, and adolescents in general.

03:32:35.480 --> 03:32:41.144
I think parks will still work because kids love to hang out at parks, especially knowing our fifth grade students.

03:32:43.223 --> 03:32:50.885
And I think that continuing to talk about removing and reducing barriers, building relationships, building trust is incredibly important.

03:32:50.945 --> 03:33:04.129
And I think highlighting the fact that I do not do this work alone and it is our families and our teachers that reflect the population as a whole of the city also come out with me and are able to talk.

03:33:05.748 --> 03:33:16.052
And I often say when I am recruiting that I can stand up here all day with families, with you all, and talk about the beauty that is hashtag new school magic.

03:33:16.652 --> 03:33:20.153
And I love it, and I am the director of community.

03:33:20.634 --> 03:33:22.494
But our families chose to be here.

03:33:22.674 --> 03:33:29.017
And so our families come with us to recruit, and they are our most important people when they are talking about.

03:33:29.537 --> 03:33:30.558
about our school, right?

03:33:30.858 --> 03:33:40.524
But again, when you think about barriers and access and those large number of applications without that preference, like families that have more money, well, they have more time, right?

03:33:40.564 --> 03:33:51.411
And so I need to cater and tailor my recruitment strategy to the families that I want to put in front of families that they want to come and talk to, right, in order to match what they need, right?

03:33:51.451 --> 03:33:57.255
Because they might be working all day long, or they might need to drop off their kids at a daycare in order to be able to do that.

03:33:57.295 --> 03:33:58.116
And so I really

03:33:58.456 --> 03:34:04.813
try to personalize it and make it as accessible as possible, both for those that are coming in the door and those that are already with us.

03:34:10.041 --> 03:34:14.664
We've already discussed this but same holds true for 6-8 as does K-5.

03:34:14.704 --> 03:34:16.565
We accept the conditions with open arms.

03:34:17.146 --> 03:34:30.075
We have been trying incredibly hard for four years to make a structural change to our lottery knowing that equity is not just hard work but it's disrupting systemic inequities and this allows us to do that.

03:34:30.115 --> 03:34:30.355
Thank you.

03:34:35.276 --> 03:34:38.182
And we will now take the opposition presentation.

03:34:56.298 --> 03:34:58.620
Hi, Mike Davis from San Francisco Unified again.

03:34:59.761 --> 03:35:02.223
I'd like to present in three parts.

03:35:02.363 --> 03:35:23.921
First, I'll just start by doing a recap of what's already been discussed by CDE staff in that San Francisco Unified staff looked at the renewal petition for New School San Francisco, which, of course, had been previously approved by this board on appeal and using the criteria

03:35:24.685 --> 03:35:30.366
we decided that we could make a determination on whether it should be renewed as a K-5.

03:35:30.446 --> 03:35:33.567
We could not make a determination on expansion to K-8.

03:35:34.107 --> 03:35:49.290
So we presented a two-part recommendation to our board to approve the renewal as K-5 based on academic performance primarily, and that the board deny the expansion to K-8.

03:35:51.684 --> 03:36:08.149
And the reasons for the recommendation for denial were basically that we felt that the school was demonstrably not able to carry out the plan as outlined to expand to K-8 in the petition.

03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:16.711
And we also felt that we really just did not have the ability to say we are renewing you as a K-8 when you've only been a K-5.

03:36:20.066 --> 03:36:26.611
That was our recommendation to the board and they approved the staff recommendation to deny the expansion.

03:36:27.511 --> 03:36:40.361
I would also add that as has been discussed here at length, the school had a mission of being diverse by design and has not been able to carry out that mission.

03:36:41.541 --> 03:36:42.762
I would also add that

03:36:44.383 --> 03:36:52.949
We have a charter school in the Mission area of San Francisco, which is adjacent to Paterno Hill near there.

03:36:54.470 --> 03:37:08.380
This school was originally denied by San Francisco, approved on appeal in 2010, I believe, by this board, and then approved for renewal by San Francisco Unified five years later.

03:37:09.603 --> 03:37:28.590
And that school mission preparatory has 82% Latinx student population, has 95% students of color, and is one of the highest achieving schools in the district for the great span that it serves.

03:37:28.990 --> 03:37:32.472
So we can see that it can happen.

03:37:35.069 --> 03:37:36.950
That's as far as what the staff looked at.

03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:46.614
Secondly, I'd like to read into the record a letter from another board member of San Francisco Unified School District, Rachel Norton.

03:37:49.181 --> 03:37:49.361
Ms.

03:37:49.401 --> 03:37:54.665
Norton states, I am deeply sorry that work commitments prevent me from delivering these remarks in person.

03:37:55.285 --> 03:38:04.712
Today, I'm urging the State Board of Education to uphold the original finding of the staff of the CDE to deny the K-8 expansion for New School San Francisco.

03:38:05.432 --> 03:38:15.760
It is crystal clear that New School, as it exists today and as it plans to exist tomorrow, represents a lack of educational benefit to focal students in San Francisco.

03:38:17.116 --> 03:38:18.437
Lopsided demographics.

03:38:18.817 --> 03:38:29.406
San Francisco Unified School District has a well-documented gap in achievement between white and Asian students and their African-American, Latino, and Samoan peers.

03:38:29.666 --> 03:38:31.848
This gap persists across income levels.

03:38:32.449 --> 03:38:45.640
Though leaders of New School of San Francisco have consistently claimed that their school is organized to serve low-income students of color, they are demonstrably serving a much higher percentage of white, middle-income students than the district as a whole.

03:38:46.340 --> 03:38:54.743
In 2018-19, New School SF's enrollment was 52% white compared to 14% for San Francisco Unified as a whole.

03:38:55.423 --> 03:39:07.108
Similarly, New School's percentage of students receiving free and reduced price meals was 11.5% compared with 54% eligible to receive free and reduced in the school district as a whole.

03:39:07.808 --> 03:39:25.873
Based on all achievement data available to the Board of Education, San Francisco Unified is demonstrably serving white, middle-income students well across their district school, and there is absolutely no data to suggest that New School is providing innovative or superior quality of education to the vast majority of students it is serving.

03:39:26.373 --> 03:39:34.776
There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that New School is making changes to their recruitment or engagement strategies to shift their current pattern of enrollment.

03:39:35.936 --> 03:39:37.997
Danger of displacing focal students.

03:39:38.357 --> 03:39:45.441
Originally, I received personal assurances from the founders that New School would not seek facilities from San Francisco Unified.

03:39:45.961 --> 03:39:52.985
Those assurances evaporated when the founders realized how expensive and difficult it would be to find private space in San Francisco.

03:39:53.505 --> 03:40:03.471
As a result, their ongoing facility requests have introduced a pattern of displacing students of color from their local schools and replacing those students with white, higher income students.

03:40:04.770 --> 03:40:08.051
lack of proof of the efficacy of a K-12 model.

03:40:08.451 --> 03:40:12.332
New School's original charter application called for a K-12 model.

03:40:12.632 --> 03:40:21.514
However, when the founders realized that they would not be able to get support for that grade configuration, they amended their original petition to be a K-5 school.

03:40:22.074 --> 03:40:33.057
At that time, I had the understanding that New School had no specific plans to change their grade configuration, so I was disappointed to see that they have again put forward a plan that calls for them to be a K-12 school.

03:40:34.177 --> 03:40:47.667
I'm aware of no data indicating that a K-12 model is superior to the K-8, 9-12 model utilized by the majority of the district's authorized charters, and certainly not for the particular population New School is serving.

03:40:48.247 --> 03:40:53.231
Thank you for your consideration for this vitally important matter to the students and families of San Francisco.

03:40:53.931 --> 03:40:54.652
Rachel Norton.

03:40:56.946 --> 03:41:01.331
Hi, OK, so I'm Commissioner Collins and I guess I just want to come back.

03:41:01.752 --> 03:41:05.296
I was I heard equity was at the heart of the school.

03:41:05.776 --> 03:41:10.742
I heard that repeated by folks who are testifying and even on the dais today.

03:41:10.762 --> 03:41:12.584
And I respectfully disagree.

03:41:12.604 --> 03:41:14.826
Ibram X. Kendi is book

03:41:15.547 --> 03:41:19.892
on anti-racism says we can't be defining racism based on people's intentions.

03:41:20.332 --> 03:41:22.174
We have to be basing them on actions.

03:41:22.854 --> 03:41:25.717
And it's not also about individual feelings.

03:41:26.098 --> 03:41:30.282
It's about actual systems and policies and the impact that they have.

03:41:31.203 --> 03:41:35.827
Plans and attempts don't mean anything to black families in SFUSD

03:41:36.588 --> 03:41:43.194
on the African-American Parent Advisory Council who have repeatedly said they do not want any new schools.

03:41:43.674 --> 03:41:48.358
They want the district to invest in our traditionally underserved schools.

03:41:48.979 --> 03:41:57.126
And what is very concerning to me is when we hear all this language about how we're questioning white dominance,

03:41:57.506 --> 03:42:13.504
that there's a failure of new school founders to see that they are collectively exercising their political power in order to hoard resources and displace students that do not have the power or the resources to be present today.

03:42:14.685 --> 03:42:16.807
I reached out to several family members.

03:42:16.847 --> 03:42:18.107
There are people who have to work.

03:42:18.407 --> 03:42:25.291
There's people who have to take their kids to school, people who live in public housing, people who don't even know that this body exists.

03:42:25.611 --> 03:42:26.912
And they are not here today.

03:42:27.212 --> 03:42:29.293
But they do show up at our board meetings.

03:42:29.613 --> 03:42:31.114
And they make their voices heard.

03:42:31.574 --> 03:42:39.739
And by moving this important discussion into this room right here, we're effectively removing their voice.

03:42:40.459 --> 03:42:44.442
And it has direct impacts on them and their children.

03:42:46.003 --> 03:42:51.127
Before I finish, I just want to note, there's a lot of statements that this is a needed school.

03:42:51.488 --> 03:42:53.149
My children have gone through the system.

03:42:53.209 --> 03:42:57.052
They are currently attending Ruth Asawa School of the Arts, which is a small school.

03:42:57.512 --> 03:42:58.333
in SFUSD.

03:42:58.373 --> 03:43:04.698
It only serves 800 kids and they're getting a specialized program where they get 10 hours a week of arts instruction.

03:43:05.038 --> 03:43:12.003
My daughter identifies as a lesbian and she's actively involved and feels very supported in her school.

03:43:12.944 --> 03:43:16.847
We have a trans queer youth advisory commission in our district.

03:43:17.187 --> 03:43:19.188
Many of our middle schools have queer

03:43:19.969 --> 03:43:22.651
queer Q groups where students get support.

03:43:23.052 --> 03:43:27.675
And we also have gender and sexuality alliances at many of our schools.

03:43:27.936 --> 03:43:30.698
This is not a new thing that the new school is offering.

03:43:31.078 --> 03:43:36.783
So to say that they're offering something that we don't already provide, we have over 70 elementary schools.

03:43:37.003 --> 03:43:41.487
My daughters attended a small elementary school in our neighborhood, and we had many to choose from.

03:43:41.767 --> 03:43:43.468
So they're not offering anything new.

03:43:43.808 --> 03:43:56.473
What they're doing is they're providing an opportunity for families who want to avoid schools that they may be concerned about to kind of hoard resources and, in effect, displace communities that are most needy of these resources.

03:43:57.613 --> 03:43:59.134
I just want to finish by saying that

03:43:59.874 --> 03:44:11.519
in our district we are committed to pooling our resources on the most needy students and when we have schools like the new school expand they will be displacing services and resources.

03:44:11.759 --> 03:44:25.285
We are maxed out in terms of space and we have enough space to meet the need of the demand for students in middle school but when we don't need a new school and communities of color are not asking for new schools and

03:44:27.860 --> 03:44:32.061
This new school has shown that they have not designed an integrative school serving our focal students.

03:44:32.101 --> 03:44:36.503
They have repeatedly broken promises about whether they're going to use our space.

03:44:36.863 --> 03:44:43.706
They are not serving their majority white student body better than SFUSD, and they are taking resources directly from our students.

03:44:45.427 --> 03:45:05.541
If you vote for them, if you vote for their expansion, that means if they expand, they're either going to expand into international school or we're going to have to push them into a school that is currently using extra space to serve needy students in family rooms and in terms of all the additional support services and wellness centers and homeless services and things that we provide them.

03:45:05.921 --> 03:45:07.282
So I urge you to vote no.

03:45:07.402 --> 03:45:08.583
Thank you for your time.

03:45:13.439 --> 03:45:18.063
Okay, I think we are ready now for public comment.

03:45:19.344 --> 03:45:23.287
So, we'll take public comment at one minute per person.

03:45:23.948 --> 03:45:25.069
Are there any public comments?

03:45:25.209 --> 03:45:27.731
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

03:45:28.152 --> 03:45:33.776
Lawrence Chung, Rob Strain, Joel Leyva, Elizabeth Ortiz, Janelle Rooley,

03:45:34.537 --> 03:45:52.484
Asta Venkovate, Eric Premack, Ellery Clem, Micah Myers, Roberto Enriquez, Callum Guerney, Allison Collins, Julie Roberts-Fung, Misha Vietuya, and Marjorie Alvarado and Irma Acampo.

03:45:54.284 --> 03:45:54.585
Thank you.

03:45:54.605 --> 03:45:57.726
Please state your name and affiliation for the record when you begin.

03:45:58.126 --> 03:45:58.486
Yes, hi.

03:45:58.546 --> 03:46:00.247
Lawrence Chung, New School San Francisco.

03:46:01.519 --> 03:46:03.802
Thank you, Commissioners, for allowing me to speak.

03:46:04.563 --> 03:46:11.931
As a Chinese immigrant who successfully completed a three-year English as a Second Language program in a public school,

03:46:13.243 --> 03:46:16.025
I was initially very skeptical of a charter school.

03:46:16.246 --> 03:46:23.732
I was afraid that the charter schools would siphon away resources critical to our other public schools.

03:46:24.192 --> 03:46:34.100
But what changed my mind was when my son was ultimately diagnosed with severe ADHD and did very poorly in school.

03:46:35.720 --> 03:46:42.184
He had a condition so severe that we had to remove all the furniture from his room for his own safety.

03:46:42.664 --> 03:46:49.548
His original school was unable to have the adequate resources to support him.

03:46:50.188 --> 03:46:54.711
So we took a chance on New School because of its philosophy of inclusiveness.

03:46:56.226 --> 03:46:59.309
Four years later, I'm looking at a different child.

03:47:00.169 --> 03:47:04.493
One who can not only succeed as class, but thrives as an individual.

03:47:04.833 --> 03:47:05.474
I'm so proud.

03:47:06.234 --> 03:47:10.317
I hope you'll render your decision not based on politics and reapprove our school.

03:47:10.578 --> 03:47:10.798
Thank you.

03:47:36.184 --> 03:47:38.947
Hi, my name is Shoal, and I'm in fifth grade.

03:47:39.608 --> 03:47:41.029
I have ADHD and Tourette's.

03:47:42.411 --> 03:47:48.437
New School has helped me in making an environment that's really helpful and supportive in the way that I can learn.

03:47:49.518 --> 03:47:52.141
For example, they let me listen to music while I do my work.

03:47:53.002 --> 03:47:56.785
I can walk around or lay on the floor if I can't stand still because of my ADHD.

03:48:02.874 --> 03:48:10.062
I have tools to pay attention that other type of schools maybe wouldn't allow for me or others like working with the music on.

03:48:12.324 --> 03:48:16.970
The teachers at New School support us and guide us to understand any school problem.

03:48:18.447 --> 03:48:24.952
When I get shy or embarrassed because of my tics they support me and help me overcome it and help me talk it out with my friends.

03:48:26.633 --> 03:48:28.415
My favorite part of the day is science.

03:48:29.355 --> 03:48:31.837
Learning about historical events like the space race.

03:48:32.998 --> 03:48:34.219
It makes me want to learn more.

03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:37.001
I love how we all grew into a community.

03:48:39.963 --> 03:48:40.384
Together.

03:48:40.764 --> 03:48:42.966
And that's why I want new school to be my middle school.

03:48:43.806 --> 03:48:46.408
I want to keep learning and growing with my community.

03:48:47.049 --> 03:48:47.369
Thank you.

03:48:52.281 --> 03:49:00.285
Hello, my name is Lizbeth Luna, and I stand here before you as an advocate for New School and as a proud Charter High School graduate.

03:49:00.885 --> 03:49:06.788
I can relate to New School's fight to stay open and continue giving an alternative education to their students.

03:49:07.408 --> 03:49:16.573
I was at a public high school in San Francisco, close to dropping out, lost in between so many students, when I found Metropolitan Tech, a charter school.

03:49:17.233 --> 03:49:20.295
Finding Metro saved my future and my education.

03:49:20.895 --> 03:49:29.141
I see so many parallels with how New School functions because I, too, was finally taught to value education and learn to love it at Metro.

03:49:29.881 --> 03:49:33.484
As with New School, students and teachers had a close relationship.

03:49:33.804 --> 03:49:36.425
There was always an open door and a lending ear.

03:49:37.146 --> 03:49:44.431
It was there that I was granted hands-on opportunities through internships in the ER and midwifery, and I found my passion.

03:49:45.171 --> 03:49:57.443
Kids don't all learn the same way, as my nephew Joel has just attested to, but all can be given the chance to excel no matter their background, and that's why New School needs to be given the opportunity to do just that.

03:49:57.883 --> 03:49:58.244
Thank you.

03:50:06.874 --> 03:50:13.097
Hi my name is Ellery Clem and I'm a fifth grader and a founding student at the New School of San Francisco.

03:50:13.737 --> 03:50:15.458
I believe you should approve our middle school.

03:50:15.938 --> 03:50:27.743
There are a lot of reasons why I love my school but one thing that makes it special is how hard our teachers work to know every student individually so that they can challenge and support each kid at a just right level no matter what.

03:50:28.726 --> 03:50:35.208
Having more teachers in classrooms means that while one is teaching, the other can work with individuals or lead small groups.

03:50:35.948 --> 03:50:43.751
This allows kids to work on different levels or topics so that everyone stays interested and engaged, letting everyone pay better attention and have more fun.

03:50:44.351 --> 03:50:50.733
Our teachers know us and don't just tell us what to do, but interact with us and ask us questions about ourselves, our families, and how we are doing.

03:50:51.353 --> 03:50:56.515
They also give us lots of options and strategies to show our work so we can understand what we're doing in a way that works for us.

03:50:57.496 --> 03:50:59.542
Everyone's unique learning style is respected.

03:50:59.642 --> 03:51:01.949
Valuing our differences makes us stronger as a community.

03:51:02.370 --> 03:51:03.975
Please renew our kind and friendly school.

03:51:04.176 --> 03:51:04.537
Thank you.

03:51:15.922 --> 03:51:19.688
My name is Michael Myers and I'm 12 years old and in 5th grade.

03:51:20.028 --> 03:51:21.330
Here is my story of New School.

03:51:21.690 --> 03:51:24.535
I came to New School in 2nd grade and I think it is very helpful.

03:51:24.895 --> 03:51:26.598
I noticed it was different than my old school.

03:51:26.878 --> 03:51:28.480
At my old school I got into a street.

03:51:28.921 --> 03:51:30.343
I've never been in a street here.

03:51:30.864 --> 03:51:31.425
Sometimes

03:51:32.646 --> 03:51:39.290
Things are really hard still but even when it's frustrating my teachers hold me to high expectations because they love me.

03:51:39.751 --> 03:51:42.312
I should be treated like everyone else not different.

03:51:42.772 --> 03:51:46.695
I've been in foster care for five years and new school has been there for me.

03:51:47.255 --> 03:51:50.177
I want that community to stick with me in middle school.

03:51:50.617 --> 03:51:56.861
I don't think school would be the same for me if I went to a different school for middle school.

03:51:57.361 --> 03:51:58.202
Thank you for listening.

03:52:06.397 --> 03:52:08.919
Good afternoon members of the State Board of Education.

03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:14.245
My name is Roberto I am 10 years old and I have been at the New School of San Francisco for five years.

03:52:14.685 --> 03:52:22.232
A couple of reasons I would like to keep the New School of San Francisco to be open from kindergarten all the way until middle school is because everything

03:52:23.073 --> 03:52:25.196
Every three months we do this thing called Expo.

03:52:25.476 --> 03:52:33.025
Expo is this thing that we get picked up from school and later our parents come to school with us and we show our projects and everything we have worked on.

03:52:33.346 --> 03:52:38.892
For example, this year I was able to build and code Lego robots and I'm not sure most schools do that.

03:52:39.353 --> 03:52:41.716
My final reason is that since I was in first grade,

03:52:42.216 --> 03:52:49.124
At the new school of San Francisco all the teachers want to know all about us from what we like to don't like.

03:52:49.484 --> 03:52:52.487
This way they are able to support us in every way possible.

03:52:53.188 --> 03:52:55.511
Please consider expanding new school for middle school.

03:52:55.691 --> 03:52:56.492
Thank you for listening.

03:53:03.615 --> 03:53:04.195
Good afternoon.

03:53:04.936 --> 03:53:14.299
My name is Rob Strain, and I'm a longtime San Francisco resident, a former educator with SFUSD, and a member of the original design team that helped to imagine and launch New School San Francisco.

03:53:15.039 --> 03:53:23.482
Through a national nonprofit, Transcend, and now an independent practice, I support districts and school communities across the country who are seeking to build the future of K-12 education.

03:53:23.502 --> 03:53:32.346
About 18 months ago, I was asked to help facilitate a dedicated group of educators, parents, and community members here at the school in designing their middle school.

03:53:33.126 --> 03:53:36.807
During this journey, the team conducted extensive interviews with students and families.

03:53:36.927 --> 03:53:39.948
They visited schools across the state to learn from the best out there.

03:53:40.588 --> 03:53:44.449
They dug into the learning science, especially the nuances of adolescent development.

03:53:45.209 --> 03:53:48.870
All of this led to cycles of design, piloting, and feedback from the school community.

03:53:49.731 --> 03:54:01.694
I can tell you confidently that the middle school proposed here honors the best of what New School SF is today and represents a unique model that can inspire others across the country and create a proof point of equitable education with the diverse learning community.

03:54:02.134 --> 03:54:02.414
Thank you.

03:54:08.649 --> 03:54:12.591
Good afternoon Board President Darling-Hammond and Board Members and Happy New Year to all of you.

03:54:12.771 --> 03:54:16.253
My name is Janelle Rooley and I am an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Minnie and Core.

03:54:16.674 --> 03:54:21.156
We are here today in strong support of the CDE's recommendation to approve this material revision.

03:54:21.857 --> 03:54:25.539
I think though that all of us are maybe using material revision in air quotes today.

03:54:25.559 --> 03:54:33.663
As you have heard from the CDE, from San Francisco Unified, what new school submitted to San Francisco Unified was a renewal?

03:54:34.924 --> 03:54:43.014
Because as our office was here five years ago when the school was originally approved by the State Board, this school was always imagined to be a K-12.

03:54:43.595 --> 03:54:44.737
That was always the intent.

03:54:44.997 --> 03:54:53.027
The State Board members at the time, some of whom are still State Board members, understood that when they were voting to approve it, they knew what they were voting for.

03:54:54.128 --> 03:54:55.329
It was explicitly acknowledged.

03:54:56.250 --> 03:54:59.513
The plan for growth for this school always included checkpoints.

03:54:59.693 --> 03:55:05.919
And the first checkpoint comes at this first renewal as it's expanding into K-12, sorry, into 6-8.

03:55:06.719 --> 03:55:14.386
What I want to say is that our decision today is properly contextualized as continuing on with the plan that was already laid out there.

03:55:14.646 --> 03:55:15.227
Thank you very much.

03:55:22.489 --> 03:55:27.835
Good afternoon my name is Callum C. Gurney and I'm a founding fifth grader at the New School of San Francisco.

03:55:28.576 --> 03:55:30.558
New School is a sanctuary for learners.

03:55:31.098 --> 03:55:37.465
If New School had a middle school we'd be learning at the same school, the same friends, the same teachers, and the same teachings.

03:55:38.146 --> 03:55:41.470
Today I am here to talk about diversity and curriculum.

03:55:41.911 --> 03:55:46.116
Firstly, we are a diverse school and not just in terms of race and ethnicity.

03:55:46.577 --> 03:55:51.283
We are all diverse learners as sometimes we learn different things tailored to match our abilities.

03:55:52.405 --> 03:55:55.989
Me personally, New School is the most diverse school I've ever attended.

03:55:57.324 --> 03:56:00.646
And then there's curriculum, or more importantly, ILPs.

03:56:01.346 --> 03:56:04.448
As I said before, we learn different things and have different goals.

03:56:05.189 --> 03:56:09.992
One of my goals is that I need to work on explaining strategies in a way that others can understand.

03:56:10.652 --> 03:56:17.376
Please approve our petition to start a K-8 school to help teach more kids.

03:56:17.756 --> 03:56:18.497
Thank you so much.

03:56:25.498 --> 03:56:28.139
Good afternoon and thank you for having your hearts open.

03:56:28.659 --> 03:56:29.939
My name is Asta Ben Slavida.

03:56:30.119 --> 03:56:31.780
I'm a proud founding parent of New School.

03:56:32.180 --> 03:56:34.181
The school is keeping us here in California.

03:56:34.621 --> 03:56:35.321
I'm an immigrant.

03:56:35.641 --> 03:56:37.782
I came to this country with $50 in my pocket.

03:56:38.202 --> 03:56:40.342
We used to qualify for reduced price lunch.

03:56:40.823 --> 03:56:41.723
Now we're doing much better.

03:56:42.583 --> 03:56:46.284
When we needed it the most, New School offered us low-cost aftercare.

03:56:46.764 --> 03:56:50.225
Their true dedication to equity allowed us to work and better our lives.

03:56:50.605 --> 03:56:51.885
No one wants to stay poor forever.

03:56:52.525 --> 03:56:54.306
New School is the best place for both of my kids.

03:56:54.766 --> 03:56:56.166
My son is an anxious fifth grader.

03:56:56.446 --> 03:57:02.108
I wanted him to overcome his anxieties in a safe place to learn how to listen with respect and talk with kindness.

03:57:02.848 --> 03:57:08.413
My daughter, a third grader, has a speech delay IEP and struggles with analytical processing and speech development.

03:57:09.154 --> 03:57:12.797
Because of New School's inclusion model, our goal proudly presents her opinions.

03:57:13.057 --> 03:57:14.458
She knows no one will laugh at her.

03:57:15.039 --> 03:57:18.742
The school nurtures kids with special needs by allowing them to shine their own light.

03:57:19.482 --> 03:57:21.844
New School is the only middle school I want for my kids.

03:57:22.245 --> 03:57:24.787
I know they will be seen, understood, and supported here.

03:57:25.468 --> 03:57:29.731
So many families leave the public schools in middle school because of the lack of options.

03:57:30.132 --> 03:57:30.412
Thank you.

03:57:38.018 --> 03:57:41.863
Good afternoon my name is Marjorie and my name is Irma.

03:57:42.103 --> 03:57:44.866
We are fifth grade students from the New School of San Francisco.

03:57:44.906 --> 03:57:51.474
We want New School to have a middle school and keep growing because New School supports us and they're always there for us even when we're having bad days.

03:57:51.954 --> 03:57:56.860
We have been in New School for five years and because of their help of our teachers we have been learning a lot.

03:57:57.236 --> 03:58:01.058
like multiplication, division, and what a genre is, and so much more.

03:58:01.779 --> 03:58:07.442
When I entered the New School, my teachers and my classmates supported me with my English.

03:58:08.383 --> 03:58:13.085
Everyone welcomes you at New School, and that makes every day awesome and gives us a lot of energy to learn.

03:58:13.786 --> 03:58:17.568
Now we really want New School to keep helping us build our dreams and our future.

03:58:17.588 --> 03:58:18.208
Thank you.

03:58:28.168 --> 03:58:32.991
Good afternoon my name is Misha Villatuya and this is my first year teaching at New School San Francisco.

03:58:33.731 --> 03:58:36.293
At my previous school nearly every student looked like me.

03:58:36.933 --> 03:58:40.375
I used to believe those were the students whose futures I needed to be prioritizing.

03:58:40.975 --> 03:58:48.680
I know now that we are all at risk if we don't intentionally work to bridge the racial and cultural divides that inhibit us from making our world a better and more just place.

03:58:49.520 --> 03:58:54.041
As a child, I attended racially and socioeconomically diverse schools, and I'm better because of it.

03:58:54.601 --> 03:58:57.782
I'm culturally fluid, quick to empathize with others, able to compromise.

03:58:58.222 --> 03:59:03.243
These qualities are gifts, gifts the students I taught in a racially isolated school didn't have access to.

03:59:04.103 --> 03:59:07.124
I took a pay cut to go from an assistant principal to a classroom teacher.

03:59:07.724 --> 03:59:17.446
My commute increased from 30 minutes to two hours to be part of a school I believe is on the cutting edge of equity and inclusion, and I couldn't be more comfortable and excited and confident about my decision.

03:59:18.326 --> 03:59:25.796
Of the fifth graders I teach, 25% have IEPs or five or fours, 13% are English learners, and 52% are children of color.

03:59:26.317 --> 03:59:28.660
It's the most diverse group of students I've ever taught.

03:59:29.361 --> 03:59:34.328
Every day we have tough, real conversations about race, privilege, and equity, and it gives me hope for a brighter future.

03:59:34.568 --> 03:59:34.849
Thank you.

03:59:40.538 --> 03:59:42.621
Ramel Antoine, Charter Schools Association.

03:59:42.641 --> 03:59:48.969
Again, coming to you to urge your support of New Schools K-8 grade configuration.

03:59:48.989 --> 03:59:52.153
We are talking a little bit about equity here.

03:59:52.193 --> 03:59:58.181
I heard conversation a little bit before, and I want to really highlight something that we're glossing over.

03:59:59.175 --> 04:00:04.157
We look at San Francisco as a whole district, and what we talk about are numbers as being in terms of the demographic enrollment.

04:00:04.677 --> 04:00:11.380
If you look at the data of San Francisco schools by themselves, there are no schools that actually align with that even bar, right?

04:00:11.400 --> 04:00:18.123
So we have schools that are having a high number of these students that we're talking about and really skewing that line.

04:00:18.863 --> 04:00:23.986
I want to point out one school in particular, and that's the Arutasawa School of the Arts.

04:00:24.426 --> 04:00:32.551
I call that school out because Commissioner Collins just talked about that school as her daughter going to as being a paragon of success, a school that we know is doing well by the students that are there.

04:00:33.551 --> 04:00:35.332
That school is currently enrolling

04:00:37.013 --> 04:00:41.197
8% African-American students, and about 15% Latino students.

04:00:42.157 --> 04:00:50.564
When we talk about an equity problem, that's the equity problem that we're talking about, where we hold charter schools, one discrete school, to mean an entire district, when no school in the district does that.

04:00:51.164 --> 04:00:54.267
But we know that we say yes, charter schools say yes to accountability.

04:00:54.747 --> 04:01:00.772
And this school has done so by asking CDE multiple times for a material revision.

04:01:01.052 --> 04:01:02.053
And so I urge your support.

04:01:02.273 --> 04:01:02.794
Think about that.

04:01:07.742 --> 04:01:10.183
With the following speakers, please line up at the podium.

04:01:12.484 --> 04:01:24.729
Seth Chastain, Kristen Devine, Roxana Aguilar, Sandy Ciracio and Sierra Wang, Wendy Conway, Mariana Carrillo, Ophelia Chapman, and Lauren Berry.

04:01:24.749 --> 04:01:28.230
Go ahead.

04:01:33.973 --> 04:01:35.334
Good afternoon state board.

04:01:35.714 --> 04:01:37.515
My name is Seth Chastain Jr.

04:01:37.835 --> 04:01:41.156
and I am multiracial Spanish bilingual fifth grader at New School.

04:01:41.676 --> 04:01:46.599
My younger brother and I are new this year but from day one I loved it and felt like I belonged there.

04:01:47.299 --> 04:01:53.042
At my previous school I would distract myself and take a long time to do my work because I was not challenged.

04:01:54.362 --> 04:01:59.084
At New School we use inquiry and my teachers create groups that challenge me at just the right level.

04:01:59.645 --> 04:02:00.585
I'm always learning.

04:02:02.688 --> 04:02:06.892
I am thankful to have three amazing teachers who give us their best selves every day.

04:02:07.373 --> 04:02:09.676
They inspire me to be my best self each day.

04:02:10.577 --> 04:02:12.138
On days that I need extra support,

04:02:13.470 --> 04:02:19.735
They check in with me and my parents and together we come up with tools that help me grow as a learner and as a person.

04:02:20.836 --> 04:02:23.377
I can't imagine going anywhere else for middle school.

04:02:24.038 --> 04:02:31.203
State board members please say yes to give us the opportunity to grow and thrive as new school as new school middle schoolers.

04:02:31.584 --> 04:02:31.944
Thank you.

04:02:41.330 --> 04:02:41.970
Good afternoon.

04:02:42.791 --> 04:02:44.151
My name is Kristen Devine.

04:02:44.592 --> 04:02:51.016
In addition to being a director of special education I am part of the founding families at New School with a son in the fifth grade.

04:02:51.797 --> 04:03:00.983
In changing schools after kindergarten I desire to change my son's school experience to be one where he was supported through challenges and recognized for his accomplishments.

04:03:01.703 --> 04:03:02.524
I struck gold.

04:03:03.344 --> 04:03:10.269
New School's intentional focus on social emotional learning with adherence to nurturing core values has been inspirational.

04:03:11.570 --> 04:03:21.454
I have watched one of the most neuro diverse classes of students grow in their understanding of difference and capacity for kindness unprecedented in my 25 year career.

04:03:22.274 --> 04:03:26.837
New School has been unwavering in their pursuit to change how we educate the next generation.

04:03:27.277 --> 04:03:30.078
They have much to share to improve our current approach.

04:03:30.638 --> 04:03:37.442
I hope you vote to allow their educational change journey to continue not only for my son's benefit but to shape the future of our education.

04:03:37.982 --> 04:03:38.282
Thank you.

04:03:44.875 --> 04:03:45.495
Good afternoon.

04:03:45.535 --> 04:03:53.080
My name is Roxana Aguilar, and I'm a mother of two wonderful kids, as Ian, 10, and Ethan, five years old.

04:03:54.100 --> 04:03:57.302
And we are a new family in a new school, San Francisco.

04:03:57.602 --> 04:04:02.805
And honestly, it's been very happy to be part of this great family.

04:04:03.926 --> 04:04:06.688
My children are treated with love and respect.

04:04:07.108 --> 04:04:13.512
The teachers and absolutely all the staff really care about the education and welfare of my children.

04:04:14.352 --> 04:04:19.055
We previously were in another elementary school.

04:04:19.636 --> 04:04:21.157
Experience there wasn't good.

04:04:21.837 --> 04:04:26.641
My son constantly come home frustrated, angry, and feeling bad.

04:04:27.501 --> 04:04:33.005
When asked to speak to the principal to ask for help, it was difficult to talk with him.

04:04:33.345 --> 04:04:37.628
He never had time and we could finally talk to him.

04:04:38.009 --> 04:04:39.890
He finally left me talking alone.

04:04:42.463 --> 04:04:50.847
And one of the meetings, he told me, if I don't give a medicine to my son, wasn't that much they can do for him.

04:04:51.928 --> 04:04:52.208
Time.

04:04:52.288 --> 04:04:54.869
Thank you so much.

04:04:54.929 --> 04:05:00.352
And I'm telling you, my kid has been very happy to be in this school, and it's been changing our lives.

04:05:00.672 --> 04:05:00.992
Thank you.

04:05:07.591 --> 04:05:08.532
Hi, my name is Sarah.

04:05:08.652 --> 04:05:10.814
Our family has been at the new school for five years.

04:05:11.514 --> 04:05:16.078
You have heard a lot today about diversity, equity, and inclusion and the commitment of this school.

04:05:16.159 --> 04:05:19.982
And I am here to tell you that this commitment runs deep and it runs wide.

04:05:20.783 --> 04:05:24.886
Our community believes that equity means that every child gets what every child needs.

04:05:25.327 --> 04:05:25.927
And you know what?

04:05:25.967 --> 04:05:27.749
That has been tough for some families.

04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:30.571
Families that are used to putting their own kids' needs first.

04:05:30.932 --> 04:05:34.515
Kids who are used to thinking that fair means everybody gets the same thing.

04:05:34.935 --> 04:05:37.937
But this is the tough learning about equity happening at New School every day.

04:05:38.758 --> 04:05:45.563
Our school is a community that supports inclusion by normalizing accommodations, and boy, have we heard that from a lot of families today.

04:05:46.063 --> 04:05:46.624
And you know what?

04:05:46.784 --> 04:05:50.026
Our community is a community that wants diversity.

04:05:50.587 --> 04:06:01.895
We want it because all kids deserve the rich, deep, joyful learning that is happening at New School, and because diversity leads to better outcomes for all kids, including kids that live and look like mine.

04:06:02.976 --> 04:06:12.488
And because in these troubled times, nothing feels more important than raising minds that value others and that listen to difference and that are comfortable and enjoy it.

04:06:12.748 --> 04:06:13.890
That's what New School's doing.

04:06:21.144 --> 04:06:24.625
Good afternoon my name is Sandy and my name is Sierra.

04:06:24.806 --> 04:06:27.547
We are fifth graders at the new school of San Francisco.

04:06:27.867 --> 04:06:31.028
We came here today to talk about why there should be a middle school.

04:06:31.488 --> 04:06:34.189
When I first came to new school I was a very shy kid.

04:06:34.669 --> 04:06:40.512
I hated talking in front of other people but then the teachers started helping me be less shy and more open.

04:06:41.032 --> 04:06:45.594
And I think this is important because I am soon going to sixth grade and I know the work gets harder.

04:06:46.092 --> 04:06:48.734
and I need to be more open to new things so I grow more.

04:06:49.354 --> 04:06:50.975
New School is preparing me for that.

04:06:51.136 --> 04:06:53.237
I came from a private school in New School in third grade.

04:06:53.357 --> 04:06:56.459
At first I was surprised by New School's learning tools and teaching methods.

04:06:56.519 --> 04:07:00.902
In my old school, like 90% of people here were Asian, but in New School there is so much diversity.

04:07:01.463 --> 04:07:02.844
Plus, the school lets you be yourself.

04:07:03.224 --> 04:07:05.125
You don't just have to sit there and listen to the teacher.

04:07:05.626 --> 04:07:11.690
No matter if you have ADHD to Dilexia, you'll have the learning tools to help you learn and be your best self.

04:07:12.170 --> 04:07:17.651
We really hope you will expand our school not just for us but for all the future students in this school.

04:07:17.771 --> 04:07:18.651
Thank you for listening.

04:07:25.352 --> 04:07:30.073
Hi my name is Ophelia Chapman and I go to the new school in San Francisco where teachers feel like family.

04:07:30.413 --> 04:07:33.494
We each have an individualized learning plan that works.

04:07:34.054 --> 04:07:38.795
These things let me learn with confidence and an open mind without feeling left behind.

04:07:39.804 --> 04:07:41.365
We're not all perfect, no one is.

04:07:42.166 --> 04:07:43.967
We make mistakes, we learn from them.

04:07:45.148 --> 04:07:46.089
We learn from each other.

04:07:47.170 --> 04:07:52.333
In art, we were looking at superheroes and we noticed the vast majority were white, cisgendered males.

04:07:53.014 --> 04:07:55.456
That got me thinking, why don't I see myself?

04:07:55.756 --> 04:07:57.958
Why don't I see almost all my classmates?

04:07:58.698 --> 04:08:04.322
The real question is, why aren't those who struggled the most the real heroes?

04:08:05.243 --> 04:08:07.465
I do my best here because I feel safe and supported.

04:08:09.522 --> 04:08:13.425
I can't tell you how much that means to me and how much I want that to continue.

04:08:14.125 --> 04:08:16.366
Middle school is the beginning of the road to adulthood.

04:08:16.787 --> 04:08:18.588
It's really interesting but also a little frightening.

04:08:19.148 --> 04:08:25.472
Being at a school where your teachers and friends love you and know you as a person is the most important thing now.

04:08:25.953 --> 04:08:28.374
I ask you to approve our request to be a K-8.

04:08:28.394 --> 04:08:28.694
Thank you.

04:08:40.037 --> 04:08:46.521
My name is Wendy Conway and thank you Board Member Sun for realizing that you can be underserved even if you're white.

04:08:47.361 --> 04:08:52.865
My son Max has sensory processing disorder, ADHD, anxiety and a history of aggressive behavior.

04:08:53.565 --> 04:08:58.108
That's why I value New School's unwavering commitment to reach every child who comes through the door.

04:08:58.988 --> 04:09:01.331
New School delivers on the promise of inclusion.

04:09:01.772 --> 04:09:04.215
With customized learning, New School meets Max where he is.

04:09:04.715 --> 04:09:11.063
Social emotional learning lets Max bring his whole self to school and he's not just accepted in this community, he's valued.

04:09:12.244 --> 04:09:18.151
The New School team knows Max, personalizes his education and gives me visibility and a voice along the way.

04:09:19.092 --> 04:09:22.776
Four years in Max participates in classes and on track in reading.

04:09:23.116 --> 04:09:28.300
He has strong friendships and for the first time this fall he sat down and did his homework on his own.

04:09:29.121 --> 04:09:32.784
For kids like Max progress is fragile and transitions devastating.

04:09:33.365 --> 04:09:37.148
Without new school we'd be starting over and likely never find a school that compares.

04:09:37.829 --> 04:09:41.552
Please let's extend and amplify their success not shut it down.

04:09:51.343 --> 04:09:52.004
Good afternoon.

04:09:52.144 --> 04:09:55.107
My name is Mariana Carrillo and I'm a mother of a

04:09:56.127 --> 04:10:03.892
third grader Belen and a fifth grader Roberto and we are so lucky to be part of New School of San Francisco community.

04:10:04.573 --> 04:10:08.055
Since day one we knew this was the school we wanted for our kids.

04:10:08.656 --> 04:10:22.945
Every year we are blessed to have wonderful teachers, teachers that are always there to listen and to teach every kid to respect one of each other regardless of their race, gender or social economical level.

04:10:23.866 --> 04:10:27.368
Teachers that accept and include our diversity and culture.

04:10:28.048 --> 04:10:31.990
Every kid has the same right and opportunity in New School.

04:10:32.690 --> 04:10:43.895
We understand there are very good schools in the district and we believe we have found one where you don't have to live in the right neighborhood or pay a tuition, which is not an option for my family.

04:10:44.795 --> 04:10:52.599
This is why I kindly ask you to please consider the expansion of New School of San Francisco into middle school.

04:10:52.699 --> 04:10:53.279
Thank you.

04:11:00.606 --> 04:11:01.226
Good afternoon.

04:11:01.786 --> 04:11:05.468
My name is Lauren Barry and I am a proud fifth grade teacher at the new school.

04:11:06.328 --> 04:11:08.349
This community has transformed me.

04:11:09.169 --> 04:11:13.031
New school is an invaluable place working to disrupt the status quo.

04:11:13.771 --> 04:11:18.393
As a white educator, this is crucial work needed to best serve my students.

04:11:19.153 --> 04:11:27.960
We ask questions like, how will we internalize the ways we, our families, our kids, have internalized entitlement and internalized oppression?

04:11:28.680 --> 04:11:33.083
These critical questions are shared with families and incorporated in daily discussions with students.

04:11:33.904 --> 04:11:37.667
Recently, making superhero art, students unearthed this big question.

04:11:38.147 --> 04:11:40.189
Do the superheroes we watch represent us?

04:11:40.789 --> 04:11:45.192
So, like we do, we got rooted in the data, we made meaning, and we reflected together.

04:11:46.113 --> 04:11:50.896
One student, Elisha, who's in the stands right now, observed and shared words I need you to hear.

04:11:51.536 --> 04:11:57.480
He said, it's not really about who you are, it's about the choices you make, the action you take, and how you perceive things.

04:11:58.200 --> 04:12:02.042
Equity, inclusion, these aren't just buzzwords, they are palpably alive at our time.

04:12:02.483 --> 04:12:05.044
Today you have the power to make a choice, take action.

04:12:05.204 --> 04:12:05.524
Time.

04:12:05.885 --> 04:12:07.265
Thank you for listening to our truths.

04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:15.230
There are no more speakers signed up on the list.

04:12:18.049 --> 04:12:20.932
Thank you very much for the public comment.

04:12:20.972 --> 04:12:24.236
We will now close the public hearing for this item.

04:12:24.957 --> 04:12:29.161
At 1259 PM and commence with board discussion and action.

04:12:29.181 --> 04:12:36.930
1st, I want to ask our liaison if she has any initial comments, and then we'll ask board members for clarifying questions or comments.

04:12:38.203 --> 04:12:39.845
President, I'm so sorry to interrupt.

04:12:39.946 --> 04:12:42.169
There's one student that was forgotten somehow.

04:12:42.630 --> 04:12:45.975
I take responsibility, but I just wish she would be devastated.

04:12:46.275 --> 04:12:48.258
I reopen the public hearing.

04:12:48.278 --> 04:12:49.119
Thank you.

04:12:49.139 --> 04:12:49.480
At 9 p.m.

04:12:49.540 --> 04:12:50.341
At the last word, Cora.

04:12:50.381 --> 04:12:50.521
Okay.

04:12:54.062 --> 04:12:55.664
Hello and good afternoon board members.

04:12:55.944 --> 04:12:56.985
My name is Cora Collin.

04:12:57.365 --> 04:13:00.348
I'm 11 years old and I'm a student at New School of San Francisco.

04:13:00.789 --> 04:13:05.553
I've been here for five years and hope to continue for 6th, 7th, and 8th grade.

04:13:06.034 --> 04:13:11.959
I love my school because we learn in really fun ways, whether it's coding a robot or building Biosphere 3 in our own classroom.

04:13:12.260 --> 04:13:15.443
We make up songs and dances to remember how to write a main idea statement.

04:13:15.963 --> 04:13:19.764
We do a lot of hands-on projects, not just in science, but other subjects too.

04:13:20.444 --> 04:13:22.404
Another thing is that our community is really great.

04:13:22.904 --> 04:13:25.625
We have morning pod every day to get to know each other even more.

04:13:26.025 --> 04:13:28.826
I'm excited to come to school and be with all my teachers and friends.

04:13:29.286 --> 04:13:34.867
I've made so many friends and if new school doesn't become a middle school and we go to different schools, it will be really hard to start over.

04:13:35.427 --> 04:13:38.828
Please let new school become a middle school so we can keep our community together.

04:13:39.148 --> 04:13:39.508
Thank you.

04:13:40.408 --> 04:13:40.828
Thank you.

04:13:40.848 --> 04:13:44.889
Okay, I want to make sure we got

04:13:45.444 --> 04:13:52.886
Everyone, I'm going to close the public hearing at 1 p.m.

04:13:54.367 --> 04:14:00.109
and then I'm going to turn to Sue Burr as our liaison to start with initial comments and we'll open up to the rest of the board.

04:14:01.343 --> 04:14:05.805
Thank you, President Darlingham, and I'll just reiterate a couple of things that Lisa said.

04:14:05.825 --> 04:14:21.093
The ACCS heard this material revision, and they voted to approve the material revision by not unanimously, but as Lisa mentioned, the department initially was recommending denial.

04:14:21.813 --> 04:14:34.270
And they've changed their recommendation, and I want to take just a minute to say how appreciative I am of all the work that Lisa and Carrie and other members of the charter staff did on this, as well as under Kai's leadership.

04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:37.334
You know, they listened carefully to what the school had to say.

04:14:37.914 --> 04:14:46.161
and they really reflected on what had happened, especially with respect to their enrollment options under their earlier petition.

04:14:46.201 --> 04:14:55.189
So it just goes to show how thoughtful the department is in these reviews, and I think how responsible they expect to be going forward with oversight.

04:14:55.689 --> 04:15:00.170
They've built in to their conditions, not just the change in the preference, but the checks.

04:15:00.190 --> 04:15:07.132
They're gonna be checking along the way to make sure that the school is able to live up to the expectations we have for them.

04:15:07.612 --> 04:15:09.013
So those are my opening comments.

04:15:09.113 --> 04:15:13.074
I'm ready to make a motion whenever folks are comfortable with the discussion.

04:15:13.494 --> 04:15:15.374
All right, let's see, what other discussion?

04:15:17.195 --> 04:15:17.715
Member Navo?

04:15:18.908 --> 04:15:21.269
So I have a couple of clarifying questions, too.

04:15:22.270 --> 04:15:25.091
And Board Member Strauss, you hit on it.

04:15:26.011 --> 04:15:29.733
I first want to thank the brave speakers and children today.

04:15:29.753 --> 04:15:33.294
That was quite moving, and I appreciate it very much.

04:15:33.795 --> 04:15:39.457
I also feel obligated to think about the district's perspective on this, even though there's only two of them here.

04:15:39.957 --> 04:15:45.020
And I think that one thing that I heard that strikes me, and I want to make sure I understand it,

04:15:45.660 --> 04:15:46.661
is around the facilities.

04:15:47.081 --> 04:15:52.985
If this is approved, is the district obligated to give them use of facilities even if they don't have room?

04:15:53.886 --> 04:16:00.550
In other words, do they have to displace programs to provide the facilities?

04:16:04.960 --> 04:16:16.332
Under Proposition 39, which is not an issue before you all today, all districts are obligated to provide facilities to charter schools who have 80 in-district students.

04:16:16.652 --> 04:16:18.634
So it's a process that they're going through right now.

04:16:19.294 --> 04:16:22.457
The deadlines are May 1st, I believe, is when the final offer would happen.

04:16:22.497 --> 04:16:26.742
So at this point, I don't think anyone knows what facilities, any charter schools in San Francisco,

04:16:27.382 --> 04:16:27.943
we'll be getting.

04:16:28.463 --> 04:16:37.169
So it's an ongoing process and it's the obligation of all districts and how the district chooses to manage it within their existing programs and their existing schools is up to them.

04:16:37.649 --> 04:16:45.855
They don't have an obligation to give a charter school the exact facility they ask for, but there are some requirements and regulations on law around this process.

04:16:46.363 --> 04:16:57.369
Okay, so theoretically, they could be in a situation where they have to displace a program to create the room and consolidate facilities.

04:16:57.389 --> 04:17:01.471
It would be up to the district of how they manage their multiple requests from all of their charters.

04:17:01.891 --> 04:17:04.933
So it's the district can, will determine that.

04:17:05.393 --> 04:17:06.774
Okay, that's.

04:17:07.334 --> 04:17:08.555
Another clarifying question on that.

04:17:10.437 --> 04:17:18.506
Is it also the case that sometimes districts rent out space that is not amongst their current space for charters?

04:17:18.526 --> 04:17:24.493
Or, you know, do they have to stick within the buildings they own, so to speak?

04:17:24.513 --> 04:17:26.836
You mean like rent out non-district?

04:17:27.176 --> 04:17:27.596
Buildings.

04:17:27.696 --> 04:17:28.017
Mm-hmm.

04:17:28.057 --> 04:17:39.344
Yeah, I mean, I thought I think I've seen that happen, but I don't know if that's part of I don't know what San Francisco's plan is we can we can have them come back up and ask if they that's what they do I just know within the prop 39.

04:17:39.704 --> 04:17:49.491
It's applicable to all districts statewide Can I just offer that there are different types of options and districts work with with their school districts to meet the prop 939

04:17:52.073 --> 04:18:01.499
So it could be that the charter school leases a building and the district helps to support the lease.

04:18:02.239 --> 04:18:03.240
So there's different ways.

04:18:03.280 --> 04:18:08.163
You don't necessarily have to move kids out of one building and another in order to meet the requirements.

04:18:09.915 --> 04:18:10.875
Okay, that makes sense.

04:18:10.935 --> 04:18:29.164
I'm thinking worst case scenario there's no place really to lease because space is a premium and a district is required then to accommodate the expansion which leads to the consolidation of programs and services for students that they are serving and that's a theoretical

04:18:30.524 --> 04:18:41.351
And I would say that is separate from your decision on a material revision or renewal or any charter decision, your decision within the confines of the law, which is to look at the petition itself.

04:18:42.111 --> 04:18:43.552
It's just an impact of the decision.

04:18:44.172 --> 04:18:45.673
I guess my second question is this.

04:18:49.915 --> 04:18:50.535
CD staff.

04:18:51.236 --> 04:19:01.900
The requirement is 50% of the students that come in for the 2021 school year meet the requirements of free and reduced lunch in kinder and sixth.

04:19:02.140 --> 04:19:02.440
Correct.

04:19:03.120 --> 04:19:11.043
Okay, so I get the kinder because I can enroll and accept, but I don't know what the percentage of fifth graders are now.

04:19:12.924 --> 04:19:28.133
So if the percentage of fifth graders are 11% free and reduced, that means they're either going to have to enroll a large number of students to meet this requirement, or they're going to have to disenroll current fifth graders to meet this requirement.

04:19:28.173 --> 04:19:29.234
Am I making sense of that?

04:19:30.612 --> 04:19:33.334
They will have their lottery this coming spring.

04:19:36.477 --> 04:19:45.645
And yes, I mean, I don't know actually how many of the current fifth graders meet that percentage currently.

04:19:45.665 --> 04:19:53.631
I know that in conversations we've had with the school, there was, Ryan is it, how many open spots?

04:19:54.775 --> 04:19:55.956
So in sixth grade?

04:19:55.976 --> 04:20:01.523
Why don't you come up so you can help me, yeah, so that we can hear you properly.

04:20:04.527 --> 04:20:05.548
And maybe it's a poor question.

04:20:05.588 --> 04:20:06.689
I apologize.

04:20:06.709 --> 04:20:06.749
OK.

04:20:07.450 --> 04:20:07.630
Yeah.

04:20:14.145 --> 04:20:22.070
So the current percentage of students whose families qualify for free and reduced price meals is 27% of that cohort.

04:20:23.091 --> 04:20:29.495
We are going to expand from 48, as a part of our petition and appeal, from 48 to 60.

04:20:30.295 --> 04:20:33.798
So there'll be 12 additional spots that open up within that cohort itself.

04:20:34.899 --> 04:20:36.980
But that total is going to have to meet 50%?

04:20:37.020 --> 04:20:37.861
Of the total class.

04:20:48.809 --> 04:20:50.751
of students, too, with transitions.

04:20:50.911 --> 04:20:58.718
Yeah, I mean, our retention rate is high, but we always lose in each cohort like two or three, four students per year.

04:20:58.778 --> 04:21:09.007
So I would say that over the course of the year, especially because what we have is we have families who migrate out of San Francisco, that's the largest reason people are leaving the school, is that that target is achievable.

04:21:09.386 --> 04:21:20.652
Mm-hmm and you've been having 90% Acceptance rate acceptance rate of FRPM students, okay Okay, we've got a lot of other questions.

04:21:20.692 --> 04:21:26.416
I want to be sure that member Navo has had a chance to finish his questions And I'm gonna come along around this way.

04:21:26.536 --> 04:21:28.457
So Brenna you're next

04:21:29.594 --> 04:21:33.775
Would that requirement only be for this first class?

04:21:33.855 --> 04:21:40.817
Because if this is also the most diverse class, what about the other ones falling behind that would continue in the system?

04:21:40.917 --> 04:21:48.019
So would that be addressed in the same way where each, I don't know if I'm asking that correctly, but.

04:21:48.659 --> 04:21:50.079
Meaning in each prospective year?

04:21:50.099 --> 04:21:54.480
Yeah, the years that are less diverse.

04:21:54.701 --> 04:21:56.401
How exactly would that be addressed as well?

04:21:59.039 --> 04:22:10.945
So that percentage wouldn't be for the first through current, like coming in this year, the first through fourth grade, I will say, right?

04:22:11.465 --> 04:22:12.326
Fourth grade, fifth grade.

04:22:13.326 --> 04:22:15.828
So it would be for the classes that are coming up.

04:22:15.868 --> 04:22:20.050
So it'll definitely be the kindergarten class because they have existing students.

04:22:20.490 --> 04:22:22.192
that are gonna go from one grade to the next.

04:22:22.232 --> 04:22:26.615
So it's hard for them to meet that 50% with students they already have.

04:22:26.856 --> 04:22:30.199
So we are proposing this as they expand.

04:22:30.679 --> 04:22:41.488
So we'll stay with the kindergartners and it will expand with the grades as they expand one grade per year with the new classes, as part of the expansion, because it's specific to the expansion.

04:22:42.069 --> 04:22:44.011
Does that make sense or did I confuse it?

04:22:44.971 --> 04:22:45.192
Okay.

04:22:53.399 --> 04:22:55.321
And the specific, can you repeat the specific question?

04:22:55.361 --> 04:22:56.523
I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I get it right.

04:22:56.823 --> 04:23:06.714
What are the implications for the other classes, right, is the basic question that Brenna was asking, in terms of what's expected of their diversity?

04:23:08.922 --> 04:23:12.424
The expectation is we meet the floor that's set out.

04:23:12.444 --> 04:23:14.545
So we are petitioning for a minimum, right?

04:23:14.845 --> 04:23:19.948
And that we're meeting that floor, that minimum, in our recruitment.

04:23:20.008 --> 04:23:33.574
So in previous classes, what we would do is make most use of, one, the extension of expansion from 48 to 60, as each cohort goes from 56, and also utilize any attrition that we have.

04:23:33.694 --> 04:23:36.076
So within that cohort, roughly 5%, 6%.

04:23:38.817 --> 04:23:40.759
to make sure that we're meeting that minimum threshold.

04:23:41.580 --> 04:23:50.128
And that our preference is that we would prioritize those families that qualify before opening up a random public lottery for everyone else.

04:23:50.168 --> 04:23:51.630
So we would want to hit that floor.

04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:54.733
So the 33% floor is still there.

04:23:56.354 --> 04:24:00.238
But we are increasing it for the grade levels that they're going to be expanding to.

04:24:02.042 --> 04:24:02.142
To 50%.

04:24:02.342 --> 04:24:03.144
Correct.

04:24:03.244 --> 04:24:03.585
Got you.

04:24:04.687 --> 04:24:07.352
I think I understand it, but I want to be sure that everyone else does.

04:24:07.412 --> 04:24:09.015
Did you have a further question on that point?

04:24:11.035 --> 04:24:16.619
For the sixth graders and the kinder, you'll have a 50% threshold to meet this year, 2020, 2021.

04:24:19.481 --> 04:24:31.208
After that, it's 33% for all subsequent grades from K to five, except for the rising, I'm sorry, K to six, except for the rising seventh graders, correct?

04:24:32.249 --> 04:24:36.652
So then for the next, for the seventh graders, you also have to meet the 33% or the 50.

04:24:40.063 --> 04:24:41.805
Oh, well, 50 because it would be your students.

04:24:42.206 --> 04:24:42.606
Correct.

04:24:42.686 --> 04:24:48.994
So what I don't understand, though, is if you have 27 percent now and you're going to subject the students to a lottery.

04:24:49.054 --> 04:24:49.274
Right.

04:24:49.334 --> 04:24:51.717
So it's not 27 percent automatically get in.

04:24:52.972 --> 04:24:56.553
No, that cohort would hold, right?

04:24:56.693 --> 04:25:01.934
So this group that just came up and spoke would then transition from fifth to sixth grade.

04:25:02.394 --> 04:25:04.435
And then we would open up 12 additional spots.

04:25:04.455 --> 04:25:05.575
So we'd go from 48 to 60.

04:25:06.495 --> 04:25:14.837
Within that, and then any attrition that we have in that transition from fifth to sixth grade, all would be subject to the 50% minimum floor.

04:25:15.575 --> 04:25:17.175
So there is no lottery for middle school?

04:25:17.195 --> 04:25:19.016
I thought I read something that there was a lottery for middle school.

04:25:19.036 --> 04:25:20.476
There's a lottery for every open spot.

04:25:20.596 --> 04:25:25.838
And so in this case, if you just look at expansion, it would be the 12 spots that open up from fifth to sixth grade.

04:25:25.898 --> 04:25:30.139
But you would be able to prioritize FRPM families for those spots.

04:25:30.299 --> 04:25:30.919
For those spots.

04:25:31.139 --> 04:25:31.379
Right.

04:25:32.080 --> 04:25:38.201
And you would not fill those spots with other families until you had reached the threshold.

04:25:38.281 --> 04:25:38.762
Is that right?

04:25:39.062 --> 04:25:40.222
Our priority and preference.

04:25:41.823 --> 04:25:55.319
That makes sense and then in each subsequent sixth grade you would be aiming for the 50% for all for each time sixth grade comes up or 33% I think that was the question from member Ortiz-Lacon.

04:25:57.578 --> 04:26:01.341
50% would then be in the subsequent 7th grade and in the subsequent 8th grade.

04:26:01.401 --> 04:26:01.842
Okay, gotcha.

04:26:01.862 --> 04:26:02.402
Does that help?

04:26:02.623 --> 04:26:02.803
Yeah.

04:26:02.963 --> 04:26:05.625
So as it expands that 50% continues to grow.

04:26:05.645 --> 04:26:07.487
And then it's in the kindergarten and it moves through.

04:26:07.507 --> 04:26:07.687
Correct.

04:26:07.827 --> 04:26:10.789
So you're really trying to establish that as the way it moves through.

04:26:10.849 --> 04:26:11.270
Gotcha.

04:26:11.430 --> 04:26:12.811
Right, from both sides.

04:26:12.831 --> 04:26:14.312
Okay, yes, Kai.

04:26:14.853 --> 04:26:16.454
Kai Jackson, Deputy Superintendent.

04:26:16.534 --> 04:26:20.598
Just to make it clear, as Lisa and the gentleman mentioned,

04:26:21.178 --> 04:26:29.703
of the spaces available in that lottery, in his example, 12 spaces, the first preference would be to FRMP.

04:26:30.063 --> 04:26:40.210
So at least six of the 12 would be FRMP before they moved on to the second preference, which is siblings, right?

04:26:40.250 --> 04:26:47.554
So that's how that spiking would go on both kindergarten and sixth grade and how Lisa explained.

04:26:52.586 --> 04:26:55.827
50% of the total class as opposed to 50% of the new slots.

04:27:00.428 --> 04:27:01.828
It should be in the entire class.

04:27:02.128 --> 04:27:04.929
Okay, 50% of the total class, so we, okay.

04:27:05.769 --> 04:27:06.429
We're gonna go with.

04:27:07.530 --> 04:27:17.392
And the goal is to get, yes, and ultimately the goal is to get to 50% of the class, but in terms of how that lottery system works, helps to get you there.

04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:22.911
We're coming around this way.

04:27:22.931 --> 04:27:25.312
Brenna, do you feel like you got your question answered?

04:27:29.312 --> 04:27:30.633
Member Sun, you're next.

04:27:30.653 --> 04:27:33.535
Oh, I'm sorry, Member Patio-Bronson, and then Member Sun.

04:27:33.595 --> 04:27:34.975
We're just gonna keep moving around.

04:27:35.596 --> 04:27:54.206
I'm not sure if I just did the math right, but if it's 33% of 48 kids currently, that's 15 kids, and if we're getting to a class size of 60, you're aiming to add another 15 FRL kids, which means every expansion slot is an FRL slot.

04:27:54.366 --> 04:27:54.706
Is that right?

04:27:56.357 --> 04:28:03.603
So if you have 12 slots, you would, it's not six of the 12 slots have to be 50%, it's the whole class.

04:28:03.663 --> 04:28:08.346
So if you're not at 50%, then all of 12 slots would have to go towards FRPM.

04:28:08.746 --> 04:28:11.428
Until you get to 30 kids, right?

04:28:12.369 --> 04:28:21.316
And the fact that they're seeing 90% acceptance at application rates now suggests that that's plausible.

04:28:22.737 --> 04:28:25.139
Be plausible if they weren't seeing those kinds of numbers.

04:28:26.556 --> 04:28:28.618
So I actually had a different clarifying question.

04:28:28.758 --> 04:28:39.169
One of the speakers had made reference to the initial proposal being approved as a K to 12 proposal that this board approved.

04:28:40.711 --> 04:28:42.873
The board approved a K-5 proposal.

04:28:43.093 --> 04:28:44.875
That was what was in their original petition.

04:28:45.155 --> 04:28:46.796
They had an intent to be K-12.

04:28:47.217 --> 04:28:50.680
But when the petition was submitted to the board, it was for K-5.

04:28:50.940 --> 04:28:52.522
And they explained that they were hoping to grow.

04:28:52.882 --> 04:28:57.466
But it was always our understanding that as they wanted to grow, they'd have to come back for a material revision.

04:28:58.767 --> 04:29:05.353
And so last clarifying question, the standard by which we're reviewing this is the same standard as item 17.

04:29:05.854 --> 04:29:06.214
Is that right?

04:29:07.842 --> 04:29:10.523
No, no, because that was a renewal.

04:29:11.163 --> 04:29:14.805
So academics has to be the most important factor under renewal.

04:29:15.165 --> 04:29:19.907
And this is a material revision to expand, so you can't look at it academics because there's no six, seven, eight kids.

04:29:20.807 --> 04:29:27.110
So you're looking at it as you would a new school and whether or not they are likely to substantially implement the program, et cetera.

04:29:28.769 --> 04:29:33.736
Sorry, same standard of review in terms of it is de novo, though.

04:29:33.756 --> 04:29:34.056
Correct.

04:29:34.417 --> 04:29:35.959
Yes, everything is still de novo.

04:29:36.279 --> 04:29:38.782
AB 1505 does not go into effect until July 1.

04:29:39.443 --> 04:29:42.347
So we are all under the old law, the current law.

04:29:43.849 --> 04:29:44.590
Soon-to-be-old law.

04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:46.090
Member Sun.

04:29:46.371 --> 04:30:00.940
Yeah, so the threshold that we're requiring of them with the expansion grades is high, but I believe based on what we've heard on the plan, their recruitment plan and what they have already been doing,

04:30:01.760 --> 04:30:10.263
and the fact that whatever remaining spots, 12 spots, 13, 14, will all go to our ML students.

04:30:10.823 --> 04:30:14.584
So I think it's doable for them, given what they've done.

04:30:15.044 --> 04:30:25.748
I am curious to hear a little bit about the transportation piece of it, because there is one to kind of get the students and then to keep them because of transportation, and somebody had mentioned that.

04:30:25.768 --> 04:30:29.089
So I'm curious to hear what the transportation plan and

04:30:31.674 --> 04:30:32.495
So is that okay to?

04:30:34.436 --> 04:30:37.779
Ask the staff and if they need to they can ask the petitioners to clarify.

04:30:39.300 --> 04:30:41.362
At this point we're asking them to take a look at it.

04:30:41.622 --> 04:30:50.909
So we didn't ask for anything specific but one of the issues that came up through ACCS in terms of when they had the conversations about the difficulties and outreach and

04:30:51.489 --> 04:30:59.696
and bringing in the families was transportation issues, and so we're asking them to look at that as part of their outreach.

04:31:00.037 --> 04:31:08.284
They do a lot of community outreach with preschools in those areas, and as the school and the petitioners mentioned, they do a lot of that outreach themselves.

04:31:08.344 --> 04:31:12.527
They're going out and doing that in communities, but how do they bring the people in?

04:31:12.628 --> 04:31:13.969
How do they bring those parents in?

04:31:14.489 --> 04:31:17.432
So we've asked them to take a look at that as part of their outreach.

04:31:18.013 --> 04:31:19.795
So we haven't given them anything specific.

04:31:19.875 --> 04:31:23.179
It's just another point to expand their outreach plan.

04:31:33.559 --> 04:31:35.980
Okay, I thought you were trying to answer the question.

04:31:36.020 --> 04:31:38.061
I thought I saw a hand, you know, go up in the class.

04:31:38.381 --> 04:31:38.581
Yeah.

04:31:39.282 --> 04:31:41.262
So here, so I just want to make a comment.

04:31:41.282 --> 04:31:45.284
So districts get transportation money, charter schools do not.

04:31:46.005 --> 04:31:51.307
And if there is a huge concern on the part of the district around equity,

04:31:52.128 --> 04:31:55.752
and providing choice to students who are the most disadvantaged.

04:31:56.393 --> 04:32:03.643
That a partnership or somehow working with the district to provide transportation because you've got those buses going around anywhere.

04:32:04.023 --> 04:32:08.549
And I'm not saying give it to the charter school for free, but to buy a couple of spots.

04:32:09.530 --> 04:32:14.392
or a couple seats on a bus that is in route in the same area.

04:32:14.412 --> 04:32:22.016
I think it really would be helpful and it would also be the district putting their money where their mouth is.

04:32:25.748 --> 04:32:26.248
Who's next?

04:32:27.569 --> 04:32:28.230
Member Strauss.

04:32:28.790 --> 04:32:48.006
So first I just want to appreciate the new school's commitment to continue with their mission and having been a long-term middle school principal and those of us who live with middle schoolers in our household remember the drama and it just comes with drama and growth as kids go from 11 to 14.

04:32:48.586 --> 04:32:54.191
So I appreciate parents wanting a safe place for their kids and I appreciate school staff wanting to create that.

04:32:54.591 --> 04:32:59.015
It's a different environment than middle level elementary and it's a whole different game than high school.

04:32:59.395 --> 04:33:06.501
And so I think, and that's not to say that San Francisco Unified is not committed to creating healthy middle schools as well.

04:33:06.841 --> 04:33:13.127
But I believe that the middle school level is built on important principles which we heard in the presentation.

04:33:14.047 --> 04:33:25.234
I appreciate the plan and the push that the board is doing to make sure that the material revision includes specifics to get to the right diversity that we expect.

04:33:25.514 --> 04:33:31.518
But when we first heard this, we did hear K-12, and I think there always was an intent.

04:33:32.138 --> 04:33:35.899
And different families want a K-5, they want a K-8, they want a K-12.

04:33:36.179 --> 04:33:43.762
Not everybody wants to stay in the same, but there are some unique cases where parents look for the right public school as an option for their kids.

04:33:43.802 --> 04:33:48.664
And we heard quite a few challenges, I think, of social-emotional issues, learning challenges.

04:33:49.024 --> 04:33:58.927
And so I just appreciate parents looking for the right place and trying to find it, and the good stories about some successes, and the staff that really is challenging to do that.

04:33:59.267 --> 04:34:04.410
I still think it's hard about the relocation and the Prop 39 space that Member Navo asked.

04:34:04.950 --> 04:34:10.233
And we've heard other hearings where not only did they expand, they sometimes got moved.

04:34:10.674 --> 04:34:16.417
So it's my understanding that the district, as Judy Saez was saying, has to decide where to put the school.

04:34:17.077 --> 04:34:20.418
And do they move the smaller school or do they move the bigger school?

04:34:20.798 --> 04:34:23.838
And so I think that's the challenge of the space issue.

04:34:23.918 --> 04:34:28.619
And we recognize that property in San Francisco is challenging to rent and to find a place.

04:34:29.099 --> 04:34:34.781
But I still wanna make sure that we support a quality schools for kids.

04:34:35.201 --> 04:34:42.382
And that we try to work, I mean, what we hope is a collaborative relationship between the district and the school.

04:34:42.462 --> 04:34:46.083
And I hear some challenges from the board about wanting to

04:34:46.403 --> 04:34:49.247
put the money and the attention into their own school and I understand that.

04:34:49.667 --> 04:34:53.692
And I think it's a challenge in that it's not about this is not a quality school.

04:34:54.053 --> 04:35:02.264
I think the commitment that I hear from these educators and what the teachers and leaders are doing is what we would hope for all of our schools.

04:35:02.384 --> 04:35:03.785
So I just wanted to

04:35:04.286 --> 04:35:09.969
Really thank the school new school for what they presented and also for the department really pushing them on the details.

04:35:10.049 --> 04:35:19.954
And so I would say these material revisions with conditions, we have to hold them to so that we get what we expect and what the, what the expectations are.

04:35:20.314 --> 04:35:20.574
Thank you.

04:35:25.600 --> 04:35:29.903
Okay, well things got fuzzy, I just want to confirm the math.

04:35:30.164 --> 04:35:36.469
We are assuming that out of the 60 students, 30, that's a 50%, will be free and reduced.

04:35:37.229 --> 04:35:44.855
That out of those 30, 12 will be new students, that leaves us with 18, so 18 of the existing students must be free and reduced now.

04:35:45.916 --> 04:35:46.476
That's the math.

04:35:47.317 --> 04:35:49.178
So is that not what we're looking at?

04:35:49.218 --> 04:35:52.841
Because 30%, 50% of the cohort of 60 would be 30.

04:35:52.881 --> 04:35:55.363
12 are new slots.

04:35:55.763 --> 04:36:06.490
All 100% of those will go to free and reduce, which means that there has to be at least 18 existing students that meet that criteria right now in grade, in fifth grade, moving on to grade six.

04:36:06.870 --> 04:36:11.474
And if that's not the case, they're going to not meet the criteria on the first year right now.

04:36:11.854 --> 04:36:13.455
So if you could clarify that, that would be great.

04:36:13.655 --> 04:36:22.461
I think that it's also appropriate to note that there's always some people who don't come back, and particularly at transition rates.

04:36:22.482 --> 04:36:25.083
So they might have to fill those slots as well.

04:36:29.048 --> 04:36:29.308
Right.

04:36:30.288 --> 04:36:34.710
They need to come if they have attrition that they would fill those seats with free and reduce.

04:36:34.790 --> 04:36:35.030
Yes.

04:36:35.610 --> 04:36:36.771
But the magic number is 30.

04:36:37.451 --> 04:36:40.012
30 students have to be free and reduced with new and existing.

04:36:40.232 --> 04:36:41.412
Yes, because it's 60.

04:36:41.492 --> 04:36:44.414
There's going to be 60 students in the proposed sixth grade.

04:36:44.794 --> 04:36:45.314
That's correct.

04:36:45.694 --> 04:36:48.375
OK, because I was seeing a lot of nonverbal communication back there.

04:36:49.275 --> 04:36:50.836
So, I want to make sure we're all on the same page.

04:36:51.816 --> 04:36:52.716
Okay, so that's it.

04:36:52.756 --> 04:37:03.320
I do want to learn a little bit more about how you will then build the infrastructure, the school, anytime you diversify, you know, you're looking at translation services.

04:37:03.380 --> 04:37:05.181
Now, we need to include the EO roadmap.

04:37:05.601 --> 04:37:18.767
Now, we need to make sure that and I know you have a plan, but then make sure that there is a plan, a school climate, the, the different parent groups that are going to be responsive to these students.

04:37:19.207 --> 04:37:21.048
So, I want to learn a little bit more about that.

04:37:21.068 --> 04:37:22.889
I do think that these.

04:37:23.911 --> 04:37:33.597
These charter hearings never get easy because, on the one hand, you're seeing a model where there is a lot of student support, parent support, and, you know, there's performance.

04:37:34.238 --> 04:37:42.964
On the other hand, there is a reality that we can't consider the facilities, but we know that the minute we approve, if we approve this, that will become an issue at the local level.

04:37:43.624 --> 04:37:52.995
especially when we know that it could potentially impact a school geared at refugee students who have already been displaced in their own home countries, right?

04:37:53.016 --> 04:37:58.082
So you're like, wow, you were displaced in your home country and now we're displacing you yet again in your learning environment.

04:37:58.742 --> 04:38:09.626
That is, again, where theory and practice don't always align, because the theory of not wanting to disrupt systems for the right reason, and then when you disrupt systems unintentionally.

04:38:10.686 --> 04:38:15.948
So those are never easy conversations for us, but we cannot consider that piece of it, right?

04:38:16.168 --> 04:38:20.069
Our legal authority is to consider the actual petition here.

04:38:20.969 --> 04:38:33.942
But I do want to say to Commissioner Collins that I heard you and I heard you loud and it did have an impact because that's definitely staying in the back of my mind and obviously it it it hurts me that we could potentially also hurt our refugee students which are the most vulnerable.

04:38:36.544 --> 04:38:38.085
Member Rucker, were you waiting to speak?

04:38:39.387 --> 04:38:41.689
I just took a guess that that might be the case.

04:38:43.479 --> 04:38:54.630
So, first of all, I do want to thank Member Strauss for her recognition that having a middle school child in the House creates some interesting emotional challenges.

04:38:55.170 --> 04:39:01.537
As a middle school child myself, I perfected that very feminine charm of getting the vapors.

04:39:02.839 --> 04:39:05.822
and I still hang on to that activity as an adult.

04:39:06.382 --> 04:39:10.306
So let me, I had to say that as the reason for my next sentence.

04:39:10.846 --> 04:39:15.430
I thought I understood this item until everybody started talking about it.

04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:18.573
Now I'm thoroughly confused.

04:39:19.033 --> 04:39:24.518
So Lisa, if you could come to the mic, I need to pick apart

04:39:26.258 --> 04:39:28.779
what we're doing on this item.

04:39:29.239 --> 04:39:42.444
So I'm going to begin by asking you about this Appendix D. Is this Appendix D added to the renewal petition that the charter presented in an item we've already voted on?

04:39:42.664 --> 04:39:42.864
Yes.

04:39:43.324 --> 04:39:43.644
Okay.

04:39:44.144 --> 04:39:52.727
So what they wrote about in this Appendix D is going to be modified by the action we take now, is that correct?

04:39:54.289 --> 04:39:59.995
It would be a witness yes, I mean, we are recommending that they add some information about transportation.

04:40:00.135 --> 04:40:01.977
So that would be included in the plan.

04:40:02.718 --> 04:40:03.519
The admission.

04:40:04.900 --> 04:40:10.286
Additional condition would be in the actual admission preferences in the charter petition.

04:40:10.807 --> 04:40:11.628
Okay, so.

04:40:13.803 --> 04:40:19.989
So what we approved in a previous vote is going to be modified by this action.

04:40:20.049 --> 04:40:27.796
Does that require another material revision or is that already just a part of the conditions that we're approving with this action?

04:40:27.976 --> 04:40:29.097
It's part of the condition.

04:40:29.117 --> 04:40:31.079
Okay, so that was my first question.

04:40:31.119 --> 04:40:34.322
So then now let me understand these class size

04:40:35.122 --> 04:40:36.562
floor and guarantees.

04:40:36.642 --> 04:40:52.946
There were, as part of the condition for this action that's being contemplated, there were two grades that some minimums would have to be in place for in the first year, and that's kindergarten and sixth grade.

04:40:53.566 --> 04:41:02.629
Okay, so, and for both of those grades in the first year this would be implemented, there is a requirement that 50% of the enrollment

04:41:04.409 --> 04:41:09.354
in that grade would have to be free and reduced lunch.

04:41:10.094 --> 04:41:17.361
Okay, so let me explore the kindergarten piece of this, because I think I can resolve this one right away.

04:41:18.160 --> 04:41:33.774
So is it a requirement that in the succeeding years, for the five years that this renewal is in place, that every single year the kindergarten has to have a 50% enrollment of free and reduced lunch?

04:41:34.074 --> 04:41:34.294
Yes.

04:41:34.715 --> 04:41:36.576
Okay, so that.

04:41:36.596 --> 04:41:40.059
All right.

04:41:40.139 --> 04:41:40.720
Is that not?

04:41:42.221 --> 04:41:44.023
I thought we were continuing the kindergarten.

04:41:44.543 --> 04:41:45.144
Yes, okay.

04:41:45.737 --> 04:41:48.882
Okay, some of your staff are saying no, some are saying yes.

04:41:49.222 --> 04:41:52.006
This is the reason why I said I was confused.

04:41:52.126 --> 04:41:52.987
I understand.

04:41:53.007 --> 04:41:55.431
That was my understanding.

04:41:56.312 --> 04:41:57.834
You can let me know if I'm wrong, please.

04:41:59.255 --> 04:42:14.531
So, to once again put it in context, you're really trying to get to a diverse student population which reflects the community and roughly San Francisco Unified School Districts for some of their schools is roughly 50%, right?

04:42:15.032 --> 04:42:18.055
So, the first piece is the spiking at kindergarten.

04:42:18.095 --> 04:42:22.099
So, when their lottery occurs, what I believe is in March, right?

04:42:22.995 --> 04:42:27.958
of that kindergarten class, 50% will come in as FRMP, period.

04:42:28.279 --> 04:42:35.944
So you're already starting out where you're trying to get to, and as they go through, you will have perhaps some attrition.

04:42:36.184 --> 04:42:44.289
They said they have very little attrition, so you're probably roughly 48, 49% at fifth grade.

04:42:44.970 --> 04:42:48.172
If you make an assumption that they will then go to the sixth grade,

04:42:49.339 --> 04:42:59.226
And you then in sixth grade lottery spike that, and it really sort of serves as a topper to ensure that you continue around there, right?

04:42:59.266 --> 04:43:01.867
So that's sort of around that 50% mark.

04:43:01.887 --> 04:43:02.828
So that's one piece.

04:43:04.089 --> 04:43:08.511
Then there's another piece, and you just don't get diversity instantly overnight.

04:43:09.032 --> 04:43:10.453
It just doesn't occur that way.

04:43:11.141 --> 04:43:16.204
So there are already a number of FRMP in their fifth graders.

04:43:16.244 --> 04:43:17.525
We saw some of them today.

04:43:17.985 --> 04:43:19.026
So they'll have a lottery.

04:43:20.027 --> 04:43:21.047
They're estimating roughly 12.

04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:28.712
And if you have half then, or FRMP, you then spike it again.

04:43:28.772 --> 04:43:30.173
I mean, you're just not going to get to 50% overnight.

04:43:31.627 --> 04:43:34.548
So there was some intentionality in that.

04:43:35.828 --> 04:43:45.870
The other piece is how we change, or the sibling's preference, and there are some caps on that as well.

04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:47.731
So that is a thought process.

04:43:47.751 --> 04:43:48.391
Does that make sense?

04:43:48.411 --> 04:43:49.011
Does that provide for?

04:43:49.031 --> 04:43:58.573
Okay, but my question was, on the kindergarten, is the plan that for the five years that the renewal is in place,

04:43:59.153 --> 04:44:19.541
that each year when they recruit new students to form their new kindergarten class, is it a requirement that 50% of the kindergartners enrolled for each year of the five years the charter will be in place, that 50% of those new kindergartners must be on free and reduced lunch?

04:44:23.782 --> 04:44:24.862
I'm getting the impression.

04:44:25.162 --> 04:44:34.185
I guess I'm getting the impression that's not what some of these folks think they've agreed to.

04:44:35.445 --> 04:44:39.466
If you put the slides back up, I think this is what's adding to the confusion.

04:44:41.006 --> 04:44:43.807
This is your basis for recommendation.

04:44:44.947 --> 04:44:48.508
Then you have additional recommended requirements for approval one.

04:44:49.368 --> 04:44:52.231
And then the next one says requirements for approval two.

04:44:52.832 --> 04:44:59.558
And that, the first bullet and the sub-bullets under that I think are what's creating a little bit of confusion here.

04:45:00.119 --> 04:45:04.723
So if you could just put that up there and maybe we can work off of that actual text.

04:45:13.086 --> 04:45:15.447
while you're putting it up there, I'll say what it says.

04:45:16.128 --> 04:45:17.708
Changes to admission preferences.

04:45:17.808 --> 04:45:24.292
Pupils eligible for free and reduced price meals with a 33% minimum for each grade.

04:45:25.012 --> 04:45:34.096
Then the next subsection says for the 2021 school lottery, CDE is requiring a 50% floor for K and sixth grade.

04:45:34.557 --> 04:45:40.760
And I think that reads, if I'm interpreting what people are asking, that it's just a one year deal.

04:45:41.443 --> 04:45:47.106
And what member Rucker is asking is, is that going to happen subsequently for the term of the petition?

04:45:47.766 --> 04:45:49.427
And we're getting confused.

04:45:49.847 --> 04:45:50.087
I am.

04:45:51.688 --> 04:45:53.349
I can understand that.

04:45:53.809 --> 04:45:56.270
The intent is for that to continue to continue.

04:45:56.310 --> 04:45:57.131
That's not what it is.

04:45:57.191 --> 04:45:58.712
That's what the intent is.

04:45:59.092 --> 04:46:06.796
And I believe that's what based on the conversation that kept happening, I understood that to be the intent.

04:46:07.176 --> 04:46:09.277
But that's not what that says.

04:46:11.238 --> 04:46:16.859
So I need to have some clarification on exactly what's going to happen with the kin.

04:46:16.899 --> 04:46:24.101
And I understand the kindergarten is different from the other grades that would be matriculating through the program.

04:46:24.541 --> 04:46:28.902
So we amend this statement to say for the 2021 2020 21 school lottery.

04:46:32.913 --> 04:46:41.278
and all subsequent lotteries, the CDE is requiring a 50% floor for K and 6th grade.

04:46:41.458 --> 04:46:42.979
Oh, for K and 6th grade?

04:46:43.099 --> 04:46:43.960
That's what it says.

04:46:44.200 --> 04:46:45.981
I'm just adding for subsequent.

04:46:51.244 --> 04:46:52.845
What kindergarten is not a new grade?

04:46:54.807 --> 04:46:57.531
kindergarten will be a new class.

04:46:58.712 --> 04:47:00.875
But it's not a new grade at that school.

04:47:00.995 --> 04:47:01.236
Right.

04:47:01.396 --> 04:47:09.727
But if if if the what I think people thought they were understanding was that this rule would apply for each year.

04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:18.632
then we could clarify this statement to say, for this lottery and the subsequent lotteries, the rest of that sentence holds.

04:47:18.712 --> 04:47:24.913
You get a new cohort every kindergarten year, and you get a expanded cohort every sixth grade year.

04:47:28.094 --> 04:47:30.754
No, you don't after, that's right, that's right, because of the.

04:47:31.234 --> 04:47:34.835
Okay, so yeah, so the English teacher in me is suggesting this.

04:47:35.095 --> 04:47:39.356
Isn't it always 48 going to 60, or is it not gonna grow?

04:47:41.044 --> 04:47:42.626
Well, wait, let me get to that.

04:47:43.527 --> 04:47:46.530
I wanna handle the kindergarten side of the problem first.

04:47:46.910 --> 04:48:03.668
So let me suggest this based on what I just heard, that this sentence needs to say, for the 2021 school year lottery, the CDE is requiring a 50% floor for K and sixth grade, semicolon.

04:48:04.858 --> 04:48:13.684
For subsequent years, for the balance of the renewal, the kindergarten enrollment will remain at a requirement of 50%.

04:48:16.189 --> 04:48:16.849
Does that make sense?

04:48:18.730 --> 04:48:22.471
That would take care of kindergarten.

04:48:22.551 --> 04:48:37.197
What was just suggested is that we are guaranteeing every time a new kindergarten class is registered, enrolled, recruited, that the school has to pay attention

04:48:37.677 --> 04:48:46.304
to their enrollment to guarantee that 50% of the new kindergarten students at the school every year will be on free and reduced lunch.

04:48:46.704 --> 04:48:49.987
And that doesn't matter what the size of the kindergarten is.

04:48:50.047 --> 04:48:56.852
If they only enroll 10 students for their kindergarten class, five of them need to be on free and reduced lunch.

04:48:57.392 --> 04:49:04.598
If by some chance they get a ginormous school facility and they enroll 100 kindergarten students,

04:49:05.319 --> 04:49:08.683
50 of those students need to be on free and reduced lunch.

04:49:08.723 --> 04:49:09.584
So we're clear on that.

04:49:10.276 --> 04:49:22.744
Okay, so then the idea behind this is Assistant Superintendent Kai says that these kindergartners are going to matriculate through the school, grade one, grade two, grade three, grade four, grade five.

04:49:23.304 --> 04:49:34.792
According to the charter school staff, we do have some, we have a high retention and we do have some students that fall out or fall off.

04:49:35.232 --> 04:49:48.646
So, looking at what the requirement is for grade six, we are saying for the 2021 school year, we're requiring that the enrollment for this brand new grade has to be 50%.

04:49:49.767 --> 04:49:53.231
Now, there's a difference between enrollment or recruitment.

04:49:53.831 --> 04:49:54.993
So- Can we stop?

04:49:55.673 --> 04:50:02.678
This is Judy size when you look at the first bullet it says for the 2021 school lottery I think the word lottery is confusing things too.

04:50:03.238 --> 04:50:24.411
So you're semi back to your semicolon Edition, I think what we're saying is for the 2021 school year The CD is requiring a 50% floor for grade K and for all subsequent years of the renewal for K Okay, let's get K because I think the adding the semicolon did not clear up the issue between the word lottery and enrollment

04:50:24.491 --> 04:50:26.132
Yeah, but lottery is the recruitment.

04:50:26.192 --> 04:50:27.073
I'm saying enroll.

04:50:27.133 --> 04:50:29.054
I use the word enrollment on purpose.

04:50:29.114 --> 04:50:29.314
Yes.

04:50:29.474 --> 04:50:31.875
She's taking the word.

04:50:32.035 --> 04:50:35.618
I'm writing that down and reiterating to make sure because it's different than what's on the screen.

04:50:35.818 --> 04:50:36.618
You just want to make sure.

04:50:36.718 --> 04:50:36.918
Yes.

04:50:37.078 --> 04:50:37.299
Okay.

04:50:37.319 --> 04:50:38.039
We've got K done.

04:50:38.539 --> 04:50:38.739
Okay.

04:50:39.100 --> 04:50:39.380
Okay.

04:50:39.780 --> 04:50:41.261
So then turning to the sixth.

04:50:44.523 --> 04:50:50.587
So then turning to the sixth grade, this is where I got confused again.

04:50:51.468 --> 04:50:54.990
So turning to the sixth grade, everybody got bogged down in percentages.

04:50:55.911 --> 04:50:58.513
It's easier for me to work on hard numbers.

04:50:59.193 --> 04:51:14.461
So again, we currently have, we heard from a lot of students who came here today to state that they intend to, if the school, if the grade expansion is approved, they intend to enroll in the sixth grade.

04:51:14.481 --> 04:51:18.804
So Lisa, how many fifth graders are currently at this school?

04:51:19.903 --> 04:51:22.505
48.

04:51:20.564 --> 04:51:22.505
48 students are currently at this school.

04:51:22.945 --> 04:51:32.531
And I heard very clearly, because it was said multiple times, that there's actually a low rate of attrition at the school.

04:51:32.551 --> 04:51:47.360
So that means if these numbers were in place when the new sixth grade class is opened this fall, of those 48 students, 24 of them need to be on free and reduced lunch.

04:51:47.740 --> 04:51:59.646
no that's what Kim was getting at earlier yes there's 48 continuing students they plan to add 12 slots no yeah okay six so the sixth grade starting next year will be 60 and of the 60 30 will need to be

04:52:02.481 --> 04:52:08.266
Okay, but the reality is they may not get all of those slots filled.

04:52:08.727 --> 04:52:17.795
So the point I'm trying to make is whatever the enrollment is, are we saying it has to be at 50% or are we saying you gave it your best shot and that's okay?

04:52:21.297 --> 04:52:26.238
So that's what I'm trying to get clear about on the new sixth grade class that will be created.

04:52:27.339 --> 04:52:30.799
I understand they intend to increase their class size.

04:52:31.240 --> 04:52:34.880
And part of the strategy at increasing their class size is twofold.

04:52:35.501 --> 04:52:38.021
One, they will get more students because it's another class.

04:52:38.481 --> 04:52:49.004
But two, it helps them to deal with their diversity numbers because since they have such a high retention rate, they need the extra space of those seats to help them.

04:52:49.204 --> 04:53:05.584
Yeah, let me see if I, so what I think I'm hearing you say is because we know we have a fifth grade class that's already going to continue, so maybe for sixth graders, 100% of the open slots in the lottery, 100% shall be FRPM until the school reaches 50%.

04:53:07.532 --> 04:53:10.794
That would be better because right now the math says they're not going to get to 50%.

04:53:11.995 --> 04:53:12.856
Right, because we know that.

04:53:12.876 --> 04:53:14.377
We don't want to set them up.

04:53:15.117 --> 04:53:26.966
Yeah, right now the way the math is, that's the reason why I want to take this, pick this apart, because right now the math says they won't get to 50% and I'm looking at the fact that they keep telling us about their high retention rate.

04:53:27.566 --> 04:53:44.550
So if their goal is to try to hang on to all the students they currently have, or at least allow them the flexibility to choose to stay, rather than deal with what my colleague here talked about, telling some kids, well, you can't come back because we now have this new agreement.

04:53:44.950 --> 04:53:51.532
If their goal is to try to want to retain the students they currently have, the math says they won't get to 50% as this requirement says.

04:53:55.677 --> 04:54:01.641
So I have, for the sixth grade, 100% of the slots in the lottery shall be allocated to FRPM.

04:54:01.961 --> 04:54:03.782
Every single year until?

04:54:04.082 --> 04:54:09.646
And every year until they get to 50% enrollment in sixth grade at FRPM.

04:54:09.686 --> 04:54:11.527
Well, maybe sixth grade, I guess seventh grade.

04:54:12.481 --> 04:54:18.865
No, it would be in sixth grade, since we're creating, it would be in sixth grade, because then they would, as they successively move up.

04:54:19.285 --> 04:54:21.787
Is this a, all right, so wait a minute, I have one more question.

04:54:22.067 --> 04:54:30.292
We also have some other folks who want to weigh in on this question, so Judy, I don't want you to leave until, I know Ting wanted to get in on this particular thing, so.

04:54:30.732 --> 04:54:33.375
Okay, so switching topics or no, I'm still on this.

04:54:33.415 --> 04:54:44.749
So then what I heard was there was something else that was supposed to happen for grade 7 in the out year and grade 8 in the out year, but that was not made clear to me.

04:54:45.330 --> 04:54:46.512
Is there a plan?

04:54:46.992 --> 04:55:03.478
for what's supposed to happen with that enrollment in grade 7 and grade 8 or are we assuming that as those 6th graders matriculate through they will just simply form the new 7th grade class with no conditions and form the new 8th grade class with no conditions?

04:55:03.718 --> 04:55:04.398
Is that correct?

04:55:04.838 --> 04:55:05.599
That was the intent.

04:55:05.659 --> 04:55:06.980
No, the 33% would apply to them though.

04:55:07.000 --> 04:55:08.342
Well, it's still the floor.

04:55:08.362 --> 04:55:09.623
It's still the intent.

04:55:09.663 --> 04:55:11.705
The floor, the 33% still implies.

04:55:11.845 --> 04:55:17.451
Okay, so the 33% then would apply to all grades or across the school?

04:55:18.092 --> 04:55:24.919
See, there's a difference between a 33% enrollment at each grade and a 33% enrollment across the school grade span.

04:55:25.569 --> 04:55:34.138
I was assuming across the school because you're boosting the percentages in some grade levels, others have to catch up over time.

04:55:34.218 --> 04:55:38.343
And so it mathematically makes more sense to say across the school.

04:55:38.383 --> 04:55:39.524
Aren't you glad I was last?

04:55:39.644 --> 04:55:40.225
Aren't you glad?

04:55:40.425 --> 04:55:40.665
See?

04:55:40.805 --> 04:55:41.887
Aren't you guys glad I'm last?

04:55:41.907 --> 04:55:42.527
Just say yes.

04:55:43.628 --> 04:55:54.992
So my attention to detail, see there's a difference between a 33% enrollment per grade and a 33% enrollment in grades K through eight.

04:55:55.292 --> 04:56:04.756
Because what you do with grades K through eight is you actually water down the diversity of the whole school if you're looking at the total population of the whole school.

04:56:05.116 --> 04:56:07.737
So that's the reason why that needs to be clear.

04:56:08.197 --> 04:56:19.584
And then the third thing these conditions don't state is what's going to, you know, I understand that you're going to retain jurisdiction and do the monitoring and do the reviewing and do the reporting.

04:56:19.924 --> 04:56:28.509
So I need to remind you, they have been in this holding pattern, and I'm not going to talk about what happened with their multiple attempts.

04:56:29.028 --> 04:56:34.992
to come back and have a material revision and talk to the board about what they realized was going wrong.

04:56:35.052 --> 04:56:44.238
The fact of the matter is, for most of the five years they have been in place, they never met their intent of the diversity in their student enrollment.

04:56:44.598 --> 04:56:50.342
So what's going to happen if these grand plans and the attention to detail we're making

04:56:50.962 --> 04:56:52.283
fails.

04:56:52.423 --> 04:57:00.026
Because I really don't believe it's going to succeed because it hasn't succeeded yet, but what's going to happen now if it fails now?

04:57:00.086 --> 04:57:08.050
Because they said they were unsuccessful in getting your attention and saying we want to do some revising and they didn't do it and they didn't get a chance to do it.

04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:11.492
So I don't want to find out five years from now

04:57:11.972 --> 04:57:17.818
when the San Francisco school board now has to take over the review of this and make some decisions.

04:57:19.159 --> 04:57:28.329
While it's beyond the scope of our authority to consider what's going to happen, whatever mess is created, it's our mess that somebody else is inheriting.

04:57:28.629 --> 04:57:34.775
So we need to be real clear in these conditions about exactly how you

04:57:35.456 --> 04:57:44.646
in the authority that the board is holding to create this charter, how we are going to make sure we fix this mess while it's still in the scope of our authority.

04:57:45.267 --> 04:57:46.248
And so that's not in there.

04:57:46.288 --> 04:57:49.852
That's very helpful and we have two other people want to weigh in on this question.

04:57:50.472 --> 04:57:54.557
So before we resolve it, can we hear from the other two?

04:57:55.509 --> 04:57:56.951
people who want to weigh in on this question.

04:57:57.031 --> 04:58:02.417
I don't think I wrote down, well and we can get to it if we have a motion, about what's the ongoing school.

04:58:02.477 --> 04:58:03.679
I did not write that down.

04:58:03.699 --> 04:58:07.584
Yeah and I think we want to hear from some other board members before we get to that.

04:58:08.485 --> 04:58:10.247
So Member Sun and then Member Patio-Bronson.

04:58:13.231 --> 04:58:26.368
So I appreciate Member Rucker's persistence in clarifying this because I understand why you're asking those questions and I think it will, even though we're spending more time on it, I think in the long run this is going to help us.

04:58:26.889 --> 04:58:30.614
So I would agree with

04:58:31.294 --> 04:58:47.978
the proposal that all of the open slot, what we said was all the open slots would be filled by free and reduced price lunch pupils until such time we reach the 50% threshold for each grade level.

04:58:48.138 --> 04:58:56.621
I think that is, that gives them a little bit of breathing room in the short term, but in the long term, we're actually setting a higher bar than the 33% minimum.

04:58:59.966 --> 04:59:05.688
Right, and so I think that that is a long-term, it's gonna be a stretch for them.

04:59:06.689 --> 04:59:20.435
They're not gonna be able to do it right away with every single grade level, but as those kindergartens move through, by the end of this charter term, we should see something very, very close to 50% free and reduced lunch.

04:59:21.135 --> 04:59:22.776
Right population in there.

04:59:23.116 --> 04:59:32.440
So this is the plan that we would be sitting out and setting for the school and With their commitment to this I would agree to that proposal.

04:59:32.580 --> 04:59:32.820
Okay.

04:59:32.880 --> 04:59:37.122
Thank you I just wanted to actually thank board member Rucker for

04:59:45.645 --> 04:59:49.787
going to town on our math skills this morning or midday, I guess.

04:59:50.847 --> 04:59:57.570
But I also just want to reflect that I think that's actually a really helpful upgrade in terms of the conditions that would be attached.

05:00:05.778 --> 05:00:14.984
The 50% threshold actually gets much closer to the actual demographics of the district, which I think we've heard from the representatives from the district as an aspiration.

05:00:17.205 --> 05:00:30.276
I think we've all been impressed by the academic and socio-emotional program that folks are offering and are just eager to make sure that it is equitably available to kids throughout San Francisco Unified.

05:00:30.997 --> 05:00:38.263
So I don't doubt that this would be a stretch and that this will be somewhat taxing but worth the while.

05:00:39.203 --> 05:01:00.511
And the numbers that were presented in the addendum around what the recruitment and outreach efforts have been to actually boost the number of FRL applicants, I think, actually should support even getting to 50 percent with existing robust recruitment efforts, and then enabled, of course, by changes in the lottery system.

05:01:01.151 --> 05:01:12.844
So I actually feel much more comfortable with this version of the expansion for middle school and feel like it's actually a much more well-developed plan this way.

05:01:13.785 --> 05:01:18.911
So your comfort level is with the version that Member Sun just articulated?

05:01:18.931 --> 05:01:21.674
I think you guys are articulating the same thing.

05:01:22.065 --> 05:01:33.051
Okay great and we're that version I just want to clarify does not speak to the 33% it really speaks to the Yes

05:01:35.216 --> 05:01:57.454
Well, we probably are gonna need to help write it, so that's why I'm, and I think the point that Member Sun was making is that if you have a threshold for kindergarten, and then you're beginning in sixth grade, and open slots that need to go to free and reduced price meal students until you reach the 50%, then that's a clear rule

05:02:02.059 --> 05:02:07.393
that I believe does no longer necessitates.

05:02:10.702 --> 05:02:14.245
the 33% because it's a very clear set of decision rules.

05:02:15.205 --> 05:02:17.047
So we can come back around to that.

05:02:18.068 --> 05:02:29.717
If we want to keep that other percentage in there, we've got to then go through a very long process of figuring out is that grade by grade and how would that work and given the grades and where they are now.

05:02:30.058 --> 05:02:33.841
So anyway, I think it's a cleaner, clearer set of decision rules.

05:02:35.582 --> 05:02:39.383
And so the other thing is that's a minimum.

05:02:39.423 --> 05:02:40.884
The 50% is a minimum.

05:02:41.124 --> 05:03:00.071
So if their recruiting efforts was such that they had, let's just say, 50 slots at their kindergarten, but they were able to recruit 50 families, that entire, because of the preference, that's actually their entire preference.

05:03:01.314 --> 05:03:01.915
That's their growth.

05:03:02.455 --> 05:03:03.476
Yeah, that's their growth.

05:03:03.857 --> 05:03:04.097
Yeah.

05:03:04.598 --> 05:03:04.978
Okay.

05:03:05.058 --> 05:03:08.402
I want to recognize It was answered.

05:03:09.142 --> 05:03:20.915
I want to remember guys member Sandoval I am coming back around this side of table, but I feel that in the in the cause of equity I have to pay attention to this side of the table Member Sandoval

05:03:23.980 --> 05:03:24.180
Thank you.

05:03:24.200 --> 05:03:48.813
I appreciate the discussion the clarification and the diligence member up Rucker and I I think that the proposed revision makes sense and is closer to where we want to be And I just want to reiterate what member son said that this is a floor It's not a ceiling and so hopefully there will be a lot of learning and growing over the next four or five years and We can exceed that

05:03:51.334 --> 05:03:56.718
the number of free and reduced price lunch students in this particular school, if it's approved.

05:03:56.778 --> 05:04:03.583
But I'm very supportive of the approval, but using these revisions that are proposed right now.

05:04:05.357 --> 05:04:06.058
Okay.

05:04:06.519 --> 05:04:07.460
Thank you for your patience.

05:04:07.780 --> 05:04:08.521
No, no problem.

05:04:08.581 --> 05:04:19.252
I want to make sure that the petitioners know what we're asking of them because there was five different conversations going on here and everyone had a different understanding of what we were actually asking.

05:04:19.793 --> 05:04:23.316
The 33% minimum for each grade is still there.

05:04:24.237 --> 05:04:26.658
I perceive that as a maintenance effort.

05:04:26.898 --> 05:04:37.043
So you're going to recruit 50% free and reduced, and you must maintain 33% per grade level across the school, per grade level.

05:04:37.443 --> 05:04:49.549
And so we wanna make sure that, yes, we will eventually up that number, but retention is going to be key, and we still do need to make sure we keep an eye on that floor and making sure it doesn't go below.

05:04:50.109 --> 05:04:55.895
And so we need to, if we remove the 33%, we're removing the minimum requirement.

05:04:56.756 --> 05:04:58.537
So I just want us to be aware of that.

05:04:58.618 --> 05:05:04.123
We could say 50% recruitment, but that doesn't mean retention.

05:05:04.263 --> 05:05:06.866
And so we need to make sure that we keep a minimum in there.

05:05:07.526 --> 05:05:18.418
So if we do that, I just want to clarify that we will then need to figure out at what point that kicks in for grade levels that are not currently expanding in size, okay?

05:05:18.658 --> 05:05:28.469
Because that's the piece that is, okay, so maybe that's one way to answer that and it starts with kinder, but I just want to be sure we are clear about that piece as well.

05:05:29.597 --> 05:05:32.120
Let's see what I've got, or do we want to keep discussing?

05:05:32.240 --> 05:05:36.785
Yeah, why don't you tell us what you've got, and then we'll go back to the next conversation.

05:05:37.305 --> 05:05:37.826
Kindergarten.

05:05:37.866 --> 05:05:51.640
For the 2021 school year and subsequent school years of the renewal, CDE is requiring 100% of the open slots will be allocated to FRPM students until the school reaches... Until the enrollment in kindergarten.

05:05:51.860 --> 05:05:54.262
Is it, well that's what my question was, until when?

05:05:54.302 --> 05:05:59.707
Is it until the kindergarten enrollment is, but the kindergarten enrollment is different each year, so is it until the whole school is?

05:05:59.727 --> 05:06:03.310
Until the percentage of enrollment in kindergarten is at 50%.

05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.630
Or more.

05:06:03.891 --> 05:06:04.151
Or more.

05:06:09.321 --> 05:06:11.382
It changes every year, so that doesn't make sense, because.

05:06:11.402 --> 05:06:14.524
Okay, okay, again, I understand it changes every year.

05:06:14.564 --> 05:06:25.969
What I'm saying, what I am saying is, whether you enroll, whether your enrollment is 35 students or 10 students, half of those students need to be on free and reduced lunch.

05:06:26.169 --> 05:06:32.212
But there are new kids coming in every year, so they don't, at the lottery, before these kids come, it's 100%

05:06:34.611 --> 05:06:38.032
is FRPM, until the whole school reaches 50% FRPM?

05:06:38.892 --> 05:06:42.052
Until the cohort.

05:06:42.192 --> 05:06:47.533
Okay, so it's different, until that kinder, all right, so here's what the cohort would be.

05:06:47.954 --> 05:06:52.414
So next year in 2021, they start this process.

05:06:52.454 --> 05:06:56.975
And 100% of those slots have to be for students on free and reduced lunch.

05:06:57.395 --> 05:07:00.296
That kindergarten class moves up to first grade.

05:07:00.956 --> 05:07:08.398
We're holding them accountable for what is the ratio of free and reduced lunch students in that first grade.

05:07:08.438 --> 05:07:10.339
They have to keep that floor at 30.

05:07:10.819 --> 05:07:14.420
I think that's different than what was said over here, so I just want to clarify.

05:07:14.840 --> 05:07:15.881
That's what she just said.

05:07:16.001 --> 05:07:19.282
Okay, so can I try?

05:07:19.302 --> 05:07:19.382
Yeah.

05:07:19.862 --> 05:07:20.802
I'll just try.

05:07:20.822 --> 05:07:25.044
And mistakes are honored here, right?

05:07:26.224 --> 05:07:28.345
Respected and inspected and corrected.

05:07:32.694 --> 05:07:45.949
In the kindergarten of the sixth grade, if I'm trying to go back to Member Sun's articulation of this, 100% of slots would go to free and reduced price lunch until a minimum of 50% of that cohort has been reached.

05:07:47.551 --> 05:07:48.853
Yes, we're agreeing with you.

05:07:50.833 --> 05:08:05.604
And then I think if we want to also have a concept of a minimum, we need to come back to that and say, at what point does that kick in?

05:08:05.644 --> 05:08:14.610
What I heard Felice saying was for those cohorts, as it's growing over time, they need to maintain at at least 33%

05:08:17.572 --> 05:08:21.714
FRPM, that's one version, but we have not kicked that one around the table yet.

05:08:22.234 --> 05:08:30.138
But I'd like to be sure we agree on the first piece, which was the, sorry, I think 50%.

05:08:30.658 --> 05:08:37.621
The 100% of FRL slots going, I thought was only applying for the sixth grade, so that all of the new slots.

05:08:37.701 --> 05:08:39.742
Until such time as you hit the 50%.

05:08:41.192 --> 05:08:46.097
Right, and then for the, but we're not saying that 100% of their kindergarten admission needs to be.

05:08:46.137 --> 05:08:47.178
No, no, no.

05:08:49.691 --> 05:08:50.591
I mean, that doesn't make sense.

05:08:50.691 --> 05:09:01.854
No, the way I understood the proposal is that you accept, once you've gotten to 50%, until you get to 50%, right?

05:09:01.874 --> 05:09:03.994
Yeah, but Kim's right.

05:09:04.134 --> 05:09:06.835
It's all open slots at kindergarten, right?

05:09:06.855 --> 05:09:07.595
It's all open slots.

05:09:07.655 --> 05:09:11.276
So at kindergarten, is it 50% of the open slots?

05:09:11.516 --> 05:09:14.317
Or it can't be 100% of the slots, because I guess that's everyone.

05:09:14.337 --> 05:09:15.557
I mean, I guess you could do that.

05:09:16.701 --> 05:09:17.442
That seems high.

05:09:17.842 --> 05:09:21.225
So for kindergarten, it's a certain percentage of the 100%.

05:09:22.526 --> 05:09:25.949
Well, there are all the slots are open because they're coming in.

05:09:27.991 --> 05:09:36.819
In other words, as a result of their lottery to recruit students to form their new kindergarten class.

05:09:37.754 --> 05:09:47.049
when they get done, and they publish a class list of their new kindergarten class.

05:09:48.551 --> 05:09:49.353
You with me so far?

05:09:50.254 --> 05:09:53.175
So what we're really talking about is two things.

05:09:53.515 --> 05:10:03.057
Recruitment strategies to ensure they goose how many people they target and ensure we'll turn in a form and say, please pick me, pick me.

05:10:04.077 --> 05:10:06.038
We're saying you're going to have to improve that.

05:10:06.458 --> 05:10:10.639
But then we're saying when you're done with the recruitment and the lottery is finished,

05:10:11.900 --> 05:10:18.949
You haven't been successful if over half the kids you enroll still are not reflecting the diversity of the district.

05:10:18.969 --> 05:10:23.294
So, we're saying when you publish that kindergarten class list,

05:10:24.457 --> 05:10:26.038
Now, and this is where it gets ticklish.

05:10:26.318 --> 05:10:35.623
We're saying that there needs to be a specific floor as to how many of those new kindergartners need to be on free and reduced lunch.

05:10:36.023 --> 05:10:45.287
And I suggested every new kindergarten class as a floor should start at 50% on free and reduced lunch.

05:10:45.368 --> 05:10:46.248
That's what I'm saying.

05:10:47.188 --> 05:10:56.490
And then I think what Ting was saying beyond that is for the sixth grade, 100% of slots go to FRPM students.

05:10:56.830 --> 05:10:58.510
For the first year that we do this?

05:10:58.530 --> 05:11:01.931
Until they reach 50% for the sixth grade cohort.

05:11:02.311 --> 05:11:02.591
Got it.

05:11:03.651 --> 05:11:13.393
Which allows some give and cushion so that if they can't reach the 50% in the first year, they could, you know, get to that over time.

05:11:14.898 --> 05:11:35.595
The fact that their first preference on their admissions is free and reduced lunch, if they have more than 50 percent of the open slots actually apply, all those slots, it could be 60 percent, 70 percent, those slots will go to the free and reduced lunch.

05:11:36.215 --> 05:11:37.616
families.

05:11:38.116 --> 05:11:51.545
So it's not just about reaching the 50%, it's whatever, by the very fact that their admissions has that preference in it, it's whatever percentages, all those students are going to be going into any open slot.

05:11:51.625 --> 05:11:53.607
Whether we put the 50% or not.

05:11:53.627 --> 05:11:55.808
Language will be at least, because, right.

05:11:55.928 --> 05:12:16.162
Well, and I could agree with you on that assumption, but I can't agree to the assumption because I don't know enough about who's on their waiting list to say they'll be good actors and behave and do that thing because the data doesn't say they've done that up to this point.

05:12:17.083 --> 05:12:17.863
Read what we've got.

05:12:18.324 --> 05:12:19.764
Yes, please.

05:12:20.565 --> 05:12:22.686
I know you all have flights to catch.

05:12:22.846 --> 05:12:24.707
We do and we need to move this.

05:12:25.267 --> 05:12:46.177
Kindergarten, for the 2021 school year and subsequent school years that are part of this renewal, CDE is requiring that 50% of the enrollment slots will be allocated to FRPM students until a minimum of 50% of that cohort reaches, well, until at least 50% of that cohort reaches FRPM.

05:12:53.686 --> 05:12:53.906
Okay.

05:12:54.747 --> 05:12:55.187
Okay, got it.

05:12:57.449 --> 05:12:58.450
Yeah, all open.

05:12:58.570 --> 05:13:03.474
This is different than what is on the screen and what Kai was earlier saying.

05:13:04.195 --> 05:13:11.781
So I just want to make it clear this is a change from what the CDE recommendation may have been for the sixth grade.

05:13:11.801 --> 05:13:18.347
It is saying 50% of all open slots will be allocated

05:13:21.109 --> 05:13:22.130
50% of all open slots?

05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:24.112
No, just all open slots will be.

05:13:24.212 --> 05:13:25.913
Are you talking sixth grade or kindergarten?

05:13:26.354 --> 05:13:27.474
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:13:27.775 --> 05:13:29.216
Let Judy try to get us.

05:13:29.576 --> 05:13:30.777
OK, well, let me read what I got.

05:13:30.837 --> 05:13:33.539
For kindergarten, let's start with for kindergarten.

05:13:33.559 --> 05:13:45.329
OK, for kindergarten, 2021 school year and subsequent school years, 50% of all open slots will be allocated to FRPM students until a minimum of 50% of that cohort is FRPM. 50%.

05:13:48.171 --> 05:13:48.411
No?

05:13:48.611 --> 05:13:53.013
That's not right?

05:13:54.653 --> 05:14:03.176
Any pre-reduced lunch student that applies in kindergarten will be getting in because their admission is 50%.

05:14:03.556 --> 05:14:08.678
You're just saying your preference is any student that has that is going to be coming in.

05:14:10.598 --> 05:14:11.699
They get first preference.

05:14:11.719 --> 05:14:14.640
You have siblings and others that are in the list.

05:14:19.437 --> 05:14:22.480
Yeah.

05:14:23.201 --> 05:14:24.543
Well, no, I thought we thought we needed it.

05:14:27.306 --> 05:14:32.471
I thought we thought we needed it so that it would end after we track them in first and second and third grade.

05:14:32.651 --> 05:14:36.115
That's why I had it going forward, but maybe I misunderstood it.

05:14:36.235 --> 05:14:40.340
Okay, so let me try one more time.

05:14:41.178 --> 05:14:59.502
The end result, the goal for the kindergarten class is to make sure as a floor, the students in the kindergarten class have a composition where at least half of them are on free and reduced lunch.

05:14:59.942 --> 05:15:04.983
That is different from saying that they need to look at their applicants

05:15:05.683 --> 05:15:12.308
and ensure that they need to guarantee that half their applicants are on free and reduced lunch.

05:15:12.368 --> 05:15:13.429
That's not what we're saying.

05:15:13.909 --> 05:15:27.200
We're saying that when they are skimming through their applications, they need to make sure, based on this enrollment preference we're trying to create, that the kindergarten applicants who are on free and reduced lunch

05:15:27.760 --> 05:15:35.163
know that they're going to get in because you're trying to get to this 50% floor of enrollment.

05:15:36.063 --> 05:15:37.704
So you don't need to say 50% twice.

05:15:37.904 --> 05:15:42.785
It's not 50% of who you recruit ending up with 50% of who's enrolled.

05:15:43.166 --> 05:15:55.210
We're saying when you're done with all your recruitment and you evaluate the success of your recruitment, you've met our condition if half of your kindergartners that you've enrolled are on free and reduced lunch.

05:16:00.745 --> 05:16:01.926
Do you want to speak to this?

05:16:02.406 --> 05:16:04.688
I think there's a question about how the lottery operates.

05:16:04.728 --> 05:16:06.989
I suggest maybe that we move on to the other items.

05:16:07.209 --> 05:16:11.532
I'm going to sit down with Janelle and staff and we will type something up and come back.

05:16:12.153 --> 05:16:12.833
That sounds good.

05:16:13.033 --> 05:16:22.860
So let's... Okay, so we're going to come back to this and let me ask the person who from, was it Young Mini?

05:16:24.341 --> 05:16:27.143
Did you want to say something about the lottery functioning or something?

05:16:28.083 --> 05:16:29.484
Yeah, talk to Judy, that sounds good.

05:16:29.504 --> 05:16:34.490
I also just want to say thank you to Judy for taking all of the multiple pieces of feedback.

05:16:36.091 --> 05:16:36.452
Thank you.

05:16:36.632 --> 05:16:40.336
I think we're getting very close to understanding what the goals are.

05:16:41.176 --> 05:16:50.346
And so we'll come back and hopefully have a very clear articulation that we can then actually take up and vote on.

05:16:52.722 --> 05:17:02.725
I hesitate to give us a break because I know some people have flights that they want to catch so I'm going to encourage you to take a break as you need one and that we're going to try to move expeditiously through the other items.

05:17:02.745 --> 05:17:13.408
So we're going to move to agenda item 19 which is to consider California's application to the United States Department of Education for funds available through the 2020 to 2023 federal charter schools program.

05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:28.615
The CDE recommends that the State Board approve and direct the CDE to apply for up to $45 million in federal funds under the federal CSP for a total grant award period of three years.

05:17:28.675 --> 05:17:30.336
I'm going to pass the ball.

05:17:30.816 --> 05:17:32.957
I thought I was passing it to Lisa Constancio.

05:17:37.960 --> 05:17:39.220
This is on, okay.

05:17:40.341 --> 05:17:43.942
Hi, I'm Stephanie Farland, I'm the director of the Charter Schools Division.

05:17:45.883 --> 05:17:48.024
I am hoping that this will go quickly.

05:17:49.144 --> 05:17:54.066
And there's not a whole lot of questions about this.

05:17:54.166 --> 05:17:58.788
So today we are talking about,

05:17:59.868 --> 05:18:14.693
The Charter School, Federal Charter School Program is a federal grant, federal competitive grant to provide assistance, financial assistance to charter schools to plan, implement, replicate and expand high quality charter schools.

05:18:15.353 --> 05:18:24.556
It also provides funding for technical assistance to charter schools and authorizers related to best practice and also it provides funding for the,

05:18:25.976 --> 05:18:30.180
administration of the grant for CDE and the State Board to administer the grant.

05:18:31.181 --> 05:18:45.494
So today we are asking for the CDE to approve and direct us to apply for $45 million in federal funds for a total grant award period of three years.

05:18:47.717 --> 05:18:57.710
We will be doing the work in consultation with the Executive Director of the State Board and State Board liaisons to perform all necessary activities to finalize the CSP application.

05:18:59.813 --> 05:19:15.201
Purposes of the charter school grant really is to expand opportunities for all students, particularly traditionally underserved students, to attend public charter schools and also meet challenging state academic standards.

05:19:15.602 --> 05:19:20.504
Provide financial assistance, as I said a moment ago, for planning, program design, and initial implementation.

05:19:20.964 --> 05:19:23.126
Increase the number of high quality charter schools.

05:19:23.946 --> 05:19:36.333
evaluate the impact of charter schools on student achievement, families and communities, share best practices between charter schools and public schools, traditional public schools, and support efforts to strengthen the charter school authorization process.

05:19:41.213 --> 05:19:48.997
So there are some application evaluation criteria that the federal government, the Department of Ed has.

05:19:49.037 --> 05:19:57.481
The Secretary of Education has outlined the following there as specific criteria from which all applications will be evaluated.

05:19:59.622 --> 05:20:21.659
Quality of the project design, ambitiousness of the state entity objectives, obviously the quality of subgrant applicants, the way we monitor the subgrants, they'll look at that plan, the quality of management plan, which means that we have the appropriate staffing and time commitments to ensuring that the grant is managed appropriately.

05:20:22.379 --> 05:20:30.245
And effectively, parent and community involvement in implementation and operation of charter schools in the state and degree of flexibility afforded to charter schools under state education code.

05:20:30.465 --> 05:20:33.467
So they look at all of that.

05:20:33.527 --> 05:20:38.971
The CSP funding may be used for four types of subgrants, planning, implementation, replication, and expansion.

05:20:39.712 --> 05:20:42.013
Planning is obviously for new startup charter schools.

05:20:42.374 --> 05:20:46.136
Implementation for schools in their first two years of operation.

05:20:46.597 --> 05:20:49.058
Replication are subgrants for charter schools

05:20:52.021 --> 05:21:00.391
and are used with respect to high quality charter schools, and then expansion subgrants for high quality charter schools who've been open for at least three years.

05:21:00.851 --> 05:21:06.298
And these subgrants provide funding to cover the costs of adding new grade levels to existing charter schools.

05:21:07.757 --> 05:21:36.270
So there is a need for a definition of high-quality charter schools, and the CDE is proposing, since we just adopted AB 1505, and there are a three-tier renewal track, and we do talk in that track, there is some definition around what a high-quality school is in terms of renewal, we would like to use that highest track for our definition of high-quality charter schools.

05:21:39.822 --> 05:21:52.566
And then obviously the federal government has their own definition of high quality, which means that the school has had no significant issues in the areas of student safety, financial, operational management, or statutory or regulatory compliance.

05:21:53.227 --> 05:21:56.968
And then added into that, and it shouldn't actually be a sub-bullet because it's different,

05:21:57.408 --> 05:22:05.249
than the federal qualification is how the school will comply with requirements of Senate Bill 126, which went into effect this year.

05:22:05.970 --> 05:22:17.472
And if you remember, that clarifies certain transparency and conflict of interest laws that will now apply to charter schools, such as Brown Act, California Public Records Act, Political Reform Act, and Government Code 1090.

05:22:17.872 --> 05:22:21.852
And so that will also need to be a piece of any of the subgrantees going forward.

05:22:21.872 --> 05:22:24.413
We need to see their plan on how they'll comply with that.

05:22:26.280 --> 05:22:28.761
Quick recap of what we have had in the past.

05:22:29.982 --> 05:22:37.307
The last two grant awards, 2010 to 2015, we were awarded $273 million and some change.

05:22:38.767 --> 05:22:43.990
That ended in 2018, and we awarded over 400 planning and implementation subgrants.

05:22:44.091 --> 05:22:46.932
We returned $20 million to the education department.

05:22:47.553 --> 05:22:48.973
From 2016 to 2019, we received 49, almost $50 million, $49 million.

05:22:55.437 --> 05:23:00.481
And one no-cost extension, that grant we are currently in and it expires June 30th of 2020.

05:23:00.601 --> 05:23:07.406
We have awarded 84 planning and implementation grants, 8 expansion and 4 dissemination subgrants.

05:23:07.986 --> 05:23:14.150
And we're on schedule to return approximately $4 million to the education department.

05:23:15.591 --> 05:23:24.896
We have a long history of approving, State Board has a long history of approving the Charter School Division to apply for the grant, so back 1995 on through to 2016.

05:23:26.416 --> 05:23:30.978
We have successfully completed the application process and awarded a grant in each of these terms.

05:23:32.259 --> 05:23:39.302
If approved today by the State Board, the Charter School Division staff are ready to submit another successful application.

05:23:39.322 --> 05:23:40.223
We've been working on it.

05:23:40.643 --> 05:23:44.707
The federal government has not released the application yet.

05:23:45.488 --> 05:23:49.132
I believe they're planning to sometime soon, in the middle of January.

05:23:49.752 --> 05:23:55.698
We were expecting it a few weeks ago, so we're just waiting, but not waiting idly by.

05:23:55.878 --> 05:24:00.303
The staff has been working on it, and so we'll be ready to go when the grant opens.

05:24:02.184 --> 05:24:05.587
will be good ways towards that.

05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:13.753
Prior to submission of the grant application, we will be gathering stakeholder input, so that's an important piece of this.

05:24:15.630 --> 05:24:22.354
And if funded, this application will result in a $45 million grant in local assistance funds, three years.

05:24:23.315 --> 05:24:33.741
We're hoping to award to 80 subgrants, 80 subgrant awards, and also includes $4 million in funding for technical assistance activities and administrative oversight.

05:24:36.334 --> 05:24:36.874
Any questions?

05:24:37.215 --> 05:24:46.562
So the summary basically is that we would like your approval to apply for the grants for $45 million in federal funds for a three-year period.

05:24:46.582 --> 05:24:51.586
Our liaison, Sue Burr, and then I'll go to clarifying questions.

05:24:52.213 --> 05:24:52.553
Thank you.

05:24:52.633 --> 05:24:53.374
Thanks, Stephanie.

05:24:53.394 --> 05:24:55.596
I appreciate your update.

05:24:55.976 --> 05:24:58.097
I have a couple of sort of technical questions.

05:24:58.398 --> 05:25:14.710
One is the funding, the approximately $4.15 million for technical assistance activities, is that just related to oversight of the grant or can that be used more flexibly for oversight or general oversight for charter schools?

05:25:17.938 --> 05:25:18.919
just for the grant.

05:25:19.360 --> 05:25:24.525
And then the second one is on the recap of our prior funding awards.

05:25:25.106 --> 05:25:31.913
Can you explain to me why we are returning so much money to the federal government, $20 million one time and this time $4 million?

05:25:32.394 --> 05:25:34.536
I would love to have someone come up and

05:25:37.717 --> 05:25:40.498
Kiyomi, who has been working on the grant.

05:25:40.739 --> 05:25:41.679
Hi, I'm Kiyomi Meeker.

05:25:41.819 --> 05:25:47.242
I'm former project director of the charter school grant program.

05:25:47.962 --> 05:25:51.564
In 2010, I believe we were overambitious in what we asked for.

05:25:52.364 --> 05:25:57.707
And so we can only give out the funds to charter schools.

05:25:58.487 --> 05:25:59.908
And you can't use them for anything else.

05:25:59.988 --> 05:26:04.710
And so if the charter schools don't meet the requirements of the grant, we can't award it to them.

05:26:04.990 --> 05:26:06.211
And so we didn't have enough.

05:26:07.648 --> 05:26:08.629
eligible applicants.

05:26:08.649 --> 05:26:27.861
We did the three-year no-cost extension on that particular grant and did our very, very best to get all of it out, and then ultimately decided to move forward with a new grant, return the money, and then we had some additional flexibilities with the new ESSA legislation that allowed us to continue funding.

05:26:28.121 --> 05:26:34.726
So the last grant was a little bit more conservative, and so that's why there's less funds being returned.

05:26:40.063 --> 05:26:44.245
Member Rucker and then we'll take clarifying questions from others if there are any.

05:26:44.866 --> 05:26:52.510
I'm always happy to be second to Board Member Burr in asking questions because she asked both of the questions I was going to ask so thank you.

05:26:52.530 --> 05:26:58.573
Other clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

05:26:59.994 --> 05:27:03.195
All right thank you very much we're going to go to public comment.

05:27:03.396 --> 05:27:04.456
Do we have any?

05:27:04.836 --> 05:27:05.056
None.

05:27:05.977 --> 05:27:06.937
No public comment.

05:27:07.518 --> 05:27:07.818
All right.

05:27:09.384 --> 05:27:10.165
Do I have a motion?

05:27:10.185 --> 05:27:20.730
I would move the department's recommendation that they be authorized to apply for $45 million in federal funds for the charter public school grant program.

05:27:21.150 --> 05:27:21.830
Do I have a second?

05:27:22.151 --> 05:27:22.651
I'll second.

05:27:25.532 --> 05:27:26.693
I'm not sure who was first.

05:27:26.833 --> 05:27:28.954
I'll second.

05:27:29.154 --> 05:27:29.835
All right, thank you.

05:27:31.575 --> 05:27:32.636
Is there any further discussion?

05:27:34.935 --> 05:27:38.216
Hearing none, I will call for a vote.

05:27:38.256 --> 05:27:39.577
All those in favor say aye.

05:27:40.337 --> 05:27:40.437
Aye.

05:27:40.778 --> 05:27:41.778
Any opposed say nay.

05:27:42.538 --> 05:27:43.319
Any abstentions?

05:27:44.119 --> 05:27:45.260
Okay, the motion carries.

05:27:46.100 --> 05:27:46.620
Thank you.

05:27:46.760 --> 05:27:48.081
That was very quick.

05:27:48.581 --> 05:27:50.622
I was going to say Lisa, but I apologize.

05:27:55.438 --> 05:28:00.642
Yeah, I'm going to go on to item 1, reopen agenda item 1.

05:28:02.523 --> 05:28:06.966
Then when we see the lawyers come back, we'll be ready to go back to number 18.

05:28:08.407 --> 05:28:23.917
So we will now reopen agenda item 1, our State Board projects and priorities item, to take up our minutes from the November 2019 meeting, consider the State Board Screening Committee's recommendations for appointment to the ACCS, and receive SBE liaison reports.

05:28:25.158 --> 05:28:53.261
So the state board staff recommends that we first approve the preliminary report of actions minutes for the November 6 2019 meeting And second consider the screening recommendations for appointments to the Advisory Committee on charter schools to have a motion from a board member to approve the November 6 2019 State Board of Education draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes

05:28:54.909 --> 05:28:55.669
Thank you very much.

05:28:55.689 --> 05:28:56.570
Second?

05:28:56.610 --> 05:28:56.950
Second.

05:28:57.850 --> 05:28:58.330
Thank you.

05:29:00.611 --> 05:29:01.351
Any discussion?

05:29:06.313 --> 05:29:07.053
No discussion.

05:29:07.193 --> 05:29:08.194
Any public comments?

05:29:11.475 --> 05:29:12.135
I don't believe so.

05:29:12.695 --> 05:29:13.116
Okay.

05:29:13.456 --> 05:29:15.977
If there's no public comment, we are ready to vote.

05:29:17.117 --> 05:29:18.237
All those in favor say aye.

05:29:18.257 --> 05:29:18.317
Aye.

05:29:19.258 --> 05:29:19.958
Any opposed?

05:29:20.418 --> 05:29:21.259
Any abstentions?

05:29:21.599 --> 05:29:22.219
Motion carries.

05:29:24.229 --> 05:29:24.569
Thank you.

05:29:25.170 --> 05:29:25.830
One abstention.

05:29:27.871 --> 05:29:36.836
Second, I'll ask Vice President Strauss as chair of the State Board Screening Committee to share the committee's recommendations regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

05:29:37.737 --> 05:29:41.959
So you have a blue addendum and I'll just kind of summarize.

05:29:42.700 --> 05:29:45.721
We saw applications for the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

05:29:45.741 --> 05:29:47.162
We call that ACCS.

05:29:47.562 --> 05:29:49.243
We look for that in the fall of 2019.

05:29:49.904 --> 05:29:51.325
We reached out very, very far.

05:29:51.365 --> 05:29:53.426
We got 70 applications.

05:29:53.986 --> 05:29:57.049
They were submitted on time, and we reviewed the screening committee.

05:29:57.129 --> 05:30:03.916
So, Kim Petit-Bronson and Feliz Ortiz-Lincon and staff members from CDE and State Board went through all of them.

05:30:03.956 --> 05:30:08.019
We narrowed it to 17 applications to do full interviews with.

05:30:08.780 --> 05:30:13.244
So, just so you know, ACCS has commissioners that represent one or more of the following groups.

05:30:14.025 --> 05:30:22.811
school district superintendents, charter schools, teachers, parents and guardians, members of governing boards of school districts and county superintendent of schools.

05:30:23.531 --> 05:30:32.097
Also the state superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurman, also appoints a single member of his or her choosing to ACCS.

05:30:32.598 --> 05:30:37.201
So today the screening committee is recommending three commissioners for reappointment.

05:30:38.081 --> 05:30:41.604
First, Wes Siever to serve as chair of ACCS.

05:30:41.644 --> 05:30:45.227
Wes is the superintendent of Kingsburg Elementary Charter School District.

05:30:45.688 --> 05:30:48.730
He's been the chair and he will represent school district superintendents.

05:30:49.070 --> 05:30:51.092
We're recommending him for a one-year term.

05:30:51.112 --> 05:30:53.954
We're staggering the terms to try to build some stability.

05:30:54.495 --> 05:31:00.360
As it just turned out that all the terms were up at one time and we wanted some continuity like we do in all of our commissions.

05:31:00.960 --> 05:31:04.161
Gail Garbolino-Mohica is recommended for a two-year term of office.

05:31:04.201 --> 05:31:10.804
She's the Placer County Superintendent of Schools, and she'll represent county superintendents of schools on the commission, and she's been on the commission.

05:31:11.424 --> 05:31:15.345
And Jared Austin, who's recommended also for a two-year term, he's a reappointment.

05:31:15.786 --> 05:31:22.388
He's a parent of two children who currently attend a charter school, and also the director and founder of Kairos Public School in Vacaville.

05:31:22.668 --> 05:31:27.810
So we have three now that are reappointments, and then the rest are all new appointments to it.

05:31:28.885 --> 05:31:30.486
We recommend the following new appointments.

05:31:30.586 --> 05:31:32.708
Erica Jones recommended for 1 year term.

05:31:32.728 --> 05:31:35.730
She's a kindergarten teacher in Los Angeles unified school district.

05:31:36.150 --> 05:31:38.112
She'll be representing teachers on the commission.

05:31:38.672 --> 05:31:42.055
Brent Walmsley Walmsley is recommended for 1 year term.

05:31:42.095 --> 05:31:47.319
He's an English teacher at the Vinci rise high school that reaches foster youth and homeless students.

05:31:48.159 --> 05:31:50.141
He'll be representing teachers on the commission.

05:31:50.842 --> 05:31:53.905
Mike Walsh is represented, is recommended for a two year term.

05:31:53.965 --> 05:32:00.411
He's been a trustee for the Butte County Office of Education since 2010, so a board member governing.

05:32:01.152 --> 05:32:04.595
He will represent members of governing boards of school districts.

05:32:05.965 --> 05:32:08.506
Esau Baruman is recommended for a two-year term.

05:32:08.546 --> 05:32:14.810
He's the principal of a dependent charter school in the Hawthorne School District, representing charter schools on the commission.

05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:17.651
And the fifth new appointment is Cameron Curry.

05:32:17.711 --> 05:32:19.472
He's recommended for a one-year term.

05:32:19.872 --> 05:32:27.076
He's the chief executive officer for Classical Academies, and will also represent charter schools on ACCS.

05:32:28.405 --> 05:32:43.733
The screening committee really wants to thank all the applicants who applied to serve on the pool was amazingly well qualified, like, exceptional just to narrow down who we would interview the screening committee really appreciates the willingness of these interviews to.

05:32:44.253 --> 05:32:46.974
these individuals to support the state board with the charter work.

05:32:47.034 --> 05:32:49.334
Their vetting and ACCS really matters.

05:32:49.414 --> 05:32:51.555
As you can see, these are really complicated hearings.

05:32:52.695 --> 05:33:02.217
The applicants who were not selected, we're going to really encourage you to apply again when we seek applications in the fall of 2020 because some of our members come up at the end of one year.

05:33:02.297 --> 05:33:09.638
So we did set it up to stagger the appointments and we've told the applicants as we've called them, please consider reapplying.

05:33:10.078 --> 05:33:13.419
We don't have an endless number of seats on a commission.

05:33:14.099 --> 05:33:22.521
This is a wonderful representative, I think, of a really balanced commission to consider, especially because the law stays the same through June and then changes in July.

05:33:22.642 --> 05:33:27.243
So these are our recommendations from the screening committee to the State Board.

05:33:27.263 --> 05:33:29.604
All right, thank you very much.

05:33:30.064 --> 05:33:31.584
Is there a motion?

05:33:31.764 --> 05:33:33.705
So I'll make a motion to approve the appointments.

05:33:33.725 --> 05:33:34.965
Okay, is there a second?

05:33:36.005 --> 05:33:36.786
Thank you very much.

05:33:37.306 --> 05:33:38.006
Any discussion?

05:33:47.110 --> 05:33:50.673
We know you're interested in your recommendations, but that's perfectly appropriate.

05:33:53.555 --> 05:33:54.976
Are there any public comments?

05:33:57.947 --> 05:34:01.569
Seeing no public comments, we can take a vote.

05:34:01.930 --> 05:34:02.930
All in favor say aye.

05:34:03.631 --> 05:34:03.731
Aye.

05:34:03.871 --> 05:34:04.511
Any opposed?

05:34:04.792 --> 05:34:05.052
Nay.

05:34:05.792 --> 05:34:06.693
Any abstentions?

05:34:07.433 --> 05:34:08.294
All right, thank you.

05:34:10.195 --> 05:34:18.581
And we're still waiting, so I'm going to ask our state board members to report out on liaison activities that are not related to items in our agenda.

05:34:19.221 --> 05:34:23.142
And then we'll come back to that item 18.

05:34:23.722 --> 05:34:35.285
So I had promised I would start in the middle of the alphabet this time to recognize the underrepresented middle of the alphabet people because they never get to go first.

05:34:35.685 --> 05:34:38.606
So I'm actually going to start with member Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:34:41.311 --> 05:34:48.743
Thank you and I do want to apologize ahead of time when we change, we anticipated that the hearing would be not take so long.

05:34:48.763 --> 05:34:52.949
I changed my flight and made the mistake of promising my kids I would be home for dinner in Southern California.

05:34:53.430 --> 05:34:56.254
So I hate to miss the after party, but it looks like I may.

05:34:57.355 --> 05:35:02.859
My only liaison assignment, I actually went to visit Garden Grove Unified.

05:35:02.879 --> 05:35:12.305
I was invited by Dr. Gabriela Maffi to visit two of the schools, Monroe Elementary, which is a 9010, and Santiago High School, which is an AVID demonstration site.

05:35:13.126 --> 05:35:16.788
I want to thank Garden Grove for having such a warm welcome.

05:35:16.888 --> 05:35:21.932
I'm actually going to be speaking to students from Latinos Unidos on Saturday as a board member.

05:35:22.452 --> 05:35:34.458
But I just want to say one thing that struck me about Dr. Maffi's leadership is that every teacher, staff member, she herself mentors 100 students in the district herself.

05:35:35.318 --> 05:35:50.465
And just seeing that leadership and how approachable and accessible she was, making sure that she implements equity practices when she assumed the role, she asked to see all the data for AP courses to see how many Latino students were actually enrolled.

05:35:51.045 --> 05:35:54.828
and no surprise they were under enrolled in a district where they are the majority.

05:35:55.388 --> 05:36:07.376
And so she has worked with her staff to build the structures and protocols to make sure that there is equity in place when we are also scheduling our students to make sure that we are preparing all kids for college and career readiness.

05:36:07.756 --> 05:36:11.119
So thank you Garden Grove and I look forward to seeing Latinos Unidos on Saturday.

05:36:11.619 --> 05:36:12.740
Terrific, thank you.

05:36:12.760 --> 05:36:17.102
Member Petillo-Bronson, since we're in the middle of the alphabet, I'm going to go to you.

05:36:17.122 --> 05:36:22.424
Then student member, then I'm going to go to member Navo, so that we're going in both directions.

05:36:23.705 --> 05:36:33.690
In addition to the work of the screening committee, there was a environmental and climate change literacy summit that I attended on behalf of board member

05:36:34.591 --> 05:36:37.714
Strauss at UCLA, at the Luskin School.

05:36:38.855 --> 05:36:41.618
It was, actually I attended the first day of it.

05:36:42.579 --> 05:36:54.493
And the goal that they have set out between the UC and CSU system is to educate 500,000 high school students per year in California to become literate in environmental and climate change issues.

05:36:55.373 --> 05:37:07.657
One of the more fascinating highlights was that we heard from a member of the Italian educational glitterati.

05:37:07.697 --> 05:37:19.120
I can't remember his title, but what was very intriguing is that they've actually now mandated, starting in elementary school, climate change education as part of their core curriculum.

05:37:20.160 --> 05:37:32.646
because there are so many impacts that children are actually experiencing in their daily lives, but also for a sense of imbuing environmental stewardship as part of what is core to their education.

05:37:34.266 --> 05:37:49.713
There were a host of both teachers, administrators, school policymakers who are also present, and they will be continuing their convening efforts to try and expand that number of high school students per year that are becoming environmentally literate.

05:37:50.748 --> 05:37:51.328
Very cool.

05:37:51.448 --> 05:37:52.309
Thank you very much.

05:37:53.729 --> 05:38:01.453
And before I turn to Brenna's report, I just want to note that she's been admitted to Brown University and will be attending in the fall.

05:38:02.873 --> 05:38:03.453
Congratulations.

05:38:03.473 --> 05:38:04.734
It's a great school.

05:38:05.454 --> 05:38:07.355
You have to come back to California, however.

05:38:07.375 --> 05:38:08.776
Thank you so much.

05:38:08.956 --> 05:38:11.617
We have a condition on approving your going to Brown.

05:38:14.921 --> 05:38:26.847
So similar to the last meeting when students came and proposed ideas, the California Association of Student Councils put on the Student Advisory Board on Legislation and Education Conference.

05:38:26.987 --> 05:38:34.590
And students were here in the state capitol yesterday and proposed bills to the Senate and Assembly Education Committees.

05:38:34.691 --> 05:38:39.353
So they spent days working in preparation for these proposals.

05:38:40.622 --> 05:38:49.790
On January 31st, I am planning on attending a World of Work tour in El Cajon, which is luckily an opportunity right in my area.

05:38:50.671 --> 05:39:06.185
And World of Work is a career education curriculum created and practiced in the Cajon Valley Union School District in San Diego County, which has grown to become a prime example of bringing career technical education to K-12 schools with a unique approach

05:39:06.665 --> 05:39:08.786
to bringing that into early education.

05:39:09.947 --> 05:39:18.790
So leaders in education from not only this state but other states have been touring schools in Cajon Valley School District and learning from their curriculum.

05:39:18.950 --> 05:39:23.732
So I look forward to learning something and maybe bringing back some best practices to share.

05:39:23.752 --> 05:39:31.896
And I was also able to witness the swearing in of San Diego Unified School District's very first student board member.

05:39:33.036 --> 05:39:37.239
So it was great to see a district prioritizing student voice and taking this step.

05:39:37.959 --> 05:39:42.482
However, I still know that there are many districts who don't have student representation on their boards.

05:39:43.182 --> 05:39:52.448
So although it can't be required, I think it's important that districts are encouraged at a state level toward including student voices in their decisions.

05:39:53.288 --> 05:40:01.293
Change is difficult and transparency is difficult, but I think it's an important part in closing the gap between governing boards and communities.

05:40:01.872 --> 05:40:02.172
Thank you.

05:40:04.213 --> 05:40:04.814
Member Navo.

05:40:05.854 --> 05:40:17.842
So I had my first liaison assignment officially as chair of the CCEE, and no one wanted SUBR back more than I did at that time.

05:40:18.262 --> 05:40:22.625
So just to be in complete transparency, there was one person in there that was wishing you were there.

05:40:23.665 --> 05:40:28.989
But in honor of your efforts, it was a well-oiled machine.

05:40:29.029 --> 05:40:33.853
They held their meeting in San Diego for the CSBA conference.

05:40:34.573 --> 05:40:41.959
And they were able to lift up some relevant conversations that are really important in the system of support conversation.

05:40:42.459 --> 05:40:48.244
One of which was the learning labor management initiative that is coming out of the community engagement work.

05:40:49.004 --> 05:40:52.107
in Monterey County with Al-Asal Union School District.

05:40:52.167 --> 05:41:01.315
And there's some really important and good work going on system-wide that is touching the hearts of the educator in the classroom.

05:41:01.335 --> 05:41:02.576
And I think that's really important.

05:41:02.596 --> 05:41:04.298
It's been a challenge in the system of support.

05:41:05.118 --> 05:41:19.005
But going forward, what I want to commend Director Armolino on is I think the two things that are going to be clear as we move forward is, one, defining really clear roles, responsibilities, and obligations in the system of support.

05:41:19.886 --> 05:41:25.709
Two, lifting up the improvement, making the improvement of the system of support visible so that people understand it.

05:41:25.829 --> 05:41:28.130
And number two, people know what it can do for you.

05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:31.852
And that means all hands on deck communicating that the impact

05:41:33.072 --> 05:41:34.954
What does it mean when we say system of support?

05:41:35.334 --> 05:41:37.055
How does it impact teachers in the classroom?

05:41:37.095 --> 05:41:38.416
How does it support administrators?

05:41:38.456 --> 05:41:41.478
And what are the roles and responsibilities of each entity that's involved with that?

05:41:41.999 --> 05:41:43.400
And that's been a real challenge.

05:41:43.960 --> 05:41:53.047
Sue and I have talked about how to help that happen in a large system that's complex like ours, but I really feel confident going forward that

05:41:53.607 --> 05:42:05.710
This will be a year that CCE will bring some visibility to that and help bring to light all the good work that's happening across the state and orchestrate it in such a way we can make the right impacts where we need them.

05:42:06.371 --> 05:42:10.312
So, I appreciate it.

05:42:10.332 --> 05:42:12.832
Go to Member Sandoval and then back to Member Burr.

05:42:12.852 --> 05:42:15.153
I'm going in both directions.

05:42:16.545 --> 05:42:28.250
So on November the 14th in 2019, I attended the IQC meeting in my role as a liaison to the IQC.

05:42:28.691 --> 05:42:34.673
And it was actually, it was an excellent meeting, but it was a very emotional day, and for a lot of reasons.

05:42:35.114 --> 05:42:43.377
I wanna begin by saying the day began with a closed session, and during the closed session, we approved the, they,

05:42:44.978 --> 05:42:47.039
I'm saying we just because I was there.

05:42:47.760 --> 05:42:54.444
They approved the appointment of a new executive director and secretary for the IQC, Shanine Coates.

05:42:54.764 --> 05:43:04.871
And that was part of the emotional part of the day because we first met Stephanie Gregson when she took over her position as the executive director for the IQC.

05:43:04.931 --> 05:43:10.855
And in many ways, the IQC grew in depth and impact.

05:43:11.275 --> 05:43:21.058
under Stephanie's leadership, so it was heartfelt and bittersweet to see Stephanie depart, and I'm happy she's sitting next to you right now, Linda, so she would be able to hear me say these words.

05:43:21.858 --> 05:43:28.579
But then when Shanine stepped in, part of what Shanine did was she shared with the commission her story.

05:43:29.280 --> 05:43:34.221
And I was reminded at the time as I listened to her story, and I offered her this advice,

05:43:34.941 --> 05:43:46.467
that for women of color who find themselves in high profile or high visibility positions, people often look at you and they see a black woman first and they think they know your story.

05:43:47.007 --> 05:43:58.173
And what I applaud Shanine for was not only was she willing to share her story, but she made clear, I am more than just what you see and I am more and beyond what is in my background.

05:43:58.533 --> 05:44:00.154
So I was happy to see her there.

05:44:00.214 --> 05:44:03.095
I was happy to see her elevated to this position.

05:44:03.436 --> 05:44:13.181
But more importantly, the IQC was 100% behind her work and the work that she has already demonstrated to them in her leadership role in the department.

05:44:13.481 --> 05:44:19.624
So they were very excited to see her take that seat and at the same time sad to see Stephanie go.

05:44:19.684 --> 05:44:22.966
So that's part of what contribute to the emotions of the day.

05:44:23.546 --> 05:44:35.371
As part of the agenda, a lot of the work was devoted to the time on listening to preparations and the background and foundational work of the Mathematics Subject Matter Committee.

05:44:35.851 --> 05:44:45.155
It included a report on the mathematics focus groups that were held and the public comment received regarding the revision of the math framework.

05:44:45.295 --> 05:44:48.737
They also took a look at the draft guidelines for the curriculum framework.

05:44:49.421 --> 05:44:54.225
and they made recommendations on who the Curriculum Framework Committee would be.

05:44:54.606 --> 05:45:07.237
And so again, they took a great deal of time and were very thoughtful, not only in reviewing as it relates to the composition of the Framework Committee, they were very thoughtful and took a great deal of time before they came to the meeting

05:45:07.597 --> 05:45:10.399
to review the background and the applications of the members.

05:45:10.859 --> 05:45:24.708
They were also very careful to take a look at not only balance and distribution, but form and function, understanding that just because you are an educator, you don't have the same frame of mind based on your assignment.

05:45:25.048 --> 05:45:28.891
And so they were very thoughtful about looking at who was going to form that committee.

05:45:29.485 --> 05:45:42.690
And in looking at the draft guidelines, they took a great deal of time to really look at the, and I'm gonna use this word purposely, it's my word, not theirs, the mistakes, the things we learned from the first math framework.

05:45:42.730 --> 05:45:47.012
That was the first framework written after the implementation of the Common Core.

05:45:47.472 --> 05:45:51.154
We have successively gotten better with the development of each framework.

05:45:51.694 --> 05:45:57.016
And we learned from what was done well in each of the successive frameworks.

05:45:57.376 --> 05:46:00.597
that we didn't have a chance to consider with the math framework.

05:46:01.037 --> 05:46:12.460
And so in looking at not only the report from the focus groups, but also looking at what the draft guidelines looked like, they were very thoughtful in adding revisions to those draft guidelines.

05:46:12.840 --> 05:46:20.322
For us, the next step is working with the writers to start doing that development process, and we are looking forward to, as Shanine said,

05:46:21.122 --> 05:46:25.345
six two-day sessions, not two six-day sessions.

05:46:25.405 --> 05:46:28.527
My employer would, you know, abalk at that if that happened.

05:46:28.767 --> 05:46:34.171
So, it'll be a series of six two-day sessions for working on the development of the framework itself.

05:46:34.211 --> 05:46:37.633
And so, they're very enthusiastically looking forward to that.

05:46:38.274 --> 05:46:45.519
And then finally, we said goodbye to four commission members with a lunch that followed after the commission meeting.

05:46:46.219 --> 05:46:50.202
And Stephanie, I'm going to ask you to help me in case I forget somebody.

05:46:50.542 --> 05:47:10.594
But those four commission members that we said goodbye to were the current chair, Su Min Chao, and outgoing chair, yeah, Lisette Diaz, along with, I can't remember who the other two were.

05:47:15.194 --> 05:47:16.395
Nicole Naditz, yes.

05:47:17.116 --> 05:47:17.636
And one more.

05:47:21.640 --> 05:47:24.542
No, Julie Tonkovich is still going to be there, I'm happy to say.

05:47:26.804 --> 05:47:32.890
Anyway, there were four, and I'll make sure for the record, I will make sure I add that, but that's the part that contributed to it.

05:47:32.970 --> 05:47:37.794
So we started with an emotion, the day opened emotionally and closed over lunch emotionally.

05:47:38.254 --> 05:47:42.258
One of the things, and we were also graced with the presence of Dr. Weber,

05:47:42.678 --> 05:47:45.780
who's an appointed member from the legislature at the IQC.

05:47:46.201 --> 05:48:00.070
It's wonderful to see the legislature supporting the work of the IQC and for the members who were there, they were gladdened in their hearts to see her there because they know she was there to support their deliberations continuing on the ethnic studies development.

05:48:00.430 --> 05:48:02.692
So it was a good day, it was a great meeting.

05:48:03.783 --> 05:48:04.964
There we go, Jennifer Woo.

05:48:05.444 --> 05:48:07.066
So Jennifer can kill me later.

05:48:07.506 --> 05:48:16.914
But it was a wonderful afternoon with the outgoing commissioners and we're looking forward to the next meeting that's going to be happening next week, as a matter of fact, the two-day meeting.

05:48:16.954 --> 05:48:17.894
So thank you very much.

05:48:18.175 --> 05:48:18.695
Thank you.

05:48:19.596 --> 05:48:27.282
Member Sandoval, we're going to finish this item and then go back because I see our lawyers have returned and come back to item 18.

05:48:29.478 --> 05:48:29.838
Thank you.

05:48:30.118 --> 05:48:32.319
I just want to follow up on frameworks.

05:48:32.419 --> 05:48:49.784
The arts framework completed its first public comment period, and now the framework draft will go to the Instructional Quality Commission next week, where the commission will recommend edits based on the public comment, and then it'll go out for a second public comment period.

05:48:50.564 --> 05:48:58.286
And just to emphasize that the framework embeds equity, access, and inclusion throughout, and is consistent with the other frameworks in that.

05:48:58.906 --> 05:49:07.291
And there is a wide variety of stakeholders, arts organizations, practitioners, educators, who've provided valuable input throughout the process.

05:49:07.331 --> 05:49:09.832
So thank you to our stakeholders for contributing to that.

05:49:10.712 --> 05:49:19.917
The California State Summer School for the Arts, the application for 2020, the summer session is open and it can be accessed via the website at

05:49:21.778 --> 05:49:28.124
csssa.california.gov and the application deadline is February 12th.

05:49:28.224 --> 05:49:42.397
So if you know of any students who are phenomenal in the arts and would benefit from this program and contribute to it as well, the deadline is February 12th and if you're entering high school you're eligible.

05:49:42.917 --> 05:49:44.899
Last year there were more than 1,400 applications.

05:49:48.742 --> 05:49:51.383
So I encourage you to help get the word out.

05:49:52.223 --> 05:49:58.645
And then finally, the Advisory Commission on Special Education meets next month, February 12th and 13th.

05:49:59.285 --> 05:50:14.151
And as an important element in the system-wide, the statewide system of support, the Special Education Division launched a System Improvement Leads webpage, and that's at systemimprovement.org, and the site offers a calendar of events

05:50:14.972 --> 05:50:20.260
State Performance Indicator Guide, and Improving Performance of Students with Disabilities Handbook.

05:50:20.320 --> 05:50:27.812
So those are some valuable resources for our teachers and administrators, and thank you, that's it.

05:50:32.128 --> 05:50:35.149
We're in the middle of experiencing my liaison assignments.

05:50:37.170 --> 05:50:38.691
And I'm anxious to complete them.

05:50:38.911 --> 05:50:42.153
Yes.

05:50:42.613 --> 05:50:47.175
The other one is on LCFF and we did that already with the LCAP template update.

05:50:49.913 --> 05:50:54.937
So, to the point member Strauss.

05:50:55.117 --> 05:51:01.041
So, just a couple of things as a member records that we both liaison to the instructional quality commission next Wednesday.

05:51:01.081 --> 05:51:05.185
We're swearing in the 4 new members and training them really a thoughtful.

05:51:05.225 --> 05:51:08.167
We really developed the staff has really developed a really thoughtful training.

05:51:08.707 --> 05:51:12.812
And you might remember when students come up, and they came up last fall, and they gave us our initiatives.

05:51:12.852 --> 05:51:16.897
Well, a year before, the students had recommended that we should have a student on Instructional Quality Commission.

05:51:17.257 --> 05:51:18.739
This is the first year we are appointing it.

05:51:18.799 --> 05:51:24.787
And while the student doesn't start until fall of senior year, which is in September, she'll be joining us for the training next week.

05:51:24.847 --> 05:51:26.649
So she's local, and so we're delighted.

05:51:26.969 --> 05:51:29.570
So that's happening on Wednesday and then a full meeting on Thursday.

05:51:30.571 --> 05:51:49.700
The core advisory meeting was quite interesting because they're talking, that was in early December, because they talked about their emerging approach of continuous improvement, which really helps to inform what the collaborative's doing, what we're doing, and honestly talked about the discussion, how to change systems, school districts, those of us who live that know that's complicated at best.

05:51:50.240 --> 05:52:00.064
And they're working on a breakthrough success community that's looking at freshmen on track, sort of how do you know kids are on track and do they need to keep up or do they need to catch up?

05:52:00.285 --> 05:52:08.508
And so do we know if they're ready for, are they vulnerable, are they high school grad ready, are they post-secondary promising, are they competitive at post-secondary?

05:52:08.528 --> 05:52:14.791
It's really interesting to think about this college and career readiness at a different and deeper level in some of the conversations.

05:52:14.831 --> 05:52:18.033
So I thought it really does help to inform our practice.

05:52:19.173 --> 05:52:26.556
We had a presentation about a school district's work on culture, building teacher planning time, which we've been talking about.

05:52:26.576 --> 05:52:32.098
Their use of data and really changing practice with an interaction.

05:52:32.558 --> 05:52:37.960
Just really thoughtful, real stories about the challenge of really taking our policy to practice.

05:52:38.000 --> 05:52:40.881
So just a really thoughtful meeting and just very, very helpful.

05:52:41.801 --> 05:52:43.242
And then coming up is,

05:52:44.642 --> 05:52:54.373
In 2 weeks is the math community practice so that's a collaboration around regions in the state of teachers and leaders who then go out to their county regions to do training.

05:52:54.393 --> 05:53:01.160
It's here in Sacramento and Dr Rochelle Gutierrez from Illinois is going to be talking about re, humanizing mathematics.

05:53:01.780 --> 05:53:06.203
And we'll get an update for the math success for all, and then all the regions do a presentation.

05:53:06.223 --> 05:53:11.366
And then early February, there'll be a science community of practice as well.

05:53:12.326 --> 05:53:23.713
And then I will be keynoting LA counties having a differentiated assistance process for districts and continuous improvement February 7th, and I will have the pleasure of.

05:53:24.814 --> 05:53:26.695
setting that off at the beginning.

05:53:26.795 --> 05:53:34.482
And then the last thing is the Credentialing Commission spent a lot of time, I'll try to do this really quickly, November 21st and 22nd, and we've been listening to literacy.

05:53:34.502 --> 05:53:45.731
We talked about literacy, literacy grant, helping teachers be literacy trained, and so they've been talking about the RECA and it being outdated as an assessment for teachers, but discussing what to replace it with.

05:53:45.751 --> 05:53:50.855
So a lot of debate about it, and some agreement about needing to update it and align it to our new standards,

05:53:51.115 --> 05:54:03.358
There's legislation involved, so it's not a particularly easy process, but lots of energy toward it, and the group is coming together around some recommendations, so I think we'll see some more about how do we help train our teachers with literacy.

05:54:03.378 --> 05:54:15.221
And then also a lot of, we've been talking a lot about special education, and a lot of talk about dyslexia guidelines, and how to help in teacher preparation, so all core teachers have training to work with struggling students with different challenges.

05:54:15.281 --> 05:54:19.842
So I just think that our credentialing commission continues to work on trying to update practice,

05:54:20.302 --> 05:54:21.082
keep it relevant.

05:54:21.162 --> 05:54:24.883
And those are the things that I'm just trying to highlight that are affected to what we're talking about.

05:54:25.743 --> 05:54:33.425
As President Darlene Hammond talked about, there's a lot of grants for recruiting classified staff to become teachers, and that's managed through there.

05:54:34.046 --> 05:54:38.007
Lots of ways to fill our shortage in math and science and in special ed.

05:54:38.047 --> 05:54:42.088
So, again, our Credential Commission is complementary to our work and really trying to help.

05:54:42.128 --> 05:54:42.828
We're lucky because

05:54:43.228 --> 05:54:47.293
Linda chaired it for eight years and really helped to inform it with a lot of her research and practice.

05:54:47.353 --> 05:54:49.236
So I just wanted to bring that up as well.

05:54:49.616 --> 05:54:50.477
That ends my report.

05:54:50.797 --> 05:54:51.138
Thank you.

05:54:53.413 --> 05:54:58.896
We had a very lengthy item at the end of the day yesterday on the Perkins federal application.

05:54:59.737 --> 05:55:01.618
So I'm not going to go into that.

05:55:02.478 --> 05:55:15.605
Just to say that the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee is meeting on the 31st of this month so that we can take another look at that application with the feedback from the public and with the feedback of this board.

05:55:16.306 --> 05:55:21.309
And we will be bringing you the application back for approval in March.

05:55:22.249 --> 05:55:36.182
The only other thing I want to mention is that I had the privilege of serving on a panel, an equity panel, at the JSPAC annual equity conference in early December.

05:55:36.202 --> 05:55:43.889
And I served along with Deputy Superintendent Kai Jackson and Maureen White of the California Community Colleges.

05:55:44.489 --> 05:55:59.577
And it was a panel that really discussed our work and the joint efforts of the three organizations, CDE, SBE, and the CCC, in developing our guiding principles for career and technical education pathways.

05:56:00.447 --> 05:56:05.669
and working together jointly in order to create quality pathways for students.

05:56:06.630 --> 05:56:08.650
And I think that's it.

05:56:08.951 --> 05:56:12.972
JSPAC also stands for the Special Populations Advisory Committee.

05:56:13.272 --> 05:56:14.893
Many people do not know about it.

05:56:15.733 --> 05:56:19.235
They're doing some really excellent work, so I want to give a shout out to them.

05:56:20.215 --> 05:56:25.757
JSPAC is supported and funded through the Perkins Federal Grant.

05:56:27.018 --> 05:56:27.238
Great.

05:56:28.208 --> 05:56:36.713
And I'll just close by saying I guess my major liaison appointment is with the governor's office and the governor's budget is going to be announced tomorrow.

05:56:37.513 --> 05:56:41.056
And I think you'll see a lot of the state board's concerns represented there.

05:56:41.916 --> 05:56:43.517
So stay tuned for that.

05:56:44.478 --> 05:56:49.080
And moving right along we're going to go right back to item number 18.

05:56:50.861 --> 05:56:51.882
And hopefully we have a

05:56:53.379 --> 05:56:58.400
clear proposal that we can consider and hopefully vote upon.

05:56:59.300 --> 05:57:01.241
Thank you, Judy, for putting it in writing.

05:57:15.904 --> 05:57:19.925
We tried to simplify it as much as we possibly could given the discussion.

05:57:22.446 --> 05:57:23.947
I think everyone should have a copy.

05:57:24.907 --> 05:57:33.051
So it's every year for the term of the charter, at least 50% of the kindergarten enrollment shall be FRPM eligible students.

05:57:34.611 --> 05:57:45.876
For every other grade, so that's one through eight, 100% of any open slots shall go to FRPM eligible students until the entire grade's enrollment is at least 50% FRPM eligible.

05:57:49.673 --> 05:57:56.382
So nothing different for sixth grade, but there'll be more open slots in the sixth grade, obviously, than there would be in, say, grade three or four.

05:57:56.422 --> 05:58:00.388
And that's very similar to what was being stated previously.

05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.869
Yeah.

05:58:01.109 --> 05:58:04.193
And you're simply extending that across the school.

05:58:04.494 --> 05:58:05.435
Yes, every grade.

05:58:07.557 --> 05:58:08.158
Member Rucker.

05:58:08.838 --> 05:58:09.419
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:58:09.559 --> 05:58:10.520
Somebody else also want to.

05:58:11.541 --> 05:58:12.382
I'll come back to you.

05:58:13.503 --> 05:58:17.808
OK, so is it possible for us to get back up on the slide?

05:58:17.868 --> 05:58:21.612
What are the four conditions that we were identifying for this?

05:58:21.632 --> 05:58:28.099
Because I want to make sure I know which conditions each of these statements are intended to replace.

05:58:37.805 --> 05:58:45.387
Okay, so the reason I'm asking for that is because I know that the action that's being contemplated has several pieces to it.

05:58:46.168 --> 05:58:55.291
And I want to make sure that we know what we're doing is amending what was originally recommended with these statements.

05:58:55.771 --> 05:59:05.534
And I want to make sure we're all clear and agreeing on what it is, which statements are being replaced by these two statements.

05:59:05.848 --> 05:59:07.889
Well, the 33% is being replaced.

05:59:07.969 --> 05:59:12.971
Yeah, I wanted to make sure, that's why I wanted to get that up on the screen, because I wanted to make sure, yes.

05:59:13.171 --> 05:59:32.918
We had a flash drive mix up and everyone put the wrong one in their bag.

05:59:42.324 --> 05:59:46.128
Yes, this is a much deeper curve and the school agreed to this and helped us write this.

05:59:46.628 --> 05:59:48.930
So they are confident that this will be workable for them.

05:59:51.292 --> 05:59:51.372
Yes.

06:00:06.326 --> 06:00:18.770
Okay, so the first statement, every year of the term of the charter, at least 50% of the kindergarten enrollment shall be FRPM eligible students.

06:00:19.190 --> 06:00:26.853
So for the statement that's in bold, we are replacing the requirement concerning kindergarten students with this statement.

06:00:27.628 --> 06:00:28.269
Is that correct?

06:00:28.349 --> 06:00:29.991
No, we're replacing that entire bullet.

06:00:30.151 --> 06:00:37.279
You're replacing the entire bullet, so we're not talking about the 33%, we're replacing the entire bullet with both of these statements?

06:00:38.280 --> 06:00:50.466
Okay, so then the third statement stays and the I mean the next statement on sibling stays and the next statement on children of an Employee stays and then the last statement stays.

06:00:50.986 --> 06:00:58.869
All right So we're adding two new bullets that will go at the top of this list So the changes to admission preferences will have five points.

06:00:59.230 --> 06:00:59.830
Is that correct?

06:01:01.711 --> 06:01:03.612
Six these are two and there's four remaining.

06:01:04.032 --> 06:01:05.472
Okay, we'll have six points.

06:01:05.753 --> 06:01:06.313
Is that correct?

06:01:07.259 --> 06:01:12.247
Okay, so that's the explicit change that we have made on admissions preferences.

06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:17.856
The other question I had asked was on the monitoring, what happens if this doesn't occur?

06:01:19.018 --> 06:01:20.720
Did you all come to an agreement on that?

06:01:24.139 --> 06:01:40.366
I think that it's all open slots, so it's going to occur, because if 100% of the open slots are going to FRPM, there's no percentages to meet where we argue whether, this is why we thought this was simpler, because we don't want to say, oh, you're at 32%, no, you're at 34%.

06:01:40.726 --> 06:01:46.489
This way, every open slot is going to FRPM until a certain point, until the entire class is 50% FRPM.

06:01:49.116 --> 06:02:01.241
Yes so it'll be self-enforcing so it'll be so again our the admissions preferences we have now we'll have six points on them with these two points that are on this page replacing that first bullet correct okay.

06:02:05.402 --> 06:02:12.965
Member Patil-Bronson, Member Paglana, Member Burr are in order is there anyone else who needs to be in the queue?

06:02:13.265 --> 06:02:13.685
Member Sun.

06:02:14.369 --> 06:02:19.113
I just wanted to register thanks again to Judy for our successive rounds of iteration.

06:02:19.133 --> 06:02:19.593
Team effort.

06:02:19.753 --> 06:02:20.574
Team effort, yes.

06:02:20.834 --> 06:02:32.282
To the petitioner for not only sort of taking what we suggested up here, but actually going quite a few steps further of making this be something that goes for every grade from one to eight.

06:02:32.382 --> 06:02:34.124
And we appreciate that commitment immensely.

06:02:34.484 --> 06:02:34.724
Thank you.

06:02:40.093 --> 06:02:43.835
I wholeheartedly support this recommendation, but I am so sorry.

06:02:43.855 --> 06:02:55.179
I just feel that there's, for admissions preferences, shouldn't we have as the first bullet students who are eligible for free and reduced lunch, and then these two are conditions of approval?

06:02:55.199 --> 06:03:02.021
Sure, we can make these sub-bullets under, yes, thank you, because it doesn't quite parallel.

06:03:02.261 --> 06:03:05.763
So that flows with the entry, the bullets are all read the same, yes.

06:03:06.383 --> 06:03:08.944
We will correct the grammar, yes, yes.

06:03:10.148 --> 06:03:10.628
Member Burr.

06:03:12.109 --> 06:03:15.271
So I'm ready for a motion.

06:03:15.471 --> 06:03:17.693
But I do just want to say a couple things.

06:03:18.073 --> 06:03:23.556
Just to respond specifically to Board Member Rucker, there is a subsequent slide to this.

06:03:27.939 --> 06:03:30.921
Right, I know, but you also ask about enforcement, right?

06:03:30.941 --> 06:03:37.084
So here, these other pieces would be part of the amendment, I mean, the motion.

06:03:37.724 --> 06:03:43.627
And also, just remember, I hate to say this because I don't hope we ever have to go there, but if they don't do it, we can revoke them.

06:03:44.047 --> 06:03:48.830
That's the ultimate accountability for charters, as we know, and we have revoked other charters.

06:03:49.490 --> 06:03:53.012
So, and I know that they're willing to hold themselves accountable to that.

06:03:53.072 --> 06:03:56.754
So, there is a hammer if it doesn't happen.

06:03:57.034 --> 06:04:07.278
And for the record, I didn't worry about going to this slide because I had already asked what would change in the community engagement plan if we make these recommendations for revision.

06:04:07.598 --> 06:04:15.981
And it was already stated before we tabled this motion that the community engagement plan would be revised to whatever these amendments would be.

06:04:16.021 --> 06:04:18.221
So that's why I didn't ask about those things.

06:04:18.381 --> 06:04:18.822
Terrific.

06:04:19.422 --> 06:04:20.882
So I'm just watching the clock.

06:04:20.922 --> 06:04:23.323
I know people have planes and trains and automobiles.

06:04:24.223 --> 06:04:25.684
We have someone ready to make a motion.

06:04:26.244 --> 06:04:33.472
So I moved the department recommendation as shown on the document that was distributed to all of us.

06:04:34.373 --> 06:04:45.545
So it includes the changes to the admission preferences plus the additional requirements around the community engagement plan, monthly updates on enrollment, and racial and ethnic balance reports.

06:04:47.186 --> 06:05:01.952
And I would just like to say one thing before we and that is first to express my appreciation to all of the folks who traveled here It's wonderful to see how committed people are to the school I also do want to say just a little piece of caution here.

06:05:02.553 --> 06:05:05.034
This may be your last chance to come to the state board

06:05:06.034 --> 06:05:07.896
because the charter law will change.

06:05:08.336 --> 06:05:25.988
So I wanna encourage everybody in this room that's affiliated with the school and who are here representing the school district to do whatever you can to find a path forward because the law is changing dramatically and the state board will not be the board of last resort.

06:05:28.150 --> 06:05:33.013
Well, it will in some way, but in a different way than it is now, yeah.

06:05:33.554 --> 06:05:35.195
We need a second for the motion.

06:05:36.647 --> 06:05:37.227
I will second.

06:05:37.667 --> 06:05:40.228
Member Sun, any further discussion?

06:05:41.368 --> 06:05:45.149
All in favor, please say aye and raise your hand so we can be sure we have a count.

06:05:45.949 --> 06:05:46.389
All right.

06:05:50.850 --> 06:05:51.931
We're not done voting.

06:05:51.951 --> 06:05:53.931
I do have to ask, are there any nays?

06:05:54.011 --> 06:05:55.772
I didn't see anybody who didn't raise their hand.

06:05:55.792 --> 06:05:56.832
Any abstentions?

06:05:56.952 --> 06:05:58.252
Okay, now you can clap.

06:05:58.272 --> 06:06:01.193
The motion carries.

06:06:06.185 --> 06:06:08.667
And we're going to do public comment.

06:06:09.488 --> 06:06:17.493
So we're going to move to item number 20, which is general public comment on any matter not included in the printed agenda.

06:06:19.695 --> 06:06:21.516
And safe trip home to all of you.

06:06:25.683 --> 06:06:27.084
We have any public comment?

06:06:27.144 --> 06:06:28.424
We do, we have three.

06:06:28.444 --> 06:06:32.026
Chris Miller, Trudy Moore, and Erin Apple.

06:06:32.506 --> 06:06:37.248
Okay, we'll let them come forward, but wait until we have quiet for them to speak.

06:07:13.349 --> 06:07:17.951
Do we have our first person for public comment available?

06:07:17.971 --> 06:07:24.993
Please state your name and affiliation for the record, please.

06:07:25.113 --> 06:07:27.914
And be sure that the microphones are near you and on.

06:07:27.934 --> 06:07:29.915
Okay, thank you.

06:07:29.935 --> 06:07:31.595
Okay.

06:07:34.456 --> 06:07:35.437
My name is Trudy Moore.

06:07:35.857 --> 06:07:37.797
I'm simply a Sacramento resident.

06:07:40.999 --> 06:07:42.179
Good afternoon board members.

06:07:43.099 --> 06:07:50.622
I wanted to call your attention to how the Sacramento City Unified School District handles California Public Records Act requests.

06:07:51.502 --> 06:07:59.867
In August 2019, my neighbors and many other community members asked me to find out about occurrences at the McClatchy High School track.

06:08:00.888 --> 06:08:08.132
I immediately asked SCUSD for information and was told to wait until October 2019.

06:08:09.173 --> 06:08:20.080
In October 2019, SCUSD's policy and government manager, Mr. Nathaniel Browning, insisted on meeting with me alone without anyone else from the community.

06:08:20.760 --> 06:08:27.502
He then refused to answer basic questions as if what happened in August was something top secret that he needed to hide from the public.

06:08:27.963 --> 06:08:34.005
And he instead demanded that I make written CPRA requests when the law does not require written requests.

06:08:34.545 --> 06:08:39.066
He denied receiving my first request, which I hand delivered to him in October.

06:08:40.447 --> 06:08:41.147
Did you call time?

06:08:43.768 --> 06:08:44.308
It is time.

06:08:44.508 --> 06:08:48.690
The remainder of my presentation is in the one pager I distributed.

06:08:48.750 --> 06:08:49.370
Thank you so much.

06:09:02.145 --> 06:09:02.846
Good afternoon.

06:09:03.506 --> 06:09:04.567
My name is Erin Apte.

06:09:04.707 --> 06:09:09.871
I'm the newest Legislative Counsel for Public Advocates, and I'm commenting today on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

06:09:10.591 --> 06:09:20.698
The coalition is concerned that several topics addressed in memoranda to the board are not on the board agenda for public discussion, which requires us to comment on them in this item without the benefit of board discussion.

06:09:21.419 --> 06:09:29.845
Specifically, we feel that the board's info memorandum on eligibility of LEAs to receive differentiated assistance in the system of support should be publicly discussed.

06:09:30.819 --> 06:09:54.287
Considering that our new accountability system under LCFF is about providing support for continuous improvement, it's concerning that neither the revised LCAP template nor the instructions require, encourage, or even suggest, including whether an LEA has been identified for differentiated assistance for specific student groups and indicators, which is something that all stakeholders should know about if they are to consider and be engaged in improvements.

06:09:55.185 --> 06:09:59.550
The information in the board's memo raises many important questions that we feel warrant further discussion.

06:10:00.151 --> 06:10:14.988
In alignment with the interest that was expressed yesterday, to better understand how LEAs are being supported to help their schools for comprehensive support and improvement under ESSA, we request that there also be an agenda item including these same inquiries for differentiated assistance.

06:10:15.628 --> 06:10:15.909
Thank you.

06:10:22.298 --> 06:10:25.700
Well, it's a little bit too hopeful because my head said good morning at the top, but.

06:10:28.322 --> 06:10:29.223
My name is Chris Miller.

06:10:29.243 --> 06:10:31.164
I'm a resident of Los Gatos in Silicon Valley.

06:10:31.304 --> 06:10:42.872
I'm currently serving as a work group member of the Student Mental Health Policy Work Group through the Department of Education, as well as a member of the Health Collaboration Committee to the Department of Education, although I'm not representing or speaking on behalf of those groups.

06:10:43.352 --> 06:10:45.314
I'm representing myself as an individual.

06:10:45.834 --> 06:10:53.139
I'd like to take the time to thank the State Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for your support of mental health education advocacy efforts.

06:10:53.699 --> 06:11:01.184
I'm thankful that Superintendent Thurmond has made mental health and social emotional wellness a key component of the recommendations of the transition team.

06:11:02.025 --> 06:11:12.572
As a former school board member, albeit the local level, although today after today's discussion part of me misses the school governance, but I know how important it is for board members and leadership to be accessible to constituents.

06:11:13.272 --> 06:11:23.514
To that end, I'm especially grateful for Dr. Darling-Hammond and Dr. Ortiz-Lucan, who had to step out, but for their willingness to connect over the phone in recent months to discuss mental health efforts.

06:11:23.554 --> 06:11:24.474
So thank you very much.

06:11:25.035 --> 06:11:27.255
I also enjoyed meeting with previous superintendent... Time.

06:11:27.575 --> 06:11:28.155
...Dorkelson back in 2016.

06:11:28.215 --> 06:11:32.596
Welcome to the opportunity to connect with Superintendent Thurmond in the coming weeks.

06:11:33.796 --> 06:11:34.517
Thank you very much.
