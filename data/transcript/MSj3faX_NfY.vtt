00:57.400 --> 01:00.400

01:00.400 --> 01:03.400
I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.400
Vice President Strauss, you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.400
Would you all please rise?

01:09.400 --> 01:12.400
Right hand over your heart.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
Ready.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
Begin.

01:15.400 --> 01:22.400
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for

01:22.400 --> 01:30.400
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:30.400 --> 01:32.400
You may be seated.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.400
Thank you.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.400
Thank you very much.

01:37.400 --> 01:44.400
And I'd like to begin this morning by swearing in our three wonderful new state board members.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.400
And then after that, I will actually more properly introduce them.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.400

Congratulations and welcome to the state board.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.400
Thank you.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.920
And now let me give a little bit of an introduction

06:08.920 --> 06:11.960
and opportunity for each of these new board members

06:11.960 --> 06:13.920
to say a few words to us.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.280
Each of these folks was appointed

06:17.280 --> 06:20.040
by Governor Newsom earlier this week.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.240
Cynthia Glover Woods is the chief academic officer

06:23.240 --> 06:26.000
at the Riverside County Office of Education.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.840

06:28.840 --> 06:30.960
the coordinator of professional development,

06:30.960 --> 06:32.760
a curriculum specialist,

06:32.760 --> 06:36.440
and an assistant superintendent in Compton and Alford

06:36.440 --> 06:39.960
before adjoining the Riverside County Office of Education.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.400
She currently chairs

06:41.400 --> 06:45.160
the Curriculum and Instruction Committee of SESSA

06:45.160 --> 06:48.000
and as a member of CASA and ACSA

06:48.000 --> 06:51.480
and a very active participant in education in our state.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.000
Cynthia, welcome.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.040
And I'd love to invite you

06:54.040 --> 06:56.720
to offer a couple of comments to yourself.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.840
Thank you so much, Governor Brown-Hammond.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.760
And again, good morning to everyone.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.480
I will be very brief, but I just want for all to know,

07:05.480 --> 07:08.320
I am humbled and honored to have an opportunity

07:08.320 --> 07:10.960
to serve the students, families, and educators

07:10.960 --> 07:13.080
in the state of California.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.840
It is an awesome opportunity to be able to work

07:15.840 --> 07:19.280
with all of the State Board of Education board members

07:19.280 --> 07:23.160
as we shape education and support our students

07:23.160 --> 07:24.520
to be the best that they can be.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.160
So thank you so much for this opportunity.

07:27.160 --> 07:30.040
We're delighted to have you with us.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.320
And Jim McQuillen is the education director

07:32.320 --> 07:34.280
for the Yurok Tribe.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.960
He has degrees in a master's degree in psychology.

07:37.960 --> 07:39.960
He's a people personnel credential.

07:39.960 --> 07:43.600
He's been very involved in supporting programs

07:43.600 --> 07:45.920
from pre-K all the way through high school

07:45.920 --> 07:48.560
and even support for college students

07:48.560 --> 07:53.560
across the whole education continuum.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.240
He's also been American Indian education administrator

07:57.240 --> 08:00.360
and consultant for the Del Norte Unified School District

08:00.360 --> 08:04.520
and has had a variety of roles in our education system.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.200
So Jim, would you like to say a few words and welcome?

08:08.160 --> 08:11.440
I would say Skuyanukoi and Ayakwe

08:11.440 --> 08:14.960
in the Yurok language that's greetings and good morning.

08:14.960 --> 08:19.960
So I'm very pleased to be in this position

08:20.160 --> 08:22.960
for the state of California in supporting

08:22.960 --> 08:25.680
and being here for all of our students.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.000
We're in very unusual times right now.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.520
And I really think that we need to be very creative

08:31.520 --> 08:33.680
in keeping our students connected

08:33.680 --> 08:37.360
and helping them social emotionally, stay connected.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.640
I'm just so pleased to be here and honored

08:39.640 --> 08:42.480
to work with all of you and be here

08:42.480 --> 08:44.720
for the state of California and our students.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.680
So thank you.

08:46.680 --> 08:48.560
Welcome, welcome.

08:48.560 --> 08:53.040
And Iday Rodriguez, Iday is currently a teacher

08:53.040 --> 08:54.680
at Central Union High School.

08:54.680 --> 08:57.040
She is a national board certified teacher,

08:57.080 --> 08:59.360
which is a very high accomplishment

08:59.360 --> 09:00.480
in the teaching profession

09:00.480 --> 09:04.600
and has served on the board of the national board itself.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.440
She comes to us from the California

09:07.440 --> 09:09.440
Teacher Credentialing Commission.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.320
She is additionally the director

09:12.320 --> 09:15.760
for the AVID program in her school.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.880
And Iday, we're just thrilled to have you.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.520
Would you like to say a few words?

09:20.920 --> 09:22.440
Thank you so much.

09:22.440 --> 09:25.840
And also, you know, I'd like to echo

09:25.840 --> 09:27.920
what Jim and Cynthia just said.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.320
I'm humbled and this is a great honor.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.320
As I was reading the agenda and preparing for the meeting,

09:36.960 --> 09:40.520
I found it a harbinger of, you know, good fortune

09:40.520 --> 09:44.200
that we're looking at the framework for theater

09:44.200 --> 09:48.240
and world language because I've taught both theater

09:48.240 --> 09:49.960
and world language.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.720
And so, you know, I was looking at that through that frame.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.520
I'm excited to be a classroom teacher

09:56.520 --> 09:59.640
and to be able to serve as a bridge,

09:59.640 --> 10:01.160
you know, with my colleagues

10:01.160 --> 10:03.680
and what's happening on the ground

10:03.680 --> 10:06.320
and the decisions that we make here.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.000
So I'm very honored and humbled to be here.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.600
Thank you.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.320
Great to have you.

10:12.320 --> 10:16.160
I'd also like to announce in a bittersweet announcement

10:16.160 --> 10:18.920
that this is our student board member,

10:18.920 --> 10:23.200
Brenna Pangolinan's last meeting with us.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.000
But the good news is she's been accepted

10:25.000 --> 10:27.720
to Brown University to pursue a degree

10:27.720 --> 10:30.400
in behavioral decision science.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.680
I'm not sure what that is,

10:31.680 --> 10:33.880
but I think we probably need it in the state board.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.760
So after you figure out how to help us make decisions,

10:36.760 --> 10:38.800
you can come back and teach us that.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.040
So please join me in thanking Brenna for her service.

10:42.040 --> 10:45.560
And Brenna, please feel free to say a few words.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.720
Thank you so much.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.840
I first just wanted to say thank you

10:50.840 --> 10:53.800
to the board for this opportunity.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.600
You have all been so supportive

10:55.600 --> 10:58.760
and welcoming to me throughout this year.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.720
You have all motivated me to do better.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.600
You are also accomplished in your respective fields

11:04.600 --> 11:08.800
and everyone here has truly chosen to make a difference.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.120
And your passion and your leadership has inspired me.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.560
And I am so grateful to have witnessed that passion

11:15.560 --> 11:18.760
because I can enter this next chapter in my life,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.040
knowing what's possible with the right values.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.560
So I thank you all for that.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.160
I also wanna say thank you to the staff

11:26.160 --> 11:28.800
who was always willing to help me.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.120
It is definitely intimidating as a student

11:31.120 --> 11:32.320
to enter this position.

11:32.320 --> 11:36.000
And if you don't learn fast enough, you fall behind.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.920
So what has made that easier is everyone here willing

11:38.920 --> 11:43.080
to be patient and tell me what I wouldn't have known before

11:43.080 --> 11:45.120
so I could really learn and grow.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.320
And I could not have gotten throughout this year

11:47.320 --> 11:48.800
without your guidance and support.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.240
So thank you so much.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.360
I wanted to share one thing.

11:52.360 --> 11:55.280
It was kind of one of my favorite memories

11:55.280 --> 11:57.720
that I believe summarizes the mindset of this board

11:57.720 --> 11:58.840
that I really appreciated.

11:58.840 --> 12:02.160
And it was really small, but something that board member

12:02.160 --> 12:06.040
or Feasley Cohen said during a discussion.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.320
And she apologized for being impatient.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.160
It was very simple

12:10.160 --> 12:12.600
that she apologized for being impatient.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.640
And of course, everything that happens here takes time.

12:16.640 --> 12:19.840
And it's a process because it affects so many people.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.120
However, I think being impatient is a beautiful thing

12:23.120 --> 12:27.480
when it comes to improving people's lives and education.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.040
And I think that's a common mindset

12:29.040 --> 12:31.640
amongst all the board members here.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.920
In so many discussions, this board pushes forward

12:34.920 --> 12:36.520
to not settle for the status quo.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.360
So I really appreciate that.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.000
And impatience is necessary to make change.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.280
And I've learned that from this board.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.160
So I thank you so much.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.400
Like President Linda Dollingham said,

12:47.400 --> 12:49.320
I'll be attending Brown University.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.520
And I'm grateful to take all the lessons

12:51.520 --> 12:53.440
that I've learned into this next chapter.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.920
So I'm very motivated after this year.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.680
And I thank you all for helping me and supporting me.

12:58.680 --> 13:00.400
And I'm just so grateful for the opportunity.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.280
So thank you so much.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.240
It's been great to have you.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.960
Does anyone want to add any comments to Brenna

13:05.960 --> 13:10.160
as she takes this next step in her journey?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.920
Wait, go ahead.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.520
No, I just wanted, this is Board Member Navo.

13:15.520 --> 13:20.520
Brenna, I just want to tell you, I greatly appreciate you.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.200
You have taught me a lot about how far behind I was

13:24.200 --> 13:25.480
as a high school student.

13:25.480 --> 13:30.480
And you've taught me a lot about student perspective,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.240
which I really appreciate.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.560
And I think sometimes it's easy to forget.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.160
We spend a lot of time planning and thinking

13:38.320 --> 13:41.600
We spend a lot of time planning and having conversations

13:41.600 --> 13:42.880
about what's best for students.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.680
We oftentimes forget their voice matters.

13:45.680 --> 13:49.400
And you have brought that to bear here.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.560
And I appreciate it very much.

13:50.560 --> 13:51.400
You'll be missed.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.600
I think we all share in those sentiments

13:54.600 --> 13:56.840
and we wish you all the very, very best.

13:56.840 --> 14:00.520
And please come back and teach us behavioral decision science

14:00.520 --> 14:02.280
when you've learned it.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.200
Linda, Patricia Rucker has her hand up too to make comment.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.560
Oh, great, thank you.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.200
Good morning, Brenna.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.120
We spent a lot of time as neighbors

14:12.120 --> 14:14.560
during the board meetings when we were physically meeting.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.200
And it was always a pleasure to sit and talk with you.

14:17.200 --> 14:21.720
But also it was always for me with great admiration

14:21.720 --> 14:24.840
and all that I listened to your comments, your questions

14:24.840 --> 14:27.080
and the concerns that you raised.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.600
It's amazing to me to think about the fact

14:29.600 --> 14:31.760
that you're going to be leaving and going off

14:31.760 --> 14:34.000
and representing all of us here

14:34.000 --> 14:36.480
when you go to Brown and go back East

14:36.520 --> 14:39.240
and you'll bring that West Coast perspective

14:39.240 --> 14:40.600
to the East Coast.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.960
But more importantly, this is an exciting time

14:43.960 --> 14:48.600
not only to be from California, but to be in California

14:48.600 --> 14:52.360
and be involved in the decisions and the policies

14:52.360 --> 14:54.640
that you had a hand in making.

14:54.640 --> 14:57.720
So even though it was only for a very short time,

14:57.720 --> 15:01.480
I really wanna make sure that everyone who knows you

15:01.480 --> 15:04.760
and everyone we send you forth out into the world to me

15:04.800 --> 15:09.040
recognizes and understands not only the power of your voice

15:09.040 --> 15:12.160
but the influence that you were able to wield

15:12.160 --> 15:15.720
and the role model that you served for the students

15:15.720 --> 15:17.320
from the various student councils

15:17.320 --> 15:20.160
and student leadership positions across the state

15:20.160 --> 15:22.160
that you had a chance to work with.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.920
Because believe it or not, as people came in contact

15:24.920 --> 15:27.440
with you, particularly those students,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.240
they were aware of just how important

15:29.240 --> 15:30.840
the work you were doing.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.520
And they also wanted to follow in your footsteps.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.880
With great awe and respect and admiration

15:37.880 --> 15:40.080
that I congratulate you and take care

15:40.080 --> 15:41.400
and have a wonderful life.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.800
That's great.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.600
And I wanna commend member Rucker

15:46.600 --> 15:49.760
for using the raise your hand function

15:49.760 --> 15:52.720
which shows up in our little participant box.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.440
You can do that or you can raise your hand physically.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.080
I'm seeing you and trying to watch that box

15:59.080 --> 16:02.040
to recognize folks and Karen will be at my backup

16:02.040 --> 16:04.120
as we saw.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.960
Linda, Tony and Ting would like to say something.

16:08.960 --> 16:09.800
Okay, great.

16:10.880 --> 16:13.720
Madam President, I'll wait until after the board members

16:13.720 --> 16:15.360
have spoken, but thank you.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.600
Okay, Ting.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.480
Hi.

16:17.480 --> 16:21.720
Yes, so Brenna, I just wanted to add my congratulations

16:21.720 --> 16:26.000
to you and wish you a great journey in your college career.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
I so admire you.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.480
I really have, you have a fan for life.

16:30.520 --> 16:34.840
And this was kind of brought to home for me

16:34.840 --> 16:39.160
when I heard you on an Ed source interview.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.880
And I was so blown away.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.240
I've been blown away by your maturity,

16:45.240 --> 16:47.720
how smart you are and your articulation.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.320
And in that interview, I was literally listening to it

16:51.320 --> 16:55.280
and dancing up and down and so proud of you

16:55.280 --> 16:57.080
and the work that you've done on this board.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.680
So I wish you the best of luck.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.160
I'm so glad to have known you

17:01.160 --> 17:03.040
and have worked with you this last year.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.720
And I hope to follow you as you go to college in your career.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.120
Okay, Tony.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.720
No, we have Eileen and then Tony, Linda.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.680
Okay, thank you.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.480
I'm trying to figure out how to manage the chat,

17:18.480 --> 17:21.320
the participants and the Hollywood squares.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.120
And I haven't mastered it yet.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.200
I think it's great when you have Karen backing you up.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.920
It's really helpful. Yes.

17:27.960 --> 17:30.280
So Bren, I just wanted to say,

17:30.280 --> 17:32.760
I just so appreciate you came onto the board

17:32.760 --> 17:34.720
as such an experienced board member

17:34.720 --> 17:36.720
with your experience in your local school district,

17:36.720 --> 17:38.960
which really right from the beginning,

17:38.960 --> 17:40.760
you contributed, you had comments,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.400
you had thoughts and perspectives.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.520
And I so appreciate you working to try to make sure

17:46.520 --> 17:49.240
we have student board members in our local districts.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.680
I know that's a mission of yours and that they be trained

17:52.680 --> 17:55.360
and have an important voice in their local work

17:55.360 --> 17:57.040
as well as at the state level.

17:57.040 --> 18:00.720
And so I just think from your work across the state

18:00.720 --> 18:02.440
and in your local district,

18:02.440 --> 18:05.480
you've set an expectation that we really appreciate.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.520
We've also loved spending time with you personally.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.960
It's been really fun.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.600
She just joins us all just as one of the team

18:11.600 --> 18:13.840
and we will follow you.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.600
You should know student board members go on

18:15.600 --> 18:18.000
to do great things and circle back.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.240
So this is not, we all have each other's emails

18:21.240 --> 18:23.680
and we do hope that we'll stay in touch with you,

18:23.680 --> 18:25.480
but you've made a really big difference in the year

18:25.480 --> 18:27.840
that you served while you've been a senior.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.000
And now you get to go to your next chapter

18:30.000 --> 18:31.120
and we'll be following you.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.600
So thank you, Brenna, for just your energy

18:33.600 --> 18:35.680
and your thoughtfulness and always being present

18:35.680 --> 18:36.520
in our work.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.200
And Tony, I think you're up.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.360
Thank you, Madam President and members of the board.

18:43.360 --> 18:48.120
Board member Pangolini, I wanted to add my thanks to you

18:48.120 --> 18:49.600
in addition to the board members.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.160
And congratulations as you pursue

18:52.160 --> 18:54.680
what sounds like a very exciting major,

18:54.720 --> 18:57.000
like our board president, not sure quite what it is,

18:57.000 --> 18:59.280
but it does sound like something that can be helpful

18:59.280 --> 19:01.880
to all of us in California and maybe nationwide,

19:01.880 --> 19:05.120
depending on where you decide to land and settle.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.000
It's hard to believe that it's already time

19:07.000 --> 19:08.880
to say, see you later.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.320
I believe in see you later because as you've heard,

19:12.320 --> 19:13.560
we know that you're gonna do great things

19:13.560 --> 19:15.200
and we hope that you'll stay connected.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.840
And we hope that you will allow us to help you

19:16.840 --> 19:18.800
if we can along the way.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.160
It seems like you just jumped right in

19:21.160 --> 19:22.640
that you didn't really need any time,

19:22.640 --> 19:24.520
that you felt really comfortable

19:24.520 --> 19:28.160
really holding your place as a board member, as you should.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.280
But these are often difficult conversations

19:31.280 --> 19:32.880
to enter for anyone.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.960
And you showed that you were courageous

19:34.960 --> 19:38.600
and a great educator and ready for whatever comes forward.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.400
I also would like to offer a personal word

19:41.400 --> 19:43.280
of thanks and gratitude and to share something

19:43.280 --> 19:44.960
that board members may not know,

19:44.960 --> 19:48.600
that board member Pangolini has helped us to launch

19:48.640 --> 19:53.320
what is a very new and fledgling youth advisory council

19:53.320 --> 19:55.560
at the California Department of Education.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.000
They give us a chance to bring youth voice

19:58.000 --> 20:01.360
into all matters related to education.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.320
This has really grown out of our interest

20:03.320 --> 20:06.400
in providing support to students during the pandemic.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.800
And board member Pangolini was more than generous

20:08.800 --> 20:12.080
in her time in helping to be a part of it and shape it,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.720
but she really has been a leader

20:13.720 --> 20:16.280
and has given us a way to really think differently

20:16.280 --> 20:18.280
about how we partner with young people

20:18.280 --> 20:19.920
in supporting their education.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.480
Hope that you'll continue when your schedule allows,

20:22.480 --> 20:23.920
but know that we are grateful.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.720
And as I said, that I and staff and the board are all here

20:27.720 --> 20:29.680
if we can support you on your journey.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.320
Good luck at Brown and thank you.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.200
Perfect.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.640
And finally, in the area of announcements,

20:37.640 --> 20:40.560
I'd like to announce the departure of Malia Gonzalez,

20:40.560 --> 20:43.640
who started at the state board office in August, 2016.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.640
She's accepted a new opportunity to work at CDE

20:47.640 --> 20:50.560
as a school fiscal services division,

20:50.560 --> 20:54.120
associate governmental program analyst in June, 2020.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.240
And we want to thank Malia

20:55.240 --> 20:58.480
for all of her invaluable assistance during her core years

20:58.480 --> 20:59.400
at the state board.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.640
And she is right down the hall when we get back

21:01.640 --> 21:06.320
to being together at the department's offices.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.560
Our agenda is very full today for this meeting

21:10.560 --> 21:13.880
and I'll try hard to help us finish today's work

21:13.880 --> 21:18.880
by dinnertime, but we will have to be very focused

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
to do that.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.280
We'll reopen item one, SBE priorities,

21:23.280 --> 21:25.640
to take action on the draft minutes

21:25.640 --> 21:29.200
and receive the state board liaison reports

21:29.200 --> 21:30.840
tomorrow morning.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.320
Item seven was withdrawn from our agenda

21:33.320 --> 21:34.640
by the state board yesterday,

21:34.640 --> 21:36.480
which would have considered the approval

21:36.480 --> 21:39.520
of local educational agency plans

21:39.520 --> 21:42.600
as required through the Every Student Succeeds Act

21:42.600 --> 21:45.640
through the completion of the LCAP federal addendum.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.320
Item 12, Cabrillo Point Academy charter number 1748

21:50.320 --> 21:53.640
was withdrawn by CDE on June 28th,

21:53.640 --> 21:55.960
as noted in attachment one.

21:55.960 --> 21:59.080
There will be no closed session on Thursday.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.360
Item 23 has been added to the agenda

22:01.360 --> 22:03.280
at the end of the day on Thursday,

22:03.280 --> 22:04.520
which is a waiver request

22:04.520 --> 22:07.160
by Fallbrook Union Elementary School District.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.040
There are seven public hearings on our agenda,

22:11.040 --> 22:14.040
including items three, four, 16, and 17,

22:14.040 --> 22:15.880
which will be heard today,

22:15.880 --> 22:18.840
and items 18, 19, 20, and 21,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.120
which will be heard tomorrow.

22:21.120 --> 22:26.120
The proposed waiver consent items are W01 through 15.

22:26.560 --> 22:31.560
The proposed regular consent items are items eight through 15.

22:32.320 --> 22:34.360
We will take up both the waiver consent items

22:34.360 --> 22:38.080
and regular consent items later this afternoon.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.880
In terms of public input,

22:39.880 --> 22:41.840
members of the public wishing to call in

22:41.840 --> 22:42.920
through a public comment

22:42.920 --> 22:45.400
should view the live stream of the meeting

22:45.400 --> 22:49.200
to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.880
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number,

22:52.880 --> 22:55.080
entering a participant access code,

22:55.080 --> 22:58.600
and then following each of the operator's prompts.

22:58.600 --> 23:02.240
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.000
The operator will notify callers

23:04.640 --> 23:07.200
when it is their turn to provide public comment.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.520
We will also ask callers to please turn down

23:09.520 --> 23:12.520
the speaker volume of their computers

23:12.520 --> 23:14.640
if they are following the live webcast

23:14.640 --> 23:17.760
in order to avoid an echoing effect.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.240
Public comment will be limited to one minute

23:20.240 --> 23:22.160
for each speaker.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.560
Item 18 is the general public comment item

23:24.560 --> 23:26.960
during which members of the public may provide comment

23:26.960 --> 23:29.400
on matters that are not specifically listed

23:29.400 --> 23:31.600
on the board's agenda.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.640
Board members, please mute your microphones

23:34.280 --> 23:35.120
when you're not speaking

23:35.120 --> 23:38.160
and keep your cameras on at all times,

23:38.160 --> 23:40.040
except during the schedule breaks

23:40.040 --> 23:41.880
to ensure that we maintain a quorum

23:41.880 --> 23:44.400
throughout today's virtual meeting.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.840
For each item on the agenda,

23:45.840 --> 23:48.240
there will be an opportunity for you board members

23:48.240 --> 23:51.520
to raise your hand using the Zoom participant window

23:51.520 --> 23:53.800
if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment,

23:53.800 --> 23:58.520
and we'll also watch for you in the Hollywood squares.

23:59.520 --> 24:04.440
Agenda item one is our state board priorities item,

24:04.440 --> 24:05.880
and we are opening item one

24:05.880 --> 24:08.360
to hear the superintendent's report

24:08.360 --> 24:11.600
and the state board president's report at this time only,

24:11.600 --> 24:14.400
and then we will reopen the item tomorrow morning

24:14.400 --> 24:16.200
for any of the remaining items.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.080
So I now turn it over to state superintendent Tony Thurman

24:19.080 --> 24:20.360
to provide his report.

24:22.680 --> 24:24.920
I thank you, Madam President and board members.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.720
I'd like to first start by acknowledging

24:27.880 --> 24:29.560
and congratulating and welcoming

24:30.520 --> 24:33.680
board members McQuillin, Dr. Glover-Woods,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.960
and board member Rodriguez.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.480
You are all very distinguished,

24:37.480 --> 24:39.240
and you're joining a very distinguished board.

24:39.240 --> 24:43.000
It is an honor for me and the 2,500 employees

24:43.000 --> 24:46.280
at the California Department of Education to work with you.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.480
There are a number of new staff

24:47.480 --> 24:49.640
who I would like to announce and share with you,

24:49.640 --> 24:52.760
but first I'd like to just give just a few highlights

24:52.760 --> 24:56.720
of some of the things that have happened since we last met.

24:56.720 --> 25:00.400
It feels like it was very long ago.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.800
It was only in the month of May,

25:02.800 --> 25:06.160
as we are living in some of the most challenging times.

25:06.160 --> 25:09.120
Every day feels like the longest day,

25:09.120 --> 25:11.360
but I'm grateful to see each and every one of you

25:11.360 --> 25:13.280
and that we are able to convene again

25:13.280 --> 25:15.160
as you continue to take up the business

25:15.160 --> 25:17.600
of the people of the state of California.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.280
As you probably know, our office in conjunction

25:20.280 --> 25:21.560
with the State Board of Education

25:21.560 --> 25:24.560
and many other partners and with the support

25:24.560 --> 25:26.600
of our president who joined us

25:27.480 --> 25:28.840
when we released it, we did release guidance

25:28.840 --> 25:31.080
or how schools can reopen safely.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.400
That guidance was released in June.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.960
It probably mirrors many of the things

25:35.960 --> 25:39.000
that you have heard stated by organizations

25:39.000 --> 25:41.560
like the Center for Disease Control

25:41.560 --> 25:44.240
and the Department of Public Health in California,

25:44.240 --> 25:46.720
that in order for schools to open safely,

25:46.720 --> 25:50.200
students will need to wear face coverings, as will staff,

25:50.200 --> 25:52.880
and that there will need to be personal protective equipment

25:52.880 --> 25:54.520
provided to all of our students.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.800
We're grateful to all of our partnerships,

25:56.800 --> 25:59.240
but including our partnership in the governor's office

25:59.240 --> 26:01.200
and the Office of Emergency Services

26:01.200 --> 26:04.640
that has already allowed for personal protective equipment

26:04.640 --> 26:07.880
to be sent to 10,000 schools in our state.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.760
In many cases, this has already arrived.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.120
And so we know that there's so many questions

26:13.120 --> 26:17.280
about how school will look and how it can safely reopen.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.880
There are questions about, will there be distance learning?

26:19.880 --> 26:22.200
There are questions about instructional minutes

26:22.200 --> 26:25.440
and the number of days and how to support districts

26:25.440 --> 26:27.040
as we keep students safe.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.160
But I'm grateful to Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond

26:29.160 --> 26:31.400
and to many partners who've worked with our staff

26:31.400 --> 26:33.120
at the Department of Education,

26:33.120 --> 26:34.640
our chief deputy superintendent

26:34.640 --> 26:37.480
who led the process of writing the document

26:37.480 --> 26:39.680
and all of the stakeholders who joined us,

26:39.680 --> 26:43.600
educators from every perspective and background,

26:43.600 --> 26:47.000
teachers and administrators, classified staff, parents,

26:47.000 --> 26:50.120
many all coming together to work through the scenarios

26:50.120 --> 26:53.440
about what school reopening would need to look like.

26:53.440 --> 26:56.080
Many of you know that we launched during the pandemic

26:56.080 --> 26:58.600
a task force on closing the digital divide.

26:58.600 --> 27:01.880
This was our way of helping to provide computing devices

27:01.880 --> 27:03.840
and hotspots to students in need

27:03.840 --> 27:06.200
and to advocate for closing the digital divide.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.760
Thank you, Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond

27:07.760 --> 27:11.800
and many others who joined us in making calls

27:11.800 --> 27:13.760
for donations for our students.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.280
Internet service providers have essentially agreed

27:16.280 --> 27:18.600
to provide free internet for many of our students

27:18.600 --> 27:20.520
and in many cases, low cost internet,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.160
but there's still many, many challenges

27:22.160 --> 27:23.640
that need to be addressed.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.080
There are infrastructure barriers

27:25.080 --> 27:27.400
that prevent our students from having access

27:27.400 --> 27:28.560
to high speed internet

27:28.560 --> 27:31.360
and many students don't have a computing device in the home.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.720
We are continuing to work through our task force

27:33.720 --> 27:37.680
on the ways that we can address the digital divide.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.440
I want to let you know about a number of webinars

27:42.440 --> 27:43.400
that have been provided.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.480
The number is upwards of 40

27:45.480 --> 27:47.480
that were provided during the pandemic

27:47.480 --> 27:49.560
to go through various aspects

27:49.560 --> 27:51.760
of how to provide distance learning,

27:51.760 --> 27:56.040
how to support students with special needs and disabilities

27:56.040 --> 27:58.400
and any topic that you can imagine.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.920
We had virtual support circles for parents

28:00.920 --> 28:02.720
to talk about how difficult it was

28:02.720 --> 28:04.960
to be supporting their students while at home.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.400
We had virtual support circles for educators

28:07.400 --> 28:08.800
and for students.

28:08.800 --> 28:11.280
We've also developed a counseling coalition

28:11.280 --> 28:12.720
to help us fill in gaps

28:12.720 --> 28:15.200
because we know that many of our students haven't checked in.

28:15.200 --> 28:17.120
They may be struggling to find basic needs.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.720
We know that meals were provided

28:18.720 --> 28:21.440
at more than 5,000 sites across our state.

28:21.440 --> 28:22.960
And so these are some of the things

28:22.960 --> 28:25.720
that the Department of Education has put in place

28:25.720 --> 28:29.640
to address many of the challenges that we are seeing.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.600
As you know, since we last met,

28:31.600 --> 28:34.960
we have witnessed one of the most devastating acts

28:34.960 --> 28:39.160
of police brutality, the killing of an unarmed black man

28:39.160 --> 28:41.920
that really exacerbates our feelings

28:41.920 --> 28:44.520
about the loss of life for African-Americans

28:44.520 --> 28:46.480
and for others who've been impacted

28:46.480 --> 28:48.800
and impacted by violence.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.200
And we've grieved together,

28:51.200 --> 28:53.560
we've held many conversations together

28:53.560 --> 28:55.400
about the work that we must do.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.120
One of the things that we've taken up recently,

28:57.120 --> 28:59.080
and I'm grateful to our State Board President

28:59.080 --> 29:01.640
for joining us, is convene a conversation

29:01.640 --> 29:05.120
about the impact of police in our schools.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.600
As we join the conversations

29:06.600 --> 29:08.560
that are taking place nationwide,

29:08.560 --> 29:10.760
we wanted to make sure that we were also talking

29:10.760 --> 29:14.120
about issues of safety in our schools.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.240
And we've had a robust discussion

29:17.000 --> 29:19.360
about alternatives to having police on campus,

29:19.360 --> 29:20.720
and there are a number of recommendations

29:20.720 --> 29:23.400
being explored right now, like more restorative justice,

29:23.400 --> 29:25.160
more de-escalation programs,

29:25.160 --> 29:27.520
and more counseling programs to support our students.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.120
There'll be another hearing on this Friday at 10 a.m.

29:30.120 --> 29:32.000
to speak to those matters.

29:32.000 --> 29:32.960
I also wanna let you know

29:32.960 --> 29:34.960
that the California Department of Education

29:34.960 --> 29:38.000
has introduced a new initiative

29:38.000 --> 29:40.560
to help bring implicit bias training

29:40.560 --> 29:42.680
to our 10,000 schools in the state.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.160
We're grateful to have received the grant

29:44.160 --> 29:46.120
from the Bechdel Junior Foundation

29:46.960 --> 29:48.280
that allows us to begin this conversation

29:48.280 --> 29:51.920
to build out a framework for how to provide implicit bias

29:51.920 --> 29:54.080
and to help us start with our own organization

29:54.080 --> 29:55.880
with the 2,500 employees

29:55.880 --> 29:57.800
at the California Department of Education

29:57.800 --> 30:00.160
while we build out this campaign.

30:00.160 --> 30:01.480
I wanna let you know about some of the staff

30:01.480 --> 30:04.440
will be very important to the work that we'll do

30:04.440 --> 30:06.560
in addressing implicit bias.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.360
I'm excited to let you know

30:08.360 --> 30:10.920
that we've been joined by a new Deputy Superintendent

30:10.920 --> 30:14.080
for our Instruction and Measurement Branch.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.600
Her name is Rachel Maves,

30:15.600 --> 30:18.040
and she joins us after serving

30:18.040 --> 30:22.080
at the County Office of Education in Sonoma County.

30:22.080 --> 30:25.160
She's been an educator and a superintendent

30:25.160 --> 30:27.200
and a top leader at the County Office of Education,

30:27.200 --> 30:28.800
and we're glad to have her.

30:28.800 --> 30:30.160
For those of you who are new to the board,

30:30.160 --> 30:34.720
this is our branch that you will probably see her the most.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.560
She and our Chief Deputy Superintendent at board meetings

30:37.560 --> 30:40.440
as she oversees a number of divisions

30:40.440 --> 30:42.200
like our assessment division

30:42.200 --> 30:43.800
and our data collection divisions,

30:44.520 --> 30:45.560
and you will hear from her often.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.720
We're grateful to have her here.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.960
We've added a new Director of Government Affairs

30:51.960 --> 30:54.800
who was serving as our Interim Government Affairs Director,

30:54.800 --> 30:57.760
Ellie Garner, who is a veteran Government Affairs Director

30:57.760 --> 30:58.840
and will work closely

30:58.840 --> 31:01.560
with the Government Affairs Director at the State Board

31:01.560 --> 31:03.920
and with all of our legislative leaders to shepherd

31:03.920 --> 31:06.960
through a great conversation

31:06.960 --> 31:11.960
about the importance of education in the political process.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.120
As you all know, Kai Jackson,

31:14.120 --> 31:17.240
who was our Deputy Superintendent for Equity and Access,

31:17.240 --> 31:18.360
did make the decision

31:18.360 --> 31:21.040
to leave the Department of Education to return home.

31:21.040 --> 31:24.280
He lives across the state and had decided to return home

31:24.280 --> 31:26.960
about the time that the pandemic began.

31:26.960 --> 31:28.080
I'm pleased to let you know

31:28.080 --> 31:30.120
that our former Communications Director

31:30.120 --> 31:31.560
has now taken on those duties,

31:31.560 --> 31:35.120
Kendra Britt, who will now be the Deputy Superintendent

31:35.120 --> 31:36.680
for the Equity and Access Branch,

31:36.680 --> 31:40.120
which includes the work that we do in CTE.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.760
Kendra, among many things,

31:41.760 --> 31:46.560
is a former Director, a former teacher of CTE,

31:46.560 --> 31:49.600
and we're grateful for the experiences that she brings.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.880
As she moves over into that new position,

31:51.880 --> 31:54.800
we were proud to be able to elevate someone

31:54.800 --> 31:56.600
who was in our Communications Division

31:56.600 --> 31:59.960
to take on our Communications Division as the new Director,

31:59.960 --> 32:01.080
and that's Daniel Thigpen.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.400
Many of you have met him.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.440
He's a veteran Communications Expert

32:05.440 --> 32:07.400
and has been very active in our work

32:07.400 --> 32:09.120
in shaping the message of the work

32:09.120 --> 32:11.080
that we do together at CTE

32:11.080 --> 32:12.800
and the State Board of Education.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.440
The final person I'd like to tell you about

32:14.440 --> 32:16.360
is someone who is joining us brand new

32:16.360 --> 32:18.680
in a brand new position that is grant funded

32:18.680 --> 32:20.480
that we've been working on creating

32:20.480 --> 32:22.400
for at least the last year and a half.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.840
Since the day that I started,

32:23.840 --> 32:26.920
we've talked about the need to create more work

32:26.920 --> 32:29.600
and staff positions that are focused directly

32:29.600 --> 32:31.680
on the conversation of equity,

32:31.680 --> 32:33.960
and I'm grateful that through a grant provided

32:33.960 --> 32:36.320
by the Hewlett Foundation, I can announce to you

32:36.320 --> 32:39.560
that we now have a Deputy Superintendent for Equity

32:39.560 --> 32:41.160
at the Department of Education.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.040
His name is Dr. Daniel Lee.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.880
He is a psychologist, a clinical psychologist,

32:45.880 --> 32:48.640
and a school psychologist who is a veteran leader

32:48.640 --> 32:51.720
in all areas around special education,

32:51.720 --> 32:53.880
around coaching and counseling,

32:53.880 --> 32:56.240
and around the work related to equity.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.680
He has worked in a great length

32:58.680 --> 33:00.640
at building cultural competency

33:00.640 --> 33:03.760
for a number of school districts across a number of states.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.360
We're grateful that he is joining our team.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.160
Many things that we love to share with you.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.800
We know you have a long agenda.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.560
We're grateful for the work that you provide

33:12.560 --> 33:14.160
and just know that we continue

33:14.160 --> 33:16.000
to stand shoulder to shoulder with you

33:16.000 --> 33:17.960
on the things that we can do to support you,

33:17.960 --> 33:20.200
and we'll have more updates for you as we continue.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.680
Thank you, Madam President, to submit my report.

33:22.680 --> 33:23.640
Thank you very much,

33:23.640 --> 33:26.400
and thanks for all of your very energetic leadership

33:26.400 --> 33:30.000
during this very intense and impactful time.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.720
We're in the moment of a, in a historical moment

33:33.720 --> 33:38.480
with a public health crisis, an economic crisis,

33:38.480 --> 33:41.120
and a civil rights crisis all happening at the same time,

33:41.120 --> 33:42.840
and I think what we will see

33:42.840 --> 33:46.000
are really some tectonic shifts in the society

33:46.000 --> 33:47.600
and in our education system,

33:47.600 --> 33:51.120
and that's really going to be part of what's on our plate

33:51.120 --> 33:54.600
to handle, and it's really been quite extraordinary.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.360
You see the way in which educators across California

33:57.360 --> 33:59.920
have been stepping up to these uncertainties,

34:00.840 --> 34:02.320
to these needs, to these events,

34:02.320 --> 34:05.360
and inventing and supporting

34:05.360 --> 34:08.320
and reaching out to each other and to our children,

34:08.320 --> 34:10.680
and we, I know, all want to acknowledge

34:10.680 --> 34:14.920
the extraordinary work that is going on across the state.

34:15.880 --> 34:19.200
If one thing is clear, it's that we are going to be

34:19.200 --> 34:24.120
in a very unpredictable situation for quite a while,

34:24.120 --> 34:26.600
and I just want to add just a couple of thoughts

34:26.600 --> 34:30.200
to what the state superintendent already offered,

34:31.120 --> 34:33.640
that clearly teaching and learning

34:33.640 --> 34:36.440
will be organized in many different ways this fall

34:36.440 --> 34:39.680
in in-person, some distance learning,

34:39.680 --> 34:42.480
some hybrid learning, et cetera.

34:42.480 --> 34:47.200
It will need to be governed by purpose rather than by place,

34:47.200 --> 34:49.760
and we'll see this wide array of arrangements,

34:49.760 --> 34:52.560
and I think there are four things we should be cognizant of.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.040
We'll need to design our system

34:55.040 --> 34:57.280
and the way in which we support the system

34:57.280 --> 35:00.320
to be continuous and supported by technology

35:00.320 --> 35:01.520
in the right ways,

35:01.520 --> 35:04.800
to be informed by useful formative assessments,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.000
to be as authentic as possible

35:07.000 --> 35:08.640
and focused on learning to learn.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.520
We're seeing that the places where kids are engaged

35:11.520 --> 35:13.880
and motivated and learning are those where

35:13.880 --> 35:17.120
the work is being connected to their personal experiences

35:17.120 --> 35:21.680
and to the world beyond the Zoom classroom,

35:21.680 --> 35:26.480
and to be integrated with social and emotional learning.

35:26.480 --> 35:28.480
And as Tony noted,

35:28.480 --> 35:31.760
we've been working to close the digital divide,

35:31.760 --> 35:33.760
and there will be new resources coming

35:33.760 --> 35:37.880
from the federal government that will enable districts

35:37.880 --> 35:40.520
to go further in ensuring that everyone

35:40.520 --> 35:42.600
has access to technology.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.520
Even when we go back to school,

35:44.520 --> 35:46.560
schools will probably open and close

35:46.560 --> 35:50.760
at various points in time with the rise and fall

35:50.800 --> 35:54.680
of the virus, and students will need to stay home

35:54.680 --> 35:56.760
if they have been exposed

35:56.760 --> 35:58.800
or if people in their household have been exposed.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.000
So this fluid approach to learning

36:01.000 --> 36:04.080
will be very, very important.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.600
Each district is being asked

36:05.600 --> 36:09.200
to develop an instructional continuity plan

36:09.200 --> 36:12.040
for seamless continuation of curriculum and instruction

36:12.040 --> 36:14.160
wherever students are located,

36:14.160 --> 36:16.920
and the department will be putting out a template

36:16.920 --> 36:19.080
for that plan, and I'm being told

36:19.120 --> 36:21.640
that my battery is low on my computer,

36:21.640 --> 36:25.200
so hold on a second, I'm going to get my plug.

36:28.080 --> 36:30.360
I would hate for us to get disconnected

36:30.360 --> 36:34.720
when we're in the middle of this beginning process.

36:36.440 --> 36:41.440
And so we'll need to continue to guide districts

36:41.920 --> 36:43.520
in that regard.

36:43.520 --> 36:47.400
Many districts have been establishing

36:47.400 --> 36:49.680
successful strategies for distance learning,

36:49.680 --> 36:52.360
and there's amazing and creative work going on,

36:52.360 --> 36:54.640
and we'll be trying both at the department

36:54.640 --> 36:57.160
and at the California Collaborative

36:57.160 --> 37:00.880
to share those experiences that have been

37:00.880 --> 37:03.680
the kinds of curriculum, the kinds of strategies,

37:03.680 --> 37:06.400
and the excellent teaching that have been going on

37:06.400 --> 37:08.440
across the state.

37:08.440 --> 37:12.640
It'll be important as kids come back to school

37:12.640 --> 37:15.080
to really assess where they are.

37:15.080 --> 37:17.800
There's a lot of concern about learning loss.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.440
Now, of course, kids are always learning.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.680
It's a question of what they're learning,

37:21.680 --> 37:23.320
but it's going to be very important

37:23.320 --> 37:26.880
that we have good formative assessments

37:26.880 --> 37:28.960
when students return to school

37:28.960 --> 37:31.360
to understand where they are in their learning,

37:31.360 --> 37:35.120
to deal with it as continuous progress forward

37:35.120 --> 37:38.480
rather than a deficit approach that labels

37:38.480 --> 37:42.280
or stigmatizes students when they return to school.

37:42.280 --> 37:47.280
And just this week, we have released a set of guidelines

37:47.840 --> 37:51.600
for formative assessment that districts can use.

37:51.600 --> 37:54.120
The department already has approved a set

37:54.120 --> 37:56.520
of diagnostic and formative assessments

37:56.520 --> 37:59.000
that are aligned with the Common Core Standards.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.960
They offer tools not only for assessment,

38:01.960 --> 38:05.480
but also connections to instructional materials

38:05.480 --> 38:09.480
and curriculum materials across the grade span

38:09.480 --> 38:11.600
from K through 12.

38:11.840 --> 38:15.040
And so those will be a very important part

38:15.040 --> 38:18.720
of the school reopening process.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.800
But as we all know,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.720
as students return to school this fall,

38:21.720 --> 38:25.120
they'll bring with them a wide range of experiences.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.120
Even students who were in the same class

38:27.120 --> 38:28.960
when schools initially closed

38:28.960 --> 38:30.960
will have had different home lives,

38:30.960 --> 38:33.760
experiences, responsibilities,

38:33.760 --> 38:35.440
different access to devices

38:35.440 --> 38:37.280
and support for distance learning,

38:37.280 --> 38:40.120
different emotional reactions to the ongoing

38:40.160 --> 38:44.800
and unfolding situation that Superintendent Thurmond noted.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.560
Beyond the death of George Floyd,

38:47.560 --> 38:48.720
there have been actually deaths

38:48.720 --> 38:51.800
of multiple unarmed Black men and women

38:51.800 --> 38:54.440
at the hands of the police and protests

38:54.440 --> 38:57.520
that are raising all of the equity issues,

38:57.520 --> 39:01.160
not only in that regard, but in our schools as well.

39:01.160 --> 39:03.960
And we'll need to be tackling those as well.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.520
We've had inequitable school funding,

39:06.520 --> 39:10.000
inequitable access to teachers and curriculum.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.440
These are long-standing issues

39:12.440 --> 39:14.160
in school systems across the country.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.240
California is stepping up around many of those issues

39:17.240 --> 39:19.160
and we have further to go

39:19.160 --> 39:22.200
that will need to be on our plates as well.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.280
And the inequity in what students have experienced

39:25.280 --> 39:28.280
during the pandemic is part of what we'll need

39:28.280 --> 39:31.920
to be prepared to deal with once school reopens.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.760
Some students may have been in daily online learning

39:35.760 --> 39:37.040
with a well-planned curriculum

39:37.040 --> 39:39.000
supported by teachers and counselors

39:39.040 --> 39:40.960
since the week after schools closed.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.240
And I know a number of those districts

39:43.240 --> 39:46.080
where they hit the ground running, everybody had devices,

39:46.080 --> 39:47.760
everybody was in class,

39:47.760 --> 39:50.680
the curriculum just continued almost seamlessly.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.400
Others may have had very little instruction

39:54.400 --> 39:56.760
for a month or more after schools closed

39:56.760 --> 39:59.640
and may have been working with a hard copy

39:59.640 --> 40:01.760
instructional packets that they complete

40:01.760 --> 40:04.280
by teaching themselves on their own time.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.320
Some may have sheltered in place safely

40:06.320 --> 40:08.760
with all of their needs met.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.560
Others may have experienced illness

40:10.560 --> 40:12.680
and the loss of loved ones.

40:12.680 --> 40:14.600
Their families may have lost employment,

40:14.600 --> 40:16.520
housing, healthcare.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.240
They may be experiencing food insecurity

40:19.240 --> 40:21.200
and teachers are going to need to take stock

40:21.200 --> 40:23.800
of all of those experiences and needs,

40:23.800 --> 40:26.360
social, emotional, health-related,

40:26.360 --> 40:29.640
trauma-related and academic

40:29.640 --> 40:32.200
as we build safe and welcoming communities

40:32.200 --> 40:34.880
in line, online and in person

40:34.880 --> 40:37.680
or a combination of both when school begins.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.720
So we'll be offering as much support as possible,

40:41.720 --> 40:45.000
both through guidance

40:45.000 --> 40:47.280
and professional learning opportunities

40:47.280 --> 40:52.280
and sharing successful experiences.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.160
And when additional federal funds come through,

40:55.160 --> 40:58.960
hopefully for supporting the wraparound services

40:58.960 --> 41:01.200
and supports that will be needed

41:01.200 --> 41:05.400
so that students can start the school year

41:05.400 --> 41:08.000
with the kind of caring support

41:08.000 --> 41:10.040
that we know all of our educators

41:10.040 --> 41:12.960
are trying to provide in extraordinary ways

41:12.960 --> 41:16.040
and that our policies and practices

41:16.040 --> 41:18.160
should support them in doing.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.800
And with that, we're going to launch into our agenda.

41:26.040 --> 41:30.400
And we now will take up agenda item two,

41:30.400 --> 41:32.600
which is our accountability item.

41:33.600 --> 41:38.600
And this is going to be presented by Cindy Kazanis

41:38.760 --> 41:42.360
with guest presenters, Eric Crane and Deb Sigman of WestEd

41:42.360 --> 41:45.000
and Joseph Martino of ETS.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.720
And the recommendation we're considering

41:47.720 --> 41:49.760
is that the State Board provide guidance

41:49.760 --> 41:53.360
on the proposed student growth model methodology.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.680
Cindy, great to see you.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.080
You may begin.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.400
Thank you.

41:58.400 --> 42:01.160
Thank you, member, rather President Linda Darling-Hammond

42:01.240 --> 42:03.800
and welcome to the new board members.

42:03.800 --> 42:06.200
I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis,

42:06.200 --> 42:08.800
Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

42:08.800 --> 42:12.080
And as President Linda Darling-Hammond stated,

42:12.080 --> 42:14.080
we're going to have a lot of folks

42:14.080 --> 42:16.280
helping us to do this item today.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.520
So this may be a long discussion

42:19.520 --> 42:24.280
based on this board's prior engagement with the growth model.

42:24.280 --> 42:26.880
And so we're prepared for pauses

42:26.880 --> 42:28.800
in between each of our presenters

42:28.800 --> 42:32.000
to allow for clarifying questions.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.520
And we'll take this at the pace that you feel comfortable.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.560
So I think the first thing I wanted to do today

42:37.560 --> 42:40.440
is just do some housekeeping and to introduce myself.

42:40.440 --> 42:43.000
And you're going to hear from a member of my team

42:43.000 --> 42:45.600
in just a bit, Jenny Singh.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.560
Our division is responsible for accountability,

42:48.560 --> 42:51.600
for data reporting and for sharing data

42:51.600 --> 42:54.120
with the research communities.

42:54.120 --> 42:55.920
So I know later in our agenda,

42:55.920 --> 42:58.120
you're going to hear from my colleague, Mal Vang,

42:58.120 --> 43:00.160
and she is responsible for our assessment division.

43:00.160 --> 43:03.480
So this item is not about assessments per se,

43:03.480 --> 43:04.840
it's how we use the assessments

43:04.840 --> 43:07.280
in our accountability division.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.640
It's nice to see in the room a couple of familiar faces

43:11.640 --> 43:13.280
that we haven't seen in about four months.

43:13.280 --> 43:15.280
And so working remotely,

43:15.280 --> 43:17.320
we've been able to put together this item

43:17.320 --> 43:19.920
and bring the people that you're going to hear from today.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.400
I also wanted to let you know that because it's summer,

43:22.400 --> 43:26.000
we are joined yet again by another awesome

43:26.000 --> 43:28.800
Stanford and government student, Parth Sarin,

43:28.800 --> 43:30.880
who is going to be helping us,

43:30.880 --> 43:33.160
has already helped us rather with the growth model

43:33.160 --> 43:35.920
and participated in a discussion that we held

43:35.920 --> 43:37.560
the first week he was on the job.

43:39.920 --> 43:43.640
So today we will be covering in depth,

43:43.640 --> 43:45.440
again, the student growth models

43:45.440 --> 43:47.680
on communicating smarter balance results.

43:47.680 --> 43:49.800
And then we'll do a brief overview

43:49.800 --> 43:52.960
at the conclusion of the item on the legislative action

43:52.960 --> 43:55.840
that has taken place since we last met

43:56.680 --> 43:57.920
for the California School Dashboard

43:57.920 --> 44:00.280
and the Local Control and Accountability Plan.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.040
So to get us started,

44:04.040 --> 44:09.040
the recommendation is that the Department of Education

44:10.000 --> 44:11.520
is asking the State Board of Education

44:11.520 --> 44:13.080
to provide guidance as appropriate

44:13.080 --> 44:16.560
on proposed student growth model methodology.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.120
So just to break this down for our new members,

44:19.120 --> 44:21.600
this means that you're not literally taking action today,

44:21.600 --> 44:22.760
we're asking for guidance.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.520
So I think this is a good low stakes meaning

44:25.520 --> 44:27.600
for you to ask clarifying questions

44:27.600 --> 44:30.040
to get a thorough understanding of where we've been

44:30.040 --> 44:31.880
and where we're headed.

44:31.880 --> 44:35.680
I see this process similar to getting your graduate degree,

44:35.680 --> 44:37.120
maybe even your dissertation,

44:37.120 --> 44:39.920
because it's gonna take us about seven years

44:39.920 --> 44:43.240
when we think about when we started in 2016

44:43.240 --> 44:47.360
to completing this process in 2022 or 2023

44:47.360 --> 44:49.440
with the incorporation of the growth model

44:49.440 --> 44:51.120
into the accountability system.

44:51.120 --> 44:53.680
So really there's two parts to a decision

44:53.680 --> 44:55.080
that you'll be making in the future.

44:55.240 --> 44:58.280
Part one is what you'll be taking up this fall,

44:58.280 --> 45:00.960
which is the formal adoption of a model

45:00.960 --> 45:03.320
so that we can provide results to the field

45:03.320 --> 45:06.760
based on past information, prior students,

45:06.760 --> 45:09.200
on how they're doing and get the field comfortable

45:09.200 --> 45:11.320
and our parents and community members comfortable

45:11.320 --> 45:13.440
with how this model works.

45:13.440 --> 45:17.000
Part two is how it's incorporated into the dashboard.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.480
And like every other state in this country,

45:19.480 --> 45:21.880
we had a suspension of our assessments this year.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.560
It takes two years of consecutive student scores

45:25.560 --> 45:26.840
to create a growth model.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.120
So all states will be in the position again next year

45:30.120 --> 45:34.040
of having a gap in reporting out on their growth models.

45:34.040 --> 45:38.040
So you'll hear from, again, my colleagues on

45:38.040 --> 45:40.760
the timing of incorporating into the dashboard,

45:40.760 --> 45:43.320
but that's not what's part of the discussion today

45:43.320 --> 45:44.640
or even for this year.

45:44.640 --> 45:48.080
This is again, future year action.

45:48.920 --> 45:51.920
We have provided 10 information memos

45:51.920 --> 45:53.280
about the growth model.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.120
We've had four board meetings

45:55.120 --> 45:58.040
in which we've discussed this item in general.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.280
So we're now on our fifth meeting.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.880
We are ready in September to talk about this again,

46:02.880 --> 46:04.880
in November to talk about it yet again,

46:04.880 --> 46:07.480
and hopefully again for you all to take action

46:07.480 --> 46:10.280
to formally adopt the growth model.

46:10.280 --> 46:14.000
The last time we brought this to you as a formal item

46:14.000 --> 46:15.440
was about two years ago.

46:15.440 --> 46:18.240
It was July of 2019.

46:18.240 --> 46:21.800
It was following a discussion in May 2018,

46:21.800 --> 46:24.480
rather, it was following a discussion in which,

46:25.720 --> 46:27.000
I have my dates wrong.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.080
The last time we brought this friendly to you was in 2018.

46:31.080 --> 46:35.800
And in July of that year, you had asked us to take a pause,

46:35.800 --> 46:37.720
take a year to really work with stakeholders

46:37.720 --> 46:39.520
to understand the growth model process.

46:39.520 --> 46:41.840
So you're gonna hear a little bit about that

46:41.840 --> 46:44.280
from our colleagues at the Comprehensive Center.

46:45.760 --> 46:48.800
This really, this effort could not be done

46:48.800 --> 46:51.480
without our colleagues at the Comprehensive Center

46:51.480 --> 46:55.920
to take this break in 2019

46:55.920 --> 46:58.640
to gather a common understanding

46:58.640 --> 47:00.480
of what growth models can do

47:00.480 --> 47:03.120
and the direction the board had already set us

47:03.120 --> 47:03.960
on the path for,

47:03.960 --> 47:07.160
which was further exploring the residual growth model.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.000
You're also gonna hear from experts

47:10.000 --> 47:12.240
at the Educational Testing Services

47:12.240 --> 47:15.160
who will review what questions the growth model

47:15.680 --> 47:16.520
can and cannot answer

47:16.520 --> 47:18.800
and provide an overview of proposed methodology

47:18.800 --> 47:20.440
to stabilize the growth model.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.440
So ETS, our colleagues through our assessment contract,

47:24.440 --> 47:26.880
and we're working closely with our colleagues

47:26.880 --> 47:29.600
in our assessment division on this matter,

47:29.600 --> 47:31.280
are talking on a weekly basis.

47:31.280 --> 47:36.200
So this is a very intense workload for us,

47:36.200 --> 47:38.440
but because of the suspension of the dashboard,

47:38.440 --> 47:40.920
which you're gonna hear about towards the end of this item,

47:40.920 --> 47:44.440
we really have the right people working on this.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.680
And I think we're ready to, again,

47:46.680 --> 47:47.880
support the board in any way

47:47.880 --> 47:48.760
so that you feel comfortable

47:48.760 --> 47:50.560
in making a decision come November.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.720
Finally, we will walk you through a couple of questions

47:56.720 --> 48:00.600
to help generate some, hopefully some interest

48:00.600 --> 48:03.000
and some guidance towards what we need to do

48:03.000 --> 48:05.520
moving forward as we prepare, again,

48:05.520 --> 48:08.360
to bring back this for action,

48:08.360 --> 48:11.200
not only for the discussion in September,

48:11.200 --> 48:12.560
but for action in November.

48:14.720 --> 48:17.880
So before we get started, I wanted to remind you,

48:17.880 --> 48:19.400
because I know this came up two years ago.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.800
I actually looked at my notes this morning.

48:21.800 --> 48:26.800
Education code section 442.58.9 prohibits the use

48:26.800 --> 48:29.320
of specified data from being used

48:29.320 --> 48:30.800
by a local educational agency

48:30.800 --> 48:33.800
for purposes of evaluating certificated employees,

48:33.800 --> 48:36.680
certificated employee performance determinations,

48:36.680 --> 48:38.000
or employment decisions.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.560
And why this isn't really important

48:39.560 --> 48:42.400
is because today we're talking about a growth model

48:42.400 --> 48:44.520
for use in the accountability system.

48:44.520 --> 48:48.080
Accountability system doesn't measure teacher performance.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.240
It doesn't measure individual student performance.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.840
We're looking at things at a school level

48:52.840 --> 48:54.320
and at a district level.

48:54.320 --> 48:56.960
And so this discussion came up last time

48:56.960 --> 48:58.880
because there are concerns now

48:58.880 --> 49:02.960
that you're attaching a growth piece to a student

49:02.960 --> 49:05.280
that this could possibly be used

49:05.280 --> 49:07.920
in violation of this education code.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.280
So I just brought this forward just as a reminder

49:10.280 --> 49:11.720
that that is not the intended use.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.080
And in fact, the state is prohibited

49:13.080 --> 49:15.680
from doing just that by education code.

49:17.480 --> 49:20.040
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to my colleagues

49:20.040 --> 49:22.520
at the Region 15 Comprehensive Center,

49:22.520 --> 49:24.800
Deborah Sigmon and Eric Crane.

49:27.960 --> 49:29.720
Thank you, Cindy.

49:29.720 --> 49:32.520
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond

49:32.520 --> 49:34.760
and Superintendent Thurman and board members.

49:34.760 --> 49:37.840
And congratulations to the new board members.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.000
I'm Deb Sigmon.

49:39.000 --> 49:44.000
I serve as a senior managing director with WestEd.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.800
I also serve as the co-director

49:46.800 --> 49:50.200
of the Region 15 Comprehensive Center.

49:50.200 --> 49:52.520
And I just want to give you a little background

49:52.520 --> 49:55.600
about the center so that you have a sense

49:55.600 --> 50:00.120
of why we are able to assist the California Department of Ed

50:00.120 --> 50:03.040
as well as the state board in these matters.

50:03.040 --> 50:03.880
Next slide.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.280
So the Region 15 Comprehensive Center

50:13.280 --> 50:15.600
is a part of a very large network.

50:15.600 --> 50:20.600
There are 19 centers throughout the United States

50:21.640 --> 50:26.240
and these technical assistance centers are funded

50:26.240 --> 50:30.280
by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education.

50:30.280 --> 50:33.680
What's interesting about this project, as Cindy explained,

50:33.680 --> 50:38.680
this is a long process and California is rightly taking

50:38.960 --> 50:41.920
its time to make the right decisions for students

50:41.920 --> 50:45.120
and teachers as they consider a growth model.

50:45.120 --> 50:48.800
We began this project in late 2018

50:48.800 --> 50:52.880
after your July, 2018 meeting.

50:52.880 --> 50:56.240
At that time, we were the California Comprehensive Center

50:56.240 --> 50:58.640
and I was the director of that center.

50:58.640 --> 51:01.440
We served only California.

51:01.440 --> 51:06.440
Since that time, we are the recipient of a new grant,

51:06.600 --> 51:09.920
which is now the Region 15 Comprehensive Center

51:09.920 --> 51:12.120
and the geography has changed a bit.

51:12.120 --> 51:17.120
We now serve California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona.

51:17.560 --> 51:18.400
Next slide.

51:20.920 --> 51:24.920
And our priority areas in order to provide

51:24.920 --> 51:27.560
technical assistance to the Department of Ed

51:27.560 --> 51:29.960
and the State Board of Ed are really centered

51:29.960 --> 51:33.720
around three areas, equitable teaching and learning,

51:33.720 --> 51:35.960
standards assessment and accountability

51:36.480 --> 51:38.280
and systems improvement.

51:38.280 --> 51:41.280
So when we were asked to provide some assistance

51:41.280 --> 51:44.080
around the growth model, that fit squarely

51:44.080 --> 51:45.840
into our standards assessment

51:45.840 --> 51:48.280
and accountability priority area.

51:49.280 --> 51:52.160
I just want to give a little bit of,

51:52.160 --> 51:54.920
my colleague Eric Prang will go into the timeline

51:54.920 --> 51:58.800
a little bit more, but as with all things,

51:58.800 --> 52:03.800
we were able to shift as the needs of the stakeholders

52:03.840 --> 52:08.840
changed as the conversations became really deep and rich.

52:09.560 --> 52:12.880
And so we were scheduled for three meetings,

52:12.880 --> 52:16.000
which is what we described to the department

52:16.000 --> 52:19.440
and the State Board staff is what we would need.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.200
As it turns out, we actually added a fourth meeting

52:22.200 --> 52:25.600
for the stakeholder group and then an update meeting

52:25.600 --> 52:27.840
that we just held last week.

52:27.840 --> 52:31.240
All that to say that these are moving kinds of conversations

52:31.240 --> 52:33.680
and I do want to give a really a shout out

52:33.680 --> 52:36.160
to the stakeholder members who were so engaged

52:36.160 --> 52:39.520
in the process and really committed to thinking

52:39.520 --> 52:41.680
about growth models and what they did

52:41.680 --> 52:43.120
and what they didn't do.

52:43.120 --> 52:46.880
And so it was indeed a pleasure to be able to support

52:46.880 --> 52:50.440
that work and facilitate those conversations.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.360
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Eric Crane.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.200
Eric.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.360
Thank you, Deb.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.680
Board President Darling-Hammond and Superintendent Thurmond

53:00.760 --> 53:02.440
and members of the Board,

53:02.440 --> 53:05.440
thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.640
I'm Eric Crane and I'm a project director over this work

53:08.640 --> 53:11.440
for the Region 15 Comprehensive Center.

53:11.440 --> 53:16.440
And I wanted to start by describing the work,

53:17.040 --> 53:19.520
the beginnings of it and what it set out to do.

53:20.760 --> 53:23.400
Key here was stakeholder feedback about the growth model.

53:23.400 --> 53:26.880
And so when the department reached out

53:26.880 --> 53:30.680
to the Comprehensive Center to begin this work,

53:30.680 --> 53:33.000
it was oriented with following goals in mind.

53:33.920 --> 53:35.920
The department wanted to understand

53:35.920 --> 53:37.680
what was on the mind of stakeholders.

53:37.680 --> 53:41.360
So getting to the heart of stakeholder priorities.

53:41.360 --> 53:44.160
There was a lot of discussion about various growth models

53:44.160 --> 53:47.040
and to be some confusion about some.

53:47.040 --> 53:51.080
And so another goal was to bring in technical expertise

53:51.080 --> 53:55.320
to describe the growth models, to do some level setting

53:55.320 --> 53:58.760
so that all stakeholders were at a pretty similar

53:58.760 --> 54:00.520
starting place.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.600
So clear up some of those misconceptions.

54:03.600 --> 54:07.400
But to really talk about how a growth model in California

54:07.400 --> 54:11.000
could be used to drive school and district improvement.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.400
Another goal of the work was to make sure

54:14.400 --> 54:18.520
that there was a trusting and well-facilitated space

54:18.520 --> 54:21.680
where stakeholders could speak frankly and directly

54:21.680 --> 54:24.560
about what was good and not so good

54:24.560 --> 54:26.480
about various growth model options.

54:27.760 --> 54:30.720
And then finally, the last major goal was to make sure

54:30.720 --> 54:34.840
that stakeholders would lead conversations

54:34.840 --> 54:38.400
well-equipped to go and be ambassadors for the work

54:38.400 --> 54:40.840
to really explain what was happening

54:40.840 --> 54:43.440
in the discussions at the state

54:43.440 --> 54:45.800
and to share that with their communities.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.440
And actually to solicit further feedback

54:48.440 --> 54:51.160
so that this process could be well-informed

54:51.160 --> 54:53.520
by stakeholder feedback and input.

54:53.520 --> 54:54.720
So next slide, please.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
I want to walk a little bit through the timeline

55:01.000 --> 55:02.720
and go into a little bit more detail

55:02.720 --> 55:05.680
about the stakeholder feedback work.

55:07.200 --> 55:12.120
As I said, this work began and was motivated

55:12.120 --> 55:16.680
by conversations for the board two years ago.

55:17.520 --> 55:20.600
And as Cindy said, the antecedents

55:20.600 --> 55:23.440
are even further back before that.

55:24.320 --> 55:29.320
But in July, the board asked for some more work

55:29.320 --> 55:31.560
and some outreach to find out

55:31.560 --> 55:35.160
and take the temperature of the state on this issue.

55:35.160 --> 55:38.120
And so the Department of Education reached out

55:38.120 --> 55:40.360
to the Comprehensive Center.

55:40.360 --> 55:42.600
And we put together a plan

55:42.600 --> 55:45.480
where we would have three stakeholder meetings.

55:46.680 --> 55:49.360
As Deb alluded to, we saw the need for a fourth

55:49.360 --> 55:50.920
and built that into 2019.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.720
I'll speak to that in just a moment.

55:53.600 --> 55:58.440
And so throughout the early part of 2019,

55:59.360 --> 56:02.120
we teamed the stakeholders group.

56:02.120 --> 56:07.120
We met in February and not all the stakeholders could join.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.080
And so we had a catch-up meeting

56:10.080 --> 56:12.960
for the additional stakeholders in March.

56:12.960 --> 56:17.880
And so by the end of March, we convened the group

56:17.880 --> 56:21.720
and had a chance to explore some of the growth models

56:21.720 --> 56:23.400
and do some level setting

56:23.400 --> 56:25.960
around different growth model options.

56:25.960 --> 56:26.840
And I should say something

56:26.840 --> 56:28.800
about the growth model stakeholders.

56:29.880 --> 56:31.880
They represent a lot of folks

56:31.880 --> 56:34.160
who have been engaged in this work,

56:34.160 --> 56:37.240
members of the Local Control Funding Formula

56:37.240 --> 56:41.600
Equity Coalition, the Office of Education staff,

56:41.600 --> 56:45.960
classroom teachers, the California PTA is represented

56:45.960 --> 56:46.880
in the stakeholders group.

56:46.880 --> 56:51.040
So it's a very diverse and engaged group.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.440
And that brought us to our second meeting.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.520
We had that in early April.

56:57.640 --> 57:01.360
And the group walked through various interpretations

57:01.360 --> 57:03.400
and they went through questions

57:03.400 --> 57:06.800
that a growth model might help to answer and inform.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.160
And all this helped to uncover

57:10.040 --> 57:14.040
and unearth what stakeholders wanted from a growth model.

57:15.080 --> 57:17.880
The work continued with our third meeting in May

57:17.880 --> 57:20.800
where we touched on some of the analytic models

57:21.560 --> 57:24.440
and reviewed what some other states had done

57:24.440 --> 57:26.920
with growth problems and continued the discussion.

57:28.240 --> 57:32.480
What that set up was kind of turning

57:32.480 --> 57:36.200
from within the growth model stakeholder group

57:36.200 --> 57:38.480
to how we could set up discussions

57:38.480 --> 57:42.160
for the stakeholders to go back to their wider communities.

57:42.160 --> 57:45.080
And so the comprehensive center staff

57:45.080 --> 57:50.080
built a conversations kit that we armed our stakeholders

57:50.080 --> 57:54.240
to go back and use that to help with discussions

57:54.240 --> 57:56.040
back in the wider field.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.640
And then we had that fourth meeting.

57:59.560 --> 58:03.240
That fourth meeting in September,

58:03.240 --> 58:07.000
we heard what they had heard when they went back

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
and spoke with their broader communities.

58:10.000 --> 58:13.280
And it was pretty clear from this set of four meetings

58:13.280 --> 58:17.680
that a 2020 update would be appropriate.

58:17.680 --> 58:22.280
And so the department committed to that.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.200
And we just had that, as Deb said,

58:24.200 --> 58:26.600
we just had that meeting last week.

58:26.600 --> 58:29.480
And so that's sort of an overview as to where we are.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.000
This slide that you're looking at now

58:31.000 --> 58:33.560
comes from last week's meeting.

58:33.560 --> 58:34.960
And let me just say a little bit more

58:34.960 --> 58:36.280
about last week's meeting.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.200
Next slide, please.

58:41.680 --> 58:44.040
When we gathered last week, here's what we did.

58:45.040 --> 58:48.080
We went over the 2019 work,

58:48.080 --> 58:52.880
and department staff summarized the timeline,

58:52.880 --> 58:56.240
and you'll hear a little bit more about that shortly.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.400
Partnering with Educational Testing Service,

58:58.400 --> 59:01.120
they did a presentation that talked about

59:01.120 --> 59:03.800
the recent technical work on the growth model.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.920
And it had an emphasis on this estimated

59:06.920 --> 59:09.440
best linear predictor model.

59:09.440 --> 59:12.560
And then we had some small group discussion

59:12.560 --> 59:16.960
where we asked stakeholders to give some reaction

59:16.960 --> 59:18.560
to what they'd heard,

59:18.560 --> 59:22.240
raise whatever questions were on their minds.

59:22.240 --> 59:26.520
And then we kind of documented the discussion.

59:26.520 --> 59:30.520
So setting things up for the continued work

59:30.520 --> 59:33.320
in the remainder of 2020 and beyond.

59:34.880 --> 59:35.720
Next.

59:38.120 --> 59:41.640
And that's just our required material

59:41.640 --> 59:43.640
for the US Department of Education.

59:43.640 --> 59:44.960
So that concludes my remarks.

59:44.960 --> 59:48.000
And Cindy, I will send it back over to you now.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.240
Great, so I think we can take a pause here,

59:50.240 --> 59:53.160
and I will turn it over to President Darlene Hammond

59:53.160 --> 59:54.680
to see if there's any clarifying questions

59:54.680 --> 59:55.800
from board members.

59:55.800 --> 01:00:00.800
And I don't see any hands, Linda.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.440
Okay, great, why don't we continue, Cindy?

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.720
Great, so with that, I'm going to turn it over

01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.680
to my colleague, Jenny Singh to introduce herself

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.560
and this piece of the item.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.480
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.760
and esteemed board members.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.600
And welcome to our new board members.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.280
I'm looking forward to working with you

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.240
over the next few years.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:43.000
I'm going to be talking, doing a brief overview

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.360
of how we got to where we are in the growth model.

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:50.400
Please note that we did a very in-depth overview

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.320
in the June memo.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320
So if you want all the details,

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:57.600
I think we did a good job of providing all those

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.600
in the June memo.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:02.000
So as we shared at the March meeting,

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.800
we are recommending that we continue the work

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.960
on the residual gain model.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.040
So just to refer briefly back to the board item,

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.000
remember that we did investigate many models

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.120
and we brought three models to the board

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.960
and we decided that we would investigate those models

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.800
more in depth.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:30.480
So ETS did an evaluation on all three models

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.120
and in the end, the board settled

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.440
on the residual gain model.

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.240
So as we continued our work on the residual gain model

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.840
and looked at the results of how it acted over time,

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.280
we realized that we needed some technical adjustments

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.080
that could enhance the validity and cross time stability.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.720
And recall from our several meetings

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.440
that we have conversations that we had about this,

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:05.600
that the state board decided that student demographics

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.200
should not be included as a control variable

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.080
in the growth model.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.900
And that is a really important thing to remember.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.880
So here's our original growth model timelines

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.800
starting with August.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.880
I don't wanna go back to 2016.

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.760
That would take a long time.

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.960
And I'm sure you're gonna see right away

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.960
where this timeline will have to change.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.360
So originally, and this is still gonna happen

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.000
in August of 2020, ETS is going to present their findings

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
on their modifications to the RG growth model

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.840
to our technical design group.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.440
And our technical design group will recommend

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.320
any modifications if any.

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:51.720
Then in September, we're gonna be bringing,

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.780
coming back with a presentation of the results from ETS.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.240
And then of course, in November,

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.440
we're hoping to come back and get an approval

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.720
of a growth model that will measure

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.120
individual student growth.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.880
And initially, we thought that in September of 2020

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.680
with the release of the 2020 dashboard,

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.560
we would release growth scores using CAS data

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:18.560
from 2016 through 2020.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.500
And of course, with the suspension of our assessments,

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.440
that's not gonna be possible.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:28.560
And we had also anticipated that between January

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.960
and November of 21, we would work with LEAs

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.780
and stakeholders on communication data

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:37.440
and using some case studies.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:41.240
And then we had anticipated that in December of 2021,

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.680
we would release the growth scores

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:44.960
using CAS data from 2021.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.560
Then some small event came around called COVID-19.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.280
And it kind of changed the way we started to look

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.700
at how we were gonna move forward with the growth model.

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.800
So nothing changed for August, September and November.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.200
But of course, for December,

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.960
that meant that when we released the growth scores,

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.960
we could only use prior year data, 2016 to 2019.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.320
So this is gonna be looking back

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.240
at the growth from previous years.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.160
This also means that we have an extended window

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:22.760
to have some conversations with LEAs and stakeholders.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.760
So we can go from January 21 through November of 22

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:33.160
to talk about really some good ways to communicate

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:35.120
what the growth model is telling us

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.120
and trying to figure out the best way to display this data

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.240
for the general public.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.880
Because we all know that growth models are quite complicated

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:47.920
and we want to communicate it in a simple way

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.380
that people can understand.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.400
So with December of 2021,

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.240
we will not have the data to release growth scores.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:59.640
So we will continue to use the academic indicator methodology

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.920
that we currently have, the distance to met.

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.720
And then for December, 2022,

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:09.440
we can release another set of growth scores

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:13.560
using data from 2021 and 2022.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.960
So as we mentioned earlier,

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.460
we had the stakeholder meetings

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:27.320
and CDE staff did attend those meetings

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.680
and it was very clear from those meetings

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.400
how deeply valued a growth model was

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.600
for the California accountability system.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.620
But we also saw how difficult it was

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:39.860
to create a growth measure

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:43.380
that covers the wide variety of information

01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:45.700
that various people had.

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.460
Growth models, each growth,

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.020
there's a lot of different growth models

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.460
and each growth model will answer different questions.

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:55.240
And there really was not a complete consensus

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.260
about which questions we should ask.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:06:01.100
In fact, the suggestion came around,

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.740
well, maybe we should have more than one growth model,

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.700
but that's not gonna be possible.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.820
But we concluded that from all the conversations

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.700
that we had, that the residual gain model

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.300
really was the best fit for the expectations

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.660
expressed by the group.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.700
So beginning in February of 2020,

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.420
we began working on some technical modifications

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.420
that would improve the results of the residual gain model

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.140
within our accountability framework.

01:06:30.140 --> 01:06:32.180
So specifically that meant

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.980
the year to year volatility of scores.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.940
So you can remember we had that conversation

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:39.460
at the July 2018 meeting

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.980
about the validity of the scores from year to year.

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.740
So what did that really mean?

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.960
So as you know, when we developed our growth model,

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.300
we had some established criteria or requirements

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:55.180
that we wanted our growth model to meet.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.880
And when we found out about this year to year volatility,

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.340
it impacted whether this,

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.740
impacted the fact that this model

01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:05.420
did not meet that criteria.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.380
So one of the criteria is reliable data.

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.500
This is the assessment results are reliable data

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500
that we get from schools and districts.

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:18.860
We get the file directly from our contractor, ATS.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.180
But we weren't sure that the outcomes

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:24.540
were gonna be valid and fair for all schools.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.380
Even though the RG model performs

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:31.380
statistically similar in both years,

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.380
there was that low cross stability within the outcomes.

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:39.380
And that was particularly evident with low end sizes.

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.660
So then of course, the growth model would not be as fair

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:45.420
to small schools and small student groups

01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.440
as it was to large schools.

01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:51.900
And then we do like, we want our information

01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.880
to provide actionable information.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.420
The dashboard should do that

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:58.480
for when districts are developing their out caps.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.260
So high volatility results can make it difficult

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:05.220
for LEAs to use the growth data for driving decisions.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.140
Because the decision you make one year

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.300
might be contradicted by the data

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.860
that you receive the next year.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:16.220
And we felt that there was a strong risk

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.060
of misinterpretation when the results

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:21.740
would be going up and down over time.

01:08:21.740 --> 01:08:26.740
So we began our work with the TDG

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:32.900
to make some technical adjustments.

01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.420
So the first one was changing

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:37.860
the highest obtainable scale score or the HAAS.

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:39.620
And that's on the CAS.

01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.620
This allows more students to show higher growth.

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.820
Right now, the HAAS is capped.

01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.500
And so students that are performing very well,

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.340
they are not allowed, it's very difficult for them

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:55.660
to show growth from one year to the next.

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:59.020
So we did make adjustments to the HAAS scores.

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:00.700
We are not the first state to do this.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:01.900
In fact, we are one of the last

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:03.660
smarter balanced states to do this.

01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.900
Many other states have already made adjustments

01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.120
to their HAAS scores.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:10.380
And then we thought about implementing

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.980
a new regression formula to counter

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.500
the end size and stability issues.

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.500
And ETS has been working on this.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:22.500
They've been great to work with.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.460
We have very knowledgeable, they have very

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.900
knowledgeable staff who are experts in this area.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:31.020
And they came up with a formula known as

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:36.020
the Estimated Best Linear Predictor Model, or EBLIP.

01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.920
Yes, EBLIP, sorry.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.380
So we've been working on that together

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.300
and they have been looking at the data

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.100
to see how it's going to impact the RG model.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.820
And they're going to bring those, as I said,

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:54.860
they're going to bring the results to you in September.

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:58.260
Member, President Lyndon Arninghamen,

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.420
would you like to pause for clarifying questions

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:03.080
before we switch over to the ETS staff?

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:07.660
We can't hear you.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.620
I don't think your mic, you're on mute.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.260
Sorry, can you hear me?

01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:13.460
Yes.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.060
I think we should go right ahead with the ETS presentation

01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:19.140
because it's going to explain some of what

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.780
was just described.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:23.860
Okay?

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.680
Great.

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.520
Great.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.360
Thank you.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.360
So we would like to turn it over to Joseph Martinow,

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.900
who is the Executive Director for the Center

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:36.900
for Operational Solutions and Innovations

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:39.780
with the Psychometric Analysts and Research

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.220
with ETS, Education Testing Services.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:44.060
Joseph?

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.140
Yeah.

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:47.580
Thank you.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:50.260
Board President Arninghamen, Superintendent Thurmond,

01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:52.460
and members of the California State Board of Education,

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.380
thank you for the opportunity today.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.660
I have with me as well, the person who is the primary,

01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:05.580
the primary developer of the EVE-UP model.

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.580
His name is Jarrah Lockwood,

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:12.060
and he is one of our experts in growth.

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.340
He's done a lot of work in the area.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:19.340
So just wanted to kind of talk about what are growth models

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:25.460
and how do we think about that?

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.300
How do we get there?

01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.820
And so there's one concept of a growth model

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:34.940
where it's just pure growth.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.380
And that kind of growth model actually assumes a scale

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.940
that doesn't change over time or over grades.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.380
It does require multiple measures for the same person.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:49.020
And this really is kind of what most people think of

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.060
as a growth model.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.980
So these kinds of things are available for physical scale,

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.660
such as height, you can,

01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:00.660
the difference between one inch and two inches,

01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:02.380
and two inches and three inches,

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:06.260
and 24 inches and 25 inches, it's just, it's always one.

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:08.340
And it has the same meaning.

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:11.260
So you can think about that in terms of weight,

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:15.700
scales that we can use,

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:20.500
where a difference of one pound always means the same thing.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:22.300
And things like temperature as well.

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:27.660
Unfortunately, those kinds of scales just aren't available

01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:30.140
for academic achievement, except for in really rare cases.

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.940
So for example, for really young students,

01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:36.180
if we want to know how many of the letters of the alphabet

01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:39.500
the student recognizes, we can go zero to 26,

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.300
or zero to 52, depending on

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.540
inclusive upper.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.900
But it's kind of an exception in education.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:57.420
We tend to measure things that we can't necessarily see.

01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:00.500
And we have to use special models

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.980
to be able to measure those kinds of things.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:02.940
Next slide, please.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.100
So essentially what we end up doing

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:10.660
measuring academic growth,

01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:12.700
except for in those very rare circumstances,

01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:15.420
is we use proxies for that.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:19.100
So those kinds of models do not necessarily assume

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.020
the same scale over time.

01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:24.500
And that's important because we know that the meaning

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:27.380
of achievement scales change across grades.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.420
It's not the same scale.

01:13:29.420 --> 01:13:33.820
We can approximate how students are growing

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:36.300
across these different pieces.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:41.100
So that's why it's important that we have these proxies

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:46.100
so that we don't treat our academic achievement scales

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.620
as if they were pure scales,

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:53.620
where you can just measure across very wide distributions

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:58.420
or very wide ranges of achievement,

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:01.980
unlike what you can do with height,

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:04.140
weight and temperature and so on.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.700
And it does require multiple measures for each student.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:12.700
And so what we do in the absence of those prerequisites

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.140
for measuring true growth,

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:19.140
we apply statistical models to the data that we have

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:22.740
so that we can approximate that kind of true growth.

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:23.660
Next slide, please.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:32.340
So this is a kind of a big challenge

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.500
issue that has come up in every state

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:40.140
that I have worked with around growth models.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:45.740
It's important to become clear on what growth model can do

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:49.660
and what it can't do.

01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.820
Kind of in broad strokes,

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:53.340
what it can do is it can give proximate measures

01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.620
of the degree to which students kept up

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:57.180
with the increasing complexity

01:14:57.180 --> 01:14:59.020
of content standards across grades.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:03.300
And you kind of just think of this in general,

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.420
the complexity, for example,

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.020
of a third grade mathematics test

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:11.940
and the breadth of what it covers is very different

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.060
than what you would see, for example,

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.580
on a sixth grade test or an eighth grade test.

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.780
And in particular, you can kind of think about

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.940
one of the places where you have

01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:23.460
one of these biggest transitions in mathematics

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.900
is moving from kind of the basic underlying parts

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:31.900
of mathematics to, for example, algebra.

01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:36.460
When there's a switch to algebraic representations

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:39.020
and so on, that's a really different thing

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:40.620
that we're measuring now,

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.340
but it does build on those others, right?

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.540
So what it can do is take proximate measures

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.340
of the degree to which students kept up

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.700
with the increasing complexity

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.100
of those content standards across grade.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:53.740
So it can do that.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:58.100
It can give group level measures of that same thing,

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.860
how well the individual groups kept up

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.020
with those same increasingly complex standards.

01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.420
And it can also give us information

01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.980
about group level learnings

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:09.820
so that we can engage in policy evaluation,

01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:13.660
program evaluation and interventions at a high level.

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.740
So it's one of the main purposes

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:19.020
of a state assessment to begin with

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:21.900
is it's intended to give information

01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.180
about student achievement

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.340
that can be used at a high level

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.620
by state board members or local district board members,

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:36.620
superintendents, anyone who is kind of developing

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:42.780
and evaluating programs, interventions, policies and so on.

01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:44.940
Next slide, please.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.260
So what a growth model can't do,

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.220
at least with our existing scales

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.260
is to give information on the specific knowledge,

01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.140
skills and abilities that have been gained

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:02.140
by specific students in a specific way.

01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:05.100
And the reason for that is that

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:08.780
on our statewide assessments and Smarter Balanced

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.820
and pretty much every other state assessment,

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:15.620
those are such broad measures.

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:20.620
They cover so much ground that it is difficult to say

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:23.300
that we can identify that a student has learned

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.540
this particular content standard

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.820
because we don't have enough items

01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.700
directed toward that content standard

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:34.500
and that content standard and we need more information

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.580
to be able to make the kinds of inferences

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.260
that we would want to make in terms of

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:43.380
what specifically is it that we can measure

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:44.540
with this growth model.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.620
It can't give information about why

01:17:49.620 --> 01:17:51.740
that degree of growth has occurred.

01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:56.700
One of the reasons for that is the gold standard in research

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:01.380
is to have kind of a randomized controlled trial

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:04.700
that we would see in something like medicine.

01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:07.420
And because we can't randomize

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:09.260
which students go to which schools

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:13.460
and we can't randomize which schools are in a given area.

01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:14.900
So we've got a lot of things

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.980
that we can't necessarily randomize.

01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:18.540
So that makes it more difficult

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:21.980
to make causal interpretations about,

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.300
okay, we saw this level of growth, but why?

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.060
It can't necessarily help us do that

01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:31.540
except with extreme precision and care

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.700
in designing a research study

01:18:34.700 --> 01:18:36.700
that can handle these kinds of data

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:40.020
called essentially a quasi-experimental study.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.820
And it requires some advanced statistical analyses

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:48.820
that take quite a while to develop and run.

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:53.580
So, at the high level, it's very difficult

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:57.020
to identify why something has happened.

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.180
And in particular, it's very difficult

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.380
to identify the causes of differences among groups.

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:05.300
That's, if we want to say why something happened,

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.620
we need to go more into the research space

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:12.100
and work with people who specialize in causal modeling

01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.020
or quasi-causal modeling from data

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.220
that don't come from our randomized control trial.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.660
Okay, next slide, please.

01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:27.260
So, selecting a measure of growth is, it's a hard thing.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:33.580
There are so many variations that can come into

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.180
this deliberation.

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:38.980
And I have had the opportunity to work

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.940
with a variety of states around this,

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.260
around this selection of a growth model.

01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:49.060
And so, you know, there is a white paper out there

01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:51.980
that, you know, I worked on this paper

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:56.460
to kind of guide states in making that decision

01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.420
that was kind of commissioned by Smarter Balanced

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:05.380
from a practitioner's guide to growth models.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:08.380
And this is Catherine Castellano and Andrew Ho,

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.700
who did this work some time ago.

01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.100
Andrew Ho is at Harvard,

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.900
and Catherine Castellano is also at ETS.

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:20.020
So, I developed a framework for understanding

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.140
and selecting a model or a growth measure

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.660
that underpins this work that was done

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.860
with the stakeholder feedback group.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.020
Next slide, please.

01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.460
So, if you look at this,

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.180
this was a framework that was developed.

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:38.340
It's kind of small,

01:20:39.300 --> 01:20:42.820
but essentially it walks through why do we wanna measure

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.220
growth in the first place?

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:45.780
What is our theory of action?

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:51.220
What's the purpose that we want to use this for,

01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:54.260
and how can we get to the kind of outcomes

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:58.180
that we want to have when we go through that process

01:20:58.180 --> 01:20:59.900
of selecting a growth measure?

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:05.820
So, that's kind of the first purpose of this framework

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:11.500
is making sure that we tie the uses and interpretation

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:16.500
to the way that model can be used to make interpretations.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:20.060
So, I'm not gonna go through the whole piece here,

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:22.500
but essentially we went through many of these parts

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.060
of the growth measure with California,

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:30.100
with the growth model stakeholder group.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.540
We didn't go through all of them,

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:34.620
and I learned a lot about how I could have modified this

01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:36.660
from what we did.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:41.140
But California is the first state that I have worked with.

01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:43.820
It has gone through this deliberate,

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:47.540
patient, and careful process

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.900
to identify what are the ways

01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:52.780
that growth models could be used,

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:56.580
and identifying a growth model that produces measures

01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:00.500
that can support that kind of use.

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.020
So, next slide, please.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:10.620
Okay, so this is about the work that's ongoing at ETS

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:12.780
on improving the stability

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:15.020
of these group level measures of growth.

01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:20.020
And this is done, led by J.R. Lockwood, who is on today,

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:26.020
and Katherine Castellana, who I just mentioned,

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.620
and Dan McCaffrey, who is also an ETS expert

01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:31.420
in measuring growth.

01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.260
Go ahead, please.

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.580
So, I just said the first part.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.700
So, what they are working on

01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.260
is an estimated best linear predictor model.

01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:44.340
And this is something that

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:51.820
comes from the classical statistical approaches,

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.580
and the purpose of this estimated

01:22:54.580 --> 01:22:56.540
best linear predictor model

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.340
is to improve accuracy of aggregated group level measures.

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.540
That's the primary purpose of the model.

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.020
And if you can go to the next slide, please.

01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:10.900
What's nice about that is that improving accuracy

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:13.260
can have a fortuitous side effect.

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:17.060
Essentially, we can reduce year-to-year fluctuations

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.100
in group level measures,

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:20.940
and the degree of reduction is related

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:23.500
to the number of students in a group,

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.900
such that reduction in that fluctuation

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.700
increases as group size decreases.

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:30.300
So, essentially, what that happens,

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:32.180
this nice side effect is that it means

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:34.380
that the degree of stabilization

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.300
is the greatest where it's most needed.

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:38.820
Next slide, please.

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:44.980
So, what is the EBLOP model?

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.180
The EBLOP model is not a growth model.

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:52.260
It does not change individual student growth measures

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.500
from the residual gains model.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.660
It doesn't produce growth measures.

01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.220
What it is is it's a statistical model

01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:01.900
that takes those growth measures

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:04.980
from the growth model, in this case,

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:06.980
a residual gains model,

01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:11.180
and it creates a more accurate or group level measure

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:15.020
from those inputs by going beyond simple averages

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.700
of individual student growth measures.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.740
Next slide, please.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:25.220
So, the EBLOP model improves aggregate measures

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:27.540
by incorporating individual student growth measures

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:28.820
from at least two school years.

01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:33.260
So, what that means is to gain a growth measure

01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:35.620
or to obtain a growth measure,

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.500
you have to have two measurement occasions.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.540
You have to have two times that they have taken,

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.740
the students have taken the assessment

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:45.860
in consecutive school years.

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:51.620
And so, what that means is that for the purposes

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:54.860
of this approach that is to be used

01:24:54.860 --> 01:24:57.620
or is likely to be used or intended to be used

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:02.620
for stabilizing results from the residual gains model,

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:07.700
it would take two years for the first measure

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.660
and another two years from the second measure,

01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:13.580
and that middle year often is what often overlaps

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:16.500
to constitute those two years of growth data.

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:22.500
So, what it does is it creates a weighted average

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.380
of student growth measures from multiple school years,

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:27.220
rather than just the simple average

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.980
in the current year.

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:32.540
And in calculating aggregate growth measures,

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:35.100
the EBLOP model gives greater weight to data

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.940
from the most recent school year,

01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:39.900
growth measure data from the most recent school year,

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:43.140
and less weight to data from the previous school year.

01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:48.140
So, what it does is that compared with simple averages,

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:52.340
the EBLOP model has the greatest impact for small groups

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:53.940
and almost no impact for large group,

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.300
and that's because the large group,

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.580
simple averages are already more accurate

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.820
and stable than for small groups.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:02.700
Go ahead, please.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:10.060
So, at this point, ETS is conducting an evaluation

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:13.900
of that EBLOP model using residual gains estimated

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.660
from the California data from the 2016-17 school year,

01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.100
2017-18 school year, and 2018-19 school years.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:26.180
And the results of that evaluation will be presented

01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:28.460
at the September 2020 meeting.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:33.460
And this is an important part of the process

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:40.980
to understand and evaluate how well this model is able

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:46.900
to stabilize the residual gains growth measures

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.580
from those three years.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:55.380
So, we can see what it looks like

01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:58.060
when these growth measures are provided.

01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.300
Great.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.460
And I think that is the end of my slides.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.540
That is, and so I'm gonna turn it back over

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.700
to President Darlene Hammond to allow for questions

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.260
from board members, clarifying questions

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.700
to our experts at ETS.

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.300
All right, are there any questions

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.940
that anyone has at this point?

01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:23.900
I know there's still a little bit more to the presentation.

01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.980
I'm not seeing anyone raising their hand.

01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:30.060
So, thank you very much, Joe.

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:31.460
It's nice to see you.

01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.500
Are you actually out there in the mountains

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.020
or is that just a backdrop?

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.980
That's a Michigan National Lakeshore.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:40.820
Lovely.

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:44.060
Nice to talk to you as well.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.660
Oh, and I do see some hands going up now.

01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:50.340
So, I'm gonna start with member Strauss

01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:53.780
and then member Patio Bronson, member Navo,

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.780
and member Pangolinan.

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.620
And then I'm just scrolling

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:01.540
to make sure I haven't missed anybody.

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.940
All right, Eileen, do you want to start us off?

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.780
Thanks.

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.620
First of all, Cindy and West Ed and the whole team

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.340
and Joe, thank you so much.

01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.900
We still have more presentations

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:14.740
so just so people realize we're not yet at the end.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:15.620
I know.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:16.460
Okay.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:18.260
So, Joe, I just have a question.

01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:21.500
We've been talking about, and I just need clarification

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.860
just because you had so many details

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.940
and I know you're trying to lay the foundation

01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:26.060
because we have new board members

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:28.380
and we've been talking about this for a long time.

01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:30.020
But would you clarify,

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:32.260
we've been talking about residual gain model.

01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.420
That's what we've been talking about.

01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:34.860
That's what we've narrowed down.

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.100
And now you've brought up

01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:39.220
the estimated best linear predictor model.

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:43.380
Is that a model that is part of the residual gain

01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:47.340
and provides for stability and less volatility

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:49.180
or is it a completely separate?

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:51.660
Could you just clarify the difference of the two?

01:28:52.540 --> 01:28:53.940
Sure.

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.940
The difference is that the residual gains model

01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:01.740
gives an estimate of individual student growth

01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:06.180
that can be aggregated for a specific group.

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:10.420
The EBWEP model is a model with a purpose

01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:14.260
of improving the accuracy of those group level results.

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:18.140
So it is layered on top of the regression,

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:21.620
the residual gains results.

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:26.620
So it takes the results from the residual gains model

01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:30.540
and it creates group level aggregate measures

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:34.460
that are more accurate using the EBWEP model.

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:36.660
So they're separate models.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.740
It does not change the nature

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.420
of the individual student growth measures.

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:44.620
It won't change them actually at all.

01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:45.820
The only thing that it does

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:48.260
is it creates a weighted average

01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:51.180
that is much more accurate than a,

01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:55.260
that is more accurate than a straight

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:58.700
or simple average of those.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:00.020
So it really is,

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:05.020
we're still on the residual growth model strategy

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.220
and this is really just a way to aggregate

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.980
the data that comes from that

01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:14.900
in a way that allows us to use multiple years of data,

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.380
giving more weight to the most recent year.

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.140
Kim, you're next.

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:25.980
I just had a quick clarifying question

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.620
on I think it was slide 14.

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:32.700
I believe it was Deb's presentation.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:35.540
So the last presentation actually.

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:38.220
And there was a bullet and I mentioned

01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:42.260
that I think that there was a 2016 decision

01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:46.540
to not include student demographics in the modeling.

01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:51.020
And I just wonder if you could describe the background

01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:55.940
for that decision and how that affects the model.

01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:05.300
So there was a conversation at the board

01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:07.820
with some of the criteria that they wanted to see

01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:09.500
in a growth model.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:14.500
And it was actually presented by our colleagues

01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:17.060
in the assessment division.

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:20.340
And based on those conversations,

01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.380
it was clear that they didn't wanna put student demographics

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:24.820
into the model.

01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:27.980
A lot of states do put student demographics in a model.

01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:32.540
And basically what that does is when you do that,

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.500
you're setting lower expectations for student groups

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.780
that traditionally are underperforming

01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:43.020
because you're setting a different expectation for growth

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:44.740
based on the prior.

01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:48.780
And the state board felt that that wasn't appropriate.

01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.220
They felt that they wanted all students

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.380
to the same expectation for all students

01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:55.380
in regards to growth.

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.860
And of course, when you have a residual gain model,

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.620
the expectations are based on prior year test scores.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.540
So there is some slight adjustments

01:32:04.540 --> 01:32:06.740
about the expectations for students

01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.420
that are performing lower in one year

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.020
than higher in another year,

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:11.980
but it's based on prior test scores

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:14.980
and not on the fact that they're not on the race

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.660
or their program status.

01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.740
And I will also just note that many states

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:25.220
do not use the demographics in a model as well.

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:30.220
It's a wide distribution of practices out there

01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:31.460
among the states.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.820
But this is kind of just purely saying,

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:35.260
where were you in time one

01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.940
and where was the student in time two

01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:42.140
and how much growth is essentially the theory of the model

01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:43.940
that we're currently looking at.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.860
Kim, did you wanna follow up on that at all or are you good?

01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:52.580
Sorry, I just wanna make sure

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:54.300
I'm understanding it correctly.

01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.300
So I get the idea of not wanting to set lower expectations

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:02.540
based on the most immediate year,

01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:07.300
but we'll still have data to show obviously

01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.220
sort of who's hitting standards.

01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.220
Oh yeah, we will still be able to disaggregate the data.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.540
We simply wouldn't be adjusting the growth

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:19.660
based on demographic considerations.

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:23.060
Okay, so in terms of the bird's eye view,

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.260
we still have the disaggregated data,

01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:26.900
but we're not setting targets

01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:30.620
based on the disaggregated data, is that right?

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.220
It doesn't have to do with the targets.

01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:35.940
It has to do with how you get the growth metric.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.820
So if you include demographics in the model,

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:45.140
it's basically saying that you're controlling

01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:49.700
for the economic status or disability status

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.740
or language status or racial or ethnic category

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:56.620
of a student and the expected growth becomes,

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:58.460
is changed by that.

01:33:58.460 --> 01:33:59.580
Yeah, sure.

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.500
And what the board previously said

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:05.300
is we're not going to make different expectations,

01:34:05.300 --> 01:34:06.900
but once you've got the growth measure,

01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:10.820
you can still set targets from year to year,

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:12.980
or you can disaggregate by any group

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.940
that you want to disaggregate by.

01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.380
Okay, that latter part is very helpful, thank you.

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:24.700
Brenna, and then I have member Glover Woods in the queue.

01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.340
Linda, we also have Ting

01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:29.900
who would like to ask a question.

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:31.220
Okay, great.

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:33.740
So I have a clarifying question.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:38.380
I believe it was on slide 23 and 24.

01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:48.980
So I was a little bit confused about the last bullet point

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.540
and I'd like to ask some clarifying questions

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:55.660
just in regards to the statement that it says

01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.140
it can help evaluate policies, programs

01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:00.780
and interventions, however, at the next slide,

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:04.780
it says it can't tell what is causing the growth.

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:07.500
So what's the difference between those two

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:10.140
just for a little clarification?

01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:14.020
Oops, you're muted.

01:35:14.020 --> 01:35:16.620
Joseph, would you like to take that question, please?

01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.300
Sure, sure.

01:35:18.300 --> 01:35:22.260
The difference there is that program evaluation

01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:27.260
does not necessarily try to look at these kinds of gains

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:33.180
as particularly causal.

01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:34.940
So essentially what we are doing

01:35:34.940 --> 01:35:39.260
when we do that kind of program evaluation

01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:43.780
or policy evaluation work is to look at something

01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:46.820
along the lines of, okay, here we had,

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.300
this is what the kind of the baseline achievement was,

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.740
the baseline growth levels

01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:55.860
before we put this particular piece into play.

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:57.580
We put this policy in place,

01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.220
we put this program in place,

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.100
we decided on an intervention and so on.

01:36:03.100 --> 01:36:06.060
And so what we would typically do

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.700
is we would try to do as much as we can

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:15.020
to reduce any problems in the study design

01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:18.980
or to reduce any issues that could be introduced

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:24.420
by not having a randomized control trial.

01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:27.540
So essentially what we're saying is

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.300
when we put this into place, we should see X,

01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:31.940
we should see an increase in achievement

01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.700
or we should see growth get higher.

01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:38.740
And that actually does take out one of the big things

01:36:38.740 --> 01:36:43.020
that can happen with quasi causal modeling

01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:45.660
is you actually have a point in time

01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:48.780
where you can kind of say, let's break it right here.

01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:51.700
And we can look at what was happening

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.180
before we put that into place,

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:56.380
we can look at what happened after we put it in place

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.980
and we can compare it with prior years

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.780
where we had no change at a given point in time.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.780
So we're eliminating one of those pieces

01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:07.100
that is a problem.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.980
We can actually identify a place

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:11.340
where we have interrupted that time series,

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:14.020
essentially interrupted time series design

01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.500
where we know what happened before,

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:17.340
we can kind of follow it over time.

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:21.420
Afterward, we can see how that changed.

01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:26.020
And depending on how much people work

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.700
to reduce the other problems that we have with the design,

01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:31.620
we can be more confident in it.

01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:34.980
We can't ever get to perfect certainty on that

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.380
because we didn't have a randomized control trial.

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:40.900
But if we put in the effort,

01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.900
we can reduce much of the issues that we're seeing

01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:48.780
not get rid of them, but we can reduce the issues

01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.620
that non-randomized control trials.

01:37:52.260 --> 01:37:53.100
True.

01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.500
Okay.

01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.460
You good with that?

01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:02.580
Cynthia, you're next and then Ting and then Patricia.

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:05.380
Thank you.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.740
I had a question and this was probably for Joe

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:13.740
around the weighting of the data from the various years.

01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:18.020
My understanding, and if I'm incorrect, please correct me

01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:22.700
as that the use of the EBLIP really is gonna help

01:38:22.700 --> 01:38:24.420
to stabilize the data itself

01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:28.460
and the weighting of the data years will help.

01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:32.340
How will the weight be determined

01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:35.500
for each of the years of data that's being utilized?

01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.340
I'm gonna ask J.R. Lockwood to respond to this.

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:44.620
He's the developer of the EBLIP method, primary developer.

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.780
Hi, thanks for that question, Cynthia.

01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:49.860
That's a great question.

01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:52.820
So the method takes all of the growth data

01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.340
from the entire state for multiple years

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.900
and fits a statistical model to those data

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:04.780
that produces a set of weights or produces a method

01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:07.660
for producing weights for a given school

01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:12.220
that should produce a number that is as accurate as possible.

01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:15.140
Accurate means it should be as close to truth as possible.

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:20.140
So the weights for a given school will depend

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:25.220
on how many students are contributing

01:39:25.260 --> 01:39:28.940
to the growth measure for that school in various years,

01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:34.220
as well as some other statistical parameters

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:37.340
that are estimated using data from the entire state

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.580
and the weights are selected to try to make accuracy

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:41.860
as large as possible.

01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:44.820
I'm not sure that helps.

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:46.980
That helps a little bit.

01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:48.660
I'll keep listening.

01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:49.500
Thank you.

01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:53.220
Okay, Ting, I think you're next.

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:54.060
Thank you.

01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:57.940
And I just have a couple of comments and a question

01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:02.220
and it may be because we may have more of the presentation,

01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:05.780
but so as a person who've been pushing

01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:07.180
and pushing this growth model,

01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.740
I was very excited to see

01:40:08.740 --> 01:40:11.220
that we are still continuing to work on it

01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:14.620
and that the technical aspects of this is getting deeper

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:17.980
and that we are gaining a stakeholder input in this.

01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.020
And I appreciate the presentation outlining

01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:24.060
what we're looking at and what it can do

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:25.380
versus what it cannot do.

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:30.060
I think we really need to be very clear about that

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:33.220
going into this and since we're putting a lot of time,

01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:36.180
energy and effort and resources into it.

01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:38.700
I am concerned though, overall,

01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:42.100
that it feels like it's getting further and further away

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:45.940
from what we had wanted it to be.

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:49.020
And I was hoping more along the lines

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.540
of getting to more of that individual student growth

01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.380
and it's looking and sounding like

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:56.780
we're not able to do that.

01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.540
So that's one thing that maybe somebody can address.

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:03.140
And then the other one I ask is that

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.140
given that we don't have the 2020 testing

01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:11.420
and we come back in 2022 with the growth,

01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:15.460
how will we, I guess we're anticipating

01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:18.940
that there's going to be learning loss in this gap of time.

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.940
So what does that do to this model, growth model?

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.980
How accurately will it really be able to tell us

01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:30.900
what is happening given that we have this huge

01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:33.380
one year gap in scores?

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:38.060
So Ting, I would like to do your last question first

01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:41.180
if possible and ask JR if he'd be willing

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:43.660
to respond to that question about learning loss

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.900
and figuring that into the growth score.

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:52.820
Yes, so one of the things that I think would be reasonable

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:57.820
to do would be to use assessment data from the state

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:02.540
prior to the pandemic and then to look at the data

01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.860
and then starting again whenever testing resumes

01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:10.580
to try to estimate the potential learning loss

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:12.340
that has occurred.

01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:15.220
And I quickly jotted down some ideas yesterday

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:16.180
for how that could be done.

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.820
There's some well-established techniques

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:22.940
in the evaluation literature that can be used to do that.

01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:24.740
It would require a lot of planning

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:28.260
and there's no one right way.

01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:30.060
So a lot of different things would have to be looked at

01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:31.980
and you're kind of looking for a bunch of corroborating

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:34.020
evidence from different types of analyses.

01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:38.380
I think that that's a really important analysis to do

01:42:38.380 --> 01:42:40.620
would take a fair amount of time to plan

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:42.980
and to figure out which approaches might be most promising

01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.660
and feasible.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:47.140
We can do some of that, that's not we,

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:49.980
that can be done with data to some extent

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.340
that already exists because there are certain types

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:55.860
of these methods that the data that we already have

01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:58.180
could tell us something about the viability

01:42:58.220 --> 01:43:01.780
of those methods once we actually have post-pandemic data.

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:05.620
I can go into as deep a detail as you want.

01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:07.220
I shall stop now.

01:43:07.220 --> 01:43:08.740
I think you should stop now.

01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:13.780
I just, just a little flag, this item,

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:18.340
if we were on our schedule, we would finish by 11.

01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.660
So just want to keep our conversation moving

01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:25.180
and hopefully that's satisfying enough for the moment.

01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:28.460
Patricia, you're next.

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:30.500
I was at Darling-Hammond, we didn't respond

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.900
to member Ting's first part of her question

01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:34.860
about student growth scores. Oh, sorry, thank you.

01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:36.380
I didn't know if you wanted to take that

01:43:36.380 --> 01:43:38.180
or you want us to take that?

01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:39.300
No, no, go ahead, please.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:43.260
Okay, so I think member Sun,

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:48.260
this is something that has been at the heart of the confusion

01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:51.940
that while this is a student level growth model

01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:53.500
being used in the accountability system,

01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:56.980
we're looking at how schools and student groups

01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:00.540
as well as districts and student groups are doing.

01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.220
Students receive their student growth,

01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:06.380
their score reports on an annual basis

01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.060
and how this will be incorporated into those reports.

01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.100
I mean, currently they already are able to look

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:14.380
at multiple years of their assessment data

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.220
when they get their student growth scores.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:20.820
So rather their scores annually for assessments.

01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:22.700
But I know Malbang is on the line

01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:25.020
and she can speak to if there's anything specific

01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:29.060
around the student reports

01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:31.100
that come through the assessment division.

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:34.220
Okay, I guess what's the difference

01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:37.620
than we do already look at groups of students

01:44:37.620 --> 01:44:40.460
and their growth from, well, we look at grade levels

01:44:40.460 --> 01:44:42.100
from one year to another.

01:44:42.100 --> 01:44:44.500
I mean, I guess what does this do more

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:46.380
than what we currently have?

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.220
Okay.

01:44:51.100 --> 01:44:56.100
So what we have now is the change in distance to match.

01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:58.060
And that is just looking,

01:44:58.060 --> 01:45:01.500
it doesn't look at a cohort of students,

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.340
it just looks at the students that you have in the school

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:07.100
from one year to the next.

01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:09.060
So the growth model is actually looking

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:10.100
at a cohort of students,

01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:12.380
those students that have matched scores

01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.100
from one year to the next to determine growth.

01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.940
And that is something I think that all this,

01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.700
the board members and the stakeholder groups want it.

01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:23.660
Yeah.

01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:24.900
And if you think about it this way,

01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:27.780
there are some schools that have quite a bit of mobility.

01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:30.300
So the kids who are in the school,

01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:33.460
this year half of them weren't there last year,

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:36.900
for example, that's not uncommon in some communities.

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:39.220
So when you get two sets of scores,

01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:41.660
they're not for the same kids necessarily.

01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:43.780
Whereas the growth model allows you to say

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.780
for all the kids who were here last year

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.060
and are also here this year,

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:49.460
the kids we've got to teach all year long,

01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.540
how did they grow?

01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:53.220
And then that's really the conceptual difference

01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:55.540
in what we would be reporting.

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:59.340
Right now we have a sort of a progress score,

01:45:59.340 --> 01:46:00.340
but for each school,

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:03.220
but not a growth metric for the students.

01:46:03.220 --> 01:46:04.060
Yeah.

01:46:04.060 --> 01:46:06.180
But schools right now can do that.

01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:07.980
They can take data of students

01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.260
who were in fourth grade last year

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:11.740
and now are fifth graders

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:13.140
because they have the chance.

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.860
They can do that.

01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:17.300
We will make by doing this,

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:21.700
we would make what gets done at any level more accurate

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:23.060
by for example,

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:26.980
allowing more growth to be shown at the top end of the scale

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:29.540
and some of the other things that we talked about.

01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:31.180
And I see that as useful.

01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:33.860
I was hoping that we would get a little bit deeper

01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:37.020
into something that's actionable,

01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:40.460
more actionable on a student basis.

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:45.460
So that's my bit of disappointment in this model.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.100
But I understand technically how difficult it is to do.

01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:54.660
Well, and one of the things that can underlies the process

01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:57.140
that we've been going through over the many years

01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.540
that this has been on the table

01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:03.540
is that what you might do to satisfy some interests

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:06.060
in using the scores is different than what you would do

01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:07.340
to satisfy other interests.

01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.060
And as a state agency,

01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.940
our primary responsibility is for the reporting

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.540
of the system on an accountability level

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.300
in terms of, as Cindy said,

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:24.220
groups of students, programs, schools, districts.

01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:29.060
There are other technical issues that will arise

01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:31.380
if you started to try to do something

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:33.820
at the level of the classroom or the student.

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:38.820
And so I just think we can come back to some of that

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.740
if we need to.

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:43.980
Is there anything you wanted to add to that, Cindy or Jenny,

01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:48.860
before we go to Patricia and then back to your presentation?

01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.500
No, I think we're good.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.620
Okay, Patricia, you're next.

01:47:55.940 --> 01:47:57.260
Linda, she put her hand down,

01:47:57.260 --> 01:48:00.260
so I think she's no longer in the queue.

01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:02.660
Okay, great, maybe that question got answered.

01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:04.060
So please continue.

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:06.220
Great, so I'm gonna conclude this section

01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.860
of the discussion with an overview

01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:12.420
of our detailed timeline of action.

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.500
We started the presentation with action

01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:15.780
that you're gonna be taking,

01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:19.500
but I wanted to emphasize on this slide particularly

01:48:19.500 --> 01:48:22.500
that there are six different opportunities for input

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:25.180
from the public prior to a decision

01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:27.740
and approval of a growth model in November.

01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:32.180
So just to walk through these so that you're left

01:48:32.220 --> 01:48:34.380
with sort of what's on our to-do list

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:36.220
from the Department of Education,

01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:38.820
working with our technical experts at ETS.

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:43.140
As ETS will be concluding their report

01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:45.340
to present to our technical design group,

01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:47.020
and I realize that our new board members

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.940
may not be familiar with this group,

01:48:48.940 --> 01:48:53.020
it is an advisory group to the Department of Education

01:48:56.300 --> 01:49:00.300
that is staffed by technical experts in the field

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.900
from major institutions in California,

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.820
as well as experts from school districts,

01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:10.420
and so we do have a nice representation

01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.860
from school districts.

01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:12.940
We will then go before

01:49:12.940 --> 01:49:15.940
the California Practitioners Advisory Group,

01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.380
which is on here, the acronym is CPEG,

01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:19.540
and that is an advisory group

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:20.940
to the State Board of Education

01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:24.340
that is required under the Every Student Succeeds Act,

01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:28.940
the federal law around education and accountability,

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:32.580
and we'll take that to their meeting in August.

01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:35.860
We follow those meetings up with what we call

01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:38.820
our Local Control Funding Formula Stakeholder Meeting,

01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:40.980
and we'll use that opportunity,

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:43.660
which we did in the prior meeting this year,

01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:44.780
to respond to questions

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:47.340
that the stakeholders may have about the presentation,

01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.220
and this will give them an opportunity

01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:51.060
to ask clarifying questions

01:49:51.060 --> 01:49:52.660
and really have it be a dialogue.

01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:56.860
ETS will continue to conduct additional technical work

01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.620
on the growth model as needed

01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:01.940
and requested by the technical design group,

01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.580
so that by the time we come to the board in September,

01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:08.220
we'll have preliminary results of the data,

01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:10.540
so of the methodology as compared

01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.580
to the prior residual gain model

01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:16.620
that we presented to you back in July of 2018,

01:50:16.620 --> 01:50:18.140
and we will be seeking, again,

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.180
direction on which model to pursue,

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.420
so within the residual gain model

01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:24.220
and the EBLIP methodology.

01:50:25.180 --> 01:50:29.780
October will be another technical design group meeting

01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:34.460
of the discussion of that final ETS report,

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:38.260
again, with the intent of the board

01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:41.420
providing us further direction in September.

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:45.140
We will put forward to you an information memorandum

01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:48.180
with that report, so it'll be publicly available then,

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.060
and then we'll go again to the CPAG group,

01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:53.980
to that group that advises you on this,

01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.940
and then to present information on the growth model,

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:59.900
we'll have an additional LCFF stakeholder meeting,

01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:01.780
and then we'll bring forward to you

01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:05.220
a recommendation for action in November.

01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:08.620
During this time, as we're getting the results

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.580
and the preliminary results of this data

01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:14.380
and the final report is delivered to us from ETS,

01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:17.300
we will be working on what a report looks like,

01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:20.020
and so because this is not being used

01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:22.100
for high-stakes accountability at this time,

01:51:22.140 --> 01:51:24.100
we need to make this right,

01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:27.540
so we are in a continuous improvement system,

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:30.460
this is how the accountability system was designed

01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:35.140
back in 2016, and so December will be the first version

01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:37.020
of getting that data out, but I am confident

01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:40.260
that we'll be spending much of the winter and spring

01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:41.540
really trying to get it right,

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:44.300
and also trying to educate, again, the public

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:47.100
to Member Sun's comment about what this is

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:50.620
and what it's not, and how it can be used in districts,

01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:52.620
how it can be used at schools,

01:51:52.620 --> 01:51:54.060
and whether it's appropriate

01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.540
to use in individual classrooms.

01:51:56.540 --> 01:51:59.220
So with that, we did have a discussion,

01:51:59.220 --> 01:52:01.580
a couple of discussion questions,

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.940
and if this is okay, this would close out

01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:06.100
the growth model discussion,

01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:09.660
so the CDE would like the Educational Testing Services

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:12.260
to conduct data simulations to determine the impact

01:52:12.260 --> 01:52:14.940
of the EBLIP on the residual gain model

01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:17.260
and share the results at your September meeting,

01:52:17.260 --> 01:52:20.180
so are you supportive of moving forward with this option,

01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:21.580
and do you have any concerns

01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:23.420
with what we've presented to date?

01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:27.820
Thank you very much.

01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:29.540
I want to really recognize the staff.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:32.860
This has been a long journey for the staff,

01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:35.860
and they've done Yeoman's work,

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:37.380
both with the stakeholder groups

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.460
and with the technical advisory group and so on,

01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:42.900
so Cindy and your entire staff, thank you very much.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:47.380
Public comment slide needs to go.

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:52.500
And then I'm gonna get people queued up.

01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:55.460
There's a delay when people try to call in.

01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:58.420
Linda, we still, we're not done with this item yet

01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:01.580
for public comment, we still have more to go.

01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.540
I thought Cindy was closing us out.

01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.420
I'm sorry, we do have two parts to this slide,

01:53:05.420 --> 01:53:07.580
and the other was the update on the legislative action.

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.100
So if you'd like us to proceed on that,

01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:10.540
and we can come back to the discussion.

01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:11.540
Yeah, please do that.

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:12.380
Okay. Please do that.

01:53:12.380 --> 01:53:14.580
All right, so for this piece of the discussion,

01:53:14.620 --> 01:53:17.660
I have just a few slides that relate to the dashboard,

01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:19.660
and I'm gonna turn it over to my colleague,

01:53:19.660 --> 01:53:22.580
Lindsay Tonatori, to talk about the local control

01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.060
and accountability plan,

01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:27.300
and what was done under the trailer bill.

01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:30.580
So this past week,

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:33.420
the Governor Newsom signed trailer bill,

01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:36.420
rather trailer bill, or Senate Bill 98.

01:53:36.420 --> 01:53:38.300
And this has several references

01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:40.620
to the California school dashboard.

01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:43.180
The ones that I thought you would be most interested in

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:46.860
are really operationally what it means for us for fall.

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:48.460
So it prohibits the department

01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:50.740
from publishing the dashboard in 2020,

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.900
and from identifying local educational agencies

01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:56.420
in 2020, 2021 school year,

01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:58.780
or technical assistance or intervention process.

01:53:58.780 --> 01:54:01.100
So really, when we release the dashboard,

01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:02.620
it's typically in December,

01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:06.220
and so we would not release the dashboard

01:54:06.220 --> 01:54:09.060
with state or local indicators.

01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:12.260
We do, are anticipating to be able to release

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:15.100
school information on the dashboard this fall,

01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:17.820
so information about student enrollment,

01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:21.580
student group information, enrollment specifically.

01:54:21.580 --> 01:54:24.580
So you wouldn't see a skip in the year

01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:25.660
when you're looking at the dashboard,

01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:27.700
you just simply not see information

01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:29.940
on local or state indicators.

01:54:29.940 --> 01:54:32.820
This bill further directs that the department

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.740
for purposes of identifying local educational agencies

01:54:35.740 --> 01:54:40.060
for intervention or technical assistance a year from now,

01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:44.100
so December of 2021 to use performance data

01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:47.500
on the state and local indicators from December of 2019,

01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:49.100
which is change on the dashboard

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:52.500
looking at status for December, 2021.

01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:56.260
So we have a clear guidance from the legislature

01:54:56.260 --> 01:54:59.740
that we are going to use nonconsecutive years

01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:03.420
to create color on the dashboard for 2021.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:06.940
So the second slide I have related to the dashboard

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:10.820
is about the things that are related

01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:12.820
in absence of a dashboard,

01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:15.940
in which this legislation requires or rather directs

01:55:15.940 --> 01:55:18.940
the department to publish any valid and reliable data

01:55:18.940 --> 01:55:21.580
collected through our student level data system,

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.140
commonly known as CALPADS

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:26.660
or California Longitudinal People Achievement Data System

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:29.100
that would have been included in the 2020 dashboard

01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:33.460
on DataQuest, which is our publicly reporting site

01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:35.460
or by any other means.

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:36.300
And so some of the things

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:38.620
that we are talking about here in the department

01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:41.260
is being able to, of course,

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:44.180
produce graduation rates for this year,

01:55:44.180 --> 01:55:46.580
potentially a college career indicator,

01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:48.620
but just the status only.

01:55:48.620 --> 01:55:49.820
That would not be on the dashboard.

01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:52.020
It would be on a sister site.

01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:57.020
Things like truncated suspension rate.

01:55:57.020 --> 01:55:57.840
So those are the things

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:59.060
that we've been talking a lot about

01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.860
and we'll have more information for you

01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:06.100
as we actually start receiving that data

01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:08.380
and we close out our data collection,

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:10.780
which takes place at the end of each August.

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.220
So right now, districts are reporting to us

01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:17.040
the data that we would normally produce in the dashboard.

01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.300
During the summer, we have about a three,

01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:20.820
three and a half month window

01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:23.220
for districts to report that information to us.

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:26.180
And then finally, just in this ongoing theme

01:56:26.180 --> 01:56:30.980
of trying to align our systems,

01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:32.540
San Joaquin County Office of Education,

01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:34.500
who was our contractor for the dashboard,

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.420
this appropriates $450,000 to them

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:41.340
to support that integration of not only the dashboard,

01:56:41.340 --> 01:56:42.860
but the local control and accountability,

01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:44.740
electronic template system,

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.980
and the school accountability park card or the SART.

01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:50.340
And with that, I'm gonna turn it over to my colleague,

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.700
Lindsey Tonatori.

01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:53.540
Welcome.

01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.840
Good morning.

01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:02.120
President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Gregson,

01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:04.400
members of the board, new members of the board.

01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.000
My name is Lindsey Tonatori.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.800
I am the Director of the Student Achievement

01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:09.160
and Support Division,

01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.020
formerly known as the Improvement

01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.920
and Accountability Division here at CDE.

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:15.640
So prior to the holiday weekend,

01:57:15.640 --> 01:57:18.560
we sent out an information memorandum

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.160
regarding the learning continuity

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:23.600
and attendance plan requirements as laid out in SB98.

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:26.840
Today, I'm here to provide an overview of that memo,

01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:29.500
share our plan for collecting stakeholder input

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:30.880
while we develop the template

01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:33.580
for our learning continuity plans,

01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:36.240
and explain the three-pronged approach

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:38.360
that we are taking to support our LEAs

01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.640
through the development and implementation process

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:41.680
of these plans.

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.080
So as Cindy mentioned,

01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:46.640
the California School Dashboard shall not be published

01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:49.160
in December 2020 based on performance data

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:51.000
of state and local indicators.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.360
In addition to that,

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:56.060
Trailerville SB98 also waived the local control

01:57:56.060 --> 01:57:58.180
and accountability plan requirement

01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.740
for the 2020-21 school year.

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.860
SB98 also separated the development and adoption

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.940
of the budget overview for parents

01:58:07.940 --> 01:58:10.740
from the development of the LCAP.

01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:13.580
The budget overview for parents must be adopted still

01:58:13.580 --> 01:58:16.060
by December 15th of 2020,

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.320
and the requirements for a separate public hearing

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:21.600
and adoption at a public local governing board meeting

01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:25.600
are consistent with California Education Code 5206.4.1.

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:27.940
Still remain.

01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:37.060
So the biggest part of SB98 that I'm here to talk about

01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:41.740
is the establishment of Section 4.3.509 in Education Code,

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:42.580
which is, of course,

01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:45.140
the Learning Continuity and Attendance Plan.

01:58:45.140 --> 01:58:48.580
And though CDE, we love our acronyms,

01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:51.620
we are referring to the Learning Continuity

01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:54.620
and Attendance Plan as the Learning Continuity Plan

01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:57.740
and not the LCAP, because this is not an LCAP.

01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:58.940
It's very different.

01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:01.860
And so to make sure that we are all staying in our lanes

01:59:01.860 --> 01:59:04.380
and reminding ourselves, too,

01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.260
of the approach that's going to be required for this,

01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:09.940
we are referring to it as the Learning Continuity Plan.

01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:15.780
The Learning Continuity Plan also requires for the CDE

01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:18.340
under the leadership of our State Superintendent

01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:20.700
of Public Instruction in consultation

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:23.380
with the Executive Director of the State Board

01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:26.500
to create a template for LEAs to use

01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.700
on or before August 1st.

01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:33.780
The content that is to be included

01:59:33.780 --> 01:59:36.180
in the Learning Continuity Plan template

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:39.260
is very much prescribed through this legislation.

01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:42.180
And it is because this language is so prescriptive

01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:46.380
that we feel we are able to create a high-quality template

01:59:46.380 --> 01:59:48.780
that will be meaningful to our LEAs

01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:51.140
as they develop their plans and get them adopted

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.060
by their local governing boards

01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:55.620
by the September 30th deadline.

01:59:55.620 --> 01:59:57.180
In addition to following the statute

01:59:57.180 --> 01:59:58.140
to develop the template,

01:59:58.140 --> 02:00:00.620
we are also seeking stakeholder input.

02:00:00.620 --> 02:00:02.940
We have reunited the LCAP Advisory Committee

02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:05.540
who worked on the LCAP three-year template

02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:07.180
that was approved this past January

02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:09.620
and includes representatives from county offices

02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:14.420
of education, districts, charters, and advocacy groups.

02:00:14.420 --> 02:00:17.580
The CDE internal process is going on right now,

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.420
and we are also looking forward to the input

02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.180
that we will receive during an upcoming

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:26.180
stakeholder input session on Tuesday, July 14th at 11 a.m.

02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:28.620
If members of the public are unable

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:31.940
to attend the stakeholder input session on the 14th,

02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:33.340
but want to give feedback,

02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:37.060
they can do so by emailing our LCFF email box.

02:00:37.060 --> 02:00:39.900
The draft template will be posted on the CDE webpage

02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:44.220
and shared through our listservs by this Monday, July 13th.

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.740
We plan to collect written comments from the public

02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.180
between July 13th and July 19th,

02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:52.060
and these comments will inform the final versions

02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:54.380
of the draft template that we'll work on

02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:58.100
with close consultation with members of the state board staff

02:00:58.100 --> 02:00:59.940
before seeking our final approval.

02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:09.660
And so I wanted to, of course, all of this information

02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.020
is included in the memo sent out last week,

02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:15.500
but I wanted to highlight some of the requirement areas

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:18.580
that LEAs must follow as they develop their plans,

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:20.260
you know there are a lot of new areas

02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:23.060
that our LEAs are managing as they prepare

02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:26.060
to reopen schools safely in the fall.

02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:29.380
So the first is LEAs must hold

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:33.180
meaningful stakeholder engagement and adoption processes.

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.860
And so what that means is, again,

02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:39.260
to highlight parts from the memo,

02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:41.660
they must consult with teachers, parents,

02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:45.340
principals, administrators, other school personnel,

02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:48.020
other bargaining units and solicit recommendations

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:50.140
and comments of members of the public

02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:53.700
regarding specific actions and expenditures.

02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:55.540
Similar to the LCAP,

02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:58.420
LEAs must present their learning continuity plans

02:01:58.420 --> 02:02:00.380
to their parent advisory committee

02:02:00.380 --> 02:02:03.420
and English learner advisory committees.

02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.660
Throughout the plan development

02:02:04.660 --> 02:02:06.820
and stakeholder feedback process,

02:02:06.820 --> 02:02:09.780
LEAs must provide for remote participation

02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:11.020
in public hearings.

02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:14.180
The learning continuity plan

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:17.380
also has specific adoption requirements,

02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.300
which include one public hearing for review and comment

02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.580
and a separate public meeting after,

02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:24.580
but not on the same day as the public hearing

02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.820
to adopt the plan.

02:02:27.020 --> 02:02:29.180
LEAs need to address what additional supports

02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:32.540
they are providing for peoples with unique needs,

02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:34.380
including English learners,

02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.780
peoples with exceptional needs

02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.740
served across the full continuum of placements,

02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:39.900
peoples in foster care

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.180
and peoples who are experiencing homelessness

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:45.620
during the period in which distance learning is provided.

02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:47.220
And the final area I want to highlight

02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:49.540
are the last few bullets on this slide,

02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:52.340
which are the content areas or the buckets

02:02:52.340 --> 02:02:55.620
that LEAs will address in their learning continuity plans.

02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:57.380
So again, to highlight information

02:02:57.380 --> 02:02:59.340
that is included in the memo,

02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:01.220
some of these buckets that we're thinking about

02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:03.380
are instructional offerings

02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:06.180
and specifically actions LEAs will take

02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:09.220
to offer classroom-based instruction whenever possible,

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:10.580
especially for students

02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:13.100
who have suffered significant learning loss

02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:16.220
or are at greater risk of experiencing learning loss.

02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:19.340
Thinking about student and staff,

02:03:19.340 --> 02:03:23.020
mental health and social and emotional wellbeing,

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:25.300
a description of how LEAs will monitor

02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:27.340
and support student mental health

02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:28.860
and social emotional wellbeing

02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:30.620
and the professional development

02:03:30.620 --> 02:03:32.680
and resources that will be provided.

02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:35.300
School nutrition,

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:39.300
this is specific to the continuation of meals

02:03:39.300 --> 02:03:40.780
for students who are eligible

02:03:40.780 --> 02:03:42.940
for free and reduced price meals

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.620
while they are participating in in-person instruction

02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.920
or distance learning.

02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:49.620
And also distance learning,

02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:52.620
so inclusive of plans for the multifaceted approach

02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:56.180
that it is going to take to focus on learning acceleration

02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.620
and ensure that all students have equitable access

02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:02.220
to instructional resources, technology and connectivity

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:04.460
so they can participate in distance learning.

02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.420
Finally, again, to reiterate,

02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:10.540
it's important to remember this plan is not no cap.

02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:11.540
And we've had to, again,

02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:14.140
we've had to remind ourselves of that many times.

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:16.260
So the approach and the process for the development

02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:18.060
is going to be very different.

02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:20.980
And therefore, we are working on multiple ways

02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:23.060
that we will support our LEAs

02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:25.580
through the development and implementation process

02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:27.160
of the continuity plans.

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:32.980
So first, we have a series of upcoming webinars coming.

02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:35.940
The next webinar is going to be this coming Tuesday

02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:37.700
on July 14th.

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:41.300
I mentioned earlier about stakeholder input.

02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:44.040
This webinar is going to be based on

02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:46.760
to walk through the draft template we have.

02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:48.720
We'll answer questions.

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:52.840
Participants can put questions and comments in the chat.

02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:55.020
All of those questions and comments will be taken

02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:58.600
and used to inform the next iteration of the draft.

02:04:58.600 --> 02:04:59.840
Additionally, again,

02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.800
if members of the public cannot attend

02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:05.280
this July 14th webinar,

02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:10.280
there will be opportunities for them to email the LCFF inbox

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.360
and also the template will be posted on our webpage.

02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:17.200
We also have several other webinars coming up.

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.000
The times and topics are posted, again,

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.240
at this link here shown on this slide,

02:05:22.240 --> 02:05:26.520
which is the CDE Tuesday at Two webinar webpage.

02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:30.500
And login information to access that will also be included.

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:38.160
So in addition to the webinars that CDE will host,

02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:40.960
we are also working across state agencies

02:05:40.960 --> 02:05:42.600
and with our partners in the field

02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:44.920
to support the development and implementation

02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:47.240
of the learning continuity plans.

02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:48.680
We have already had discussions

02:05:48.680 --> 02:05:51.280
and set wheels in motion to align efforts

02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:56.280
among CDE, CCEE, state board, and CSESA through CISC.

02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:58.700
And actually one of our new board members,

02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:01.040
board member Woods has been very instrumental

02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.800
in helping us to align these efforts.

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.920
So thank you for that.

02:06:04.800 --> 02:06:07.320
We see this work as having three big phases.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.000
So the first phase, of course,

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.420
being the development of the template,

02:06:11.420 --> 02:06:13.340
because of course the template will guide

02:06:13.340 --> 02:06:16.740
the way in which LEAs have their discussions about the plans.

02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:22.260
The second phase of this work is to cultivate tools

02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:24.080
and resources that already exist.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:26.540
We have a lot of high quality resources,

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:28.340
especially within the past few months

02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.860
that have been circulating around for the field.

02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:33.820
And we wanna make sure that we are pulling

02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.900
the resources together in a way that is feasible,

02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:40.740
digestible, manageable, and helpful to our LEAs.

02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:45.440
So CDE and CCEE will take the role of air traffic control

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:49.300
to coordinate these efforts amongst all of our state agencies

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:53.260
and county offices and educational organizations.

02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:56.020
Once we have the resources cultivated

02:06:56.020 --> 02:07:00.100
and put into forms that are basic slide decks,

02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:04.360
facilitation tools, and also indexes of resources,

02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:07.780
then we're going to really mobilize the system of support,

02:07:07.780 --> 02:07:10.400
asking all of our leads to take a role

02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:13.400
in becoming comfortable with these resources

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:17.440
so that they can help all of their LEAs have conversations

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.560
and think about how they're going to use these resources

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:23.200
in the planning and development of their plans.

02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:27.440
The main goal of all of this work, of course,

02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:31.280
is to provide ongoing targeted support

02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:34.000
for the process for the continuity plans

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.280
so that we can meet the needs of our LEAs,

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.160
take some a little stress and anxiety off of their plates

02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:42.320
so they can focus on responding to the needs

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:43.960
of their communities, schools,

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:46.360
and most importantly, their students and families.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.240
So with that, I will turn it over back

02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:51.540
over to my colleague Cindy.

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.440
President Darling-Hammond,

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.080
this does conclude our presentation.

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:02.200
And the next slide has a public comment,

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:05.120
so I don't know where you want to start today.

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:07.460
That's great, let's go to that slide.

02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:12.860
I know there is a lag for people

02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:15.340
who are doing the live stream

02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.740
to see that we're ready for them to call in.

02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:22.940
We want to open the phone line for the public comment queue.

02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:25.340
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

02:08:25.340 --> 02:08:28.140
on this item may do so by calling the number

02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:33.020
that is listed here, 712-432-0075,

02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:37.220
entering the access code 651905 out.

02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:39.900
And then you wait for the operator prompt

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:44.740
to press star six and then another prompt

02:08:44.740 --> 02:08:46.620
to press one to enter the queue.

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:49.420
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in,

02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:51.500
I want to ask Eileen Strauss

02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:53.400
as one of our accountability liaisons,

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:55.380
if she has any initial comments,

02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:57.180
then I'll ask board members

02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:01.000
if they have any other clarifying questions,

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.860
but we want to get to the public comment

02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:04.900
and then return to board members

02:09:04.940 --> 02:09:08.020
for any further discussion.

02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:11.940
Well, I'll start with my initial comments

02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:14.500
and just thank member Ting Sung,

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.100
who's also our assessment liaison

02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.660
because I think it kind of combines

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:20.660
both issues at this point.

02:09:20.660 --> 02:09:23.500
First, I think the state board's taken a long time

02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.820
and a thoughtful process.

02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:27.900
I think we're very, very committed

02:09:27.900 --> 02:09:29.060
to having a growth model

02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:31.260
and I think we want to get it right.

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.700
I think we have a lot we can learn from other states

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:36.420
and in the process and I so appreciate the work

02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:39.220
of the CDE team and Wested,

02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.740
but ETS and running our modeling

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.400
and trying to make sure we get it right.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.840
I think the issues that were brought up

02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:48.100
in today's presentation about stability

02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:50.100
and to avoid volatility,

02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:51.420
I think are really important

02:09:51.420 --> 02:09:55.740
so that when we go for adoption in November,

02:09:55.740 --> 02:09:59.260
we actually have the best possible model

02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:01.980
to give us the right information.

02:10:01.980 --> 02:10:05.180
I also believe that the comment about communication

02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:07.420
so important that Cindy shared

02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:09.300
and what member Sung shared

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:10.540
that we need to talk to people

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.460
about what a growth model does,

02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:14.940
what it can do and what it can't do.

02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:16.780
And so I think we want to make sure

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:19.700
that we pay attention to the development

02:10:19.700 --> 02:10:22.060
of communication and tools

02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:26.060
so that people know what to do with this model as well.

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:28.380
I just really appreciated the stakeholder input.

02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:30.660
I think it helps to guide our work.

02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:33.180
I know we have an overwhelming commitment

02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:35.780
to see this through to adoption

02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:37.580
and our stakeholders have been very helpful

02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:41.100
and very clear about why we need to have a growth model

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:42.580
and why it's so important.

02:10:43.820 --> 02:10:48.820
And so I think I'll look forward to the update in September

02:10:50.020 --> 02:10:54.220
with the additional data runs that we're going to do

02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:57.460
and then also participating later

02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:59.700
after the public comment in our discussion today.

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:02.020
But I think just overall,

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.060
I believe that we are on the right track

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:07.020
and that we are intentional about getting this

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:09.620
as right as we can so that we adopt it

02:11:09.620 --> 02:11:13.180
as an effective tool for LEAs to use.

02:11:13.180 --> 02:11:14.020
Thank you.

02:11:15.020 --> 02:11:15.860
That's great.

02:11:15.860 --> 02:11:17.140
Thank you very much.

02:11:17.140 --> 02:11:19.820
And member Sun as assessment liaison,

02:11:19.820 --> 02:11:21.260
is there anything you want to add

02:11:21.260 --> 02:11:22.980
before we hear the public comment?

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:28.660
Nothing more to add to what member Strahl had just said.

02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:30.300
Okay, great.

02:11:30.300 --> 02:11:32.780
Hopefully now we have some folks queued up

02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:34.820
for public comment.

02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:37.460
We encourage you to please state your name

02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.580
and affiliation for the record.

02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:42.460
Please remember to turn down the speaker volume

02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:45.700
of your computers if you're following the live feed

02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:48.700
so that we don't hear both.

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.140
Speakers will be limited to one minute each.

02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:54.460
Do we have any public comment?

02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:57.580
Currently we have seven in the queue.

02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:58.420
Okay.

02:11:59.180 --> 02:12:00.020
Caller, you're unmuted.

02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:03.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:04.940
Your time starts now.

02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:12.380
Good morning, Marcia Zaragoza Diaz,

02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:15.860
representing California Association for Bilingual Education

02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:18.700
and the California Together Coalition.

02:12:18.700 --> 02:12:21.860
My comments are specific to the growth model.

02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:24.100
We are encouraged that work continues

02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:26.060
on the student growth model.

02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.460
However, there needs to be an opportunity

02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.980
for public and stakeholder input using real data

02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:34.260
and details on how different approaches

02:12:34.260 --> 02:12:38.180
to presenting and explaining the growth model

02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:39.900
might be considered.

02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:44.300
Currently, assessment results reports EL and RFIP

02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:46.740
in the last four years as one score.

02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:51.700
When the board releases the student growth data in December,

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:55.340
it is requested that the English learner growth data

02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:57.660
be disaggregated by English only

02:12:57.660 --> 02:13:01.460
and RFIPs classified in the last four years.

02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:03.780
Let us take the opportunity to do this

02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:06.660
in order to establish a growth model

02:13:06.660 --> 02:13:09.380
that will accurately show the growth

02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:11.180
of our English learners.

02:13:11.180 --> 02:13:12.020
Thank you.

02:13:14.260 --> 02:13:16.940
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:24.060
Hello, my name is Maria Arias

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:26.420
and I have my son, Samuel Arias,

02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:28.620
who wished to also give public comments,

02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:31.020
so I requested two minutes, please, thank you.

02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:38.060
Hello, my name is Samuel Arias.

02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:41.620
I am a 10-year-old student in fourth grade.

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:45.220
I need help in math and in reading.

02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.700
Montana Unified School District has filed due process

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:52.220
against me not to provide services.

02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:54.860
Please help children like me and Nate.

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:56.380
Thank you for your support.

02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:02.380
Hello, this is Maria Arias, mother of Samuel Arias.

02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:04.820
I have three children with special needs.

02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:05.980
I'm a community member

02:14:05.980 --> 02:14:08.780
in the city of Fontana Unified School District.

02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:10.860
I've been battling with the school district

02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:13.700
for several years, approximately eight years.

02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.780
The school district has misused taxpayer funds

02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:19.180
to file against parents with special needs,

02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:21.780
especially during the pandemic.

02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:25.340
They filed against our family in April 1st, 2020,

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:29.140
and we wish accountability to ensure all cell buds

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:34.140
and school districts provide education, not litigation.

02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:35.660
Thank you so much for the opportunity

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:38.100
to provide comments for my son and myself.

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:41.340
Please help children in need in the city of Fontana

02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.420
and close by cities.

02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.260
Thank you.

02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:46.940
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:55.220
Shelly Coleman, your time starts now.

02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.060
Shelly Coleman.

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:11.500
Okay, we'll go to the next caller

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.300
and perhaps Shelly can call back in.

02:15:14.300 --> 02:15:16.220
Next caller, you're up.

02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:17.660
Next caller, you're up.

02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:19.220
Next caller, you're up.

02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:20.940
Shelly can call back in.

02:15:20.940 --> 02:15:23.420
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:28.820
I'm Leslie Lopez from EdVoice,

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:30.940
and we recommend the board direct the superintendent

02:15:30.940 --> 02:15:32.620
to establish a section for evidence

02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:35.420
of minimum daily instructional time by grade span

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:37.380
in the Learning Continuity Plan template

02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:40.020
and require districts to explicitly state

02:15:40.020 --> 02:15:42.460
what their minimum daily live interaction expectations

02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:43.300
will be.

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:44.780
Direct synchronous instructional time

02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:45.820
is critical to learning,

02:15:45.820 --> 02:15:47.700
and this spring it was both lacking

02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:48.860
and highly inequitable,

02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:51.500
and if it continues into 2020-21,

02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:52.860
we believe the state will be sanctioning

02:15:52.860 --> 02:15:55.860
new unconstitutional next year of opportunity

02:15:55.860 --> 02:15:57.420
on top of known achievement gaps

02:15:57.420 --> 02:16:01.740
and clear violation of but for the state of California in 1992.

02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:03.500
EdVoice also requests the board provide

02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:05.180
additional opportunity for public input

02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:07.180
before taking action to finalize

02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:08.900
the residual gain student growth model,

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:10.900
as we believe it is critical to receive

02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:14.500
broad stakeholder input prior to making key policy decisions.

02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:16.340
Also, we recommend the board direct staff

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:18.660
to evaluate the use of a two-year residual gain

02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:20.540
measure of growth that students have made

02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:23.380
from spring 2019 to spring 2021

02:16:23.380 --> 02:16:25.500
and allow for comparison to past groups.

02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:27.180
The value of the analysis would help the state

02:16:27.180 --> 02:16:29.700
and districts better understand overall learning loss

02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:31.220
and the loss that individual students

02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:32.860
and subgroups have experienced.

02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:33.700
Time.

02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:35.180
Low income English learners cost.

02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:36.180
Thank you so much.

02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.340
Next speaker, your time starts now.

02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:43.340
Good morning and welcome new board members.

02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:47.020
My name is Jessica Saco here on behalf of Children Now.

02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:52.020
SB 98 requires the learning content template

02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:55.180
to be developed by the state superintendent

02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:57.620
in consultation with the state board

02:16:57.620 --> 02:17:00.220
and includes the requirement that distance learning

02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:02.620
include daily live instruction.

02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:04.820
Consequently, we urge the board to consult

02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:06.780
with the superintendent to include

02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:09.780
specific requirements in the template

02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:12.100
that would require districts to define

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:16.100
what their minimum daily live interactions will be.

02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:17.700
Relative to the growth model,

02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:19.380
we're appreciative of the progress

02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:20.620
that has been made to date

02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:22.900
on the development of the growth model.

02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.220
We urge the board to direct CDE staff

02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:27.940
to explore ways to measure student learning loss

02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:31.700
as discussed by the ETS expert during the presentation.

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.940
In that expert, we encourage the board

02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:36.220
to direct CDE staff to explore ways to measure student learning

02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:39.700
loss as discussed by the ETS expert during the presentation.

02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:42.700
In that exploration, we encourage the evaluation

02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:45.460
of a two-year residual gain measure of growth

02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:50.140
that students may have made from spring 2019 to spring 2021

02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:52.620
and allow for a comparison to past growth

02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:54.820
over a similar time period.

02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.700
In conclusion, I refer you to our two letters

02:17:57.700 --> 02:18:00.740
that we are co-signatories on from the LCFF Equity Coalition

02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:01.860
and the Alliance for Students

02:18:02.100 --> 02:18:04.860
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:18:09.860 --> 02:18:11.380
Good morning, I'm Sarah Lilis,

02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:14.100
Executive Director of Teach Plus California.

02:18:14.100 --> 02:18:15.540
First, we'd like to associate ourselves

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:17.340
with a letter from the Equity Coalition,

02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:19.500
both on the growth model and on the request

02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.820
to put on September's agenda a discussion

02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:24.020
of the work plan of the state's effort

02:18:24.020 --> 02:18:26.820
to establish objective criteria for priority one,

02:18:26.820 --> 02:18:28.940
namely the teacher quality criteria.

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:32.380
We appreciate the work that the department staff is doing

02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:34.220
to respond quickly to the new requirements

02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.380
articulated in SB 98, particularly

02:18:36.380 --> 02:18:37.860
the learning continuity plan.

02:18:37.860 --> 02:18:41.140
Our teachers in reviewing the plan the draft plan

02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:42.740
template were pleased to see the focus

02:18:42.740 --> 02:18:45.580
on stakeholder engagement, especially including efforts

02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:47.740
to reach students, families, and other stakeholders

02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:49.660
that do not have internet or speak

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:51.380
languages other than English.

02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:53.300
They're also very pleased to see the focus

02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.980
on mental health and emotional well-being.

02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:57.940
As it relates to mental health and emotional well-being,

02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:00.100
we hope that the new plan template does not just ask

02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:02.740
for generalized information, but really frames details

02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.940
over how and who will support students

02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:07.860
and what follow-up and supports will be provided.

02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:09.420
Our teachers hope to continue to engage

02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:11.580
in the feedback process, but also wanted to elevate

02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.860
these issues with the state board as you advise

02:19:13.860 --> 02:19:15.740
the department staff on how to proceed.

02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:17.940
Thank you.

02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:20.100
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:19:20.100 --> 02:19:28.820
Madam President, members of the board,

02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:31.460
this is Brian Revis calling in on behalf

02:19:31.460 --> 02:19:33.220
of the Education Trust West.

02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:38.820
We have some concerns about the education trailer bill.

02:19:38.820 --> 02:19:41.180
Although it took some important steps forward

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:44.460
regarding distance learning, our interpretation

02:19:44.460 --> 02:19:46.900
is that the policy framework provided

02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:51.380
does not require any kind of minimum standard

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:54.020
for online or synchronous instruction,

02:19:54.620 --> 02:19:58.140
and we think that's a pretty big disconnect.

02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:01.620
We think students that receive synchronous instruction

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:07.020
are going to be advantaged quite a bit relative to their peers,

02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:10.980
and so we would ask that in your work on the template

02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:12.900
that you adopt a minimum standard

02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:16.180
for this type of instruction, and if that's not possible,

02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:19.340
we think there needs to be a lot of transparency

02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:22.420
so that families and communities know what they're receiving

02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:25.700
and they can advocate locally to get more

02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:28.220
of this type of instruction.

02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:31.060
Our fear is under the current framework,

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.900
low-income students and students of color

02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:34.740
will get a lot less. Thank you.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:38.660
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:46.420
Good morning, Chair Darling-Hammond

02:20:46.420 --> 02:20:48.940
and board members and superintendents.

02:20:48.940 --> 02:20:51.500
This is Lucy, I'm a public advocate,

02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:54.940
also a member of the LCFF Equity Coalition.

02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:57.780
I want to echo a lot of our colleagues

02:20:57.780 --> 02:20:59.980
from the coalition that have already spoken.

02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:05.780
We are in support of you directing staff

02:21:05.780 --> 02:21:08.140
to evaluate the use of a two-year

02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:10.460
residential gain measure of growth

02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:15.580
so that comparisons can be made from spring 2019

02:21:15.580 --> 02:21:17.700
to spring 2021.

02:21:17.700 --> 02:21:20.460
This will allow for comparison to past growth

02:21:20.980 --> 02:21:22.860
and will be an opportunity for districts

02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:25.260
to understand students' learning loss,

02:21:25.780 --> 02:21:27.860
especially for low-income English learners

02:21:27.860 --> 02:21:30.660
thought to be special education and racial

02:21:30.660 --> 02:21:31.940
and ethnic student groups.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:35.460
We appreciate very much the frank conversations

02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.580
we've had with staff regarding the board's

02:21:37.580 --> 02:21:40.900
obligation to create objective criteria

02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:44.420
for priority one teacher data to be included

02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:46.940
in the dashboard and the accountability system.

02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:50.900
This was a duty created in last year's education budget.

02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:52.100
Time.

02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:54.500
And we think it should be taken up in September.

02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:55.500
Thank you.

02:21:57.300 --> 02:21:59.460
Next caller, your time starts now.

02:21:59.460 --> 02:22:05.620
Hi this is Angela DeRamos.

02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:07.820
I'm representing California Teachers Association.

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.500
We appreciate all the hard work of the CDE

02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:12.860
on this growth model and we're honored to be

02:22:12.860 --> 02:22:14.940
included in the growth model stakeholder group.

02:22:15.500 --> 02:22:19.940
There's only been one meeting since the last May board

02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:22.980
update and so some of the concerns we have

02:22:22.980 --> 02:22:23.980
I'm going to bring up now.

02:22:24.620 --> 02:22:26.580
One is that only one of the methodologies

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.620
was presented to the stakeholder group.

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:30.940
There were others brought up but no discussion

02:22:30.940 --> 02:22:32.460
was held on those other models.

02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:35.300
And as previously mentioned no data runs

02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:37.300
were provided on the methodologies presented.

02:22:38.060 --> 02:22:40.980
Also there's been as previously mentioned

02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:44.020
there's no discussion about the implications

02:22:44.020 --> 02:22:45.860
of using the data from the previous year

02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:49.140
given our lockdown and limited data.

02:22:49.700 --> 02:22:54.500
So we are looking forward to having additional discussions

02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:57.500
on the use of the growth model and accountability systems.

02:22:57.540 --> 02:23:00.380
And I want to make sure that it isn't used for teacher

02:23:00.380 --> 02:23:02.940
evaluation purposes as laid out before. Thank you.

02:23:05.140 --> 02:23:07.220
Next speaker you're unmuted.

02:23:11.140 --> 02:23:12.380
Your time starts now.

02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:16.380
Hello this is Shelly Spiegel-Coleman.

02:23:16.380 --> 02:23:18.460
Sorry about the previous time.

02:23:18.460 --> 02:23:21.180
I got confused on which buttons to push

02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:23.860
but I'm here representing Californians together.

02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:27.380
I want to reinforce what Martha Zaragoza-Dia said

02:23:27.420 --> 02:23:33.140
and I also want to suggest that in September when data runs

02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:36.740
and information about the application of the EBLE

02:23:36.740 --> 02:23:38.740
are presented to the state board

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:41.940
that those runs show student subgroups

02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:44.980
that from the very beginning we start looking at the effects

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:50.460
of all the particulars of the RG model with the EBLE.

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:53.020
But we look at it not only for all students

02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:56.020
but for the student subgroups from the very beginning.

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:58.260
And we would hope at least for information

02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:00.060
that we're able to look at English

02:24:00.060 --> 02:24:03.140
the current English learners and RFEP students

02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:07.180
in those data runs to see what the implications are.

02:24:07.180 --> 02:24:09.820
And then I want to reinforce the suggestion

02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:13.420
from my other colleagues from the LCFF Equity Coalition

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:16.700
about the template at a minimum having district

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:19.060
report the amount of live interactive

02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:21.540
instructions that will be delivered

02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:26.500
if they cannot tell us what they're going to require

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:30.460
for a minimum at least report to us what is going to be delivered.

02:24:30.460 --> 02:24:32.740
Thank you very much.

02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:36.180
Susan Nisman you are not currently in the queue

02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:38.300
but I'm going to unmute your line

02:24:38.300 --> 02:24:41.100
if you'd like to provide public comment.

02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:44.980
Thank you.

02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:48.860
Susan Nisman will speak up and in agreement with our partners

02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:51.580
Ed Voice and others from the Alliance.

02:24:51.580 --> 02:24:54.940
Direct synchronistic institutional time is critical

02:24:54.940 --> 02:24:57.260
to learning and was both lacking and highly

02:24:57.260 --> 02:24:59.020
inequitable during the spring.

02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:01.740
A recent Speak Up Parents survey in Los Angeles shows

02:25:01.740 --> 02:25:05.260
that one in three students had contact with their teachers

02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:08.540
only once a week or less and only 40 percent

02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:11.700
of students received any daily live online instruction.

02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:14.540
African-American and Latino students were up to three

02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:16.940
times less likely to have participated in live

02:25:16.980 --> 02:25:19.700
classes at least once a week and up to seven

02:25:19.700 --> 02:25:22.220
times less likely to have interacted with teachers.

02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:26.060
We believe in whether distance learning or hybrid

02:25:26.060 --> 02:25:28.820
delivery approach we believe that the state must be clear

02:25:28.820 --> 02:25:31.660
on minimum standards for how much live and synchronistic

02:25:31.660 --> 02:25:35.100
instruction is required instead of delegating that decision

02:25:35.100 --> 02:25:37.060
entirely to the local level.

02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:39.780
We recommend that the board direct the SBI to include

02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:41.860
a statewide minimum requirement in the learning

02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:44.500
continuity plan template and that districts

02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:47.860
explicitly state what their minimum daily live

02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:49.820
and action expectations will be.

02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:50.820
Thank you very much.

02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:55.660
David Legstein you are currently not in the queue.

02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:58.300
I'm going to unmute your line if you'd like to provide

02:25:58.300 --> 02:25:59.300
public comment.

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:14.700
David would you like to provide public comment.

02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.020
Thank you.

02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:23.740
There are no further public comments.

02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:32.140
Okay given that there's no other public comment we're now

02:26:32.140 --> 02:26:33.620
open for board discussion.

02:26:34.620 --> 02:26:37.380
Board members please remember to raise your hand in the

02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:40.820
participant panel of the Zoom if you have a question or

02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:49.020
comment and when we're done with comment we will move

02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:54.340
to a break before we get to next item.

02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:59.940
I see Patricia Rucker Matthew Navo in the queue.

02:26:59.940 --> 02:27:01.780
And let me see if there's anyone else.

02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:03.900
So that will start with you Patricia.

02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:08.820
Okay so like all of my colleagues on the board I have

02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:12.620
been I have really been looking forward to and have

02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:15.900
appreciated the conversation presentations that have been

02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:18.220
made about the growth model.

02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:22.140
This is very technical stuff and I have to tell you up

02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:25.900
until today I thought I was following the conversation

02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:29.740
rather well because this is a register of English.

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:34.780
I do not speak and so it was very interesting to hear and I

02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:37.100
do appreciate Dr.

02:27:37.100 --> 02:27:41.340
Martino's explanation about the EBLIP because that did add

02:27:41.340 --> 02:27:43.940
some clarity to me and alleviate some of the

02:27:43.980 --> 02:27:50.340
concerns I have about the failing of the current model

02:27:50.340 --> 02:27:51.620
that we're following.

02:27:51.620 --> 02:27:56.340
My frustration is as the board member San has said is with each

02:27:56.340 --> 02:28:01.020
successive conversation and attempt by the staff to make

02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:05.340
the regression model work we are moving further and further

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:09.900
away from the intent behind the reasons why the board

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:13.500
originally had an interest in the regression model.

02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:19.500
So let me suggest that in going forward and I'm hearing

02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:22.780
clearly from the stakeholders there are multiple

02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:28.420
expectations about what this growth model is supposed to do

02:28:28.980 --> 02:28:32.700
and there is no consensus among the stakeholders about what

02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:36.380
they're expecting from the growth model yet when we

02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:39.620
finally get to the point when we are ready to start doing

02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:44.460
the data runs and even adding this growth model to the

02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:48.380
multiple metrics we have to give information about the

02:28:48.380 --> 02:28:51.740
system of instruction across districts in our state.

02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:57.220
People are going to be expecting this growth model to

02:28:57.220 --> 02:28:59.580
do things that Dr.

02:28:59.580 --> 02:29:03.700
Martino has clearly stated it cannot do.

02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:09.020
So I think that while we can congratulate ourselves for the

02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:13.380
amount of attention to the technical detail about what the

02:29:13.380 --> 02:29:17.620
growth model will do and about the fact that we are being

02:29:17.620 --> 02:29:22.060
thoughtful and being careful with the development and choice

02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:26.220
to choose to implement this growth model I think that what

02:29:26.220 --> 02:29:29.380
is clearly being shown is we're going to have to do a lot of

02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:33.020
educating with our stakeholder community not only about what

02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:36.380
the growth what California intends to use the growth model

02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:40.820
for but in choosing to use the growth model what the

02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:45.620
limitations may be but what the explicit and wonderful

02:29:45.620 --> 02:29:48.980
potential for what the growth model will do for school

02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:53.540
districts should be and so I appreciate the statisticians

02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:59.060
and their expertise on that but I think we're going to have

02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:02.540
to spend a little more time in conversation both as a board

02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:07.140
and with all policy makers to make sure that we remain in

02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:10.340
consensus on what we are hoping the growth model will

02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:16.420
accomplish and that that overall goal has not changed with

02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:19.300
and how the development of the growth model is going to work.

02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:25.900
Thank you member Navo and then I have member Patio Bronson

02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:28.740
and member Pangolinan in the queue.

02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:34.620
I couldn't agree with board member Rutgers more I think

02:30:34.620 --> 02:30:37.140
you hit it on the head in terms of educating and bringing

02:30:37.140 --> 02:30:40.340
consensus this conversation predates my time on the board

02:30:40.340 --> 02:30:42.700
but I do appreciate the conversation about moving to

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:45.940
the residual gain and I appreciate the EBLIP as it

02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:49.860
pertains to small school districts and stabilizing the

02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:52.260
results of the small school districts because of the small

02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:55.820
end size so I do appreciate that discussion and I under I know

02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:58.900
that we're trying to move efficiently and effectively

02:30:58.900 --> 02:31:01.300
through this so I'm going to change my questions in the

02:31:01.300 --> 02:31:04.780
comments board president just for things for the staff to

02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:07.500
think about as they move forward as opposed to me asking

02:31:07.500 --> 02:31:12.220
questions in relationship to what the last the last portion

02:31:12.220 --> 02:31:14.740
of the presentation I think we're going to have questions

02:31:14.740 --> 02:31:18.660
from the field around the technical assistance Cindy and

02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:22.180
how that affects the current county office relationship with

02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:26.140
current districts in technical assistance will those continue

02:31:26.140 --> 02:31:28.220
and because it sounds like they're going to continue for

02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:32.100
some time so there's going to be some questions there I think

02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:34.460
there's going to be questions Cindy about how the county

02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:37.500
office of Ed's special education schools and their

02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:41.220
classrooms are they responsible for continuity learning plan or

02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:44.900
is that embedded within the district's plan and last but not

02:31:44.900 --> 02:31:48.140
least I think there's going to be quite concern or many

02:31:48.140 --> 02:31:50.700
questions about the number of public hearings that are

02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:54.500
necessary to adopt the plan so if I understood it correctly I

02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:56.700
thought there were two which led me to believe there was a

02:31:56.700 --> 02:32:00.940
public hearing and then a board meeting for additional public

02:32:00.940 --> 02:32:04.300
hearing adoption I thought I heard there needed to be two

02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:07.500
public hearings and then an adoption which would mean that

02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:10.260
a district that has two board meetings a month would have to

02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.140
have their plan written stakeholder engagement done by

02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:17.180
September 4th minimum so I think there's going to be concern

02:32:17.180 --> 02:32:19.620
for the field with those and I'll leave it at that as opposed

02:32:19.620 --> 02:32:23.420
to dialogue a board president I appreciate that thank you very

02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:28.060
much our member Patel Bronson and then I see that member

02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:33.660
Glover Woods is also adding coming into the queue I wanted

02:32:33.660 --> 02:32:42.140
to address the memo from CDE on the upcoming template that I

02:32:42.140 --> 02:32:49.180
believe is going to be released on July 13th around what is

02:32:49.700 --> 02:32:53.460
the distance learning plan at the LEA level and I think

02:32:53.980 --> 02:32:58.820
there's maybe two things about structure of how it comes

02:32:58.820 --> 02:33:03.020
forward and as I understand it the template isn't coming to

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:07.460
the state board for approval before it goes to LEA's and so

02:33:07.460 --> 02:33:15.580
we don't have a formal vote to suggest one way or another but

02:33:15.580 --> 02:33:21.660
I do think it's important for us to actually found off on it

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:26.420
and make sure that some of the things that I think have been

02:33:26.420 --> 02:33:31.140
raised in public comment and also in the correspondence are

02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:36.420
lifted up which is that to the same extent that our LCAP has

02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:40.660
been I think moving in the direction consistently of trying

02:33:40.660 --> 02:33:43.020
to lift up where there are racial disparities where there

02:33:43.060 --> 02:33:48.540
are economic disparities, making sure that we don't have

02:33:49.020 --> 02:33:55.300
COVID and distance learning become not a space where

02:33:55.340 --> 02:34:01.420
education has been the backstop around disparities and has been

02:34:01.460 --> 02:34:04.660
or has had the potential to be the great equalizer in the face

02:34:04.660 --> 02:34:08.100
of great disparities but that COVID does not instead take on

02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:12.020
the role of exacerbator of racial disparities and

02:34:12.020 --> 02:34:17.060
educational outcomes. So I think continuing to track that

02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:21.940
very closely is going to be incredibly important and I think

02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:26.220
this issue of live and synchronous learning time is also

02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:31.180
a very important one. The statute and I want to thank the

02:34:31.180 --> 02:34:36.940
state board staff for walking us all through it but the statute

02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:43.380
does already provide a fair amount of direction and sets the

02:34:43.380 --> 02:34:50.220
expectation that it is minimally required that there should be a

02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:53.740
reporting requirement around live participation around people

02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:59.180
progress around synchronous learning time and so being clear

02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:04.860
that the statute actually says that already that there must be

02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:10.180
some reporting at the LEA level of what the expectations are and

02:35:10.180 --> 02:35:15.500
what if there's something that is locally bargained what those

02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:19.860
decisions are that have been made but I also think it

02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:26.380
certainly is very clear that what has made California schools

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:31.140
great is the teacher to child interaction right and that is

02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:36.020
the basis for learning and making sure that it is not just

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:40.620
you know a bunch of Khan Academy curated links is very important

02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:45.380
because our our kids are depending on talent that is only

02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:53.020
accessed through actual interaction. There's a quote

02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:57.620
from Supreme Court jurisprudence which is about this idea of an

02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:02.940
inexorable zero when zero is happening then you know it is a

02:36:03.100 --> 02:36:09.220
undeniable problem and in my own home county there have

02:36:09.220 --> 02:36:12.740
certainly been reports where some students haven't had any

02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:17.700
live interaction during the three months of the last school

02:36:17.700 --> 02:36:22.140
year and that needs to be something that the distance

02:36:22.140 --> 02:36:26.340
learning plan addresses and enables the support necessary

02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:29.060
for teachers to interact directly but to make sure that we

02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:34.020
are are providing the flashlight and the sunlight that data is

02:36:34.020 --> 02:36:37.420
supposed to provide to locals to actually be able to engage and

02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:39.820
say this is either happening or this is not.

02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:48.060
Thank you. It looks like member Pangolinan has come back into

02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:52.940
the queue. Are you? Yes. There you go. You're next and then

02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:57.500
member Glover Woods. I will also transfer my question into a

02:36:57.500 --> 02:37:00.940
comment but so to my understanding it seems that the

02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:04.980
process will end with a submission of the learning

02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:08.900
continuity plan and my only concern is that I hope that once

02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:13.660
those plans are submitted there is a way to provide support if

02:37:13.660 --> 02:37:17.660
we feel that those plans maybe aren't comprehensive enough so

02:37:17.660 --> 02:37:22.100
just moving past reading those plans and requiring those plans

02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:25.500
really being interactive to make sure that what districts are

02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:29.060
doing are really helping students just because I feel

02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:31.380
like we could get caught in a place where it's just a

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:34.340
requirement once again and we have to make sure that it's

02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:37.980
meaningful rather than just a requirement that districts have

02:37:37.980 --> 02:37:41.980
to do. Thank you. Member Glover Woods.

02:37:43.700 --> 02:37:47.540
Thank you. I'd like to make two comments on one based on the

02:37:47.540 --> 02:37:51.340
growth model and the other on the learning continuity plan as

02:37:51.340 --> 02:37:54.500
it relates to the growth model again kudos and much

02:37:54.500 --> 02:37:57.620
appreciation to the CDE staff for all that's been done over

02:37:57.620 --> 02:38:01.260
these last few years. I just wanted to take an opportunity

02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:06.660
to underscore how essential it is that the data is stabilized

02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:12.020
as I'm sure many of us know data drives a lot of what is done

02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:16.860
at the school level and at the LEA level. Plans are written

02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:20.740
the LCAP and others based upon what the data shows. So as

02:38:20.740 --> 02:38:24.420
there is opportunity for the data to become more and more

02:38:24.420 --> 02:38:28.100
stabilized the better the plans are and more importantly the

02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:31.420
implementation of those plans will be. So again I just

02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:36.180
continue for CDE staff to continue to look at that. I know

02:38:36.180 --> 02:38:39.660
the EBLIP which is the estimated best linear predictor

02:38:39.660 --> 02:38:43.380
methodology is one that seems to have the most promise in that

02:38:43.380 --> 02:38:47.220
data stabilization. Just to encourage you to continue to

02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:49.940
look at that and be sure that is going to be the best

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:54.780
methodology to be utilized with the residual growth model. My

02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:59.140
last comment is in relation to the learning continuity plan and

02:38:59.140 --> 02:39:03.780
again I really appreciate differentiating the local

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:07.820
control accountability plan or LCAP from this particular plan

02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:12.500
because they are not synonymous and intentionally not using

02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:15.900
LCAP as an acronym even though it's ironic that they really do

02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:23.340
have the same acronym is going to be very, very helpful. So as

02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:27.740
this plan in the template is being developed it is going to

02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:31.140
be important that the template is reflective of the

02:39:31.140 --> 02:39:36.580
information that needs to be known not only in the LEAs but

02:39:36.580 --> 02:39:42.020
also for the community and all of the stakeholders. Also I'm

02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:44.940
appreciative of the collaborative approach that is

02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:51.140
being taken with the state system of support through CCEE,

02:39:51.140 --> 02:39:57.860
CDE, CSESA and the state system of support leads and providing

02:39:57.860 --> 02:40:02.540
resources that are going to be needed. There's a lot to be done

02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:06.740
and I'll close with saying this. There's a lot to be done in the

02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:11.860
next 90 days. All of our schools and districts and LEAs and our

02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:16.700
charters are grappling with how to best reopen school within

02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:20.660
really the next few weeks with the pandemic that continues to

02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:25.100
shift from one way to the other. In addition to that, it's

02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:29.300
essential that the learning continuity plan is thoughtfully

02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:33.540
developed, that there is stakeholder engagement at all

02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:37.740
levels so that this plan is one that helps to really chart the

02:40:37.740 --> 02:40:41.980
path for what will take place in the 2021 school year. So there's

02:40:41.980 --> 02:40:47.020
a lot of work to be done and I'm very confident that LEAs across

02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:50.980
our state are grappling with all of these things and the more

02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:54.420
that we're able to, through the state system of support through

02:40:54.420 --> 02:40:57.660
our state agencies, provide a collaborative approach that

02:40:57.980 --> 02:41:02.260
offers resources and guidance, the better it's going to be for

02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:05.580
our students when they return to school for the 2021 school year.

02:41:06.580 --> 02:41:10.260
Thank you so much and I'll encourage you to put your hands

02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:14.260
down so I'll know when you raise them again later. And with that,

02:41:14.580 --> 02:41:20.500
I think we thank Cindy and her team for all of the good work and

02:41:20.500 --> 02:41:24.220
we will take a 10 minute break. I'd like to ask you to please

02:41:24.220 --> 02:41:27.980
turn off your microphones as well as your cameras and then

02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:31.780
turn your cameras back on and you come back in 10 minutes to

02:41:32.220 --> 02:41:36.940
reestablish the forum. It is 1120. I will look for you precisely

02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:39.220
at 1130. See you then.

02:41:42.660 --> 02:41:43.020
Here.

02:41:43.460 --> 02:41:44.580
Jim McQuillen.

02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:46.340
Here.

02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:47.620
Tim Sung.

02:41:48.740 --> 02:41:49.180
Here.

02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:50.700
Eileen Strauss.

02:41:51.300 --> 02:41:51.740
Here.

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:53.900
Linda Darling-Hammond.

02:41:54.620 --> 02:41:55.100
Here.

02:41:55.540 --> 02:41:57.020
Cynthia Glover-Woods.

02:41:58.460 --> 02:41:58.980
Here.

02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:00.620
Matt Navo.

02:42:01.980 --> 02:42:02.300
Here.

02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:04.420
Ade Rodriguez.

02:42:08.660 --> 02:42:09.740
Ade, you're muted.

02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:13.580
She's frozen.

02:42:14.220 --> 02:42:16.740
Oh yeah, her Wi-Fi froze.

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.060
Yeah.

02:42:17.260 --> 02:42:18.460
Ade, keep on mute.

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.340
Kim Patia-Bronson.

02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:21.900
Here.

02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:23.700
Okay, let's see if we can get...

02:42:24.620 --> 02:42:25.660
Ade, are you there?

02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:27.420
Yes, I'm here.

02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:29.540
Okay, everyone's present.

02:42:30.980 --> 02:42:31.620
Terrific.

02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:36.700
So agenda item three is a public hearing regarding the Arts

02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:40.740
Education Framework item. The item is presented by Shanine

02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:45.900
Coates of the CDE with guest presenters, IQC Chair Jose

02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:50.140
Inegas and Arts Subject Matter Committee Chair Julie

02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:55.180
Tonkovich and the CDE and the IQC recommend that the State

02:42:55.180 --> 02:42:59.100
Board hold a public hearing and adopt the Draft Arts Framework.

02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:07.500
I hereby open the public hearing at 11 33 a.m.

02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:08.860
and Shanine, you may begin.

02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:10.260
Thank you.

02:43:10.580 --> 02:43:13.260
Good morning, President Linda Darling-Hammond, members of

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:14.980
the board, Superintendent Thurman.

02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:18.940
As you know today, my name is Shanine Coates and I serve as

02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.100
the Executive Director of the Instructional Quality

02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:24.780
Commission. It's my honor and privilege to be in front of you

02:43:25.180 --> 02:43:28.940
to present the Arts Education Framework for California Public

02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:31.740
Schools Transitional Kindergarten through grade 12.

02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:36.220
Our recommended action today is that the State Board hold a

02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:39.460
public hearing and adopt the Draft Arts Framework, including

02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:42.580
the additional edits recommended by the Instructional Quality

02:43:42.580 --> 02:43:46.340
Commission on April 17th and authorize CDE staff to make any

02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:50.020
non-substantive technical edits necessary for publication.

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:55.620
Together, we will provide an overview of our process and

02:43:55.620 --> 02:43:57.180
highlights of the framework.

02:43:57.820 --> 02:44:01.700
We will start with a snapshot of where we have been and where we

02:44:01.700 --> 02:44:02.580
are going next.

02:44:02.940 --> 02:44:07.380
So Assembly Bills 2862 and 37 required the California

02:44:07.380 --> 02:44:12.620
Department of Education to revise the 2001 VAPA Visual and

02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:16.580
Performing Arts Standards and create new standards for media

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:21.340
arts. This began with focus groups in January 2017 and

02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:24.460
concluded with the State Board of Education adoption of the

02:44:24.460 --> 02:44:28.380
California Arts Standards on January 19th, 2019.

02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:32.460
The Arts Education Framework we present today is the second

02:44:32.460 --> 02:44:36.060
milestone of three in the VAPA revision project.

02:44:36.300 --> 02:44:40.020
New instructional materials are scheduled to come before the

02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:43.580
State Board of Education and Adoption in November of 2021.

02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:50.660
It may be useful before we delve into the arts framework itself

02:44:50.900 --> 02:44:53.700
to talk a little bit about standards, frameworks and

02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:56.380
instructional materials just to ground the conversation.

02:44:56.900 --> 02:44:58.180
I'll start with standards.

02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:01.100
Standards essentially are the what they're what we want

02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:05.420
students to know, understand and be able to do by the end of each

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:08.780
grade level and at the end of their transitional kindergarten

02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:10.380
through grade 12 experience.

02:45:10.620 --> 02:45:13.300
And for teachers, it is also the what for instruction.

02:45:13.620 --> 02:45:16.860
So we have standards in a variety of content areas.

02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:21.140
Once standards are adopted, it's important to help educators and

02:45:21.140 --> 02:45:24.940
administrators understand the standards and how to best provide

02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:26.780
instruction for each and every child.

02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:30.340
And we provide this through our curriculum frameworks.

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:34.620
Curriculum frameworks include guidance on how to deliver high

02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:37.780
quality instruction to each and every student.

02:45:38.980 --> 02:45:41.860
And then finally, after a curriculum framework is adopted,

02:45:42.140 --> 02:45:44.580
we move into the world of instructional materials.

02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:47.260
Instructional materials are the tools.

02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:52.780
They are tools to help that in the classroom instruction to meet the standards.

02:45:53.020 --> 02:45:56.820
Instructional materials come in different forms, such as textbooks,

02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:58.620
worksheets and digital formats.

02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:04.260
The state provides an initial review of kindergarten through eighth grade materials.

02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:10.340
And this review is based on alignment to the standards and content of the frameworks.

02:46:12.340 --> 02:46:17.100
So in summary, standards, curriculum frameworks and instructional materials

02:46:17.380 --> 02:46:21.780
are all key supports for high quality instruction for student success.

02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:28.660
Since the arts framework we will present today is meant to support the recently

02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:33.460
adopted arts standards, I'm going to provide a brief overview about

02:46:33.460 --> 02:46:35.860
what is new regarding these standards.

02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:43.340
The new arts standards articulate standards for media arts as a separate discipline.

02:46:43.620 --> 02:46:46.300
They are student centered, open and inquiry based.

02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:51.500
They focus on process and are organized by four artistic processes and they

02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:54.540
include three proficiency levels for high school.

02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:59.180
Commissioner Tonkovich is now going to elaborate on some of these points.

02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:03.380
Thank you, Executive Director Coats.

02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:07.340
The discipline of media arts has been around for a very long time.

02:47:07.340 --> 02:47:12.980
However, media arts is articulated as a separate discipline in the 2019 arts standards.

02:47:13.420 --> 02:47:17.540
The new standards emphasize process and provide general guidelines and benchmarks,

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:19.780
which can be adapted to specific media.

02:47:20.340 --> 02:47:24.100
They can be developed through and support learning in interdisciplinary contexts

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:28.940
such as STEAM. All of the arts disciplines may integrate aspects of media arts,

02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:32.740
but media arts can also be taught as a separate, discrete discipline.

02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:37.060
These new standards can help equip students to access the many opportunities

02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:38.780
in California's creative economy.

02:47:39.380 --> 02:47:43.380
Some applications of media arts include multimedia communication,

02:47:43.740 --> 02:47:48.140
interdisciplinary integration, design thinking, such as in STEM and STEAM

02:47:48.140 --> 02:47:50.300
learning and media and digital literacy.

02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:59.780
The 2019 arts standards include enduring understandings known as EUs

02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:04.780
and essential questions known as EQs that work together to support an inquiry

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:06.500
based approach to arts education.

02:48:07.020 --> 02:48:10.860
They state big ideas or important understandings, which is why they're worth

02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:12.660
studying in order to provoke inquiry.

02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:17.100
They also make connections to other disciplines within and beyond the arts.

02:48:19.700 --> 02:48:25.140
2019 arts standards focus on process and are organized by four artistic

02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:27.620
processes shared across the five disciplines.

02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:34.060
The four processes are creating, responding, connecting and performing

02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:38.260
for dance, theater and music, producing for media arts and presenting for

02:48:38.260 --> 02:48:45.340
visual arts. They focus on what students do rather than prescribe what teachers

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:47.940
teach and provide multiple entry points for learning.

02:48:48.660 --> 02:48:53.620
The increased focus on process embraces inclusion and social and emotional side

02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:57.140
of arts learning and the development of creative and resilient learners.

02:48:57.500 --> 02:49:02.580
It reduces emphasis on products such as gallery quality artwork and polished

02:49:02.580 --> 02:49:03.460
performances.

02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:10.180
The artistic processes are broken down.

02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:14.780
Could we go back to the last slide, please?

02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:17.820
Thank you, thank you.

02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:21.220
The artistic processes are broken down into process components in each

02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:26.500
discipline. For example, in media art shown here, the process of creating

02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:29.940
includes conceiving, constructing and developing.

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:33.420
When producing, students engage in integrating and practicing.

02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:36.300
When responding, they perceive, interpret and evaluate.

02:49:36.500 --> 02:49:39.020
When connecting, they synthesize and relate.

02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:46.540
The PK through 12 performance standards are discipline specific and measurable

02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:49.180
end of year, end of grade and course learning targets.

02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:52.620
They are also grade level and end of course outcomes.

02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:56.140
In terms of content, they are open rather than prescriptive.

02:49:56.780 --> 02:49:59.980
The high school proficiency levels are flexible enough to accommodate

02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:03.460
varying degrees of achievement by students during high school, including

02:50:03.460 --> 02:50:07.340
those who explore a wide range of artistic pursuits and experiences, as

02:50:07.340 --> 02:50:11.140
well as those who build on their PK eight foundation by pursuing deeper

02:50:11.140 --> 02:50:13.860
engagement in one or more of the arts disciplines.

02:50:15.980 --> 02:50:18.980
Here's an example of a media art standard for grade five.

02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:24.100
The artistic process is create, the process component is conceive.

02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:30.020
The enduring understanding is media arts, ideas, works and process.

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:33.340
The media arts, ideas, works and processes are shaped by the imagination,

02:50:33.340 --> 02:50:37.620
creative processes and by experiences both within and outside of the arts.

02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:42.700
The essential questions are how do media artists generate ideas and how can

02:50:42.700 --> 02:50:46.140
ideas for media arts productions be formed and developed to be effective

02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:49.460
and original? And the performance standard for students to reach by the

02:50:49.460 --> 02:50:54.060
end of grade five is envision original ideas and innovations for media

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:57.300
artworks using personal experiences and the work of others.

02:50:58.620 --> 02:51:02.300
Now I'll turn it back over to Executive Director Coates, who will

02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:04.020
overview the framework process.

02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:06.220
Thank you, Commissioner Tonkovich.

02:51:06.780 --> 02:51:12.780
CDE began the development of the arts framework in August 2018 by conducting

02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:18.060
focus groups with nearly 50 arts educators across California.

02:51:18.420 --> 02:51:23.740
We had support from San Diego, Santa Clara, Tulare, Humboldt and Siskiyou

02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:28.820
county offices of education who hosted the focus groups and supported this

02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:34.380
process to ensure the inclusion of urban, suburban and rural educator voices.

02:51:34.860 --> 02:51:39.660
We had representation of all five arts disciplines in the focus groups and

02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:42.260
educators from 35 school districts.

02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:47.460
Clear themes and points of agreement emerged in the focus group meetings and

02:51:47.460 --> 02:51:52.540
the input gathered became the foundation for the IQC recommended and state board

02:51:52.580 --> 02:51:54.540
of education adopted guidelines.

02:51:55.020 --> 02:51:59.580
During this time, we also recruited educators and content area experts for

02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:04.060
the curriculum framework and evaluation criteria committee, otherwise known as

02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:05.100
the CFCC.

02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:10.500
After the CFCC was appointed by the state board of education, they came together

02:52:10.500 --> 02:52:15.180
at six two day meetings where they discussed and made recommendations for

02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:17.460
revisions to the draft framework chapters.

02:52:18.100 --> 02:52:23.260
Each CFCC meeting was publicly noticed, open to the public with opportunities for

02:52:23.260 --> 02:52:26.980
the public to make comment during each meeting.

02:52:27.420 --> 02:52:32.020
During the entire process, we have had steady attention and participation from

02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:33.060
members of the public.

02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:38.820
We have also had steady attention and participation from the arts education

02:52:38.820 --> 02:52:44.100
organizations such as the California Music Educators Association, the

02:52:44.100 --> 02:52:48.820
California Educational Theater Association, the California Dance Education

02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:52.660
Association and the California Art Education Association.

02:52:53.220 --> 02:52:56.900
I would like to call out the California Music Educators Association's

02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:01.460
participation in the process because they were also very active in getting the

02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:05.220
legislation passed that led to the revision of the standards and framework.

02:53:05.860 --> 02:53:10.620
Once the CFCC completed their work, they forwarded their draft to the instructional

02:53:10.620 --> 02:53:12.540
quality commission known as the IQC.

02:53:12.980 --> 02:53:17.220
The IQC approved the framework for the first public comment review period.

02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:23.220
After the first public review period ended, the IQC reviewed all of the public

02:53:23.220 --> 02:53:27.660
comment, made its edits and its revisions and then placed the framework out for

02:53:27.660 --> 02:53:30.780
another 60 day public comment review period.

02:53:31.340 --> 02:53:36.300
After April 17th, 2020 meeting, the IQC made additional edits and revisions.

02:53:36.500 --> 02:53:38.260
And that brings us to today.

02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:42.340
I'd like to just take a moment to thank those that have been involved in this

02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:42.820
process.

02:53:43.380 --> 02:53:47.220
I'd like to start off by thanking Constantino Silva, Administrator of the

02:53:47.220 --> 02:53:50.980
Curriculum Frameworks Unit and Letty Strauss, Lead Consultant for the Arts

02:53:50.980 --> 02:53:51.540
Framework.

02:53:51.860 --> 02:53:57.060
I'd also like to acknowledge the lead writing team, Chris Alexander, Armelon

02:53:57.060 --> 02:54:01.380
De La O and Courtney Sawada, as well as the CFCC members.

02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:06.180
The primary writing team worked with the guidelines to produce drafts and then

02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:11.780
received feedback and requests and edits from the CFCC.

02:54:12.180 --> 02:54:17.420
The CFCC was comprised of many experts with all five disciplines represented

02:54:17.660 --> 02:54:21.860
dance, media arts, music, theater and visual arts.

02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:27.540
The CFCC included kindergarten through 12th grade teachers, university professors,

02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:31.460
a teaching artist, a museum educator and a librarian.

02:54:31.940 --> 02:54:37.220
Seven members of the CFCC had been on the 2019 Arts Standards Advisory

02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:37.700
Committee.

02:54:38.180 --> 02:54:42.500
The Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Committee even included two individuals

02:54:42.500 --> 02:54:46.180
who helped write these standards, the 2001 Arts Standards.

02:54:46.620 --> 02:54:50.180
They were a knowledgeable and thoughtful group and the writers were responsive to

02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:52.340
their feedback and requested edits.

02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:53.380
Thank you again.

02:54:56.540 --> 02:55:01.180
As mentioned previously, all of the CFCC meetings were open to the public and

02:55:01.180 --> 02:55:03.980
public comment has been welcome during this entire process.

02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:07.340
We had a dedicated email to receive that public comment.

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:10.900
There were two 60 day public comment and review periods.

02:55:11.260 --> 02:55:15.660
Most stakeholders who reviewed submitted comments based on their expertise.

02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:21.140
For example, music teachers tended to have a lot of to say about the music

02:55:21.140 --> 02:55:25.380
chapter. There was a good balance of affirmation and critique that overall

02:55:25.380 --> 02:55:28.420
helped condense, clarify and improve the document.

02:55:28.780 --> 02:55:33.540
We had a good balance of participation in public comment, including some of the

02:55:33.540 --> 02:55:38.940
SESSA Arts Initiative, regional arts leads and several university faculty who

02:55:38.940 --> 02:55:43.460
are also pre-service credential teachers, as well as members of the California

02:55:43.460 --> 02:55:45.260
Alliance for Arts Education.

02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:49.820
In response to the first round of public comment, the IQC requested that chapters

02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:51.420
four and eight be revised.

02:55:51.780 --> 02:55:55.540
They requested that chapter eight be revised again after the second round of

02:55:55.540 --> 02:55:56.260
public comment.

02:55:56.860 --> 02:56:00.620
Commissioner Iniguez will now share how the framework is organized and some of

02:56:00.620 --> 02:56:01.300
its highlights.

02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:02.180
Commissioner.

02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:08.020
Thank you, Executive Director Coates and good morning Superintendent Thurman,

02:56:08.020 --> 02:56:10.140
President Darlene Hammond and members of the board.

02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:14.580
As mentioned, my name is Jose Iniguez and as chair of the instructional quality

02:56:14.580 --> 02:56:19.340
commission, I'm excited to discuss the organization of the arts framework with

02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:19.820
you today.

02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:25.700
When developing the curriculum frameworks, the IQC carefully considers how best to

02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:26.780
support educators.

02:56:26.780 --> 02:56:31.220
For example, we consider how to support multiple subject educators, not just

02:56:31.220 --> 02:56:33.980
those who are content matter experts.

02:56:34.340 --> 02:56:38.460
We also consider other audiences, including parents, administrators,

02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:42.260
counselors, institutions of higher learning and publishers.

02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:46.900
I'd like to note that based on the development timeline, the framework does

02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:52.060
not explicitly address online learning strategies, something we know is highly

02:56:52.060 --> 02:56:54.140
sought after during these challenging times.

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:59.500
But based on the framework development process that began two years ago, there

02:56:59.500 --> 02:57:04.340
was no hint at that point of a pandemic necessitating increased learning online.

02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:08.500
Nonetheless, the framework is useful in this regard.

02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:14.140
For example, it includes pedagogical approaches such as universal design for

02:57:14.140 --> 02:57:18.940
learning or UDL that may be used to help design online learning experiences.

02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:24.180
With this in mind, the draft arts education framework is intended to help

02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:29.820
implement the 2019 California art standards in TK through 12th grade

02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:34.100
instruction and to provide guidance for developing the artistic voice of all the

02:57:34.100 --> 02:57:37.260
students while preparing them for college and career.

02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:43.180
The framework is composed of 10 chapters, as well as a guide to reading and using a

02:57:43.180 --> 02:57:47.740
framework and a set of appendices that include many useful resources.

02:57:48.660 --> 02:57:49.540
Next slide, please.

02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:52.060
Thank you.

02:57:54.580 --> 02:57:55.860
The guide to reading.

02:57:57.260 --> 02:57:58.180
I'm sorry here.

02:57:58.860 --> 02:57:59.140
Okay.

02:58:00.980 --> 02:58:04.940
I'm having a hard time balancing the outline here on zoom.

02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:05.580
Thank you very much.

02:58:05.580 --> 02:58:05.740
All right.

02:58:05.980 --> 02:58:10.540
The guide to reading and using the framework is a range of lists of the CCC and

02:58:10.540 --> 02:58:14.780
is intended to provide entry points for different users, as I've just mentioned.

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:19.060
Additionally, each chapter contains a short guide to reading and using the

02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:22.340
framework, including summary statements of that particular chapter.

02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:26.860
We hope the guide will increase the usefulness of the framework based on

02:58:26.900 --> 02:58:28.220
readers' backgrounds and needs.

02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:33.060
For example, an elementary teacher may look at the integration chapter and then

02:58:33.140 --> 02:58:36.660
at specific discipline chapters as they plan foundational arts learning

02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:40.260
experiences to build an integrated unit or lesson.

02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:45.100
Chapter one introduces the philosophical foundations of

02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:47.540
lifelong goals of the standards.

02:58:48.060 --> 02:58:54.020
It also articulates the intersection of social, emotional learning and arts

02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:56.620
learning, something that we know is important during these trying times.

02:58:57.020 --> 02:59:02.620
This chapter also introduces the national opportunity to learn criteria to assess

02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:08.020
and report whether students and teachers have the necessary resources for students

02:59:08.020 --> 02:59:09.420
to achieve the state standards.

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:11.660
I will address chapter two in the next slide.

02:59:11.660 --> 02:59:12.060
Thank you.

02:59:12.900 --> 02:59:17.460
Chapter two includes an explanation of the four artistic processes and the

02:59:17.460 --> 02:59:20.700
process components as explained by Commissioner Tarkovitch.

02:59:21.460 --> 02:59:25.420
It also elaborates on the arts standards, including learning targets

02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:27.580
and a focus on student inquiry.

02:59:28.220 --> 02:59:31.700
Given that high school students have different grade level entry points to art,

02:59:31.900 --> 02:59:35.380
this chapter also focuses on proficiency levels for high school.

02:59:36.380 --> 02:59:41.180
It also elaborates on inclusive practices for instruction, culturally and

02:59:41.180 --> 02:59:45.460
linguistically responsive teaching, and universal design for learning, as I've

02:59:45.460 --> 02:59:45.900
mentioned.

02:59:46.300 --> 02:59:47.020
Next slide, please.

02:59:47.020 --> 02:59:47.380
Thank you.

02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:54.340
As indicated by the titles, chapters three to seven are specific to each arts

02:59:54.380 --> 02:59:54.940
discipline.

02:59:55.460 --> 02:59:59.140
Each of these chapters provide a discipline specific overview of the

02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:04.220
standards by grade bands, TK through two, to second grade, I'm sorry, third

03:00:04.300 --> 03:00:08.140
grade through fifth grade, sixth grade through eighth grade and high school.

03:00:08.940 --> 03:00:13.780
Also within each discipline specific chapter, the framework elaborates on

03:00:13.940 --> 03:00:19.260
universal design for learning, culturally and linguistically responsive teaching,

03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:23.420
supporting students who are English learners, supporting students with

03:00:23.780 --> 03:00:28.220
disabilities and considerations for instruction in the discipline.

03:00:29.220 --> 03:00:34.540
A note about chapter four, public comment during our initial 60 day

03:00:34.540 --> 03:00:38.420
public review window indicated a need to tease out something Commissioner

03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:40.020
Tonkovich mentioned earlier.

03:00:40.580 --> 03:00:46.860
That is how media arts may be taught as a discrete discipline or by integrating

03:00:46.860 --> 03:00:51.180
it into the other arts discipline, prompting us to revise chapter four.

03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:53.260
Next slide, please.

03:00:53.700 --> 03:00:57.740
As mentioned by executive director Coates, we revised chapter eight twice.

03:00:57.860 --> 03:01:03.220
Once after each public comment period, after thoroughly considering public

03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:06.900
feedback, it became apparent that we needed to tease out the concept of

03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:12.180
co-equal arts integration for the idea that integrating art with non-art

03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:16.740
curriculum like math or science promotes higher level thinking skills such as

03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:19.700
problem solving or recognition of patterns.

03:01:19.740 --> 03:01:23.180
This chapter also includes a discussion of the differences in learning

03:01:23.180 --> 03:01:28.980
foci and outcomes of sequential discrete arts learning, arts integrated,

03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:32.100
and arts enhanced approaches.

03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:37.540
Finally, this chapter also includes models and examples of how arts teachers

03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:42.300
and non-art teachers might collaborate to plan for and implement integrated

03:01:42.300 --> 03:01:42.940
instruction.

03:01:44.620 --> 03:01:45.340
Next slide, please.

03:01:45.380 --> 03:01:45.860
Thank you.

03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:51.460
This quote or the quote on the slide is an excerpt from chapter nine.

03:01:51.700 --> 03:01:55.580
Chapter nine is intended to be used in conjunction with the discipline

03:01:55.580 --> 03:01:57.740
specific chapters, three through seven.

03:01:58.380 --> 03:02:02.300
This chapter elaborates on how to implement effective and equitable arts

03:02:02.300 --> 03:02:05.860
education, school and district wide programs.

03:02:06.260 --> 03:02:10.020
It also provides guidance on how to effectively monitor and assess arts

03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.180
education programs.

03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:16.100
And it provides guidance on planning and implementing arts education program

03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:21.260
professional learning, as well as engaging all stakeholders in leadership

03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:23.900
and advocacy for arts education.

03:02:25.380 --> 03:02:31.700
Chapter 10, as I mentioned, is meant for diverse audiences, including

03:02:31.700 --> 03:02:33.300
publishers and school districts.

03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:37.420
Chapter 10 outlines criteria to help guide and adopt a comprehensive

03:02:37.420 --> 03:02:41.620
The IQC is scheduled to review arts related instructional materials for

03:02:41.620 --> 03:02:46.540
grades K-8 in the fall of 2021, after which we will submit recommendations

03:02:46.540 --> 03:02:48.220
to you, the State Board of Education.

03:02:48.740 --> 03:02:52.460
That said, the criteria in this chapter is intended to serve as a guide for

03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:54.500
the adoption of instructional material.

03:02:55.220 --> 03:03:00.380
The appendices include links to a variety of important and useful resources.

03:03:00.820 --> 03:03:04.460
The IQC is intended to provide guidance on how to implement effective

03:03:04.700 --> 03:03:07.300
and equitable arts education programs.

03:03:09.020 --> 03:03:11.060
And with that said, thank you for your time.

03:03:11.100 --> 03:03:14.740
I will now turn over the presentation to our executive director, Kokes.

03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:16.340
Thank you so much.

03:03:16.980 --> 03:03:20.620
Now that you have some background on the standards and the content of the draft

03:03:20.620 --> 03:03:24.500
framework, which will support the implementation of the standards, let's

03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:29.940
talk quickly about what, what will happen if the board acts today to

03:03:29.940 --> 03:03:32.100
approve this framework.

03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:37.900
Legislation has scheduled a K-8 instructional materials adoption process

03:03:37.900 --> 03:03:43.020
pending State Board action and also pending State Board action, CDE would

03:03:43.020 --> 03:03:47.020
begin the, the editing and design of the arts education framework.

03:03:49.540 --> 03:03:53.660
This brings us, brings us back to the action recommended before you today.

03:03:54.380 --> 03:03:57.460
I am, we are available to answer any questions that you may have.

03:03:58.420 --> 03:04:01.300
Thank you so much for those excellent presentations.

03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:05.580
We'll now open the phone line for public comment queue.

03:04:05.620 --> 03:04:09.340
And there's the slide with all the directions.

03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:13.980
While we are waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask

03:04:13.980 --> 03:04:18.220
vice president Eileen Strauss as our arts curriculum liaison, if she has any

03:04:18.220 --> 03:04:23.340
initial comments, then if there are any clarifying questions from the board,

03:04:23.340 --> 03:04:25.780
we'll take those and then we'll get to public comments.

03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:28.780
Yeah.

03:04:28.780 --> 03:04:31.900
So thank you, president Darling-Hammond.

03:04:32.180 --> 03:04:35.380
So the visual and performing arts framework and the content standards

03:04:35.380 --> 03:04:39.980
and I believe evaluation criteria were originally the liaison role was

03:04:39.980 --> 03:04:42.580
Nikki Sandoval who finished her term in March.

03:04:42.580 --> 03:04:47.620
So I've been on liaison since Nikki completed her term.

03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:54.620
And I just want to highlight just a quote from chair Anikas is that, that

03:04:54.980 --> 03:04:58.780
Barbara Jordan said, which was the arts can lift us up and has the potential

03:04:58.780 --> 03:04:59.540
to unify.

03:04:59.780 --> 03:05:03.500
And I think that's been the feeling of this framework development.

03:05:03.700 --> 03:05:07.860
Just remember when you looked at the timeline, the last standards work in

03:05:07.900 --> 03:05:14.860
2001 and we are in 2020 and we will not have a recommendation to the state

03:05:14.860 --> 03:05:20.740
board for aligned materials for K-8 until November of 21.

03:05:20.980 --> 03:05:24.260
So this 20 year process.

03:05:24.380 --> 03:05:30.460
So I would just say as my sister, as a chair of a VAPA department at the

03:05:30.460 --> 03:05:36.620
school, they, the arts department have been so waiting and so supportive of

03:05:36.620 --> 03:05:37.580
this process.

03:05:37.860 --> 03:05:40.460
So I just want to say that this is a long time in coming.

03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:44.660
It's been very, very thoughtful, a credit to the three writers who work

03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:46.140
with the California arts project.

03:05:46.420 --> 03:05:50.660
They're part of the subject matter projects who play very critical roles in

03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:53.140
our framework development and our professional development.

03:05:53.500 --> 03:05:58.660
And to Julie Tonkovich, who's the IQC liaison to the arts, Julie lived every

03:05:58.660 --> 03:05:59.980
word of this framework.

03:05:59.980 --> 03:06:03.940
I would say she has been an amazing resource and Shanine Coates and her

03:06:03.940 --> 03:06:09.220
leadership following Stephanie Gretzen in the work of the IQC, that everyone's

03:06:09.220 --> 03:06:10.820
worked really, really hard on this.

03:06:10.820 --> 03:06:15.620
And I just think the public comments, just so the board is aware of the

03:06:15.620 --> 03:06:19.620
public comments, helped to influence the rewriting and the writers really

03:06:19.740 --> 03:06:25.820
listen to the public comments in both 60 day review and in the IQC dialogue.

03:06:25.820 --> 03:06:31.820
So this, this, this framework comes to us as a state board being really

03:06:31.820 --> 03:06:33.500
refined and addressed.

03:06:33.500 --> 03:06:35.020
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things.

03:06:35.260 --> 03:06:38.220
I think the guide for reading and using the framework is going to be very,

03:06:38.220 --> 03:06:43.860
very helpful to the field, both for the teachers and discipline specific and

03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:46.900
those that can look to integrate across discipline.

03:06:47.100 --> 03:06:49.620
We know that art has an ability to do that.

03:06:50.500 --> 03:06:54.180
And I think that the addressing of universal design for learning,

03:06:54.460 --> 03:06:57.740
particular addressing the English learners and the students with disabilities,

03:06:57.740 --> 03:07:02.820
an important component of this framework, we have gotten really stronger as

03:07:02.820 --> 03:07:06.420
Patricia Rucker and I have worked with instructional quality over the last 10

03:07:06.420 --> 03:07:10.900
years, we have really seen a development in the framework process that adds

03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:14.580
really specific chapters to really help the implementation.

03:07:14.820 --> 03:07:17.300
It's a wonderful resource and a wonderful tool.

03:07:18.020 --> 03:07:23.700
And I do want to say that I think the arts integration is an important

03:07:23.940 --> 03:07:28.100
component to think about as we think about the rollout and how to help

03:07:28.140 --> 03:07:30.580
everybody embrace the arts going forward.

03:07:30.580 --> 03:07:34.380
So with that, let me just say this framework has gone through a wonderful

03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:39.220
development process and refinement and lots of input and I think it's ready.

03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:43.260
And when we listen to the public comments, I'll be ready to make a motion.

03:07:43.540 --> 03:07:43.900
Thank you.

03:07:44.500 --> 03:07:45.220
Okay.

03:07:45.820 --> 03:07:51.260
I don't see anybody asking for clarifying questions at this moment.

03:07:51.500 --> 03:07:54.620
So we'll go to public comment and then come back for board discussion.

03:07:55.260 --> 03:07:56.500
Do we have any public comment?

03:07:56.980 --> 03:08:00.380
Yes, we have two speakers so far.

03:08:01.220 --> 03:08:06.060
Speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:08:06.100 --> 03:08:07.700
Your time starts now.

03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:12.860
Good morning.

03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:17.300
My name is Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and I'm representing the California

03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:19.340
Music Educators Association.

03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:24.140
CMEA is in full support of the proposed arts education framework.

03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:28.700
It is comprehensive and provides guidance on reviewing, improving, and

03:08:28.700 --> 03:08:33.460
developing equitable standards based arts education programs for all students.

03:08:33.940 --> 03:08:38.020
The framework is organized into chapters that address the full range of arts

03:08:38.020 --> 03:08:42.700
education, including the five arts disciplines through discipline specific

03:08:42.700 --> 03:08:47.940
chapters, and it provides a clear and concise chapter on the co-equal approach

03:08:47.940 --> 03:08:50.580
to arts integration in chapter eight.

03:08:50.940 --> 03:08:55.980
The arts education framework is sorely needed in the arts education field and

03:08:56.020 --> 03:08:58.580
our arts educators are waiting to use it.

03:08:58.940 --> 03:09:04.180
All California students will benefit from this updated and comprehensive arts

03:09:04.220 --> 03:09:05.500
education framework.

03:09:05.900 --> 03:09:08.100
Please approve and adopt the framework.

03:09:08.220 --> 03:09:08.660
Thank you.

03:09:10.140 --> 03:09:10.860
Thank you.

03:09:11.380 --> 03:09:13.540
Next caller, you're now unmuted.

03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:16.340
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:28.900
Okay.

03:09:28.900 --> 03:09:32.340
That particular caller has not dropped into the queue.

03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:34.580
I'm going to attempt to unmute.

03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:42.020
Hello, this is Carol Huddy.

03:09:42.420 --> 03:09:47.420
I am a theater educator for the past 35 years and a member of the California

03:09:47.420 --> 03:09:50.180
Educational Theater Association.

03:09:50.580 --> 03:09:56.740
And I want to state our full support of the new framework.

03:09:57.100 --> 03:10:01.220
We appreciate the transparent process of developing this framework.

03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:05.460
We believe that our voices were heard throughout the timeline, not only through

03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:10.740
members of the VAPA curriculum framework and evaluation criteria committee focus

03:10:10.740 --> 03:10:15.300
groups, but through the opportunity to give public comment and the transparency of

03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:18.860
this process solidifies the validity of the document.

03:10:19.220 --> 03:10:23.740
The California arts framework is a valuable tool that will inform all

03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:29.300
stakeholders to implement the standards and develop the tools necessary for

03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:32.620
executing standards based curriculum in this classroom.

03:10:33.060 --> 03:10:37.660
Our go-to is our goal is to aid students in arts literacy.

03:10:37.660 --> 03:10:41.980
And this document helps educators develop creative ways to design and

03:10:41.980 --> 03:10:45.180
implement implement the California arts standards.

03:10:45.540 --> 03:10:50.140
This framework finally modernized tools we use in the classroom.

03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:51.740
Please support.

03:10:51.780 --> 03:10:52.380
Thank you.

03:10:53.380 --> 03:10:54.020
Thank you.

03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:55.540
And that is our last caller.

03:10:57.060 --> 03:10:57.900
Okay.

03:10:58.900 --> 03:11:04.180
With that, we'll turn to board discussion and vote on the recommendation.

03:11:06.620 --> 03:11:09.340
Is there any, you need to close the public hearing now that.

03:11:09.780 --> 03:11:15.740
Oh, so the public hearing is now closed at 1201 and we'll open up for board

03:11:15.740 --> 03:11:18.100
discussion of the recommendation.

03:11:20.820 --> 03:11:25.180
Anybody want to add anything before we get a motion to vote?

03:11:25.860 --> 03:11:28.100
Sounds like it has been a wonderful process.

03:11:28.100 --> 03:11:33.300
I want to thank the staff for shepherding this along so beautifully.

03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:36.820
Do we have a motion?

03:11:38.780 --> 03:11:39.300
Yes.

03:11:40.460 --> 03:11:48.180
I move approval of the California arts framework, um, recommended

03:11:48.180 --> 03:11:49.660
unanimously by the IQC.

03:11:50.380 --> 03:11:50.900
All right.

03:11:53.180 --> 03:11:53.740
Sorry.

03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:55.100
Sorry.

03:11:55.180 --> 03:11:56.940
Was that a second from member sun?

03:11:57.580 --> 03:11:57.900
Yes.

03:11:58.380 --> 03:11:58.780
Second.

03:11:59.220 --> 03:11:59.740
Okay.

03:12:00.140 --> 03:12:02.420
Uh, and I think we need to hold a roll call vote.

03:12:02.420 --> 03:12:04.380
Is that unless there any further discussion?

03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:07.340
No, we need to hold a roll call vote.

03:12:07.380 --> 03:12:08.900
Um, Karen, can you call the roll?

03:12:09.140 --> 03:12:09.460
Yes.

03:12:10.420 --> 03:12:11.260
Um, Linda.

03:12:12.860 --> 03:12:13.540
Uh, yes.

03:12:14.260 --> 03:12:14.860
Cynthia.

03:12:16.460 --> 03:12:16.900
Yes.

03:12:17.460 --> 03:12:17.940
Jim.

03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:21.260
Yes.

03:12:21.700 --> 03:12:22.140
Matt.

03:12:23.140 --> 03:12:23.540
Yes.

03:12:24.220 --> 03:12:24.660
Brenna.

03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:26.460
Yes.

03:12:26.900 --> 03:12:27.380
Kim.

03:12:28.620 --> 03:12:29.140
Yes.

03:12:29.860 --> 03:12:30.300
Auday.

03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:32.420
Yes.

03:12:32.980 --> 03:12:33.580
Patricia.

03:12:34.940 --> 03:12:35.260
Yes.

03:12:36.380 --> 03:12:36.900
Eileen.

03:12:37.740 --> 03:12:38.140
Yes.

03:12:39.100 --> 03:12:39.780
And Ting.

03:12:41.060 --> 03:12:41.380
Aye.

03:12:42.300 --> 03:12:42.860
It's unanimous.

03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:43.500
It passes.

03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:45.740
All right.

03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:54.620
And we have hoped to have, um, the world languages, um, framework heard before

03:12:54.620 --> 03:13:01.740
lunch, if you can hang in there, uh, I'm seeing nods, so, um, I hope that will be okay.

03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:08.100
Uh, we have the CDE and the IQC recommending that the state board hold a public hearing

03:13:08.100 --> 03:13:09.740
and adopt the world language framework.

03:13:10.500 --> 03:13:16.460
This too will be presented by Shanine Coates, uh, with, um, IQC chair, Jose

03:13:16.460 --> 03:13:22.300
Iniguez and the world languages subject matter committee chair Alma Delia Ranteria.

03:13:22.940 --> 03:13:27.580
Uh, I hereby open the public hearing at 1203 PM.

03:13:27.660 --> 03:13:28.740
Shanine, please begin.

03:13:29.180 --> 03:13:29.780
Thank you.

03:13:29.820 --> 03:13:30.700
Good afternoon.

03:13:31.140 --> 03:13:35.060
It is my honor and privilege to be in front of you today to present the world

03:13:35.060 --> 03:13:39.420
languages framework for California public schools, kindergarten through grade 12.

03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:46.220
We are very excited to be here to discuss a framework that lays the foundation for

03:13:46.220 --> 03:13:51.580
schools and districts to implement robust opportunities for California's diverse

03:13:51.580 --> 03:13:56.140
student population, to develop multilingualism and global competence.

03:13:56.620 --> 03:14:00.820
Today, we will briefly discuss how the contents of the world languages standards

03:14:01.100 --> 03:14:05.660
and the guidance in the world languages framework can help strengthen the learning

03:14:05.660 --> 03:14:11.260
of languages and the development of global competency and literacy at schools and

03:14:11.260 --> 03:14:13.180
districts throughout California.

03:14:14.260 --> 03:14:19.860
We had many generous partners along the way to whom we owe our deepest gratitude.

03:14:20.460 --> 03:14:24.260
I'd like to start by thanking Constantine O Silva, administrator of the curriculum

03:14:24.260 --> 03:14:30.100
frameworks unit, as well as Alejandro Hernandez, lead consultant, but also like

03:14:30.100 --> 03:14:34.020
to recognize the members of the world languages standards advisory committee.

03:14:34.380 --> 03:14:39.820
They gave shape to the direction and defined a vision for world languages education that

03:14:39.820 --> 03:14:42.780
would be aligned to 21st century learning.

03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:47.700
The world languages curriculum framework and evaluation criteria committee took the

03:14:47.700 --> 03:14:52.020
standards and created guidance that ensures that the standards are fully implemented.

03:14:52.500 --> 03:14:57.300
The writers for both the standards and the framework did an exceptional job listening

03:14:57.300 --> 03:15:02.260
to the committee members, fleshing out the guidance and making countless edits and

03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:07.980
revisions. The writers for the world languages standards, Brandon Zaslow and

03:15:07.980 --> 03:15:14.860
Christine Lanfear, Tanya Byram, and Svetlana Lazarova, served in the world languages

03:15:14.860 --> 03:15:16.380
standard advisory committee.

03:15:16.620 --> 03:15:19.660
They then collaborated to write the world languages framework.

03:15:19.860 --> 03:15:21.740
And so we are so very grateful to them.

03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:28.180
The California World Language Project and the California Language Teachers Association

03:15:28.380 --> 03:15:33.860
have consistently provided support, public comment and encouragement during the

03:15:33.860 --> 03:15:38.220
development of both the world languages standards and the framework.

03:15:38.740 --> 03:15:42.580
They got the word out when the framework needed snapshots and vignettes and the

03:15:42.580 --> 03:15:45.060
world languages community responded.

03:15:45.500 --> 03:15:48.620
This their work is an integral part of these documents.

03:15:48.900 --> 03:15:53.260
And of course, thank you to the educators in the instructional quality commission who

03:15:53.260 --> 03:15:57.900
ushered this work forward, advocated for language that was inclusive, provided

03:15:57.900 --> 03:16:01.540
clear guidance to educators, parents and other stakeholders.

03:16:02.420 --> 03:16:06.020
Last but not least, we'd like to thank Nicole Nates, who attended every meeting and

03:16:06.020 --> 03:16:11.780
conducted presentations to both the advisory committee and the CFCC chaired the

03:16:11.780 --> 03:16:17.020
World Languages Subject Matter Committee for years and in May 2020 facilitated a

03:16:17.020 --> 03:16:21.140
webinar focused on providing instruction to students of world languages in a

03:16:21.140 --> 03:16:22.460
distance learning format.

03:16:23.380 --> 03:16:28.580
During this presentation, we will provide an overview of the content and the status

03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:30.340
of the draft world languages framework.

03:16:30.740 --> 03:16:33.820
And I would like to begin by sharing the two recommendations we would like the

03:16:33.820 --> 03:16:38.100
members of the board to consider the California Department of Education and the

03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:42.220
Instructional Quality Commission recommend that the State Board of Education hold a

03:16:42.220 --> 03:16:46.580
public hearing and adopt the world languages framework, including the additional

03:16:46.580 --> 03:16:50.420
edits recommended by the ICC on April 17th, 2020.

03:16:50.860 --> 03:16:54.660
The CDE also recommends that the State Board of Education delegate authority to

03:16:54.660 --> 03:16:59.140
the State Board of Education and CDE to make any necessary revisions as the

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:02.460
document is professionally edited and prepared for publication.

03:17:04.140 --> 03:17:07.900
I'd like to start a presentation with building background, knowledge and

03:17:07.900 --> 03:17:11.660
providing context around standards, frameworks and instructional materials.

03:17:11.900 --> 03:17:13.220
Let's start with the standards.

03:17:13.860 --> 03:17:18.020
Standards are what we want our students to know, understand and be able to do at

03:17:18.020 --> 03:17:22.340
the end of every grade level and at the end of their K-12 experience for

03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:24.500
teachers. It is the what for instruction.

03:17:25.940 --> 03:17:29.300
Excuse me. The world language standards were adopted by the State Board of

03:17:29.300 --> 03:17:31.700
Education in 2019.

03:17:32.020 --> 03:17:37.260
Here is one example of a goal for a communication standard one interpretive

03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:38.260
communication.

03:17:39.020 --> 03:17:43.540
Students demonstrate understanding, interpret and analyze what is heard, read

03:17:43.540 --> 03:17:47.660
or viewed on a variety of topics from authentic texts.

03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:51.380
They use technology when appropriate to access information.

03:17:51.820 --> 03:17:55.780
The goal is then followed by world languages standards for the novice,

03:17:56.140 --> 03:18:01.140
intermediate, advanced and superior range of proficiency.

03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:05.700
Once the standards are adopted, it is important to help our educators and

03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:10.340
administrators understand the standards and how to best provide instruction for

03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:12.460
each and every student to meet the standards.

03:18:12.620 --> 03:18:16.540
And we do this through the support of the curriculum frameworks, which provide

03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:21.300
guidance to teachers on how to deliver high quality instruction to each and every

03:18:21.300 --> 03:18:22.300
student.

03:18:24.620 --> 03:18:30.220
So members of the World Languages Committee in California are very excited to

03:18:30.220 --> 03:18:34.700
have updated standards and a curriculum framework that supports the implementation

03:18:34.700 --> 03:18:36.940
of those standards. Why, you ask?

03:18:37.180 --> 03:18:41.660
Well, because this is the first time that we have both in California.

03:18:42.260 --> 03:18:48.580
Some of you may recall that in 2003, California had a framework, but no

03:18:48.580 --> 03:18:57.620
standards. Then in 2009, we had content standards, but due to the national budget

03:18:57.620 --> 03:19:01.820
crisis, we were unable to develop a framework.

03:19:02.460 --> 03:19:06.740
Exactly 10 years later, we are about to do something historic.

03:19:07.220 --> 03:19:12.380
Provide the world languages teaching community and other stakeholders with a

03:19:12.380 --> 03:19:15.580
framework that is aligned to our content standards.

03:19:16.140 --> 03:19:20.260
The standards provide critical information about what students should know and be

03:19:20.260 --> 03:19:24.020
able to do as they progress in their proficiency in languages other than

03:19:24.020 --> 03:19:31.860
English. So after a curriculum framework is adopted, we then move to the

03:19:31.860 --> 03:19:36.540
instructional materials, which, as we have stated, are the tools that teachers

03:19:36.540 --> 03:19:39.780
use in their classroom to help students meet the standards.

03:19:40.180 --> 03:19:44.580
Instructional materials come in a variety of different forms, including textbooks

03:19:44.580 --> 03:19:45.980
and digital formats.

03:19:49.060 --> 03:19:53.540
In summary, standards, curriculum frameworks and instructional materials are

03:19:53.540 --> 03:19:56.980
all supports for high quality instruction for students.

03:19:57.820 --> 03:20:01.620
I will now turn it over to Commissioner Enigas to discuss the frameworks

03:20:01.620 --> 03:20:02.700
development process.

03:20:03.700 --> 03:20:07.380
Thank you, Executive Director Coates. And hello again, it seems like a while.

03:20:08.500 --> 03:20:12.660
The world languages framework development process parallels the arts

03:20:12.660 --> 03:20:15.380
framework timeline that we mentioned earlier.

03:20:15.700 --> 03:20:21.660
The CDE began the development of world languages framework in August 2018 by

03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:26.420
conducting focus groups with world languages educators across California.

03:20:27.300 --> 03:20:31.700
We have the support from San Diego, Santa Clara, and Los Angeles County

03:20:31.700 --> 03:20:36.260
offices of education, as well as the CDE, who hosted focus groups to support

03:20:36.260 --> 03:20:39.700
this process to ensure the inclusion of diverse perspectives.

03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:45.500
The focus group feedback, including the several things, are the foundation for

03:20:45.500 --> 03:20:49.420
the instructional quality commission recommended and state board of education

03:20:49.420 --> 03:20:50.740
adopted guidelines.

03:20:51.340 --> 03:20:55.460
During this time, we also recruited educators and world language experts to

03:20:55.460 --> 03:21:00.660
serve on the curriculum framework and evaluation criteria, commonly referred to

03:21:01.620 --> 03:21:03.020
as the CFCC.

03:21:03.620 --> 03:21:08.260
After the ICC recommended to the State Board of Education approved appointments

03:21:08.260 --> 03:21:12.780
to the CFCC, the CFCC members met for six sessions.

03:21:13.180 --> 03:21:19.020
Each session is composed of two long meeting days or days, I should say, where

03:21:19.100 --> 03:21:23.380
they discuss and make recommendations for revisions to the draft world

03:21:23.380 --> 03:21:24.780
languages framework chapters.

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:30.020
The world languages framework development process is transparent and open to the

03:21:30.020 --> 03:21:30.540
public.

03:21:30.980 --> 03:21:35.980
Each CFCC meeting was publicly noticed, open to the public, and included

03:21:35.980 --> 03:21:40.780
opportunities for members of the public to make comment each day of the meetings.

03:21:41.180 --> 03:21:44.300
In fact, many members of the public participated in these meetings.

03:21:44.780 --> 03:21:52.580
Once completing recommendations, the CFCC forwarded their draft to the IQC, where

03:21:52.900 --> 03:21:57.500
we, the IQC, then reviewed the draft framework and made additional edits and

03:21:57.940 --> 03:22:01.380
improved the draft for the first public comment review period.

03:22:02.260 --> 03:22:07.500
After the first public review period, the IQC, with the help of the CDE, who, by

03:22:07.500 --> 03:22:11.900
the way, meticulously and regularly reviews and organizes public comment,

03:22:11.940 --> 03:22:12.820
thank you very much.

03:22:13.420 --> 03:22:17.140
We can't thank you enough CDE for thoroughly organizing these comments.

03:22:17.660 --> 03:22:21.100
Sometimes these comments are well over a thousand, so thank you.

03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:26.980
But together with CDE, we thoroughly considered the public comment and made

03:22:27.020 --> 03:22:33.180
additional edits based on these comments and prepared another draft for the

03:22:33.180 --> 03:22:36.020
second 60-day public review window.

03:22:36.860 --> 03:22:43.060
During the April 17th, 2020 meeting, the IQC review public comment received

03:22:43.100 --> 03:22:47.740
during the second public window period, and then made additional edits and

03:22:47.740 --> 03:22:49.940
revisions in preparation for today.

03:22:50.460 --> 03:22:51.260
Next slide, please.

03:22:52.100 --> 03:22:55.980
Given what I've just shared, I'd like to publicly acknowledge the work of

03:22:55.980 --> 03:22:57.620
the following contributors.

03:22:57.620 --> 03:23:02.540
First, the CFCC composed of content experts, including K-12 educators,

03:23:03.100 --> 03:23:06.220
school and district administrators, and university professors.

03:23:06.300 --> 03:23:09.900
The CFCC volunteered many hours in the development of the draft world

03:23:09.900 --> 03:23:10.820
languages framework.

03:23:11.380 --> 03:23:14.500
We are certainly grateful for their passion and dedication to providing

03:23:14.500 --> 03:23:18.460
quality world languages education to the students of California.

03:23:18.500 --> 03:23:23.140
I'd also like to thank the work of my IQC colleagues past and present, who

03:23:23.140 --> 03:23:26.940
also volunteer countless hours to the front-end development process, which

03:23:26.940 --> 03:23:28.580
truly a collaborative effort.

03:23:30.020 --> 03:23:34.900
And as the slide indicates, I'd like to delve into some detail about

03:23:34.900 --> 03:23:36.100
the public comment period.

03:23:36.500 --> 03:23:42.140
The public comment period allows the public to review and review detailed

03:23:42.140 --> 03:23:47.420
graphs of the framework graphs and are part of a large group of students

03:23:47.580 --> 03:23:51.580
and are part of a larger effort to make this process as open as possible

03:23:51.580 --> 03:23:52.180
to the public.

03:23:52.220 --> 03:23:57.260
For example, as I said earlier, all meetings are open to the public and

03:23:57.540 --> 03:24:01.380
the CDE established a dedicated email to receive public comment throughout

03:24:01.380 --> 03:24:02.540
the entire process.

03:24:03.100 --> 03:24:07.700
The first 60 day public comment and review period occurred from October 1st,

03:24:07.700 --> 03:24:11.580
2019 through December 2nd, 2019.

03:24:12.340 --> 03:24:15.980
During the public, during this particular comment, public comment period, we

03:24:16.020 --> 03:24:20.980
received over 80 comments submitted via online survey, email, regular mail,

03:24:21.180 --> 03:24:25.300
phone calls, and verbally during IQC and world language subject matter

03:24:25.300 --> 03:24:28.700
committee meetings held in January of 2020.

03:24:29.420 --> 03:24:35.060
During the January 2020 IQC meeting, we requested that the CDE staff

03:24:35.060 --> 03:24:38.660
collaborate with the framework writers to ensure there was consistent voice

03:24:38.700 --> 03:24:41.260
in all chapters, particularly chapter eight.

03:24:42.260 --> 03:24:47.300
The second 60 day public review comment, public comment and review period

03:24:47.300 --> 03:24:52.500
occurred from January 30th, 2020 through March 30th, 2020.

03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:57.700
During this timeframe, we received 11 comments from 11 individuals and

03:24:57.700 --> 03:24:59.180
organizations through email.

03:24:59.700 --> 03:25:03.900
The CDE staff also submitted comments during this review period to help refine

03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:08.140
the alignment between the world languages framework draft and the CFCC

03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:13.900
recommendations and the world language framework guidelines, particularly to

03:25:13.900 --> 03:25:17.500
ensure that the framework is comprehensible to a wide audience.

03:25:17.900 --> 03:25:22.300
Several comments also suggested increased clarity of the guidance in the

03:25:22.300 --> 03:25:22.980
framework.

03:25:23.980 --> 03:25:24.660
Thank you.

03:25:24.860 --> 03:25:30.260
And I now pass the presentation baton to the IQC world language subcommittee

03:25:30.260 --> 03:25:32.740
chair, Alma Dele Arendt-Villal.

03:25:35.660 --> 03:25:36.260
Thank you, Chair.

03:25:36.260 --> 03:25:36.780
And you guys.

03:25:37.340 --> 03:25:39.420
So this brings us all to today.

03:25:39.540 --> 03:25:44.020
And we are so very happy that the edits, the public, the world languages subject

03:25:44.020 --> 03:25:47.860
matter committee, and the instructional quality commission have all been

03:25:47.860 --> 03:25:51.420
addressed and the version of the framework that is currently posted on the

03:25:51.420 --> 03:25:55.940
world languages framework webpage, the world languages standards and the world

03:25:55.940 --> 03:26:01.780
languages framework reflect 21st century world language education programs that

03:26:01.780 --> 03:26:06.700
promote linguistic, global and intercultural competency for all learners

03:26:06.940 --> 03:26:11.620
and ultimately led to some important pedagogical shifts that are represented

03:26:11.620 --> 03:26:12.340
in the standards.

03:26:13.220 --> 03:26:16.980
The world languages framework provides guidance for the implementation of the

03:26:16.980 --> 03:26:20.780
world languages standards that the state board of education approved back in

03:26:20.780 --> 03:26:22.100
January of 2019.

03:26:24.700 --> 03:26:28.780
So the world languages framework is comprised of a total of 14 chapters and

03:26:28.780 --> 03:26:29.700
two appendices.

03:26:30.580 --> 03:26:35.500
Chapter one explains the vision of the world languages standards and discusses

03:26:35.500 --> 03:26:39.220
the instructional shifts needed to fully implement the standards.

03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:45.540
There's also a discussion of how the 2019 world language standards recognize and

03:26:45.540 --> 03:26:50.420
leverage recent initiatives such as the California education for global economy,

03:26:51.020 --> 03:26:55.660
global California 2030 and the state sealed by literacy, just to name a few.

03:26:56.460 --> 03:27:01.340
Chapter two then goes into detail regarding the provision of access and

03:27:01.340 --> 03:27:06.380
equity. However, specific teaching strategies aligned to this guidance are

03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:09.140
also incorporated throughout the entire framework.

03:27:10.020 --> 03:27:14.860
Chapter three suggests a variety of ways that educators may embrace and implement

03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:19.340
after schools and districts to ensure that more California students have

03:27:19.340 --> 03:27:21.580
pathways to learn a world language.

03:27:22.580 --> 03:27:27.500
Chapter four describes how the 2019 California world languages standards

03:27:27.740 --> 03:27:33.340
aligned to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages or ACETFL

03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:33.860
standards.

03:27:34.660 --> 03:27:39.580
Chapter five discusses best practices for implementing the world language

03:27:39.580 --> 03:27:40.100
standards.

03:27:40.660 --> 03:27:44.980
The chapter begins with an overview of universal design for learning, provides

03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:50.460
reasons for using authentic materials and suggests technology tools and

03:27:50.620 --> 03:27:55.220
resources that teachers can use to provide a high quality world languages

03:27:55.220 --> 03:27:55.820
instruction.

03:27:56.500 --> 03:28:01.500
Chapter six, seven and eight are all dedicated to each of the three strands of

03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:05.820
the standards, the communication standards, the culture standards and the

03:28:05.820 --> 03:28:06.860
connection standards.

03:28:07.500 --> 03:28:12.340
These chapters include a robust series of figures, snapshots and vignettes that

03:28:12.340 --> 03:28:15.980
illustrate how to implement the world language standards.

03:28:16.220 --> 03:28:20.860
Then we go on to chapter nine, which explains how the global competence

03:28:20.860 --> 03:28:25.420
domains relate to world languages instructions, describes the ranges and

03:28:25.420 --> 03:28:29.500
phases of language proficiency and identify scaffolds to support language

03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:32.300
learners to develop their language proficiency.

03:28:33.060 --> 03:28:37.780
Chapter 10 describes appropriate use of formative, interim and summative

03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:42.380
assessments with all students, including students with visible and non-visible

03:28:42.380 --> 03:28:45.300
disabilities and students in need of differentiated support.

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:51.500
Chapter 11 identifies strategies for leadership and advocacy to ensure access

03:28:51.500 --> 03:28:55.900
to world languages education for all students, kindergarten through grade 12.

03:28:56.940 --> 03:29:01.100
Chapter 12 focuses on the ways that language differ and how those

03:29:01.100 --> 03:29:03.540
differences impact teaching and learning.

03:29:04.460 --> 03:29:09.940
Chapter 13 provides criteria for the evaluation and guidance to help students

03:29:10.220 --> 03:29:17.940
education agencies regarding the adoption of instructional materials for

03:29:17.940 --> 03:29:19.620
the instruction of world languages.

03:29:19.980 --> 03:29:24.780
Chapter 14 is the glossary of all the terms that appear in both texts

03:29:24.780 --> 03:29:25.940
throughout the framework.

03:29:26.620 --> 03:29:30.060
Then there's our two appendices who are super helpful.

03:29:30.340 --> 03:29:35.260
Appendix one contains numerous tables that stakeholders, which are teachers,

03:29:35.260 --> 03:29:39.620
students, parents, administrators, and others interested in the progress of

03:29:39.620 --> 03:29:44.300
world language learners may use for placement, articulation, and the

03:29:44.300 --> 03:29:46.220
development of new language programs.

03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:51.980
And then appendix two offers a substantial list of resources consulted

03:29:51.980 --> 03:29:56.060
in the preparation of a framework that may be of interest to language education

03:29:56.060 --> 03:29:58.620
scholars and world language educators.

03:29:59.020 --> 03:30:01.340
Now we'll turn it over back to executive director Coates.

03:30:01.820 --> 03:30:02.780
Thank you so much.

03:30:03.660 --> 03:30:07.460
The design of this world languages framework is based on four principles and

03:30:07.460 --> 03:30:11.980
beliefs generated by world languages, educators and leaders around the state

03:30:11.980 --> 03:30:14.340
and approved by the instructional quality commission.

03:30:14.660 --> 03:30:17.580
The principles guide student access to world languages.

03:30:17.580 --> 03:30:22.260
Education highlight the value of developing multiculturalism and

03:30:22.260 --> 03:30:27.020
multiliteracy as a key component in global competence and career readiness,

03:30:27.340 --> 03:30:31.380
underscored the importance of high quality curricula that incorporate

03:30:31.380 --> 03:30:35.900
culturally authentic materials and prioritize ongoing support for

03:30:35.900 --> 03:30:39.820
professional learning opportunities for world languages educators.

03:30:41.980 --> 03:30:45.740
The educators we talked to during the focus group meetings, during the standards

03:30:45.740 --> 03:30:50.220
development process and during the framework development process have all

03:30:50.220 --> 03:30:51.620
had a common message.

03:30:51.940 --> 03:30:57.380
California is ready to expand opportunities for its unique and diverse

03:30:57.380 --> 03:31:02.140
student population to acquire world languages, develop intercultural

03:31:02.180 --> 03:31:05.340
competence and become global citizens.

03:31:05.580 --> 03:31:11.020
And California educators will find that the world languages standards are aligned

03:31:11.260 --> 03:31:17.100
with and support recent legislation and initiatives that champion these outcomes.

03:31:17.380 --> 03:31:21.860
Naturally, these standards establish a path for students to become multilingual

03:31:21.940 --> 03:31:25.300
and prepare to attain California's still of biliteracy.

03:31:25.580 --> 03:31:29.180
The world language standards also provide guidance in light of two

03:31:29.180 --> 03:31:30.980
significant pieces of legislation.

03:31:31.620 --> 03:31:36.420
The charge of this legislation and a subsequent initiative, global California

03:31:36.420 --> 03:31:41.900
2030 speak, learn, lead is for K-12 schools to support multilingualism for

03:31:41.900 --> 03:31:46.060
California's unique and diverse student populations through access to world

03:31:46.060 --> 03:31:47.140
language programs.

03:31:47.540 --> 03:31:54.340
The passage of proposition 58 education for a global economy in 2016 initiated a

03:31:54.340 --> 03:31:59.340
statewide effort to promote linguistic, global and intercultural competency among

03:31:59.340 --> 03:32:00.460
California students.

03:32:00.860 --> 03:32:06.020
The roadmap was designed to assist local educational agencies as they implement

03:32:06.020 --> 03:32:10.860
California's 21st century college and career ready standards, curriculum,

03:32:10.940 --> 03:32:14.020
instructional programs and assessments for English learners.

03:32:14.340 --> 03:32:18.260
It is also intended to provide resources and information to students, parents and

03:32:18.260 --> 03:32:23.020
community members about education and effective research based practices.

03:32:23.740 --> 03:32:28.140
Pending state board education action today, we will begin the editing and

03:32:28.140 --> 03:32:35.260
design of the world languages framework and additionally, we are scheduled to

03:32:35.260 --> 03:32:40.100
conduct a state level K-8 instructional materials adoption process pending state

03:32:40.100 --> 03:32:41.660
board of education action.

03:32:43.780 --> 03:32:46.660
This brings us back to the action recommended before you today.

03:32:46.980 --> 03:32:49.740
We would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

03:32:49.740 --> 03:32:51.060
Thank you very much.

03:32:51.900 --> 03:32:56.580
It's exciting to have our first ever such framework.

03:32:57.180 --> 03:33:04.180
We will now open the phone line for public comment queue and then we'll come

03:33:04.180 --> 03:33:10.380
back for, while we're doing that, I'll ask member Eileen Strauss to give some

03:33:10.380 --> 03:33:15.500
comments, but let's get the public comment queue going and then we'll get

03:33:15.620 --> 03:33:20.820
Strauss to give some comments, but let's get the public comment slide up.

03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:28.820
The very next one.

03:33:32.660 --> 03:33:36.980
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by

03:33:36.980 --> 03:33:39.180
following the instructions on this slide.

03:33:39.500 --> 03:33:43.620
While we're waiting for members to call in, I'll ask Eileen Strauss, who's been

03:33:43.620 --> 03:33:48.860
our world languages liaison also, if she has any initial comments, and then we'll

03:33:48.860 --> 03:33:53.540
ask if there are any clarifying questions before we take public comment and then

03:33:53.580 --> 03:33:54.980
resume the board discussion.

03:33:56.260 --> 03:33:57.460
Thank you, President Darlingham.

03:33:57.660 --> 03:34:02.460
So let me just acknowledge that the world language framework development was

03:34:02.460 --> 03:34:04.980
originally, the liaison was Dr.

03:34:04.980 --> 03:34:07.740
Karen Valdez, who was on our board until last year.

03:34:07.980 --> 03:34:12.460
And then I assumed as one of the liaisons to IQC along with member Rucker.

03:34:12.460 --> 03:34:16.540
So I'm delighted to be the liaison to recommend, and I will make a motion at

03:34:16.540 --> 03:34:18.700
the end of the discussion.

03:34:18.900 --> 03:34:22.420
But I do want to highlight this was a really collaborative process.

03:34:22.620 --> 03:34:23.940
It went really well.

03:34:24.060 --> 03:34:31.300
I want to thank Alma as the liaison to CFCC and Jose as the chair of IQC.

03:34:31.380 --> 03:34:34.540
All the work that was done, this was a long time in coming.

03:34:34.780 --> 03:34:39.540
And I think to have a standards and a framework in one document is really, it's

03:34:39.580 --> 03:34:44.180
time, it's been overdue and it's done in a really collaborative and quality way.

03:34:44.180 --> 03:34:49.260
I do want to highlight some things that I think our presenters talked about, but I

03:34:49.260 --> 03:34:51.660
think it's important that the board know as well.

03:34:51.900 --> 03:34:56.620
So frameworks typically take a longer time than we think from the time we adopt

03:34:56.620 --> 03:35:00.860
standards, then we do a framework when it goes out for all the public comments and

03:35:00.860 --> 03:35:05.980
the edits, then it finally comes back to the board and then we get the materials,

03:35:06.140 --> 03:35:09.180
which is for this one is also November twenty twenty one.

03:35:09.340 --> 03:35:16.220
So for the field who is so anxious to use this and it's so rich with guidance, I

03:35:16.220 --> 03:35:20.300
just want everyone to realize that we're not quite done yet, but we can start to

03:35:20.300 --> 03:35:25.820
share this and help collaborate with with our leaders in the field.

03:35:25.980 --> 03:35:30.900
Again, the the writers were incredibly responsive.

03:35:31.380 --> 03:35:32.460
A couple of highlights.

03:35:32.700 --> 03:35:34.700
It's aligned to the national standards.

03:35:34.740 --> 03:35:40.500
I think that's really important to know that the connections, there's some figures

03:35:40.500 --> 03:35:45.260
and snapshots and vignettes in the framework, which we put in our frameworks

03:35:45.260 --> 03:35:47.380
now that really help train teachers.

03:35:47.380 --> 03:35:50.980
So you can look at a little snapshot, a little vignette, you can practice what it

03:35:50.980 --> 03:35:52.500
will look like for class and practice.

03:35:52.700 --> 03:35:57.420
You can also teach administrators and leaders what it's going to look like when

03:35:57.420 --> 03:36:00.300
they're working with their teachers to facilitate this.

03:36:01.100 --> 03:36:04.180
Also, American Sign Language is in the framework, so I thought that would be

03:36:04.180 --> 03:36:05.500
interesting to share as well.

03:36:05.780 --> 03:36:10.460
And the equity and access is actually embedded throughout, but there's also some

03:36:10.460 --> 03:36:18.580
explicit area where it's dedicated and also it's it's really addressing an asset

03:36:18.580 --> 03:36:23.180
based approach of what all learners bring to the classroom and to the learning

03:36:23.180 --> 03:36:25.940
setting, and I thought that was really important to share.

03:36:26.660 --> 03:36:30.020
We also address English learners and students with disabilities.

03:36:30.340 --> 03:36:34.780
So that's with a deeper understanding, which is important to understand what that

03:36:34.780 --> 03:36:38.660
means for teachers with a diverse student population in their classroom and how to

03:36:38.660 --> 03:36:44.300
address it. This was a true collaboration also across departments in CDE.

03:36:44.300 --> 03:36:49.020
So I think we'll hear from the public comment in the board, but this is a

03:36:49.020 --> 03:36:54.940
resource guidance document that we need to really enhance and use with the field

03:36:54.940 --> 03:36:59.860
to make sure that the next generation of students get quality world language

03:36:59.860 --> 03:37:04.260
experience. So with that, I just want to thank everyone for the work that they did

03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:09.460
on it and thank Karen for her early liaison work and for all the people who

03:37:09.460 --> 03:37:12.980
were part of it. I think it is going to be a quality document that will live for a

03:37:12.980 --> 03:37:14.500
while to help guide our work.

03:37:14.860 --> 03:37:15.900
So thank you with that.

03:37:15.900 --> 03:37:19.740
I'll turn it back to President Darla Hammond and the public comment process.

03:37:20.620 --> 03:37:24.180
And seeing no hands raised for clarification at this time, we'll begin

03:37:24.180 --> 03:37:25.260
the public comment.

03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:31.420
If you do we have any public comments?

03:37:31.860 --> 03:37:34.780
Yes, we have two for public comment.

03:37:35.220 --> 03:37:39.740
Speaker, you are now unmuted and your time starts now.

03:37:43.260 --> 03:37:47.860
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association

03:37:47.860 --> 03:37:50.540
for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

03:37:50.820 --> 03:37:54.620
We are in full support of the 2020 World Languages Framework.

03:37:54.940 --> 03:37:58.540
The framework provides a blueprint for the implementation of the world

03:37:58.540 --> 03:38:02.980
languages standards adopted by the board on January 2019.

03:38:02.980 --> 03:38:07.620
Teachers will have guidance on implementing a high quality world

03:38:07.620 --> 03:38:11.820
languages program for every student from kindergarten through 12th grade.

03:38:12.300 --> 03:38:16.780
The framework is complemented by and supports other frameworks such as the

03:38:16.780 --> 03:38:20.780
English Language Arts English Language Development Framework and supports

03:38:20.780 --> 03:38:24.140
the California Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts

03:38:24.140 --> 03:38:25.180
and Mathematics.

03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:30.100
The adoption of the world languages standards in conjunction with the adoption

03:38:30.100 --> 03:38:34.380
of the world languages framework, we believe represents the commitment of our

03:38:34.380 --> 03:38:38.100
state to increase multiliteracy throughout California.

03:38:38.460 --> 03:38:41.980
Let's provide our students with opportunities to learn more than one

03:38:41.980 --> 03:38:46.860
language, increasing their intercultural appreciation and global competence.

03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:50.700
Please approve and adopt the 2020 World Languages Framework.

03:38:50.900 --> 03:38:51.420
Thank you.

03:38:52.420 --> 03:38:53.500
Thank you, Speaker.

03:38:53.820 --> 03:38:57.340
Next speaker, you are now unmuted.

03:38:57.580 --> 03:39:00.220
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:01.940
Your time starts now.

03:39:05.860 --> 03:39:07.260
Hi, I am Nicole Nates.

03:39:07.260 --> 03:39:10.740
I'm a program specialist for instructional technology and world languages in San

03:39:10.740 --> 03:39:12.140
Juan Unified School District.

03:39:12.340 --> 03:39:17.820
And I just want to also duplicate what the previous speaker said and what

03:39:18.340 --> 03:39:23.460
everybody in this meeting has said and add my support for the adoption of this

03:39:23.460 --> 03:39:24.860
world languages framework.

03:39:24.860 --> 03:39:29.140
Having witnessed the work firsthand from the start of the standards development

03:39:29.140 --> 03:39:34.940
process through most of the framework development process, I am beyond

03:39:34.940 --> 03:39:38.060
overwhelmed with the quality of the writing that is going to support world

03:39:38.060 --> 03:39:41.380
languages education for all of our learners and provide multiple pathways.

03:39:41.420 --> 03:39:41.900
Thank you.

03:39:42.860 --> 03:39:43.580
Thank you.

03:39:44.300 --> 03:39:47.900
There are no more individuals for public comment.

03:39:48.940 --> 03:39:49.620
All right.

03:39:50.540 --> 03:39:51.100
Thank you.

03:39:51.100 --> 03:39:54.580
Given that there's no other public comment, we'll now close the public hearing

03:39:54.580 --> 03:39:57.300
for this item at 1230 p.m.

03:39:57.300 --> 03:40:00.820
and commence with board discussion and action.

03:40:01.140 --> 03:40:06.900
And I'll kick that off simply by saying how proud I am to be part of a state that

03:40:06.900 --> 03:40:13.620
is so explicitly committed to a multilingual future for all of us in the

03:40:13.620 --> 03:40:15.020
state and for all of our students.

03:40:15.020 --> 03:40:18.500
So I think this is a wonderful step in that direction.

03:40:19.260 --> 03:40:26.700
And is there any discussion from members of the board before we take a motion?

03:40:28.900 --> 03:40:31.220
I am not seeing any hands raised.

03:40:33.500 --> 03:40:34.940
So do I have a motion?

03:40:35.540 --> 03:40:37.420
So I'll be glad to make a motion.

03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:44.300
I move approval on adoption of the world language framework as unanimously proved

03:40:44.300 --> 03:40:50.660
for IQC with the edits and any necessary revisions as it goes to formal publication.

03:40:51.420 --> 03:40:53.060
And do we have a second?

03:40:53.540 --> 03:40:54.860
I'd like to second that.

03:40:57.340 --> 03:40:58.540
Did you catch that, Karen?

03:40:58.700 --> 03:40:59.060
No.

03:40:59.060 --> 03:40:59.740
Who second?

03:41:00.740 --> 03:41:08.500
I think a couple of us did, but this is Aidé, and I would like to second Eileen's motion.

03:41:08.820 --> 03:41:09.900
Thank you very much.

03:41:10.860 --> 03:41:13.740
And so we're going to have a roll call vote.

03:41:14.340 --> 03:41:17.020
Karen, will you manage the roll call?

03:41:17.100 --> 03:41:17.620
Yes.

03:41:18.140 --> 03:41:18.780
Patricia?

03:41:23.540 --> 03:41:24.380
Patricia Rucker?

03:41:25.020 --> 03:41:26.940
You may be muted, Patricia.

03:41:27.300 --> 03:41:27.820
Yes.

03:41:28.980 --> 03:41:29.500
Thank you.

03:41:29.820 --> 03:41:30.300
Brenna?

03:41:34.180 --> 03:41:35.140
Brenna, you're muted.

03:41:36.300 --> 03:41:36.780
Yes.

03:41:37.180 --> 03:41:37.660
Thank you.

03:41:37.780 --> 03:41:38.300
Jim?

03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:40.900
Yes.

Yes.

03:41:45.500 --> 03:41:46.060
Eileen?

03:41:46.940 --> 03:41:47.460
Yes.

03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:48.580
Linda?

03:41:49.860 --> 03:41:50.380
Yes.

03:41:50.820 --> 03:41:51.540
Cynthia?

03:41:53.260 --> 03:41:53.780
Yes.

03:41:54.260 --> 03:41:54.820
Matt?

03:41:55.780 --> 03:41:56.260
Yes.

03:41:56.860 --> 03:41:57.420
Aidé?

03:41:58.540 --> 03:41:59.180
Yes.

03:41:59.900 --> 03:42:00.380
Kim?

03:42:01.700 --> 03:42:02.220
Yes.

03:42:02.860 --> 03:42:03.660
It's unanimous.

03:42:04.980 --> 03:42:07.060
And unanimous and enthusiastic.

03:42:07.580 --> 03:42:10.220
So thank you, Shanine, for all this great work.

03:42:11.060 --> 03:42:15.100
And you'll be pleased to know we're now going to take a 30 minute lunch break.

03:42:15.780 --> 03:42:17.620
It is 1232.

03:42:17.660 --> 03:42:19.980
I will see you back here at 102.

03:42:20.860 --> 03:42:23.860
Please turn off your microphones and cameras during the break.

03:42:24.220 --> 03:42:28.980
And then when you come back, turn them on again so that we will reestablish our quorum.

03:42:29.980 --> 03:42:30.820
See you then.

03:42:36.220 --> 03:42:38.500
So we need to reestablish our quorum.

03:42:38.500 --> 03:42:40.100
So Karen, please take the role.

03:42:40.220 --> 03:42:40.660
Okay.

03:42:41.500 --> 03:42:42.420
Patricia Rucker?

03:42:45.940 --> 03:42:46.380
Here.

03:42:47.420 --> 03:42:47.860
Thank you.

03:42:48.380 --> 03:42:48.780
Brenna?

03:42:49.260 --> 03:42:50.060

E.

03:42:56.460 --> 03:42:57.260
Tim Sung?

03:42:57.260 --> 03:42:57.780
Here.

03:42:58.860 --> 03:42:59.660
Eileen Strauss?

03:43:00.380 --> 03:43:00.780
Here.

03:43:01.740 --> 03:43:02.780
Linda Darling-Hammond?

03:43:03.500 --> 03:43:03.900
Here.

03:43:04.380 --> 03:43:05.580

03:43:14.300 --> 03:43:15.580
Kim Patio-Bronson?

03:43:16.620 --> 03:43:17.100
Here.

03:43:18.060 --> 03:43:18.860
All present.

03:43:19.900 --> 03:43:20.700
All right.

03:43:21.420 --> 03:43:22.140
All right.

03:43:23.180 --> 03:43:29.420
So we are going to take up item five, the California Assessment of Student Performance

03:43:29.420 --> 03:43:34.300
and Progress System and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

03:43:34.300 --> 03:43:36.620
This is an update on program activities.

03:43:37.500 --> 03:43:43.260
We are now on a schedule that gets us finished after dinnertime.

03:43:44.620 --> 03:43:46.460
So we're going to try to keep things moving.

03:43:46.460 --> 03:43:51.660
And I'm going to ask Mao Vang, who is going to present this, to just keep going through

03:43:51.660 --> 03:43:52.860
all the segments.

03:43:52.860 --> 03:43:58.780
And if you have questions, please keep a notepad nearby and keep track of your questions so

03:43:58.780 --> 03:44:00.380
that we can take them all at the end.

03:44:00.380 --> 03:44:00.700
Okay?

03:44:02.220 --> 03:44:06.540
Mao, please present the mega assessment item.

03:44:07.180 --> 03:44:07.740
Okay.

03:44:07.740 --> 03:44:08.140
Thank you.

03:44:10.380 --> 03:44:13.820
Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond, and board members.

03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:19.420
I'm Mao Vang, the Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division

03:44:19.980 --> 03:44:22.220
at the California Department of Education.

03:44:22.220 --> 03:44:25.100
The item before you today is an information item.

03:44:29.740 --> 03:44:34.780
Given that we have a few new State Board of Education members, I would like to start by

03:44:34.780 --> 03:44:38.300
providing an overview of California's system of assessments.

03:44:39.020 --> 03:44:43.420
I will also provide information about resources that are available for parents and guardians.

03:44:44.220 --> 03:44:47.180
And then I will move into the assessment program updates.

03:44:47.740 --> 03:44:49.980
I will finish with some time for questions.

03:44:51.180 --> 03:44:55.580
So let's start with an overview of California's assessment system.

03:44:56.620 --> 03:44:58.860
System of assessments, excuse me.

03:44:58.860 --> 03:45:02.940
The Assessment Development and Administration Division manages a number of assessments for

03:45:02.940 --> 03:45:04.380
the State of California.

03:45:06.940 --> 03:45:13.020
At the forefront is the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or CASP, system.

03:45:14.060 --> 03:45:16.860
Which comprise of seven different assessments.

03:45:16.860 --> 03:45:23.260
The Smarter Balanced Assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics,

03:45:23.260 --> 03:45:28.860
the California Science Test, or CASP, the California Alternate Assessments for English

03:45:28.860 --> 03:45:34.940
Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science, and the California Spanish Assessment, or the CSA.

03:45:35.580 --> 03:45:43.100
The CASP system was established in statute in 2013 and became effective on January 1,

03:45:43.100 --> 03:45:44.540
2014.

03:45:44.540 --> 03:45:49.100
The statute provides for the development and administration of assessments through the use

03:45:49.100 --> 03:45:50.940
of technology where feasible.

03:45:51.500 --> 03:45:57.100
All of our assessments are at various stages of development and transitioning to online

03:45:57.100 --> 03:45:57.740
assessments.

03:45:58.700 --> 03:46:04.300
The primary purpose of the CASP system is to assist teachers, administrators, students,

03:46:04.300 --> 03:46:10.540
and parents to promote high-quality teaching and learning through the use of a variety of assessment

03:46:10.540 --> 03:46:12.140
approaches and items.

03:46:12.780 --> 03:46:18.700
So the implementation of CASP was significant in that it shifted the primary focus away

03:46:18.700 --> 03:46:22.780
from accountability and toward promoting high-quality teaching and learning.

03:46:23.420 --> 03:46:30.940
Our divisions work really place our assessments meaningfully within the teaching and learning

03:46:30.940 --> 03:46:31.420
process.

03:46:33.260 --> 03:46:37.740
So the starting point for transitioning all of California's state assessments was the adoption

03:46:37.740 --> 03:46:42.940
of the Smarter Balanced Assessments for English Language Arts and Math from the Smarter Balanced

03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:44.140
Assessment Consortium.

03:46:44.780 --> 03:46:50.460
It is a state-led partnership whose goal is to provide leadership and resources to improve

03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:51.340
teaching and learning.

03:46:51.980 --> 03:46:56.540
And currently, there are 12 states, one territory, and the Bureau of Indian Education

03:46:57.580 --> 03:46:58.380
that are members.

03:46:59.100 --> 03:47:03.740
So since its inception, California has played a key leadership role in the governance of

03:47:03.740 --> 03:47:05.740
the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

03:47:06.300 --> 03:47:10.300
California has members on numerous advisory committees.

03:47:10.300 --> 03:47:15.260
Our state has made a significant investment in this comprehensive system by ensuring it

03:47:15.260 --> 03:47:22.300
is available and no cost to local educational agencies and their staff, and has financially

03:47:22.300 --> 03:47:26.460
supported numerous professional learning opportunities in support of our assessment

03:47:26.460 --> 03:47:27.500
system's purpose.

03:47:29.580 --> 03:47:35.260
In order to leverage all of Smarter Balanced components, this means that it's accessing

03:47:35.980 --> 03:47:41.100
a balanced and comprehensive system of assessments that include end-of-year tests,

03:47:41.100 --> 03:47:47.020
referred to as summative assessments, interim assessments to be used as periodic check-ins

03:47:47.020 --> 03:47:53.100
during the school year, and Tools for Teachers, which has replaced the digital library as the

03:47:53.100 --> 03:47:56.780
formative assessment component of the Smarter Balanced Assessment System.

03:47:57.340 --> 03:48:03.340
The digital library was decommissioned on May 28th of this year, and the Tools for Teachers

03:48:03.340 --> 03:48:05.980
preview site was launched on June 16th.

03:48:06.700 --> 03:48:12.060
Tools for Teachers consist of instructional, professional learning, and formative assessment

03:48:12.060 --> 03:48:13.820
tools and resources.

03:48:13.820 --> 03:48:17.980
Each of these elements work together throughout the year to support teaching and learning.

03:48:20.060 --> 03:48:24.940
Our Smarter Balanced summative assessments are aligned to the Common Core State Standards

03:48:24.940 --> 03:48:30.380
in English Language Arts and Mathematics for grades 3 through 8 and 11.

03:48:30.380 --> 03:48:35.660
The English Language Arts or Literacy measures the domains of reading, writing, listening,

03:48:35.660 --> 03:48:37.260
and research or inquiry.

03:48:37.980 --> 03:48:42.380
Mathematics measures the domains of concepts and procedures, problem-solving, and data

03:48:42.380 --> 03:48:44.700
analysis and communicating reasoning.

03:48:46.700 --> 03:48:51.740
Moving on to the California Science Test, which is aligned with the California

03:48:51.740 --> 03:48:55.740
Next Generation Science Standards for grades 5 through 8 and high school,

03:48:56.300 --> 03:49:01.100
and provides models of high-quality items that reflect fidelity to the standards.

03:49:01.820 --> 03:49:06.620
The first operational administration of the CAST, or California Science Test, was

03:49:06.620 --> 03:49:10.380
conducted in the 2018-2019 school year.

03:49:11.180 --> 03:49:17.500
The CAST measures the domains of life sciences, physical sciences, and earth and space

03:49:17.500 --> 03:49:18.140
sciences.

03:49:19.020 --> 03:49:23.820
The engineering, technology, and application of science performance expectations are

03:49:23.820 --> 03:49:27.340
embedded within the three science domains being tested.

03:49:28.300 --> 03:49:32.940
And the environmental principles and concepts are used as context for the assessment

03:49:32.940 --> 03:49:34.620
items when appropriate.

03:49:36.940 --> 03:49:41.420
The California Alternate Assessments are available for English Language Arts,

03:49:42.140 --> 03:49:43.500
Mathematics, and Science.

03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:49.100
And these California Alternate Assessments are aligned to the connectors and they are

03:49:49.100 --> 03:49:52.380
linked to the same standards as the general assessments.

03:49:54.300 --> 03:49:55.900
Sorry, I think I went a little too fast.

03:49:57.980 --> 03:50:04.220
So our California Alternate Assessments provide students with developmentally appropriate

03:50:04.220 --> 03:50:09.340
opportunities to demonstrate what they know and can do as it relates to adaptive grade

03:50:09.340 --> 03:50:10.220
level content.

03:50:11.340 --> 03:50:16.380
The California Alternate Assessments are designed for students with the most significant

03:50:16.380 --> 03:50:21.980
cognitive disabilities and only students with an individualized education program that

03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:25.580
designates the need for an alternate assessment can take them.

03:50:26.380 --> 03:50:31.100
So unlike the California Alternate Assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics,

03:50:31.100 --> 03:50:38.220
the California Alternate Assessment for Science consists of four embedded performance tasks

03:50:38.220 --> 03:50:42.140
which are administered shortly after science instruction throughout the school year.

03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:53.180
And again, they're aligned to the same general standards as the general test through the

03:50:53.180 --> 03:50:55.020
connectors or the alternate standards.

03:50:55.580 --> 03:50:59.820
Next, we have the California Spanish Assessment.

03:51:01.260 --> 03:51:06.300
It is an optional test used to measure a student's achievement in Spanish reading

03:51:06.300 --> 03:51:12.540
language arts that is aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Espanol for students

03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:14.780
in grades three through eight and high school.

03:51:15.420 --> 03:51:20.380
This assessment measures three domains, reading, writing mechanics, and listening.

03:51:21.020 --> 03:51:25.260
Another assessment program we have is the English Language Proficiency Assessments

03:51:25.260 --> 03:51:27.020
for California or LPAC.

03:51:27.980 --> 03:51:30.460
LPAC serves multiple purposes.

03:51:30.460 --> 03:51:36.860
The initial LPAC is given to eligible students whose home language survey indicates a primary

03:51:36.860 --> 03:51:43.180
language other than English to determine English proficiency and identify students as being

03:51:43.180 --> 03:51:47.340
either an English learner or initial fluent English proficient.

03:51:48.060 --> 03:51:55.100
This is done within 30 days of enrollment in a California public school.

03:51:56.060 --> 03:52:00.700
Students will take the initial LPAC only once in their educational career.

03:52:01.660 --> 03:52:06.780
The summative LPAC is given to students who have been identified as English learners

03:52:06.780 --> 03:52:11.500
based on results from the initial LPAC or previously by the California English Language

03:52:11.500 --> 03:52:17.100
Development Test and measures a student's progress toward English proficiency.

03:52:17.660 --> 03:52:23.500
The results support decisions for students to be re-designated as fluent English proficient.

03:52:26.620 --> 03:52:33.420
The English Language Proficiency Assessments for California is aligned with the 2012 California

03:52:33.420 --> 03:52:39.500
English Language Development Standards and assess four domains, listening, speaking,

03:52:39.500 --> 03:52:40.700
reading, and writing.

03:52:41.340 --> 03:52:47.660
The summative LPAC transition to a computer-based assessment in spring of this year 2020.

03:52:47.660 --> 03:52:54.220
The initial LPAC will transition to a computer-based assessment beginning on August 20, 2020.

03:52:57.100 --> 03:53:05.820
So the alternate LPAC is like the other California alternate assessments in that it is for students

03:53:05.820 --> 03:53:12.620
with the most significant cognitive disabilities and it's used for the same purposes as the

03:53:15.980 --> 03:53:20.700
initial alternate LPAC and summative alternate LPAC for this population.

03:53:21.500 --> 03:53:27.100
It is aligned to the 2012 California English Language Development Standards through the

03:53:27.100 --> 03:53:33.100
English Language Development Connectors that are reduced in breadth, depth, and complexity

03:53:33.100 --> 03:53:35.580
for students in kindergarten through grade 12.

03:53:37.500 --> 03:53:41.660
And it will replace all locally determined alternate assessments for students with the

03:53:41.660 --> 03:53:46.460
most significant cognitive disabilities who would normally take the summative LPAC

03:53:46.460 --> 03:53:52.460
starting this year in an operational or census field test.

03:53:54.780 --> 03:54:01.100
Each of the CASP and LPAC assessments are carefully designed to be accessible to all students.

03:54:01.740 --> 03:54:07.340
Our comprehensive system of accessibility resources sets a national standard with such

03:54:07.340 --> 03:54:14.380
resources as translation glossaries, text-to-speech, and tools such as calculators and periodic

03:54:14.380 --> 03:54:17.820
tables that are accessible to students who are visually impaired.

03:54:21.260 --> 03:54:25.420
These resources provide equal opportunity for all students to access

03:54:25.420 --> 03:54:28.460
the assessments and demonstrate what they know and can do.

03:54:29.020 --> 03:54:34.460
So in terms of the test takers, just a quick summary for English Language Arts and Math,

03:54:34.460 --> 03:54:38.060
that's for grades, students in grades 3 through 8 and 11.

03:54:38.060 --> 03:54:46.460
For the California Science Test, grades 5 and 8 and once in high school, that is grades 10,

03:54:46.460 --> 03:54:48.460
grade 10, 11, or 12.

03:54:48.460 --> 03:54:54.460
If the students cannot take the regular English Language Arts, Math, or Science and their

03:54:54.860 --> 03:55:00.860
individual education program team indicates that they take an alternate assessment,

03:55:00.860 --> 03:55:03.820
then they take the corresponding alternate assessments.

03:55:05.260 --> 03:55:13.900
For the CSA or California Spanish Assessment, it's an optional test for grades 3 through 8

03:55:13.900 --> 03:55:14.700
and high school.

03:55:15.580 --> 03:55:21.900
And for the LPAC, whether it be the initial, summative, or alternate, it is given to

03:55:21.900 --> 03:55:24.460
eligible students in kindergarten through grade 12.

03:55:27.020 --> 03:55:32.620
So in these challenging times of distance learning and other challenges that parents

03:55:32.620 --> 03:55:38.540
and guardians are facing with their children's education, I want to remind us that we do have

03:55:38.540 --> 03:55:41.580
resources to support our parents and guardians in California.

03:55:43.580 --> 03:55:49.340
In collaboration with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, the CDE, the California

03:55:49.340 --> 03:55:54.860
Department of Education, has developed a website that is dedicated to helping families become

03:55:54.860 --> 03:55:59.340
familiar with our assessments so they can better understand their children's score

03:55:59.340 --> 03:56:01.580
and have easy access to family resources.

03:56:02.620 --> 03:56:08.700
There are two starting Smarter websites, one for the CAST system and the other is for LPAC.

03:56:09.420 --> 03:56:14.460
Currently, the assessments on these starting Smarter sites include the English Language Arts

03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:19.020
and Math, the alternate assessments for the English Language Arts and Mathematics,

03:56:19.020 --> 03:56:23.340
and the California Science Test and the California Spanish Assessment.

03:56:24.140 --> 03:56:27.980
The California Alternate Assessment for Science will be available later this year.

03:56:28.700 --> 03:56:33.740
And on the LPAC Starting Smarter website, we have included the initial and summative LPAC

03:56:33.740 --> 03:56:36.220
and the alternate LPAC will be available this year.

03:56:38.460 --> 03:56:43.100
So on these websites, we have samples, student score reports, and an explanation of the domains

03:56:43.100 --> 03:56:44.460
of each assessment.

03:56:44.460 --> 03:56:48.940
We also have sample test questions and links to the practice tests and other

03:56:48.940 --> 03:56:52.860
no-cost parent and guardian friendly resources that support learning.

03:56:55.100 --> 03:56:58.620
Both of these sites are available in English and Spanish.

03:57:00.620 --> 03:57:04.460
Our division also supports the work of several other assessments,

03:57:05.180 --> 03:57:09.580
including the Physical Fitness Test, the Grade 2 Diagnostic Assessments,

03:57:09.580 --> 03:57:13.820
the High School Equivalency Test, the California High School Proficiency Exam,

03:57:14.460 --> 03:57:17.180
and the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

03:57:18.860 --> 03:57:21.500
Our division does have a lot going on.

03:57:23.740 --> 03:57:30.620
So with that, I want to move on to the written item before you that provides updates on most

03:57:30.620 --> 03:57:31.580
of our programs.

03:57:32.140 --> 03:57:34.940
I will begin with the assessment program updates.

03:57:35.980 --> 03:57:42.220
So over the last few months, our division has made critical changes to support the movement

03:57:42.220 --> 03:57:43.260
to distance learning.

03:57:44.140 --> 03:57:48.380
The following table is a summary of some of the events that took place.

03:57:49.340 --> 03:57:54.780
So with testing paused in the Federal Waiver Security March,

03:57:54.780 --> 03:58:00.860
there were a lot of questions from local educational agency staff about next steps.

03:58:01.580 --> 03:58:08.700
In April, then, we hosted a cross-divisional webinar for all coordinators to discuss how the

03:58:08.780 --> 03:58:13.500
Executive Orders and the Federal Waiver Impact Assessments, Accountability,

03:58:13.500 --> 03:58:18.940
and the California System of Support, as well as the Local Control and Accountability Plan

03:58:18.940 --> 03:58:19.980
Development Process.

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:26.860
Also in April, we worked with the Smarter Balance and our contractor Educational Testing Service

03:58:26.860 --> 03:58:32.700
to make the interim assessments available to be administered remotely without the need

03:58:32.700 --> 03:58:34.940
for a secure browser through June 30.

03:58:35.580 --> 03:58:41.260
This option provided local educational agencies with the flexibility to incorporate the interim

03:58:41.260 --> 03:58:43.260
assessments into distance learning.

03:58:45.740 --> 03:58:52.380
Moving on to May, we identified assessment resources for supporting the Learning Acceleration

03:58:52.380 --> 03:58:59.100
webpage, as well as pivoting very quickly to whole educator involvement activities

03:58:59.100 --> 03:59:01.020
in a virtual workshop environment.

03:59:01.980 --> 03:59:06.300
In June, we contributed to the development of the California Department of Education's

03:59:06.300 --> 03:59:12.780
Stronger Together guidebook, and we also developed a webpage that provides answers to

03:59:12.780 --> 03:59:18.220
questions that our division has received in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

03:59:19.660 --> 03:59:26.220
We contributed to the implementation tool, Guidance on Diagnostic Informative Assessments,

03:59:26.220 --> 03:59:31.020
with the leadership of our Board President Linda Darling-Hammond and Superintendent Thurman

03:59:31.020 --> 03:59:32.700
that was released yesterday.

03:59:37.580 --> 03:59:43.980
When the statewide testing was suspended on March 18, testing across the state had already

03:59:43.980 --> 03:59:45.900
begun prior to that suspension.

03:59:46.780 --> 03:59:51.260
The following table here represent content from Table 1 from the item.

03:59:52.220 --> 03:59:58.860
When analyzing the summary data for our Smarter Balanced English Language Arts, Literacy,

03:59:58.860 --> 04:00:03.740
and Mathematics, the California Science Test, and the California Spanish Assessment,

04:00:05.020 --> 04:00:09.820
we can come to a conclusion that the numbers of students who completed testing prior to

04:00:09.820 --> 04:00:15.580
the statewide suspension represent such a small portion of the anticipated testing population.

04:00:16.540 --> 04:00:23.900
For reference, there were 1,956 local educational agencies in California who have students in

04:00:23.900 --> 04:00:26.940
these grade levels that the tests assess at.

04:00:27.660 --> 04:00:32.700
The number of local educational agencies that started testing also represented a small

04:00:32.700 --> 04:00:34.060
portion of the total.

04:00:35.500 --> 04:00:41.660
With the numbers so underrepresented of the testing population, that any reporting of

04:00:41.660 --> 04:00:44.860
data would not have potential use in any meaningful way.

04:00:44.860 --> 04:00:55.820
And these data is also from Table 1 following the same trend for the alternate assessments

04:00:55.820 --> 04:01:01.900
for English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science for the alternate assessments.

04:01:03.580 --> 04:01:07.900
And then this table shows the summary data for the summative LPAC.

04:01:08.860 --> 04:01:17.260
And it's considerably higher, yet still only a small portion of the total number of registered

04:01:17.260 --> 04:01:17.740
students.

04:01:19.020 --> 04:01:26.060
As we get the K through 12 or kindergarten through 12 writing tests scored throughout

04:01:26.060 --> 04:01:31.260
the summer, the numbers at the end here, the number of students who completed testing

04:01:31.820 --> 04:01:32.860
will increase.

04:01:33.660 --> 04:01:38.860
As you're aware in grades K through 2, the writing test is still on paper.

04:01:42.380 --> 04:01:45.500
So what about student score reports?

04:01:47.660 --> 04:01:54.300
Student score reports and student level data files will be provided to

04:01:54.300 --> 04:01:56.860
local educational agencies at the end of the month.

04:01:56.860 --> 04:02:02.620
Only students that submitted a complete assessment will receive a score report.

04:02:03.660 --> 04:02:09.260
So for the California Spanish assessment, due to the low numbers of participants for

04:02:09.260 --> 04:02:14.860
each grade level, we will only provide the percent correct for the students.

04:02:15.820 --> 04:02:20.700
For the California alternate assessment for science, due to the suspension of testing,

04:02:20.700 --> 04:02:24.620
we were unable to conduct standard setting because it was the first year that was supposed

04:02:24.620 --> 04:02:26.780
to be the first operational year.

04:02:27.980 --> 04:02:33.260
So standard setting work was not completed and the development work of the first operational

04:02:33.260 --> 04:02:38.140
assessment of the California alternate assessment for science has been delayed.

04:02:40.540 --> 04:02:43.820
So we will not provide score reports for those students either.

04:02:43.820 --> 04:02:51.980
We will provide instead preliminary indicators like we did when we had the 2018-19 field test

04:02:51.980 --> 04:02:53.340
administration.

04:02:53.340 --> 04:02:56.460
And there will be no public reporting and no federal reporting.

04:03:00.140 --> 04:03:05.260
So moving on to another update of the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessment status.

04:03:06.300 --> 04:03:10.780
Since 2015, the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments have been an integral part of

04:03:10.780 --> 04:03:15.180
the CASP system of assessments designed to support teaching and learning for

04:03:15.740 --> 04:03:18.220
English language arts and mathematics throughout the year.

04:03:19.100 --> 04:03:25.180
The 2019-20 testing volumes for the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments was on track to

04:03:25.180 --> 04:03:33.580
exceed the approximately 11.3 million administered during the 2018-19 school year.

04:03:34.620 --> 04:03:41.260
As of March 18, approximately 7.9 million interim assessments had already been administered,

04:03:41.260 --> 04:03:45.820
which exceeded the approximately 7.1 million the year before.

04:03:45.980 --> 04:03:53.180
Between April 14 and June 11, while interim assessments were available for distance

04:03:53.180 --> 04:04:00.220
learning, about 15,595 were administered remotely statewide.

04:04:00.860 --> 04:04:05.900
So in June, the Smarter Balanced members voted to continue making this option available for

04:04:05.900 --> 04:04:09.900
the 2020-2021 school year.

04:04:09.980 --> 04:04:15.740
The interims will be available starting on August 20, 2020.

04:04:16.540 --> 04:04:21.420
There are more than 160 interim assessments, and there are three types.

04:04:21.420 --> 04:04:26.940
The Interim Comprehensive Assessments, which assess similar targets as the summative.

04:04:27.500 --> 04:04:32.140
The Interim Assessment Blocks, which assess about one to eight targets.

04:04:32.140 --> 04:04:37.100
And the Focus Interim Assessment Blocks, which assess about one to three targets.

04:04:37.100 --> 04:04:38.300
They're smaller bundles.

04:04:39.260 --> 04:04:44.940
So although these interim assessments are developed for grades three through eight and

04:04:44.940 --> 04:04:50.380
high school, the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments can be administered to students

04:04:50.380 --> 04:04:53.100
at any grade level, K through 12.

04:04:53.100 --> 04:04:57.340
And the results from these assessments will be electronically available to educators

04:04:57.340 --> 04:05:03.660
within 20 minutes of administration after a school or district coordinator creates the

04:05:03.660 --> 04:05:09.260
student groups for the teachers to access in our California Educator Reporting System.

04:05:11.980 --> 04:05:21.420
So another update I wanted to share with you is that the CDE will implement the January 2020.

04:05:21.420 --> 04:05:27.180
I want to remind us that the State Board of Education approved a revised California Science

04:05:27.180 --> 04:05:30.060
Test Blueprint in January of 2020.

04:05:31.100 --> 04:05:38.700
And due to the stoppage of testing, the CDE has decided to delay the implementation of

04:05:38.700 --> 04:05:46.300
the revised blueprint by one year and reuse the 2019-2020 test form with modifications

04:05:46.300 --> 04:05:47.580
to the field test sets.

04:05:48.300 --> 04:05:53.020
One reason for this is the California summative assessments were suspended in March, right,

04:05:53.020 --> 04:05:56.860
and less than 27,000 students took the California Science Test.

04:05:57.980 --> 04:06:02.540
So with this insufficient number of students responding to last year's field test questions,

04:06:02.540 --> 04:06:05.420
we were unable to build a new test form that would

04:06:05.420 --> 04:06:08.940
allow for the implementation of the revised blueprint.

04:06:08.940 --> 04:06:15.100
And the revised blueprint will now be used to develop test forms for the 2021-22 administration

04:06:15.100 --> 04:06:15.740
of the CAST.

04:06:16.460 --> 04:06:20.940
And that was one way of us looking at some cost savings for the contract as well.

04:06:20.940 --> 04:06:30.060
So another update is the California Assessment for Science.

04:06:30.060 --> 04:06:32.460
The timeline for that is also updated.

04:06:34.700 --> 04:06:39.660
I mentioned that the first operational administration and standard setting for the

04:06:39.660 --> 04:06:43.980
California Alternate Assessment for Science has also been delayed for a year.

04:06:44.940 --> 04:06:51.580
The first operational test now will begin on September 8, 2020.

04:06:52.220 --> 04:06:55.980
Standard setting is scheduled for August 2021.

04:06:57.020 --> 04:07:02.460
And if all things go as planned, the CDE will present recommended threshold scores for

04:07:02.460 --> 04:07:06.620
approval at the November 2021 State Board of Education meeting.

04:07:07.260 --> 04:07:11.580
Next, we have the update on summative LPAC.

04:07:11.580 --> 04:07:17.580
So when the summative testing was suspended on March 18th, it has raised questions from

04:07:17.580 --> 04:07:22.620
the field of whether or not students who were able to complete the summative will receive

04:07:22.620 --> 04:07:24.220
their test results.

04:07:25.260 --> 04:07:31.900
As a result, we will offer the electronic student score reports for students who completed

04:07:31.900 --> 04:07:33.740
all of the summative testing.

04:07:34.060 --> 04:07:39.100
The student score reports for students who completed all four domains in the spring of

04:07:39.100 --> 04:07:40.380
2019-20.

04:07:41.340 --> 04:07:44.540
And the student score reports will be available in two waves.

04:07:44.540 --> 04:07:49.420
For grades 3 through 12 reports, it will be available sometime now in July.

04:07:50.140 --> 04:07:55.500
And kindergarten through grade 2 reports will be available in late summer or early fall.

04:07:56.060 --> 04:08:03.420
As I mentioned, once a local educational agency submit their answer books for scoring,

04:08:03.420 --> 04:08:06.220
then we will combine all those scores and report them out.

04:08:06.940 --> 04:08:14.220
For students who completed testing in 2019-20, their results from that summative LPAC can

04:08:14.220 --> 04:08:17.340
be used to determine reclassification eligibility.

04:08:18.300 --> 04:08:24.380
So for those students who did not complete testing in the spring, an optional fall summative

04:08:24.380 --> 04:08:29.100
LPAC window will be open and available between August 20th and October 30th.

04:08:30.060 --> 04:08:34.300
Recently through Senate Bill 98.

04:08:35.900 --> 04:08:43.340
During this window, educators can administer the optional fall summative LPAC assessment

04:08:43.340 --> 04:08:48.780
and use the results to meet the assessment of English language proficiency eligibility

04:08:48.780 --> 04:08:49.980
for reclassification.

04:08:50.540 --> 04:08:55.900
The optional fall summative LPAC is highly recommended for all English learner students

04:08:55.900 --> 04:09:03.420
who have already met other criteria in 2019-20 except for that first criteria.

04:09:04.220 --> 04:09:09.020
Students in grades 4 through 11 are highly encouraged to take this opportunity.

04:09:12.380 --> 04:09:18.540
Another update about the initial LPAC is that for the initial LPAC administration,

04:09:18.540 --> 04:09:25.580
the window just opened on July 1st and the administration will begin somewhat differently.

04:09:26.140 --> 04:09:33.660
From July 1 through August 19th, LEAs have the option to continue to administer the paper

04:09:33.660 --> 04:09:35.740
pencil version of the initial LPAC.

04:09:36.460 --> 04:09:41.820
Alternatively, they can wait until August 20 to begin administering the assessment

04:09:42.460 --> 04:09:44.540
as a computer-based initial LPAC.

04:09:45.420 --> 04:09:50.940
This paper pencil option was set in place for the first six weeks of the administration

04:09:50.940 --> 04:09:55.580
window to provide additional time for the California Department of Education and

04:09:55.820 --> 04:10:01.020
Contractor ETS educational testing service to prepare for the optional fall

04:10:01.020 --> 04:10:02.860
administration of the summative LPAC.

04:10:08.300 --> 04:10:14.460
Following up with another update on the Tools for Teachers preview website, it is now available.

04:10:16.380 --> 04:10:19.900
The rollout of the new Tools for Teachers website from Smarter Balanced,

04:10:20.700 --> 04:10:24.780
which is the new formative assessment component of the Smarter Balanced assessment system,

04:10:25.900 --> 04:10:31.340
did rollout, and in May we presented a demonstration of the key features of the

04:10:31.340 --> 04:10:33.980
Tools for Teachers preview website.

04:10:33.980 --> 04:10:38.380
Since then, Smarter Balanced launched the Tools for Teachers website,

04:10:39.180 --> 04:10:42.540
and it is now available for all public school staff.

04:10:43.260 --> 04:10:47.740
Tools for Teachers offer instructional and professional development resources aligned

04:10:47.740 --> 04:10:51.020
to the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Math.

04:10:55.980 --> 04:11:01.900
So, for our 2020 Tools for Teachers status and training opportunities, we are offering

04:11:01.900 --> 04:11:08.540
several opportunities for local educational agency staff to receive training on how to

04:11:08.540 --> 04:11:10.300
use Tools for Teachers.

04:11:11.020 --> 04:11:15.660
The day after the June 16 preview launch, the California Department of Education

04:11:15.660 --> 04:11:19.740
hosted a live webinar to demonstrate the new website for California members

04:11:20.300 --> 04:11:22.620
of the State Network of Educators.

04:11:23.260 --> 04:11:28.620
On June 22, we hosted a webinar to provide a live demonstration of Tools for Teachers.

04:11:29.340 --> 04:11:36.460
All of the approximately 296,000 local educational agency staff members who previously had

04:11:36.460 --> 04:11:40.460
a digital library account were invited to attend this webinar.

04:11:41.180 --> 04:11:47.100
Approximately 1,300 public school staff members attended.

04:11:47.340 --> 04:11:53.340
A recording of this webinar and other Tools for Teachers resources are available on the

04:11:53.340 --> 04:11:59.900
Tools for Teachers resource page on the CASP.org site and the ALPAC.org website.

04:12:00.700 --> 04:12:06.860
So, on July 28, the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium will host a virtual

04:12:07.740 --> 04:12:12.620
Train the Trainer workshop for California staff members only.

04:12:13.180 --> 04:12:18.140
We will be training other California educators on the Tools for Teachers and the Formative

04:12:18.140 --> 04:12:18.780
Assessments.

04:12:19.420 --> 04:12:25.180
This workshop will prepare their staff to conduct local trainings to assist educators

04:12:25.180 --> 04:12:26.860
in the use of the Tools for Teachers.

04:12:28.220 --> 04:12:34.140
With the grand opening of Tools for Teachers planned for September 30, 2020, in conjunction

04:12:34.140 --> 04:12:36.700
with the Smarter Balanced's 10-year anniversary.

04:12:36.780 --> 04:12:40.700
We are planning to have a webinar in late September to offer another demonstration for

04:12:40.700 --> 04:12:45.260
California educators focusing on the resources and features in the Tools for Teachers.

04:12:45.820 --> 04:12:51.340
We will also offer Tools for Teachers sessions and presentations at CDE-sponsored conferences

04:12:51.340 --> 04:12:56.380
and other events such as the California Assessment Conference that will be offered virtually

04:12:56.380 --> 04:13:02.700
in October and the Interim Informative Assessment Training that will be offered in fall 2020.

04:13:02.940 --> 04:13:07.980
This training is the Summer Institute Training that is being reconfigured to offer virtually.

04:13:08.860 --> 04:13:13.980
So, in addition to the above trainings, the CDE will continue to offer sessions and presentations

04:13:13.980 --> 04:13:16.940
throughout spring 2021.

04:13:16.940 --> 04:13:23.180
We have regular updates in our assessment spotlight and will continue to send out periodic

04:13:23.180 --> 04:13:28.220
emails to our coordinators, site administrators, and Tools for Teachers users.

04:13:28.700 --> 04:13:34.460
So, with the understanding that Tools for Teachers contain excellent resources to support

04:13:34.460 --> 04:13:39.740
English language arts and math instruction, California continues to develop similar resources

04:13:39.740 --> 04:13:41.820
to support science instruction.

04:13:42.540 --> 04:13:48.060
The California Department of Education has worked with the California science educators,

04:13:48.060 --> 04:13:53.660
with a number of California science educators, to develop high quality formative assessment

04:13:53.900 --> 04:13:57.900
resources that are aligned with the California next-generation science standards.

04:13:57.900 --> 04:14:01.900
And we are very excited to announce that we are preparing resources to be added to the

04:14:01.900 --> 04:14:05.900
Tools for Teachers website starting in the fall.

04:14:07.900 --> 04:14:13.900
So, through the development of these formative assessment science instructional resources,

04:14:13.900 --> 04:14:19.900
it included a project that we are working with the California Department of Education

04:14:20.140 --> 04:14:28.940
to develop a process with quality criteria that ensures these assessments are aligned

04:14:28.940 --> 04:14:31.900
with the California next-generation standards.

04:14:31.900 --> 04:14:37.180
They have embedded instructional differentiations such as formative assessment strategies,

04:14:38.300 --> 04:14:44.060
and equity and access considerations for all students that include embedded accessibility

04:14:44.060 --> 04:14:45.180
strategies.

04:14:45.260 --> 04:14:50.860
And in addition, these resources are authored in a multi-step collaboration process with

04:14:50.860 --> 04:14:55.580
multiple peer reviews, vetting, and assistance provided by coaches.

04:14:58.380 --> 04:15:02.140
Each science instructional resource contains these key features.

04:15:02.940 --> 04:15:09.660
Focus on phenomena and opportunities for active learning such as hands-on exploration and

04:15:09.660 --> 04:15:11.180
peer-to-peer collaboration.

04:15:11.660 --> 04:15:16.220
And these resources also integrates learning standards such as science and engineering

04:15:16.220 --> 04:15:21.660
practices and cross-cutting concepts and references common core state standards.

04:15:24.540 --> 04:15:30.220
So, there are 39 instructional resources that are developed through these two virtual

04:15:30.220 --> 04:15:32.700
workshops conducted in April and June.

04:15:33.260 --> 04:15:39.180
And while these resources are developed for kinder through grade five, educators from

04:15:39.180 --> 04:15:44.300
all grade bands participate in the development and ensure vertical articulation of the

04:15:44.300 --> 04:15:44.940
resources.

04:15:45.660 --> 04:15:49.900
And as I mentioned earlier, the CDE is working with the Smarter Balanced staff to arrange

04:15:49.900 --> 04:15:53.900
for the inclusion of these resources on the Tools for Teachers website this fall.

04:15:59.900 --> 04:16:04.700
We are constantly accepting applications for our trainings and educator opportunities.

04:16:05.580 --> 04:16:12.860
To access these opportunities, you can navigate to the home page of the CASP.org and LPAC.org

04:16:12.860 --> 04:16:18.220
pages and then select the training tab for upcoming training activities for the assessment

04:16:18.220 --> 04:16:24.940
programs and then select the Get Involved tab for upcoming educator involvement opportunities

04:16:24.940 --> 04:16:27.340
such as standard setting and item reviews.

04:16:29.900 --> 04:16:33.740
And with that, I have our contact information available.

04:16:34.700 --> 04:16:39.580
For each of the programs here, you may also sign up for our assessment spotlight by

04:16:39.580 --> 04:16:50.620
following sending a blank link to subscribe-CAASPP at mlist.cde.ca.gov.

04:16:55.340 --> 04:17:01.660
And we encourage you to follow us on Twitter with the handle at CDE assessments.

04:17:01.980 --> 04:17:07.660
And with that, I will thank you all for allowing me to share our assessment program updates

04:17:07.660 --> 04:17:08.220
with you.

04:17:08.220 --> 04:17:12.140
I would like to take this time for any questions if you have them.

04:17:13.100 --> 04:17:13.580
Thank you.

04:17:15.180 --> 04:17:19.660
Well, what I'm going to ask us to do then, thank you so much, Miles, very helpful to

04:17:19.660 --> 04:17:22.300
hear what's happening in the last few months, especially.

04:17:23.260 --> 04:17:27.740
I'm going to ask us to open up the queue for public comment.

04:17:28.700 --> 04:17:34.780
And then while we're doing that, I'll ask for some clarifying questions.

04:17:36.220 --> 04:17:41.020
You can see that members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by

04:17:41.020 --> 04:17:44.700
following the instructions on the posted slide there.

04:17:45.340 --> 04:17:49.740
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I'll first ask Ting Sun

04:17:49.740 --> 04:17:53.100
as one of our assessment liaisons if she has any initial comments.

04:17:54.060 --> 04:17:58.540
And I'll ask board members if they have any clarifying questions before we go to public

04:17:58.540 --> 04:17:59.100
comments.

04:17:59.100 --> 04:18:00.060
Okay, great.

04:18:00.060 --> 04:18:02.300
Thank you, Madam President.

04:18:02.300 --> 04:18:04.060
So a couple of things.

04:18:04.060 --> 04:18:08.220
First of all, thank you, Mal, and your team for continuing the good work during these

04:18:08.220 --> 04:18:09.820
very trying times.

04:18:09.820 --> 04:18:15.420
And I just wanted to emphasize a couple of things in Mal's presentation.

04:18:15.980 --> 04:18:21.500
One, around the purpose of assessments under CASP.

04:18:22.220 --> 04:18:25.740
That is to promote high quality teaching and learning.

04:18:25.740 --> 04:18:33.740
So what we've been trying to do is to decouple the assessment from accountability at varying

04:18:33.740 --> 04:18:35.260
degrees of success, right?

04:18:35.260 --> 04:18:40.620
And then coupling that with using assessments as a tool for teaching and learning.

04:18:40.620 --> 04:18:48.380
And so you'll have heard a myriad of tools that this division has put together for educators

04:18:48.380 --> 04:18:49.500
to be able to do that.

04:18:50.460 --> 04:18:58.460
And I know that we have been all very disappointed that we were not able to conduct the summative

04:18:58.460 --> 04:19:05.900
assessments this year, and no doubt it's a setback for us in our work with assessments

04:19:05.900 --> 04:19:12.780
and looking at our equity work and making sure that we are making progress and assessing

04:19:12.780 --> 04:19:16.220
where we are with students who have been left behind.

04:19:16.780 --> 04:19:24.300
So but, you know, given that we don't have the summative assessments, what it does allow

04:19:24.300 --> 04:19:30.940
us to do in the fall, instead of focusing on what the students did last year, right,

04:19:30.940 --> 04:19:37.100
now we can really pivot and focus this fall on how students are coming into our system

04:19:37.100 --> 04:19:37.580
this year.

04:19:38.140 --> 04:19:43.500
So I think pivoting from our usual focus and fall on how students performed in the

04:19:43.500 --> 04:19:48.620
summative assessments to really focusing on interim assessments, gathering information

04:19:48.620 --> 04:19:54.220
on where students are coming into schooling this year, and being able to then start

04:19:54.220 --> 04:19:57.580
addressing any kind of learning loss from the get go.

04:19:58.460 --> 04:20:03.980
We had talked about the continuity of learning plan, and I don't see how we can address

04:20:03.980 --> 04:20:09.500
continuity of learning without first understanding where the students are who come into this

04:20:09.500 --> 04:20:15.500
fall and where they are performing.

04:20:15.500 --> 04:20:21.340
So I would just highly encourage us to focus on those interim assessments.

04:20:21.340 --> 04:20:28.700
The guidelines that Mal had talked about that was just released that was led by President

04:20:28.700 --> 04:20:35.420
Darling Hammond and the work of Superintendent Thurmond, I think is very comprehensive in

04:20:35.420 --> 04:20:39.580
the types of assessment, the interim assessments that are out there and how they can be used,

04:20:39.580 --> 04:20:44.460
and certainly there are lots of tools, and they're still continuing to build more tools

04:20:44.460 --> 04:20:46.780
to support educators in that.

04:20:46.780 --> 04:20:53.580
So thank you, and I'm our other assessment liaison, so I'm just going to add a couple

04:20:53.580 --> 04:20:57.020
points to the ones that Ting has already brought out.

04:20:57.900 --> 04:21:03.020
One key thing is that the new interim tools that Smarter Balanced has developed, which

04:21:03.020 --> 04:21:09.420
allow you to go into a much deeper dive around specific topic areas, are also linked to

04:21:10.140 --> 04:21:15.820
tools for teachers around instruction and curriculum to then address the needs that

04:21:15.820 --> 04:21:18.700
may be highlighted by those assessments.

04:21:19.420 --> 04:21:25.820
So we're bringing them much closer together with the tools for teaching themselves

04:21:26.460 --> 04:21:27.500
and connecting those.

04:21:28.140 --> 04:21:32.860
There are other tools that are offered by Smarter Balanced, and under Ting's leadership,

04:21:32.860 --> 04:21:37.740
we're exploring some of those to see what else can be made available to the field to help

04:21:37.740 --> 04:21:40.700
us move kids along in a continuum.

04:21:40.700 --> 04:21:47.420
In addition to those, the other diagnostic assessments that the state approved originally

04:21:47.420 --> 04:21:55.100
for second grade testing, but most of them have a long continuum of being able to assess kids

04:21:55.100 --> 04:22:01.020
along a scale beyond grade level from wherever they happen to be across multiple grade levels,

04:22:01.020 --> 04:22:07.340
and then use that regularly to see growth and progress are part of the guidance that

04:22:09.020 --> 04:22:10.060
we just talked about.

04:22:10.780 --> 04:22:15.500
That's going to be really important because every teacher knows that when you get a

04:22:15.500 --> 04:22:20.540
heterogeneous classroom, the kids in that classroom are not all functioning at the same

04:22:20.620 --> 04:22:25.740
skill and grade level, and we want to figure out where they really are along the learning

04:22:25.740 --> 04:22:29.740
progressions and then really help them grow and monitor that growth.

04:22:29.740 --> 04:22:36.060
For districts that had some of those diagnostic tools in place, and many districts do, they use

04:22:36.060 --> 04:22:41.340
the DRA, or they use Acuity, or they use iReady, or they use NAP, or something else,

04:22:41.900 --> 04:22:47.820
they do have a way from last spring to see where kids are in the fall when they come in,

04:22:48.780 --> 04:22:51.980
and then to track their progress over the year.

04:22:51.980 --> 04:23:02.460
We really want to emphasize how districts can use the most productive tools, and all of those also

04:23:02.460 --> 04:23:08.860
have links to curriculum and instructional materials, to figure out where kids are starting

04:23:09.420 --> 04:23:13.020
and then to really accelerate their progress over the course of the year.

04:23:13.980 --> 04:23:17.580
So thanks so much, Mal, for all of your great work on that.

04:23:17.580 --> 04:23:22.220
Are there any clarifying questions from the board before we go to public comment?

04:23:23.260 --> 04:23:31.100
I'm not seeing any hands raised in the hand raising place, so we'll go to public comment

04:23:31.100 --> 04:23:35.980
at this point, and we want to encourage everyone who makes comments to please state your name and

04:23:35.980 --> 04:23:41.020
affiliation for the record. Remember to turn down the volume of your computer if you're following

04:23:41.020 --> 04:23:46.140
the live feed, and you'll be limited to one minute each. Are there public comments?

04:23:46.940 --> 04:23:49.260
We have one caller in the queue for public comment.

04:23:50.060 --> 04:23:50.380
Great.

04:23:56.060 --> 04:24:03.100
Hi, my name is Jessica Ibarra. I am a parent of a student that attends a public school in California.

04:24:03.900 --> 04:24:10.780
I just had a question because my daughter has been struggling to reclassify

04:24:11.980 --> 04:24:21.420
out of ELD. She's now entering high school, and we kind of had, she's met all the criteria

04:24:22.060 --> 04:24:31.660
except her summative test, and she was only a point away, so I'm not sure exactly how

04:24:32.220 --> 04:24:36.940
we can push her past that threshold and any advice for that.

04:24:38.620 --> 04:24:43.340
And that's actually a question we can return to Mal when she comes back to the podium.

04:24:43.340 --> 04:24:44.860
Are there any other public comments?

04:24:50.300 --> 04:24:52.380
Hearing no other public comments.

04:24:52.380 --> 04:24:55.900
We have two other callers that have not yet entered the queue.

04:24:56.860 --> 04:24:57.180
Okay.

04:24:59.020 --> 04:25:13.820
Callers, if you can please press star six and one when prompted.

04:25:17.740 --> 04:25:20.300
Hello, caller, would you like to make a comment on this item?

04:25:26.540 --> 04:25:29.580
Hello, caller, would you like to make a comment on this item?

04:25:30.940 --> 04:25:31.500
No, thank you.

04:25:34.460 --> 04:25:37.180
Okay, and that concludes public comment.

04:25:39.020 --> 04:25:45.660
Okay, and I want to open then the ground for board discussion,

04:25:46.620 --> 04:25:49.900
and be sure you raise your hand in the participant panel.

04:25:50.700 --> 04:25:55.660
I do want to also ask if Mal is still available to us.

04:25:55.980 --> 04:26:03.500
If you want to say anything about fall testing on the English learner progress assessment.

04:26:04.060 --> 04:26:10.940
For the parent who called in, if your child finished or completed testing on the English

04:26:10.940 --> 04:26:19.420
language proficiency assessments for California, the LPAC last spring, you could use those scores

04:26:19.420 --> 04:26:25.900
to see if she's meeting that criteria one of having the LPAC of level four

04:26:25.900 --> 04:26:27.660
for reclassification purposes.

04:26:28.300 --> 04:26:30.460
We have not sent those score reports out.

04:26:30.460 --> 04:26:34.300
So you need to determine whether she completed testing or not,

04:26:34.300 --> 04:26:38.460
and you'll have to probably consult with her school that she took it at.

04:26:39.500 --> 04:26:42.700
Once you have that information, if she meets that criteria,

04:26:42.700 --> 04:26:45.660
she's a perfect candidate for what we were talking about.

04:26:45.660 --> 04:26:52.620
If she meets the level four for reclassification purposes, she can be reclassified.

04:26:53.260 --> 04:26:56.700
If she did not meet it, or she did not complete the test,

04:26:57.500 --> 04:27:04.220
and she has like one or two domains left, or even if she didn't start at all last spring

04:27:04.220 --> 04:27:08.540
because of the school closures, she has an opportunity to take it this fall.

04:27:09.420 --> 04:27:14.140
As of August 20th, we will make it available for all school districts

04:27:14.140 --> 04:27:18.300
to be able to give it to students like your child who are on the cusp of

04:27:19.260 --> 04:27:21.500
being able to be reclassified.

04:27:21.500 --> 04:27:26.060
So those are some of the things you could think about and maybe talk to her former school

04:27:26.060 --> 04:27:30.060
as well as her new school to make that happen.

04:27:30.060 --> 04:27:30.620
Thank you very much.

04:27:33.980 --> 04:27:38.700
Any board discussion, comments, or questions about this item?

04:27:44.140 --> 04:27:51.020
I'm not hearing any, and this is not an action item.

04:27:51.020 --> 04:27:52.700
It's just an information item.

04:27:52.700 --> 04:27:54.460
Linda, Eileen has her hand up.

04:27:54.460 --> 04:27:56.140
Eileen has her hand up now, yes.

04:27:57.100 --> 04:27:57.820
Member Strauss.

04:27:58.380 --> 04:27:59.100
Thank you.

04:27:59.100 --> 04:28:04.140
I just wanted to make a comment to follow up on Member Sung's liaison report

04:28:04.780 --> 04:28:09.580
because I think we're all really worried about our students coming back this fall

04:28:09.580 --> 04:28:15.740
in whatever format they come into and knowing where they are and how we begin to connect

04:28:15.740 --> 04:28:16.460
and work with them.

04:28:16.460 --> 04:28:21.500
And I just think through Smarter Balanced and through CDE, we've worked really hard

04:28:21.500 --> 04:28:26.460
to try to provide resources, not just summative, but formative.

04:28:26.460 --> 04:28:32.380
And I think the interviews in the past have been quite helpful in helping teachers start

04:28:32.380 --> 04:28:35.900
to align their practices and to check in and see where their kids are.

04:28:35.980 --> 04:28:42.300
So I just think we want to make sure we reach out to districts and counties as people think

04:28:42.300 --> 04:28:47.180
about opening and to highlight some of the resources that Smarter Balanced will offer

04:28:47.180 --> 04:28:48.620
with the Tools for Teachers.

04:28:48.620 --> 04:28:54.140
And I just appreciate Member Sung's comment that this is about tools for teaching and learning

04:28:54.140 --> 04:28:56.940
and that we need to remember that that's what this is about.

04:28:56.940 --> 04:29:03.180
And I think things are so different now than they were six months ago and will be going forward.

04:29:03.180 --> 04:29:07.820
And so I think as students come back this fall, we need to remember that we have a lot

04:29:07.820 --> 04:29:14.060
of tools together that are available, but we got to connect to our students to look

04:29:14.060 --> 04:29:17.020
at how we can meet them where they are and help them progress.

04:29:17.660 --> 04:29:18.060
Thank you.

04:29:18.060 --> 04:29:18.540
That's great.

04:29:20.300 --> 04:29:29.260
And seeing no other discussion, then we will conclude this information item.

04:29:30.220 --> 04:29:36.540
Thank you very much, Mal, both for the clear rendering of the system and where we are

04:29:36.540 --> 04:29:38.940
and for all the work that you've done to get us here.

04:29:39.740 --> 04:29:40.220
Thank you.

04:29:40.220 --> 04:29:45.420
And we're going to move to item six, which is the School Accountability Report Card,

04:29:45.980 --> 04:29:50.460
approval of the template for the 2019-20 School Accountability Report.

04:29:51.660 --> 04:29:54.620
The CDE recommends that we approve the proposed

04:29:55.580 --> 04:29:58.620
SARC template for the 2019-20 school year.

04:29:58.620 --> 04:30:02.140
And the item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis from the CDE.

04:30:03.100 --> 04:30:05.660
So Cindy, please begin.

04:30:06.300 --> 04:30:08.940
Good afternoon, Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis,

04:30:08.940 --> 04:30:11.020
Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

04:30:11.900 --> 04:30:12.540
There we go.

04:30:13.500 --> 04:30:17.180
And this item, as you mentioned, President Darling-Hammond,

04:30:17.180 --> 04:30:22.620
is an annual item that the board takes action on, the approval of the SARC template.

04:30:22.700 --> 04:30:25.580
And so our recommendation is that you approve the proposed

04:30:25.580 --> 04:30:28.860
SARC template for the 2019-20 school year.

04:30:33.900 --> 04:30:36.140
Did you want to say anything else about that?

04:30:38.060 --> 04:30:39.900
This item is normally on consent.

04:30:40.700 --> 04:30:43.660
There's not really a lot of additions this year.

04:30:43.660 --> 04:30:48.780
If anything, with the prior board item that you just heard, our update on assessments,

04:30:48.860 --> 04:30:54.780
we've had to remove several items that would normally be reported on because we do not have

04:30:54.780 --> 04:31:00.140
any data for our assessments that are required to be part of the SARC.

04:31:00.140 --> 04:31:05.420
The other thing I would note is that our suspension tables, so discipline records,

04:31:07.660 --> 04:31:14.700
we are recommending that that be separated from the discipline tables from prior years because

04:31:14.700 --> 04:31:19.420
we will have a truncated, we anticipate that we will have a truncated set of data

04:31:19.420 --> 04:31:27.420
in that we will only have discipline records between July and March or end of February of 2020.

04:31:27.420 --> 04:31:34.060
And so it's not appropriate to compare those incident reports from prior years to

04:31:34.780 --> 04:31:39.180
this past year that we just finished since students were not physically in the classroom

04:31:39.180 --> 04:31:42.380
for a large part of the end of the school year.

04:31:42.380 --> 04:31:48.940
Thanks. I know people are wondering what kind of data they will be able to see, so that's very

04:31:48.940 --> 04:31:56.540
helpful. And we're also in the process of doing some work to think about how the SARC will evolve

04:31:57.180 --> 04:32:03.820
over time. So I wonder if you could say a little bit about that.

04:32:03.820 --> 04:32:04.140
Sure.

04:32:04.140 --> 04:32:05.660
For people's reference.

04:32:05.660 --> 04:32:13.180
So I mentioned this briefly in item two because the legislature and the governor just signed into

04:32:13.180 --> 04:32:20.860
law SB 98, which provides some additional funding. It piggybacks on a budget item from last year,

04:32:20.860 --> 04:32:29.180
which provides $350,000 to align the SARC with the LCAP e-template and what's on the dashboard.

04:32:29.180 --> 04:32:34.780
And so we are spending this fall and actually this summer working with our contractor,

04:32:34.780 --> 04:32:40.940
which is San Joaquin County Office of Education to redo really the SARC. It's one of our oldest

04:32:40.940 --> 04:32:47.740
applications that we do in accountability to make it something that is more aligned with what you

04:32:47.740 --> 04:32:54.300
see in a current data system. It's a very old data system. So I think if anything,

04:32:54.300 --> 04:32:59.660
from the field's perspective and on the data input side, administrative side, they'll see

04:32:59.660 --> 04:33:06.380
something that's a little bit more user friendly. And our hope is with this additional funding

04:33:06.380 --> 04:33:11.660
that's in the current year budget, we'll be able to even put something out on the template side

04:33:11.660 --> 04:33:19.260
that is much more 21st century as opposed to 1990s version of what you're currently seeing

04:33:19.980 --> 04:33:25.660
in the template that you'd be adopting today. And I think the other thing that you were really

04:33:25.660 --> 04:33:30.940
excited about, my recollection was when we spoke about this a couple of weeks ago, was that

04:33:32.300 --> 04:33:37.260
as opposed to when the SARC template first rolled out and we didn't have a lot of usage by

04:33:38.140 --> 04:33:45.260
districts that were using third party contractors, we do have over 75% of our districts using

04:33:45.260 --> 04:33:51.740
the template that the CDE pre-populates. And we do pre-populate over two-thirds of that document.

04:33:51.740 --> 04:33:57.180
And so we're really happy that it has wide usage out there and that we're saving districts

04:33:57.180 --> 04:34:02.860
money by providing this template and the pre-populated data to them. And I'm still

04:34:02.860 --> 04:34:13.340
excited about that. So thank you. Okay, great. We will see if there's any public comment and

04:34:13.340 --> 04:34:19.420
open the phone line for public comment. It's displayed. Any members who wish to provide

04:34:19.420 --> 04:34:25.180
comment can do so by following the instructions on that slide. And while we're waiting to see if

04:34:25.180 --> 04:34:30.140
we have any public comment, I want to ask Eileen Strauss as one of our accountability liaisons,

04:34:30.140 --> 04:34:37.020
if she has any initial comments. Oh, let me just make a comment. And I appreciate Cindy

04:34:37.020 --> 04:34:41.820
helping us understand where we're going and what the governor's budget will do to help us.

04:34:41.820 --> 04:34:47.580
But we've been talking for a long time about trying to get all these required reports that

04:34:47.580 --> 04:34:53.500
districts have to complete connected and integrated and pre-populated whenever possible.

04:34:54.060 --> 04:34:58.540
If you've ever been a district leader who's worked on these things, there's all these different

04:34:58.540 --> 04:35:05.420
reports. And so I feel like we're starting to move forward on that and trying to make a connection

04:35:05.420 --> 04:35:10.780
so that the reports, when they overlap, we don't have to sit there and input all the different

04:35:10.780 --> 04:35:16.300
pieces again. So I'll be excited to look at the process going forward that the budget is helping

04:35:16.300 --> 04:35:23.340
us do. I know Subaru and I, who are both liaisons to accountability, really support the integration

04:35:23.340 --> 04:35:28.700
and connection of all the items and the pre-population whenever possible. So after

04:35:28.700 --> 04:35:36.700
the public comment, I'll have a recommendation. Thank you. Okay. And are there any other clarifying

04:35:36.700 --> 04:35:43.820
questions? I don't see any. So we'll see if there is any public comment. There are no speakers for

04:35:43.820 --> 04:35:51.020
public comment. All right. So given that there's no public comment, we'll open for board discussion

04:35:52.060 --> 04:36:00.700
and then for a motion. Is there any further discussion of this item? I'm seeing none.

04:36:04.300 --> 04:36:10.220
Sorry, I didn't get my hand up. But I just wanted to flag one thing, and this is more for future

04:36:10.220 --> 04:36:16.700
reference, as sort of the conversation comes up about both how to pre-populate, which I think

04:36:16.700 --> 04:36:26.460
obviously has incredible efficiency opportunities, but also just to begin planting this idea that

04:36:27.180 --> 04:36:32.700
where we sometimes have some distinctions, for example, I was just thinking about the

04:36:33.580 --> 04:36:37.180
the curriculum, the conversation about

04:36:39.340 --> 04:36:49.900
TK versus K. And there are a couple places within the attachment on pages 13 and 14 where there's

04:36:49.900 --> 04:36:54.380
the potential for disaggregating the data to actually be able to look at class sizes and

04:36:54.380 --> 04:37:01.820
distribution of class sizes and provide data that can help school districts look at what they're

04:37:02.300 --> 04:37:09.020
doing at the early years of instruction and whether they're actually offering different

04:37:09.020 --> 04:37:14.780
models for TK versus K. So this isn't for today, but it's more a preview of things to come,

04:37:15.500 --> 04:37:19.820
especially as we're thinking about the potential for boilerplates where it can be automatically

04:37:19.820 --> 04:37:24.220
uploaded. And if we can build that into the system, I think we'll be a step ahead rather

04:37:24.220 --> 04:37:31.500
than needing to do it after the fact. Can I respond to that? Sure, please. So I

04:37:31.500 --> 04:37:37.500
think it's important to note that transitional kindergarten is not considered a grade for

04:37:38.220 --> 04:37:47.660
purposes of reporting. It's considered a program. And so the SARC is very strict on what we can

04:37:47.660 --> 04:37:54.940
add. And actually, we haven't had anything added to the SARC since 2008. So it's really something

04:37:54.940 --> 04:38:01.340
that the legislature has driven. It was actually part of the original Prop 98 over 30 years

04:38:01.420 --> 04:38:07.900
ago. So if there is an interest from the board to head in this direction or to add pieces,

04:38:07.900 --> 04:38:14.860
it may actually be a function of the legislature to put that into this document. Whereas,

04:38:15.980 --> 04:38:22.940
as opposed to the e-template or the dashboard, you have a lot more authority and control over

04:38:22.940 --> 04:38:29.980
what goes in those reporting systems as opposed to the SARC. And that's why it is the way it is,

04:38:29.980 --> 04:38:38.460
very clunky, because we are bound by legislation on what goes in here. So we have a very structured

04:38:38.460 --> 04:38:43.260
model on this piece. Whereas, compared to the dashboard, I think there's a little bit more

04:38:43.260 --> 04:38:50.940
freedom there. Great. That's helpful to know. And it may be something that we want to evaluate

04:38:51.820 --> 04:38:59.740
and make some recommendations about. Is there any other discussion of the SARC?

04:39:00.540 --> 04:39:04.860
I'm not seeing any other hands raised in the participant queue.

04:39:05.580 --> 04:39:11.420
So I'll make a recommendation that the state board approve the proposed

04:39:11.420 --> 04:39:15.900
SARC template for the 19-20 school year. And do we have a second?

04:39:15.900 --> 04:39:21.420
I'll second that. Thank you very much.

04:39:22.860 --> 04:39:28.460
Now I think we need to do a roll call vote. So Karen, can you facilitate that?

04:39:30.140 --> 04:39:33.100
Okay. Yes. Linda?

04:39:34.460 --> 04:39:36.140
Yes. Cynthia?

04:39:37.820 --> 04:39:39.180
Yes. Jim?

04:39:40.940 --> 04:39:42.860
Yes. Matt?

04:39:43.580 --> 04:39:49.980
Yes. That was Matt, actually, Patricia. I didn't call you yet.

04:39:49.980 --> 04:39:52.940
Okay. That's funny. Okay. Brenna?

04:39:54.140 --> 04:39:57.660
Yes. He did not respond. Kim?

04:39:58.860 --> 04:40:03.260
Yes. For Kim, not Matt. Yes, I understand that. I did.

04:40:04.780 --> 04:40:06.700
Yes. Patricia?

04:40:09.260 --> 04:40:11.660
Yes. Eileen?

04:40:12.300 --> 04:40:14.220
Eileen? Yes.

04:40:14.940 --> 04:40:17.180
And Ting? Yes.

04:40:17.820 --> 04:40:19.580
Okay. I'm back.

04:40:19.580 --> 04:40:20.940
You're back. Yes.

04:40:20.940 --> 04:40:24.300
You're yes. Okay. Thank you, Matt. Okay. It's unanimous.

04:40:25.740 --> 04:40:28.060
All right. Thank you very much. And thank you, Cindy.

04:40:29.420 --> 04:40:35.020
And now we're going to put the public comment slide back up to prepare for the consent items.

04:40:35.660 --> 04:40:41.020
And you will get a 10-minute break to give time for callers to get into the queue for

04:40:41.020 --> 04:40:46.540
providing public comment on our waiver consent calendar. And then following that break, we'll

04:40:46.540 --> 04:40:55.340
take up our calendar, which includes waiver items W1 through 15. And please, if you want

04:40:55.340 --> 04:41:00.380
to comment on this, members of the public, use the instructions that are shown on the screen.

04:41:01.340 --> 04:41:05.020
Board members, please turn off your microphones and your cameras.

04:41:05.980 --> 04:41:13.660
And we will reconvene at, let's say, 2.15. That's a nine-minute break. See you then.

04:41:22.140 --> 04:41:22.700
Are we live?

04:41:25.580 --> 04:41:26.780
Okay. Linda, we're live.

04:41:27.820 --> 04:41:34.380
Okay. Is everyone reassembled? Do you need to reestablish the quorum? Yes, please do.

04:41:34.380 --> 04:41:35.660
Yes. Okay. Hi.

04:41:37.660 --> 04:41:45.660
Okay. Linda Darling-Hammond. Here. Cynthia Glover-Woods.

04:41:47.260 --> 04:41:49.260
Here. Jim McQuillan.

04:41:50.700 --> 04:41:52.300
Here. Matt Navo.

04:41:53.260 --> 04:41:56.460
Here. Frena Pangelinan.

04:41:57.660 --> 04:41:59.980
Here. Kim Patio-Brownson.

04:41:59.980 --> 04:42:04.060
Here. Ida Rodriguez.

04:42:05.980 --> 04:42:07.740
Here. Patricia Rucker.

04:42:09.020 --> 04:42:10.620
Here. Eileen Strauss.

04:42:13.980 --> 04:42:18.620
Eileen, you're muted. Eileen. All right. Ting Sung.

04:42:19.580 --> 04:42:22.540
Here. Okay. We got a quorum. We can go.

04:42:22.700 --> 04:42:40.780
Okay. So, we'll now open up the phone line for the public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide comment, please identify yourself and your affiliation for the record and the waiver item and the district name to which you are speaking.

04:42:42.460 --> 04:42:49.740
Remember to turn down the speaker volume on your computers if you're following the live feed and speakers will be limited to one minute each.

04:42:49.740 --> 04:42:51.020
Is there any public comment?

04:42:52.540 --> 04:42:53.740
We have public comment.

04:42:57.580 --> 04:43:00.540
Please state your name for the record. The waiver number and-

04:43:00.540 --> 04:43:01.260
Alan Garde.

04:43:01.260 --> 04:43:02.460
Your time starts now.

04:43:03.980 --> 04:43:15.020
Thanks. Hi. My name is Alan Garde, Assistant Superintendent of Business for the Hayward Unified School District. I appreciate the State Board of Education's time in considering waiver W13 for our Hayward community.

04:43:15.020 --> 04:43:33.580
I fully support the waiver based on the following two reasons. One is it's critical for our community. There have been a substantial amount of our schools built in the 1950s. With our latest facilities master plan, there's a significant amount of investments needed to bring our schools up to par.

04:43:33.580 --> 04:43:55.340
And this was reiterated with our community's overwhelming approval of our 2018 bond measure to implement critical fire alarm, roof replacement and safety projects across our 31 schools and also regarding the legislative need for the waiver.

04:43:55.580 --> 04:44:11.020
This legislation is based on the law from 1878, which does not consider the size of safety, energy efficiency, or program bank needs of our young learners today. And so it's also, oh, sorry. Thank you.

04:44:12.620 --> 04:44:13.260
Muted.

04:44:20.300 --> 04:44:21.500
Any other public comment?

04:44:22.700 --> 04:44:24.060
We have another public comment.

04:44:25.740 --> 04:44:27.500
Caller, please state your name for the record.

04:44:30.300 --> 04:44:37.420
Hello. Hi, caller. Please state your name for the record, your affiliation and which item you're speaking to in the district.

04:44:46.300 --> 04:44:47.020
Unmuted.

04:44:52.860 --> 04:44:55.020
Hello, caller. Would you like to make public comment?

04:44:56.300 --> 04:44:56.540
Yes.

04:44:58.940 --> 04:45:00.780
Please state your name for the record.

04:45:02.540 --> 04:45:03.340
Lorraine Richards.

04:45:04.140 --> 04:45:05.100
Your time starts now.

04:45:06.940 --> 04:45:20.380
My name is Lorraine Richards. I represent California Teachers Association. As highlighted in our letters on items 13 and 15, CTA continues to be concerned with the funding determinations for non classroom based charters at 100% as well.

04:45:22.220 --> 04:45:23.900
Please call back at the appropriate item.

04:45:25.660 --> 04:45:26.620
The next time we dig it up.

04:45:33.180 --> 04:45:33.820
Hello, caller.

04:45:36.060 --> 04:45:36.700
Please state your name.

04:45:38.220 --> 04:45:40.300
And any affiliation? Your time starts now.

04:45:44.300 --> 04:45:48.060
Hello, my name is Michael Jubin. I represent California Teachers Association.

04:45:49.020 --> 04:45:53.820
I'm speaking on letters that we turned in for items of consent, items 12 and 14.

04:45:54.780 --> 04:45:57.180
CTA continues to be concerned with the funding.

04:45:58.300 --> 04:46:02.220
Please call back at the appropriate time. We're not taking up these items at this moment.

04:46:03.100 --> 04:46:09.020
Let's clarify that we're only taking up the waiver, the waiver items. I think that's the confusion, right?

04:46:12.220 --> 04:46:14.780
For those who are in the queue, this is for the waiver items.

04:46:17.740 --> 04:46:19.580
We have no caller at this time.

04:46:20.540 --> 04:46:21.020
Okay.

04:46:22.460 --> 04:46:32.300
I think people are already queued up for the next part of our agenda. So given that there's no other public comment, I'll now ask for a motion on waivers 1 through 15.

04:46:34.060 --> 04:46:34.700
I'll motion.

04:46:35.420 --> 04:46:38.140
Thank you, member Navo. Do I have a second?

04:46:38.620 --> 04:46:39.500
I will second.

04:46:40.060 --> 04:46:45.580
Thank you, member Rucker. We'll now hold a roll call vote. Karen, can you please call the roll? Sure.

04:46:47.260 --> 04:46:47.820
Patricia?

04:46:49.740 --> 04:46:50.060
Yes.

04:46:50.620 --> 04:46:51.100
Brenna?

04:46:52.540 --> 04:46:53.260
Yes.

04:46:53.260 --> 04:46:53.580
Jim?

04:46:55.020 --> 04:46:55.340
Yes.

04:46:55.900 --> 04:46:56.220
Ting?

04:46:59.340 --> 04:46:59.580
Yes.

04:47:00.860 --> 04:47:01.340
Eileen?

04:47:02.460 --> 04:47:03.180
Yes.

04:47:03.180 --> 04:47:03.660
Linda?

04:47:04.540 --> 04:47:04.860
Yes.

04:47:05.420 --> 04:47:05.980
Cynthia?

04:47:07.500 --> 04:47:07.820
Yes.

04:47:08.460 --> 04:47:08.780
Matt?

04:47:10.060 --> 04:47:10.380
Yes.

04:47:10.940 --> 04:47:11.340
Aide?

04:47:12.380 --> 04:47:12.700
Yes.

04:47:13.260 --> 04:47:13.580
Kim?

04:47:16.140 --> 04:47:16.460
Yes.

04:47:18.060 --> 04:47:18.780
It's unanimous.

04:47:20.540 --> 04:47:35.260
Okay. Very good. Now we're going to allow the callers to get into the queue for providing public comment for the regular items on the proposed consent, which we know we have a few people to comment on.

04:47:36.460 --> 04:47:46.540
And we're instructed here to take a five minute break so that people can get into the queue. I think they're already in the queue. So Karen, do we still want to take that break?

04:47:49.900 --> 04:47:52.540
Sounds like we don't need to because people are already queued up.

04:47:53.180 --> 04:47:58.940
I think they are. Yes. So let's just keep moving. We're almost back to our time schedule. So let's keep moving.

04:47:59.580 --> 04:48:12.300
And please ask any callers to identify themselves by name and affiliation as they respond to items eight through 15.

04:48:12.300 --> 04:48:21.980
Hello. Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:48:24.300 --> 04:48:28.060
Hello. My name is Michael Juba, and I represent the California Teachers Association.

04:48:29.180 --> 04:48:34.060
As highlighted on the letters that we sent regarding items of consent, items 12 and 14,

04:48:34.700 --> 04:48:40.540
CTA continues to be concerned with the funding determination for non-classroom-based charters at 100%,

04:48:41.500 --> 04:48:44.940
as well as the process in which the funding determinations are happening.

04:48:45.660 --> 04:48:52.300
Furthermore, we believe that the state is asking the members of SBE to provide public oversight on these funding determinations

04:48:52.860 --> 04:48:56.540
in a manner that's impossible given the limited amount of information on the item.

04:48:57.500 --> 04:49:06.540
The funding determination forms and budgets for each of the NCBs should be provided when the agenda is posted for public consumption.

04:49:07.340 --> 04:49:17.100
So in closing, CTA opposes the CDE's recommendation for the 100% funding determination for the non-classroom-based charters listed on this item.

04:49:17.980 --> 04:49:28.300
CTA believes that the CDE must share the funding determination forms and budgets to help ensure that another A3 scandal does not occur. Thank you.

04:49:28.300 --> 04:49:30.300
Thank you.

04:49:33.180 --> 04:49:36.780
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:49:39.420 --> 04:49:41.420
This is

04:49:46.140 --> 04:49:48.780
Hello, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:49:50.460 --> 04:49:54.380
This is Claire Crawford within the public interest. Your time starts now.

04:49:55.100 --> 04:50:09.260
Yes, thank you. I am speaking in opposition to items 12 and 14, and specifically the non-classroom-based funding determinations for Trivium charter schools, as well as for Heartwood Charter.

04:50:09.260 --> 04:50:15.500
In both cases, these schools have drastic disparities in their enrollment.

04:50:15.820 --> 04:50:26.220
For Trivium, with 750 students across three schools, they enroll zero foster youth, only four English learners, and only two homeless students.

04:50:26.220 --> 04:50:35.340
Similar numbers for Heartwood Charter School. Heartwood Charter School also continues to have an illegal practice of requiring a phone interview before enrollment.

04:50:35.740 --> 04:50:46.780
They are also not in compliance with the posting requirements of SB 75, and it appears that their enrollment practices are in discouraging enrollment of students with disabilities.

04:50:46.780 --> 04:50:52.940
They only have two students with disabilities, zero English learners, so similar problems at both of those schools.

04:50:53.500 --> 04:50:55.500
Time.

04:51:01.420 --> 04:51:05.580
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:51:08.300 --> 04:51:13.500
My name is John Lupo, and I want to comment on item number 16.

04:51:15.740 --> 04:51:19.820
I support the petition to establish the Pinecrest Expedition Academy.

04:51:20.220 --> 04:51:26.860
Caller, that's the, we are not taking up that item at this time. Please call back at the appropriate time.

04:51:29.820 --> 04:51:31.740
We are on items 8 through 15.

04:51:37.900 --> 04:51:43.100
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation and the item to which you're speaking to. Your time starts now.

04:51:49.820 --> 04:51:51.820
I support the petition to establish.

04:51:51.820 --> 04:51:55.180
Caller, would you like to make a public comment on any of the consent items?

04:51:57.020 --> 04:51:59.020
These are items 8 through 15.

04:52:06.220 --> 04:52:08.220
We have no additional public comment at this time.

04:52:12.620 --> 04:52:14.620
All right.

04:52:14.620 --> 04:52:21.260
Given that there's no further public comment, I'll ask for a motion on consent for items 8 through 15.

04:52:25.740 --> 04:52:27.740
I'll move.

04:52:27.980 --> 04:52:32.220
Okay, we have a motion from member Rucker. Do I have a second? I'll second.

04:52:35.820 --> 04:52:41.420
All right, we'll take a second from member Navo, and is there any further discussion?

04:52:41.980 --> 04:52:45.980
All right, we'll take a roll call vote. Karen, please call the roll.

04:52:45.980 --> 04:52:47.980
Okay, Linda?

04:52:47.980 --> 04:52:49.980
Yes.

04:52:49.980 --> 04:52:51.980
Cynthia?

04:52:51.980 --> 04:52:53.980
Yes.

04:52:53.980 --> 04:52:55.980
Jim?

04:52:55.980 --> 04:52:57.980
Yes.

04:52:57.980 --> 04:52:59.980
Matt?

04:52:59.980 --> 04:53:01.980
Yes.

04:53:01.980 --> 04:53:03.980
Brenna?

04:53:03.980 --> 04:53:05.980
Yes.

04:53:05.980 --> 04:53:07.980
Kim?

04:53:07.980 --> 04:53:09.980
Yes.

04:53:10.140 --> 04:53:11.500
Eileen?

04:53:11.500 --> 04:53:12.780
Yes.

04:53:12.780 --> 04:53:14.460
Ting?

04:53:14.460 --> 04:53:15.500
Yes.

04:53:15.500 --> 04:53:17.500
Okay, unanimous.

04:53:18.220 --> 04:53:19.980
All right.

04:53:19.980 --> 04:53:28.460
At this point, we're going to proceed to get ready for two public hearings for items 16 and 17.

04:53:28.860 --> 04:53:33.500
We will take, because these may be long items, we will take a short break now.

04:53:34.620 --> 04:53:38.220
It is 2.27. Let's come back at about

04:53:39.180 --> 04:53:41.180
2.35.

04:53:41.580 --> 04:53:46.060
And we'll ask you to please turn off your microphones and your cameras and do not leave the room.

04:53:46.780 --> 04:53:51.980
I will see you back in a few minutes. Get yourselves ready. This will be a longer spell.

04:53:57.740 --> 04:54:00.780
All right, we are reassembled. Are we live?

04:54:03.100 --> 04:54:05.100
Give us a minute here, Linda. We'll make sure.

04:54:05.100 --> 04:54:07.100
Okay. Okay.

04:54:08.220 --> 04:54:14.220
Yes. Okay. We're live.

04:54:15.260 --> 04:54:24.060
Okay. Agenda item 16 is a public hearing regarding petition for the establishment of a charter

04:54:24.060 --> 04:54:29.980
school under the oversight of the State Board of Education, consideration of Pinecrest Expedition

04:54:29.980 --> 04:54:36.300
Academy, which was denied by the Twain Heart School District and the Tulum County Superintendent

04:54:36.300 --> 04:54:42.220
Schools. The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request

04:54:42.220 --> 04:54:48.140
to establish Pinecrest Expedition Academy, a TKK through grade eight charter school,

04:54:48.140 --> 04:54:52.140
and this item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

04:54:55.020 --> 04:55:01.340
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, board members, and welcome to the newly appointed

04:55:01.340 --> 04:55:09.020
board members. Before we get started on the Pinecrest appeal item, because we have three

04:55:09.020 --> 04:55:17.580
new board members joining us for the first time, I wanted to do a quick overview of the charter

04:55:17.580 --> 04:55:24.220
school process, authorization process, and appeals process to the State Board before we get started.

04:55:24.780 --> 04:55:35.100
Okay. So I'm going to go over the authorization process, and I want to be clear that this is the

04:55:35.100 --> 04:55:42.540
authorization process that was used for the five appeals before the State Board during this meeting

04:55:44.220 --> 04:55:52.940
pre-AB 1505. So I know July 1, some new laws went into effect, but we are using the pre-AB 1505

04:55:52.940 --> 04:55:59.180
criteria for review and renewal and appeals. So that's what we're going to go over today.

04:55:59.820 --> 04:56:08.620
Rest assured you all will be getting a workshop or a review of the new process in the coming months,

04:56:08.620 --> 04:56:14.540
but for today it's just pre-AB 1505. So we're going to talk about appeals to the State Board,

04:56:14.540 --> 04:56:21.020
the types of appeals that we receive, a quick little summary of what the State Board currently

04:56:21.020 --> 04:56:30.860
has as you're off to price schools, and the role of CDE in the charter schools division.

04:56:33.980 --> 04:56:39.500
So we have two types of appeals that come to the State Board. We have establishment appeals,

04:56:40.220 --> 04:56:47.180
which is a new school that was denied at the local level and has come to the State Board,

04:56:47.180 --> 04:56:51.820
and then renewal schools. So schools that were up for renewal denied at the local level and have

04:56:51.820 --> 04:56:58.140
come to the State Board for authorization, and then revocations of charter schools that happen

04:56:58.140 --> 04:57:06.780
at the local level and are appealed to the State Board. When petitions come to the State Board and

04:57:06.780 --> 04:57:14.540
if the charter school division finds that the recommendation will be to deny, that can only

04:57:14.540 --> 04:57:20.300
happen with written factual findings. Those findings include whether the charter school

04:57:20.300 --> 04:57:25.420
presents an unsound educational program, the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to

04:57:25.420 --> 04:57:30.620
successfully implement the program, the petition does not contain the required numbers of signatures,

04:57:30.620 --> 04:57:37.260
the petition does not contain an affirmation of specified assurances, and the petition does

04:57:37.260 --> 04:57:43.580
not contain reasonably comprehensive description of the 15 required elements of a charter petition.

04:57:43.580 --> 04:57:47.820
So those are the findings that we must find and the Board must find in order to deny a charter

04:57:47.820 --> 04:57:56.460
school at this level. For renewals, if renewals are granted by the authorizers for a period not

04:57:56.460 --> 04:58:02.700
to exceed five years, the Board does consider increases in pupil academic achievement for all

04:58:02.700 --> 04:58:08.460
groups of pupils served by the charter school as the most important factor. The State Board does

04:58:08.540 --> 04:58:14.860
also consider past performance of the school's academics, their finances, their operations,

04:58:14.860 --> 04:58:21.340
which also includes their governance, and future plans for improvement. Charter schools authorized

04:58:21.340 --> 04:58:26.220
by the State Board are required to submit a renewal petition to the local authority that

04:58:26.220 --> 04:58:36.860
originally denied the charter. So academic renewal criteria under Ed Code 47607, as I said, this is

04:58:37.420 --> 04:58:45.660
pre-1505, this has since changed, but before, and it's kind of an odd thing because some of

04:58:45.660 --> 04:58:52.380
this is way out of date, as you will see. Academic renewal criteria before, schools needed to meet at

04:58:52.380 --> 04:59:00.300
least one of the four criteria, which you can see the first three are, were based on the API, which

04:59:00.300 --> 04:59:06.060
has not been in existence for quite some time. So because of that suspension of the API and that we

04:59:06.060 --> 04:59:11.580
no longer use that, those first three renewal requirements or criteria are no longer

04:59:13.900 --> 04:59:19.340
applicable. However, the fourth one is what we are currently using and is what we used for the

04:59:20.220 --> 04:59:25.500
renewal charters that are before you tomorrow, and that is the entity that granted the charter

04:59:25.500 --> 04:59:29.980
determines that the academic performance of the charter school is at least equal to the academic

04:59:29.980 --> 04:59:34.700
performance of the public schools that the charter school students would otherwise have

04:59:34.700 --> 04:59:39.180
been required to attend, as well as the academic performance of the schools in the school district

04:59:39.180 --> 04:59:43.100
in which the charter school is located, taking into account the composition of the student

04:59:43.100 --> 04:59:50.620
population that is served at the charter school. So when we look at renewals under the pre-1505

04:59:50.620 --> 04:59:56.700
criteria, we are looking at comparable school performance across the district where the

04:59:56.700 --> 05:00:03.660
charter school is located compared to the charter school. And that academic renewal criteria is

05:00:03.660 --> 05:00:09.260
really the threshold. So you must meet that academic renewal criteria in order to be considered

05:00:09.260 --> 05:00:13.100
for renewal and approval, but it's not the only thing that we look at.

05:00:15.580 --> 05:00:22.700
Also, we can look at alternative measures. Since the API, as I said, is old criteria and it hasn't

05:00:22.700 --> 05:00:30.140
been calculated for many years, Ed Code 52052F allows for alternative measures to show increases

05:00:30.140 --> 05:00:35.980
in pupil academic achievement. And there are listed there some of the types of alternative

05:00:35.980 --> 05:00:40.940
measures we look at, which graduation rates. We now look at dashboard results, dropout rates,

05:00:42.300 --> 05:00:46.220
internal benchmark data from the charter schools themselves, suspension expulsion rates,

05:00:47.020 --> 05:00:54.460
those types of data. The appeal timelines, petitioners submit to the local district for

05:00:54.460 --> 05:00:59.420
review and approval. If they're denied, they can elect to appeal to the County Board of Education

05:01:00.140 --> 05:01:06.460
within 180 days. If denied by the county, petitioner can elect to appeal to the state board.

05:01:06.460 --> 05:01:11.420
Appeals must be received by the state board no later than 180 calendar days after the denial by

05:01:11.420 --> 05:01:17.820
the county. State board has 120 days to act on the appeal and the state board conducts a de novo

05:01:17.820 --> 05:01:26.460
review, which means a new review, a brand new review. We do obviously take into account the

05:01:26.460 --> 05:01:31.900
findings from the local district and we take into account responses from the charter school,

05:01:31.900 --> 05:01:36.060
but the Department of Ed Charter School Division does do an independent analysis of the petition.

05:01:37.180 --> 05:01:41.740
And as I mentioned earlier, written factual findings are required for the denial of the petition.

05:01:43.740 --> 05:01:50.140
So currently, so this, we're just brand new into July and this slide is a little off because we've

05:01:50.140 --> 05:01:56.380
had a few charter schools close, state board authorized charter schools. So I'm going to

05:01:56.380 --> 05:02:02.540
correct this slide just verbally and say that we currently have 25 state board of education

05:02:03.500 --> 05:02:10.380
authorized charter schools. We have three charter school division consultants who provide ongoing

05:02:10.380 --> 05:02:16.540
technical assistance and support and site visits to the state board authorized charter schools.

05:02:16.540 --> 05:02:21.820
We have one statewide benefit charter which includes nine sites and we have seven all

05:02:21.820 --> 05:02:28.940
charter districts which includes a total of 18 schools and those are authorized by the state

05:02:28.940 --> 05:02:36.620
board of Ed with oversight conducted by county offices of education. The role of the department,

05:02:37.180 --> 05:02:41.580
CDE charter schools division as staff to the state board thoroughly review and analyze all

05:02:41.580 --> 05:02:46.220
the appeal documents including the educational program, academic performance, fiscal viability,

05:02:46.220 --> 05:02:51.660
and prior history. Appeals first are presented to the advisory commission on charter schools

05:02:51.660 --> 05:02:59.820
who hears all of the appeals in a very similar manner into which you do and provide a recommendation

05:02:59.820 --> 05:03:08.220
to you, the board, for each of the appeals they hear and then we present them to the state board

05:03:08.300 --> 05:03:16.380
for action. The charter schools division provides oversight to charters approved by the state board

05:03:17.260 --> 05:03:21.580
and then we do that through monthly calls, annual site visits, review of all the fiscal reports that

05:03:21.580 --> 05:03:28.940
are required to be submitted annually, technical assistance, and then we also provide the following

05:03:28.940 --> 05:03:33.740
annual memos to the state board on their state board approved charters, an annual review

05:03:33.740 --> 05:03:38.540
of each school's academic performance, and an annual review of each school's fiscal viability.

05:03:43.020 --> 05:03:49.420
So that is a quick overview for board members.

05:03:52.700 --> 05:03:58.620
Now I'm going to go to item 16. Are there any questions about the overview?

05:03:58.940 --> 05:04:07.500
No, but thank you for that. Okay, great. Okay, so item 16 is petition, it's a petition for the

05:04:07.500 --> 05:04:15.500
establishment of Pine Crest Expedition Academy. They are seeking authorization for from the state

05:04:15.500 --> 05:04:20.860
board to establish a transitional TK through grade eight charter school within the boundaries of the

05:04:20.860 --> 05:04:26.620
Twain Hart School District. The petitioner submitted their petition previously to the Twain

05:04:26.620 --> 05:04:33.740
Hart School District on November 20th and were denied 2019. They then chose to move to the

05:04:33.740 --> 05:04:39.740
Tuolumne County Board of Education on February 3rd, where they were also denied and they appealed

05:04:39.740 --> 05:04:46.940
to the state e-mail address. The petitioner submitted their petition previously to the

05:04:47.260 --> 05:04:54.300
state board and we received their appeal on February 20th, 2020.

05:04:57.020 --> 05:05:02.700
The CDE recommends that the state board hold their public hearing to deny the request to establish

05:05:03.420 --> 05:05:08.860
Pine Crest Academy a TK through grade eight charter school under the oversight of the SBE.

05:05:11.260 --> 05:05:16.780
As I stated in the overview, this did go to the advisory commission on charter schools

05:05:17.020 --> 05:05:24.140
in June. They met and they heard the appeal and the ACCS moved the CDE

05:05:24.140 --> 05:05:31.660
recommendation to deny the request to establish the Pine Crest Academy petition by a vote of eight to one.

05:05:36.380 --> 05:05:41.500
The CDE's, our basis for recommendation is the petition does not present a sound educational

05:05:41.500 --> 05:05:47.580
program. The petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program

05:05:47.580 --> 05:05:52.540
and the petition does not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of all required 15

05:05:52.540 --> 05:05:58.940
charter elements. A little background on the school and what their mission and vision are,

05:06:00.620 --> 05:06:07.820
it is a rural area and they do plan to, their plan is to do some

05:06:08.780 --> 05:06:14.220
expedition type program from their school. They want to inspire a diverse group of learners to

05:06:14.220 --> 05:06:18.780
achieve academic excellence while developing a strong sense of character and community.

05:06:18.780 --> 05:06:26.140
They intend to open with 52 students in TK through grade eight and grow to serve 65 students in TK

05:06:26.140 --> 05:06:33.180
through grade eight by 2024-25. They plan to, their intention is to offer a site-based

05:06:33.340 --> 05:06:34.940
and independent study program.

05:06:42.140 --> 05:06:48.700
A little more detail in our findings, unsound educational program. The petitioner is

05:06:50.060 --> 05:06:55.980
intending to offer the following, two multi-grade classrooms for 52 pupils, TK through eight.

05:06:57.340 --> 05:07:01.980
The petition does not describe how instruction will take place with the anticipated gaps in

05:07:01.980 --> 05:07:08.620
learning, age, and instructional approaches based on the target student population. They do plan on

05:07:08.620 --> 05:07:14.060
their independent study program, will have a home study program component as a choice for families,

05:07:14.060 --> 05:07:19.020
but the petition did not give a comprehensive description of how that model will include,

05:07:20.380 --> 05:07:25.100
including in pupil enrollment numbers, how they plan to implement their instructional

05:07:25.100 --> 05:07:29.740
model or how all pupils will be adequately served. Additionally, the petition does not

05:07:29.740 --> 05:07:33.420
sufficiently describe how and when English learners will receive targeted English language

05:07:33.420 --> 05:07:40.060
development instruction. I would say this petition was very weak in details. The petitioners have very

05:07:40.060 --> 05:07:48.620
little education experience in terms of their petition, the petitioners and the board that

05:07:48.620 --> 05:07:54.380
they have put together. Very few have education experience and it shows in the lack of detail

05:07:54.380 --> 05:08:03.100
and description of the program implementation. They intended to open this August. Obviously,

05:08:03.100 --> 05:08:13.660
that's up in the air. SB 98 allows new schools to put off their opening date for a year, so that's

05:08:13.660 --> 05:08:21.900
something that can be considered, but we did have a lot of concerns regarding their ability

05:08:22.860 --> 05:08:27.980
to recruit staff, create a high-quality instructional program, and administer two

05:08:27.980 --> 05:08:34.460
separate educational programs really within their school, the home study option and the site-based

05:08:34.460 --> 05:08:42.860
classroom option, which really doesn't, our concerns are not alleviated by putting off opening a year.

05:08:42.860 --> 05:08:52.700
Inability to implement in terms of their budgeting. Obviously, we've had COVID-19 has

05:08:52.700 --> 05:09:01.180
impacted school budgets and charter school budgets. There was a large variation between

05:09:01.180 --> 05:09:05.740
the governor's proposed budget and the proposed May revision, and now we have an agreement that

05:09:05.740 --> 05:09:14.140
includes deferrals for 2021. That is definitely something that will affect charter schools,

05:09:14.940 --> 05:09:21.820
and it's something that they will have to consider if approved. They already have a burden of

05:09:21.820 --> 05:09:28.140
fronting cash and maintaining cash flow just on the regular with this particular school, so

05:09:28.140 --> 05:09:32.860
add deferrals to that, and it can be really detrimental.

05:09:35.260 --> 05:09:43.900
Our original budget that they submitted to us with their petition is not viable. As you can

05:09:43.900 --> 05:09:49.180
see here, they have negative ending fund balances for the first three years of operation with no

05:09:49.180 --> 05:09:59.740
reserves at all. I think it goes back to the lack of experience within the petitioners

05:10:02.140 --> 05:10:07.980
that they, in the budget that they did give us for revenue and expenditures,

05:10:07.980 --> 05:10:13.580
they overstated by quite a bit their LCFF revenue and the funds they would get from the lottery,

05:10:13.580 --> 05:10:22.540
and they understated what their expenditures would be, which really leads us to not be confident

05:10:22.540 --> 05:10:30.780
that they would be able to implement their program. The petition does state that non-certificated

05:10:30.780 --> 05:10:35.900
full-time staff shall participate in CalPERS and federal social security, although the petition

05:10:35.900 --> 05:10:42.460
and the budget did not project any expenditures for CalPERS, and they did not project any startup

05:10:42.460 --> 05:10:47.500
funds. I think their intention is to apply for the Charter School Revolving Loan Fund in 2021,

05:10:47.500 --> 05:10:57.020
if obviously those dates are a little in flux right now. They also had very several deficiencies

05:10:57.020 --> 05:11:03.500
in the charter elements in terms of reasonably comprehensive descriptions. Description of the

05:11:03.500 --> 05:11:10.620
educational program, as I've said before, it was very a weak description, insufficient description

05:11:10.620 --> 05:11:18.220
of the multi-grade instructional program, not a strong description of how English learners

05:11:18.220 --> 05:11:23.900
will be educated. They did not include a framework for instructional design, especially with the fact

05:11:23.900 --> 05:11:32.780
that they're having two separate types of programs within their school, and then also, as I said,

05:11:32.780 --> 05:11:39.980
the English language development instruction was not sufficient. Measurable pupil outcomes,

05:11:39.980 --> 05:11:45.660
they do plan to reside within the Twain Hart School District, which is only comprised of 257

05:11:45.660 --> 05:11:53.740
students, 58% of which identify as socioeconomically disadvantaged. However, their petition does not

05:11:53.740 --> 05:12:02.860
outline pupil outcomes for this group or for any groups of peoples. Charter elements 5, 10, and 14,

05:12:02.940 --> 05:12:09.900
employee qualifications. The petition does not describe general specifications and qualifications

05:12:09.900 --> 05:12:15.580
for non-certificated and certificated employees. Their suspension and expulsion procedures were

05:12:15.580 --> 05:12:19.900
weak, and the dispute resolution procedures does not include all the necessary language for those

05:12:19.900 --> 05:12:29.260
elements. The CDE recommends that the State Board deny the petition to establish Pinecrest

05:12:29.900 --> 05:12:34.380
Academy, as the petition does not provide a sound educational program. The petitioner is

05:12:34.380 --> 05:12:38.940
demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program, and the petition does not

05:12:38.940 --> 05:12:47.900
provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements. Okay, thank you very much,

05:12:47.900 --> 05:12:56.220
Stephanie. At this time, I'll open the public hearing at 2.54 p.m. First, we'll hear from the

05:12:56.220 --> 05:13:02.140
petitioners. The petitioners will have 12 minutes. Then we will note that we're allocating an

05:13:02.140 --> 05:13:08.300
additional two minutes to each side because of technological delay. Then we'll hear from the

05:13:08.300 --> 05:13:13.100
district and the county that are opposing the petition. Together, they will also have a total

05:13:13.100 --> 05:13:18.380
of 12 minutes. After the presentations from both sides, there will be an opportunity for public

05:13:18.380 --> 05:13:23.740
comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each. So we'll

05:13:24.460 --> 05:13:34.780
invite the petitioners to the podium at this time, or to their Zoom location.

05:13:39.900 --> 05:13:45.020
Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Heidi Lupo,

05:13:45.020 --> 05:13:50.620
and I am the lead petitioner for the Pinecrest Expedition Academy. My screen should be sharing

05:13:50.620 --> 05:13:56.780
at this time. Can someone confirm that maybe it is? Okay. The picture you see on the cover is a

05:13:56.780 --> 05:14:02.780
picture of the Pinecrest area from last winter under substantial snow, which is indicative of

05:14:02.780 --> 05:14:10.300
where Pinecrest is and some of the difficulties that we face by our location. I've shown on this

05:14:10.300 --> 05:14:16.060
next slide some of the driving distances from the Pinecrest area to more urbanized locations in

05:14:16.140 --> 05:14:22.140
California, which you may be more familiar with. As a general rule, Pinecrest is at least 25 to 30

05:14:22.140 --> 05:14:28.780
miles from other more populated areas. So you may be asking yourself, why do we need a school in

05:14:28.780 --> 05:14:36.220
Pinecrest? Why are there even people there? Pinecrest is a very popular tourism destination on

05:14:36.220 --> 05:14:44.060
Upper 108, our highway. And because of that, we see a large influx of visitors, both in the

05:14:44.780 --> 05:14:52.220
summer and wintertime, and have a substantial amount of businesses and high tax-based homes

05:14:52.220 --> 05:14:59.660
in our area. Our community provides a great deal of support to Tuolumne County and our $240 million

05:14:59.660 --> 05:15:07.500
tourism industry. The realities of our location bring into account that our proximity matters.

05:15:07.500 --> 05:15:13.660
There's a significant distance from the Pinecrest area to other schools, such as the

05:15:13.660 --> 05:15:20.140
Twinhart School District. It's at least 20 miles from all areas, and for some of us, even closer

05:15:20.140 --> 05:15:27.260
to 30 miles. So the development of this petition is Pinecrest Expedition Academy. Why this school?

05:15:27.260 --> 05:15:33.740
Why here? We have an active outdoor community similar to areas like South Lake Tahoe or Truckee.

05:15:33.740 --> 05:15:41.340
Our curriculum from EL Education is innovative. It's unique. It encompasses outdoor classrooms,

05:15:41.340 --> 05:15:45.580
project-based learning, and a relationship directly to our community.

05:15:46.620 --> 05:15:53.340
The slides I'm showing now are our facility. This is the former site of a district Pinecrest

05:15:53.340 --> 05:15:59.740
Elementary School located within the Pinecrest area. This is a 10,000 square foot facility that

05:15:59.740 --> 05:16:06.140
is now privately owned. This facility is available to us under a lease. As you can see,

05:16:06.140 --> 05:16:12.860
the facility is comprised of three classrooms in the main building and one exterior portable

05:16:12.860 --> 05:16:20.620
classroom. It has a play structure, a multi-purpose room, office space, and outdoor space. This

05:16:20.620 --> 05:16:26.700
property sits on nearly five acres in the town of Strawberry, which is three miles from Pinecrest.

05:16:26.700 --> 05:16:31.660
There's been a lot said about our lack of educational experience and our lack of charter

05:16:31.660 --> 05:16:40.140
school experience, and I can't tell you otherwise. I can tell you that we are business leaders.

05:16:40.140 --> 05:16:45.500
We have substantial nonprofit experience. They are a highly responsible group of people

05:16:45.500 --> 05:16:51.980
who understands accountability and transparency, and Peggy Herndon and our new board member Chris

05:16:52.780 --> 05:16:57.980
and our new board member Chris do bring substantial education experience to our board.

05:16:58.700 --> 05:17:05.900
The petition was designed uniquely because we do have a low student count and our staff is unique.

05:17:05.900 --> 05:17:11.900
It has a lead teacher designed to serve as a principal and a classroom teacher, a business

05:17:11.900 --> 05:17:17.180
operations manager to oversee some of the back office and business end of the school,

05:17:17.980 --> 05:17:24.780
second classroom teacher, and two part-time independent study teachers to oversee

05:17:24.780 --> 05:17:30.460
the independent study program as well as being able to serve in the classroom as substitute

05:17:30.460 --> 05:17:36.460
teachers and assist with special education as needed, and an administrative assistant who can

05:17:36.460 --> 05:17:44.700
also serve in the classroom as a teacher's aide if and when needed. This petition was developed

05:17:44.780 --> 05:17:51.980
to be by using the EL education design principles. There are several EL education charter schools in

05:17:51.980 --> 05:17:59.420
California. The principles behind their program focus on these that I have put up on the screen,

05:17:59.420 --> 05:18:05.180
the primacy of self-learning, having wonderful ideas, responsibility for learning, empathy and

05:18:05.180 --> 05:18:12.140
caring, success and failure, collaboration and competition, diversity and inclusion, the natural

05:18:12.140 --> 05:18:18.140
world, solitude and reflection, service and compassion. These building blocks build upon

05:18:18.140 --> 05:18:23.660
the whole curriculum which is based in project-based learning and learning outside of the traditional

05:18:23.660 --> 05:18:29.820
classroom. This encompasses case studies, field work, collaboration and service learning with

05:18:29.820 --> 05:18:35.580
other area agencies and businesses. We have agencies such as the United States Forest Service,

05:18:35.580 --> 05:18:41.340
the Strawberry Fire Protection District, Tridam Project, which is a major hydroelectric project

05:18:41.340 --> 05:18:46.460
in Strawberry, and other local businesses such as Pinecrest Lake Resort and Dodgewood Ski Area

05:18:47.340 --> 05:18:51.180
very actively interested in being collaborators with this program.

05:18:52.300 --> 05:18:57.900
The instruction and design is designed to run two lateral programs, a site-based program and a

05:18:57.900 --> 05:19:04.140
homeschool program. The homeschool or independent study program was envisioned so that each student

05:19:04.140 --> 05:19:10.620
has a scheduled weekly meeting with their teacher using the same curriculum modified as needed as

05:19:10.620 --> 05:19:16.620
we are using in the classroom. The homeschool students would be eligible to participate in the

05:19:16.620 --> 05:19:21.820
learning expeditions that occur outside of the classroom with the site-based students.

05:19:22.540 --> 05:19:29.420
Multi-grade classrooms are decidedly unique. Everyone knows that. We understand that we will

05:19:29.420 --> 05:19:35.260
meet the needs through standards-based instruction, rotating daily whole group and differentiating

05:19:35.340 --> 05:19:39.740
small group instruction based on data from assessments that are ongoing.

05:19:40.780 --> 05:19:47.660
COVID-19 has obviously posed unique circumstances to every one of us in everyday life. However,

05:19:47.660 --> 05:19:54.140
we feel that our program is very well poised to navigate COVID-19 and close gaps that are

05:19:54.140 --> 05:20:01.260
left by the district and that the district only has one main campus, no ongoing independent study

05:20:01.260 --> 05:20:07.740
program and no satellite campuses either. This program is designed to have a smaller school

05:20:08.380 --> 05:20:15.500
with adequate spacing in our facility, the ability to use outdoor classrooms, a smaller staff

05:20:15.500 --> 05:20:20.940
and an easy transition to distance learning if and when needed thanks to the independent study

05:20:20.940 --> 05:20:27.820
homeschool program already built in. A lot of you will ask where do these students go to school now?

05:20:28.380 --> 05:20:34.860
Many of them have transferred out of the district to provide for other opportunities with emergency

05:20:34.860 --> 05:20:39.500
contacts. It's hard to be 30 miles from your student when they're in elementary school.

05:20:39.500 --> 05:20:45.340
They need something throughout the day. Many of these kids are homeschooled without using a public

05:20:45.340 --> 05:20:50.700
school program at this time and we also have a large amount of parents who drive into our area

05:20:50.700 --> 05:20:57.740
and work who would prefer to have their kids go to school close to the workplace. The financial

05:20:58.060 --> 05:21:06.700
viability of our budget is there. We did qualify on June 25th, 2020 for the $250,000 charter school

05:21:06.700 --> 05:21:13.020
revolving loan. That money was removed from the budget that we submitted to CDE and that created

05:21:13.020 --> 05:21:19.340
the negative fund balances. The county found a deficiency in special education. We have included

05:21:19.340 --> 05:21:28.540
12.37% for special education funds including $29,952 which would be listed for AB 602

05:21:28.540 --> 05:21:36.060
and $44,928 for encroachment. The original budget assumed that the SELPA would act as a

05:21:36.060 --> 05:21:46.060
pass-through and intercept the AB 602 funds. On the screen is a revision to the LCFF money based on

05:21:46.060 --> 05:21:55.900
the May 20 calculator. I believe the calculator is version 21.1a. When including the $250,000

05:21:55.900 --> 05:22:02.540
charter school revolving loan, we do have positive reserve balances. They are substantial.

05:22:03.820 --> 05:22:11.260
Our startup costs are minimal as our facility is actually already very well equipped with desks,

05:22:11.260 --> 05:22:17.340
chairs, library books. We have a substantial amount of computers that are up to par which

05:22:17.340 --> 05:22:26.140
have been given to us from the community. I ask you to consider what it is like for these kids

05:22:26.140 --> 05:22:32.780
to travel huge amounts of time, what it's like for their parents not to be directly involved

05:22:32.780 --> 05:22:39.340
in their education and see the importance of this school in this location and know that our business

05:22:39.340 --> 05:22:45.980
sense is capable of hiring the appropriate people needed to run this school so that it

05:22:45.980 --> 05:22:54.220
is successful and academically and financially very viable. I look forward to your questions

05:22:54.220 --> 05:23:03.980
to myself and our board members on this call. All right. I think now we're going to hear from

05:23:03.980 --> 05:23:21.020
the district and the county. Hello? We're having a hard time hearing.

05:23:22.060 --> 05:23:25.340
Well, I want to make sure. Can you hear me? This is Rick Hanna, superintendent.

05:23:26.700 --> 05:23:30.540
I can hear you, yes. Would you like me to proceed?

05:23:31.260 --> 05:23:35.260
Stay here for an hour. Somebody is talking in the background then.

05:23:35.260 --> 05:23:41.900
It's not me. It's not. I'm by myself. Okay. Everyone else, please mute and please continue.

05:23:41.900 --> 05:23:48.220
Thank you. I am Rick Hanna, superintendent of the Twainheart School District. Our district spent a

05:23:48.220 --> 05:23:53.340
great deal of money and time to develop our summary of findings, which I believe you have

05:23:53.340 --> 05:23:59.500
reviewed as well as your advisory committee. Back in 2018, this petition was presented to

05:23:59.500 --> 05:24:06.140
the Twainheart School Board and was denied 5-0. It came back with only one change, and that was

05:24:06.140 --> 05:24:11.580
the addition of an independent study program, which in our opinion is very unreliable and

05:24:11.580 --> 05:24:20.380
unpredictable. It was denied by our board by 5-0 vote. As Kathy Parker will talk to the county

05:24:20.380 --> 05:24:27.660
superintendent and county office of education denied it by a 6-0 vote. Your advisory committee

05:24:27.660 --> 05:24:35.420
denied it by an 8-1 vote. Before I go on, I want just to present that, please pay attention that

05:24:35.420 --> 05:24:43.020
that's only received one positive vote in this process. I've continued to question the number of

05:24:43.020 --> 05:24:51.500
enrollees that the petition has stated. I at one time authenticated, and I didn't authenticate,

05:24:51.500 --> 05:24:58.540
but more than 20-21 kids, but that's debatable. I'm still not sure that those students are there.

05:24:59.340 --> 05:25:05.020
One of the businesses, Genest Park, which was going to provide a substantial number of students

05:25:05.020 --> 05:25:12.140
to the charter, or as they hoped, has closed down out of business, and I don't know that the petitioner

05:25:12.140 --> 05:25:17.260
has mentioned that, but I think that's going to have a big impact on the small number of students

05:25:17.260 --> 05:25:23.820
they're already looking at. The charter is alluding to the concerns about the distances from

05:25:25.340 --> 05:25:30.460
our school to the Pinecrest area, but I want to point out that the charter provides no

05:25:30.460 --> 05:25:37.100
busing at all in the petition, where we do drive up and pick up the students. We firmly believe

05:25:37.100 --> 05:25:43.340
that driving the bus in any snowy conditions, it's not as far as the petitioner states, is much safer

05:25:43.340 --> 05:25:52.540
than private automobiles. And lastly, we continue to question the fiscal stability of the petition.

05:25:52.540 --> 05:26:00.300
Thank you. Thank you. Are we hearing from a county administrator? Yes, my name is Kathy Parker. I am

05:26:00.300 --> 05:26:06.460
the county superintendent of schools. Just to give a little history of the Ptolemy County Board of

05:26:06.460 --> 05:26:14.220
Education, they have supported two charter school petitions on appeal. Both were the only

05:26:14.220 --> 05:26:20.300
charter schools that came on appeal, and both were approved in the past, Golden Lakes Charter School

05:26:20.300 --> 05:26:27.580
and Foothill Leadership. So they have a history of supporting alternative education models in

05:26:27.580 --> 05:26:34.620
our county and support innovative practices. However, when this academy was first

05:26:35.420 --> 05:26:42.300
coming to the county on appeal in 2018, in that particular review, we found a lot of the same

05:26:42.300 --> 05:26:47.420
deficiencies that we found in this current review, which was done as a de novo review as well.

05:26:48.700 --> 05:26:53.580
The main concerns are some of the things that have been highlighted by

05:26:53.580 --> 05:26:58.700
the commission, the CDE, and also the LEA Twain Heart School District.

05:26:59.340 --> 05:27:08.140
Setting aside the educational program concerns, the amount of money that is set aside for

05:27:08.140 --> 05:27:17.500
special education in that particular budget is woefully deficient. We have about a 13-14 percent

05:27:17.500 --> 05:27:24.460
identification rate for special education students in Ptolemy County. We also have an allocation

05:27:24.460 --> 05:27:30.780
that districts need to build in. We sweep basically all of their special education funds

05:27:30.780 --> 05:27:38.860
and do a bill back to districts of approximately $750 per ADA to provide moderate to severely

05:27:38.860 --> 05:27:43.820
disabled student services in our county. The county office provides all of those services,

05:27:43.820 --> 05:27:49.660
so independent living skills, nexus programs for students with emotional disturbances,

05:27:49.740 --> 05:27:52.860
structured preschool programs. The county office provides it all.

05:27:54.140 --> 05:28:01.100
Districts have to use their general fund dollars to provide support for special education services

05:28:01.100 --> 05:28:07.820
offered at a district level. In addition, they have to pay $750 per ADA to support the cost of

05:28:08.620 --> 05:28:11.900
providing services for students with moderate to severe disabilities.

05:28:12.780 --> 05:28:18.540
That was a piece in the budget that was very concerning. In addition, there were no contingencies

05:28:18.540 --> 05:28:24.540
for students who may qualify for additional services such as speech, OT, adaptive PE,

05:28:24.540 --> 05:28:30.700
or for students who might be placed into a program offered by the county office because

05:28:30.700 --> 05:28:37.740
then there is a cost associated for that as well. Additionally, we're concerned about the

05:28:37.740 --> 05:28:43.500
employee qualifications. These concerns were brought up by the CDE. We're concerned about the

05:28:43.500 --> 05:28:49.180
racial, ethnic, special education, and EL balance requirements in a petition. But again,

05:28:49.180 --> 05:28:56.620
it all comes back to the operational budget and the startup budget. And while the county office

05:28:57.420 --> 05:29:03.100
reviewed this petition separate from the previous petition that had been submitted,

05:29:03.660 --> 05:29:10.060
we also identified that there wasn't much of a difference between the one petition that had

05:29:10.060 --> 05:29:16.700
been submitted and this new petition. We feel that they are unlikely to successfully implement

05:29:16.700 --> 05:29:24.220
the program. And so as a result, the county board denied the petition. It was a 6-0 vote with one

05:29:24.220 --> 05:29:32.620
of our board members abstaining from the vote. And that's my contribution to this conversation.

05:29:32.620 --> 05:29:33.500
Unless you have questions.

05:29:34.460 --> 05:29:39.980
Thank you very much. Well, we're going to prepare now for public comment before we raise any other

05:29:39.980 --> 05:29:46.780
questions. We're going to open the phone line for the public comment queue. And if somebody can put

05:29:46.780 --> 05:29:54.540
up that slide again so that folks who are watching can see it. Members of the public wishing to

05:29:54.540 --> 05:30:07.820
provide comment may do so by calling 712-432-0075. Enter the access code 651-905 pound. Wait for the

05:30:07.820 --> 05:30:13.020
operator prompts to press star six and then another prompt to press one to enter the queue.

05:30:14.300 --> 05:30:17.340
We encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:30:18.140 --> 05:30:22.780
And please remember to turn down the volume on your computer if you're following the live feed.

05:30:23.340 --> 05:30:27.260
Speakers will be limited to one minute each. Are there any public comments?

05:30:29.340 --> 05:30:31.420
Yes, we do have public comments for this item.

05:30:32.540 --> 05:30:40.940
All right. And do you want to put up the public comment slide? I'm not seeing it. Thank you. Okay.

05:30:40.940 --> 05:31:01.260
Hello, my name is John Lupo. Thank you for taking my call.

05:31:02.380 --> 05:31:08.540
I support the petition to establish the Pine Crest Expedition Academy. The Pine Crest community

05:31:08.540 --> 05:31:15.500
desperately needs this school culturally and economically. And more importantly, by creating

05:31:15.500 --> 05:31:21.500
the opportunity for children to attend school where their families and friends live and work,

05:31:21.500 --> 05:31:26.700
you will be offering these people the choice to determine the environment where learning best

05:31:26.700 --> 05:31:33.820
occurs. You can help make their lives better. So I respectfully request that you work with Heidi

05:31:33.820 --> 05:31:39.580
and her team and approve, at least conditionally, this petition. Thank you.

05:31:42.300 --> 05:31:45.660
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

05:31:45.660 --> 05:31:53.660
Your time starts now.

05:31:59.420 --> 05:32:03.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:32:03.820 --> 05:32:13.740
State board members, this is Sheila Whitley and I represent the California Teachers Association.

05:32:13.740 --> 05:32:19.340
CTA recommends that the State Board of Education vote to deny this petition of establishment

05:32:19.340 --> 05:32:26.220
for Pine Crest Expedition Academy. We oppose this petition for the following reason. PEA does not

05:32:26.220 --> 05:32:33.420
represent a sound educational program and is demonstrably unlikely to implement the program

05:32:33.420 --> 05:32:39.340
set forth in this petition due to unrealistic financial and operational plans, including

05:32:39.340 --> 05:32:45.660
negative ending fund balances. Secondly, this petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive

05:32:45.660 --> 05:32:52.700
description of all the required elements 1, 2, 5, 10, and 14. Currently, Twain Hart School District

05:32:52.700 --> 05:33:00.060
serves only 257 students in K-8. Pine Crest is proposing to enroll 65 of these students

05:33:00.060 --> 05:33:05.980
in their K-8 petition. The physical impact of new charters, especially during the pandemic and these

05:33:05.980 --> 05:33:11.180
unusual budget times, is not prudent. Therefore, we recommend the State Board of Education deny

05:33:11.180 --> 05:33:20.620
Pine Crest petition. Thank you. We have no additional callers in the queue right now,

05:33:20.620 --> 05:33:24.220
but we do have additional callers on the line, so I'm going to check with them to see if they

05:33:24.220 --> 05:33:30.300
would like to provide public comments. Good afternoon, caller. Did you wish to make a comment

05:33:30.300 --> 05:33:47.980
on item 16? Caller, did you wish to make a comment on item 16? Good afternoon,

05:33:47.980 --> 05:33:53.260
caller. Did you wish to make a comment on item 16? Yes, I would like to, please.

05:33:54.700 --> 05:33:57.820
You may begin your comment now. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:33:59.100 --> 05:34:06.380
Hi, I'm Chuck Retwining. I'm a board member of the PEA. I'm sorry, sir. Can you please get closer to

05:34:06.380 --> 05:34:12.460
your phone or to your microphone? Sure. Can you hear me better now? That's better. Thank you.

05:34:13.420 --> 05:34:22.140
Thank you. I'm Chuck Retwining. I'm a board member of the PEA. I'm calling in favor of granting them

05:34:22.140 --> 05:34:29.340
the petition. I spent 21 years on the Tuolumne County Board of Education, and we've gone through

05:34:30.300 --> 05:34:38.300
several charter school applications, and I understand that Kathy is a little weary of them

05:34:38.380 --> 05:34:45.900
because two of the last ones we approved failed. I've been out of the County Board of

05:34:46.940 --> 05:34:52.220
Education for a year now, so I haven't been following what's going on. There's lots of

05:34:52.220 --> 05:34:57.580
unique things that are offered being in the mountains. Some of you probably would love to

05:34:57.580 --> 05:35:04.540
have grown up or raised your kids in an environment like we have where it's safe and sane and in the

05:35:04.540 --> 05:35:13.260
mountains, and it's a great area for raising kids. Hence, we need a school for them. In the

05:35:13.260 --> 05:35:27.820
six years the school has been gone. That's your time, caller. Thank you for your call. Thank you.

05:35:29.500 --> 05:35:33.340
That concludes all of the public comments on the conference line.

05:35:35.100 --> 05:35:41.420
Okay. Given that there's no other public comment, I hereby close the public hearing for this item

05:35:41.980 --> 05:35:48.940
at 317 p.m. and we'll commence with board discussion and action. First, I want to ask Ting's

05:35:48.940 --> 05:35:54.220
son as our state board liaison if she has any initial comments. Then we'll ask board members

05:35:54.220 --> 05:36:00.940
if they have any clarifying questions or comments as part of our board discussion. Ting? Hi.

05:36:01.340 --> 05:36:08.940
Hi. I wanted to start my remarks with maybe adding a little bit to what Stephanie had

05:36:09.740 --> 05:36:16.380
described about the state board process because we do have some new members. One of the things

05:36:16.380 --> 05:36:24.540
I wanted to emphasize and to remind our board is that these appeals, these petitions that come

05:36:24.540 --> 05:36:32.380
before us are de novo reviews, so we're not looking at how it was reviewed by others,

05:36:32.380 --> 05:36:38.780
but looking at a brand new fresh look at the petition in the process. The other that I don't

05:36:38.780 --> 05:36:45.420
think was mentioned is that under current law, which is what we are looking at under the reviews

05:36:45.420 --> 05:36:51.420
under which we're looking at these petitions and appeals, is that it actually does compel

05:36:52.220 --> 05:36:58.860
the authorizer, the reviewer, to approve the petition unless we can

05:37:02.140 --> 05:37:06.860
prove that there are these various elements that was described by Stephanie.

05:37:07.420 --> 05:37:12.220
And so what I have found that when we have looked at these,

05:37:12.940 --> 05:37:22.380
you know, on face, it looks like it could be very technical, right? Whether the program is unsound,

05:37:22.380 --> 05:37:30.460
whether the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely or likely to be able to be successful with the

05:37:30.460 --> 05:37:36.940
program, whether the elements are reasonably comprehensive, you would think you could

05:37:36.940 --> 05:37:42.780
checklist this, but in actuality, it's really fairly subjective in how we look at this.

05:37:43.340 --> 05:37:50.940
And so what I do and when I'm looking at these situations is a lot of times it is about context,

05:37:50.940 --> 05:38:01.340
and I look at time and place in which these petitions were here. I look at innovation,

05:38:01.340 --> 05:38:06.460
is this offering an option or choice that doesn't currently exist within the system,

05:38:06.460 --> 05:38:12.620
which is part of what chartering is about, and then I mostly look at benefit for kids.

05:38:13.260 --> 05:38:19.660
And so, you know, you have to take all of these things in mind, and this is not necessarily to

05:38:19.660 --> 05:38:24.620
this particular petition right now, but I'm just making some general comments about the context

05:38:24.620 --> 05:38:36.220
from which to look at these petitions. So with that now, specific to PEA, I'm quite inspired by

05:38:36.220 --> 05:38:42.460
the concept by the petitioners have brought forth. It kind of reminds me of this kind of one room

05:38:42.460 --> 05:38:52.620
schoolhouse concept, and I am empathetic to the distance that the school is from the school sites

05:38:52.620 --> 05:38:59.580
that the students would otherwise be attending. And so I understand, and I really laud the

05:38:59.580 --> 05:39:05.740
petitioners for their efforts in bringing forth a program that they feel best meets the needs of

05:39:05.740 --> 05:39:15.580
their students in their community. At the same time, I am concerned with also the other side

05:39:15.580 --> 05:39:21.420
of this, which is looking at operationally and physically whether this school can stand alone,

05:39:21.420 --> 05:39:28.700
and it is particularly related to the size of the program and the size of the district in which this

05:39:28.780 --> 05:39:37.740
this program would be opening. And from my understanding is that there used to be a pinecrest

05:39:37.740 --> 05:39:44.780
district, I think, right in the area or something to that effect, which ended up having to close

05:39:44.780 --> 05:39:52.060
or something like that. So I am very, very concerned about the size and the ability of

05:39:52.060 --> 05:39:59.660
just within the size of being able to provide the scope of services for to meet the needs of

05:39:59.660 --> 05:40:08.620
all students. Because while it does harken on the full idyllic one room schoolhouse concept,

05:40:08.620 --> 05:40:15.740
we're not in the 19th century US, we are in 21st century. And so there are lots of requirements

05:40:15.740 --> 05:40:24.300
and to be operational as a LEA for special education, for a myriad of other things,

05:40:24.300 --> 05:40:27.740
accountability. I do have a lot of concerns.

05:40:30.140 --> 05:40:37.100
Right. Is there further discussion from the board? Let's see if I see any hands up.

05:40:37.100 --> 05:40:47.100
I see a member Navo and then member Strauss.

05:40:49.340 --> 05:40:55.100
Yeah, thank you, board president. And Stephanie, I have a question. I'm trying to wrap my head

05:40:55.100 --> 05:41:05.420
around the financials, because it's clear that pinecrest has a different view of what their

05:41:05.420 --> 05:41:12.700
ending balances are compared to ours. And I'm trying to grasp how we're so far apart

05:41:12.700 --> 05:41:20.460
from one another in terms of where they are financially if they included the $250,000 revolving

05:41:20.460 --> 05:41:25.500
fund in their funding calculator and that created the discrepancy. Can you shed some light on that

05:41:25.500 --> 05:41:34.300
from your perspective? Sure. So I'm on, right? So yeah, so we based our analysis on the budget

05:41:34.300 --> 05:41:40.220
that they submitted with their petition. The numbers that they are showing today during their

05:41:40.220 --> 05:41:45.100
presentation, those were not submitted to us. They did not submit a new budget to us.

05:41:46.460 --> 05:41:53.660
So we've not been able to analyze that or provide any analysis. We're seeing it on the screen with

05:41:53.660 --> 05:41:59.020
you. Okay. Does that, doesn't that constitute a material revision?

05:42:01.580 --> 05:42:07.020
Or no? I'm gonna, I'm gonna let Judy answer that.

05:42:09.580 --> 05:42:17.660
Hi, this is Judy Sias with the Chief Counsel for the State Board. What defines a material

05:42:17.660 --> 05:42:24.860
revision under the old law is certainly complicated. I think in the past, the board has

05:42:24.860 --> 05:42:30.940
acknowledged that budgets change. And certainly in this instance, when petitioners do their

05:42:30.940 --> 05:42:34.700
budget in the fall and what shows up this spring given the pandemic is different.

05:42:36.540 --> 05:42:43.820
I do think, you know, when they put stuff out for us at the beginning where we haven't had a chance

05:42:43.820 --> 05:42:50.780
to review it, that certainly adds a layer of complexity to the analysis. But whether or not

05:42:50.780 --> 05:42:56.860
it's a material revision is a complicated question that we've struggled with at the board. But the

05:42:56.860 --> 05:43:01.980
budget is certainly one of the things that we have, petitioners have submitted updated figures

05:43:02.540 --> 05:43:06.860
given the changes in the budget circumstances that are often beyond the control of the school.

05:43:07.260 --> 05:43:13.260
Okay, thank you. I have other questions, but I can come back and let others weigh in.

05:43:13.260 --> 05:43:18.060
Why don't you go ahead, Matt, and ask your questions and then I'll move to member Strauss.

05:43:18.060 --> 05:43:25.500
This is for the petitioner. I do agree with the county regarding your special education funding.

05:43:25.500 --> 05:43:31.260
I'm trying to understand how you, how you came up with your special education funding plan. What

05:43:31.260 --> 05:43:39.100
did you base that on? The original budget did not include funds from AB 602 as we assumed that a

05:43:39.100 --> 05:43:45.660
SELPA would intercept those funds. So the original budget submitted to the county included the 44,000

05:43:45.660 --> 05:43:52.300
in special education. If we were to become a member of say the El Dorado SELPA and retain those funds

05:43:52.300 --> 05:44:01.100
from AB 602, that would raise our special education budget to $12.3 million. So that's

05:44:01.180 --> 05:44:12.540
3.7% and it's $74,000. Okay, so if I understand correctly, it goes back to the original question

05:44:12.540 --> 05:44:19.260
about the budget. You included that as a new, as a new item in this budget. CDE hasn't,

05:44:19.260 --> 05:44:25.820
didn't see that. County didn't see that. We included that as a rebuttal to our county findings

05:44:25.900 --> 05:44:33.180
and we did submit a revised version of the LCFF calculator and I did present this same slide

05:44:33.180 --> 05:44:43.900
to the advisory committee in June. For the county office, you had mentioned you have

05:44:43.900 --> 05:44:47.500
charters that you've approved, Golden Lakes and Foothill. Can you tell me a little bit more about

05:44:47.500 --> 05:44:53.660
what the difference is between those two in this, in this request? At the time that those petitions

05:44:53.660 --> 05:45:00.780
were submitted, they had a budget that was sustainable, at least in their charter petition

05:45:00.780 --> 05:45:07.340
at the time. That was one of the largest, so the likelihood of a program being successful

05:45:07.340 --> 05:45:14.380
and the soundness of the educational program as well played, that was the deciding factor for the

05:45:14.380 --> 05:45:21.100
county board. I will be frank that on both of those, I was not the county superintendent on either

05:45:21.100 --> 05:45:26.620
of them. Both of them were two different county superintendents. The county superintendents and

05:45:26.620 --> 05:45:33.580
staff recommended not approving those charters and the county board did decide to approve those

05:45:34.540 --> 05:45:41.340
charters despite the recommendation. So I just want to make sure that that's understood about

05:45:41.340 --> 05:45:49.580
how the county board operates. They are very independent in that they will very much give

05:45:50.540 --> 05:45:59.580
a lot of latitude in their approval process, trying to again encourage innovation, trying to

05:45:59.580 --> 05:46:05.740
encourage different ways of addressing some of the challenges we have in small rural

05:46:06.700 --> 05:46:14.300
counties, meaning small districts, not small geographically, geographic areas. And so that's

05:46:14.300 --> 05:46:20.300
the history behind Golden Lakes. Unfortunately, Golden Lakes, within two years of operating and

05:46:20.300 --> 05:46:28.060
opening, there were some issues and they changed their charter approver to a school district in

05:46:28.060 --> 05:46:35.740
Stanislaus County and then shortly after decided not to seek approval for a renewal and close.

05:46:36.540 --> 05:46:43.500
Foothill leadership, which was the most recent one that was approved, did not receive a renewal

05:46:44.060 --> 05:46:53.180
again under very sad circumstances, a lot of inexperience on the fiscal management side of

05:46:53.180 --> 05:47:01.420
the house. And we've actually, it's taken a year for us to finally close out that school. And so

05:47:01.420 --> 05:47:06.460
that's the history with our charter schools in Tuolumne County. And then there's only one other

05:47:06.460 --> 05:47:13.340
charter school in Tuolumne County, but it is about the third largest school of the district

05:47:14.220 --> 05:47:21.980
in Tuolumne County. So it attracts quite a few students. Thank you. Anything else, Matt?

05:47:23.820 --> 05:47:28.220
No, that'll do it for now. Thank you. Okay. We're going to go to member Strauss and then

05:47:28.220 --> 05:47:35.740
member Glover Woods. Yeah. So my understanding is this is a rural setting and there's a small

05:47:35.740 --> 05:47:43.180
number of students that the local Twainheart district serves and then also the petitioner

05:47:43.180 --> 05:47:49.900
is proposing to serve. I do have some particular, I think there's some strengths that the

05:47:49.900 --> 05:47:57.180
petitioner presented today. Certainly they personalized knowing the kids well, the experience,

05:47:57.180 --> 05:48:04.060
the outdoor in that area sounds really exciting for parents, particularly how hard things have

05:48:04.060 --> 05:48:11.580
been lately and knowing in a small personalized setting. However, I do share the concerns of the

05:48:11.580 --> 05:48:17.580
educational program that member Sung reminded that we are responsible to make sure that English

05:48:17.580 --> 05:48:22.380
learners have the right support, that special ed has the right support. And there's a lot of

05:48:22.380 --> 05:48:27.660
requirements. Those of us who've led schools and districts know, even though you have good intent,

05:48:27.660 --> 05:48:33.420
there's some legal guidelines. I do think the SOFA would provide support, but I think it's a broad

05:48:34.620 --> 05:48:43.900
proposal with 60 some odd students in two classrooms with home independent school as well.

05:48:46.700 --> 05:48:53.020
And I guess I have another concern that having originally submitted the petition in 2018,

05:48:53.020 --> 05:48:57.100
that there's been very little change and modification to the petition over time.

05:48:57.740 --> 05:49:03.660
And yet the findings have really said you need to address the changes. So I just,

05:49:05.260 --> 05:49:10.540
again, I have mixed feelings in that I think there's a wonderful belief in opportunity to

05:49:10.540 --> 05:49:15.900
create a nice setting and learning opportunity for a small number of students. But I still

05:49:15.900 --> 05:49:22.460
believe that we have requirements in the educational program that we must ensure are there for those

05:49:22.460 --> 05:49:33.020
students. Okay. Member Glover Woods. Thank you. And my question is to the petitioners,

05:49:33.020 --> 05:49:39.340
it can also be to Stephanie as well. And it really builds off of board member Strauss' comment.

05:49:40.060 --> 05:49:45.500
As it relates to the review that was done, there was a concern about the descriptiveness

05:49:46.060 --> 05:49:50.700
of the English learner program and the support that English learners would receive.

05:49:51.260 --> 05:49:59.340
I wanted to hear a bit more from the petitioners on the specifics on how you would ensure that

05:50:00.140 --> 05:50:07.820
our designated as English learners receive the proper program. I would like to have our board

05:50:07.820 --> 05:50:15.180
member Chris and Peggy answer that question if it pleases the board. Okay. Are they there?

05:50:15.180 --> 05:50:33.100
That's fine. Okay. Chris? Did we lose Chris? Oh, no. Here I am. Well, they,

05:50:34.780 --> 05:50:42.700
as I can appreciate that a small school has challenges when you have only two classrooms

05:50:42.700 --> 05:50:51.820
and, you know, eight grade levels. The idea would be that you would have a block of whole

05:50:51.820 --> 05:51:04.140
group instruction for students in K, for language arts anyway, in TK or K3. And you would deliver

05:51:04.140 --> 05:51:11.740
on rotating days the core standards. Embedded in the, not embedded, but along the ELD standards

05:51:11.740 --> 05:51:21.100
are part of the ELA standards. So there would be an alignment to the integrated parts of ELA,

05:51:21.660 --> 05:51:27.340
I mean, of ELD in the ELA time, as well as in science and social studies times.

05:51:28.060 --> 05:51:35.420
And the idea is to give differentiated instruction for ELA, ELD, and ingrain

05:51:35.660 --> 05:51:41.660
the designated parts with small group instruction with rotating centers. So it would be,

05:51:42.780 --> 05:51:47.260
you're talking about, you know, when you're thinking about the number of students here

05:51:47.260 --> 05:51:54.060
and you're saying roughly 54 students, you're talking, it sounds like you have this amazing

05:51:54.060 --> 05:52:00.300
challenge, but you need to picture that, say, roughly, you can't control exactly how the

05:52:01.260 --> 05:52:09.260
distribution by grade level is, but let's just say there were 25 students in K3, and they're not

05:52:09.260 --> 05:52:16.780
going to fall neatly into grade level, but if you begin to think about the size of the classroom in

05:52:16.780 --> 05:52:22.140
and of itself, it's a lot easier to differentiate instruction. We're not talking about trying to

05:52:22.140 --> 05:52:29.420
provide ELD designated and integrated to hundreds of children. There's 25 students, and so you're

05:52:29.500 --> 05:52:38.060
able to really determine through the LPAC, through ELA assessments, through the basic

05:52:39.260 --> 05:52:44.300
phonics skills test, all kinds of early reading literacy to figure out where students are,

05:52:44.300 --> 05:52:50.460
both as English learners and as English language arts learners, and differentiate a program for

05:52:50.460 --> 05:52:56.540
them by which is going to be customized and tailored almost individually to each child.

05:52:56.540 --> 05:53:01.340
The beauty of a multi-age classroom in that way is, as we all know, you can have first graders

05:53:01.340 --> 05:53:05.980
who are really performing as third graders, and you can have third graders who are performing as

05:53:05.980 --> 05:53:14.220
first graders, and that multi-age allows for that flexibility. This program would be, in a way,

05:53:14.220 --> 05:53:21.980
you're having a, like I said, an individualized plan for each student that is able to address

05:53:21.980 --> 05:53:27.260
their particular needs. The program is designed, and the school's intent is to progress monitor

05:53:27.260 --> 05:53:32.380
these students every four to six weeks with the flexibility of moving them in and out of

05:53:34.460 --> 05:53:41.420
either small group differentiated instruction in ELA or ELD as needed. Therefore, students are

05:53:41.420 --> 05:53:47.260
able to progress at their pace in a way that they're not able to do, particularly in large schools,

05:53:47.500 --> 05:53:52.380
because the system is so big and doesn't respond as quickly. Here, the response time to their

05:53:52.380 --> 05:54:01.900
progress or lack of is going to be immediate. Every credentialed teacher, the plan is to hire

05:54:01.900 --> 05:54:09.580
a credentialed teacher who has EL authorization. That teacher will be qualified into understanding

05:54:10.540 --> 05:54:18.940
the essential ELA standards, the ELD standards, and how to offer, provide designated and integrated

05:54:18.940 --> 05:54:34.540
ELD to students. The other questions, Cynthia? No. Okay. Eileen, it looks like your hand is up again.

05:54:34.620 --> 05:54:44.140
No? Okay. Taking it down? All right. So I don't see any other questions from members of the board.

05:54:45.900 --> 05:54:48.780
So the question now is, do we have a motion?

05:54:54.380 --> 05:54:59.900
If I could just clarify a little bit on the budget piece that Matt was asking about.

05:54:59.900 --> 05:55:05.580
So what the petitioner, I believe, was providing was a budget based on the May

05:55:05.580 --> 05:55:15.820
revise because during the recommendation for the ACCS, there was a review by the department

05:55:17.260 --> 05:55:22.220
of a budget using the May revise. But of course, now the May revise has changed.

05:55:22.220 --> 05:55:28.380
And I'm wondering for the petitioners, did you have an updated budget based on the budget that

05:55:28.380 --> 05:55:35.260
was passed? We have not updated the budget since the budget has passed due to the time constraints.

05:55:35.260 --> 05:55:43.020
The original budget we submitted did include the $250,000 charter school revolving loan as other

05:55:43.020 --> 05:55:50.220
income. When CDE did their review, they removed that, which generated the negative fund balances.

05:55:51.180 --> 05:55:57.740
The revision we provided was based on the May revise, assuming a worst case scenario in our

05:55:57.740 --> 05:56:02.540
funding. And that is as far as I have taken the budget at this point.

05:56:04.460 --> 05:56:10.460
Was there at any point, did you all the petitioners talk to the district about

05:56:10.460 --> 05:56:16.300
a district program that would meet your needs? I have asked the Twainheart School District

05:56:16.860 --> 05:56:24.380
more than once. I asked prior to Rick Hennis being the superintendent. I asked this year after I

05:56:24.380 --> 05:56:31.100
submitted this petition, if we could work together, even establishing trying to pass a tax measure,

05:56:31.100 --> 05:56:38.460
if they were worried about the fiscal impacts to the district. I have a lot of respect for

05:56:38.460 --> 05:56:44.700
Kathy Parker as the county superintendent and have also spoken to her on multiple occasions.

05:56:44.700 --> 05:56:50.380
The Twainheart School District is a basic aid district. And I know you mentioned it early on

05:56:50.380 --> 05:56:57.500
about the closure of the Pinecrest School. The Pinecrest School did operate until 2012,

05:56:57.500 --> 05:57:04.140
was originally under the Columbia School District. It was given to the Twainheart School District

05:57:04.140 --> 05:57:14.220
in the summer of 1995. And Twainheart ran it until they were changed to the basic aid funding

05:57:14.220 --> 05:57:19.740
schedule. So they lost their necessary small school funds and the incentive to run a school

05:57:19.740 --> 05:57:27.420
in the Pinecrest area. The Pinecrest School did operate for nearly a century in this community

05:57:28.060 --> 05:57:33.980
with a small student enrollment. Peggy is an alumni of the Pinecrest School, as am I.

05:57:34.780 --> 05:57:41.100
And those multi-grade classrooms did function. And I do understand that we're not little house

05:57:41.100 --> 05:57:46.300
on the prairie and I'm not trying to make it seem like that. But I also understand that in the 21st

05:57:46.300 --> 05:57:51.500
century that the community does still have substantial educational needs that are not

05:57:51.500 --> 05:57:57.660
currently being met. And although the district does a fine job at their sole location, it does

05:57:57.660 --> 05:58:04.300
not extend to this area of the community, which does provide them substantial support in their

05:58:04.300 --> 05:58:10.940
basic aid funding statute with their excess tax. This is the high property value of that district

05:58:10.940 --> 05:58:17.340
and we need to continue to support that so all parties involved can continue to survive and thrive.

05:58:19.980 --> 05:58:26.700
Thank you. Are there any other questions from board members? Seeing none, is there a motion?

05:58:26.700 --> 05:58:44.860
No, go ahead. Well, was that Matt who I heard? Yeah, go ahead, Ting. I'll go after you.

05:58:47.020 --> 05:58:56.540
Yeah, so this has been a difficult one. I, again, do admire what the petitioners are trying to do

05:58:56.780 --> 05:59:04.060
in serving the needs of their students and their specific community. I, it is very difficult to get

05:59:04.060 --> 05:59:17.660
over the small numbers and to be able to provide the expanse of services. I do hope that the

05:59:17.740 --> 05:59:26.940
district, the county, will try to work with the petitioners in helping them provide some choice

05:59:26.940 --> 05:59:36.700
for this, but I will be, I'm going to go with the CDE recommendation to deny the charter.

05:59:38.140 --> 05:59:44.780
Is there a second? I'll second. All right, is there any further discussion?

05:59:47.820 --> 05:59:55.580
Seeing none, we'll now hold a roll call vote. Karen, please call the roll. Okay. Patricia?

05:59:57.100 --> 06:00:16.780
Yes. Brennan? Yes. Jim? Yes. Ting? Yes. Eileen? Yes. Linda? Yes. Cynthia? Yes.

06:00:18.380 --> 06:00:33.100
Matt? Yes. Hay Day? Yes. Kim? Yes. The vote's unanimous. All right, well, thank you very much,

06:00:33.100 --> 06:00:42.460
Stephanie. I want to reinforce members' sons' plea that the district think about the choices for these

06:00:43.100 --> 06:00:46.860
parents and community members, and we're now going to take a 10-minute break

06:00:47.740 --> 06:00:54.060
before the next public hearing. So I want to ask you to please turn off your microphones and cameras,

06:00:54.060 --> 06:01:02.300
board members, and be back here at about 3.52. Thank you. Thank you.

06:01:02.300 --> 06:01:14.540
I know Member Rucker had to step away for a moment, but it looks like we have everyone else.

06:01:15.340 --> 06:01:24.060
So Karen, would you like to reestablish a quorum by calling the roll? Yes. Okay,

06:01:24.060 --> 06:01:28.060
Patricia stepped away for a moment, but she'll be right back. Brenna?

06:01:28.700 --> 06:01:33.980
Here. Jim? Here. Ting?

06:01:38.300 --> 06:01:45.740
Ting, are you there? Okay, we'll go there. Ting's there. Okay, good. Eileen? Yes. Linda?

06:01:46.700 --> 06:01:56.300
Here. Cynthia? Yes. Matt? Here. Hay Day? Here. Kim?

06:01:56.860 --> 06:02:03.660
Karen, would you like to? Here. Okay, everyone's here except for Patricia.

06:02:03.660 --> 06:02:12.780
We know she'll be right back. Okay, so agenda item 17 is a public hearing regarding petition

06:02:12.780 --> 06:02:17.260
for the establishment of a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education,

06:02:17.260 --> 06:02:23.340
consideration of EGLE Collegiate Academy, which was denied by the Act in Agua Dolce Unified School

06:02:23.340 --> 06:02:28.380
District on Los Angeles County Board of Education. The CDE recommends that the State

06:02:28.380 --> 06:02:33.340
Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish EGLE Collegiate Academy,

06:02:34.220 --> 06:02:41.420
TKK through grade three charter school. This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of CDE.

06:02:41.420 --> 06:02:49.660
Stephanie, please begin. Thank you. Before I start, I just want to clarify one thing based on the

06:02:49.660 --> 06:02:55.660
overview I gave before the last item in terms of the SBE role. I just want to clarify that the law

06:02:55.660 --> 06:03:02.300
does say that petitions shall be approved unless one of the findings that I had listed in that

06:03:02.300 --> 06:03:11.340
slide are made. And so I want to be clear about that piece of ed code. So today we're going to

06:03:11.340 --> 06:03:16.140
talk about EGLE Collegiate Academy. They are seeking authorization from the State Board of

06:03:16.140 --> 06:03:20.620
Ed to establish a TK through grade eight charter school within the boundaries of the Act in Agua

06:03:20.620 --> 06:03:28.220
Dulce Unified School District. The petitioners previously saw authorization. Oh, got to remember

06:03:28.220 --> 06:03:35.660
to move this forward. Previously saw authorization through Act in Agua Dulce and the LA County Board

06:03:35.660 --> 06:03:42.300
of Education. They were denied by the district on November 14th, 2019 and denied by the LA County

06:03:42.300 --> 06:03:49.020
Board of Education on January 21st, 2020. They appealed to the State Board on January 27th,

06:03:49.020 --> 06:03:54.780
2020. There may be some board members who see that this sounds familiar to them. They were,

06:03:54.780 --> 06:04:01.900
EGLE Collegiate was in front of this board last year in May 2019 and obviously they were denied.

06:04:01.900 --> 06:04:08.780
So they're back now. The California Department of Education recommends that the State Board hold a

06:04:08.780 --> 06:04:14.380
public hearing to deny the request to establish EGLE Collegiate a TK through grade eight charter

06:04:14.380 --> 06:04:21.980
school under the oversight of the SBE. The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools on June 9th

06:04:21.980 --> 06:04:29.020
considered the EGLE Collegiate Academy petition and they moved the CDE recommendation to deny

06:04:29.020 --> 06:04:35.100
the request to establish EGLE Collegiate petition by a vote of seven to one with one abstention.

06:04:39.500 --> 06:04:44.460
The basis for recommendation for denial, the petition is not consistent with sound education

06:04:44.460 --> 06:04:50.060
practice. The petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program

06:04:50.060 --> 06:04:55.340
and the petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required 15

06:04:55.340 --> 06:05:01.340
charter elements. A little background on the school, their mission statement is to empower

06:05:01.340 --> 06:05:05.900
pupils to become self-confident and authentic global citizens prepared for 21st century careers

06:05:05.900 --> 06:05:12.620
and responsibilities. The enrollment projections are they intend to open, their intention was to

06:05:12.620 --> 06:05:21.340
open in 2021 with 168 pupils in TK through grade three and grow to serve 438 pupils by 24-25.

06:05:23.580 --> 06:05:29.100
And the program intends to adopt an international baccalaureate IB model.

06:05:29.100 --> 06:05:37.340
On to our findings, unsound educational program, the petition provides an insufficient description

06:05:37.340 --> 06:05:41.820
of the educational program, it does not reasonably comprehensive or does not, sorry, does not include

06:05:41.820 --> 06:05:46.620
a reasonably descriptive plan for the implementation of the IB program or the professional development

06:05:46.620 --> 06:05:50.860
plan for IB teacher training, does not sufficiently describe how English learners will receive

06:05:50.860 --> 06:05:57.660
targeted English language development instruction, very little detail about the scope of the

06:05:58.460 --> 06:06:04.380
program, very insufficient description of teaching methodologies and IB pedagogy

06:06:04.380 --> 06:06:07.420
and scope and a lack of scope and sequence in each subject.

06:06:10.860 --> 06:06:16.940
Inability to implement, this is, you'll see this slide in all of our charter appeals just to

06:06:17.500 --> 06:06:22.380
remind everyone that, like you need reminding, that we're in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic

06:06:22.460 --> 06:06:29.660
and the budget is, the proposed June agreement includes 11 billion dollars of apportionment

06:06:29.660 --> 06:06:35.740
deferrals for 2021. It's something that charters and especially charters that are looking to

06:06:35.740 --> 06:06:41.900
establish will probably be a burden and problematic for them.

06:06:44.940 --> 06:06:51.500
The inability to implement fiscal analysis, this is a fiscal analysis of the budget plan

06:06:51.500 --> 06:06:59.420
that was submitted with their petition. If you can see here the first year, they are in the red

06:06:59.420 --> 06:07:05.660
with no reserves and then they move up the second two years. I think it's important to note that

06:07:06.460 --> 06:07:13.740
part of their budget is to borrow receivables. They'll be borrowing receivables, 515,000 on

06:07:13.740 --> 06:07:23.100
startup year, 893,000 for the following year and 1,600,000, I'm horrible with these numbers,

06:07:23.100 --> 06:07:31.820
1,636,000 for the following year. So that's a lot of borrowing and borrowing receivables for a

06:07:31.820 --> 06:07:38.620
startup school who will also may have to deal with deferrals as well. It also is important to note

06:07:38.620 --> 06:07:42.940
that the school must meet its enrollment ADA projections in order to be fiscally solvent.

06:07:43.500 --> 06:07:44.620
There's no wiggle room there.

06:07:49.420 --> 06:07:55.100
We do believe that they have aggressive enrollment assumptions and as I just mentioned,

06:07:56.140 --> 06:08:00.380
their budget plan is completely reliant on their enrollment projections and growth to cover

06:08:00.380 --> 06:08:11.020
expenditures. Their enrollment growth in the first five years, 168 in 2021 and 438 in 2425.

06:08:11.820 --> 06:08:15.900
The district that they're located in, the Acton-Aguaduce district serves approximately

06:08:15.900 --> 06:08:20.860
a thousand pupils. The district has one elementary school, one junior high and one high school.

06:08:24.300 --> 06:08:28.220
The petition states that ECA will be an IB candidate school by its opening.

06:08:29.340 --> 06:08:37.820
Again, opening times have been affected by COVID-19. So

06:08:38.620 --> 06:08:43.260
that's something that the board can discuss. We have concerns regarding the ability of the

06:08:43.260 --> 06:08:47.980
school to recruit staff, create a high quality instructional program, initiate the administrative

06:08:47.980 --> 06:08:52.460
processes and facilities needed for all grade levels and meet the requirements for the IB

06:08:52.460 --> 06:08:57.260
program. Additional concerns surrounding the level of professional development for IB teachers

06:08:57.260 --> 06:09:01.580
is also one that CDE staff has found troubling.

06:09:02.140 --> 06:09:08.540
In terms of their facility plan,

06:09:11.660 --> 06:09:16.220
we do have concerns about the facility that they plan to lease within the boundaries of the

06:09:16.220 --> 06:09:27.980
Acton-Aguaduce district and also the modular buildings that they are proposing to acquire

06:09:27.980 --> 06:09:33.820
and put on the land. We felt in the original budget, we saw that they did not have the

06:09:33.820 --> 06:09:42.300
budgeted amount for the proper budgeted amount for the types of modulars that they would be using

06:09:43.180 --> 06:09:50.540
and they also, we felt that they were not, had not budgeted for the amount of work the facility

06:09:50.540 --> 06:09:59.820
actually needs. The petition also has insufficient descriptions of the charter elements,

06:10:00.620 --> 06:10:08.460
charter elements one, two, four and five. Educational program, I had spoken about that

06:10:08.460 --> 06:10:14.380
a little bit ago, but also in addition to that, the petition does not include a comprehensive

06:10:14.380 --> 06:10:19.500
description of the IB primary years program and middle years program, which is primarily

06:10:19.500 --> 06:10:24.620
what they would be implementing. As you know, the full IB program is a high school, so they would be

06:10:24.620 --> 06:10:31.020
implementing these two earlier programs. It does not conclude a comprehensive description of the

06:10:31.020 --> 06:10:36.940
professional development needed for IB teachers and it does not sufficiently describe how ELs

06:10:36.940 --> 06:10:43.020
will receive their instruction. The petition does not outline measurable pupil outcomes

06:10:43.020 --> 06:10:46.780
that address increases in pupil academic achievement, both school-wide and for all

06:10:46.780 --> 06:10:54.060
groups of pupils. We find this is common and really, in my estimation, a big gap in knowledge

06:10:54.060 --> 06:10:57.980
when it comes to measurable pupil outcomes because this is how authorizers

06:11:01.180 --> 06:11:07.500
oversee and measure growth in schools. The governance structure, the petition states

06:11:08.380 --> 06:11:12.940
that ECA board members cannot simultaneously be members of the compensation committee and employees

06:11:12.940 --> 06:11:17.100
of the school, but of course, this conflicts with their bylaws, which states that no director

06:11:17.100 --> 06:11:21.740
serving at any time may be current employees of the corporation. So there's some language

06:11:21.740 --> 06:11:25.660
in their bylaws and in their petition that conflict, which we had concerns with.

06:11:27.740 --> 06:11:35.260
ECA school site council is in violation of Ed Code section 65000. The number of parents,

06:11:35.260 --> 06:11:38.700
pupils and community members does not equal the number of school members selected.

06:11:39.660 --> 06:11:44.620
Employee qualifications, the petition does not identify key positions nor does it specify

06:11:44.620 --> 06:11:49.580
the additional qualifications of individuals in those positions. Given the IB program described

06:11:49.580 --> 06:11:54.540
in the petition, if teachers teach only one discipline, ECA would possibly need 32 single

06:11:54.540 --> 06:11:59.420
subject credential teachers. This is just some of the issues that we had in terms of confusing

06:11:59.420 --> 06:12:07.100
language and not quite sure whether they understood how the credentialing works for schools and what

06:12:07.100 --> 06:12:11.900
they would actually need to implement the very aggressive academic program that they outlined.

06:12:13.660 --> 06:12:20.620
The petition does not outline measurable pupil outcomes that increases in pupil academic

06:12:20.620 --> 06:12:27.100
achievement, both school-wide and for all groups of pupils, and that is pertaining to the eight

06:12:27.100 --> 06:12:33.980
state priorities. So in conclusion, the CDE recommends that the state board deny the petition

06:12:33.980 --> 06:12:38.620
to establish EGLE collegiate. The petition does not provide a sound educational program.

06:12:38.620 --> 06:12:43.100
The petitioner is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the intended program,

06:12:43.100 --> 06:12:47.500
and the petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all required elements.

06:12:49.020 --> 06:12:51.020
And there is the public comment page.

06:12:51.020 --> 06:13:04.860
Okay. At this point, we will hear from the petitioner. Petitioners will have 12 minutes.

06:13:04.860 --> 06:13:09.020
Then we'll hear from the district and county that are opposing the petition,

06:13:09.020 --> 06:13:14.300
who will also have a total of 12 minutes. And after there are presentations from both sides,

06:13:14.860 --> 06:13:19.420
we will have an opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented

06:13:19.420 --> 06:13:28.380
for one minute each. Linda, you need to officially open the public hearing.

06:13:28.380 --> 06:13:33.340
I'm sorry, yes. I officially open the public hearing at 4.05 p.m.

06:13:36.380 --> 06:13:39.740
and we'll open the phone line for public comment queue.

06:13:43.740 --> 06:13:45.420
Can we hear from the petitioner?

06:13:49.420 --> 06:14:01.420
Is the petitioner? Yes. Ready. Okay. Please begin.

06:14:01.980 --> 06:14:04.700
Linda, you need to officially open the public hearing.

06:14:04.700 --> 06:14:08.860
I'm sorry, yes. I officially open the public hearing at 4.05 p.m.

06:14:08.860 --> 06:14:10.140
She did. She's opened it.

06:14:11.340 --> 06:14:16.060
I did do that. And we'll open the phone line for public comment queue.

06:14:16.940 --> 06:14:25.420
Good afternoon, honorable president. I'm sorry, somebody probably has their

06:14:25.420 --> 06:14:28.540
live feed on, which means we're hearing what I said a minute ago now.

06:14:29.500 --> 06:14:33.580
So if you have the live feed on, please turn your computer volume down.

06:14:33.580 --> 06:14:35.740
Yes. Ready. Okay.

06:14:36.620 --> 06:14:41.180
Linda, you need to officially open the public hearing.

06:14:41.180 --> 06:14:43.420
Can you see this? Can you guys see the screen?

06:14:45.420 --> 06:14:46.700
She did. She's opened it.

06:14:49.980 --> 06:14:52.620
We're in some kind of a strange Groundhog Day loop.

06:14:57.660 --> 06:15:01.820
Okay. I think the petitioner, you should be prepared to begin. Go ahead.

06:15:01.820 --> 06:15:08.780
Okay. Good afternoon, honorable board president, Dr. Darlene Hammond,

06:15:08.780 --> 06:15:13.820
and honorable state board members. I am happy to see that all of you are safe,

06:15:13.820 --> 06:15:16.380
healthy, and still smiling after a long day.

06:15:18.060 --> 06:15:23.660
My name is Ogokoye Johnson, founder and lead petitioner of Eagle Collegiate Academy.

06:15:24.220 --> 06:15:27.900
On behalf of all our families anxiously waiting for our decision,

06:15:28.380 --> 06:15:34.220
your decision this afternoon, thank you and the CDE staff for taking the time to review

06:15:34.220 --> 06:15:38.460
our petition. Our board president, advocate, architect, fiscal consultant,

06:15:38.460 --> 06:15:42.140
and charter school law consultants are here with me to answer your questions.

06:15:42.860 --> 06:15:48.620
I would like to emphatically state that our families and team will be happy to accept

06:15:48.620 --> 06:15:55.260
a fall 2021 charter term start as a condition for approval, recognizing the unknown impact

06:15:55.260 --> 06:16:04.140
of COVID-19 as early as in March 2020. We sent a letter to CDE and SBE staff affirming

06:16:04.140 --> 06:16:09.020
that we would agree to a delayed start to give you as much comfort as possible

06:16:09.020 --> 06:16:14.620
about our readiness for a successful launch. It will also make up for the four months of delay

06:16:14.620 --> 06:16:22.300
caused by the district and by CDE's removal of ECA from ACCS April agenda and refusal

06:16:22.940 --> 06:16:26.300
of our request to be placed on SBE's May agenda.

06:16:27.820 --> 06:16:33.020
Throughout the four years since a group of local parents, educators, and professionals embarked

06:16:33.020 --> 06:16:39.020
on this journey to provide access to quality education for our children and our community,

06:16:39.020 --> 06:16:45.740
ECA team has listened, compromised, sacrificed, persevered, and addressed the concerns from

06:16:45.740 --> 06:16:51.900
potential authorizers even when upon resubmission new concerns are raised and areas that were

06:16:51.900 --> 06:16:57.820
previously found comprehensive are reversed. You recommended in May 2019 that we open with

06:16:57.820 --> 06:17:03.260
less number of grade levels and students that will fit within the build in the first year.

06:17:03.260 --> 06:17:09.180
We listened intently to your remarks. Board member Ms. Rocker, you stated that our program

06:17:09.180 --> 06:17:13.740
is innovative and that you would have liked to have been able to attend such a school.

06:17:13.740 --> 06:17:19.340
Board members Dr. Son and Mr. Navo said that there is an apparent need and a demand for ECA

06:17:19.340 --> 06:17:25.980
based on our parent interest which board vice president Dr. Strauss saw when she visited our

06:17:25.980 --> 06:17:32.380
community but president Dr. Darlene Hammond you affirmed that I be the solid educational program.

06:17:32.380 --> 06:17:37.500
Board member Ms. Patel Brownstein was pleased to see that we included pre-k students in our program.

06:17:37.500 --> 06:17:41.500
There was no question that ECA program is consistent with sound practice.

06:17:42.140 --> 06:17:48.220
Your words gave us hope and energized us to start over again so we met with the district,

06:17:48.220 --> 06:17:54.380
county and CDE charter school staff. County staff recommended having an IB trained leader

06:17:54.380 --> 06:18:00.460
although not required by IB. I paid for and completed the IB school leader training. To

06:18:00.460 --> 06:18:06.540
give you comfort about our seriousness and readiness to open we started the site plan

06:18:06.540 --> 06:18:14.300
ministerial review process by hiring architects, engineers and arborists who spent extensive hours

06:18:14.300 --> 06:18:19.900
over several days conversing the interior and exterior of the property to develop the site plan

06:18:19.900 --> 06:18:25.660
which Los Angeles county department of regional planning used to deem the site feasible having

06:18:25.660 --> 06:18:30.780
met all zoning requirements. The county staff engineers said that they visited the site in

06:18:30.780 --> 06:18:36.220
January on the morning of our scheduled board vote. The district staff stated during the ACCS

06:18:36.220 --> 06:18:42.620
meeting that staff called public works seeking current permits for the site however you would

06:18:42.620 --> 06:18:47.500
not be fiscally prudent for us to request permits to make changes to the property

06:18:47.500 --> 06:18:54.140
without an approval of our petition. These tables show numerous inconsistencies in CDE

06:18:54.140 --> 06:19:01.580
reports. The most recent is from June to July. CDE has had ECA petition since January 2020

06:19:01.580 --> 06:19:07.500
and found ECA's petition to be consistent with sound educational practice in its April and

06:19:07.500 --> 06:19:15.180
June reports. It is unclear what changed in the two weeks after the ACCS meeting because CDE did

06:19:15.180 --> 06:19:22.540
not cite new reasons to reverse this finding in this July report. We have documented evidence

06:19:22.540 --> 06:19:28.700
found throughout the petition that ECA is a sound education program that meets the needs of all our

06:19:28.700 --> 06:19:34.380
student groups specifically on this petition pages. We have a letter of support from charter

06:19:34.380 --> 06:19:39.020
schools development center who works with charter schools to make sure that they are on board with

06:19:39.020 --> 06:19:45.260
what they are doing. ECA has also been accepted into the Eldorado Charter Selper after a very

06:19:45.260 --> 06:19:52.140
rigorous application process. CDE found that ECA has aggressive enrollment but that's not the case.

06:19:52.140 --> 06:20:02.780
The chart on the left shows that in 2019 we had 355 versus 168 students in 2020, a 53% reduction

06:20:02.780 --> 06:20:09.100
which is pretty much doing what you asked us to do in May 2019. The chart on the left show that

06:20:10.540 --> 06:20:16.380
and we had pre-k through eight and not pre-k through three which is what we have now,

06:20:16.380 --> 06:20:22.860
five grade levels less. The table on the right shows the population of the 11 school districts

06:20:22.860 --> 06:20:28.620
in our surrounding communities and the distance from their respective district offices to ECA's

06:20:28.620 --> 06:20:35.260
proposed site. Five are in Santa Clarita Valley and five are in Antelope Valley. One is in Castaigne,

06:20:35.260 --> 06:20:42.300
the nearest school district in Santa Clarita about eight miles and 15 minutes away to the site and

06:20:42.300 --> 06:20:47.820
the nearest school is about five miles and six minutes away in Santa Clarita. The further school

06:20:47.820 --> 06:20:53.900
district is 35 miles and 41 minutes away in Antelope Valley. These communities are within

06:20:53.900 --> 06:21:01.180
short to very reasonable driving distances from each other. There are over 114,000 seat-based

06:21:01.180 --> 06:21:08.540
students across these school districts. ECA's 168 students also include private school and

06:21:08.540 --> 06:21:14.940
home school students. San Fernando Valley schools about 14 miles away where 16% of our interested

06:21:14.940 --> 06:21:23.340
families reside are not included in this total 114,000 population. The chart on the left show

06:21:23.340 --> 06:21:29.900
the communities where ECA families reside. 56% reside in Santa Clarita Valley, 22% in Antelope

06:21:29.900 --> 06:21:39.420
Valley, 16% in San Fernando Valley, 4% in Castaigne and 1.5% in Actinago-Dolce. The chart on the right

06:21:39.420 --> 06:21:44.940
show that we have 396 students interested in ECA with a breakdown of the number of applicants

06:21:44.940 --> 06:21:50.220
per grade level. It's important to note that Aberdeen-Stein, which is a former Actinago-Dolce

06:21:50.220 --> 06:21:57.980
school district charter, opened with 650 K-6 students with over 1200 during lottery in September

06:21:57.980 --> 06:22:07.260
2013 and only 10 students were from Actinago-Dolce. CDE stated that our site is remote and not safe.

06:22:07.260 --> 06:22:12.860
However, that's not the case as well. The left top and lower quarters show that the site is within

06:22:12.860 --> 06:22:17.900
a residential neighborhood with Sierra Highway running through it. The right top quarter are

06:22:17.900 --> 06:22:23.020
close-up photos that show both right and turn views from the entry to the site.

06:22:23.020 --> 06:22:28.860
One can clearly see far ahead on the road each way. The lower right quarter is a contextual

06:22:28.860 --> 06:22:34.860
analysis of the entry plan showing the lanes to turn into the site and student drop-off.

06:22:34.860 --> 06:22:39.100
There is adequate space to accommodate the proposed modular classrooms that will be added

06:22:39.100 --> 06:22:45.420
incrementally over the years. The photo on the top left shows the exterior of the building with

06:22:45.420 --> 06:22:50.940
its beautiful bricks while the photo on the top right shows the sanctuary of the church.

06:22:50.940 --> 06:22:56.140
The two lower photos are hung directly across from the site. The property owner submitted a

06:22:56.140 --> 06:23:03.420
letter to SBE that is seen here taking responsibility for any repairs needed to ensure

06:23:03.420 --> 06:23:08.780
that the site is visible. Therefore, ECA is not going to be incurring any funds to do that.

06:23:08.780 --> 06:23:13.900
The site is central to families coming from all surrounding communities, especially those

06:23:13.900 --> 06:23:21.020
who commute to work via Sierra Highway. On June 19, 2020, at CDE's request, we submitted a balance

06:23:21.020 --> 06:23:27.260
revised budget using the May revised LCFF calculator that CDE stated it will include in

06:23:27.260 --> 06:23:33.580
its presentation to SBE. As a result, we believe that the figures presented by CDE do not accurately

06:23:33.580 --> 06:23:40.060
describe our fiscal status and is now defunct because the new state budget has changed that

06:23:40.620 --> 06:23:46.380
whole scenario. Our current budget on the right meets net asset requirements over the three years.

06:23:46.380 --> 06:23:51.260
We maintain the cuts in the reduction from the May revised in order to be ready for any

06:23:51.260 --> 06:23:58.220
unanticipated COVID-19 impact. Some of the cuts we made were the CEO salary, classified FTE,

06:23:58.220 --> 06:24:05.580
and other overhead costs, and we submitted this to the CDE. To ensure ECA has cash flow as a result

06:24:05.580 --> 06:24:12.700
of the first, we increased receivables, AR sales, and interest expense. We have applied for and made

06:24:12.700 --> 06:24:17.820
the eligibility for the public school grant several times, and we will apply again. We also

06:24:17.820 --> 06:24:22.940
have had conversations with these other foundations who provide funding to charter schools.

06:24:23.900 --> 06:24:30.380
We use CDE's COVID-19 operations written report template to plan for opening, and we will follow

06:24:30.380 --> 06:24:34.860
all the guidelines required for opening. We are considering phase opening.

06:24:35.580 --> 06:24:39.740
Why do we need ECA? Our community needs ECA because it will help to eliminate the

06:24:39.740 --> 06:24:45.020
huge gaps between educationally disadvantaged and not educationally disadvantaged students

06:24:45.020 --> 06:24:51.900
in ELA and math. 61 to 91 percent of EDS are not meeting ELA and math standards in our communities.

06:24:51.900 --> 06:24:58.220
It will lower chronic absenteeism, especially for SED students, as can be seen in these two charts,

06:24:58.220 --> 06:25:03.340
and it will be the first and only pre-K IB world school in the valley, provide rigorous access to

06:25:03.340 --> 06:25:09.820
college prep classes for underrepresented groups. Here is research supporting our model, and these

06:25:09.820 --> 06:25:16.380
are the support that we have from the city, the state, and national leaders. Honorable Congressman

06:25:16.380 --> 06:25:21.500
Mike Garcia, Honorable Senator Scott Will, Vice Chair of California Senate Education Committee,

06:25:21.500 --> 06:25:27.820
Mayor Pro Tem Bill Miranda, City of Santa Clarita, Mr. Reyes, owner of a Reyes winery

06:25:27.820 --> 06:25:33.980
that is right there in Agudose. And here are the IV support that we have and other community

06:25:33.980 --> 06:25:42.220
organizations. The most important people who are here are the people you will see in this one-minute

06:25:42.220 --> 06:25:53.260
play. Honorable commissioners and board members, I am here for the Korean families

06:25:54.220 --> 06:26:03.020
in Antelope Valley, Santa Clarita Valley, and San Fernando Valley who have been waiting for

06:26:03.020 --> 06:26:12.060
Eagle College Academy to open. It is an excellent educational program, and the location is perfect

06:26:12.620 --> 06:26:21.580
and ideal for our families. Please approve Eagle College Academy for our families. Thank you.

06:26:22.380 --> 06:26:39.180
We are the Amakos, and we support the ECA. We are the Maduski, and we support Eagle College Academy.

06:26:39.180 --> 06:26:43.180
We are the Michaels, and we support ECA.

06:26:52.300 --> 06:27:00.300
Hi, my name is Edwin Resinos. I am the pastor of City on a Hill Church. I am here with Dr. Hugo,

06:27:00.300 --> 06:27:09.180
and this is our congregation who are asking you to please approve Eagle College Academy.

06:27:22.380 --> 06:27:31.820
Although we work very hard to open by September 30, 2020, because we have students, staff,

06:27:31.820 --> 06:27:37.580
funds, families, and fathers due to the continued unknown impact of COVID-19,

06:27:37.580 --> 06:27:41.660
and to give you comfort about our successful launch, we once more

06:27:41.740 --> 06:27:48.460
employ you to approve Eagle College Academy. That's your time. Thank you. Thank you.

06:27:53.820 --> 06:27:57.180
I think we are ready to hear from the district and the county.

06:27:57.180 --> 06:28:10.220
Do we have district and county representatives here?

06:28:10.220 --> 06:28:17.020
Yes. This is Niche Patterson. I am the director of charter services for the

06:28:17.020 --> 06:28:22.940
Act in Aguadulce Unified School District. I'm here in support of the Act in Aguadulce Unified

06:28:22.940 --> 06:28:28.780
School District and LACO's staff findings to deny the petition to establish a charter

06:28:28.780 --> 06:28:34.060
by Eagle Collegian Academy within the Act in Aguadulce Unified School District boundaries.

06:28:34.060 --> 06:28:39.660
I will be presenting with Jeffrey Hartman, who is the coordinator free of the charter school's

06:28:39.660 --> 06:28:46.860
office. Our number one priority in Act in Aguadulce Unified School District is ensuring that our

06:28:46.860 --> 06:28:52.540
students are provided with a safe and quality education. We are in a rural area, and whether

06:28:52.540 --> 06:28:57.260
it be through our district services that we provide in our seat-based schools, which are

06:28:57.260 --> 06:29:03.020
a elementary, middle, and high school, or through the authorization services we provide through our

06:29:03.020 --> 06:29:09.900
charter partners, which we currently authorize 12 charter schools, all of which we work collaboratively

06:29:09.900 --> 06:29:15.500
with. We hold their operating procedures to the highest standards, and the same matrix that we

06:29:15.500 --> 06:29:21.580
use to evaluate current charters and renewals is the same matrix that we use to evaluate new

06:29:21.580 --> 06:29:27.340
charter applications. The petitioners for Eagle Collegian Academy have submitted on at least three

06:29:27.340 --> 06:29:33.740
separate occasions that, when independently reviewed by charter staff, demonstrated that

06:29:35.100 --> 06:29:40.460
they were demonstrably unlikely to be able to implement the plans that are outlined in their

06:29:41.180 --> 06:29:50.700
petition. So, essentially, the enrollment numbers that Eagle Collegiant has proposed,

06:29:50.700 --> 06:29:57.340
although they've decreased in overall totals for the year one of operation than when they had

06:29:57.340 --> 06:30:01.900
previously submitted, it's still inconsistent with the grade level numbers that continue to

06:30:01.900 --> 06:30:07.180
trend in our district. Both district and both county boards determined that the petitioners

06:30:07.180 --> 06:30:13.980
were unlikely to successfully implement educational programs. The petition does not contain required

06:30:13.980 --> 06:30:20.140
signatures. The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all

06:30:20.140 --> 06:30:29.100
required elements. Their unrealistic enrollment plan is that the school intends to open in August,

06:30:29.100 --> 06:30:36.460
we are talking about the current year, not a delayed opening, with 168 pre-K through

06:30:36.460 --> 06:30:45.420
third grade students. Currently, we do have a seat-based school, which is Eilead Aguadulce,

06:30:46.140 --> 06:30:54.300
and in November in 2019, Eilead had a total of 124 students in TK through three, and as of right

06:30:54.300 --> 06:31:02.460
now, they have 137. Eilead is an established charter that actually has a school in the

06:31:02.940 --> 06:31:11.500
Santa Clarita Valley area, and they've been established in this area for over three years

06:31:11.500 --> 06:31:18.380
with a growth of only 13 students. And as these numbers were likely to result in a need

06:31:18.380 --> 06:31:25.820
for distance learning due to COVID-19, Act in Aguadulce Unified School District in November of

06:31:25.820 --> 06:31:36.060
2019, our preschool through third grade program had 265 students, and as of today, has 273.

06:31:36.060 --> 06:31:44.300
We have not seen an increase in student enrollment. That would be significant enough that would imply

06:31:44.300 --> 06:31:53.500
that the enrollment projections that Eagle Collegiate is proposing is reasonable. Those

06:31:53.500 --> 06:32:00.620
numbers are excessive, and although they have decreased the grade levels, they have not decreased

06:32:00.620 --> 06:32:04.620
the number of students in the grade levels that they propose to serve.

06:32:06.380 --> 06:32:12.460
I will now turn this over to Mr. Hartman. Good afternoon, Board members. My name is Jeff

06:32:12.460 --> 06:32:18.860
Hartman, and I work for the Los Angeles County Office of Education. Although LA County Board of

06:32:18.860 --> 06:32:24.780
Education adopted the same three findings stated previously by the local district, I will elaborate

06:32:24.780 --> 06:32:30.860
only on the issue that was found to be most concerning. The facility on which Eagle Collegiate

06:32:30.860 --> 06:32:37.500
Academy proposes to locate is not currently fit for use as a school, especially for children ages

06:32:37.500 --> 06:32:44.620
three to eight years old, which would occupy the site during year one. This is the same site ECA

06:32:44.620 --> 06:32:51.820
proposed to use at the appeal before this board last year on May 9th, 2019. The site is located

06:32:51.820 --> 06:32:58.140
on a 55 mile an hour stretch of Sierra Highway, a major commuting alternative to the State Route 14

06:32:58.140 --> 06:33:03.500
known as the Antelope Valley Freeway. As you can see on this slide, there are no signal lights,

06:33:03.500 --> 06:33:10.940
speed bumps, turning lanes, crosswalks that would accommodate the up to 168 families attempting to

06:33:10.940 --> 06:33:18.380
safely drop off and pick up their children twice each day. In addition, there is not fencing

06:33:18.380 --> 06:33:22.700
surrounding the entire site to keep these young children from accessing the adjacent highway,

06:33:23.340 --> 06:33:29.420
an on-site drainage culvert, or the vast undeveloped expanse of hilly countryside that borders the site

06:33:29.420 --> 06:33:35.020
to the south. We sent two representatives to the site on two occasions, and a report from our

06:33:35.020 --> 06:33:40.940
engineer stated that there was visible damage to both the foundation and roof of the main building,

06:33:40.940 --> 06:33:48.460
as well as evidence of copper wiring theft at this unoccupied facility. It was determined that not

06:33:48.460 --> 06:33:53.660
only does the provided engineering quote of a hundred thousand dollars greatly underestimate

06:33:53.660 --> 06:33:58.460
the costs that would be needed to make the site school ready, but that neither the petitioner nor

06:33:58.460 --> 06:34:03.580
the engineer have budgeted for the necessary permits and studies that would be needed prior

06:34:03.580 --> 06:34:10.140
to construction, making the proposed three-month timeline also unreasonable. Even with the additional

06:34:10.140 --> 06:34:16.780
time, the costs and studies needed to be completed prior to the project are not sufficiently

06:34:16.780 --> 06:34:23.180
addressed in a submitted budget. All of this is prior to the consideration of COVID-19. The

06:34:23.180 --> 06:34:28.060
petitioner plans to divide the sanctuary of this former church into classrooms using partitions.

06:34:28.860 --> 06:34:34.860
Much more expensive interior renovations would be needed to be done to make the building safe

06:34:34.860 --> 06:34:41.020
for the number of students they plan to serve. These concerns regarding the choice of facilities

06:34:41.020 --> 06:34:47.660
contribute to the finding by both the AAD-USD Board of Education and the LA County Board of

06:34:47.660 --> 06:34:52.860
Education that the petitioners would be unlikely to successfully implement their educational program.

06:34:53.580 --> 06:34:54.700
Next slide please.

06:34:58.860 --> 06:35:03.580
In conclusion, the Los Angeles County Board of Education recommends denial of this petition

06:35:03.580 --> 06:35:08.940
based on the three findings adopted by both the local district and county boards, that the

06:35:08.940 --> 06:35:13.820
petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the proposed educational program,

06:35:14.460 --> 06:35:19.100
that the petition does not contain the required number of signatures, and that the petition does

06:35:19.100 --> 06:35:22.780
not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all required elements.

06:35:23.500 --> 06:35:27.660
Thank you for your time. Representatives from both the district and county are available for

06:35:27.660 --> 06:35:43.340
questions. At this point, we'll open up the phone line for public comment

06:35:43.980 --> 06:35:48.860
um and allow people to get into the public comment queue. I guess we want to post that

06:35:49.500 --> 06:35:55.420
slide again in case people need to see it. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this

06:35:55.420 --> 06:36:08.060
item, there we go, may do so by calling 712-432-0075, entering the access code 651-905 pound, wait for the

06:36:08.060 --> 06:36:14.300
operator prompt to press star six and then another prompt to press one to enter the queue.

06:36:15.260 --> 06:36:21.260
Do we have anyone lined up for public comment yet? We have several callers that are in the queue.

06:36:22.300 --> 06:36:26.300
All right, we encourage you to state your name and affiliation for the record and

06:36:26.300 --> 06:36:30.860
remember to turn down the volume on your computers if you're following the live feed.

06:36:31.580 --> 06:36:36.940
Speakers will be limited to one minute each and I want to ask the translator to provide

06:36:37.020 --> 06:36:41.500
these instructions in Spanish for callers who need translation of their input.

06:36:48.380 --> 06:36:52.620
All right, is there Linda we were hoping the translator would

06:36:52.620 --> 06:36:56.220
jump in here and say it in Spanish. Is the translator listening?

06:37:02.540 --> 06:37:05.900
No, okay, we're gonna keep going Linda, sorry, keep going.

06:37:05.900 --> 06:37:15.020
Okay, the Spanish instructions are there to be read. So let's begin our public comment.

06:37:18.380 --> 06:37:22.300
First caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

06:37:22.300 --> 06:37:23.340
Your time starts now.

06:37:29.580 --> 06:37:34.860
Hi, good afternoon everyone and thank you for your consideration. Can we please have two minutes

06:37:34.860 --> 06:37:40.300
since it's myself Don Hakeem and my son Zane Hakeem would also like to speak?

06:37:42.940 --> 06:37:43.900
Yes, we'll allow that.

06:37:45.580 --> 06:37:51.900
Thank you. My name is Don and I am a parent with considerable charter school background and

06:37:51.900 --> 06:37:58.620
experience and we have been involved with Eagle Collegiate Academy for the past two years.

06:37:59.260 --> 06:38:06.620
I believe passionately that they absolutely will do a fantastic job with your IV program.

06:38:07.180 --> 06:38:11.980
They have been in front of you. This is their second time. They've been to

06:38:11.980 --> 06:38:19.900
Atena Cuedosa a few times and with every suggestion that has been made, every feedback,

06:38:19.900 --> 06:38:26.620
they have soaked it up and made those changes. This is a team that is showing great flexibility

06:38:26.620 --> 06:38:33.420
and they're willing to work with whoever authorizes them. They are backed by a group

06:38:33.420 --> 06:38:40.380
of strong parents who want to help, who want to volunteer, who will be doing work at the

06:38:40.380 --> 06:38:46.940
facility, who will be giving their services. I myself am a skilled human resources professional

06:38:46.940 --> 06:38:54.940
and I will be helping. I was on the board for charter school so I have considerable

06:38:54.940 --> 06:39:00.540
charter school experience. I think that we're comparing apples to oranges when we say that

06:39:01.500 --> 06:39:06.380
Atena Cuedosa has low enrollment, that iLEAD has low enrollment because

06:39:06.380 --> 06:39:10.140
iLEAD has schools operating very close to the Atena-

06:39:10.140 --> 06:39:15.180
That's your time for your first speaker. Can you please go to your second speaker? Thank you.

06:39:15.180 --> 06:39:29.420
Hi, so I do better. I'm Zain Hakim and I'm 12 years old and I do better in a smaller learning

06:39:29.420 --> 06:39:35.500
environment because the teachers can help me focus on things that I didn't get,

06:39:37.100 --> 06:39:42.860
I couldn't understand in class and it's a lot easier for me to work in a charter school type

06:39:42.860 --> 06:39:50.780
environment and there's a lot of children and learners like me. I'm currently in a private school

06:39:50.780 --> 06:39:57.900
and it is smaller and it has helped me a lot with individual attention and this year my

06:39:57.900 --> 06:40:02.940
grades are significantly better than last year's and I've improved on my organization,

06:40:02.940 --> 06:40:08.940
other skills that I needed to do better and Dr. Johnson has helped me immensely.

06:40:08.940 --> 06:40:15.500
Thank you. She's been a great influence in my life. Thank you for your consideration.

06:40:20.220 --> 06:40:22.940
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record

06:40:22.940 --> 06:40:24.780
and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

06:40:30.060 --> 06:40:37.820
Good afternoon board members. This is Dr. Oscar Scott. I am calling in support of approval of

06:40:37.820 --> 06:40:45.180
Eagle Collegiate Collegiate Academy. I have known Dr. Ogo Johnson for nearly 30 years

06:40:45.740 --> 06:40:53.020
and I would like to speak to her character. So much in regards to making decisions are made in

06:40:53.020 --> 06:41:01.740
regards to statistics but you have to have character and determination and drive and Dr.

06:41:01.740 --> 06:41:08.860
Johnson is well respected in the educational community. I have never known her to take on a

06:41:08.860 --> 06:41:16.540
project where she has never been successful with. So I really urge with the bottom of my heart

06:41:17.100 --> 06:41:27.660
that you would not rely so much on cold statistics but you would rely on the burning desire of Dr.

06:41:27.660 --> 06:41:35.740
Johnson and I respectfully request time of this consideration and approval. Thank you very much

06:41:35.740 --> 06:41:40.700
for your consideration. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record

06:41:40.700 --> 06:41:49.340
and begin speaking. Your time starts now. State board members, this is Sheila Whitley and I

06:41:49.340 --> 06:41:55.180
represent the California Teachers Association. CTA recommends that the State Board of Education

06:41:55.180 --> 06:42:01.660
vote to deny the petition of establishment for Eagle Collegiate Academy as recommended by the

06:42:01.660 --> 06:42:08.780
California Department of Education. ECA is demonstrably unlikely to implement the program

06:42:08.780 --> 06:42:15.740
set forth in the petition due to an unrealistic financial and operational plan including aggressive

06:42:15.740 --> 06:42:22.060
enrollment assumptions and their petition is not consistent with sound educational practice.

06:42:22.060 --> 06:42:28.140
The ECA petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all of the required

06:42:28.140 --> 06:42:34.940
elements including elements one, two, four, and five. The state board should deny the Eagle Collegiate

06:42:34.940 --> 06:42:40.780
petition and ask the Eagle Collegiate Academy to stop their continued attempts that are wasting

06:42:40.780 --> 06:42:46.380
taxpayer funds and burdening the staff of the district, county, and CBE. Thank you.

06:42:46.380 --> 06:42:54.780
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

06:42:58.860 --> 06:43:07.020
Hello, my name is Andrea Douglas. I'm an associate at Eagle Collegiate Academy. Very nervous. I just

06:43:07.020 --> 06:43:13.740
want to say that LA USC currently has over 229 charter schools and Senate Corita does not have

06:43:13.740 --> 06:43:19.180
any. I think that your approval will give us this additional educational opportunity

06:43:19.180 --> 06:43:23.580
to meet the diverse educational needs and priorities of all students and families

06:43:23.580 --> 06:43:27.100
in the Santa Clarita area. Thank you so much for your time.

06:43:29.900 --> 06:43:33.740
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:43:37.820 --> 06:43:41.100
This is Katlyn O'Halloran with the Charter Schools Development Center.

06:43:41.100 --> 06:43:47.180
CSCC has worked with ECA for several years. The lead petitioner, Ogo Johnson, contacted CSCC the

06:43:47.180 --> 06:43:53.100
first time she brought her petition to Acton-Olga Dulce and CSCC has continued to work with her as

06:43:53.100 --> 06:43:58.780
she moves her charter through the appeals process. Ms. Johnson and her team have been responsive and

06:43:58.780 --> 06:44:05.740
reflective and has made the changes suggested to them by the CDE analysis and by ACCS. We've seen

06:44:05.740 --> 06:44:10.780
her enrollment data, facilities plans, and her balance budget and remain confident that even in

06:44:10.780 --> 06:44:15.740
these challenging times, ECA is a school that will attract a diverse student body and will offer

06:44:15.740 --> 06:44:20.860
a strong educational program. As such, we urge you to grant ECA's charter. Thank you.

06:44:23.260 --> 06:44:27.260
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts

06:44:27.260 --> 06:44:36.380
now. My name is Paulina Johnson and as a member of the public I'm expressing my support for the

06:44:36.380 --> 06:44:41.260
approval of Eagle Collegiate Academy. I believe the students who will be served by the school

06:44:41.260 --> 06:44:48.860
deserve the opportunity to attend it. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

06:44:48.860 --> 06:44:57.500
for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now. Hello, my name is Chad Jackson and

06:44:57.500 --> 06:45:02.460
as a member of the public representing public interest, I support ECA and I wish to see it

06:45:02.460 --> 06:45:07.100
recommended for approval as I believe that this charter will have a positive impact and create

06:45:07.100 --> 06:45:12.460
effective relationships with the people and the businesses of the Santa Clarita Agua Dulce community

06:45:13.260 --> 06:45:19.260
that it will occupy. And as a member of that community, I would love to see this charter be

06:45:19.260 --> 06:45:25.900
approved to serve this community well. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

06:45:25.900 --> 06:45:35.820
for the record. Your time starts now. My name is Tyler Goldstein. As a member of the public,

06:45:35.820 --> 06:45:40.460
I would like to express my support for Eagle Collegiate Academy. In these increasingly

06:45:40.460 --> 06:45:45.820
uncertain times, parents and children benefit from an increase in the choices they have in pursuing

06:45:45.820 --> 06:45:51.820
and achieving a quality education and I believe that Eagle Collegiate Academy will add an incredible

06:45:51.820 --> 06:46:00.220
value to the options that are currently available. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and

06:46:00.220 --> 06:46:08.300
affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now. Good afternoon. My name is

06:46:08.300 --> 06:46:13.020
Isabella Jones and I'm a member of the public interest and support of the approval of Eagle

06:46:13.020 --> 06:46:18.940
Collegiate Academy. Many families in our city and surrounding areas have their kids homeschooled,

06:46:18.940 --> 06:46:23.820
some have higher private teachers, some drive all the way to San Fernando Valley and search

06:46:23.820 --> 06:46:29.020
of choice schools. Some have opted for some blend of these different methods for years.

06:46:29.020 --> 06:46:34.860
I've had friends wake up very early in the morning to travel to a school for a better education.

06:46:34.860 --> 06:46:41.980
The application by ECA will bring these students on board to do the strong commitment by ECA for

06:46:41.980 --> 06:46:51.340
robust parent involvement. While LAUSD has over total 229 charter schools, San Antonio does not

06:46:51.340 --> 06:46:57.500
have a charter school. Please approve this great educational alternative and choice, especially for

06:46:57.500 --> 06:47:03.500
our Black and Brown children and families to meet the diverse educational needs and priorities for

06:47:03.500 --> 06:47:10.060
all students and families. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

06:47:10.060 --> 06:47:21.740
record and begin speaking. Your time starts now. Hello. My name is Kristen James and I am a supporter

06:47:21.740 --> 06:47:28.940
of Eagle Collegiate Academy. This is a sound program and good for our community. Please listen to us

06:47:29.900 --> 06:47:35.100
and approve Eagle Collegiate Academy. We know what our children need. Thank you.

06:47:35.100 --> 06:47:40.300
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

06:47:40.300 --> 06:47:49.660
Your time starts now. Debbie Rodriguez, supporter of school choice in Santa Clarita Valley.

06:47:50.380 --> 06:47:56.700
I have had the honor of being the founding office manager for both charter schools in our valley.

06:47:56.700 --> 06:48:03.820
That would be SCVI and Albert Einstein Academy. Two very different programs but needed

06:48:04.380 --> 06:48:10.780
in our community. When Albert Einstein surrendered their charter, it was a huge loss for our community.

06:48:11.580 --> 06:48:19.500
Students were forced back into their home schools or some families chose to home school or put them

06:48:19.500 --> 06:48:27.900
in private school because there was no other choice. Eagle Collegiate provides that other choice

06:48:28.540 --> 06:48:36.140
and is desperately needed for our families. And being the office manager at AEA, we had families

06:48:36.140 --> 06:48:42.380
where one child attended our school, the other child attended their home school, or even the

06:48:42.380 --> 06:48:50.540
other child attended SCVI. Different programs for different learners and how lucky were those? Time.

06:48:50.540 --> 06:48:56.060
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

06:48:56.060 --> 06:49:04.940
Your time starts now. Good afternoon board members and a warm welcome to our new board members.

06:49:04.940 --> 06:49:09.500
My name is Janelle Rooley. I'm an attorney with the losses of young mini and core here today in

06:49:09.500 --> 06:49:14.780
strong support of Eagle Collegiate Academy and urging your yes vote for approval. Eagle Collegiate

06:49:14.780 --> 06:49:19.180
represents a remarkable story of perseverance and commitment. These are the kinds of petitioners the

06:49:19.180 --> 06:49:23.980
legislature imagined back in 1992 when it passed the charter schools act. Parents and educators

06:49:23.980 --> 06:49:28.380
coming together to provide choice and unique opportunities for a very localized student

06:49:28.380 --> 06:49:32.780
population. They're not backed by large organizations. This is truly a grassroots

06:49:32.780 --> 06:49:37.740
group. And the charter petition meets legal requirements. As you've heard, the CDE has three

06:49:37.740 --> 06:49:42.140
times determined the educational program to be sound. We cannot fathom why that assessment

06:49:42.140 --> 06:49:47.340
changed just in the two weeks since ACCS. ECA has a facility and it's ready to break ground

06:49:47.340 --> 06:49:52.780
on improvement. ECA can manage through apportionment deferrals. And for each charter element, the CDE

06:49:52.780 --> 06:49:57.660
deemed not to be reasonably comprehensive. A condition was offered to mitigate that designation.

06:49:57.660 --> 06:50:02.620
ECA agrees to these conditions. Eagle Collegiate has passed all of the tests. It's jumped through

06:50:02.620 --> 06:50:06.860
all of the time. It's met those legal requirements. We ask the state board to follow the mandate and

06:50:06.860 --> 06:50:13.820
approve this charter petition. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

06:50:13.820 --> 06:50:21.980
record and begin speaking. Your time starts now. Hello, state board members. I'm Elizabeth

06:50:21.980 --> 06:50:26.780
Chivlett and I'll be teaching art as one of the highly qualified teachers at Eagle

06:50:26.780 --> 06:50:33.900
Collegiate Academy. Our school will accommodate a diverse population of students. We will have

06:50:33.900 --> 06:50:40.540
staff and resources necessary to provide appropriate special education for children

06:50:40.540 --> 06:50:47.500
with additional needs. ECA will also offer the international baccalaureate program

06:50:47.980 --> 06:50:54.940
that trains teachers and gives them ongoing support. Students benefit from the IB program

06:50:54.940 --> 06:51:00.620
by gaining a deeper understanding of subject matter and learning the important skills they

06:51:00.620 --> 06:51:07.820
will need for a successful future in the 21st century. For these reasons, I'd like to ask for

06:51:07.820 --> 06:51:15.180
your approval of Eagle Collegiate Academy so that we can offer our community students and their

06:51:15.180 --> 06:51:24.060
parents this unique and valuable educational opportunity. Thank you. Next caller, please state

06:51:24.060 --> 06:51:27.500
your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

06:51:32.060 --> 06:51:38.700
My name is Jones Okeke. I support Eagle Collegiate Academy. I'm a teacher with Eagle Collegiate

06:51:38.700 --> 06:51:45.740
Academy and I have a level two specialist education instruction credential. Eagle Collegiate

06:51:45.740 --> 06:51:52.380
Academy will have a unique group of skilled and dedicated faculty members who are patient,

06:51:52.380 --> 06:51:58.220
knowledgeable, caring, and have drive for self-improvement. At ECA, the faculty will

06:51:58.220 --> 06:52:05.020
place greater emphasis on refined skills and digital teaching tools. Please grant approval

06:52:05.020 --> 06:52:13.740
for ECA today. ECA staff are determined to integrate electronic learning, remote teaching,

06:52:13.740 --> 06:52:19.660
and virtual education as components of its overall educational model. Teachers will be

06:52:19.660 --> 06:52:26.220
set to use online classrooms and interactive platforms to deliver lessons and assignments.

06:52:26.780 --> 06:52:32.620
The goal of ECA will be to adequately prepare our students for tomorrow's job

06:52:32.620 --> 06:52:36.220
and to be well rounded. Time. Thank you.

06:52:38.540 --> 06:52:42.300
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time

06:52:42.300 --> 06:52:53.740
starts now. Good afternoon. My name is Ernest Carr speaking on the behalf of Eagle Collegiate

06:52:53.740 --> 06:53:01.260
Academy. I'm a retired educator teacher, school administrator, and one of the pool of retired

06:53:01.260 --> 06:53:06.780
educators who is volunteering to support the operations of the academy with my skills and

06:53:06.780 --> 06:53:13.820
time. I believe the academy will provide access, rigorous college preparation for students,

06:53:13.820 --> 06:53:19.820
especially underrepresented and socioeconomic disadvantaged children who need this access

06:53:19.820 --> 06:53:25.900
the most. Every child deserves a quality education no matter the socioeconomic status of their

06:53:25.900 --> 06:53:31.580
parents or guardians. Black and brown children especially must be given the opportunity

06:53:31.580 --> 06:53:37.020
for the access into a rigorous college preparatory program, an education environment that is

06:53:37.020 --> 06:53:42.460
positive as well as emotional psychologically nurturing. The academy will provide this access

06:53:42.460 --> 06:53:47.980
through its international baccalaureate program that will start in primary schools. Please

06:53:47.980 --> 06:53:59.420
allow the families of Santa Clarita. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

06:54:01.740 --> 06:54:19.980
I don't know if that was somebody trying to speak but we couldn't hear them.

06:54:19.980 --> 06:54:35.580
Hello? Yes. Oh, can you hear me? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. Does my time begin yet?

06:54:38.780 --> 06:54:40.860
I think it's about to begin. Thank you.

06:54:40.860 --> 06:54:51.260
Thank you. Start now. Oh, I'm sorry. My name is Derek Hill. I'm sorry. I'm one of the

06:54:52.220 --> 06:54:58.140
founding staff members of ECA and we've been struggling to go ahead and get this approval

06:54:58.140 --> 06:55:01.820
and I believe we're going to go ahead and continue to work at getting better and getting this

06:55:01.820 --> 06:55:08.700
approval. I just recommend that if the state could just work with us and approve us because

06:55:08.700 --> 06:55:12.700
we're going to keep going and with Dr. Johnson's guidance, she's going to be diligent to get this

06:55:12.700 --> 06:55:19.100
approval. Everything that we've been asked to do to make it happen and work, we've been doing it.

06:55:19.100 --> 06:55:24.940
We've been following all the necessary steps and we're just excited to get started. Most of the

06:55:24.940 --> 06:55:29.100
staff have kids. Our kids are going to be ready to go ahead and go to school there. I have two

06:55:29.100 --> 06:55:36.780
school-aged kids and we're excited and I know we on Facebook, we've been petitioning and getting

06:55:36.780 --> 06:55:43.260
kids and families involved to come to our school and we're ready to go. If you can

06:55:43.260 --> 06:55:49.100
approve of us and look out for us, we will definitely make this school happen and we will

06:55:49.100 --> 06:55:54.140
populate this school. All right. Thank you for your time and thank you for listening to us.

06:55:54.860 --> 06:56:03.180
We will not go away. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

06:56:29.180 --> 06:56:36.060
My kids can't wait for the school to open for them to attend to the school. I'm

06:56:36.060 --> 06:56:43.660
waiting for you guys to approve Yubu College Academy. Thank you so much.

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

06:56:53.660 --> 06:56:54.700
Your time starts now.

06:56:59.500 --> 06:57:06.700
Hello, my name is Ujechi Amako. I'm a mother of two and I'm highly in support of ECA.

06:57:06.700 --> 06:57:13.660
I've worked closely with Dr. Oko Johnson, who is the CEO and founder of ECA, and I tell you,

06:57:13.660 --> 06:57:19.180
she's not going to fail. She's a very hardworking professional teacher and she has been in

06:57:19.180 --> 06:57:25.260
academic for a long time. And I tell you, Rome is not built in a day. We are not to be limited

06:57:25.260 --> 06:57:32.300
by looking at the structure, which I know Oko Johnson will do her best to have a quality,

06:57:33.420 --> 06:57:41.500
approve structural, everything she needed to do, she will do and fix it up. She has done that

06:57:41.500 --> 06:57:46.540
for this past, all this past while that you've complained about this and that she has worked

06:57:46.540 --> 06:57:53.500
so hard tirelessly to put up structures in place. And I believe the board will be disappointed in

06:57:53.500 --> 06:57:59.580
future because she's even coming from a pure African background. She started in Nigeria and

06:57:59.580 --> 06:58:04.860
came over here and worked to, you know, the peak of her career. And I tell you, she's a single mother

06:58:04.860 --> 06:58:10.060
of four and raised four kids that successfully finished college and are very responsible. And

06:58:10.060 --> 06:58:17.100
she will do every to her utmost best to make sure every child, every, no matter the color,

06:58:17.100 --> 06:58:21.580
black or brown or yellow, gets the best in life. Thank you.

06:58:24.300 --> 06:58:27.580
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking.

06:58:27.580 --> 06:58:28.620
Your time starts now.

06:58:32.700 --> 06:58:37.740
Good afternoon, Ken Higginboth and Eagle Collegiate Academy. And as president of the

06:58:37.740 --> 06:58:43.420
board of directors, I am proud to extend my many years of executive leadership and

06:58:43.420 --> 06:58:49.740
operational experience to the mission and success of the ECA. Being the proud grandparent of two

06:58:49.740 --> 06:58:57.020
grandchildren that attend charter schools, one just graduated class of 2020, honors students,

06:58:57.020 --> 06:59:04.620
the high quality of learning, individual growth, academic achievement and enrichment make ECA the

06:59:04.620 --> 06:59:10.860
pinnacle of a top tier educational institution, greatly benefiting the children and their

06:59:10.860 --> 06:59:18.220
families. The foundation for success is evident and strong. Approval of this petition is paramount

06:59:18.220 --> 06:59:23.660
in providing educational options in this cultural and ethnic diversified community

06:59:23.660 --> 06:59:29.100
where black and brown children's education strongly matters. In conclusion, there is

06:59:29.100 --> 06:59:33.420
no other public school option in Santa Clarita. Thank you.

06:59:35.260 --> 06:59:40.860
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time starts now.

06:59:52.780 --> 06:59:55.980
Okay, that caller hung up. We do have additional callers now that are in the

06:59:55.980 --> 06:59:59.420
participant queue, so I will ask them if they would like to make a comment.

07:00:04.620 --> 07:00:07.500
Hello, did you wish to make a comment for item 17?

07:00:18.140 --> 07:00:23.100
Good afternoon board members. This is Brian Kite, managing principal of SRK Architects. I'm the

07:00:23.100 --> 07:00:32.620
architect that has been retained to assist Euclid Academy. We have investigated the site. We believe

07:00:32.620 --> 07:00:38.860
the site is completely feasible for use as a school. The issues that have been raised

07:00:38.860 --> 07:00:46.300
relative to the county were done very early. Oh dear, we just lost you.

07:00:50.300 --> 07:00:56.220
Am I back now? Yes. Thank you. We're still going through our public comments at this time.

07:00:56.780 --> 07:01:05.100
I'm sorry. Are you calling as a public commenter? I must have misunderstood that this was that I

07:01:05.100 --> 07:01:13.820
saw a notice notification of 17, so I just spoke, but I can speak. We're still doing public comments,

07:01:13.820 --> 07:01:19.420
so Shauna, go ahead and continue with public comment. We'll come back to you for questions.

07:01:19.580 --> 07:01:21.500
Thank you. We'll come back to you for questions.

07:01:25.260 --> 07:01:28.300
Caller, did you wish to provide public comment for item 17?

07:01:29.580 --> 07:01:35.100
Yes, I do. Please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin speaking. Your time

07:01:35.100 --> 07:01:45.260
starts now. My name is Ayodeji Ido. I am a resident of Santa Clarita Valley, a parent,

07:01:45.260 --> 07:01:51.660
and supporter of Eagle College Academy. I'm also a friend of a parent of two children

07:01:52.220 --> 07:01:58.860
who can hardly wait to send their children to ECA as soon as it opens its door. I attended a

07:01:58.860 --> 07:02:04.620
presentation about the school and I love the international baccalaureate program. I also like

07:02:04.620 --> 07:02:11.340
the fact that the children will be at the school from pre-K to A grade with the teachers and staff

07:02:11.340 --> 07:02:16.540
that already know them and watch them grow. I am one of the families that filed a petition about

07:02:16.540 --> 07:02:22.460
the school and I was determined to keep fighting until we get the school approved. Please listen

07:02:22.460 --> 07:02:30.060
to us as parents and educators because we know what our children need. Children also learn in

07:02:30.060 --> 07:02:38.220
different ways and we need to realize one side does not fit. So please hear our voice and approve

07:02:38.220 --> 07:02:41.100
Eagle College Academy for our children. Thank you.

07:02:44.940 --> 07:02:49.340
Hello caller, did you wish to make a comment, a public comment on item 17?

07:02:56.460 --> 07:02:58.940
Caller, did you wish to make a comment on item 17?

07:03:02.620 --> 07:03:07.740
Yes, hello. Yes, please state your name and affiliation for the record and begin

07:03:07.740 --> 07:03:16.460
speaking. Your time starts now. Hello. I can hear you.

07:03:20.860 --> 07:03:23.820
Yes, we can hear you. Please begin speaking and we'll start your time.

07:03:25.100 --> 07:03:32.940
Okay, thank you. Yes, my name is Eliana Howe. I hold a teaching credential and I have known

07:03:33.020 --> 07:03:41.900
Dr. Over Johnson for over 10 years and I know that she's doing everything possible to have

07:03:41.900 --> 07:03:49.580
the school provide all the necessary things for this community such as great education,

07:03:50.780 --> 07:03:57.820
emotional support for the students and a safe and an amazing place to learn.

07:03:58.460 --> 07:04:07.340
So I'm just calling to give my support and I pray and hope that you also support the school. Thank you.

07:04:13.260 --> 07:04:17.900
Caller, did you wish to make a public comment for item 17?

07:04:20.380 --> 07:04:26.300
Hello. Hello caller, would you like to make a public comment for item 17?

07:04:27.820 --> 07:04:35.500
At this time we have no additional callers in the participant queue.

07:04:38.700 --> 07:04:44.700
Okay, I guess we lost that last one. Thank you very much to everyone who presented and

07:04:45.660 --> 07:04:56.700
took the time to make public comment. At this point I want to ask, I'm going to close the public

07:04:56.700 --> 07:05:03.340
hearing at 4 57 p.m. and commence with board discussion and action. I want to ask Ting's son

07:05:03.340 --> 07:05:09.020
as our state board liaison if she has initial comments then we'll move into discussion.

07:05:15.340 --> 07:05:20.860
So well first of all I really appreciate the petitioners for their persistence and

07:05:20.860 --> 07:05:31.100
perseverance and enthusiasm in their presentations and I have seen the petitioners and their

07:05:31.100 --> 07:05:41.260
efforts to address concerns that the state board had expressed in their petition a year ago.

07:05:42.060 --> 07:05:49.020
I'm also extremely impressed by the overwhelming support of the community members who had called in

07:05:49.900 --> 07:05:56.780
for this school and clearly this is an area that needs school choice.

07:05:57.340 --> 07:06:02.300
So I'll just leave it for that as an intro for now and then have my fellow board members ask

07:06:02.300 --> 07:06:08.220
any questions that they have. Okay, I'm going to take the prerogative of the chair and

07:06:09.500 --> 07:06:13.100
say a couple of things and ask a few questions and then we'll get the ball rolling with

07:06:13.820 --> 07:06:20.780
others. I also remember when Eagle Collegiate came to the board just a year ago

07:06:22.300 --> 07:06:27.500
and there clearly is there was enthusiasm from members of the community then and there's clearly

07:06:27.500 --> 07:06:35.100
still enthusiasm from members of the community now. I am not concerned about the enrollment

07:06:35.100 --> 07:06:40.940
projections because I think there was a pretty persuasive case made that this really serves

07:06:40.940 --> 07:06:48.540
multiple districts. It is a community that has an alarming number of non-classroom based

07:06:49.260 --> 07:06:57.740
charters and homeschooled students so there is sort of a felt need for many places for this kind

07:06:57.740 --> 07:07:05.340
of a school. I'm not concerned about the quality of the IB program because I know that program

07:07:05.340 --> 07:07:11.180
well and it's a very high quality program with embedded assessments and I know IB has pledged

07:07:11.180 --> 07:07:18.860
to work with this school and I see the determination that the school has. I would like to ask

07:07:21.180 --> 07:07:26.380
about several issues however that have been raised and we need to hear more about them.

07:07:27.020 --> 07:07:33.340
So I'd like to ask the petitioner to be available and also the architect who was

07:07:34.140 --> 07:07:40.540
calling in a few minutes ago. One of my questions has to do with the

07:07:41.900 --> 07:07:49.420
facility and the plans to make it safe and adequate for students. A second question I have

07:07:49.980 --> 07:07:54.140
has to do with the training for staff around the international baccalaureate program

07:07:54.780 --> 07:08:03.020
and then I'll have some other questions about timing. So is the architect with us?

07:08:03.900 --> 07:08:11.260
I am. Can you continue the thoughts you are going to share with us? Sure thank you so much.

07:08:11.820 --> 07:08:19.260
So we were retained about three months ago in order to begin work on the ministerial site plan

07:08:19.260 --> 07:08:23.740
review for the county and so I do believe that there was an overlap of information. We did our

07:08:23.740 --> 07:08:31.980
due diligence about about three months ago as I said. We believe that the site is accessible

07:08:31.980 --> 07:08:37.340
from the perspective that the buildings themselves are set back. They were originally

07:08:37.340 --> 07:08:45.260
buildings designed originally for high occupancy and so a school is a very reasonable and normal

07:08:45.260 --> 07:08:51.420
from our practice experience change of use from the existing use to the proposed use as a school.

07:08:51.980 --> 07:08:59.900
We've done layouts both the site plan layouts as well as traffic studies. We retained a civil

07:08:59.900 --> 07:09:07.340
traffic engineer to assist in striping that would be required to allow for adequate access

07:09:07.340 --> 07:09:13.500
to the site. We've just completed a queuing study for the for the property to determine

07:09:14.460 --> 07:09:24.540
based upon the one hour eight o'clock worst case scenario of 168 parents arriving by automobile

07:09:25.180 --> 07:09:32.140
and queuing up and there is plenty of space. The site itself has two acres of essentially flat land

07:09:32.700 --> 07:09:40.220
and because of the layout we believe and we've done studies to determine that not only is it

07:09:40.220 --> 07:09:50.140
adequate for the initial pre-k through three there is space flat space available for additional

07:09:50.220 --> 07:09:55.500
modulars for the future. So we believe that the site has all the components that a good school

07:09:55.500 --> 07:10:01.740
should have and we wholeheartedly support it and we put our name behind the fact that we believe we

07:10:01.740 --> 07:10:09.980
can adequately get permits for the process for the school as the time would allow.

07:10:11.500 --> 07:10:18.220
And I assume that in the course of your analysis you've evaluated the ability to have adequate

07:10:18.220 --> 07:10:27.500
fencing and so on between the site and the yes because yes thank you board member since the

07:10:27.500 --> 07:10:33.980
the site is not currently occupied the temporary fence has been put up but there is along sierra

07:10:33.980 --> 07:10:41.420
highway there's about 300 or so feet that would have new fencing place. The owner of the property

07:10:41.420 --> 07:10:47.580
separate from the school itself has also stepped up to the plate with commitments to do all of the

07:10:47.580 --> 07:10:53.340
what we call shell and core work separate from the tenant improvement work to convert the interior.

07:10:53.340 --> 07:11:01.020
So the we believe that a budget for both is will be required and the landowner with your approval

07:11:01.020 --> 07:11:06.940
of school there in this in the site will initiate a significant amount of improvement to the property

07:11:06.940 --> 07:11:14.300
that would be normal. It was referenced about the theft of the copper wiring in our experience in

07:11:14.300 --> 07:11:19.660
any site that is not in use the copper wiring will be stripped out and that is very normal.

07:11:19.660 --> 07:11:25.100
They've already committed to replacing that so that puts back the there's plenty of power to the

07:11:25.100 --> 07:11:33.340
site more than 400 amps to the site so we feel that the basic infrastructure is there but it

07:11:33.340 --> 07:11:39.420
does need to be completed in order to to make it permissible. We do lots of school work and we

07:11:39.500 --> 07:11:46.540
think that this is a perfectly great structure and site for this use. Can I ask you how long

07:11:46.540 --> 07:11:53.260
you think it would take to do that work? Sure permits are not the easiest thing we'd love to

07:11:53.260 --> 07:12:01.180
have we'd love to have six months to do that but it's the permit cost or time that it that it that

07:12:01.180 --> 07:12:07.580
is required more so I think that the the notion of doing it in a month is probably difficult but

07:12:09.500 --> 07:12:14.620
that's in part because of the elapsed time that's gone by you know since earlier earlier this year.

07:12:14.620 --> 07:12:22.300
Yeah I have another question for the plaintiff I mean without the plaintiff

07:12:24.060 --> 07:12:30.460
it does feel a little like a court of law doesn't it for the petitioner and let's see if we can

07:12:30.460 --> 07:12:38.220
find you on our zoom screen here so I wonder if you can talk to the question of training

07:12:39.580 --> 07:12:45.260
I'm not sure that credentialing is a problem because you're planning to be TK through grade

07:12:45.260 --> 07:12:55.020
eight and there's most of those grades hold a common credential but IB is you know a fairly

07:12:55.820 --> 07:13:02.780
serious change from much of the curriculum experience that many people have had so can

07:13:02.780 --> 07:13:08.860
you talk to us about what the plans are for training staff for the IB curriculum? Yes ma'am

07:13:09.740 --> 07:13:15.980
thank you honorable madam president yes we plan to train our teachers and it's a requirement

07:13:15.980 --> 07:13:22.220
by IB anyway before the school starts one of the things that we plan to do or we had hoped to be

07:13:22.220 --> 07:13:28.860
able to do was to have a two-day in-person training whereby IB will send their specialist

07:13:28.860 --> 07:13:35.180
to the school and train the teachers and that's the required training that a two and a half days

07:13:36.140 --> 07:13:42.300
teachers are supposed to have so they're going to do a training on how to create the lesson plans

07:13:42.300 --> 07:13:49.980
how to assess the resources that IB has already for them and then how to be able to receive help

07:13:49.980 --> 07:13:57.180
as they go along the way so the IB requires about two and a half days to get the clock hours

07:13:57.180 --> 07:14:02.620
needed for teachers to get started there are three categories of IB training the very first

07:14:02.620 --> 07:14:08.620
one which is a category one is for those who have never been in an IB at all and that's

07:14:08.620 --> 07:14:13.500
understandable because IB is not you know here and there where there are teachers who have done it

07:14:13.500 --> 07:14:20.780
before so IB recognizes that and as a result they plan to train you and they don't require that so

07:14:20.780 --> 07:14:25.580
category one is for teachers who've never been in IB and they teach you and train you and help you

07:14:25.580 --> 07:14:31.580
to get your resources your training materials by the time that training is over you would have

07:14:31.580 --> 07:14:37.740
your lesson plans and resources ready to guide you at least for a long time into the into the

07:14:37.740 --> 07:14:43.100
year and then there's category two which you participate in after you've already talked

07:14:43.100 --> 07:14:48.700
for a little bit and then there's category three for those who are flying you know that will do

07:14:48.700 --> 07:14:53.820
that along the way so we are working with a specialist have been working with us for almost

07:14:53.820 --> 07:15:00.540
four years and they are willing and ready to come to the school and train but because of COVID

07:15:00.540 --> 07:15:06.220
there is also online training that teachers can participate in and you go through and receive the

07:15:06.220 --> 07:15:12.860
same quality materials and instruction during that online training for teachers to to have

07:15:12.860 --> 07:15:17.660
in order to prepare them and that's one of the things that excites parents about this program

07:15:17.660 --> 07:15:23.740
the fact that they know that IB requires training and that they're not just going to have teachers

07:15:23.740 --> 07:15:30.940
who are not trained to teach as they provide curricular materials i know but two days of

07:15:30.940 --> 07:15:38.780
training is very modest so what is the plan beyond the two days absolutely and we have that in the

07:15:38.780 --> 07:15:44.220
in the petition as well so we're going one of the things that we built into our schedule is a

07:15:44.220 --> 07:15:51.180
wednesday training and so we have a mini monday a half day on every wednesday just devoted to

07:15:51.180 --> 07:15:55.900
training professional development is one of the things that we take to heart because we know that

07:15:55.900 --> 07:16:00.620
we can't hold teachers accountable if we're not giving them the tools and the skills they need

07:16:00.620 --> 07:16:08.860
so every wednesday teachers have the two hours every every week to just focus on pd and also

07:16:08.860 --> 07:16:14.940
collaborating with each other so it's an ongoing weekly training throughout the year you know that

07:16:15.580 --> 07:16:23.580
and does IB also provide coaching along the way and is there a plan for tier two and three training

07:16:24.380 --> 07:16:29.740
yes IB does provide coaching and they will come and visit the school and that's one of the things

07:16:29.740 --> 07:16:35.180
they have to do once you apply for candidates because i have taken this IB school leader

07:16:35.180 --> 07:16:41.980
training we are really able to now become candidates once we're approved and then they

07:16:41.980 --> 07:16:47.340
will come because we are assigned an IB specialist that will tell you what training you need to take

07:16:47.340 --> 07:16:53.580
when you need to take it sequentially throughout the year so there is a plan for that coaching

07:16:53.580 --> 07:16:59.420
and support throughout the year okay thank you very much those are my two pressing questions i

07:16:59.420 --> 07:17:05.820
want to see if other members of the board have comments or questions looking for hands i see

07:17:06.460 --> 07:17:08.140
um Cynthia Glover Woods

07:17:12.300 --> 07:17:20.860
thank you um really just a couple of comments um a very strong program and again a lot of kudos for

07:17:20.860 --> 07:17:26.300
the support in the community for the program i of course this is my first board meeting so i

07:17:26.300 --> 07:17:31.100
didn't have the pleasure of listening to the petition when it came forward the last time but

07:17:31.100 --> 07:17:36.540
it seems evident from my fellow board member comments and from staff that there has been a

07:17:36.540 --> 07:17:42.540
lot of work done i do have a concern as was expressed by president Darlingham and regarding

07:17:42.540 --> 07:17:49.820
the facility and the preparation of the facility and the thought of a august 2020 opening seems

07:17:49.820 --> 07:17:56.460
like an extremely heavy lift considering we're in the month of july so i'm just a point of

07:17:56.540 --> 07:18:04.060
consideration as far as if there might be benefit of moving forward with the school but doing so in

07:18:04.060 --> 07:18:10.780
the next year so that there's sufficient time for facilities to be prepared for adequate training

07:18:10.780 --> 07:18:16.060
in the ib program and other aspects and also to clean up some of the other areas that has been

07:18:16.060 --> 07:18:22.300
brought forward in the board item related to the school site council membership and other pieces of

07:18:22.300 --> 07:18:28.540
that sort so i'm just just a thought on how we might be able to possibly move forward and do

07:18:28.540 --> 07:18:36.140
some cleanup yeah that could i piggyback on that and sort of ask the question um you know given

07:18:36.140 --> 07:18:42.220
that you already have some people who are prepared to teach we heard from some of them who've been

07:18:42.220 --> 07:18:47.420
part of this conversation but also that you have facility needs that could take some you know some

07:18:47.420 --> 07:18:56.300
happy year to manage what would be the ideal time of starting would it be 2021 would it be

07:18:56.300 --> 07:19:04.780
january of 2021 september of 2021 or how do you think about the assets and difficulties

07:19:06.140 --> 07:19:12.060
that you have in relation to the timeline thank you very much and we appreciate that opportunity

07:19:12.060 --> 07:19:17.100
and that's one of the reasons why my very first statement after introducing myself and thanking

07:19:17.100 --> 07:19:22.780
you and cde staff is that we are open and we are willing and we sent a letter as early as in march

07:19:22.780 --> 07:19:28.460
2020 recognizing the impact of covet 19 not knowing what would happen even before all the

07:19:28.460 --> 07:19:33.900
budget changes and and the delays that we had both at the district level as well as at cde level

07:19:33.900 --> 07:19:42.700
while we understand the delays also impacted our ability to move forward with their plan and and

07:19:42.700 --> 07:19:49.020
with the facility and everything else so we do implore you that if you if you so wish we are

07:19:49.020 --> 07:19:55.260
willing to move our start to the following school year because we're on a traditional calendar so

07:19:55.260 --> 07:20:02.380
it's really best to to work that way and so we're willing to have that done even though our parents

07:20:02.380 --> 07:20:07.740
whose children may not will be aged out again but they will be so happy they'll be three they'll be

07:20:07.740 --> 07:20:11.420
dancing you don't even know they'll be calling you and just saying thank you that you gave

07:20:11.420 --> 07:20:18.380
their other children an opportunity to participate in this program i will be dancing too

07:20:20.300 --> 07:20:28.860
um member navo i think i saw your hand go up yes it did thank you um dr johnson i i am uh

07:20:30.220 --> 07:20:36.220
really impressed with your persistence and your uh enthusiasm on this issue and i'm quickly

07:20:36.220 --> 07:20:42.460
becoming a fan of yours i think that you're doing some um obviously this is not a trial on

07:20:42.460 --> 07:20:48.300
your character much more about the the substance of the petition and i just want you to know that i

07:20:48.300 --> 07:20:54.540
greatly respect the work that you're doing and how persistent you can um that being said i do have

07:20:54.540 --> 07:21:02.060
i did watch the uh your um the accs i did watch last year's uh board meeting again

07:21:02.060 --> 07:21:08.460
to get a feel as to where you were and i remember there were um and two several issues came up at

07:21:08.460 --> 07:21:15.820
the accs that concerned me one is the budget um and the reality that what cd shows and the

07:21:15.820 --> 07:21:21.340
inability to implement a fisc uh implement the program is also complicated by the reality that

07:21:21.340 --> 07:21:29.260
we're facing a potential 11 billion dollars in deferrals because of covet um the other issue is

07:21:29.260 --> 07:21:34.700
the facilities and i think it's the the the conflict between what the county has found

07:21:34.700 --> 07:21:41.420
and their foundation and also what your eca architect the gentleman who spoke and what he

07:21:41.420 --> 07:21:47.500
says is viable there's there's there's clarity issues there and i remember i watched in the last

07:21:47.500 --> 07:21:52.140
year's um miss board member ruckers pressed you quite a bit on the facility and the e-permit and

07:21:52.140 --> 07:21:56.220
the cap doesn't have a cafeteria doesn't have a library doesn't have a playground those things

07:21:56.220 --> 07:22:01.980
and i don't necessarily know that those were resolved um between now and then i think there

07:22:01.980 --> 07:22:08.540
those are probably still issues so my question to you is um with regards to the petition and

07:22:08.540 --> 07:22:14.140
the staffing and the educational program tell me a little bit about i think the two issues

07:22:14.140 --> 07:22:20.220
are going to be the budget and the facility so tell me a little bit about the the difference

07:22:20.220 --> 07:22:27.740
that you see in relationship to your budget as opposed to what cde has presented on slide 12

07:22:29.500 --> 07:22:36.460
thank you very much for that question and i will start it and then i'm going to hand it over

07:22:36.460 --> 07:22:43.340
to our fiscal consultant because we submitted in a petition budget that was submitted

07:22:44.300 --> 07:22:51.900
was very viable and met net assets for the five years however because of the way that cde

07:22:51.900 --> 07:22:59.180
calculated the money about the hundred hundred thousand dollars that was supposed to be used to

07:22:59.180 --> 07:23:05.660
do the 10 improvement it made it look like our first year wasn't viable but it is and i will let

07:23:06.460 --> 07:23:13.340
our fiscal consultant miss lee taylor go into more details for you so that she will explain

07:23:13.340 --> 07:23:21.260
everything and we also um did a may revise and submitted it at the cde's request on june 19

07:23:21.260 --> 07:23:29.500
which they said that they will present to you but and that may revise was also budgeted

07:23:29.500 --> 07:23:36.620
and it made all the net assets starting from year two and so i like i said i'll just let miss

07:23:38.220 --> 07:23:44.460
taylor tell you a little bit more in details miss taylor thank you yeah and if you if

07:23:45.100 --> 07:23:48.460
if you answer that i'd like to give cd an opportunity to respond to so

07:23:48.460 --> 07:23:55.340
just absolutely absolutely thank you so much miss taylor hello board members can you hear me

07:23:56.220 --> 07:24:02.620
yes are you okay my name is lee taylor and i would like to say thank you for the time

07:24:02.620 --> 07:24:09.180
and thank you for the question um i've been working in charter finance uh for

07:24:09.900 --> 07:24:13.900
over eight years and i've worked with several different charter schools

07:24:14.540 --> 07:24:21.820
as a back office provider who've been authorized by the cde and i know your staff um at least

07:24:21.820 --> 07:24:29.100
via email and our various correspondents and i have to say i'm shocked and concerned about

07:24:29.100 --> 07:24:36.300
the inconsistencies and inaccuracies of the financial information and analyses that you've

07:24:36.300 --> 07:24:44.380
been presented with over and over again we have repeatedly attempted to correct their erroneous

07:24:44.380 --> 07:24:52.300
errors and the skewed presentation of the financial situation i will tell you that i am also

07:24:54.380 --> 07:25:02.060
prior to a dramatic industry change i spent 20 years in financial accounting coming from a big

07:25:02.060 --> 07:25:11.180
five cpa and um and so i'm very shocked and it took so the first thing i want to point out is

07:25:11.180 --> 07:25:17.420
that there is an error in what you were presented we never gave them anything that said that year

07:25:17.420 --> 07:25:25.100
one ended in negative sixty thousand dollars of net in in income what has happened is that

07:25:25.820 --> 07:25:31.980
and and this honestly i want to acknowledge your the financial staff at the csd because

07:25:32.860 --> 07:25:36.380
this is not consistent with what i've learned over my years of working with them

07:25:37.100 --> 07:25:42.460
there is a misunderstanding of the difference between governmental and not-for-profit accounting

07:25:43.340 --> 07:25:53.180
so they added expenses that do not belong and negatively skewed the numbers it took multiple

07:25:53.180 --> 07:25:58.860
requests and multiple months to get a schedule to find out where they came up with all of these

07:25:58.860 --> 07:26:06.380
negative adjustments we gave them a response detailing that out of all of the negative all

07:26:06.380 --> 07:26:14.380
of the adjustments that only fifteen thousand dollars of um after the may revise revenue

07:26:14.380 --> 07:26:21.500
reductions of a hundred and sixty five thousand dollars in revenue or in net income adjustments

07:26:21.500 --> 07:26:28.060
were actually valid and we incorporated those into the budget but interestingly when they

07:26:28.060 --> 07:26:35.180
were making all of these negative adjustments to the bottom line they failed to include anything

07:26:35.740 --> 07:26:43.660
that would show a positive on the side of the school including the reduction in stirs costs

07:26:44.460 --> 07:26:49.500
so the fifteen thousand dollars that we said yeah you know what you're right that is a valid item

07:26:49.500 --> 07:26:55.500
and we should pick that up but oh it's more than offset by the fact that you didn't include a

07:26:55.500 --> 07:27:02.380
credit for the reduction in employer stirs contributions that are also in the may revise budget

07:27:03.740 --> 07:27:09.260
after and i will i understand everybody in finance and education with covid has been

07:27:09.260 --> 07:27:17.260
scrambling to understand but every time there was a proposal or a suggestion or a conversation at

07:27:17.260 --> 07:27:24.540
the state senate or legislature or the governor we were asked to do another revision over well what

07:27:24.540 --> 07:27:31.100
if this happened and these are very complicated issues i'd be up at night because there was no

07:27:31.100 --> 07:27:37.580
other discussion i'd be up at night reading the the actual laws trying to interpret them as opposed

07:27:37.580 --> 07:27:43.980
to having other people because i had to implement them into a forecast of what might happen in two

07:27:43.980 --> 07:27:51.260
weeks so we've done multiple re-forecasts multiple corrections and then it turns out that the revenues

07:27:51.260 --> 07:27:57.180
are fine now so there's that issue i would like to state that very clearly

07:27:59.340 --> 07:28:07.100
as far as deferrals and cash flows are concerned you are also being given some very significant

07:28:07.100 --> 07:28:12.860
misleading information that i'd like to explain when it comes to accounts receivable sales this

07:28:12.860 --> 07:28:21.900
is an incredibly complicated financing tool simply because of the way state funding flows

07:28:21.900 --> 07:28:27.820
and the way that the borrowing has to be done it's not like going and getting a mortgage on your home

07:28:27.820 --> 07:28:34.860
where you borrow half a million dollars and you pay it back over a term this is more like using

07:28:34.860 --> 07:28:41.500
your credit card every month and when the bill comes you pay it off and then you you get to use

07:28:41.500 --> 07:28:47.580
your credit card up to your available credit and then the bill comes and you pay it off so when the

07:28:47.580 --> 07:28:54.940
cde and it this is a consistent issue that i have they tell you that the school will be borrowing

07:28:54.940 --> 07:29:05.980
1.4 or 1.5 million dollars that's not exactly true they're borrowing the same money over and over

07:29:06.540 --> 07:29:14.620
again so i have an apportionment that's been deferred three months so i will go to the

07:29:14.620 --> 07:29:21.820
receivable sales and i'll say i need the cash now to make payroll to pay my rent because i can't

07:29:21.820 --> 07:29:28.140
send vendors and iou that's not an option for not-for-profit entities do you mind if i do you

07:29:28.140 --> 07:29:34.780
mind if i interrupt because i appreciate your um your explanation but i think i don't necessarily

07:29:34.780 --> 07:29:41.500
know that i'm getting the gist of it yeah yeah so can i let me shift yeah narrow me down and i will

07:29:41.500 --> 07:29:46.860
well let me shift it to cde i just if cd can stephanie is i don't know who's going to answer

07:29:46.860 --> 07:29:53.500
this question but i'm just curious about the financials if cd can answer this is stephanie

07:29:54.300 --> 07:30:03.900
i'm here so a couple of things um number one yes we could not um predict or what the state

07:30:03.900 --> 07:30:11.020
legislature was going to do in terms of the budget so we did ask all the schools on appeal to us

07:30:11.580 --> 07:30:18.380
to submit a budget based on the may revise which we now know is not what ended up in the final

07:30:18.380 --> 07:30:25.020
budget numbers that's the only time we've asked the school to submit a new budget which we ended

07:30:25.020 --> 07:30:29.900
up not using as as you know because the may revise didn't look like the final budget

07:30:30.140 --> 07:30:37.500
um that the governor signed so that number one that's that's what that is and and and and it

07:30:37.500 --> 07:30:47.020
is complicated and i have um secondly uh what was on slide 12 is the cde's analysis of the budget

07:30:47.020 --> 07:30:52.300
that the petitioner sends in so we don't just take their budget and put it on the slide and say this

07:30:52.300 --> 07:31:00.300
is it we do our own analysis i have um uh we do have a budget analysis person in the charter

07:31:00.300 --> 07:31:06.860
schools division that is uh very strong and has done these analyses for several years

07:31:07.820 --> 07:31:12.780
and i trust her work on it and so the budget analysis that we have there is is what we

07:31:13.980 --> 07:31:17.420
analyze based on the original budget they turned in with their petition

07:31:17.900 --> 07:31:25.580
um in february i think so that was their analysis based on the original budget any new budgets that

07:31:25.580 --> 07:31:33.420
they have submitted since uh the accs meeting which i think they did possibly last week to

07:31:33.420 --> 07:31:39.660
the state board as a whole we have not had the opportunity to review that yet i do think also

07:31:39.660 --> 07:31:47.100
that i need to add in um because i i haven't had a chance to um speak um is that all this new

07:31:47.100 --> 07:31:54.780
information that's coming out in terms of uh plans that the architect has um for instance or

07:31:57.820 --> 07:32:05.180
the details of the ib program that's all new to us and so all of that is nothing that was heard

07:32:05.180 --> 07:32:08.940
at the local level the district didn't get to hear the plans that the architect had

07:32:09.900 --> 07:32:14.780
they didn't get to hear all the details about the ib program neither did the accs quite frankly

07:32:14.780 --> 07:32:21.260
because this isn't something that was um was brought up then so there is a lot of new information

07:32:21.260 --> 07:32:28.060
that is coming out today that we have not had the opportunity to analyze or verify or evaluate for

07:32:28.060 --> 07:32:34.300
quality um including the budget support um since like i said we have not had the opportunity to

07:32:34.300 --> 07:32:42.140
review the newest budget that they turned in but i do want to uh just in uh reiterate that

07:32:42.140 --> 07:32:46.860
we had only asked them for one budget and that was me revise and that was taken out of this final

07:32:46.860 --> 07:32:54.140
state board item because of the new budget that was signed i appreciate that stephanie and i

07:32:54.140 --> 07:32:58.300
watched the accs and some of this information i'm aware of visiting so i appreciate your

07:32:59.100 --> 07:33:04.860
answer so um board president i'll open i'll leave it for other board members to ask questions i have

07:33:04.860 --> 07:33:12.620
more about facilities but i think like yeah this is why we do a de novo hearing right because

07:33:12.620 --> 07:33:21.260
information changes uh new um new pieces of information come up over this course of time

07:33:21.980 --> 07:33:27.900
so uh one of the things i'm curious about now is how do we get a chance to take a look at or

07:33:27.900 --> 07:33:35.820
hear succinctly about the most recent budget of the school because we're dealing with old information

07:33:36.860 --> 07:33:43.740
and old analyses at this point that are not relevant now and i don't know if there's a way that

07:33:45.100 --> 07:33:53.100
the petitioner can succinctly state what that is or whether there's a way that we can

07:33:53.900 --> 07:33:57.980
see that um i don't you know there's a lot of documents here so i did not see

07:33:57.980 --> 07:34:00.940
it in any of the documents but i might have missed something

07:34:04.860 --> 07:34:13.260
thank you again president our slide does have our current budget that's the only one we placed in

07:34:13.260 --> 07:34:21.260
and then uh appendice e also in the packet that we submitted is our current budget and i will try to

07:34:21.260 --> 07:34:30.540
be succinct because i don't have all the information that um lee has but if i could share my screen for

07:34:31.180 --> 07:34:37.900
slide number nine then you'll be able to see hopefully succinctly what our current budget

07:34:37.900 --> 07:34:41.420
looks like if that's okay yeah go ahead thank you

07:34:41.420 --> 07:34:41.580
you

07:34:50.140 --> 07:34:53.580
and now if you could make it bigger yes i'm gonna do that

07:35:06.380 --> 07:35:11.260
is that big enough yeah can you see okay awesome thank you so much

07:35:11.740 --> 07:35:18.220
so when you take a look at this budget here i know he's on on the other side you would see that

07:35:18.220 --> 07:35:23.820
fiscal year 1920 is always a negative because it's a start year and that's where we borrow the money

07:35:23.820 --> 07:35:30.540
because we don't have the money yet but when you go to oh my god sorry about that

07:35:36.780 --> 07:35:38.380
okay i'll stop touching this

07:35:41.660 --> 07:35:47.900
okay so when you go to year one fiscal year one um miss delah tells me that i like to see my

07:35:47.900 --> 07:35:52.780
percentages and i do because it gives me not having all the finance background you know the

07:35:52.780 --> 07:35:59.420
snippet of what is going on in my budget and so when you take a look at the ending net assets

07:35:59.420 --> 07:36:09.820
for fiscal year 21 you would see that we have 120 to 91 thousand dollars as net assets which is

07:36:09.820 --> 07:36:18.860
about 7.68 percent which is higher than the five percent that cde requires and when you go to

07:36:18.860 --> 07:36:27.020
fiscal year 21 22 and you take a look at everything else and it goes all the way down to net assets

07:36:27.020 --> 07:36:37.260
again you would see that it's 23.59 percent again showing that we have reserves that we can use in

07:36:37.260 --> 07:36:42.220
uncertainties and then when you go to the last year which is the third year that cde actually

07:36:42.220 --> 07:36:50.620
looks at you will find that we have 33 net assets and so that's like a short description of that

07:36:50.620 --> 07:36:59.260
but how did we get there so what we did was we used the since there is no current lcff calculator

07:36:59.260 --> 07:37:06.460
currently right now so what we did was use the may one to use the current budget that has been

07:37:06.460 --> 07:37:13.820
approved by the governor to come up with these figures with zero color and cuts and we also

07:37:13.820 --> 07:37:21.340
maintain to make sure that we take care of any unanticipated covet 19 impact that will show up

07:37:21.340 --> 07:37:29.420
we don't know we decided to maintain the cuts that we created in the may revised budget and those

07:37:29.500 --> 07:37:36.460
cuts were the ceo salary classified fte and overhead cuts so that we would make sure that

07:37:36.460 --> 07:37:43.740
none of our programs are impacted by anything and if nothing happens then we may restore those things

07:37:43.740 --> 07:37:49.500
and then in terms of cash flow like we also talked about for deferrals we are going to increase

07:37:49.500 --> 07:37:57.020
receivables a ourselves and interest expense and so that's how we were able to create those balanced

07:37:57.020 --> 07:38:08.060
budget using the current budget and the may lcff calculator so you used a conservative estimate of

07:38:08.620 --> 07:38:16.780
state funding absolutely yes all right i want to get this to other board members member angeline

07:38:18.700 --> 07:38:26.860
thank you i i just want to echo some of the concerns of board member nabo about the facilities i

07:38:26.860 --> 07:38:30.780
would like to learn a little bit more just because i believe it's one thing to say

07:38:32.780 --> 07:38:37.340
the facility is fit but i'm not quite understanding the changes that were made

07:38:37.340 --> 07:38:44.140
just also not being here a year ago what were the issues before and how are they being addressed now

07:38:45.180 --> 07:38:48.780
i don't think that was clearly stated so i just appreciate if someone could explain that

07:38:48.780 --> 07:38:58.780
okay um i'm getting back on the zoom um at this point in time i would yield to our

07:39:00.140 --> 07:39:09.580
architects if he could share the created site plan on his screen so that you can see visually

07:39:09.580 --> 07:39:16.700
what we're trying to say to you so mr kite are you able to pull up that site plan please

07:39:17.580 --> 07:39:20.380
mr kite you're muted you need to unmute please

07:39:23.260 --> 07:39:27.740
i'm sorry thank you if you can allow me to share the screen i'll do my best

07:39:31.900 --> 07:39:38.940
um stop the other sharing screens uh may i do that yes you may okay

07:39:38.940 --> 07:39:44.460
um so one of the key uh elements of this building it's it's actually in two pieces

07:39:45.900 --> 07:39:52.140
uh both of them were built in the in the 50s back in the 50s uh buildings were built uh very well

07:39:52.140 --> 07:39:58.220
to our knowledge there are no foundation problems other than at that at we did determine that uh

07:39:58.220 --> 07:40:04.220
somewhere along the line i believe that the building was built in the 50s and the building

07:40:04.460 --> 07:40:10.300
at that at we did determine that uh somewhere along the line i believe when it was the church

07:40:10.300 --> 07:40:15.820
there were some unpermitted structures built that are the by the definition of the code if

07:40:15.820 --> 07:40:21.660
they're not permitted they're not actually there so um we have recommended that they be removed

07:40:21.660 --> 07:40:25.340
because to our knowledge the way they're constructed they're they're not permitted so

07:40:25.340 --> 07:40:32.780
they're they're small little adjunct buildings to to address that point um we went through a very

07:40:32.780 --> 07:40:38.780
uh comprehensive analysis of the the buildings and the site according to the construction

07:40:38.780 --> 07:40:44.620
specification institute there are 16 categories of different types of of construction we've done

07:40:44.620 --> 07:40:53.500
a complete analysis of that and provided that to dr johnson for disposition between what would be

07:40:53.500 --> 07:40:57.660
shell and core improvements and what would be school tenant improvements essentially on the

07:40:57.660 --> 07:41:03.180
inside of the building and so there's a very strong line of demarcation between those two costs

07:41:03.980 --> 07:41:14.140
but um in our professional opinion um there the the um infrastructure related costs to the shell

07:41:14.140 --> 07:41:18.380
and core of the building such as the replacement of the windows so the building will have to be

07:41:18.380 --> 07:41:23.820
brought up to title 24 which is the california energy standard so that standard will require

07:41:23.820 --> 07:41:29.420
replacement of the windows uh that's an item that is accounted for to the landlord because

07:41:29.420 --> 07:41:35.340
the landlord will own the windows for for the life of the building and that's just a basic part of

07:41:35.340 --> 07:41:42.780
the and i think that was noted in the initial um county assessment that the windows are not to code

07:41:42.780 --> 07:41:49.980
and that and that's certainly true so there's no element of the building that we think is

07:41:50.620 --> 07:41:56.380
insurmountable with respect to foundations or the nature of the the framing of the building it's very

07:41:56.380 --> 07:42:03.020
very stout building and as well as the fact that it was originally uh built as a restaurant so

07:42:03.020 --> 07:42:08.460
there's a there's a lot of electrical mechanical infrastructure there is roof repair uh there has

07:42:08.460 --> 07:42:14.860
been some evidence of leakage but it's it's in the repair uh it's not a it's not a comprehensive uh

07:42:14.940 --> 07:42:20.460
take the building apart and put it back together again it's really uh very normal we've um

07:42:21.180 --> 07:42:27.980
executed many projects very similar to this uh and didn't find anything that if we had found

07:42:27.980 --> 07:42:31.820
anything that we thought was insurmountable we wouldn't even take the assignment

07:42:34.460 --> 07:42:40.700
okay i want to um recognize a member mcquillin who's got his hand up unless

07:42:40.700 --> 07:42:43.500
brenta you had any further questions on this

07:42:47.340 --> 07:42:48.460
brenta are you on mute

07:42:50.380 --> 07:42:57.420
and not right now okay member mcquillin we can take the slide down thank you

07:42:58.620 --> 07:43:05.500
thank you and thank you all for the presentation very good uh mine my question is more on facilities

07:43:05.500 --> 07:43:12.700
also and we heard from the county perspective that those cars are whizzing by there at 55 miles an

07:43:12.700 --> 07:43:23.580
hour and then i heard the the architects say that there's room for striping is there other plans to

07:43:23.580 --> 07:43:30.860
have a turning lane or is there a verified space for turning or safe access for all those cars to

07:43:30.860 --> 07:43:35.820
get in and out of there is my my concern thank you

07:43:39.740 --> 07:43:46.460
happy to answer that go ahead the uh as it exists today there are two points of entry

07:43:47.020 --> 07:43:53.740
and our initial recommendation based upon our our traffic study uh through our our civil engineer

07:43:54.380 --> 07:44:00.460
recommended a single point of entry that point of entry uh is actually in a portion that's

07:44:00.460 --> 07:44:05.020
widened already so that will allow for deceleration for eastbound traffic

07:44:06.380 --> 07:44:13.660
and and and plenty of stacking space of course the leftbound traffic is the is the one that is

07:44:14.380 --> 07:44:21.500
the the worst case and would require the most amount of um uh if anything needs to occur

07:44:21.500 --> 07:44:27.340
that the main thing about uh this site and this at a single point of access is that there are

07:44:27.340 --> 07:44:35.500
complete sight lines for roughly a half a mile in either direction of aguadulce and that

07:44:37.180 --> 07:44:47.820
is a subject that would be debated but but um we believe that normal traffic mitigation to allow

07:44:47.820 --> 07:44:56.540
for a a left turn onto sierra highway can be accomplished it's as a school zone there would

07:44:56.540 --> 07:45:00.860
be there would be certain striping that would occur as a result of just the fact that it would

07:45:00.860 --> 07:45:08.540
become a school so all those things are in our uh initial investigation that we've done thus far

07:45:09.180 --> 07:45:14.620
quite mitigatable and that's a subject that we would concern ourselves with a great deal of

07:45:14.620 --> 07:45:16.300
course as well as our civil engineer

07:45:19.020 --> 07:45:24.620
uh i am looking to see if there are any other board members who want to be recognized uh

07:45:26.060 --> 07:45:31.820
and i don't see any other raised hands do we have a motion

07:45:34.060 --> 07:45:41.420
ting do you want to make the motion yeah i would like to um you know to address some of the

07:45:41.420 --> 07:45:48.140
concerns from the the board members and uh you know it's very difficult for a school to start

07:45:48.140 --> 07:45:56.700
this year moving into a very uncertain 2021 school year and uh you know i do believe that

07:45:56.700 --> 07:46:03.900
the petitioners have the background the enthusiasm and the support to successfully implement the

07:46:03.900 --> 07:46:10.140
educational program and we do have a couple of just the facilities and some of those and just

07:46:10.140 --> 07:46:16.860
going into next year so i would like to offer and the petitioners have um stated that they would be

07:46:16.860 --> 07:46:25.020
willing to open and enroll in the following school year so uh i i would like to make a

07:46:25.020 --> 07:46:33.740
recommendation that we approve this charter uh but with some conditions and i i can share those

07:46:33.740 --> 07:46:41.740
conditions or i can i can talk through them uh if you have the floor why don't you do that now

07:46:41.740 --> 07:46:48.140
okay so i uh i have something written would you rather see it and then

07:46:49.020 --> 07:46:55.500
or should i maybe talk about share your screen yeah i can i'm able to do that let's see

07:46:56.620 --> 07:47:00.460
and if not you can talk us through it okay i can share screen okay

07:47:03.980 --> 07:47:08.460
all right i think it's easier to see it are you guys able to see that

07:47:08.460 --> 07:47:15.340
yes you did you did it well okay great can you make it larger i hate to ask that question

07:47:15.340 --> 07:47:24.380
i could just take my glasses off

07:47:26.620 --> 07:47:31.900
is that okay yeah thank you all right so so what i would like to um

07:47:32.540 --> 07:47:38.860
so i'd like to recommend that we approve the eagle collegiate academy charter it would have

07:47:38.860 --> 07:47:46.780
to be a term for five years so it'd be from july 1st 2020 to june 30th 2025 but the school will

07:47:46.780 --> 07:47:53.820
begin instruction between july 1st 2021 and september 30th 2021 so that would give them a

07:47:53.820 --> 07:48:01.420
fall opening in 2021 and this would be with the caveat that you have four years

07:48:02.140 --> 07:48:07.500
actually three years before renewal so that's going to be a quick uh quick uh turnaround for

07:48:07.500 --> 07:48:14.460
the school the school will produce evidence of may 28th of a prospective enrollment of 168 students

07:48:14.460 --> 07:48:20.380
because there was some worry there and i want to make sure that they are able to maintain the

07:48:20.380 --> 07:48:25.980
numbers of students for their opening the school will submit a plan to the department of education

07:48:25.980 --> 07:48:30.300
by october 1st that describes how eagle collegiate will implement the ib program

07:48:31.500 --> 07:48:37.500
and then provide an update annually that describes the prior implementation outcome so that we are

07:48:37.500 --> 07:48:44.780
ensuring that there is that consistency and the implementation moving forward that all the

07:48:44.860 --> 07:48:50.300
facilities improvements including improvements to roadway access and occupate occupancy permits

07:48:50.300 --> 07:48:57.260
that have been expressed the concerns have been expressed that are that those are required beginning

07:48:57.260 --> 07:49:03.020
to begin the school operations in 2021 and it needs to be completed and ready and submitted to

07:49:03.020 --> 07:49:10.540
cde by may 21st 2021 and the school will submit to the department of education a revised budget

07:49:11.340 --> 07:49:14.940
with real numbers knowing where we're going to be going next year

07:49:16.460 --> 07:49:21.820
and any changes to the charge portion that into the petition that addresses the deficiencies

07:49:21.820 --> 07:49:26.620
including language that's outlined by the cde staff analysis

07:49:26.620 --> 07:49:32.700
is

07:49:35.340 --> 07:49:40.700
those are a lot of conditions i'm just trying to process them yes i understand that

07:49:48.780 --> 07:49:52.060
it seems to me that on the second one

07:49:53.020 --> 07:50:02.300
um they may or may not have precisely 168 students they might have you know 160 170 175

07:50:02.300 --> 07:50:07.420
but the real goal of that should be to produce evidence that there is perspective enrollment of

07:50:07.420 --> 07:50:16.300
a sufficient number of students to support the financial viability of the school i don't know

07:50:16.300 --> 07:50:23.740
that it needs to be precisely 168 no more and no fewer would you take that as a friendly amendment

07:50:24.780 --> 07:50:32.220
that would be with me it is i want to make sure because they the petitioners did propose 168

07:50:32.220 --> 07:50:42.060
students to start with and i don't know staff wants to chime in on that but i i believe that

07:50:42.060 --> 07:50:49.980
when we have a certain number there is a there's some flexibility in i mean usually it's you know

07:50:49.980 --> 07:50:54.460
some minimum number that you need to make the budget viable but i don't know that we would say

07:50:54.460 --> 07:51:00.940
you can't have more or if you have two fewer you know if you have 166 but your budget works

07:51:02.460 --> 07:51:05.900
most charters you are are ballparking in that regard

07:51:05.900 --> 07:51:17.180
so should we say at least 168 students yes this is judy sias generally we allow um in the mou

07:51:17.900 --> 07:51:21.740
i'll have to double check i don't have a copy of it in front of me but in the past we've allowed

07:51:21.740 --> 07:51:28.780
up or down by 20 to 25 percent um in order to to not be considered a material revision so that's

07:51:28.780 --> 07:51:35.180
sort of what we've looked at in the past okay so should you think that needs to judy do you

07:51:35.180 --> 07:51:41.580
think that needs to be in the conditions stated or do you think that we can rely on the

07:51:43.820 --> 07:51:51.820
legislative precedent um sure we can add something as 168 students you know plus or

07:51:51.820 --> 07:51:57.660
minus 25 if that's your preference yeah whatever the whatever the convention is that would make

07:51:57.660 --> 07:52:05.820
sense okay um all right are there any of so we need a second on this motion then

07:52:08.700 --> 07:52:12.460
is there a second second i'll second who was that

07:52:14.060 --> 07:52:21.900
glover woods thank you so many so many boxes up on my screen okay we have a second

07:52:21.900 --> 07:52:29.580
is there further discussion linda matt has his hand up okay uh member navo yeah i hate to be a

07:52:29.580 --> 07:52:34.620
bearer of bad news here i'm i'm a little uncomfortable with it um but i have a question

07:52:36.620 --> 07:52:43.500
to staff or board member ting on how you see this is my understand am i understanding this correctly

07:52:43.500 --> 07:52:51.580
that if we approve this if one of any of those five is not completed then they will not open

07:52:51.900 --> 07:52:59.260
the petitioner's budget is that how is that how we're because what what what concerns me most is

07:52:59.260 --> 07:53:05.180
that although i appreciate the petitioner's budget having not had the cd staff have an

07:53:05.180 --> 07:53:11.020
opportunity to review that really makes me uncomfortable about saying okay we're going

07:53:11.020 --> 07:53:15.580
to take their budget and their information and we're going to grant them an approval so what i'm

07:53:15.660 --> 07:53:22.620
concerned about is number five if cd doesn't come in uh doesn't agree with the petitioner's budgeting

07:53:25.100 --> 07:53:31.180
we're going to be in this in this dilemma and cd needs to make a call and so i'm wondering if

07:53:31.180 --> 07:53:35.820
we get to number five and they don't agree with the budget the petitioner's budget templates

07:53:35.820 --> 07:53:42.940
or the budget plan then i'm assuming it doesn't open um this is judy size again i i think

07:53:42.940 --> 07:53:48.300
conditional approval is always legally challenging and the reality is by the time the school opens

07:53:48.300 --> 07:53:52.780
next may there will be another budget right because we will have another state budget at the time

07:53:53.500 --> 07:54:00.140
so if it gets to that point we will um possibly have to come back to you all um if it gets to

07:54:00.140 --> 07:54:05.500
where things do not look viable for the school um and we are unable to reach agreement with the

07:54:05.500 --> 07:54:12.380
school um the budget situation is obviously very unclear right now for all school districts and

07:54:12.380 --> 07:54:20.220
charter schools okay well that that helps so judy if i understand you because they had a seven one

07:54:20.220 --> 07:54:28.700
vote uh for not opening on accs so by us approving this on conditions if one of those five doesn't

07:54:28.700 --> 07:54:37.100
come to fruition they'll come back to us you're asking the question matt whether it will come

07:54:37.100 --> 07:54:45.020
back to us correct one of these five is a question of any kind right i i think what

07:54:45.020 --> 07:54:49.580
i have to meet all five conditions they have to meet this this is judy that they'd have to meet

07:54:49.580 --> 07:54:53.340
those five conditions and if there's a disagreement with the school whether or not those five conditions

07:54:53.340 --> 07:54:58.460
have been satisfied and then it's a choice of whether or not they will open or not then they

07:54:58.460 --> 07:55:05.900
will have to come back to you okay the issue with the budget which i don't believe is the is the

07:55:05.900 --> 07:55:13.500
fault of petitioner is they submitted an original budget there was some disagreement with cde on how

07:55:13.500 --> 07:55:20.700
that budget was uh and analyzed it sounds like there was not the communication or agreement but

07:55:20.700 --> 07:55:29.340
before then then cde did an analysis based on the may revise of their budget using the may revise

07:55:29.340 --> 07:55:35.420
they responded to that which caused more confusion and now we no longer have the may revise we have

07:55:35.900 --> 07:55:41.340
another set of numbers to go with so there has been quite a bit of back and forth and i don't

07:55:41.340 --> 07:55:48.620
feel that that is um the the fault of the the petitioner so i and they're not necessarily

07:55:48.620 --> 07:55:53.420
real numbers they don't have real numbers really to work with until we know better what the budget

07:55:53.420 --> 07:56:00.060
conditions are so this is this is judy again i i would add that um cde treats all budgets the same

07:56:00.940 --> 07:56:05.500
the way they analyze the budgets and the numbers they back out and how they analyze budgets

07:56:05.500 --> 07:56:11.020
they treat them all the same so i would disagree strongly with how um the budget analysis presented

07:56:11.020 --> 07:56:17.260
by some of the petitioner statements um that being said the it's true the budget situation

07:56:17.260 --> 07:56:22.140
is uncertain right now i i think that's an understatement and that's true for all districts

07:56:22.140 --> 07:56:27.660
and charter schools and you who knows if the state is going to have to reopen their budget

07:56:27.660 --> 07:56:32.540
in a few months we just don't know with covid the uncertainty is is clear

07:56:35.820 --> 07:56:42.540
so if there is a question mark or disagreement about the adequacy of the budget it will come back

07:56:42.540 --> 07:56:50.460
to us right is that what is that the main question i think what i would say is again if there is a

07:56:50.460 --> 07:56:55.340
question about whether or not these conditions have been satisfied and there's a back and forth

07:56:55.340 --> 07:56:59.660
with the school and it's unclear whether the conditions have been satisfied as such that they

07:56:59.660 --> 07:57:05.260
can open that then it will come back to you if that question is outstanding okay thank you

07:57:05.980 --> 07:57:13.420
um all right we have a motion we have a second are there any other board members with questions

07:57:13.420 --> 07:57:14.220

contract with i was involved in a litigation in the west end selpa which lasted seven years selpa

08:02:47.340 --> 08:02:53.180
litigated all the way to the nine circuit court of appeals to deny my child special education services

08:02:53.740 --> 08:02:59.900
they lost but the lawyers billed the district for every single minute throughout the seven years

08:03:00.540 --> 08:03:07.020
now amid the coronavirus outbreak another vendor the law firm of fagan friedman and full frost

sued our family for 12 000 dollars arguing they are due the money they needlessly spent on hiring

private investigators to conduct surveillance on our family's attorney and private tutor

and your affiliation your time starts now

08:03:53.900 --> 08:04:00.540
hi good afternoon can you hear me okay yes thank you okay thank you my name is marianne grozner

08:04:00.540 --> 08:04:06.300
i am the mother of two children with special needs my youngest son is very impacted by autism and is

08:04:06.300 --> 08:04:11.820
non-verbal he was in a public school system but we had to pull him out because our school district

08:04:11.820 --> 08:04:16.940
was getting ready to sue us for a third time and we honestly could not afford to keep paying

08:04:16.940 --> 08:04:22.140
attorneys to keep my son in the public school system something is seriously amiss with the

08:04:22.140 --> 08:04:28.060
public school system if you disagree with what the iep team offers you get sued and this is what

08:04:28.060 --> 08:04:33.100
happened to us the second time around the school district didn't have a placement for my son for

08:04:33.100 --> 08:04:38.460
the first three weeks after the school year started so we exercised our right to file due

08:04:38.460 --> 08:04:43.820
process but yet the school district sued us back saying our lawsuit was frivolous it doesn't seem

08:04:43.820 --> 08:04:49.900
right that the school district can use their own budget our taxpayer dollars to pay for-profit

08:04:49.900 --> 08:04:54.780
litigators to deny services to children with disabilities and i want you to know that parents

08:04:54.780 --> 08:05:00.300
don't have these kinds of resources and denying services impacts these vulnerable children the

08:05:00.540 --> 08:05:02.060
speaker your time is up

08:05:07.500 --> 08:05:10.860
