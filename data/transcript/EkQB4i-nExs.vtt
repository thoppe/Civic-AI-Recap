WEBVTT

00:10.220 --> 00:10.801
OK.

00:11.141 --> 00:22.953
All right.

00:23.093 --> 00:24.154
All right.

00:27.117 --> 00:28.998
I know we're going to have like so much.

00:30.140 --> 00:30.840
Good morning.

00:32.842 --> 00:33.483
Good morning.

00:34.272 --> 00:42.054
I am now calling to order the May 8th and 9th meeting of the State Board, and we will begin by saluting the flag.

00:42.134 --> 00:43.095
Would you all please rise?

00:43.115 --> 00:47.216
Ready?

00:47.576 --> 00:47.856
Begin.

00:48.836 --> 01:01.040
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:04.196 --> 01:08.561
OK, I want to begin with a very happy announcement.

01:09.202 --> 01:19.935
I am delighted to announce that our student board member, Hema Cardenas, has been accepted to attend, drum roll, Stanford University.

01:24.338 --> 01:28.541
And as a Stanford professor, I'm particularly thrilled about that.

01:28.621 --> 01:30.802
Please join me in congratulating Hema.

01:31.923 --> 01:32.343
We did.

01:34.345 --> 01:37.567
And Hema, would you like to say a few words?

01:40.104 --> 01:41.244
I'm just super excited.

01:41.304 --> 01:42.125
Thank you so much.

01:42.225 --> 01:46.345
I mean, Stanford, like it's in the Bay Area, never thought I would get accepted.

01:46.425 --> 01:50.826
So it was one of the biggest honors, especially being a first generation low income student.

01:51.287 --> 01:55.788
You know, it was a it's a great honor to be attending such an amazing school on a full ride.

01:55.908 --> 01:59.848
And so I'm just super excited because something I want to study is political science.

01:59.868 --> 02:01.169
I want to be a civil rights lawyer.

02:01.749 --> 02:06.330
And so I'm just ready to go into those steps and get involved in that school community.

02:06.530 --> 02:07.010
And yeah.

02:07.697 --> 02:08.277
Woo-hoo!

02:13.219 --> 02:21.182
Hema has been a terrific contributor to the board, so we'll miss your voice there, but we'll look forward to seeing where you go.

02:22.062 --> 02:24.203
We know you'll be an education civil rights lawyer.

02:26.684 --> 02:33.787
And then I would also like to very happily acknowledge all of the teachers in California for Teacher Appreciation Week.

02:37.304 --> 02:42.931
We have some of the most committed and dedicated and wonderful teachers in the universe.

02:44.052 --> 02:47.957
And we appreciate every single one of the people in our classrooms.

02:48.017 --> 02:48.358
Thank you.

02:50.419 --> 02:51.860
Onto more mundane tasks.

02:52.420 --> 02:59.445
We have changes in the agenda, which include item W15 was withdrawn by the California Department of Education on April 26, 2019.

03:01.106 --> 03:07.951
I want to be sure that everyone knows that Spanish interpreter services will be available today for item four.

03:08.492 --> 03:12.315
Headsets are available and can be found on the table just outside the boardroom.

03:12.795 --> 03:18.860
We've designed room 1103 for translation services during the proceeding of item four only.

03:19.700 --> 03:25.382
and that is the health education framework for California public schools where we're having our public hearing and adoption.

03:26.222 --> 03:29.083
There are three public hearing items on our agenda.

03:29.163 --> 03:30.263
One will be heard today.

03:30.503 --> 03:32.104
Two of them will be heard tomorrow.

03:32.704 --> 03:35.485
Item four, as I noted, is the health education framework.

03:36.205 --> 03:44.307
Item 15 and 16 are petitions for the establishment and, respectively, the renewal for two charter schools.

03:45.127 --> 03:45.908
The first of those,

03:47.668 --> 03:57.252
petition for establishing the Eagle Collegiate Academy and the second the renewal petition for the International Charter High School.

03:58.093 --> 04:10.898
There is a handout on the table in the lobby listing the proposed regular consent items which are items 5 through 14 and waiver items W01 through W11, W13 and W14.

04:11.999 --> 04:14.360
And then moving right along we're going to

04:15.009 --> 04:18.412
look at proposed waiver consent items.

04:19.833 --> 04:29.702
And I want to remind the board members that any members wishing to remove items from the proposed consent calendars should advise our executive director, Karen Staff-Walters, by 10 a.m.

04:29.782 --> 04:32.504
tomorrow, or today, not tomorrow.

04:32.945 --> 04:35.206
Right away, you should let Karen know.

04:35.667 --> 04:41.972
And we will take up waiver consent items later this afternoon, and then regular consent items will be covered tomorrow.

04:43.613 --> 04:51.697
Letters from the public on matters before the board were aggregated and are filed in an electronic folder sent to you by the board staff last week.

04:51.777 --> 04:53.457
I'm speaking to the board members now.

04:53.897 --> 05:08.083
We appreciate the public's continued cooperation in emailing all meeting related correspondence to the SBE office at sbe at cde.ca.gov by noon on the Friday immediately preceding the board meeting.

05:08.543 --> 05:12.285
The SBE meeting can be accessed via a fully electronic agenda

05:12.665 --> 05:16.849
There is one full print copy located in the lobby if you need to see it.

05:17.649 --> 05:20.632
Speakers should sign in at the table just outside the room.

05:21.253 --> 05:24.756
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each item number.

05:25.276 --> 05:33.503
Signing in on the page that identifies the item number on which you would like to speak will help ensure that we keep track of all the speakers for a particular item.

05:34.204 --> 05:43.192
Item 18 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comments on items that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

05:43.672 --> 05:46.454
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker.

05:47.035 --> 05:56.182
In order to ensure that everyone gets their one minute, there is a timer at the podium that will flash a red signal to each speaker when the one minute time limit has been reached.

05:56.583 --> 05:59.245
And we will give you a reminder as necessary.

05:59.805 --> 06:08.892
If anyone wishes to submit materials at the meeting, they should provide at least 25 copies to Amy Babico with the item number that it pertains to clearly indicated.

06:09.393 --> 06:12.896
Please do not get information directly to the board members.

06:13.856 --> 06:22.003
All speakers who may be members of the audience or the staff should introduce themselves and the organization they represent prior to speaking.

06:22.803 --> 06:28.107
Brevity is greatly appreciated and please do not repeat comments that were already made.

06:28.507 --> 06:34.811
You can state that you agree with the previous speaker or the comments made by so-and-so and that will be understood and noted.

06:35.692 --> 06:41.996
There is additional seating with TV monitors available in room 1103 right around the corner and down the hall on the left.

06:42.609 --> 06:47.711
and in room 1801 around the corner and to the right inside the personnel services office.

06:48.211 --> 06:58.936
Room 1103 is designated for Spanish translation services or alternatively members of the public needing translation services can access those services here in the boardroom.

07:00.216 --> 07:05.958
Board members, turn your microphones off on when you're speaking and off when you're not speaking.

07:06.358 --> 07:12.759
Please be sure to speak into the microphone so your comments can be properly recorded with the proceedings.

07:13.139 --> 07:19.421
And if you need to recuse yourself, please do so before any discussion on a given item begins.

07:21.449 --> 07:34.242
And we're going to move then on to item one, which is the, it's got a very long name, the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress System and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

07:34.262 --> 07:39.887
And I think we're going to begin with Michelle Center presenting for the CDE.

07:40.007 --> 07:40.688
Thank you, Michelle.

07:43.513 --> 07:49.639
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond, members of the board, and Chief Deputy Cortez-Akala.

07:49.659 --> 07:50.059
Good morning.

07:50.079 --> 07:54.023
I'm Michelle Senner, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division.

07:55.144 --> 08:00.729
First, I would like to start off by acknowledging and thanking my high school science teacher, Mrs. Bryant.

08:01.850 --> 08:05.351
Mrs. Bryant made sure that I found a pathway to college.

08:05.752 --> 08:12.374
I didn't come from a family where my parents were college educated, and I had a struggle in high school.

08:12.994 --> 08:16.676
My father was very ill, and she was there for me, and she found a path.

08:16.796 --> 08:17.916
And that's what our teachers do.

08:18.276 --> 08:21.817
They have these personal relationships with their students, and they make a difference every day.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.398
So thank you, Mrs. Bryant.

08:23.418 --> 08:27.299
We'll see if I can make her proud today when I present my items to you.

08:27.760 --> 08:28.400
No pressure.

08:30.310 --> 08:35.716
So the item that I'm going to present is both an information item as well as an action item before you today.

08:37.410 --> 08:38.571
And where's my arrows?

08:39.391 --> 08:44.735
I'm going to start by going over the recommendation that you have before you.

08:44.855 --> 08:52.119
Please note that there is a small change before that is between what's in the paper item and what I will present to you today.

08:52.760 --> 09:05.288
The department asked the board to approve the test design recommendations within the proposed high-level test design for the transition of the initial and summative English language proficiency assessments for California LPAC.

09:06.208 --> 09:17.915
to computer-based test that is described in sections 1G of attachment 2 with the revision of extending one-on-one administration from K-1 to kindergarten to grade 2.

09:20.160 --> 09:38.394
Additionally, the department asks that you approve the test design recommendations and general performance level descriptors within the proposed high-level test design within section 1F and 2D of attachment 3 for the development of the computer-based summative and initial alternate LPAC.

09:39.255 --> 09:46.679
Finally, we ask that you approve the proposed revisions to the summative LPAC blueprints as described in attachment four.

09:47.620 --> 09:57.385
The department also asked the board to authorize CDE staff to make technical edits as necessary to the documents that you are approving today.

09:59.146 --> 10:08.631
This item will also provide an update to the CASP or the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, as well as our LPAC programs.

10:10.831 --> 10:24.197
But before we dive into the action and the recommendation that I just mentioned, I'd like to take a moment to welcome our new board members and provide you a brief overview of the work and the assessments that we're responsible for in my division.

10:25.057 --> 10:31.280
And I will at the end also go over the action and provide you more details.

10:31.900 --> 10:39.203
And when I return to that topic, I will also ask my invited guest, Dr. Martha Thurlow, who's behind me to join me.

10:47.870 --> 10:58.139
So the assessment development and administration division, I just like to call it the assessment division because that's really long, provides administration for quite a few assessments in California.

10:58.879 --> 11:07.286
In every aspect of the work that we do, we're focused on delivering meaningful measures that serve to promote high quality teaching and learning in our state.

11:07.947 --> 11:11.030
At the forefront of that is our CASP system.

11:13.930 --> 11:17.913
The CAASPP system is composed of seven different assessments.

11:18.453 --> 11:32.363
The Smarter Balanced Assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics, the California Science Test, the California Alternate Assessment in ELA Math and Science, as well as our California Spanish Assessment.

11:35.390 --> 11:38.592
The implementation of the CASP was significant in our state.

11:39.092 --> 11:44.775
It shifted the primary focus away from accountability and toward promoting high quality teaching and learning.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.156
The goal is documented on this slide.

11:47.856 --> 11:51.818
This is wording taken directly from our education code here in California.

11:52.759 --> 12:01.003
As you will see, I hope, in my presentation, our division really strives to place our assessments meaningfully within the teaching and learning process.

12:04.465 --> 12:14.232
The starting point of this transition to our new assessment system really began with the adoption of the Smarter Balanced Assessments in our state.

12:15.052 --> 12:27.200
These were developed by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, a state-led partnership whose goal is to provide world-class leadership and resources to improve teaching and learning using a balanced assessment system.

12:27.901 --> 12:33.825
Currently, 12 states, one territory, and the Bureau of Indian Education are members of that consortium.

12:34.805 --> 12:43.455
Since its inception, California has played a key role and a key leadership role in the governance of that membership.

12:44.236 --> 12:53.866
I am currently the Smarter Balanced Executive Committee Chair Elect and Carolina Cardenas from the California State University System also serves on the Executive Board.

12:55.007 --> 13:03.897
We have numerous staff that sit on advisory committees as well as professors throughout California who also provide direction to them.

13:04.717 --> 13:11.805
With me in the audience today is Executive Director Tony Alpert from the consortium in case you have questions regarding Smarter Balanced.

13:13.325 --> 13:19.387
It's also important to note that not only do we give our time to this consortium, but we give our resources as a state.

13:20.007 --> 13:32.931
We've made an investment in this comprehensive assessment system by ensuring it is available at no charge to districts and we have financially supported professional learning opportunities in support of that system.

13:36.226 --> 13:55.153
The Smarter Balanced Consortium created a balanced and comprehensive system of assessments that include end-of-year tests referred to as summative assessments, interim assessments to be used as periodic check-ins during the school year, and a digital library of instructional resources, professional learning, and formative assessment tools and resources.

13:56.013 --> 14:00.935
Each of these elements work together throughout the year to support our teachers and students.

14:02.827 --> 14:05.868
The Smarter Balanced assessment accurately measures what students know and can do.

14:06.369 --> 14:11.951
For ELA, students are tested in the following claim areas, reading, writing, listening, and research and inquiry.

14:12.571 --> 14:19.254
For math, students are tested in concepts and procedures, problem solving and data analysis, and communication reasoning.

14:21.431 --> 14:24.153
The Smarter Balanced assessments are computer adaptive tests.

14:24.593 --> 14:30.356
That means the test is customized for each student for a more accurate measurement of what they know and can do.

14:31.017 --> 14:35.739
Simply put, if a student answered a question correctly, the next question is more difficult.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.102
If a student answers a question incorrectly, the next question would be easier.

14:42.375 --> 14:46.937
A recent addition to the CAASPP system is our California Science Test, or CAASPP.

14:47.437 --> 14:49.558
The CAASPP is also an online test.

14:50.159 --> 15:00.724
It measures the range and depth of the California Next Generation Science Standards and provides models of high-quality items that reflect the fidelity to those standards.

15:01.664 --> 15:07.709
The CAST measures the claim areas of life science, physical science, and earth and space sciences.

15:08.509 --> 15:15.174
Each of the claim areas reflect the three-dimensional expectations established within the California Next Generation Science Standards.

15:15.795 --> 15:23.941
And those three-dimensional expectations include disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, as well as cross-cutting concepts.

15:26.533 --> 15:30.775
The California Alternate Assessments are available for ELA Math and Science.

15:31.216 --> 15:34.777
They are designed for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

15:35.438 --> 15:43.082
Only students with an individualized education program that designates the need for this particular assessment will be eligible.

15:47.139 --> 15:56.622
Our alternate assessments do provide students with developmentally appropriate ways to demonstrate what they know and can do as it relates to adapted grade level content.

15:57.483 --> 16:01.504
Science is the most recent addition to that and it will be operational next year.

16:04.105 --> 16:06.966
One of our new tests this year is the California Spanish assessment.

16:07.146 --> 16:13.528
The Spanish assessment is an optional test and it allows our LEAs to measure a student's performance in Spanish language arts.

16:15.899 --> 16:21.224
The assessment measures Spanish literacy in three claim areas, reading, writing mechanics, and listening.

16:21.904 --> 16:25.568
The Spanish assessment is a computer-based test with the following three goals.

16:26.168 --> 16:42.323
To measure a student's competency in Spanish language arts and provide student-level scores, provide data suitable in the evaluation of local Spanish language arts programs, and provide a high-quality measurable suitable to be used in part for the state seal of biliteracy.

16:45.077 --> 16:54.969
All students in grades 3 through 8 and grade 11 take the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessment unless a student's IEP designates that they take the alternate assessment.

16:56.010 --> 17:00.655
Students in grades 3 through 8 in high school can opt to take the California Spanish Assessment.

17:01.696 --> 17:14.983
Finally, the California science test is taken by all students in grades 5 and 8 and once in high school, in grades 10, 11, or 12, unless a student's IEP designates the California alternate assessment for science.

17:17.405 --> 17:17.685
Sorry.

17:17.705 --> 17:20.927
Do you guys have wood to knock on?

17:20.947 --> 17:30.772
Okay, we're going to... We happen to be in the middle of our peak testing time for CASP.

17:32.062 --> 17:36.226
Yesterday, we hit, now's the time, a record.

17:36.626 --> 17:38.127
I'm positive it was a world record.

17:39.549 --> 17:44.913
Over 683,000 concurrent users were on our system without any down.

17:45.614 --> 17:46.475
The systems remained up.

17:49.767 --> 17:51.809
So we're pretty proud of that.

17:52.570 --> 17:57.154
Tom Adams keeps pointing out that's more people than live in Wyoming, I believe.

17:59.096 --> 18:11.749
So we're very proud and we thank our contractors, ETS and AIR, for developing systems that we can rely on and that our schools and our districts know that they can rely on.

18:14.986 --> 18:18.410
Now, in addition to our CASP system is the LPAC system.

18:19.190 --> 18:23.334
The LPAC system consists of the initial LPAC and the summative LPAC.

18:24.015 --> 18:32.504
The purpose of the initial is to determine the English proficiency of students entering California schools who have a home language other than English.

18:34.400 --> 18:39.764
The purpose of the summative LPAC is to measure a student's progress toward English proficiency.

18:40.545 --> 18:47.170
This annual test helps determine whether a student is ready to be reclassified from English learner to fluent.

18:48.251 --> 18:54.476
Both of these assessments play important roles in identifying and ensuring that students receive the supports they need to do well in school.

18:57.230 --> 19:05.272
The initial and the summative LPAC measure a student's English proficiency in four claim areas, listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

19:07.592 --> 19:11.893
The LPAC is in the process of transitioning to a computer-based delivery approach.

19:12.854 --> 19:17.575
The initial LPAC is given to eligible students in kindergarten through grade 12.

19:18.195 --> 19:21.296
This is done within 30 days of enrollment in a California public school.

19:22.196 --> 19:26.017
Students will take the initial LPAC only once during their educational career.

19:26.917 --> 19:38.062
The summative LPAC is given to students in grades kindergarten through grade 12 who have been identified as English learners based on the results from either the initial LPAC or our prior test results.

19:41.098 --> 19:45.764
Each of the CASP and LPAC assessments are carefully designed to be accessible to our students.

19:46.305 --> 19:50.170
Our comprehensive system of assessment resources sets a national standard.

19:50.650 --> 19:54.315
They provide equal opportunity for our students to demonstrate what they know and can do.

19:54.736 --> 19:57.719
And this is definitely an area that I know we are proud of in our state.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.020
And I know that that seems like a lot, but it is not enough, right?

20:03.521 --> 20:08.322
So our division also supports work for several other assessments that are listed here.

20:09.023 --> 20:15.465
Some of them are things like our physical fitness test, NAEP, as some of you may know, and several others.

20:15.986 --> 20:17.046
So we have a lot going on.

20:18.667 --> 20:21.288
It is never a dull day in the assessment division.

20:22.328 --> 20:29.050
So the written item provides you updates on many things that are going on in the division, specifically related to CASP and ELPAC.

20:29.870 --> 20:33.471
And I will not go over all of those updates that are in your item.

20:33.611 --> 20:36.172
But I do want to give you an update on just one of those.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.653
And that is the launch of two new websites designed for students and their families.

20:45.180 --> 20:55.227
On April 25th, the department in collaboration with Smarter Balanced, HCM Strategies, and ETS launched the Starting Smarter websites for CASP and for LPAC.

20:56.108 --> 21:05.454
These websites are dedicated to helping families become familiar with our assessments so they can better understand their child's score and have easy access to family resources.

21:07.369 --> 21:20.593
They have sample student score reports with an explanation of the performance areas, sample test questions and practice tests, and they have a guide for parent teacher conferences that was supplied by the California PTA.

21:21.133 --> 21:26.535
And they also include resources that are no cost to support their child's learning at home.

21:29.000 --> 21:35.645
And both of these sites, both the LPAC and the CASP, Starting Smarter Sites, are available in both English and Spanish.

21:36.385 --> 21:42.610
Just last month, Lupita was interviewed by Univision talking about the Starting Smarter websites.

21:43.250 --> 21:48.994
And I wish I was bilingual so I could have listened to it, but I know you did a marvelous job.

21:50.156 --> 22:00.250
The Starting Smarter website is a multi-year project and will include resources for our science tests and our Spanish tests as well as our alternate assessments as they become available.

22:04.113 --> 22:21.657
Now I'm going to circle back to the action items before you, which include the approval of the recommendation for the transition to a computer-based initial and summative LPAC, revisions to the summative LPAC blueprints, and recommendations for the development of the alternate LPAC, including the general performance level descriptors.

22:22.597 --> 22:27.118
We are fortunate to have one of our national experts, Dr. Martha Thurlow from the National Center

22:27.498 --> 22:30.401
of Educational Outcomes, who will join me in a little bit up here.

22:31.121 --> 22:37.206
And if you have technical questions, particularly technical questions that are difficult, we will ask you to come up and answer those.

22:39.428 --> 22:49.376
So, in preparation for the development of the computer-based LPAC high-level test design, we're fortunate that we received advice from national experts, such as Dr. Kenji Hakuta and

22:51.226 --> 22:53.888
He wanted to be here just to see you, Member Rucker.

22:54.348 --> 22:55.869
Unfortunately, he was traveling.

22:56.989 --> 22:59.271
But that is why you all received a nice letter from him.

23:01.632 --> 23:02.633
I know, I know.

23:02.653 --> 23:06.915
And I specifically told him that you really wanted to see him.

23:07.876 --> 23:09.717
But we will get him up here in the future.

23:09.937 --> 23:10.718
We will work on that.

23:11.398 --> 23:17.362
And Dr. Diane August also, I know, wishes she could have been here and also sent you a letter of support.

23:19.368 --> 23:26.828
These are specialists in the fields of language development, bilingual education, and policy and research related to second language learners.

23:28.917 --> 23:40.743
We're also fortunate to work with national experts for the development of our alternate LPAC, Dr. Megan Carvinan, Dr. Lucretia Santibanez, Dr. Adine Sato, and Dr. Martha Thurlow.

23:41.163 --> 23:51.048
These experts are specialists in the fields of special education, policy outcomes, and assessment development for English learners, particularly those with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

23:52.743 --> 24:10.335
I'd now like to invite up Dr. Martha Furlow, who's the leading national experts on students with the most significant cognitive disabilities to come up and explain her involvement, along with other national experts in the development of the two high-level test designs, including the guiding principles and the benefits of computer-based assessments.

24:13.357 --> 24:14.077
Thank you, Michelle.

24:14.097 --> 24:16.239
Let's see if I can figure out how to work this.

24:19.201 --> 24:20.342
Assistance needed.

24:22.318 --> 24:23.178
Which one do I push?

24:23.799 --> 24:24.119
Enter?

24:25.240 --> 24:26.040
Enter, okay.

24:28.421 --> 24:29.642
What a national expert, right?

24:31.983 --> 24:33.324
I cannot figure out the max.

24:35.031 --> 24:35.912
Thank you, Michelle.

24:36.052 --> 24:44.899
I'm really pleased to have been invited to share my perspective on my involvement with the assessments that Michelle has been talking about.

24:45.459 --> 24:47.661
As she described earlier, I have several roles.

24:47.741 --> 24:52.144
I serve as a national expert to the alternate LPAC program.

24:52.945 --> 25:01.111
I also serve as a member of the LPAC technical advisory group, as well as the CASP technical advisory group.

25:01.972 --> 25:12.902
Through these roles, I have provided CDE and its testing contractor, ETS, with direct advice and guidance on the design and implementation of the assessments.

25:14.383 --> 25:26.614
CDE and ETS, I can say, used a really thoughtful, deliberate process to come up with recommendations for the LPAC and the alternate LPAC programs.

25:27.755 --> 25:32.357
The process for developing the recommendations for the two was similar.

25:32.597 --> 25:40.420
So, CDE and ETS convened national experts over the course of several meetings.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.400
It was not a one-time shot.

25:42.460 --> 25:43.921
We had lots of input.

25:44.621 --> 25:46.702
We considered and discussed

25:47.842 --> 25:53.067
several key documents, such as what the federal guidelines are.

25:53.607 --> 25:54.989
Make sure we're consistent with those.

25:56.230 --> 26:02.555
The ETS report from 2017 about transitioning to a computer-based assessment.

26:03.476 --> 26:13.225
And we looked at what other English language proficiency assessments were doing, including WIDA, which is one of the consortias of assessments, and ELPA 21.

26:14.646 --> 26:16.468
So we reviewed a lot of things.

26:16.528 --> 26:32.362
We also reviewed and discussed best practices for assessing English language proficiency and, for the alternate LPAC, best practices for assessing English learners with significant cognitive disabilities.

26:33.743 --> 26:42.110
And our input resulted in the development of the recommendations that you all are considering today.

26:45.441 --> 26:53.908
We had several guiding principles and we had lots of discussions about what these guiding principles should be so that we were all in agreement on them.

26:55.744 --> 27:04.646
And we wanted to make sure that the recommendations focused on what was most important in support of the students who took these tests.

27:05.526 --> 27:13.028
So we developed and followed a set, this set of guiding principles that you see.

27:13.968 --> 27:16.929
The assessments had to measure English language proficiency.

27:18.710 --> 27:34.203
The assessments had to be accessible by providing the testing supports that students needed and by requiring that the test questions considered linguistic and cultural fairness and sensitivity.

27:35.479 --> 27:44.645
And then finally, the assessments needed to consider the testing time and experience for the students and the test examiners.

27:44.725 --> 27:50.308
So we needed to keep thinking about those as we thought about what the assessment should be like.

27:53.570 --> 28:04.397
So I'll talk about the transition to computer-based LPAC first, and then talk about the alternate LPAC later in the presentation today.

28:07.597 --> 28:14.925
So the 2000, I think Michelle said the 2018-19 LPAC is being administered as a paper pencil assessment.

28:15.746 --> 28:26.538
The recommendations before the board today include the transition of LPAC to a computer based assessment beginning with the 2019-20 summative LPAC.

28:31.277 --> 28:36.764
So there are several benefits that we identified of a computer-based LPAC.

28:38.181 --> 28:55.790
A score report turnaround is a major challenge for educators of English learners who use the data to make critical decisions about EL classification and decisions on providing support, instructional support to their students.

28:56.390 --> 29:03.794
Currently, the results of the paper ELPAC administration are going to be available to local education agencies about six weeks

29:04.654 --> 29:09.016
after they return the answer books to ETS for processing and scoring.

29:09.896 --> 29:20.701
So that means if a student completed the summit of LPAC today, May 8th, their results would not be available to their school district until approximately July.

29:22.201 --> 29:26.583
after taking into account the return time and the processing time and the scoring time.

29:28.104 --> 29:37.748
So results of a computer-based LPAC test will be available to local education agencies within four weeks after the student completes testing.

29:38.948 --> 29:50.233
If a student completed the computer-based summative LPAC today, their test results would be available to their school districts by June 5th, when many schools are still in session here in California.

29:52.174 --> 30:01.721
Another benefit, the computer-based LPAC provides an opportunity for more engaging tests with authentic tasks.

30:01.861 --> 30:10.627
The 2019-20 computer-based summative LPAC will include full-color visuals and interactive features.

30:12.148 --> 30:20.133
The CDE and ETS can introduce more authentic, engaging test types in the next administrations.

30:21.943 --> 30:30.966
The computer-based LPAC helps support students' familiarity in interacting with technology in the classroom.

30:31.906 --> 30:41.009
The devices can be used for administering computer-based LPAC are generally the same ones that are used by students every day as part of their classroom activities.

30:43.975 --> 30:49.479
Another benefit, the computer-based LPAC provides improved accessibility resources.

30:49.619 --> 30:51.661
I think this is a really important one.

30:52.382 --> 31:02.489
LPAC delivered in an online platform promotes greater consistency with the accessibility resources commonly used across the other CASP content assessments.

31:03.710 --> 31:20.222
Enhanced accessibility resources promote greater flexibility and opportunity for the IEP team and the test examiner to use the resources to best meet the students' needs at all grade levels.

31:22.084 --> 31:26.747
And then the computer-based LPAC provides a streamlined test administration process.

31:26.767 --> 31:31.411
So students and educators will now interact with a single assessment platform.

31:32.552 --> 31:37.800
ensuring technological parity between the ALPAC and the other California tests.

31:38.741 --> 31:48.336
Accessibility and universal tools features will be more consistent across all the California tests once ALPAC is moved online.

31:50.836 --> 31:56.801
And then finally, the computer-based ELPAC provides standardized entry and exit procedures.

31:57.101 --> 32:18.657
So using a single platform will help reduce the burden for educators and students to deal with different testing systems or materials, which also allows content and language or ELD teachers to better communicate with each other about EL students based on one single testing platform.

32:20.546 --> 32:24.111
Those are a lot of benefits, and I'm going to turn it back to Michelle.

32:38.139 --> 32:38.920
Thank you, Martha.

32:39.841 --> 32:48.012
Based on the deliberate process that Martha just described, we're proposing three recommendations for the computer-based LPAC.

32:48.293 --> 32:50.896
Those are described in Section 1G of Attachment 2.

32:52.947 --> 33:03.014
We are revising the recommendation documented with Attachment 2 from recommending a one-on-one administration in K1 to a one-on-one test administration for K2.

33:03.715 --> 33:11.421
The recommendation is for all domains where the test examiner interacts with the student device interface to both navigate and enter responses.

33:12.541 --> 33:20.868
Next, to address developmental needs for students in kindergarten through grade 2, we are proposing to maintain the writing domain as a paper-pencil test.

33:21.963 --> 33:45.501
Finally, the CDE recommends that the test design increase accessibility resources for all students, including resources to assist with computer navigation, such as allowing test examiners to help students navigate through the system during group administrations, to conduct one-on-one administrations in any grade, and lastly, to print items based on student need.

33:46.582 --> 33:56.731
Prior to administration, test examiners will have access to a screener that will help identify if a student is ready to independently interact with the computer.

33:57.792 --> 34:08.502
This will be beneficial for our educators as they make decisions on the most appropriate supports to ensure accurate measures of English proficiency, including the supports I just recently mentioned.

34:09.500 --> 34:17.040
Finally, training and practice tests will be available for students to try out the items and try out those accessibility resources.

34:18.973 --> 34:25.255
The department and its contractor on this, it is ETS, are committed to getting this right.

34:26.456 --> 34:32.618
Data has been and will continue to be collected to further inform the development of the computer-based LPAC.

34:33.378 --> 34:42.161
Currently, ETS is finalizing a usability pilot study that gained insight on how students and examiners interacted with the online test.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.342
The preliminary findings are providing us with usable information.

34:47.062 --> 34:52.843
Some examples of that information are that most students were able to navigate through the various screens.

34:54.784 --> 34:59.105
Students don't speak much when the examiner sits right next to them.

34:59.245 --> 34:59.965
That didn't work.

35:00.205 --> 35:06.267
But when you put the examiner on the other side and they are face to face, they opened up and they spoke.

35:06.867 --> 35:11.228
So those are the types of pieces of information that we were able to gather.

35:12.268 --> 35:22.959
We also value the input of our educators who participated in that usability pilot in terms of providing us with information that could make the job of administering the test easier.

35:23.920 --> 35:28.164
Based on that input, ETS is making adjustments to the directions for administration.

35:29.165 --> 35:33.807
As we look to the future, take note that this fall, two studies will also be conducted.

35:34.227 --> 35:41.851
The first is a mode comparability study that will allow us to compare the performance of the computer-based test with that of the paper-based test.

35:42.851 --> 35:51.355
ETS will also conduct a field test that will allow us to select items for the operational computer-based LPAC.

35:52.503 --> 36:03.981
Findings from these activities will be evaluated to inform any recommended changes that we might need to bring to the board for your review and approval.

36:07.372 --> 36:11.996
California is not alone with assessing English learners using computer-based assessments.

36:12.656 --> 36:27.087
We are proposing a thoughtful approach and have done so after taking time to build a comprehensive assessment technology platform that would be able to successfully support the inclusion of the LPAC as well as our other assessments that are coming online.

36:28.028 --> 36:35.174
The department has leveraged the lessons that were learned from the other states that were implementing computer-based English language proficiency assessments.

36:36.215 --> 36:51.522
Some of the takeaways that we learned looking at what those other states were doing was we want to provide that simulation or screener to determine if students are familiar enough with a computer in order to test independently.

36:53.503 --> 36:57.205
We wanted to keep our writing domain paper, pencil for the lower grades.

36:57.285 --> 36:58.906
That was based on other experiences.

37:00.188 --> 37:06.972
We wanted to also keep speaking as a one-on-one administration with scoring in the moment by our examiners.

37:08.553 --> 37:20.981
We will be using voice capture for the speaking, but that's a means of calibrating our scoring and ensuring that local scoring for a select sample is appropriate.

37:22.785 --> 37:25.748
As shown on the map, 48 states and Washington, D.C.

37:26.108 --> 37:28.551
have made this transition to computer-based tests.

37:28.931 --> 37:36.118
It gives us confidence that as long as we put students first in our decision-making process, we can do this and we can be successful at it.

37:38.861 --> 37:44.607
After the first operational administration, the results will provide information to make

37:47.463 --> 38:01.258
After the first operational administration of the paper pencil test, let me make that clear, it provided us with information so that we could make targeted adjustments to the distribution of task types in the summative test blueprint.

38:01.478 --> 38:06.344
We are recommending that we do that at this time as we're making all of our other transitions.

38:07.267 --> 38:15.113
The proposed changes are being recommended in order to improve the measurement of student proficiency across the full range of English language proficiency.

38:15.854 --> 38:29.424
Our blueprint changes are described in attachment four and include making minor changes to the speaking section where we replaced items with those that provide a more accurate measure of a student's readiness to speak in an academic setting.

38:30.365 --> 38:33.367
Similar adjustments were made in listening, reading and writing.

38:36.531 --> 38:44.898
Now we're going to present our alternate LPAC recommendations and I'll start by inviting Martha Thurlow to join me once again.

38:48.320 --> 38:48.741
Thank you.

38:50.602 --> 39:00.130
I'm really excited about California's work for its alternate LPAC because this is a student population that is really near and dear to my heart.

39:01.154 --> 39:23.165
I've been encouraging attention to assessment of the English language proficiency of students with significant cognitive disabilities for several years now, and I think one of the benefits is that we'll be able to attend to their English language learning needs that often have been ignored in this population before.

39:24.705 --> 39:43.096
I've been involved in the development of the alternate assessments for both WIDA, one of the consortia, and ELPA21, another of the consortia, and believe that the alternate ELPAC brings together the best design to assess English learners with significant cognitive disabilities.

39:43.796 --> 40:04.618
It strikes the right balance between meeting the technical requirements to provide consistent measure of English language proficiency across California and meet the needs of a very, very diverse group of students, including students with a wide range of individual communication modes.

40:06.311 --> 40:12.615
The alternate LPAC allows California to comply with the requirements of the federal law, which is important.

40:13.716 --> 40:17.319
But if you have questions about that, I'll let Michelle respond to those questions.

40:19.500 --> 40:28.946
The alternate LPAC provides for a consistent state measure of English language proficiency for all students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

40:29.907 --> 40:36.536
Currently, in California, it's up to local education agencies to determine how they assess these students.

40:37.397 --> 40:44.848
When alternate LPAC is available, they will no longer need to rely solely on locally provided measures.

40:45.888 --> 40:55.035
The alternate LPAC is designed specifically for this population to include the use of individual communication modes.

40:55.636 --> 40:57.557
Extremely important for this population.

40:58.438 --> 40:59.899
So, Michelle.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.446
That was very firm at the end, wasn't it?

41:08.466 --> 41:10.968
So, let's...

41:13.919 --> 41:22.282
The department's proposing the following recommendations for the alternate LPAC that support the test design, which may be found in Section 1F of Attachment 3.

41:23.042 --> 41:31.085
The proposed changes request that the alternate LPAC be administered in grades and grade spans that are consistent with the summative LPAC.

41:31.585 --> 41:40.387
That would be K1 and 2 would be individual forms, 3-5 would be combined, 6-8 combined, 9-10, and then lastly 11-12.

41:42.168 --> 41:55.934
We would recommend that it be administered one-on-one for all students and that we provide accessibility resources including universal tools, designated supports, and accommodations for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

41:57.094 --> 42:03.577
We also recommend that we use local scoring for the constructed response items similar to other California alternate assessments.

42:06.055 --> 42:11.622
We recommend using a single blueprint for both initial and summative alternate LPACs.

42:12.222 --> 42:16.428
Based on discussions with national experts, we recommend the use of integrated tasks.

42:17.168 --> 42:25.318
For example, speaking and writing, which are both expressive modes of communication, could be combined into a single assessment task.

42:26.351 --> 42:39.178
Integrating task types provides students the opportunity to receive and express language in their preferred communication mode, ensuring meaningful participation for students using various communication devices.

42:43.040 --> 42:48.323
There are many opportunities for us to gather data and information along the development cycle.

42:49.144 --> 42:54.487
And as we always do, we will provide you with updates based on the reports from the studies as well as the field test.

42:56.385 --> 43:11.563
As part of the development of the high-level test designs, CDE and ETS staff visited the Sacramento County Office of Education Schools on the campuses of Rio Linda Middle School, Rio Linda High School, and Dry Creek Elementary.

43:12.404 --> 43:16.186
A shout out to Principal Eric Crawford for facilitating that visit.

43:16.566 --> 43:18.807
One of them was the Friday before spring break.

43:19.367 --> 43:24.369
So it was very impressive that they actually allowed us into those classrooms.

43:25.270 --> 43:35.935
Our primary focus was to observe students with the most significant cognitive disabilities interact in their learning environment with the goal to inform the development of the alternate LPAC.

43:36.915 --> 43:42.738
Students of various grades and abilities were observed on two different occasion in 11 classrooms.

43:44.638 --> 43:51.041
Some of our observations were that students engaged in classroom activities using instructional and communication supports.

43:51.781 --> 44:04.507
Teachers were intentionally focused on developing students' ability to use their individual communication mode as a means of increasing the student's ability to not only access the content but also engage with their peers.

44:05.607 --> 44:11.450
Students in the inclusive programs in the lower grades were independent interacting with the devices.

44:11.791 --> 44:17.894
And the images here are images of students at that field trip that we took.

44:19.415 --> 44:23.477
And they just happened to all be on their devices that day.

44:23.537 --> 44:25.898
That was not something we set up for a picture.

44:26.339 --> 44:28.160
I just saw it and said we should take a picture.

44:30.726 --> 44:35.748
So another action before you this morning is the approval of the general performance level descriptors.

44:36.228 --> 44:41.429
These are short policy descriptors that convey the degree of student proficiency in English.

44:42.090 --> 44:46.711
They convey to educators, parents, students, and the public the meaning of assessment results.

44:49.198 --> 44:55.663
With input from experts and stakeholders, the CDE determined that the scripter should include three levels of performance.

44:56.223 --> 45:04.130
The CDE recommends approval of these three general performance level descriptors as seen in Section 2D of Attachment 3.

45:07.259 --> 45:12.820
As we continue with our test development, we plan to bring several actions before you.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.580
This is not the end.

45:14.840 --> 45:16.041
We are not yet to the end.

45:16.661 --> 45:18.801
In July, we'll have proposed regulations.

45:18.861 --> 45:21.762
Assume we have action today in support of our recommendation.

45:22.042 --> 45:24.582
In July, we'll come forward with regulations.

45:25.442 --> 45:32.744
We intend for those regulations to cover both the computer-based assessment as well as the alternate LPAC to the best of our ability.

45:34.004 --> 45:42.472
Included in the July item will also be the proposed accessibility resources as many of you know we do that as part of our regulatory process.

45:44.033 --> 45:48.216
The summative LPAC student score reports will come to you in September 2019.

45:48.617 --> 46:00.346
You have not in the past had authority over the LPAC student score reports but the transition of those within our ETS contract puts that in your realm so we will bring those to you for the first time.

46:01.327 --> 46:05.149
The initial LPAC student score reports will come to you in spring of 2020.

46:06.610 --> 46:15.434
The alternate LPAC test blueprint will be brought to you in May 2020, followed by the threshold scores and student score reports in spring 2021.

46:17.835 --> 46:21.097
So as you can see, we are still in the beginning of this journey.

46:23.649 --> 46:27.510
The slide shows the board approved high-level timeline for implementation.

46:28.550 --> 46:36.371
This timeline was approved in November during the approval of the CASP LPAC ETS contract.

46:38.552 --> 46:47.774
As you can see, the first computer-based LPAC will be administered in February 2020, followed by the initial LPAC in the following school year beginning in July 2020.

46:50.556 --> 46:59.220
The 2015 LPAC contract required all of our LPAC items to be written for this specific transition to computer-based platform.

46:59.701 --> 47:03.702
So we're well on our way of having a bank of items that is ready for transition.

47:04.763 --> 47:08.185
The first operational alternate LPAC will be

47:09.145 --> 47:14.749
the initial in July of 2021, followed by the summative in February of 2022.

47:15.690 --> 47:23.196
This timeline and recommendations given are consistent with that board approved action in November of 2018.

47:24.357 --> 47:25.157
Can that be right?

47:25.718 --> 47:26.178
Goodness.

47:28.480 --> 47:35.085
So now I am here as well as all of my lifelines behind me to answer any questions.

47:36.937 --> 47:47.402
Thank you very much and we'll first I want to ask Ting Sun who is our liaison to respond and then we're going to go to public comment and then we'll get to questions from the group.

47:47.813 --> 47:48.393
Okay, very good.

47:48.433 --> 47:55.335
So again, Michelle, commending you and your team for just the fantastic job you're doing in the assessments.

47:55.455 --> 48:03.617
And I think I had mentioned in our last meeting that assessments was the first piece that went out in our new system of assessments and accountability.

48:03.937 --> 48:08.118
And we're at a point where we're refining lots of the components of it.

48:08.418 --> 48:11.799
But then there are other components that we're still building, like the LPAC.

48:12.359 --> 48:21.225
And so I know that this has been highly anticipated in the full implementation of our LPAC to make it consistent and to be online.

48:21.745 --> 48:29.691
And I think what you said around as we are implementing all of these different assessments, we have to keep the students in mind.

48:30.471 --> 48:44.959
And as we move forward with the pilots of field tests, we will be gathering data, and as with every other system, we will be refining it and continuing to look at what we might still need to do or what has been working, et cetera.

48:45.019 --> 48:52.644
So I just want to, again, commend you on the work and looking forward to us moving forward again on the assessment pieces.

48:53.524 --> 48:58.986
Great, and I think we have some public comment which we'll take and then we'll get to our other questions and discussion.

48:59.286 --> 49:01.286
Will the following speakers please line up at the podium?

49:01.466 --> 49:09.789
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Marlene Batista, Annie Duong, Carol Gallegos, Jan Gosofson-Correa, Angela Duramos, and Sheila Whitley.

49:11.581 --> 49:12.121
Good morning.

49:12.782 --> 49:19.447
My name is Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

49:20.248 --> 49:33.639
Significant concerns were raised by our teachers regarding their proposed CBA, such as the impact of the CBA on newcomers and pupils in kindergarten and grades one and two with little or no experience with computers.

49:34.741 --> 49:39.562
The majority of our concerns have been addressed by CDE and ETS.

49:40.102 --> 49:46.624
However, there is still a lack of complete acceptance of the CBA by many of our teachers.

49:47.705 --> 49:56.007
But because the LPAC is a very significant assessment and the field has been waiting for this, we support moving forward with the CBA

49:56.707 --> 49:59.409
as reflected in the high design field document.

49:59.870 --> 50:13.921
However, we request assurances that teachers and districts be given opportunities to provide further recommendations and suggestions before the final administration of the CBA in February 2020.

50:14.021 --> 50:14.341
Time.

50:14.421 --> 50:14.841
Thank you.

50:23.615 --> 50:25.718
Good morning, Dr. Marlene Batista from CABE.

50:26.919 --> 50:41.478
Again, CABE does support the transition of the CBA ALPAC as reflected in the proposed high-level test design, as the CBA enables better implementation of the standardized entry and exit procedures for ELs and as new requirements under ESSA and a quicker turnaround results for our teachers.

50:42.379 --> 50:55.669
As Martha said before, there was a lot of expressed concerns by teachers about the maneuverability of the computer that may be problematic for our newcomer students who have little exposure to computers, as well as our K through second grade students.

50:56.070 --> 51:05.317
We want to ensure that the testing is testing the language acquisition and not the ability to use a computer, since we know that a lot of students may or may not be able to handle that.

51:05.877 --> 51:27.295
We do understand and appreciate that it's been recommended that the CBA be one-on-one for K-2 to address some of these concerns, but we also have to consider that this may not, although it seems that this reduces the time constraints on school districts, it may actually impact them because right now a lot of districts are paying extra money to have teams come in and test the one-on-one speaking portion for all grade levels as well as the one-on-one K-1.

51:27.756 --> 51:34.101
So adding another grade level would be a big concern for a lot of districts in these budget times that we're in constraints, so thank you.

51:42.042 --> 51:45.906
Please note your name and association as you begin speaking.

51:46.506 --> 51:47.808
I'm Dr. Carol Gallegos.

51:47.868 --> 51:53.994
I'm with Hanford Elementary School District, the district that hosted a handful of educators for the recent usability study.

51:54.615 --> 52:03.604
While I appreciate that K-1 will be unchanged, I witnessed most 3A students struggling with the computer because many don't have daily access yet.

52:04.304 --> 52:06.705
Paper materials must be ordered months in advance.

52:07.165 --> 52:11.548
How will a test given just before testing allow timely access to paper forms?

52:11.968 --> 52:18.631
Will it only be one-on-one testing, making it impossible for us to financially exercise the option for paper?

52:19.051 --> 52:24.634
The requirement to record violates biometric privacy laws, leaving districts open to lawsuits.

52:25.214 --> 52:34.820
A new student may be erroneously identified as an EL, but even more devastating will be students with poor computer skills who cannot be reclassified in a timely manner.

52:35.241 --> 52:36.802
This affects students' lives.

52:37.582 --> 52:40.024
Fast scores doesn't equal accurate scores.

52:40.604 --> 52:44.487
Some other states are going back to computer due to lowered performance on computer.

52:44.907 --> 52:51.151
The fully developed test and the computer skills test both need more widespread testing, input and validity confirmation.

52:51.769 --> 52:53.292
before implementation.

52:53.833 --> 52:57.018
I understand the monetary cost, but please consider the human cost.

52:57.459 --> 52:59.703
I urge you to speak for English learners today.

53:06.983 --> 53:07.563
Good morning.

53:08.064 --> 53:14.667
My name is Annie Bich-Loi Nguyen, and I am on the board of Tabe California Association for Binary Education.

53:15.047 --> 53:19.070
And I am representing Region 1, which is our region here.

53:19.930 --> 53:25.233
Like my colleagues have said, we are in support of the CBA LPAC.

53:25.313 --> 53:33.918
However, we would urge CDE, ETS, and the board to consider, careful consider, for the K-2

53:35.058 --> 53:36.079
and the newcomers.

53:36.219 --> 53:46.045
Because when you look at the K-2, we have about 150,000 kindergarteners, and they are the ones who take the LPAC initial on computer.

53:46.166 --> 53:49.568
And you think about the first 30 days of school that they have to do that.

53:50.048 --> 53:57.473
And then newcomers come in from all sorts of different parts of the world that they may not have access to computers.

53:57.573 --> 53:57.853
And so,

53:59.034 --> 54:06.926
Again, please reconsider or carefully consider as we go on with the pilot test in October.

54:06.946 --> 54:07.687
Thank you.

54:14.124 --> 54:14.964
Hello, good morning.

54:15.464 --> 54:16.545
My name is Jan Correa.

54:16.665 --> 54:18.505
I'm the Chief Executive Officer of CAVE.

54:18.545 --> 54:19.785
We're well represented today.

54:19.805 --> 54:28.167
I'm also here as a former principal, a director at the San Bernardino County Schools Office, and most importantly, a former fifth and sixth grade teacher.

54:28.307 --> 54:34.549
And so I think as we're speaking, I know that we all are speaking with our children at the heart of what we're thinking and working towards.

54:35.409 --> 54:43.813
The administration of the LPAC, as you've heard, is of really high interest to our CABE, over 4,000 members, and really to the field.

54:43.853 --> 54:47.535
That's been well demonstrated by the comments of Carol Gallegos and my colleagues as well.

54:48.136 --> 55:01.082
And so while we're very appreciative of the work that's been done at the department, just really thorough and thoughtful, and just the deep, I think, process that we've gone through, we appreciate also the intent that there will be continued consideration after the field test

55:03.784 --> 55:10.051
Hearing from the field what they're thinking, what they're feeling, how it's really being implemented, really does make a difference.

55:10.231 --> 55:16.679
Our teachers care so deeply about this, and they want to see our students really progress and show their progression.

55:17.040 --> 55:21.505
We know language is a human process, and we thank you for keeping that at the heart of the work that you're doing as well.

55:21.685 --> 55:22.226
Thanks very much.

55:27.133 --> 55:29.635
Hello, I'm Angela Duramos on behalf of CTA.

55:29.935 --> 55:34.318
And as always, I want to get the little reality of what this looks like in our classrooms.

55:35.039 --> 55:39.962
The piece that we're concerned about is that this is one metric.

55:40.403 --> 55:42.924
There's so many more metrics when we're actually doing the work.

55:43.785 --> 55:48.989
The input from the parents, the input from the teacher, and most importantly, the input from the students matter.

55:49.529 --> 56:04.814
So parent concerns, what the teacher's anecdotal information or take on it, and then also where the student is academically in other areas relative to the LPAC has an impact on the scores.

56:05.775 --> 56:08.517
The use of computers, as mentioned before, is a concern.

56:09.698 --> 56:12.000
It doesn't match, always, our teaching conditions.

56:12.340 --> 56:16.644
So using the computer for testing conditions already implies some bias right there.

56:17.504 --> 56:30.956
And finally, please talk to teachers about the professional development, the impact, what the real reclassification that districts are implementing now, and so that it's not a singular use.

56:31.076 --> 56:31.376
Thank you.

56:36.019 --> 56:38.582
I assume that is the end of public comment.

56:38.622 --> 56:39.924
We'll start some discussion.

56:39.964 --> 56:42.808
I'd like to launch us off with a couple of thoughts.

56:44.510 --> 56:49.015
You can hear the concerns about whether kids are ready for computer, etc.

56:49.516 --> 56:54.242
Ideally, we would have a full pilot year to figure this out and develop the strategies.

56:54.882 --> 57:04.269
But I do want to reinforce several things that Michelle said about California's cautious, although rapid, approach to bringing this online.

57:04.329 --> 57:09.573
And I want to applaud the CDE staff for their creativity and how they're thinking about addressing it.

57:09.693 --> 57:11.754
And Michelle may want to add on to this.

57:15.397 --> 57:25.763
The staff has, as you know, added the notion of adding second grade to the K-1 for paper and pencil administration or one-on-one administration.

57:25.783 --> 57:34.128
And as one of the speakers noted, there are some states, Ohio, Tennessee, Florida, are kind of looking to going back to paper and pencil because they had had some challenges with

57:34.728 --> 57:41.177
The other thing that is on the docket is a screening tool for all students.

57:41.317 --> 57:49.607
I'll ask Michelle to say more about this in a moment, so we can get a better understanding of it before we start our discussion.

57:51.790 --> 58:03.356
the educator, the teacher, the test administrator, to figure out with a little, probably a game-like thing that kids do on the computer, whether they're ready to take, whether they can manipulate the computer to take the test.

58:03.416 --> 58:07.338
And then for all grades, not just in K-2.

58:07.918 --> 58:19.544
So newcomers, students who do not have tech access could be administered tests by paper, in small groups, or one-on-one.

58:19.944 --> 58:24.547
in a variety of modalities that fit the needs of the student and the context.

58:24.587 --> 58:27.349
So I'm going to ask Michelle to say more about that in a moment.

58:27.409 --> 58:32.753
I think that's a real big advance in thinking about computer-based administration of tests.

58:34.374 --> 58:36.015
We will have pilots in the fall.

58:36.075 --> 58:39.318
There will be other analyses by mode of

58:39.838 --> 59:02.401
taking the test with comparison groups that we'll get the benefit of, maybe not for implementation fully in the spring, but we want this to come back to the board for ongoing development and revisit, as many of the speakers asked, continue to get input from the field, continue to pilot test, and continue to revise and refine the way that we would approach this.

59:03.141 --> 59:10.386
And we're aware, too, that there is kind of a mega issue with respect to test-based processing, computer-based processing of text.

59:11.207 --> 59:21.815
And I'll just mention this because this is a long-term issue for everyone in every state, including California, as testing is, for many good reasons, moving to computer-based administration.

59:22.635 --> 59:27.319
But there has been a growing body of research on the way in which people process text from print.

59:27.839 --> 59:42.649
And from digital, there was a recent meta-analysis that looked at all the studies over the last about 17 years, which found that there's almost always an advantage in performance and comprehension of reading on paper versus on machine.

59:43.229 --> 59:55.295
And that advantage is increased in time-constrained reading rather than self-paced reading, so that has to do with whether we time test or whether we allow people the time they need on those tests.

59:56.095 --> 01:00:05.360
It's consistent across text, but there's less of a paper advantage for narratives versus informational text, so that's another piece of the puzzle.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.943
And then the advantage of paper-based reading increases over the years.

01:00:10.003 --> 01:00:13.025
So this is like a mega issue that we're all dealing with.

01:00:13.105 --> 01:00:20.310
And I think the CDE staff have been extremely thoughtful about how to give access.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:31.577
These issues are going to be greater for folks who are less familiar with the computer, have had less access and experience, and also by age sometimes.

01:00:31.637 --> 01:00:35.320
Although I do have a grandson, whom you'll hear about frequently,

01:00:37.601 --> 01:00:39.981
Who isn't manipulating the computer at 20 months?

01:00:40.061 --> 01:00:44.002
And there are kids like that, too, who will take to it very easily.

01:00:44.062 --> 01:00:50.604
But we want to be responsive to all of the children in our state, in all of the communities in our state, and to the concerns of teachers.

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:59.147
So I just wanted to frame our conversation around the way in which the department is approaching this complicated issue.

01:00:59.187 --> 01:01:03.688
And Michelle, do you want to add a little more about that innovation that California

01:01:04.488 --> 01:01:05.569
Absolutely.

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:13.116
I also want to just acknowledge CABE, Californians Together and CTA that came up and made comments.

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:27.027
I am so lucky that I meet with those organizations once a month and we have conversations and I want them to know that I am dedicated to ensuring that we continue those conversations and we talk about this transition in those monthly calls that we have.

01:01:29.028 --> 01:01:36.471
In the usability study, which was mentioned by many of those presenters, some of them brought up concerns that they saw in the usability study.

01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:41.053
One thing about that usability study was it didn't use the screener.

01:01:41.253 --> 01:01:45.554
So we definitely had students interacting with devices that were not ready to do so.

01:01:46.075 --> 01:01:49.516
So our screener will provide our examiners

01:01:50.816 --> 01:01:58.784
those that maybe are not using devices every day, so they don't know whether or not a student is literate in terms of using advice.

01:01:59.224 --> 01:02:11.114
It would provide them an opportunity that doesn't look at content, but looks at whether or not can they scroll, can they click, can they navigate a mouse or a touch screen and that type of thing.

01:02:11.915 --> 01:02:22.063
That quick screener, which we are developing, will allow our educators to make a decision regarding tiers of support.

01:02:22.224 --> 01:02:24.205
And that's how I am thinking of them.

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:35.835
The first tier of support is those students that you could still give an administration within a group setting, but you might need to do some little quick, this is the click.

01:02:36.255 --> 01:02:39.117
Very little, very little need.

01:02:39.938 --> 01:02:48.462
Then there are students who need a one-on-one administration where that adult is interacting with that device.

01:02:48.922 --> 01:02:55.606
Our screener needs to give our examiners information so that they know that that student needs that.

01:02:56.346 --> 01:03:02.387
The other piece of information in the last year are those students that need the print on demand option.

01:03:03.088 --> 01:03:06.308
So these will not be forms that they have to rely on.

01:03:06.668 --> 01:03:17.931
They will be able to print on demand locally so that they can provide our students with the access that they need to this high stakes test that is high stakes for our students.

01:03:18.371 --> 01:03:20.172
So, we are dedicated to getting it right.

01:03:20.973 --> 01:03:26.816
I know that there were some who participated in the usability study that some of it was frustrating.

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:30.038
We were trying a lot of new things out and some of the things worked and some of them didn't.

01:03:30.738 --> 01:03:36.622
But we also recognize that there were students who definitely would not in a normal testing situation.

01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:48.751
have interacted with that device without using one of the supports that we hope and are ensured that you will act upon in July when we bring those resources back for your action.

01:03:48.771 --> 01:03:52.674
Thank you very much.

01:03:52.974 --> 01:03:55.796
And Michelle, you might want to stay right where you are for a moment.

01:03:56.237 --> 01:04:03.762
Maybe we'll begin with clarifying questions so we all have a level playing field in our understanding and then go to any deeper discussion that we need.

01:04:04.683 --> 01:04:05.324
So I think

01:04:08.274 --> 01:04:10.896
Okay, Eileen, did you say you want to make some comments?

01:04:12.317 --> 01:04:14.859
Okay, any clarifying questions first?

01:04:14.979 --> 01:04:15.260
Kim?

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:27.729
I just wanted to ask if you could address how districts are compensated or if at all for the additional work that's required for the one-on-one administration that would be extended to K-2.

01:04:29.415 --> 01:04:38.520
So our apportionment system is the process by which we compensate our districts for the work of administering our tests.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:49.805
We bring to the board annually, I don't know, I can't remember now which month, those apportionment figures for you to act upon, those rates.

01:04:49.865 --> 01:04:55.588
And so we can definitely take into consideration the process by which we're recommending that we test.

01:05:02.457 --> 01:05:04.698
What exactly will come back to us in July?

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:06.798
Because I think we heard some concerns.

01:05:06.838 --> 01:05:11.140
It would be great to get reflections post-administration of the assessment.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:16.121
Also, right now what we reimburse is five, I believe it's five dollars per student.

01:05:16.581 --> 01:05:25.384
And so, that's not on, is that on us or the legislature to up that if we feel that it actually requires, why are we smiling?

01:05:25.424 --> 01:05:27.384
Am I crossing someone's ear?

01:05:28.004 --> 01:05:28.204
No.

01:05:32.997 --> 01:05:34.277
Got no money is always a problem.

01:05:35.638 --> 01:05:40.901
But I do think that it would be good for us to have an accurate sense of what it takes to administer this.

01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:52.648
And also, if you could tell me a little bit about the training for the screener, because I know that in some schools, the counselor will do some aspect of the assessment and then the classroom teacher administers another aspect of it.

01:05:53.048 --> 01:05:56.550
So how does that training work for the screener in particular?

01:05:58.632 --> 01:05:59.372
Several questions there.

01:05:59.593 --> 01:06:02.796
The first about the process of the apportionment.

01:06:02.977 --> 01:06:04.999
So the $5 is not set in law.

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:11.126
So we can come back to you with recommendations on what the apportionment rate should be.

01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:35.773
The process by which we get money is annually I send over my request and I say this is what it's going to cost for our contract as well as our apportionments and Historically, I have not had any issues with working closely with Department of Finance for getting the funding that we need for that for tests for which there is a required apportionment and LPAC is one of them and

01:06:36.093 --> 01:06:40.234
So, I don't anticipate there being issues with that.

01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:45.136
Of course, we'll come back to you with suggestions and recommendations.

01:06:45.456 --> 01:06:46.636
Your next question was on training.

01:06:46.997 --> 01:06:52.038
So, training for our LPAC is actually different than our training for the CASP assessment.

01:06:52.438 --> 01:06:53.899
That is, you're required

01:06:54.699 --> 01:06:55.699
to be trained.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.942
We actually require that because there's some live scoring that's going on and there's calibrations that need to be done.

01:07:03.283 --> 01:07:08.765
So there's actually more training with LPAC than we have with our CASP examiners.

01:07:10.117 --> 01:07:16.441
The training that we do for them in the past has been very focused on scoring and administration procedures.

01:07:16.842 --> 01:07:24.647
We obviously will need to add to that this idea of administering the screener for those students that need it.

01:07:26.388 --> 01:07:29.109
Currently will be no mandate that they give the screener.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:38.654
There are definitely teachers who are working with a student all year long and they know the student's ability to interact with the device or not interact with the device.

01:07:39.494 --> 01:07:45.057
And so we want to make sure that we give guidance on who should you give this to, almost everyone.

01:07:45.517 --> 01:07:48.259
But there might be some instances where it is unneeded.

01:07:48.699 --> 01:07:54.942
We want to make sure we give advice on what to do with the results and how you would use that as part of making those decisions.

01:07:56.023 --> 01:08:03.534
We are currently looking at our accessibility framework, which is a draft document that our contractor produces for us.

01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:10.444
We use that document to develop our proposed regulations to you, which includes

01:08:12.066 --> 01:08:18.268
ideas about what supports to use, including these supports for navigation of the device.

01:08:18.808 --> 01:08:27.631
We've also provided that draft document to the organizations that spoke earlier so that we can get their feedback.

01:08:27.992 --> 01:08:34.254
One of the things we're looking at is wanting to make sure we provide the examiners

01:08:35.214 --> 01:08:42.736
access to resources for students that are not necessarily IEP or special ed students.

01:08:43.056 --> 01:08:50.337
So that's one thing we're looking at, are there support center and accommodations that we can move down to all students and making sure that everything is appropriate.

01:08:50.657 --> 01:08:58.079
So when we come back in July, it'll be mostly focused on that process of building out those supports.

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:02.680
I also always have an update item.

01:09:03.901 --> 01:09:08.404
You will notice that LPAC is now combined with our update item that we normally have for CASP.

01:09:08.785 --> 01:09:18.433
I'm happy to also report out on any other conversations that we've had and how we are responding to feedback during that presentation.

01:09:19.433 --> 01:09:19.914
That's helpful.

01:09:25.369 --> 01:09:30.614
So first, Michelle, thanks to you and your team for bringing this as far as it is now.

01:09:30.914 --> 01:09:41.622
And particularly, I so appreciated the update about the field trip that you took and that you're actually, you're watching it in action, you're talking, you're listening to staff.

01:09:41.662 --> 01:09:52.992
And I think we'll get, your commitment to getting it as good as we can get it and the input that you're taking and adjusting to your recommendations and to the process is just much appreciated by the field.

01:09:53.052 --> 01:09:54.073
And I think we heard from our,

01:09:55.474 --> 01:09:58.515
our public comments today that we want to continue to take the input.

01:09:58.575 --> 01:10:02.818
So just a thank you for the thoughtful, thorough way you're approaching it.

01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:10.783
I so appreciated the tiers of support that you're talking about and how you're going to assess

01:10:11.503 --> 01:10:14.307
or how your recommendations are to assess whether students are ready.

01:10:14.367 --> 01:10:16.009
I mean, we are in transition statewide.

01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:23.498
We know to computer-based much more in instruction, but there are places to have kids actually write, and I just really appreciate that.

01:10:23.979 --> 01:10:27.143
I did have a question about the Getting Smarter website that you

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:30.746
talked about and sort of what the resources are.

01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:34.027
I know that was just a few slides, and that's an additional resource.

01:10:34.087 --> 01:10:41.151
But I think helping people and parents understand what we're doing and what the resources are, I think, just would be helpful.

01:10:41.231 --> 01:10:43.332
So if you could just highlight just a few minutes on that.

01:10:47.259 --> 01:10:55.447
We know, working with our parent community, that one thing parents need is sometimes less, more targeted information.

01:10:56.227 --> 01:10:59.570
So we intentionally are not overwhelming on this site.

01:11:00.191 --> 01:11:02.333
We provide a few resources.

01:11:02.433 --> 01:11:05.616
So, for example, on LPAC, there is a document

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:17.782
that our English Learner Support Division created, and it is a document specifically for parents, and it provides them with suggestions on things they can do at home to help their students.

01:11:18.223 --> 01:11:22.145
So in terms of ELPAC, that is the support that is there.

01:11:22.765 --> 01:11:27.888
We also link to the Learning Heroes site in reference to our English Language Arts

01:11:28.528 --> 01:11:39.618
and our math, and the Learning Heroes site is developed in a way that is very accessible and parent-friendly and understandable, and that provides them with pointers.

01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:48.286
I also think the document that California PTA created for us specifically for this site really helps parents

01:11:49.908 --> 01:11:51.449
have that conversation with their teacher.

01:11:52.109 --> 01:12:00.396
They may not have known what questions to ask their teacher, but it's a very approachable document with questions about, you know, what are my students' strengths?

01:12:01.237 --> 01:12:06.521
Do these assessment results match up with what you're seeing in the classroom, or are they different, and why might that be?

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:09.764
What can I do at home with my child in the evening?

01:12:10.144 --> 01:12:16.630
So those are the kinds of questions on there, very practical, if you will, and very approachable.

01:12:18.511 --> 01:12:32.119
HCM Strategies, along with Smarter Balanced, did quite a bit of research and focus groups with this site to make sure that it was something that parents understood and found, and they wanted to go there.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:37.102
It was one of the things that when we talk to parents, they want information electronically.

01:12:37.383 --> 01:12:37.903
They really do.

01:12:37.943 --> 01:12:41.825
They want the reports electronically, and they want to click on something that gets them right there.

01:12:41.905 --> 01:12:43.606
And so we're going to be able to do that.

01:12:45.547 --> 01:12:48.388
So we look forward to continuing to look for other resources.

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:56.130
We struggle a little bit for our students with significant cognitive disabilities and struggling a little bit finding resources for parents in that particular area.

01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:05.352
But we are providing things that have already been vetted, if you will, within our department.

01:13:12.412 --> 01:13:13.072
Michelle, thank you.

01:13:14.393 --> 01:13:15.813
You and your staff have done a great job.

01:13:15.853 --> 01:13:24.316
I'm uniquely sensitive to the transition of computer adaptive assessments as I've lived it with you for, since what, 2013?

01:13:25.556 --> 01:13:27.757
And you have done an incredible job, I must say.

01:13:28.257 --> 01:13:29.297
So thank you to you and your staff.

01:13:30.097 --> 01:13:30.898
I have two questions.

01:13:30.938 --> 01:13:35.739
I greatly appreciate the last two comments from board members around the costs associated with districts.

01:13:35.799 --> 01:13:38.440
And one is related to the double scoring of consistency.

01:13:39.221 --> 01:13:45.952
In the alt ALPAC, there's a requirement of double scoring for scoring consistency.

01:13:46.032 --> 01:13:48.517
Is that requirement in the initial and summative ALPAC?

01:13:52.472 --> 01:13:52.672
No.

01:13:53.553 --> 01:14:01.578
So when we look at scoring consistency, right now we send some of the scores that are done locally.

01:14:01.618 --> 01:14:04.080
We also send to our contractor for the double scoring.

01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:07.021
And then we are providing our districts with information.

01:14:08.282 --> 01:14:11.164
The scoring consistency is extremely high.

01:14:11.244 --> 01:14:14.386
I mean, it's in the 90th percentage.

01:14:14.426 --> 01:14:17.868
But for those districts, if they need

01:14:18.909 --> 01:14:22.632
extra assistance or feedback on the scoring that they are doing.

01:14:22.652 --> 01:14:24.493
We do provide that information to them.

01:14:25.273 --> 01:14:33.579
We do, LPAC's a little different now because we do have to send it through our federal peer review, which does require that we have the scoring consistency

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:35.761
as part of what we're doing.

01:14:35.841 --> 01:14:44.790
And so we do know that some districts are providing a second score in the room and they are doing that for us, which is helpful.

01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:50.957
But we're happy to take a look at all of those things when we come back to you with the apportionment rate.

01:14:51.457 --> 01:14:52.338
Yeah, I'm glad you said that.

01:14:53.578 --> 01:15:03.404
So my understanding was that the district had to supply or had to provide a second score for scoring inconsistency, which would... For those things that you can't capture that are in the moment.

01:15:03.744 --> 01:15:03.944
Okay.

01:15:04.184 --> 01:15:04.364
Right.

01:15:04.524 --> 01:15:06.465
And so that would expand into the K-2.

01:15:07.966 --> 01:15:12.070
As you expand the k2 would it would it create or increase the requirement for that?

01:15:12.230 --> 01:15:12.770
You don't see it?

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:25.541
No because we are using For speaking we're going to use the voice capture for that And then for for writing that will be submitted in so I don't see a need to to have that okay, so

01:15:26.041 --> 01:15:26.321
Thank you.

01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:31.242
The second question was around capturing the user's voice and the feedback.

01:15:31.282 --> 01:15:38.983
Has there been any thought about how CDE might capture the user's feedback in regards to making improvements to the tool or the process?

01:15:43.264 --> 01:15:52.266
In relationship to the feedback from the users of the LPAC, those in the field, the comments is reflective of those that came to the podium and were asking for feedback.

01:15:52.728 --> 01:15:53.529
Sure.

01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:59.513
So we conduct many different surveys and feedback sessions throughout the year.

01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:00.474
Some of them are formal.

01:16:00.494 --> 01:16:01.635
Some of them are informal.

01:16:02.356 --> 01:16:07.520
For those that are more formal, we provide reports on that feedback.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:11.643
And we do that after our post-testing sessions, if you will.

01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:13.465
And we provide a document.

01:16:13.665 --> 01:16:19.930
And we post that on our website that talks about users' experience, as well as any recommendations for change.

01:16:20.370 --> 01:16:22.670
We are always looking to better ourselves.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:24.091
We are not static.

01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:27.491
My staff probably wishes we were, right?

01:16:27.551 --> 01:16:29.092
But we do act upon those things.

01:16:29.512 --> 01:16:33.893
The other thing that our contractor does is we have some informal ones.

01:16:33.953 --> 01:16:45.835
So in other words, if you agree to come to a training, we might also say, hey, we'll buy you lunch if you stay over lunch, and we're going to do an informal kind of focus group on whatever topic we need to get feedback on at the moment.

01:16:46.635 --> 01:17:00.124
We are always looking for those kinds of ways to get that feedback, and we do act upon them, as well as having our organizations that work with me on a monthly basis for our stakeholder meeting.

01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:03.747
Those include not only those organizations that came up today,

01:17:04.567 --> 01:17:17.017
but SELPA, AXA, AXI, and many other acronyms that I can't think of at the moment, but those are also opportunities for them to give us feedback.

01:17:17.178 --> 01:17:22.622
So I believe that we already have many avenues in place to receive that.

01:17:27.524 --> 01:17:30.445
Michelle, I wanted to go back to this resource here for parents.

01:17:31.086 --> 01:17:41.410
So do we have any, in this website, will there be a section for parents who have their students in DI programs and the students are taking the SBAC?

01:17:41.770 --> 01:17:47.073
And I ask because, as you know, my children and my son is a first timer SBACer.

01:17:47.093 --> 01:17:51.735
So he's taking the SBAC and I told him, I said, you cannot answer in Spanish.

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:57.401
And he said, that makes no sense, mom, because he's in a program where 80% of his day is in Spanish.

01:17:58.121 --> 01:18:01.165
And so for him, he did not know that, right?

01:18:01.225 --> 01:18:05.590
And I said, and a lot of the parents of the school are saying, well, there is a Spanish section.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:07.051
I said, not in this test.

01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:13.418
So there's a lot of confusion about what the SBAC is actually testing when you're in a DI program.

01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:25.064
And then we mentioned, you know, there's, we know that there's an optional California Spanish assessment, but some sites also use Apprenda and, which is not aligned to Common Core in Espanol.

01:18:25.124 --> 01:18:28.845
And so I don't really know why we would have that as an option to be used.

01:18:29.645 --> 01:18:32.046
We wouldn't tell the school you could use SBAC or STAR, right?

01:18:32.867 --> 01:18:42.951
So I think that there has to be a portion where is designed for DI schools so that parents really know what is the SBAC and if your student is in a,

01:18:43.491 --> 01:18:53.338
Spanish-speaking program, what are some optional assessments that he or she may be also taking during this window of time?

01:18:53.418 --> 01:18:55.820
Because I think there is some confusion out with parents.

01:18:58.021 --> 01:19:03.925
One thing to clarify, you can answer in Spanish if you are on the writing, I mean on the math, sorry, not writing.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:08.328
But in the mathematics section, we do have Spanish scores.

01:19:08.868 --> 01:19:11.610
So just to clarify that that is acceptable.

01:19:14.825 --> 01:19:17.008
It's good information for you to provide us.

01:19:17.088 --> 01:19:24.538
We'll go back and have a conversation about is this the right website and what is the information we would provide.

01:19:25.139 --> 01:19:28.463
I do want to let you know of a study that our contractor is doing.

01:19:29.304 --> 01:19:30.446
It's looking at

01:19:32.228 --> 01:19:48.252
What resources might our examiners, our schools, our districts need when they are provided results on both of our Spanish assessment as well as our English language arts assessment and they are offering a dual immersion program, right?

01:19:48.452 --> 01:19:50.272
What is it about those assessments?

01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:51.572
How might they analyze them?

01:19:51.892 --> 01:19:53.553
Do they have the resources to do so?

01:19:53.613 --> 01:19:58.454
What are the questions that they might want to ask about their local programs when they have that information?

01:19:59.054 --> 01:20:09.318
So we've asked our contractor to start on that and they've started that study now and we'll be happy to bring that back or provide that in a memo once we've finalized that.

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:11.579
But I think that will also address your need.

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:22.003
I've got Patricia next in the queue and then if you could put the motion up that we're going to be considering because we may want to get to that relatively soon.

01:20:22.683 --> 01:20:23.964
Thank you, Patricia.

01:20:23.984 --> 01:20:29.568
Okay, so Michelle, I absolutely want to thank you and your staff for the work that you do.

01:20:30.068 --> 01:20:36.833
You always come to this board meeting for this agenda item with a very comprehensive and very expansive

01:20:37.513 --> 01:20:39.895
collection of information to share with us.

01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:42.437
And so I want to thank you for that.

01:20:42.457 --> 01:20:56.127
I have been on this board from the time that we started overhauling and putting in the trash heap our previous assessment and accountability system and started building this one.

01:20:56.767 --> 01:21:14.766
The five pillars of the work that has been characterized not only by the conversation you have guided us through, but on the decisions we've been tasked to make have been about funding, the appropriations and those things you talked to us about, the culture and the purpose of our assessment system,

01:21:15.226 --> 01:21:23.110
the architecture and the infrastructure of the assessment system, and what it would take to norm what our conversations look like.

01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:37.056
And so, what we're faced with on the decision we're asked to make today on the LPAC really takes a look at where we have gained some traction in all of the previous work that occurred.

01:21:37.656 --> 01:21:42.879
With board member Ortiz-Lacon's question concerning how students can respond,

01:21:43.719 --> 01:21:49.686
I was sitting in this seat on the day this board adopted the SBAC.

01:21:50.567 --> 01:21:56.553
Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond was standing at that podium with the SBAC contractors.

01:21:57.294 --> 01:22:00.397
And Eileen Strauss was also on this board.

01:22:00.737 --> 01:22:03.640
And at the time, Sue Burr was the executive director.

01:22:04.522 --> 01:22:07.985
We had two alternatives in front of us at the time.

01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:24.097
And one of the pivotal questions that I asked both vendors was about the option and the ability of providing an assessment where students would be able to use primary language, either as part of the assessment and as part of the response.

01:22:24.877 --> 01:22:27.499
One vendor said, no, that would never be an option.

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:33.643
The other vendor said, yes, that's something that they were contemplating and that could be down the road.

01:22:34.204 --> 01:22:45.270
And for that reason, that was the reason for that response that I was able to support the recommendation to adopt the SBAC assessment system.

01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:47.952
And it's important to say that it was a system.

01:22:48.372 --> 01:22:52.795
So there's always been some intentionality to look at primary language assessment

01:22:53.135 --> 01:23:06.599
There's always been an idea about ways to create particular accommodations for students to be able to participate in that assessment using their primary language as an accessibility tool.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:17.443
So, we have this conversation that's continuing and clearly as you're seeing in the work that's happening and making the decision about LPAC, this is not an area we have gained some traction on.

01:23:18.323 --> 01:23:28.507
There are some issues about local practice with all five of those pillars that come into question as well about the decision we're about to make concerning adopting the LPAC.

01:23:29.108 --> 01:23:31.689
There is the issue about the accessibility tools.

01:23:32.169 --> 01:23:41.093
Whether we're talking about the LPAC or the regular SBAC assessment, the issue of accessibility and the use of those tools is an issue.

01:23:42.113 --> 01:23:51.562
We still have districts telling educators that if you recommend the use of accessibility tools, it changes the type of information that's reported about students.

01:23:51.582 --> 01:23:58.829
And they're erroneously making that statement and purposely choosing not to make accessibility tools available to all students.

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:14.879
So the issue about accessibility tools for the LPAC becomes even more important, not because of whether or not districts choose to make them available, but the second issue on accessibility tools is, are teachers and students being taught how to use them and what they are?

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:18.382
And the answer of many local practices is no.

01:24:18.882 --> 01:24:26.887
I've sat in classrooms and watched students do the test and they don't know how to do something as simple as get the dictionary or for 11th grade students.

01:24:26.927 --> 01:24:29.049
And you know, this has been an issue on the calculator.

01:24:29.449 --> 01:24:33.330
figure out how to find and then use the calculator on the 11th grade assessment.

01:24:34.570 --> 01:24:49.134
So then the things that we're trying to fix here with ways to create not only accessibility but create specific accommodations for the different types of users on whether it's expanding the grade levels that use the paper and pencil assessment

01:24:49.694 --> 01:25:00.583
or if we're going to look at what the tiers of supports are or the conversations with teachers, what the stakeholders are saying about what's happening with local practices are very important.

01:25:01.204 --> 01:25:12.733
I'm going to support this, the recommendation from staff today, but I'm going to trust with everything that you've talked about concerning the refinements and improvements that the staff continues to make.

01:25:13.253 --> 01:25:17.377
These are the reasons why we are still not gaining the kind of traction

01:25:17.777 --> 01:25:35.132
in appropriate local practices and the culture of assessment and why we have locals still hanging on to their old 20th century thinking, not only about assessment practices, but what the purpose of assessment and the role in supporting the conversation on continuous improvement should be.

01:25:35.632 --> 01:25:43.679
That's the culture we have embraced, but because we're still using an assessment, people are still hanging on to these very old ideas.

01:25:44.119 --> 01:25:52.305
So the conversations and the issues that are being raised about the LPAC today, those are not conversations isolated just to the LPAC.

01:25:52.725 --> 01:26:04.894
These are some of our continuing issues and some of our continuing problems, not because there isn't clear consensus at this dais about what we're trying to do and what those five pillars are,

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:18.507
But because when it trickles down to what local practice looks like, we're not seeing that same uniformity or consensus of purpose on what we're attempting to do with implementing each of these new assessment phases.

01:26:18.527 --> 01:26:21.509
So I think we have to be aware of and think that through.

01:26:21.549 --> 01:26:24.092
But I, again, want to tell you I'm a fan.

01:26:24.652 --> 01:26:45.981
But in preparation for the July-ish item on the accessibility tools, one of the most important data pieces that I would like to see is a report on usage and what's being reported because I still suspect it's lower than it should be and it's still not and there's not going to be a great deal of variation given all the types of tools that students have available to them.

01:26:46.141 --> 01:26:53.344
I don't believe the general population is being allowed to use them in the ways that we're hoping could be useful and would address some of the concerns.

01:26:53.644 --> 01:26:56.026
that board member Ortiz-Lacombe has raised as well.

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:57.027
Thank you.

01:26:58.988 --> 01:26:59.529
Okay.

01:27:00.029 --> 01:27:09.076
With that statement and seeing no other hands up, I think we are ready to look at the motion which is before us.

01:27:09.817 --> 01:27:14.460
CDE recommends that the California State Board of Education approve the following proposed items.

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.442
Test design recommendations.

01:27:17.002 --> 01:27:21.085
Test design recommendations as described in section 1F as well as 1G.

01:27:22.186 --> 01:27:26.147
general performance level descriptors, revised summative LPAC blueprints.

01:27:26.948 --> 01:27:33.690
The CDE further recommends that SBE authorize CDE staff to make technical edits as necessary to the documents listed above.

01:27:33.710 --> 01:27:44.393
I think we all recognize that this motion comes with the understanding that there will be these studies and pilots and

01:27:45.473 --> 01:27:52.796
We'll get a very full report with the opportunity to refine and continue to revise in July based on what we learned this year.

01:27:53.496 --> 01:27:55.576
So, with all of that, do I have a motion?

01:27:57.477 --> 01:27:59.018
I will move staff's recommendation.

01:27:59.278 --> 01:27:59.878
Thank you.

01:28:00.258 --> 01:28:00.778
Board Member Sun?

01:28:00.798 --> 01:28:01.118
I second.

01:28:01.899 --> 01:28:03.379
Second from Board Member Rucker.

01:28:04.359 --> 01:28:05.260
Any other discussion?

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.080
All in favor, say aye.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:07.160
Aye.

01:28:08.101 --> 01:28:09.121
Any opposed, say nay.

01:28:10.061 --> 01:28:10.862
Any abstentions?

01:28:11.362 --> 01:28:13.402
We are good to go.

01:28:13.503 --> 01:28:14.703
Thank you very much, Michelle.

01:28:16.358 --> 01:28:23.552
And with that, we're going to take some time with our State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

01:28:23.592 --> 01:28:24.533
Tony Thurmond is here.

01:28:24.553 --> 01:28:25.154
We're delighted.

01:28:25.756 --> 01:28:27.419
And we're ready for your report.

01:28:28.388 --> 01:28:29.329
Thank you, Madam President.

01:28:29.889 --> 01:28:33.851
And I assure you there'll be a break after Tony speaks, just in case people are wondering.

01:28:33.891 --> 01:28:36.532
I'll only be about 45 minutes and then we'll take a break.

01:28:37.793 --> 01:28:44.037
We will keep it brief, Madam President, Madam Vice President, members of the board, to those who are here.

01:28:45.077 --> 01:28:49.960
On behalf of our deputy superintendent, our chief deputy, our deputies,

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:57.784
Our directors, our 1,500 staff in this building, I bring you this report in greetings and welcome.

01:28:58.645 --> 01:29:00.966
To our new board members, I want to welcome you.

01:29:01.686 --> 01:29:03.167
You joined a great board.

01:29:03.788 --> 01:29:05.248
I promise you, you will never be bored.

01:29:06.749 --> 01:29:17.676
In five months here, I can tell you it's always riveting and interesting, but it is really a great opportunity to serve students in some of the best ways.

01:29:18.516 --> 01:29:20.838
You know a board member Patil Brownson.

01:29:20.878 --> 01:29:21.739
It's great to have you here.

01:29:21.779 --> 01:29:28.065
We've worked together on early education stuff your expertise I think will be valuable to much of the work that we do here.

01:29:28.465 --> 01:29:37.032
I know that we share work together through the Andy E Casey Children and Families Foundations

01:29:38.233 --> 01:29:40.996
fellowship and it's great to be able to work with you in this capacity.

01:29:41.817 --> 01:29:53.888
Board Member Nava, your reputation precedes you as a teacher, as an administrator, as a champion in special education that you get these issues and we look forward to your work here on this board.

01:29:55.209 --> 01:30:02.556
We've been busy and want to share with you some of the things that we're doing that we think align with where the conversation

01:30:03.176 --> 01:30:03.456
going.

01:30:03.617 --> 01:30:23.090
For example, the robust conversation that we just had on assessment and just this week the department hosted a conversation about assessment as it relates to college predictability and all the controversy around which measures are the best measures for how you prepare success in college.

01:30:23.530 --> 01:30:26.532
Now we firmly believe that our students are more than a test score.

01:30:27.192 --> 01:30:35.638
But we think that if our students are being assessed that there should be considerations around equity and thought given to what is the best way to do that.

01:30:35.758 --> 01:30:47.286
And so we brought some of the greatest researchers in our state to share their research and their data about which measures have what benefit, where there needs to be an improvement.

01:30:47.386 --> 01:30:56.532
And we have a work group that our assessment team and others will be helping to follow up that we think will point to some very clear policy recommendations

01:30:56.992 --> 01:30:57.632
going forward.

01:30:58.433 --> 01:31:03.994
As you know, we've made our conversation about closing the achievement gap an ongoing conversation.

01:31:04.514 --> 01:31:06.715
We do not want that to be a one and done conversation.

01:31:06.775 --> 01:31:09.956
We don't want that to be something that happens in one month out of the year.

01:31:10.696 --> 01:31:13.937
We are taking that on as one of our top priorities.

01:31:14.217 --> 01:31:25.761
And in that respect, we've also hosted a roundtable that talks about how we build a pipeline that brings male educators of color to elementary school.

01:31:27.041 --> 01:31:42.106
And as a result of that group, we are now working with a number of foundations, with other folks in government and education, to look at how we can bring more African American, Latino, API, and others who will be teachers in elementary school working with our students.

01:31:42.586 --> 01:31:49.188
We know that when students see someone who looks like them, research has shown, that has a tremendous benefit as it relates to closing the gap.

01:31:49.668 --> 01:31:56.636
We know that students, regardless of their background, when they see diverse educators, everyone benefits.

01:31:56.676 --> 01:31:59.479
And so we've made this a top priority for us.

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:04.065
We have laid the foundation for what we hope will become

01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:06.346
a statewide literacy campaign.

01:32:07.087 --> 01:32:11.610
We believe that there are many opportunities for us to support our students.

01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:18.435
I hear this phrase from colleagues all the time that when our students learn to read, they read to learn at every level.

01:32:19.115 --> 01:32:24.258
We're interested in what we do to make sure that kids can read by third grade.

01:32:24.619 --> 01:32:30.763
We're very interested in what we do around intervention for our older students who continue to struggle in their literacy goals.

01:32:30.823 --> 01:32:33.545
And so we have much that we want to report to you.

01:32:34.085 --> 01:32:44.302
We have a dozen bills, including one bill that calls for greater professional development to support educators around literacy, around pedagogy, around how to support our students.

01:32:45.255 --> 01:32:59.105
We have been very actively leading the conversation with the governor's statewide task force on charter reform and anticipate some recommendations that will be coming forward very soon.

01:33:00.005 --> 01:33:06.190
As I mentioned, this is an exciting time and I think the next two days will be very exciting.

01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:13.036
And to those who are joining us today for public comment or to observe, we welcome you.

01:33:13.497 --> 01:33:17.781
We think that the conversation is riveting and we think that all perspectives are welcome.

01:33:18.522 --> 01:33:22.926
We think diversity of ideas is good and that it is okay when we disagree.

01:33:23.647 --> 01:33:28.352
In my humble opinion, it's okay to disagree, but not to be disagreeable.

01:33:28.931 --> 01:33:37.620
And in my experience and in our experience, we have found that these meetings go the best when everyone is given an opportunity to speak regardless of their perspective.

01:33:38.101 --> 01:33:44.768
And so we ask that if you're here today for the first time, that you adhere to the guidelines set by our president and the board.

01:33:45.368 --> 01:33:46.268
around time limits.

01:33:46.889 --> 01:33:56.171
And if there's something that you really feel you didn't get to say or you're not happy with something that comes up in the presentation, please let any of our staff or myself know.

01:33:56.631 --> 01:33:58.992
We will be happy to work with you going forward.

01:33:59.032 --> 01:33:59.892
So welcome to the meeting.

01:34:00.293 --> 01:34:01.613
We look forward to a great two days.

01:34:02.293 --> 01:34:03.614
And this submits my report.

01:34:04.374 --> 01:34:04.814
Terrific.

01:34:04.874 --> 01:34:05.834
Thank you very much.

01:34:06.554 --> 01:34:08.175
And we'll take a 10 minute break.

01:34:08.655 --> 01:34:10.096
See you back here around 1015.

01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:15.544
Okay.

01:34:20.188 --> 01:34:25.774
We have a lot to do this morning, so I want to be sure that we can get going again.

01:34:25.794 --> 01:34:28.998
Thank you.

01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:45.969
We are going to take up item two, approval of the California State Transition Plan for Strengthening Career and Technical Education for 21st Century Act.

01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:54.796
And I'm going to ask Russ Weichel to come to the podium to present for CDE.

01:35:03.689 --> 01:35:09.634
Oh yeah, before you start, can we quickly do a mic check around the semicircle here?

01:35:09.694 --> 01:35:13.677
And I'm going to start with Pat because there's a concern that not all the mics are working.

01:35:13.737 --> 01:35:16.519
Meanwhile, you can figure out how to get your work mic working also.

01:35:16.839 --> 01:35:19.782
Just say testing or hello or something into your mic.

01:35:20.442 --> 01:35:20.983
Hello.

01:35:25.026 --> 01:35:25.946
It was turned on.

01:35:25.966 --> 01:35:26.107
Hello.

01:35:31.052 --> 01:35:32.013
Hola, buenos dias.

01:35:33.334 --> 01:35:34.435
Mic check, mic check.

01:35:35.276 --> 01:35:35.596
Hello?

01:35:36.677 --> 01:35:37.137
Can you hear mine?

01:35:37.638 --> 01:35:37.958
Hello?

01:35:37.978 --> 01:35:40.040
I think mine is working.

01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:44.103
Microphone check, one, two, one, two.

01:35:46.005 --> 01:35:46.565
Good morning.

01:35:50.248 --> 01:35:50.649
Good morning.

01:35:52.490 --> 01:35:53.952
Microphone check, microphone check.

01:35:56.974 --> 01:35:57.495
Check, check.

01:36:06.144 --> 01:36:07.124
Testing on this mic.

01:36:07.505 --> 01:36:08.325
We are good here?

01:36:09.025 --> 01:36:09.405
Test.

01:36:09.806 --> 01:36:10.186
Excellent.

01:36:10.606 --> 01:36:10.706
Good?

01:36:10.726 --> 01:36:10.946
Okay.

01:36:11.366 --> 01:36:12.607
Great.

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:16.668
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond, board members, and Superintendent Thurmond.

01:36:17.088 --> 01:36:17.789
I'm Pete Kalas.

01:36:17.849 --> 01:36:21.170
I'm the administrator in the Career and College Transition Division.

01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:23.791
I'm here to present this item.

01:36:24.251 --> 01:36:26.612
The item is an action item.

01:36:26.632 --> 01:36:28.933
The department is requesting board approval of the 2019-20

01:36:30.939 --> 01:36:37.681
California State Transition Plan for Perkins V, Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century.

01:36:38.341 --> 01:36:41.181
Russ Weichel is also here with me for the presentation.

01:36:41.601 --> 01:36:52.724
He came in and assisted our division in finishing up the transition plan and looking forward to what we have to do in the next year to complete our Perkins V plan.

01:36:53.604 --> 01:37:03.276
Also included in this item is the request to extend the waiver of section 132 funds distribution formula of this transition plan, which deals with adult ed.

01:37:04.981 --> 01:37:32.887
The Federal Perkins Improvement Act of 2016, known as Perkins IV, was reauthorized July 31, 2018, and then renamed to the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for 21st Century Act, which is now known as Perkins V. As part of the transition to Perkins V and to qualify for federal funding going forward under Perkins V, California must submit a new state plan for career technical education.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:34.580
The U.S.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:38.662
Department of Education gave us two options for completing the state plan.

01:37:39.262 --> 01:37:49.246
Option one is for the state to submit a transition plan for the 19-20 year followed by the submission of a full state plan starting in 2021 year.

01:37:49.386 --> 01:37:53.028
Option two was for the state to submit a full plan for 2019 through 2024.

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:56.369
California is elected to submit a one-year transition plan

01:38:04.838 --> 01:38:08.639
due in May 2019 with the full state plan due in April of 2020.

01:38:09.059 --> 01:38:28.363
The 19-20 transition plan was developed in collaboration with CDE staff, California Community College Chancellor's Office Board of Governors and their staff, and State Board of Education members along with SBE staff, office staff, via the Career Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Council.

01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:35.214
The Advisory Council had monthly meetings where they had the opportunity to review several drafts of the transition plan.

01:38:36.255 --> 01:38:41.459
The Advisory Council also received and reviewed public comment regarding the transition plan.

01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:52.568
We also received some very wise guidance from this gentleman standing next to me, Russ Weichel, who's our retired Career and College Transition Division Director from two years ago.

01:38:53.449 --> 01:38:57.872
The transition plan will move the state from Perkins four to five with the planning year of 1920.

01:39:00.606 --> 01:39:05.411
The State Board of Education has received two memos regarding the state transition plan.

01:39:05.451 --> 01:39:12.638
The first memo was in August of 2018, and it included a side-by-side comparison of Perkins 4 and Perkins 5.

01:39:13.939 --> 01:39:19.925
The second memo, April of this year, 2019, included an update on the progress of the transition plan.

01:39:20.706 --> 01:39:24.350
The attachment in this item is the full state plan document

01:39:25.205 --> 01:39:28.727
that with all the questions need to be completed during the planning year.

01:39:28.847 --> 01:39:33.029
So some of the questions that we needed to complete for the transition year were completed.

01:39:33.469 --> 01:39:37.190
Some questions were left blank because they were not needed for the transition plan.

01:39:39.011 --> 01:39:40.772
The transition plan is due to the U.S.

01:39:40.792 --> 01:39:43.293
Department of Education by May 24th, 2019.

01:39:43.733 --> 01:39:47.975
Any questions?

01:39:48.355 --> 01:39:51.457
And Russ is here to provide updates on

01:39:52.262 --> 01:39:56.724
the work that was done with the Joint Advisory Committee and the transition plan.

01:40:00.905 --> 01:40:01.925
Did you want to add?

01:40:02.185 --> 01:40:02.425
Sure.

01:40:02.646 --> 01:40:03.106
Thank you.

01:40:03.506 --> 01:40:03.946
Good morning.

01:40:04.886 --> 01:40:05.486
Russ Weichel.

01:40:05.607 --> 01:40:09.308
I'm the former Division Director for Career and College Transition Division.

01:40:10.008 --> 01:40:13.849
But my career at CDE really began in the year 2002.

01:40:15.290 --> 01:40:21.052
And I started working as a consultant with the Carl Perkins Act at that time, which at that time was Perkins II.

01:40:22.853 --> 01:40:33.702
Or Perkins three rather and then we transitioned I was here and one of the primary writers on the full plan for Perkins four and now I've failed retirement and

01:40:34.644 --> 01:40:40.067
and come back as a retired annuitant to work on the transition plan for Perkins 5.

01:40:41.128 --> 01:40:48.572
So Perkins 5 or Perkins 4 was actually reauthorized this last July of 2018.

01:40:49.273 --> 01:40:54.836
It was renamed the Strengthening Career and Technical Education Act for the 21st century.

01:40:55.296 --> 01:41:00.079
But they keep Carl Perkins name in there and they call it Perkins 5 for short.

01:41:01.653 --> 01:41:07.418
But as Pete said, as part of the reauthorization of the Act, states actually have two options.

01:41:07.518 --> 01:41:13.482
They can submit a full four-year plan that begins really this next year and goes through 2024.

01:41:14.123 --> 01:41:19.627
Or they also have the option of submitting a transitional plan for the single year 2019 through 2020.

01:41:22.202 --> 01:41:26.363
and then a brand new four-year plan beginning 2020 through 2024.

01:41:28.223 --> 01:41:33.464
California, as most states, has elected to submit a transitional plan for that one year.

01:41:34.185 --> 01:41:42.926
Transitional plan uses the same guidance that is used for the full plan, as Pete described.

01:41:43.366 --> 01:41:50.388
There are some, and we wrote this plan using all the questions that are required for the full plan.

01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:58.394
And as you look through this plan, you'll notice that some of the questions said this response is not required in this transitional year.

01:41:58.975 --> 01:42:03.518
But we wanted the board and the public to see what's required for our full four-year plan.

01:42:04.439 --> 01:42:04.539
And

01:42:07.549 --> 01:42:10.370
And then we're only required to answer certain sections of that.

01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:16.092
California receives approximately $130 million for Carl Perkins funds.

01:42:16.772 --> 01:42:20.313
Those funds are used for secondary and post-secondary education.

01:42:22.573 --> 01:42:30.976
California Department of Education is a primary agency responsible for those funds, but we do share those funds with community colleges.

01:42:32.236 --> 01:42:40.380
both administrative funds, leadership funds, and what we call local assistance funds or funds that are sent to local agencies.

01:42:43.782 --> 01:42:56.008
The way that works is about 5% of the money can be used for administering the Perkins funds, 10% for leadership activities, but 85% of the funds must be used with local agencies.

01:42:57.528 --> 01:43:12.040
One thing we're also asking for in this transition plan is you approve or notifying you that we're submitting a waiver to the federal government for the distribution of 132 funds.

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:17.045
132 is the section of the Perkins Act that defines the use of post-secondary funds.

01:43:18.185 --> 01:43:25.271
In the federal act, it actually describes how those funds are to be distributed by states.

01:43:26.432 --> 01:43:36.160
And the Act defines that as being distributed through Pell Grant recipients, the number of Pell Grant recipients served by those agencies.

01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:38.462
California learned a long time ago

01:43:39.344 --> 01:43:56.859
that if we use that distribution formula as described in the Act, we have an unequitable distribution of funds throughout our states, particularly in adult ed, where most adult ed agencies don't have Pell Grant recipients or have very few Pell Grant recipients.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:00.622
So we have applied for a waiver since Perkins II

01:44:02.259 --> 01:44:11.867
to allow us to distribute the funds based on prior year enrollment of economically disadvantaged adults in career technical education.

01:44:12.388 --> 01:44:21.756
So we collect data from both adult ed here at CDE and adult and the post-secondary enrollments at community colleges.

01:44:22.136 --> 01:44:28.681
And each year that number fluctuates a little bit based on each agency's proportional share of that enrollment.

01:44:29.762 --> 01:44:30.503
We do have

01:44:31.587 --> 01:44:37.892
within our agreement, our MOU with the community colleges, we have a 3% hold harmless agreement.

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:47.659
So if one agency's or the other's enrollment either goes down or goes up quite a bit, then the other agency isn't hurt by that inequity.

01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:55.425
So we still believe that using economically disadvantaged enrollments in our programs is a

01:44:57.817 --> 01:45:01.220
fairer way to distribute the money rather than based on Pell Grants.

01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:02.762
So that's what that waiver is about.

01:45:03.743 --> 01:45:06.325
So we're just asking for your approval on the transition plan.

01:45:13.162 --> 01:45:14.183
as our liaison.

01:45:14.203 --> 01:45:15.244
Thank you.

01:45:15.284 --> 01:45:24.991
So, first of all, thank you, Russ, for coming in and stepping up and working on this transition plan for us during a time of transition in the CDE staff.

01:45:25.631 --> 01:45:30.515
And so what I want to say is, as Russ has said, this is a one-year plan.

01:45:30.775 --> 01:45:38.380
And so because it is a one-year plan and the year is almost over, you're not going to see a lot of changes.

01:45:39.141 --> 01:45:41.563
But what we are looking at doing for the

01:45:42.123 --> 01:45:59.806
full plan for 2024 is to incorporate a lot of what the recommendations from our Workforce Advisory Committee has provided in helping to shape CTE, sorry, workforce pathways and making it more consistent across K-14.

01:46:01.167 --> 01:46:11.214
So we're hoping we will be starting immediately on that the full plan after the passage of or the approval of this one year transition plan.

01:46:11.374 --> 01:46:19.700
And again, you'll be seeing some, I think, broader and more changes than you will see in this current transition plan.

01:46:20.621 --> 01:46:20.861
Great.

01:46:21.731 --> 01:46:27.095
So I think we want to see if there's any public comment and then we'll have a fuller discussion There's no public comment for this.

01:46:27.255 --> 01:46:48.430
All right, we can have a fuller discussion So are there any other comments or questions from members of the board All right a little bit of wait time Seeing none Do you have a motion that we want to?

01:46:49.011 --> 01:46:50.772
Restate for the board or is this?

01:46:57.970 --> 01:47:03.014
Move the staff's recommendation to approve the transition plan.

01:47:06.829 --> 01:47:07.209
All right.

01:47:08.290 --> 01:47:09.831
Any further discussion?

01:47:10.331 --> 01:47:14.673
Actually, the motion as it is written here, I'll just read the whole thing.

01:47:15.073 --> 01:47:26.699
Approve CDE staff recommendation, make any additional edits as deemed necessary, and authorize CDE and SBE staff to submit the Perkins V transition plan to the Federal Department of Education by May 24th.

01:47:26.719 --> 01:47:26.799
Yes.

01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.821
Thank you.

01:47:31.041 --> 01:47:31.702
Did you move it?

01:47:32.222 --> 01:47:32.743
Yes, I did.

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:37.946
Okay, so moved by Ting and seconded by Patricia Rucker.

01:47:38.506 --> 01:47:39.607
Any further discussion?

01:47:40.147 --> 01:47:41.248
All in favor say aye.

01:47:41.268 --> 01:47:41.328
Aye.

01:47:42.069 --> 01:47:42.769
All opposed?

01:47:43.389 --> 01:47:44.310
Any abstentions?

01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:45.611
Motion carries.

01:47:45.971 --> 01:47:46.872
Very efficient.

01:47:46.932 --> 01:47:47.872
Thank you very much.

01:47:49.453 --> 01:47:55.818
And we're going to go on to item three, which is the approval of the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan.

01:47:56.898 --> 01:48:02.621
And we will hear from Barbara Murchison about the plan.

01:48:18.828 --> 01:48:19.108
All right.

01:48:19.128 --> 01:48:19.988
Good morning, everyone.

01:48:20.388 --> 01:48:22.209
Morning, President Darling-Hammond.

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:23.330
That has quite a ring to it.

01:48:25.445 --> 01:48:27.948
Superintendent Thurman, also a great ring to that one.

01:48:28.909 --> 01:48:34.515
And board members, I'm Barbara Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division here at the Department of Education.

01:48:35.496 --> 01:48:41.944
This morning, my colleagues and I will present to you the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan, or CSIP.

01:48:44.827 --> 01:48:46.128
This is an action item.

01:48:47.088 --> 01:48:50.529
The CDE recommends that the board approve the CSIP today.

01:48:51.510 --> 01:49:03.935
So California Education Code requires the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop and the State Board of Education to consider adopting a computer science strategic implementation plan on or before July 15, 2019.

01:49:06.596 --> 01:49:16.243
Code also requires the superintendent to convene a computer science strategic implementation advisory panel to develop recommendations to inform the plan.

01:49:17.964 --> 01:49:22.206
The statute, which is relatively detailed, calls for a two-part process.

01:49:22.907 --> 01:49:30.072
First, the development of recommendations by an appointed panel, and then the development of a plan based on those recommendations.

01:49:32.233 --> 01:50:01.685
To review, statute required the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan panel to develop a set of recommendations for a computer science strategic implementation plan that addresses at minimum the following topics, broadening the pool of teachers to teach computer science, defining computer science education principles that meet the needs of pupils in kindergarten and grades one through 12 inclusive, ensuring that all pupils have access to quality computer science courses

01:50:03.888 --> 01:50:15.736
The 23 panel members were appointed by the governor, the board president, Senate Committee on Rules, Speaker of the Assembly, and the superintendent, and were selected based on their expertise in computer science education.

01:50:17.277 --> 01:50:26.304
Once the panel was appointed, the CDE convened three two-day public meetings of the panel here in Sacramento in March, April, and June of last year.

01:50:27.614 --> 01:50:39.884
To inform the work of the panel, the CDE invited experts to provide presentations on various topics, including sessions on the draft computer science standards and the status of credentialing requirements for computer science educators.

01:50:40.665 --> 01:50:47.290
These were public meetings, and the CDE and CSIP provided opportunities on each meeting day for public comment.

01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:54.436
The CDE presented the panel's final recommendations to you as an information item in September 2018.

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:07.970
Also in September 2018, the CDE presented to the Instructional Quality Commission a draft plan based on the recommendations of the panel.

01:51:08.511 --> 01:51:17.260
The IQC recommended that the plan be put out for a 30-day public review and comment period, which took place in October and November last year.

01:51:18.513 --> 01:51:24.235
The plan was posted from October 1st, 2018 through November 9th, 2018.

01:51:25.616 --> 01:51:32.999
Much of the comment requested that we update data and statistics in the plan and to be more explicit around our computer science definition.

01:51:33.999 --> 01:51:42.443
We analyzed all of those public comments and made recommendations to the IQC regarding appropriate revisions to the plan at its meeting in January 2019.

01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:51.794
At that time, the IQC analyzed public comments and unanimously approved all of the CDE's proposed revisions.

01:51:52.514 --> 01:51:58.137
All of those revisions were incorporated into the document that I presented to you all in March.

01:52:02.039 --> 01:52:10.243
So when we presented the draft plan to the board for potential adoption in March, we heard loudly and clearly concerns regarding unfunded mandates.

01:52:12.515 --> 01:52:16.157
After the meeting, I know I just caught Member Burr out of the corner of my eye.

01:52:16.177 --> 01:52:19.579
She's very good at reminding me about unfunded mandates.

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:24.842
After the meeting, we have a long history of unfunded mandates together.

01:52:25.902 --> 01:52:35.247
After the meeting, we revised the document, streamlined it, and removed any language that could be misinterpreted as a mandate of any kind.

01:52:35.307 --> 01:52:38.608
There are no shalls, shoulds, must, wills.

01:52:39.849 --> 01:52:50.434
As with all state board adopted standards, however, it is really important that we all just recognize that it's going to take very many years to implement computer science standards.

01:52:51.174 --> 01:52:54.396
It is my understanding that the board will not be adopting

01:52:54.976 --> 01:53:13.265
A curriculum framework for computer science or adopting instructional materials for computer science and districts and policy makers will really need the implementation guidance provided in this plan to further implementation of the standards that the board adopted last September.

01:53:14.445 --> 01:53:17.727
So we have this set of standards that you all adopted in September of 2018.

01:53:18.187 --> 01:53:22.589
And to date, we don't really have implementation guidance for those standards.

01:53:23.010 --> 01:53:26.371
And we will not be bringing you curriculum frameworks or instructional materials.

01:53:26.491 --> 01:53:37.377
So the plan is really important for districts and also policymakers to be able to think about as they're working to advance equitable computer science education here in California.

01:53:38.922 --> 01:53:53.485
So even though the document does not require LEAs, local educational agencies, to do anything in particular, we believe that the guidance developed by those computer science experts over the course of those months last spring is really important.

01:53:53.625 --> 01:54:04.127
And we think districts are really seeking the type of information that is in this plan, as well as a signal from the State Board of Education that furthering computer science education is important.

01:54:05.307 --> 01:54:06.207
California's vision

01:54:08.194 --> 01:54:16.703
is to ensure that all students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science to prepare them for college, career, and civic engagement.

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:26.873
So much more information regarding the development of the plan, the recommendations developed by the panel,

01:54:27.810 --> 01:54:37.496
the composition of the panel, all kinds of information, and a brand new computer science resources webpage, which has lots of great resources for folks.

01:54:38.177 --> 01:54:43.140
The panel and part of their work, they pulled together a set of resources that they thought were really important.

01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:52.947
We thought those would be more appropriately housed on a webpage, which is a much more fluid, flexible way of communicating than in a plan, because we don't really like to update plans very often.

01:54:53.027 --> 01:54:55.929
So we've built out a webpage full of great resources.

01:54:56.329 --> 01:54:57.670
You can link to all of that

01:54:58.150 --> 01:55:00.891
at the webpage on this screen.

01:55:03.553 --> 01:55:16.459
So again, as we state in the plan, California's vision is to ensure that all students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science to prepare them for college, career, and civic engagement.

01:55:17.119 --> 01:55:21.541
In the revised draft before you today, equity is front and center.

01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:25.823
I've invited to join me today at the podium

01:55:26.443 --> 01:55:45.924
three computer science experts, although they'd probably go, please don't call us that, but they are experts, to share with you information about the importance of this document and how it will help the field moving forward in ensuring that each one of our kids, all California students, has access to quality

01:55:46.745 --> 01:55:48.006
computer science education.

01:55:48.447 --> 01:55:50.669
So first, we'll have Dr. Julie Flappin.

01:55:51.370 --> 01:55:55.173
She's the Executive Director of ACCESS at UCLA CenterX.

01:55:55.774 --> 01:56:00.738
ACCESS is the Alliance for California Computing Education for Students and Schools.

01:56:01.299 --> 01:56:06.003
The mission of ACCESS is to advocate for equitable access to high quality computer science education

01:56:06.543 --> 01:56:17.151
for all K-12 students in California and for the educational reform in California to reflect the importance of computer science in educating students in 21st century skills.

01:56:17.892 --> 01:56:25.498
Julie also leads CS4CA, a diverse group of stakeholders who are working to further computer science education in California.

01:56:27.412 --> 01:56:30.014
Following Julie, we'll have Dr. Allison Scott.

01:56:30.334 --> 01:56:33.577
She is chief research officer at Kapor Center.

01:56:34.177 --> 01:56:51.229
The Kapor Center is committed to making the technology ecosystem and entrepreneurship more diverse and inclusive, with a particular interest in positive social impacts for communities that have historically been on the periphery of access to opportunity, participation, and influence in the United States.

01:56:52.630 --> 01:57:03.934
And batting cleanup, we'll have Brian Twarek, otherwise known as BT, who has the distinction of, well, that's what he likes his friends to call him, so I think you can call him BT.

01:57:04.295 --> 01:57:15.279
He has the distinction of having chaired the Computer Science Standards Advisory Committee and served on the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan Panel.

01:57:15.339 --> 01:57:20.381
So he brings that perspective of both the standards development and the plan development.

01:57:21.441 --> 01:57:35.309
He is also, his day job is to serve as computer science supervisor in San Francisco Unified School District and he'll share information about their journey as they've been implementing computer science in that district.

01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:44.234
And I think at this point we'll just invite all three of them up and we will share more information about the importance of the plan.

01:57:51.212 --> 01:57:53.915
Good morning, esteemed members of the Board of Education.

01:57:54.115 --> 01:57:55.436
My name is Julie Flappen.

01:57:55.456 --> 01:58:02.123
I'm really happy to be here and share with you a little bit about computer science education equity in California.

01:58:02.143 --> 01:58:11.033
As Barbara said, I'm the executive director of ACCESS and also leading the CS for California initiative.

01:58:12.033 --> 01:58:21.795
and the Director of the Computer Science Project at UCLA Center X. And I was honored to be appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to help develop this strategic plan.

01:58:21.815 --> 01:58:30.736
And probably most importantly, I'm the mother of two high school students at Hamilton High School in LA Unified.

01:58:31.857 --> 01:58:39.358
So what I'd like to do is describe a little bit to you about the who, what, why, and how of computer science.

01:58:41.351 --> 01:58:52.894
CS4CA is a multi-stakeholder group of computer science teachers, educators, administrators, industry representatives, researchers, higher ed professionals.

01:58:54.175 --> 01:59:04.598
And we are all working towards advocating for equitable expansion of computer science education that is scalable, sustainable, and equitable.

01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:15.053
Our work is grounded in research that keeps equity at the core of computer science education in California.

01:59:15.854 --> 01:59:32.942
Research was done by my colleague Jane Margolis at UCLA, along with other colleagues who worked with LA Unified to answer the main question, why are there so few Latinx girls and African-American students learning computer science?

01:59:33.622 --> 01:59:45.107
And they really found, through their research of talking with teachers, with students, and with administrators, that there was this complex web of three interlocking factors.

01:59:45.587 --> 01:59:52.530
One was biased beliefs about who can do computer science, who looks like a computer scientist,

01:59:53.030 --> 02:00:08.417
really uncovering how it is that those decisions, based on our biased beliefs, inform the decisions that we make about how we structure schools, and how we structure our classes, and who has access to what kind of learning.

02:00:08.877 --> 02:00:21.200
So, for example, they found in schools that served mostly low-income students of color, classes that were called computer science were no more than rudimentary word processing or typing skills.

02:00:21.700 --> 02:00:30.202
But in classes that were serving upper-income students, mostly white students, were actually studying the deeper learning of computer science.

02:00:30.962 --> 02:00:37.148
So that structural inequalities is definitely influenced by those biased belief systems.

02:00:37.528 --> 02:00:50.580
But the third level is there are also policies and regulations that can either inhibit or promote these kind of high quality computer science teaching and learning opportunities.

02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.605
And what's interesting to note, because our work is really grounded in this research,

02:00:57.646 --> 02:01:04.157
This is how we've made recommendations in the plan that address these three interlocking factors.

02:01:06.198 --> 02:01:11.359
So let me address a little confusion about what is computer science.

02:01:11.539 --> 02:01:18.400
Oftentimes we throw around the term computer science, but we get it confused with, is it digital literacy?

02:01:18.961 --> 02:01:21.721
Is it educational technology?

02:01:21.861 --> 02:01:22.661
Is it coding?

02:01:23.201 --> 02:01:31.383
And when we think about computer science, we think about the deeper learning, the critical thinking, the computational problem solving,

02:01:32.103 --> 02:01:34.486
that goes with technology.

02:01:34.607 --> 02:01:41.415
So we're equipping students to become creators of technology and not just passive consumers of it.

02:01:42.236 --> 02:01:45.100
Coding is something we hear a lot about coding.

02:01:45.961 --> 02:01:50.346
The plan does not tackle coding as its own

02:01:51.708 --> 02:01:56.453
discipline, but coding is one tool in the computer science toolbox.

02:01:56.793 --> 02:02:03.060
So it's integrated in computer science, but it's not its own thing as far as this plan is concerned.

02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:08.131
So why is computer science education important?

02:02:08.571 --> 02:02:21.795
We often hear about the need for jobs and fulfilling jobs, and that is certainly important, but I'd like to really begin with equity as a rationale for why computer science education is important.

02:02:22.235 --> 02:02:24.836
If we think this is foundational learning,

02:02:25.276 --> 02:02:28.378
then it should be foundational learning for all students.

02:02:29.059 --> 02:02:36.144
And when we think about having people at the table developing technology, we need all voices represented.

02:02:37.225 --> 02:02:46.232
Computer science also helps develop 21st century skills that helps prepare students for college, careers, and democratic participation.

02:02:46.672 --> 02:02:51.196
So there's collaboration, there's critical thinking, there's creativity.

02:02:51.756 --> 02:02:58.878
It's really not your old style way of thinking about computer science of just sitting behind a computer and entering data.

02:02:59.258 --> 02:03:13.682
It's really taking all of these different 21st century skills and how do we apply it, how does that help prepare us for college, for careers, and thinking critically about social media and about how we participate in our communities.

02:03:17.310 --> 02:03:18.391
CS for who?

02:03:19.351 --> 02:03:25.874
CS for CA is part of a national movement for computer science for all.

02:03:26.334 --> 02:03:32.237
And when we talk about all and we talk about equity, we are certainly talking about low-income students of color.

02:03:32.657 --> 02:03:38.402
We're also talking about other students who often get marginalized in our education system.

02:03:38.962 --> 02:03:55.036
And this plan really addresses and is mindful about what is a systemic approach that responds to individual needs of individual students and what resources and opportunities students need in order to be successful.

02:04:00.163 --> 02:04:05.046
Interestingly, the majority of Californians want computer science in our schools.

02:04:05.366 --> 02:04:19.834
There's about 85% of voters that were surveyed by EdSource that indicated that they felt offering more computer science was important in their schools, and this survey reflected national data.

02:04:20.314 --> 02:04:34.019
by Google and Gallup that indicated nine in 10 parents want computer science in their schools, but there's a real disconnect because when principals were asked, only one in four principals said they actually offer computer science.

02:04:34.639 --> 02:04:49.044
So this plan helps provide guidance for instructional leaders to say, this is what we need to do in order to meet the demand that is out there among Californians and among the parent and communities.

02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:53.863
So how does the strategic plan do that?

02:04:54.464 --> 02:05:07.302
We do that, and the recommendations that we thought about in the plan are how do we develop a systemic approach that scaffolds equity, quality, and sustainability over the long term?

02:05:07.962 --> 02:05:22.194
Oftentimes, we get intrigued by the next shiny new bullet and we want to implement a new great idea, but we don't have a plan of action that says how are we going to get there and how will it meet all of our students' needs.

02:05:22.794 --> 02:05:33.379
So the plan is really a comprehensive approach to provide guidance for districts to provide equitable and high quality teaching and learning opportunities.

02:05:33.939 --> 02:05:37.661
So for example, it lays out funding priorities.

02:05:37.761 --> 02:05:42.623
How do we meet the needs of our most underrepresented students?

02:05:42.983 --> 02:05:46.244
How does the plan integrate the computer science standards?

02:05:46.705 --> 02:05:51.867
How do we provide culturally responsive professional development opportunities for teachers?

02:05:52.527 --> 02:06:09.173
And then we even talk about working, articulating between K-12 and higher education, what kinds of incentives are in place for students to take computer science and to make it eligible for admission to UCs and CSUs.

02:06:09.733 --> 02:06:18.076
We provide incentives and guidance for schools of education to integrate computer science in teacher preparation programs.

02:06:18.576 --> 02:06:26.824
So it's a real long-term approach that looks at the entire system and what needs to be in place in order to accomplish our goals.

02:06:29.066 --> 02:06:34.751
So to close, we really believe that in the plan, equity shouldn't just be this berry on top.

02:06:35.561 --> 02:06:38.042
But how do we bake it into this system?

02:06:38.643 --> 02:06:53.091
And that is a real long-term approach, and I know all of you are so committed to equity and really thinking about how do we plan ahead in the long-term so that we have equitable, scalable, and sustainable computer science.

02:06:54.572 --> 02:07:02.076
Next is my colleague Allison Scott from Kapor Center, who will give us a bigger picture with support and data.

02:07:05.441 --> 02:07:06.081
Thank you, Julie.

02:07:07.041 --> 02:07:09.722
Good morning, Board President Darling-Hammond and board members.

02:07:09.802 --> 02:07:10.862
My name is Allison Scott.

02:07:10.922 --> 02:07:12.983
I'm the Chief Research Officer at the Kapor Center.

02:07:13.823 --> 02:07:18.504
And our work has examined access and equity in computer science education for about the past five years.

02:07:19.404 --> 02:07:26.546
So what I'd like to provide is a quick overview of where the state currently stands as it relates to both access to computer science and also equity gaps.

02:07:27.886 --> 02:07:38.015
Across California, about 39% of all of our high schools offer a computer science course, so that means about 60% have no computer science courses.

02:07:39.236 --> 02:07:41.898
Only 14% offer AP Computer Science A, and 5% offer AP Computer Science P.

02:07:46.441 --> 02:08:07.621
We've seen that the availability of courses has increased over the last couple of years, but when you look at the distribution by county, this map here demonstrates that AP CS courses are concentrated in specific counties, and other counties have very little access to AP computer science courses.

02:08:08.722 --> 02:08:17.214
We also looked at rural versus urban schools and found that rural schools are seven times less likely to offer AP Computer Science A than urban schools.

02:08:19.877 --> 02:08:26.426
And then when we look at disparities by school demographics, there are significant equity gaps.

02:08:27.503 --> 02:08:34.685
So as you can see from these graphs, the more low-income students and the more students of color at a school, the fewer CS courses are offered.

02:08:35.365 --> 02:08:51.089
And just to articulate a little bit more what's on the screen, the high URM schools are schools that are serving predominantly black and Latinx students, and the low-income schools are schools serving predominantly students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.

02:08:52.338 --> 02:09:00.341
So high URM schools are two times less likely to offer any CS courses, and they're three times less likely to offer APCSA.

02:09:01.262 --> 02:09:05.203
Low income schools are four times less likely to offer APCSA.

02:09:06.224 --> 02:09:09.325
And at the Kapor Center, we've been researching these gaps since 2015.

02:09:09.465 --> 02:09:14.968
And again, despite growth across the state, the gaps have remained.

02:09:16.288 --> 02:09:21.689
So this severely impacts the opportunity low-income students and students of color have to participate in computer science education.

02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:26.230
And we think it also further indicates the need for statewide change.

02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:31.571
So the next slide walks us through trends in computer science enrollment.

02:09:31.731 --> 02:09:36.332
So course access is just one element, whether schools offer the course.

02:09:37.112 --> 02:09:42.433
The next data point to really pay attention to is the composition of students that actually enroll in the courses.

02:09:43.773 --> 02:09:51.519
When we look across the state, just 3% of our roughly 1.9 million high school students were enrolled in a CS course.

02:09:52.660 --> 02:10:02.867
Black, Latinx, and Native American students, who comprise 60% of our student population, comprise just 50% of the students in intro CS courses.

02:10:03.447 --> 02:10:07.050
And the gaps grow as we look at advanced placement computer science courses.

02:10:08.911 --> 02:10:21.050
Similarly, female students comprise 50% of the student population, but just 29% of the students taking intro courses and 27% of the students taking APCSP and 33% of students taking APCSA.

02:10:29.823 --> 02:10:43.967
Another really interesting trend graph, looking over the last few years, we've seen actually promising growth among Latinx students in APCS participation, which is a promising trend, going from 610 students in 2014 to roughly 6,000 students in 2018.

02:10:49.609 --> 02:10:54.592
So that's promising growth, but Latinx students are still underrepresented relative to their high school population.

02:10:54.612 --> 02:11:00.774
So we're looking at roughly 53% of the population and 15% of those enrolled in APCS.

02:11:01.415 --> 02:11:04.936
So we're growing, but we're not really closing the gaps in the ways that we'd like to see.

02:11:06.057 --> 02:11:11.960
For black students, I wanted to call out that the number of black students has grown, but very slightly.

02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:16.622
So we're not seeing the same level of rapid growth among black students.

02:11:16.662 --> 02:11:18.583
And again, this is another point to pay attention to.

02:11:20.888 --> 02:11:25.773
And finally, I just want to talk about one indicator of performance or success.

02:11:26.674 --> 02:11:29.657
And APCS exams, again, they're just one indicator that we have.

02:11:29.717 --> 02:11:34.923
We currently don't have other standardized assessments of computer science performance or achievement.

02:11:35.844 --> 02:11:41.170
Across California, about 7 in 10 students who take an APCS course pass the course.

02:11:42.170 --> 02:11:45.932
But there are significant equity gaps in passage rates.

02:11:45.952 --> 02:11:51.154
So just 40% of black and Latinx students pass the APCS exam when they participate in the courses.

02:11:52.535 --> 02:11:57.677
So overall, these data indicate that there are significant equity gaps in CS.

02:11:58.758 --> 02:12:08.682
And we really think that we have the opportunity to approach these challenges at a statewide implementation level to ensure equity is at the core of CS implementation.

02:12:12.988 --> 02:12:24.010
And we firmly believe that we have to understand all of these trends and understand where equity gaps are and where they've been persistent in order to prioritize policies and funding strategies to address them.

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:30.051
So four of the strategies from the strategic plan that I think explicitly address equity.

02:12:30.631 --> 02:12:39.773
One would be the strategic plan itself, which is intended to help guide legislation to increase access overall across the state and also to address equity.

02:12:40.713 --> 02:13:03.935
The second is around teacher preparation and providing incentives for schools of education to look at how to rigorously prepare computer science teachers, how to also focus in on culturally relevant responsive pedagogy and equity-focused CS education, and then funding priorities to attract, prepare, and support teachers who teach in low-income, underserved districts.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:22.314
Similarly, at the implementation level, we have the opportunity to prioritize funding for low-income districts and districts serving students of color to develop CS pathways, close equity gaps, and also include CS access and equity in our data collection, tracking, and accountability.

02:13:22.954 --> 02:13:31.183
So we have to be able to understand all of the gaps and whether they're closing and where they're closing in order to prioritize resources and strategies.

02:13:31.724 --> 02:13:40.974
And then finally, the infrastructure is also included in the plan and prioritizing high-need districts who need the basic infrastructure in order to execute computer science education.

02:13:42.473 --> 02:13:56.336
So again, the recommendations, as I see them in the plan, are intended to provide guidance to policymakers, to agencies, to communities, to advocacy organizations, philanthropists, to advance equitable access to computer science education.

02:13:57.136 --> 02:14:04.138
So at this time, I would like to transition to my colleague, Brian Twork, who will discuss implementation at a local level in San Francisco Unified.

02:14:04.518 --> 02:14:04.738
Thank you.

02:14:07.930 --> 02:14:08.791
Hello, good morning.

02:14:09.491 --> 02:14:15.535
My name is Brian Tworek, or BT, and I am from San Francisco Unified School District, where I manage our computer science programs.

02:14:16.435 --> 02:14:29.704
And I want to get my perspective not only on our own local education agencies' implementation of computer science, but also my role on both the computer science standards development, as well as implementation panel development.

02:14:32.498 --> 02:14:38.600
So as you know, the State Board adopted our first ever computer science state standards last September.

02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:45.401
And they were written by an expert panel of about 20 educators under the leadership of Stephanie Gregson.

02:14:46.361 --> 02:14:54.523
And we worked off of existing national frameworks to define what we want the learning outcomes to be across our state.

02:14:55.644 --> 02:15:00.265
The goal is to provide a consistent baseline of learning expectations.

02:15:01.511 --> 02:15:06.153
In the standards, they focus on more than just coding, as Julie mentioned earlier.

02:15:06.874 --> 02:15:08.815
It's a more comprehensive look at computer science.

02:15:09.555 --> 02:15:12.957
These standards are vertically aligned, and they're coherent across grade levels.

02:15:13.797 --> 02:15:20.901
The standards are written in grade bands, meaning there's a K2, a 3.5, 6.8, 9.12 band, not individual grade-specific standards.

02:15:23.085 --> 02:15:31.467
The standards are designed for all students, and there's an additional specialty level of standards at the 9-12 level that are elective standards.

02:15:31.507 --> 02:15:35.208
Those are the CTE or the AP level of standards.

02:15:36.409 --> 02:15:43.411
There is significant guidance for interdisciplinary integration, and it enhances what's already happening and sets a vision for the future.

02:15:44.171 --> 02:15:48.232
Those standards are just about to be released with an interactive display in the coming weeks.

02:15:49.855 --> 02:15:52.417
So I'm going to walk through how the standards are developed.

02:15:53.117 --> 02:15:57.039
We began with the K-12 computer science framework, which is a national document.

02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:00.041
And the framework has these puzzle pieces, two sets.

02:16:00.762 --> 02:16:04.184
The first are core concepts, and that's what we expect students to know.

02:16:04.584 --> 02:16:06.846
Those are things like algorithms and programs.

02:16:07.666 --> 02:16:12.610
But that's also computing systems, networks, data, and impacts of computing.

02:16:13.511 --> 02:16:16.893
It's also what we want students to do in computer science classes.

02:16:17.213 --> 02:16:22.798
That's computational thinking and collaborating, communicating, and fostering inclusive computing culture.

02:16:24.099 --> 02:16:28.322
Standards put those puzzle pieces together in measurable, demonstrable ways.

02:16:29.143 --> 02:16:37.009
We worked to refine and improve the CSTA standards that were based on the K-12 computer science framework.

02:16:37.909 --> 02:16:52.112
And the California standards work to fill in gaps in those CSTA standards, to improve clarity and consistency, to align to CTE and industry, and to align to other state-adopted standards, and to build in connections.

02:16:52.552 --> 02:16:55.313
We believe the result is a gold standard of standards.

02:16:55.773 --> 02:17:03.235
And having both been on the CSTA standards development process and knowing what other states have created, I do believe ours are the best.

02:17:04.796 --> 02:17:07.178
I want to walk through one example of a standard.

02:17:08.199 --> 02:17:09.680
So this takes two puzzle pieces.

02:17:10.401 --> 02:17:12.703
One is the concept is algorithms and programming.

02:17:13.424 --> 02:17:17.068
The practice is testing and refining computational artifacts.

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:24.455
The standard is compare and refine multiple algorithms for the same task and determine which is the most appropriate.

02:17:25.436 --> 02:17:27.716
This is a third through fifth grade standard.

02:17:28.137 --> 02:17:32.777
An algorithm is a stepwise set of instructions for accomplishing a task.

02:17:33.397 --> 02:17:43.419
So students learn that there are multiple ways to address a problem and reach the same result, but they compare those to decide which is most appropriate for a scenario.

02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:51.321
The standards work to guide flexible implementation and interdisciplinary implementation.

02:17:52.621 --> 02:17:59.926
There are three examples in the standards that show how this could be integrated within math, within history, social studies, and ELA.

02:18:00.687 --> 02:18:05.450
Our math example is students could look at how to decompose a fraction into a sum of fractions.

02:18:07.452 --> 02:18:13.316
In history and social studies, they could model the early land and sea routes for European settlements in California.

02:18:15.484 --> 02:18:23.309
In an ELA, they could talk about how to get to school and how to get ready in the morning and write an opinion piece about why one algorithm is the most appropriate.

02:18:25.811 --> 02:18:33.256
So the goal of these interdisciplinary examples is that computer science doesn't have to be one more subject to push in, but can be integrated into existing studies.

02:18:35.657 --> 02:18:38.239
And that LEAs should have flexibility in how they implement.

02:18:39.942 --> 02:18:45.584
Now I want to focus on what we've done in San Francisco Unified over the last five years with computer science.

02:18:47.043 --> 02:18:55.931
In June 2015, the San Francisco Board of Education adopted a resolution committing to expand computer science to every student in every grade.

02:18:56.892 --> 02:19:08.602
You can see in the graph on the left side of the screen that since then, we've seen dramatic increase in participation with over 25,000 students in the current year, up from 701 in the 2013-14 school year.

02:19:13.466 --> 02:19:22.372
But I think what's perhaps more compelling is that we've seen a dramatic increase in the representation of students traditionally underrepresented in computer science.

02:19:22.992 --> 02:19:40.644
On the graph on the right, we see a contrast where in yellow, the tech industry or the computing workforce in San Francisco does not look like the diversity in the city or the enrollment in the school district, which is shown in the gray bar.

02:19:42.065 --> 02:19:48.589
When we began work with computer science, the orange bar showed how our district participation computer science looked like.

02:19:48.909 --> 02:19:52.591
It mirrored the tech industry, not the students who are in our schools.

02:19:53.412 --> 02:19:56.614
But over the last four years, we've worked to dramatically improve that.

02:19:56.974 --> 02:20:01.237
And now we see an over-representation of traditionally underrepresented racial groups.

02:20:01.937 --> 02:20:11.082
And the reason why we've done that is because we have focused our limited resources on the schools, the teachers, and the students who are in those groups.

02:20:11.482 --> 02:20:14.484
So with limited resources, we focused our efforts, and we've seen that success.

02:20:16.952 --> 02:20:24.819
So I believe that this plan is important because it provides implementation guidance on two levels, both for the local agencies as well as at the state level.

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:29.743
As you know, we have lots of innovative work happening in San Francisco, but also well beyond.

02:20:30.824 --> 02:20:36.489
But as Allison showed, we have lots of equity gaps that exist, and those will continue to exist without more guidance.

02:20:37.426 --> 02:20:49.954
I believe that this plan will give some guidance for both people at the local level, like myself, as well as folks outside of that, the broader system, for how to adapt and gives the guidance.

02:20:50.595 --> 02:20:58.360
An example of something that I would like to see, but have little influence at the local education agency level, is around the teacher preparation system.

02:20:58.940 --> 02:21:04.524
This plan gives some guidance for movement in that reign and will encourage that further growth.

02:21:10.615 --> 02:21:12.836
All right, so you can see I brought the big guns with me today.

02:21:12.876 --> 02:21:16.297
They know what they're talking about when it comes to computer science.

02:21:16.818 --> 02:21:20.859
So the recommendation for this item is on the screen.

02:21:21.239 --> 02:21:34.085
The CDE recommends that the board adopt the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan pending final approval by the State Board Executive Director of any revisions proposed by the board today and any technical.

02:21:34.625 --> 02:21:34.986
edits.

02:21:36.168 --> 02:21:39.153
One of our writers, Yvonne Cao, is also with us today.

02:21:39.393 --> 02:21:44.863
She and Julie and Allison and VT and I would be happy to take any questions that you may have at this time.

02:21:46.321 --> 02:21:50.145
I'm going to ask Eileen as our liaison to offer some comments.

02:21:50.965 --> 02:21:55.069
Then we'll see if we have public comments and then we will come back to the discussion.

02:21:56.190 --> 02:21:56.470
Thank you.

02:21:56.951 --> 02:22:05.118
So first, Barbara, thank you so much for shepherding this, bringing this back to us and really listening to the board about our recommendations for edits.

02:22:06.619 --> 02:22:11.644
I have to thank Dr. Julie Flappen, Dr. Allison Scott, and Brian Twerk for coming today.

02:22:11.664 --> 02:22:22.095
You really added depth and context, and your information that you shared really does paint a really clear picture of where we are in computer science, what the equity issues are, and what we need to address.

02:22:22.635 --> 02:22:27.800
And I have to say to my fellow board members, this was Trish Williams' baby.

02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:30.743
She really shepherded it the whole time she was on the state board.

02:22:30.823 --> 02:22:34.627
And I am just filling in on the final meeting of it.

02:22:34.927 --> 02:22:39.372
But I just want to honor her commitment to really supporting this work statewide.

02:22:40.332 --> 02:22:47.739
But with that, I just wanna highlight a few comments and just appreciate the slide deck that really does show some clear research implications.

02:22:47.839 --> 02:22:51.962
And first, the panel's been working for more than a year.

02:22:52.022 --> 02:23:00.189
This is a guidance document, but one that I think addresses and gives some guidance to local education agencies of what to do.

02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:06.054
The IQC has been involved with this all along the way, so be aware of that.

02:23:07.755 --> 02:23:14.121
And again, the issue of student participation in computer science doesn't reflect the diversity of our state.

02:23:14.241 --> 02:23:20.566
I thought that map was pretty impactful when you take a look at where it is around the state and who's involved.

02:23:20.626 --> 02:23:25.591
I think the Silicon Valley area and San Francisco had the yellow if I got the chart right.

02:23:25.671 --> 02:23:31.256
And so when you think about where our population is and what the diversity is and what the population of

02:23:31.556 --> 02:23:35.298
involvement and really what the skill set for schools to offer computer science.

02:23:35.318 --> 02:23:40.020
I think we need to think about educators being and we've talked about that a credentialing commission as well.

02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:45.242
The occupations for mathematical and computer occupations are fastest growing.

02:23:45.302 --> 02:23:46.403
They're very lucrative.

02:23:46.483 --> 02:23:51.085
We know kids who pursue after college

02:23:51.605 --> 02:23:53.646
really do quite well in that sector.

02:23:53.887 --> 02:23:59.810
And also that computer science is integrated throughout so many of the things that students face today.

02:24:00.191 --> 02:24:03.853
Even the assessment that we talked about in our earlier item is so critical.

02:24:04.393 --> 02:24:08.056
So I think I wanna reinforce too that there are no mandates.

02:24:08.116 --> 02:24:10.057
I was really clear from the board at the last meeting.

02:24:10.117 --> 02:24:11.518
So this is a guidance document.

02:24:11.938 --> 02:24:18.002
And I don't think we could underline enough the statement that Barbara Murchison made, which is this is going to take time.

02:24:18.522 --> 02:24:21.065
I appreciate BT's comment about the integration.

02:24:21.085 --> 02:24:33.877
I think that's the worry of local educators, like one more class, one more, that we need to show how our frameworks integrate, how you can teach literacy and computer through science, through history, that it is connected.

02:24:33.957 --> 02:24:42.005
We've talked a lot about it, but I don't know that that's fully embraced and understood about how these are not separate single periods, but it's a tool.

02:24:43.846 --> 02:24:54.892
So, there are a lot of multiple entries into this, but this does support the standards that we adopted last September with a guidance document, which we do need to submit.

02:24:56.012 --> 02:25:03.196
So, those are just my separate comments for it, and I'm open to further board comments, and I believe public comments as well.

02:25:03.996 --> 02:25:09.083
We're going to do public comments first, and then we'll go to the board discussion.

02:25:09.203 --> 02:25:10.585
So are there any public comments?

02:25:10.845 --> 02:25:11.066
Yes.

02:25:11.146 --> 02:25:13.429
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

02:25:13.850 --> 02:25:17.675
Alex Torres, Cameron Dimitri, and Robin Hines.

02:25:23.749 --> 02:25:28.932
Good morning or afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, members of the board, Alex Torres on behalf of Code.org.

02:25:29.392 --> 02:25:33.995
Thank you for taking the time to consider the adoption of the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan.

02:25:34.395 --> 02:25:42.440
The plan provides opportunities for California students to achieve greater access to computer science, a foundational skill that every student needs to be able to harness.

02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:53.048
Code.org is a national nonprofit dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools and increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities.

02:25:53.748 --> 02:25:55.970
We work with state education boards across the U.S.

02:25:56.010 --> 02:26:03.776
to support their plan to and their work to expand CS with the adoption of the California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan.

02:26:04.236 --> 02:26:07.058
California will take its place as a leader in the U.S.

02:26:07.098 --> 02:26:09.660
with K-12 computer science implementation.

02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.682
We stand ready to support your next steps.

02:26:12.502 --> 02:26:19.109
Not only does computer science provide every student foundational knowledge, it also leads to the highest paying and fastest growing jobs in the U.S.

02:26:19.149 --> 02:26:19.609
economy.

02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:27.236
There's unprecedented interest in action from government, industry, and education advocates aimed at expanding computer science in our K-12 system.

02:26:27.637 --> 02:26:30.960
Look forward to working with you and thank you for your work on giving education.

02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:31.280
Thank you.

02:26:36.874 --> 02:26:38.896
Good morning, Madam President and Board Members.

02:26:39.316 --> 02:26:44.581
My name is Cameron Dimitri and I'm the Deputy Executive Director at TechNet, the voice of the innovation economy.

02:26:45.162 --> 02:26:50.066
TechNet strongly supports the recommendations made in the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan.

02:26:50.587 --> 02:26:58.674
The plan will help ensure opportunities for both teachers and students with rigorous, scalable, and equitable computer science education across California.

02:26:59.542 --> 02:27:04.624
Our member companies believe that computer science is a foundational skill for K through 12 students.

02:27:05.365 --> 02:27:13.289
Computer science helps develop students' computational and critical thinking skills and teaches students how to create and use new technologies.

02:27:13.849 --> 02:27:20.272
These skill sets prepare students for college, civic participation, and a variety of careers, including the tech industry.

02:27:22.188 --> 02:27:29.835
However, there are still challenges to accessing computer science education, as we heard, and this plan is a critical step towards addressing these challenges.

02:27:30.596 --> 02:27:40.665
Only one out of four K through 12 schools teaches any computer science, leaving 75 percent of students today with the opportunity to develop essential skills.

02:27:41.245 --> 02:27:41.806
Thank you for your time.

02:27:46.601 --> 02:27:49.122
Hi, I'm Robin Hines with Microsoft.

02:27:49.542 --> 02:27:52.263
We submitted written comments, so I'll be short and sweet.

02:27:53.324 --> 02:28:03.368
On behalf of Microsoft, I just want to say that we really think that expanding access to computer science education expands economic opportunity for the next generation.

02:28:04.028 --> 02:28:05.888
And I just want to emphasize that point.

02:28:05.949 --> 02:28:08.930
I think it was emphasized by the speakers earlier, and we urge your support.

02:28:14.028 --> 02:28:17.413
And seeing no other public comment, we're open for discussion.

02:28:19.877 --> 02:28:27.168
Patricia, and then we'll go to Hema, and then Sue, and then Ting, and then Kim.

02:28:29.161 --> 02:28:38.389
Well, first of all, I and I specifically saved this moment of personal privilege to this item in honor of Teacher Appreciation Day and week.

02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:42.233
I would like to do a shout out to Angela Tolson Rucker.

02:28:42.874 --> 02:28:43.935
She may be related.

02:28:43.975 --> 02:28:44.835
Most Rutgers are.

02:28:45.296 --> 02:28:47.278
She was my high school civics teacher.

02:28:47.778 --> 02:28:51.902
She was an African-American woman, a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated.

02:28:52.422 --> 02:29:04.051
The most important advice she gave me and is the advice I heard for the first time in my life from a professional educator, other than my own mother, was not to worry about letting people know you're African American.

02:29:04.471 --> 02:29:05.371
That's obvious.

02:29:05.792 --> 02:29:08.774
Surprise them by also showing them that you're smart.

02:29:09.194 --> 02:29:11.036
So I want to appreciate her for that.

02:29:11.096 --> 02:29:12.477
And again, I'll just tell you all,

02:29:13.237 --> 02:29:14.258
It's not my fault.

02:29:14.679 --> 02:29:16.821
It's all their fault, so you can appreciate them.

02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:22.006
I also want to give a shout out to Katherine Johnson, to Dorothy Vaughn, and to Mary Jackson.

02:29:22.407 --> 02:29:30.855
These were also three African American women, three members of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and they were the reason why John Glenn got off into space.

02:29:30.935 --> 02:29:33.338
And so it's important to recognize

02:29:33.838 --> 02:29:41.880
The role not only of computer science, but the role of all of this technology and what the changes in computers mean.

02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:53.263
These were women who at the time when they did their work for NASA, not only did they deal with segregated bathrooms, but their computers filled this room and they were tape-to-tape machines where the data storage was.

02:29:53.763 --> 02:30:04.592
When I was in high school with Dr. Tolson Rucker, the computer science classes were vocational education, and students were taught the important skill of being a key punch operator.

02:30:05.592 --> 02:30:17.542
So by the time I got to college at Davis, we were still doing computer punch cards, but all the students had, okay, get your mind out of the gutter before I say this next thing, easy access cards.

02:30:18.222 --> 02:30:22.886
So all the computer science majors took all the girls out on date to get their easy access.

02:30:24.093 --> 02:30:26.735
Because get your mind out of the gutter.

02:30:27.395 --> 02:30:48.988
So I appreciate what these standards represent and the advances that we have made, not only in technology and not only in the conversation about what it means to advance computer science and integration of computer science across the grades, but also what it means about our understandings about instruction and the sustained effect.

02:30:49.648 --> 02:30:58.852
But having said that, it's at moments like this when we're sitting in rooms like this and we can talk at the 5,000-foot level about the promise of this work.

02:31:00.073 --> 02:31:01.914
Again, we need to deal with some realities.

02:31:02.454 --> 02:31:10.138
Earlier this year, the California Legislative Black Caucus sponsored a day-long conference on the state of Black California.

02:31:10.999 --> 02:31:17.726
In the technology panel, there was a lot of discussion about the role of STEM and STEM training.

02:31:19.468 --> 02:31:31.162
The expert panel did talk about the fact that while there has been a significant increase in access to computers and computer science education, the fact is they are not being hired

02:31:31.602 --> 02:31:32.603
into the workforce.

02:31:32.623 --> 02:31:38.205
They are not being recruited actively by the large employers like in Silicon Valley.

02:31:38.846 --> 02:31:45.169
And the they I'm talking about are African-American candidates who graduate out of college with degrees in computer science.

02:31:45.649 --> 02:31:50.792
So, we can talk about the promise of what these standards mean and I do support that promise.

02:31:51.252 --> 02:32:03.722
But we cannot legislate the morality or the obligation of the workforce and of employers to not just look at people like me and know the big secret is not that I'm African American, but that I'm smart.

02:32:04.203 --> 02:32:15.452
So we have other work to do in this area and just simply adopting the standards, which I am supporting today, will not in and of itself address that alone.

02:32:21.887 --> 02:32:23.609
I would like to say thank you so much for this.

02:32:24.270 --> 02:32:25.871
So I come from the Bay Area.

02:32:25.972 --> 02:32:26.672
I'm from Oakland.

02:32:27.053 --> 02:32:35.061
And many people know that one of the biggest things that's impacting communities like Oakland, San Francisco is gentrification due to tech companies.

02:32:35.522 --> 02:32:43.170
And so I'm saying this because people don't understand that the access of community, I mean, computer science has an impact on sustainable communities.

02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:47.532
You know, when students have access to computer science, we're able to go into those fields.

02:32:47.972 --> 02:32:52.894
And the truth is that we could go into computer science and we won't be into those fields.

02:32:52.954 --> 02:32:57.395
Like, there's people who will look at a black or brown face and be like, not really.

02:32:57.955 --> 02:33:04.178
And so the conversation, I remember going to the My Brother's Keeper event in Oakland, and one of the panels talked about

02:33:04.838 --> 02:33:16.070
Giving access to computer science does not only help students get into that field, but create our own organizations, our own companies, so that we are able to hire each other and build this and become sustainable communities.

02:33:16.610 --> 02:33:20.614
Because this will make a difference whether or not black and brown folks stay in our communities.

02:33:21.135 --> 02:33:27.081
And you know, it was very alarming, but not surprising to see that only 497 black students have access to computer science.

02:33:27.581 --> 02:33:33.263
Because, you know, one of the first communities that get pushed out in gentrification are black families.

02:33:33.724 --> 02:33:49.570
And so, you know, I really want to make sure that we are targeting black folks when it comes to giving access to these classes because, you know, coming from a community that was mostly primarily black, I want to make sure that they're able to come back because they have access to those jobs in the future.

02:33:49.970 --> 02:34:01.241
So I'm very thankful for this because, you know, it's going to be a step forward, but as board member Rutgers said, it's not going to change the bias, but how do we build our own companies so that we don't have to rely on those primarily white institutions.

02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:01.982
So thank you.

02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:06.660
Thank you.

02:34:07.081 --> 02:34:14.608
First, I just want to give a shout out to Barbara and express my appreciation for the revisions that you made from the last time we saw it.

02:34:15.569 --> 02:34:16.930
You definitely took them to heart.

02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:20.354
I think the document is strengthened because of that.

02:34:20.474 --> 02:34:26.299
It really does point to local funding and local priorities in addition to sort of laying out this framework.

02:34:26.900 --> 02:34:28.642
And one of the speakers, I think, talked about

02:34:29.222 --> 02:34:40.651
that it also gives a direction and policy recommendations to the legislature and to the governor should they decide to invest more heavily and the directions in which that would go.

02:34:40.671 --> 02:34:44.594
And that makes sense to me that that's what we're trying to get at.

02:34:44.674 --> 02:34:48.176
So I just want to express my appreciation to you and to all of the speakers.

02:34:48.957 --> 02:34:53.780
I do want to just do maybe I'm a little bit of a Luddite here because I do think

02:34:54.861 --> 02:35:00.224
that computer science, although very, very important, it is a little bit of a shiny new object.

02:35:00.484 --> 02:35:14.252
And if we had other disciplines in here and we looked at the data, for example, around AP on visual and performing arts or on mathematics, or pick your discipline, you would see very similar kinds of representations.

02:35:14.332 --> 02:35:14.492
So

02:35:15.172 --> 02:35:27.577
I think we have to be aware of the struggles that board member Strauss pointed out that we're asking our schools and LEAs to do an awful lot and we have to be cautious about adding yet another thing.

02:35:28.837 --> 02:35:35.660
So I want to also underscore the examples that were provided about how to integrate within our existing standards.

02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:41.862
I thought that was fantastic and providing teachers with that opportunity I think is really critical.

02:35:44.693 --> 02:35:47.975
My comments are almost exactly the same as Board Member Burr.

02:35:48.015 --> 02:35:53.839
So yes, thank you, Barbara, for hearing our feedback and for incorporating those.

02:35:53.959 --> 02:35:55.941
I also feel that the document is strengthened.

02:35:56.581 --> 02:36:02.225
I think I had alluded to just from the field, having read the other drafts,

02:36:02.965 --> 02:36:07.090
there was a sense of pressure to, oh my gosh, this is yet another thing that we must do.

02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:17.701
And so I think reading this version of the draft, it really does provide nice guidance and allows locals to decide if that is what they want to implement.

02:36:17.741 --> 02:36:19.183
It's a great guidance for that.

02:36:19.643 --> 02:36:23.247
So appreciate the work here and appreciate your taking our feedback.

02:36:27.932 --> 02:36:31.154
I had a, this is maybe more on the clarifying question.

02:36:32.015 --> 02:36:46.665
One of the slides referenced looking at disaggregated data and trying to prioritize funding for high-need districts, which certainly I agree with and think is a right-headed set of recommendations.

02:36:47.545 --> 02:36:52.330
Can you also speak to sort of driving priority within districts?

02:36:52.450 --> 02:37:03.839
Because obviously the homogeneous composition of schools within a district could mask if funding was going to the more affluent schools within a district.

02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:05.701
Thank you for that question.

02:37:06.081 --> 02:37:15.046
I think really, again, it's incumbent upon the LEAs to figure out how to prioritize their funding in a way that best meets their local needs.

02:37:15.546 --> 02:37:31.375
But we wanted to be true and consistent with really the top priority of the panel, which was to make sure that our communities that have historically been the most under-resourced maybe got a little bit first in line for this one, that we didn't just sort of

02:37:32.415 --> 02:37:33.395
have it happen for everyone.

02:37:33.435 --> 02:37:41.617
So ultimately the plan as written really leaves it to the LEA to decide how they prioritize what across their district.

02:37:42.177 --> 02:37:54.299
But I think the panel felt very strongly because of the equity gaps that were described during the presentation that we wanted to give LEAs kind of a little bit of a nudge when it gets to that point.

02:37:54.319 --> 02:37:58.520
Think about your schools and communities that have been under resourced first.

02:37:59.329 --> 02:38:05.091
Sorry, the related piece on that, I think, is part of what's so impactful about the presentation.

02:38:05.131 --> 02:38:10.594
And I want to thank the presenters who are, I think, hiding behind a pillar over there.

02:38:12.234 --> 02:38:14.315
The data is really stark.

02:38:16.116 --> 02:38:24.782
and not terribly controversial because it is so clear when you go from single digit numbers of African Americans taking CS courses.

02:38:25.562 --> 02:38:30.526
And it is, you know, percent change growth is a fantastic way to sort of

02:38:32.386 --> 02:38:39.748
look at a delta percentage and make it seem like tremendous progress and an invitation to declare victory.

02:38:40.868 --> 02:38:45.949
However, getting to 497 is so far from victory, right?

02:38:47.309 --> 02:38:55.251
I think part of, and this is not an amendment to, I'm happy to support this plan, but I do want us to start thinking about what it means

02:38:55.931 --> 02:39:14.478
to actually also build in recommendations around ongoing data disaggregation and reporting back, so that it's not just point-in-time snapshot data that says, we had inequity in 2015, say, was data collection, and we're going to assume that we're good for the remaining

02:39:15.259 --> 02:39:31.640
two years of implementation because those are access gaps and achievement gaps are stubborn and persistent and I think especially because we are we are putting so much onus on the LEA to do the right thing and I think most LEAs do want to do the right thing but there are

02:39:32.781 --> 02:39:44.228
There are competing interest groups within every LEA to be responsive to the squeakiest wheel, and oftentimes the squeakiest wheel will be your more affluent parents and the PTAs in those groups.

02:39:45.489 --> 02:39:51.012
And God bless them for their advocacy on behalf of their children, but we need all kids to actually have access to this.

02:39:51.232 --> 02:40:00.778
And clear data and consistent data reporting rituals, I think, is one of the cleanest ways to start re-prompting that conversation on a regular basis.

02:40:06.276 --> 02:40:10.797
I also want to thank the presenters for their work, their commitment, and their passion.

02:40:10.817 --> 02:40:16.819
I also appreciate that the language is a little bit more recommendation versus mandate.

02:40:17.239 --> 02:40:22.160
And I think we've heard a lot about the concerns that, you know, maybe this is the it thing now.

02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:28.461
But one of the things that we have to understand that this is the it thing now, and we do have to be responsive to it.

02:40:28.621 --> 02:40:34.803
But the reality is that if you disaggregate data by visual performing arts, by computer science,

02:40:35.383 --> 02:40:45.530
we will see that there are structural inequalities, and it's always the same student groups, African American, Latino students, English learners, that will be underserved.

02:40:45.890 --> 02:40:51.494
That is the reality of our system, and that is a system that I hope all of us are here to make sure that we can rectify.

02:40:51.854 --> 02:40:52.915
There is implicit bias.

02:40:53.215 --> 02:40:55.516
There's going to be implicit bias within the school system.

02:40:55.556 --> 02:40:58.578
There's going to be implicit bias outside of the system.

02:40:59.018 --> 02:41:02.841
I think that the best thing we can do is to focus on our sphere of influence here,

02:41:04.682 --> 02:41:24.496
If we are training our teachers on implicit bias, if we're building a system that is based on equity, true equity, if we are educating our students to believe that they have the power, the access, the intelligence to do what they have the potential to do, then at least we're building up students who will hopefully challenge those systems once they leave

02:41:25.456 --> 02:41:27.078
our educational systems.

02:41:27.138 --> 02:41:40.235
And that's all we can do because we cannot control if employers are going to employ our students, but our students will make sure that there are systems in place and policies in place that could hopefully challenge that in the future.

02:41:40.955 --> 02:41:41.636
So that is the

02:41:43.198 --> 02:41:43.999
the hope.

02:41:44.639 --> 02:41:49.902
And also, you know, I was going to say exactly what board member Cardenas said.

02:41:49.922 --> 02:41:59.769
I think that so many of our communities that are being gentrified are low-income communities, are the same communities that don't have access to computer science in some of these tech fields.

02:42:00.509 --> 02:42:11.537
In Boyle Heights, there's this new concept called gentrification, when it's Latinos who come back to their communities but have been educated and are now part of the same fabric of their upbringing.

02:42:11.857 --> 02:42:18.742
So the goal is to have gentrification, when it's our own people that are coming back to their own communities and hopefully building up those communities.

02:42:19.002 --> 02:42:19.803
So that is the hope here.

02:42:25.209 --> 02:42:30.771
I have one question for you, and then Eileen, were you also wanting to make another comment?

02:42:30.951 --> 02:42:32.031
Okay.

02:42:32.551 --> 02:42:46.395
So I understand that we're not legally by law authorized to do standards and frameworks in computer science, et cetera, but I'm wondering, as many people ask for guidance, what kind of guidance

02:42:48.652 --> 02:42:55.374
particularly around this question of how to integrate the programming and so on, your contemplating might be possible.

02:42:55.774 --> 02:42:56.014
Right.

02:42:56.094 --> 02:42:59.675
So the board has already adopted standards for computer science.

02:42:59.715 --> 02:43:11.978
Back in September, you adopted, or some of you who were here, adopted a set of computer science standards, which actually do model, those standards do present an integrated structure.

02:43:12.458 --> 02:43:19.061
So for folks to kind of dig into that document, it'll become more clear on how to integrate computer science throughout the disciplines.

02:43:19.481 --> 02:43:22.403
Right, I guess that was your slide about frameworks.

02:43:22.443 --> 02:43:23.483
The framework piece, yes.

02:43:25.324 --> 02:43:26.404
We are not authorized.

02:43:26.484 --> 02:43:30.286
Obviously, the board builds things as the legislature requires.

02:43:30.606 --> 02:43:34.528
Yeah, if the legislature says we need a computer science framework, then that'll be a different story.

02:43:34.888 --> 02:43:36.309
At the moment, we are not.

02:43:38.251 --> 02:43:41.395
building a computer science framework, or adopting instructional materials.

02:43:41.435 --> 02:43:50.085
And I think part of the thinking was that this field is evolving so rapidly, by the time you finish a lengthy framework development process, it'll be time for a new one right away.

02:43:52.448 --> 02:44:10.401
But we do believe that the guidance in this plan, which talks about how you would begin to implement the computer science standards that were adopted in September, can provide useful guidance to districts who are seeking to move the computer science education ball a little further down the field.

02:44:10.941 --> 02:44:19.567
In terms of the pedagogy pieces that I think typically come with a curriculum framework, like what does instruction look like, we don't have that in here.

02:44:22.048 --> 02:44:31.118
There are recommendations in here that the Commission on Teacher Credentialing take up credentials, and obviously that would have to be authorized through a legislative process as well.

02:44:31.658 --> 02:44:38.946
Again, I think we're very much at the start of this journey to implement computer science, at least as a state we are.

02:44:38.966 --> 02:44:39.927
I think many districts are.

02:44:40.327 --> 02:44:41.948
pretty far along down the road already.

02:44:42.829 --> 02:44:49.793
We, like the state board, the CDE, would need to have authorization to build that, as would the commission.

02:44:50.034 --> 02:45:02.462
So all of us are kind of dependent on the legislative process to figure out what additional guidance would be needed, who would be the folks developing it, and in what time frame.

02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:13.339
And I would really encourage us to think about guidance or exemplars or examples that allow people to see how some places are taking an integrated approach.

02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:17.864
I think that will be very helpful as we move forward in that regard.

02:45:18.504 --> 02:45:19.925
Patricia, you want to make another comment?

02:45:20.811 --> 02:45:40.306
Looking at Stephanie, and she and I have been trying to read lips before I say this, I think that if the goal really and truly is about integration, we're about to, as the liaison that's going to be working with the Math Framework Committee as they undertake the role of revising and updating our math framework, I think the opportunity

02:45:40.846 --> 02:45:52.859
to make this document that we're going to adopt a living piece of information and guidance that we look at how we integrate what are the recommendations and the standards into each of the frameworks as we do that work.

02:45:52.879 --> 02:45:59.866
And so the first opportunity would be with the math framework to develop the type of exemplars and those discussions that you're already talking about.

02:45:59.906 --> 02:46:02.769
I'm hoping that's what Stephanie was trying to explain to me as I was

02:46:03.469 --> 02:46:05.611
Maybe we'll let Stephanie speak for herself.

02:46:06.232 --> 02:46:24.467
I'll just add we're also doing that with our California Arts Framework and our World Language Framework and also the standards, the Computer Science Standards document was written with the intention that we knew that we could not take three years to develop a curriculum framework because the technology would be outdated when we were halfway through.

02:46:25.027 --> 02:46:33.036
So, we wrote the standards document with that in mind, and so there's plenty of guidance around instruction and pedagogy within the standards document itself.

02:46:35.459 --> 02:46:39.444
Any other questions or discussion before we move forward?

02:46:40.895 --> 02:46:41.816
I'm ready for a motion.

02:46:41.836 --> 02:46:56.749
I'll make a motion to support the CDE recommendation that the State Board adopt the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan and pending final approval by our Executive Director of any of the revisions and technical edits.

02:46:58.814 --> 02:46:59.915
We have several seconds.

02:47:01.997 --> 02:47:04.660
Do I need to designate or will somebody?

02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:05.561
Okay.

02:47:05.961 --> 02:47:07.162
Matt, we'll give you that second.

02:47:07.723 --> 02:47:07.923
All right.

02:47:08.003 --> 02:47:09.104
Any further discussion?

02:47:09.785 --> 02:47:10.706
All in favor, say aye.

02:47:11.606 --> 02:47:12.307
Any opposed?

02:47:12.908 --> 02:47:13.809
Any abstentions?

02:47:14.029 --> 02:47:14.429
All right.

02:47:14.529 --> 02:47:15.310
The motion passes.

02:47:15.330 --> 02:47:17.292
Thank you very much, Barbara, for all your wonderful work.

02:47:23.482 --> 02:47:34.848
ask that we push forward on something that I hope will be fairly quick, which is for us to review the waiver consents, which is usually a pretty quick item.

02:47:34.888 --> 02:47:35.128
Yes.

02:47:35.548 --> 02:47:40.391
We're going to do this in three batches because individuals need to recuse themselves at various points in time.

02:47:40.451 --> 02:47:43.392
I know that Patricia Reker is recusing for this first one.

02:47:43.852 --> 02:47:47.554
So we're going to the first waiver consent vote.

02:47:49.035 --> 02:47:52.076
And is there any public comment on the first waiver?

02:47:52.157 --> 02:47:52.897
It's waiver one.

02:47:53.157 --> 02:47:53.717
Waiver one.

02:47:53.917 --> 02:47:54.097
Yep.

02:47:54.978 --> 02:47:55.538
Waiver 01.

02:47:55.978 --> 02:47:57.058
Is there any public comment?

02:47:57.219 --> 02:47:57.959
No public comment.

02:47:58.159 --> 02:47:58.539
All right.

02:47:58.599 --> 02:47:59.659
Do I have a motion?

02:47:59.759 --> 02:48:00.620
I move adoption.

02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:01.800
Thank you, Sue.

02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:02.300
I second.

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:02.761
Second.

02:48:03.041 --> 02:48:03.721
Thank you, Ting.

02:48:04.081 --> 02:48:05.001
All in favor say aye.

02:48:05.021 --> 02:48:05.081
Aye.

02:48:05.922 --> 02:48:06.582
Any opposed?

02:48:06.682 --> 02:48:06.982
Nay.

02:48:07.682 --> 02:48:08.543
Any abstentions?

02:48:08.643 --> 02:48:09.043
Okay.

02:48:09.103 --> 02:48:10.984
We have to give a minute to Patricia to come back in.

02:48:11.004 --> 02:48:11.304
Yeah.

02:48:11.344 --> 02:48:19.427
I hope you didn't get too comfortable out there.

02:48:20.885 --> 02:48:23.787
All right, moving ahead to the second waiver consent vote.

02:48:23.807 --> 02:48:30.432
This is W02 through 11, 13, and 14 together.

02:48:30.452 --> 02:48:35.196
And again, is there any public comment on any of those waiver requests?

02:48:35.516 --> 02:48:38.939
We have one public comment on waiver 8, Wendy Orlandi.

02:48:39.540 --> 02:48:39.920
Okay.

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:44.600
Hi, I'm Wendy Orlandi with Maple Creek Elementary School and the superintendent.

02:48:45.421 --> 02:48:49.664
And I want to really express my gratitude for the work that you do for the children of California.

02:48:49.684 --> 02:48:51.345
It's really important and I appreciate it.

02:48:52.174 --> 02:49:00.577
And I came here over nine hours with all my lovely students to express my support of approving the waiver item number eight for Maple Creek Elementary School.

02:49:01.837 --> 02:49:03.597
We have a rich history since our opening in 1878.

02:49:03.698 --> 02:49:11.200
It's the center of the community and it is the only public building for miles, no post office, gas station, anything.

02:49:12.176 --> 02:49:13.897
I can tell you that we're fiscally sound.

02:49:14.237 --> 02:49:16.098
We're expecting four new students next year.

02:49:16.798 --> 02:49:18.799
We serve a majority of low income students.

02:49:19.619 --> 02:49:21.320
A majority of our students are minorities.

02:49:22.420 --> 02:49:25.582
50 percent of our population has an identified learning disability.

02:49:26.562 --> 02:49:33.065
But what's most important to me and my reason to keep our doors open is each community member from our youngest to our oldest.

02:49:34.586 --> 02:49:37.807
And I just ask that you keep that in mind, these individuals, as you make your decision.

02:49:38.905 --> 02:49:39.806
Thank you very much.

02:49:42.448 --> 02:49:43.688
It's great to see you all.

02:49:44.389 --> 02:49:44.749
Thank you.

02:49:44.969 --> 02:49:45.470
Thank you.

02:49:48.792 --> 02:49:50.133
Any other public comment?

02:49:51.814 --> 02:49:52.134
All right.

02:49:52.154 --> 02:49:55.757
Do I have a motion to approve the waiver consents 2 through 11, 13 and 14?

02:49:59.928 --> 02:50:01.590
Thank you very much.

02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:02.711
All in favor say aye.

02:50:03.612 --> 02:50:04.733
Any opposed nay.

02:50:04.753 --> 02:50:06.515
Any abstentions.

02:50:06.855 --> 02:50:07.235
OK.

02:50:07.275 --> 02:50:10.678
Now we're going to do one more for individual action which is waiver 12.

02:50:11.279 --> 02:50:13.661
And I think someone probably needs to recuse.

02:50:14.382 --> 02:50:15.083
OK.

02:50:15.103 --> 02:50:16.624
We have a presentation on this.

02:50:16.924 --> 02:50:17.145
All right.

02:50:28.492 --> 02:50:32.281
Yes, this is the two LEAs.

02:50:32.361 --> 02:50:32.782
Thank you.

02:50:32.963 --> 02:50:33.564
Thank you, Kristen.

02:50:39.889 --> 02:50:40.189
Thank you.

02:50:41.530 --> 02:50:42.391
My name is Kristen Wright.

02:50:42.511 --> 02:50:45.693
I am the Director of the Special Education Division at the Department of Education.

02:50:45.993 --> 02:50:55.940
This is my esteemed colleague, Heather Carlson, who is the Associate Director, who has been working directly around the issues related to SELPA and the waivers in particular.

02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:59.623
So I have her up here with me today as my expert witness and partner in crime.

02:51:01.023 --> 02:51:12.627
Also, a special thanks to Alexis Slater on our staff, who's been really carrying the SELPA torch over the last 10 years in the department, keeping track of all things that are happening.

02:51:12.667 --> 02:51:18.209
So all the data that you're getting around what's happened over time has come through one person, which is very rare.

02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:20.010
So thanks for her great work.

02:51:21.150 --> 02:51:31.175
We're here today to present a waiver request by two local educational agencies to waive education code regarding size and scope requirements to be a single district SELPA.

02:51:31.696 --> 02:51:44.042
And so we're here specifically about this waiver, but we also want to give you a little additional information today, per some requests, just about some background around SELPA so that you are able to have all the information you need.

02:51:44.062 --> 02:51:45.123
I think you all received

02:51:45.703 --> 02:51:55.472
a SELPA memo last month laying some groundwork and foundation around what SELPAs are and sort of the current state of the land with SELPAs.

02:51:56.032 --> 02:52:08.403
And so I'd first like to provide you with an overview of the waiver and then discuss some of the broader policy questions to get a little bit more guidance from you for the future.

02:52:10.282 --> 02:52:27.897
So this particular waiver is a SELPA that is two districts, and it consists of Hacienda La Puente Unified and Roland Unified, which currently make up the Puente Hills Service Area Special Education Local Plan Area, which is SELPA.

02:52:28.597 --> 02:52:35.361
And both educational agencies are proposing to dissolve that SELPA and each pursue single district status.

02:52:36.102 --> 02:52:48.430
So we reviewed that request and as part of our determination, we've determined they do not meet the size and scope requirements that were set by the board decades ago and haven't really been updated since, and we'll talk about that later.

02:52:48.930 --> 02:52:55.154
And so these items are being brought to you to determine, sorry, my allergies and my allergy modes are acting up.

02:52:56.714 --> 02:53:00.716
to determine whether or not they are granted single district status through this waiver.

02:53:01.397 --> 02:53:07.139
And so at this point, that is for you to decide.

02:53:07.279 --> 02:53:18.505
And so our recommendation would be to approve with conditions the waiver set forth using the current criteria that we have established by you, which is really just size and scope.

02:53:19.205 --> 02:53:29.712
So, I'd like to also talk to you a little bit about what's happening in our current system related to this.

02:53:29.732 --> 02:53:34.816
I want to make it clear that this is separate from whatever your decision is about today's waiver.

02:53:35.396 --> 02:53:55.583
but it sort of bleeds over into a larger policy question for consideration moving forward as we start to get more and more requests for single district SELPAs and that you ask us for our opinion and we want to make sure that we are being fair and neutral around how we give you feedback to hold everyone with the same measures.

02:53:56.849 --> 02:54:04.936
So we've seen, so in our current accountability system, as you know, we hold our LEAs accountable for improving outcomes for students with disabilities.

02:54:05.576 --> 02:54:14.604
And we've really seen the majority of our districts identified for differentiated assistance, be those related to the students with disabilities population and improvement of that.

02:54:14.984 --> 02:54:25.773
So, as part of our statewide system of support, we've been up many times talking to you about how we've sort of brought in SELPA as a key player in that statewide system of support.

02:54:26.374 --> 02:54:43.008
So, as we're thinking about our larger system, I just throw it out there because we are counting on SELPA to be that advisory role, to be the expert, and that next level of sort of regionalized special education support.

02:54:43.428 --> 02:54:45.171
And we work very closely with them at the department.

02:54:45.631 --> 02:55:00.351
So when we receive a request from a district seeking to become a single district SELPA, and we look at your size and scope policy, and then we look to the broader accountability system, there's sort of a disconnect in that we don't have really any other criteria established.

02:55:01.112 --> 02:55:04.053
by which to judge whether we think that's a good idea or not.

02:55:04.453 --> 02:55:06.833
And so you ask, should we approve them?

02:55:07.254 --> 02:55:10.594
And we say, well, it's sort of this rhetorical, you know, circular question.

02:55:10.954 --> 02:55:16.396
Well, they don't meet size and scope, but we don't, we have never judged single districts like that before.

02:55:17.036 --> 02:55:25.158
So we request your support for this particular one, but we also say to you, what else would you like us to think about?

02:55:26.359 --> 02:55:28.321
We need some more guidance and direction from you.

02:55:28.361 --> 02:55:33.846
We're happy to do whatever work you'd like us to do for this process moving forward.

02:55:34.286 --> 02:55:38.310
But again, ask for your approval with conditions of this set of waivers.

02:55:44.156 --> 02:55:47.219
And then we'll go to public comment and then we'll come back for discussion.

02:55:47.762 --> 02:55:57.224
Well, first of all, I want to thank you, Kristen, for the work that your staff has done both with the districts on this concern and also in taking a look at our SELPA waivers.

02:55:57.485 --> 02:56:08.887
I hope all of my colleagues on the board have had a chance to read the information memo that was prepared by the staff concerning the history of SELPAs and the purpose of it and intent.

02:56:09.288 --> 02:56:14.569
SELPAs are very unique in the system that's provided in California and our expectations.

02:56:15.109 --> 02:56:17.450
about the work that SELPAs are supposed to do.

02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:23.093
The policy that this waiver is related to was crafted back in 1987.

02:56:23.653 --> 02:56:31.636
So, I think it's time for an update because there are things that that policy does not consider.

02:56:32.717 --> 02:56:37.299
Students with disabilities in Hacienda La Puente are currently performing in the yellow

02:56:37.959 --> 02:56:59.661
Orange and red categories for graduation chronic absenteeism and suspension rates as well as English language arts mathematics and career college and career indicators students with disabilities in Roland are on the dashboard are performing in the yellow red categories for graduation chronic absenteeism and

02:57:00.081 --> 02:57:05.443
and graduation rates as well as math, English language arts, and CCI.

02:57:05.523 --> 02:57:21.989
Nothing in our current policy addresses whether or not the students in this SELPA will be well served by the district, but there's clear data in our new accountability system that says currently and clearly they are not.

02:57:22.569 --> 02:57:45.195
And so we do need to give our department and we need to give ourselves greater and broader discretion on how to consider waivers like this to make sure that when districts make the request to become their own SELPA, that the work that they're being expected to do and that they're going to be tasked to do in their SELPA really will be in the best needs of the students.

02:57:45.815 --> 02:57:51.577
And so part of what we have to do is think about not only how our system has evolved,

02:57:52.057 --> 02:58:08.265
And much like our county offices of education, we also have to address the fact that SELPAs have a role in providing support to LEAs in serving their students with disabilities, particularly when they have been identified as a district that needs particular types of targeted support.

02:58:08.945 --> 02:58:14.828
So, our single district SELPA size and scope policy doesn't encompass those new concerns at this time.

02:58:15.428 --> 02:58:25.019
So, any revision to that criteria needs to look at those issues and it needs to look at how well LEAs are meeting the needs of their students with disabilities.

02:58:25.619 --> 02:58:36.071
So, I am going to recommend that we do support the staff's recommendation to approve this waiver, but notice there is a change in the timeline for the waiver that's recommended.

02:58:36.511 --> 02:58:47.198
rather than the full amount of time that the LEAs have requested so that eventually it can become a permanent waiver, we're recommending for a year so that the districts can look at what they're doing.

02:58:47.559 --> 02:59:04.490
And there's an expectation that districts in developing and addressing not only their plans for their students with disabilities, but they come to understand the full requirement and breadth of the work that they would have to do, not only as their own self, but as a district in addressing the needs of their students with disabilities.

02:59:05.050 --> 02:59:19.716
So, the proposed motion that I'm offering is to approve with conditions the request from Hacienda La Puente Unified School District and the Rowland Unified School District to waive the size and scope requirements for one year.

02:59:20.356 --> 02:59:32.281
Separate from that, I'm asking the staff to work on some recommendations for ways that we can improve and enhance and broaden the scope of our waiver policy in this area, knowing that we will have this.

02:59:32.541 --> 02:59:34.482
This is not going to be the first waiver that we will see.

02:59:36.627 --> 02:59:37.648
Is there public comment?

02:59:39.531 --> 02:59:39.791
Yes.

02:59:39.811 --> 02:59:42.634
Would the following speakers please sign up at the podium?

02:59:43.175 --> 02:59:49.362
Julie Mitchell, Michael Tincup, Cynthia Colfer, and Judy Fancher.

03:00:03.379 --> 03:00:05.182
Unified School District, and I'm here this morning.

03:00:05.823 --> 03:00:13.453
Should you have any specific questions for our district, both Michael Tinkup, our Director of Special Education, and myself are here and happy to answer any of your questions.

03:00:13.834 --> 03:00:17.519
We also very much appreciate you taking the time to hear this waiver request.

03:00:17.799 --> 03:00:18.080
Thank you.

03:00:25.345 --> 03:00:26.486
Just under, good morning.

03:00:26.766 --> 03:00:28.066
My name is Cindy Proulx-Culfer.

03:00:28.086 --> 03:00:31.008
I am the superintendent from Hacienda La Puente Unified School District.

03:00:31.408 --> 03:00:36.370
As my colleague Dr. Mitchell has indicated, we're happy to respond to any questions.

03:00:36.970 --> 03:00:39.051
This was a very well thought out process.

03:00:39.912 --> 03:00:40.732
We spent three years

03:00:41.212 --> 03:00:46.839
identifying how to do this so we did not simply turn in a waiver when we wanted to.

03:00:46.959 --> 03:00:59.495
We actually worked through as a pair of school districts working together to ensure that we were each serving over 99% of our students separately within our districts prior to having this as consideration by the board.

03:00:59.855 --> 03:01:00.176
Thank you.

03:01:02.148 --> 03:01:02.408
Thank you.

03:01:02.448 --> 03:01:03.349
That's helpful to know.

03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:13.136
And just to pick up on where Patricia kind of left off with her comments about the need to revisit a lot of these questions.

03:01:13.196 --> 03:01:13.616
We are.

03:01:13.736 --> 03:01:18.640
This is not the only request we've received for secession from SELPAs.

03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:28.287
And so I think there's a big set of questions to take up and understand about the ways in which special education may be best organized and what the

03:01:28.707 --> 03:01:35.749
criteria and issues are that should guide our decision making in this sphere writ large.

03:01:36.769 --> 03:01:37.369
Yes, Sue.

03:01:38.650 --> 03:01:42.230
Well, first, I wanted to second board member Rucker's motion.

03:01:42.270 --> 03:01:44.391
I think she made a motion on the waiver, so I would second it.

03:01:44.491 --> 03:01:46.291
But and also concur with you.

03:01:46.351 --> 03:01:48.352
I think it is definitely time to look at this.

03:01:48.852 --> 03:01:52.117
And wanted to suggest or maybe ask Kristen this a little bit.

03:01:53.058 --> 03:01:59.567
I think most of you know that through the collaborative, we received funding last year to develop special education leads.

03:01:59.627 --> 03:02:01.250
And we have two sets of them.

03:02:01.790 --> 03:02:05.175
We have content leads and we have SELPA leads, as I recall.

03:02:06.136 --> 03:02:21.862
And first of all, it seems apparent that it would be helpful to do a data analysis of students with disabilities performance by SELPA, because I think that's what you did in this case with the two districts that we were interested in.

03:02:22.442 --> 03:02:29.986
And there may be, in fact, bright spots, like I know we're going to hear about soon in research for districts.

03:02:30.006 --> 03:02:31.347
But the same thing with SELPAs.

03:02:31.427 --> 03:02:37.771
Are there SELPAs that are doing a particularly good job with the districts that exist in their boundaries?

03:02:39.012 --> 03:02:57.223
But more importantly, whether or not the work that is being contracted for through the collaborative, can we use those folks, that expertise, to develop some of this criteria about size and scope and what successful SELPAs look like beyond those two categories?

03:03:01.447 --> 03:03:03.108
We can definitely work with our partners.

03:03:03.308 --> 03:03:15.298
We are working very collaboratively with the CCEE around the SELPA leads, Carla Estrada, and I directly interact with them and meet with them regularly.

03:03:15.758 --> 03:03:17.701
So it's certainly something that we can talk about.

03:03:17.781 --> 03:03:31.960
And then outside of that, we can also have some additional partners come in to help us work through and present back to you some ideas and look at some data in different ways, cut it in different ways so that you can sort of look at it through different lenses if that's helpful.

03:03:32.621 --> 03:03:32.781
Okay.

03:03:36.691 --> 03:03:37.012
Thank you.

03:03:37.312 --> 03:03:39.234
So a couple of questions.

03:03:39.294 --> 03:03:45.100
So one of the purposes for fiscally for SELPA is it's like an insurance pool.

03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:52.848
So the more you have in there, the more you are kind of insured for huge contingencies and things like that.

03:03:53.388 --> 03:04:04.777
And so I read that under this item that the two SELPAs had are both districts are experiencing declining enrollment.

03:04:05.318 --> 03:04:07.319
So they're going to split apart.

03:04:07.499 --> 03:04:12.363
And then they're also having declining enrollment within each of their districts as well.

03:04:12.764 --> 03:04:15.426
So that's a little, you know, a little shaky.

03:04:16.026 --> 03:04:20.169
I'm and then the other question I had was,

03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:31.815
I guess the recommendation for approval sounds like it's based on the memo and also just your discussion.

03:04:32.595 --> 03:04:38.498
It's because there's an absence of real criteria that you really have no basis to say no.

03:04:39.078 --> 03:04:42.240
So that's kind of a larger piece.

03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:44.341
In 1987, I graduated from high school in 1987.

03:04:44.601 --> 03:04:47.102
That was a long time ago, guys.

03:04:47.762 --> 03:04:54.467
So yeah, so I do agree that we do need to look at our policies, improving SELPAs overall.

03:04:55.048 --> 03:05:10.500
And with this particular one, I would support the staff recommendation, but just wanted to highlight that the declining enrollment piece, I think it's good to have a one year so that we can take a look at what's happening.

03:05:11.980 --> 03:05:17.626
And that's also true of SELPAs that were at maybe at one time met size and scope.

03:05:17.646 --> 03:05:21.469
But there are many, many districts and SELPAs that have been in declining enrollment.

03:05:21.529 --> 03:05:25.513
So when you look at it overall, it's not just those that are coming forward.

03:05:25.954 --> 03:05:32.780
But, you know, we haven't really looked at it in general because there's no, once you're a single district, you never lose that status.

03:05:33.401 --> 03:05:33.601
Yeah.

03:05:34.302 --> 03:05:34.482
Matt?

03:05:37.842 --> 03:05:42.525
I agree with your recommendation and with Board Member Burr's second on this.

03:05:43.766 --> 03:05:51.652
When a district decides to exit a SELPA, they're basically saying we can provide a better service to our students with disabilities than our SELPA can.

03:05:52.332 --> 03:05:54.314
Because it's a financial burden for them to do so.

03:05:55.094 --> 03:05:56.795
It's a financial burden for them to do so.

03:05:56.855 --> 03:06:00.098
It requires that they're going to open classes and most often than not, the SELPA

03:06:00.778 --> 03:06:07.642
is serving specifically designed instructional programs, specifically designed instructional programs where they don't have critical mass to fund.

03:06:07.702 --> 03:06:14.005
So when a superintendent stands up and says, we're going to provide a better service, I think we have to honor that local request.

03:06:14.606 --> 03:06:18.568
But we also, I agree with you, it's a perfect opportunity to develop some criteria.

03:06:19.288 --> 03:06:30.991
that says beyond scope, size and scope, what are the necessary minimal components that you must be able to have to ensure to us that when we give you that opportunity to exit, you can provide the best quality of service to students with disabilities?

03:06:31.011 --> 03:06:38.173
Because right now, as it stands, it's just the size of the district and based on what the school district believes they can do.

03:06:39.294 --> 03:06:43.078
And that is a fine line you walk as a superintendent when you say that.

03:06:44.399 --> 03:06:51.407
And then find yourself in a position where you cannot financially provide the services because at the end of the day, finances don't matter.

03:06:52.167 --> 03:07:00.236
So I think if we could also include locals in that conversation about the development of a criteria, that would be helpful too.

03:07:01.499 --> 03:07:22.423
I'd just like to add to that point that I think we need, in addition to thinking about exit criteria, a broad conversation about SELPAs, about how, you know, that old structure is operating and how the framework for getting the right services to kids in California, you know, should unfold.

03:07:22.463 --> 03:07:25.844
So, criteria for how we're doing this work more generally.

03:07:27.084 --> 03:07:31.226
Seeing no other comments, I think we're ready to take up your motion.

03:07:31.386 --> 03:07:32.827
I'll restate the motion.

03:07:32.867 --> 03:07:47.735
The purpose of the motion is to allow us to use our existing policy to grant as Superintendent Navo and board member Navo said, we're going to trust that and believe that the districts think that they can do a better job.

03:07:48.856 --> 03:07:55.079
The data currently says they're not, but they believe separating and becoming their own self would give them an opportunity.

03:07:55.479 --> 03:07:58.721
to have some flexibility to do their work that they cannot do right now.

03:07:59.162 --> 03:08:01.924
This recommendation is based on our current policy.

03:08:02.724 --> 03:08:16.073
It's the recommendation says to approve with conditions the request from Hacienda La Puente Unified School District and the Rowland Unified School District to waive the size and scope requirements for one year.

03:08:20.138 --> 03:08:21.138
Any further discussion?

03:08:21.978 --> 03:08:23.919
If not, all in favor say aye.

03:08:23.939 --> 03:08:23.999
Aye.

03:08:24.979 --> 03:08:25.999
Any opposed say nay.

03:08:27.119 --> 03:08:27.899
Any abstentions?

03:08:28.360 --> 03:08:28.680
All right.

03:08:28.740 --> 03:08:29.480
The motion carries.

03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:30.360
Thank you very much.

03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:34.021
And with that, I'm informed that lunch is in the hallway.

03:08:34.481 --> 03:08:35.961
We are going to work through lunch.

03:08:36.021 --> 03:08:39.581
So we're going to take about a 10 minute break for you to get your lunches.

03:08:39.962 --> 03:08:44.202
We're going to go right on to item number four, which is going to be a fairly long item.

03:08:44.402 --> 03:08:47.043
So you can be prepared to

03:08:48.403 --> 03:08:49.303
sit for a while.

03:08:49.483 --> 03:08:49.963
Thank you.

03:08:49.983 --> 03:08:50.103
Okay.

03:08:50.724 --> 03:08:51.124
Thank you all.

03:08:51.144 --> 03:08:59.726
We are going to commence

03:09:18.611 --> 03:09:20.142
The public hearing.

03:09:21.731 --> 03:09:26.032
on item number four, the Health Education Framework for California Public Schools.

03:09:27.232 --> 03:09:37.874
And before we begin the conversation, I just want to flag a couple of things about the process, and I'll reiterate this as needed.

03:09:39.654 --> 03:09:43.635
We are going to listen to a presentation about the framework.

03:09:43.735 --> 03:09:45.975
We'll have quite extensive public comment.

03:09:45.995 --> 03:09:49.276
There are right now 181 people signed up for public comment.

03:09:50.796 --> 03:10:00.340
We will ask everyone's indulgence as the board eats its lunch at the podium because we want to facilitate everyone getting a chance to speak.

03:10:01.101 --> 03:10:03.302
And we're going to not have any breaks.

03:10:03.362 --> 03:10:08.604
I don't think we'd take your own individual break as you need to board members as you feel the need.

03:10:10.144 --> 03:10:14.686
As I noted, there are many people interested in providing us with public comment today.

03:10:15.427 --> 03:10:23.070
In order to ensure that there's time for the board to deliberate and take action, we're gonna ask everyone to cooperate and adhere to these practices.

03:10:23.650 --> 03:10:29.993
Members of the public may sign up using the binder in the lobby to address the board during the time allocated for public comment.

03:10:30.813 --> 03:10:36.316
Members of the public may only sign up to speak for themselves and may not sign up to speak for other speakers.

03:10:37.276 --> 03:10:39.297
or may not sign up other speakers to speak.

03:10:39.757 --> 03:10:42.718
Speakers may not allocate their allotted time to another speaker.

03:10:43.238 --> 03:11:01.026
We expect speakers to refrain from using profanity and conduct themselves in a respectful manner, to abide by the one minute time limit, and everyone in the audience to be respectful of all commenters and refrain from clapping, cheering, booing, or making any other loud expressions.

03:11:01.546 --> 03:11:06.748
Remember, this is a workplace and I will reiterate the

03:11:07.168 --> 03:11:08.492
speaking rules when we get there.

03:11:09.615 --> 03:11:14.427
And we will begin with Stephanie Gregson, who's going to present the framework.

03:11:14.508 --> 03:11:14.849
Thank you.

03:11:21.434 --> 03:11:31.201
My name is Stephanie Gregson and I serve as the Executive Director of the Instructional Quality Commission and Director of the Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division here at the Department of Education.

03:11:31.221 --> 03:11:39.286
It is my honor and privilege to be in front of you today to present the Health Education Framework for California Public Schools, Kindergarten through Grade 12.

03:11:40.956 --> 03:11:49.241
With me today is Jennifer Wu, the chair of the Health Education Subject Matter Committee of the Instructional Quality Commission and a National Board Certified Health Educator.

03:11:50.742 --> 03:12:00.308
I'd like to give a big shout out to my first grade teacher, Nancy O'Connor, because she solidified for me that I wanted to be just like her, a teacher.

03:12:00.328 --> 03:12:06.871
And also to all of the teachers that I've been able to work with throughout my entire career, it's an honor to be an educator.

03:12:08.232 --> 03:12:19.686
As my 14 and 17 year old go off to school every morning, my hope for them each day is they are entering their school feeling valued, respected for their differences, and empowered to make good decisions for themselves.

03:12:19.986 --> 03:12:24.291
Basically, I want them to be healthy, happy, and kind human beings.

03:12:24.952 --> 03:12:27.894
And I understand it takes a community to help me with that endeavor.

03:12:28.535 --> 03:12:40.704
Quality health education is a part of that, as it helps our students understand how to make healthy choices throughout their lifetime and encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and social health.

03:12:42.179 --> 03:12:50.846
For our new board members, I'd like to start our presentation with building background knowledge and providing context around standards, frameworks, and instructional materials.

03:12:51.407 --> 03:12:52.488
Let's start with the standards.

03:12:53.188 --> 03:13:01.815
Standards are what we want our students to know, understand, and be able to do at the end of every grade level and the end of their K-12 experience.

03:13:02.336 --> 03:13:05.198
For teachers, it is the what for instruction.

03:13:05.678 --> 03:13:09.321
We have standards in many different areas, like you heard around the computer science.

03:13:09.361 --> 03:13:10.763
We now have computer science standards.

03:13:11.343 --> 03:13:14.245
The health education standards were adopted by the state board in 2008.

03:13:14.765 --> 03:13:19.248
And here is one example of a health education standard.

03:13:19.629 --> 03:13:23.111
The standard comes from kindergarten, the mental, emotional, social health standards.

03:13:23.151 --> 03:13:27.294
This is 1.1M, and it's identify a variety of emotions.

03:13:30.032 --> 03:13:40.257
Once the standards are adopted, it is important to help our educators and administrators understand the standards and how to best provide instruction for each and every student to meet the standards.

03:13:40.878 --> 03:13:43.179
We provide the support through curriculum frameworks.

03:13:43.699 --> 03:13:51.443
Curriculum frameworks include guidance to teachers and administrators on how to deliver high quality instruction to each and every student.

03:13:51.963 --> 03:13:55.625
Frameworks are developed by educators for educators.

03:13:56.165 --> 03:13:59.307
They are based on current and confirmed research of best practices.

03:14:00.107 --> 03:14:06.150
Frameworks provide guidance on how to meet different education codes, but there are no mandates or policies in a framework.

03:14:06.791 --> 03:14:11.953
Frameworks are used as a tool for professional learning and a guide in developing instructional materials.

03:14:12.454 --> 03:14:17.056
Frameworks are not a curriculum or instructional materials.

03:14:17.676 --> 03:14:22.079
And each content area has a curriculum framework to support teachers and administrators.

03:14:22.579 --> 03:14:26.301
We also have parent brochures for our most recent frameworks and standards.

03:14:27.933 --> 03:14:32.200
After a curriculum framework is adopted, we move into the world of instructional materials.

03:14:32.821 --> 03:14:38.028
Instructional materials are tools for teachers to use in their classroom to help students meet the standards.

03:14:38.569 --> 03:14:43.036
Instructional materials come in different forms, such as textbooks, worksheets, and digital formats.

03:14:43.777 --> 03:14:47.599
The state provides an initial review of kindergarten through eighth grade materials.

03:14:48.099 --> 03:14:51.801
This review is based on alignment to the standards and content of the framework.

03:14:52.281 --> 03:14:56.143
The state review and adopted list provides a starting point for school districts.

03:14:56.703 --> 03:15:04.507
Each local education agency will go through their own review process and choose the materials that best meet their students' needs.

03:15:05.939 --> 03:15:13.542
So in summary, standards, curriculum frameworks, and instruction materials are all key supports for high quality instruction for student success.

03:15:15.903 --> 03:15:17.924
So let's talk about the health education framework.

03:15:18.525 --> 03:15:27.589
Our journey for the development of the health education framework began in November 2016 with my staff and I conducting focus groups with educators across California.

03:15:28.329 --> 03:15:34.872
The input from these groups became the foundation for the Instructional Quality Commission recommended and state board adopted guidelines.

03:15:35.692 --> 03:15:45.679
During this time, we were also recruiting for educators and other content area experts for the Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee, otherwise known as the CFCC.

03:15:46.579 --> 03:15:56.266
After the CFCC was appointed by the State Board, they met six times, each time being two-day meetings where the committee diligently revised all of the framework chapters.

03:15:57.026 --> 03:16:04.315
Each CFCC meeting was publicly noticed, open to the public, and had opportunities for the public to make comment each day of the meeting.

03:16:04.795 --> 03:16:07.398
Many members of the public participated in these meetings.

03:16:08.500 --> 03:16:15.007
Once the CFCC completed their work, they forwarded the draft document to the Instructional Quality Commission, also known as the IQC.

03:16:15.788 --> 03:16:19.770
the IQC approved the framework for the first public comment review period.

03:16:20.450 --> 03:16:30.375
After the first public review period ended, the IQC reviewed the public comment, made edits and revisions, then placed the framework out for another 60-day public review period.

03:16:31.036 --> 03:16:37.459
At their March 28, 2019 meeting, the IQC made additional edits and revisions, and that brings us here to today.

03:16:39.369 --> 03:16:41.571
I'd like to acknowledge the work of the CFCC.

03:16:42.091 --> 03:16:53.399
This group was comprised of many experts from kindergarten through 12th grade teachers to school site administrators, university professors, nurses, health education specialists, and public health specialists.

03:16:53.860 --> 03:17:02.166
This committee volunteered many, many hours to the development of the health education framework to ensure the framework met all of the state board adopted guidelines.

03:17:02.766 --> 03:17:08.150
We are grateful for their passion and dedication to providing quality health education to the students of California.

03:17:10.106 --> 03:17:16.372
As mentioned previously, all of the meetings were open to the public and public comment has been welcomed during the entire process.

03:17:16.933 --> 03:17:20.717
We had a dedicated email to receive public comment from the beginning of the process.

03:17:21.257 --> 03:17:28.184
We heard from many organizations, associations, and individuals who provided input on many different topics addressed in the framework.

03:17:29.185 --> 03:17:31.487
There were two 60-day public comment and review periods.

03:17:31.648 --> 03:17:36.052
The first began in April 1, 2018, and went through June 30, 2018.

03:17:37.874 --> 03:17:48.544
Over 1,000 comments were submitted via online survey, email, regular mail, phone calls, and verbally during the Instructional Quality Commission and Health Subject Matter Committee meetings that were held in September 2018.

03:17:50.706 --> 03:17:58.795
Among the comments received, the Health Subject Matter Committee and Instructional Quality Commission approved over 200 comments to be included in the second revised draft.

03:17:59.716 --> 03:18:03.340
These changes and edits are highlighted in yellow on the posted draft framework.

03:18:04.366 --> 03:18:12.692
During the IQC meeting in September, the IQC requested that CDE emphasize the interdisciplinary connections throughout the framework in a more prominent manner.

03:18:13.213 --> 03:18:16.735
We highlighted each of the interdisciplinary connections in blue.

03:18:17.155 --> 03:18:23.920
And during the final editing phase, we'll work with our graphic designers to create an index that will serve as a useful resource for our teachers and administrators.

03:18:24.981 --> 03:18:31.308
The second 60-day public comment and review period was held between November 1st through January 11th, 2019.

03:18:32.430 --> 03:18:35.774
However, CDE has continued to and is still receiving public comment.

03:18:36.414 --> 03:18:45.344
During this time, we received over 2,000 comments through mail, regular mail, email, regular mail, phone calls, and verbally during the IQC meetings in March.

03:18:46.627 --> 03:18:55.116
Among the comments received, the IQC Commission approved over 300 edits from these comments to be included in the second revised draft during their March meeting.

03:18:55.556 --> 03:18:59.020
All of these additions are highlighted in green on the posted draft framework.

03:19:00.021 --> 03:19:04.245
I'd like to highlight four themes prevalent in the public comment we received during this process.

03:19:04.806 --> 03:19:09.450
First, we received many comments in support of the framework highlighting the inclusivity of the document.

03:19:10.271 --> 03:19:16.893
Other themes include the California Healthy Youth Act and parental opt-out, religious diversity, and language choices.

03:19:19.734 --> 03:19:26.156
As I mentioned, much of the public comment we received was focused on the California Healthy Youth Act, also referred to as AB 329.

03:19:26.816 --> 03:19:37.039
I'd like to provide clarification on the differences between the California Healthy Youth Act and the health education framework, as I believe there is misinformation that may be confusing for some.

03:19:38.342 --> 03:19:41.843
The California Healthy Youth Act is a law that took effect in January 2016.

03:19:41.923 --> 03:19:54.989
This law requires school districts throughout the state to provide students with comprehensive sexual health education along with information about HIV prevention at least once in high school and once in middle school.

03:19:56.192 --> 03:20:04.141
The state legislation also allows districts to offer age-appropriate sexual health education in earlier grades if they choose to do so.

03:20:04.842 --> 03:20:15.855
But parents can opt out of comprehensive sexual health education, and local districts choose which curriculum and instructional resources they will use to teach comprehensive sexual health education to their students.

03:20:16.556 --> 03:20:20.801
The law makes it clear that parents can opt out their children out of comprehensive sex education.

03:20:21.321 --> 03:20:36.457
According to the language in the California Healthy Youth Act, the legislature recognizes that while parents and guardians overwhelmingly support medically accurate comprehensive sex education, parents and guardians have the ultimate responsibility for imparting values regarding human sexuality to their children.

03:20:37.558 --> 03:20:47.762
As mentioned above, parents or guardians can excuse their children from lessons about comprehensive sexual health and HIV prevention education, as well as research on student health behaviors and risks.

03:20:48.282 --> 03:20:59.846
However, as stated in Education Code, the opt-out provision of the California Healthy Youth Act does not apply to instruction or materials outside the context of comprehensive sexual health.

03:21:00.606 --> 03:21:09.231
including those that may reference gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, discrimination, bullying, relationships, or family.

03:21:09.951 --> 03:21:17.396
For example, the opt-out rule associated with comprehensive sexual health education would not apply to a social studies lesson on the U.S.

03:21:17.436 --> 03:21:21.058
Supreme Court's 2015 ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.

03:21:22.336 --> 03:21:29.843
School districts are required to notify parents and guardians a minimum of 14 days prior to the first day of comprehensive sexual health instruction.

03:21:29.863 --> 03:21:36.369
To opt out of this instruction, parents, guardians must request in writing that their child not participate in the instruction.

03:21:36.769 --> 03:21:41.694
If the parent guardian does not request in writing that the child be withheld, the child will attend the instruction.

03:21:43.686 --> 03:21:55.635
Now, the health education framework, which is why we are here today, is a guidance document for teachers and administrators on how to provide quality instruction on the health education standards.

03:21:56.156 --> 03:21:59.559
The framework is not a curriculum or instructional materials.

03:22:00.079 --> 03:22:08.646
It provides resources, tools, and guidance on the California Healthy Youth Act and other education codes such as tissue and organ donation.

03:22:10.487 --> 03:22:17.715
There are no mandates in the framework, and it is used as a professional learning tool for teachers, administrators, and other health educators.

03:22:20.818 --> 03:22:33.030
The California Healthy Youth Act offers parental opt-out, as I've just mentioned, and the IQC had an extensive conversation on how to address providing clear guidance in the framework on the parental opt-out information.

03:22:34.215 --> 03:22:40.357
The commissioners added additional language in several chapters providing clarity and additional guidance for teachers and administrators.

03:22:40.857 --> 03:22:53.781
Specifically, they added additional language in a new section titled the California Healthy Youth Act Notice and Parental Excuse and language on parental review and notification for instructional materials being used to teach sex education.

03:22:55.649 --> 03:22:58.850
Religious diversity was another theme threaded throughout our public comment.

03:22:59.330 --> 03:23:10.935
The IQC heard public comment related to being inclusive of all religious beliefs and made edits to include the term religious beliefs and religious backgrounds throughout the chapters to be inclusive of all people.

03:23:11.815 --> 03:23:19.278
The IQC also replaced the term religion with the term spiritual beliefs in a discussion on the different types of abuse in chapter six.

03:23:21.812 --> 03:23:27.934
Another public comment theme addressed during the IQC discussion centered on language choices to ensure clarity of guidance.

03:23:28.634 --> 03:23:32.976
Public comments provided a need to have clarity on the gender identity in the younger grades.

03:23:33.456 --> 03:23:36.837
An additional sentence was added in the kindergarten through grade three chapter.

03:23:37.197 --> 03:23:44.780
The sentence states, the goal is not to cause confusion about the gender of the child, but to develop an awareness that other expressions exist.

03:23:45.660 --> 03:23:52.597
I'd like to now hand the presentation over to Commissioner Wu for her to take you into the content and organization of the health education framework.

03:23:55.848 --> 03:23:56.328
Thank you.

03:23:57.369 --> 03:24:07.136
As Dr. Gregson mentioned earlier, the content of the current draft of the health education framework is based on the 2008 California health education content standards.

03:24:07.837 --> 03:24:14.201
The standards are written through individual grades K-6 and grade band 7-8 and 9-12.

03:24:14.782 --> 03:24:24.008
The health framework includes transitional kindergarten, but the preschool learning foundations are used instead because California does not have health standards for TK.

03:24:25.029 --> 03:24:32.915
Within the health standards and ultimately the framework, comprehensive health education includes six different content areas which are represented in these colorful bubbles.

03:24:33.535 --> 03:24:46.605
Nutrition and physical activity, growth, development, and sexual health, injury prevention and safety, alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, mental, emotional, and social health, and personal and community health.

03:24:47.245 --> 03:24:54.413
I do want to point out that the growth, development, and sexual health content area is actually split.

03:24:54.913 --> 03:25:01.220
In K-4, it is growth and development, and sexual health is only added in grades 5, 7, 8, and 9-12.

03:25:05.049 --> 03:25:15.220
The health education standards also include eight overarching content standards and rationales, which describe essential concepts and skills, and are taught within each of the six content areas.

03:25:15.681 --> 03:25:22.488
The overarching content standards provide scaffolding for students to develop the knowledge, skills, and behaviors they need to be healthy individuals.

03:25:23.008 --> 03:25:27.073
Examples of these include things like goal setting and decision making.

03:25:28.908 --> 03:25:34.130
The health education framework begins with the introduction and supporting health education chapters.

03:25:34.571 --> 03:25:44.515
These chapters serve as a resource for administrators at the school and district levels and school board members for supporting and improving health education in their districts and schools.

03:25:45.076 --> 03:25:54.060
A few highlights of these chapters are that they include the importance of health education, suggestions on making the school and the classroom a safe environment for all students to learn,

03:25:54.660 --> 03:26:08.076
provide guidance on professional development, and discuss the role of parents, legal guardians, families in health education, as well as the role of the community and how to engage with community-based organizations to support health education.

03:26:09.577 --> 03:26:14.440
Chapters three through six are the grade span chapters and are written for teachers.

03:26:15.121 --> 03:26:24.167
These chapters follow the structure of the 2008 health education content standards and are written in a manner that is teacher-friendly, practical, jargon-free, and easy to read.

03:26:24.807 --> 03:26:43.472
The content in the grade level chapters provide suggestions for engaging students and connecting health education to real world situations while also connecting learning from one grade level to another grade level to show the progression of skills and knowledge in all six of the content areas included in California's comprehensive health education standards.

03:26:44.072 --> 03:26:48.753
Opportunities to make interdisciplinary connections are highlighted throughout these chapters.

03:26:50.751 --> 03:27:04.378
Chapter 7 provides guidance on designing instruction that is universally designed to be inclusive, so that each and every one of California's diverse learners can have equitable access to a standards-based, high-quality, comprehensive health education.

03:27:04.878 --> 03:27:18.626
This chapter reinforces that instruction must be free of bias and affirmatively supports all students, regardless of their disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or living situation.

03:27:19.386 --> 03:27:28.672
Chapter 8 focuses on assessment and provides grade-level examples of multiple measures, assessment tools, and techniques for assessing students' skills and content knowledge.

03:27:29.212 --> 03:27:39.059
Chapter 9 provides guidance on the selection of instructional materials and includes evaluation criteria for the SBE adoption of instructional materials for students in kindergarten through grade 8.

03:27:39.759 --> 03:27:53.887
The chapter also provides guidance for local districts on the adoption of instructional materials for students in grades 9 through 12 and information regarding the social content review process, supplemental instructional materials, and accessible instructional materials.

03:27:56.127 --> 03:28:05.112
The sex trafficking appendix was written due to legislation and was written by content experts who represent the organization Women Escaping a Violent Environment or WEAVE.

03:28:06.053 --> 03:28:18.441
The purpose of this appendix is to provide information regarding sex trafficking as it relates to schools in the community and is meant to be a tool for educators, school staff, administrators, district staff, parents, and community members.

03:28:19.341 --> 03:28:31.088
The standards-based instruction appendix serves as an additional resource for teachers and administrators because it provides examples of standards-based instructional strategies that can be applied in a variety of educational settings and formats.

03:28:33.330 --> 03:28:37.512
Here are some highlights of the framework that further help meet the state board adopted guidelines.

03:28:38.473 --> 03:28:48.279
On the left side of the screen, you will see a wheel, which is the Center for Disease Control's whole school, whole community, whole child model, otherwise known as the WSCC model.

03:28:48.799 --> 03:28:53.902
and it is the CDC's framework for addressing health in schools.

03:28:54.442 --> 03:29:04.847
The WSCC model is student-centered and emphasizes the role of the community, including the whole school and students' families, in supporting the connections between the health and academic achievement.

03:29:05.387 --> 03:29:10.890
The current draft of the California Health Education Framework is grounded in this model.

03:29:11.590 --> 03:29:25.878
Highlights of the framework are the age-appropriate and standards-based ideas for projects and events provided in three distinct sections that appear in all of the grade-level chapters for the six different content areas included in comprehensive health education.

03:29:26.338 --> 03:29:32.101
These sections are partnering with your school, partnering with your community, and partnering with the family.

03:29:33.846 --> 03:29:39.048
Instruction on developing and keeping healthy relationships with others is scaffolded through the grade level chapters.

03:29:39.509 --> 03:29:45.771
In the primary grades, there is a focus on how to recognize feelings and the needs of themselves and others.

03:29:46.472 --> 03:29:53.935
In the upper elementary grades, there is a focus on teaching students to analyze how expressing emotions appropriately may reduce conflict and promote safety.

03:29:54.615 --> 03:30:02.359
The secondary grades focus on understanding the key elements of healthy relationships and healthy ways to respond to unhealthy relationships.

03:30:03.599 --> 03:30:11.161
Finally, the current draft health education framework promotes bias-free and safe learning environment for each and every one of California's diverse students.

03:30:11.801 --> 03:30:29.606
Phrases such as differences are respected and teachers should affirmatively acknowledge the existence of relationships that are not heterosexual by using examples of same-sex couples in class discussions and using gender-neutral language when referencing gender identity and relationships are used throughout.

03:30:31.479 --> 03:30:32.662
Thank you, Commissioner Netwoo.

03:30:33.886 --> 03:30:35.931
So what's happening now and what's happening next?

03:30:37.108 --> 03:30:43.472
Many states across the country and even other countries are enhancing their efforts on providing comprehensive health education for all students.

03:30:43.892 --> 03:30:44.592
So we're not alone.

03:30:45.493 --> 03:30:55.399
Most recently, the Colorado Senate passed a bill to update the sex education curriculum for school districts, adding instruction on sexual orientation, consent, and sexually transmitted diseases.

03:30:55.839 --> 03:31:05.225
The federal government is supporting comprehensive sexual health education through the proposed bill's Real Education for Healthy Youth Act and the Youth Access to Sexual Health Services Act.

03:31:05.945 --> 03:31:14.191
Additionally, Great Britain is expanding sex education with the guiding principles of keeping children safe, fostering respect for others, and for differences.

03:31:14.432 --> 03:31:24.339
However, California is leading the way in providing health education to all students and providing support for our teachers and administrators in providing high quality health education.

03:31:24.860 --> 03:31:35.248
Last year, California designated $5 million in Proposition 98 funds to provide professional learning and resources for teachers and administrators based on the draft health education framework.

03:31:35.728 --> 03:31:44.211
Through this effort, health educators across the state have been collaborating on the development of these professional learning tools and resources based on the draft health education framework.

03:31:44.511 --> 03:31:49.173
And we thank our partners at the Orange County Department of Education for leading this work.

03:31:49.333 --> 03:31:57.276
And in 2020, we will conduct the state-level K-8 instructional materials adoption process to support districts in their own choosing of instructional materials.

03:31:57.896 --> 03:32:02.718
And based on state board action today, we will begin the editing and design of the health education framework.

03:32:05.290 --> 03:32:30.942
So after listening to and hearing public comment regarding specific resources over the past several months, the California Department of Education recommends that the state board adopt the draft 2019 health education framework for California public schools, kindergarten through grade 12, with the changes recommended by the IQC on March 28, 2019, and the removal from the framework of references to the following specific resources.

03:32:31.602 --> 03:32:32.423
My Princess Boy,

03:32:33.283 --> 03:32:47.467
Who Are You, The Kid's Guide to Gender Identity, Changing You, A Guide to Body Changes and Sexuality, What's Happening to My Body, SEX, The All-You-Need-To-Know Progressive Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties.

03:32:48.108 --> 03:33:02.332
The CDE further recommends that the State Board authorize CDE staff pending State Board Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the State Board, correction of any typographical errors, and any non-substantive technical edits necessary for publication.

03:33:03.632 --> 03:33:09.878
The above resources that I mentioned will be available on the CDE website for any references for our teachers and administrators.

03:33:10.679 --> 03:33:16.785
I'd like to end the presentation on this quote from a public comment made by a former high school student now pursuing their medical degree.

03:33:17.853 --> 03:33:25.924
As a gay man who grew up in the Bay Area, information on LGBTQ plus health would have been so helpful to have seen when I was in high school.

03:33:26.425 --> 03:33:33.674
I was questioning my sexual orientation at the time and just knowing there were others like me would have made me feel included and respected.

03:33:34.295 --> 03:33:43.500
The foundation of the health education framework is to be sure our teachers have the support necessary to create inclusive and welcoming classrooms.

03:33:44.100 --> 03:33:47.823
I look forward to answering any of your questions after the public comment.

03:33:48.023 --> 03:33:48.363
Thank you.

03:33:52.944 --> 03:33:58.526
And I would like to see if our liaison, Felisa, has comments at this point.

03:33:59.246 --> 03:33:59.506
I do.

03:33:59.786 --> 03:34:00.126
Thank you.

03:34:01.167 --> 03:34:05.388
I want to begin by stating that our students are the school system's greatest asset.

03:34:05.908 --> 03:34:15.030
I believe that all our students deserve to be honored, respected, and properly educated, and welcoming, inclusive, and responsive school environments.

03:34:15.931 --> 03:34:19.892
Every classroom should be a safe, healthy place for students to learn and thrive.

03:34:20.772 --> 03:34:25.895
Every student should have access to the knowledge and skills they need to grow into a happy, healthy adult.

03:34:26.875 --> 03:34:36.780
Making sure our teachers are guided towards health instruction that is age appropriate, medically accurate, and inclusive of all learners is the right thing to do.

03:34:37.740 --> 03:34:47.185
Given that, I appreciate the hard work of staff, the Health Subject Matter Committee, framework writers, and the IQC in developing this comprehensive and inclusive framework.

03:34:48.342 --> 03:35:03.728
Besides sexual education and gender identity, this framework includes things like obesity, violence, drug abuse, trauma, health disparities, how those disparities impact communities, and in particular, communities of color and low-income communities.

03:35:04.508 --> 03:35:06.149
The framework teaches about consent.

03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:12.253
the growing issue of sex trafficking and diseases that are real threats that confront today's youth.

03:35:12.994 --> 03:35:18.757
And it puts their success in life and school at risk, these threats.

03:35:19.658 --> 03:35:26.682
Equipping our students with the tools they need to protect themselves from these challenges requires honesty, accuracy, and thoroughness.

03:35:27.843 --> 03:35:32.144
It's still important to emphasize that this framework is not mandatory.

03:35:32.564 --> 03:35:34.785
The standards are optional as well.

03:35:35.505 --> 03:35:37.485
The framework is not a curriculum.

03:35:37.785 --> 03:35:44.827
It's a guidance for districts and teachers as they develop a health education curriculum that suits their local community.

03:35:45.667 --> 03:35:55.529
In our direction to staff and IQC, we requested that the framework include resources that districts or teachers can use when partnering with their local communities.

03:35:56.653 --> 03:36:03.538
As a result, there are references to books, videos, worksheets, and curriculum throughout all the sections of the framework.

03:36:05.079 --> 03:36:09.982
Unfortunately, a few of the books have generated a lot of misinformation and controversy.

03:36:10.802 --> 03:36:15.325
This has taken the focus away from very important areas of the framework.

03:36:16.246 --> 03:36:23.891
Misinformation about these books has created panic that California is mandating the use of certain books, which is not true.

03:36:24.946 --> 03:36:29.390
The proposed motion removes some of the books that have created distraction and contention.

03:36:30.090 --> 03:36:33.153
It is important to note that the board is not trying to ban books.

03:36:33.573 --> 03:36:41.680
We're not saying that the books are bad, but the removal will help avoid the misunderstanding that California is mandating the use of these books.

03:36:42.521 --> 03:36:46.064
I look forward to hearing from our stakeholders and their respectful public comment.

03:36:46.284 --> 03:36:46.544
Thank you.

03:36:50.165 --> 03:36:50.926
Thank you very much.

03:36:51.947 --> 03:36:59.253
So I'll let you take a seat for a little while as we start public comment at this point.

03:36:59.814 --> 03:37:06.239
And again, I will, oh, I need to bang the gavel in order to do this properly.

03:37:06.259 --> 03:37:08.922
I am opening public comment.

03:37:09.943 --> 03:37:11.584
We are ready for speakers one through 15.

03:37:12.045 --> 03:37:14.487
Numbers 16 through 30, please line up.

03:37:14.921 --> 03:37:15.241
All right.

03:37:15.962 --> 03:37:21.384
And I'm going to remind folks to please try to abide by the one minute time limit.

03:37:21.865 --> 03:37:27.027
There's a light on the podium that will flash orange when speakers have seconds remaining to speak.

03:37:27.728 --> 03:37:30.549
And there's a signal to speakers to finish their sentence.

03:37:31.089 --> 03:37:33.010
When the light turns red, your time is up.

03:37:33.531 --> 03:37:37.633
Please stop speaking immediately and leave the podium to allow the next speaker to begin.

03:37:38.453 --> 03:37:46.878
We expect everyone in the audience to be respectful of all the commenters, and please remember that this is a workplace.

03:37:47.139 --> 03:37:50.741
Thank you, and please state your name and affiliation as you begin.

03:37:52.435 --> 03:37:54.156
Hello, my name is Kristen Heiler.

03:37:54.176 --> 03:38:00.480
I'm a mother of three kids, also a kids' church director of Horizon Christian Fellowship in San Diego.

03:38:00.500 --> 03:38:06.123
I would like to start this time of public speaking in a word of prayer, if you don't mind.

03:38:06.984 --> 03:38:10.646
Heavenly Father, Lord, I thank you that you love us all so much.

03:38:10.686 --> 03:38:13.808
I thank you that you love each of these board members so much, God.

03:38:13.848 --> 03:38:14.509
I thank you that

03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:26.453
You love all of the people that are coming to express their concerns, or if they're in support of, Lord, I just thank you, God, that you have a heart of love for each one of us, Lord.

03:38:26.513 --> 03:38:30.335
And I just ask for your wisdom to be poured upon each of these board members.

03:38:30.395 --> 03:38:34.436
Would you show them exactly how you want them to vote, Lord?

03:38:34.496 --> 03:38:41.719
And may your will be done, and may each kid in California be able to grow to their full potential of who you've created them to be.

03:38:41.999 --> 03:38:43.539
In Jesus Christ's name, amen.

03:38:44.080 --> 03:38:44.700
Thank you very much.

03:38:51.909 --> 03:39:00.413
Hello, my name is Kelly and I'm from Monterey County and I'm here today as a parent and just wanted to share with you.

03:39:00.573 --> 03:39:05.476
I'm glad you are taking this book by Heather Carina and you're recommending that that come out of the framework.

03:39:05.716 --> 03:39:07.837
You have a piece of paper here that I've provided.

03:39:09.338 --> 03:39:13.040
On chapter six of the framework, it went into BDSM.

03:39:13.320 --> 03:39:21.144
It goes into other topics like sex toys, body fluid, or blood play, and a whole slew of other topics.

03:39:21.524 --> 03:39:27.887
And this is not something that encourages professionalism among our students.

03:39:28.467 --> 03:39:36.672
I would also say, when Planned Parenthood came into my high school health class, they introduced themselves and they said, if you haven't had sex yet, you will while you're in high school.

03:39:37.492 --> 03:39:39.714
And I don't think that belongs in our schools.

03:39:39.975 --> 03:39:44.038
I had a very negative impression when they came into my high school freshman health class.

03:39:44.679 --> 03:39:51.906
And I would hope they wouldn't be so heavily involved at this California Department of Education because the message that they gave me was a disservice.

03:39:53.548 --> 03:39:53.868
Thank you.

03:39:59.198 --> 03:40:00.078
Hi, good afternoon.

03:40:00.159 --> 03:40:02.840
My name is Donna, and I'm from Monterey, California.

03:40:03.780 --> 03:40:12.044
I previously was a science teacher, a middle school science teacher, and then ended up teaching biology at high school and became a high school counselor.

03:40:12.084 --> 03:40:16.026
But more importantly, I'm a mother of a five-year-old and a seven-year-old daughter.

03:40:16.046 --> 03:40:25.631
And I just come humbly asking you to please just consider to leave so many of these issues that, so many of these issues.

03:40:25.671 --> 03:40:27.612
My son and daughter, they just want to play.

03:40:27.992 --> 03:40:28.713
They don't know.

03:40:30.302 --> 03:40:31.523
They don't know and understand.

03:40:31.543 --> 03:40:38.350
They don't even have the comprehension to even understand so many of the things that are going to be presented into the kindergarten level.

03:40:38.370 --> 03:40:40.072
I mean, I know my son and daughter.

03:40:40.092 --> 03:40:41.072
I know high school students.

03:40:41.113 --> 03:40:46.097
I know middle school students, because I've taught and counseled so many of them in the United States as well as in London.

03:40:46.838 --> 03:40:47.919
And kids are kids.

03:40:48.019 --> 03:40:49.080
We're all over the world.

03:40:49.200 --> 03:40:50.221
In the United States,

03:40:50.982 --> 03:40:53.804
They just want to play and just let their innocence stay.

03:40:53.824 --> 03:40:58.607
I just come humbly asking you to honestly just reject the framework and just leave.

03:40:58.707 --> 03:41:03.010
Let us parents be parents to teach our own children about kindness and respect.

03:41:03.511 --> 03:41:03.791
Thank you.

03:41:10.421 --> 03:41:11.182
Good afternoon.

03:41:11.322 --> 03:41:12.082
I'm Mary Perry.

03:41:12.102 --> 03:41:15.385
I'm Vice President for Education for the California State PTA.

03:41:16.105 --> 03:41:21.569
Our organization represents 750,000 members throughout the state.

03:41:22.129 --> 03:41:25.172
Half of our units are in Title I schools.

03:41:26.353 --> 03:41:34.819
And we support the adoption of this framework as presented and its approach specifically related to gender identity.

03:41:35.539 --> 03:41:49.041
Research shows that LBGTQ plus youth are more likely to be the victims of bullying and harassment, which has negative impacts on their educational experiences, but also on many, many other aspects of their life.

03:41:49.721 --> 03:42:04.324
Research also shows that education about those issues, about sexual orientation and gender identity and expression in a school setting has a positive impact for all students in terms of their respect for diversity.

03:42:05.004 --> 03:42:12.690
This framework is consistent with the department's goal of providing guidance, not mandates, and we urge your adoption.

03:42:18.629 --> 03:42:20.690
Good afternoon, Madam President and Board.

03:42:21.631 --> 03:42:22.491
I am Kathy Hall.

03:42:22.531 --> 03:42:25.253
I'm the health advocate for the California State PTA.

03:42:25.854 --> 03:42:35.760
Our tagline, Every Child, One Voice, indicates our support for diversity and inclusion so that every child is best served by public institutions.

03:42:35.900 --> 03:42:46.807
In 2015, our members at our statewide convention adopted a resolution, LGBTQ youth plus health education in California.

03:42:47.387 --> 03:42:53.453
We previously, our members adopted HIV STD prevention education in schools.

03:42:53.954 --> 03:42:57.537
The framework supports the ideas and ideals in these resolutions.

03:42:58.098 --> 03:43:03.743
School health classes are the one place where the curriculum is focused on the student themselves.

03:43:04.124 --> 03:43:08.788
The framework addresses many aspects of youth health and sexuality.

03:43:09.369 --> 03:43:20.043
gives students age appropriate medically accurate information that students can use to act responsibly, prevent disease and pregnancy, and affirm sexual orientation and gender.

03:43:20.323 --> 03:43:21.104
Time.

03:43:22.426 --> 03:43:23.006
We support.

03:43:23.106 --> 03:43:23.407
Thank you.

03:43:27.793 --> 03:43:28.354
Good afternoon.

03:43:28.414 --> 03:43:30.737
My name is Dan Prout, Nevada City, California.

03:43:30.757 --> 03:43:36.243
I appreciate the board taking this time to listen to those of us who are gathered.

03:43:36.744 --> 03:43:39.387
Most of us are not used to being in the political realm.

03:43:40.108 --> 03:43:45.094
And I would judge that most that you're going to hear from today are people who have taken time from work and home to be here.

03:43:46.756 --> 03:43:52.022
All political issues are based in social issues and all social issues arise from values issues.

03:43:52.903 --> 03:44:02.715
And my position on this framework is that the majority of the values of the people of California are not reflected in the framework.

03:44:03.636 --> 03:44:04.317
Thank you so much.

03:44:09.477 --> 03:44:09.877
Good day.

03:44:10.198 --> 03:44:11.458
My name is Sean O'Brien.

03:44:11.999 --> 03:44:13.080
I live here in Sacramento.

03:44:13.500 --> 03:44:18.844
I was raised Irish Catholic, so of course I've been confused about sexuality for 67 years or so.

03:44:21.966 --> 03:44:26.169
I taught in the Catholic schools for 30 years, and because of that, I'm an atheist today.

03:44:29.451 --> 03:44:35.435
The only reason that I was able to deal with my son coming out as gay at 18 was because I worked in the theater all my life.

03:44:37.617 --> 03:44:39.198
It was surprising, but I dealt with it.

03:44:39.909 --> 03:44:46.792
But I didn't have anything that I owned to deal with it, except that I had known gay people in the theater.

03:44:48.212 --> 03:44:49.753
There are too many lies in this world.

03:44:50.433 --> 03:44:55.615
We're just awash with slander and ad hominem attacks, all kinds of perjuries.

03:44:56.196 --> 03:44:58.777
We need honesty when it comes to sexuality.

03:44:59.517 --> 03:45:01.258
It's 400 years since the Enlightenment.

03:45:01.278 --> 03:45:04.399
It's 200 years plus since Darwin.

03:45:04.939 --> 03:45:06.020
We need to evolve.

03:45:07.320 --> 03:45:07.660
Thank you.

03:45:07.700 --> 03:45:08.941
I adopt the framework.

03:45:13.646 --> 03:45:20.909
Good afternoon, Tammy Martin with Equality California, which for 20 years has led the Golden State's fight for full LGBTQ equality.

03:45:21.449 --> 03:45:26.251
And we were a sponsor of the California Healthy Youth Act and are working to implement that critical law.

03:45:26.951 --> 03:45:32.733
Our students need to be equipped with medically accurate, age appropriate, and inclusive programs and instruction.

03:45:33.233 --> 03:45:37.875
Our schools are diverse and when every student is acknowledged, all students are safer.

03:45:38.675 --> 03:45:45.540
Better school climate means better educational outcomes, less bullying, and healthier youth who become more successful adults.

03:45:46.381 --> 03:46:01.092
Only 6.7% of LGBTQ students report ever receiving LGBTQ-inclusive sex ed, yet 89% of California parents support comprehensive sex ed, which will help their children protect themselves and engage in healthy relationships.

03:46:01.832 --> 03:46:10.117
And while many schools recognize the value of the requirements of the California Healthy Youth Act, they will benefit from your detailed guidance, which is why your work has been and remains so important.

03:46:10.497 --> 03:46:16.260
So thank you for your ongoing attention to these important issues and your work to make health education inclusive for all California students.

03:46:20.052 --> 03:46:32.407
We would like to ask the speakers who are finished speaking to leave the room, the boardroom, in a group rather than opening the door repetitively, which makes it very difficult for people to hear.

03:46:33.648 --> 03:46:35.070
Sarah will help you with that in the back.

03:46:36.462 --> 03:46:39.204
Good afternoon, President Dorling-Hammond and State Board members.

03:46:39.584 --> 03:46:41.446
Thank you for the opportunity to comment today.

03:46:42.347 --> 03:46:43.468
My name is Clell Hoffman.

03:46:43.788 --> 03:46:50.353
I am the Chair of the State Superintendent of Public Instructions Child Nutrition Advisory Council, known as CNAC.

03:46:50.913 --> 03:46:56.318
The CNAC is a legislative council charged with advising the State Superintendent on school nutrition-related issues.

03:46:57.018 --> 03:47:06.361
The CNAC had the opportunity to provide comments on both the first and second drafts of the California Health Education Framework, specifically in the nutrition sections.

03:47:06.921 --> 03:47:13.924
We are proud to report that the Instructional Quality Commission favorably received all but a few of our comments.

03:47:14.984 --> 03:47:30.715
The health education framework provides educators the opportunity to help their students gain knowledge and awareness, practice, and ultimately master beneficial behaviors and lifestyle skills so students can be healthy, productive, successful members of society.

03:47:31.716 --> 03:47:38.481
Research clearly shows that hungry children, children with poor nutrition, and children in poor overall health... Time.

03:47:38.961 --> 03:47:39.842
...are not ready to learn.

03:47:41.343 --> 03:47:41.623
Thank you.

03:47:46.564 --> 03:47:47.244
Good afternoon.

03:47:47.325 --> 03:47:51.768
My name is Laura Jimenez, and I'm the executive director at California Latinas for Reproductive Justice.

03:47:51.828 --> 03:47:58.212
We're a statewide organization by and for Latinas and Latinx persons in California, and we are in strong support of the draft framework.

03:47:58.952 --> 03:48:04.496
As a parent of two teens, I am distressed by the number of teens with anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideations.

03:48:04.696 --> 03:48:12.742
And because of this, it is important to note the higher rates of suicide attempts by young people who are members of the LGBTQ plus community.

03:48:13.442 --> 03:48:18.243
I'm outraged at the opposition to a framework that is inclusive of all genders and sexualities.

03:48:18.443 --> 03:48:23.265
In my opinion, this is one of many ways that adults should be supportive of young people in our communities.

03:48:24.165 --> 03:48:29.746
Latinas and Latinos are often perceived as a monolithic group that is not supportive of sex ed, but that is not true.

03:48:30.407 --> 03:48:38.509
Findings from a survey we conducted revealed that the vast majority of Latina and Latino parents overwhelmingly support access to comprehensive sexuality education at school.

03:48:39.309 --> 03:48:49.955
We understand that just because young people are learning about sexuality doesn't mean they will choose to have sex, but it does open the door for whole families to be equipped with facts and engage in honest, open conversations.

03:48:50.035 --> 03:48:50.295
Thank you.

03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:56.490
Greetings.

03:48:56.530 --> 03:49:00.751
Hello, my name is Sherry Grevin and I'm the Public Affairs Director for Planned Parenthood Marmonte.

03:49:01.312 --> 03:49:06.713
I would first like to thank the Framework Committee for providing the guidance administrators and parents are asking for.

03:49:07.313 --> 03:49:11.715
Our Planned Parenthood health educators see and hear this in the classroom every day.

03:49:12.375 --> 03:49:16.436
Feedback often received from teachers includes, wish we had this when I was younger.

03:49:16.456 --> 03:49:18.417
This is so needed, thank you.

03:49:18.877 --> 03:49:21.638
This is especially needed for students who won't hear this at home.

03:49:22.438 --> 03:49:31.121
And at a parent learning session just last night, a father of a sixth grader said that this instruction helped open a line of communication between he and his son.

03:49:32.322 --> 03:49:38.104
You are making this a reality, and the framework that was so diligently created enjoys widespread grassroots support.

03:49:38.504 --> 03:49:48.908
In the past week alone, Planned Parenthood affiliates in California collected nearly 1,800 signatures from students, parents, teachers, and providers across California in support of the framework.

03:49:49.688 --> 03:49:51.190
Sex education is essential.

03:49:51.871 --> 03:49:53.894
Children need it to make healthy decisions.

03:49:54.274 --> 03:49:58.560
Together we could make sure all California students get the sex education they need and deserve.

03:49:58.860 --> 03:49:59.121
Thank you.

03:50:04.758 --> 03:50:06.299
Hello, my name is Monica Miranda.

03:50:06.439 --> 03:50:09.019
I'm the regional program manager with Plant Parenthood Marmonte.

03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:10.000
Thank you for your time.

03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:27.406
I'm here to advocate on behalf of the youth and the teachers and the parents, but especially for the youth who not only deserve medically accurate information, but developmentally appropriate and culturally specific such education at all levels.

03:50:28.666 --> 03:50:30.527
Youth students, they have questions.

03:50:30.767 --> 03:50:31.907
They want to know about their bodies.

03:50:32.228 --> 03:50:36.029
They have questions about their health overall, and they need to be supported.

03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:40.111
They need to have knowledge that's provided to them in a safe and inclusive space.

03:50:41.124 --> 03:50:50.208
I've been working in this field for about 10 years, and I can say that parents and teachers alike are supportive of this information as well.

03:50:51.248 --> 03:50:52.289
They're looking for tools.

03:50:52.409 --> 03:50:54.530
This framework is going to be a tool for them.

03:50:54.590 --> 03:51:01.653
It's going to be a guide for them in navigating and creating those spaces that are going to be safe and inclusive and based off of knowledge.

03:51:02.893 --> 03:51:06.915
I'd like to thank you for your time again and ask that you vote in favor of the framework.

03:51:06.935 --> 03:51:06.995
Tom.

03:51:07.435 --> 03:51:07.735
Thank you.

03:51:09.056 --> 03:51:16.051
We'd like to ask speakers 16 through 30 to please enter the boardroom and we would like speaker numbers 31 through 45 to line up.

03:51:19.451 --> 03:51:22.753
Young Californians deserve education that will keep them healthy and safe.

03:51:23.213 --> 03:51:24.554
This statement should not be controversial.

03:51:24.574 --> 03:51:26.855
Can you tell us your name, please, and who you represent?

03:51:27.056 --> 03:51:36.621
On behalf of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, Elizabeth Wells, thank you to the State Board of Education for your work to provide inclusive, evidence-based, age-appropriate health education for educators.

03:51:37.102 --> 03:51:39.003
Sex education is education.

03:51:39.423 --> 03:51:50.245
As you'll see in our letter of support, it is essential to young people's health, relationships, and life goals and will empower California students with the education necessary to make healthy decisions about their relationships, their health, and their futures.

03:51:50.946 --> 03:51:53.126
Sex education is supported across California.

03:51:53.346 --> 03:51:55.787
We've seen the successful passage of the California Healthy Youth Act.

03:51:55.947 --> 03:52:01.368
And in the past week alone, Planned Parenthood affiliates collected over 1,800 signatures from Californians in support of the framework.

03:52:02.128 --> 03:52:07.595
Sex education is crucial in California schools, especially when we're faced with an STI epidemic in California.

03:52:08.076 --> 03:52:14.063
In support of the work done by Planned Parenthood health centers and educators, we urge you to support an inclusive framework for students statewide.

03:52:14.183 --> 03:52:14.484
Thank you.

03:52:21.052 --> 03:52:29.160
Good afternoon, my name is Cindy Cruz and I'm the Director of Education for Planned Parenthood California Central Coast and I'm here in support of the health education framework.

03:52:29.601 --> 03:52:38.770
Good sex education covers a wide range of topics including healthy relationships, communication and consent, gender identity, birth control and sexually transmitted infections.

03:52:39.251 --> 03:52:44.376
Young people have the right to access the information that they need to be able to stay safe and protect their health.

03:52:44.776 --> 03:52:54.100
This is especially important for low-income and communities of color who experience inequitable access to healthcare, health disparities, systemic discrimination, and poverty.

03:52:54.640 --> 03:53:03.344
Sex education is essential for young people to be able to become healthy human beings who can make well-informed decisions about their health, their relationship, and their futures.

03:53:03.804 --> 03:53:11.968
Having experienced an unhealthy relationship myself, I know firsthand how important it is to talk to young people about the warning signs of unhealthy relationships.

03:53:12.388 --> 03:53:20.094
These are experiences that stay with you for the rest of your life and having access to this information at a young age would have made a big difference in mine.

03:53:20.594 --> 03:53:24.236
The framework will empower our young people and I urge you to vote in support.

03:53:24.477 --> 03:53:24.797
Thank you.

03:53:29.580 --> 03:53:33.122
Linda Cohn, retired teacher, 32 years, former debate coach.

03:53:35.244 --> 03:53:39.627
I fought Common Core, but you were too powerful, plus we had the race to the top monies.

03:53:40.327 --> 03:53:47.292
I tried to stop the data mining, but with ESSA and MTSS now, there's just too much money to be made in education.

03:53:47.833 --> 03:53:49.434
I'm trying now to stop CASEL.

03:53:50.114 --> 03:53:54.176
and the framework that it has of the victim-oppressor philosophy.

03:53:54.556 --> 03:53:59.858
But that's their agenda, and that's intersectionality for us, and now we have the framework.

03:54:00.158 --> 03:54:01.099
What more can I say?

03:54:01.859 --> 03:54:05.621
I know you're probably going to adopt this, and nothing I can say will stop you.

03:54:06.401 --> 03:54:15.947
But I can tell you with the agenda that you have, the power that you have, and the money that you have, the only thing that is going to stop you is the power of the voting public.

03:54:16.768 --> 03:54:22.752
And if that won't stop, we still have one trump card, trump card, our children.

03:54:23.412 --> 03:54:24.393
Thank you for your time.

03:54:33.289 --> 03:54:35.740
She wants to make her statement in Spanish.

03:54:36.242 --> 03:54:37.950
She doesn't want interpretation.

03:54:39.912 --> 03:54:40.592
Quiero mi tiempo.

03:54:41.513 --> 03:54:42.133
Buenas tardes.

03:54:42.513 --> 03:54:43.874
Mi nombre es Sarah Garcia Paez.

03:54:44.054 --> 03:54:45.574
Trabajo como educadora de salud.

03:54:46.195 --> 03:54:53.278
Quiero expresar mi apoyo para el Health Education Framework porque puedo afirmar la importancia de proveer educación comprensiva de salud.

03:54:54.038 --> 03:54:59.880
Cada día que tengo el privilegio de enseñar a estudiantes californianos, recibo comentarios de agradecimiento.

03:55:00.541 --> 03:55:03.062
Ellos siempre tienen muchas preguntas y curiosidad.

03:55:04.342 --> 03:55:13.809
eh, ya que nuestros jóvenes están siendo expuestos a materiales que tocan el tema, a veces sin contexto, sin nuestro permiso y sin nuestro conocimiento.

03:55:14.589 --> 03:55:17.971
Ellos necesitan educadores y administradores bien capacitados.

03:55:18.512 --> 03:55:30.620
Con esta herramienta, ellos serán un recurso confiable y podrán proveer educación médicamente factual basada en la realidad y que honra la existencia de todas las personas.

03:55:31.660 --> 03:55:33.922
Les urjo que voten por el Health Education Framework.

03:55:34.227 --> 03:55:34.473
Thank you.

03:55:42.076 --> 03:55:42.636
Good morning.

03:55:42.696 --> 03:55:48.999
My name is Rachel Henry, and I am the Outreach and Training Institute Director at the Sacramento LGBT Community Center.

03:55:49.019 --> 03:55:54.641
I'm here today on behalf of the center and in support of the health education framework for California public schools.

03:55:55.361 --> 03:56:06.045
All students have a right to accurate, inclusive, and representative health education, and several studies show us that far too often LGBTQ plus students do not have access to this education.

03:56:06.465 --> 03:56:12.211
This leaves many of our youth feeling invisible in the classroom and without the knowledge to make informed decisions for themselves.

03:56:12.671 --> 03:56:19.437
I know I myself would have greatly benefited from education like this when I was in high school and when I came out and experienced bullying.

03:56:20.398 --> 03:56:30.508
Not only would this health education framework address this disparity for some of our most marginalized students, but it would also provide all students the opportunity to learn within an inclusive and diverse classroom.

03:56:30.928 --> 03:56:37.241
Thank you for your time and your commitment to ensuring that all California students have access to the health education that they deserve.

03:56:44.144 --> 03:56:44.684
Good afternoon.

03:56:45.505 --> 03:56:52.728
My name is Rick Oculto, and I am the Education Director at Our Family Coalition, a statewide nonprofit that serves LGBTQ families with children.

03:56:53.628 --> 03:56:59.231
We believe that every family should have the right to determine for themselves what is appropriate for their children to learn about sexual health.

03:56:59.911 --> 03:57:10.976
As Director Gregson said earlier, the provision for opting out of any material concerning pregnancy, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, and the function of sexual organs already exists in the California Education Code.

03:57:11.836 --> 03:57:17.142
If we are to be the land of the free, then we must be the land of the educated and the informed.

03:57:17.742 --> 03:57:21.166
Any true convictions would not waver at the mere prospect of more information.

03:57:21.566 --> 03:57:24.089
Only fear and doubt produce anxiety over knowledge.

03:57:24.589 --> 03:57:34.339
Just as any student and any family has the right to say no, we must be responsible in giving those families and students who want to be better informed about their health the ability to say yes.

03:57:35.300 --> 03:57:39.603
Our children are not made safer by ignorance and we can no longer afford the consequences.

03:57:40.324 --> 03:57:48.089
Thank you for the provisions about LGBTQ health in the framework and ensuring that every student and family has the information they need to keep themselves safe.

03:57:56.775 --> 03:57:57.355
Good afternoon.

03:57:58.036 --> 03:58:02.639
My name is Denise Persha and I think it's kind of an oxymoron.

03:58:03.579 --> 03:58:04.200
Let me explain.

03:58:05.805 --> 03:58:12.409
Stephanie Gregson says that parents have the ultimate responsibility for imparting their beliefs.

03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:20.233
And then Planned Parenthood says, and I quote, but children won't hear it at home.

03:58:20.933 --> 03:58:26.196
Well, maybe children won't hear it at home because their parents don't want them to know it.

03:58:27.017 --> 03:58:29.018
To me, that sounds like a oxymoron.

03:58:30.339 --> 03:58:38.666
Page number 61 of 119 of your frameworks lists a book called SEX, The All You Need to Know.

03:58:39.587 --> 03:58:43.090
Let me list for you just some of the topics in that book.

03:58:44.130 --> 03:58:45.530
so that you know what we're talking about.

03:58:46.151 --> 03:58:48.512
Not only you, but the public at large.

03:58:49.252 --> 03:58:55.274
Kinky sex, bondage, restraint, body fluids, and sex toys.

03:58:55.874 --> 03:59:00.015
I want to know who recommended that book to be placed in frameworks.

03:59:00.336 --> 03:59:00.496
Time.

03:59:00.516 --> 03:59:00.696
Time.

03:59:00.976 --> 03:59:01.536
Rejected framework.

03:59:08.220 --> 03:59:12.504
Good afternoon, Madam President and Board of Education.

03:59:13.004 --> 03:59:14.265
My name is Mary Chavez.

03:59:14.625 --> 03:59:21.751
I'm a parent, a grandparent, and a school library and media assistant in Montebello Unified, which is in LA County.

03:59:23.513 --> 03:59:25.874
I was school age in the 1960s.

03:59:26.715 --> 03:59:28.236
I thought God made a mistake.

03:59:28.917 --> 03:59:30.798
I thought I was supposed to be a boy.

03:59:31.799 --> 03:59:33.240
Why did I think that?

03:59:33.921 --> 03:59:36.063
Because I like doing yard work.

03:59:37.330 --> 03:59:38.791
I liked that push mower.

03:59:39.031 --> 03:59:42.313
You pushed it and brought it back and it would spin.

03:59:42.874 --> 03:59:47.037
And it was, to me, it was a great technology for that age.

03:59:48.177 --> 03:59:52.600
And so based on that, I thought I should have been a boy.

03:59:52.800 --> 03:59:58.684
But under this framework, I would be encouraged to take hormones which are known to cause infertility.

03:59:59.285 --> 04:00:06.730
I would not be able to be the mother of five wonderful children and four awesome grandchildren whom bring such joy to my life.

04:00:07.552 --> 04:00:10.043
Please listen to this verse time.

04:00:10.063 --> 04:00:11.489
Thank you

04:00:21.539 --> 04:00:24.360
Hi, good afternoon, honorable board members of education.

04:00:25.200 --> 04:00:27.940
I am Alexandria Aguilar from Long Beach, California.

04:00:28.480 --> 04:00:31.361
I'm a mother and an aunt and loving friend to all.

04:00:31.941 --> 04:00:40.303
And I'm here to speak against the health framework being implemented after reading the instructional materials.

04:00:41.063 --> 04:00:48.044
But I because it made me sick to my stomach knowing that perverted instructions materials were going to be taught to our children.

04:00:48.224 --> 04:00:50.305
But I just heard that they are going to remove these books.

04:00:50.805 --> 04:00:52.286
I thank you for moving those books.

04:00:53.847 --> 04:01:02.751
And I just thank you that because they were very explicit, explicit and pornographic and we had a lot of graphic sex acts in there.

04:01:03.552 --> 04:01:07.874
So I just want to thank you for your time and for giving me the time to speak.

04:01:08.775 --> 04:01:09.115
God bless.

04:01:16.570 --> 04:01:17.651
My name is Linda.

04:01:17.871 --> 04:01:23.913
I'd like to address the framework chapter 4, grades 4 to 6, page 62.

04:01:24.274 --> 04:01:26.595
The topic of masturbation is introduced.

04:01:27.075 --> 04:01:31.077
This topic is not appropriate nor necessary to teach at school.

04:01:31.097 --> 04:01:31.177
Page 78.

04:01:34.946 --> 04:01:41.608
Again, grades four through six, teaching children online resources to learn about gender transitioning.

04:01:42.068 --> 04:01:44.289
These are nine to 11 year olds.

04:01:45.209 --> 04:01:47.410
Chapter five, grades seven and eight.

04:01:47.950 --> 04:01:53.872
Page 33 talks about barrier method demonstration using condoms and dental dams.

04:01:54.492 --> 04:01:58.733
Showing examples and then students practice on a penis model.

04:01:59.954 --> 04:02:03.715
It discusses the uses of dental dams for anal or oral sex.

04:02:05.236 --> 04:02:11.724
This framework is indoctrinating and normalizing sexual behavior beginning in TK.

04:02:11.904 --> 04:02:13.987
You are sexualizing minors.

04:02:14.888 --> 04:02:18.993
The recommended books, which thank you that they are being removed.

04:02:27.489 --> 04:02:28.169
Good afternoon.

04:02:28.449 --> 04:02:37.252
I'm Rick Loya, Executive Vice President of the California Association of School Health Educators, and I urge you to adopt the health education framework.

04:02:37.912 --> 04:02:41.754
The current framework is dated 2003, albeit it contains the content of the 1994 framework.

04:02:45.695 --> 04:02:49.238
It's so old, many sections are inconsistent with current law.

04:02:49.739 --> 04:03:01.429
A quarter of a century is just too old for a framework that is mandated to have the current thinking and knowledge, especially when it comes to meeting the needs of health instruction of LGBTQ students.

04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:08.815
I've been a Methodist for over 60 years, and it seems to me that effective school health education is what we find in John.

04:03:09.375 --> 04:03:14.059
I have come in order that you may have life, life at all its fullest.

04:03:14.679 --> 04:03:23.727
The Western jurisdiction of the Methodist Church has said, we believe in the diversity of the whole human family with all its cultures and sexual identities.

04:03:24.127 --> 04:03:27.129
We believe we are made better with greater diversity.

04:03:27.630 --> 04:03:29.551
I urge you to adopt the framework- Time.

04:03:30.852 --> 04:03:32.893
and also the health ed requirements someday.

04:03:32.953 --> 04:03:33.213
Time.

04:03:36.735 --> 04:03:44.779
We would like to ask speakers 31 through 45 to please enter the boardroom so they can speak and we would like numbers 46 through 60 to line up.

04:03:53.863 --> 04:03:57.467
I'm Jerry Lieberman, Director of the State Education and Environment Roundtable.

04:03:57.487 --> 04:04:15.546
I've had the privilege of working with the State Board, the Department of Ed, the IQC over the last 16 years as California's environmental principles and concepts were adopted and most recently placed into Ed Code so that they could be taught to all students.

04:04:16.187 --> 04:04:31.811
The health education framework includes a good section and raises many of the issues that are really important in terms of access and equity in regard to where students live, the water they drink, the air they breathe.

04:04:32.451 --> 04:04:42.894
So I urge you to include the environmental principles and concepts, support the framework as has been done in the history social science framework and the science framework.

04:04:43.435 --> 04:04:47.929
offers a great opportunity for integration of education for all of our students.

04:04:48.551 --> 04:04:48.872
Thank you.

04:05:01.192 --> 04:05:03.014
Hi, I'm a public school teacher.

04:05:03.754 --> 04:05:07.337
I fear this controversial framework will jeopardize thousands of teachers' jobs.

04:05:07.357 --> 04:05:09.079
I teach in a district that is decreasing in enrollment.

04:05:09.099 --> 04:05:12.321
This framework could cause an exodus out of public education.

04:05:24.111 --> 04:05:30.916
I have shown my educational peers the book, Who Are You?, which says kids can be both genders using the pronoun they, them, or theirs, or neither gender.

04:05:31.357 --> 04:05:33.879
Teachers are shocked and appalled when they see and hear this.

04:05:34.239 --> 04:05:35.700
They are also afraid.

04:05:36.120 --> 04:05:43.226
They are afraid that they may be forced to teach concepts that go against their conscience because they believe these concepts are harmful to children.

04:05:43.826 --> 04:05:52.871
They are afraid that if they refuse to use non-binary neutral pronouns suggested in the framework, such as they, them, or theirs, they could be accused of discrimination and lose their jobs.

04:05:53.651 --> 04:05:54.732
Reject the framework.

04:05:55.032 --> 04:05:56.353
We'll save teachers' jobs.

04:05:56.733 --> 04:05:57.053
Thank you.

04:06:05.248 --> 04:06:06.749
Stephanie Yates, mother of three.

04:06:07.289 --> 04:06:08.430
I'll just get straight to the point.

04:06:08.450 --> 04:06:13.953
I don't think any single one of you is fit to have any say in a child.

04:06:14.053 --> 04:06:18.116
You should not have any contact with a child.

04:06:18.516 --> 04:06:18.816
Why?

04:06:19.196 --> 04:06:20.197
Child pornography.

04:06:20.417 --> 04:06:21.317
Can you show them, please?

04:06:21.718 --> 04:06:23.619
Child pornography, adult pornography.

04:06:23.879 --> 04:06:31.623
You think it's fit to teach our children fisting where you insert your fist in somebody's anus or vagina?

04:06:32.004 --> 04:06:34.105
You think body fluid and blood play.

04:06:35.586 --> 04:06:45.095
Some people enjoy any number of body fluids, sexually ejaculate, vaginal fluids, menses, which is periods, urine, or blood.

04:06:45.495 --> 04:06:49.419
They may simply enjoy tasting, feeling, or smelling them during sexual activities.

04:06:49.799 --> 04:06:52.782
Maybe you guys want to do that, but not with our kids.

04:06:53.062 --> 04:06:53.883
You think it's funny?

04:06:54.123 --> 04:06:54.944
We don't think it's funny.

04:06:55.004 --> 04:07:01.390
We have a whole group of parents out here that say it's not funny, and that's why you're even talking about removing these books.

04:07:01.750 --> 04:07:07.398
but the fact that you even decided to have these books and think it was okay for our kids, that's not okay.

04:07:07.418 --> 04:07:07.499
Time.

04:07:09.542 --> 04:07:11.004
We reject the California- Time.

04:07:18.795 --> 04:07:25.581
Matthew McReynolds, senior staff attorney of the Pacific Justice Institute in strong opposition to the framework.

04:07:26.722 --> 04:07:37.331
I would direct you to the letter that we sent to the state board in January, which has extensive quotes and citations of what we oppose.

04:07:37.411 --> 04:07:39.152
Two points in particular.

04:07:39.793 --> 04:07:44.737
One, don't give free advertising to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood.

04:07:45.237 --> 04:07:46.038
in our framework.

04:07:46.559 --> 04:07:59.616
Two, don't confuse students and teachers about the important concept of abuse by lumping spiritual abuse, technological abuse, and financial abuse in with physical and sexual abuse.

04:08:00.136 --> 04:08:00.497
Thank you.

04:08:13.649 --> 04:08:15.230
Hi, my name is Thomas Cota.

04:08:16.730 --> 04:08:24.413
The Healthy Education Framework is a document of indoctrination into sexual education, not education.

04:08:25.274 --> 04:08:40.420
At a time where California schools, K through 12, are ranked in the lowest in our nation in reading, writing, math, and science, we're going to be the leaders in sexual education?

04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:44.212
We failed our children in educating them to read and write.

04:08:44.652 --> 04:08:46.414
We need to do that first.

04:08:47.495 --> 04:08:59.727
The Institutional Equality Commission failed to address thousands of parents' concerns about the framework, about the material in the framework, about the content.

04:08:59.887 --> 04:09:01.128
They just omitted it.

04:09:01.588 --> 04:09:05.172
But yet they accepted a lot of the LGBT comments.

04:09:06.533 --> 04:09:15.842
Please do not be a party to committing to our students to failure, to sexual indoctrination, and to promoting unhealthy choices.

04:09:16.362 --> 04:09:16.623
Time.

04:09:16.643 --> 04:09:16.723
Time.

04:09:23.595 --> 04:09:24.756
Good afternoon, board members.

04:09:24.796 --> 04:09:25.936
My name is Linda Cota.

04:09:26.457 --> 04:09:38.363
The proposed framework is not medically accurate because it does not address all known health risks, like the increased risk of suicide, the failure rate of condoms, and the lasting impacts of STDs.

04:09:38.923 --> 04:09:43.246
Parents have a hard time getting kids to wear other protective gear, like bike helmets.

04:09:43.866 --> 04:09:47.948
What do you think kids will do if they don't have what Chaya promotes as protective gear?

04:09:48.528 --> 04:09:50.849
The proposed framework is not age appropriate.

04:09:51.289 --> 04:09:55.771
Does drawing cartoons in a children's book make pornographic images age appropriate?

04:09:56.151 --> 04:09:56.371
No.

04:09:56.951 --> 04:10:01.093
It triggers curiosity and what they're being tempted to do is illegal at their age.

04:10:01.753 --> 04:10:09.757
Chapter 3 for the TK through grade 3 in the framework states that students are targeted in ads for breakfast foods, particularly breakfast cereals.

04:10:10.317 --> 04:10:15.339
The advertisements are often make the foods look fun and look like they're good for them.

04:10:16.040 --> 04:10:17.500
That's what this framework is doing.

04:10:17.740 --> 04:10:22.022
Chapter 4 for grades 4 through 6 is on the dangers of smoking.

04:10:22.483 --> 04:10:24.864
People know that smoking is harmful, but many still do it.

04:10:24.884 --> 04:10:25.144
Time.

04:10:36.601 --> 04:10:45.127
Hi there, my name is Sarah Hyde and I'm the Youth Services Coordinator at a domestic violence agency that's based in Fremont called Safe Alternatives to Violent Environments.

04:10:45.747 --> 04:10:56.475
I'm in Alameda County public high schools and middle schools every single week and specifically I work on a federal grant to work with queer and trans students to prevent dating violence.

04:10:56.975 --> 04:10:58.757
I'm also a certified sex educator.

04:10:59.077 --> 04:11:04.641
I wanted to say thank you so much for your support of the health framework and tell you a few anecdotes.

04:11:04.741 --> 04:11:13.528
So just last week, a student left me an anonymous note thanking me for including examples of queer and trans relationships in my presentation.

04:11:13.869 --> 04:11:16.651
And they said they didn't get enough of that in their class from their teacher.

04:11:16.671 --> 04:11:21.475
A teacher told me on Monday that I'm the most open presenter that her class hears.

04:11:21.995 --> 04:11:26.279
And I can't teach every single health class in our state.

04:11:26.639 --> 04:11:28.761
That's why our teachers need these resources.

04:11:29.141 --> 04:11:31.403
For them, they're feeling a little bit overwhelmed.

04:11:31.463 --> 04:11:35.246
They might not know how to answer all students' questions about gender identity.

04:11:35.666 --> 04:11:39.169
And this is a framework that will provide them the support they need.

04:11:39.369 --> 04:11:39.809
Thank you.

04:11:43.412 --> 04:11:44.093
Good afternoon.

04:11:44.113 --> 04:11:47.876
Sheila Whitley speaking on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

04:11:49.517 --> 04:12:03.145
The California Teachers Association has long supported the work of the Instructional Quality Association to draft curriculum frameworks which will guide instructional decisions concerning what students should know and be able to do.

04:12:03.885 --> 04:12:07.827
CTA members reviewed the draft health education framework.

04:12:08.367 --> 04:12:17.733
Two CTA committees, both curriculum and instruction and civil rights and education, reviewed and provided feedback to the IQC about this framework.

04:12:18.653 --> 04:12:28.175
CTA appreciates that the framework reflects the state's expansive definitions of the foundational elements of health literacy.

04:12:29.655 --> 04:12:41.878
Comprehensive health education teaches fundamental health concepts, promotes habits and behaviors that enhance health and wellness, and guides efforts to build healthy families, relationships, schools, and communities.

04:12:42.378 --> 04:12:42.718
Thank you.

04:12:52.059 --> 04:12:53.140
Hi, my name is Michelle New.

04:12:54.401 --> 04:13:02.408
I just first wanted to say that this framework I'm asking you to not adopt it, that this is early sexualization of our kids and is bad policy.

04:13:03.029 --> 04:13:07.933
It's a state-sanctioned exploitation of our children, and it's about marginalizing people.

04:13:08.314 --> 04:13:13.559
We're not trying to, but it's just defending and trying to get rid of this bad policy that you have.

04:13:14.159 --> 04:13:28.411
You guys keep mentioning how this is for everyone and that this is what all students need to hear, but I'm not understanding why whether it be LGBT or any other group would need to hear, excuse me, need to hear about masturbation.

04:13:28.951 --> 04:13:43.163
And I'm looking right here at a recommendation that Planned Parenthood made and you accepted, saying masturbation should be included in the curriculum to be addressed in a straightforward manner instead of waiting for the possibility of masturbation being brought up by a student.

04:13:43.783 --> 04:13:50.056
And so I'm asking you, why is this a healthy subject for you to bring up to a student?

04:13:50.898 --> 04:13:53.864
What makes this framework so wonderful that you need time?

04:14:02.014 --> 04:14:03.636
Hi, my name is David Alabran.

04:14:03.656 --> 04:14:05.598
I have a PhD in clinical psychology.

04:14:05.658 --> 04:14:09.241
I've done gay affirmative and gay corrective therapy for over 25 years.

04:14:09.982 --> 04:14:13.666
And I can tell you, the only people who support this are people in the gay community and trans community.

04:14:13.706 --> 04:14:17.350
All your other medical experts and everybody outside that field do not support this.

04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:26.733
For example, Michelle Krutera, president of the American College of Pediatrics, is wholeheartedly against the sex ed and social emotional framework program.

04:14:26.753 --> 04:14:39.156
She states, as one of the top experts in the country, institutions that promote gender transition affirmations are engaging in nothing less than institutional child abuse that can afflict untold psychological damage on children.

04:14:39.936 --> 04:14:45.138
Paul McHugh, distinguished chief of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine says,

04:14:45.778 --> 04:14:48.941
Transgender is a psychosocial problem and not a biological problem.

04:14:49.261 --> 04:14:53.165
There's a mental illness that needs to be treated as such and you're not born in the wrong body.

04:14:53.265 --> 04:15:02.253
And there are tons of transgender people that say, I got screwed over by all these institutions that supported this instead of helping me straighten this stuff out.

04:15:03.114 --> 04:15:03.975
The curriculum... Time.

04:15:03.995 --> 04:15:04.255
Time.

04:15:14.858 --> 04:15:16.919
Hello, my name is America Figueroa.

04:15:17.019 --> 04:15:17.920
I'm a mother of five.

04:15:18.260 --> 04:15:28.566
Chapter one of the framework states, students will explore and discover their identities, gender expression, and sexuality throughout their education and into and beyond their high school years.

04:15:29.027 --> 04:15:33.669
I'm a Mexican immigrant, and my culture holds strong moral and family values.

04:15:33.930 --> 04:15:37.392
We teach our children to only explore sexuality with their spouse.

04:15:37.952 --> 04:15:42.475
This framework claims to be inclusive, but in reality, it is exclusive to a small community.

04:15:42.835 --> 04:15:49.379
And it is inclusive to a small community and excludes those of us from cultures with strong values.

04:15:49.819 --> 04:15:54.442
As a taxpaying citizen of this state, I respectfully ask you to please reject this framework.

04:15:54.762 --> 04:16:06.269
Today, you have the opportunity to go down in history as the board who stood up for children and sided with families, or as the board responsible for the sexualization and corruption of an entire generation.

04:16:06.489 --> 04:16:06.749
Thank you.

04:16:11.943 --> 04:16:13.044
Good morning, I'm Rodrigo Montenegro.

04:16:13.064 --> 04:16:17.570
I've driven for nine hours, but I think it's very important to be here with you guys because I'm representing my grandsons.

04:16:29.065 --> 04:16:31.906
I have sons and daughters that I married.

04:16:31.966 --> 04:16:35.228
And I think that this framework is a mistake.

04:16:35.328 --> 04:16:37.349
It doesn't have any common sense.

04:16:37.409 --> 04:16:41.030
It steals the identity to our daughters and teenagers.

04:16:41.130 --> 04:16:44.672
It steals the principles and values.

04:16:44.752 --> 04:16:49.574
And I consider it is a big mistake, at least how you're managing it.

04:16:49.674 --> 04:16:53.756
I hope you consider my opinion because this is far away from bringing a healthy society.

04:16:58.698 --> 04:17:08.142
Anything that is not normal, anything that is not correct brings bad consequences to society.

04:17:08.202 --> 04:17:10.584
I hope you take in mind my words.

04:17:10.624 --> 04:17:11.264
Thank you very much.

04:17:20.407 --> 04:17:23.388
Hi, my name is Heather Gibson, and I have a seven-year-old child.

04:17:24.128 --> 04:17:28.108
The paper that you received is a book that was recommended for removal.

04:17:28.188 --> 04:17:29.269
It's called Changing You.

04:17:29.769 --> 04:17:33.109
But this book, It's Not the Stork, was not recommended for removal.

04:17:33.789 --> 04:17:37.190
This shows a picture of a man and a woman on top of each other.

04:17:37.310 --> 04:17:42.991
And it says, the man and the woman get so close to each other that the man's penis goes inside a woman's vagina.

04:17:43.851 --> 04:17:46.031
Why does my eight-year-old need to know that?

04:17:46.692 --> 04:17:48.792
She does not need to know that, especially from school.

04:17:49.472 --> 04:17:52.954
Here, it shows a girl checking out her own genitals.

04:17:54.295 --> 04:17:55.316
This is pornography.

04:17:56.276 --> 04:17:57.357
I do not approve of this.

04:17:57.617 --> 04:18:00.579
My daughter does not need to see cartoon pornography.

04:18:01.159 --> 04:18:04.161
Here is another picture of a boy checking out his parts.

04:18:04.742 --> 04:18:08.784
It shows an uncircumcised penis and a circumcised penis.

04:18:09.725 --> 04:18:10.725
This is not okay.

04:18:12.046 --> 04:18:17.514
My children should not have to be subject to these kinds of materials in school.

04:18:18.235 --> 04:18:21.299
I can discuss things with my children when they're ready.

04:18:21.319 --> 04:18:25.104
And as I feel that as a parent, that is my right.

04:18:25.244 --> 04:18:26.566
Sex should be taught at home.

04:18:28.748 --> 04:18:29.029
Time.

04:18:29.049 --> 04:18:29.129
Time.

04:18:32.355 --> 04:18:39.181
Doctors, psychologists, politicians, parents, and the public at large cannot agree on these complex issues that are addressed in the framework.

04:18:39.281 --> 04:18:43.085
So it is wholly unreasonable to believe six-year-olds can or should be expected to.

04:18:43.525 --> 04:18:48.210
We as adults can take in information and process it with the ability to decipher what we agree and disagree with.

04:18:48.650 --> 04:18:51.733
Their brains are not developed enough to process this information in this way.

04:18:52.434 --> 04:18:56.537
One of my four children is almost six and will believe just about anything I or his teacher tell him.

04:18:57.398 --> 04:19:04.986
He cannot be expected to understand or make decisions about information like this, especially when there is information given to him that has no scientific basis to support it.

04:19:05.006 --> 04:19:07.509
This is why it is my job as a parent to protect him.

04:19:07.669 --> 04:19:10.172
It is the job of every parent, no matter your beliefs.

04:19:10.912 --> 04:19:17.980
Beyond this, at a more basic level, the government does not have the right to force any of its citizens to accept beliefs or live their life in a way that they do not agree with.

04:19:18.440 --> 04:19:20.343
This is the basis of our Constitution.

04:19:20.724 --> 04:19:21.685
This is not education.

04:19:21.705 --> 04:19:24.670
It is not within the boundaries or responsibilities of our educators.

04:19:24.970 --> 04:19:27.133
This is a political agenda and needs to be rejected.

04:19:27.213 --> 04:19:27.514
Thank you.

04:19:31.872 --> 04:19:32.972
Hello, my name is Yuri.

04:19:33.032 --> 04:19:35.873
I'm a parent of two, and I'm also a registered nurse.

04:19:35.913 --> 04:19:37.393
I just want to bring up two points.

04:19:38.394 --> 04:19:47.976
First, the book for first graders, It's Not The Stork, includes graphic naked body parts of girls and boys and describes what sex is and how babies are made.

04:19:48.596 --> 04:19:54.878
Why does the state of California think that it is age appropriate for parents to read this to their seven-year-old children?

04:19:55.438 --> 04:19:56.858
I think it's too much and too soon.

04:19:57.258 --> 04:19:59.579
So I recommend remove this book from the framework.

04:20:00.566 --> 04:20:13.733
And another book, Who Are You?, is a book that introduces seven-year-olds to the concept that there are over 11 different gender, including trans, genderqueer, non-binary, genderfluid, agender, and two-spirit.

04:20:14.093 --> 04:20:15.994
This is not age-appropriate material.

04:20:16.114 --> 04:20:21.837
This book goes against my deeply held religious belief that there are only two genders.

04:20:22.337 --> 04:20:24.619
The state must respect my religious beliefs.

04:20:25.179 --> 04:20:26.680
Remove this book from the framework.

04:20:26.960 --> 04:20:27.260
Thank you.

04:20:32.554 --> 04:20:34.975
Hello, I'm Vicki Stanton from Orange County.

04:20:34.995 --> 04:20:37.555
I have a question for the board members.

04:20:38.015 --> 04:20:40.576
Have you read the entire framework?

04:20:41.876 --> 04:20:43.917
Have you seen the suggested books?

04:20:44.937 --> 04:20:45.877
Here's an example.

04:20:46.778 --> 04:20:49.118
Color the tip of the clitoris blue.

04:20:50.058 --> 04:20:56.180
This is an actual lesson for co-ed seventh graders in the Twin Rivers District.

04:20:57.220 --> 04:21:06.088
I personally know taxpaying families that have either left California or are considering leaving because of this framework.

04:21:06.869 --> 04:21:22.502
As a former California teacher, homeschool resource teacher, and especially as a grandmother, I promise to help as many people as possible begin homeschooling if you choose to promote this early sexualization, grooming, and child abuse.

04:21:27.079 --> 04:21:40.235
Hi, you have before you a printout of a recommended book, What's Happening to My Body for Boys, and I saw that you recommended to remove these books, but I'd like you to say the book for boys and the book for girls.

04:21:40.436 --> 04:21:42.018
There's two of these sexual books.

04:21:42.638 --> 04:21:57.335
In Chapter 4, Grade 4, you say in the framework that teachers should normalize sexual feelings, and you actually added when the topic of masturbation is introduced or arises, meaning you want to teach masturbation to 10- and 11-year-olds.

04:21:59.197 --> 04:22:15.229
The teachers can explain what masturbation is and that it's safe or and it's not mentally harmful This book is introduced on page 61 and this book says that many boys engage in some form of what we call sex play With other boys as they're growing up.

04:22:15.289 --> 04:22:26.677
You may have had such experiences and boys can masturbate with other boys This is not appropriate material for 10 and 11 year olds and you need to take out Masturbation from the framework and remove all of the books.

04:22:26.817 --> 04:22:27.998
I reject the framework.

04:22:28.078 --> 04:22:28.438
Thank you

04:22:28.638 --> 04:22:28.918
time.

04:22:33.124 --> 04:22:36.468
Hi my name is Alina and I am a mom of two school aged kids.

04:22:37.929 --> 04:22:41.354
I disagree with the framework and that the school board is trying to implement.

04:22:41.894 --> 04:22:45.418
I know districts use the curriculum but this framework

04:22:46.482 --> 04:22:50.144
will influence publishers on what to put in the future textbooks.

04:22:50.624 --> 04:22:56.007
These are radical, culture-changing ideas that go against most people's wishes and beliefs.

04:22:56.648 --> 04:23:02.491
Please reject this framework and remove all the recommended books from the curriculum and respect the parents' rights.

04:23:02.671 --> 04:23:02.991
Thank you.

04:23:05.573 --> 04:23:11.976
We would like to ask speakers 46 through 60 to please enter the boardroom and speakers 61 through 75 to line up.

04:23:12.137 --> 04:23:12.397
Thank you.

04:23:21.020 --> 04:23:21.720
Members of the board.

04:23:22.721 --> 04:23:25.503
My name is Rick Wortman and I rise in opposition to this proposed framework.

04:23:25.643 --> 04:23:28.946
Please reject this framework.

04:23:28.986 --> 04:23:29.987
You've seen the examples.

04:23:30.547 --> 04:23:31.388
I've read the framework.

04:23:31.408 --> 04:23:31.808
Have you?

04:23:33.430 --> 04:23:34.671
I've read recommended works.

04:23:35.683 --> 04:23:37.064
Have you all read each of them?

04:23:37.685 --> 04:23:38.065
I have.

04:23:38.606 --> 04:23:43.030
CSE encourages acceptance and exploration of diverse sexual orientation and gender fluidity.

04:23:43.350 --> 04:23:47.994
It promotes high-risk sexual behavior, including anal and oral sex, and teaches them that they are safe.

04:23:48.515 --> 04:23:52.018
CSE promotes sexual pleasure and promiscuity as a right for children.

04:23:53.271 --> 04:23:56.774
CSE promotes condoms to children without informing them of their failure rates.

04:23:57.315 --> 04:24:00.438
CSE promotes disrespect for parents and religious and cultural values.

04:24:00.478 --> 04:24:05.403
CSE promotes sexual counseling and information or services to minors without parental consent.

04:24:06.083 --> 04:24:09.066
CSE trains children to advocate for their sexual rights.

04:24:10.387 --> 04:24:13.090
CSE encourages peer-to-peer sexuality education.

04:24:14.369 --> 04:24:17.914
In the words of the Lord's prophet Samuel, stop acting so proud and haughty.

04:24:18.494 --> 04:24:24.422
Don't speak with such arrogance, for the Lord is a God who knows what you have done, and He will judge you for that.

04:24:34.401 --> 04:24:37.442
all to please adopt this updated framework.

04:24:37.822 --> 04:24:50.185
I'm one of the many examples of how our education system lack of framework to include necessary information about LGBTQIA plus identities can be detrimental and failing us, if not engendering us.

04:24:50.245 --> 04:24:55.926
The environment during my formal education years was insidious and hostile against transgender people like myself.

04:24:57.066 --> 04:25:13.326
My high school principal, James Sefton, looked at me in my eyes and said, people cannot shut off the disgusting thing that you want to do, like it's an NBC TV show, what I wanted to perform in Drag for the Talent Show, where my Spanish teacher told me that gay people are going to hell and that they are not normal.

04:25:14.387 --> 04:25:29.983
Had it not been for my supportive parents, I wouldn't be standing here with you today as a self-actualized person, as a transgender woman who has been marginalized by this education system that has overcome much indoctrinated enmity and animosity from my peers and educators.

04:25:30.283 --> 04:25:30.984
I don't hate them.

04:25:31.124 --> 04:25:34.808
I pity them because they are ignorant of such necessary education.

04:25:36.009 --> 04:25:36.270
Time.

04:25:40.077 --> 04:25:40.317
Hello.

04:25:40.818 --> 04:25:44.460
People say I am misinformed, so I researched the framework and the advice... Your name, please.

04:25:44.881 --> 04:25:45.681
Please introduce yourself.

04:25:46.062 --> 04:25:46.562
Oh, okay.

04:25:47.103 --> 04:25:47.963
I get my time over again?

04:25:47.983 --> 04:25:48.584
Okay.

04:25:50.145 --> 04:25:50.325
Okay.

04:25:50.465 --> 04:25:53.788
Hello, my name is Mindy, and I'm a concerned parent.

04:25:54.008 --> 04:25:57.991
People say that I'm misinformed, so I researched the framework and the advice curriculum.

04:25:58.511 --> 04:26:02.635
Opting out is not a wise option because kids will be talking about everything on the playground.

04:26:03.275 --> 04:26:09.204
The framework requires information to be unbiased, but the curriculum advised by the state by this ed code is biased.

04:26:09.604 --> 04:26:18.938
I cannot sit back and let my kindergartner be taught that they can be a different gender, which is what the LGBT on their agenda is trying to do, sexualize our children.

04:26:19.578 --> 04:26:22.259
My heart is with the LGBT children who are bullied.

04:26:22.720 --> 04:26:27.062
But if your son grew up with this ideology and wanted to cut off his penis, would you be okay with that?

04:26:27.582 --> 04:26:28.002
I'm not.

04:26:28.622 --> 04:26:30.503
That is what is being encouraged by this framework.

04:26:30.943 --> 04:26:32.364
You have the power to stop this.

04:26:32.964 --> 04:26:38.007
If many people object this framework, it is best to look over it thoroughly and not just trust the presentation.

04:26:38.587 --> 04:26:44.834
The presentation of the framework says that there are many hearings that people are not being informed about this.

04:26:45.135 --> 04:26:47.277
There are too many objections to this framework to be passed.

04:26:47.357 --> 04:26:51.422
I'm a taxpayer and I urge you to reject the framework and come up with a more agreeable one.

04:26:51.602 --> 04:26:51.882
Time.

04:26:52.923 --> 04:26:53.164
Time.

04:27:00.066 --> 04:27:00.526
Good afternoon.

04:27:00.546 --> 04:27:01.306
My name is Jenny.

04:27:01.487 --> 04:27:02.327
I'm from Orange County.

04:27:03.147 --> 04:27:06.629
LA and Orange County has the highest Korean population in the United States.

04:27:06.729 --> 04:27:11.150
And here I am to represent all 305,000 Korean Americans who couldn't be here.

04:27:11.570 --> 04:27:17.853
We understand that health framework is just a guideline and are not ones creating the graphic curriculum being advised by the state.

04:27:18.433 --> 04:27:24.440
But the skyline is opening the doors to teaching highly sexographic curriculum that is advised by the state.

04:27:24.761 --> 04:27:28.786
Have you seen the state-advised curriculum like Brooke is perfectly normal?

04:27:29.186 --> 04:27:35.253
You are just helping the spious companies to bring in big bucks by sexualizing pure and innocent children.

04:27:35.854 --> 04:27:45.546
Please, before you pass this framework, consider having parents, teachers, variety of religion, background of people to create and come up with an agreed curriculum to offer to the district.

04:27:45.947 --> 04:27:52.155
Because right now, they only have a small pool to choose from and those are curated by LGBTQ.

04:27:52.515 --> 04:27:53.877
Please reject this framework.

04:27:54.097 --> 04:27:54.418
Thank you.

04:28:00.959 --> 04:28:02.820
Hello, I'm translating for her.

04:28:02.940 --> 04:28:05.242
She's going to be speaking in Korean.

04:28:06.303 --> 04:28:10.626
Hi, my name is Eunsil Kim.

04:28:11.587 --> 04:28:18.151
Planned Parenthood's special guest speaker, Anaheim District, told us how to use dental dams on a female model.

04:28:18.532 --> 04:28:23.475
She told us that we can get rid of a video of a female being molested and that we can get rid of it by using a countermeasure.

04:28:27.378 --> 04:28:33.460
It's what I taught in middle school, but I'm not going to teach you a curriculum like this in the framework I'm going to teach you from kindergarten.

04:28:33.480 --> 04:28:35.821
Please stop this framework.

04:28:35.881 --> 04:28:42.683
And we were going to meet and ask you to translate the Spur Intendant Tony Thurman framework into many languages.

04:28:42.703 --> 04:28:46.324
You didn't even pretend to see it and left in a car.

04:28:46.364 --> 04:28:48.864
Don't discriminate against minorities.

04:28:48.884 --> 04:28:53.446
Have we been able to see the framework for 60 days, which is over 1,000 pages?

04:28:53.466 --> 04:28:54.746
Don't do this without us.

04:28:57.807 --> 04:29:04.712
A guest speaker from Planned Parenthood came to our schools in Anaheim and pulled out a dental dam and explained to children how to perform sex on a penis model.

04:29:05.233 --> 04:29:09.636
They also showed a blurred video of a girl getting raped and explained how to get an abortion.

04:29:10.016 --> 04:29:11.497
This happened in junior high and high school.

04:29:11.837 --> 04:29:16.580
How do we trust that this explicit curriculum won't be taught starting kindergarten due to the framework?

04:29:17.001 --> 04:29:18.162
Please reject the framework.

04:29:18.502 --> 04:29:25.467
We asked Superintendent Tony Thurman to meet with us to translate the framework into different languages, but he just got into his car and drove off.

04:29:26.107 --> 04:29:29.032
Is 60 days long enough to review 1,000 pages of the framework?

04:29:29.393 --> 04:29:30.455
This is discrimination.

04:29:30.555 --> 04:29:33.841
Please do not exclude minority communities in the process of the framework.

04:29:34.562 --> 04:29:34.903
Thank you.

04:29:41.127 --> 04:29:42.028
Good morning, everyone.

04:29:42.088 --> 04:29:44.789
My name is Maura, and I'm a concerned parent of California.

04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:55.516
As I was reviewing the framework, Chapter 5 allows educators to use examples for spiritual abuse, using religion to justify abuse, insisting on a rigid gender roles.

04:29:56.676 --> 04:30:01.299
Last God created men and women to expand creation and as the foundation of air.

04:30:01.740 --> 04:30:06.783
If the framework gets adopted, it will bring confusion to the minds, hearts, and souls of our future generations.

04:30:07.163 --> 04:30:08.424
Please reject the framework.

04:30:08.624 --> 04:30:08.944
Thank you.

04:30:15.737 --> 04:30:17.939
Hi, my name is Sarah Stevenson, and I'm a parent.

04:30:19.181 --> 04:30:22.404
I'm going to read an excerpt from one of the books that are recommended for third grade.

04:30:22.865 --> 04:30:25.628
It's called Changing You, a Guide to Body Changes and Sexuality.

04:30:26.168 --> 04:30:32.896
When a man and a woman love each other and decide that they want to have a child, they will do something called sexual intercourse, or having sex.

04:30:33.769 --> 04:30:38.371
This is when a man lies very close to a woman and puts his erect penis inside her vagina.

04:30:38.471 --> 04:30:40.652
It feels good for both of the man and woman.

04:30:40.992 --> 04:30:42.472
They will also hug and kiss and cuddle.

04:30:42.532 --> 04:30:45.333
This is a very special way of expressing how much they love each other.

04:30:46.294 --> 04:30:48.595
This is being taught to our seven, eight, nine-year-olds.

04:30:49.495 --> 04:30:52.317
Why are you teaching about sex in school at that young of an age?

04:30:53.217 --> 04:30:55.379
You do not need to be teaching this in the classroom.

04:30:55.659 --> 04:30:57.180
That is my job as a parent.

04:30:57.660 --> 04:30:59.941
This is pornographic, and it's wrong.

04:31:00.702 --> 04:31:02.303
Please change these books.

04:31:02.503 --> 04:31:03.564
Reject the framework.

04:31:03.924 --> 04:31:14.110
It is not appropriate, and it goes against parental rights of deciding when it is time to teach these things to our precious children that we have known since they've grown in my belly.

04:31:14.210 --> 04:31:17.612
I know them individually, and I know when it's best to teach these things.

04:31:23.427 --> 04:31:25.648
Hello, my name is Heather, and I'm a mother of four.

04:31:26.308 --> 04:31:32.491
On page 59 of the Health Framework for Fifth Graders, it suggests several books to first initiate dialogue for a class group chat.

04:31:32.971 --> 04:31:35.552
One of these books is titled, What's Happening to My Body?

04:31:35.672 --> 04:31:36.253
Book for Girls.

04:31:36.653 --> 04:31:46.117
This book includes male sex organs, orgasms, erections, penis size, ejaculation, homosexual feelings, rape, child abuse, and G spots.

04:31:46.637 --> 04:31:50.679
On page 83 of that book, it reads, men usually ejaculate when they have an orgasm.

04:31:51.019 --> 04:31:52.780
Females don't ejaculate in the sense that men do.

04:31:53.140 --> 04:31:56.202
However, some women report releasing a spurt of fluid at orgasm.

04:31:56.703 --> 04:31:58.564
Experts are not sure where this fluid comes from.

04:31:58.904 --> 04:32:04.008
It may be a small amount of urine or fluid from the slit-like openings of the glands near the urinary opening.

04:32:04.428 --> 04:32:07.510
These topics are not age-appropriate for 10 and 11-year-olds.

04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:13.814
I have a 10-year-old, and she does not need to learn this information right now, especially from somebody other than myself.

04:32:14.255 --> 04:32:16.817
I support the recommendation to remove this book from the framework.

04:32:17.017 --> 04:32:17.317
Thank you.

04:32:22.236 --> 04:32:23.057
I'm Susan Beery.

04:32:23.097 --> 04:32:25.781
I have five kids, TK through 10th grade.

04:32:26.181 --> 04:32:29.366
I support recommendation of removing these recommended books.

04:32:30.307 --> 04:32:36.034
SEX, All You Need to Know, Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Those Teen Years by Heather Carina specifically.

04:32:36.655 --> 04:32:37.176
I have a sense

04:32:37.176 --> 04:32:38.957
I was significantly bullied in kindergarten.

04:32:38.997 --> 04:32:41.078
He had a friend in kindergarten with gender dysphoria.

04:32:41.398 --> 04:32:46.160
He was exposed to teaching about gender in kindergarten by teachers and students without parents' awareness.

04:32:46.240 --> 04:32:55.863
This did not allow my husband and I the opportunity to support our son when he was upset, confused, and as a result, hating kindergarten and school, and to which he still goes to therapy three years later.

04:32:55.883 --> 04:32:58.204
I am an inclusion specialist.

04:32:58.344 --> 04:33:02.766
I also have a daughter with Down syndrome in general education setting, fully included.

04:33:02.906 --> 04:33:04.107
I understand how important

04:33:04.907 --> 04:33:07.950
I understand discrimination, how important inclusion lessons are.

04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:21.422
I do not talk about sexual topics or political when discussing inclusion, such as how 23 chromosomes came from mom and dad and how they and how that happened or how 95% of people with Down syndrome are aborted.

04:33:21.763 --> 04:33:24.205
I protect K through 5 from further contact.

04:33:24.225 --> 04:33:24.445
Time.

04:33:26.467 --> 04:33:26.727
Time.

04:33:33.314 --> 04:33:36.438
Hi, my name is Amanda Salvatier, and I'm a parent, and I'm way out of my element here.

04:33:36.738 --> 04:33:38.019
So give me a second.

04:33:38.580 --> 04:33:47.410
I support and I appreciate the fact that you guys are adopting to not choose this book that you have chosen here for ages eight through nine-year-old.

04:33:48.399 --> 04:33:57.065
For the Changing You, a Guide of Body Changes of Sexuality by Gail Stultz, I'm Not a Stork by Girls and Boys, Babies Come From, and Babies and Families.

04:33:58.526 --> 04:34:01.528
This was my main expert on page 119 of the book.

04:34:01.888 --> 04:34:03.229
It's very confusing for

04:34:04.209 --> 04:34:10.451
the child when it says, the female reproduction organs, but some people who identify as a male have these same organs, confusing the children.

04:34:11.031 --> 04:34:14.631
I think these topics don't need to be discussed at such an age of second grade.

04:34:14.651 --> 04:34:17.492
A man's penis goes inside the woman's vagina.

04:34:17.512 --> 04:34:19.193
This is not appropriate.

04:34:19.213 --> 04:34:22.573
And I think that these subjects don't need to be taught by the teacher.

04:34:22.613 --> 04:34:25.574
We need to be learning about reading and writing in second grade.

04:34:26.115 --> 04:34:29.961
children can learn about all these different topics with their own families.

04:34:30.742 --> 04:34:33.987
Super important that these books are not adopted.

04:34:34.047 --> 04:34:34.308
Thank you.

04:34:41.243 --> 04:34:48.608
Hello, my name is Jennifer Lindsay, and I'd like to read to you chapter 6, page 64, for grades 9 through 12.

04:34:48.648 --> 04:34:58.894
The California Health Framework promotes a school-wide read featuring the book SEX, the All You Need to Know Sexuality Guide, to get you through your teens and 20s.

04:35:00.015 --> 04:35:04.676
In the section of bondage restraint, it says, what is it and how do you do it?

04:35:05.176 --> 04:35:19.658
Bondage or restraint is the practice of having one partner or less often both partners restrained in some way, usually with ropes, cords, other types of fabric or cuffs, and other restraints during sexual activity for the purpose of increased pleasure.

04:35:20.759 --> 04:35:27.060
Bondage can be used to allow a partner to be selfish in terms of being given all the pleasure being unable to reciprocate during

04:35:30.168 --> 04:35:33.851
during a given sexual activity because they can't use their hands or mouths.

04:35:34.471 --> 04:35:40.655
Why does my high schoolers need to know this obscene and graphic material?

04:35:41.376 --> 04:35:42.897
My boys do not need to know this.

04:35:51.209 --> 04:35:52.249
Hello, my name is Jennifer.

04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:54.290
I come from Fontana, San Bernardino County.

04:35:54.890 --> 04:35:57.051
Chapter one talks about exploring gender identity.

04:35:57.291 --> 04:35:59.492
There's only two sex, male and female.

04:35:59.552 --> 04:36:02.993
Gender identity is whether your mind, whatever your mind says.

04:36:03.373 --> 04:36:04.694
Our feelings change every day.

04:36:05.034 --> 04:36:07.735
And we are, what, 20, no more than 30 years old.

04:36:08.615 --> 04:36:11.716
You can imagine a five-year-old, they change their mind every minute.

04:36:11.776 --> 04:36:14.837
Not because it's legal changing your mind or gender means it's moral rights.

04:36:15.217 --> 04:36:19.479
Now my question, is your kids, your grandchildren going through this curriculum?

04:36:20.399 --> 04:36:20.539
No.

04:36:22.054 --> 04:36:27.135
know how because, because you know that this new curriculum will bring chaos to this society.

04:36:27.456 --> 04:36:32.677
Without marriage between men and a woman, God, how God mandate to be, you don't have a family.

04:36:33.017 --> 04:36:38.218
Without marriage, family, and now God, if you take him out from the equation, we'll be puppets in the system.

04:36:38.739 --> 04:36:42.980
We the people of the United States of America ask to reject the education framework.

04:36:43.180 --> 04:36:43.500
Thank you.

04:36:49.150 --> 04:36:49.430
Hello.

04:36:50.390 --> 04:37:00.934
First, I want to acknowledge that some transphobic and homophobic comments were made, and I want to tell, wherever the camera's at, to the little babies outside, if you're queer, you're here, you're not going, and we love you.

04:37:01.254 --> 04:37:01.615
Thank you.

04:37:02.555 --> 04:37:07.917
Hello, my name is Carmen, and I'm from East Los Angeles, and a core leader at GSA Network, SoCal.

04:37:08.897 --> 04:37:12.859
I'm currently a senior, and my junior year, I stumbled across a sexologist YouTuber.

04:37:13.299 --> 04:37:16.060
The next day, I barfed all of the information onto my friends.

04:37:16.980 --> 04:37:18.341
I binge watched all of her videos.

04:37:18.802 --> 04:37:21.824
I basically taught them all about inclusive sex under 40 minutes during lunch.

04:37:22.525 --> 04:37:26.728
Looking back it was the first time my Catholic girlfriends heard it was okay to say no.

04:37:27.509 --> 04:37:30.331
And my gay friends learned that their sexuality was normal.

04:37:30.931 --> 04:37:36.596
The lack of comprehensive sex ed has led to many youth finding other mediums to gain this knowledge sometimes even dangerous.

04:37:37.437 --> 04:37:39.919
The framework can help teachers teach comprehensive sex ed.

04:37:40.379 --> 04:37:43.321
Please prioritize youth and please keep supporting the framework.

04:37:43.422 --> 04:37:43.702
Thank you.

04:37:50.438 --> 04:37:51.919
Hello, my name is Amber.

04:37:52.199 --> 04:37:56.400
I'm an 18-year-old student from Long Beach, California and a youth leader with the GSA Network.

04:37:57.120 --> 04:38:02.042
I'm here to explain why we need to have inclusive LGBT sex education in public schools for LGBT youths.

04:38:02.702 --> 04:38:07.164
Without the passing of this framework, the curriculum will exclude LGBT youths and remain gender biased.

04:38:07.724 --> 04:38:17.668
Thanks to the California Education Code and myself and LGBT allies, we're able to learn about STIs and how they're contracted and how to prevent it using condoms or practicing abstinence.

04:38:18.288 --> 04:38:28.356
It's important for everyone to know about the LGBT community because everyday LGBT youths are taking their lives for not being accepted by their families or simply for being who they are.

04:38:29.137 --> 04:38:36.583
As an LGBT youth, having to have little acceptance from my own family or friends been really hard.

04:38:36.683 --> 04:38:38.725
That's why we need this framework to pass in public schools.

04:38:39.225 --> 04:38:44.870
The lack of inclusive LGBT sex education in our schools throughout California will not allow cisgender people

04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:51.165
or LGBT folks to understand and educate others about practicing safe sex whether you're cis, trans, non-binary, etc.

04:39:01.212 --> 04:39:05.013
My name is Phoenix Alirajah, and I came with the GSA Network from downtown LA.

04:39:05.533 --> 04:39:08.753
My school shows us a musical every year about STIs and how to have safe sex.

04:39:09.254 --> 04:39:13.454
This year, I saw the musical, and leaving the theater, I heard someone say, I'm a lesbian, so none of that was for me.

04:39:14.095 --> 04:39:20.816
We never had any LGBTQ inclusive sex education of any kind at school, so some kids don't think the rules for straight sex apply to them.

04:39:21.116 --> 04:39:26.317
What people need to realize is just because they aren't taught sex, it won't stop your kids from knowing about sex or even having sex.

04:39:26.977 --> 04:39:32.281
All this will do is leave your children in the dark and make them forced to find out that information themselves, which could be inaccurate and even dangerous.

04:39:32.881 --> 04:39:37.184
The lack of LGBTQ plus sex education proved to be an issue for me once I came out as transgender.

04:39:37.624 --> 04:39:41.206
From that moment on, my relationship to sex and romantic relationships was going to be different.

04:39:41.587 --> 04:39:45.249
Not having this kind of information at school made it so I had to come to terms with this fact on my own.

04:39:45.389 --> 04:39:50.212
A lot of trouble, anxiety and hardship could have been saved for me if I knew I had an open, safe space at my school.

04:39:50.712 --> 04:39:54.555
Thank you for your time and please continue to support the LGBT inclusive sex education at our schools.

04:40:00.384 --> 04:40:00.945
Good afternoon.

04:40:01.485 --> 04:40:06.449
I'm Karen Riz Roca, a high school student from South Central LA and a youth leader with GSA Network.

04:40:06.850 --> 04:40:12.834
I'm here to discuss the value of having safe sex education, be fully inclusive and integrated in the health framework.

04:40:12.975 --> 04:40:17.158
As a student myself, I see what needs to be done and the struggles of uninformed youth.

04:40:17.598 --> 04:40:24.344
As a queer Latinx woman, I have felt the discomfort in being in a place where my identity and choices are undermined and disbelieved.

04:40:24.784 --> 04:40:28.505
The school should be a place where I'm comfortable and I'm given the tools to grow and be safe.

04:40:28.945 --> 04:40:36.567
Every student comes from a different path of life and deserves to have their safety and health acknowledged by being inclusive and welcoming.

04:40:37.108 --> 04:40:42.669
The benefits of representation of LGBTQ youth in sexual health education and other subjects is astounding.

04:40:43.169 --> 04:40:48.411
This normalizes these identities, making allies more common and queer folk more accepted and comfortable.

04:40:49.071 --> 04:40:57.716
It's a creation of a more united community where questions can be asked and answered so young people are making informed decisions and are able to act safely.

04:40:57.996 --> 04:41:02.559
I commend you for putting in an effort to improve education in this great state of California.

04:41:04.279 --> 04:41:13.304
We'd like to ask that speakers 61 through 75 please enter the boardroom and we would like speakers 76 to 90 to please line up.

04:41:19.002 --> 04:41:20.303
Hello, my name is Kathy Chu.

04:41:20.623 --> 04:41:24.306
I'm a staff member with the Genders and Sexualities Alliance Network, or GSA Network.

04:41:24.966 --> 04:41:32.191
We are here today with youth leaders, and we thank you for your hard work to prioritize LGBTQ inclusivity in the health education framework.

04:41:33.011 --> 04:41:36.193
In my role, I hear stories from youth throughout the state of California.

04:41:36.874 --> 04:41:41.737
Just last month, I heard a story about a young gay cisgender man who had sex with another young gay man.

04:41:42.538 --> 04:41:45.320
They didn't use a condom because they figured they couldn't get pregnant.

04:41:46.140 --> 04:41:48.342
A month later, he was tested positive for HIV.

04:41:49.302 --> 04:41:50.824
This is not an isolated incident.

04:41:51.384 --> 04:42:02.013
For some of our LGBTQ students throughout California, health education may be the only place in their lives where they're receiving positive messages from educators and crucial sexual health information.

04:42:02.834 --> 04:42:09.219
When I was in the ninth grade, I literally thought it was not possible for a queer person like myself to live happily and have a relationship.

04:42:10.060 --> 04:42:19.324
The sexual health framework and health framework provides guidance for life-affirming education, and I urge you to listen to LGBTQ young people who are directly impacted by this guidance.

04:42:19.844 --> 04:42:22.326
Thank you for your work, and I hope you will continue to work.

04:42:28.581 --> 04:42:30.622
My name is Greg Burt with the California Family Council.

04:42:30.642 --> 04:42:32.282
I handed out a thing I'm going to read.

04:42:32.302 --> 04:42:35.703
It's part of the curriculum.

04:42:36.003 --> 04:42:37.964
It's called Sex, All You Need to Know.

04:42:38.544 --> 04:42:40.605
Sexuality guide to get you through your teens and 20s.

04:42:40.645 --> 04:42:42.125
Recommended for high school.

04:42:44.066 --> 04:42:45.786
Body fluid or blood play.

04:42:45.886 --> 04:42:47.367
What is it and how do you do it?

04:42:48.223 --> 04:42:58.070
Some people enjoy any number of body fluids sexually, ejaculate, vaginal fluids, menace, urine, or blood.

04:42:58.811 --> 04:43:14.922
They may simply enjoy tasting, feeling, or smelling them during sexual activities, or they may engage in activities specific to enjoying these fluids, such as golden showers, being urinated on, or having a partner ejaculate on them.

04:43:15.883 --> 04:43:23.125
Some enjoy this because it feels taboo or naughty to have intimate contact with body fluids.

04:43:23.185 --> 04:43:29.487
For others, fluid play may be enjoyable because a certain intimacy or sacredness is experienced in body fluid.

04:43:29.707 --> 04:43:30.047
Time.

04:43:30.067 --> 04:43:30.307
Time.

04:43:37.873 --> 04:43:39.674
Sylvia Bond, important title, Mom.

04:43:40.215 --> 04:43:44.077
We are being told the purpose of this framework is to ensure the safety of the children.

04:43:44.177 --> 04:43:45.258
Let me give you a scenario.

04:43:45.678 --> 04:43:50.521
When we were youth, peer pressure to have sex meant something like, don't worry, everyone is doing it, and that was hard enough.

04:43:51.041 --> 04:43:53.803
Here's an example of the new pressures our youth will face if this passes.

04:43:54.223 --> 04:43:55.584
Don't worry, everyone is doing it.

04:43:55.804 --> 04:43:57.305
Don't worry, our schools taught us how.

04:43:57.745 --> 04:44:00.067
Don't worry, our schools showed us other ways to be sexual.

04:44:00.587 --> 04:44:01.809
Don't worry if you do get pregnant.

04:44:01.869 --> 04:44:03.491
Our school taught us where to go to abort it.

04:44:04.051 --> 04:44:05.433
Don't worry about telling your parents.

04:44:05.493 --> 04:44:07.195
Our school taught us we don't have to tell them.

04:44:07.896 --> 04:44:08.396
Don't worry.

04:44:08.676 --> 04:44:11.119
Our school also taught us that there are other adults to talk to.

04:44:11.540 --> 04:44:12.441
Please open your eyes.

04:44:12.621 --> 04:44:15.064
This is not going to ensure the safety of our children.

04:44:15.644 --> 04:44:20.946
It will only take away parental rights and ensure future customers for Planned Parenthood and other authors of this framework.

04:44:21.567 --> 04:44:26.829
If you don't think that this is what is going to be taught, you have not reviewed and researched the suggestions of what is to be taught.

04:44:27.369 --> 04:44:30.250
Remove those books and any books that are like it.

04:44:30.930 --> 04:44:34.472
It may not be curriculum, quote unquote, but it does drive curriculum.

04:44:34.492 --> 04:44:36.372
We have already seen it in our local districts.

04:44:36.933 --> 04:44:38.213
The parents are being informed.

04:44:38.293 --> 04:44:39.254
We will not back down.

04:44:45.239 --> 04:44:47.300
My name is Rachel Crutchfield and I'm a parent.

04:44:47.460 --> 04:44:56.363
According to the National Center for Health Statistics in 2015, only 3.1% of California high school students reported being sexually active before the age of 13.

04:44:57.364 --> 04:45:01.885
Yet the health framework suggests comprehensive sexual education in grades K through 6.

04:45:02.626 --> 04:45:10.709
If we expose our children to the explicit sexual content suggested in this framework, there will be many more children experimenting with sex at younger and younger ages.

04:45:11.249 --> 04:45:24.115
In the first grade's suggested supplemental book called It's Not The Stork, describes sex and I quote, when the woman and man get so close to each other that the man's penis goes inside the woman's vagina, this is not appropriate for eight-year-olds.

04:45:24.495 --> 04:45:26.196
Please remove this book from the framework.

04:45:26.676 --> 04:45:29.137
Please remove also the book, What's Happening to My Body.

04:45:29.517 --> 04:45:34.679
In this book, for fifth grade girls, they learn about the G-spot and 20 different slang words for their private parts.

04:45:35.100 --> 04:45:43.243
On page 83, it says, some experts claim there is a specific spot inside the vagina that, like the clitoris, is super sensitive to sexual stimulation.

04:45:43.563 --> 04:45:48.125
They also claim that stimulating the spot, which they call the G-spot, will cause the release of fluid.

04:45:53.166 --> 04:45:54.448
Hi, my name is Heidi Gimness.

04:45:55.089 --> 04:45:58.114
I'm a mother of two, and I'm an ICU nurse of 17 years.

04:45:58.895 --> 04:46:07.288
I address the board and our only elected official here today, which is seat is empty, Tony Thurman, our superintendent of public construction in California.

04:46:08.850 --> 04:46:28.560
I'm here to say that I think there are two separate issues that are being conflated, the LGBTQ inclusivity, which we do want them included, of course, and also when you describe historical figures, perhaps maybe when you describe Thomas Edison, you use a straight white male if you're going to start including everyone in their sexual orientation.

04:46:29.500 --> 04:46:47.170
I do think that the two items being conflated are the inclusivity of the LGBTQ and the debut of the sexual dialogue with our most vulnerable population without boundaries and without regard to the developmental age and the appropriateness to this vulnerable population.

04:46:47.970 --> 04:46:54.874
With this newly mandated framework, one can reasonably forecast a substantial disruption to our elementary schools across America.

04:46:57.191 --> 04:47:00.573
sexual dialogue with developmentally inappropriate populations.

04:47:08.308 --> 04:47:12.370
My name is Erica Knoll, and I am a parent of seven children who are in public education.

04:47:13.290 --> 04:47:17.692
Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God, and family is central to God's plan.

04:47:18.673 --> 04:47:27.037
I warn you that the disintegration of the family will bring upon individuals, communities, and nations the calamities foretold by ancient and modern prophets.

04:47:27.757 --> 04:47:38.343
I call upon each of you as responsible citizens and officers of government to promote those measures designed to maintain and strengthen the family as the fundamental unit of society.

04:47:38.963 --> 04:47:43.506
You will be held responsible before God for the decisions you make regarding this framework.

04:47:44.206 --> 04:47:49.449
Some of the teachings in the framework are in direct opposition to healthy family relationships.

04:47:50.189 --> 04:48:10.967
In the book, Sex, All You Need to Know, Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twenties, that you recommend for a school-wide read in high school, states that love is not always required for enjoyable, healthy sex, and one can have sexual partners outside romantic relationships primarily or purely for sex alone.

04:48:11.387 --> 04:48:12.248
That is unacceptable.

04:48:18.069 --> 04:48:19.330
My name is Jamin Banks.

04:48:19.410 --> 04:48:22.711
I'm a mother of five and a grandmother of three.

04:48:23.232 --> 04:48:26.493
I'm very concerned about this new framework.

04:48:27.194 --> 04:48:36.719
And I've been careful about what I've taught my children and what they've been exposed to, because I know that what you teach a child becomes part of who they are, their identity.

04:48:37.319 --> 04:48:44.302
In the book George, approved for fifth graders, this book promotes pornography and hiding the truth from parents.

04:48:45.303 --> 04:48:56.168
Not only is pornography in this book, but in every other approved book, grooming our children for the pornography industry, which will destroy family relationships.

04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:58.329
Please reject the framework.

04:48:58.729 --> 04:48:59.049
Thank you.

04:49:05.643 --> 04:49:07.204
Hello, my name is Tiffany Coleman.

04:49:07.905 --> 04:49:14.710
I am a parent of five children, two of which have graduated, one graduating this year and two still in our California public schools.

04:49:15.210 --> 04:49:20.694
I share my voice today with you to ask you to delay the adoption of this framework.

04:49:21.215 --> 04:49:26.699
I appreciate the time that has already been given to it, but we still need time to rework this framework.

04:49:27.519 --> 04:49:35.623
Teaching correct biology surrounding reproduction and basic sexuality is very good when taught with medical accuracy and at an appropriate age.

04:49:36.164 --> 04:49:39.145
It is also very good to teach kindness and respect for all.

04:49:39.745 --> 04:49:45.649
However, this framework moves far beyond biology and also far beyond teaching kindness and respect for all.

04:49:46.209 --> 04:49:52.112
This framework aggressively advocates and affirms a social ideology of sexual and gender ambiguity,

04:49:52.652 --> 04:49:55.653
fluidity and exploration at a very young age.

04:49:56.253 --> 04:50:02.696
Just as other ideologies should not be taught as right or affirmed as correct in our public schools neither should this ideology.

04:50:03.316 --> 04:50:07.057
I believe this framework diminishes families abolishes gender and gender roles.

04:50:07.277 --> 04:50:07.517
Time.

04:50:18.749 --> 04:50:19.289
Good afternoon.

04:50:19.309 --> 04:50:20.370
My name is Joe Miranda.

04:50:21.131 --> 04:50:25.333
I grew up in a small town of Brawley, California, and I was a single parent.

04:50:25.594 --> 04:50:27.395
I had single parent growth.

04:50:28.195 --> 04:50:37.842
Graduated from high school, graduated from a junior college, graduated from a university, went on and got a master's degree in counseling, educational counseling.

04:50:37.962 --> 04:50:38.823
Counseled at Whittier.

04:50:39.303 --> 04:50:46.628
Did the rest of my years there at LA Unified, where kids couldn't even tell time, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders, even if I offered them five bucks.

04:50:47.388 --> 04:50:48.609
They still couldn't tell time.

04:50:49.969 --> 04:50:51.690
But long story short, you know what?

04:50:51.890 --> 04:50:52.331
I went on.

04:50:52.491 --> 04:50:53.091
I did well.

04:50:53.531 --> 04:50:55.492
I never had a doubt of my identity.

04:50:55.592 --> 04:50:59.754
If I ever did, I just looked down below, and I knew who I was and what I was.

04:51:00.174 --> 04:51:01.175
Thank you very much.

04:51:01.375 --> 04:51:07.058
And also, one of my highlights of my life is my daughter, America Figueroa, right there.

04:51:08.438 --> 04:51:09.119
Watch out for her.

04:51:09.179 --> 04:51:10.739
She'll be on you all the time.

04:51:11.400 --> 04:51:11.700
Thank you.

04:51:16.767 --> 04:51:16.927
Hello.

04:51:17.427 --> 04:51:21.729
I'd like to start by thanking those of you guys who are actually making eye contact and paying attention to us.

04:51:21.749 --> 04:51:22.869
It makes us feel heard.

04:51:23.609 --> 04:51:24.870
This is a book you recommended.

04:51:25.130 --> 04:51:26.470
I'm just going to read a few lines from it.

04:51:27.311 --> 04:51:30.972
You can give yourself an erection and make yourself come by touching and rubbing your penis.

04:51:31.092 --> 04:51:32.432
This is known as masturbation.

04:51:32.852 --> 04:51:35.633
Masturbation makes your body feel very hot and tingly and excited.

04:51:36.134 --> 04:51:39.575
These feelings get stronger and stronger until you ejaculate, and then they fade away.

04:51:39.795 --> 04:51:43.836
Sometimes the feelings are so powerful, a huge wave of pleasure crashes over you.

04:51:44.536 --> 04:51:45.897
This is called having an orgasm.

04:51:47.679 --> 04:51:51.423
Foreplay includes mutual masturbation, rubbing and stroking each other's penis and clitoris.

04:51:51.663 --> 04:51:57.569
It also includes oral sex when one or both partners use their mouth and tongue to kiss and lick the partner's penis or clitoris.

04:51:57.930 --> 04:51:58.810
And I'm not going to go on.

04:51:59.711 --> 04:52:00.532
This goes on and on.

04:52:00.592 --> 04:52:02.094
This is recommended for fifth grade.

04:52:02.694 --> 04:52:09.021
The fact that someone thought it was good judgment to put this book in your framework makes us question the whole framework.

04:52:10.370 --> 04:52:13.111
There's got to be something wrong if someone thought this was OK.

04:52:13.151 --> 04:52:14.231
Who was overseeing this?

04:52:14.271 --> 04:52:15.392
Who was supervising this?

04:52:15.932 --> 04:52:19.093
We've had our eyes closed for a very long time thinking we can trust California.

04:52:20.753 --> 04:52:21.013
Time.

04:52:22.634 --> 04:52:29.616
We'd like to ask speakers 76 to 90 to please enter the boardroom and speakers 91 to 105 to line up.

04:52:34.855 --> 04:52:36.236
Good afternoon state board members.

04:52:36.296 --> 04:52:36.976
My name is Amy.

04:52:37.036 --> 04:52:38.757
I'm a supporter of comprehensive sex ed.

04:52:38.777 --> 04:52:41.679
I'm also a parent of two young daughters who attend public schools.

04:52:42.199 --> 04:52:51.825
I'm here today to thank you for supporting this health framework that will serve as a support tool for teachers so they can use that they can use to accurately and effectively convey CHIA compliant information to their students.

04:52:52.266 --> 04:52:53.426
The resources are robust.

04:52:53.466 --> 04:52:59.230
The activities carefully created so that we can trust our teachers to use and adapt the content to match the comprehension level of their students.

04:52:59.790 --> 04:53:08.812
A strong health framework will provide educators with guidance on how to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment in which students of all abilities and gender identities are included and welcomed.

04:53:09.192 --> 04:53:15.693
Sometimes opinions get in the way of facts, but studies show that science-based comprehensive sex ed helps students become healthier and more successful adults.

04:53:16.213 --> 04:53:28.776
Studies like the 2015 National School Climate Survey found that students whose curricula included positive representations of LGBTQ issues had higher GPAs, higher educational aspirations, and were more likely to have classmates who were accepting of LGBT folks.

04:53:29.336 --> 04:53:33.857
Thank you for your time and attention you have given to this health framework and for all your efforts in making our schools more inclusive.

04:53:39.138 --> 04:53:39.779
Good afternoon.

04:53:39.819 --> 04:53:40.519
My name is Brooke.

04:53:40.719 --> 04:53:43.640
I'm a teacher and I have four school-aged kids.

04:53:44.120 --> 04:53:53.042
I would like to speak on the purpose and outcome of this framework as well as a teacher's civil disobedience in regards to not promoting the values of this ill-fated social experiment.

04:53:53.562 --> 04:53:57.823
It appears the purpose is to subvert religious beliefs by indoctrinating our children

04:53:58.283 --> 04:54:09.876
Without the knowledge or interference of the values of the parents, it appears that the desired outcome is to confuse our children and encourage early sexual experimentation to discover the obvious, their gender.

04:54:10.097 --> 04:54:12.760
It appears that the state is rising above the will of the people.

04:54:13.340 --> 04:54:16.462
What do you hope our children will become, and who do you think you are?

04:54:17.082 --> 04:54:20.284
Last week, the gender-bred person was taught in my son's health class.

04:54:20.744 --> 04:54:23.625
I spoke with the health teacher, the principal, and the counselor that night.

04:54:24.046 --> 04:54:25.606
They told me they have to teach it.

04:54:26.047 --> 04:54:33.330
When I hear we have to teach it, I'm inspired by Schindler and his list, and how teachers are free to stand up for morality.

04:54:33.551 --> 04:54:36.972
Our children's rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are at stake.

04:54:37.533 --> 04:54:38.773
I protest these teachings.

04:54:38.813 --> 04:54:40.674
They are subversive of my constitution.

04:54:40.694 --> 04:54:40.854
Time.

04:54:41.855 --> 04:54:42.095
Time.

04:54:49.049 --> 04:54:49.389
Hello.

04:54:50.370 --> 04:54:51.211
My name is Selena.

04:54:51.371 --> 04:54:55.255
I am mother of three and CSUS student in child development major.

04:54:55.355 --> 04:55:00.401
I strongly oppose health education framework for California public schools starting from K to 12.

04:55:02.162 --> 04:55:04.805
I have book with me that's already in school library.

04:55:05.085 --> 04:55:07.608
It's not appropriate for the age provided for an app.

04:55:10.486 --> 04:55:10.686
here.

04:55:11.226 --> 04:55:17.568
Only parents know child, their individual characteristic for this kind of topic readiness.

04:55:18.049 --> 04:55:22.070
I talk with professor at CSUS, many of them say the same.

04:55:22.710 --> 04:55:27.032
That health education framework that's adopted now, not age appropriate.

04:55:28.092 --> 04:55:30.793
When children will learn this kind of things as

04:55:32.034 --> 04:55:35.997
Early in kindergarten, they will start sexual activity more early.

04:55:36.378 --> 04:55:41.102
In this case, their intellectual development goes down.

04:55:41.402 --> 04:55:44.225
Please don't put our kids in this dangerous situation.

04:55:44.665 --> 04:55:47.869
As a future teacher, I should be between parents and students.

04:55:48.069 --> 04:55:49.590
And I'm already teaching for eight years.

04:55:49.610 --> 04:55:49.690
Time.

04:55:55.950 --> 04:56:01.372
Hello, my name is Daviki, and I'm a student and also an early childhood educator.

04:56:02.192 --> 04:56:04.794
And I didn't want to say these things today, but I will.

04:56:05.614 --> 04:56:10.476
I'm a member of the LGBT community, and I'm also a survivor of sex abuse.

04:56:11.136 --> 04:56:15.518
And I want to say that healthy sex education is not abuse.

04:56:16.238 --> 04:56:28.245
what is abuse is not like not knowing what consent is and then being forced to be in these sexual situations and not know anything about consent and not be taught otherwise.

04:56:28.625 --> 04:56:38.430
And I think that and that's why I support that healthy education framework because if I had known these things about consent earlier it would have helped me at those times.

04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:45.394
And I also support the fact that this curriculum is LGBT inclusive because it would have meant the world to me at that age.

04:56:52.062 --> 04:56:55.804
Hello, my name is Taras Sisko, parent of four healthy, beautiful children.

04:56:56.525 --> 04:56:59.206
I quote from the framework, page 66.

04:56:59.986 --> 04:57:06.610
Fifth grade students will have an opportunity to learn that gender is not strictly defined by physical anatomy or sex assigned at birth.

04:57:06.950 --> 04:57:16.936
Rather, students understand that gender refers to attitudes, feelings, characteristics, and behaviors that a given culture associates with being male or female, sometimes labeled as masculine or feminine.

04:57:17.756 --> 04:57:27.338
Moreover, a person's gender identity refers to their sense of self, while gender expression refers to their outward gender representation, including physical appearance and behavior."

04:57:28.298 --> 04:57:31.879
This opinion, its opinion about gender is not scientifically backed.

04:57:32.499 --> 04:57:36.280
You should not be teaching young impressionable children about theories of gender.

04:57:36.640 --> 04:57:41.221
This goes against my religious belief that there's only two genders, male and female.

04:57:41.661 --> 04:57:42.461
Remove this framework.

04:57:43.121 --> 04:57:45.467
We as parents know best what's right for kids.

04:57:45.728 --> 04:57:46.510
Reject the framework.

04:57:46.991 --> 04:57:47.232
Thank you.

04:57:56.479 --> 04:57:57.900
Hello, my name is Marina De Soto.

04:57:57.960 --> 04:58:02.163
I work with GSA Network in the Central Valley, and I'm here to ask for your support in this framework.

04:58:02.863 --> 04:58:09.508
As a queer mother to a four-year-old son and also working firsthand with trans and queer youth throughout the Central Valley, I see the need for this framework.

04:58:09.808 --> 04:58:15.872
Many trans and queer youth do not know that they can contract an STD because in school, it's just taught like male and female sex.

04:58:16.172 --> 04:58:21.175
This is very important because many students can live with STDs without knowing because they never go get tested.

04:58:21.436 --> 04:58:26.099
It could cause long-term effects for their mental and emotional well-being, also their health.

04:58:26.860 --> 04:58:27.400
Putting them out.

04:58:27.601 --> 04:58:29.243
I'm sorry teaching all our students.

04:58:29.283 --> 04:58:38.517
I'm how to engage in healthy relationships It's important and yes I just started kindergarten teaching them what consent is because they do have control over their body if somebody's doing something to them That's inappropriate.

04:58:38.557 --> 04:58:42.022
They should be able to speak up and you teach them at a young age to do that and

04:58:44.142 --> 04:58:47.364
also teaching them inclusion and removing gender stereotypes and norms.

04:58:47.484 --> 04:58:54.569
And I thank you so much for supporting this framework, and I urge you to please continue this and move it forward so our teachers can have structure and know how to teach our students.

04:58:54.909 --> 04:58:59.792
And if you don't like this framework, just opt your child out, but don't take it away from other students who would really, thank you.

04:59:03.652 --> 04:59:08.533
Hello, my name is Dominic Samaniego, and I am a student and youth leader with GSA Network from Fresno, California.

04:59:08.953 --> 04:59:10.233
I ask you to pass this framework.

04:59:10.353 --> 04:59:16.174
If not passed, the sex education curriculum will remain gender biased, providing unfair opportunities for LGBTQ youth.

04:59:16.714 --> 04:59:20.915
As a gay youth, I had to educate myself how sex with all genders and sexualities worked.

04:59:21.155 --> 04:59:27.336
I learned that I could not only contract an STD through sex with the opposite gender, but sex with the same gender as well.

04:59:27.736 --> 04:59:32.857
I ask myself every day, what if I had never been able to educate myself and proceeded to have same sex intercourse?

04:59:33.317 --> 04:59:35.419
Could I, too, be standing here right now with an STD?

04:59:35.779 --> 04:59:38.301
The sex ed curriculum was biased when it was first taught to me.

04:59:39.002 --> 04:59:43.926
Fortunately enough, I was able to educate myself, but that does not mean that other youth are able to educate themselves as well.

04:59:44.366 --> 04:59:46.848
LGBTQ youth and students should not have to teach themselves.

04:59:46.988 --> 04:59:51.672
They should be taught like every other heterosexual cis male and heterosexual cis female are taught in school.

04:59:52.032 --> 04:59:56.976
It is only right to give students relevant, accurate, and non-gender biased information about the changes their bodies go through.

04:59:57.276 --> 05:00:00.619
Please continue to give your attention to these topics and issues throughout your final revisions.

05:00:00.979 --> 05:00:01.680
Thank you for your time.

05:00:06.311 --> 05:00:06.831
Good afternoon.

05:00:06.931 --> 05:00:11.953
My name is Kylie Engelman and I am a senior in high school as well as a GSA Youth Council member from Fresno, California.

05:00:12.553 --> 05:00:18.435
I would first like to thank you for allowing this framework into your consideration to benefit as many students in the state of California as possible.

05:00:18.975 --> 05:00:23.576
I would also like to thank you for taking a huge step towards ending bullying, harassment, and negative gender stereotypes.

05:00:24.156 --> 05:00:28.298
I'm standing here today to show you that today's generation has a voice and a plan for the one that follows us.

05:00:28.798 --> 05:00:32.519
We want future generations to be free of gender stereotypes and homophobic tendencies.

05:00:32.979 --> 05:00:38.462
but full of acceptance and understanding for people who are exactly like them but are discriminated against for who they are or who they love.

05:00:39.062 --> 05:00:49.428
I stand here today as an ally alongside my friends and family who have not been properly represented within the educational system and aim to make that change so that soon everyone can be educated about their right to safe sex and relationships.

05:00:49.688 --> 05:00:50.909
Thank you for your time and consideration.

05:00:55.009 --> 05:01:02.837
Hello my name is Bailey Berrieza and I'm a sophomore in high school from Fresno and I'm a youth leader in GSA.

05:01:03.257 --> 05:01:11.666
I'd like to thank you for your hard work in prioritizing well prioritize LGBT plus inclusion in the health education framework.

05:01:12.527 --> 05:01:18.813
In school for sex ed the teachers should have more knowledge when it comes to LGBT to help youth stay safe and healthy.

05:01:20.543 --> 05:01:23.327
If you don't want your child to learn about this, you can up your own child.

05:01:23.568 --> 05:01:25.010
But don't take this away from other children.

05:01:25.371 --> 05:01:25.591
Thank you.

05:01:29.824 --> 05:01:30.504
Good afternoon.

05:01:31.185 --> 05:01:32.045
My name is Nico.

05:01:32.245 --> 05:01:33.546
My pronouns are he, him, his.

05:01:33.986 --> 05:01:36.868
I'm a health educator in Fresno, California.

05:01:38.348 --> 05:01:50.595
I ask that you adopt this framework because it is very crucial to our LGBTQIA plus youth that they feel inclusive and that their voices are heard and that they are not silenced.

05:01:51.515 --> 05:01:58.259
When youth are judged and shamed for their gender or sexuality by non-accepting parents and peers,

05:01:58.999 --> 05:02:03.941
They are put in situations where they do not feel safe in their environments or in schools.

05:02:04.782 --> 05:02:11.785
And me as an instructor, I have occasionally come across slurs against my sexuality.

05:02:12.345 --> 05:02:18.909
And if I'm coming across this, imagine what our LGBTQ plus youth are going through day to day at school.

05:02:19.389 --> 05:02:22.510
So I ask that you do consider adopting this framework.

05:02:23.011 --> 05:02:23.631
Thank you very much.

05:02:30.642 --> 05:02:32.023
Hello, my name is Daisy Cruz.

05:02:32.143 --> 05:02:34.283
I am a health educator from Fresno, California.

05:02:34.323 --> 05:02:35.804
My pronouns are she, her, hers.

05:02:36.364 --> 05:02:42.306
And I thank you guys for taking an initiative in prioritizing our LGBTQ plus inclusivity in the health framework.

05:02:42.866 --> 05:02:46.387
As an educator, it is enlightening to see the action taking place for our students.

05:02:46.847 --> 05:02:53.529
All California students deserve the right to medically accurate information, but most importantly, the right to feel safe and be treated equally.

05:02:54.370 --> 05:02:58.251
Many neglect the high rates of bullying and harassment within the LGBTQ community.

05:02:59.151 --> 05:03:02.232
No youth deserves to be excluded or ridiculed for who they are.

05:03:02.252 --> 05:03:07.874
And I speak on behalf of my students who come to me to express their fears, worries, and tears.

05:03:08.514 --> 05:03:11.575
And I ask that you guys consider all of our youth when making the decision.

05:03:12.075 --> 05:03:16.817
And thank you for your efforts in creating a more inclusive and safe environment for our students.

05:03:17.157 --> 05:03:17.457
Thank you.

05:03:23.595 --> 05:03:24.796
Good afternoon, esteemed board members.

05:03:25.056 --> 05:03:26.077
My name is Michael Dominguez.

05:03:26.277 --> 05:03:28.119
I'm a health educator with Fresno Bodies Unidos.

05:03:28.559 --> 05:03:29.480
Pronouns are he, him, his.

05:03:29.740 --> 05:03:33.943
We provide comprehensive sex ed for high schools and middle schools in Fresno.

05:03:34.784 --> 05:03:39.648
In every class that I visited, the underlying theme from many of the questions dealt with relationships.

05:03:40.128 --> 05:03:43.651
What do I do if my family is not supportive of LGBTQ?

05:03:44.852 --> 05:03:47.494
Is it abuse if my boyfriend or girlfriend always makes me feel bad?

05:03:48.215 --> 05:03:49.656
Where can I get protection if I need it?

05:03:50.336 --> 05:03:51.898
Am I a bad person if I masturbate?

05:03:52.618 --> 05:03:58.663
Some questions more innocent and some so terrifyingly raw, but all of them begging for the honesty of someone who cares and knows.

05:03:59.344 --> 05:04:04.808
Unfortunately, some of these youth with the questions like these are youth who feel like they have no support wherever they turn.

05:04:04.828 --> 05:04:12.014
And for them, this framework provides a space for this kind of relational learning, reproductive health learning, and answers the questions they've been holding onto and have nowhere to put.

05:04:12.554 --> 05:04:16.237
So it's for these reasons and so much more that I support the framework and thank you for your support.

05:04:20.899 --> 05:04:21.900
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:04:21.940 --> 05:04:27.362
My name is Jennifer, and my gender pronouns are she, her, hers, and I am a health educator with Fresno Barrios O'Neill's.

05:04:27.903 --> 05:04:30.084
How can I get out of an abusive relationship?

05:04:30.344 --> 05:04:33.546
Is there a chance an abusive relationship can get better?

05:04:34.066 --> 05:04:35.887
What if things never get better in abuse?

05:04:36.187 --> 05:04:37.889
My partner hit me recently.

05:04:38.089 --> 05:04:40.012
It's the first time he has ever done this.

05:04:40.332 --> 05:04:41.454
I have no clue what to do.

05:04:42.014 --> 05:04:51.546
Those were the questions of 14 and 15-year-old students of Fresno Unified School District and what my fellow health educators and I deal on a regular basis.

05:04:51.966 --> 05:04:55.148
Intimate partner violence affects everyone regardless of sex and gender.

05:04:55.308 --> 05:05:05.095
According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, one in five women and one in seven men who experience IPV in their adult life first experience it between the ages of 11 and 17.

05:05:06.056 --> 05:05:15.903
CHIA has allowed middle school and high school students to recognize the signs of abuse and has given students community resources to create steps towards healthy relationships of all genders.

05:05:15.983 --> 05:05:18.925
That's why I wholeheartedly support this and I hope you do too.

05:05:19.025 --> 05:05:19.325
Thank you.

05:05:26.148 --> 05:05:27.488
Hello, my name is Ashley Rojas.

05:05:28.749 --> 05:05:35.351
I support the Health Ed Framework because for 10 years I have seen it save young people's lives time and time again.

05:05:36.331 --> 05:05:39.332
All people deserve safety, love, and inclusion.

05:05:39.752 --> 05:05:51.595
And as a victim and survivor of childhood sexual abuse, this information would have saved me from years of self-harm and thinking that it was my fault.

05:05:54.066 --> 05:06:03.549
James Baldwin said, we can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist.

05:06:04.049 --> 05:06:12.772
And so I urge our young people to be vigilant and cautious when any adult attempts to lead you by inciting fear, shame, stigma, or hate.

05:06:13.592 --> 05:06:13.932
Thank you.

05:06:20.612 --> 05:06:25.975
Good afternoon, my name is Marisa Corpes, pronouns she and hers, health educator with Fresno Barrios Unidos.

05:06:26.755 --> 05:06:33.939
For the past two years, I've been able to hold individual appointments at Fresno State to have students get education on birth control and STIs.

05:06:34.079 --> 05:06:40.302
And these appointments call students share their worries and concerns about contracting STIs and or having an unintended pregnancy.

05:06:40.882 --> 05:06:58.639
Many students come in not knowing anything about protecting their health or that being a sexual human being can be a part of life, sharing how their school did not have sex ed, the sex ed did not cover these topics, and or their families share negative shame and stigma and or false facts about sex or never have these conversations at all.

05:06:59.880 --> 05:07:03.783
Many people believe sex ed is common knowledge and college students should already know this.

05:07:04.344 --> 05:07:09.688
But from what we see is we have middle school and high school students still not receiving this information.

05:07:09.708 --> 05:07:19.255
So it's important young people receive information at the right time before college so they are prepared to engage in healthy relationships and practice safer sex when they are ready.

05:07:19.475 --> 05:07:19.815
Thank you.

05:07:22.217 --> 05:07:27.181
We would like to ask speakers 91 through 105 to please enter the boardroom.

05:07:27.941 --> 05:07:30.332
and speakers 106 to 120 to please line up now.

05:07:34.383 --> 05:07:34.763
Hello.

05:07:35.084 --> 05:07:35.664
Good afternoon.

05:07:35.704 --> 05:07:40.568
My name is Stephanie, and I'm a student from the Central Valley, and I strongly support this framework.

05:07:41.168 --> 05:07:54.599
And there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said, but I would like to mention that regardless of whether we support this or we don't support this, our children and anybody will continue to be curious and continue to be sexually active.

05:07:54.899 --> 05:07:56.381
So it's better safe than sorry.

05:07:56.421 --> 05:07:57.782
Thank you so much for supporting this.

05:08:07.113 --> 05:08:07.733
Good afternoon.

05:08:07.773 --> 05:08:08.914
My name is Jennifer Chow.

05:08:09.074 --> 05:08:14.137
I am an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, one of the sponsors of the California Healthy Youth Act.

05:08:15.198 --> 05:08:21.061
We support the health framework and thank you for your commitment to health education that is inclusive of all California students.

05:08:21.382 --> 05:08:32.849
Our state has strong protections against bias and discrimination and laws that affirmatively require schools to ensure that LGBTQ students feel safe in their classrooms and are reflected in the education they receive.

05:08:33.729 --> 05:08:38.651
These are longstanding laws and the California Healthy Youth Act has been in effect for over three years.

05:08:39.311 --> 05:08:45.173
Even so, we still receive questions from schools about how they can make the promise of these laws a reality for their students.

05:08:45.713 --> 05:08:58.237
The framework would provide much needed guidance about how to deliver this critical education in a developmentally appropriate way and in an environment that is safe and welcoming for all students of all genders and sexual orientations.

05:08:58.917 --> 05:09:04.796
We commend you for your work on behalf of California students to ensure they get the health education they need and deserve.

05:09:05.177 --> 05:09:05.538
Thank you.

05:09:10.950 --> 05:09:12.212
Good afternoon, I appreciate the time.

05:09:12.913 --> 05:09:16.578
I implore you to continue to be the light of knowledge and enlightenment of California's children.

05:09:17.098 --> 05:09:28.033
I also commend you for taking the steps to prevent bullying, discrimination, harassment in our schools by ensuring that students learn about sexual orientation, gender identity, and harms of negative gender stereotypes.

05:09:28.974 --> 05:09:34.017
Our schools are diverse and every student deserves to feel safe, welcome, and acknowledged at school.

05:09:34.698 --> 05:09:42.543
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students thrive when they see themselves reflected in the content that they receive in school like most people do.

05:09:43.664 --> 05:09:52.129
I hope that your choice to maintain the important guidance for teachers on how to incorporate LGBT exclusive material in the curriculum so that all children can benefit.

05:09:52.709 --> 05:09:53.830
I implore you to choose love.

05:09:54.811 --> 05:09:55.031
Thank you.

05:10:00.080 --> 05:10:00.920
Thank you, board members.

05:10:01.721 --> 05:10:02.781
My name is David Budivong.

05:10:02.861 --> 05:10:04.142
I'm from Fresno, California.

05:10:04.242 --> 05:10:05.543
My pronouns are he and his.

05:10:06.223 --> 05:10:08.484
I'm a part of the LGBTQ community.

05:10:08.604 --> 05:10:09.225
I'm a Buddhist.

05:10:09.945 --> 05:10:11.106
I am Lao.

05:10:12.146 --> 05:10:20.531
I also work at Fresno Bar and Shoes, where I am the health education program manager, and we provide comprehensive sex ed for the entire district in Fresno.

05:10:22.052 --> 05:10:28.980
It's, you know, much more about than just preventing pregnancies and STIs and birth control.

05:10:29.060 --> 05:10:30.722
It's the bigger picture of things.

05:10:31.282 --> 05:10:32.043
There's consent.

05:10:32.664 --> 05:10:35.867
We talk about boundaries, the power dynamics between people.

05:10:36.748 --> 05:10:45.091
healthy relationships, mental, social, emotional issues, and also body autonomy, so they can make the healthy decisions for themselves.

05:10:45.551 --> 05:10:51.154
I want to leave you with one thing that a student from Sunnyside High School wrote to me in a comment.

05:10:51.294 --> 05:11:01.257
And it says, this is verbatim, if an LGBTQ teen is discouraged by their family and friends, then persuade it into a heterosexual relationship.

05:11:01.357 --> 05:11:01.637
Time.

05:11:02.098 --> 05:11:02.958
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:11:03.398 --> 05:11:03.958
Thank you, though.

05:11:10.319 --> 05:11:17.846
Hello my name is Sarah Summers and I am from DeVisadero Middle School in Varsalla California.

05:11:18.586 --> 05:11:35.202
I would like to thank you for providing guidance to administrators to support programs and instructions that provide the medically accurate age-appropriate inclusive sex education students want and need at my school.

05:11:35.862 --> 05:11:41.363
but I found that not all schools or classes are receiving all the information that I did.

05:11:42.144 --> 05:11:56.087
Young people need to receive the right information so they aren't caught off guard by their changing bodies and minds and are prepared for healthy relationships and safe sex when and if they're ready for those steps.

05:11:56.427 --> 05:12:03.949
I thank you for your work and trust this is only the beginning of your efforts to improve health education for all California students.

05:12:04.469 --> 05:12:04.789
Thank you.

05:12:09.980 --> 05:12:11.140
Hello, my name is Claire.

05:12:11.221 --> 05:12:13.261
I'm a health educator at Fresno Barrios Unidos.

05:12:13.301 --> 05:12:14.642
My pronouns are she, her, and hers.

05:12:15.142 --> 05:12:18.724
We teach comprehensive reproductive health in all Fresno Unified's middle and high schools.

05:12:19.504 --> 05:12:22.345
I support this framework because it is valuable to California's youth.

05:12:22.865 --> 05:12:34.330
It can be a stepping stone to actually create conversations at home to get parents included in their child's and students' physical and mental and sexual well-being so they can actually be a part of that process and that journey.

05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:40.255
It can also be so incredibly valuable to people who do not have a home environment that is conducive to their education.

05:12:41.036 --> 05:12:49.043
It's also something that not only empowers young people to know how their bodies function and how they can protect them, but also how they can be more inclusive and understanding of their peers.

05:12:50.224 --> 05:12:54.926
In all the schools we visit, we ask for student feedback, and overwhelmingly that student feedback has been positive.

05:12:55.366 --> 05:13:03.288
They typically thank us for providing information in ways that they can understand, and also for giving them the tools to help protect their bodies and their futures.

05:13:03.308 --> 05:13:12.091
I want to thank you all for the hard work that you do, and I hope to see many more steps in our futures to help make sure that this inclusive, empowering, and comprehensive education... Time.

05:13:15.933 --> 05:13:16.833
Hello board members.

05:13:16.953 --> 05:13:23.375
My name is Jessica Geyer and I am a resident of Orange County with two middle schoolers in the Capistrano Unified School District.

05:13:23.775 --> 05:13:33.577
I am here today to show my support for the health framework, especially the aspects of the framework that are inclusive of our LGBT plus students and the California Healthy Youth Act.

05:13:33.897 --> 05:13:38.978
Comprehensive sexual health education is essential for the health and well-being of all of our young people.

05:13:39.618 --> 05:13:51.967
Our young people deserve factual information on anatomy, STIs, pregnancy prevention, and the use of contraception and condoms before they become sexually active, and also focusing on healthy and unhealthy relationships and consent.

05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:55.590
Break free of shame and stigma, empower through education.

05:13:55.610 --> 05:14:07.418
I commend you for your work and hope you continue taking steps to promote and ensure inclusive sexual health education in schools.

05:14:07.658 --> 05:14:08.299
Thank you very much.

05:14:13.880 --> 05:14:14.541
Good afternoon.

05:14:14.761 --> 05:14:15.983
My name is Lita Esposito.

05:14:16.003 --> 05:14:19.768
I'm a 7th grade science teacher at King Middle School in the Oceanside Unified School District.

05:14:20.389 --> 05:14:28.039
I'm excited to share with you all the good work we have done in our district in regards to our sex ed health and human development curriculum rights respect and responsibility.

05:14:28.940 --> 05:14:39.891
After highly publicized opposition, we were able to create a committee of stakeholders representing diverse opinions, peel through the lessons, and move forward with our secondary level with implementation due this month.

05:14:40.491 --> 05:14:43.534
Later this month, we'll begin similar work with our elementary school curriculum.

05:14:44.295 --> 05:14:50.060
Our leaders were committed to CHIA, the FAIR Act, the health framework, and careful not to fall down the rabbit hole of junk science.

05:14:50.701 --> 05:15:08.236
This progress would not be possible without the professionalism, support, and commitment of our District Superintendent, Dr. Julie Vitale, Associate Superintendent, Dr. Mercedes Lovey, and Curriculum Director, Vicky Gravelin, and are grateful for the tireless, quality work, and forethought of the IQC and the CFCC.

05:15:08.756 --> 05:15:09.757
Thank you so very much.

05:15:16.462 --> 05:15:17.102
Good afternoon.

05:15:17.263 --> 05:15:18.484
My name is Michelle McNutt.

05:15:18.664 --> 05:15:22.847
I'm a parent from Orange County and currently have two children in Capistrano Unified.

05:15:22.867 --> 05:15:33.375
I'm here today to express my gratitude for all of your hard work and to thank you for integrating LGBTQ inclusivity throughout the health framework and through comprehensive sex ed.

05:15:34.075 --> 05:15:43.803
This will be a valuable guidance for teachers and administrators who are striving to create safe school climates so that all students can feel included, accepted and valued.

05:15:44.904 --> 05:15:57.156
As a member of my district's sex education task force, I feel fully invested in ensuring students receive medically accurate, age-appropriate sexual health information that they want and need.

05:15:58.036 --> 05:15:58.777
When kids are given

05:15:59.898 --> 05:16:07.666
unbiased factual health instruction, they are better able to make informed decisions about their own health, their bodies, and their safety.

05:16:08.567 --> 05:16:17.276
My hope is that you maintain the LGBTQ inclusive language in the framework, which will help to make schools a welcoming environment for where all students can thrive.

05:16:17.496 --> 05:16:18.037
Thank you so much.

05:16:23.134 --> 05:16:23.474
Hello.

05:16:23.635 --> 05:16:24.576
My name is Michelle Rivera.

05:16:24.676 --> 05:16:27.459
I'm a health educator from Dineba and Sierra Palo Verde County.

05:16:28.360 --> 05:16:33.105
I would like to thank you for prioritizing LGBTQ inclusivity in the health education framework.

05:16:33.585 --> 05:16:39.872
As a health educator, I have witnessed firsthand the benefits of LGBTQ inclusive curricula.

05:16:40.553 --> 05:16:44.837
It is known that LGBTQ youth are at high risk of suicide, homelessness, violence, and so forth.

05:16:46.243 --> 05:16:51.727
Providing education on gender and sexuality not only breaks the stigma but also creates a safe environment for these students.

05:16:52.208 --> 05:17:01.636
They deserve comprehensive education that reflects their identities and experiences for these factors these factors on their well-being and life expectancy.

05:17:01.836 --> 05:17:09.522
Also topics on consent boundaries values pregnancy options and reproductive health access are inclusive to all genders which everyone benefits from.

05:17:09.942 --> 05:17:11.383
Comprehensive sex ed saves lives.

05:17:11.564 --> 05:17:13.185
Again thank you for your time.

05:17:18.001 --> 05:17:18.862
Hello, everyone.

05:17:18.902 --> 05:17:23.366
My name is Samantha Castillo, and I'm a part of Visalia California's Act for Organization Women and Girls.

05:17:23.886 --> 05:17:26.688
I am here because I believe in the value of education and knowledge.

05:17:27.069 --> 05:17:35.496
I believe that everyone should be afforded this value by being taught adequate and accurate comprehensive sex education, no matter their sexual orientation and or gender identity or expression.

05:17:36.016 --> 05:17:53.829
The teachings of sexual education go beyond more than just sex, but STI prevention and awareness, current up-to-date contraceptives and its access, destigmatizing sexual behaviors, promoting sexual health and responsibility, how to foster and communicate the intimate relationships we have with others, and other tools that we need to be implemented in the standards of our sexual education.

05:17:54.309 --> 05:18:00.274
There should be no place for ignorance, exclusion, and indifference in our classrooms, let alone the curriculum we teach our young adults.

05:18:00.675 --> 05:18:08.982
Our young adults look to teachers, instructors, and families to be able to normalize and provide these conversations that we do not stop needing and learning about, even in our adulthood.

05:18:09.402 --> 05:18:15.288
I support the health framework vote, and I thank you in your efforts to make sexual education inclusive, accessible, and accepting of everyone.

05:18:15.388 --> 05:18:15.688
Thank you.

05:18:22.742 --> 05:18:23.382
Good afternoon.

05:18:23.422 --> 05:18:24.343
Thank you for your time.

05:18:24.383 --> 05:18:25.243
My name is Julie.

05:18:25.343 --> 05:18:26.004
I'm a parent.

05:18:26.884 --> 05:18:35.549
Just a week ago, I saw some samples of the curriculum that is supposed to be included in this framework, and I want to speak out against that just very simply.

05:18:36.450 --> 05:18:41.713
When I look at sexuality and morality, the two topics are inextricably linked, and it needs to be that way.

05:18:42.393 --> 05:18:52.836
And if you take the morality out of the topic of sexuality, which I think a lot of this curriculum does, then we're reduced to the status of just barnyard rutting, which is not really what we want sex to become.

05:18:53.316 --> 05:18:56.497
So I just ask, please give us a chance to review all curriculum.

05:18:56.957 --> 05:18:58.557
I reject the framework, and I'm sorry.

05:18:58.577 --> 05:19:00.058
I know you've worked very hard on that.

05:19:01.138 --> 05:19:03.299
And just listen to the parents as we say this.

05:19:03.339 --> 05:19:07.060
This is our responsibility to raise our children, and many of us take it very seriously.

05:19:07.600 --> 05:19:08.620
Thank you very much for your time.

05:19:18.479 --> 05:19:21.660
Hello, my name is Natalia Bullerbrook and I have three beautiful children.

05:19:21.900 --> 05:19:24.220
I want to talk about the new kindergarten framework.

05:19:24.760 --> 05:19:26.781
It has a book that's called My Princess Boy.

05:19:27.881 --> 05:19:31.882
This book is not age appropriate and it goes against my Christian values and beliefs.

05:19:32.902 --> 05:19:34.123
I removed this book from framework.

05:19:34.283 --> 05:19:39.364
It's unacceptable for the five-year-olds and six-year-olds to challenge their gender stereotypes.

05:19:39.964 --> 05:19:44.185
Remove all gender identity teaching from the kindergarten through sixth grade framework.

05:19:44.345 --> 05:19:44.985
Thank you very much.

05:19:54.548 --> 05:19:55.609
Hi, my name is Michelle.

05:19:55.949 --> 05:19:57.270
I'm a mother of four children.

05:19:57.871 --> 05:19:59.552
I also have a degree in sociology.

05:19:59.972 --> 05:20:09.500
My knowledge and understanding of human behavior is expansive, and I do not plan on limiting or sheltering my children from valuable information about what the world and society is.

05:20:10.160 --> 05:20:13.183
When it is age appropriate for them to learn it, I expect that they will.

05:20:14.424 --> 05:20:17.706
You want to protect LGBT youth from bullying and discrimination?

05:20:18.207 --> 05:20:21.590
We now have laws and curriculum in place to support that already.

05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:27.572
We already have comprehensive sexual education in our schools that meets the law and is inclusive.

05:20:28.232 --> 05:20:39.116
The content in this framework will absolutely confuse an entire generation of children, especially considering how young instruction on gender, sexuality, and sex is being given.

05:20:39.596 --> 05:20:44.498
You say that the goal is not to cause confusion about gender, etc., but to provide information

05:20:45.058 --> 05:20:53.121
My six-year-old will believe and be curious about anything I or her teachers tell her, because that is the stage of development that she is in.

05:20:53.781 --> 05:20:57.382
You put this pornographic content in the workplace, and it would be a- Time.

05:20:58.242 --> 05:20:58.542
Time.

05:20:58.722 --> 05:20:58.963
Time.

05:21:12.782 --> 05:21:15.344
Preventative measures.

05:21:16.384 --> 05:21:23.268
Hi, my name is Chelsea Erickson and I am a mother of a student in the school, the public school system here in California.

05:21:23.288 --> 05:21:27.931
I have future students possibly in the coming years.

05:21:29.872 --> 05:21:39.414
I understand, as it was stated at the beginning, that the framework and the law are separate and that the school districts have the ability to separate those things.

05:21:39.634 --> 05:21:44.355
The problem that we are facing is that our local school districts are not separating those.

05:21:44.855 --> 05:21:47.096
And they are telling us that their hands are tied.

05:21:47.416 --> 05:21:50.256
They are telling us that they cannot work with us because of that.

05:21:50.656 --> 05:21:52.657
They are telling us that we need to come to you.

05:21:53.237 --> 05:21:56.639
But then we come here and we hear, no, you need to go to your school districts.

05:21:57.000 --> 05:21:59.401
We're feeling a little bit like a ping pong ball right now.

05:21:59.641 --> 05:22:01.783
And it's not very fair to us as parents.

05:22:02.443 --> 05:22:09.248
Things need to be made more clear of what is and what isn't law and what is and what isn't framework for these people.

05:22:10.008 --> 05:22:15.212
I know that there is a lot of good information in this, but there's a lot of bad.

05:22:15.372 --> 05:22:19.515
And if I were to offer you some brownies with a little bit of chocolate... Time.

05:22:19.535 --> 05:22:19.635
Time.

05:22:25.809 --> 05:22:26.470
Hi, good afternoon.

05:22:26.770 --> 05:22:28.292
My name is Amanda McAllister-Wellner.

05:22:28.352 --> 05:22:35.260
I'm the director of the California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network, and we're in strong support of the framework before you today.

05:22:36.701 --> 05:22:44.490
I spend in my role a lot of time looking at health disparities faced by LGBTQ people, high rates of depression, suicide.

05:22:45.511 --> 05:22:46.892
STDs, HIV.

05:22:47.372 --> 05:22:54.377
Last week I had multiple lobby days on the subject and next week I'll be talking about mental health disparities again at the Capitol.

05:22:55.278 --> 05:23:08.047
And this framework presents an opportunity to do some real prevention work and to address the disparities that LGBTQ youth face and that LGBTQ adults face.

05:23:08.867 --> 05:23:13.408
because they didn't have access to comprehensive health education as young people.

05:23:13.649 --> 05:23:22.151
This is an incredibly important step in reducing LGBTQ health disparities, and I thank you for taking the time to put this framework together.

05:23:24.572 --> 05:23:28.913
We'd like to ask speakers 106 to 120 to please enter the boardroom, and speakers 121 to 135 to please line up.

05:23:39.020 --> 05:23:39.380
Is it okay to?

05:23:39.400 --> 05:23:46.103
I'm just waiting to know if it's okay to speak or you want me to wait.

05:23:50.004 --> 05:23:54.766
My name is Mandy Taylor from the California LGBTQ Health and Human Services Network.

05:23:55.867 --> 05:24:01.989
I am also a parent of a child within the California public school system here in Sacramento.

05:24:02.369 --> 05:24:07.391
And I want to thank you for really taking a lot of time and energy to look through this curriculum.

05:24:07.911 --> 05:24:18.381
A lot of the materials that you recommended are actually things that I had already purchased at home for my child as they were getting older, because that information wasn't being offered in school.

05:24:18.501 --> 05:24:22.345
When I asked her, what kind of sexual health information are you getting at school?

05:24:22.365 --> 05:24:23.226
She said, none.

05:24:23.846 --> 05:24:25.347
And said, well, what kind are you getting at home?

05:24:25.387 --> 05:24:26.528
She said, oh, yeah, way better.

05:24:26.889 --> 05:24:32.253
Until they actually had an educator come into their school using this curriculum.

05:24:32.333 --> 05:24:35.255
And she came home and she said, oh, they actually did a really great job.

05:24:35.315 --> 05:24:36.416
And I felt really included.

05:24:37.357 --> 05:24:39.198
So I just want to thank you for that.

05:24:39.579 --> 05:24:42.601
Her peers deserve to have access to the same information.

05:24:43.002 --> 05:24:49.267
Having access to inclusive and medically accurate sexual health information should not be dependent on your parent.

05:24:49.387 --> 05:24:51.408
Every child has a right to that information.

05:24:51.488 --> 05:24:52.089
So thank you.

05:24:56.601 --> 05:24:58.282
Hello, my name is Irene Karkat.

05:24:58.302 --> 05:25:02.485
I'm originally from Ukraine and I'm a mother of two children.

05:25:03.346 --> 05:25:10.771
And it's discrimination against our people because the framework was only available in English and this is against the law.

05:25:11.171 --> 05:25:16.015
There's hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians too in California.

05:25:16.195 --> 05:25:17.236
Please make this right.

05:25:18.336 --> 05:25:20.257
Who recommended these books?

05:25:20.937 --> 05:25:23.559
It's too visual and pornographic for all children.

05:25:24.179 --> 05:25:28.221
It's psychologically abusive and not age appropriate.

05:25:28.481 --> 05:25:28.841
Thank you.

05:25:35.160 --> 05:25:35.700
Good afternoon.

05:25:35.820 --> 05:25:36.661
My name is Michael.

05:25:37.301 --> 05:25:38.461
I'm father of two children.

05:25:38.541 --> 05:25:44.864
I'm extremely against the health framework because when I saw the books and the pictures, I was shocked.

05:25:45.044 --> 05:25:48.825
It is visual pornography.

05:25:48.905 --> 05:25:49.386
I'm sorry.

05:25:50.366 --> 05:25:52.227
It is against the family values.

05:25:52.527 --> 05:25:52.807
Thank you.

05:25:57.912 --> 05:26:09.835
Hi, my name is Cherise and I am a mother, grandmother of 21 kids and foster parent to about 50 mostly high-risk teens over the 32 years.

05:26:10.335 --> 05:26:13.917
This is one of my concerns along with many already presented.

05:26:14.537 --> 05:26:18.478
As you know, victims of sexual abuse is staggering in girls as well as boys.

05:26:18.638 --> 05:26:21.699
Most end up victims and the others the perpetrator.

05:26:22.059 --> 05:26:25.920
The perpetrator many times was unsupervised with smaller children

05:26:26.440 --> 05:26:31.282
And when they had been watched or when they should have been watched, thus protected.

05:26:31.522 --> 05:26:32.842
Think how this can play out.

05:26:33.322 --> 05:26:39.584
Opportunity presents itself to a child and he engages with whatever it was presented in class.

05:26:40.024 --> 05:26:42.945
Then we're all mortified on what occurred.

05:26:43.225 --> 05:26:45.026
They end up prosecuted and labeled.

05:26:45.106 --> 05:26:47.487
And I know this to be true because I've met them.

05:26:48.843 --> 05:26:52.790
I'm very concerned with this curriculum that ideas are being embedded in these children.

05:26:52.830 --> 05:26:55.053
This material should not be presented to any child.

05:26:55.093 --> 05:26:57.457
Please teach reading, math, history, science.

05:26:57.537 --> 05:26:59.441
Let them engage in sports, art.

05:26:59.681 --> 05:27:00.042
Time.

05:27:06.789 --> 05:27:08.870
Hi, my name is Carla.

05:27:08.890 --> 05:27:12.853
I'm a retired teacher and grandmother of two.

05:27:13.133 --> 05:27:19.597
I'm disgusted and reject the implementation of sex in a health framework in school.

05:27:19.737 --> 05:27:21.518
You're trying to normalize something.

05:27:22.159 --> 05:27:28.403
Sex and porn, and we don't want our children, grandchildren exposed to sex at such young ages.

05:27:29.103 --> 05:27:30.083
Tolerance, yes.

05:27:30.203 --> 05:27:30.984
Sex, no.

05:27:31.184 --> 05:27:32.104
This is porn.

05:27:32.664 --> 05:27:37.625
Many schools are failing our kids in reading, writing, math, history, and civics.

05:27:38.145 --> 05:27:46.087
If you can't get it right in the basics, what makes you think showing pictures of sex or anal sex is going to make it right?

05:27:46.507 --> 05:27:52.929
My granddaughter came home after being exposed to this and she said, I'm marrying a girl and she's only nine.

05:27:53.869 --> 05:27:59.391
Sheriff John McGinnis says, you don't have to teach kids to like ice cream or sex.

05:27:59.572 --> 05:28:03.533
Instead, teach character, acceptance, tolerance, and respect.

05:28:03.773 --> 05:28:04.974
We don't need a manual.

05:28:05.574 --> 05:28:07.075
Let our children be children.

05:28:07.395 --> 05:28:07.755
Thank you.

05:28:13.373 --> 05:28:18.877
Hello, my name is Toriana Schaefer, and I'm from Fremont, now attending UCSC.

05:28:19.557 --> 05:28:25.221
I want to thank you for your hard work for LGBTQ inclusion in the health education framework.

05:28:26.062 --> 05:28:33.768
I never learned about trans identity in K-12, only hearing slurs and confusion about transness in the halls.

05:28:34.588 --> 05:28:46.075
I knew that I was non-binary when I was seven, but repressed this until I finally was exposed to a broader community and ideology when I started at UCSC.

05:28:46.756 --> 05:28:51.759
I'm now taking a course on trans theory, and the environment is noticeably warmer.

05:28:52.239 --> 05:28:56.602
Discussion of not only trans people, but the diversity of and epistem-

05:28:57.362 --> 05:29:04.509
Epistemic violence toward this community has made me noticeably more comfortable with both my identity and myself.

05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:08.153
All students deserve this positive self-concept.

05:29:08.754 --> 05:29:15.761
So I commend you on your work towards a more inclusive curriculum and society, and I look forward to seeing it in the future.

05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.490
Hello.

05:29:25.231 --> 05:29:28.513
My name is Natalia Rumaso, and I am against this framework.

05:29:28.673 --> 05:29:31.895
I came from Ukraine to a country of freedom.

05:29:32.335 --> 05:29:33.676
Thanks to God, U.S.

05:29:33.716 --> 05:29:37.959
government, and people, I have a chance to live in a free country.

05:29:38.519 --> 05:29:42.081
High morality is a foundation of our successful life.

05:29:42.602 --> 05:29:43.963
This moment is not new.

05:29:44.143 --> 05:29:47.485
We know the empire of Alexander the Great and the Rome Empire

05:29:47.865 --> 05:29:54.894
Those great empires disappeared because of moral degradation that ruined those empires from inside.

05:29:55.415 --> 05:30:05.407
Another example is Soviet Union, where indoctrination of evil was done on a government level and there was no place left for people with other beliefs.

05:30:06.148 --> 05:30:17.319
I am a patriot of United States and I will do everything possible to make US strong, prosper and a free country where parents can make decisions for their kids, not the government.

05:30:17.760 --> 05:30:25.668
Please oppose this framework and know that we rely on you to make a wise decision for the future of our time.

05:30:34.659 --> 05:30:38.582
My name is Alla Marchak, and I oppose the sex education framework.

05:30:38.642 --> 05:30:41.905
Let kids be kids, and don't make them adults too soon.

05:30:41.985 --> 05:30:59.680
Introducing body parts, inside and out, sexual desires, pleasuring, feeling good, masturbation, telling kids that your body may feel good, warm, tight, excited, telling kids it's okay to do that, telling kids what love is, telling them how parents act in their bedroom,

05:31:00.120 --> 05:31:06.742
Sexually explicit for third graders in chapter 3 on page 119 is not acceptable, okay?

05:31:07.182 --> 05:31:09.082
These books are not acceptable.

05:31:09.143 --> 05:31:11.583
This book was found in a public library.

05:31:11.603 --> 05:31:16.224
It talks about sex, it talks about everything, and it talks very explicitly.

05:31:16.244 --> 05:31:21.546
Do you want your kid to be in your bedroom after they come home?

05:31:22.086 --> 05:31:23.487
And they learned everything.

05:31:23.527 --> 05:31:25.067
And they're going to know what you're doing.

05:31:25.528 --> 05:31:27.548
And you are going to be responsible.

05:31:27.688 --> 05:31:29.329
You're going to be teaching them sex.

05:31:29.849 --> 05:31:32.010
In third grade, this is not appropriate.

05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.931
This is porn.

05:31:33.511 --> 05:31:34.991
And it will make a- Time.

05:31:35.011 --> 05:31:35.172
Time.

05:31:35.192 --> 05:31:35.952
Time.

05:31:35.972 --> 05:31:36.052
Time.

05:31:49.992 --> 05:31:52.934
Alex Timchek, firefighter, paramedic, father of one.

05:31:53.675 --> 05:31:59.179
In George by Alex Gino is an age appropriate book and resource for fifth grade students.

05:31:59.279 --> 05:32:13.530
Teachers should be mindful of personal bias and use gender neutral language and discuss peer and romantic relationships to be inclusive of all students in terms of gender identity, gender expression, sexual attraction.

05:32:13.610 --> 05:32:16.452
For example, they use they instead of he or she.

05:32:17.192 --> 05:32:20.034
This book, George, is not age-appropriate.

05:32:20.094 --> 05:32:27.818
This book promotes dishonesty, pornography, hiding truth from parents, and all-boys-are-evil mentality.

05:32:27.898 --> 05:32:32.020
This book also talks about looking up girl skirts in dirty magazines.

05:32:32.741 --> 05:32:36.423
This book is not appropriate for children to read.

05:32:36.523 --> 05:32:38.984
Why are we pushing this upon our children?

05:32:39.704 --> 05:32:41.445
Remove this book from the framework.

05:32:42.226 --> 05:32:44.887
This type of material is against my religious beliefs.

05:32:45.267 --> 05:32:46.208
Please stop this.

05:32:53.499 --> 05:32:54.640
Hi, my name is Jennica.

05:32:54.780 --> 05:32:57.362
I am here as a concerned parent of two young boys.

05:32:57.923 --> 05:33:01.806
First of all, thank you for removing the resources you have done since the March meeting.

05:33:02.446 --> 05:33:06.230
I'm concerned about the health framework and the early sexualization of our kids.

05:33:06.850 --> 05:33:15.297
Stephanie Gregson has commented to the press that we as concerned parents against this curriculum are misinformed and that we are misrepresenting the power of the law.

05:33:15.858 --> 05:33:21.903
I personally had a meeting with the superintendent of San Juan Unified School District, Kent Kern, who said to take our concerns to the state.

05:33:22.703 --> 05:33:29.550
When we went to get feedback to our district as they were piloting controversial materials for history, social science, it was too late.

05:33:29.930 --> 05:33:34.895
They chose California state approved curriculums to pilot and adopt, even though not mandated to use them.

05:33:35.335 --> 05:33:41.781
While Stephanie has said this framework is not the curriculum and that it only recommends instructional materials and that California leaves it up to districts,

05:33:42.822 --> 05:33:47.143
San Juan, Rockland, and Elk Grove Unified School Districts do not operate in the gray areas.

05:33:47.603 --> 05:33:52.644
Although not mandated, they have shown us recently that they want to conform to what the state recommends.

05:33:52.724 --> 05:33:53.625
So it starts here.

05:33:54.065 --> 05:33:55.805
Here we start... Time.

05:33:57.145 --> 05:34:00.106
We'd like to ask speakers 121 to 135 to please enter the boardroom.

05:34:00.146 --> 05:34:01.526
And speakers 136 to 150 to please line up.

05:34:20.848 --> 05:34:21.328
Am I good to go?

05:34:21.609 --> 05:34:22.489
Okay.

05:34:22.850 --> 05:34:23.570
Good afternoon.

05:34:23.871 --> 05:34:25.012
My name is Rebecca Huey.

05:34:25.432 --> 05:34:32.758
I'm a mom of three beautiful, curious, feral boys, all under the age of seven, who are currently enrolled in California public schools.

05:34:33.339 --> 05:34:38.704
I've had the opportunity to research the new health education framework proposed, and I have some grave concerns.

05:34:39.184 --> 05:34:44.649
I understand this is simply a framework for California schools to provide resources for teachers, parents, and the community.

05:34:45.169 --> 05:34:52.777
However, I also understand that a large majority of California schools will follow the suggested framework as well as the suggested readings and resources with fervor.

05:34:53.677 --> 05:35:04.148
Although I have severe concerns regarding the framework as it pertains to sexual education in grades 7 through 12, which are unnecessarily overt and overly sexual in nature, since my boys are young at the moment,

05:35:06.660 --> 05:35:10.122
I was going to address my concerns with the suggested readings for grades K through 3.

05:35:10.462 --> 05:35:21.446
I am now so thankful you've rightfully chosen to remove a lot of the controversial suggested readings from the framework, and I ask that you also remove the It's Not My Stork book, which is sexually explicit graphics depicted in a cartoon fashion.

05:35:21.766 --> 05:35:25.448
Reject the framework and remove them from the suggested resources section as well.

05:35:33.214 --> 05:35:35.515
Hello, my name is Alma, and I am a mother of eight.

05:35:36.356 --> 05:35:43.000
I believe that a sex education without the dignity of the body, it's pornography.

05:35:43.881 --> 05:35:48.403
And unfortunately, I am afraid that you maybe don't even see that clearly.

05:35:48.423 --> 05:35:56.829
I am afraid that this framework is going to be accepted and the consequences that not only my children will face, but also the whole society.

05:35:57.769 --> 05:36:07.737
I am here to implore you to really answer the questions and the questions I have for you that I have made to myself constantly.

05:36:08.258 --> 05:36:09.018
Who are you?

05:36:10.059 --> 05:36:11.841
And what is the purpose of your life?

05:36:12.661 --> 05:36:25.331
If you answer these questions, I'm sure you will be more careful on deciding on this framework, because the purpose of your life will make a difference in my children, in this society, in our America, in our California.

05:36:25.712 --> 05:36:26.032
Thank you.

05:36:37.059 --> 05:36:38.440
Hi, my name is Maria.

05:36:38.600 --> 05:36:40.280
I am a mother of 10 children.

05:36:41.061 --> 05:36:42.801
I am against the health framework.

05:36:43.101 --> 05:36:46.083
I am here today to defend the innocence of my children.

05:36:46.603 --> 05:36:50.084
I believe they have the right to a healthy and safe environment.

05:36:50.745 --> 05:36:56.187
I think that this health framework is a physical and mental abuse to my children.

05:36:56.707 --> 05:37:03.190
And if I have to take them out of public school to protect them from the perverted minds, I will do so.

05:37:03.570 --> 05:37:03.910
Thank you.

05:37:13.944 --> 05:37:15.545
Buenas tardes, mi nombre es Teresa.

05:37:16.285 --> 05:37:21.767
Yo vengo, estoy fijandome que el framework dice que es un programa de inclusión.

05:37:31.611 --> 05:37:32.071
Mi nombre es

05:37:35.743 --> 05:37:36.764
My name is Teresa Vera.

05:37:37.224 --> 05:37:40.905
I'm listening.

05:37:41.785 --> 05:37:45.846
I'm hearing that the program on this framework is to be inclusive.

05:37:46.666 --> 05:37:52.127
You're including the LGBT community and I don't have any problems with them.

05:37:52.167 --> 05:37:54.728
But you're excluding all the rest of our children.

05:38:04.472 --> 05:38:10.115
So it's not as inclusive as you're presenting it.

05:38:10.135 --> 05:38:20.201
The case is that you folks are lying to us, are lying to all of California.

05:38:20.741 --> 05:38:25.904
I have a lot of people in my family that they are teachers and nobody knows anything about this.

05:38:35.241 --> 05:38:37.543
So why are you hiding everything?

05:38:42.027 --> 05:38:44.289
You're using our taxes with our children.

05:38:47.332 --> 05:38:50.115
And this is our responsibility, not yours.

05:38:50.235 --> 05:38:53.718
What are we going to do with this nation?

05:38:54.018 --> 05:38:54.959
We're going to destroy it.

05:38:55.416 --> 05:39:00.983
I ask you please to include everyone, but not with pornography and based on lies.

05:39:01.023 --> 05:39:01.544
Thank you.

05:39:16.417 --> 05:39:18.218
Hi, my name is Ofelia.

05:39:18.358 --> 05:39:24.782
I'm a mother of 13 and nine grandchildren, and I'm totally opposed to this framework.

05:39:25.603 --> 05:39:36.009
To me, as for many parents who are not here to speak, it's an injustice to our children, it's sinful, and it's corruptive, and it's against the human nature.

05:39:37.050 --> 05:39:40.352
And it will expose our children to sex trafficking,

05:39:41.312 --> 05:39:48.036
And it is not your concern to teach them, but it's ours, in my concern, to teach them what is best for them.

05:39:48.056 --> 05:39:52.980
Because they were made to be happy, to live eternally happy.

05:39:53.600 --> 05:39:56.402
And this framework is doing the opposite.

05:39:57.583 --> 05:40:02.866
So I really encourage you, I really urge you to reject this framework, please.

05:40:14.193 --> 05:40:15.395
My name is Maria Carlos.

05:40:15.415 --> 05:40:23.306
I'm a mom of five.

05:40:38.934 --> 05:40:42.495
And I'm very worried about their education.

05:40:42.775 --> 05:40:45.577
My husband and myself take care of their education.

05:40:50.019 --> 05:40:53.101
Sexual education and everything that has to do with their bodies.

05:40:54.681 --> 05:40:57.843
Gracias a Dios y a la iglesia que nos enseña

05:40:59.281 --> 05:41:03.683
Thanks to God and to church that teaches us how to treat our kids.

05:41:03.783 --> 05:41:08.286
I think that sexual education should be done by their parents.

05:41:08.346 --> 05:41:11.467
Their parents need to talk to their kids about this.

05:41:29.582 --> 05:41:34.484
and that what school teaches should be math and other things that they need for life.

05:41:34.605 --> 05:41:37.406
I implore you not to put dirt in their minds because they are too young.

05:41:37.426 --> 05:41:40.908
It's not too late so that you please change your minds because you also have kids

05:41:58.081 --> 05:42:00.503
Y no les gustaría que le llenaran su mente con basura.

05:42:00.763 --> 05:42:04.325
And you would not like your kids to have their minds filled with garbage.

05:42:05.185 --> 05:42:05.666
Gracias.

05:42:05.846 --> 05:42:06.246
Thank you.

05:42:18.113 --> 05:42:19.234
Hola, buenas tardes.

05:42:19.654 --> 05:42:20.775
Mi nombre es Nancy.

05:42:21.015 --> 05:42:22.536
Hello, good afternoon.

05:42:22.596 --> 05:42:23.657
My name is Nancy.

05:42:24.353 --> 05:42:27.855
Yo soy maestra de secundaria en mi país de origen, en México.

05:42:28.075 --> 05:42:33.177
I am a teacher of high school in my nation of origin, Mexico.

05:42:33.197 --> 05:42:38.919
Y aquí estoy trabajando como asistente de maestra de kindergarten.

05:42:39.279 --> 05:42:42.681
And here I work as an assistant teacher for kindergarten.

05:42:43.812 --> 05:42:50.458
Y bueno, el día de hoy estoy aquí porque estoy muy preocupada por nuestros niños y por nuestro futuro.

05:42:50.799 --> 05:42:55.443
And I'm here today because I'm very concerned about our kids and their future.

05:42:57.084 --> 05:43:07.474
Perdón, pero no puedo aceptar la idea de que en las escuelas se tenga que enseñar de una manera tan inapropiada acerca de la educación sexual.

05:43:07.870 --> 05:43:13.613
I'm sorry, but I cannot agree that schools should teach about sexual education.

05:43:13.813 --> 05:43:15.494
I think it's inappropriate way.

05:43:16.875 --> 05:43:23.558
En lugar de enseñar contenido académico que les va a servir para su futuro, para su vida.

05:43:23.878 --> 05:43:30.262
Instead of teaching academic content that it's what's going to serve them for their future and their lives.

05:43:31.442 --> 05:43:36.825
Honestamente, siento que se está violando el derecho de los padres de familia.

05:43:37.168 --> 05:43:41.711
Honestly, I think that the rights of the parents are being violated.

05:43:42.952 --> 05:43:49.357
Son ellos quienes deciden cómo y de qué manera, en qué momento.

05:43:49.997 --> 05:43:53.140
They are the ones that decide how, when.

05:43:55.501 --> 05:44:00.105
Quieren enseñar sobre sexualidad a sus propios hijos.

05:44:00.205 --> 05:44:06.049
So when, how, and with what intensity to teach about sexual education to their own kids.

05:44:06.943 --> 05:44:08.464
Por favor, le suplico.

05:44:08.964 --> 05:44:10.745
Please, I beg you.

05:44:11.386 --> 05:44:13.547
Que rechacen este framework.

05:44:13.827 --> 05:44:15.228
Reject this framework.

05:44:15.768 --> 05:44:20.251
Que solo está formando niños y jóvenes confundidos.

05:44:20.971 --> 05:44:24.333
That only is forming confused youth.

05:44:24.933 --> 05:44:25.254
Thank you.

05:44:35.484 --> 05:44:37.605
My name is Libby Leopold.

05:44:38.766 --> 05:44:42.229
I'm married 29 years and mother seven.

05:44:43.850 --> 05:44:49.613
I'm here to say I do not agree or accept this framework.

05:44:52.155 --> 05:44:57.078
Let us, the parents, teach about sex education.

05:44:59.020 --> 05:45:01.001
Let the kids be kids.

05:45:02.302 --> 05:45:02.622
Thank you.

05:45:08.837 --> 05:45:09.818
Hi, I'm Jennifer.

05:45:10.619 --> 05:45:18.109
As the timeline was reviewed, it's obvious that it's been worked on for a long time and that this opposition you're seeing is coming late in the process.

05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:23.497
But that's just because the parents and concerned citizens have just been learning what the framework actually looks like.

05:45:24.057 --> 05:45:27.218
I've read through it and 80 to 90% of it's fine.

05:45:27.939 --> 05:45:32.140
Most people agree that bullying and discrimination in any form is inappropriate.

05:45:32.560 --> 05:45:40.563
However, there is a difference between teaching to not bully those with different sexual orientation and teaching gender fluidity.

05:45:41.224 --> 05:45:45.965
Scientists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors do not agree on this topic.

05:45:46.486 --> 05:45:51.828
Yet, the California education system is recommending it be taught as fact starting in kindergarten.

05:45:52.728 --> 05:45:55.490
I thank you for removing most of the controversial books.

05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:59.312
However, there are still changes needed to make this framework agreeable to most.

05:45:59.792 --> 05:46:01.714
Obviously, it'll never be agreeable to everyone.

05:46:02.114 --> 05:46:11.280
But I request that you table the growth and development sections of K-3, growth and development in sexual health for the older kids, and pass the rest of it.

05:46:11.500 --> 05:46:11.780
Thank you.

05:46:16.926 --> 05:46:21.451
Good afternoon, I am registered nurse Nelly Tucanco and I'm here as a very concerned parent.

05:46:22.592 --> 05:46:26.677
The sex education curriculum goes way beyond the expectations outlined by AB 329.

05:46:27.157 --> 05:46:35.126
It contains sexually explicit and graphic material content and it's not age appropriate or scientifically accurate.

05:46:35.906 --> 05:46:38.407
It teaches kids detailed sex acts.

05:46:38.488 --> 05:46:39.968
This is mental rape.

05:46:40.929 --> 05:46:43.890
It teaches topics like gender identity.

05:46:43.970 --> 05:46:46.892
That should be a parent's job, not the school's.

05:46:48.273 --> 05:46:50.354
Gender fluidity is not science-based.

05:46:50.694 --> 05:46:51.954
Your chromosomes don't lie.

05:46:52.034 --> 05:46:53.115
Remember your chromosomes?

05:46:53.595 --> 05:46:55.656
XX female, XY male.

05:46:56.417 --> 05:46:59.738
Also, including pedophiles like Harmey Milk is not okay.

05:47:00.079 --> 05:47:03.720
He had sex with boys, one of which ended up committing suicide.

05:47:05.001 --> 05:47:09.206
So this curriculum will also increase human trafficking and STDs.

05:47:09.246 --> 05:47:11.668
There is no way that this is going to decrease it.

05:47:12.009 --> 05:47:17.314
Abortion giants that want to target the youth so they can have more abortions and sell more aborted baby parts.

05:47:17.374 --> 05:47:18.055
I'm not kidding.

05:47:18.395 --> 05:47:19.076
Who are these people?

05:47:28.493 --> 05:47:31.354
Good afternoon.

05:47:31.494 --> 05:47:32.154
My name is Amy.

05:47:32.574 --> 05:47:35.035
I have three children in the California public school system.

05:47:35.635 --> 05:47:42.257
The Center for Disease Control states in their literature that delaying sexual activity in youth reduces the risk of physical harm.

05:47:42.837 --> 05:47:50.079
California Child Protection Services standards states that intentionally exposing youth to pornography falls within the parameters of child abuse.

05:47:50.599 --> 05:47:55.781
Yet this framework introduces porn to our young impressionable kids behind the false label of sex ed.

05:47:56.321 --> 05:48:03.244
I keep hearing proponents of this repulsive framework use the phrase, our kids have the right to access this information for their health and well-being.

05:48:03.984 --> 05:48:13.628
So their message to children is that they may not have lost all their baby teeth yet, they're years away from being legally able to drive a car, and they cannot see an R-rated movie without an accompanying parent or adult.

05:48:13.988 --> 05:48:23.752
But it's OK for this public school health curriculum to promote and encourage deviant, promiscuous, and often dangerous sexual relationships, ideas, and acts, along with pornographic images,

05:48:24.713 --> 05:48:30.061
and reminds kids numerous times of all the birth control they can obtain and abortions they can have without their parents' knowledge.

05:48:30.481 --> 05:48:33.125
Dangerous, life-altering decisions that will change their bodies.

05:48:33.906 --> 05:48:34.928
Reject that framework.

05:48:43.755 --> 05:48:45.376
Good day to you, fellow members.

05:48:45.656 --> 05:48:46.997
My name is Victoria Prokopchuk.

05:48:47.317 --> 05:48:51.019
I am an informed and concerned parent of seven children.

05:48:51.859 --> 05:48:54.181
I have allowed all my children to live.

05:48:54.801 --> 05:48:58.023
I strongly oppose this new so-called sex-ed framework.

05:48:58.943 --> 05:49:04.467
It is mind-boggling how pedophilia can be a part of a classroom curriculum.

05:49:05.147 --> 05:49:09.730
I would like to state a fact known to all humanity.

05:49:10.430 --> 05:49:16.394
The very first history of the LGBT known to man was Sodom and Gomorrah.

05:49:17.755 --> 05:49:24.099
Schools have the obligation to teach kids reading, writing, arithmetic, science, and history.

05:49:25.700 --> 05:49:27.541
Everything else is our parents' job.

05:49:28.928 --> 05:49:29.949
They are my kids.

05:49:30.949 --> 05:49:32.990
I'm the boss.

05:49:33.611 --> 05:49:34.751
I am their advocate.

05:49:35.652 --> 05:49:43.297
And today's health ed curriculum, this mama bear has become the mama grizzly.

05:49:44.277 --> 05:49:44.637
Thank you.

05:49:46.679 --> 05:49:52.002
We need to ask speakers 136 to 150 to please enter the boardroom.

05:49:53.102 --> 05:49:54.803
And speakers 151 to 165 to please line up.

05:50:01.259 --> 05:50:11.908
Okay, hello everyone.

05:50:11.928 --> 05:50:16.912
My name is Tatiana and I am here as a concerned mom and a concerned educator.

05:50:17.353 --> 05:50:24.759
I teach young children and I believe that my job is to teach them to write, to read, and to do math.

05:50:24.959 --> 05:50:26.881
Our children are not reading.

05:50:27.001 --> 05:50:28.242
They're not writing.

05:50:28.622 --> 05:50:32.047
They're very low in California, and that disturbs me.

05:50:32.387 --> 05:50:41.539
And now we're pushing some kind of curriculum that I will not teach, and I think it is wrong to teach it, and I don't want my children to be a part of it.

05:50:41.559 --> 05:50:42.860
I don't want to teach it.

05:50:47.126 --> 05:50:57.853
I also heard some of the people over here saying that they're going to use this money to educate teachers and do personal development.

05:50:58.694 --> 05:51:05.079
We need to use that personal development money to teach teachers how to teach math, science, English.

05:51:05.219 --> 05:51:06.800
Those are the things that we need to be teaching.

05:51:06.860 --> 05:51:08.161
Leave the rest to the parents.

05:51:08.521 --> 05:51:09.502
That's their children.

05:51:09.602 --> 05:51:10.343
It's their right.

05:51:10.663 --> 05:51:11.844
Protect our children.

05:51:12.144 --> 05:51:12.564
Time.

05:51:13.185 --> 05:51:13.685
Stand out.

05:51:13.985 --> 05:51:14.245
Time.

05:51:22.822 --> 05:51:24.844
Hi, my name is Taras, and I'm a father.

05:51:24.864 --> 05:51:34.511
And in the book, From the Kindergarten to the Third Grade, teachers can introduce the concept that gender doesn't always match biology.

05:51:34.571 --> 05:51:43.258
In the book, Who Are You for the First Grader, teachers can tell the kids that gender is not only boy or girl, it's somebody else.

05:51:43.838 --> 05:51:50.283
At seven years of age, statistically, children, they just finally learn what is left and what is right.

05:51:50.623 --> 05:51:52.144
They don't need to know gender.

05:51:52.164 --> 05:51:57.467
They don't need to know all this about the sexuality from such a young age.

05:51:58.908 --> 05:52:01.230
They still learn how to separate good from bad.

05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:02.490
And this is what they need to concentrate.

05:52:02.510 --> 05:52:12.236
They need to concentrate on the toys, and how to play, and how to grow up, how to make a good decision in life, healthy decision in life, not about sexuality.

05:52:15.318 --> 05:52:22.862
And in book from Be Good, Be Real, Be Ready, it promotes how to make sex.

05:52:22.882 --> 05:52:24.984
It doesn't promote anything about sexual.

05:52:25.004 --> 05:52:26.765
It just promotes how to make sex.

05:52:26.825 --> 05:52:27.085
Time.

05:52:28.806 --> 05:52:29.006
Time.

05:52:34.833 --> 05:52:45.766
Hi, my name is Zelina, and I am a mother of three, soon to be four, and I was told not to mention anything about religion, but I just basically say that I am against this framework.

05:52:46.186 --> 05:52:47.588
But for me, I can't go that way.

05:52:47.868 --> 05:52:49.831
I do have to mention something about God.

05:52:50.211 --> 05:52:52.592
Because God is the beginning and he is the end.

05:52:54.213 --> 05:52:56.313
And he needs to be in the center of this.

05:52:56.653 --> 05:53:01.155
And I don't care if you believe in God or if you don't, but he is 100% real.

05:53:02.135 --> 05:53:05.997
And he will judge this nation and he will judge California.

05:53:06.377 --> 05:53:08.658
And we as parents, we are prayer warriors.

05:53:08.718 --> 05:53:10.398
We're not concerned about our kids.

05:53:10.819 --> 05:53:14.120
We're concerned about your kids and about your future.

05:53:14.380 --> 05:53:16.721
Please remove this framework.

05:53:16.861 --> 05:53:17.221
Thank you.

05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:30.873
Hi, I'm Nancy Romo, and I'm a single mother of four.

05:53:31.773 --> 05:53:40.079
I have been dealing with the school for the past two weeks about all this, and they had me bouncing back and forth like a ping pong ball, not telling me what's going on, not wanting to give me information.

05:53:40.559 --> 05:53:46.704
Yet the teacher tells me that if I don't let my child attend these classes, that she was going to report me to the state and tell them that I'm not being compliant.

05:53:47.264 --> 05:53:54.289
And I was also told, and this is at the Twin River School District, and I was also told by the counselor at the elementary school that I have no religious rights.

05:53:56.614 --> 05:53:57.615
Everything is just crazy.

05:53:57.695 --> 05:54:00.397
When I seen the material, my mouth dropped.

05:54:01.358 --> 05:54:14.609
To show kids a picture of a woman's vagina and have them all color it and tell them, color the clitoris this color, color, outline the vagina this color, and color the anus any color you like.

05:54:15.149 --> 05:54:16.290
Like, what is that putting in?

05:54:16.310 --> 05:54:18.772
You're going to have a room full of perverted little children.

05:54:19.133 --> 05:54:19.933
That's what the school is going to do.

05:54:19.953 --> 05:54:20.314
This is crazy.

05:54:24.597 --> 05:54:31.553
I've been having panic attacks and anxiety for the past two weeks and I just can't believe and I object.

05:54:36.710 --> 05:54:38.691
One, my name is Tacey Prince-Woodleaf.

05:54:38.891 --> 05:54:40.652
I'm 17, and I'm from Berkeley, California.

05:54:41.333 --> 05:54:42.874
I'm here today with the GSA Network.

05:54:43.194 --> 05:54:49.857
So I transitioned in fourth grade, and that was before I'd had any puberty, so I never had the chance to be normal in this way.

05:54:50.778 --> 05:54:54.340
In fifth grade, they split us up into groups, boys and girls, and I went with the girls.

05:54:54.900 --> 05:54:59.183
We talked about periods and tampons and pads, and I was just thinking, like, none of this applies to me.

05:55:00.143 --> 05:55:04.186
I never saw myself reflected in sex ed, and I still never have.

05:55:04.586 --> 05:55:07.568
Because of this, for the longest time, I just thought that I could never have sex.

05:55:08.068 --> 05:55:10.009
I thought that I could never be in a real relationship.

05:55:10.770 --> 05:55:12.711
Since then, I've realized that this is not true.

05:55:12.731 --> 05:55:18.054
I can be in a relationship just like any straight cis person can, but I'm still affected by my miseducation.

05:55:18.654 --> 05:55:22.657
I have a deep-rooted insecurity about relationships and my ability to participate in them.

05:55:23.417 --> 05:55:31.908
If I had had good sex ed that reflected my identity and my experience, then I would be so much more comfortable in my skin and I would have been saved a whole lot of pain and self-hatred.

05:55:32.849 --> 05:55:36.213
I think this framework can help provide that for me and countless other trans and queer people.

05:55:36.614 --> 05:55:37.195
Thank you so much.

05:55:43.564 --> 05:55:46.266
Good afternoon, members and everyone present here.

05:55:46.647 --> 05:55:48.028
My name is Tatyana Konvalchuk.

05:55:48.728 --> 05:55:53.192
I am an informed parent of four young children, and I'm very concerned.

05:55:53.793 --> 05:56:07.184
I have spent countless hours studying and researching this framework, and I'm here to stand against it because from what I see, this is not a safe education.

05:56:07.444 --> 05:56:09.166
In fact, it's not an education at all.

05:56:10.567 --> 05:56:14.690
It's a spiritual, emotional, sexual, physical abuse to our children.

05:56:15.651 --> 05:56:27.180
The pages of these books, these guidelines, recommendations are opening the doors to the darkness of sexual abuse, violence, destruction in community, and drugs and imprisonment down the road.

05:56:27.380 --> 05:56:33.605
I have been given a blessing and responsibility to raise four children in this country for the future of this country.

05:56:34.345 --> 05:56:35.547
and hopefully for God's glory.

05:56:36.348 --> 05:56:40.813
I don't see how this framework saves or protects individual rights at all.

05:56:41.254 --> 05:56:46.400
I see how this framework takes away parents' proper rights.

05:56:46.841 --> 05:56:47.121
Time.

05:56:48.443 --> 05:56:48.703
Time.

05:56:48.723 --> 05:56:49.784
Time.

05:56:49.804 --> 05:56:50.005
Time.

05:56:55.908 --> 05:56:56.128
Hello.

05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:57.509
My name is Yulia Shpinova.

05:56:57.529 --> 05:57:01.830
I'm a mother of three, 21, 13, and 11 years old.

05:57:02.870 --> 05:57:06.732
I am against this framework.

05:57:07.412 --> 05:57:10.813
And I just want to say a word of God.

05:57:11.113 --> 05:57:14.315
For this reason, God delivered them to a degrading patient.

05:57:14.815 --> 05:57:20.597
And there, females exchange their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural.

05:57:21.497 --> 05:57:30.182
In the same way, their males also abandoned their natural sexual function toward females and burned it with lust toward one another.

05:57:30.742 --> 05:57:39.147
Males committed indecent act with males and received within themselves the appropriate penalty for their deviation.

05:57:40.308 --> 05:57:40.588
Thank you.

05:57:45.802 --> 05:57:47.283
Hi my name is Patty Reyes.

05:57:47.423 --> 05:57:50.184
I'm an 18 year old college freshman from Orange County.

05:57:50.584 --> 05:57:52.205
I think all views should be respected.

05:57:52.465 --> 05:57:55.866
I'm a Catholic and I firmly believe God created us male and female.

05:57:56.226 --> 05:57:57.927
We should not be shamed for our beliefs.

05:57:58.407 --> 05:58:02.209
This is America where speech and religious beliefs should be protected.

05:58:02.709 --> 05:58:07.031
But myself and many other students like me are afraid that this freedom may be at stake.

05:58:07.391 --> 05:58:11.553
Please don't rip away the beautiful innocence and childhood that these children deserve.

05:58:11.733 --> 05:58:12.033
Thank you.

05:58:18.991 --> 05:58:19.451
Good evening.

05:58:19.811 --> 05:58:21.312
My name is Carlos Reyes.

05:58:21.632 --> 05:58:22.532
I'm from Orange County.

05:58:22.672 --> 05:58:24.013
I'm married to my wife, Patricia.

05:58:24.053 --> 05:58:24.973
We have six kids.

05:58:25.614 --> 05:58:27.574
We've been married for 20 years, and I'm Catholic.

05:58:28.395 --> 05:58:37.018
I just want to say, when I came in, in the walls, it says, it was the secrets of heaven and earth that I desired to learn.

05:58:37.218 --> 05:58:41.520
Mary Shelley, and she's talking about heaven and earth, and these are the things that we want to learn.

05:58:41.800 --> 05:58:43.021
What is in heaven and earth?

05:58:43.261 --> 05:58:44.321
Heaven that is brought from us.

05:58:44.441 --> 05:58:48.503
And it mentions heaven, God, and earth, something from us, humans.

05:58:49.043 --> 05:58:54.547
And it's very important for me to teach healthy sex education to my children.

05:58:55.588 --> 05:58:59.811
We can teach it in the house and it can also be taught in the house in school.

05:59:00.232 --> 05:59:03.074
But it's mostly started in the house.

05:59:03.634 --> 05:59:13.262
If I don't bring pornography into my house at all, never have, am I gonna start bringing it inside the house to further teach my kids with their health education?

05:59:13.762 --> 05:59:17.485
This is something very important and I am against the framework, thank you.

05:59:19.656 --> 05:59:25.100
We'd like to ask speakers 151 to 165 to please enter the state boardroom.

05:59:25.720 --> 05:59:28.222
And we would like speakers 167 to 180 to please line up.

05:59:44.341 --> 05:59:45.582
I reject the framework.

05:59:45.722 --> 05:59:47.262
Hi my name is Priscilla Reyes.

05:59:47.462 --> 05:59:50.804
I'm 12 years old and I come from Orange County California.

05:59:50.964 --> 05:59:56.767
I'm in sixth grade and I don't want my friends and family to get confused about their gender.

05:59:57.367 --> 05:59:59.528
This will not make us more safe.

05:59:59.688 --> 06:00:00.589
It will confuse us.

06:00:00.829 --> 06:00:01.969
Just let us be kids.

06:00:02.389 --> 06:00:04.991
I want education not sex classes.

06:00:05.211 --> 06:00:05.551
Thank you.

06:00:12.025 --> 06:00:13.527
Hi, my name is Carlos Reyes.

06:00:14.187 --> 06:00:16.469
I'm in 10th grade, and I redirect your framework.

06:00:17.050 --> 06:00:20.153
I believe all students and their different beliefs should be respected.

06:00:20.574 --> 06:00:24.097
I'm a Catholic, and I believe God created us male or female.

06:00:24.598 --> 06:00:32.786
By teaching gender as open-ended as this tells me my beliefs must be false and brings shame on me and other students whose beliefs are the same.

06:00:33.607 --> 06:00:35.068
I am not a social experiment.

06:00:35.729 --> 06:00:35.929
Thanks.

06:00:44.059 --> 06:00:44.619
Good afternoon.

06:00:44.659 --> 06:00:45.680
My name is Jonathan Clay.

06:00:45.900 --> 06:00:47.560
I'm here to support the health framework.

06:00:48.101 --> 06:00:54.583
Given the time, I'd like to associate my comments with those of the state PTA who spoke earlier and the many youth that have come here to share their stories today.

06:00:55.864 --> 06:00:58.865
Sometimes it's a little hard for me to get there, so bear with me.

06:00:59.405 --> 06:01:03.867
My wife and I have been on an interesting journey, and we're the parents of a child that doesn't fit the typical norm.

06:01:06.241 --> 06:01:12.185
And, you know, we appreciate the embodiment of the diversity and inclusivity that's represented here in the health framework.

06:01:13.725 --> 06:01:24.152
This is not a journey that we thought we'd go down that path of, and it doesn't have anything to do with our beliefs, what we were taught in school, or, you know, who we associate with it.

06:01:24.512 --> 06:01:26.193
It was because this is who our child is.

06:01:29.372 --> 06:01:35.397
It makes me sad, but I do remember the first time my child became aware of other people like himself.

06:01:35.877 --> 06:01:45.465
We started on this path at first grade, and when he became aware that there were other people that were different like him, I just remember the joy that he shared with me in learning.

06:01:45.485 --> 06:01:45.725
Time.

06:01:46.625 --> 06:01:46.906
Thank you.

06:01:53.757 --> 06:01:54.737
Hi, my name is Rita.

06:01:55.397 --> 06:01:56.778
I'm totally disgusted.

06:01:56.858 --> 06:01:58.098
I reject this framework.

06:01:58.518 --> 06:02:06.379
How highly educated people that we put in place could submit pornography and teaching them at such a young age.

06:02:07.119 --> 06:02:08.720
Sodom and Gomorrah did fall.

06:02:09.620 --> 06:02:11.780
You are setting America up to fall.

06:02:12.260 --> 06:02:13.841
Are you going to create more prisons?

06:02:14.201 --> 06:02:21.662
So in 20 years, by the time you've educated these kids with this porn and they go and commit the crimes, you're going to lock them away.

06:02:22.708 --> 06:02:23.773
That's all I have to say.

06:02:23.934 --> 06:02:25.662
Please reject the framework.

06:02:33.942 --> 06:02:39.446
My name is Donna Goulart, and I'm a teacher of 28 years, and I do have grave concerns about this framework.

06:02:39.926 --> 06:02:44.449
One of the greatest pleasures in life is seeing life through the eyes of a child and the innocence they exude.

06:02:44.849 --> 06:02:50.733
This framework and its early sexualization and indoctrination of impressionable children robs them of that innocence.

06:02:51.354 --> 06:02:54.596
It would only be confusing and harmful to their psychological well-being.

06:02:55.036 --> 06:03:03.602
This framework and the CSE are not healthy for students, and it would be untenable for myself and many other educators as well to teach.

06:03:04.282 --> 06:03:06.163
I do teach third grade in a recommended book.

06:03:06.303 --> 06:03:07.083
It's not the Stork.

06:03:07.203 --> 06:03:07.884
Please remove it.

06:03:08.684 --> 06:03:19.049
Explicitly described sexual intercourse along with pictures and is recommended in the writing state standards 3.1 informative explanatory to write a three paragraph essay on sexual intercourse.

06:03:19.329 --> 06:03:21.070
We're talking seven and eight year olds.

06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:24.371
And as far as bullying in any sort, it should not happen.

06:03:24.652 --> 06:03:27.833
And I teach my students every day to be kind and to help others.

06:03:28.534 --> 06:03:31.475
Most teachers and parents aren't even aware of the CSE that's coming.

06:03:31.915 --> 06:03:34.297
School is a place where parents trust their children to be.

06:03:34.637 --> 06:03:38.599
And if the lawmakers are not going to respect the rights of parents, then they're going to...

06:03:46.420 --> 06:03:49.042
Hi, my name is Carolyn, and I'm a concerned parent.

06:03:49.583 --> 06:03:51.464
Motherhood has been my greatest joy.

06:03:51.544 --> 06:03:52.846
I have two amazing boys.

06:03:52.926 --> 06:03:56.248
They're kind, God-centered, loving, and thriving.

06:03:56.969 --> 06:03:58.570
I was blessed to be a stay-at-home mom.

06:03:58.630 --> 06:03:59.711
I was very protective.

06:04:00.272 --> 06:04:04.335
When they were young, I taught them about stranger danger, monitored their TV, computer, phone.

06:04:04.375 --> 06:04:06.837
I knew their friends and the families of their friends.

06:04:07.578 --> 06:04:10.701
Sex was to be cherished in a marriage relationship.

06:04:11.201 --> 06:04:23.246
When I started going through the framework and some of the books that were recommended, I was just horrified that they would teach such young children graphic sexual implicit materials.

06:04:23.686 --> 06:04:31.889
And in high school, just horrified by the just anything goes in the horrific sex ed books.

06:04:31.989 --> 06:04:34.450
I do appreciate that you've taken some of those off the table.

06:04:34.910 --> 06:04:40.052
But you did say that it's not because you disapprove them, because they had caused some controversy.

06:04:41.555 --> 06:04:45.546
I disagree with the over-sexualization of the children, especially in kindergarten.

06:04:45.827 --> 06:04:47.713
When do they get to be kids and get to play?

06:04:55.370 --> 06:04:55.890
Good afternoon.

06:04:56.511 --> 06:04:57.732
My name is Cipollito Fernandez.

06:04:57.752 --> 06:04:59.694
I'm a retired deputy sheriff.

06:04:59.894 --> 06:05:00.695
I'm a grandfather.

06:05:01.195 --> 06:05:01.796
I'm a father.

06:05:02.676 --> 06:05:03.157
I'm an uncle.

06:05:03.177 --> 06:05:07.100
I know a lot of youngsters.

06:05:07.841 --> 06:05:10.283
This bill will take our kids' innocence away.

06:05:11.024 --> 06:05:12.064
This bill is

06:05:12.845 --> 06:05:15.627
creating a problem where there's no problem.

06:05:16.187 --> 06:05:21.571
Sexual education at this young age has no business in our children's lives.

06:05:22.371 --> 06:05:23.972
That's not the role of government.

06:05:24.432 --> 06:05:29.596
This is trying to destroy the future of our generations.

06:05:30.476 --> 06:05:32.938
You have real issues after

06:05:34.898 --> 06:05:38.179
High school dropouts, it's at its highest.

06:05:39.019 --> 06:05:47.303
High school grads that can't read and write, those are issues that our education department has to address.

06:05:48.863 --> 06:05:57.207
I dislike and disagree 100% with the health education framework because of our children's future is at stake.

06:06:06.044 --> 06:06:07.324
Hi, my name is Olga.

06:06:07.344 --> 06:06:08.385
I'm a mom of three kids.

06:06:08.705 --> 06:06:09.405
I'm here for them.

06:06:09.545 --> 06:06:19.508
I'm here very concerned about the framework which takes away our rights to make our own decisions about the books which endanger our children's psychology and health.

06:06:20.428 --> 06:06:22.189
For example, one of them, Grade 9 to 12,

06:06:24.731 --> 06:06:33.985
Sex the all you need to know about sexuality guide to get you through your teens and 20s It teaches step-by-step about body fluid body play cutting piercing.

06:06:34.325 --> 06:06:35.267
This is insane.

06:06:35.808 --> 06:06:38.031
Please protect our and your children.

06:06:38.231 --> 06:06:38.512
Thank you

06:06:42.403 --> 06:06:50.750
Hi, my name is Mila Ignatieff, and as a parent of two kids, elementary students, I want to say thank you for providing free education for my kids.

06:06:51.190 --> 06:07:02.160
And when I send my kids to school, I want them to learn about American history, how to solve math problems, and this is my responsibility, how and when to teach them about sex, according to my beliefs.

06:07:02.800 --> 06:07:08.322
And so I strongly believe that this health framework is a sexual abuse of little kids.

06:07:08.742 --> 06:07:10.963
And that's why I oppose this curriculum.

06:07:11.603 --> 06:07:19.606
This is not a healthy education for little students, like elementary students, maybe high schoolers, but not for innocent kids.

06:07:19.806 --> 06:07:20.146
Thank you.

06:07:27.068 --> 06:07:32.452
Hello, my name is Valery, and I'm a parent of an elementary and middle school kid.

06:07:34.613 --> 06:07:39.676
And I strongly oppose the current agenda and health framework that's

06:07:42.518 --> 06:07:49.660
And if it will pass, it brings a lot of risk in kids' development.

06:07:50.060 --> 06:08:03.605
For example, if proposed health framework, chapter 6, page 64, promotes a school-wide read of the book, Sex, All You Need to Know, Sexuality Guide to Get You Through Your Teens and Twins.

06:08:04.585 --> 06:08:13.969
This book talks about topics like bondage, restraints, body fluids, blood play, sex toys, oral sex, phone sex, and kinky sex.

06:08:14.589 --> 06:08:24.653
These topics are not appropriate for children and should not be explored in school, but parents should teach and explain at children's appropriate age.

06:08:25.494 --> 06:08:28.295
Current framework and current framework...

06:08:37.085 --> 06:08:41.646
Dear State Board of Education Committee, thank you for hearing all of us.

06:08:42.186 --> 06:08:53.969
My name is Mila and I'm a concerned parent of five kids and I strongly oppose this framework and I sincerely ask you please do not adopt this health framework education.

06:08:54.989 --> 06:09:01.031
The health education framework contains sexually explicit and do not age appropriate material.

06:09:01.651 --> 06:09:02.251
It promotes

06:09:03.826 --> 06:09:09.508
kids to sexual experience from a young age, therefore posing a big risk for their health and development.

06:09:10.368 --> 06:09:23.513
Many people before me showed concerning examples from suggested books in the framework, such as Changing You, It's Not a Sword, Who Are You, What's Happening to My Body, Book for the Boys and Book for the Girls.

06:09:24.253 --> 06:09:26.774
Please remove these books from the framework.

06:09:26.934 --> 06:09:31.016
These type of books bring confusion, harm to children and youth.

06:09:31.696 --> 06:09:34.985
This type of material do not promote healthy lifestyles.

06:09:35.265 --> 06:09:36.368
Reject the framework.

06:09:36.428 --> 06:09:36.809
Thank you.

06:09:42.475 --> 06:09:43.776
Hello, my name is Oleg.

06:09:43.836 --> 06:09:44.717
I have three kids.

06:09:45.799 --> 06:09:50.263
And as we know, we are people and we are God's creation.

06:09:51.184 --> 06:10:04.718
God created us and no one in any generation for thousands of years go to a school having a sexual education, but no one failed.

06:10:05.979 --> 06:10:09.242
How God created it, it works by itself.

06:10:09.602 --> 06:10:12.865
There is no need to have it in school.

06:10:13.586 --> 06:10:28.619
Unless there are some guides like to take care of body of organs or how to avoid sexual... If our girls

06:10:30.347 --> 06:10:43.957
start learning this and they decide to change their gender, they won't produce babies and so people in 40 to 70 years will die and there will be nobody on earth.

06:10:44.537 --> 06:10:44.777
Time.

06:10:46.478 --> 06:10:54.004
We'd like to ask speakers 166 to 180 to please enter the boardroom and for speakers 181 to 195 to please line up.

06:10:59.059 --> 06:11:04.001
Hello, my name is Kevin, and I'm a concerned dad of three young children in public education.

06:11:04.281 --> 06:11:06.822
I'm here today to state my opposition to this framework.

06:11:07.502 --> 06:11:11.283
Curriculum aimed at sexualizing and confusing our children is unacceptable.

06:11:11.963 --> 06:11:25.928
My wife and I have a hard enough time trying to figure out and explain math, English, and science to my fourth grader, and I can't imagine trying to explain to her when she asks what gender reassignment surgery is or when my third grader asks why a boy would put his penis in her vagina.

06:11:26.608 --> 06:11:34.130
If the media were in here, they would be required by the FCC to bleep out and edit the very content in this curriculum or face huge fines.

06:11:34.870 --> 06:11:42.752
Millions of families in California reject this framework and this attempt at stretching our children's minds in such a detrimental and perverse way.

06:11:43.133 --> 06:11:44.613
Please reject this curriculum.

06:11:55.063 --> 06:11:56.904
Hi, my name is Irina Olashuk.

06:11:57.204 --> 06:11:58.205
I am a mom of two.

06:11:59.006 --> 06:12:00.527
I oppose the sex-ed framework.

06:12:00.667 --> 06:12:05.630
Not only is this framework age-inappropriate, but it also goes against my religious beliefs.

06:12:06.270 --> 06:12:16.917
The First Amendment guarantees freedom of religion, yet it is being taken away from us with this morally corrupt, sexualized content that will traumatize and confuse our children.

06:12:18.478 --> 06:12:21.301
that are too young to comprehend sex and gender identity.

06:12:21.761 --> 06:12:22.962
This is indoctrination.

06:12:23.323 --> 06:12:32.031
For example, the book Changing You for Third Graders shows pornographic images and intimate detailed descriptions about what it means to have a romantic relationship.

06:12:32.491 --> 06:12:39.777
I don't want my 8-year-old daughter learning about sex when the statistics show that only 3.1% of children reported being sexually active before the age of 13.

06:12:40.558 --> 06:12:42.679
This book will traumatize my child's innocent mind.

06:12:43.160 --> 06:12:46.302
I am the parent, and I want to decide with my husband.

06:12:46.322 --> 06:12:49.164
I want to teach these topics in a nurturing, loving environment.

06:12:49.504 --> 06:12:52.366
As Christians, we teach to love all and be kind to all.

06:12:52.566 --> 06:12:52.886
Thank you.

06:13:03.444 --> 06:13:06.305
Hi, my name is Alina, and I'm a concerned mother of two.

06:13:06.845 --> 06:13:09.805
I reject California health framework, first of all.

06:13:10.005 --> 06:13:12.886
Thank you for removing many of the books from the proposal.

06:13:13.366 --> 06:13:14.286
We are grateful for it.

06:13:14.886 --> 06:13:24.868
We send our precious children to schools to learn math, history, language arts, just like we've done, and not our babies to be sexualized at such an early age.

06:13:25.508 --> 06:13:29.589
The books being proposed are not age appropriate and more like pornographic comic books.

06:13:30.149 --> 06:13:34.450
I came to this country in 1992 from the USSR to the country of freedom and hope.

06:13:35.311 --> 06:13:41.652
I believe I deserve the right to talk to my children and decide when and where to teach my children about sexuality.

06:13:43.073 --> 06:13:44.313
Parents are being robbed of that.

06:13:44.453 --> 06:13:47.654
Please look into it more thoroughly and remove books like It's Not The Stork.

06:13:48.254 --> 06:13:51.955
It's not only going against our religion, but against our rights as parents.

06:13:52.355 --> 06:13:57.537
And to be clear, we are not misinformed, and our number one priority is to protect our kids at any cost.

06:13:57.757 --> 06:13:58.037
Thank you.

06:14:03.772 --> 06:14:05.433
Hello, my name is Timofey Ignatiev.

06:14:05.973 --> 06:14:07.193
I'm a father of three children.

06:14:08.434 --> 06:14:17.998
Please understand that I'm here today not because I'm against LGBT or healthy sex education, but I'm against teaching children what is inappropriate for children.

06:14:19.059 --> 06:14:26.782
Some parts of this framework might be good, but others, they go much further than just creating a safe environment for children with different views.

06:14:27.422 --> 06:14:38.690
I believe it creates age-inappropriate environment for children, displaying different sex toys, teaching girls at early age how to use carrots and bananas and stick them into their vaginas.

06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:51.298
By introducing this sex subject too early to our children, we are almost promoting this whole sex subject and approving early sex and abortions and masturbations and mutual masturbations

06:14:51.818 --> 06:14:53.220
and all kinds of wrong things.

06:14:53.921 --> 06:15:01.429
Instead of telling our children to stay away from sex until later age, we try to make it safe for them by offering abortions.

06:15:01.769 --> 06:15:04.412
But we don't tell them that abortions is killing babies.

06:15:05.293 --> 06:15:09.278
I feel like this framework is a mental sexual abuse to our children.

06:15:15.543 --> 06:15:16.264
Hello board members.

06:15:16.324 --> 06:15:21.849
My name is Maria Sanchez and I'm a mother of two and a student at Fresno State University.

06:15:22.550 --> 06:15:25.453
And I'm just here to share my experience.

06:15:25.493 --> 06:15:30.678
Growing up in a traditional conservative family, sex was not something that we talked about.

06:15:32.279 --> 06:15:38.746
My only source of sexual education was from school, which could be limited and not always accurate.

06:15:39.966 --> 06:15:43.587
This left me with numerous questions and nowhere to get the answers.

06:15:44.408 --> 06:15:49.109
My first real sexual education was my first semester in college.

06:15:49.869 --> 06:16:04.454
Knowing that there could be other individuals in the same situation that I was, in a similar situation, it just proves that having

06:16:06.851 --> 06:16:11.395
Offering inclusive medically accurate sex education to students is very critical.

06:16:11.755 --> 06:16:12.455
Thank you for your time.

06:16:14.777 --> 06:16:19.841
We'd like to ask speakers 181 to 195 to please enter the boardroom and for speakers 196 to 211 to please line up.

06:16:27.924 --> 06:16:31.845
Hi, I'm a student and I hear the conversations people have on campus.

06:16:32.605 --> 06:16:37.807
I understand what people talk about and sex is talked about daily in every conversation I've had with people.

06:16:38.667 --> 06:16:45.249
What I don't understand is why we need to talk about sex and tell them the different ways to have sex when they're this young.

06:16:46.349 --> 06:16:51.673
It's not okay to go into detail and then tell them not to do it when they're enforced to not do it at home.

06:16:51.693 --> 06:16:56.516
I don't think this is okay and please do not accept this.

06:16:56.856 --> 06:16:58.157
That, I don't understand.

06:17:05.037 --> 06:17:15.942
I strongly implore you to consider the long-term effects of between minors, sorry, excuse me, long-term effects on society when adult sexual behavior between minors is referenced in such detail.

06:17:16.563 --> 06:17:26.227
Sexual behavior has adult consequences and kids are not mentally, physically, and emotionally prepared to reconcile those encouraged behaviors with the unintended consequences.

06:17:26.948 --> 06:17:29.369
Are we teaching children to inform or to perform?

06:17:30.549 --> 06:17:59.041
Ariel and Will Durant, who wrote 11 large volumes of history covering thousands of years, declared, a youth boiling in hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires, and if he is unchecked by customs, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he matures sufficiently to understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in both, excuse me, in chaos both the individual and the group.

06:18:04.960 --> 06:18:05.680
Hello, everyone.

06:18:06.040 --> 06:18:07.341
My name is Julia Pislar.

06:18:07.861 --> 06:18:12.202
My parents are Russian immigrants, and many of my relatives are not fluent in English.

06:18:12.862 --> 06:18:25.065
Why did the California Department of Education discriminate against my people by only providing the framework in English during the community input process?

06:18:25.666 --> 06:18:26.786
This is very wrong.

06:18:27.326 --> 06:18:30.167
This method is not what our country stands for.

06:18:30.547 --> 06:18:33.688
I hope the Office of Civil Rights will bring us justice.

06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:34.248
Thank you.

06:18:42.901 --> 06:18:44.782
Hello, my name is Lilia.

06:18:45.102 --> 06:18:46.182
I'm a concerned parent.

06:18:47.002 --> 06:18:49.703
I strongly oppose the new sex ed framework.

06:18:50.984 --> 06:18:56.305
Schools have to teach our children the basics such as reading, writing, math, science, and history.

06:18:56.866 --> 06:18:59.166
The rest is parents' responsibility.

06:18:59.907 --> 06:19:06.669
Parents are the ones who decide when to educate and how to educate their children when it comes to sexual education.

06:19:07.709 --> 06:19:09.850
We will not let this new framework

06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:13.569
put sinful ideas in our precious children's mind.

06:19:14.590 --> 06:19:19.032
They are our children, and we are responsible for them, not the schools.

06:19:19.993 --> 06:19:23.635
Please do not poison the virgin minds of our children.

06:19:24.255 --> 06:19:26.696
Please do not take away our parental rights.

06:19:26.997 --> 06:19:27.357
Thank you.

06:19:39.485 --> 06:19:40.925
Hi, my name is Mary Doering.

06:19:41.666 --> 06:19:42.386
Sorry, you're tired.

06:19:43.526 --> 06:19:44.086
Good job, though.

06:19:44.226 --> 06:19:44.947
You stuck it out.

06:19:46.007 --> 06:20:01.091
Anyway, while I was being informed about the California health framework, I can't help but see the parallels this framework has with the Zionist-Communist blatant takeover of America.

06:20:01.551 --> 06:20:04.613
with its 45 declared goals, which are almost accomplished.

06:20:05.933 --> 06:20:21.922
In number 17, get control of the schools, use them as transmission belts for socialism and current communist propaganda, soften the curriculum, get control of the teachers' associations, and put the party line in textbooks.

06:20:22.742 --> 06:20:33.231
And then I have number 26, present homosexuality, degeneracy, and promiscuity as normal healthy behavior.

06:20:33.912 --> 06:20:37.895
Then number 40, discredit the family as an institution.

06:20:38.015 --> 06:20:42.079
Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.

06:20:51.287 --> 06:20:52.048
Good afternoon.

06:20:52.148 --> 06:20:53.369
My name is Jessica Pearl.

06:20:53.809 --> 06:20:56.392
I'm here on behalf of the Los Angeles LGBT Center.

06:20:56.973 --> 06:21:05.903
We are the largest providers of direct services to the LGBT community in the entire world, and a huge portion of that is through our incredible sexual health education program.

06:21:07.184 --> 06:21:11.066
Our staff sees clients every single day who would have benefited from this framework.

06:21:11.586 --> 06:21:16.069
We have clients in our 40s and 50s who have no idea how HIV is transmitted.

06:21:17.010 --> 06:21:21.572
Clients who have non-consensual sex because they don't have the language to assert their bodily autonomy.

06:21:22.173 --> 06:21:28.357
And for many clients, far too many, they still feel shame about their orientations and their identities.

06:21:28.777 --> 06:21:35.041
So on behalf of them, I thank you for your work to ensure that our next generation receives inclusive sex education.

06:21:35.601 --> 06:21:46.040
And as someone who personally spent a large part of my adolescence and early adulthood feeling shame and that I was a deviant and a pervert for my own sexuality, I want to thank you personally and urge you to stay strong.

06:21:58.600 --> 06:22:03.064
Good day fellow members I'm here for my kids.

06:22:03.284 --> 06:22:24.701
I have two beautiful daughters aged eight and five And I'm very concerned about my kids education these days Handbook like it's not the historic is mind corrupting including graphic naked body parts of girls and boys and describes what the sex is and how the babies were born and

06:22:32.484 --> 06:22:34.685
My kids are too young for this.

06:22:36.226 --> 06:22:40.227
Information like this is going to hurt my kids since they're too young.

06:22:41.447 --> 06:22:47.750
Why does the state of California think that it is age appropriate?

06:22:48.770 --> 06:22:51.451
Parents must have the right to protect their kids.

06:22:52.291 --> 06:22:54.672
So help us God to do the right decision.

06:22:55.072 --> 06:22:55.812
Repeal AB 329.

06:22:55.872 --> 06:22:56.112
Thank you.

06:23:00.919 --> 06:23:01.279
Hello.

06:23:01.579 --> 06:23:02.740
My name is Ivan Glushko.

06:23:02.760 --> 06:23:04.581
I'm a father of four, child care provider.

06:23:05.601 --> 06:23:09.783
And I would like to ask you to please do not adopt this framework.

06:23:10.084 --> 06:23:18.628
One fact I would like to state that we don't give the children guns or driver license because we know there's the consequences.

06:23:19.827 --> 06:23:26.353
We parents know the right time to educate them because all children are different and learn at different rates.

06:23:26.774 --> 06:23:29.596
Who else would know the right time if not parents?

06:23:29.836 --> 06:23:34.240
Therefore, I tell you, parents should teach their children.

06:23:34.961 --> 06:23:35.541
Not schools.

06:23:36.422 --> 06:23:44.567
Another statement I would like to bring forward is that this framework does not require parental consent.

06:23:45.068 --> 06:23:45.308
Why?

06:23:46.028 --> 06:23:48.310
Why is this not up to the parents to decide?

06:23:48.790 --> 06:23:55.134
Therefore, I assure you, we will protect our kids to the end and won't back till the end.

06:23:55.595 --> 06:23:58.817
And please, take time and read this curriculum yourself.

06:23:59.817 --> 06:24:03.660
If you have kids, I ask you, I'm begging you, spend a couple hours.

06:24:08.834 --> 06:24:11.716
Hello, my name is Margaret Glushko, and I'm a student at Bella Vista High School.

06:24:12.117 --> 06:24:19.263
Today I see how public school sex ed classes ignore individuals' differences among children and break down the natural modesty of boys and girls.

06:24:20.624 --> 06:24:26.569
When children are taught academics such as math and science, they're given material suitable to their level.

06:24:27.070 --> 06:24:34.336
Yet when it comes to sensitive topics like gender, all children in the same grade level are given the same material, regardless if they believe it or not.

06:24:36.108 --> 06:24:40.332
Sexuality involves more than plumbing the birth control pills.

06:24:41.173 --> 06:24:45.377
The school sends the wrong message of how to do it and how not to get caught lessons.

06:24:45.917 --> 06:24:51.262
When public school sex ed says kids need to know more, what do they really mean?

06:24:51.522 --> 06:24:52.984
How to remove innocence and purity?

06:24:53.704 --> 06:24:56.026
So I urge you, please reject this framework.

06:24:56.327 --> 06:24:56.567
Thank you.

06:25:01.129 --> 06:25:02.170
Hello, I'm Dan Tarasov.

06:25:02.971 --> 06:25:04.092
I came from a family of eight.

06:25:04.112 --> 06:25:05.653
I have two beautiful children.

06:25:06.334 --> 06:25:08.936
And I'm very worried about their school and education.

06:25:09.477 --> 06:25:14.601
This is really embarrassing what they put in their books and what they're trying to teach our kids and my kids.

06:25:15.402 --> 06:25:19.626
And I would like to tell you, please stop the sexual framework.

06:25:20.106 --> 06:25:25.652
And our children need to hear from their fathers and mothers the correct things and the right things.

06:25:26.457 --> 06:25:27.799
and about the gender and sexuality.

06:25:27.839 --> 06:25:32.324
This is a big curse coming for schools and books, and this is very embarrassing.

06:25:32.364 --> 06:25:33.485
Please stop this.

06:25:40.473 --> 06:25:41.274
My name is Artem.

06:25:41.454 --> 06:25:42.896
I'm a 7th grade student.

06:25:42.936 --> 06:25:43.897
I was born in Moldova.

06:25:44.278 --> 06:25:45.359
My parents came here

06:25:46.570 --> 06:25:50.453
My family came here for freedom so we could practice our religion without persecution.

06:25:50.794 --> 06:25:56.499
Teaching kids that unlimited genders and unlimited sexual orientation is in fact not inclusive.

06:25:56.999 --> 06:26:00.322
It excludes kids like me who do not believe this.

06:26:00.402 --> 06:26:10.631
My parents taught me to love and respect everyone, but that does not mean we must be forced to believe and affirm things that go against our culture and religious beliefs.

06:26:11.391 --> 06:26:12.212
Thank you for listening.

06:26:14.861 --> 06:26:20.136
Would speakers 196 through 211 please enter the boardroom?

06:26:20.918 --> 06:26:22.763
Hello, my name is Anatoly Teslenko.

06:26:23.323 --> 06:26:25.544
I was born in the Soviet Union.

06:26:25.904 --> 06:26:27.845
I came to the state for more freedom.

06:26:29.206 --> 06:26:31.767
This framework assured my cultural value.

06:26:32.067 --> 06:26:34.248
I have eight kids in public education.

06:26:35.049 --> 06:26:46.614
Why did the California Department of Education discriminate against over one million Slavic in California by only providing the framework in English during the community input process?

06:26:47.095 --> 06:26:48.638
This is not true democracy.

06:26:48.658 --> 06:26:50.743
This is communism.

06:26:51.304 --> 06:26:52.447
I thought I escaped this.

06:26:53.288 --> 06:26:54.130
Please reject it.

06:26:54.411 --> 06:26:54.732
Thank you.

06:26:58.649 --> 06:27:10.013
Hello, my name is Daniel and my name is Krishko and I came here to say that you have to reject this framework because it violates parents' rights.

06:27:10.754 --> 06:27:12.894
It violates the rights of children.

06:27:12.914 --> 06:27:20.577
It emotionally forces children to think negatively and causes cognitive negative abilities on children.

06:27:21.698 --> 06:27:27.360
We as children should care for our parents and let our parents make our decisions and

06:27:28.400 --> 06:27:30.841
Have faith in our parents.

06:27:31.161 --> 06:27:44.645
We should follow our parents and our parents should make the decisions, not some sexual education or anything related to pornography or pornographic information because it discourages our minds.

06:27:45.746 --> 06:27:48.306
Read the Bible and understand what God says to you.

06:27:48.847 --> 06:27:49.747
Make the right decisions.

06:27:49.947 --> 06:27:50.207
Thank you.

06:27:56.317 --> 06:27:59.763
My name is Joseph Dunca, and I'm a God-fearing Christian.

06:28:00.584 --> 06:28:10.961
And I'm actually a 75-year-old white, a black, Asian woman who's 4 feet 7, who here would believe me with the hand raised.

06:28:12.708 --> 06:28:13.989
No one here would believe me.

06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:16.012
You would say, you're out of your mind.

06:28:16.772 --> 06:28:21.257
Why are we normalizing people who have mental issues?

06:28:22.118 --> 06:28:26.783
Someone who's born a woman, a female is a woman.

06:28:28.004 --> 06:28:30.266
X is woman, XY is man.

06:28:31.247 --> 06:28:32.808
We have lost our mind as a nation.

06:28:33.108 --> 06:28:34.969
California, you have lost your mind.

06:28:35.589 --> 06:28:41.473
And the Bible actually says that the problem with our nation is that there's no fear of God before your eyes.

06:28:41.553 --> 06:28:43.494
There's no fear of Jehovah God.

06:28:44.214 --> 06:28:46.735
The God who made us is not some grandfather in the sky.

06:28:47.016 --> 06:28:48.396
He is a consuming fire.

06:28:48.696 --> 06:28:51.378
He is a holy God who will judge the world in righteousness.

06:28:51.658 --> 06:28:57.141
And I plead with you to repent of your sins and your evil ways and turn to Jesus Christ while there is time.

06:28:57.401 --> 06:28:58.842
He died on the cross for your sins.

06:28:59.122 --> 06:28:59.502
Time.

06:28:59.723 --> 06:29:00.323
Time.

06:29:00.363 --> 06:29:00.643
Time.

06:29:01.524 --> 06:29:01.784
Time.

06:29:01.804 --> 06:29:08.129
Hello, my name is Elena Epifanov.

06:29:08.269 --> 06:29:12.513
I'm a mother of three children and I'm against this law.

06:29:13.533 --> 06:29:19.018
Please do not accept them for the sake of the future and community of our children.

06:29:20.078 --> 06:29:20.599
Please don't

06:29:23.194 --> 06:29:24.255
This is not a freedom.

06:29:24.335 --> 06:29:27.377
This is a discrimination against the traditional families.

06:29:27.838 --> 06:29:31.961
This is not traditional children, and this is discrimination.

06:29:32.821 --> 06:29:40.848
And please, take our talks for normal education, math, English, and other good things.

06:29:40.908 --> 06:29:41.208
Thank you.

06:29:47.190 --> 06:29:48.512
Hi, my name is Tatiana.

06:29:48.532 --> 06:29:50.095
I'm a mother of two children.

06:29:50.115 --> 06:29:51.817
I come here.

06:29:51.978 --> 06:29:56.044
I oppose health framework.

06:29:56.104 --> 06:29:56.886
Do not adopt.

06:29:57.246 --> 06:29:57.667
Thank you.

06:30:03.106 --> 06:30:04.867
Hello, dear panel.

06:30:05.507 --> 06:30:07.508
I am Igor, father of two boys.

06:30:08.349 --> 06:30:12.071
And you heard a lot of things.

06:30:12.231 --> 06:30:23.217
And one thing that was good for this framework, they were saying that LGBT community weren't informed about the sex and the precautions they have to take.

06:30:23.897 --> 06:30:43.737
This framework, if it is passed, it will not prevent spreading of sexual diseases, but it will sexualize our kids in early age, which will increase in child stress, and it will lower student performance and success rate.

06:30:45.479 --> 06:30:48.060
And suicide rate will go up.

06:30:48.560 --> 06:30:54.882
We can see it and observe it in our university communities, within the LGBT communities.

06:30:55.002 --> 06:30:56.022
You know it.

06:30:56.082 --> 06:30:57.083
You know those digits.

06:30:57.543 --> 06:31:01.004
And yes, not exception.

06:31:01.524 --> 06:31:04.125
It's not the full blame for the suicidal rate.

06:31:04.505 --> 06:31:04.825
Time.

06:31:04.925 --> 06:31:05.666
Gender confusion.

06:31:05.686 --> 06:31:05.926
Time.

06:31:05.946 --> 06:31:06.126
Thank you.

06:31:11.516 --> 06:31:13.016
Hello, my name is Olisa.

06:31:13.096 --> 06:31:16.898
I'm the mom of three children and I highly, highly oppose this bill.

06:31:17.058 --> 06:31:17.678
Thank you so much.

06:31:25.280 --> 06:31:26.800
I'm going to close.

06:31:27.061 --> 06:31:28.341
Oh, there's one more.

06:31:28.361 --> 06:31:30.361
I was just told we were done.

06:31:30.441 --> 06:31:30.702
Okay.

06:31:31.882 --> 06:31:33.142
Did not mean to cut you off.

06:31:33.222 --> 06:31:33.502
Sorry.

06:31:33.542 --> 06:31:34.683
No, they didn't get to my number.

06:31:34.723 --> 06:31:34.963
Sorry.

06:31:45.014 --> 06:31:46.456
want to be successful here.

06:31:48.518 --> 06:31:49.059
Good afternoon.

06:31:49.119 --> 06:31:49.739
Thank you very much.

06:31:50.220 --> 06:31:52.463
I come to you today as a concerned grandparent.

06:31:53.364 --> 06:31:56.487
I don't think saying that Sally Ride was a lesbian offends me.

06:31:56.808 --> 06:32:04.356
What I do think offends me is on page 246 where you tell students, I want to read it.

06:32:05.649 --> 06:32:12.151
It says, generally, sex toys aren't available for purchase by minors and are sold in sex toy shops, through catalogs, or on the internet.

06:32:12.231 --> 06:32:18.173
Some people also make their own sex toys out of household objects for sex toys.

06:32:18.633 --> 06:32:23.715
Use electric toothbrushes, plastic bottles, socks, pillows, and all sorts of other objects.

06:32:24.155 --> 06:32:24.795
That offends me.

06:32:24.835 --> 06:32:28.876
I have a six-year-old grandson and a four-year-old granddaughter.

06:32:29.296 --> 06:32:30.997
They don't need to know that in the second grade.

06:32:31.537 --> 06:32:39.701
On the other side of the page, it tells them some people enjoy any number of body fluids, sexually ejaculate, vaginal fluid, menses, urine, and blood.

06:32:39.981 --> 06:32:44.843
They may simply enjoy tasting, feeling, and smelling these during sexual activities.

06:32:45.663 --> 06:32:48.244
And my eyes are going.

06:32:48.284 --> 06:32:53.466
They may engage in activities specific to enjoying these fluids, such as going to the shower.

06:32:54.407 --> 06:32:54.767
Time.

06:32:54.787 --> 06:32:54.967
Time.

06:32:55.087 --> 06:32:55.467
Time.

06:32:55.547 --> 06:32:56.307
Time.

06:32:56.548 --> 06:32:56.868
Time.

06:33:02.426 --> 06:33:02.666
All right.

06:33:02.686 --> 06:33:04.749
I think we are done with public comment.

06:33:04.789 --> 06:33:09.815
I'm going to close public comment and we'll take about a 10 or so minute break.

06:33:10.996 --> 06:33:13.359
And I close the hearing.

06:33:13.379 --> 06:33:18.725
All right.

06:33:19.165 --> 06:33:21.568
And we'll come back at quarter of.

06:33:21.909 --> 06:33:22.249
Thank you.

06:33:43.948 --> 06:33:46.290
Okay, we're going to reconvene.

06:33:51.453 --> 06:34:06.384
I'm going to ask our liaison to the committee, Feliza Ortiz-Lacon, to kick us off, and then I'm gonna also, in a moment, ask Stephanie Grayson to answer a few questions, and then we'll begin the discussion.

06:34:07.335 --> 06:34:07.935
Sure.

06:34:08.135 --> 06:34:08.576
Thank you.

06:34:08.836 --> 06:34:16.059
I want to thank all the parents and community members who came from near and far to express their support and even opposition.

06:34:16.119 --> 06:34:21.062
I think it's important for us to have diversity of thought when having these discussions.

06:34:21.702 --> 06:34:25.164
There was a couple of things that were raised, and I want to briefly address them.

06:34:25.204 --> 06:34:28.966
I know that we'll be asking Stephanie to give us further clarification.

06:34:29.666 --> 06:34:35.028
The translation of the framework was one thing that came up, and I know that it's something that came up during the IQC.

06:34:36.389 --> 06:34:43.496
The CDE is not, unfortunately, required at this time to translate these frameworks, which can be upwards of 700 pages.

06:34:44.457 --> 06:34:51.864
This is something that would require legislative action, so I just want to clarify that that is why the frameworks are not translated.

06:34:52.064 --> 06:35:01.432
The frameworks are geared towards educators in the classroom, and they speak English, and so the frameworks are in the language that the educators would be able to implement.

06:35:02.253 --> 06:35:13.016
Now, if somebody submitted a comment in Spanish or another language, then that question was answered in the language that it was submitted.

06:35:13.236 --> 06:35:14.836
So we were responsive in that way.

06:35:15.917 --> 06:35:23.239
I also heard a little bit, a lot of confusion or confounding the framework and the materials and the resources.

06:35:23.879 --> 06:35:29.340
As mentioned, if maybe some folks missed it, we did have a long public comment period.

06:35:29.821 --> 06:35:31.041
The motion that stands

06:35:31.781 --> 06:35:34.264
is asking to remove certain books.

06:35:34.504 --> 06:35:37.127
And many of those books were referenced during the public comment.

06:35:37.647 --> 06:35:42.912
You heard pieces or abstracts of books that's not from the framework.

06:35:42.992 --> 06:35:46.075
What was being cited was actually from the resources.

06:35:46.536 --> 06:35:55.184
So as somebody who read the 700 pages, I could tell you that there was a lot of back from the framework to the resources that was happening.

06:35:56.025 --> 06:35:57.226
And so we will have that.

06:35:57.346 --> 06:36:06.534
We want to clarify that some of the citations actually came from the resources that are on the motion to be removed from the framework.

06:36:06.794 --> 06:36:09.617
They were not direct citations necessarily from the framework.

06:36:10.949 --> 06:36:15.552
And also there was a lot of asking to repeal the law.

06:36:15.952 --> 06:36:17.113
We are a board.

06:36:17.273 --> 06:36:18.774
We're not the legislature.

06:36:18.914 --> 06:36:21.115
And so that is not something that we can do.

06:36:21.135 --> 06:36:25.358
Not that some of us would be inclined to, but that is not something that we can do.

06:36:25.378 --> 06:36:30.021
I think that there is also a lot of questions and fair questions about where

06:36:30.821 --> 06:36:37.365
is the authority for this because I go to my local board and they send me to you and now I'm here and you're saying that this is a local board.

06:36:37.685 --> 06:36:39.086
I do think that we need to clarify.

06:36:39.126 --> 06:36:45.090
It's fair for us to clarify that to parents because they do deserve to know where to go and have their voice heard.

06:36:45.470 --> 06:36:45.770
Thank you.

06:36:47.111 --> 06:36:53.194
I'll just add a couple of additional thoughts before we ask Stephanie to add some clarification.

06:36:55.954 --> 06:37:06.203
Some of the comments we heard suggested that they had experienced something already in their districts that was presumably from this framework.

06:37:06.643 --> 06:37:10.086
That would not be the case because the framework is not yet out in use.

06:37:10.606 --> 06:37:19.554
So what they might have experienced was sex education that might have been associated with the implementation of the California Healthy Youth Act.

06:37:20.314 --> 06:37:33.332
That was not this framework, and I think this framework might actually help with some of the concerns and problems they may have experienced from local districts where they were told, no, we have to do this by law.

06:37:34.173 --> 06:37:36.937
The framework itself is not mandatory.

06:37:38.038 --> 06:37:40.180
The standards are also optional.

06:37:40.901 --> 06:37:42.562
The framework is not a curriculum.

06:37:42.682 --> 06:37:50.789
It's guidance, as Felisa said, for districts and teachers as they develop a curriculum that suits their local community.

06:37:51.490 --> 06:37:53.652
There is nothing in there that has to be taught.

06:37:54.773 --> 06:37:56.314
And 90% of the framework is

06:38:00.738 --> 06:38:08.341
nutrition, physical activity, injury prevention, drug abuse prevention, emotional health, and so on.

06:38:09.041 --> 06:38:16.904
I went back into the document and reread sections as I was hearing things noted on certain page numbers that just weren't there.

06:38:18.885 --> 06:38:21.106
So I wanted to be sure I hadn't missed anything.

06:38:21.186 --> 06:38:22.166
It's a big document.

06:38:22.226 --> 06:38:23.227
I was reading quickly.

06:38:24.267 --> 06:38:33.870
But in fact, many of those things were from the resources, some of which we've already identified to be deleted from the motion.

06:38:34.230 --> 06:38:41.672
In all of the K-3 parts of the framework, there may be one sentence that deals with gender identity.

06:38:43.773 --> 06:38:50.795
99.9% of that content is all about wear your bike helmet, eat the right foods,

06:38:51.535 --> 06:39:00.499
and don't run across the street without looking both ways, and all of the other health and safety things that we'd like to have kids learning and doing.

06:39:01.259 --> 06:39:15.625
I would like to give Stephanie an opportunity just to respond to some of the questions that came up about, so that we have a base of understanding about what's accurate in our consideration of the framework.

06:39:16.223 --> 06:39:16.563
Thank you.

06:39:16.583 --> 06:39:17.383
I appreciate that.

06:39:17.564 --> 06:39:26.007
I'll start with the California Healthy Youth Act because that seemed to be quite a bit of topic for public comment, especially around the instructional materials.

06:39:26.167 --> 06:39:36.331
So this is a law that's about what the school districts need to implement, that the school districts need to provide comprehensive sexual health education in middle school.

06:39:37.071 --> 06:39:37.931
and once in high school.

06:39:38.831 --> 06:39:48.293
So if they choose to do so at a younger grade, then they need to make sure it's age appropriate, and they need to follow all of the guidelines outlined in the California Healthy Youth Act.

06:39:48.633 --> 06:40:01.076
That means that they need to make available all of the instructional materials that they would be using, and provide 14-day parental notice for the parents to review those materials, and parents can opt out of that instruction.

06:40:02.696 --> 06:40:05.057
So if you're in middle school and high school, the same thing.

06:40:05.377 --> 06:40:10.219
They need to provide 14 days worth of notice for the instructional materials that this is going to be taught.

06:40:10.899 --> 06:40:17.402
Parents can opt out by writing a letter saying, I do not want my child participating in the comprehensive sexual health education course.

06:40:17.702 --> 06:40:20.383
Then their students would not have to attend those classes.

06:40:20.843 --> 06:40:23.164
This is once in high school, once in middle school.

06:40:24.104 --> 06:40:27.966
Along with the comprehensive sexual education is also HIV prevention.

06:40:28.726 --> 06:40:33.470
Now, the districts choose the curriculum that they will be using.

06:40:33.890 --> 06:40:36.612
The state does not choose that curriculum for them.

06:40:37.453 --> 06:40:48.182
The districts choose because the districts understand what their students' needs are, what their demographic needs are, and they are the ones that are in the place to make that decision for themselves, the best decision for themselves.

06:40:48.562 --> 06:40:57.849
So the districts are encouraged to go through a review process and adoption process on their own to choose that type of curriculum and include the parents within that process.

06:40:58.770 --> 06:41:03.351
So that is about the California Healthy Youth Act and the comprehensive sexual health education.

06:41:03.891 --> 06:41:12.713
Some of the pieces that were referenced, as President Darling-Hammond noted, some of the page numbers were actually from the resources, not from the actual framework.

06:41:13.473 --> 06:41:20.255
Especially one of our, the grandfather had the last comment that was reading, that is actually from a resource that we are recommending being taken out.

06:41:20.695 --> 06:41:25.180
That is not in the framework, nor is it in second grade, as he noted.

06:41:25.681 --> 06:41:33.110
So there is some misinformation around there, some misunderstandings around what is actually within the framework and what are in resources.

06:41:33.550 --> 06:41:36.614
And our resources within the curriculum framework are just that.

06:41:36.974 --> 06:41:37.655
They're resources.

06:41:38.416 --> 06:41:39.678
They're not instructional materials.

06:41:40.258 --> 06:41:41.720
They're not a curriculum to adopt.

06:41:42.141 --> 06:41:47.487
They are a tool, a resource, because our teachers need those tools and resources.

06:41:47.667 --> 06:41:50.531
They are the ones that are going to be asked these types of questions.

06:41:50.891 --> 06:41:57.860
They are the ones that are going to be presenting all of the different topics around in our health education framework, around injury prevention.

06:41:58.320 --> 06:42:05.428
around identifying safe decisions that our students need to make about themselves and others.

06:42:05.908 --> 06:42:08.171
They are the ones that need the tools and resources.

06:42:08.251 --> 06:42:11.554
So that is what this framework provides, are tools and resources.

06:42:11.895 --> 06:42:14.617
It's not curriculum and it's not instructional materials.

06:42:15.098 --> 06:42:17.741
That is the decision of a local school district.

06:42:18.281 --> 06:42:33.826
So, something that we're doing to support our local school districts, as I mentioned earlier, is providing professional learning modules and resources, including a communication toolkit for our administrators around the Draft Healthy Health Education Framework.

06:42:34.726 --> 06:42:37.707
And that includes around California Healthy Youth Act.

06:42:38.627 --> 06:42:42.988
And so that is the Proposition 98 money that has been dedicated for that.

06:42:43.028 --> 06:42:45.849
And that's Orange County Department of Education that's leading that effort.

06:42:46.129 --> 06:42:47.590
And they've been meeting several times.

06:42:47.650 --> 06:42:53.972
They have separate pieces for administrators and separate pieces for teachers that are completely aligned and cohesive.

06:42:54.412 --> 06:43:02.980
And so this is a community of health educators coming together across the state, providing this information to all of our local school districts.

06:43:03.000 --> 06:43:15.352
So this will be coming because we understand that this is difficult for our local school districts and we want to make sure that they have the right information and the tools to be able to provide accurate information to their parents and their teachers.

06:43:17.216 --> 06:43:21.698
The other piece that was mentioned that I want to clarify is the gender identity.

06:43:21.718 --> 06:43:30.663
And in kindergarten, our foundation starts in our early years, 0 to 5, and then in TK in kindergarten.

06:43:30.983 --> 06:43:34.085
And so I'd like to read one of the sentences in the framework.

06:43:34.585 --> 06:43:37.286
around gender identity in kindergarten.

06:43:37.686 --> 06:43:46.731
It says, dispelling myths about gender expectations in kindergarten can lay the groundwork for acceptance, inclusiveness, and an anti-bullying environment in schools.

06:43:47.211 --> 06:43:51.973
Gender nonconformity and physical characteristics are often at the root of many forms of bullying.

06:43:52.353 --> 06:44:00.677
As students learn to accept differences and unique characteristics of others, they also learn about the characteristics of bullying and how to avoid being a bully.

06:44:01.557 --> 06:44:10.425
This is very important because it matches the standard for kindergarten that says name ways in which people are similar and ways in which they are different.

06:44:11.286 --> 06:44:17.972
So it's laying that groundwork for that safe inclusive environment in our classrooms and providing guidance to our teachers on how to do that.

06:44:19.053 --> 06:44:21.896
The other piece that I'd like to clarify is for fifth grade.

06:44:23.015 --> 06:44:31.338
We had the term masturbation coming up in the public comment, and so I want to clarify that for our public and for the board members.

06:44:31.719 --> 06:44:36.140
So in fifth grade is where our sexual health standards begin.

06:44:36.160 --> 06:44:38.982
It does not begin before fifth grade.

06:44:39.342 --> 06:44:42.783
So we do not have any sexual health standards in K1, 2, 3, or 4.

06:44:45.157 --> 06:44:51.620
So in fifth grade, we do have, let me make sure I'm on the right page, growth, development, and sexual health.

06:44:52.121 --> 06:44:58.884
And specifically, we have 1.3, identify the physical, social, and emotional changes that occur during puberty.

06:45:00.811 --> 06:45:13.501
So in our guidance to teachers, if they are discussing social changes, physical changes around puberty, and a question arises around masturbation, there is guidance for if that topic arises.

06:45:14.202 --> 06:45:18.285
This is not something, this is not a topic that we want teachers to necessarily introduce.

06:45:18.445 --> 06:45:19.646
It's not in the standards.

06:45:20.807 --> 06:45:30.195
But if it does arise, we want to make sure that our teachers are armed with the knowledge to be able to approach that topic in a way that is inclusive and understanding for all of our students.

06:45:32.428 --> 06:45:40.312
And I think that is about all of the kind of the themes that I got from the different public comment.

06:45:40.672 --> 06:45:49.196
I do want to say that all of the content of the framework is aligning with our state board guidelines that were adopted

06:45:49.756 --> 06:45:51.597
way back in 2016.

06:45:52.057 --> 06:46:03.962
And one of those guidelines talks about describing the components of an effective health education program including the support of district and site administrators and the involvement of parents and the community.

06:46:04.302 --> 06:46:11.526
That is why we have partner with the family, partner with the community, and partner with the school throughout each of our grade level chapters.

06:46:11.626 --> 06:46:16.868
So we are helping our teachers and administrators understand how they can best partner with people

06:46:17.288 --> 06:46:23.176
And so it's the STORC that was brought up a lot is a part of a resource that's in the partner with a family.

06:46:23.837 --> 06:46:26.900
So it's not a resource that we're saying use in the classroom.

06:46:27.181 --> 06:46:32.507
It is a resource we're saying that you can use with your family outside of school around this topic.

06:46:34.622 --> 06:46:38.526
be in the conscious of if parents come with a need or a question?

06:46:38.826 --> 06:46:39.707
Yes, exactly.

06:46:39.727 --> 06:46:42.670
Because teachers, they encounter all types of questions.

06:46:43.310 --> 06:46:44.672
I'm a former fifth grade teacher.

06:46:44.692 --> 06:46:46.774
I had to teach such education.

06:46:47.254 --> 06:46:51.338
I had a parent community that was very nervous about that.

06:46:51.639 --> 06:46:53.520
And so they had a lot of questions.

06:46:53.981 --> 06:46:54.521
And if I had

06:46:55.242 --> 06:46:58.423
these resources, I could have pointed them to that.

06:46:58.523 --> 06:47:03.724
Instead of me being their sex education teacher, I could have said, here's a resource to use with your kids.

06:47:04.304 --> 06:47:05.445
Read them out loud together.

06:47:05.465 --> 06:47:14.747
Okay, I think we want to open up discussion among the members of the board.

06:47:14.807 --> 06:47:22.849
I think, let me just leave it at that and allow people to start.

06:47:23.189 --> 06:47:23.449
Hema?

06:47:25.229 --> 06:47:29.533
First and foremost, I want to thank all the students who came out today.

06:47:29.993 --> 06:47:37.699
You know, it's a school day, so I really appreciate students who came out to really speak about their truth and what they believe in and expressing who they are.

06:47:38.319 --> 06:47:42.022
And so, you know, I want to remind those and also tell people who weren't here.

06:47:42.102 --> 06:47:48.787
In November of 2018, a group of students, the Student Advisory Board on Education, actually presented on

06:47:49.728 --> 06:47:57.095
you know, sexual education, how to make it more LGBTQ plus inclusive, how do we teach students about safe sex and consent.

06:47:57.495 --> 06:48:00.658
And so I'm really happy about this framework because a lot of students want this.

06:48:01.138 --> 06:48:07.844
And so when I'm like hearing everything, something I referred to a lot was the Student Advisory Board of Education.

06:48:07.884 --> 06:48:13.208
And so I just want to tell you all that even though there could have been more students, there are students who are in support of it.

06:48:13.269 --> 06:48:17.092
And, you know, there are students who have contacted me before this talking about,

06:48:18.072 --> 06:48:43.464
that they've always wanted the framework and sexual education to be more inclusive for LGBTQ youth, you know, and I'm really supportive of this and I'm really excited to see this because I feel like all students should have access and those resources accessible in a way and that teachers are able to pull these different resources because it can be helpful because unfortunately, not all teachers know this information and it's a learning experience for everybody.

06:48:45.385 --> 06:48:45.625
Eileen?

06:48:47.621 --> 06:48:49.563
So I had several areas of comment.

06:48:49.663 --> 06:48:57.231
First, I just so appreciate, Stephanie, you and the leadership that you've provided over the several years process to this.

06:48:57.731 --> 06:49:07.320
And I just want to remind people that it had a very long process with two public comment periods and 3,400 comments, of which

06:49:09.102 --> 06:49:24.564
If you haven't sat through the Instructional Quality Commission, every comment goes through line by line, and the Instructional Quality Commission decides which ones they're going to accept and incorporate, which I think was over 300, and which ones with the rationale on if they didn't think they needed it or not.

06:49:25.862 --> 06:49:40.368
Secondly, the standards came from 2008, and in the 10 or 11 years since then, we've had a lot of legal legislative processes that required things needed to be included in addition to what standards we already had.

06:49:40.969 --> 06:49:50.493
So I think the committee worked really hard to incorporate legal requirements from the Healthy Youth Act, but there were other ones, I am assuming.

06:49:50.973 --> 06:49:53.714
And I don't know if that's something you want to kind of summarize.

06:49:54.054 --> 06:49:55.035
I have a couple other comments,

06:49:55.595 --> 06:50:00.097
I think it's important to know that we had to put some things in by legislators.

06:50:00.117 --> 06:50:02.417
There was a whole hearing process that went through the legislator.

06:50:02.738 --> 06:50:04.938
They then get sent to us to incorporate.

06:50:04.998 --> 06:50:07.259
So could you do that first and then I'll go back to a couple of them.

06:50:07.299 --> 06:50:11.881
I'll just kind of list off the themes within the education code that we're required to include.

06:50:12.141 --> 06:50:21.844
Inclusion and equity, organ procurement and tissue donation, nutrition education, sexual harassment and violence, lifelong health, aging and financial literacy.

06:50:22.124 --> 06:50:23.805
Of course, the California Healthy Youth Act.

06:50:24.605 --> 06:50:36.779
Sexual harassment and violence was also to be considered, and then sexual abuse and sex trafficking prevention education, sexual abuse and sexual assault awareness and prevention education, and healthy relationships and mental health instruction.

06:50:38.038 --> 06:50:38.338
Thank you.

06:50:38.358 --> 06:50:43.480
So my understanding is this is an update and that 94 was the last health framework.

06:50:43.540 --> 06:50:44.060
Is that right?

06:50:44.500 --> 06:50:45.360
I believe so.

06:50:45.720 --> 06:50:50.342
So that's a long time and things have changed and there are new requirements.

06:50:50.602 --> 06:50:54.583
And just as we know, we took us almost 20 years to update our science framework.

06:50:54.603 --> 06:50:59.025
We know a lot more about science that we provide this as a resource to local districts.

06:50:59.045 --> 06:50:59.945
So my next question is,

06:51:01.066 --> 06:51:13.686
I understand, working out in local districts, that local county offices and also, I believe, CDE are providing guidance to educators now in the field, talking points, resources.

06:51:13.726 --> 06:51:15.349
So, I'm interested in you sharing

06:51:15.849 --> 06:51:18.331
what you're aware of or what the funding provides.

06:51:18.391 --> 06:51:24.315
So what resources can school districts expect to have as they do the work going forward?

06:51:24.335 --> 06:51:30.138
Again, I'm not, I just think it's important to clarify that people are out there, they're getting some talking points.

06:51:30.158 --> 06:51:33.380
So are you aware or are you in the process of providing that?

06:51:33.600 --> 06:51:38.724
So we are and we actually have Doreen here from the Orange County Department of Education that can speak to that.

06:51:39.284 --> 06:51:40.065
I think that'd be helpful.

06:51:42.748 --> 06:51:47.629
I'll let her tell you about all of the work that the Health Collaboration Committee is doing with that money.

06:51:48.329 --> 06:51:52.390
I would have worn a nicer jacket and not just a cardigan if I knew I was going to be coming up here.

06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:57.712
But we are really, really excited for the rollout implementation project of this framework.

06:51:58.092 --> 06:51:59.952
We already have a Health Collaboration Committee.

06:52:00.012 --> 06:52:07.154
It's a statewide committee that has representation from many agencies, statewide agencies, but also our county office of education.

06:52:08.414 --> 06:52:11.395
the 2018 National Health Education Teacher of the Year.

06:52:11.776 --> 06:52:19.119
So we have master health education teachers that are part of that, higher ed, of course all our CDE content experts.

06:52:19.899 --> 06:52:26.322
Let's see, we have representation from the State Board of Education and we also have PTAs on there.

06:52:26.362 --> 06:52:31.044
So it's a really, really diverse, great group of folks who are guiding the process.

06:52:31.244 --> 06:52:34.086
And we are working on three distinct pieces.

06:52:35.217 --> 06:52:37.218
One is definitely support for administrators.

06:52:37.298 --> 06:52:39.940
So we're looking at online professional learning modules.

06:52:40.000 --> 06:52:48.525
So we want to make them easy to access and to meet the needs, the diverse needs of our administrators based on where they're at with supporting health education.

06:52:49.125 --> 06:52:54.388
They're going to be available online and they could also be available for in-person professional learning and professional development.

06:52:55.646 --> 06:53:00.930
In addition to that, we are going to, of course, have some professional learning programs for educators.

06:53:01.470 --> 06:53:07.814
And our goal is to do that at different regional levels so we can build the capacity of our counties.

06:53:08.295 --> 06:53:18.462
So we're going to bring county offices of education together at regional communities of practice, build their capacity so we have ongoing support even past this project.

06:53:18.502 --> 06:53:20.343
So it's not just about a project that just ends and

06:53:20.743 --> 06:53:21.544
Everything goes away.

06:53:21.624 --> 06:53:26.467
We really want our counties to feel empowered that they can continue supporting health education.

06:53:26.907 --> 06:53:33.291
We're going to build their capacity, give them everything that they need, resources that we're building together as the statewide committee.

06:53:34.191 --> 06:53:43.037
County offices of education come back and they provide local trainings for their districts and their schools so that they could help support, again, building also a networking community.

06:53:43.357 --> 06:53:44.577
Can districts talk to each other?

06:53:44.658 --> 06:53:46.419
Oh, how did you do your parent review nights?

06:53:46.799 --> 06:53:47.659
Oh, that's a great idea.

06:53:47.719 --> 06:53:48.460
We could adopt that.

06:53:49.180 --> 06:53:50.661
What do you do for your professional learning?

06:53:50.741 --> 06:53:57.404
Can counties, maybe smaller counties, come together and co-train their districts and teachers and provide that ongoing support?

06:53:57.845 --> 06:54:11.011
Then the last piece is we're going to build a website that we're going to house everything on, house all of the resources, the online professional learning modules for the administrators, as well all of the training materials and the resources that we're providing for teachers.

06:54:11.091 --> 06:54:15.154
And really the goal here is we're building in an evaluation process.

06:54:15.274 --> 06:54:17.575
Our goal is to glean information from our

06:54:18.435 --> 06:54:39.696
from the field, we want to get information from our county offices, we want to get information from our districts, and most importantly from our teachers, so that we can continue to improve this process, continue to meet the needs, because ultimately our main focus is student outcomes, and we really want to make sure that we're impacting our students in the best way we can around their health, knowing that that's going to make them college, career, and life-read.

06:54:40.816 --> 06:54:42.177
And that's the quick summary.

06:54:43.397 --> 06:54:43.798
Thank you.

06:54:44.978 --> 06:54:45.258
Thank you.

06:54:45.278 --> 06:54:57.283
So my last comment to both of you is I think it's really important that the public know that this is a resource that we provide for each of that we do for our content areas as a part of the statewide process.

06:54:57.524 --> 06:55:00.405
But it's a resource and that now it translates

06:55:01.005 --> 06:55:06.287
to action at the local level, which I believe the county offices provide support to local districts.

06:55:06.748 --> 06:55:21.915
But I think it's important to clarify what processes local districts must and will go through to actually translate this to professional development, to training, to guidance, to materials, to course guidelines, opt out.

06:55:22.375 --> 06:55:23.235
What happens now?

06:55:23.275 --> 06:55:28.838
Because this is a resource that we have spent a long time through a process, which I'm sure we're going to continue to talk about.

06:55:29.498 --> 06:55:39.205
What happens now is the process going forward to districts for the parents who have children who came and spoke and want to know what's going to happen to their children in the classroom.

06:55:39.706 --> 06:55:41.147
Could you translate that, Stephanie?

06:55:41.207 --> 06:55:43.689
And is that possible to think about just sort of simple?

06:55:43.989 --> 06:55:44.690
What happens next?

06:55:45.430 --> 06:55:58.743
So with the work of Doreen and Orange County Department and all of the health educators within this collaboration committee, as she said, we're building the capacity of the county offices to provide that local support for our school districts.

06:55:59.124 --> 06:56:07.332
So in helping and being a resource for them for any questions that they have around the California Healthy Youth Act, around instructional materials, around the content of the framework.

06:56:07.692 --> 06:56:14.776
to provide the professional learning that they need, but it's really up to the local school districts in how they implement all of this.

06:56:15.477 --> 06:56:23.341
And so it is, they do have to provide the comprehensive sex education in seventh or in middle school and in high school.

06:56:23.941 --> 06:56:27.763
That's not a choice, but how they do it is their decision.

06:56:28.244 --> 06:56:33.847
And so our job is just to provide them the resources and the support and able to do that in a high quality way.

06:56:36.516 --> 06:56:38.317
Can I just add a quick piece really?

06:56:39.298 --> 06:56:51.386
Currently, the county offices are doing that with our districts and I could speak, of course, for what we do in Orange County Department of Ed, but of course, also across the state, I have colleagues that we talk all the time and we are providing those services.

06:56:51.406 --> 06:56:56.589
We'll come out to districts and consult and really support that process, make sure that they have a really good understanding.

06:56:56.909 --> 06:56:59.593
Here are some tools for how to communicate parent opt-out.

06:56:59.953 --> 06:57:02.196
Transparency with parents is so important.

06:57:02.596 --> 06:57:08.344
Parents feel so much better when they've had an opportunity to dialogue with administrators and even teachers.

06:57:08.384 --> 06:57:12.008
Teachers have been doing a great job of explaining, no, no, that's not what we're teaching.

06:57:12.048 --> 06:57:12.949
We're actually teaching this.

06:57:13.650 --> 06:57:17.815
you have the right to come and view all of the curricula that we're sharing with your students.

06:57:18.255 --> 06:57:26.965
So we're definitely doing that, and I want you to know that our intention is to also build that into the rollout implementation project, ensure that we are providing that support.

06:57:27.386 --> 06:57:30.650
There is so much happening also around family health education.

06:57:31.030 --> 06:57:36.053
A lot of our districts and schools provide a ton of services on family-based health education.

06:57:36.313 --> 06:57:45.938
They do parent nights all the time for, you know, around, especially around like nutrition and how to be an active family, how to protect your kids, what you need to know as a parent around human trafficking.

06:57:46.338 --> 06:57:47.339
That stuff is happening.

06:57:47.679 --> 06:57:59.245
So we're really hoping that definitely guidance for educators, but because the framework also has that great family and community partnership piece, we really want to highlight that and engage families as partners.

06:57:59.705 --> 06:58:01.048
in supporting the health of their children.

06:58:01.088 --> 06:58:02.770
So we'll definitely be intentional about that.

06:58:08.809 --> 06:58:10.370
I was so engaged in the conversation.

06:58:10.410 --> 06:58:12.532
I wasn't paying attention that my turn was coming up.

06:58:12.592 --> 06:58:13.072
I'm sorry.

06:58:13.372 --> 06:58:32.865
Well, first of all, I want to thank Stephanie as well as the representative from Orange County for coming and talking to us about this work and about what is going on with the to support the rollout of the framework and to support districts in doing these very important, this very important work and engaging in these conversations.

06:58:33.425 --> 06:58:38.489
I heard a lot of parents asking us to read the framework, and I did.

06:58:39.089 --> 06:58:43.373
And I read the framework probably with a different lens than a lot.

06:58:43.634 --> 06:58:47.817
You guys are accustomed to me having all these different lenses, so thank you very much.

06:58:48.978 --> 06:58:55.965
But I read it probably with a very different lens because I've seen the development and the implementation of a lot of other frameworks.

06:58:56.305 --> 06:58:59.268
As I read the framework, the health framework draft,

06:58:59.848 --> 06:59:14.416
I couldn't help but think about the English Language Arts Framework because it changes the conversation that we can have with students about books like The Scarlet Letter or Huckleberry Finn, The Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe, The Lord of the Flies, and even Romeo and Juliet.

06:59:14.876 --> 06:59:19.880
As I read the Health Framework, I went back and looked at the History-Social Science Framework.

06:59:20.240 --> 06:59:30.667
The History-Social Science Framework was particularly important and personal to me because when I grew up, I had a history book that said the Ku Klux Klan just rode around at night on horses scaring black people.

06:59:31.724 --> 06:59:43.467
And so there's a soft racism to willful misinformation that leads people to believe things like, we don't have lynchings anymore in the South.

06:59:43.887 --> 06:59:52.569
And the fact of the matter is, last month, the state of Texas just executed the second brother who was involved in the lynching of James Byrd Jr.

06:59:52.889 --> 06:59:59.831
So we have to understand the purpose of the framework is not to narrow the conversation

07:00:00.211 --> 07:00:06.317
but to give guidance on the best practices for having very hard conversations.

07:00:06.737 --> 07:00:09.179
And that was the intention of this health framework.

07:00:09.780 --> 07:00:20.230
And the conversations that this health framework gives guidance to changes the frame that we can have conversations in a lot of other subject areas.

07:00:20.530 --> 07:00:22.772
And I think it's very important to remember that.

07:00:29.264 --> 07:00:37.211
Stephanie did a really nice job with this today on a very complicated, hard to understand topic, I'm sure, for many that are coming into it.

07:00:37.311 --> 07:00:40.914
I'm coming in late to the dance, so to speak, on this framework.

07:00:41.795 --> 07:00:49.622
And I read the framework as well from a parent's lens, and I think which most of us probably tried to do.

07:00:50.422 --> 07:00:54.043
And I think that there are portions of that framework that are very difficult.

07:00:55.703 --> 07:01:00.064
But 80 to 90%, like one of our speakers said, is pretty reasonable.

07:01:00.784 --> 07:01:02.584
I think the issues are with the resources.

07:01:03.785 --> 07:01:09.946
And I'm curious as to if you could talk a little bit about should a district, so one, they can opt out.

07:01:10.646 --> 07:01:12.446
The district can opt out of the framework.

07:01:12.906 --> 07:01:15.947
They don't have to implement any of the health framework, correct?

07:01:16.291 --> 07:01:18.032
So I would say that is correct.

07:01:18.253 --> 07:01:22.516
When we use the term opt out, we're saying opting out of comprehensive sex education.

07:01:23.437 --> 07:01:24.758
The framework is just guidance.

07:01:24.818 --> 07:01:26.299
So there's nothing to opt out on.

07:01:26.419 --> 07:01:29.061
It's whether or not you read it and you use it.

07:01:29.682 --> 07:01:29.982
Correct.

07:01:32.043 --> 07:01:34.906
Totally optional to implement any portions of the framework.

07:01:34.926 --> 07:01:35.106
Correct.

07:01:35.466 --> 07:01:40.210
If I'm a district and I choose to implement some portions of the framework, I can do that.

07:01:40.595 --> 07:01:48.261
Yes, if you choose your K-3 teachers, they are doing a study session and doing professional learning around health education and the standards.

07:01:48.641 --> 07:01:50.542
This could be the professional learning tool that they use.

07:01:51.103 --> 07:02:04.733
And so I'm a district, I adopt, I institute the reality that we're going to adopt the K-12 health framework and I utilize resources that some of my community are having a difficult time with.

07:02:05.093 --> 07:02:07.255
What are the opt-out provisions for parents with regards to that?

07:02:07.802 --> 07:02:10.163
So the resources are not instructional materials.

07:02:10.823 --> 07:02:11.744
They are tools.

07:02:12.524 --> 07:02:18.246
So it is up to the local school district and how to utilize that, those tools, and how to communicate those tools.

07:02:18.406 --> 07:02:26.389
I would highly recommend that they communicate very clearly around what they're using, why they're using it, and make them available to the parents to preview.

07:02:27.770 --> 07:02:33.992
Would there be any guidance for a district who chooses not to use those resources in terms of how they choose their resources?

07:02:34.614 --> 07:02:44.721
Yes, so we do have a chapter within the framework that is around instructional materials and what criteria they should be looking at when reviewing other different types of curriculum or instructional materials.

07:02:45.942 --> 07:02:57.750
And would it be relevant for the board to consider the STORC as part of the resources that we remove?

07:03:01.297 --> 07:03:01.957
I would say no.

07:03:02.317 --> 07:03:07.759
I would say because it is a resource for, it's in the partnering with the family piece.

07:03:07.939 --> 07:03:17.421
It is about if you have a parent, a parent community that needs a resource to engage in conversations with their students, here's one that you can do that with.

07:03:17.881 --> 07:03:20.522
That's perfectly age appropriate and medically accurate.

07:03:20.542 --> 07:03:24.583
Thank you.

07:03:31.434 --> 07:03:50.639
I agree with that characterization that 90% of it, I think, is just very uncontroversial and actually brings to a fore and puts in one place for districts to easily access things that I think have been wanting to happen.

07:03:51.020 --> 07:03:51.540
Things around

07:03:52.940 --> 07:04:08.676
hydration, sunscreen, sort of breaking down decision-making in ways that I think are sort of digestible, are really, I think, incredibly well done, and for the most part, I think, are really uncontroversial, certainly based on the comments we've heard today.

07:04:09.977 --> 07:04:14.160
Actually, I want to thank both you, Stephanie, as well as all the folks who came out for public comment.

07:04:15.421 --> 07:04:27.851
Regardless of whether we all end up in agreement, and I suspect we will not, what is also very clear is that there are a lot of parents who are looking to do the best that they can for their kids.

07:04:29.472 --> 07:04:35.338
We, I think, all school systems need parents to be advocates for their children in all forms.

07:04:35.418 --> 07:04:45.147
And so we will end up in different spaces, but I think making sure that that is sort of the guiding principle that unites us, I think, is really important to lift up.

07:04:47.069 --> 07:05:00.880
I think there's also a lot of sort of new planks that I just want to lift up and offer some celebration of that haven't traditionally been a part of the health framework that haven't gotten as much airtime that I think are pretty fantastic.

07:05:02.161 --> 07:05:15.511
The idea of there being a curriculum around consent and refusal is certainly not anything that was part of my California public education, but I think is a really timely and smart thing for California to do around boundary setting,

07:05:16.331 --> 07:05:32.536
around inclusion of all families so that children feel whatever family structure they come from, that all of their parents are welcome at family night, be they grandparents, parents, extended family, foster family, whatever that might be.

07:05:32.556 --> 07:05:40.199
I think the list of books here certainly I think goes through a process of

07:05:42.140 --> 07:05:47.402
addressing, I would say, most of the concerns that we've heard raised during public comment.

07:05:48.863 --> 07:05:52.085
So I have, maybe I have a couple of sets of comments.

07:05:53.305 --> 07:06:08.653
One is, as a new board member, I would just love to hear more about what the process for the recommendation of resources looks like to know, and I don't know if this was covered in a previous board meeting, but how some of these resources came to be recommended resources.

07:06:10.494 --> 07:06:17.137
And whether we should expect to see these appear or not reappear for instructional material hearings in the future.

07:06:19.619 --> 07:06:27.223
And then I have a... So I'll just bracket that and I'll just say I have a couple of small but I think surgical sort of...

07:06:28.423 --> 07:06:29.805
amendments that I would like to propose.

07:06:31.787 --> 07:06:35.011
Should I pause and let you process?

07:06:35.491 --> 07:06:39.476
So let me first by saying thank you for bringing up the sunscreen piece.

07:06:39.576 --> 07:06:42.800
We had a public comment submitted by a high school student.

07:06:43.260 --> 07:06:47.703
around skin cancer and wanting to include a lot more guidance around applying sunscreen.

07:06:48.043 --> 07:06:58.690
And so that's why you see all of those pieces within the framework is because we had a high school student that did her research and submitted it through public comment and the IQC recommended those edits.

07:06:59.350 --> 07:07:03.613
As far as the resources were concerned, these resources were compiled in several different ways.

07:07:03.873 --> 07:07:08.316
One, through the public comment process during the CFCC meetings.

07:07:08.776 --> 07:07:12.219
We had, I'll give you a specific example, the sexual health roundtable.

07:07:12.799 --> 07:07:15.920
The Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee.

07:07:16.280 --> 07:07:17.441
Thank you, Board Member Rucker.

07:07:19.161 --> 07:07:29.285
We had the Sexual Health Roundtable provided public comment, expansive public comment, and had a listing of resources that they would like to have seen included.

07:07:29.345 --> 07:07:31.186
So that's where some of the resources came from.

07:07:31.606 --> 07:07:34.587
Some of the resources came from the CFCC members themselves.

07:07:35.167 --> 07:07:39.769
As far as educators and health education specialists, they knew that these were resources that were

07:07:40.129 --> 07:07:44.352
were going to work and were medically accurate, and so they wanted them included.

07:07:44.992 --> 07:07:46.373
So that's where the resources come from.

07:07:46.413 --> 07:07:50.735
They come from either the CFCC members or through public comment.

07:07:51.216 --> 07:07:52.176
And then they're vetted.

07:07:52.777 --> 07:07:57.920
So depending on where they've come from, they are vetted through the CFCC members.

07:07:58.040 --> 07:08:01.582
They go through a vetting process to determine if they should be included or not.

07:08:02.262 --> 07:08:04.684
And then the IQC also goes through that process as well.

07:08:05.543 --> 07:08:10.405
So will these recommended resources come back for instructional?

07:08:10.925 --> 07:08:11.565
No, they will not.

07:08:11.685 --> 07:08:14.607
The instruction materials adoption process is different.

07:08:14.827 --> 07:08:20.529
So it is about a comprehensive curriculum that covers 180 days of instruction.

07:08:20.829 --> 07:08:22.490
So it's a complete curriculum.

07:08:22.850 --> 07:08:26.931
So we're talking textbooks, worksheets, those type of things.

07:08:27.111 --> 07:08:27.792
These are books.

07:08:28.272 --> 07:08:29.052
These are songs.

07:08:29.192 --> 07:08:29.973
These are poems.

07:08:30.013 --> 07:08:30.793
These are videos.

07:08:30.873 --> 07:08:33.574
Those are resources, not instructional materials.

07:08:34.326 --> 07:08:35.006
That's very helpful.

07:08:36.087 --> 07:08:48.032
OK, so on the surgical side, Chapter 4, which is the third grade curriculum, you had made reference to it, and several speakers had as well.

07:08:48.092 --> 07:08:50.853
So Chapter 4, page 62, one of the public

07:08:54.514 --> 07:08:54.794
Yes.

07:08:57.195 --> 07:08:57.795
Oh, okay.

07:08:57.835 --> 07:09:02.656
So chapter four in my printed version is grades four through six.

07:09:03.876 --> 07:09:07.957
And I have it on my version as page 62.

07:09:08.037 --> 07:09:21.239
And this is one of the, there were several written comments submitted on this as well as a couple of speakers who addressed raising issues in fourth grade or fifth grade around masturbation.

07:09:21.440 --> 07:09:23.380
You addressed it in your comments at the top.

07:09:23.920 --> 07:09:30.883
The language that I have in front of me printed is when the topic of masturbation is introduced or arises.

07:09:31.704 --> 07:09:36.786
And I think the comment that we heard was, why would it be introduced?

07:09:36.926 --> 07:09:50.273
And I think your clarifying comment at the beginning was, if it arises, to address it, as opposed to, is it the independent responsibility of the teacher to raise it and introduce the topic if it's not raised by students?

07:09:50.333 --> 07:10:11.819
It's not the independent responsibility of the teacher to raise it, but if it comes through discussion, through a video that the district has adopted around sex education, then we want to make sure that the teachers have the knowledge and understanding of how to approach that topic in a meaningful way for our students and in an age-appropriate way.

07:10:13.226 --> 07:10:28.757
So, I mean, to your earlier comment, that sounds like if it arises, if it is raised from someone else as opposed to putting the onus on the teacher to have today's unit, we'll begin with this, which doesn't strike me as terribly age appropriate for fourth graders.

07:10:29.638 --> 07:10:34.502
If it comes up, I get the idea as to why it would make more sense.

07:10:35.582 --> 07:10:43.568
I also thought the explanation that you provided for it's not the stork as being a family resource was incredibly helpful.

07:10:44.609 --> 07:10:57.778
As a standalone book sort of for a child to explore on their own, I could see that being problematic for younger children particularly, but with the proviso that it would actually go to a family for parental discussion.

07:10:57.838 --> 07:11:00.020
That's a very helpful caveat.

07:11:02.061 --> 07:11:11.008
The last comment that I wanted to raise for the board's discussion, this is chapter five, which is

07:11:15.135 --> 07:11:19.636
grades 7 through 8, so I think that's 11 to 13-year-olds.

07:11:20.216 --> 07:11:31.239
There's a recommended activity in groups to talk about oral sex and sexting, which again was

07:11:33.099 --> 07:11:36.920
Page 30 in my version of Chapter 5.

07:11:36.960 --> 07:11:46.584
And I apologize, I was flipping through making little... So are you looking at the classroom example of sexual health and healthy relationship scenarios?

07:11:46.844 --> 07:11:47.084
Right.

07:11:47.404 --> 07:11:56.387
And part of, I think, what we heard from public comment, as well as a theme that recurs throughout this document,

07:11:57.087 --> 07:12:02.712
is that in California, we know that it's less than 5% of kids who are sexually active until they're 13.

07:12:03.912 --> 07:12:18.864
And so introducing concepts around oral sex and sexting before they're 13, in some ways, I think, sort of puts a conversation in play before we have kids who are in play.

07:12:20.024 --> 07:12:27.387
And I think prompting that discussion among 11 and 12-year-olds in seventh grade strikes me as premature.

07:12:27.868 --> 07:12:35.591
So I would direct you to on page 29 of that chapter, you'll see the standards that this is aligned to.

07:12:36.511 --> 07:12:44.061
And one of the standards is talking about explain the immediate physical, social, and emotional risks and consequences associated with sexual activity.

07:12:44.382 --> 07:12:45.764
It's a decision-making standard.

07:12:46.144 --> 07:12:51.151
So this activity is aligned directly with the standards that are covered in middle school.

07:12:54.258 --> 07:12:56.681
I think there are lots of ways to implement those standards.

07:12:57.742 --> 07:12:58.843
Yeah.

07:12:59.064 --> 07:13:08.215
So I think in the spirit of surgery, which is where you started, if you wanted to make any specific proposals, those are things we can consider.

07:13:08.915 --> 07:13:14.222
So my two surgical proposals or motion would be on page.

07:13:15.222 --> 07:13:28.305
page 62 of chapter 4 to remove the introducing language around the masturbation paragraph, and to on page 30, sorry, 33, 30, excuse me.

07:13:28.345 --> 07:13:31.886
Oh, the, page 30 of chapter 4.

07:13:48.047 --> 07:13:52.448
Page 30 of Chapter 5 for grades 7 and 8.

07:13:54.448 --> 07:13:59.309
And the line numbers on the side are 8, 11 around questions around... Okay.

07:14:02.410 --> 07:14:05.351
I'm just keeping track of those.

07:14:05.811 --> 07:14:10.352
If we want to make those into motions, we will come back to them.

07:14:10.772 --> 07:14:10.932
Emma?

07:14:13.304 --> 07:14:14.225
Thank you for your comments.

07:14:14.625 --> 07:14:15.446
I really appreciate them.

07:14:16.206 --> 07:14:18.287
I think this is a necessary conversation.

07:14:18.327 --> 07:14:33.837
I know it may feel premature, but I feel that since students start having sex like 13 years old, you know, if they have those conversations earlier, they are ready when they are 13 to understand if I do choose to do it, okay, this is how I could protect myself in a way.

07:14:34.277 --> 07:14:41.522
And I feel like it's an important conversation that a lot of students need to have just to know and understand because you never know what's going to happen.

07:14:42.282 --> 07:14:48.425
And, you know, it's just, you know, I got sex ed when I was 10 years old, and I feel like I learned a lot of valuable lessons.

07:14:48.445 --> 07:14:54.847
They probably were not in play at 10 years old, but I carried them when I'm in high school, when I'm in college.

07:14:54.887 --> 07:14:55.888
I'm going to keep carrying those.

07:14:56.148 --> 07:15:02.530
You know, I learned about things when I was 10 that my peers did not have access to until they were freshmen or probably until they were college.

07:15:02.890 --> 07:15:06.872
So I feel that when they learn this information early, they'll be able to carry it on in the future.

07:15:07.232 --> 07:15:09.813
Or like, let's say they forget it and they relearn it in the future.

07:15:09.833 --> 07:15:11.794
They could be like, oh, yeah, I learned this in the past.

07:15:12.214 --> 07:15:13.396
I know how to do it, you know?

07:15:13.917 --> 07:15:17.401
And so I just feel like this is important conversation to have at this age.

07:15:17.842 --> 07:15:19.324
You know, it's just, yeah.

07:15:19.704 --> 07:15:27.794
And I would like to remind that the Comprehensive Sexual Health, the Healthy Youth Act requires comprehensive sexual health education to be taught in middle school.

07:15:28.075 --> 07:15:28.936
And this is middle school.

07:15:31.544 --> 07:15:34.145
I'm gonna add a comment and then go to Felisa.

07:15:34.946 --> 07:15:41.649
I think that having comprehensive sex education in middle school makes a lot of sense, and I respect what Hema said.

07:15:42.110 --> 07:15:57.398
I think the question is whether for students who have never experienced any of this, introducing the notions of oral sex, of sexting, of other specific sexual acts that are not in the context here,

07:15:58.278 --> 07:16:04.347
of a general discussion of what sex is and sex education is the question.

07:16:05.108 --> 07:16:13.219
At what point should the school be introducing students to particular sexual acts and at what point should they be

07:16:13.905 --> 07:16:23.213
giving more of a fundamental exposition of the nature of what sexual activity is.

07:16:23.694 --> 07:16:39.188
So I think that's the question, that's a question I appreciate too as the parent of three kids that we're on a careful trajectory here not to be introducing things as though they are endorsed in some way.

07:16:47.564 --> 07:17:08.754
Can I just, because you talked about sexting, in the California Healthy Youth Act there is language around providing education regarding the potential risks and consequences of creating and sharing sexually suggestive or sexually explicit materials through cellular telephones, social networking, internet websites, computer networks, or other digital media.

07:17:09.074 --> 07:17:10.815
So that is part of the Healthy Youth Act.

07:17:15.083 --> 07:17:16.044
otherwise known as sexting.

07:17:17.685 --> 07:17:25.813
Yeah, I just want to say that, you know, I happen to have a lot of educators in the family and in my circle of friends.

07:17:25.873 --> 07:17:31.858
And even though I want to preserve the innocence of our children and I want to believe that this is not happening, it's happening.

07:17:32.418 --> 07:17:34.740
It's, I mean, we may want to, you know,

07:17:37.022 --> 07:17:39.363
And I heard a lot of parents say, we want to protect our innocence.

07:17:39.403 --> 07:17:44.104
None of us here would want to sexualize our kids before the time happens.

07:17:44.424 --> 07:17:45.724
But a lot of this is happening.

07:17:45.804 --> 07:17:47.344
And I think it's important for our students.

07:17:47.364 --> 07:17:48.905
We're in a whole different age now.

07:17:49.045 --> 07:17:51.925
Social media sex scene happens.

07:17:52.045 --> 07:17:54.446
And it's happening as young as fifth grade.

07:17:54.486 --> 07:17:55.546
It's happening in elementary.

07:17:55.886 --> 07:18:00.407
And guess what happens when somebody sends an inappropriate picture?

07:18:00.467 --> 07:18:02.067
Now it's sexual harassment.

07:18:02.447 --> 07:18:05.188
And maybe this person thought that they were just being

07:18:05.908 --> 07:18:11.874
playful, but there is consequences when you also send a picture that's unwanted to somebody else.

07:18:11.914 --> 07:18:16.038
And as a parent, I would be sure to walk to that school and make sure there's consequences.

07:18:16.358 --> 07:18:18.500
But it's important for us to educate on both ends.

07:18:18.720 --> 07:18:23.705
One, you don't send it and why it's inappropriate to send, but also realizing that this is happening in our schools.

07:18:27.220 --> 07:18:31.765
I appreciate the comments that I have heard made on this.

07:18:32.145 --> 07:18:38.891
This is why this is such a sensitive topic because the question is not what it is we should be teaching about.

07:18:38.911 --> 07:18:42.675
I think there's an agreement that we have to implement the statute.

07:18:43.055 --> 07:18:49.862
I think that there's an agreement that there's an urgency to some of this content because there's a lot of dangerous activities.

07:18:50.242 --> 07:18:55.467
that are happening around our children and around all of us, as a matter of fact.

07:18:55.928 --> 07:19:05.537
I think the point that's being made and what parents who came here today to object to the framework, they're not objecting to the fact that we are

07:19:06.067 --> 07:19:20.861
implementing a mandate, they're objecting to, in the ways that the content is being presented, that we in some way seem to be endorsing some kind of conversation that they are not happy with or that they are uncomfortable with.

07:19:21.181 --> 07:19:24.523
So, I clearly heard that and I understood that.

07:19:25.044 --> 07:19:43.216
I think that what board member Patil-Brownson is trying to suggest with her surgical edits is to identify ways to write out these scenarios in a way that frames what the issues are without actually endorsing

07:19:43.696 --> 07:19:46.640
a practice, or a specific subject matter.

07:19:47.140 --> 07:19:50.304
So, here's the concern with that.

07:19:51.445 --> 07:19:59.695
If my mom was a classroom teacher for 45 years, and if you wanted to look up the word conservative in the dictionary, her picture should be next to that.

07:20:00.436 --> 07:20:16.607
Having said that, however, she would endorse every single thing that's in the content of this, primarily because she knows, particularly for girls, they are at danger when they don't know or don't understand these concerns and these issues.

07:20:17.068 --> 07:20:27.315
And as she retired as a classroom teacher in sixth grade, the same year that I started teaching the sixth grade, and there was this word that I heard growing up

07:20:27.695 --> 07:20:31.600
The first question I was asked when we did our sex education unit is, Ms.

07:20:31.620 --> 07:20:33.042
Rucker, what does it mean to be fast?

07:20:35.208 --> 07:20:38.229
See, everybody who started smiling, you heard that expression.

07:20:38.629 --> 07:20:41.290
And so I said, well, fast is being sophisticated.

07:20:41.370 --> 07:20:43.530
Well, what does that mean?

07:20:44.010 --> 07:20:59.134
What we're trying to do with these scenarios and what we're trying to do with developing this curriculum is to help our students understand all the information they're already being bombarded with.

07:20:59.714 --> 07:21:03.295
And there are people who will say, we have an obligation to do this.

07:21:03.355 --> 07:21:07.536
The legislature has already identified the things we have an obligation to do.

07:21:07.976 --> 07:21:18.359
We can't really implement the FAIR Act in the history of social science framework without trying to address some of the concerns that people find objectionable in this framework.

07:21:18.659 --> 07:21:20.540
So we do have to do this.

07:21:21.160 --> 07:21:27.282
And trying to be surgical, it's like, are you going to take the bandage off slowly, or are you going to rip it off?

07:21:27.742 --> 07:21:33.065
That's the sensitivity that parents are trying to express in their objections.

07:21:33.105 --> 07:21:37.427
They are not saying that we're all fascists or that we're doing horrible things.

07:21:37.467 --> 07:21:42.289
Yes, there were a few people who said that, but that's not what their great sensitivity was.

07:21:42.730 --> 07:21:51.194
They feel like the framework is endorsing a behavior or endorsing a content that they don't feel that they're ready to see.

07:21:51.334 --> 07:21:54.876
So, if we're going to take the danger of what we're about to do now

07:21:55.296 --> 07:22:05.328
and sitting here today to try to edit this content and do this surgery is that we'll start going through every single chapter and every single page.

07:22:05.729 --> 07:22:10.214
I want to remind you of what the actual recommendation says.

07:22:10.875 --> 07:22:13.117
We're going to adopt this framework.

07:22:13.738 --> 07:22:17.081
We're going to include the changes that were made by the IQC.

07:22:17.621 --> 07:22:21.484
We're going to remove some very controversial content.

07:22:22.044 --> 07:22:31.292
And we're doing those things with the intent of creating some guidance about how to move forward with the conversation.

07:22:31.812 --> 07:22:34.154
It's not an endorsement of bad behavior.

07:22:34.674 --> 07:22:50.743
But it will accomplish the one thing that I think my very conservative mother who taught school for 45 years and went to private Christian college in Texas and in Mississippi to get her teacher preparation credential so that every girl would understand what it means to be fast.

07:22:51.707 --> 07:23:09.420
and that they would understand what it means to cope with that and do things in ways that all of the parents who were here concerned about, they would learn as an outcome the behaviors that these parents already want to know that their children will have, retain their sweetness, their kindness, their innocence.

07:23:09.760 --> 07:23:13.603
I think that's what we're trying to do with the work and the framework.

07:23:18.355 --> 07:23:19.336
Thank you, Madam President.

07:23:19.556 --> 07:23:35.586
And I would also echo my appreciation, Stephanie and staff and the consultants and to the board liaison who helped frame this and really the thoughtful approach that the board members really took to hearing from the speakers today.

07:23:35.986 --> 07:23:43.831
I think one of the things that it reflects is that no matter how many periods for public comment you have, these are complex issues.

07:23:44.231 --> 07:23:46.653
It is hard to communicate across the state.

07:23:47.713 --> 07:24:03.340
And by way of example, I would just say many of the speakers I heard reference at least two of the resources that were being recommended to not be included, they mentioned in their comments because it is hard to get some of the information across.

07:24:04.761 --> 07:24:07.402
I also appreciate the folks who spoke in public comment.

07:24:07.762 --> 07:24:12.968
Whether you were in support or in opposition to the frameworks, I think the board heard you.

07:24:13.408 --> 07:24:14.850
I think we, the staff, hear you.

07:24:15.411 --> 07:24:22.218
And one thing that I heard, I think there's an opportunity for us to even do a good, a better job of educating school districts.

07:24:22.799 --> 07:24:28.946
Because what we heard today from many of the speakers is that their school districts said some things that are not completely accurate.

07:24:29.486 --> 07:24:34.610
Like, go to the state and tell them, they're making us do this, we have to do this.

07:24:35.171 --> 07:24:46.820
And the clarification that was made is that as it relates to what is required, the only thing required is the California Healthy Youth Act, and then even there, there are opt-out provisions.

07:24:47.260 --> 07:24:55.847
And so, I think that there are opportunities for clarification with our school district partners about what this means.

07:24:56.168 --> 07:25:07.457
But I think it would be very helpful if you would, Stephanie, take it one step further of a train of conversation that Vice President Strauss started.

07:25:07.757 --> 07:25:11.681
She asked you to break it down, and I thought it was really, really helpful to break it down.

07:25:11.841 --> 07:25:13.102
What's going to happen next?

07:25:13.562 --> 07:25:20.831
Because not all of us use the language of frameworks and standards and guidance and guiding.

07:25:21.551 --> 07:25:29.420
Some of us sometimes think that once something gets passed, it immediately becomes a lesson plan that gets taught for a student.

07:25:30.061 --> 07:25:30.502
I thought that.

07:25:31.744 --> 07:25:39.249
And I think it's helpful to explain what this really means for teachers in a classroom.

07:25:39.689 --> 07:25:45.753
Because if it's going to get taught, if a resource is going to get used, it seems to me that requires a lot of training.

07:25:46.634 --> 07:25:49.456
These are not easy topics to talk about for anyone.

07:25:50.736 --> 07:25:54.879
But could you say, just take it just a step further, what will happen

07:25:57.521 --> 07:26:07.354
help to dispel the myth that, should this framework be approved today, that it goes immediately to a curriculum and a lesson plan that is being taught.

07:26:07.735 --> 07:26:13.463
If you could just give us a scenario of what will happen in, say, the average classroom or an everyday classroom scenario.

07:26:14.428 --> 07:26:19.571
To be honest, there's a lot of teachers that probably have no idea that the health education framework is being talked about right now.

07:26:19.731 --> 07:26:20.231
I believe that.

07:26:21.311 --> 07:26:31.537
So once the state board takes action and we have the draft that's posted now, that stays that draft posted until we do our final publication.

07:26:31.857 --> 07:26:33.578
And then the final publication comes out.

07:26:33.918 --> 07:26:38.520
But in the meantime, there is all the professional learning that districts can engage in.

07:26:38.840 --> 07:26:39.821
So this is their choice.

07:26:40.681 --> 07:26:45.303
They get to choose to reach out to their county office and say, I need professional learning on this.

07:26:45.903 --> 07:26:49.084
So the California Healthy Youth Act has been in effect since 2016.

07:26:49.264 --> 07:26:51.425
That's three years.

07:26:51.885 --> 07:26:59.467
So already, comprehensive sexual health education has been being taught in once in middle school and once in high school for the past three years.

07:27:00.027 --> 07:27:07.170
Some of the teachers are now understanding what kind of guidance that they need, and that is what you see in the framework.

07:27:08.110 --> 07:27:14.394
So you will see health educators at high school and I can ask Commissioner Wu who is to come on up.

07:27:14.474 --> 07:27:16.816
She is a high school health educator.

07:27:16.856 --> 07:27:22.380
She can talk about the professional learning that it's in her district and what her teachers may be doing.

07:27:22.420 --> 07:27:37.670
Now she probably has a little bit different perspective because she's been involved in the development of the framework for three years so she may be a little partial to it and I'm sure her colleagues at her high school are also involved in it but this is to give you one perspective.

07:27:38.170 --> 07:27:51.481
And to do that, just so we amplify it, no one, after all those steps take place, is going to go into the classrooms of any school and say, you have to use these resources that were in the framework.

07:27:51.721 --> 07:27:56.585
You have to use this framework and here's your lesson plan and the topics that you have to cover.

07:27:56.845 --> 07:27:57.246
Correct.

07:27:57.386 --> 07:27:57.686
Thank you.

07:27:57.706 --> 07:28:04.812
So the truth is across our state that most of our students are not getting health education.

07:28:06.499 --> 07:28:07.160
and that's K-12.

07:28:07.260 --> 07:28:19.989
What we're hoping is that with the release of this, more of our students will and that teachers will understand how to do it and how to put it into their existing curriculum.

07:28:20.470 --> 07:28:28.155
The California Healthy Youth Act has been officially law for three years and schools, districts are slowly rolling it out.

07:28:30.598 --> 07:28:35.864
My district has a health course at high school level that is a graduation requirement.

07:28:35.985 --> 07:28:42.613
It's only a semester long, so we only get to teach about half the standards, but we absolutely cover the California Healthy Youth Act.

07:28:45.763 --> 07:28:48.464
At the high school level, we're doing a pretty good job.

07:28:48.924 --> 07:28:54.205
I can tell you in my district, the junior high level's hit and miss.

07:28:54.485 --> 07:28:55.385
We know it's out there.

07:28:55.465 --> 07:28:58.506
We've tried to train the teachers in doing it.

07:28:58.606 --> 07:29:03.027
We've got a curriculum that was adopted by our board.

07:29:03.607 --> 07:29:08.988
And I have been part of the training for those seventh and eighth grade teachers to get that information out there.

07:29:09.608 --> 07:29:13.109
But it's hard for them because they're not health teachers.

07:29:13.929 --> 07:29:39.853
They're science teachers and PE teachers that are trying to teach that that curriculum And and this is a tough curriculum to put on a PE teacher So it's it's really tough and so There was a lot of question as the CFCC was going through this that they wanted it to be more balanced like one-sixth of it for each of the six subject areas sort of thing and

07:29:41.596 --> 07:29:43.237
We kind of had to talk them out of that.

07:29:43.577 --> 07:29:50.960
It's a little heavy towards the sex ed stuff because that's the California Healthy Youth Act.

07:29:51.641 --> 07:29:58.024
And that's where our schools need the guidance the most because one way or another, that's getting taught.

07:29:59.244 --> 07:30:12.793
The rest of it, if it's going to get taught, and we really, really hope it does, but it's most likely going to be taught by teachers who are trained and have a credential in health and therefore they don't need quite as much guidance.

07:30:13.653 --> 07:30:23.700
And we came very close to being curriculum in a few sections of this framework because we understand that these teachers are out there and they need something.

07:30:25.021 --> 07:30:30.687
And so we gave them as much information as we could to allow them to get this.

07:30:30.847 --> 07:30:32.529
And teachers know about frameworks.

07:30:32.910 --> 07:30:35.793
Teachers talk standards and frameworks all day, every day.

07:30:36.414 --> 07:30:37.194
It's what they do.

07:30:37.815 --> 07:30:41.519
And so they've had the standards since 2008.

07:30:43.141 --> 07:30:54.831
giving them a framework to actually help them fulfill these standards, hopefully that will allow those standards to start to spread down into those younger grades, and those kids will start getting the information that they need to protect themselves.

07:30:55.452 --> 07:31:10.365
And so that sex ed isn't quite as much of a shock when they do get it in eighth grade, because if they're getting the little bit about relationships and stuff like that that happens at kindergarten and third grade and fifth grade, then when we're talking about it later, it will be easier for them.

07:31:11.626 --> 07:31:12.907
They know the standards are there.

07:31:12.927 --> 07:31:15.089
The teachers are aware of them.

07:31:15.970 --> 07:31:20.053
They're overwhelmed, especially those K through six teachers.

07:31:20.514 --> 07:31:23.056
They're overwhelmed by the number of standards they already have.

07:31:23.977 --> 07:31:33.505
And throwing another set at them, it's not going to happen unless we can give them guidance and curriculum for how do you do this along with.

07:31:34.306 --> 07:31:37.829
Kindergarten, it says things grow.

07:31:39.508 --> 07:31:40.669
The kids become adults.

07:31:41.410 --> 07:31:42.711
That's one of the health standards.

07:31:43.312 --> 07:31:44.533
It's also a science standard.

07:31:45.274 --> 07:31:46.495
And so we put that link in.

07:31:46.515 --> 07:31:48.758
This is how you tell things are alive.

07:31:48.858 --> 07:31:51.481
And so they can put that together with what they're teaching.

07:31:51.861 --> 07:31:53.543
And the framework allows them to do that.

07:31:56.553 --> 07:31:56.833
Thank you.

07:31:56.873 --> 07:32:06.485
So put another way, would you say that this is not a you must do manual, but rather a training manual or how to if you are called upon to lead these conversations?

07:32:06.625 --> 07:32:06.785
Right.

07:32:06.885 --> 07:32:10.310
Especially for the people who are being told, oh, guess what?

07:32:10.330 --> 07:32:13.634
You get to teach sex ed at the junior high and the high school level.

07:32:13.974 --> 07:32:14.214
Thank you.

07:32:16.241 --> 07:32:17.462
So, thank you very much.

07:32:17.902 --> 07:32:27.890
I want to note that as we get close to 5 o'clock, Stephanie's 17-year-old son is having a birthday this evening and we actually want her to be there for the birthday party.

07:32:27.910 --> 07:32:33.395
So, we're going to begin to move along towards making a motion.

07:32:33.775 --> 07:32:40.480
And just to sort of add another point to what our state superintendent was noting, it is

07:32:41.961 --> 07:32:52.571
intended to be useful guidance to teachers but it is, there's no resource that a teacher must use or a district must use and they can use other resources that are not here.

07:32:53.151 --> 07:32:59.417
It is intended to provide information about how all this breadth of topics can be addressed.

07:32:59.837 --> 07:33:06.563
There's as much in here for young people about how to say no, what consent means, how not to harass, how not to be harassed.

07:33:07.484 --> 07:33:13.250
as there is about how to be safe as they encounter sex.

07:33:13.270 --> 07:33:16.653
So we understand now the framework.

07:33:16.713 --> 07:33:20.638
I think we understand the way in which it's intended to be received.

07:33:21.458 --> 07:33:25.983
And I think we're ready to begin to propose a motion perhaps.

07:33:26.804 --> 07:33:35.013
Yes, I would like to move the department's recommendation to approve the framework with the removal of the following specific resources.

07:33:35.253 --> 07:33:37.135
My Princess Boy, Who Are You?

07:33:37.215 --> 07:33:42.741
The Kid's Guide to Gender Identity, Changing You, What's Happening to My Body, and Sex.

07:33:44.677 --> 07:33:46.899
And the remainder of the motion.

07:33:47.619 --> 07:33:49.821
I'm sorry, I don't have it here.

07:33:50.502 --> 07:34:04.112
Authorize CDE staff pending the State Board Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the SBE, correction of any typographical errors, and non-substantive clarifying edits.

07:34:04.132 --> 07:34:05.193
Okay.

07:34:07.284 --> 07:34:09.945
And then I think we could get maybe a second on that motion.

07:34:10.025 --> 07:34:16.547
If there are revisions requested by the SBE, we could take it up as a second, as a separate motion if there were.

07:34:17.287 --> 07:34:18.548
I would like to second the motion.

07:34:19.148 --> 07:34:20.488
Okay.

07:34:20.608 --> 07:34:24.809
So understanding that if there are other revisions requested, we'll take that up next.

07:34:24.889 --> 07:34:28.711
We'll go ahead and vote on this motion so that we can keep things clean.

07:34:29.671 --> 07:34:29.871
Sure.

07:34:35.051 --> 07:34:41.913
the third grade framework that we were discussing earlier, your verbal clarification was very helpful.

07:34:42.133 --> 07:34:50.016
Would it count as a typographical correction to actually clarify that you're not asking teachers to introduce the topic?

07:34:50.576 --> 07:34:51.616
You're talking about fifth grade?

07:34:51.656 --> 07:34:52.637
That is in fifth grade.

07:34:56.538 --> 07:34:56.898
It's 4 through 6.

07:34:56.938 --> 07:34:57.918
Sorry, no, it is 4 through 6.

07:34:58.158 --> 07:34:58.558
You're right.

07:34:58.938 --> 07:35:01.479
Yes, I do have it marked to take out that.

07:35:01.499 --> 07:35:02.760
So that would count as a type?

07:35:02.820 --> 07:35:03.260
Yes, it would.

07:35:03.280 --> 07:35:03.660
OK, great.

07:35:10.992 --> 07:35:11.912
Okay, so with that.

07:35:11.932 --> 07:35:15.673
My microphone is, oh there it goes.

07:35:16.653 --> 07:35:17.493
It's been cut off.

07:35:19.114 --> 07:35:20.134
Let us go ahead.

07:35:20.174 --> 07:35:22.714
Is there any other discussion before we vote on the motion?

07:35:23.335 --> 07:35:24.415
All in favor say aye.

07:35:25.295 --> 07:35:26.315
Any opposed say nay.

07:35:27.175 --> 07:35:27.955
Any abstentions?

07:35:28.696 --> 07:35:29.616
The motion passes.

07:35:30.736 --> 07:35:40.238
And then if there are any other final revisions requested by the SPE as in the last bullet, we'll take a moment to see if everyone is content with where we are now.

07:35:43.306 --> 07:35:48.992
It says if there are approval of final revisions requested by the SB, so if there are any other revisions.

07:35:50.353 --> 07:35:54.698
Or any technical, non-substantive clarifying edits, et cetera.

07:35:56.560 --> 07:36:00.504
I think we already took care of the question that Kim raised, so.

07:36:02.526 --> 07:36:03.367
Yes, do you want to?

07:36:13.370 --> 07:36:17.193
I'm much more confident in my understanding of child development in the zero to eight space.

07:36:17.813 --> 07:36:21.416
Many of you are much more content experts in the junior high and middle school space.

07:36:22.276 --> 07:36:40.710
So I would welcome any discussion that you want to offer beyond what has been offered, but I think it's much more, there's much more literature to support that young children in the zero to eight space oftentimes would have no idea what masturbation is and until you have that conversation and it would be introducing it.

07:36:41.130 --> 07:36:43.432
something that is largely unknown in the middle school years.

07:36:43.932 --> 07:36:49.897
I think that may be something different, and I would defer to people who are more experts on middle school.

07:36:52.800 --> 07:36:54.581
And my children are not yet in middle school.

07:37:00.445 --> 07:37:05.408
This is Judy size we want to clarify that the motion does include the IQC edits as well Felisa, is that correct?

07:37:05.549 --> 07:37:08.631
Okay said everyone's understanding and they voted in a second.

07:37:09.331 --> 07:37:09.911
Okay.

07:37:10.912 --> 07:37:14.815
Thank you 347 to be exact but who's counting who's counting?

07:37:14.835 --> 07:37:16.676
All right, are we?

07:37:18.584 --> 07:37:19.344
Yes, Patricia.

07:37:19.364 --> 07:37:27.827
I need to be clear of the two edits that were recommended by Board Member Patil-Brownson.

07:37:28.388 --> 07:37:37.911
The first one was the edit that she spoke to concerning the change in Chapter 5 in the grade span for 4th through 6th grade.

07:37:38.111 --> 07:37:39.112
So it's Chapter 4.

07:37:39.292 --> 07:37:39.612
Chapter 4.

07:37:39.672 --> 07:37:41.372
Grades 4 through 6 on page 62.

07:37:41.873 --> 07:37:45.454
To take out the two words, is introduced.

07:37:46.966 --> 07:37:56.673
And so the sentence would read, when the topic of masturbation arises, teachers explain what masturbation is and that it is safe and not mentally or physically harmful.

07:37:56.933 --> 07:38:00.415
So it's actually is introduced or that would be removed.

07:38:00.835 --> 07:38:04.558
And you're saying that that's a technical change and it doesn't require emotion?

07:38:04.818 --> 07:38:05.519
That correct.

07:38:05.560 --> 07:38:08.305
That is approval of final revisions requested by the state board.

07:38:08.325 --> 07:38:09.988
It's been requested by the state board.

07:38:10.409 --> 07:38:12.052
So that is included in the motion.

07:38:12.132 --> 07:38:12.472
Okay.

07:38:12.693 --> 07:38:17.482
And then the second change that was requested was in which chapter?

07:38:24.039 --> 07:38:27.800
and that I was inviting discussion on for people who are middle school experts.

07:38:27.820 --> 07:38:30.441
And this was line 811 at the bottom of page 29.

07:38:31.361 --> 07:38:31.821
Correct.

07:38:32.082 --> 07:38:32.422
OK.

07:38:32.542 --> 07:38:33.862
And there was no revision.

07:38:33.882 --> 07:38:35.563
That's also a technical change?

07:38:35.583 --> 07:38:37.383
No, there's been no revision for that.

07:38:37.603 --> 07:38:37.923
OK.

07:38:38.904 --> 07:38:42.265
So we only have the one revision requested by the state board.

07:38:42.325 --> 07:38:48.907
And I'm just leaving a moment to see if everybody's content with where we are with any requested revisions.

07:38:50.265 --> 07:38:50.945
Any others?

07:38:51.206 --> 07:38:51.606
OK.

07:38:51.646 --> 07:39:00.731
So I think we're unless anybody wants to take that up, we'll leave things as is based on the responses.

07:39:00.791 --> 07:39:02.192
Matt, do you feel comfortable?

07:39:03.333 --> 07:39:03.633
All right.

07:39:04.633 --> 07:39:04.913
All right.

07:39:05.514 --> 07:39:05.774
All right.

07:39:05.834 --> 07:39:12.558
I think we have concluded this item and I think we can leave for the day.

07:39:12.598 --> 07:39:13.999
We're not adjourning because we are.

07:39:15.580 --> 07:39:16.160
Oh, we have to vote.

07:39:17.281 --> 07:39:17.802
No, we voted.

07:39:18.002 --> 07:39:18.402
We voted.

07:39:18.422 --> 07:39:19.343
You voted.

07:39:19.363 --> 07:39:20.064
Okay.

07:39:20.825 --> 07:39:21.246
You're good.

07:39:21.266 --> 07:39:23.688
We have to applaud the vote.

07:39:24.890 --> 07:39:27.032
We need to continue the meeting for closed session.

07:39:28.614 --> 07:39:28.975
Okay.

07:39:30.439 --> 07:39:32.101
I will, yes, I was about to say that.

07:39:32.221 --> 07:39:34.603
It will be continued at 8.30 tomorrow morning.

07:39:34.623 --> 07:39:38.206
I was about to say it before I was interrupted to be told to say it.

07:39:38.987 --> 07:39:42.370
Excuse me, the meeting will be continued at 8.30 tomorrow morning.

07:39:42.410 --> 07:39:51.198
We know all of you will want to join us and the board will be meeting in closed session at that time to discuss or take action on the following case, Thrive Public Schools versus SPE.

07:39:52.700 --> 07:39:53.000
All right.
