00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
Everyone's present.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.360
We have a quorum.

00:45.360 --> 00:49.960
All right, we'll start by just announcing that in closed session, the board discussed

00:49.960 --> 00:55.800
or took action on the following legal matters, E.E. et al. Disability Rights Education and

00:55.800 --> 01:00.760
Defense Fund versus State and related U.S. Department of Justice Complaint and Office

01:00.760 --> 01:02.760
of Administrative Affairs.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.760
We will now begin the quorum.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.760
Thank you.

01:05.760 --> 01:10.760
All right, we'll start by just announcing that in closed session, the board discussed

01:11.760 --> 01:17.440
and related U.S. Department of Justice Complaint and Office of Administrative Hearings Complaints

01:17.440 --> 01:22.680
and Californians for Equal Rights Foundation et al. versus State.

01:22.680 --> 01:29.280
As we get ready for the work of the day, I want to remind the members of the public who

01:29.280 --> 01:33.640
are wishing to dial in for public comment that they should view the live stream of the

01:33.640 --> 01:39.160
meeting to know at what time we'll ask for public comment on each item on the agenda.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.760
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number and participant access code

01:43.760 --> 01:47.240
and then following each of the operator's prompts.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.560
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.960
The operator will notify callers when it's their turn to provide public comment and will

01:54.960 --> 01:59.820
also ask the public calling in for public comment to please turn down the speaker volume

01:59.820 --> 02:04.960
of their computers if you're following the live feed to avoid an echoing effect.

02:04.960 --> 02:09.520
The public comment is limited to one minute per speaker per item.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.920
And board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.520
Keep your cameras on as much as possible to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout

02:17.520 --> 02:19.440
today's virtual meeting.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.640
For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand

02:23.640 --> 02:29.080
using the Zoom participant window if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.700
And we're going to start the day with item 17, which is the California Community Schools

02:34.700 --> 02:41.240
Partnership Program proposed application process and administration plan.

02:41.240 --> 02:46.440
And the CDE recommends that the California State Board approve the partnership program

02:46.440 --> 02:50.080
proposed application process and administration plan.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.920
Before I turn it over to my department colleagues, I'd just like to express my excitement about

02:54.920 --> 02:56.840
this item.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.280
We've begun to see already that community schools can truly be a reconception of how

03:02.280 --> 03:06.600
we see and partner with and serve students and their families.

03:06.600 --> 03:12.640
They can embody the whole child approach to education as they require collaborative partnerships

03:12.640 --> 03:18.320
between education, health and social services, community-based partners to provide integrated

03:18.320 --> 03:24.120
health and mental health and social services alongside high quality supportive education.

03:24.160 --> 03:29.960
The size of this year's budget, close to 3 billion, can mean transformative change

03:29.960 --> 03:36.160
to the way we serve our highest needs schools, particularly those serving 80% or more of

03:36.160 --> 03:38.560
our highest needs students.

03:38.560 --> 03:45.640
And I just want to be sure that as we work on this agenda together that as every school

03:45.640 --> 03:50.960
is on its way to becoming a community school, our goal here is to meet schools where they're

03:51.000 --> 03:56.760
at and provide support over the full seven years of this program to help students, families

03:56.760 --> 04:04.080
and educators recover from the impact of the pandemic, to address long standings, inequalities

04:04.080 --> 04:09.760
and also to transform schools so that every aspect of the school is supportive to students

04:09.760 --> 04:15.280
in the classroom, in the hallways, in all of the parts of the school as well as in the

04:15.280 --> 04:17.760
services that may wrap around students.

04:17.920 --> 04:23.320
Because we have a lot of other programs coming down the pike, mental health funding, funding

04:23.320 --> 04:27.400
for before and after school, funding for TK.

04:27.400 --> 04:31.920
One of the things we want to help schools do is integrate those services in a productive

04:31.920 --> 04:38.760
way to get the maximum benefit of this support for their students and families.

04:38.760 --> 04:45.440
So the item will be presented by Lisa Borrego, Pete Callis, Steve Zimmer, Indiana Niebuhr

04:45.520 --> 04:50.400
of the CDE, Dr. Daniel Lee will be available for questions and we're going to start with

04:50.400 --> 04:53.200
an introduction from our state superintendent.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.560
Tony, take it away.

04:55.560 --> 05:01.640
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and good morning to you, President Darling-Hammond and to Vice

05:01.640 --> 05:04.720
President Strauss and to the members of the board.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.920
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to add just a few framing remarks about the California

05:08.920 --> 05:11.560
Schools Partnership Program.

05:11.600 --> 05:17.160
I can tell you that there is incredible interest all across the state in this community schools

05:17.160 --> 05:23.680
grant and I want to thank the board liaisons who have participated in robust and spirited

05:23.680 --> 05:29.040
conversation about how to create this wonderful opportunity and to implement it.

05:29.040 --> 05:34.200
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and thank you, Dr. Escobedo and your roles as board liaisons.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.600
I wanted to, as Dr. Darling-Hammond said, this is about just under three billion dollars

05:39.920 --> 05:45.840
of what many call wraparound supports, health, mental health, social services to recognize

05:45.840 --> 05:50.320
that students, you know, dealing in the pandemic, that there is trauma that needs to be addressed,

05:50.320 --> 05:56.480
but also recognizing that even before the pandemic we use community schools to assist

05:56.480 --> 06:00.800
students. When a student is hungry, they're experiencing toothache, they have a counseling

06:00.800 --> 06:05.120
need, they can still learn, but these things become barriers to their learning.

06:05.200 --> 06:11.600
Community schools provides a way to help address the wraparound support needs that will ultimately,

06:11.600 --> 06:16.240
once they are addressed, support student learning, but community schools are more than

06:16.240 --> 06:23.600
just wraparound supports. As Dr. Darling-Hammond noted, they provide transformative solutions

06:23.600 --> 06:30.160
for addressing systemic racism, for addressing the impacts of poverty, for helping to create

06:30.160 --> 06:35.760
a culture and a climate at schools that moves away from the school to prison pipeline, that moves

06:35.760 --> 06:41.920
away from criminalizing children, and when you link this strategy with things like universal meals,

06:41.920 --> 06:46.560
universal tk, you know, the kinds of professional development and recruitment that we have for

06:46.560 --> 06:53.120
teachers and diversifying our teacher force and our staff at schools, we are facing a wonderful

06:53.120 --> 06:58.880
moment of creating transformation for California schools, for addressing the needs for mental

06:58.880 --> 07:04.400
health and social-emotional learning, for addressing needs to close learning gaps, and for, again,

07:04.400 --> 07:08.880
creating transformative communities. I want to share with you that today I'm coming to you from

07:08.880 --> 07:16.640
Betty Reed Soskin Middle School. Betty Reed Soskin is America's oldest park ranger. She is 100 years

07:16.640 --> 07:23.760
old. She lives and works in the city of Richmond. We had the opportunity to do a ribbon cutting and

07:23.760 --> 07:29.680
renaming ceremony for her that she attended this year, and she is an incredible role model

07:29.680 --> 07:36.320
for our students about the importance of education. She's been someone that we've been able to name

07:36.320 --> 07:42.720
as a spokesperson for California schools and California education. This school also has a

07:42.720 --> 07:48.080
wonderful community schools program led by the incredible community schools coordinator,

07:48.640 --> 07:54.240
Ms. Mitchell or Ms. Kenitra, as the students call her, and the principal, Guthrie Fleischman,

07:54.240 --> 08:01.360
under the leadership of the superintendent of West Contra Costa Unified School District, Dr. Hurst,

08:01.360 --> 08:06.880
a fabulous district with a fabulous board, and to share, it's the place where I first learned the

08:06.880 --> 08:12.000
words community schools many, many years ago, and I had the honor as a former school board member in

08:12.000 --> 08:18.240
this district to be able to help to pass a resolution that said we'd have community schools,

08:18.240 --> 08:22.720
we'd become a full service community schools district. Dr. Darling-Hammond will remember

08:22.720 --> 08:27.600
that lots of times districts would say those words, but they didn't always have the resources

08:27.600 --> 08:34.560
to really become a full service community school district, and now we do. Item 17 will do that,

08:34.560 --> 08:40.000
and our staff will talk about the kinds of investments that will come for our students,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.720
and I have to say that while the state is currently implementing its first round of

08:44.720 --> 08:51.280
community schools grants, it was schools like Betty Reed Soskin and schools in San Francisco

08:51.280 --> 08:56.720
Unified School District where we got help to design what we're implementing now, and we will

08:56.720 --> 09:03.440
continue to do that. In short order, I'll be naming a kind of steering committee or advisory council

09:03.440 --> 09:09.360
that will inform the entire process about community schools. This council won't make decisions

09:09.360 --> 09:14.640
about who gets a grant, but it will help us to think through all kinds of things like when we

09:14.640 --> 09:20.160
say community schools, what do we really mean? How do we create a framework that is broad for what

09:20.160 --> 09:24.400
schools can think about when they think about a community school and what a community school

09:24.400 --> 09:30.560
will do? Today you will hear the elements of the grant program and how we intend to implement it

09:30.560 --> 09:36.800
and the timeline that will come with that. That will include many key components such as technical

09:36.800 --> 09:42.240
assistance to schools that would like to have a community schools program and technical assistance

09:42.240 --> 09:48.720
to those that already do have a community schools program. And so we invite you to share your thoughts

09:48.720 --> 09:54.320
about how we can improve and enhance the plan. We look forward to whatever direction and guidance

09:54.320 --> 10:01.200
that you provide. You will hear from excellent staff who are versed, deeply versed in the community

10:01.200 --> 10:08.560
schools movement. Like Lisa Borrego who you know as our director of family engagement at the

10:08.560 --> 10:13.680
Department of Education who's worked on community schools and similar programs in her time

10:14.640 --> 10:19.440
working directly in school districts. You'll hear from Dr. Daniel Lee who oversees the entire

10:19.440 --> 10:25.360
effort. You'll hear from Pete Callis from our college and career transitions division who

10:25.360 --> 10:30.960
will talk to you about some of the nuts and bolts of this grant rollout. He'll also talk to you

10:30.960 --> 10:35.840
about some highlights from the current grant. He can talk to you about the evaluation that is to take

10:35.840 --> 10:41.280
place of the current initiative. He can answer any questions that you have. And then there's some

10:41.280 --> 10:46.400
folks I want to reintroduce you to who you've probably met or heard about who've joined us

10:46.400 --> 10:52.960
through the CDE Foundation. And I want to thank folks like Aaron Hiron and Susan Harvey who were

10:52.960 --> 10:58.160
previously with the Bechtel Foundation who've really given us resources to bring on some

10:58.160 --> 11:03.920
additional staff partners to help in coordination of this strategy. You'll hear from Steve Zimmer

11:03.920 --> 11:09.840
who's joined us in a role as Deputy Superintendent who himself has worked on community schools

11:09.840 --> 11:14.640
during his time serving as a former school board member for Los Angeles Unified School District

11:14.640 --> 11:19.280
and as a former teacher and counselor. You'll hear from Diana Nieper, someone who's considered an

11:19.280 --> 11:24.240
expert on community schools who's worked on community schools for many many years and we're

11:24.320 --> 11:29.440
honored that she is now part of our team to work on this. I also just want to say a word of thanks

11:29.440 --> 11:34.320
to the entire Department of Education team and the entire State Board of Education team

11:34.320 --> 11:40.080
who have literally been meeting weekly, sometimes daily, to synchronize, to think through, to dream

11:40.080 --> 11:47.600
and plan. And it is at collaboration that has helped to create the materials that are before

11:47.600 --> 11:52.560
you today for the California Community Schools Partnership Program. So without further ado,

11:52.560 --> 11:56.720
I'm going to turn it over to our community schools team to take you through the elements

11:56.720 --> 12:04.640
of this proposal. Thank you. Well, good morning State Board President Darling Hammon,

12:04.640 --> 12:09.840
Vice President Strauss, State Board members, Superintendent Thurman, and Chief Deputy Nicely.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.760
Again, my name is Lisa Borrego and I am the Director of Family Engagement for the California

12:13.760 --> 12:20.240
Department of Education. I stand before you as a practitioner who was recently in the field less

12:20.240 --> 12:25.120
than a year ago and as I reviewed the community school board item that is being presented to you

12:25.120 --> 12:30.720
today, I was excited about what this opportunity means for students, schools, families, and

12:30.720 --> 12:35.920
communities all throughout California. I am particularly excited to see family and community

12:35.920 --> 12:40.960
engagement as a cornerstone of this work because what we've learned through the pandemic and have

12:40.960 --> 12:46.880
always known is partnership matters. Engaging with and learning from one another is an important part

12:46.880 --> 12:52.400
of community schools. I imagine a rural school district seeing this opportunity and thinking

12:52.400 --> 12:56.880
they can begin the planning process to bring their community together, talk about what they need,

12:56.880 --> 13:01.760
and build a plan to transform their school. I visualize school districts who already have

13:01.760 --> 13:06.320
community schools thinking about how this investment can help them continue the work,

13:06.320 --> 13:11.600
building bridges and strengthening partnerships between schools, programs, and organizations to

13:11.600 --> 13:17.280
provide what students, families, and communities need. It is their voices that breathe life into

13:17.280 --> 13:22.880
the hopes and dreams of an educational system that transforms a child's experience one community at

13:22.880 --> 13:28.960
a time. This is what community schools has an opportunity to do for our California's children.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.760
Today, our presentation is going to cover the application process,

13:36.640 --> 13:42.720
specifically the application process and administration plan, the community engagement

13:42.720 --> 13:47.520
plan, as well as the ongoing communication that will take place with the board.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.280
And with that, I would like to introduce Pete Callis.

13:51.280 --> 14:06.160
Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, President Darlene Hammond, State Board members,

14:06.160 --> 14:12.720
Superintendent Thurman, and Chief Deputy Nicely. I'm Pete Callis, Division Director over the Career

14:12.720 --> 14:17.280
and College Transition Division. I'm here to present the California Community Schools Partnership

14:17.280 --> 14:24.080
Program Application and Administration Plan. CDE recommends approval of the California Community

14:24.080 --> 14:31.440
Schools Partnership Program proposed application and process and application process and administration

14:31.440 --> 14:41.440
plan. The California Community Schools Initiative was kicked off in 2020 when CDE received 45 million

14:41.440 --> 14:46.640
dollars in federal funding to administer the California Community Schools Partnership Program

14:46.640 --> 14:53.920
for existing California community schools. Then the expansion of the California Community

14:53.920 --> 15:01.520
Schools Program continued when CDE received over 2.8 billion dollars in the 2021-22 state budget

15:01.520 --> 15:07.280
to expand on the California Community Schools Partnership Program for new and existing community

15:07.280 --> 15:13.200
schools. There is an additional 165 million dollars in state funding allocated for Community

15:13.200 --> 15:18.960
Schools Initiative. CDE is awaiting direction on the spending authority of these funds right now.

15:24.000 --> 15:30.560
The 2020 California Community Schools Partnership Program, RFA, was published in October of 2020.

15:30.560 --> 15:38.560
CDE received 102 applications. 20 LEAs were funded to support over 150 California community schools.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.600
CDE also contracted with WestEd to provide technical assistance

15:43.600 --> 15:47.120
and to develop a legislative report that is due in 2025.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.760
The 2021 California Community Schools Partnership Program funding will have multiple rounds of

15:55.760 --> 16:01.040
requests for applications for the three different types of grants and one round for regional

16:01.040 --> 16:06.640
technical assistance centers contracts. The overarching goal of the planning and implementation

16:06.640 --> 16:12.320
grants is to create the sustainability of the community school program after these grant funds

16:12.320 --> 16:20.800
have been exhausted. The RFA will be for planning grants up to $200,000 each of one-time funds.

16:21.600 --> 16:27.680
Implementation grants are up to $500,000 and based on conversations with legislative staff

16:27.680 --> 16:32.320
and the Department of Finance, there is a common understanding that this level of funding was

16:32.320 --> 16:38.960
intended to establish an annual maximum per school site when calculating implementation grants for

16:38.960 --> 16:46.080
the LEAs. Coordination grants of up to $100,000 annually are to coordinate sustainability of

16:46.080 --> 16:52.320
community school programs. And finally, regional technical assistance center contracts, RFAs,

16:52.320 --> 16:56.000
we will have a minimum of five awarded across the state.

16:56.800 --> 17:03.760
The application process and administration plan. Community input, visioning, and feedback processes

17:03.760 --> 17:09.120
beginning in the fall of 2021, which will inform the California Community Schools framework.

17:11.200 --> 17:17.120
CDE will host outreach and information sessions such as webinars for potential applicants beginning

17:17.120 --> 17:23.920
in late fall of 2021. There will be four separate RFAs, one for each of the four different types of

17:23.920 --> 17:36.080
funding opportunities. The California Community Schools Partnership Program Application Administration

17:36.080 --> 17:45.040
Plan schedule is as follows. Fall of 2021 through winter 2021-22, community forums and community

17:45.040 --> 17:53.440
input and feedback sessions will take place. RFAs will be published for winter 2021-22 for

17:53.440 --> 17:59.840
regional technical assistance centers. Their contracts will be processed in the fall of 2022.

18:00.720 --> 18:07.440
The first round of planning grant RFAs will be out in early spring of 2022 and they will be funded

18:07.440 --> 18:14.720
late spring of 2022. Implementation grant first round RFAs will be out in early spring and will

18:14.720 --> 18:20.960
also be funded in late spring of 2022. Funding for planning and implementation grants will be

18:20.960 --> 18:28.000
awarded in time for LEAs to incorporate into their 2022-23 budgets. Coordination grants will

18:28.000 --> 18:36.080
come later in the administration plan with round one being in 2024-25.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.160
As described previously, planning grants will be funded

18:42.800 --> 18:47.440
on a competitive basis at the LEA level to qualifying entities for up to two years.

18:48.160 --> 18:53.840
The implementation grants will be funded over multiple rounds. Per statute, CDE must set aside

18:53.840 --> 18:59.040
funds for planning grantees to receive a subsequent implementation grant for at least a five-year

18:59.040 --> 19:05.200
period. And finally, coordination grants are meant to help grantees step down from the support of

19:05.200 --> 19:10.160
the grant funds. They are scheduled to be released later in the seven-year program period.

19:10.960 --> 19:16.240
Now to eligibility, grant eligibility. The eligibility requirements are the same for all

19:16.240 --> 19:22.320
three grant opportunities. The detailed grant eligibility requirements are on page 11 of board

19:22.320 --> 19:29.600
item 17. The main eligibility requirement threshold is that at least 50% of enrolled pupils

19:29.600 --> 19:32.240
are unduplicated at the LEA level.

19:40.160 --> 19:48.400
While LEAs will be the ultimate recipients, other eligible applicants include a consortium of schools.

19:48.400 --> 19:54.400
A single school that satisfies the minimum thresholds for LEAs can make an LEA eligible,

19:55.200 --> 20:00.160
along with county and governmental agencies that will operate the community schools program

20:00.160 --> 20:05.200
in partnership with at least one LEA that is a qualifying entity.

20:10.880 --> 20:19.280
The competitive priorities for the grant opportunities include, there are multiple

20:19.280 --> 20:23.840
competitive priorities that are the same for all three of the grant opportunities. The competitive

20:23.840 --> 20:31.280
priorities details can be found on pages 12 and 13 of board item 17. One of the main competitive

20:31.280 --> 20:37.440
priorities is that at least 80% of the student population at schools in an LEA are eligible for

20:37.440 --> 20:49.360
free and reduced priced meals. Accountability measures for the community schools program include

20:50.000 --> 20:54.960
student level measures, including student and family engagement levels. There are also program

20:54.960 --> 20:59.360
level measures, which is establishment and the expansion of their community partnerships.

21:00.960 --> 21:06.720
Per statute, all grant recipients must commit to providing data as specified by CDE and

21:06.720 --> 21:14.480
participate in the overall program evaluation, which will support CDE reporting in 2025 and 2027.

21:15.360 --> 21:20.960
There are more details on the accountability measures on page 13 of board item number 17.

21:25.280 --> 21:29.440
For the technical, regional technical assistance centers, CDE must fund a minimum

21:29.440 --> 21:35.120
of five of the, as we call them, our tax center contracts. The awardees will be funded on a

21:35.120 --> 21:40.160
competitive basis. Regional technical assistance centers will be contracted for seven years

21:40.720 --> 21:46.000
and required to be renewed annually. Regional technical assistance centers will assist

21:46.000 --> 21:50.480
successfully funded planning grantees and implementation grantees with all of their

21:50.480 --> 21:56.480
community school activities, including but not limited to conducting a comprehensive needs and

21:56.480 --> 22:02.560
asset assessment, creating their community partnerships, creating funding sources for

22:02.560 --> 22:06.960
sustainability of their community school programs, which will include

22:06.960 --> 22:11.520
braided funding opportunities that are at LEAs currently.

22:18.880 --> 22:24.480
The eligibility requirements for the regional technical assistance centers include they must

22:24.480 --> 22:30.560
have an existing community schools department or office, the capacity to provide technical

22:30.560 --> 22:35.600
assistance to the planning grantees and implementation grantees, the ability to provide

22:35.600 --> 22:41.360
curriculum and professional development, and the capacity to monitor community school grantees,

22:41.360 --> 22:46.080
including collecting data and creating the required reports to CDE.

22:50.560 --> 22:57.040
For the R tax, the expected outcomes are similar to their competitive requirements in their RFA.

22:57.680 --> 23:03.440
CDE will provide guidance to the R tax to meet the required outcomes, comprehensive needs and

23:03.440 --> 23:09.840
assets assessment, creating community partnerships, and creating funding sources for the sustainability

23:09.840 --> 23:13.520
of the programs after grant funds have been exhausted.

23:17.600 --> 23:23.120
Including in board item 17 is an attachment that provides a visual of the seven-year breakdown of

23:23.200 --> 23:26.720
the California Community Schools Partnership Program Administration Plan.

23:30.960 --> 23:37.600
So this is an overview of the entire plan that will guide our work in getting the funding out

23:37.600 --> 23:43.920
and selecting the grantees for all of the three grant opportunities along with the contracts for

23:43.920 --> 23:49.760
the regional technical assistance centers. I would now like to pass the presentation

23:49.760 --> 23:53.200
on to my esteemed colleague, Deputy Superintendent Steve Zimmer,

23:53.200 --> 23:58.080
to provide information on community engagement for the California Community Schools Partnership

23:58.080 --> 24:10.000
Program. Thank you. Thank you, Pete, and good morning to everyone. I appreciate and honored

24:10.880 --> 24:15.360
to have the chance to speak with you about our community engagement process.

24:16.320 --> 24:26.400
Our goal as the CDE team is to provide a process and to implement an engagement process

24:27.360 --> 24:35.760
that meets and honors really the depth of what the potential transformation could be

24:36.400 --> 24:43.840
with this community schools investment. So our purpose in this engagement process is to create

24:43.840 --> 24:51.120
a shared framework which supports our aspirations in California for school transformation

24:51.680 --> 24:59.520
and really elevates a California model for community schools. We also through the engagement

24:59.520 --> 25:07.680
process want to build a full understanding of the type of TA that will be needed to really build

25:07.680 --> 25:15.040
a technical assistance infrastructure that will assist both districts and schools on the ground

25:15.040 --> 25:21.520
for implementation. And finally, we want to make sure that we are creating an application process

25:22.320 --> 25:30.720
that is accessible and realistic for small districts and small and rural LEAs,

25:31.440 --> 25:37.440
but also throughout the state recognizing and considering what our schools have been through

25:38.080 --> 25:45.280
during the pandemic, the pressures that are on LEAs, and making sure that we're creating a process

25:46.240 --> 25:53.120
that really is aligned with the community schools vision. Next slide, please.

25:56.800 --> 26:02.800
There are five elements to this community engagement process, and within these elements,

26:02.800 --> 26:12.720
we're going to use multiple strategies to gather input, feedback, ideas, and aspirations from a

26:12.720 --> 26:22.000
broad set of partners. We're going to hold regional forums throughout the state to really make sure

26:22.000 --> 26:32.080
we're hearing the voices from across all of the different terrains of public education in the

26:32.080 --> 26:41.680
state of California. We are also going to visit school sites and hold listening sessions from

26:44.400 --> 26:55.600
the initial pilot schools in the 2020 pilot that Pete referenced. We're going to visit the schools,

26:55.600 --> 26:59.520
we're going to hear from students, we're going to hear from families, we're going to hear from

26:59.520 --> 27:05.680
community school coordinators, like the community school coordinator in West Contra Costa that

27:05.680 --> 27:12.160
Superintendent Thurmond referenced, also hear from educators and practitioners. We are also

27:12.160 --> 27:17.600
going to hold listening sessions with the leadership of these LEAs who have experienced

27:17.600 --> 27:23.600
the implementation of these pilot grants. We're going to hold and have already begun to hold

27:23.600 --> 27:30.080
meetings with statewide advocacy groups, groups that represent parents, groups that represent

27:30.080 --> 27:37.280
students, civil rights groups, activists and advocates, community school experts,

27:37.920 --> 27:44.800
but also groups that represent our labor partners and represent the folks on the ground who will be

27:44.800 --> 27:50.640
implementing the plan that we developed. We're also going to make sure that we're meeting with

27:50.640 --> 27:57.360
advocacy groups to be fully inclusive, so groups that include our earliest learners,

27:58.400 --> 28:07.840
our students with special needs, and our multilingual learners. Finally, we know that

28:07.840 --> 28:15.520
our best outreach efforts are not necessarily going to reach everyone, so we're going to create

28:15.520 --> 28:22.320
time, what we're calling office hours, where we can respond to folks who reach out to

28:23.040 --> 28:30.880
CDE through this process, but also have time to set up additional meetings with partners and with

28:32.560 --> 28:39.120
folks on the ground across the state who have strong feelings about how we can make our vision

28:39.120 --> 28:44.960
for community schools a transformational reality on the ground for students in the

28:44.960 --> 28:52.960
state of California. If we could go to the next slide. I just wanted to expand a little bit on

28:54.160 --> 29:02.400
superintendent's introductory comments. The superintendent will be appointing an advisory

29:02.400 --> 29:08.320
council comprised of constituents. I will include, not necessarily be limited to,

29:09.040 --> 29:16.720
advocates, practitioners, educators, students, families, and community members. And superintendent

29:16.720 --> 29:23.760
will also delineate the process for selecting the members, the terms and the scope of the work of

29:23.760 --> 29:30.480
this advisory council, and this will be based in part on our engagement process and what we're

29:30.480 --> 29:39.920
hearing about best practices. And so we will be updating on the board in the spring on both the

29:39.920 --> 29:46.640
engagement process and the establishment of this advisory council. And with that, I'm going to

29:46.640 --> 29:52.240
turn it over to my esteemed colleague, Deanna Nieberg, who will take us through our next steps.

29:52.240 --> 30:02.800
Thank you, Steve. The CDE team values and acknowledges that ongoing communication with

30:02.800 --> 30:08.160
the board will be critical to the successful development and implementation of the California

30:08.160 --> 30:14.080
Community Schools Partnership Program. Specifically, some elements that will be covered in updates and

30:14.080 --> 30:20.880
ongoing communications include the framework, then also the information sharing and outreach

30:20.880 --> 30:27.040
process to encourage grant applications. Considerations here will include outreach that

30:27.040 --> 30:34.560
helps all LEAs get started early in planning to apply and also reaches their community partners,

30:36.080 --> 30:39.600
targeted outreach to small and rural LEAs, as Steve mentioned,

30:40.240 --> 30:47.200
and targeted outreach to potential co-applicants such as early learning programs. Next, the

30:47.200 --> 30:52.000
accessibility of the application process in general and making sure that the application

30:52.000 --> 31:00.800
process is doable for LEAs. Also, grant allocations, including considerations of grant size

31:01.440 --> 31:07.520
based on school and consortium size and stage of development of the initiatives in the applications.

31:08.480 --> 31:15.680
Also, considering the potential adjustments to the overall timeline based on the number of

31:15.680 --> 31:21.680
applicants and grants made in the different rounds. Next, the system for accountability,

31:22.240 --> 31:27.360
including considerations of both near and long-term student and program outcomes,

31:28.080 --> 31:35.040
how accountability measures lend themselves and link to continuous improvement, and what does the

31:35.040 --> 31:41.600
map for the development for developmental progress look like, and then how this link

31:41.600 --> 31:46.320
between outcome measures and continuous improvement is supported through the technical

31:46.320 --> 31:53.760
assistance provided. Finally, the TA system itself, including its content, infrastructure,

31:53.760 --> 32:01.440
and function. Considerations in building the TA content will include linking to the other

32:01.440 --> 32:08.720
major divisions and work in CDE itself and connecting to other major initiatives like

32:08.720 --> 32:14.000
the build out of the school-based mental health systems through the mental health student services

32:14.000 --> 32:25.040
grants. Also, the work to enhance local systems of care for foster youth and others. Finally,

32:25.040 --> 32:31.360
looking to sustainability, improvements, and know-how regarding to the school-based

32:32.320 --> 32:37.920
Medi-Cal funding streams, as well as Medi-Cal funded mental health programs.

32:42.480 --> 32:47.600
This comprehensive TA system will be built out of the broad engagement and input process

32:47.600 --> 32:53.360
and ongoing communication between CDE and the board. With that, I'll pass it back to Pete Keles.

33:02.080 --> 33:06.720
Thank you, Deanna. This brings us back to the recommendation for the California Community

33:06.720 --> 33:11.520
Schools Partnership Program. The California Department of Education recommends approval of

33:11.520 --> 33:16.240
the California Community Schools Partnership Program proposed application process and

33:16.240 --> 33:20.560
administration plan, which includes the grant request for application timeline,

33:21.280 --> 33:26.880
the regional technical assistance center request for application timeline, and contract eligibility

33:26.880 --> 33:31.200
and requirements, along with the broad community engagement and listening process.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.600
I'd now like to pass it back to President Darlene Hammond.

33:44.800 --> 33:52.240
Take myself off of mute. Thank you so much. Lots here for us to think about and discuss. We've got

33:52.240 --> 33:59.040
the phone line open for public comment. I want to note that members of the public wishing to

33:59.040 --> 34:04.960
provide comment may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the

34:04.960 --> 34:10.080
slide that is shown now. And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to

34:10.080 --> 34:19.440
ask Member Escobedo if he has any initial comments before me. Yes, what an amazing working group we

34:19.440 --> 34:27.600
had. Everyone passionate for this concept of community schools, and definitely we know the

34:27.600 --> 34:34.720
urgency of it, right? I mean, we heard yesterday one of our students, Alicia, reported that over

34:34.720 --> 34:43.120
30% of our students with trauma have come into our school needing assistance. And we wish we

34:43.120 --> 34:49.840
could apply this yesterday, right, in many of our school systems, but we want to get this right,

34:49.840 --> 34:57.520
right? So this plan of creating a group to look at the creative framework to ensure

34:58.400 --> 35:07.200
this is done right. Why? Because we want this to be sustainable over time beyond the eight years,

35:07.840 --> 35:14.160
and we definitely want to maximize the investment we're putting in for the lives of our students,

35:14.160 --> 35:20.480
but that's what we're doing. This has, like you heard before, the potential to transform

35:21.360 --> 35:28.480
the lives of many of our students and have a direct effect on ensuring that we can maximize

35:29.040 --> 35:37.520
the academic potential for every student in California as well. So I look forward to the

35:37.520 --> 35:44.960
discussion, to hear the public comments, to be hopefully part of the listening forum in one venue

35:44.960 --> 35:53.520
or another, because we want to get this right. And I appreciate also that continual improvement

35:53.520 --> 36:02.640
process that we incorporated in this plan, the technical assistance. So again, that integrated

36:02.640 --> 36:14.800
approach is crucial, and I know we're going to have probably a construct, we'll create a construct

36:14.800 --> 36:25.920
that will be, how could I say, what other states will be looking at. It will be a great case study

36:25.920 --> 36:33.920
in the future. Yes, I'll just sort of add on and say the team at the department has been working

36:33.920 --> 36:41.760
intensely on this very complex process, as you can see, has many, many components and moving parts

36:41.760 --> 36:51.680
and a great sense of urgency to get the RFAs out in the early part, early in the calendar year,

36:52.400 --> 37:02.160
so that by the end of the semester, we'll have places of knowing that they have planning grants

37:02.160 --> 37:08.640
to get going. And in the cases of places that are already up and running with community schools

37:08.640 --> 37:13.600
implementation grants to expand the work that they're doing. So it's a tremendous amount. I'm

37:13.600 --> 37:20.160
looking forward to the framework that will come in January at our next meeting. The law is really

37:21.520 --> 37:27.200
clear that this is a very holistic approach, that community schools are not just places that add a

37:27.200 --> 37:33.520
health clinic on the side, but that they have restorative practices, social and emotional

37:33.520 --> 37:40.400
learning and supports that every aspect of the school is supportive to the students in it. And

37:40.400 --> 37:48.000
so we'll need to really work through a lot of technical assistance and supports for schools to,

37:49.120 --> 37:57.120
as Francisco said, to be really in a ongoing continuous improvement framework for transformation

37:58.480 --> 38:02.800
in the lives of the children and the families that they serve. So it's an exciting initiative.

38:04.240 --> 38:09.520
Talent that has been brought into the department and the talent that was already in the department

38:09.520 --> 38:18.400
coming together in a very active, well-integrated team to do this work is inspiring, I think,

38:18.400 --> 38:24.720
and we're grateful to them for all that they've already done and will do. And with that, I think

38:24.720 --> 38:30.400
we want to open the, well, let me see if there are any clarification questions from the board,

38:30.400 --> 38:34.800
just clarification questions, because we'll come back for discussion after public comment.

38:36.240 --> 38:47.520
And let me, I see a hand up from Member Glover Woods and one from Member Burr. Member Glover Woods.

38:49.680 --> 38:59.040
Good morning again. Would you please, for the CDE staff, clarify the timeframe for the selection

38:59.040 --> 39:05.520
of the regional, the technical assistance centers, the regional technical assistance centers,

39:05.520 --> 39:12.000
and the timeframe for the selection of the first round of planning grant recipients?

39:17.520 --> 39:26.160
So our goal is to get the RFAs out in very early spring, late winter, and get through that process

39:26.160 --> 39:32.800
as quickly as we can to get the funding out to the planning grantees prior to their planning

39:32.800 --> 39:40.000
of their 2022-23 budget. The contracts for the regional technical assistance centers are a little

39:40.000 --> 39:45.040
bit different. We can make the selections, but then we have to go through the contracting process

39:45.040 --> 39:50.320
that we have built into the state, so it'll take a little bit more time for that. That's why we said

39:50.320 --> 39:58.960
probably fall of 2022. Okay, so just to clarify, the first round of planning grant recipients would

39:58.960 --> 40:07.520
know their selection prior to the regional technical assistance centers being identified

40:07.520 --> 40:15.520
and established. It might be identified, but maybe not established. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

40:15.520 --> 40:18.560
Thank you. Member Burr.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.000
Member Burr, I believe you're on mute.

40:31.040 --> 40:38.720
So articulate, too. I'm trying to clarify sort of the overall objective. I want to make sure

40:38.720 --> 40:44.320
I'm clear about it over the lifespan of the program. Is it that every school in California

40:44.320 --> 40:49.200
would ultimately become a community school? That's question one, and then the second one

40:49.200 --> 40:50.800
follows the answer to that one.

40:54.880 --> 41:00.640
I think the intent of the funding, we should say, is to support California schools that serve

41:00.640 --> 41:08.560
student populations with the greatest need. So we're looking at sufficient funding to reach

41:08.560 --> 41:14.240
all schools with 80% or greater free and reduced-price meal or unduplicated counts

41:14.240 --> 41:20.560
with grant support. But I think it's important to think of the community school's approach

41:21.200 --> 41:27.120
and the TA that will be provided that we're building the capacity of school districts

41:27.120 --> 41:33.520
to behave in these ways. And so at some point, we should be able to support districts to build

41:33.520 --> 41:40.480
community school initiatives and add schools to their initiatives, not necessarily with grant

41:40.480 --> 41:47.200
support in the future. Okay. And you sort of touched on my second question. I'm just a little

41:47.200 --> 41:54.080
bit confused about the different terms and percentages that are being used. At one point,

41:54.080 --> 42:00.640
it talks about 50% unduplicated. And for purposes of our general public, it would be helpful,

42:00.640 --> 42:08.400
I think, to clarify what unduplicated means. And secondly, then we talked about 80% or greater

42:08.400 --> 42:14.400
high poverty. So how do those two things intersect for purposes of eligibility?

42:15.200 --> 42:20.160
And I think this is partly to go into the question of how the district eligibility

42:20.160 --> 42:25.440
is defined and how school eligibility is defined. Deanna?

42:26.080 --> 42:34.240
Yeah. Well, so on the eligibility of applicants, it's 50% or greater unduplicated counts

42:34.800 --> 42:43.040
for the LEA itself. That's a floor to become eligible to apply. And then the 80% is an

42:43.040 --> 42:50.880
aspirational competitive priority on the school level. So I come in as an LEA to apply and show

42:50.880 --> 42:56.880
the schools that I'm applying for. And that's where the 80% comes in, to give me a competitive

42:56.880 --> 43:05.520
priority. Okay. And again, can you, for purposes of folks who don't know what the term unduplicated

43:05.520 --> 43:11.360
means, clarify that? What are we talking about? That's a term from LCFF?

43:11.520 --> 43:21.680
Yeah. So it's the low-income students, English learners, foster care. And do we have another one?

43:21.680 --> 43:26.160
Homeless is not part of that count. Okay. And it's unduplicated because you don't get counted twice

43:26.160 --> 43:35.200
if you're in one of those three categories. Member McQuillan, you have a clarifying question?

43:35.680 --> 43:37.920
Member McQuillan, you have a clarifying question?

43:38.560 --> 43:44.320
Yes. Thank you. And this is so exciting. I appreciate the presentation and

43:45.840 --> 43:50.240
this opportunity to help our most vulnerable students throughout the state of California.

43:50.880 --> 43:57.600
But my question is, Steve and others have mentioned that rural and remote areas will have

43:57.680 --> 44:04.320
access to the application. But are there any other assurances that our

44:05.040 --> 44:12.320
rural districts will have a fair share of these resources? Thank you.

44:15.040 --> 44:22.400
I think like we stated before, with outreach and also as we create the details of the application

44:22.400 --> 44:28.960
process, we have those rural and small schools in mind. And I think in legislation, it's why you

44:28.960 --> 44:38.000
got that 50% number. The year before, 80% was that goal, was the threshold. And the 50% gets you

44:40.320 --> 44:48.240
a broader applicant pool. So for outreach, but also the application process itself,

44:48.240 --> 44:52.640
we have in mind the small and rural school districts, absolutely.

44:54.640 --> 44:58.880
And probably worth mentioning something about the fact that counties are eligible

44:59.440 --> 45:08.400
entities also. Yeah, and that in the rural situation, it can be the county office of ed

45:08.960 --> 45:16.400
that would be the lead entity that would help with that deep coordination and the administration

45:16.400 --> 45:27.360
of the program and would be a sensible applicant. I don't see any other clarifying questions

45:27.360 --> 45:31.680
being raised at this moment. So we'll go to public comment and then we'll come back for board

45:31.680 --> 45:41.840
discussion. Hello, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

45:41.840 --> 45:53.680
Your time begins now. I'm not sure if I'm the caller for the public comment. You are the caller.

45:56.640 --> 46:03.440
Good morning. My name is Terry. I'm an enrolled member of the group tribe in Northern California

46:03.440 --> 46:09.120
and executive director of the True North Organizing Network. A member of PICO California's Ed

46:09.920 --> 46:14.320
California Partnership for the Future of Learning. We have worked in a regional community partnership

46:14.320 --> 46:20.000
with Mr. Jim Aquila and the Iraq tribe and 15 other community partners to create a Department

46:20.000 --> 46:26.720
of Education, U.S. Department of Education, Promise Neighborhoods program. We eventually hope to serve

46:27.600 --> 46:35.360
public schools throughout humble Del Norton tribal land. Two comments. One, we are

46:35.360 --> 46:43.760
strongly in support of this historic community schools partnership. It is astounding and that

46:43.760 --> 46:52.480
gets to the second part of our concern and our comment, which is time. We've heard many members

46:52.480 --> 47:00.720
talk about wanting to get this right and we encourage you to not set February as the date

47:01.280 --> 47:05.600
of your framework. I think we got it in. Thank you.

47:11.840 --> 47:16.240
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

47:16.240 --> 47:23.600
Your time begins now. Hello. My name is Michael Juba and I am a classroom teacher representing CTA.

47:24.560 --> 47:30.880
CTA recommends that one, the advisory council be convened immediately to support the CDE's

47:30.880 --> 47:37.680
efforts from the start. Two, that the CDE addresses the reality of the support gap

47:37.680 --> 47:45.760
as the program is starting off. Three, the SBE and CDE work with the legislature and the governor's

47:45.760 --> 47:53.840
office to address the limit of $500,000 per qualifying entity. Four, the RFAs provide

47:53.840 --> 47:58.480
preference points for the creation of a district steering committee as well as a dedicated

47:58.480 --> 48:06.160
community schools coordinator. And five, that the CDE focus their TA center, RFA, on the five

48:06.160 --> 48:12.240
technical assistance centers that will partner with LEAs to ensure that there is appropriate

48:12.240 --> 48:19.040
capacity and bandwidth to support the rural areas. Thank you. Thank you, caller.

48:26.160 --> 48:30.560
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

48:30.560 --> 48:37.840
Your time begins now. Good morning, State Board of Education members. My name is Lorraine Richards

48:37.840 --> 48:42.400
and I'm a classroom teacher representing California Teachers Association. California

48:42.400 --> 48:47.440
Teachers Association supports this historic investment of nearly $3 billion for community

48:47.440 --> 48:52.640
schools and we believe that this provides a real opportunity to transform public education for

48:52.640 --> 48:58.240
our students and communities. Overall, we believe that CDE's proposed administration plan is sound

48:58.240 --> 49:04.640
and will be vital to the rollout of the California Community Schools Partnership Program. CTA provided

49:04.640 --> 49:09.040
separate letters on this item. The first one contained a number of recommendations on the

49:09.040 --> 49:15.040
administration of the program and the second was a coalition letter that included 39 CTA chapters

49:15.040 --> 49:21.360
and 46 community groups that focused on educator and community engagement to ensure that this

49:21.360 --> 49:26.960
investment promotes a deep, sustainable, and community-based model. As previously stated by

49:26.960 --> 49:32.320
Michael Juba, he was providing public comment on what the focus of the specific recommendations

49:32.320 --> 49:35.840
were. Thank you for your time. Thank you, caller.

49:41.680 --> 49:46.160
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

49:46.160 --> 49:53.120
Your time begins now. Hi, Erin Naphty on behalf of Public Advocates of the California Partnership

49:53.120 --> 49:57.920
for the Future of Learning. We support CDE's plan for community engagement to develop a California

49:57.920 --> 50:02.160
community schools framework to guide program implementation. The framework will be foundational

50:02.160 --> 50:06.400
to the community schools program and inform the RFAs, technical assistance, program roles,

50:06.400 --> 50:10.800
and accountability measures, among others. The state needs to model the values and best practices

50:10.800 --> 50:15.200
of strong community schools by ensuring there is adequate time to draft the framework in response

50:15.200 --> 50:19.920
to meaningful input from the people most impacted by this program, students, families, educators,

50:19.920 --> 50:24.080
and community partners working in schools. To authentically reflect input received at the

50:24.080 --> 50:28.320
community forums and listening sessions held this fall and winter, the framework cannot reasonably

50:28.320 --> 50:33.040
be adopted earlier than February. CDE needs time to do engagement in November and December

50:33.040 --> 50:37.360
and synthesize input before drafting. With the year-end holidays, it's unrealistic to expect

50:37.360 --> 50:41.520
a framework draft before January. The public should have opportunities to review January

50:41.520 --> 50:45.680
drafts and provide additional feedback before the framework is finalized. If it will go before the

50:45.680 --> 50:50.080
board, then adoption should happen at the March meeting or special February 1. Brushing framework

50:50.080 --> 50:54.480
adoption without providing substantial opportunity for community input would undermine the credibility

50:54.480 --> 50:57.840
of the planning process and program implementation. Thank you.

51:03.600 --> 51:06.960
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

51:06.960 --> 51:09.200
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

51:11.440 --> 51:15.760
My name is Katie Nunez Adler and I'm the statewide coordinator for the California

51:15.760 --> 51:20.560
Partnership for the Future of Learning. As a partnership, we believe that shared

51:20.560 --> 51:24.960
decision-making at the state, district, and school site levels is essential to making the

51:24.960 --> 51:30.080
community schools program successful. We support establishing an advisory council at the statewide

51:30.080 --> 51:35.760
level for the council to be meaningful. Black, indigenous, and other students and families of

51:35.760 --> 51:41.200
color and low-income directly impacted folks need to be represented. Additional stakeholders,

51:41.200 --> 51:46.000
including educators, labor partners, community-based organizations that partner with schools,

51:46.000 --> 51:51.040
advocates and policy groups, and researchers should also be included. We would also like to

51:51.040 --> 51:57.040
see minimum requirements developed for districts to establish multi-stakeholder bodies for shared

51:57.040 --> 52:02.400
government that include independent representation from low-income, BIPOC, and other directly impacted

52:02.400 --> 52:07.040
students and families, along with educators, community partners, and district administrators.

52:07.680 --> 52:12.240
District-level bodies would be responsible for developing, maintaining, and monitoring systems,

52:12.240 --> 52:17.920
infrastructure, and relationships at the district level to support continuous improvement. Thank you.

52:25.280 --> 52:28.720
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

52:28.720 --> 52:30.880
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

52:32.960 --> 52:37.200
Hayen Kimner with the California Community Schools Learning Exchange.

52:37.200 --> 52:41.760
The CSLX is a consortium of multi-factor practitioners and advocates working to

52:41.760 --> 52:46.480
strengthen the community schools field. And although CSLX is new, the deep work of

52:46.480 --> 52:51.680
community school partnerships in California is not. Currently, our work seeks to support,

52:51.680 --> 52:56.880
lift up, and learn from those experts that have been implementing community school practices for

52:56.880 --> 53:01.520
years whether or not they have been calling them community schools. We're currently working to

53:01.520 --> 53:08.320
facilitate a consensus process on implementation standards initially developed in 2017 in partnership

53:08.320 --> 53:13.360
with community school practitioners across California specifically and nationally. And

53:13.360 --> 53:18.080
through this transparent and inclusive process, we seek to complement the work of the department

53:18.080 --> 53:23.200
to name culture systems and practices that are foundational to effective implementation

53:23.200 --> 53:28.960
and identifying areas where implementation might differ based on local context. We're thrilled to

53:28.960 --> 53:34.160
be able to advance this work and look forward to working in partnership with you all. Thank you so

53:34.160 --> 53:36.240
much. Thank you, caller.

53:42.160 --> 53:46.640
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.760
Your time begins now.

53:54.800 --> 53:58.320
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.480
You have one minute. Your time begins now.

54:00.480 --> 54:06.560
Good morning. Angelica Honko here with Public Advocates and a member of the California

54:06.560 --> 54:10.880
Partnership for the Future of Learning. Most importantly, I'm a public school parent.

54:10.880 --> 54:15.040
To quote Melissa, a leader with our California Partnership and a high school sophomore,

54:15.840 --> 54:20.320
normal wasn't working for a lot of people, especially students of color. We must work

54:20.320 --> 54:24.960
together with decision makers to create a school where we are comfortable and can succeed.

54:24.960 --> 54:28.320
I don't want to go back to a classroom. I want to go back to a community.

54:29.040 --> 54:33.440
Impacted students and families expect a seat at the table at every stage of this community

54:33.440 --> 54:38.720
school's grant process. We appreciate CDE's plan to hold multi-tiered community engagement

54:38.720 --> 54:43.680
in the coming months to solicit input and feedback and develop community buy-in.

54:43.680 --> 54:48.080
For stakeholder engagement to be meaningful and authentic, it must center the most impacted

54:48.080 --> 54:54.160
students, families, and communities. We appreciate the CDE's commitment to community regional forms

54:54.240 --> 54:59.120
as a step in this direction. Feedback gathered from these forms and other input sessions should

54:59.120 --> 55:03.760
be synthesized and made available to the public prior to adopting the California Community

55:03.760 --> 55:10.560
Schools Framework. And community engagement must continue to be part of this. We're so hopeful

55:10.560 --> 55:18.560
about this opportunity. Thank you. This concludes public comment.

55:18.560 --> 55:30.560
Thank you very much. And now we're open for a board discussion. Who would like to kick us off?

55:34.320 --> 55:35.360
Vice President Strauss.

55:38.400 --> 55:42.960
So I want to thank the CDE team for the presentation. I have a couple areas I'd

55:42.960 --> 55:48.000
just like some clarification on. This is a huge project, and I appreciate

55:48.000 --> 55:53.760
Member Escobedo's comment that we got to get this right and to take our time so that we develop it.

55:53.760 --> 56:00.080
So my first question is about the process of the framework development, the guidance. I understand

56:00.080 --> 56:05.680
the framework development will have input, but I'm interested, having been through some framework

56:05.680 --> 56:11.600
developments, what the process is, because this will guide the program as I understand it. So

56:12.400 --> 56:17.200
again, I have two or three questions, but that's my first one. The development process for the

56:17.200 --> 56:23.840
framework that will guide the implementation, and I assume the granting of the special grants.

56:25.200 --> 56:32.560
Yeah, so for the framework development, it's a major piece of the full and broad community

56:33.200 --> 56:41.600
outreach input and feedback that we're doing this fall. And a big highlight of that process

56:41.600 --> 56:51.200
is six regional virtual community forums where we have partners that are building a ground game

56:51.200 --> 56:56.640
so that there will be deep participation from those communities to reflect on the community

56:56.640 --> 57:04.640
school approach and what those communities see as students, families, and school staff,

57:05.840 --> 57:10.320
and community partners, how they see what a transformational approach would be, what their

57:10.320 --> 57:15.600
community schools should look like in California. And then layered on top of that will be

57:18.000 --> 57:23.600
sessions with, we've already started input sessions about visioning around community schools

57:23.600 --> 57:29.520
where some of the advocates have weighed in. And we'll have those folks look at iterations

57:29.520 --> 57:34.960
of that framework as it gets built, including for those community forums for them to see

57:34.960 --> 57:42.880
a version of what the input they gave and get to reflect on that input. And then we'll definitely

57:42.880 --> 57:53.280
have a broad way for folks to submit thoughts in writing. So just a question. So

57:53.680 --> 57:59.040
and maybe President Darling-Hammond or member Escobedo knows, but is this the type of guidance

57:59.040 --> 58:04.320
document that will come before the board for final editing before it goes into practice?

58:05.360 --> 58:12.160
I think the idea is that it would come in in January. And the challenge is that if we want

58:12.160 --> 58:19.840
grants to go out, if it's going to guide grant making and an RFA needs to be let before,

58:20.160 --> 58:26.960
you know, early in the spring or late in the winter for schools to know whether they've

58:26.960 --> 58:32.080
gotten these grants or just to know whether they've gotten these grants in time to do planning

58:32.080 --> 58:37.040
for the following year, January is the optimal time for it to come before the board.

58:37.920 --> 58:42.400
If you wait until March, then the whole cycle will mean that we'll miss the beginning of the

58:42.400 --> 58:48.720
school year. So I understand that. I just think it won't come to the board. This is late fall

58:48.720 --> 58:54.000
right now. I'll just say that. And we know people will be off Thanksgiving week and then

58:54.000 --> 58:58.960
there's a couple of weeks in December. I just think we probably don't have that much time to

58:58.960 --> 59:03.840
do a good draft and to be thoughtful about it. And I mean, some of the other board members may

59:03.840 --> 59:08.720
have some comments, but I agree. We want to get this right. I mean, there are some clear guidance

59:09.280 --> 59:13.440
areas for people who have experience in implementing community schools effectively.

59:13.440 --> 59:17.440
And I know LPI has done some research on that as well, but I just want to be thoughtful. We really

59:17.440 --> 59:22.720
don't have much time to prepare for a January board item. That's my first comment. The second

59:22.720 --> 59:30.960
comment is I believe schools and district staff are stretched at this time. Everyone's really

59:30.960 --> 59:37.840
exhausted, teachers and leaders. And there's also a staffing shortage at a time when we would be

59:37.840 --> 59:45.920
looking to add coordination and leadership to implement community schools, even in the planning

59:45.920 --> 59:52.560
grants. And so I just want to be sensitive to trying to get this right and recognizing

59:53.280 --> 59:59.360
the lack of additional staff and capacity during this year, which turned out to be far more

59:59.360 --> 01:00:04.880
challenging than people expected. And so I just want to raise that point. My final point

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.440
is maybe Steve Zimmer is the one to talk about it, but it's the advisory council. My understanding

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:18.320
is the superintendent wants to add an advisory council to guide this. And I'm interested in that

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:26.880
role versus the role of the state board and how all the pieces kind of guide this huge complex

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:37.040
process. Board President, would it be okay to respond? Yeah, please. Thank you, Vice President

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:47.920
Strauss. And you are raising some of the key balancing issues that we have here with balancing

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:58.400
the priority and the urgency of making sure that we can get started with what you eloquently and

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:05.360
our callers eloquently have outlined and Dr. Escobedo outlined in terms of making sure we get

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:19.840
this right. So a couple of things. One is that says that that ends in January. And it is, and

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:29.840
we envision a dynamic relationship in terms of our engagement with, you know, specifically with

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:40.480
Dr. Darling-Hammond and Dr. Escobedo as we already have in building both today's presentation and our

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:47.520
process moving forward, but also anticipate the feedback from the board as a whole is going to be

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:56.800
critical not just at the beginning, but throughout this process. And so that gets me a little bit to

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:05.040
the question of the advisory council. So the advisory council, as we've had our initial

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:16.160
conversations with the superintendent and some of our interest holders and community partners and

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:26.800
education partners throughout the state, is we envision that this group guiding and advising

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:36.640
through the implementation phase. So as we, you know, as we begin to see the technical assistance

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:46.400
process rollout, as we begin to see the RFA process rollout, we want to get ongoing input

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:57.600
from this advisory council to make sure that we are hearing both from practitioners,

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:05.920
from experts, and as Dr. Escobedo said, getting this right both in the initial construct

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.080
and building the foundation, but throughout the implementation process.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.760
Thanks, Steve. Do you want to speak to, just to go back to the second question that Vice President

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:27.280
Strauss raised about the, you know, current context, the thinking about the way in which

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:34.480
will grants will be given for planning grants, for example, where I'll just note most of the

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.320
work goes on after you get the planning grant, so you don't have to have a lot of capacity

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.520
on the front end. Planning grant allows you to have capacity, but I know you're balancing that

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:51.520
to the question of how to make grants accessible. Yeah, thank you for elevating that, and we are,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:04:02.240
we're acutely aware of the stress upon LEAs right now, and want to make sure that we are

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:12.240
very intentional about the equity goals of this legislation, and really that kind of guides the

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:19.680
heart and soul of the community schools movement, and we want to make sure that the students who,

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.280
the students, families, the school communities that have faced the most persistent disparities

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:37.120
have access to these grants and this kind of transformational process,

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:45.200
but we also want to be very aware that we don't want to create an additional stressor or burden

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:53.360
right now on districts, on LEAs. We want to make sure that, particularly the planning grant,

01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:02.160
but also the parallel process for districts who want to expand, that that is accessible,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:14.400
that the initial RFAs are not burdensome with unnecessary paperwork, and we don't need,

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.400
with all due respect to all the doctors on the board, we don't need doctoral thesis

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:29.680
in terms of these applications. We need to see the intent, the goal, the commitment

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.080
to transformation and equity through this process, and so that's what's really

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.960
driving our thinking right now. I just want to know that you've talked a lot about how to make the

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:50.720
application process a smooth one. Smooth one and user-friendly. Right. I see

01:05:52.160 --> 01:06:00.000
member Sun, member Rucker, and member Glover-Woods. Member Sun? Thank you. So yeah, I'm excited

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.520
about the vision of these community schools, that my questions and comments are related to

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.520
member Strout as well around the implementation and how this particular initiative fits into our

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:18.720
larger system so that we ensure that while we're adding new initiatives and more money into the

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:25.520
pot, if you will, and targeted to similar schools, we want to target this money to students and to

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:35.520
districts that most need the support. So how does this fit into, let's say, the LCAP process,

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:45.280
the system of support that we're building through the collaborative? We already have technical

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.560
assistance centers as part of that system of support, so where does the tech assistance centers

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:58.320
for this fit into that bigger picture? I feel that we kind of recreate the wheel for every one of

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:06.240
these projects that we add and in different pots of funding and accounting for those pots of

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:12.480
funding and writing the plans that are very similar to plans and to feedback that they've

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:21.680
already gotten from educational partners in the LCAP process. So I think somehow in the implementation

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:29.200
of how this, it's got to spread to some of the system that we currently have. And then also

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:37.360
wanted to speak to the point that member Strout brought up around capacity right now in our system

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:44.880
and with the lack of staffing that's happening right now, schools are having a hard time even

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.600
just spending the money that they have that are coming in from both the state and the federal level

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.360
to implement programs. So how does this, will this fit into it? And then when there is the

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.560
reporting of the funds for how these, this initiative through the community schools is

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.600
funds that are being spent on the implementation and planning of this, how does that fit with

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.960
other funding that the district or schools may be receiving for similar students?

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:26.000
Yes. Okay. So maybe to start, think about the community schools effort as a way, a second chance

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.600
or another way to emphasize meeting the goals of LCFF, but then to seriously answer your question

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:43.760
looking to the TA. So as we build out that TA infrastructure, the content would focus on

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:51.440
how to support these kinds of planning processes and do alignment for your multiple planning

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:58.320
processes. Community schools is not meant to be a sidebar or another effort. It should be

01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:07.840
the central effort and include LCFF and not be duplicative. And then also around the TA,

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:13.600
we definitely in building that infrastructure have our eye to what looking at those other

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:20.880
systems for providing TA around school improvement and making sure that when we

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.480
build this infrastructure, we're learning from those systems, lessons learned, but also have an

01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:34.400
eye to ultimately this is community schools should be the way that schools function in California.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:41.360
So we're thinking about all of those considerations are being made as we build that TA system.

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:52.080
And then I think you also asked about the staffing issues and I just want to reiterate that the CDE

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:59.600
staff is CDE team is very keenly aware of how much assistance school districts need now in juggling

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.720
these funding streams, dealing with the staffing issues and all of that. So also thinking about

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:09.840
the TA that can be provided, building on the TA that's already being provided to our first round

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:15.840
of grantees. How can we get some help out ahead of building this formal infrastructure?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:27.520
Yeah, I had a comment about this question about staffing. You know what, I think a goal that

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:33.120
the department staff has talked a lot about is that a community school approach at the

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:38.480
district level and the school level adds staff whose job it is to coordinate all those other

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:45.920
funds and services. So it's not another program added on like another categorical. It's a way to

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:53.440
manage that complexity that already exists rather than adding yet another kind of

01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.640
incentive obligation. So anyway, it should be helpful in that goal if it works well and is

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.640
in the places where it works well. The question is going to be how to help people learn to do it.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:11.040
Yeah, and I completely agree that and I see it absolutely in the presentation in some way. We

01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:16.320
haven't really said how this particular initiative fits into the larger system. So I think that's

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:22.800
part of the communication of this is how this fits into our ultimate goal as a state and how

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.160
we're doing it the California way, which we discussed for the last four years or so. So

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:36.160
that's really more what my point is to how do we frame it into the larger system.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.480
If I could, Chair, Board Member Son, I'd like to pick up where Dr. Darling-Hammond left off.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:48.240
The community school's coordinator is a central component to how the connection to all these

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:53.040
wonderful services and supports will happen. There's really no way to do this without having

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.920
a community school's coordinator and sometimes more, but I appreciate your question. I do think

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:03.200
that we have to be thoughtful about how all these resources get implemented, and they cannot be

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:08.880
viewed as in isolation. And I don't think anyone on this board or this staff of these agencies does,

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:14.720
but it is a tremendous opportunity. If we think about community schools and how it aligns with

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:22.000
universal TK and universal meals and the $4.3 billion for mental health that is in the budget,

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.080
we're constantly thinking how do we align all of these efforts and we will make maximum impact

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.600
and at the same time figure out how to help our field, which is dealing with, as you said,

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.800
massive staffing and capacity challenges. We know that we have to, for example, we have to

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.480
work with our field and we've begun these conversations to figure out how to create

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:49.360
more mental health clinicians who can work in many parts of our state, including in our rural

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.440
communities. And so these staffing challenges have to be addressed, but we are looking at how

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.640
to align all these resources in tandem, not separately, and I think we can create the kind

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:04.960
of impacts that you're alluding to and certainly keep in mind our existing frameworks that we use,

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:11.280
like LCAP and the systems of support. Ultimately, I believe that when we talk about the social

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.800
economics that are going to impact many of those who are selected for these grants,

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.440
they are the same communities where we're looking at for the wonderful resources provided through

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:27.200
LCFF and places where the systems of support is available to help support achievement. And so we

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:31.120
have to overlay them and align them and we're happy to work with any of the members of the board and

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:40.320
anyone else in how we maximize that alignment and overlay. Thank you very much. I have a lot of

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.440
folks eager to get some ideas on the table, so I want to go to member Rucker, then member Glover

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:51.920
Woods, then member Rodriguez, and then member Burr. Member Rucker. Thank you very much. First of all,

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.840
I do want to thank the staff for clearly what was a great deal of work in preparing for today's

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:07.360
presentation. This is a large and significant and important investment. This is a large,

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:14.240
significant and important opportunity and the adjective that I kept hearing was excited and

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:22.000
the noun excitement kept coming up in the discussion and great anticipation is what was laid

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:27.840
in front of me in looking forward to this particular item today. But I have to tell you,

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:34.640
as I listened to the presentation, the word that came into my mind was awesome. Now for some people,

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:39.680
awesome has this meaning that's more, you know, okay, you're about to understand why I'm an

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:44.400
English major, so if your eyes roll over, that's okay. But for a lot of people, when you hear that

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:51.120
word awesome, you think about how the adverb really talks about extremely well or extremely,

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:57.520
or excellently that things are going so well. I'm thinking about the adjective and this awesome is

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.920
one of those words that carries dual meaning at the same time. It's both impressive but daunting.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:11.840
It's both inspiring, great admiration, but at the same time apprehension and fear. And so,

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:17.200
for the community partners and the community of people who need to be involved in implementing

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:24.720
this community schools program, awesome is a very good adjective to use. The department's excitement

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:34.080
and clear, impressive anticipation about the good that this program will do is evident. But what you

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.560
heard both from stakeholders and from some of my colleagues on the board is you have another set of

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:46.960
community partners who have a different set of concerns at this moment. They may be excited,

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.480
but they're also overwhelmed. They're also having some apprehension about what this work would be.

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.440
One of the things I was hoping to hear, while it's very evident that you have done a lot of planning

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:06.560
and it's very clear that you have the ability to do some multitasking, your charge today was to do

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:13.360
some table setting to help everyone understand what it means to come to this process and what

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:19.520
they can bring to the table, but also the differences between the planning phase and the

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.240
full implementation phase. As our board president made clear, applying for the planning grant

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.080
actually gives you the opportunity to create the capacities that we are all afraid right now don't

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.160
exist in the schools that this program is intended to be for. And so, I think as part of the table

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:44.080
setting as we move forward from this conversation we have today to the conversations that have to

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:52.240
continue at the LEA and the county level is there needs to be more attention paid in that presentation

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:58.000
to the table setting, what it means to begin. Putting an emphasis on existing structures,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.720
putting an emphasis and giving a clear explanation in the guidance that's to come on what will be

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:12.320
built up or what will be developed as the process unfolds. And while we can sit here at this level,

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.240
we understand that we're at the beginning stages and there's an architecture that has to be built

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.760
out and developed and that's the natural outgrowth from creating the guidance and all the things that

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:30.560
are coming down the road. That's not what's really clear or laid out to the LEAs and the leadership

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:37.440
that need to do these applications and do this support. And so, I think that as you do this,

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.800
I'd like to think of today's presentation as the rough draft and as you hone out some of the rough

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:50.080
edges from today's presentation, you focus on that to the table setting interest for the groups that

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:55.280
you're charging to do the application and to get into this process and to start a different

01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.480
relationship with you. I think I disagree with the idea that this is not an additional program or an

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:08.160
add-on because that's the way I heard it today. That's the way it was received. The reason I say

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:13.840
I heard it that way and I received it that way is I wasn't really clear on how the other divisions

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:20.560
in the department are going to be contributing to or even are part of the frame or the architecture

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:26.400
of this program. The example that was given was concerning the LCAP. Since the LCAP and the work

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:35.760
schools do is going to be a central part of the planning and the instructional function of this

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:41.440
community school. I don't see how any of that was considered or brought in. We have technical

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:47.120
assistance centers already in place. And the way this was presented, this was going to be a new

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:52.960
system of support and a new system of technical assistance centers. And I don't believe that that

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:58.560
was the intent of the presentation, but that's the way it was received as if this is going to be a

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:05.600
new and different entity for technical assistance. So I think we have to be more mindful in setting

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:12.640
the table on implementing this very broad, very important program of thinking about what the

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:19.280
relationship is. Is there an umbrella that brings the LCFF and all the other school functions

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.400
into the work of what's happening with the community schools? So which is the umbrella?

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:31.840
The community schools or the LCFF for schools that are considered high priority schools and they have

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.640
that separate label, is that the umbrella? I think the relationship among all the activities

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:45.200
that are happening with the intent of benefiting high need, high priority schools and the students

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:52.640
they serve, there needs to be some clarification about the architecture of all of this work because

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:58.480
that really wasn't as well laid out as it could be. Because we do this planning and we understand

01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:03.280
this planning all the time, we know the difference between the planning phase and what the planning

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.600
grant is supposed to do and the full implementation phase, but that wasn't as really well laid out,

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:15.440
I don't think, as it could be. So I'm very pleased that the work that was done, it's evident

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:20.000
that you are the beneficiaries of a lot of planning and a lot of interaction,

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:26.320
but I'm not really sure that the scope and the full force of the department and the roles of the

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:32.960
other divisions in the department are made clear and the functions of the programs that are already

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:40.320
in place at the school site, district and county level are clearly indicated in the architecture

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:50.080
and the full implementation of this. I'm very happy as a thinker and looking at all those broad

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.680
avenues, I'm very happy to be a critical friend on looking at those things, but those were just the

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:01.840
pieces that were left out. And then finally, as I said yesterday, we're really good on the planning,

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:07.600
but we have a really hard time talking about accountability. The point was made that the

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:13.680
work we're already doing is raising test scores. So yeah, I will agree a high tide raises all boats,

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:20.640
but there has got to be a clear understanding that the intent is not just to raise or improve

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:28.720
student achievement, but to raise and create avenues for students to catch up and keep up.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:35.520
And that wasn't as well laid out today for the purpose and the goal for creating these community

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:41.760
schools. That wasn't as well laid out as it could have been either. So planning was great, but again,

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:48.080
the conversation on accountability and monitoring as we go through this wasn't as well explained

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.960
as it could have been. So I will leave it there. Thank you. We have a lot of folks who want to get

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:58.240
in, but I do want to see if anyone in the department wants to call up any of the points

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:04.000
that were made in the memo that the board received prior to the meeting, which did deal

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.280
with some of the accountability questions and some of the other points. Linda, that's the reason why

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:17.440
I'm making my point. We got the memo and I read that, but there was a difference between what I

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.800
read, what I received and was explained to me, and what was made public here. People are going

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:27.920
to remember what was made public here. Right. That's why I'm giving folks a chance to raise

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:32.720
those points so that the public that's trying to listen in, but I do want to also get to our other

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:39.200
board members. But I want to give the department staff, if they want to, that opportunity.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:46.080
Darling, I want to address, because I do agree with some of the points and concerns that came up from

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:51.200
Vice President Strauss, also from Board Member Sun and Board Member Rucker, but I want to

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.880
sort of address them in a couple of different ways. I think one thing that wasn't really sort

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:05.440
of clarified, I think, in the presentation is that this is an iterative process that we're going to

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:12.800
start with some foundational points, and then the goal is particularly through community partnership

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:19.920
engagement, the evolution of the advisory council, and feedback from the field that we're going to

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.920
develop. We're not expecting to accomplish everything in year one. We know that in this process,

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:31.920
we have schools who are going to make decisions about what's the best timing for them to join in.

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.120
So that's one of the reasons there's multiple rounds for implementation as well as planning

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:44.080
grants. So people can pick and choose when they have the capacity to participate in this initiative.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.960
The other point that I really want to highlight, and I think Board Member Rucker really brought

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:56.080
this up, and also Board Member Sun, was how does all of this sort of center? I think the

01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:02.960
conversations that we've been having with sort of community partners is that community schools,

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.480
like the framework, the model, everywhere you want to sort of describe it, becomes the point of focus.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:15.040
So too, Board Member Rucker's point is how are we organizing around that as the intervention?

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:22.880
And then looking at the current resources. So I agree, we are even internally looking at how

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.680
we leverage this, not just LCAP. We're looking at the dollars that are connected to our homeless

01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:34.480
population, our foster youth, AB 2083 in terms of this. We're looking at how our internal system

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.480
of support and improvement can be leveraged, particularly around as we're developing webinars

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.280
with Westad around how to use those one-time dollars, and then how to connect that conversation

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.880
to community schools. We're looking at how do we not just integrate information from LCFF,

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.760
but looking at the titles for sustainability along with Medi-Cal. So we're having those

01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:02.080
conversations, and I think the goal that we're looking to do is sort of use community schools

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:06.800
as that opportunity. And I love the point about accountability, because we do have to take some

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.760
time, and that's even working with the State Board and community partners, to really outline

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.480
what are the accountability measures? Like, what are we going to be looking that defines school

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:22.160
transformation in California? So I think we're at those stages. It might not have been communicated

01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.960
well, but I want to say that that's the plan, is that we start somewhere, we continue to have

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.880
conversations, and that hopefully it'll be a comprehensive conversation and a plan and a

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.320
framework that we can agree on. So to Vice President Strauss, I agree, we're not trying

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:43.520
to rush this, but I want everybody to understand that whatever gets developed in January may not

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:48.880
be the final product. It may be where we start, and the goal is through continuous improvement

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:54.240
that we reflect on it, we refine it, and then at the end of this process that we'll have a framework.

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.960
Thank you, Dr. Lee. And through the Chair, just quickly, I wanted to just say,

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:04.480
Board Member Rucker and other board members, we receive your feedback. Thank you for giving

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.560
critical friend feedback, and that always strengthens every process. And so we will continue

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:18.000
to take the feedback, we will continue to work to articulate how this community school strategy

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.640
integrates with some of the existing frameworks that exist for supporting schools. Board Member

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.360
Rucker, you referenced it. Board Member Son, you've referenced it. We will continue to articulate

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.080
that. Interestingly enough, just to build on Dr. Lee's comments, Dr. Lee is always talking about

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.840
how we must create all priorities, must have that deep, deep integration. And many of the programs

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:45.840
that you all reference are in Dr. Lee's branch. And so community schools lives in this equity

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:53.440
branch, as does all the divisions and staff and units that work on LCAP and the systems of support.

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:59.280
And so we hear you, we receive the feedback. And I think that given that they're all in the same

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.080
branch, there is this opportunity to create that cross-threading, to create that integration.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:07.760
Ultimately, that will support the sustainability that I think all of you were talking about. I

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.320
heard Board Member Strauss talk about that. And so just know we receive your feedback,

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:19.120
and we will continue to polish up our work here in a way that we can articulate that integration

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:22.960
of all of these efforts, because that's what it's going to take for success. Thank you.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:30.960
Very helpful. Thank you. I have Member Glover Woods, Member Rodriguez, Member Burr, and

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:35.200
Member Bonanca. So let's go with Member Glover Woods.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:43.760
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. First, I want to just again echo how important and essential

01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:52.400
the community schools will be to students who will be able to benefit from this particular model of

01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:59.600
educating students. I'm looking forward to updates and information that come forward in

01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.680
the future regarding the framework that is developed and all of the other updates that

01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:11.360
were shared in the presentation. I just wanted to make a couple of points. One, a very strong

01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:19.920
request to be sure that during the listening forums, all of the different feedback opportunities for

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:25.920
the framework, as well as the community and educational partners that will be identified

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:35.200
for the advisory council, that there's a very intentional outreach to ensure accurately

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:43.360
representing the demographics of the schools and the students that this model will serve.

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:51.120
I know that it's on the radar of everyone to be sure that we're not only hearing the voices in

01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:56.320
the development of this, of those who might be at state agencies, those might be in different

01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:02.720
organizations, but I'm really asking the department to do some very intentional outreach down to the

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:12.640
grassroots of the communities to be sure that those who are speaking into the model really are

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.120
demographically representative of those who will be impacted by how this is structured.

01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:27.520
My second request and or suggestion is as it relates to the development of the framework,

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.040
some of my fellow board members have already talked about how this might need to coordinate

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:40.640
and articulate with some of the existing components that we already have in our system. So what I

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:47.760
would strongly encourage is that during the development of the actual framework,

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:54.000
that there is language in the framework that speaks to how the community schools planning

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:02.160
and implementation can integrate with different aspects such as the LCAP that's been brought up.

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.800
If there are schools that are eligible for certain levels of technical assistance,

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:13.520
like differentiated assistance, what lens should be used in determining again how all of this

01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:20.400
coordinates with goals, actions, services that are determined in those processes, how it braids with

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:29.600
other funding sources. So again, my request is that within the body of the framework

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.960
for community schools, this community schools partnership, that there is some language that

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:42.400
speaks to how all of this needs to integrate for the LEAs and the specific schools that

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:49.120
will be recipients of this great program. Thank you so much. Member Rodriguez.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:58.160
Yes, thank you. I want to say also how excited I am about this. In 2012, I was ready to leave

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:05.520
the teaching profession and education altogether. I ran into a friend of mine who was involved in

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:11.200
California policy, educational policy, and said, hang in there. There's some great things happening

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:18.800
in California. And then a year later, LCFF, which I got very excited about. However, one of the things

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:30.000
that I think the NCLB compliance checklist model is still very much ingrained in a lot of our school

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:36.880
systems, that compartmentalization, which is what was just killing my soul, right? To not be able

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:42.320
to sit down with colleagues and plan, to not be able to sit down with parents. And when they would

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:47.760
say, well, can I come and take English classes here? Well, no, because we can't have adults

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:55.120
during school, right? You know, all of that and all that compartmentalization that as a person of

01:31:55.120 --> 01:32:07.600
color, it goes against my makeup. And so seeing this item on the agenda and reading and learning

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:13.680
a lot about community schools, Member Strauss mentioned LPI. And yesterday there was a wonderful

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:20.400
email that I passed on to my school leadership, right? You know, hoping in preparation of this item,

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:26.000
I just want to say how enthusiastic I am. One of the callers mentioned,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:30.240
and it was also mentioned here about making sure that we have the voices of the community,

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:37.440
Black, Indigenous, people of color. Absolutely. I think that's, you know, it seems to me the intention

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:47.120
and to really take the LCFF and that partnership, educational partnership model. And,

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:55.200
you know, again, to quote Member President Darlene Hammond, that transformation, right? And to make

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:02.720
all of those connections in education that are so essential, not only for the academic and intellectual

01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:08.400
building of our students, but just the whole child, the family, the community.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:17.120
I envision the partnerships with attorneys coming in and civics lessons for parents. There's just so

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:26.000
much potential within the community schools model to really build a community. And one of the things,

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.520
you know, to a caveat for me is with the technical assistance centers,

01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:36.640
I really hope, and even though, you know, like it's outlined here in the item,

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:44.960
but I really want to see a proactive feedback, the way we give students feedback in our classes

01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.360
when they're working on projects, how to improve, right? You know, that continuous improvement,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:56.160
as opposed to coming in and going, oh, check, they have this, they have that, but really engaging

01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:03.920
and going from compliance to engagement. Our communities and our students are ready for that.

01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:10.080
So I just want to say that I feel that a lot of thought has been put into this. And I also

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:16.000
appreciate the follow-up with the comments that have been made regarding the technical components.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:23.360
Thank you. Thank you. We have member Burr, member Bonanca, member Patil Bronson,

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:30.720
and then I believe member Sun has re-raised her hand, right? Okay. Member Burr. Thank you,

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:36.320
President Darling-Hammond. I don't want to be redundant, but I will associate my comments with

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:42.560
board member Sun, board member Strauss, board member Rucker around both the sort of overwhelming

01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:47.440
nature of this, while there's unbelievable promise and it's super exciting that we have

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:52.800
this opportunity. I think we have to be very humble about the implementation of it.

01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.120
One thing, and I also want to start out by saying, I think member Rucker mentioned this,

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:03.760
I'm not sure everybody reads our board memos. I don't mean board members, but just generally

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.680
people don't. And the board memo on this item is very helpful. It helps fill in a lot of the gaps.

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.600
So just for purposes of people who are listening, I point you to that memo and also want to say how

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.960
much I appreciate it from the department staff and the board staff to help kind of understand.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.040
I am sort of a practical person here, so I want to get down to some suggestions about the practicality

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:34.960
of moving forward with this and what would be really helpful when we see this in January. Because

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.400
we have pretty clearly defined eligibility about this, seeing a list of the schools and districts

01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:46.000
who are eligible to apply would both be helpful, I think, to the board, but I would hope it would be

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:52.320
helpful to your outreach process so that you can identify these are the groups of schools and

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:57.360
districts that need the help the most. It might help sort of think about where will those technical

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.520
assistance centers be or should they be placed to provide that level of assistance? Because I think

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.240
at this point, I'll just say for me, this is so big, I can't get my hands around it to really

01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:16.400
understand what the implications are for the actual implementation. And I think more specifically,

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:22.080
it goes directly to some of the comments that board member McClellan made at the beginning,

01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:28.160
that we know sort of statistically how many rural schools, how many small schools we have

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:34.960
in this state, especially north of Sacramento, that may need this kind of assistance.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:42.160
And if we don't see them and plan for them, then I feel like they get left out. In the good old days,

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:48.240
we used to give flat amounts of money to the small, necessary small schools, rural schools,

01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:54.560
because this issue about capacity and the ability of those kinds of schools and districts to actually

01:36:54.560 --> 01:37:00.960
mount the level of effort that is needed to do a contract, to do a proposal, all of that.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:06.560
Well, all of the resources that are going to be there, once they get it, are very well deserved

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:12.080
and people will love to have them. It's getting there that is daunting. And in this kind of

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.800
environment, I think it's going to be really hard for people to think about that. So just friendly

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:23.760
advice, critical friend advice, as board member Rucker said. The other thing I just want to emphasize

01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:27.920
and I think board member Glover Woods brought this up, the importance of those technical

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:34.320
assistance centers. And I think getting those up and going as quickly as you can in parallel

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:39.920
with the planning and the implementation, again, to districts and schools that need it the most.

01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:46.080
The one thing, the sort of last two things I want to say is, for purposes of this notion

01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:51.840
about integration, and this is me talking as somebody who's the self-appointed historian,

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:58.160
I don't, this comes across, I'll just say this, I don't mean this as kind of a negative comment,

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:04.640
but we have to be clear that this is not a new categorical program, that this is in fact

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:10.720
an opportunity and lots of money to help integrate all of these efforts that we have had underway

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:16.320
for so many years to identify students who have the greatest needs and have been underserved for

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:21.520
years and create structures to make them successful. Because I think otherwise,

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.680
again, we're kind of losing the plot here a little bit, or at least I have. So to make sure

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:32.560
about that, the last thing I'll say, and I appreciate the notion of continuous improvement

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.560
in the process, is we really need to be humble about the timing. Superintendent Thurmond got

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:45.120
to hear my old shaggy dog story about my experience years ago, working at the state level for another

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.760
governor with lots of fantastic initiatives, and then I went, well, I'm going to go to a district

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:55.360
and see how this works, and I went to the district and said, wow, we have all these great ideas,

01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.240
four big initiatives, we've got to get going, and they looked at me like I had grown two pets.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:06.320
A, they didn't know what I was talking about, B, they had a lot, they, as all of you who worked

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:11.760
in districts and counties know, lots of things in place and planning that they had forward for a

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:17.440
couple of years, and no way did these new initiatives fit in with that planning. So we

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.160
always kind of are out of sync with what we're doing at the state level versus what's happening

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:27.840
at the local level. So just again, friendly advice, be very humble about the timing,

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:33.200
and think about how this all fits in, in the context of a pandemic. Thank you.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.680
Commissioner Burke, thank you for that feedback, and I know that it mirrors the conversation that

01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:43.120
we had at the CCE board meeting recently about the importance of field testing, listening to the

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.320
constituents, not having the state drive downward, but rather listening to what, at the school site

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:53.920
level, people are saying that they need and then providing that. We will continue with that guiding

01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.240
principle. Thank you for that and for sharing the shaggy dog story. I will tell you, as I literally

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.600
sit at one of the schools that, you know, one of the districts that is deeply interested in community

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.960
schools, because we are doing what you said, with field testing, I have to say for a field that is

01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:18.000
so plagued by so many things, this may be the one thing that I have heard consistently from school

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.880
leaders all across the state, we really, really want it. I think the biggest challenge is going

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.160
to be how they apply, and you heard our team talk about how sensitive we are to not making it some

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:34.240
hurdle to have to jump over or through or go around, but people are really feeling like

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.280
community schools can make a difference for them, they're invested in it, probably because of the

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.480
moment that we are coming out of and being in the pandemic. Everyone wants a community school in an

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:50.000
urban environment, in a rural environment, frontier communities, and so, but we will continue, as you

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.640
said, to use as our guiding principle, one of our guiding principles, listening to the needs of the

01:40:54.640 --> 01:41:00.320
field, working on timing, and Dr. Darling-Hammond has commented on this, we are juggling some

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:05.680
legislative timelines that have been imposed, that have to be met, with how to also manage the

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:11.200
moment and not rush and make the most of this moment. So again, feedback received, and thank

01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:20.080
you for sharing the Shaggy dog story to help. Thank you so much. I think next in the queue is

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:27.120
member Bonanca. Well first, I want to thank the CDE staff for all the great work that has been done

01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:32.960
on this item. I truly believe that this investment in community schools is going to completely

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.480
transform the future of education in our state, and I'm also really happy to see that community

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:43.280
schools really address a lot of the student proposals that we heard yesterday, like student

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:50.320
wellness and socioeconomic support and the equitable education proposals. I agree with member

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:57.120
Rucker, it's awesome, but while I applaud the efforts to listen to educational partners

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:03.040
in this process, I want to echo the remarks of member Glover Woods in that we truly need to

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.480
listen to the people most affected by this investment, and on that same line, I want to

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:14.960
emphasize the importance of listening to students in this process, and I don't just mean one or two

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:21.520
but I think a significant portion of the educational partners that we hear from and consider

01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:27.040
should be students, and especially unduplicated students, and the reason why I think it's so

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:33.280
important, especially for this issue, is because community schools, as I said before and has been

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.640
repeated by many members, are going to be the future of education in California and are going

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:45.520
to transform the state of education in the state of California, so I think it's truly

01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:51.600
essential that we listen to plenty of student voice in this process because it's not just

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.800
going to affect the millions of students in our system now, but it's going to affect millions of

01:42:56.800 --> 01:43:02.400
students in the future, and I think the way to address this is really making sure that the

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:08.720
outreach is targeted towards students, because we as students get information in very, very different

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:15.280
ways than adults, so making sure that the outreach is very intentionally targeted towards students,

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:19.360
especially unduplicated pupils, I think is something that we should definitely keep in mind

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:24.880
moving forward, but again, I applaud all of the efforts by the CDE on this investment.

01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.840
Thank you, board member Benocca, and I should have been explicit that we not only listen to

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:35.120
school communities, but yes, to students and to community partners and advocates. We want to be

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:41.200
as broad as we can, so thank you for helping me to clarify my statement. We have recently,

01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:47.760
as state agencies, we've had to go beyond the types of places that we use to communicate.

01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.280
Even my own teenage children have said, Dad, nobody listens to Facebook anymore. CDE and the

01:43:55.280 --> 01:44:00.720
state board have to speak through other social mediums, and you're right. We will have to utilize

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:05.280
formal structures and informal structures to make sure that we're lifting up the voices of students

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.800
and the students that this is intended to serve. Thank you for that feedback, board member Benocca.

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:15.840
Great, thank you. I want to go to board member Patio Brownson, and then members sign.

01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.880
So I also want to thank CDE and the superintendent for bringing forward this proposal. It obviously,

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:29.600
I think, has touched off so much excitement, I think, around the state and on this board for the

01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:36.880
prospect of a different type of transformation coming through community schools. I would also

01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:45.840
just add that similar to LEA leaders, I've just heard an immense amount of community and CBO level

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:52.400
excitement for what it means to make, in some ways, it's almost the opposite of sort of narratives

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.760
you hear about hardening schools. It's actually about softening schools and encouraging community

01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:04.880
in a different sort of partnership to sort of make it more porous, more inviting to families,

01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:11.840
to community-based organizations, to actually partner with schools in a whole different way.

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:19.120
I think the point that board member Benocca just made around different mediums, really,

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:25.520
for how you do the outreach is also true not just for students but also for parents of younger

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:34.720
children. When we've done research around how do you actually connect with both parents of

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:41.200
elementary but also zero to five kids, the parents of zero to five children, oftentimes the social

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:48.720
media that is useful and impactful is not the same as it is for a 50-plus demographic, which

01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.640
oftentimes I think is imagined to be only the province of students but also I think is true

01:45:54.640 --> 01:46:02.240
for young parents. The last thing I wanted to just raise up is this idea of, I agree with the

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:10.160
importance of articulation with existing state accountability formats around LCAP, and I also

01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:16.880
think it's an opportunity to be creative about a more expansive set of outcomes to strive for.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:25.440
There are a finite list of outcomes that are built into our LCAP, and there are slightly more

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:31.120
expansive ones that are envisioned, I think, under the community schools aspirations. So

01:46:31.120 --> 01:46:37.760
particularly in the section of the memo addressing what those outcome measures might look like,

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:45.680
I think there's an opportunity to think about not just test sort of achievement and the host of

01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:51.520
variables that are listed there currently, but also sort of opportunities for early learning,

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:58.080
for after school learning, for summer learning, to actually be quantified and part of what school

01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:04.400
districts can set out for their own ambitions of how they would want to see wraparound services

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:09.440
actually touching the children in their school districts. I would add to this list, not surprisingly,

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:16.400
access to early learning opportunities and also access to P2-3 articulation to ensure that those

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:22.560
early learning foundations are smooth and actually carried from grade to grade to build the strongest

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:30.240
foundation possible. And I think, just lastly, I would say if you're hearing a whole bunch of

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:35.600
excitement but also feedback, it's because it's such a precious opportunity, especially given the

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:42.240
year that we've all had, and it makes it all the more important. Thank you. Appreciate the feedback.

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:46.960
Thank you. And we welcome it. We want the excitement. And in many ways, this is the

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:51.440
beginning of the listening sessions. You all are part of the listening session. You all are giving

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:57.040
us feedback that we can incorporate. And we're jotting down all the questions and comments.

01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:06.480
And note that you're absolutely right, that there are, we do have a parent advisory council that we

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:10.720
have been working with that we've launched and established to get more parent voice conversation

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.120
into space, and there are other groups across the state. I'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge that

01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:21.120
we've been working closely with the Partnership for the Future, a coalition that includes many

01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:25.920
groups. And I have to shout out Mark Philpark from PolicyLink in particular, who has been

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.040
crosswalking with Deanna Niebuhr a number of these conversations, who we've invited to be

01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.400
in many of the conversations in the listening sessions. And so there are many, many people

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.320
who are already helping. Your feedback is helping. I think that your point about what we measure,

01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:46.640
maybe Dr. Darlene Hammond has thoughts on it too, because Dr. Darlene Hammond has been a part of

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.280
community schools for a long time and has been a big advocate and has worked on it at the ground

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:57.520
level, at the community level. I think in many ways, community schools have always been sort of

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:02.640
trying to figure out the best way to show the impact of the programs. We know instinctually

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:07.200
that community schools help students be more successful academically, because when you remove

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.600
a physical barrier or a health barrier or a mental health barrier, or even a social justice barrier,

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.520
and we completely align with the work to soften what happens on school campuses, to reverse the

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:21.440
hardening of what's going on on school campuses. We completely align with that,

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:26.320
but how do we measure the impact? We'll continue these conversations and look forward to engaging

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:30.880
with you all about the best ways that we can identify to measure those impacts to our schools.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:38.560
Thank you. I think Member Sun and then Member Rucker has raised her hand again. I do want to

01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:44.160
start to bring our conversation to a fine point and a close, because we have yet another agenda

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:48.080
item, and I know that people are listening carefully, so we don't have to repeat what

01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:55.200
we've said, but we can add some new ideas. So, Member Sun. Yeah, so that's what I was hoping to

01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:00.640
do. I know the staff has heard about the cohesion, coherence, and all that, so I'm hoping that

01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:08.240
what we've done in this conversation has kind of shifted thoughts from the staff about the messaging

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:17.280
of this initiative, that from one of this is a great initiative that all we should all strive

01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:25.040
towards, to one that might be what Dr. Lee had alluded to is how all these different parts will

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:31.840
fit in to create, and it's a little bit different than how it was presented before. I think that,

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:37.200
you know, being a little bit more humble and how that messaging is that we're honoring work that

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:43.680
has already been done in the field over these past many years, and that the community schools

01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.960
is the gestalt, if you will, of all these parts, and therefore the technical assistance centers,

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:57.600
all that, is really a means, because we really need a means to bring cohesion into the system

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:03.120
with all these different funding aspects and all that, and so maybe thinking about this as a way

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:08.800
of coordinating these, and that may be very well where the staff has been, but it has not been

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:16.880
articulated necessarily clearly in that way. Member Rucker. And I'm glad to follow Board

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:22.640
Member San on this point, because that was also the suggestion I was going to add. Let me ask you

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:28.320
to also think about, in looking at your planning, to pull back a little bit, and looking at the

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:33.200
architecture of what you've laid out in front of us, where are the inflection points on the

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:40.480
implementation and planning in this activity? And specifically, right now, it is the department

01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.920
and your leadership councils and your technical advisory committees and centers that are doing

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:52.480
the work of helping districts get started with this, but at some point, the districts and the

01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:58.800
school sites where these programs are going to unfold and blossom become the drivers. Where are

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:05.040
those inflection points, and where are you looking for and planning for that transition where the

01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:12.000
districts and the local level activities become the leading forces and the leading drivers for the

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.360
full implementation of this process? I think that that needs to be considered, and the reason why

01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:23.360
I'm asking you to think about that is, at the state level, who your partners are and who your

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:30.240
community or collaborators are look very different than at the local level, when they start looking

01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:35.600
at their partners. When districts start looking around the community, they're not going to think

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:42.160
about these statewide groups that the superintendent named that are collaborating with the department,

01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:46.560
but they are going to need to look for the businesses and the local community leaders,

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:52.560
the fraternities, the sororities, all of those community groups that have some engagement in

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:58.800
some ways, even the barbershops and beauty shops, all of those people who get involved in the schools

01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:04.160
for a lot of different reasons, those are the groups that districts need to know to look for,

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:09.440
because that's where their natural allies are, and I think that those inflection points and those

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:15.520
differences at those inflection points need to be made plain and need to be made given some

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.480
appearance and awareness as well. Yeah, and let me just note that that's the kind of thing that's

01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:27.120
supposed to come back to us in January. So in an attempt to segue us from here to there, I think

01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:35.280
we've heard from all the folks who wanted to add comments from the board. I think there may be a

01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:43.440
couple of points that staff want to bring to our attention. I've got to note that maybe Deanna wants

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:50.400
to help us understand something about the flow of the grant process, if that's still the case.

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:57.360
Make a little room for that, and then we'll see if we can get to a motion.

01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:09.680
I really appreciate the feedback, because like I told a lot of our community partners in our

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:15.760
conversations, I think we're more closer aligned than what we think, like I think we're conscious

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:21.040
of sort of the process, how we need to be considerate of the system, but I love the point

01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:26.800
particularly from Member Glover and Son around the integration, like we have to be intentional

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.000
about that and also making sure we can be explicit, and I think that's really our role

01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:38.240
in this process. So I want to make sure that when we leave this conversation that that's the plan

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:43.840
and that's what we can produce when we get to sort of the next update. So thank you for the feedback.

01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:51.280
All I was going to do is make a point of clarification about the advisory council,

01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:57.920
the proposed advisory council, and our relationship with the board and around grant awards.

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:04.000
It's the board that would approve the grant awards, not an advisory council. So just a

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:10.080
point of order. Okay, yeah, that must have been a comment that came by. I think one of the things

01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:16.640
that's clear by the representation from the department by Superintendent Thurmond and

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:24.080
Dr. Lee and the set of folks who are all working on this makes clear is how much the department is

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:30.400
taking this as a central activity, which I think bodes well for the coherence and integration

01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:36.080
concerns that have been raised, and I think we really appreciate that it really is being

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:43.920
considered a department-wide activity. So we're looking forward to that. I think we heard the

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:50.480
point that there was a lot of good information in the memo that may also be part of the communication

01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:57.440
going forward that we want to be sure that that good thinking is also getting communicated to the

01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:03.200
field as well as some of the points that have been raised here. We know the department staff is really

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:10.320
busy doing all of this work to get get ready for the, you know, expectation that people have that

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:17.280
there will be some resources that reach the field before next school year. So that is so that,

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:24.000
in fact, that capacity building can begin. So anyway, I want to just thank the department again

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:30.480
for all of the energy to date and all that will follow. We know you're hearing and listening on

01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:40.080
a mega scale to both these comments and to others, and I want to see if we are ready for a motion.

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:52.080
Do we want to put the slide back up with the resolution that was proposed?

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.080
There we go.

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:14.320
So, oh, member Escobedo, you, I see you have a new hand up.

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:20.720
Yes, I would like to motion to approve the California Department of Education recommendation

01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:27.920
of the California Community Schools Partnership Program, proposed application process and

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:38.000
administration plan, namely to grant the RFA timeline, the regional TAC RFA timeline and

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:46.560
basic contract eligibility and requirements and broad community engagement and listening process.

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:51.200
Thank you. Member Rodriguez?

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:52.560
I would like to second the motion.

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.600
Thank you. Is there any further discussion?

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.840
Member Rucker, is your hand up a new or is it still up from before?

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:05.760
It's still up from before. I apologize.

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:12.080
That's okay. Just checking. Any further discussion? If not, we'll take a vote on the

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.800
motion and Brooks, can you please take the roll call vote? Member Bonacca?

01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:19.760
Aye. Member Burr?

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.720
Aye. President Darling-Hammond?

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:25.360
Aye. Member Escobedo?

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.400
Aye. Member Glover-Woods?

01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:31.600
Yes. Member McQuillin?

01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:34.960
Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson?

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.080
Yes. Member Rodriguez?

01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:40.640
Yes. Member Rucker?

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.760
Yes. Vice President Strauss?

01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:46.160
Yes. Member Son?

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:49.600
Aye. The motion passes unanimously.

01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:56.320
Thank you. And we're ready for a break. Is there anything else you wanted to say,

01:58:56.320 --> 01:59:00.080
Superintendent Thurmond, before we get our cup of coffee?

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:05.360
I won't separate you from the cup of coffee. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond and members

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:13.040
of the board for your action just now. I think that the conversation was welcomed. It reflects

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:18.000
what we hear every time we talk about this with any community partner. There are great hopes and

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:22.960
dreams that everyone has for the community schools initiative. We take your feedback.

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:27.040
We've jotted down lots of notes about the things that you said, and we'll be delving into it

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:31.120
further. So we want to thank you for that. We are thinking about how we do this well,

01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:35.440
and we're also thinking about sustainability. This should not be a one and done conversation.

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:38.960
This should not be that when every grant dollar has been used, there are no longer

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:42.720
any Morris community schools. This should be something that becomes part of the fabric of

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:47.600
what happens in our schools. And for that reason, we care about what you all said about creating the

01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:53.360
tissue, the connective fiber to many of the existing strategies, and we'll continue to do

01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:58.240
that. I also just want to acknowledge that we've had a lot of help from the CDE Foundation to help

01:59:58.240 --> 02:00:03.040
us raise dollars to be able to do some of the coordination and to get research to support it.

02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:07.040
I want to acknowledge Jessica Howard and her staff and the folks at the CDE Foundation.

02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:11.600
There are many foundations that have been interested in this, and we're meeting with many

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:16.720
of them. They're interested in public-private partnerships and the sustainability and the

02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:20.320
braiding of funds to make this happen. So thank you for today's push and today's action,

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:24.000
and we'll be ready to report back to you as we go. Thank you, Madam President,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.720
and we'll see you on the next item. Terrific. Thank you so much. Let's take

02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:43.840
a 10-minute break, and we'll see you back at 1146. All right. Welcome back. Board members,

02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:48.160
we need to re-establish the quorum, so Brooks, can you please call the roll?

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:15.440
Here. Member Rucker.

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:18.720
Here. Vice President Strauss.

02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.040
Here. Member Son.

02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:29.600
Here. Everyone's present. We have a quorum. That's wonderful. We're going to item 18,

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:33.920
which is the new targets for the state performance plan indicators in the annual

02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:40.160
performance report for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004,

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:48.240
covering program years 2021 through 2025-26. The CDE recommends that we approve the proposed

02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.360
new targets covering those years, and this item will be presented by Heather Kalamis

02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:58.800
of the department and Mary Sandy of the California Commission on Teacher Production. Take it away.

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:07.440
Great. Thank you so much. A pleasure to be here today. Certainly time flies, and so we return

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:12.880
again to continue the conversation on the proposed state performance plan targets,

02:02:12.880 --> 02:02:17.280
along with an update from the CTC. During today's presentation,

02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.840
you will have a chance to hear about how California has progressed on recommendations made by the

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:28.160
Special Education Task Force from 2015, and an update from our partner, Mary Sandy, at the CTC.

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:33.360
We will then conclude the presentation with a recap of the proposed targets that we discussed

02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.960
that you saw last time, and discuss a few critical areas to our work of improving outcomes for

02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:46.400
students. The themes and recommendations surfaced in the report just six years ago remain as salient

02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:53.120
as ever, and so I think it's abundantly clear that the work of the task force report, the state

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:57.840
performance plan proposed targets, and all the investments and workgroups and reports that are

02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:05.520
ongoing currently all point and signal to a system, as I stated before, that is in need of

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:10.640
additional changes and shifts in order to improve our outcomes for students with disabilities across

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:17.360
the state. As a reminder, once approved, these targets will be submitted to OSEP in 2022

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:23.440
as part of our state performance plan and annual performance report. In January of 2022, you will

02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:29.040
hear how California students are progressing on the indicators, and what we do know is that we

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:34.800
will likely continue to see impacts on our data due to the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic,

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:43.200
but more on that in January. In 2013, a statewide task force on special education comprised of 34

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:48.160
representatives from key education partners embarked on a study to document the reason special

02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:54.240
education was not as successful and what must be changed in both policy and practice to ensure

02:03:54.960 --> 02:04:01.440
and improve services for all children identified under IDEA as having a disability. The result of

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:07.760
this work was a 2015 report entitled One System Reforming Education to Serve All Students, a

02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:14.000
report of California's statewide task force on special education. The culminating report published

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:21.200
by the task force in 2015 laid out a myriad of system reforms designed to improve educational

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:25.440
outcomes for students with disabilities. Additional information about the task force

02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:35.600
can be found in the March 9, 2015 memo on our website, but the report itself is now finalized

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:43.600
and will be posted on our website soon. Among the task force recommendations was an overarching

02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:48.720
conclusion that California's special education system would improve if general education and

02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:54.160
special education work seamlessly together as one coherent system designed to address the needs of

02:04:54.160 --> 02:05:01.600
all students. The 2015 One System Report also stated that improving how the state educates

02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:07.840
students with disabilities enhances education for all students as well. As you can see from the slide,

02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:13.360
the report addressed a number of broad topic areas, each one critical and important to the health

02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:22.880
of a high functioning special education system. And now I'll take a moment to walk through briefly

02:05:22.880 --> 02:05:30.560
each of the seven areas that the report looked at, made recommendations on, and along and recap

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:37.120
some of the milestones that the report had noted in terms of the time frame between 2015 and to date.

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:42.560
In terms of assessment accountability, the task force report called for improvements to how

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:47.120
California school teams set goals and assess the progress of students with disabilities.

02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:54.400
The report envisioned an individualized education program process that evolves and adapts to the

02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:59.920
changing landscape of education for all students. The report made the following recommendations,

02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:05.440
and I won't recap all of them, but just a few. Align IEP goals to the current California state

02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.880
standards, keep parents informed of the changes in standards, the rationale for those changes,

02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:15.200
the implications for IEPs and courses of study, and strategies for supporting

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:20.480
children at home. Ensure teachers and schools are accountable for the progress that students

02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:25.360
with the most significant cognitive disabilities make in meeting the standards, and create and

02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:29.840
disseminate samples of standard aligned IEPs along with comprehensive training on adapting

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:38.560
those examples or models for use in IEP meetings. And finally, the report made a recommendation of

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:43.600
creating a common data gathering system to record and report on student IEP goals,

02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:48.240
monitor progress towards goals, and evaluate implementations of standard-based IEPs.

02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:54.480
And as you can see from the milestones before you hear, some of the ones that are captured,

02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:59.680
that the report captured in addition is the adoption of the California alternative assessment

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:03.440
designed for our students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

02:07:04.400 --> 02:07:11.040
We have seen the migration of the entire special education data system merge into CALPADS.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.720
There is a, or was, a current IEP template workgroup that just concluded. The report

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:23.760
is now finalized, and so that report does make several recommendations on not only

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:30.720
improving the IEP template in and of itself, but also making recommendations for improving

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:36.960
the IEP process. And additionally, there are, in terms of dashboard and differentiated assistance,

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:41.760
and also the special education governance and accountability study, which is also currently

02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:50.560
being finalized as well. In terms of family engagement, the report called for improvements

02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:55.120
to family and student engagement activities and opportunities which are critical to the

02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.040
school and life success of children with disabilities. The report made a few recommendations.

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:08.080
The first one is fully fund family empowerment centers, or FECs, statewide, as already legislated

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:15.440
at SB 511, so that each of the 32 FEC regions has a center. The second was increased funding

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:20.960
to those centers. And one of the third biggest ones was establish a data collection system to

02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:28.000
monitor the work done by the centers as well. And as we can see here in terms of the milestones,

02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:34.560
timely in the sense of this budget cycle has brought an expansion of funding to the family

02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:40.320
empowerment centers of roughly $6.6 million, the establishment of the family engagement

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:46.320
center office at CDE, and also there are new guidance and resources added to the local

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.320
control funding formula of priority three, family involvement. And then there's also

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:53.840
$150 million expansion of alternative dispute resolution as well.

02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:01.600
In terms of special education financing, the report called for improvements to special

02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:07.840
education financing that provides the necessary resources necessary to address the following,

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:11.760
meeting the needs of all students with disabilities, encouraging greater coherence

02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:16.320
between general education, special education that is sensitive to changes in enrollment

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:21.280
and investments in the systems and provides incentives for practices that will eventually

02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:27.600
lead to greater outcomes for students. The report made the following recommendations,

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:33.440
equalize the state's support for special education across California by overhauling the system of

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:38.080
special education financing to give schools and districts more control over how they spend

02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:41.520
their money and to hold them accountable for adequately meeting the needs of students with

02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:46.560
disabilities. Ensure the availability of early intervention programs and services for all

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:50.800
eligible students with disabilities and address the disparity of early intervention programs

02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:54.160
and services among early childhood care and education entities.

02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:01.600
And finally, and again this list is not inclusive, but expand ADR resources,

02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:06.400
supports and services throughout the state as well. And just a couple of the milestones

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:12.240
captured here, increasing the base rate for pupil base rate for special education programs.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:18.560
There is a $656 million allocation for new and ongoing funding for special education.

02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:22.640
And again, looking at the alignment of funding and programs for early learning and care.

02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:31.520
In terms of early learning, the task force described early learning as essential to providing

02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.520
the inclusive runway for children with disabilities as they enter the education system.

02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:40.800
The report made some of the following recommendations. Increased coordination and

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.200
access to high quality early care and preschool for all students, especially for students with

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.080
disabilities, children who grow up in poverty and children who are dual language learners

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:56.080
with access not dependent upon geography or service provider. Increased funding to provide

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:00.800
equitable financial support to high quality early care and education and support equity of access

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:07.600
for children with disabilities throughout the state. And again, finally, articulate family

02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:14.480
friendly protocols for transitioning between Part C and Part B services. And as you can see here,

02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:21.920
the milestones to date that have been captured by the report is the prioritized expansion of

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:28.000
the Supporting Inclusive Practices Program or SIP. As many of you know, that project has been

02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:33.680
receiving an additional $15 million of funding over the next five years through this budget cycle.

02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:37.040
And then increased focus and efforts on training of the preschool

02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:43.920
learning foundations. There is the master plan for early learning and care. And then expanded

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.560
support to embedded instruction throughout the Inclusive Early Education Expansion Program.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:12:00.960
Evidence based school and classroom practices. The task force report described evidence based

02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:04.880
practices as essential to providing the inclusive learning opportunities for students with

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.480
disabilities. The report made the following recommendations. Universal Design for Learning

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:15.920
or UDL is implemented and established as critical as a critical area in professional learning for

02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:21.760
educator training and has a broad understanding in all schools. That MTSS is developed throughout

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:27.840
the state incorporating robust and aligned systems at all organizational levels that support response

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:33.920
to instruction and intervention approaches and systematic programs of academic behavioral and

02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:40.320
social emotional learning. That general education resources are used to intervene as early as

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.240
possible with evidence based and multi-tiered social emotional supports

02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:48.560
before a referral to special education services among others.

02:12:53.280 --> 02:12:59.520
Sorry, in terms of the updates that the report highlighted in terms is noting that there should

02:12:59.520 --> 02:13:05.200
be prioritized and enhanced access to the MTSS framework throughout through the scaling up

02:13:05.840 --> 02:13:12.720
multi-tiered system of supports or SUMS initiative. That there's currently funding allocated to the

02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.000
California Teacher Workforce Investment Grant and awarded to the California Coalition for Inclusive

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:23.360
Literacy and that there are statewide coordination efforts throughout the state through the statewide

02:13:23.360 --> 02:13:28.160
system of support including the self-improvement and content leads to implement evidence based

02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:35.680
practices for students with disabilities. And finally, the last bucket is educator

02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:40.960
preparation and professional learning. The report described educator professional educator

02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:46.720
preparation and professional learning as a coherent approach to educator preparation and

02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.360
learning a common foundation for all instruction or a common trunk and multiple pathways for

02:13:51.360 --> 02:13:56.400
teachers to earn a credential. California's system of teacher credentialing would ensure

02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:01.120
that all teachers both general and special education enter the profession able to effectively

02:14:01.120 --> 02:14:05.920
use needs-based interventions and collaborate with other educators in a unified system.

02:14:06.560 --> 02:14:11.200
The report made just a few of the following recommendations that general and special education

02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:16.400
preparation programs should require all aspiring teachers to master content standards, evidence

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:21.520
based strategies, pedagogy, intervention strategies, and collaboration amongst teachers across

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:28.800
assignments, especially in a common trunk of preparation between general and special educators.

02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:32.720
That special education credentials should be designed to prepare teachers and address the

02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:38.640
instructional needs of all students and not just specific disability types and at the same time

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:43.520
specific authorizations for educating students with low incidence disabilities, students who

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:47.440
have lost their hearing or vision and for example should remain critically valuable to the component

02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:52.000
of special education. And just a few of the updates in terms of the milestones that have

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:56.400
been achieved since then there's significant investment in the Golden State Golden State

02:14:56.400 --> 02:15:03.280
teacher grant program for students enrolled in the California teacher credential California

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:07.520
commission on teacher credentialing approved teacher preparation programs who is mouthful.

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:13.200
The development of the 21st century California school leadership academy to provide high quality

02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:18.640
professional learning opportunities to LEAs and then professional learning opportunities

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:22.960
for paraprofessionals through the supporting inclusive practices or SIP project.

02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:32.320
Last time I discussed the factors or conditions that are at play in our highly complex system

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:36.960
so this slide should be familiar and I want to take a moment to focus on the first factor

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:42.640
or condition that has now reached beyond crisis levels. A highly skilled,

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:47.840
trained and supported teacher workforce is foundational to student success and not only that

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:55.920
we often have seen that a lack of teachers a supply issue often ends up in diminished

02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.360
outcomes for students with disabilities and students placed in more restrictive settings.

02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:04.400
The California teacher the California commission on teacher credentialing or CTC

02:16:04.400 --> 02:16:09.920
has been instrumental in bringing about a forward-thinking approach to ensure every

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.280
teacher across California has a pathway that we hope will be a fruitful and enriching career.

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:19.920
Joining me today is Mary Sandy who is the executive director of the California

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:24.000
commission on teacher credentialing and Mary will provide an update on the milestones achieved

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:30.080
to date on teacher preparation and discuss the work ahead and Mary I'll turn it over to you.

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:37.120
Thank you so much Heather so are will you remember these lines for me

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:44.560
okay terrific thank you so much. Good morning or good afternoon at this point Madam President,

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:50.000
members of the board, Superintendent Thurmond and colleagues it's really a pleasure to join you

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:54.800
and have this moment to reflect on the extraordinary amount of work that we've done

02:16:55.600 --> 02:17:02.880
since the special education task force report was produced. Next slide please I'm really quite proud

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:09.840
of the of the work that we did this was a collaborative effort co-sponsored by the

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:14.080
state board of education the department of education and the commission on teacher credentialing.

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:20.320
It's evidence that when the three agencies come together with a focus there are amazing things

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:27.200
that we can do and the frame that really I think centers this report especially for our work at

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:33.600
the commission can be captured in this quote in a coherent system of education all children are

02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:39.760
considered general education students first and all educators regardless of which students they

02:17:39.760 --> 02:17:45.200
are assigned to serve have a collective responsibility to see that all children receive

02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:50.720
the education and supports they need to maximize their development and potential

02:17:50.720 --> 02:17:56.720
so that they can participate meaningfully in the nation's economy and democracy. It's a bit of a

02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.360
rallying flag for the work that that I know we've been doing here at the commission and I know that

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:08.720
the department has been doing as well. Next slide please and as Heather already kind of gave the

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:14.720
broad scope here this was a bold report and a bold blueprint or plan for how to bring a

02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:21.120
coordinated systemic set of changes to bear in special education to improve outcomes for our

02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:26.880
students with disabilities. I won't go over these topics again but the scope of this work was

02:18:26.880 --> 02:18:35.360
extensive. Next slide and in educator preparation and professional learning as Heather has already

02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.320
summarized briefly we were really guided by this particular frame that California's system of

02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:45.840
teacher credentialing needs to ensure that all teachers both general education and special

02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:52.480
education enter the profession able to effectively use needs-based interventions and collaborate

02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:58.880
with other educators in a unified system. That seems like it should be patently obvious that

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:02.640
that's what we're doing in schools but it really is patently obvious that we're not doing this

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:09.040
in the schools as well as we need to. Three of the big ideas that came out of this report focused

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:14.960
for credentialing had to do first of all with establishing this common trunk of preparation

02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:21.760
that all teachers general education and special education could experience together. Secondly

02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:26.320
this concept that special education teachers should be preparing teachers to address the

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:31.440
instructional needs of all students and not focus specifically only on disability types

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:38.320
but to look across the the array and intensity of means and maintain specialized credentials

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:45.440
for low incidence areas where we need them. Finally this notion of what special educators

02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:51.680
should be authorized to do the report envisioned special educator teachers being prepared and

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:57.760
authorized to instruct and provide any needed support to general education students as well

02:19:57.760 --> 02:20:03.680
as students with disabilities. This really is a kind of platform from MTSS and the kinds of

02:20:03.680 --> 02:20:08.480
settings we're putting together where teachers are working together to serve students

02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:16.160
in a very comprehensive way. Next slide please. So I want to talk a little bit about the context

02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:25.200
in which this report landed and go a little deeper on some of the supply demand and capacity issues

02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:31.920
that were present in 2015 when this report came out and really prior to 2015 when class size

02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:37.440
reduction was enacted in 1998 there was an immediate shortage of teachers to staff the

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:43.840
classrooms that needed to be needed to be staffed. We hit a high point of 45,000 emergency permit

02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:51.840
holders working in our schools before we really caught up with that and there was significant

02:20:51.840 --> 02:20:58.560
state investment to grow teacher preparation program capacity and that was a really critical

02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:04.800
part of bringing trying to bring the shortages. We almost eradicated them with the state investment

02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:10.480
strategy at the time. We moved from 45,000 emergency permit holders to less than 2,000

02:21:11.040 --> 02:21:16.640
being issued annually and that was an extraordinary victory in terms of making sure we had fully

02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:23.040
prepared teachers working in our classrooms. Also while class size reduction was being enacted the

02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:28.880
commission had undergone a revision in its special education credential and one of the things that

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:35.360
happened at that time that may have have contributed to many of the issues we're facing right now

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:41.920
was a separation within the special education credential used to be used to require that a

02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:46.720
teacher hold a general education credential first and that they add the special education

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:53.280
credential on top of that and what that led to was a teacher who was fully able prepared

02:21:54.160 --> 02:22:00.400
and able to work across all settings in schools. The shortages led to a policy change where the

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:06.480
commission separated these credentials and what emerged from that was more siloed preparation

02:22:07.200 --> 02:22:12.560
teachers who were not coming in and drawing from the same core sets of knowledge skills and abilities

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:18.480
to work in the schools and while there may have been some short-term gains in terms of some in some

02:22:18.480 --> 02:22:23.920
of the numbers of special educators being credentialed the long-term effect has been

02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:29.360
significant and I think corrosive to the work that we need our teachers to be able to do and some of

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:35.520
this is captured of you know following the you know that high point of investment where we almost

02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:43.280
eradicated teacher shortages but getting down to facts report documented and that came out in 2018

02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:50.800
documented that between 2001 and 2017 overall teacher preparation enrollments in California

02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:58.320
for all subjects declined by more than 70 percent 70 percent that's significant.

02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:04.240
During the recession 30 special education programs were put on moratorium status

02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:10.000
or reduced in size and four programs were eliminated outright two in moderate to severe

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.400
disabilities and two in early childhood special education getting down to facts further documented

02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:25.120
that between 2015-16 and 2016-17 13.4 percent of teachers teaching in special education schools

02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:31.600
left the profession or the state and another 7.3 percent moved between schools within California

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:38.080
combined more than one out of every five teachers teaching in special education schools left their

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:46.560
position which was more than any other subject. Next slide please. So where are we today with

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:55.360
shortages and and and it's still it continues to be significant. We are seeing that we are issuing

02:23:55.520 --> 02:24:02.480
as many intern emergency permit and waiver documents allowing teachers to teach as we

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:12.800
are preliminary credentials it's almost 50-50 right now. In 2018-19 we issued 13,340 new teaching

02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:17.600
credentials to teachers fully prepared they are in preliminary credentials and moved into the schools

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:23.840
and 13,912 intern credentials emergency permits and waivers.

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:31.600
In special education this is it's the situation is even worse the commission issued 3,300 new

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.720
teaching credentials and over 5,000 intern credentials emergency permits and waivers.

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:41.200
We're staffing our classrooms with people who are underprepared for the work and we're staffing

02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:47.200
those classrooms and in significant ways that that are impacting opportunities for children.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:53.760
Two out of every three new special education recruits enter the field without having completed

02:24:53.760 --> 02:25:01.760
preparation that's significant this is special education this this work is is not not for the

02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:08.720
underprepared all right so since 2015 the commission has approved 10 new education specialist

02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:14.800
intern programs sponsored in most for the most part by local education agencies so from the time

02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:21.120
of reduction and moratorium we've begun to build back but we are nowhere near the enrollments that

02:25:21.120 --> 02:25:27.520
we were in that we had or the capacity and preparation that we had when we almost eradicated

02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:33.680
the shortage it's interesting to note that the growth is occurring most rapidly in terms of

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:39.600
numbers of new programs and the development of internship programs there's some very many strong

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:47.200
intern programs that can really assist teachers in training to learn their work and to to to be

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:52.000
effective in the classroom but it's more challenging than a student teaching based program

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:56.480
where you have the opportunity to see expert teachers teach and and have more practice

02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:02.080
opportunities than you do when you're the teacher of record. Employers are reporting to us they're

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:07.200
actually reporting to the department of education and we we look at it every year the need to to

02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:12.640
hire about 20,000 teachers every every year and that number stayed pretty stable over last several

02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:19.840
years of reporting. California institutions are producing less than half that number of fully

02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:28.160
prepared teachers so from the get-go where California is not preparing the number of teachers

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.600
needed to meet the demand that employers are expressing to us we are currently receiving

02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:40.000
about 20 to 25 percent of our new teachers are coming from out of state. Next slide please.

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.320
So this graphic simply shows you the comparison between the dark blue column which is new

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:52.880
preliminary or clear credentials and the the furthest to the to the left excuse me yeah the

02:26:52.880 --> 02:27:01.040
furthest to the left columns are all teachers special education you can see 3,300 in the dark

02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:07.200
blue 5,000 in the light blue column interns permits and waivers and then math and special

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:12.160
and then math and special education. So moving to the next slide please.

02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:20.880
What's interesting when we look at we just take the the slice of these data and look at the

02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:26.080
intern permit and waiver population of teachers these are teachers who have not been fully prepared

02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.600
interns are getting are in a program and are getting support and supervision and weekly

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:37.760
engagement with their program and with their employers but these constitute the under prepared

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:46.160
workforce the the largest proportion for each year has been to folks receiving emergency permits

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:50.400
and waivers and not interns so we're sending a lot of people into the schools who are not prepared

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:59.360
to do this work. Moving to the next slide please. So what have we been doing you know at the

02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:04.160
commission since the task force report was established the commission has undertaken a

02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:09.520
significant overhaul of its teacher preparation standards for general education for special

02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:15.200
education and now we are in the process of of updating and overhauling our standards for early

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:23.600
childhood education. In 2016 we adopted new standards for general ed 2018 we restructured

02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.480
the special ed credential and adopted new standards for it we have built and developed

02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:31.920
performance assessments to go with these programs and I'm going to talk a little bit

02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:41.760
more about that in the next slide. So a significant driver of change in the general education

02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:47.840
standards for teacher preparation has been driving inclusive practices into the center

02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:53.680
of preparation of our general education teachers this was a major theme and a major call out by

02:28:53.680 --> 02:28:58.000
the task force and the report that inclusion is not a special education issue it's a general

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:06.400
education issue and moving back to the concept and driven ever by the the call that all teachers

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:11.760
are teachers of all students and all students are general education students first and all

02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:17.440
students need intervention at different times inclusion was the the primary set of changes

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:23.600
in the gen ed space. We focus in these standards on establishing and maintaining inclusive learning

02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:30.240
environments really looking at the environment of universal design for learning is a required

02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:36.160
element of teacher preparation and our performance assessments learning about and working within

02:29:36.160 --> 02:29:42.080
learning how to work within a multi-tiered system of support the use of technology to enhance

02:29:43.040 --> 02:29:47.920
access to instruction including assistive technology for diverse learning learners

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.120
providing supportive learning environments for students with disabilities who may also be

02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:59.360
english learners monitoring progress on IEPs this is this is all work that gen ed teachers

02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:05.040
are now required to to engage in as they as they work toward a credential but I think a primary

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:11.280
theme here is adapting their instructional practice we really have taken that model to heart in the

02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:16.000
standards of how we prepare teachers that you will are ever you know what you're doing as a teacher

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.320
you you set out with a plan but you must be ready to adapt your practice to incorporate and recognize

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:27.280
the assets that your students bring to the learning moment and to adjust your instructional

02:30:27.280 --> 02:30:31.440
practices to meet the needs that these students bring so that's what we've done in general ed

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:36.480
and we have programs that have been up and running for several years now in this way moving to the

02:30:36.480 --> 02:30:44.880
next slide in special education the structure of the credential itself was changed we moved

02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:50.720
from having seven distinct special education credentials to having five of them the language

02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:56.800
and academic development and physical and health impairment credential areas had such we I think

02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:03.280
we had one preparation program in each of those areas the low incidence lack of opportunity to

02:31:03.280 --> 02:31:10.000
to be prepared in those areas led to a necessary incorporation of that content into the other five

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:17.280
remaining credentials so now we we issue a mild to moderate support needs extensive support needs

02:31:17.280 --> 02:31:22.800
deaf and hard of hearing visual impairments and early childhood special education set of credentials

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:28.720
there's a significant transition from the focus on specific disability categories

02:31:28.720 --> 02:31:35.840
to the idea that of intensity of support needs from mild to moderate to extensive support needs

02:31:35.840 --> 02:31:41.600
where teachers are prepared to work across all disability areas with a with a difference in the

02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:49.760
level of intensity and the types of services that students needs in the classroom so there's also an

02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:55.200
additional emphasis and focus on language development communication behavior support

02:31:55.200 --> 02:31:59.840
and additional knowledge to support students across disability categories so these new

02:31:59.840 --> 02:32:06.480
standards were adopted in 2018 they incorporate the general education performance expectations

02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:12.000
as the core as the common trunk this is maybe the most significant change we've made in these two

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:20.960
credential areas and that is to establish a set of universal teaching performance expectations

02:32:20.960 --> 02:32:28.080
that all teachers are prepared in on their way to getting a credential moving to the next slide

02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:36.080
teaching performance assessments have been a tool that we've been working with in California for 20

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:41.040
years initially we were funded with a federal grant to develop a performance assessment

02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:47.760
using the national board for professional teaching standards as a as a as a kind of model for the kind

02:32:47.760 --> 02:32:53.520
of of reflective work that teachers should be able to do we've built performances assessment

02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:58.800
performance assessments and in the last six years we've updated those we had and expanded our

02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:06.400
capacity tpas are embedded in coursework and in clinical practice and they have been developed

02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:12.080
and updated so that candidates can demonstrate the first their ability to use universal design

02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:17.520
for learning to plan instruction where they're focusing both on the assets that students bring

02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:23.840
and the needs that they bring to the learning moment in general education the teachers who

02:33:23.840 --> 02:33:28.960
take the tpa are required to take a look at the students in their clinical practice

02:33:28.960 --> 02:33:34.720
and identify a student who's an english learner a student with disabilities or exceptional needs

02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:40.560
and a student with life experiences that might impact their learning and do some analytic work

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:46.800
here what are the assets and needs and how will i use those things as i design a lesson or as a

02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:54.240
unit of instruction using udl as the guide for how to do that and then they so they're required

02:33:54.240 --> 02:34:00.560
to develop in a planning segment how they're going to attend to those needs they're also

02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:08.320
required in this tpa to teach and record their teaching to evaluate and reflect on what happened

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:13.920
in the teaching of the lesson that i designed who got it who didn't get it and to determine what

02:34:13.920 --> 02:34:17.680
they're going to do next how are they going to apply what they learned from doing this this is

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:25.440
the plan teach assess reflect apply habit of mind that we're really trying to inculcate in teachers

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:29.520
through teacher preparation through performance assessments so that this becomes the way in which

02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:36.000
they approach their instruction the special education form of tpa follows the same dna as

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:41.600
the general education building off of the common trunk of preparation the special education

02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:47.680
candidates of course are focused on students with ieps they are asked to demonstrate how

02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:52.240
they communicate and collaborate with and co-teach with other educators which is a critical part of

02:34:52.240 --> 02:34:58.400
that work and they also are expected to include families guardians in their the educational

02:34:58.400 --> 02:35:04.320
process and talk about how they're incorporating that into their work so tpas have been a major

02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:10.800
tool for us to organize clinical practice and to really help teachers move from the abstract to

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:16.800
the concrete and demonstrate their skill before they get a potential so moving to the next slide

02:35:16.800 --> 02:35:27.840
please so we currently have 141 education specialist programs that are in the process of

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:34.080
redesign to meet our new standards they are being offered by 70 institutions across the state

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:39.600
68 of them are focused on mild to moderate support needs and we'll offer that program

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:49.040
47 of them are focused on the extensive support needs credential 46 of these programs are focusing

02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:54.560
specifically on both mild to moderate support needs and extensive support needs we have 18

02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:59.520
programs in development for early childhood special education six for deaf of heart deaf and

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:03.360
hard of hearing and two for visual impairments next slide please

02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:13.680
back to the concept of dual credential pathways and looking for ways to to get back to some of

02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:19.840
the important things that we lost when we separated these credentials we currently have 12 programs

02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:26.320
these that are listed on the slide who are these these programs and institutions have been offering

02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:32.080
dual credential programs all along and as they're redesigning they are designing that as part of

02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:40.400
their their new program as well next slide we did a survey just in the last couple of weeks of the

02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:46.400
70 institutions offering these 141 programs that are in redesign just to ask them you know to what

02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:52.240
extent are you blending preparation for your general ed and your special ed candidates so

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.280
they're taking the same coursework big goal of the task force report big goal of our standards and

02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:04.000
teacher ed reform we also asked them how many of them are are pursuing dual credential pathways

02:37:04.720 --> 02:37:11.360
41 of those 70 institutions responded and 32 of them said they they either have been or are

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:17.600
designing their programs to enable this general and special education co-experience of common

02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:24.240
courses 17 of these 41 programs are designing new programs or continuing their programs that

02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.400
include the dual credential pathways they've expressed some challenges to us as they're in

02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:35.280
the process of of redesign they are of course working within many institutions where these

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.640
programs have been siloed and getting the special education and the general education faculty into a

02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:47.200
collaborative space to co-design is more challenging in some places than others staffing is an issue

02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:51.760
that some of them have also raised while some programs have faculty from general ed and special

02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:57.520
education co-teaching common courses others are struggling to figure out how they finance that how

02:37:57.520 --> 02:38:03.600
they staff or operationalize this approach they are one year away from having to be offering these

02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:09.200
new programs so they're still in the in the final design phases but but getting ready to to be

02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:14.640
reviewed and so it's still moving it's not completely settled and stable yet many of our

02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.880
preliminary preparation programs are offering intern pathways and some of them are expressing

02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:23.680
to us concern about how do we go for a dual credential in general education and special

02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:29.360
education if our special ed candidate is in a special ed assignment and they're trying to figure

02:38:29.360 --> 02:38:35.280
out how at the local level they can get the kinds of cross-pollination and and clinical experience

02:38:35.280 --> 02:38:41.200
they need to to add both credentials but they're working on it there's not disinterest there's

02:38:41.200 --> 02:38:47.520
interest so moving to the next slide please i wanted to give you a couple of quick examples

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:52.800
Loyola Marymount University has put together a combined coursework sequence that's listed on

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:58.880
this slide they've got they've identified five courses that are common trunk courses teaching

02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:06.720
english learners access inclusion and belonging cross-content methods elementary literacy equity

02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:11.600
and diversity and then they have five additional courses that are education specialist only they

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:17.360
focus on the practice the the field work component of this digging in around evidence-based assessment

02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.480
practices to promote student learning and working on effective environments in support of student

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:28.480
learning what's important about the common experience here and the opportunity for all

02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:33.680
teachers in preparation to think about teaching english learners together is that they develop

02:39:33.760 --> 02:39:39.200
this understanding of each other's practice and the continuum of services and instructional

02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:45.760
strategies that are used to to support our our children with disabilities and and this is a

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:53.360
really critical piece that we're driving toward next slide please the California alliance for

02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.400
inclusive schooling is a group that has come together under the leadership of the CSU chancellor's

02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:03.600
office and the thompson policy institute a chapman university that's really focusing in the in the

02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:10.160
teacher education community on how to maximize inclusive practices and they received funding

02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:15.680
from cedar which is a national technical assistance center funded by the u.s department of education

02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:24.560
special education programs they issued us eight mini grants uh two years ago to stimulate uh work

02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:28.800
in in either combining your course work or working toward dual credentials

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:35.680
so long beach um used their their mini grant to to develop and work on their urban dual credential

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:40.720
program it's a pathway that's a two-year pathway where candidates earn both a multiple subject

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:46.400
and the education specialist credential it can be completed either as a post-baccalaureate

02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:51.600
program or as integrated within a bachelor's degree or alongside a bachelor's degree program

02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:56.960
they complete their credential courses at an elementary school site with a cohort beginning

02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:02.320
every fall they complete 12 units of student teaching in a high need urban school setting

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:07.680
alongside their mentor teachers in two-year clinical placement model i i went and visited

02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:12.640
this particular program and i just have to say that the students and the candidates that i met

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:19.600
in this program inspired me if ever you despair you should go and visit a program like this

02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:25.920
uh because the energy and excitement and drive that these young people have for this work

02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:30.320
is is profoundly important and i asked them and this is a room full there might have been

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:35.840
40 or 50 candidates in the room and i asked them all right you're going for both credentials

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.080
if you're offered a job as a special education teacher or a gen ed teacher which one are you

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.600
going to pick the vast majority said they would pick special education it was heartening and

02:41:45.600 --> 02:41:51.840
exciting to see and to see their collaboration across across each other moving along to another

02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:58.400
example next slide please uc santa barbara also received a mini grant and they've been focusing

02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:04.000
on infusing new content into their existing courses and how they're supervising uh candidates

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:10.480
in the field their faculty are working together in teams to develop course materials uh working

02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:16.000
on a collaborative supervision model um and a series of co-taught course sessions so they

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:21.120
really have taken this seriously as well and are using the grant to good effect next slide

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:26.400
because i'm running a little bit out of time i think getting close to the end um the university

02:42:26.400 --> 02:42:31.760
of laverne is another case where they have have used their mini grant to uh to really deepen their

02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:38.160
partnerships with local schools where they use do their clinical practice and co-teaching their

02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:43.680
their uh their common trunk forces are taught by ed specialist faculty and general and faculty

02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:50.320
together to great effect moving on to the next slide i just want to quickly say that the story

02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:57.040
that i drew earlier about shortages is dire and it would be extremely uh dire if we didn't have

02:42:57.040 --> 02:43:03.040
the kind of investments that we've had and and that are available right now in the last several

02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:08.000
years we we had a 10 million dollar grant fund that to support the development of undergraduate

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:15.520
pathways for stem and special ed we issued 41 grants of 250 thousand dollars each for planning

02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:21.200
two institutions that had these programs they developed 90 distinct program pathways 18 of

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:27.600
them in special education we had 400 students enrolled in the 1920 year across all program

02:43:27.680 --> 02:43:34.640
types 95 of them in special education 13 degree and credentials issued to date in special education

02:43:35.440 --> 02:43:40.640
50 million dollars for local solution grants funding to support the hiring of 3600 teachers

02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:46.560
in special education also very successful program and very popular with the local education agencies

02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.680
where they could use these funds for loan repayment they could offer that to the to their new hires

02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:57.760
signing bonuses stipends the extra stipends for special education teachers etc more than

02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:02.960
2000 individual candidates have participated or teachers have participated in this program to date

02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.800
45 million dollars for the classified school employee teacher grant this has been a very

02:44:08.800 --> 02:44:18.400
popular grant program we have 44 lea is currently funded to support 2260 classified staff 13 more

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:24.160
than 1300 have been credentialed so far 619 of them in special education this program has

02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:29.040
125 million dollars beginning this year for expansion next slide

02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:38.640
51 million dollars was made available initially to support teacher residency grant programs

02:44:38.640 --> 02:44:45.200
37 grants were issued to date 234 residents were enrolled last year just under half of

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:52.000
them in special education 70 are completing their programs in a year others are in are taking 18

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:58.800
months if they're adding special education 70 of the residents enrolled in this program self

02:44:58.800 --> 02:45:03.520
identify as people of color so we're having removing the needle on diversifying the teaching

02:45:03.520 --> 02:45:10.240
profession key goal also that's similar statistic available for the classified grant program

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:15.760
um we have 350 million dollars in our budget to give away over the next five years which

02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:22.160
will support up to 13 000 residents critical program critical strategy for lea's experiencing

02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:27.760
shortages additionally there's the 500 million dollar grant fund for the golden state teacher

02:45:27.760 --> 02:45:35.120
grant that'll support up to 25 000 teachers coming in over the over the coming years next next slide

02:45:35.120 --> 02:45:35.440
please

02:45:38.240 --> 02:45:44.720
so in you know in summary we took the task force report seriously we were faced with conditions

02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:54.080
that were dire as we saw the reduction of capacity from the class size reduction high point

02:45:54.080 --> 02:45:59.600
to to today those those reductions in capacity have been significant and they're still with us

02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:04.960
we believe in the credentialing process we've set the stage to prepare the teachers that we need for

02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:12.720
our students in a common uh trunk of preparation with areas of specialization and the ability to

02:46:12.720 --> 02:46:19.600
move seamlessly into mtss settings and this is important stage setting and moving on to the final

02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:26.560
slide i just want to end with some what are some next steps that that we think are necessary in

02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:34.480
order to really um turn the corner first of all the data i shared with you earlier it it

02:46:34.480 --> 02:46:39.200
definitely suggests if it doesn't shout that we need to double the number of teachers coming

02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:44.240
through teacher preparation programs in california if we're going to address shortages and and uh

02:46:44.240 --> 02:46:50.800
keep up with demand uh secondly that and and what's what is going to be required there is to really

02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:56.880
build institutional capacity or to rebuild it if you will to prepare special education teachers

02:46:57.520 --> 02:47:01.840
multiple subject teachers are another area of shortage and with uh universal transition

02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:09.360
kindergarten coming down the pike that situation could get worse if we don't begin to really

02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:13.600
make sure our our preparation programs can produce the numbers of teachers that we need

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:20.720
the expansion of mtss is really also quite necessary we need more clinical practices

02:47:21.680 --> 02:47:28.400
practice sites and settings in mtss settings if we really want the workforce we're preparing to get

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:35.120
it and be able to work within it finding a way to incentivize the development of dual credential

02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:40.960
programs and blended preparation for general and special education teachers is also something

02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:47.040
uh that would be extremely useful and finally collectively we have to be thinking about in

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:53.280
problem solving around attrition in the teaching force across the board and particularly in special

02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:59.360
education and as has been quoted to me as recently as last night if we can cut our

02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:05.520
attrition in half we will address the teacher shortage so thank you so much for giving me

02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:10.240
the opportunity to join heather in this presentation and i'll turn it back over to you now

02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:13.200
you know

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:23.840
great thank you so much mary um it's it's clear the numbers are um astonishing um that that you

02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:28.800
um you know to walk us through the beginning of the beginning of your presentation but you know i

02:48:28.800 --> 02:48:37.040
think it's it's extremely encouraging to to to see and hear and know um the uh the ctc is is um sort

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:44.880
of leading the charge and ensuring that um you know our our workforce our workforce um is is poised

02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.240
to sort of meet the challenges ahead in terms of ensuring that we have a high quality um highly

02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:56.640
trained teacher in in every single special education classroom so um and now just it's it's you know i

02:48:56.640 --> 02:49:05.280
want to spend some time um sort of shifting our focus back into the proposed um indicators um and

02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:11.440
really talk about sort of what's next and sort of what's important for for us to focus on in order

02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:16.480
to improve some of those outcomes as mary has indicated um you know teacher workforce is is

02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:23.600
critical to that um in terms of the solving the puzzle and so i'm glad that we were able to to

02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:32.320
capture that conversation here today and so we believe that a successful school experience is

02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:37.600
heavily influenced by an educational setting or least restrictive environment as we term it

02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:43.680
students that begin in a highly segregated settings tend to stay in those restrictive

02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:48.720
settings over time throughout their educational career and as i stated at the last board meeting

02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:55.440
educational setting is often has a correlation or direct correlation to student behavior which

02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:01.760
oftentimes can result in removal from educational settings or removal into lesser i'm sorry more

02:50:01.760 --> 02:50:08.480
restrictive settings um you know as as we know um and so it's it's the iop team decision of how

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:14.320
supports and services will be provided is such an important conversation as we know um again that

02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:18.800
inappropriate settings lead to increased behaviors that can also lead to suspension and expulsion

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:26.400
therefore a lack of access to um curriculum and teaching and learning and again ensuring students

02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:31.200
are making progress towards statewide standards is also an indicator of how effective the supports

02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:36.640
and services are in providing the tools necessary for students to access the curriculum and as we

02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:41.200
head towards graduation ensuring our students are equipped with the skills and tools necessary to

02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:48.720
navigate post navigate life post school is a huge monumental task and requires the efforts of many

02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:54.320
both at the agency level and the local level to ensure that our students graduate high school

02:50:55.280 --> 02:51:00.560
and have a clear pathway ahead in terms of what that means for for their future and able to make

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:04.480
meaningful contributions to the community that they live in

02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:13.280
in terms of the targets themselves just want to recap um the uh the targets that we went through

02:51:14.160 --> 02:51:20.560
last time i will not walk through every single target but did want to provide just a brief

02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:28.480
overview of the trajectory that we have laid out over the next six years in terms of ensuring that

02:51:28.480 --> 02:51:36.480
we are one first and foremost creating rigorous targets as that is is obviously key to maintain

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:42.800
a high level of high standards in terms of what we expect um you know in terms of the performance

02:51:42.800 --> 02:51:49.520
for for our students and so just again don't want to walk through them all but did want to note

02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:56.880
note to you that in indicator three the third line down you see the the word various and various

02:51:56.880 --> 02:52:04.080
just denotes that if you remember last time that the that indicator now is split out into three

02:52:04.080 --> 02:52:11.200
grade levels four eight and eleven to to greater capture growth or or lack thereof growth and so

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:18.000
that information can be found in page 12 of your of your packet if you want to take a look at those

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:26.000
targets as well um did want to notice uh note as well that um the uh there are compliance targets

02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:32.400
that are set uh strictly by ossep and ossep set those targets and the california department of

02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:39.280
education um must must meet them and those are uh 4b suspension expulsion by race race and ethnicity

02:52:40.240 --> 02:52:44.960
nine which i'll scroll to the next one um disproportionate representation and ten

02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:52.240
disproportionate representation by disability categories 11 child find 12 early childhood

02:52:52.240 --> 02:52:57.040
transition and then 13 which is post-secondary transition so again those are set by ossep

02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:03.040
and the rest of those were set by the the group of educational partners

02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:06.560
that was convened by cde over over the previous years as well

02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:10.160
um

02:53:12.320 --> 02:53:19.280
i would just like to note that at about one o'clock our closed captioning um vendors are slated to

02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:28.400
leave so we should try to um move to uh public comment soon all right so uh last slide here in

02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:32.160
terms of just the targets um again those are in your packet and we reviewed those last time

02:53:32.880 --> 02:53:39.200
so again in terms of how will cde get to improved outcomes for students and really thinking about

02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:44.400
lre is the foundation of our theory of action right in terms of you know what what are sort

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:49.440
of critical factors in improving those outcomes one it constitutes the right the right placement

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:54.560
as i mentioned before in that place with the right supports and services and in that placement um

02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:57.680
not only are there the right supports and services but those are being delivered in a

02:53:57.680 --> 02:54:04.320
in a high quality manner and and in theory obviously a reduction in behavior should be

02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:09.040
occurring in classrooms and increased learning through achievement through through multiple

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:15.360
measures is is our goal and obviously graduation and and post-school achievement is is our end

02:54:15.360 --> 02:54:20.000
game to ensure again that the outcomes for our students in terms of facing facing life

02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:28.320
is is one in which there are choices for a student and there's also a a clear pathway ahead for them

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:35.680
as well in terms of how and again this slide was in in the last presentation monitoring and support

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:41.440
for students with disabilities our approach here again as you see on the triangle an inverted

02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:46.000
triangle how many las are in our intensive targeted in universal tiers which we

02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:52.160
um uh annually designate lea's each january into into those tiers and then obviously

02:54:52.160 --> 02:54:58.880
the related support that they receive either from the cde or from our ta partners out in the field

02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:07.360
as well in terms of our focus on least restrictive environment here again lea selected for intensive

02:55:07.360 --> 02:55:14.080
monitoring um you know are are ones that are are the in the lowest assail and providing a free

02:55:14.080 --> 02:55:20.720
appropriate public educational least restrictive environment we'll be focusing on lre and faith

02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:25.600
for all monitoring activities with an emphasis on ensuring the most inclusive placement as possible

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:32.480
and ta will be focused as well turning to early childhood and and also realizing that

02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:38.480
inclusive inclusion and inclusive environments in early childhood is critical as we know that a

02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:44.880
uh a strong start for our students is key in inclusive settings and so just wanted to highlight

02:55:44.880 --> 02:55:49.920
some of the funding the 260 million dollars in early intervention special education funding

02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.960
designed to support early early intervention services wraparound services and expansion of

02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:02.400
inclusive practices the california state preschool program again the budget provided 130 million

02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:07.440
dollars for expansion which is again huge for our students especially for our students with

02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:13.520
disabilities and then the expansion of universal tk in the sense that the phase end will include

02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:18.480
obviously all four-year-old children and including students with disabilities and so

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:22.640
i'm looking forward to to the ramp up and and planning around that as well

02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:32.640
in terms of current special education investments mary went over these and so i'm not going to recap

02:56:32.640 --> 02:56:38.880
all of them but again wanted to note that there is an additional 450 million dollars in special

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:43.680
education learning recovery so that critical supports and services can be provided additional

02:56:43.680 --> 02:56:48.480
critical supports and services can be provided to students especially to address the impacts of

02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:54.800
kovat 19 100 million dollars in alternative dispute resolution so that issues regarding

02:56:54.800 --> 02:57:01.760
the ip or ip process or supports and services can be addressed in a manner that allows all parties to

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:07.440
come to an agreement at the table and then again the 20 million dollar increase

02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:11.520
it should be 15 and in supporting inclusive practices as well

02:57:13.680 --> 02:57:19.280
so with that i will conclude and we are requesting that the proposed targets for the

02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:25.520
performance indicators for the next six-year cycle of the state performance plan covering years 2021

02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:32.480
through 2526 be considered by the sbe for for approval and again we're recommending approval

02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:40.640
of those targets as well thank you so much it's really helpful to get such an overview of what we

02:57:40.640 --> 02:57:46.160
need to do to get there so that the targets are you know more than numbers on on the page

02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:51.440
we want to move to public comment and we have the public comment slide

02:57:52.240 --> 02:57:57.840
up and those who wish to provide such comment may do so by calling the telephone number

02:57:57.840 --> 02:58:03.040
and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now and while we're waiting for

02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:08.240
members of the public to call in i want to ask vice president strouse if she has any initial comments

02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:15.280
and then we'll take any clarifying comments if there are any before we take public comment

02:58:15.440 --> 02:58:20.240
thank you president darling ham and i want to thank you heather and mary for presenting

02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:27.440
really a good focus on we know this is a federal requirement that we have to complete for every six

02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:32.320
years but i i think your highlight in the presentation was it's really a guidance it's

02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:38.080
guiding our process to continue to improve support and services for students with disabilities to

02:58:38.080 --> 02:58:44.320
for students with disabilities to increase their opportunities for achievement and and i think

02:58:45.040 --> 02:58:49.360
i appreciated some highlights and i just want to reinforce that before we hear from our public

02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:56.320
comments we've been hearing this at the special ed advisory group but the iep template group that

02:58:56.320 --> 02:59:02.880
came out of this process is very exciting to hear about as we improve the process the governance

02:59:02.880 --> 02:59:08.000
and accountability study very helpful those of us who've worked with special ed in local school

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:12.640
districts recognize the challenges and i think from the special ed task force that happened

02:59:12.640 --> 02:59:19.440
several years ago lots of implications around credentialing funding template will improve the

02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:24.960
program overall and for those of us who were trained before the common trunk of training for

02:59:24.960 --> 02:59:31.360
teachers with credentials it was a very siloed program and i i really appreciate mary you

02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:38.400
highlighting the efforts that ctc has worked on try to give all teachers a common trunk of preparation

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:44.640
because we are moving toward all teachers doing first level intervention in mtss which you

02:59:44.640 --> 02:59:50.080
highlighted which is a transition that districts are embracing and i appreciate the focus on

02:59:50.080 --> 02:59:55.200
teacher preparation again it's a challenge that districts continue to work on and i think the

02:59:55.200 --> 03:00:00.160
teacher preparation program will assist that as well so i appreciate you highlighting that also

03:00:00.160 --> 03:00:04.320
the link to the system of support because districts have identified the students with

03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:10.560
disabilities as a lower performing subgroup that they want to focus on and a lot of mtss work

03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:16.160
is focused on that also the early learning work which we've been talking about at our board

03:00:16.160 --> 03:00:22.480
meetings and the work huge investments in our state budget for teacher recruitment and support

03:00:22.480 --> 03:00:28.480
and early learning and system of support and educator professional trainings it just is so

03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:33.440
exciting to see all this investment and the coordination and i just want to kind of close

03:00:33.440 --> 03:00:40.960
my comments by saying that this requirement to complete this process really is guiding our work

03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:46.160
toward improvement it is helpful to the process and while it's very comprehensive and i appreciate

03:00:46.160 --> 03:00:51.040
the two presentations heather from the last board meeting and this one i think for all of us to

03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:58.400
realize what an important effort it is to try to change a system as we're working in it to improve

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:05.360
teacher abilities to deliver support how districts view this and the least restrictive environment

03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:10.720
so again i appreciate it i think that we've come a long way we have a lot of work ahead

03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:16.320
so we have a lot of funding and programs but we have to continue on the road ahead so i thank

03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:21.600
you very much on aisle when we're ready i'll be ready to make a recommendation to support thank

03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:30.400
you thank you uh let me ask um i don't see any clarifying questions um to be answered so i want

03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:38.320
to see if we have any public commenters we do not have public comment all right terrific um and so i

03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:45.280
think we're ready for any board discussion on this item and i will um just start us off on that by

03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:52.400
sort of adding on to vice president straw's comments and to note that in that theory of

03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:57.520
action which if you would put the theory of action back up i like that little graphic

03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:04.400
i'm so glad that we're looking at all of these pieces because to get the right instruction in

03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:11.600
the right placement we have to solve the teacher supply and credentialing problems that have

03:02:11.600 --> 03:02:17.200
prevent have really led us to this much more siloed approach in the past and i want to ask

03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:26.640
just quickly ask both heather and mary as you look at what is being put together where we're heading

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:33.680
what we need to have in place to accomplish the targets because we can set the targets but we

03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:40.240
actually want to reach them are there particular things that you want us to be aware of as

03:02:40.880 --> 03:02:46.960
um needed uh beyond what's already in motion uh to help us get there

03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:56.240
i'll go ahead and go um i you know i think in terms of you know really bringing this this work

03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:02.480
to life uh is is you've as you've mentioned requires um you know first and foremost a

03:03:02.480 --> 03:03:09.520
recognition that um the the system is operated by individuals um and i think really ensuring that

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:17.440
you know our individuals are not only equipped but also you know we are able to hold and have

03:03:17.440 --> 03:03:24.240
deep conversations about students with disabilities hold deep conversations around philosophy

03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:28.800
and mindset towards supporting students with disabilities and their families and their

03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:33.760
communities and really you know an honest conversation about just looking at our system

03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:40.000
as a whole from from essentially start to finish and really carving out time i think to have some

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:46.240
of those deeper conversations i think um you know uh elaine mentioned um the fact that we are

03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:52.320
essentially oftentimes doing the work and making making refinements as we go but also i think you

03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:56.800
know stepping back um often to to really look at our system and its effectiveness and the in the

03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.760
in really support and surface issues that are bubbling up um on sort of the human side of the

03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:07.760
work um as that is often i think a critical a critical factor in addition to to getting to

03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:10.800
to some of these targets in the in the systems that we have before us as well

03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:15.840
thank you and this is sort of part of that process that we need to

03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:23.280
keep coming around on mary anything to add i just to just to underscore that we we have programs

03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:27.760
in place we need to increase the numbers of people coming through them we need to build program

03:04:27.760 --> 03:04:33.760
capacity to prepare the workforce that we need and and that you know that is maybe an easier

03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:42.320
problem to get our arms around than uh really intervening around attrition um because that's

03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:48.960
that is that's very local and um but but i think there's a significant issue that we need to attend

03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:56.400
to which is how we retain the the teachers that we do bring into teaching as you know undoubtedly

03:04:57.760 --> 03:05:03.040
as we've heard from other presentations workload questions associated with that as well as

03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:09.200
training and mentoring questions so absolutely thank you any other board discussion before we

03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:23.040
