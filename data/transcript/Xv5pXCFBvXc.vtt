00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Well, good morning, everybody. Seeing that board members are now present, Brooks, would

00:06.400 --> 00:14.040
you please call the roll to establish a quorum for the September State Board Meeting on Education?

00:14.040 --> 00:17.240
Member Sun. Here.

00:17.240 --> 00:20.400
Vice President Strauss. Here.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.020
Member Rucker. Here.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.920
Member Rodriguez. Here.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.920
Member Petillo-Brownson. Here.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.760
Member McQuillan. Good morning, here.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.680
Member Glover-Woods. Here.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.440
Member Escobedo. Here.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.160
Member Burr. Here.

00:46.600 --> 00:49.080
Member Benanca. Here.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.160
We have a quorum.

00:51.160 --> 00:59.160
So I'd like to commence by splitting the flag, and we'd like to ask our student board member,

01:00.040 --> 01:04.840
Ronna Benanca, to please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance. So we'll wait for a minute for the

01:05.400 --> 01:09.480
flag to be visible on the screen, and then Ronna, if you'll lead us, that would be great.

01:09.480 --> 01:24.760
Please salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic

01:24.760 --> 01:30.680
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:30.680 --> 01:45.880
Okay. So I'm wondering, Executive Director Allen, whether we want to wait for President

01:45.880 --> 01:52.600
Erling Hammond to do the oath, or whether you'd like maybe myself or Superintendent Thurmond?

01:56.760 --> 02:00.440
I think you can move ahead and administer the oath, Vice President Strauss. Thank you.

02:01.320 --> 02:07.800
Okay. So we're going to administer the oath for our two newest board members, which are delighted

02:07.800 --> 02:15.240
to have them join us. So first, I'm going to do it one at a time. So Dr. Francisco Escobedo

02:15.240 --> 02:21.480
will be first, and then Ronna Benanca will be our second. So Francisco, if you'll raise your

02:21.480 --> 02:31.800
right hand and repeat after me. I, and state your name. I, Francisco Escobedo. Do solemnly swear.

02:32.440 --> 02:39.080

03:39.640 --> 03:45.720
and welcome to the board, Dr. Escobedo. We're going to introduce you in a minute. I want to

03:46.280 --> 03:54.440
do the, I think, actually, let's welcome you first and then we'll swear and run. So we're

03:54.440 --> 03:59.960
delighted to welcome Dr. Francisco Escobedo as our new board member today. He served actually until

03:59.960 --> 04:06.120
very recently as the superintendent of Chula Vista Elementary School District since 2010 until his

04:06.120 --> 04:10.920
retirement last week. He was the superintendent of the year for the Association of California

04:10.920 --> 04:16.200
School Administrators, region 18. Dr. Escobedo's experience includes working as an assistant

04:16.200 --> 04:21.080
superintendent for educational leadership in the South Bay Union School District and principal

04:21.080 --> 04:27.000
research analyst from the American Institute for Research. Since 2001, Dr. Escobedo has been

04:27.000 --> 04:32.280
adjunct professor of educational administration at San Diego State University and he's currently

04:32.280 --> 04:39.640
a member of the doctoral faculty. He was appointed to serve on the West Ed Board of

04:39.640 --> 04:47.960

04:47.960 --> 04:53.000
board of education. Francisco, would you like to say a few words? Sure, I'll say a few words. Again,

make just an amazing what I call learning environment for our students, great working

05:05.880 --> 05:12.200
environment for our teachers and definitely want to help California just continue leading the way

05:13.320 --> 05:20.840
in educating our students. So thank you for the kind introduction and again looking forward to this

05:21.560 --> 05:28.200
school year. Thank you. So now I'm going to administer the oath to Rana Banaka. Rana was

05:28.200 --> 05:35.400
selected I would say from a very, very rigorous group of applicants last year. She was incredibly

05:35.400 --> 05:40.280
impressive which I'm sure you'll learn. So Rana, would you please raise your right hand and repeat

05:40.280 --> 05:50.440

06:18.280 --> 06:24.120

which I'm about to enter. That I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I'm

06:43.720 --> 06:49.880
about to enter. Well so let let me tell you a little about our amazing new student board member.

06:50.680 --> 06:54.840
She's a senior at Modesto high school in the international baccalaureate program

06:54.840 --> 06:59.960
and in addition to serving on the state board of education she serves as a student board member

06:59.960 --> 07:05.480
in the Modesto city schools so she's had some good practice. In her district she is a student

07:05.480 --> 07:10.360
represented on her district's LCAP committee and wellness committee and as a member of the

07:10.360 --> 07:17.320
district student advisory council and inter-high council. So Ronna would you like to say a few words?

07:17.320 --> 07:24.120
Yeah well first and foremost thank you so much for administering my oath of office vice president

07:24.120 --> 07:29.800
Strauss. Good morning esteemed board members and members of the public. My name is Ronna Beninka

07:29.800 --> 07:36.200
and I'm a senior at Modesto high school in Modesto California and it is truly my absolute honor

07:36.200 --> 07:40.840
and privilege to serve as the student board member on the state board of education this year

07:40.840 --> 07:46.040
and I want to just thank the board and the state of California for ensuring that students truly

07:46.040 --> 07:51.720
have a full vote and a full seat at the table when it comes to these critical decisions regarding

07:51.720 --> 07:57.400
education policy at the statewide level. I know that not many states have a position as unique

07:57.400 --> 08:03.000
as this one so I'm incredibly grateful for this opportunity and just to give a little bit of

08:03.000 --> 08:10.120
background about myself I first became interested in education policy when I was a freshman through

08:10.120 --> 08:15.880
a classmate of mine in a journalism class who happened to be our district's student board member

08:15.880 --> 08:20.200
and ever since then I've been really interested in learning about the policies that shape our

08:20.200 --> 08:25.880
classroom and thinking about ways that we can potentially improve them to better student outcomes

08:25.880 --> 08:31.240
and so I think that my experiences of serving on my district councils like the LCAP committee

08:31.240 --> 08:35.640
as you mentioned and the wellness committee and the student advisory council coupled with

08:35.640 --> 08:41.320
my experience of serving as my district student board member have really served to refine the lens

08:42.120 --> 08:48.600
with which I view education policy. Again, I am truly honored to serve in this position and I'm

08:48.600 --> 08:54.440
looking forward to representing all of California's 6.3 million students this year. Thank you.

08:56.600 --> 09:02.440
Wow well welcome to our board, Rana and Francisco. We are so delighted to have you join us.

09:04.040 --> 09:09.240
Member, President Dronehammon, would you like me to turn it backward just at the beginning of I

09:09.240 --> 09:12.600
guess comments from the board and then moving to general announcements?

09:18.120 --> 09:22.360
Let me add my congratulations and yes let's invite comments from the board

09:23.480 --> 09:28.120
on both of these wonderful appointments and thank you so much Vice President Strauss for

09:28.120 --> 09:33.480
kicking us off this morning. My pleasure. I'll just say Dr. Esquivado we're going to have a lot

09:33.480 --> 09:40.920
to talk about on doctoral classes and instructional leadership and I'm excited to hear about the

09:40.920 --> 09:47.800
center that you're leading at San Diego at the university and I just think you'll add a lot.

09:47.800 --> 09:52.440
I actually have read your the LPI study on the work that you did in Trimula Vista and I think

09:52.440 --> 09:59.320
we're just fortunate to have you and I'll just say to Rana in the interviews last year we had

09:59.800 --> 10:05.480
like twice as many candidates as we've ever had and you were incredible. We just heard your voice

10:05.480 --> 10:10.360
now and I think we will look forward to continuing to hear it. I think you play a very important role

10:10.360 --> 10:15.560
for us to make sure we keep that at the center of our work and we're excited and hopefully we'll

10:15.560 --> 10:20.600
get to work with you in person this year at some point but thank you for being with us today and

10:20.600 --> 10:26.040
for what you're going to do for students in California. Terrific. Are there other

10:26.520 --> 10:36.600
uh comments from members of the board? Hi this is Ting. I just wanted to say Rana welcome to the

10:36.600 --> 10:43.000
board. I was on the initial interview panel and we interviewed Rana and some really great students

10:43.000 --> 10:47.480
and I was just thrilled to hear that the announcement that you were selected so

10:48.280 --> 10:55.480
congratulations and welcome. Terrific. We are delighted to have you Rana. It's

10:55.720 --> 11:02.600
I'm glad I was able to tune in in time to hear your comments and Dr. Escobedo it's a treat to have you

11:03.160 --> 11:11.160
on the board as well. We're doing our second LPI study on Chula Vista as you as you are exiting

11:11.160 --> 11:16.840
and going into your new new job and really appreciate all of the fine leadership you have

11:18.120 --> 11:25.080
exhibited both in that district and in the state and looking forward to the months ahead

11:25.080 --> 11:31.400
in your participation on the board. I want to apologize for my late arrival there was a

11:31.960 --> 11:39.640
miscommunication about things on my end and so I'm delighted that we got going and that we are

11:39.640 --> 11:45.880
off and running on what's going to be a pretty robust board meeting today. We have what could

11:45.880 --> 11:55.000
be a nine-hour agenda. We'll see how we manage to be both thorough and efficient in dispatching

11:55.000 --> 12:00.760
all of our business. As I announced at our July meeting we've launched the fall recruitment and

12:00.760 --> 12:06.760

12:24.040 --> 12:28.360
I also announced in July that the kickoff for the recruitment and selection process

12:28.360 --> 12:36.840
for the 2022-23 state board student member is in operation. The state board is accepting

12:36.840 --> 12:43.160

On the consent calendar the proposed waiver consent items are W1 through 15 and the proposed

13:34.680 --> 13:42.280

we'll begin with item two which is our mega assessment item then we'll take up item one

13:48.600 --> 13:55.320
to hear the state superintendents and board presidents reports we'll reopen this item later

13:55.320 --> 14:01.560
this afternoon to take action on the July minutes and receive the state board liaison reports.

14:01.560 --> 14:09.240
We'll also take up item 11 just after item one this morning you need a score card to keep track

14:09.240 --> 14:16.040
but I'll keep announcing where we're going as we're going there. In terms of public input

14:16.040 --> 14:20.360
members of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of

14:20.360 --> 14:26.040
the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may be

14:26.040 --> 14:33.080
provided by dialing the phone number entering a participant access code and then following each

14:33.080 --> 14:39.880
of the operator's prompts upon dialing in callers will be added to a caller queue the operator will

14:39.880 --> 14:46.120
notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment we will also ask callers to please

14:46.120 --> 14:52.680
turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following the live webcast to avoid an

14:52.680 --> 14:59.720
echoing effect. Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker. Item 10 is the general

14:59.720 --> 15:04.840
public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on matters that are

15:04.840 --> 15:11.320
not specifically listed on the board's agenda. Board members please mute your microphones when

15:11.320 --> 15:16.600
you're not speaking and keep your cameras at all times on except during the scheduled breaks

15:17.160 --> 15:23.400
and any brief personal breaks you might need to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's

15:23.400 --> 15:29.320
virtual meeting. If you need to take a brief personal break please text our executive director

15:29.320 --> 15:35.960
Brooks Allen so he will know and can help us maintain a quorum. For each item on the agenda

15:35.960 --> 15:40.760
there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand using the zoom participant window

15:40.840 --> 15:46.040
if you would like to ask a question or make a comment. So we're going to move on to

15:46.040 --> 15:51.400
agenda item two which is the California assessment of student performance and progress system

15:51.400 --> 15:56.840
and English language proficiency assessments with California the request for approval of the

Smarter Balanced summative assessments for English language arts literacy and mathematics

16:02.840 --> 16:10.200
blueprints and an update on assessment program activities. As a spoiler alert the CDE is

16:10.200 --> 16:16.040
recommending that the state board approve the Smarter Balanced summative assessments for ELA

16:16.040 --> 16:23.240
and math blueprints as described in tables one and two for the 2021-22 administration

16:23.240 --> 16:29.000
and this item will be presented by Mao Vang of the CDE. Mao please take it away.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.520
We are not hearing you yet.

16:45.960 --> 16:52.280
Thank you. I have to get myself oriented here into my new environment. So thank you President

16:52.360 --> 17:01.720
Darlin-Hammond. Again this item is item number two the assessment updates. Good morning. I am

17:03.240 --> 17:07.400
our Superintendent Thurman, President Darlin-Hammond and our esteemed board members.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.760
I am Mao Vang the director for the assessment development and administration division.

17:13.480 --> 17:20.520
Again this is the mega assessment update item. Before I go into this formal presentation though

17:21.000 --> 17:28.920
I would like to let you know about some staffing changes in the assessment development and

17:28.920 --> 17:33.480
administration division of the California Department of Education. I want to just take

17:33.480 --> 17:40.920
a moment to congratulate Dr. Eric Zilbert our associate director who has recently retired.

17:40.920 --> 17:47.720
Just want to share a little bit about his contribution to California's the Department

17:47.720 --> 17:53.800
of Education and California students and teachers. Over the last 20 years Dr. Zilbert

17:53.800 --> 17:59.000
has contributed tremendously through the multiple roles that he has had in our division

17:59.640 --> 18:06.680
and he has provided educational measurement or psychometric expertise for all of our statewide

18:06.680 --> 18:13.800
programs such as the California English language development test, the California assessment of

18:14.360 --> 18:19.560
student performance and progress, the English language proficiency assessments for California

18:19.560 --> 18:29.080
or LPAC just to name a few and he has guided the test development, analyzed data, developed systems

18:29.080 --> 18:36.440
for reporting test results and participated on the CDE technical design group and contributed to as

18:36.440 --> 18:42.760
well as collaborated with the analysis measurement and accountability reporting division on the

18:42.760 --> 18:49.080
growth model work. Furthermore he facilitated our CASP and LPAC technical advisory group meetings

18:49.080 --> 18:56.920
to ensure that CDE has the access and California has access to expert guidance of leaders in the

18:56.920 --> 19:03.240
field of assessment to assure the highest quality assessment program possible and Dr. Zilbert

19:03.240 --> 19:10.200
certainly has made a deep and lasting impact on assessments in California. Thank you Dr. Zilbert.

19:10.920 --> 19:19.800
One other change I would like to update you on is to remember Michelle Glipa. She was an associate

19:19.800 --> 19:26.680
governmental program analyst in our division who lost her life due to COVID-19 in November 2020.

19:27.960 --> 19:33.320
For the last 14 years Michelle Glipa's work spanned across four different assessment programs

19:34.280 --> 19:42.680
in our division and she was on a team of three people to support the work of eight units

19:42.680 --> 19:50.600
consisting of about 50 staff members and multiple contractors facilitating the review and approval

19:50.600 --> 19:56.440
process of over a thousand assessment deliverables per year and that's only the ones that are numbered.

19:57.160 --> 20:02.920
In each of the positions that she has held she has excelled in everything that she did

20:03.320 --> 20:08.680
she held herself and others to the highest standards she demonstrated an exceptional work

20:08.680 --> 20:15.320
ethic she was professional punctual and reliable and she has had it she has an excellent eye for

20:15.320 --> 20:21.960
detail and she kept helped keep all the project deliverables of the division moving along so her

20:21.960 --> 20:28.920
death was devastating and painful for our division as well as all those who knew her and due to the

20:28.920 --> 20:34.920
impacts of COVID-19 there was not much we could do however this summer we were able to share in

20:34.920 --> 20:40.920
the celebration of her life with her family and friends and we we certainly did lose a great

20:40.920 --> 20:46.760
employee friend and overall beautiful person inside out and although she is no longer with us

20:46.760 --> 20:57.240
she is not forgotten. So here I will begin my formal presentation

20:57.800 --> 21:04.360
uh this is the again the assessment item and I will be joined later by Cindy Kazanas the director

21:04.360 --> 21:10.360
of the assessment the analysis measurement and accountability reporting division in addition we

21:10.360 --> 21:17.240
have Mary our Mary Ann Aracela the executive director of ETS or educational testing service

21:17.880 --> 21:23.080
and Tony Alpert the executive director of the smarter balance assessment consortium are available

21:23.160 --> 21:30.920
to assist with questions during this item so the item before you is both action and information

21:30.920 --> 21:36.360
item in the presentation I will provide an overview of the recommendation for approval

21:37.480 --> 21:43.640
Cindy will join me and in presenting the use of assessments for accountability in the upcoming

21:43.640 --> 21:49.480
years and then I will circle back and give you some key updates in the California assessment of

21:49.480 --> 21:54.520
student performance and progress or CASP and English language proficiency assessments for

21:54.520 --> 22:00.200
California or ALPAC updates and wrap it up with the national and international assessments update

22:00.200 --> 22:09.320
and then bring us back to the action of the recommendation and here is the recommendation

22:09.320 --> 22:15.640
the California department of education recommends that the California state board of education

22:15.640 --> 22:19.880
approve the smarter balance summative assessments for English language arts literacy

22:19.880 --> 22:27.640
or ELA and mathematics blueprints as described in tables one and two for the 21-22 administration

22:27.640 --> 22:35.960
and in future years as laid out in tables one and two in the item

22:35.960 --> 22:38.280
um

22:43.240 --> 22:49.800
so just to give a little background I will provide this overview and background on our

22:49.800 --> 22:58.520
recommendation remember that the the every student succeeds act is our uh has section

22:58.520 --> 23:06.040
111 b2 which requires that states uh that a statement administer annual assessments so

23:06.600 --> 23:13.800
um in in reading language arts and mathematics and um to students in grades three through eight

23:13.800 --> 23:20.760
and once in high school and then science uh which is for grades bands once in grade spans three

23:20.760 --> 23:27.560
through five six six through nine and once in high school and then um English language the English

23:27.560 --> 23:34.120
language proficiency assessment which is to all eligible students in grade in kindergarten through

23:34.120 --> 23:43.800
grade 12 so under our uh California assessment system we have the cast as defined in education

23:43.800 --> 23:53.480
code sections 60601 through 60649 and that includes the smarter balance summative assessments for

23:53.480 --> 24:00.120
English language arts and math our science uh California science test and the California

24:00.120 --> 24:06.280
alternate assessments for English language arts math and science and we have an optional

24:06.280 --> 24:12.360
California Spanish assessment for Spanish reading language arts and this is to meet our

24:13.080 --> 24:21.160
state as well as federal requirements under ESSA and then including the ALPAC as defined in our

24:21.160 --> 24:30.360
education code sections 313 and 60810 and that includes our initial ALPAC the summative ALPAC

24:30.360 --> 24:40.840
and the alternate ALPAC so again providing a little background in the last school year 2020-21

24:41.720 --> 24:47.560
the U.S. Department of Education did provide some flexibilities to support the administration of

24:47.560 --> 24:55.160
assessments due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic so the state board of education our

24:55.160 --> 25:01.240
SBE did support the flexibilities and approved adjusted blueprints for the smarter balance

25:01.240 --> 25:11.640
summative assessments for ELA math to be used for one year only so the CDE continues to

25:11.960 --> 25:18.920
um seek opportunities to maximize flexibility for our local educational agencies in California

25:19.560 --> 25:26.200
and also trying to keep the critical elements of the infrastructure intact so so for us to

25:26.200 --> 25:31.320
use the adjusted blueprints and preserve that maximum flexibility for our local educational

25:31.320 --> 25:38.600
agencies for this spring 2022 testing the SBE would need to approve the continued use of the

25:38.600 --> 25:46.680
adjusted blueprints for both the ELA and mathematics per our state education code

25:48.200 --> 25:56.280
and at this time the CDE does not recommend changes to other non-smarter balanced blueprints

25:57.320 --> 26:04.760
so the rationale for this for the adjusted blueprints and continuing to use them is that

26:04.760 --> 26:09.880
they are derived from the adopted smarter balance summative assessments for ELA math

26:11.000 --> 26:21.080
and this the there's a reduction in the computer adapted test portion or the cat portion by about

26:21.080 --> 26:28.440
50 percent for each claim and this will also maintain comparable proportion of content across

26:28.520 --> 26:35.560
all the claims and i'll say a little bit more about claims later for example a claim is

26:35.560 --> 26:41.800
in english language arts in mathematics i'll just give a little background is you'll have the claims

26:41.800 --> 26:49.480
such as reading listening research inquiry writing those are claims under a content area

26:50.120 --> 26:56.200
and it'll also maintain proportion of depth of knowledge of the depth of knowledge being assessed

26:56.680 --> 27:03.560
and this will keep the performance tasks intact because they are integrated tasks

27:05.400 --> 27:12.360
so some advantages for continuing to use the adjusted blueprints are that they do reduce the

27:12.360 --> 27:17.320
amount of time students spend on the english language arts and math summative assessments

27:17.880 --> 27:24.840
so to allow more time to really fully utilize our comprehensive assessment system which includes the

27:24.840 --> 27:31.560
use of other resources that support the formative assessment process such as our tools for teachers

27:31.560 --> 27:38.360
that have resources in english math and science and then our interim assessments throughout the

27:38.360 --> 27:45.880
year and this will also maximize connectivity as well as minimize the potential for having network

27:45.880 --> 27:52.120
issues since all of our assessments are online so this form length

27:54.120 --> 28:01.080
change will support the needs of specific groups of students allowing for such things as fewer breaks

28:01.640 --> 28:07.800
more flexibility in scheduling for local educational agencies and also reduce the

28:07.800 --> 28:12.760
potential for test security incidents just to name a few

28:14.920 --> 28:21.160
and then continuing with some additional advantages lea's will continue to meet state and federal

28:21.160 --> 28:28.040
testing requirements for english language arts and math the overall scores the scale scores and

28:28.040 --> 28:33.560
achievement levels are still reported at the individual student level and they will continue

28:33.560 --> 28:41.480
to be reported in support of the growth model calculations as well so all the claims as i

28:41.480 --> 28:47.560
mentioned such as like reading writing listening research inquiry results will continue to be

28:47.560 --> 28:55.400
provided for groups of 30 or more students on the public reporting website and this does in terms of

28:55.400 --> 29:03.320
reclassification or usage for reclassification of the english language arts results the

29:03.320 --> 29:09.640
reclassification guidance will not for english learners is not expected to be changed or impacted

29:12.120 --> 29:19.320
so some advantages or disadvantages are that again i just want to reiterate that the individuals

29:19.320 --> 29:26.840
claim categories will not be available this year the 21 22 school year and the summative

29:26.840 --> 29:34.600
assessment target reports for groups of students will not be available as well however we will

29:34.600 --> 29:40.600
conduct further analysis and it is anticipate that we can create or work with the smarter balance

29:40.600 --> 29:46.840
assessment consortium that we could come up with composite claim categories for individual students

29:46.840 --> 29:53.720
and the target reports for groups of students will be available in the following year the 22 23

29:53.720 --> 30:04.360
school year so the recommended adjusted blueprint this table provides the recommended

30:04.360 --> 30:11.160
adjusted blueprint for the english language arts test again the total number of items are provided

30:11.160 --> 30:17.880
for reference at the top the first row indicates how many items the adopted for full form consisted

30:17.960 --> 30:25.880
of and the second row indicates what is in the adjusted form so using the same rationale the

30:25.880 --> 30:33.720
performance task item counts remain the same the difference is in the computer adapted items

30:35.800 --> 30:42.280
and here are the claims first claim is reading second is writing a third is listening and the

30:42.280 --> 30:46.440
fourth is research inquiry for the english language arts assessment

30:48.280 --> 30:54.120
okay and then moving on to the estimated the recommended for math

30:57.160 --> 31:01.240
again the total items by grade are provided for reference at the top

31:03.000 --> 31:10.440
and again the first row indicates or shows how many items are in the adopted form for

31:10.440 --> 31:15.800
the full form for math and then the second row indicates what is in the adjusted form

31:16.680 --> 31:23.720
and in math the claims are concepts and procedures problem solving communicating reasoning modeling

31:23.720 --> 31:32.600
and data analysis again the difference is in the computer adapted items or the cat portions

31:33.320 --> 31:38.680
so i want to give some context to the estimated testing times for the smart balance summative

31:38.680 --> 31:45.640
assessments we have shared this in the past i would like to revisit this table displays the

31:45.640 --> 31:51.560
estimated testing times in hours and minutes by grade for both english language arts and

31:51.560 --> 31:58.440
mathematics and then the combined time of both assessments as we cover there are no

31:58.440 --> 32:05.000
projected shorter times for the performance tasks as they are unchanged however the testing

32:05.000 --> 32:12.440
time is in the cat portion across all grades and tests and the last two columns show the

32:12.440 --> 32:18.440
comparison of estimated testing times for the full form and the adjusted form so there's no

32:18.440 --> 32:26.440
there is significant time savings especially at the upper grades and the second row is the

32:26.600 --> 32:34.600
upper grades and although we have provided estimated testing times here these tests are

32:34.600 --> 32:41.160
untimed that means you could take them and stop at a certain point pause the test and continue

32:41.160 --> 32:49.720
where you left off in a different on a different day as i mentioned earlier the cde does not

32:49.720 --> 32:56.920
recommend changes to other non-smarter balanced cask summative assessment blueprints as they are

32:56.920 --> 33:03.000
much shorter so this table displays the estimated testing times in hours and minutes for the

33:03.000 --> 33:09.240
california alternate assessments or caas for english language arts math and science and then

33:09.240 --> 33:17.640
the california spanish assessment as well and the cast there is our regular science test

33:20.680 --> 33:31.160
and this table here is the estimated testing times for summative lpac this test is already much

33:31.160 --> 33:38.200
shorter in terms of estimated testing times summative lpac is about two hours or less than

33:38.200 --> 33:42.360
two hours in the lower grades and about three hours for the upper grades

33:43.080 --> 33:44.120
for the upper grades

33:47.480 --> 33:54.200
so before we go on to the next steps i know that there have been concerns about the reduction of

33:55.320 --> 34:02.600
proposing a continue to use the reduction in the in the adjusted blueprint i just want to

34:03.640 --> 34:10.600
say that overall a reduction in the test blueprint does not mean a decrease in accuracy

34:11.080 --> 34:16.600
all right we're very thoughtful about this process the assessments will continue to measure what it

34:16.600 --> 34:24.040
is designed to measure the parents and guardians will continue to receive reports as one measure

34:24.040 --> 34:30.680
or one data source of their students performance and schools and staff and families will continue

34:30.680 --> 34:36.600
to be able to make observations and identify achievement gaps among groups of students

34:37.480 --> 34:43.960
the overall student scores will continue to support the calculation of the growth model measures

34:47.720 --> 34:55.000
and in discussing our next steps here we are recommending that the cd is recommending that

34:55.000 --> 35:00.040
the spe approved the continued use of the smarter balance summative assessments for english language

35:00.120 --> 35:09.960
arts and mathematics adjusted blueprints for this school year the 2021 and 22 with the intent that

35:09.960 --> 35:16.360
we are going to use this in future years too it's just that at this temporary time we want to make

35:16.360 --> 35:22.360
sure that we continue to further analyze the blueprints and evaluate and identify if there's

35:22.360 --> 35:27.880
any additional changes that may be needed but at this point in time this is the adjusted blueprint

35:27.880 --> 35:33.640
that we will continue to use and we will prioritize the comparability of data in future

35:33.640 --> 35:39.000
years you know using as we use the adjusted blueprint and we'll continue to analyze the

35:39.000 --> 35:44.440
data and propose the approach to maximize its use in growth model calculations

35:47.480 --> 35:52.600
again the cd will continue to collaborate with the smarter balance assessment consortium because

35:52.600 --> 35:58.600
that's how we get our english language arts and math assessments and this is a multi-year approach

35:58.600 --> 36:05.960
and process we are going to explore the reporting of composite claim categories based on the analysis

36:05.960 --> 36:13.800
of our of the content standards and the consortium wide data we are members of a consortium so these

36:14.680 --> 36:21.000
composite claim categories are expected to allow california to meet peer review requirements and

36:21.000 --> 36:23.880
expectations in english language arts and mathematics

36:26.360 --> 36:34.280
and at this point i'm going to pause for a bit and have in bring up cindy kazanis the cde director

36:34.280 --> 36:43.880
for our analysis measurement and accountability reporting division thank you mal good good morning

36:43.880 --> 36:48.600
members of the board and welcome to our new members see my head's cut off there okay

36:49.080 --> 36:57.000
i need to to be mouse size i am here today to talk a little bit about the interaction between

36:57.000 --> 37:03.240
assessments and accountability and of course we are in constant communication and i just want to

37:03.240 --> 37:08.760
acknowledge mal and the work of their division and helping us with so many things over the last

37:08.760 --> 37:15.160
couple years specifically just in the context of assessments and our accountability system

37:15.160 --> 37:21.560
for this year the 2020 california school dashboard just to make sure that we're on the same page we

37:21.560 --> 37:28.280
are not producing state indicator data of course that's in direct response to the federal waiver

37:28.280 --> 37:34.040
that we received as well as assembly bill 130 that was passed by the legislature and signed into law

37:34.040 --> 37:42.360
by governor newsom we are committed and as an ab 130 does require us to post data that we determined

37:42.360 --> 37:47.880
to be valid and reliable for the school year to support lea's in development of their local control

37:47.880 --> 37:52.200
and accountability plans and so we'll do that through a variety of means including our dashboard

37:52.200 --> 38:00.440
additional reports data quest or other reporting websites as we look ahead to 2022 and the dashboard

38:00.440 --> 38:08.200
for this current school year we are looking at a state indicator display of status only based on of

38:08.200 --> 38:13.960
course just the data from this school year and of course we're required under that federal waiver

38:13.960 --> 38:21.640
to identify schools and ab 130 requires us to look at identifying districts using that data set

38:21.640 --> 38:28.520
we will bring that to the board as we have more information next year and then with 2023 again

38:28.520 --> 38:33.560
looking ahead a couple years the state indicators will go back to normal will produce not only status

38:33.560 --> 38:37.480
but change and we'll have the performance colors based on the data from the two years because you

38:37.480 --> 38:43.320
need the two years of data to create a color and why this is important is because we're headed

38:43.320 --> 38:49.880
towards a student growth model and in giving just a brief update again for for new members especially

38:49.880 --> 38:56.360
the board adopted the methodology for a student growth model this past may the model captures

38:56.360 --> 39:00.760
academic growth for schools lea's and student groups for grades four through eight in both

39:00.760 --> 39:06.680
english language arts and mathematics we used data historical data to construct this model

39:06.680 --> 39:16.200
from the 2016 17 2017 18 and 2018 19 school years we are we did produce individual student

39:16.200 --> 39:21.640
growth scores which have been shared with districts through our assessment operation

39:21.640 --> 39:26.760
system called toms that was done at the beginning of summer we are working towards a public release

39:27.320 --> 39:32.600
of our aggregate growth scores in later this month specifically this coming monday if you're

39:32.600 --> 39:37.080
interested we're hosting a webinar to talk about our communications toolkit for the student growth

39:37.080 --> 39:44.600
model as well as what to expect with the public release specifically how this affects that this

39:44.600 --> 39:49.880
item affects growth model right now is that we need to have three years of consecutive data to

39:49.880 --> 39:55.240
produce the growth model of course that's for the same students in our english using our english

39:55.240 --> 40:02.120
language arts and mathematics assessment scores with this frame of reference in mind the soonest

40:02.120 --> 40:08.360
we could produce this model would be 2024 that said we are already in the beginning of a school

40:08.360 --> 40:15.000
year that is experiencing a lot of change a lot of turmoil and i just want to point out that we

40:15.000 --> 40:20.840
are very dependent on the fact that students have to test come spring if we don't have a full testing

40:20.840 --> 40:27.640
regiment of smarter balance this will be at risk so the participation rate is really important when

40:27.640 --> 40:32.600
we think about producing a growth model three years from now but that said we are working really

40:32.600 --> 40:37.080
closely with now we're working really closely with a testing contractor to make sure that any

40:37.080 --> 40:44.840
adjustments to the assessments will not will not deter us from the goal of producing our first

40:44.840 --> 40:52.040
growth scores using real data not historical data in 2024 but i'm happy to turn it back over to mal

40:58.040 --> 40:58.840
thank you cindy

41:02.280 --> 41:10.280
so with that i will give you a quick overview of our castman lpac updates because we're

41:10.280 --> 41:16.840
constantly working and and developing and administering and communicating with the field

41:16.840 --> 41:20.760
so we want to share some updates with you as well as you know the science

41:21.160 --> 41:29.960
us test the california science test or cast is constantly being developed and having additions

41:29.960 --> 41:36.120
just want to make you aware that we have some new cast range achievement level descriptors

41:36.120 --> 41:43.400
webpage developed and deployed and the range alds or achievement level descriptors are really

41:43.400 --> 41:49.160
detailed descriptions of observable evidence of student performance by grade and content

41:49.400 --> 41:54.360
and they do they were developed to provide evidence of how students knowledge skills and

41:54.360 --> 42:00.440
abilities change and become more advanced across the achievement levels so that is available

42:00.440 --> 42:09.320
another update is that we have updated the item content specifications and with that we have about

42:10.280 --> 42:19.400
175 let me see something the i like something that's wrong with the computer oh

42:20.920 --> 42:25.160
yeah remind me tomorrow we're a little busy here so

42:27.160 --> 42:35.960
yes and so we have about 175 item specifications for the cast and they do provide details on each

42:35.960 --> 42:42.760
assessed dimension of a california next generation science standards or ngs as performance

42:42.760 --> 42:48.760
expectation so the revisions were made to the science and engineering sub practice assessment

42:48.760 --> 42:55.960
targets and the possible phenomena or context sessions sections another thing is that we're

42:55.960 --> 43:02.760
implementing this year we are implementing the state board of education approved cast revised

43:02.760 --> 43:09.960
blueprint that you had approved in january of 2020 but we were not able to implement it yet

43:09.960 --> 43:16.840
due to what happened in 2019 as well as 2020-21 school years

43:19.400 --> 43:25.640
another update is that we have the california alternate assessment for assessment for science

43:25.640 --> 43:31.560
updates here i just want to let you know that this assessment already opened on september 7

43:31.560 --> 43:37.400
remember they're embedded tasks that are administered close to instruction we have also

43:38.120 --> 43:42.600
made some improvements in the area of the directions for administration to give

43:42.600 --> 43:48.760
consistency across all the alternate assessments starting with this assessment and then we revised

43:48.760 --> 43:54.200
the practice test to include two science connectors and to correspond with that structure

43:54.200 --> 43:59.640
with the structure of the operational assessment so that they will be able to use that teachers

43:59.640 --> 44:04.280
and students will be able to use that in the field and then there's also a new response

44:04.280 --> 44:10.600
options for alternate assessments resource that was developed for test examiners and we encourage

44:10.600 --> 44:15.960
educators and examiners to look at these resources so that it will help them have a smooth

44:17.160 --> 44:24.440
administration another update that we bring to you on a regular basis are our interim

44:24.440 --> 44:30.600
assessments for ele math it is part of our comprehensive assessment system and the three

44:30.600 --> 44:36.840
types of the smarter balance interim assessments that are available are like i mentioned that

44:37.560 --> 44:40.600
there are three types so there is the interim assessment comprehensive

44:41.880 --> 44:47.240
the interim comprehensive assessments or we call icas sorry there's a lot of acronyms thrown at

44:47.240 --> 44:55.400
you here but hopefully i will tell you what they are here the interim assessment blocks these are

44:55.400 --> 45:04.520
smaller chunks of assessments based on assessment targets and then there's the focus ibs that are

45:04.520 --> 45:10.680
also smaller blocks of assessment interim assessments but they are a little bit more

45:10.760 --> 45:19.880
focused on a few assessment targets and we have for the whole state to use is we have over 200

45:20.760 --> 45:28.600
interim assessments including 38 new focus ibs and they have been available since august 18th

45:29.080 --> 45:40.040
the tools for teachers are formative assessment resource resources website is just want to share

45:40.040 --> 45:47.080
a few or a couple formative assessment resource workshops that we've done with educators over the

45:47.080 --> 45:55.000
summer and this is really to develop a formative assessment resource for the tools for teachers

45:55.000 --> 45:59.720
resource for the tools for teachers we have the science workshops that were held in may and june

46:00.360 --> 46:07.160
and 43 california science educators participated i'm happy to say that my staff here at the

46:07.160 --> 46:13.720
division worked really hard to plan and lead this workshop along with the assistance of local

46:13.720 --> 46:19.960
educational agency staff who served as team leads and coaches and then during the workshops the

46:19.960 --> 46:27.080
educators participated educator participants they really worked in teams to develop new science

46:27.080 --> 46:33.480
formative assessment resources for kindergarten through grade five for inclusion in the

46:33.480 --> 46:45.080
tools for teachers website so again a few other little things each of the science resource was

46:45.080 --> 46:52.040
developed was peer reviewed by other participants and coaches so they did a lot of work just wanted

46:52.040 --> 46:57.000
to you know do a little shout out to our state because california is the first state to add

46:57.000 --> 47:05.480
science resources to the smarter balance tools for teachers resources and more than 50 science

47:05.560 --> 47:11.720
resources are available now in terms of the

47:13.880 --> 47:21.160
english language arts and math workshops we did hold a few or in june and july as well

47:21.800 --> 47:28.360
and there were 15 california state network of educator members we have a network of educators

47:28.360 --> 47:33.960
when we say things like sne state network of educators we have a team of them across the

47:33.960 --> 47:40.520
state they participated and then we also have three cde state lead leadership uh state leadership

47:40.520 --> 47:46.840
team members that participated at this time we have more than 75 new english language arts and

47:46.840 --> 47:52.520
math formative assessment resources developed at these workshops and they'll be available

47:53.240 --> 47:55.240
later this fall in the tools for teachers

47:56.120 --> 47:58.120
so

47:59.080 --> 48:06.440
another um update that wanted to share with you is that in oh sorry i'm a little ahead of myself

48:07.720 --> 48:15.960
is the alternate alpac um as a reminder the alternate alpac is designed specifically for

48:15.960 --> 48:23.640
students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and um this assessment is aligned

48:23.640 --> 48:31.400
with the 2012 california english language development or eld standards through the eld

48:31.400 --> 48:39.240
connectors so the eld connectors provide an aligned expectation of students english language

48:39.240 --> 48:44.120
proficiency that has been reduced in depth breadth and complexity to make sure they are

48:44.120 --> 48:48.520
appropriate for english learners students with the most significant cognitive disabilities

48:49.160 --> 48:56.920
so they the alternate alpac serve two purposes and the initial alternate alpac determines a

48:56.920 --> 49:02.520
student's initial classification of either english learner or initial fluent english proficient

49:03.400 --> 49:09.400
and the summative alternate alpac provides a measure of a student's annual progress toward

49:09.400 --> 49:15.320
english language proficiency and support for decisions made on students reclassification

49:15.320 --> 49:21.960
reclassification so once both the initial and summative alternate alpac are operationalized they

49:21.960 --> 49:27.800
will replace the locally determined alternate assessments and we and will provide the statewide

49:27.800 --> 49:34.680
consistent measurement of english language proficiency for this eligible group the alternate

49:34.680 --> 49:39.640
alpac operational field test sorry i'm kind of flying by a lot of things but we have a lot to

49:39.640 --> 49:47.560
cover today so why don't let you know and make you aware that we are as last year we we plan to

49:47.560 --> 49:53.320
have the alternate alpac operational field test but due to conditions that you are aware of we

49:53.320 --> 49:59.480
had to postpone this alternate alpac operational field test to this school year they will open on

49:59.480 --> 50:09.720
november 1st through february 15th that is the window and to prepare for the field test we have

50:09.720 --> 50:16.360
made online training available in our in the Moodle training site since last november and for this

50:16.360 --> 50:21.480
fall we have scheduled question and answer sessions to provide local educational agencies

50:21.480 --> 50:27.720
additional support and once the field test has been completed educators will participate in a

50:27.720 --> 50:35.720
standard setting or in standard setting meetings in early spring of 2022 so the proposed threshold

50:35.720 --> 50:45.320
scores are anticipated to come to the board of education in may of 2022 and then by july of next

50:45.320 --> 50:51.640
year our hope is that the initial alternate alpac will launch and the summative alternate alpac will

50:51.640 --> 50:54.040
launch in february of 2023

50:58.280 --> 51:02.280
i mentioned a little bit about that about peer review earlier on our

51:04.520 --> 51:09.560
blueprint section but this is really a peer review federal peer review update for you

51:10.360 --> 51:17.560
on the federal peer review is really a process through which a state documents that it has met

51:17.560 --> 51:24.120
federal law and requirements so under essa in the development and administration of its

51:24.920 --> 51:32.600
assessments california has provided and submitted evidence for federal peer review for our english

51:32.600 --> 51:39.400
language arts and mathematics assessments and for the alternate assessments for english language

51:39.480 --> 51:50.360
arts and math as well and then we will provide an update with the results of the reviews when

51:50.360 --> 51:57.720
they become available another thing is the first submission of the cast or the california science

51:57.720 --> 52:05.160
test was initially scheduled for this summer but has been postponed till december of this calendar

52:05.160 --> 52:19.000
year so another change that we wanted to be aware of is that there are california alternate

52:19.000 --> 52:23.160
assessments are developed for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and

52:23.800 --> 52:31.240
and if a an individualized education plan team or ip team deems it's appropriate for a student

52:31.240 --> 52:37.480
to take an alternate assessment the student is eligible for all the alternate assessments

52:38.200 --> 52:45.320
so to assist the local educational agencies with this we have made some systems enhancements

52:45.320 --> 52:51.880
to ensure uniformity of assignment of alternate assessments for the students who qualify

52:51.880 --> 52:57.480
in our test operations management system so this is across the board for all the alternate

52:57.480 --> 53:03.000
assessments and we have worked with our the multilingual support division as well as the

53:03.000 --> 53:13.480
special education division in coming to this guidance almost there you're still with me

53:14.360 --> 53:19.720
we're we're going to cover a little bit of the national and international assessments

53:19.720 --> 53:21.800
updates in this next section

53:31.960 --> 53:39.320
so one of the first assessments is our national assessment of educational progress or nape

53:40.440 --> 53:46.920
nape is the largest nationally represented assessment and continuing assessment of what

53:46.920 --> 53:56.360
us students know and can do in various subjects so since 1969 nape has been mandated by congress

53:57.880 --> 54:04.280
and our california students do participate in nape every year and nape results are reported as

54:04.280 --> 54:12.600
the nation's report card so depending on the assessment results may be at the national state

54:12.600 --> 54:18.680
or large district level three of our california school districts participate in district level

54:18.680 --> 54:23.000
nape and that is a fresno san diego and los angeles

54:25.960 --> 54:33.560
so for this school year for 2022 approximately 550 schools are selected to participate

54:34.440 --> 54:40.440
um grades four and eight will be participating in math and reading

54:41.480 --> 54:48.680
and then grade eight will be participating in civics and u.s history and then there's also

54:49.640 --> 54:58.280
nape also consists of age there's a age nine long-term trend math and reading assessments

54:58.360 --> 55:05.320
um being administered just prior they this was supposed to be administered prior to the

55:05.320 --> 55:13.240
covid pandemic however um we it was not so it's postponed until this year and results from this

55:13.240 --> 55:21.080
2022 long-term trend assessment will allow for pre and post pandemic comparisons and then the

55:21.080 --> 55:24.840
nape 2022 testing window is mid-january through march

55:28.520 --> 55:32.680
uh an international assessment of reading it's called the progress

55:32.680 --> 55:40.360
in international reading literacy survey or pearls um it is administered every five years in grade

55:40.360 --> 55:50.520
four and pearls um did draw students from over uh 50 countries and the results are uh from this

55:50.520 --> 55:56.280
assessment are used by researchers and policymakers to inform discussions of international

55:56.280 --> 56:02.920
competitiveness uh 30 california schools have been selected to participate in pearls

56:04.440 --> 56:12.120
and um it takes about three to three hours to complete so it's a it's not that uh short of a

56:12.120 --> 56:19.640
assessment either and we'll be a minister in october so given the current conditions we're

56:19.640 --> 56:26.200
not sure um how everything will be rolled out as well but we want to you be aware of this assessment

56:27.640 --> 56:33.000
and then the program for international student assessment or pisa uh this is for 15 year olds

56:33.000 --> 56:38.920
in reading math and science and financial literacy just to highlight some things 80 countries

56:38.920 --> 56:47.240
participate or administer it every three years and again they are used to look at and form

56:47.240 --> 56:52.680
international competitiveness when they can compare us to other countries and it really

56:52.680 --> 57:00.920
takes about four hours for students to complete this one so there will be a field test this fall

57:01.720 --> 57:08.440
however again about 10 schools are are selected to participate in this field test

57:10.840 --> 57:16.120
and then the last international test we will cover is the trends in international mathematics

57:16.120 --> 57:22.360
and science if you hear tim studies and comparing us to other countries the assessment is really

57:22.360 --> 57:28.440
for fourth and eighth grade students in math and science uh over 65 countries participate

57:29.160 --> 57:35.720
and um again it is really to inform us about international competitiveness in these uh

57:36.760 --> 57:43.960
content areas this one takes about three hours so again this field test is planned for spring of

57:43.960 --> 57:53.560
2022 and 10 schools have been selected to participate so um just i'm wrapping up here

57:53.560 --> 58:03.560
um just reminding you to join us and follow us on the um assessment cde assessments twitter account

58:05.480 --> 58:10.920
i will stop here for any questions or turn it over to our board president

58:14.200 --> 58:22.120
thank you so much mao uh we'll um put up the slide for public comment now and we will take

58:22.120 --> 58:28.680
some clarifying questions but we want to get the queue going for public comment uh members of the

58:28.680 --> 58:34.040
public wishing to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the phone number and using

58:34.040 --> 58:39.080
the access code provided on the slide that is shown now while we're waiting for members of the

58:39.080 --> 58:45.640
public to call in i want to ask member sun if she has any initial comments before me and then

58:45.640 --> 58:52.840
i'll check for clarifying questions before we go to public comment um member sun do you have

58:53.960 --> 59:01.160
thank you thank you so thank you mal for a very thorough um presentation so i wanted just to speak

59:01.160 --> 59:04.600
to the action portion of this item um with regard to the blueprints and the

59:04.600 --> 59:11.800
action portion of this item um with regard to the blueprints um i fully support um a shorter

59:11.800 --> 59:19.400
testing period time so um at the same time you know my my concern when i spoke to staff around

59:19.400 --> 59:25.400
this was that it seemed like we had taken so much time to build up the blueprints and that it seems

59:25.400 --> 59:32.680
very quickly that we are reducing the items so i was very glad to hear um mal and her team will

59:32.680 --> 59:41.480
continue to do um analysis and to continue reviewing and looking at um the accuracy of these

59:41.480 --> 59:48.600
uh the items and the reduction of the blueprint items um i also and working with the smarter

59:48.600 --> 59:56.040
balance consortium as well um what i also wanted just to emphasize and that we're very clear to

59:56.920 --> 01:00:06.440
lea's and to schools um that uh we had a pretty significant disruption after 2019 and so what

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:15.000
cindy was speaking to around looking at the growth sword not starting and resetting basically in 2020

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:24.600
2021 22 um i think that is right so for those schools and lea's that have did take the um casp

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:32.280
ele and math in the spring last year if they are looking at well our scores went higher or lower

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:37.320
than 2019 i think that uh there was enough disruption that we can't really say that you

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.680
can compare that these were apples to apples comparisons and so we want to make sure that

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:49.960
we understand that um that we had a significant change in this last year and that we should not

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.600
be trying to look back at the past and doing comparisons moving forward especially with

01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:04.680
the changes in blueprints and everything else thank you appreciate that i want to thank mal

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:11.080
for not only her leadership on this item but her leadership over the whole year it's been an

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:17.000
intense and difficult year there's been a lot of adjustment needed mal you've done a terrific job

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:25.000
in helping us through uh wind our way through uh this process and appreciate the work to queue

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.080
us up for this year um i do uh favor the recommendation that is being brought to us to

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:40.840
adopt this shorter form i am very familiar with the technical advisory group that advises

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:46.920
the smarter balanced consortium they're an excellent and thoughtful group of

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:53.720
psychometricians they have looked at this and i know we can ask more questions of tony since

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:59.320
he's here if we need to uh but they um you know i feel confident in their judgment about the

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:06.120
stability and the reliability of the scores and i appreciate you having articulated the advantages

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:13.960
i do also want to note that um to the point that cindy kazanis made we are uh you know off to a

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:22.520
good start in the face of covid's delta variant this year relative to many other states and i'll

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:29.400
say more about that later but there is no um we've all become humble in terms of predicting the

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:36.760
future in the face of this this virus there are other variants yet to come and we want to

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.320
be able to use the test this year it's i think a sound judgment to go with the shorter form which

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:49.160
will make it more feasible more doable more manageable in whatever circumstances we have

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:58.760
this spring to ensure that we are able to assess students learning so i'm very much in favor of

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:10.280
this this um i think uh prescient um uh act and uh we will um hear more from the public and

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:17.240
get clarifying questions on the table before we deliberate i think that there may be a clarifying

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:25.320
question from member rucker yeah i thank you very much board president um darling ham and i have a

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:32.760
clarifying question for mal and also for cindy now when you were going through in explaining

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:39.880
the assessment times for the shortened smarter balanced assessment based on the blueprint you

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:46.040
identified the amount of time the administration of the items would of the assessment items would be

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:54.600
in each grade since the tests themselves are not timed for the students during the administration

01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:02.040
if there are students who actually do take longer than the times that are shown in your chart they

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:07.960
will still be allowed that additional time they will if they want that they won't be cut off is

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:22.600
that true now we're sorry uh yes absolutely you have as much time as they need to take the test

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:29.080
within the window that their uh their district has determined yeah so i understand that so if

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.480
the assessment so within the assessment window if they want more time then what's shown on your

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:39.800
chart that's fine thank you i appreciate that clarification and then cindy my question to you

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:47.320
on clarification you spoke to when we anticipate the first time the growth model would actually be

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.120
able to give a report based on the idea that we would need three years of statewide assessment

01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:02.200
data for the to use the growth model and so you said that that could happen in 2024 and if i

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:09.080
heard correctly i want to make sure i heard this correctly the only obstacle to that a likely

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:16.600
timeline could be some disruption or some problem with statewide assessments the changes that mal

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:22.440
talked about on the change in the blueprint or the length of the assessment itself or shortening

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:28.600
the smarter balance assessments have nothing to do with the timeline for implementing the growth

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:37.240
model is that correct yes and just a prior point about um the only the only thing would be the

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.680
disruption i i think to um president darlin hammon's comment earlier i i'm not going to

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.880
commit to anything on on that piece we are doing our best to make sure that you know we have as

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:56.040
little disruption as possible but you're absolutely right as far as the the test length and such that

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:01.160
should not impact the growth model it's something that we've been keeping an eye on like i said

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:07.480
with mal and the psychometricians and the experts growth model experts at ets so

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:14.680
we are we are all you know forward looking um ready to produce something come 2024

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:23.320
assuming that again we have testing for three consecutive years okay thank you very much

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.600
i do see other hands and i just want to remind all of our members that we are only doing clarifying

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:36.040
questions right now so anything that is more deliberative we're going to wait till after

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:42.280
public comment but i do have hands here for member burr and member patil bralsen

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.240
member burr

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.080
and you are on mute

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:58.920
i was so articulate too i know thank you um i just want to clarify first just to point out

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:05.640
in the item itself the the written item there i feel like there's a lot more rationale for the

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:11.640
recommendation that i would just want to call people's attention to but in that right right up

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:17.560
i just also wanted to clarify that the blueprints we're being asked to approve here are identical

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:24.360
to the blueprints that we used last year again in the face of a raging pandemic that we have no way

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:29.640
of predicting whether or not it's going to end this spring so that that was my clarifying question

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:34.760
are those identical the second one and maybe is a question for tony but i think mal could answer it

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:41.960
as well how many other states in the consortium are have gone to a shortened uh assessment thank

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:50.520
you i believe tony is on but the question to your the first part of your the answer to the first

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:58.840
question you have is yes oh the uh answer to the first question that you had is yes the the

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.040
adjusted blueprint we're bringing forward is identical to the one we used in 2021

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:10.680
and tony i don't have the number committed to memory so if you are available if you could

01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:17.080
share how many other member states yeah thank you oh go ahead go ahead brooks

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:25.880
oh thank you mal um uh for the record this is tony alpert uh president darling hammond and and

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:32.360
members uh member burr i believe i i don't have the exact number but i believe seven states

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:42.840
used the uh some form of the adjusted blueprint uh last year we anticipate that many if not all

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:48.760
of those states are going to continue the use of the adjusted blueprint this spring but we haven't

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:54.440
we haven't surveyed that and i think a lot of states are in a similar position still trying

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.600
to have those conversations with uh critical policymakers and

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:03.160
and uh and stakeholders uh about what should happen this spring

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.320
and um did did we get all of your questions answered

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:25.560
okay i'll go ahead then to member proteo bronson thank you um i just was looking um back at slides

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:35.800
11 and 12 um around uh both what parents would receive and then also what reporting would happen

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:42.200
for groups of 30 or more so if if you could share your thoughts on that and then we'll move on to

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:48.120
and then also what reporting would happen for groups of 30 or more so if you could just clarify

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:58.360
what would parents receive in 21 22 um versus what they'd receive in 22 23 um and then on

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:07.960
slide 11 i think it says that the claims um would be uh released for groups of 30

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:14.520
um but then on slide swell 12 it says that the assess summative assessments for groups

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:19.240
of 30 won't be available and i just if you could clarify the timeline for that as well

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:28.520
yes i can do that what parents and students will receive the overall uh performance scores

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:35.880
the scale scores as well as the achievement level um scores at the individual student level

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:45.800
while we continue to look at reporting out at the composite claims in 2023 the following year

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:55.720
so the claim results when we group them by groups of students of 30 or more on the public reporting

01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:03.720
site you'll see in the claims of reading writing research inquiry or listening for under english

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:11.000
language arts they can't be done at the individual level for the adjusted form

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.800
in this current state however we can do that at the group level at the state level to give you

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:26.040
an indication of how students um performed in those areas and that will be publicly reported

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:33.080
so sorry for purposes of what parents would receive in 21 22 does that mean they'd get for

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:39.800
example school level data and aggregate state level data yeah those will be public information

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:45.720
but in terms of their individual student score reports they will um they'll be able to see how

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:51.800
their students perform um and the scale score that the student received and their achievement level

01:11:51.800 --> 01:12:01.880
the levels of you know um not met standard at or near standard met standard and exceeded standard

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.920
so they'll still receive those achievement levels as well as the scale score and where

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:14.600
the student score landed on the on the range of scale in and that would happen in 21 22 still

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:24.280
yes it will happen in the 2021 we are providing that to parents thank you and maybe just to add

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:29.320
to the clarification there the the scores that would not be available for this year only are

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:38.120
the claim scores which are the sub scores for particular sub elements of the broader ela and

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:45.640
math uh let's move to public comment then uh and so uh do we have any public comment

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.960
yes we do have public comment

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.160
very good

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.000
good

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:01.320
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.000
you have one minute your time begins now

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:19.000
caller ending in eight nine four five your time begins now

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:27.000
so

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:31.000
are you there caller

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.800
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.960
you have one minute your time begins now

01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.760
now

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.040
my name is brexie low price from ed voice ed voice recommends the board reject a proposed

01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:02.360
blueprint and request other options be presented to reduce test taking time losing key summative

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.240
data makes it more difficult to gauge performance on key standards and more difficult to tackle

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:13.400
equity of opportunity and identify achievement gaps across subgroups this is not a wise balance

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:18.440
of testing time with actionable data for teachers and parents there are other ways to balance

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:23.800
testing time in item constructs to collect meaningful summative data the proposed blueprint

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:28.840
will likely force lea's into redundant summative testing at the end of the year when loss of

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:35.160
instructional time is of greatest concern lack of comparable data could also delay the implementation

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.960
of the student growth model during these times schools should be providing parents with more

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:43.880
information about student performance not less thank you

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.880
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.200
you have one minute your time begins now

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.640
good morning jessica saco on behalf of children now welcome new board members

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:07.880
i'd also like to learn the comments with the previous speaker i'd also like to thank you

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:11.880
for the inclusion of the presentations and his casanova to the potential impact of this

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:16.200
recommendation on the development of the growth model while i appreciate the assurance that the

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.040
assessment results from the short form are accurate they do not yield results with the

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.920
same level of position as the full form particularly as it relates to the crane category

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:30.680
currently the starting smarter website refers to these parents offers resources and information

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:36.280
to families on supporting their students based on the distinct crane categories children now is

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.440
concerned that the continued use of the short form will not provide families with the detailed

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.320
level of information they need as well as it's becoming a more permanent change i asked the

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.240
board to recall that the decision to administer a short form assessment was made in a time of

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.640
emergency and was never intended to be made permanent i will conclude with the question

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.560
which is will the short form assessment yoga laxile and quantile scores yielded from the

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.400
full form assessment that were to be added to the student score report thank you

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.520
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time begins

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:20.440
now good morning my name is michael juba and i'm a classroom teacher representing the california

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:28.200
teachers association cta strongly supports the cde's recommendation to continue to use a shorter

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:33.640
adjusted blueprint for the smarter balance some of the assessments in dla and mathematics

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:41.000
for the 2021-22 administration and beyond the cde's recommendation will provide several benefits

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.280
for students and teachers first reducing the number of questions in the computer adaptive

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.640
portions of the test will shorten the overall length of the test and reduce testing time

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:58.360
second shorter testing blocks will give teachers and schools additional flexibility in how they

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:04.760
administer the same assessments and finally we believe that the most accurate and actionable

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:11.240
indicators of an individual student's mastery standards will come from the multiple local

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.160
measures used by teachers that are embedded within the classroom thank you

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.720
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time begins

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:36.040
now i am not just members of telephone news together i also welcome new board members

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.960
our organization supports the intent of using shorter assessments which would reduce the amount

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:47.240
of time students stand on the summative assessment providing for increased instructional time

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:53.240
especially this year as well as more flexibility and scheduling for adequate monitoring we

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.640
understand that the adaptive portion and the integrated performance task of each task will

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.600
be maintained and overall scale scores and achievement levels will be comparable to those

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.800
of prior year however we need a better understanding of the impact that implementation

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:13.560
of a shorter test would have on the implementation of the growth model specifically if we revert to

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:19.480
the full test next year will we be able to use the two versions of the test to confuse the growth

01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.280
model the board should not take any action that would further delay the implementation of the

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:25.800
growth model thank you

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.800
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.960
you have one minute your time begins now

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.160
good morning dr darlin handing the board members i'm going to do the association of california

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:50.440
school administrators acts of force what cde's recommendation to meet the s back suggested

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.680
and for the 21 22 administration the jessica blueprint for strike the right balance at this

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.960
time as the covid 19 pandemic continues to do the short assessment educators will have additional

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:06.360
time to focus on accelerating student learning improving student mental and social emotional

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.520
health while also collecting the necessary data to enhance student learning thank you

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:10.600
you

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.960
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:30.600
minute your time begins now

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:34.680
so

01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.680
caller ending in nine five seven one it is your time to speak

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:48.760
speak

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.760
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.360
minute your time begins now

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:07.640
now

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:12.040
this is see van couie of the charter schools development center we support the goals of the

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.560
shortened test and appreciate the consideration of strains on schools at this time we are

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:23.080
concerned about achieving confidence in the data as well as clarity about what various

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:29.560
cast metrics do and do not mean confidence and clarity are important to understanding schools

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:36.200
successes and opportunities system-wide does the metric show students absolute performance

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:43.880
growth or schools relative value added to school here's an example of how lack of clarity

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:49.960
has high stakes impacts last spring a charter school was closed that actually achieved growth

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:56.520
scores above the state average almost across the board the school had been labeled low performing

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:02.600
however based on distance from standard scores this led to confusion and ultimately to the

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:09.720
closure of a school achieving above average growth for 800 students this is a sign that we need to

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:16.520
do more to achieve system-wide understanding about this data we ask that the board direct

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.960
the cde to improve clarity about what metrics do and don't do to achieve greater system-wide

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:28.600
hello caller please

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.080
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.200
your time begins now

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.200
good morning my name is raselli simian and i'm with the fairing organization network

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.000
i'm calling to recommend for the board to reject the proposed actions and shorting the math and

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:56.120
english language of art assessments for spring 2022 as an organization that represents parents

01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:02.840
we want full and accurate information about the the performance of our students and that's critical

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:08.280
this year especially when a lot of families are experiencing variance in the quality of education

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.720
depending on the program depending on whether they chose for their children to return to school

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.720
return to in person or whether they chose um at any point they choose independent studies

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.240
and so having a full information is key so that we can better support students

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:29.240
and so we recommend doing the full assessments as usual thank you

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.360
that is the end of our public callers

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:45.800
all right thank you very much um we'll now begin board discussion uh and board members please

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:50.200
remember to raise your hand in the participant panel of zoom if you have a question or comment

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:57.640
i see a couple of them are uh raised i do want to start uh and ask one clarifying question myself

01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:05.480
before we get going with uh the full board discussion and this is for cindy kazanis um cindy uh

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:13.880
earlier you talked about the importance of having stable growth measures my understanding

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:21.400
i believe that you were heard to be uh by some callers to be in opposition to this

01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:30.280
recommendation in that concern but i thought i understood that if we did this we would also

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.880
be considering continuing the short form in the future so they would be comparable

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:43.800
so i just want you to clarify uh if i understood correctly and um what your um major point was

01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:51.160
happy to clarify my major my major point was we are absolutely in support of this recommendation

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:58.040
we are working very closely with our assessments division and our testing contractor to ensure that

01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:03.560
any future changes to these assessments will have as little impact as possible on the growth

01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:09.240
model so that we can use the consecutive years of data to produce something in 2024

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:20.040
great thank you um i will now um start um the board discussion and we have uh member escapado

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:29.720
and member patil bronson um in the queue so member escapado great thank you president darling hammon

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:37.080
um you just just a a thought about i know one of the major disadvantages of going to a certain

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:43.560
assessment is the individual claim scores i'm just a thought i applaud what we're doing informative

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:52.280
assessments and i just wonder if we can amplify those workshops so that these claims scores can

01:24:52.280 --> 01:25:00.840
be created through the format assessment and and and i think we can never um as an organization

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:08.840
we also have to magnify formative assessment as much as our summative assessments that

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:13.880
it is truly during these formative assessments when we actually will be able to

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:22.680
monitor student growth and second um with parents i i know um there's always

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:32.920
a lack of understanding of sometimes the results i know our organizations have have clips to help

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.800
parents understand the scores and i i just hope that there's

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.240
messaging for parents and the changes and what are these changes and what these changes mean

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:52.040
and then how can parents help their students giving them ideas and how to help their students

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:59.320
once they receive these assessments thank you thank you and and i thank you for mentioning

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:05.000
the formative and i'll also add a mention of the interim assessments smarter balance has built out

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:13.320
quite extraordinary repertoire of both formative and interim assessments that do allow educators

01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:19.560
to drill down and see how students are doing you know within those individual claims and even

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:26.680
below that level within particular content and topic areas so we do have those tools we are

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:32.680
working hard to make sure that people can use them effectively and so that is a an important

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:38.920
part of the system as a whole member glover woods it looks like um member batia brunson you

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:44.280
took your hand down because it was still up from before is that right okay member glover woods

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:54.120
thank you president darlin ham and good morning again i just wanted to share my support as well

01:26:54.120 --> 01:27:00.360
for the shortened form i know it's been mentioned that we approved that shortened blueprint

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:07.000
really as a response to the emergent situation with the pandemic and what we do know is that

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.320
even though students have returned to in-person instruction which is absolutely wonderful

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:18.520
the school year has had a varying type of start if you will as unfortunately students and staff

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:23.240
have contracted the virus or people have needed to be quarantined so there's still a lot of

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:29.720
uncertainty as was mentioned in president darlin ham and comments being able to approve the

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:36.120
shortened form of the shortened blueprint really provides lea's with the opportunity to start

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:42.040
planning now what those testing schedules would need to look like in the spring in case there

01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:50.200
needs to be some mitigation and result to making sure that everybody is safe so i definitely want

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.520
to be sure that we keep that in mind and also as has been mentioned in some other comments

01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.960
the fact that there are local assessments as well formative assessments that are being

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:07.880
administered at schools that will continue to provide additional information to students and

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:14.840
their performance so we're excited we want to be able to have the smarter balance assessments

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:19.480
administered in the spring we know those summative assessments are important that

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.960
combined with the interim assessments and formative assessments at the local level

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:29.880
should provide schools as well as parents a lot of good information on how children are doing this

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:38.440
year thank you very much and just for those who may not have been present during our deliberations

01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:45.480
last spring one of the challenges we had was the length of the smarter balance tests in terms of

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:52.600
being able to get them accomplished during the pandemic so given that we can't entirely predict

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:58.840
that is an important part of being sure we can move forward with assessments this year i have

01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.800
many folks who want to get in the conversation i'll just let you know we're a little behind

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.920
schedule so i'll ask you to keep your remarks to the point so we can get to a motion

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.960
the member rucker member rodriguez member bananca and member strouse

01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:24.920
thank you very much i will just say i was also struck by the report from now about the other

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:33.080
assessments that will be added to the assessment schedule in school so there's the pisa the pearls

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.800
the tems and all of these are for purposes of research and developing comparative information

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:48.200
about the performance of our school instructional plant programs as well as the attainment of skills

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:55.880
and knowledge among our students and so with all of these assessments and given the length of them

01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:01.880
in addition to the local assessment activities as well as the formative assessment activities

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:07.720
it seems that as we go into this school year where there's a lot of changes that students

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:16.040
are tasked to cope with what has not changed is the multiple assessment environment that students

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:25.000
also need to contend with so let me just suggest that as we as this school year goes forward and

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000
districts are doing the struggle of dealing with the struggles that they are coping with in reality

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:38.040
and in real time on a day-to-day and hour-by-hour basis that we also understand that while we sit

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:43.960
here and operate at the 5 000 foot level the reality of all these additional assessments

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:52.200
and the assessment environment that we are asking students to function well in we need to consider

01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:59.880
not only what we're tasking students to do but what we are taxing students in doing all of these

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:06.120
assessments so i do have that concern even though it is something that is important

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:13.720
and significant i would just ask us to consider the question is all of this additional frenetic

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:22.600
activity for assessment and testing actually required and necessary that is an important

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:29.320
question for all of us to consider let me just clarify if in case people are counting up all of

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:34.760
those assessments that anyone involve any schools the small number of schools involved in tims or

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:40.920
pisa or nape are not the same schools so we will not have any children taking all of those tests

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:47.480
we will have a small number of schools each taking one of them but it is a valid point always to

01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:57.720
worry about the total impact of assessment member rodriguez thank you president darlene hamond

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:03.560
and i want to echo what's already been said so i won't repeat it and i'll just say that with my

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:11.400
experience as a classroom teacher currently working with students i i'm in support of this

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:17.560
recommendation and i appreciate this recommendation very much because i have you know firsthand

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:21.640
information of the assessments that we as teachers are giving our students right now

01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:30.520
and also what our students are going through and i'd like to thank mao definitely and cindy for

01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.520
their presentation and also wish dr zilbert a great retirement and thank you for your contributions

01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:43.400
and offer my deepest condolences to michelle glippa michelle glippa's family members and

01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:53.560
thank you thank you very much member bananca yeah so first of all i want to thank the cd for

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:59.800
putting together such an informative and detailed presentation and just to add along to the support

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:04.600
on this recommendation with like a student perspective of someone who did take the cask

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:09.960
test last year with the shortened blueprints i found that this shortened test was absolutely

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:16.760
beneficial to my class from what i observed many students especially those connecting from home

01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:22.280
had trouble with tech issues or internet issues which definitely slowed them down and i was one of

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:26.840
those students that did get slowed down i started my test about halfway through the class period

01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:31.480
so this shortened period or this shortened version of the test gave us the flexibility though

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:37.560
to account for that that loss of time because of these internet issues which allowed more

01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:42.920
students to fully complete the test in the time that we were given in class so i think that it is

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:47.480
important to note that while there might be somewhat of a trade-off in how detailed the reports are

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:53.240
this is offset by the fact that more students are able to fully complete their tests in class

01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.040
in addition if some students and some districts were to go back to quarantine obviously we can't

01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:06.120
predict covid so this might happen i think that this blueprint would be more equitable in that

01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.760
the students with internet issues are probably going to be disproportionately

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:15.960
socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural students so in terms of equity i think this

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:21.720
recommendation would definitely improve the equity among students so all in all i really

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:25.240
support this recommendation and i think it would be a great benefit to students this year

01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.520
thank you so much member strouse

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:34.680
so i want to thank the ct team for an amazing thorough and comprehensive presentation and i

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.760
do think ensuring this out with county offices and out with districts we could help them

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:47.320
and understand all the information that was part of this item and just for the public to know that

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:53.080
this presentation is available but i think we have a responsibility to communicate out to the field

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.960
i think we have a responsibility to communicate out to the field the comprehensiveness and the

01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:04.600
variety of assessment options and all the work that we're doing secondly i appreciate the

01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:11.080
clarification around the growth model which we've been working on for five years and the intent that

01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:16.040
we are going forward with the growth model i think there was some questions from the letters

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:20.760
about that and i just wanted to clarify that we have every intent of using this for the growth

01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:28.360
model this reliable data is going to provide us important information and i just appreciate

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.960
dr excavator's comments as well as dr global woods comments on formative assessments and how

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:39.400
important that is in the process this is going to give us a point in time that schools use for lots

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:45.480
of instructional reflection and planning but the work that we do ongoing with students every day

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.640
to inform their the instructional decisions and support for students who need help that's the

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:56.520
whole picture and i think that we have to remember that this is one type of assessment and the

01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:01.400
formative assessments and the opportunities to inform our teaching and learning are really

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.560
critical particularly as everyone has noted that this coming back we didn't come back fully the

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:12.840
way we expected to and that this year is continuing to be challenging for everybody so again i want to

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:18.840
thank you for a thorough presentation and i support the recommendation thank you thank you

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.720
and i'll just take the opportunity to reinforce the point that you made that the growth model is

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:30.360
an ongoing commitment and the reliability of the total score on the smarter balanced

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:37.080
assessments will not be affected by this decision and we were never going to use the claim scores

01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:44.440
for the growth model so that does not this does not undermine our ability to continue our plans

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:50.200
for the use of the growth model uh but uh member petio bronson your hand is up again right yeah

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:57.800
that's correct thank you um so thank you to to mel for uh the presentation and for also um

01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:04.840
clarifying so much of of uh material that is quite dense um uh i i particularly wanted to

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.120
lift up i think one of the points that board member escapado had just lifted which is that

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:16.760
there are multiple measures and there are formative and interim assessments that are

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.960
being made available at the level of school community leaders who are on the instructional

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:30.120
side and i think we just need to be more intentional about how we share that same information with

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:36.280
parents and with community members because the multiple measures the richness of what multiple

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:42.600
measures offers is sometimes not reaching parents and community members and in the same way that

01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:49.320
we were just uh hearing from um board member strauss about the need to and responsibility

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:55.320
to communicate out all of that information to the school community that has to also crest into

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:04.280
families into community members um as well thank you sorry i'll also just say i i very much

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:11.880
appreciate um many of the uh comments that were uh mailed in and emailed in about how this also

01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:17.560
reclaims more instructional time which i think is just absolutely necessary given given the last year

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.600
thank you so much so i'm going to see if someone wants to make a motion

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:33.240
member rodriguez yes i would like to make a motion and i'll second i was too late to get my

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:42.120

long underway incredible leadership that you have provided including the opportunity to work with

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:46.840
you and many other youth leaders in our conversations about engaging young people

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.920
to get a vaccine thank you for your thoughtful comments it is a pleasure to have you here i'd

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.640
like to ask the board members if we could just take a moment to acknowledge that on this week

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:04.040
we will celebrate the anniversary of september the 11th and to recognize many who lost their lives

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:10.680
including many californians who lost their lives and to recognize those in public safety who also

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:18.440
lost their lives trying to secure safety and security for those so if we could with your

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.440
concurrence madam president just a moment a brief moment of silence as we celebrate that anniversary

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:28.840
thank you for your recognition as you all know this is the first board meeting since all of our

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:37.400
california schools have opened 10 000 of them it has been as you all have noted quite the experience

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.920
let me just be strength-based and start out by saying i've had a chance to visit a dozen or so

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:49.960
districts in the state of california and i've had a chance to visit a dozen or so districts

01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:56.200
saying i've had a chance to visit a dozen or so districts going back to july since they've opened

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.040
including julia vista elementary school district to see great things and i have to tell you

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.920
even with the challenges that we're experiencing with the delta variant the in the energy for a new

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:14.840
school year has been incredible i have to tell you that at every single district that i have visited

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:20.840
and i know that dr darling hammon has done as well upwards of 90 to 95 percent of the students

01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:26.360
have returned their families eager to get our students back for in-person instruction there's

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:31.800
no question that we have to continue to monitor the impacts that the delta variant can have and

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.480
we have to do everything that we can to accelerate the uptake of vaccines in this state and in this

01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:44.600
country to help keep everyone safe but what our schools are doing is just beyond heroic and

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:50.680
i just want to acknowledge every educator first with our students for their resilience their

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:56.760
teachers and classified staff our administrators our parents our volunteers everyone is working

01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:04.520
hard to make this work the legislature has given new guidance for how i would say the almost five

01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:10.200
percent of california students who are requesting some form of remote education the legislature has

01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:15.560
given us ab 130 which allows them to do that through independent study and the independent

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:21.640
study guidelines have been refreshed to allow for additional ways to ensure that students get

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:27.480
support that as as member bonanca said that students have access to computers and high

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:32.840
speed internet that someone is monitoring their progress as you probably have heard

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.960
independent study has quickly become the way for families that need to quarantine

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.760
to stay connected with their schools and it's been difficult i'll just acknowledge that none

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:49.000
of us has ever lived through a pandemic before there's no blueprint for how to do this it has

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.280
been difficult at times and we must acknowledge that but again also acknowledge their heroic

01:43:54.280 --> 01:44:00.760
efforts of everyone to get our schools open and to keep everyone safe including all of our public

01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:04.600
health advocates the california department of public health who we've worked with in the

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:09.560
governor's office to secure five million rapid covid tests that our schools can use for free by

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.080
the way they've all been used up and now we're working closely with the department of public

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:18.040
health to get more of those tests and of course the legislature and the governor have provided

01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:24.040
billions to our schools to purchase all the covid mitigations that they need we've gone through many

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.080
webinars showing schools how to get open how to do outdoor classrooms how to use more ventilation

01:44:29.080 --> 01:44:34.280
how to sanitize the campuses at the end of the day this is the moment and there is nothing more

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:39.800
important than what we do around covid mitigations and of course putting in place the kind of mental

01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:46.040
health and social emotional resources that we must provide our students and our educators

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:52.920
and our families to deal with the trauma that covid 19 has created we'll talk more about that

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:57.880
but obviously the state budget has provided some four billion dollars for mental health

01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:01.880
three billion dollars for community schools and it is an honor for the california department

01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:06.760
of education and state board and others to be working to implement how these programs will be

01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:12.040
there to support our students just a word on vaccinations it's a game changer we continue

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:16.920
to work on how to increase the rates to vaccination in our state we've made this

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:22.680
a mainstay of our conversations about how to get schools open keep them open keep us all safe

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:29.720
we've held a number of town halls focused on vaccines we've had a number of vips and celebrities

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:35.000
helping us get the word out a man a number of elected officials help us get the word out

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.760
we held a town hall where we reached out to more than half a million people in los angeles county

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:47.320
which has some of the highest rates of covid infection and we literally held a vaccine town

01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:53.400
hall with more than 60 000 participants where we talked about vaccines where we've offered vaccine

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:59.320
incentives for those to get a vaccine we continue to support the efforts of everyone

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:06.360
to get a vaccine for everyone who is 12 and older at the same time that we're dealing with delta

01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.720
variant many of our families are dealing with the devastation of wildfire and i just have to

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:18.440
acknowledge so many who've been impacted by wildfire and we've had the opportunity on last week

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:25.080
to visit with students and families and educators in eldorado county and in particular those who've

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:31.480
been impacted by the calador fire and it is devastating to be in communities where an entire

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:36.360
community has been leveled and where schools have been burned down and homes have been burned down

01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.440
but i want to commend our students and their families and their educators for their resilience

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:46.600
and their creativity in finding ways to support student learning even under the most difficult

01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:52.600
circumstances and of course i have to acknowledge our first responders our firefighters who have

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:59.240
been working relentlessly to stem and contain these fires and congratulate them on their most

01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:04.440
recent progress in the tahoe area and in many other communities and allowing some families

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:09.720
to return i want to thank our our partners at the california department of education foundation

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:15.800
california is dedicated to education foundation for helping us to raise dollars to bring resources

01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:21.320
to those families we were able to provide them with gas cards hotel vouchers food and of course

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:27.080
books and our visit to eldorado county our students were in the library they were reading

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:32.280
they were learning they were having support and so even in the face of adversity our students

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:37.160
persist and continue to learn let us continue to do all that we can to support our families

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:44.040
who are impacted by wildfire who are impacted by the many challenges that has been presented to us

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:50.920
by covet 19 in these last 18 months i want to acknowledge that during the pandemic we have

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:59.240
created a new youth advisory council a statewide youth advisory council we've launched this to

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:04.920
create voice to hear from our students on all matters related to education i'm asking these

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:10.280
students to advise me and my staff to advise the governor and the legislature in all matters and of

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.960
course we would like to create an opportunity for our newly forming statewide advisory council

01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:21.480
youth advisory council to have a chance to present and have dialogue with you the members of the

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.840

from board members like board member ananka we will also be launching a first ever statewide

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.760
parent advisory council to create a formal structure for parents to give more voice on

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:45.080
matters related to education and we're excited to partner with many education advocates we're

01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:51.240
excited to have created during the pandemic our first ever family engagement division families

let us know what you heard from board member banaka how during the pandemic technology issues

01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:00.440
were a challenge how families weren't always connected to school and so we've created this

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:05.960
family engagement unit to help us think about how to steer through some of the big challenges that

01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:11.880
we're seeing including enrollment decline how do we help students maximize attendance support our

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:18.440

beyond any in terms of what they have done during this pandemic to give us the platforms to speak

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:23.960
to listen to and educate our state but technology requires all kinds of vision and support and she's

01:57:23.960 --> 01:57:30.200

of our deputy superintendent sarah neville morgan who has just put this on her shoulders all at a

02:00:53.880 --> 02:01:00.680
time when there was a major transition happening in programs with all child care programs moving

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.560
to the department of social services a difficult move but an opportunity to create alignment that's

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:11.080
going to mean more efficiency for families who are supported by the various programs that are

02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:16.520
subsidized child care programs connect to just have to acknowledge incredible leadership of sarah

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:22.680

written an incredible guide for school reopening and has taken countless meetings with stakeholders

02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:13.880
on how we support them what's not known about cde is that it is just a job unto itself managing

02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:20.680
what is 2 000 employees focusing on reporting for focusing on support on technical assistance

02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:25.800

02:06:19.480 --> 02:06:25.880
cce so you helped develop the theory and the policy documents and with your work as a school

02:06:25.880 --> 02:06:32.360

made to our work by dr stephanie gregson who has led with grace and intelligence in these

02:08:11.960 --> 02:08:16.600

point of cce where she will help strengthen our system of support and i also want to recognize

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:27.880

who've just done enormous work to lift not only the work of this over this pandemic year but also

02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:21.320
to lift all these new initiatives that are beginning and really redefining and reinventing

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:26.200
the system of education in california so it's a trying time it's a challenging time it's an

02:09:26.200 --> 02:09:33.080
exciting time it's a time for a lot of hard work and joining of hands i thank superintendent tony

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:39.320
thurman for all of the good colleagueship in figuring out how we move forward and then in

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:46.520
helping it happen and i'm i'm excited about the year ahead i do want to recognize and thank all

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:52.440
of the educators and staff and districts across the state of california for their amazing efforts

02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:58.440
to launch this new in-person school year just as the delta variant is sweeping the country

02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:05.160
like superintendent thurman i have seen and many of you have seen and experienced the excitement

02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:13.160
and the joy of people coming back to school our educators have shown extraordinary planning skills

02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:20.440
and deep levels of commitment to create that joyful and purposeful opening in 100 percent of

02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:25.640
our districts while at the same time putting in place the mitigation strategies that allow

02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:31.960
our opening to be safe the wide range of social and emotional programs and engagement activities

02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:38.440
that allow the opening to be personalized and supportive for our young people and of course you

02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:45.480
know delta has complicated the well-laid plans of our school leaders it's required expanded testing

02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:51.320
there have been some quarantines but i want to tell you that in contrast to many other states

02:10:51.320 --> 02:10:57.800
the path to opening schools in california has been extremely promising thus far thanks to all

02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.720
of those focused efforts of principals teachers support staff parents students superintendents

02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:09.400
and all of the folks in the department and the county office with continued vigilance

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:16.280
and state policy support our path promises to be even smoother in the coming months as of this

02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:21.480
week our 20 largest districts plus more than a thousand smaller districts have opened on schedule

02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:26.920
there have been community-based infections identified by schools testing programs

02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:33.000
it's required some quarantines as students return schools have largely made the necessary

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.600
preparations to manage those processes and those that were taken by surprise have been getting

02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:45.080
help from the state school outbreak response teams that are offering testing and vaccine resources

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:51.960
connecting them to the state's COVID-19 providers who offer multiple options for different types of

02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:59.240
no-cost testing systems to meet community needs nearly 700 of the state's 1,000 districts

02:11:59.240 --> 02:12:04.520
had already taken advantage of these programs before the start of school and more are setting

02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:10.360
up their programs every day and schools are continuing the great work they did this past

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:16.600
summer when nine out of ten did offer summer programming and they have been doing an excellent

02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:22.040
job of keeping students safe with improved ventilation and teaching students to wear their

02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:29.000
masks with pride and practice good hygiene parents have most voiced support and gratitude for these

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.120
safety measures in most districts more than 95 percent of students have returned for in-person

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:42.360
instruction again in most districts i want to give you a little national perspective on where we are

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:49.240
there's a service called burbio that reports school closings and tracks those things across

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:55.080
the country and they report that 1,400 schools in 35 states have closed for quarantining or

02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:00.520
reverted to distance learning across the country fewer than 10 of them have been in california

02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:05.880
and all of those have reopened quickly or are set to do so with the support of the state

02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:12.280
we educate about 12 percent of the nation's school children our schools open earlier than

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:17.880
many parts of the country for example in the midwest and the northeast and still we account

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:24.200
for far less than one percent of the school closings in the country and while covid case

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:29.160
rates have been climbing to very high rates in most parts of the country california's rates of

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:36.440
cases are not only among the lowest and far below the national average but they've been

02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:43.000
sharply declining for the last three weeks and so we are in a much better position because of the

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.920
policies that have been undertaken here places like georgia and florida and texas and so on have

02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.800
rates of covid infection that are four times higher they have rates of pediatric infection that are

02:13:53.800 --> 02:14:00.040
five six seven times higher than in california and it's important for us to understand why this

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:07.000
is and how we can continue to make progress toward ending the pandemic back in july california was

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:12.520
the very first state in the nation to issue a renewed masking mandate for all adults and

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:17.880
children in schools as well as for adults in indoor settings even before the cdc did so

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:24.760
since then at least 16 other states have done so in the last week or so as they were overwhelmed

02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:31.240
by covid cases in their schools on august 11th california became the first state to require

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:37.000
vaccines or weekly testing of all school employees on the heels of a similar requirement for

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.520
government workers now other states and cities across the country are beginning to follow suit

02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:48.920
since last spring we have at least partially vaccinated more than 80 percent of our eligible

02:14:48.920 --> 02:14:55.400
population the state is supporting school located vaccine clinics for every school that will host

02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:02.200
them offering 50 000 to support schools who do who will do so this can be an especially

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:08.440
critical strategy for getting both students and families vaccinated and as you know the governor

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.640
with our state public health and education leaders legislative leaders our state superintendent

02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:18.840
has been laser focused on providing the tools or resources that would be needed for safe school

02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:25.800
reopening we had that six billion dollar package last march to fund safety measures such as ppe

02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:33.160
and ventilation upgrades and covid 19 testing more than 98 of districts have used those funds

02:15:33.880 --> 02:15:40.440
with the the funds to kick off the school year with expanded mental health after school learning

02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:47.160
supports like high dose tutoring keenly aware of the students who've experienced trauma and lost

02:15:47.160 --> 02:15:52.920
instructional time in the last year and a half since covid has hit and educators themselves of

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:58.760
course have experienced sources of trauma in their own families giving so much of themselves to take

02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:04.840
care of our children and their own children often at the same time in a version of multitasking that

02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:11.880
has never before been so complex or so remarkable so i just want to say to all of the committed

02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:17.160
educators and school staff who are handling all of the complexities of the school year and to the

02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:23.160
parents and students who are doing the same that if we can stay the course things will be much

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:29.560
easier in the weeks and months ahead the science clearly shows that the multi-layered mitigation

02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:35.640
strategies diligent masking testing screening hand washing ventilation are effective at

02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:40.760
preventing infection we have a lot of studies that show that in schools and child care centers

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:47.080
where that is the case there is very little transmission even when there are cases in the

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:53.960
community as a whole we're making progress on vaccines like half of our 12 to 17 year olds are

02:16:53.960 --> 02:17:00.680
vaccinated a vaccine is expected for five to 11 year olds by early winter we should see a vaccine

02:17:00.680 --> 02:17:06.520
for two to four year olds within a few months after that for those of us who have children and

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:16.520
our grandchildren in day care and preschool so as we continue on this path with purpose

02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:22.040
and with diligence we will see cases and illnesses continue to decline and we'll see

02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:28.440
fewer needs for quarantining state board and cde are working to get schools the latest information

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:36.280
from cde and the department of public health clarifying that even if cases do appear vaccinated

02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.760
students and adults who might have been exposed do not need to quarantine as long as they have

02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:47.080
no symptoms nor do unvaccinated children if both parties are wearing masks at the time of the

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:53.160
exposure with testing they can be in school safely we can support in-person teaching and learning with

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:59.320
minimum disruptions and so while there is a long way to go and many challenging moments ahead

02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:08.360
California's policies and our hard work and expert educators and committed parents and students

02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:16.200
can continue to lead the way through this pandemic to a safer future that supports children

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:20.920
in their learning their development their relationships their friendships their social

02:18:20.920 --> 02:18:26.600
and emotional well-being and their educational progress and with that I want to turn the

02:18:27.800 --> 02:18:37.240
podium back to superintendent Thurman for one more announcement and final staff blessing

02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:44.040
as we move forward superintendent Thurman thank you darling ham and I think it needs to be said

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:49.240
that our state board president is the smartest and hardest working state board president anywhere

02:18:50.600 --> 02:18:55.880
I think you can see that Dr. Darling-Hammond is at the intersection of all aspects of what we're

02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.680
doing to support teaching and learning and to support all the COVID mitigations and all the

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:06.200
ways to ensure that our students are getting an opportunity to have what they deserve a quality

02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:10.840
education it's an honor to partner with you Dr. Darling-Hammond and I think your report puts in

02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:17.560
context just how much California is doing and I gotta say I'm proud to be a California and so

02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:22.280
thank you Dr. Darling-Hammond for your partnership thank you for this opportunity just to provide

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:25.480
some final remarks and of course I'll take questions from the board members I did want to

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:32.520
also just share the mic with Dr. Stephanie Gregson if she wanted to have some final words this is her

02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:38.680
last time sitting on the dais at least for now Dr. Gregson did you want to have some remarks

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:45.640
thank you superintendent Thurman and thank you for president Linda Darling-Hammond for your remarks

02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:50.040
and vice president Eileen Strauss and thank you also to the other board members who have reached

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:55.400
out and shared some very kind words they are very much appreciated it has been a journey the past

02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:01.000
five years for myself and with you as state board members and I've appreciated all of the supports

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:06.440
the questions and the challenges that we faced together over those past five years going through

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:11.560
frameworks and structural materials adoptions and most recently these past 18 months and supporting

02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:18.360
all of our districts as they navigated the challenges of the pandemic I also want to thank

02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:28.200
the CDE team they are amazing and phenomenal hard working people and we could not do what we do

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:34.200
without each and every one of them and so I just want to have a big shout out to our CDE team

02:20:34.200 --> 02:20:38.520
and also much appreciation to our state superintendent Tony Thurman who provided

02:20:38.520 --> 02:20:43.160
me this opportunity and without this experience and learning I wouldn't have figured out what I

02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:48.520
want to do when I grow up and I am honored and privileged to have learned so much and to be able

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:53.560
to join the CCE because that's what I want to do when I grow up and supporting districts

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:58.600
who are struggling and taking all of the great work from CDE and helping them and so I thank you

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:03.320
for all of your support and guidance over the past years and I will look forward to working

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:11.480
with all of you in my new role thank you so much thank you Dr. Gregson again congratulations we're

02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:15.400
looking forward to working with you in your new role one of the things that I learned from Dr.

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:23.080
Gregson is that the needs of the Department of Education are great many of them go unseen but

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:28.120
they are important to how we support districts and how we show up for districts and it is for

02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:38.200
that purpose and for that reason that in August I named Mary Nicely as a co-chief deputy superintendent

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:44.680
now I'm teeing up Mary for you to come to the podium so that I can present you to the state

02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:52.360
board for the board to take action on the item related to approval of a chief deputy

02:21:52.360 --> 02:22:01.640
superintendent elect or designee of Mary Nicely you know the workload is intense and so in the

02:22:01.640 --> 02:22:07.480
next days and weeks I'll also be sharing with you updates about two new positions that we'll be

02:22:07.480 --> 02:22:13.560
creating on the executive team at the Department of Education there'll be grant-funded positions

02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:21.560
that allow us to have additional deputies who can work on many many of the challenges that our

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:28.840
districts are facing as they continue to work so hard to serve our kids and stay open and keep them

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:34.600
open safely and I want to make sure to acknowledge our incredible communications director Maria

02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:40.040
Clayton who's been helping you know those dozen districts that we get to the media is in tow

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:44.840
chasing us down every step of the way Dr. Escobedo can attest to that getting the message

02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:49.400
out about the importance of vaccines has been our communications team and of course our incredible

02:22:49.960 --> 02:22:57.240
government affairs team now led by a veteran CDE member and Amy Tang Paterno 13 years

02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:03.240
working on fiscal policy at CDE we have big challenges ahead obviously managing COVID

02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:08.840
providing supports and emotional supports to our students and closing learning gaps

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:15.320
gratefully we have a budget that has millions for mental health for community schools for universal

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:20.520

02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:26.280
and for expanded learning and of course record in historic investments for special education

02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:30.840
and our ability to serve students with disabilities I'm pleased to present to you

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:37.240
someone who I've had the pleasure of knowing for more than a decade who has supported me in every

02:23:37.240 --> 02:23:46.280
aspect of my public service and who is just committed to young people Mary Nicely has served

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:52.840
at the department of education first as senior advisor to me and also leading our office of

02:23:52.840 --> 02:24:00.040
superintendents initiatives again in the work to close the digital divide again in the work to help

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:09.160
close the opportunity gap and our work to diversify our workforce especially our efforts to

02:24:09.160 --> 02:24:14.120
expand the number of male educators of color who work in our schools I'm very proud of a

02:24:14.120 --> 02:24:19.640
bill that we sponsored this year on male expanding male educators of color that has now become

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:25.240
part of the state budget and the hundreds of millions of dollars available for teacher

02:24:25.240 --> 02:24:29.880
recruitment and we look forward to speaking with you about those and so we have many tools

02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:35.000
to help us build better than we've ever done before and build an education system that works

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:40.920
for all of our students that cuts across equity gaps and envisions ways to help all of our students

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.480
and I'm pleased to present to you a special leader who can help us and join our executive

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:50.600
team in leadership and work closely with our state board on many of the aspects in addition to

02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:56.040
having worked at CDE Mary Nicely has served with me when I was in the state assembly

02:24:56.040 --> 02:25:02.360
versus my district director and as my chief of staff before that Mary Nicely ran a data

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:08.120
management company that specializes in supporting schools in how they manage their data and has

02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:14.680
worked for many years in the technology sector and so it is amazing and exciting to see the vision

02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:21.400
that she has for helping CDE and schools in California to close the digital divide I borrow

02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:29.320
this phrase from her that she often says that internet connectivity should flow like electricity

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:35.560
and she is right Mary Nicely is a compassionate leader who is detailed oriented who finds a way

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:44.520
in her trademark way to GSD get stuff done she's an incredible leader who is compassionate and it

02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:51.000
is a pleasure to present her to you now members of the state board for your action as it relates

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:57.560
to the item related to appointing a chief deputy superintendent I present to you Mary Nicely

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:09.080
and Mary before you speak I have to do a moment of a protocol vote because we need to vote twice

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:15.880
this item was added to the agenda on September 7th and because the need for action came to the

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:21.720
attention of the board after the agenda was posted on August 30th we need to take these two votes

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:27.080
first we have to vote to allow ourselves to vote on Mary and I do want to hear Mary's comments

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:34.040
before we vote on her but we do need to unfortunately take a minute open up the

02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:41.400
uh phone line for public comment for this item so that if somebody could put the public comment

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:47.240
slide up we will be able to allow for that to happen I'll ask board members if they have any

02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:52.600
comments they wish to make then we're going to vote to make the determination that there is a

02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:58.280
need to take immediate action on this item and then we'll hear from Mary and then we will be

02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:04.600
able to vote on her and so are there any comments from board members while we're waiting

02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.240
for public comment if there is any to queue up

02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:18.200
I'm not seeing any hands raised on that so I will ask is there any public comment

02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:26.360
there is not at this time all right thank you please interrupt me if there is anyone who comes

02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:33.240
to the floor and so now I want to ask if there's a motion for the state board to make a determination

02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:37.960
that there's a need to take immediate action on this item and that the need came to the attention

02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:43.800
of the CDE and the state board after the posting of the agenda this motion requires a two-thirds

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:48.760
vote so we need eight affirming votes of the state board of education do I have a motion

02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:57.240
motion so moved thank you very much do I have a second I will second thank you very much

I'll see you in 14 minutes.

02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:18.920
I'd like to ask that the State Board provide feedback regarding the draft

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:25.960
LCAP template and instructions that incorporate the requirements outlined in SB 98 and AB 130

02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:31.480
as well as the draft for the 2021-22 supplement template and instructions.

02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:37.880
And the item will be presented by Lindsay Tornatore and Josh Strong of the CDE. Lindsay and

02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:45.640
Josh please begin. Thank you very much. Sound check good. Okay good morning President Darling

02:31:45.640 --> 02:31:50.920
Hammond, Vice President Strauss, Chief Deputies Gregson and Nicely and members of the board.

02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:55.880
My name is Lindsay Tornatore and I am the Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division.

02:31:55.880 --> 02:32:00.760
I am joined today by my colleague Josh Strong who is the Administrator of the Local Agency

02:32:00.760 --> 02:32:06.520
System Support Office otherwise known as LASO. Josh and I are here today to present five proposed

02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:12.520
revisions to the Local Control and Accountability Plan as prescribed by SB 98 and AB 130.

02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:17.960
But before we dive into today's item I want to take a few minutes to acknowledge and appreciate

02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:23.320
two great leaders who have made a strong positive impact on the LCAP and have been instrumental in

02:32:23.320 --> 02:32:27.960
helping all of us get to where we are today with the LCAP. So as Superintendent Thurman shared

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:32.840
earlier our former Deputy Superintendent on the Instruction and Measurement Branch Rachel Maze

02:32:32.840 --> 02:32:37.720
left the CDE last month to pursue an opportunity with the Tennessee Department of Education.

02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:44.360
Rachel came to us from the County Office of Education and prior to that as a Superintendent

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:49.800
of a rural district where she was the author of her district's LCAP. Rachel's experience and

02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:54.680
respect for the LCAP and the process helped my team and I get the initial engagement period

02:32:54.680 --> 02:32:59.320
with our educational partners off to a productive start and the lessons learned from working with

02:32:59.320 --> 02:33:05.560
Rachel inspire us inspire our commitment to make the LCAP a process that is accessible

02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:10.760
and achievable for all LEAs and I also want to acknowledge and appreciate Dr. Gregson.

02:33:10.760 --> 02:33:15.640
Stephanie thank you for your leadership you have called all of us to action by challenging

02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:21.000
everyone at the CDE to approach our work with compassion in every process and procedure that

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:26.120
we implement. You will be missed and we look forward to working continuing to work with you

02:33:26.120 --> 02:33:30.600
as we know you will continue to identify and close gaps that are keeping our students from

02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:38.440
reaching their fullest potentials. And so with that the purpose of today's item so the purpose

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:43.000
of today's item as President Darling-Hammond mentioned is not action but discussion and

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:49.800
feedback. This is the first of two meetings that we will discuss this the LCAP revised revisions

02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:56.360
today and also at the November 2021 meeting. The state board discussion and feedback will

02:33:56.360 --> 02:34:01.320
inform our ongoing revisions that we will continue to make between now and November.

02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:07.160
During the November meeting we will ask the state board to take action to adopt the revised LCAP

02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:12.760
template and instructions and also the one-time supplement to the annual update to the 21-22

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:18.360
LCAP. Our educational partner input will continue to be collected throughout this process and will

02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:22.280
continue to inform the proposed revisions we will bring to the board in November.

02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:31.640
A timeline of significant events that brought us here today in June of 2020 SB 98 was chapter

02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:38.760
and in July of 2021 AB 130 was chaptered. These two bills brought forth four of the five proposed

02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:44.120
revisions that we are bringing to the board today. We also brought the LCAP advisory group

02:34:44.120 --> 02:34:51.160
together Wednesday July 28th of 2021 and we will again reconvene later this month to continue

02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:57.080
to discuss the revisions being proposed to the template and instructions. We held a Tuesday at

02:34:57.080 --> 02:35:03.880
two on August 10th of 2021 and we have another one scheduled for October 5th. We presented these

02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:08.760
proposed revisions that we will discuss today at the California practitioners advisory group meeting

02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:15.560
on August 20th of 2021. Their input feedback informed our approach to this presentation today.

02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:20.440
We also are continuing with ongoing partner educational partner engagement

02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:26.200
continuously collecting input and feedback and also reaching out to meet with partner organizations.

02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:33.480
We will bring this item back to the November meeting and once adopted the anticipated adoption

02:35:33.480 --> 02:35:38.280
in November we will then roll out comprehensive guidance to the field to navigate the new

02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:46.520
requirements. So let's just take a few seconds and ground ourselves in the LCAP itself. So

02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:52.520
adopted in 2014 the local control and accountability plan is a three-year plan that describes the goals

02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:58.600
actions services and expenditures to support positive student outcomes that address state

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:04.520
and local priorities. The LCAP provides an opportunity for LEAs to share their stories

02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:09.640
of how what and why programs and services are selected to meet their local needs.

02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.440
Prior improvements that have been made to the LCAP template since its adoption

02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:18.520
include the addition of the annual update a move to a three-year template

02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:21.560
and the addition of summary tables displayed in a database format.

02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:29.960
So for those of you who are following along at home we have several items posted and linked to

02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:35.480
this agenda. So of course we have our actual item and then we have four attachments. The first

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:41.320
attachment is a summary or sort of a primer of the required and proposed changes the why, when,

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:47.480
who, what, how. Attachment two is the current LCAP template and instructions provided for reference.

02:36:48.040 --> 02:36:53.400
Attachment three and four are the proposed drafts. The attachment three is the LCAP template and

02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:59.000
instructions and attachment four the proposed draft of the one-time annual one-time supplement

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.200
to the annual update to the 21-22 LCAP. In attachments three and four you'll notice that

02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.800
highlighted in yellow throughout the document are our proposed changes.

02:37:11.080 --> 02:37:15.080
So the summary of revisions. We have five revisions that we're going to discuss today.

02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:20.280
We're going to take one at a time and talk through them in a subsection. During each of

02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:25.000
these subsections we're going to answer five big questions. Why is this revision being proposed?

02:37:25.640 --> 02:37:31.400
When does the requirement begin? Who will this impact? What do they need to do? And how will

02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:36.120
they do it? In the how sections Josh will walk us through the proposed revisions to the LCAP

02:37:36.120 --> 02:37:40.120
template and instructions which again can be found in attachments three and four.

02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:46.760
After we discuss each of the five revisions we will close out the presentation of this item by

02:37:46.760 --> 02:37:51.400
sharing what is next for CDE's efforts to continue to engage with our educational partners

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:57.160
until the November board meeting and beyond. We also have a crosswalk of all LEA required plans

02:37:57.160 --> 02:38:02.280
to share today and we hope that this crosswalk will show how the one-time supplement to the

02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:07.400
annual update is intended to give LEAs an opportunity to share their story of how they

02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:12.680
are spending their LCFF and federal emergency relief funds in a manner that is consistent with

02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:23.480
their 21-22 LCAP. All right so revision number one. Requirement to include specific goals in

02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:29.720
the LCAP. Let's start with the why. The why is twofold. First to ensure that LEAs are addressing

02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:36.120
the needs of consistently low performing student groups and to ensure that higher performing LEAs

02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:39.560
are addressing the needs of low performing schools within the LEA.

02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:47.240
So when does this requirement take place? For eligible LEAs and COEs the specific required

02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:54.280
goals will be included beginning with the 22-23 LCAP. CDE staff will annually prepare files that

02:38:54.280 --> 02:39:00.040
indicate for all applicable LEAs which student groups and schools will be required to have goals

02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:07.560
based on these new instructions. So there are two groups of who because this requirement is

02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:13.400
twofold. So the first group is the LEAs that have received technical assistance for the same student

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:19.240
group or groups for three or more consecutive years as reported on the dashboard. The LEAs who

02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:24.280
meet the above criteria must include a goal in the LCAP focused on improving the performance

02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.200
of that student group or groups.

02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:35.480
The second group that this requirement impacts are high performing LEAs with low performing schools.

02:39:36.040 --> 02:39:43.560
Specifically it's LEAs who for two consecutive consecutive years have a school or schools that

02:39:43.560 --> 02:39:48.840
have received the two lowest performance levels on the dashboard on all but one of the state

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:54.360
indicators for which the school receives performance levels. And the all students

02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:58.840
student group for the LEA is at least one performance level higher than the school's

02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:07.880
performance level. What this grouping of LEAs needs to do is to write a goal in the LCAP

02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:12.600
focused on improving the performance of the school or schools that meet this criteria.

02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:22.520
And so the proposed instructions for these requirements can be found on pages 21 and 22

02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:27.400
of attachment 3 and I'm going to turn it over to Josh Strong to walk us through the how for the

02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:35.560
requirement oh sorry excuse me missed a page and I'm going to 21 to 22 of of attachment 3 and I'm

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.040
going to turn it over to Josh to walk us through the attachment of the requirement to include

02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:46.280
specific goals in the LCAP. So we can stop screen share and allow Josh to share his screen please.

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:51.240
Thank you Lindsay.

02:40:54.840 --> 02:41:01.000
Good morning board president and board members. I'm Joshua Strong,

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:10.760
administrator of the local AGC system support office and here is the attachment 3 showing the

02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:18.280
current proposed LCAP template and instructions. As as many of you are aware within the LCAP

02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:25.720
template and instructions an LEA provides it presents its goals in the goals and actions section

02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:33.960
utilizing this template and and so in terms of addressing this particular requirement to

02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:40.920
add these two required goals to the instructions of the plan we didn't feel that there was a need

02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:51.000
to provide specific goals sections for those requirements within the template itself

02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:59.160
rather those are expressly provided within the instructions as as Lindsay has already stated on

02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:11.400
pages 21 and 22 and the approach that we've taken or that we're suggesting at this point in time

02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:20.840
is to within the instructions first provide what the criteria are related to each of the

02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:29.560
goal each of the requirements and then to provide specific instructions for how the LEA would

02:42:29.560 --> 02:42:35.960
would then create that goal and what the goal should address so in terms of the first requirement

02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:43.400
related to the LEAs that have been identified for assistance based on the performance of

02:42:44.280 --> 02:42:52.040
one or more student subgroups for three consecutive years we've provided that criteria

02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:58.440
here at the beginning for the consistently low performing student groups and then the

02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:06.920
instructions related to the specific goal noting that there have the focus of the goal needs to be

02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.560
on improving performance of the student group or groups that led to the LEA's eligibility

02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:17.960
and specifying that the goal must include metrics outcomes actions and expenditures

02:43:17.960 --> 02:43:23.720
that are specific to addressing these needs to the identified needs and improving outcomes for

02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:32.920
these the student group or groups that led to that eligibility and then similarly we have we were

02:43:34.680 --> 02:43:43.320
providing criteria related to the low performing school component and then as before the specific

02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:53.000
instructions related to what that goal needs to focus on and include within the LCAP and then

02:43:53.000 --> 02:44:02.760
as part of of implementing these goals the LCAP the LEA would include one of the goal in which

02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:12.040
they're eligible for or required to include in their LCAP as a regular as as a goal along

02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:20.600
with the other goals within the plan so that's the proposal at at this point in time and I'll

02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:29.640
turn it back over to Lindsay and allow her to move forward. Thank you Josh.

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:40.120
Okay so now at this you get the sound so at this time we can pause

02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:44.520
President Darling-Hammond for clarifying questions about this specific requirement.

02:44:44.520 --> 02:44:49.320
All right are there any

02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:57.400
we also should probably put up the public comment slide so that we can queue up and

02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:01.640
we'll take clarifying questions while we do that if you're at the point for

02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:10.520
for public comment. We actually well I think that we have four more revisions so we could if it's

02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:15.160
okay we'll wait for public comment. We'll wait for that okay so we could take some clarifying

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:23.800
questions.

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:52.920
It appears that we may have a connection issue so let's start with our first clarifying question.

02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:59.640
Looks like Member McQuillan you're first up. Okay thank you. Just wondering about the timeline

02:45:59.640 --> 02:46:05.160
if this amendment is approved what would be the rollout timeline on it? Thank you.

02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:15.480
So the as far as as far as the timeline SB 98 has prescribed that LEAs who fall into either of these

02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:24.360
two criteria must include a specific goal in their LCAP starting with the 22-23 LCAP so we will include

02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:33.960
this in the instructions and template for the 22-23 LCAP. As far as one piece to add is as far

02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:40.680
as notifying LEAs who will be required to add these goals we plan to have that data pulled

02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:45.480
around the time of the November board meeting. Cindy Casanas and her team will be working on that

02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:54.680
data set. So I'm going to take over because Dr. Berlingham is in no end down so until she's back

02:46:54.680 --> 02:46:57.240
on again. Member Burr you're next.

02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:09.640
Member Burr you're muted. Thank you. So my question really relates to not only this item

02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:15.080
but the item that we talked about around assessments. If I understand this correctly

02:47:15.080 --> 02:47:21.640
these specific goals have to be included in the case of sort of persistently under performance

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:27.160
over three years and so can you talk about and maybe this is a question for Cindy

02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:35.800
what indicators will be used to determine whether a district and or an LEA within a district is

02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:43.160
persistently underperforming if we don't have any assessment data that's comparable over three years?

02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:49.720
So we are using historical data for this first data poll and then moving forward once we have

02:47:49.720 --> 02:47:54.680
a full dashboard with all the data indicators we'll use the dashboard. So for this first year

02:47:54.680 --> 02:48:00.760
we'll be using historical data. So we'll be using test scores that are how old?

02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:07.400
I think 2017, 18, and 19.

02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:19.960
Okay. Member Glover-Woods.

02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:30.840
Just a question as far as when the goal or goals are put in the template how will a reader

02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:38.680
differentiate or know that that specific goal or goals is aligned to this particular requirement

02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:42.040
since all of the goals are going to be in the same area on the template?

02:48:43.800 --> 02:48:47.880
Actually you know what can I pass this over to Josh to address?

02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:56.200
Sure thank you. Member Glover-Woods that would be something that would be explained as part of the

02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:03.240
why statement for why the LEA has developed the goal within the goals and actions section. So as

02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:09.240
part of that explanation of why the LEA developed the goal the LEA would include

02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.520
the identification that this is a required goal.

02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:27.720
So Josh just another follow-up question on that. Is it going to be required that the LEA put that

02:49:27.720 --> 02:49:35.080
information in the explanation? Is that in the directions that they must put that in the explanation

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:41.720
so that again it can be clear that this goal is developed for this particular requirement?

02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:46.920
That's not currently in the instructions however that's certainly something that we can include

02:49:47.880 --> 02:49:51.320
if you have a desire for if the board has that desire.

02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:57.720
Thank you. Member Rucker.

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:05.880
Thank you. I have so many questions about the instructions and the information in this template

02:50:05.880 --> 02:50:13.800
but I'll start with this particular clarifying question on setting the who. Do the goals need

02:50:13.800 --> 02:50:21.320
to set differentiated growth targets for these student subgroups as a way for these specific

02:50:21.320 --> 02:50:30.360
student subgroups? For example if I'm sorry for example if African American students are consistently

02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:39.320
the lowest performing student subgroup for all grades tested in all of the areas tested and we

02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:47.880
also have Hispanic students who are also underperforming do the goal statements have

02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:55.160
to differentiate what may be done for African American students as a subgroup and Latino

02:50:55.160 --> 02:51:00.360
students as a subgroup or do they get to say all underperformance will be addressed in this way?

02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:09.080
Okay so board member to your question there is currently in the statute it is not

02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:15.160
prescriptive as far as making a clear distinction between the different student groups.

02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:23.080
So then I don't understand how this is going to actually address I don't understand that I'm glad

02:51:23.080 --> 02:51:28.280
you answered the question that way because I read the statute and the statute doesn't clarify that

02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:33.800
so I'm not clear with these questions or these statements that you're saying will be added to

02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:40.760
the LCAP I'm not clear how we will get to a greater level of clarity or subgroup identification

02:51:41.400 --> 02:51:45.640
without that prescription so are you saying that you're going to be moving beyond that

02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:52.120
description or prescription and adding to what districts have to address are districts still

02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:57.720
because of the statute still not going to actually be required to identify or name those names?

02:51:58.680 --> 02:52:05.640
Well I believe the legislative intention is truly to ensure that districts are addressing

02:52:05.640 --> 02:52:09.720
their low performing student the consistently low performing student groups in their LCAP with

02:52:09.720 --> 02:52:16.120
specific goals as far as where we are right now based on statute is how we have framed most of

02:52:16.120 --> 02:52:20.520
the revisions that we bring to you and that being said we're open to recommendations and

02:52:20.520 --> 02:52:25.000
direction from the board as far as clarifying this to make sure that it is accessible and

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:30.440
achievable for all of our LEAs. Okay so I'm going to stop right there but when we come back to a

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:37.080
broader board discussion I do want to come back to this concern. Thank you member Rucker just

02:52:37.080 --> 02:52:41.880
remember we have several more parts and these are clarifying questions and as member Rucker said

02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:47.240
after our public comments we're going to have a robust discussion about this and this is a not

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:53.160
an action but an information and some comments from the board today and it's you can imagine

02:52:53.160 --> 02:53:00.680
that CPEG had a very complicated discussion about this as well. So Lindsay are we ready to go to the

02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:06.520
I like the neck the way you organized it I think we have the next part now. Yes thank you yes so

02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:12.200
the second requirement is the requirement to calculate carryover. So let's start with the why

02:53:12.200 --> 02:53:17.640
the why is to ensure an LEA is implementing and not just planning to meet its full proportionality

02:53:17.640 --> 02:53:22.440
obligation to increase or improve services for students who are low income English learners and

02:53:22.440 --> 02:53:28.920
or foster youth over and above the level of services provided to all students. As we enter

02:53:28.920 --> 02:53:35.080
so here we go when when will this requirement take place these new requirements to education

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:45.000
code sections 4223 8.07 and 52064 were signed into law on July 9th 2021 through AB 130 and will be

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:52.920
implemented beginning with the 2223 LCAP. This requirement is applicable to all LEAs so as we

02:53:52.920 --> 02:53:57.320
enter into the what and how of this requirement I want to acknowledge that the steps to calculate

02:53:57.320 --> 02:54:03.480
carryover are very complex and technical but we know that it is worth work it is worth working

02:54:03.480 --> 02:54:08.280
through this complexity to achieve a clear and transparent accounting of how students who are

02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:13.080
low income English learners and or foster youth are being served over and above the level of

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:20.600
services provided to all students. So the what has three parts the first one is looking at education

02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:28.680
code section 4223 8.07 which says that it will ensure LEAs are implementing and not just planning

02:54:28.680 --> 02:54:35.000
to meet their full proportionality obligation LEAs are required to document differences between

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:40.280
planned and implemented actions and services and any shortfall between the implemented level of

02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:45.480
actions and services and the proportionality obligation will be carried over into the future

02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:51.800
year to continue to serve our unduplicated students. This statute also establishes that

02:54:51.800 --> 02:54:56.600
any shortfall between the implemented level of actions and services and the proportionality

02:54:56.600 --> 02:55:01.160
obligation can be carried over into the future year to serve its unduplicated students.

02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.200
In the how section Josh will walk you through this requirement as it appears in the template

02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:11.880
and instructions. I also want to note here that there have been questions raised about whether

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:17.400
actions stemming from carryover can be either qualitative or quantitative we believe that

02:55:17.400 --> 02:55:22.120
consistent with the original charge for increase increasing and improving services for our

02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:27.480
unduplicated students the nature of carryover dollars would be the same allowing for both

02:55:27.480 --> 02:55:33.000
qualitative and quantitative actions but I do want to make sure it's very clear we have requested

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:37.720
clarification from our CDE legal team to ensure we are interpreting this statute correctly.

02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:46.120
So a second part of this requirement is that with this new requirement the need to introduce

02:55:46.120 --> 02:55:51.800
new terminology to make a distinction between actions that utilize LCFF funds and actions that

02:55:51.800 --> 02:56:00.920
do not utilize LCFF funds was necessary. So since the inception of LCFF LEAs have had the opportunity

02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:06.040
to meet their minimum proportionality percentage in a number of ways that do not only require

02:56:06.040 --> 02:56:11.720
spending money we have historically used the terms increasing or improving services but these terms

02:56:11.720 --> 02:56:17.240
do not fully encompass the nuances we need to consider for carryover. The new terminology

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.880
quantitative and qualitative provides an opportunity for LEAs to categorize their

02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:27.320
actions in two ways actions that have an associated expenditure and actions that do not have an

02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:32.920
associated expenditure. The reason that these two terms were developed in statute is to make sure

02:56:32.920 --> 02:56:37.320
that when districts are calculating their carryover there is a way to capture both of these types of

02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:42.440
actions that meet the objectives of increasing or improving services for unduplicated pupils under

02:56:42.440 --> 02:56:49.800
LCFF. So again LEAs can utilize both types of actions to meet their proportionality obligation

02:56:49.800 --> 02:56:56.840
and the distinction between the actions is that a quantitative action has associated LCFF expenditures

02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:01.720
they're considered to be increases they're expressed as dollar figures so an example of

02:57:01.720 --> 02:57:07.880
a quantitative action could be the LEA will spend three million dollars to maintain increased staffing

02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:13.640
ratios of counselors school nurses and classroom aides at sites serving a majority of students who

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:19.400
are expelled foster youth while on the other hand a qualitative action do not have associated

02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:25.800
expenditures these are commonly thought of as improvements and are often expressed as percentages

02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:31.880
so an example of a qualitative action could be a community-based organization sends volunteers

02:57:31.880 --> 02:57:36.840
two days a week to a school to offer one-to-one reading practice with english learners in the

02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:41.480
third grade this is a qualitative action because the district does not pay for this one-to-one

02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:46.120
reading support and this action provides targeted services to an unduplicated student group

02:57:50.280 --> 02:57:55.080
so to align with statute we also need to make some changes to the titles of the tables in

02:57:55.080 --> 02:58:00.200
the current LCAP template so provided on this slide is a list of the changes to the tables

02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:05.640
in the next section when we turn it back over to josh he'll point out these changes which are in

02:58:05.640 --> 02:58:14.600
attachment three the proposed revisions to the template instructions are listed on the table in

02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:19.400
this slide and i will turn it back over to josh to share screen and walk us through the how for

02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:21.000
the requirement to calculate carryover

02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:33.080
thank you lindsay so as as many of you are aware the increased or improved services for

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:42.680
foster youth english learners and low-income students page provides or asks LEAs to provide

02:58:42.760 --> 02:58:49.480
the percentage to increase or improve services and the increase the amount of the increased

02:58:49.480 --> 02:58:55.080
apportionment based on the enrollment of foster youth english learner and low-income students

02:58:56.040 --> 02:59:03.160
in order to address some of these requirements in terms of this carryover

02:59:03.640 --> 02:59:14.680
um the the majority of those changes or those proposed changes are within the LCAP summary

02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:22.600
tables that were adopted to go along with them this is the data entry table and

02:59:24.440 --> 02:59:28.360
it's very wide and so i'll make it a little bit larger

02:59:28.840 --> 02:59:38.440
um all of the data that's on this page is entered by the LEA and then all of this then populates

02:59:38.440 --> 02:59:50.600
into the additional tabs on on the workbook in order to generate the the required reports

02:59:51.480 --> 02:59:57.160
we're proposing to add three data elements on this data entry table in order to

02:59:57.800 --> 03:00:04.680
meet this requirement the requirements within statute the first is to ask LEAs to provide

03:00:05.240 --> 03:00:10.280
the increased apportionment amount and the percentage to increase or improve services

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:18.600
which are already reported in the template within the expenditure tables we're also asking that they

03:00:18.600 --> 03:00:28.040
then include a qualitative percentage of improved services for any action that is both contributing

03:00:28.040 --> 03:00:36.440
but does not have funding associated with it so in an instance where there is a contributing action

03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:44.120
that does have funding associated with it so for example this action here you would have a

03:00:44.520 --> 03:00:54.280
0% percentage to improve service whereas for this action here because there are no funds

03:00:54.280 --> 03:01:01.400
associated with that the LEA would then provide a qualitative percentage of improved services

03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:09.880
then within the expenditure summary table there are no proposed changes within the contributing

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:19.080
summary table there are six proposed changes two of those changes are to include the estimated

03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:26.600
apportionment amount and the percentage to increase or improve services also in terms of

03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:34.920
addressing statutory requirements the total planned percentage to increase or improve services

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:43.880
so that those looking at the expenditure tables can have a comparison between what the required

03:01:43.880 --> 03:01:52.520
percentage is and what the planned percentage based on the LCAP for the coming year is the

03:01:52.520 --> 03:02:00.840
contributing actions table only provides those actions that are identified as contributing

03:02:00.840 --> 03:02:08.040
towards meeting the requirement to increase or improve services as part of this table we are

03:02:08.040 --> 03:02:20.920
proposing to include the expenditure quantitative percentage to play forward from the data entry

03:02:20.920 --> 03:02:27.800
table into the contributing summary table a qualitative percentage of the qualitative

03:02:27.800 --> 03:02:33.320
percentage of increased services and then to sum those to create a total percentage of increased

03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:39.720
or improved services these percentages here are actually reflective of how much they are

03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:49.800
contributing the percentages that are here are in reference to their proportion of this 6.34%

03:02:50.280 --> 03:03:03.000
and so this is that when it says 20.62% that means that it's making up 20.26% towards the 6.34%

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:12.920
the sum total of the funding and the qualitative percentages then are calculated to

03:03:12.920 --> 03:03:23.800
to provide this 7.83% that is the planned percentage so that here in this example we have a percentage

03:03:23.800 --> 03:03:30.840
a required percentage to increase or improve services of 6.34% a planned percentage to increase

03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:41.160
or improve services by 7.83% then within the annual update portion of the template where the

03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:49.800
estimated actual expenditures from the prior year are provided this is the only piece of data

03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:58.280
that the LEAs actually have to enter and there are no changes being proposed to this page

03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:07.720
and then the contributing updates table which is completely new is being proposed this

03:04:08.200 --> 03:04:16.600
is similar to the annual update table this takes the contributing actions and compares both the

03:04:16.600 --> 03:04:23.720
prior year the planned expenditures from the prior year with the estimated actual expenditures

03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:32.040
as well as the planned qualitative improvements and the estimated actual improvements in order

03:04:32.120 --> 03:04:41.880
to generate the total estimated actual percentage of improved services so that here's the

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:49.960
required percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for the year

03:04:49.960 --> 03:04:56.920
here's what they had planned to do here's what they are reporting they actually did the difference

03:04:56.920 --> 03:05:04.840
between what they had plans to do and what they actually did and then the difference between

03:05:05.640 --> 03:05:15.400
the what they actually did and the required percentage so that if the amount if the percentage

03:05:15.400 --> 03:05:24.600
difference is is less than what the required percentage is then there's no carryover that's

03:05:24.600 --> 03:05:31.320
required if if this amount change if the percentage changes and is in the positive

03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:39.720
then there would be a carryover amount that would be generated here so if if the estimated

03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:51.480
actual amount here was changed to say 75,000 then there's a 4.5 difference between what was

03:05:51.480 --> 03:06:00.120
actually done and what was required and there's and then the funding the required carryover funding

03:06:00.120 --> 03:06:14.680
generates within this field and is then reported here in terms of in addition to what the LEA must

03:06:15.240 --> 03:06:23.480
the proportion percentage that they must meet in the coming year so so the LEA here would report

03:06:23.480 --> 03:06:33.160
what the any any carryover amount that would be required for the 2022-23 LCAP in addition to

03:06:33.960 --> 03:06:41.240
the percentage to increase or improve services based on their fund their their estimated funding

03:06:41.240 --> 03:06:50.040
within 2022-23 so it's really simple and easy for everyone to understand

03:06:50.040 --> 03:06:52.760
so at this point in time I'll turn it back over to Lindsay.

03:06:59.240 --> 03:06:59.960
Thank you, Josh.

03:07:02.760 --> 03:07:06.360
So we'll pause and ask for clarifying questions about this requirement.

03:07:06.360 --> 03:07:18.360
If we have any more clarifying questions I see Member Rucker's hand up. Why don't you kick us off?

03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:25.800
I'm just going to say you had me at the differentiation between qualitative and quantitative

03:07:25.800 --> 03:07:31.960
so I let me begin by saying my qualitative interest in this particular section has jumped

03:07:31.960 --> 03:07:40.280
100 percent. I don't see can you show me in the directions where it explains how to calculate

03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:47.080
this qualitative increase or qualitative percentage because that's the part I couldn't understand and

03:07:47.080 --> 03:07:53.000
I'm not sure I saw it in the direction. I hope that's a clarifying question. Absolutely.

03:07:53.160 --> 03:07:55.480
Can we please share screen with Josh one more time?

03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:05.320
Well actually if I could we don't need to do that at this point in time Member Rucker there

03:08:05.320 --> 03:08:13.480
aren't any instructions within the LCAP template related specifically to how to work how to calculate

03:08:14.040 --> 03:08:25.080
that percentage in part because that's something that we're asking for seeking input on. We've

03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:32.760
already received a fair amount of input on various ways in which that could then be calculated.

03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:45.480
Part of the struggle is to look at the various ways that a qualitative improvement could be

03:08:47.160 --> 03:08:54.280
that requirement could be met. Okay so I'll save my second question for the more detailed discussion.

03:08:54.280 --> 03:09:03.160
All right are there any other clarifying questions? I don't see any hands raised.

03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:11.480
Seeing none I would encourage you to proceed ahead. Okay thank you so the third requirement is to use

03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:19.240
a concentration grant add-on for increased staffing. So the why behind this requirement

03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:23.960
is to ensure LEAs who receive concentration grant funding have additional resources to hire

03:09:23.960 --> 03:09:28.520
staff who will provide direct services to students at schools where students who are low income

03:09:28.520 --> 03:09:32.440
English learners and or foster youth make up 55% or more of the student body.

03:09:34.200 --> 03:09:41.720
This requirement takes place because the 21-22 budget was signed into law on July 9th of 2021

03:09:41.720 --> 03:09:47.080
and it provides applicable LEAs with an additional 15% concentration grant add-on

03:09:47.080 --> 03:09:52.440
and this 15% concentration grant add-on will be ongoing into future budget years.

03:09:53.960 --> 03:09:59.960
This requirement is applicable to all LEAs who receive concentration grant funding

03:10:01.560 --> 03:10:07.480
and the what behind this this requirement is that LEAs who receive these funds are required to

03:10:07.480 --> 03:10:12.440
demonstrate that the additional funding received as a result of the increased concentration grant

03:10:12.440 --> 03:10:18.520
add-on percent will be used to increase the number of credentialed staff classified staff or both of

03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:24.280
those that provide direct services to pupils including this includes custodial staff on school

03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:31.000
campuses who with greater than 55% unduplicated pupil enrollment in the prior year as compared

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:36.840
to the staff to pupil ratios at schools within the local educational agency with any with an

03:10:36.840 --> 03:10:43.000
unduplicated people enrollment in the year of 50 in the prior year 55% or less. So I'll just

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.080
pause there for a second to process that slide.

03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:52.440
Will there be a quiz?

03:10:55.560 --> 03:11:00.600
So in other words the LEAs who receive concentration funds are required to demonstrate

03:11:00.600 --> 03:11:04.840
how they use these funds to increase the number of credentialed staff and or classified staff

03:11:04.840 --> 03:11:08.200
or both that provide direct services at high need schools.

03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:15.560
So for the how of this requirement the proposed changes in the template can be found on page 7

03:11:15.560 --> 03:11:21.560
and the instructions related to this proposed revision can be found on page 29. So Josh go

03:11:21.560 --> 03:11:24.360
ahead can we please kick it back over to Josh one more time?

03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:33.720
Thank you Lindsay. So as Lindsay has already shared the prompt related to this is proposed

03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:38.600
at this point in time to be included in the increased or improved services section

03:11:38.600 --> 03:11:44.920
and to provide a specific prompt here. The instructions that are specifically

03:11:44.920 --> 03:11:50.600
typed in the template are to be included in the increased or improved services section

03:11:51.400 --> 03:11:58.680
the instructions that are specifically tied to this then are in the increased or improved

03:11:58.680 --> 03:12:09.560
services section and specifically on page 29 as it relates to describing the specifics of

03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:15.960
how that funding is being used as well as including the number of staff members that

03:12:15.960 --> 03:12:21.640
are either hired or transferred and the type of direct services that are provided to students.

03:12:23.240 --> 03:12:32.360
Part of the caveat and you know maybe to address some of the questions that I hear member

03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:38.600
running around in member Rutgers head at this point in time this is kind of a moving target

03:12:38.600 --> 03:12:46.520
in fact there's even some proposed changes to this particular piece of ed code included in

03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:55.320
assembly bill senate bill 167 related to this carryover to this additional 15 concentration

03:12:55.320 --> 03:13:03.320
grant. It's something that we've received a lot of input from both in terms of providing more

03:13:03.320 --> 03:13:10.920
clarity of related to the requirement itself but then also in terms of a couple of different

03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:17.560
proposals for how this information could be captured that might be cleaner than simply a

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:24.600
narrative prompt and so those are things that we're looking into but are also interested in

03:13:24.600 --> 03:13:31.720
receiving the feedback that the board might have related to this requirement as well. Lindsay?

03:13:33.320 --> 03:13:39.720
Thank you Josh. Okay so we'll pause for clarifying questions.

03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:44.280
All right do we have any clarifying questions at this juncture?

03:13:48.120 --> 03:13:49.480
I think our brains are full.

03:13:53.400 --> 03:14:00.440
Okay please continue. Okay so the fourth revision that out of five that we bring to everyone

03:14:00.440 --> 03:14:06.360
to discuss about the LCAP is the requirement to add a one-time supplement to the annual update

03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:13.400
to the 21-22 LCAP. So the reason behind this one-time supplement is to provide local governing

03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:18.520
boards or bodies, parents, families, and other educational partners with additional information

03:14:18.520 --> 03:14:24.440
related to the additional funds provided to LEAs in the 21-22 school year. These additional funds

03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:30.920
of course are the additional LCFF funds and the elementary and secondary school emergency relief

03:14:30.920 --> 03:14:37.960
funds also known as ESSER funds and also to show for LEAs to share their story of how they're using

03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:43.240
these funds in a manner that is consistent with other applicable plans and in alignment with their

03:14:43.240 --> 03:14:52.680
21-22 LCAPs. This requirement will take place so there are a couple pieces. The state board must

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:58.920
adopt the template for this one-time supplement on or before November 30th of 2021. Following the

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:04.200
anticipated adoption at the November meeting the CDE will post the one-time supplement template

03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:11.160
and instructions to the CDE website. LEAs must present the one-time supplement to the annual

03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:17.960
update to the 21-22 LCAP at a regularly scheduled meeting of the governing board or body of the LEA

03:15:18.040 --> 03:15:25.000
on or before February 28th 2022 and I just want to note that this supplement once it is presented

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:31.800
and completed in February it will be included in the 22-23 LCAP that will be submitted on or

03:15:31.800 --> 03:15:42.040
before July 1st of 2022. This requirement is applicable to all LEAs and the what behind it

03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:49.640
is LEAs must use the one-time supplement template to present an update at a regularly

03:15:49.640 --> 03:15:54.680
scheduled meeting of the governing board or body on or before February 28th of 2022.

03:15:57.160 --> 03:16:02.600
The proposed draft of this one-time supplement is attached as attachment number four

03:16:03.320 --> 03:16:07.000
and I will turn it over to Josh to talk more about the how.

03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:18.440
Thank you Lindsay. So in terms of the one-time supplemental template to

03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:28.280
the LCAP this is providing a mid-year update to local governing boards and to the LEA's community

03:16:28.280 --> 03:16:39.000
as a whole of how stakeholders were engaged in and consulted as part of the use of various funds

03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:51.160
as well as a way of including the description of how the additional 15 percent concentration grant

03:16:51.160 --> 03:17:00.280
funding is being used to increase staffing at schools that serve greater than 55 percent of

03:17:00.280 --> 03:17:08.760
low-income English learner or foster youth students. In an effort to really streamline

03:17:10.520 --> 03:17:17.480
the approach that we're proposing is to keep it as simple as possible, allow LEAs to be able to

03:17:17.480 --> 03:17:24.920
provide relevant information to their governing boards and their communities without having to

03:17:24.920 --> 03:17:34.840
to use something that's overly complicated or complex. Obviously there's not a whole lot of time

03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:43.160
between when the supplemental template is released and the time in which LEAs have to use it as part

03:17:43.160 --> 03:17:50.840
of the report. In terms of the instructions we begin the instructions related to the

03:17:50.840 --> 03:17:57.720
supplemental template with the requirement to provide that update to the local governing

03:17:57.720 --> 03:18:05.560
board in the community, what that needs to include as well as some specificity related to

03:18:05.560 --> 03:18:16.360
how the supplement then is also included within the LCAP for 2022-23. And then in the instructions

03:18:16.360 --> 03:18:25.240
related to the prompts themselves providing some description of how that should be done,

03:18:25.240 --> 03:18:34.600
what it should cover. We've already received some requests to provide additional information

03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:42.600
to provide some clarity about what funds provided through the budget act of 2021

03:18:42.600 --> 03:18:49.400
are being referred to within the prompts so that there's more clarity for both LEAs and

03:18:49.400 --> 03:18:57.800
for their communities and that's something that we'll be including moving forward as well as

03:18:57.800 --> 03:19:05.640
the way in which some of these prompts provide additional information on what needs to be included.

03:19:06.360 --> 03:19:14.280
And so again this is something that we're open to feedback on and interested in hearing

03:19:16.040 --> 03:19:24.360
thoughts and ways that this could be improved while providing clarity for both the community,

03:19:24.360 --> 03:19:30.200
the governing board, and as much as possible reducing that duplication of effort for LEAs.

03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:34.120
Thank you, Josh.

03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:41.960
And I think also to build on Josh's last point, we acknowledge there's work to be done still on

03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:48.040
this LCAP template and the instructions and the one-time supplement and so we are very excited

03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:54.280
to be able to bring this item to all of you board members today for your input and we'll be using

03:19:54.280 --> 03:19:58.520
that to inform the hard work we're going to be doing over the next two months. So we'll pause

03:19:58.520 --> 03:20:12.280
for clarifying questions. I don't see any hands raised at this juncture so let's carry on.

03:20:12.920 --> 03:20:18.520
Okay we have made it to the fifth revision. So the fifth revision is actually not prescribed

03:20:18.520 --> 03:20:25.080
by statute but is an important one. We would like to ask the board if we may replace the term

03:20:25.080 --> 03:20:30.120
stakeholder throughout the LCAP template and instructions. We have received some feedback in

03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:36.280
speaking with some of our LEA partners that the term stakeholder is offensive to some people and

03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:41.240
is creating a barrier on participation for some of our community members particularly our Native

03:20:41.240 --> 03:20:46.120
American communities and the reason behind this is that this term connotates the practice of

03:20:46.120 --> 03:20:51.560
staking a claim to land during colonial times which was used as a justification for not recognizing

03:20:51.560 --> 03:20:56.200
the rights of Native American communities to their land. This term does not acknowledge the

03:20:56.200 --> 03:21:00.840
fact that Native American tribes are sovereign nations with constitutionally protected rights

03:21:01.400 --> 03:21:05.720
and therefore the use of this term in the LCAP template and instructions

03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:11.000
has created a barrier to engagement for some of our Native American communities and members.

03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:18.600
So again this who is the CDE had received some feedback from various educational partners

03:21:18.600 --> 03:21:24.920
throughout the state. Now for the one of this the CDE has begun to receive some recommendations

03:21:24.920 --> 03:21:30.520
for new terminology to replace this term however we don't have a recommendation for a new term

03:21:30.520 --> 03:21:37.080
today. We would like to continue to collect terminology recommendations throughout the

03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:44.680
revision process before to bring back to all of you at the November meeting and we actually have

03:21:44.680 --> 03:21:50.760
a couple of educational partner meetings coming up. One in particular is we have the American

03:21:50.760 --> 03:21:55.080
Indian Education Oversight Committee coming up which is an advisory group to the superintendent

03:21:55.880 --> 03:22:00.680
that is next week and I want to thank board member McQuillan who attends those meetings

03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:05.400
and provides a board update and is going to work with us to summarize the recommendations

03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:09.160
going to work with us to summarize the discussion that happens today

03:22:09.160 --> 03:22:13.720
to those members and we will be asking for them to give input of recommendations.

03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:19.720
We also will be creating a snap survey which will be live during the month of October of 2021

03:22:19.720 --> 03:22:24.360
and the link to access the survey will be posted to the LCAP web page. We will also send it out

03:22:24.360 --> 03:22:29.160
through our listservs and all members of the public will be invited to submit recommendations

03:22:29.160 --> 03:22:39.000
for a new term. And so the what of this is again to remove the barrier CDE is recommending

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:44.840
that throughout the template we replace the term just as statute requires that school districts

03:22:44.840 --> 03:22:49.480
and county offices consult with parents, students, teachers, principals, administrators,

03:22:49.480 --> 03:22:54.040
other school personnel, local bargaining units, and the local community and charter schools are

03:22:54.040 --> 03:22:58.200
required to consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents,

03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:09.240
and students. So we are definitely seeking all of your all the board members feedback on our

03:23:09.240 --> 03:23:15.320
tentative next steps for choosing and recommending to you a new phrase. We also for all of you

03:23:15.320 --> 03:23:21.000
watching we invite members of the public to submit suggestions for new phrases by emailing us at

03:23:21.240 --> 03:23:28.600
lcff.cda.ca.gov and then again or if you would prefer to wait for the survey link we will have

03:23:28.600 --> 03:23:35.880
that live during the month of October 2021. And with that we will pause for clarifying questions.

03:23:37.720 --> 03:23:41.720
Now is this the point at which we are going to shortly go to public comment?

03:23:43.480 --> 03:23:47.080
We have just two more pieces of content to share

03:23:48.040 --> 03:23:54.200
and then we'll go to public comment. Okay we'll pause for anyone who dares to have a clarifying

03:23:54.200 --> 03:24:04.040
question. All right let's continue please. Okay so we want to take just a moment and acknowledge

03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:09.160
that we know the pandemic has shaken our system upside down and inside out. We have all had to

03:24:09.160 --> 03:24:13.320
innovate and collaborate to develop new ways of thinking and doing that will support our students

03:24:13.320 --> 03:24:18.440
and schools. Our LEAs have been and continue to be champions for continuous improvement

03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:23.800
in putting students first while navigating new state and federal requirements and constantly

03:24:23.800 --> 03:24:28.920
changing public health guidelines. So to all of our LEAs who are watching this presentation

03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:34.600
we applaud you we acknowledge you and we appreciate you and we the CDE want to make sure that we are

03:24:34.600 --> 03:24:41.400
doing everything we can to to collaborate with our LEAs and support their implementation of

03:24:41.400 --> 03:24:46.200
these new requirements that impact the LCAP amidst all the other requirements they are currently

03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:51.160
juggling. So in this next section I want to show how the CDE plans to engage with our partners in

03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:57.320
the field to inform the revisions of the revisions that we are working on and also to provide

03:24:57.320 --> 03:25:05.000
comprehensive support and guidance. So before we got here today we met with the LCAP advisory group

03:25:05.640 --> 03:25:11.400
we held a Tuesday at 2 webinar we presented at the California practitioners advisory group

03:25:11.400 --> 03:25:16.200
we met with educational partners and state board staff throughout that period and we also received

03:25:16.200 --> 03:25:22.920
some written comments and recommendations. After this board meeting we are going to host another

03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:30.680
Tuesday at 2 in October to discuss the revisions that that are proposed today. We are continuing

03:25:30.680 --> 03:25:34.920
to meet with our partner organizations and advisory groups we are going to bring the LCAP

03:25:34.920 --> 03:25:41.160
advisory group together again we are going to outline and launch our snap survey to collect

03:25:41.160 --> 03:25:47.960
recommendations for a new term to replace stakeholder and as always everyone is always welcome to send

03:25:47.960 --> 03:25:56.840
input through email to our LCFF inbox. At the anticipated adoption of the LCAP template

03:25:56.840 --> 03:26:01.400
instructions and the one-time supplement for the annual update at the November board meeting

03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:06.200
following that we will host another we will host a Tuesday at 2 webinar series.

03:26:07.240 --> 03:26:13.320
LASSO is available for office hours and technical assistance upon request and also we are very proud

03:26:13.320 --> 03:26:18.440
to say that we are working closely with the region 15 comprehensive center at West Ed. We are going

03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:24.840
to be rolling out some examples of well-written LCAP sections inclusive of new requirements as

03:26:24.840 --> 03:26:30.760
two-page handouts. We are also going to be releasing some guidance that is how to use

03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:36.840
your local data more than your state data as a metric in the LCAP and also to support

03:26:36.840 --> 03:26:41.720
in timely posting of additional guidance documents to accompany our Tuesday at 2 webinar series.

03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:47.320
We acknowledge those are very content heavy and that the slides are very technical and so we are

03:26:47.320 --> 03:26:51.240
going to have some translation documents to summarize them that are going to accompany these

03:26:52.200 --> 03:27:01.800
webinars. And then finally just to show that again we all know LEAs have a lot going on right now.

03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:05.560
We want to acknowledge all the plans that our LEAs have created and are implementing

03:27:06.200 --> 03:27:09.560
in a crosswalk format so that you can see the intersection of these plans.

03:27:10.360 --> 03:27:16.120
So each of the plans listed down the left-hand column are all playing critical roles in safe

03:27:16.120 --> 03:27:21.880
return to in-person instruction and ongoing in-person instruction amidst our ongoing pandemic.

03:27:22.520 --> 03:27:26.680
This crosswalk is organized that each row identifies the plan and then the columns the

03:27:26.680 --> 03:27:32.520
adoption date the implementation time time frame and any required revision dates of that plan.

03:27:33.960 --> 03:27:38.840
The one-time supplement to the annual update will give LEAs an opportunity to bring all of these

03:27:38.840 --> 03:27:44.200
plans together to share their story of how they're spending their LCFF and federal emergency relief

03:27:44.200 --> 03:27:47.800
funds in a manner that is consistent with their 21-22 LCAP.

03:27:50.680 --> 03:27:55.320
And we are working on making this 508 accessible and posting it on our webpage

03:27:56.520 --> 03:28:02.280
on the LCAP webpage. So I'm gonna just jump here and then we'll go to public comment.

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:10.520
So for more information I have some listed commonly used webinars or sites. I just want to

03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:17.400
highlight the fourth bullet. Our government affairs team created a COVID emergency relief

03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:22.920
funding summary chart and it is fantastic. It lays out similar to the crosswalk of plans. It

03:28:22.920 --> 03:28:28.920
is a crosswalk of funding so I highly recommend it. You can find it via search in our CD webpage

03:28:28.920 --> 03:28:37.880
by typing COVID emergency relief funding summary chart. So now that is the end of our presentation

03:28:37.880 --> 03:28:42.600
of this item and I'll pull this up for public comment or turn it back over to you President

03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:49.640
Darling-Hammond. Thank you very much for that very thorough presentation and thank you for all the

03:28:49.640 --> 03:28:55.160
incredible work you've done on this revision of the template as you said the revision of the

03:28:55.160 --> 03:29:02.440
revision and for all the work you are yet to do after we give you our advice and you hear from

03:29:02.440 --> 03:29:10.040
many others in our education partnerships. So we are while we're waiting for members of the

03:29:10.040 --> 03:29:15.960
public to call in who can provide comment on this item I'm going to remind you this is for item three.

03:29:17.320 --> 03:29:22.040
You could do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide

03:29:22.040 --> 03:29:27.240
that is shown now and while we're waiting for members of the public to call in I want to ask

03:29:27.240 --> 03:29:32.120
Vice President Strauss and member Burr as our accountability liaisons if they have initial

03:29:32.120 --> 03:29:39.160
comments. So Vice President Strauss. So Lindsay and Josh thank you so much I just think Josh

03:29:40.040 --> 03:29:45.640
did an amazing job at CPAC walking through this detail by detail just like he did now

03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:54.040
and it was a really thoughtful very deep conversation and the comments generally

03:29:54.600 --> 03:30:00.440
obviously this is complicated this is generated by the need to address legislative requirements

03:30:01.320 --> 03:30:07.320
the general comments are that a lot of the prompts and guidance are improving in the LCAP template

03:30:07.320 --> 03:30:16.120
but I will say many many people see the LCAP template as guiding all the work and decisions

03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:22.920
and so so many people still want to put more and more in the LCAP template so let me just say

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:30.520
I think the work has really improved it but I'm making a request that Lindsay and Josh and the

03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:38.120
team come back to us in November with with areas they believe are redundant that they can reduce

03:30:38.120 --> 03:30:45.480
the LCAP template so again I think the improvements are clear the wordings the stakeholder groups have

03:30:45.480 --> 03:30:51.480
helped us in a lot of the prompts but I think it has gotten so long the intent is to be transparent

03:30:51.560 --> 03:30:56.680
to help people understand what we're doing to meet the needs of students with the funding and

03:30:56.680 --> 03:31:02.360
actions that districts take but I feel like we've gotten the point now where it's longer and longer

03:31:02.360 --> 03:31:09.240
and it is just I'm not sure it's meeting all the needs by the length of it and the complexity

03:31:09.240 --> 03:31:15.480
so I would like you through your next meetings to come back to us with some recommendations of areas

03:31:15.480 --> 03:31:21.640
you believe could be shortened and wouldn't compromise the intent and would help the public

03:31:21.640 --> 03:31:27.640
and the staff really use this as a planning tool as it is intended now again I want to thank you

03:31:27.640 --> 03:31:33.400
so much for the thorough Lindsay I really liked how you laid out who what why I think that was

03:31:33.400 --> 03:31:40.360
really helpful in the process I'll turn it over to member Burke. Thank you Vice President Strauss.

03:31:40.360 --> 03:31:47.080
I too want to express my appreciation I said to Lindsay and Josh when we did our review of the item

03:31:47.080 --> 03:31:52.920
when I read the draft it made my head explode and I was really worried about how we were going to

03:31:52.920 --> 03:32:00.120
have this conversation but you did a magnificent job of taking the comments we had at the late

03:32:00.120 --> 03:32:07.640
liaison call and putting in the who what why where to clarify why these changes are needed

03:32:08.280 --> 03:32:12.200
I just also want to echo everything that Vice President Strauss said

03:32:13.160 --> 03:32:18.200
and and sort of take us back to the very beginning as the historian of the group here

03:32:18.200 --> 03:32:25.320
when I think about what the LCAP was intended to do to be a strategic document to guide

03:32:25.320 --> 03:32:32.680
instructional planning and provide services to our most needy students I'm afraid that it has turned

03:32:32.680 --> 03:32:41.000
into a complex accounting document that only CPAs can understand and only CPAs can fill out

03:32:41.880 --> 03:32:48.600
so I really want to take Vice President Strauss's comments to heart about how can we make how can we

03:32:48.600 --> 03:32:55.320
return to what the original intent was while still keeping the needed accountability thank you.

03:32:55.320 --> 03:33:03.320
Thank you so much I think with that we will turn to public comment and I understand we have a

03:33:03.320 --> 03:33:14.520
number of callers in the queue. Is our public comment moderator available? Yes there is.

03:33:15.480 --> 03:33:20.280
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

03:33:20.280 --> 03:33:29.720
your time begins now. Good afternoon board members this is Louise Guillen with public advocates I'm

03:33:29.720 --> 03:33:34.920
wanting to underscore the letter that we submitted with the LCFF equity coalition.

03:33:36.120 --> 03:33:42.840
The changes and transparency required by the budget trailer bill addresses a real life scenario

03:33:42.840 --> 03:33:49.560
it's not a hypothetical problem and it's intended to ensure that LEA fully plan and actually deliver

03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:55.240
on their equity obligations under LCFF and when they don't the shortfall and increased or improved

03:33:55.240 --> 03:34:01.480
services is calculated and carried over to the next year as unused supplemental and concentration

03:34:01.480 --> 03:34:07.000
grant funds. We don't see how qualitative improvement can make up a large proportion of

03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:12.760
the proportionality obligation but the explicit directions and statute concerning carryover are

03:34:12.760 --> 03:34:17.800
important to get right so that when it's present high need students will get the full benefit of

03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:24.840
LCFF. What I heard Josh present is a proposal to trap qualitative improvements action by action

03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:32.840
and we thank the department staff for making that change. Your time is up and advocate

03:34:32.840 --> 03:34:35.800
that carryover funds to be limited to quantitative.

03:34:40.920 --> 03:34:45.320
Hello caller please state your name and your name and affiliation for the record

03:34:46.120 --> 03:34:48.760
you have one minute your time begins now.

03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:59.080
Jessica Focco on behalf of Children Now I'd like to thank Member Rucker for her clarifying question

03:34:59.080 --> 03:35:03.800
regarding how to calculate the qualitative percentage of improved services this is indeed

03:35:03.800 --> 03:35:07.960
the million dollar question that is critically answered before November when the board is set

03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:14.760
to take action on the LCFF template. In addition education code 42238.07 is clear

03:35:14.760 --> 03:35:21.720
carryover funds must be extended and therefore their use is limited to those quantitative actions

03:35:21.720 --> 03:35:28.280
which were previously described. I would like to thank Josh and the team in Lasso for

03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:35.560
their welcoming of our comments over the past couple of months and we look forward to continuing

03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:41.160
working together in order to ensure that this document serves the needs of families community

03:35:41.160 --> 03:35:44.840
members and the schools they are designed to support thank you.

03:35:50.440 --> 03:35:53.800
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:56.120
you have one minute your time begins now.

03:35:59.320 --> 03:36:03.720
Good afternoon I'm Jennifer Hicks Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services at

03:36:03.720 --> 03:36:08.680
the Foster County Office of Education and the 2021 Fifth Chair. I'm sharing these

03:36:08.680 --> 03:36:15.240
comments on behalf of SISC in two seconds. We support the CBE's recommended timeline for

03:36:15.240 --> 03:36:21.240
adoption and appreciate bringing the draft revisions in September within an intent to

03:36:21.240 --> 03:36:26.840
adopt in November. This timeline allows both county offices and LEAs the necessary time to

03:36:26.840 --> 03:36:32.840
understand the new requirements prepare for the changes and provide thoughtful and comprehensive

03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:38.360
training and calibration. Additionally we advocate for the revised template and supplement to

03:36:38.360 --> 03:36:43.880
include only the components required by statute. It's essential that the revisions not require

03:36:43.880 --> 03:36:49.800
additional items beyond what's required by statute and that the LCAP continue to be used as a tool for

03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:55.640
strategic planning in order to best serve students. I appreciate board member comments about returning

03:36:55.640 --> 03:37:01.640
the LCAP to its original intent to something that is not overly complex or burdensome. I also want

03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:06.200
to thank the CBE staff for the ongoing partnership and engagement with county offices.

03:37:13.400 --> 03:37:18.280
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute your time

03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:27.240
begins now. My name is Lexi Lopez from Ed Voice. The current template is not clear that LEAs must

03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:33.720
report on specific actions funded with carryover resources for the ensuing year. Ed Voice urges

03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:40.280
the board to provide explicit direction to LEAs that aligns with AB 130 to ensure unused LCFS

03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:47.240
carryover funds are additive and expended to benefit targeted students. Ed Voice also recommends

03:37:47.240 --> 03:37:53.320
the board ensure district report by school the staff position supported by the 1.1 billion

03:37:53.400 --> 03:37:58.280
and target funding to ensure staffing levels at schools with a higher concentration of

03:37:58.280 --> 03:38:03.320
unduplicated students have improved. Please refer to attachments one and two from the

03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:09.320
alliance for students letter for an example. Lastly we recommend guidance on specific actions

03:38:09.320 --> 03:38:14.680
resulting in qualitative improvements and detailed instructions on how to calculate the benefit to

03:38:14.680 --> 03:38:25.160
targeted students. Thank you. Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the

My name is Lorraine Richards I'm a classroom teacher representing California teachers

03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:52.200
association. CTA is part of a coalition of labor and education management organizations

03:39:52.200 --> 03:39:57.800
that supports the changes made in AB 130 that would ensure LEAs are following through on the

03:39:57.800 --> 03:40:03.800
commitment made to our most vulnerable students. We urge the board to consider that the LCAP should

03:40:03.800 --> 03:40:09.560
be strategic planning document and our state's accountability system is intended to focus on

03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:15.880
outcomes and continuous improvement. Efforts to further evolve the LCAP into compliance

03:40:15.880 --> 03:40:20.200
documents should be disregarded. We appreciate that the template provides

03:40:20.200 --> 03:40:28.120
options for LEAs to increase or improve services for unduplicated students either qualitatively

03:40:28.120 --> 03:40:35.000
or quantitatively as outlined in statute. We also urge the board to simplify the template as much as

03:40:35.000 --> 03:40:40.040
possible and not include additional requirements beyond current law. With this school year

03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:45.480
underway the pandemic continues to place substantial stress on family students teachers and administrators.

03:40:45.480 --> 03:40:56.520
Thank you. Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:07.720
Hi I'm Leticia Garcia on behalf of the Riverside County superintendent of schools and the 23 school

03:41:07.720 --> 03:41:13.160
districts in Riverside County. We're here today as part of a coalition of LEAs and education

03:41:13.160 --> 03:41:18.280
organizations. We thank DeafWork on the proposed template and emphasize the following points.

03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:25.080
Our districts embrace accountability for student outcomes. The templates meet AB 130 requirements

03:41:25.080 --> 03:41:30.680
and maintain the original LCFF intent that the LCAP is a tool for strategic planning to search

03:41:30.680 --> 03:41:35.800
students needs and not an accounting document. The templates also hold districts accountable for

03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:42.520
their LCFF obligations and allow for qualitative actions to meet these obligations. We do believe

03:41:42.520 --> 03:41:47.400
LEAs and communities could benefit from additional guidance on how to calculate the percentage of

03:41:47.400 --> 03:41:53.480
qualitative actions that contribute to meeting these obligations. Lastly the one-time supplement

03:41:53.480 --> 03:41:59.080
could be enhanced by including a table for LEAs to demonstrate how they have met the concentration

03:41:59.080 --> 03:42:03.400
grant funding requirement. Thank you and we look forward to working with you.

03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:14.760
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:24.840
Good afternoon my name is Melissa Elder. I'm calling from the Lincoln Indian Education Center

03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:29.560
located in San Diego County which is a county with the most reservations in the country.

03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:34.440
I'm calling in to support the change of requiring specific goals and measures for

03:42:34.440 --> 03:42:39.640
specific subgroups as the member record alluded and additionally I would like to express that

03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:45.560
Native American Indian students need to also be included as a subject subgroup because otherwise

03:42:45.560 --> 03:42:51.160
they will be intentionally left out. These subgroup communities need to be directly consulted

03:42:51.160 --> 03:42:56.120
and included in the conversations regarding the activities planned to address the goals to make

03:42:56.120 --> 03:43:00.200
sure that these will be effective and meet the needs of various communities that are intended on

03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:07.960
helping. While changing words to be more inclusive is important even more so is making concrete steps

03:43:07.960 --> 03:43:12.520
to actively reduce trauma in our communities by being specific to include our Native communities

03:43:12.520 --> 03:43:15.720
in subgroups and specific goals for them as a requirement. Thank you.

03:43:22.440 --> 03:43:26.200

Hello Madam President this is Brian Rebus calling on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:44:04.920 --> 03:44:09.240
I wanted to comment on the changes relative to qualitative improvements.

03:44:10.120 --> 03:44:15.080
We think that many communities are going to be surprised and unhappy to learn that the law

03:44:15.080 --> 03:44:22.040
permits LEAs to draw down money for unduplicated students but the law permits

03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:35.560
LEAs to forgo spending those monies and we think that you could mitigate possibly

03:44:36.520 --> 03:44:43.320
some of the negative reactions by making sure that the LCAP uses language that is clear,

03:44:43.320 --> 03:44:50.120
that is easy to understand, what a qualitative improvement is, how it will help students,

03:44:50.120 --> 03:44:56.920
and why it's a better choice of action than actually spending the money. So I would ask

03:44:56.920 --> 03:45:02.920
try to think about it from the point of view of a low-income parent whose child is counted among

03:45:02.920 --> 03:45:07.880
students to draw down funds and then think about how you would feel when you find out the district

03:45:07.880 --> 03:45:11.960
isn't actually using the money. So the recommendations data.

03:45:11.960 --> 03:45:23.800
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute your time begins now.

03:45:41.960 --> 03:45:59.800
We're not hearing anything. There appears to be a problem with the line. I'll see if I can get it to work.

03:46:12.920 --> 03:46:20.760
Hello. Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute your time begins now.

03:46:24.040 --> 03:46:29.000
My name is Kim Kenny and I'm a board member in Pasadena and the board member rep on the CPAC.

03:46:29.720 --> 03:46:34.040
In the interest of helping LCAPs be clear and understandable to their readers I have the following

03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:40.200
concerns which are detailed in more clear language in the late correspondence folder.

03:46:40.840 --> 03:46:45.400
Number one, six new fields for showing carryover are called out specifically in Ed code section

03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:51.560
52064B8A but are not included in this template thereby making it non-compliant.

03:46:52.200 --> 03:46:58.120
Number two, for the new calculations for qualitative improvements and transforming dollars to percentages

03:46:58.120 --> 03:47:02.120
it is important that there is public guidance on how these calculations should be done

03:47:02.120 --> 03:47:06.440
either in the LCAP template itself or the instruction. Number three, it would be

03:47:06.440 --> 03:47:13.080
beneficial to include all elements of calculations in the tables for instance A minus B equals C.

03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:18.280
One example is that it's not clear how the proportionality obligation is calculated since

03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:24.760
one component the LCFS base amount is not shown. Transparency is key to building the trust of the

03:47:24.760 --> 03:47:30.200
community in our education system and in truly implementing local control. I appreciate the

03:47:30.200 --> 03:47:33.640
modifications and clarifications that have been made in response to the feedback.

03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:51.000
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time begins now.

03:47:55.160 --> 03:47:59.800
Good afternoon, me Angela Reed on behalf of the Humboldt County Office of Education and the Small

03:47:59.800 --> 03:48:04.280
School Districts Association. I greatly appreciate the comments of members Burns,

03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:09.640
while we embrace accountability we believe the LCAP must stay a planning document if anything's

03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:14.120
become clear over the last two years is that we don't know what the future might bring so we need

03:48:14.120 --> 03:48:21.240
to be able to adjust. In addition we would greatly appreciate the addition of a table allowing us to

03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:27.400
describe the actions taken because while folks will be working to meet the requirements that

03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:32.360
we need to meet they may not be able to find the staff in an early time and we want to be able to

03:48:32.360 --> 03:48:38.040
show the demonstrated that they are attempting to do so. Thank you for your consideration and

03:48:38.040 --> 03:48:49.480
look forward to working with you. Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the

03:48:49.480 --> 03:48:59.080
record you have one minute your time begins now. My name is Anastasia with the Taren Organization

03:48:59.080 --> 03:49:03.800
Network thank you to CDE staff and board members for your commitment to continuing to improve the

03:49:03.800 --> 03:49:09.320
LCAP template. Overall the template doesn't address the parents have been requesting for a while

03:49:09.320 --> 03:49:13.960
reporting the budget and expenditures of the school site level because financial information

03:49:13.960 --> 03:49:18.520
is primarily available at the district level it isn't clear if district funding trickles down to

03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:23.960
schools with more high need students. Also we advocate for more meaningful guidance for everyone

03:49:23.960 --> 03:49:28.520
to understand quantitative and qualitative actions or services for high need students.

03:49:28.600 --> 03:49:34.120
Providing more rules in LCAP templates without building capacity to qualify and quantify services

03:49:34.120 --> 03:49:39.080
or implement them is not likely to yield better results so we agree with the idea of providing

03:49:39.080 --> 03:49:44.440
more examples as well as different ways to calculate qualitative actions or concerned

03:49:44.440 --> 03:49:49.800
qualitative funds may become a loophole or casual category for districts is not fully explained.

03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:53.240
Thank you.

03:49:58.600 --> 03:50:04.120
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time begins

03:50:04.120 --> 03:50:13.080
now. Good afternoon this is Sarah Lewis with Teach Class. We want to associate our comments with those

03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:17.640
of the LCFS Equity Coalition and the Alliance for Students. We appreciate all of the work

03:50:17.640 --> 03:50:22.840
that the department staff has done over the last several weeks and beyond that in incorporating

03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:27.320
many of our a mess of our feedback and the feedback from the CPAC. Unfortunately we don't

03:50:27.320 --> 03:50:33.560
believe that the new template goes quite far enough to really allow local families students

03:50:33.560 --> 03:50:38.760
and educators to engage in a meaningful way in the planning and accountability processes locally.

03:50:38.760 --> 03:50:42.680
To that end we think that there needs to be additional instructions and reporting on the

03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:50.120
qualitative improvements as well as you're concerned about how the guidelines around

03:50:50.120 --> 03:50:57.560
the carryover funds do not follow the law on ABH 130 and really it's required that those

03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:01.640
carryover funds be expended in the following year to benefit targeted students. Thank you.

03:51:03.000 --> 03:51:03.720
Thank you caller.

03:51:03.720 --> 03:51:14.040
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time begins now.

03:51:17.640 --> 03:51:23.720
Good afternoon Carlos Machado with California School Board Association. I echo the comments made

03:51:23.720 --> 03:51:29.880
by our fellow members in the education management and agriculture. Specifically we request the board

03:51:29.880 --> 03:51:35.560
ensure that the revisions in the template and update to implement only those requirements

03:51:35.560 --> 03:51:40.680
specified in statute to ensure the most effective transparency for each community. We appreciate

03:51:40.680 --> 03:51:44.920
your recognition of the extensive work that districts and community leaders are engaged

03:51:44.920 --> 03:51:50.200
in with the returns and personal learning. The recommendations made by our coalition will ensure

03:51:50.200 --> 03:51:56.600
that they're able to focus on this important work. We appreciate your work your effort on this and

03:51:56.600 --> 03:52:00.520
thank you for your time. Thank you.

03:52:07.400 --> 03:52:10.920
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

03:52:10.920 --> 03:52:13.560

03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:23.320
Hello this is Shelly Stevel Coleman from Californians Together. We appreciate the quantity

03:52:23.320 --> 03:52:28.440
of work that the department has put together and all of the attachments that we were reviewing.

03:52:28.440 --> 03:52:33.560
In the template we believe clarifying language is needed as to how districts report the use of

03:52:33.560 --> 03:52:39.640
carryover funds. On one hand the Edco section we reference indicates that carryover funds need to

03:52:39.640 --> 03:52:46.920
be extended to improve or increase services. The word extended leads us to conclude money spent.

03:52:46.920 --> 03:52:51.400
On the other hand there's a reference to a process that districts can use to meet the

03:52:51.400 --> 03:52:57.160
proportional obligation through qualitative improvement that do not require funding. We are

03:52:57.160 --> 03:53:02.600
concerned that districts could deliver could deliver all of their improved services meeting

03:53:02.600 --> 03:53:08.840
the proportionality obligation and not extend any of their carryover money. We recommend that all

03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:15.800
carryover money be spent quantitatively. We'd also like to reinforce what board member record rates

03:53:15.800 --> 03:53:21.720
and reference to the new specific goals that emanate from legislation.

03:53:36.360 --> 03:53:39.720
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

03:53:39.720 --> 03:53:42.360

03:53:42.520 --> 03:53:49.800
Good afternoon Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members. AXA would encourage the state to develop

03:53:49.800 --> 03:53:54.520
a tool for county superintendents to use when reviewing district LCAPs to ensure calibration

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:59.480
and consistency around the state for LCAP review. In addition AXA is part of the coalition

03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:03.480
education management and labor group. Continuing to underscore the importance of transparency

03:54:03.480 --> 03:54:08.440
at a local and state level we believe the template with some minor adjustments will meet this goal.

03:54:08.680 --> 03:54:13.000
With some minor adjustments will meet this goal. The coalition's recommendations include

03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:17.880
appreciation for the draft focus on implementing statute and consistently allowing alliators

03:54:17.880 --> 03:54:22.760
the ability to demonstrate how they are meeting the proportionality obligation quantitatively

03:54:22.760 --> 03:54:28.520
and qualitatively. Requested guidance on calculating the percentage for qualitative action

03:54:28.520 --> 03:54:32.760
conclusion of a table reference in our letter to provide additional information regarding

03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:37.960
how additional concentration grant dollars are invested and provide clarity and increase

03:54:37.960 --> 03:54:42.440
usability. Thank you. Thank you caller.

03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:49.800
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

03:54:55.480 --> 03:54:59.960
Tim Taylor executive director of California small school district association representing

03:54:59.960 --> 03:55:04.280
60 percent of the school districts in California and we agree with the labor

03:55:04.280 --> 03:55:10.440
administration associations. We have no interest in shirking our responsibility to be transparent

03:55:10.440 --> 03:55:15.240
and accountable to our students and families. In small districts our students and parents are

03:55:15.240 --> 03:55:20.040
family and we don't feel we'll be more accountable to them on paper than we are in person with

03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:25.480
providing a more useful document. Many of our families are overwhelmed by the LCAP and we want

03:55:25.480 --> 03:55:30.760
it to be open and accessible as possible. The majority of small districts use infographics

03:55:30.760 --> 03:55:35.080
to help summarize their funding to improve student achievement. They do not use a 50 plus

03:55:35.080 --> 03:55:39.640
page document. We request the department continue to work with small district leaders to continue

03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:43.960
to create a more useful and family-friendly document that parents and the community will

03:55:43.960 --> 03:55:49.080
read. We also appreciate CD and the board for working together on this document. Thank you.

03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:51.400
Thank you caller.

03:55:56.760 --> 03:56:00.280

03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:12.280
Good afternoon Madam Chair, John Affeld from public advocates. To address member Rucker's

03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:18.840
question there is a standard and direction in AB 130 for how to establish the percentage

03:56:19.080 --> 03:56:27.960
for qualitative improvement. 52070D1E makes clear that LEA LCAPs need to demonstrate and

03:56:27.960 --> 03:56:35.480
counties need to verify that the degree of quality improvement claim is commensurate

03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:42.360
with the amount of SEC funds apportioned that that claim percentage represents. So in other words

03:56:42.360 --> 03:56:47.640
if you have a hundred million dollar MPP and you're claiming a one percent qualitative

03:56:47.640 --> 03:56:53.560
percentage you need to show how that action is contributing roughly a million dollars worth of

03:56:53.560 --> 03:57:00.600
quality to high school students over and above what all students are receiving. Secondly the

03:57:00.600 --> 03:57:05.880
single catch-all prompt asking LEAs what you did with your carryover doesn't cut it. Those

03:57:05.880 --> 03:57:09.000
actions need to be separately identified and justified. Thank you.

03:57:18.120 --> 03:57:25.240
Hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute your time begins now.

03:57:28.040 --> 03:57:33.080
Thank you. Good afternoon President Darling-Hammond and members of the board. Patty Herrera on behalf

03:57:33.080 --> 03:57:37.960
of the Oakland and Corona Norco Unified School District who join a coalition of education

03:57:37.960 --> 03:57:42.920
organizations to support and offer improvements to the proposed LCAP template and one-time

03:57:42.920 --> 03:57:47.560
supplemental template. We want to underscore our commitment to transparency and accountability

03:57:47.560 --> 03:57:52.920
to the state and our community partners to ensure optimal use of resources for the benefit of our

03:57:52.920 --> 03:57:58.440
students. In this spirit we believe that the proposed table describing how LEAs are using

03:57:58.440 --> 03:58:03.960
their increased concentration grant funds to staff their high poverty schools achieves transparency

03:58:03.960 --> 03:58:09.160
without making the LCAP an unreality strategic planning and engagement tool. We'd also like to

03:58:09.160 --> 03:58:14.280
restate the importance of retaining the value of qualitative service improvements some of which

03:58:14.280 --> 03:58:20.840
may not be monetized for students when calculating any portion of unimplemented or partially

03:58:20.840 --> 03:58:26.040
implemented actions for unduplicated students. The state has long recognized that the quality

03:58:26.040 --> 03:58:30.920
of the services we provide students is just as important as the quantity of the services we

03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:37.720
provide. Thank you. That concludes our public comment.

03:58:37.720 --> 03:58:49.320
All right thank you very much. I'm aware that we were anticipating a break for lunch after this

03:58:49.320 --> 03:58:56.280
item but it is 12 51 and some of you may really need to eat in order to be able to have a good

03:58:56.280 --> 03:59:03.560
discussion. So I suggest we take a 10 minute break so you can grab food we can eat during our

03:59:03.560 --> 03:59:13.400
discussion as we have many times in this board and reconvene at about one o'clock to pick up

03:59:13.400 --> 03:59:19.000
our portion of the discussion because I know there's a lot that people may want to contribute.

03:59:19.720 --> 03:59:28.760
So take a moment grab whatever you would be sustaining yourself with and we will see you

03:59:28.760 --> 03:59:37.240
back at one turn off your video camera and mute your mic but do not leave. Thank you.

03:59:39.960 --> 03:59:49.080
Okay so we are now ready to really dig in and discuss and provide feedback to our team on the

03:59:49.080 --> 03:59:56.600
LCAP template. I apologize would you like me to re-establish the quorum? Yes I would like you to

03:59:56.600 --> 04:00:06.920
do that. Happy to do so. Please do. President. Vice President Strauss. Here. Member Rucker.

04:00:07.800 --> 04:00:15.720
Present. Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Petillo-Brownson. Here. Member McQuillan.

04:00:16.840 --> 04:00:25.960
Here. Member Glover Woods. Here. Member Escobedo. Present. President Darlene Hammond.

04:00:26.920 --> 04:00:36.200
Here. Member Burr. Here. Member Bonacca. Here. Have a quorum. All right now we are ready to

04:00:36.200 --> 04:00:42.680
dig in and discuss and I see that member Rucker is ready to go so kick us off please Pat.

04:00:44.120 --> 04:00:51.240
Oh joy okay well first of all I do want to thank the staff for their effort in presenting

04:00:51.240 --> 04:00:59.080
this document and I appreciate that this is for conversational purposes so for that reason my

04:00:59.080 --> 04:01:07.240
comment my compliment is going to be well that was a good start so here's not what my I have a couple

04:01:07.240 --> 04:01:15.960
of questions and some concerns that I want to share here that I hope can inform how the staff

04:01:16.200 --> 04:01:22.040
the staff does in their continuing conversations not only with their technical design team

04:01:22.040 --> 04:01:29.800
but with our very savvy staff of legal advisors as well as the stakeholders I think first and

04:01:29.800 --> 04:01:37.880
foremost the point we need to begin with the pivotal question what do you want and you know

04:01:37.880 --> 04:01:43.080
there's a difference between what is needed and what do you want the statute clearly defines

04:01:43.080 --> 04:01:51.240
what needs to be included in the LCAP template but as was pointed out by board member Burr

04:01:51.800 --> 04:02:02.120
this document is changing in both scope and aspect to be something that I'm not sure is clearly

04:02:02.120 --> 04:02:10.040
what is wanted and so that's the reason why I asked the question you know where are the directions

04:02:10.040 --> 04:02:18.840
that define how you compute this qualitative input the staff must have had some idea about

04:02:18.840 --> 04:02:26.040
what that meant by putting the charts together that they offered as an example for illustrative

04:02:26.040 --> 04:02:33.960
purposes in today's presentation so somehow or other there was some magic some computation some

04:02:33.960 --> 04:02:42.040
thought put into the numbers that were in that column about qualitative improvement and so let

04:02:42.040 --> 04:02:49.400
me begin by asking you to define what do you want actually represented when you talk about quality

04:02:49.400 --> 04:02:56.920
just like any number quality has a number of facets to it is uh is the quality you're asking

04:02:56.920 --> 04:03:04.280
districts to evaluate about their program inputs a peculiar or essential character so if it's going

04:03:04.280 --> 04:03:10.200
to be that then you have to target students because there is some peculiarity about decisions

04:03:10.200 --> 04:03:16.680
districts will make about their programs and where they direct those funds based on the students they

04:03:16.680 --> 04:03:23.560
want to target is there some inherent feature about the district that these funds or these

04:03:23.560 --> 04:03:30.200
expenditures are supposed to have an impact on based on what cindy kazan has said earlier

04:03:30.200 --> 04:03:37.480
in going forward to not only implement the recommendations for identifying schools and

04:03:37.480 --> 04:03:43.880
districts who would continue to be referred for the system of support but also in ways that will

04:03:43.880 --> 04:03:50.920
inform how we compute the growth metric there's going to be some historical data included so are

04:03:50.920 --> 04:03:58.280
we actually surprised that we have historical data that goes even beyond 2017 that says we have a

04:03:58.280 --> 04:04:04.520
lot of underperforming student groups that can be easily identified by ethnicity and in that case

04:04:04.520 --> 04:04:10.200
i'm particularly talking about african-american students so is there some inherent feature about

04:04:10.200 --> 04:04:15.400
school districts who cannot for some reason figure out that they're under their african-american

04:04:15.400 --> 04:04:22.680
students are specifically underperforming other student subgroups across all grade levels

04:04:22.680 --> 04:04:27.720
in mathematics and they cannot for some reason feel compelled to call that out

04:04:27.720 --> 04:04:34.680
in their qualitative evaluation of their program what i did see in the examples given really did

04:04:34.680 --> 04:04:41.320
address the next two facets about quality one was capacity and role in the example that was

04:04:41.400 --> 04:04:48.920
given by the staff it was a qualitative investment in staffing and in particular ways that staff

04:04:48.920 --> 04:04:56.200
would provide specific direct services so that's one element but that's the only element that

04:04:56.200 --> 04:05:02.040
was shown and the directions or at least the information that i saw in the template don't

04:05:02.040 --> 04:05:08.760
quite align with that example is there something about the degree of excellence the investment in

04:05:08.760 --> 04:05:15.000
professional learning or professional development that's an example of a qualitative investment

04:05:15.000 --> 04:05:21.960
that is that but that's not a direct service yet those were things that were that also were talked

04:05:21.960 --> 04:05:30.520
about or called out there is there needs to be some attention paid to what are the distinguishing

04:05:30.520 --> 04:05:36.600
attributes about this program that are going to be different from previous efforts because that

04:05:36.600 --> 04:05:41.000
is a recognition that what we've done before hasn't worked and here's what we're going to

04:05:41.000 --> 04:05:46.360
take a look at and that takes us to the why so that's both the what and the why and linking

04:05:46.360 --> 04:05:53.400
those things together but quality also comes down to leadership and the work that has to be done

04:05:53.400 --> 04:06:00.440
to in the stakeholder engagement process and i'm very mindful of that fifth amendment

04:06:00.440 --> 04:06:06.280
that's going to be made to address stakeholders because this is something that continues to be

04:06:06.280 --> 04:06:12.120
called out with every successive meeting we have it's about stakeholder engagement it was painfully

04:06:12.120 --> 04:06:17.400
pointed out by the complaints of district leadership at the july meeting when they were

04:06:17.400 --> 04:06:23.720
complaining about the requirement to sit in their office by themselves and to write a plan concerning

04:06:23.720 --> 04:06:31.000
school reopening and the use of the federal esser funds we're still stuck in this loop where

04:06:31.000 --> 04:06:37.000
stakeholder engagement is an afterthought or something that happens after the plan is drafted

04:06:37.000 --> 04:06:42.600
and then presented in some ways to stakeholders or at least that's the feedback i heard heard very

04:06:42.600 --> 04:06:49.320
clearly from district leaders who called in and spoke to us in july so these qualitative investments

04:06:49.400 --> 04:06:57.720
have to be based on a conversation that genuinely comes from discussion with stakeholders yet the

04:06:57.720 --> 04:07:04.120
opportunity for this department and this board to exert some leadership to make sure that is the

04:07:04.120 --> 04:07:12.520
kind of conversation that happens is not apparent or evident in this draft so i offer those criticisms

04:07:12.520 --> 04:07:20.200
as gently as i can but as harshly as i believe needs to be offered so that we again can see

04:07:20.200 --> 04:07:28.680
and say this is our board's opportunity to show leadership in this space about school improvement

04:07:28.680 --> 04:07:34.440
but in particular i need to know that for the school districts that i have been following ever

04:07:34.440 --> 04:07:40.920
since we implemented the l cap they have there's only six districts in this county and for all i

04:07:40.920 --> 04:07:47.080
mean there's only six for all six of these leas african-american students are underperforming in

04:07:47.080 --> 04:07:54.360
every single state test that is offered far below the other three larger school student subgroups

04:07:54.360 --> 04:08:00.920
for this entire county yet if i go through the program section for all six of these districts

04:08:00.920 --> 04:08:07.080
i can't count where african-american students are identified as the priority in all six of those

04:08:07.160 --> 04:08:13.960
districts even six times i do not see where what you have written here is going to improve the

04:08:13.960 --> 04:08:19.960
attention these six school districts in this single county will be paying for their underperforming

04:08:19.960 --> 04:08:30.200
african-american students thank you thank you um member escapado then member sun i see your hands

04:08:30.200 --> 04:08:38.840
up member escapado some suggestions i i do believe i i mean thank you for the presentation

04:08:38.840 --> 04:08:46.440
it was an elegant way of seeing where the monies are being concentrated however i think it's very

04:08:46.440 --> 04:08:54.280
important to have some ability to include an academic return upon investment again uh this

04:08:54.280 --> 04:09:01.400
pretty much connected to what trustee rucker stated is that we have to ensure somehow that

04:09:01.400 --> 04:09:08.840
we don't repeat strategies that do not work or have historically failed and and and is there

04:09:08.840 --> 04:09:13.880
any type of research and development there no especially you know we've identified these

04:09:13.880 --> 04:09:22.040
positive outliers so what you know how can we ensure that some of these research-based practices

04:09:22.040 --> 04:09:29.240
that have demonstrated significant growth with either african-american or english learners

04:09:30.120 --> 04:09:36.840
how do we we make sure that's part of this conversation and i do know that a lot of this

04:09:36.840 --> 04:09:43.240
conversation occurs between the district and the county level however in my experience there's a

04:09:43.240 --> 04:09:51.480
significant amount of time that focuses just on the formatting of the l cap document and and it

04:09:51.480 --> 04:10:00.840
is my hope that that conversation shifts and because this i mean i'm a huge fan of the l cap

04:10:01.480 --> 04:10:10.120
and and really the l cap has enhanced uh parent engagement it has been a great tool if if if used

04:10:10.120 --> 04:10:20.040
properly i i think we need to tweak in in the area of how it's being used that really focuses on on

04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:29.400
those populations that have not historically uh improved thank you all right members done

04:10:31.320 --> 04:10:36.280
thank you i i just want to preface um these comments first by saying that this is not a

04:10:36.360 --> 04:10:42.600
direct critique to the cde staff who worked very hard to put something together trying to meet

04:10:42.600 --> 04:10:50.200
legislative requirements and various groups that have wanted various things to be tweaked within

04:10:50.200 --> 04:10:59.240
the l cap but um i think that we have completely lost the force for the trees we have really lost

04:10:59.240 --> 04:11:07.000
our way on lcff i appreciate um member burrs and member strouss's comments um at the very beginning

04:11:07.560 --> 04:11:14.680
this is not what the intent of the l cap was supposed to be and we just continue to go down

04:11:14.680 --> 04:11:23.640
this road of complexity uh you know i i completed l caps for my school and work with other schools

04:11:23.640 --> 04:11:33.240
in l cap and in the what is it now seven years that we've had um the l cap it has become more

04:11:33.240 --> 04:11:40.280
tedious and repetitive and completely taken us off the track of the strategic instructional plan

04:11:40.280 --> 04:11:46.040
that that board member burr referred to if i think about my own parents who did not speak

04:11:46.680 --> 04:11:52.440
english and were not educated in the united states they may have been able to understand

04:11:53.160 --> 04:12:00.520
the l cap in the first maybe three additions of it if it had been translated into chinese

04:12:00.520 --> 04:12:05.000
at this point in time it doesn't matter if it's translated or not they would not be able to

04:12:05.000 --> 04:12:11.320
understand it and know why why would understand the purpose of it so i i just think that we need

04:12:11.320 --> 04:12:16.520
to kind of re-look at it structurally and i'm hearing comments from um member rucker as well

04:12:16.520 --> 04:12:22.920
is that we just really kind of need to step back and look at the whys of this um first of all

04:12:22.920 --> 04:12:29.400
i you know so i just offer a couple of things one is that we still are using a one-size-fits-all

04:12:29.400 --> 04:12:38.840
template for so many such a diversity of lea's within california we pride ourselves on diversity

04:12:38.920 --> 04:12:46.120
and equity in this state and yet we've created this one template that's for all sizes of of

04:12:46.120 --> 04:12:52.360
districts which does not make sense for me um and then when we're i now identify certain

04:12:52.360 --> 04:12:56.840
districts to have to complete different parts of the l cap that just makes it even more complex

04:12:57.480 --> 04:13:02.680
the second is that and i i think i mentioned this three versions ago when we were working on the l

04:13:02.680 --> 04:13:09.880
cap is that i think we have evolved because the nuances and because of the details we it's it

04:13:09.880 --> 04:13:17.160
doesn't fit into a 2d template we need something that's more 3d 4d whatever it might be so that

04:13:17.720 --> 04:13:25.000
to get to some of the nuances and details it isn't a matter of looking at one 100 page document

04:13:25.000 --> 04:13:31.080
that it needs to be more interactive in some way so that's a technology piece and that's something

04:13:31.080 --> 04:13:41.480
that that we really need to consider moving forward the fourth is operational agreements

04:13:41.480 --> 04:13:48.840
or principles i believe that we when we developed i believe it was the assessments we had some

04:13:48.840 --> 04:13:54.760
operational principles that we wanted to adhere to as we were developing the assessments it may

04:13:54.760 --> 04:13:59.800
have been accountability but we used to get michelle center used to remind us of that all the time

04:13:59.880 --> 04:14:05.240
what our our principles are we haven't developed that for the l cap i think we really need to

04:14:05.240 --> 04:14:11.960
develop some operational principles around this l cap before it gets further and further away from

04:14:11.960 --> 04:14:18.520
us um and then the last piece is the quality piece that that member rucker was speaking to

04:14:19.080 --> 04:14:25.080
i don't think that we get at quality through a form or template we get at quality through

04:14:25.160 --> 04:14:30.840
coaching technical assistance professional development and that kind of work and we we

04:14:30.840 --> 04:14:38.120
don't emphasize that enough when we say that lea's are not lea's are not

04:14:39.960 --> 04:14:46.280
adhering to accounting for all of their funds and all that i think that is a role for the

04:14:46.280 --> 04:14:54.200
county offices and cd staff to provide those types of technical assistance rather than try to cram

04:14:54.200 --> 04:15:01.000
more and more things into this 2d template that doesn't fit what the intent and purposes were

04:15:01.000 --> 04:15:10.120
in the first place so that's my comment thanks thank you okay vice president stroust and then

04:15:10.120 --> 04:15:18.680
member bananca so um i want to build on what member sun and member rucker talked about um and

04:15:18.680 --> 04:15:23.800
talk about first i think it's too complicated i think i made that comment in the beginning and

04:15:23.960 --> 04:15:29.560
i would like some guidance and recommendations from cd staff and the input sessions they're going

04:15:29.560 --> 04:15:36.600
to get about areas we can improve and reduce the redundancy and make this more useful but once we

04:15:36.600 --> 04:15:42.280
get this template approved which we have to do by the end of november my question is then how does

04:15:42.280 --> 04:15:48.040
it get translated and as we know we have more than a thousand lea's half of which are 2500 or less

04:15:48.120 --> 04:15:53.720
which means they have a very small staff in the district office and the 58 counties and we know

04:15:53.720 --> 04:16:01.000
that every thing is a little different based on size one la county 25 of all the kids in california

04:16:01.000 --> 04:16:10.040
some counties one district so how we translate this now then back to school districts through

04:16:10.040 --> 04:16:16.600
county offices is going to be incredibly important that we're consistent and so i'm hoping that

04:16:16.600 --> 04:16:22.680
through cd and success that we can build a support and a communications tool which gives

04:16:22.680 --> 04:16:28.920
clear messaging on how do you complete this based on the intent to meet the intent of the law and

04:16:28.920 --> 04:16:36.040
the guidance of what we did and so again i think that would be something else i would request for

04:16:36.040 --> 04:16:41.880
our november meeting which is once we get it to a point where we've met the legal requirements and

04:16:41.880 --> 04:16:49.800
we've done the best we can this round how does that now get communicated to lea's through county

04:16:49.800 --> 04:16:55.720
offices so that the communications on how to complete it are clear and the review process

04:16:55.720 --> 04:17:01.480
is fair because my understanding from the field is county offices do this review differently

04:17:01.480 --> 04:17:07.160
based on staffing and how they approach it so i think it's a whole system issue and i don't want

04:17:07.160 --> 04:17:12.280
to deal just with the template and then have all the frustration at the district level which is

04:17:12.280 --> 04:17:18.120
already there and how we you know and maybe member glover woods as a county office administrator

04:17:18.120 --> 04:17:24.280
could help us think about how do we communicate this and get some continuity and some fairness

04:17:24.280 --> 04:17:31.480
and consistency across the process as we go forward thank you thank you member

04:17:32.120 --> 04:17:39.960
uh bananka and then member glover woods thank you so before i begin i'd like to thank the cdc

04:17:39.960 --> 04:17:44.200
the cde staff yet again for breaking this item down so well through your presentation

04:17:45.160 --> 04:17:50.360
beginning with the first part of this item regarding the underperforming student groups

04:17:50.360 --> 04:17:56.200
and underperforming schools i completely agree with member ruckers comments that educational

04:17:56.200 --> 04:18:02.600
partners engagement should not be considered as an afterthought when it comes to l cap so i would

04:18:02.600 --> 04:18:08.680
recommend that we stipulate somewhere in there that lea's must consult students who are either

04:18:08.680 --> 04:18:14.360
members of the low lowest performing groups or the students at those low performing schools when

04:18:14.360 --> 04:18:19.800
writing their goal because i think it's so important just because of the fact that those

04:18:19.800 --> 04:18:25.400
students are in the schools more than likely they understand what their school is missing out on

04:18:25.400 --> 04:18:32.360
better than arguably anyone else because they're actually living that system and also i think we

04:18:32.360 --> 04:18:37.800
should make sure that students aren't there just to check a box but their input is actually noted

04:18:37.800 --> 04:18:43.080
and listened to i know that on my l cap committee it sometimes does feel like we're just there to

04:18:43.080 --> 04:18:49.720
fulfill a requirement and that we're not necessarily being listened to or adults aren't making room in

04:18:49.720 --> 04:18:57.080
the conversation for us so i think we need to include their input in these decisions for how to

04:18:57.080 --> 04:19:03.560
write these goals addressing the underperforming student groups and schools and then in regards to

04:19:03.560 --> 04:19:08.360
the second part regarding qualitative improvements and turning those into percentages

04:19:08.920 --> 04:19:15.560
i completely agree with the many members that are stating that we need to clarify this a lot more

04:19:15.560 --> 04:19:20.120
there needs to be more direct and explicit instructions on how to do this because it's

04:19:20.120 --> 04:19:27.480
extremely subjective and it's definitely not something that you know an lea can just think

04:19:27.480 --> 04:19:35.720
up off the top of their head and i also think that we really do need to make trainings accessible we

04:19:35.720 --> 04:19:41.960
need to provide context give examples when we're explaining this so that it makes sense and i want

04:19:41.960 --> 04:19:47.960
to echo vice president strauss and member burr's comments on ensuring that we don't convolute l cap

04:19:47.960 --> 04:19:53.720
to the point where it only makes sense to the experts and not to the community members because

04:19:53.720 --> 04:19:58.360
the whole point of l cap is to include the community it's to include the people that are

04:19:58.360 --> 04:20:03.400
living the education system or being affected by it and so when it gets to the point where it's way

04:20:03.400 --> 04:20:10.760
too convoluted then the entire purpose of l cap kind of fails to to be realized so i think that

04:20:10.760 --> 04:20:15.160
the easier it is to understand the easier that we can make it to understand for just the common

04:20:15.160 --> 04:20:21.000
person the more accessible it is and the more leas can truly receive community feedback and

04:20:21.000 --> 04:20:26.280
engagement and i can just say as someone who did start on their l cap community not or committee

04:20:26.280 --> 04:20:33.240
not really understanding um all that much about it i felt like when i started it felt like i was

04:20:33.240 --> 04:20:38.680
reading a whole another language like a foreign language uh because there's so many technical

04:20:38.680 --> 04:20:45.160
terms it's very confusing to someone especially students who are busy have extracurriculars may

04:20:45.160 --> 04:20:50.360
be applying to college this isn't what they do for a living and so we have to keep that in mind

04:20:50.360 --> 04:20:58.120
when developing these instructions on how to necessarily translate these qualitative

04:20:58.120 --> 04:20:59.560
improvements into percentages

04:21:02.840 --> 04:21:10.120
thank you um we have in the queue um member glover woods member burr and member patio brownson

04:21:11.480 --> 04:21:19.560
member glover woods thank you um just a couple of points and not to rehash a lot of what has

04:21:19.560 --> 04:21:26.520
already been said by my fellow board members but i think there are two key areas that we have um

04:21:27.320 --> 04:21:32.280
talked about and i'm thinking about what has been asked in this item which is to provide feedback

04:21:33.160 --> 04:21:38.760
one of the areas is to look at the recent requirements and see how to best represent

04:21:38.760 --> 04:21:45.080
that in the template format the larger looming question which is not necessarily called for in

04:21:45.080 --> 04:21:49.800
this item but which has been echoed by many of the board members especially those who've been

04:21:49.800 --> 04:21:57.480
there from the onset is how to ensure that the LCAP retains its original purpose and i remember

04:21:57.480 --> 04:22:04.680
the first template um reviewing and all of those different things and it has evolved into quite a

04:22:04.680 --> 04:22:10.920
different document than what was originally intended um and quite a complicated document

04:22:10.920 --> 04:22:17.480
and um i don't think it's of any fault of anyone who's provided feedback and input or the hard work

04:22:17.480 --> 04:22:22.920
of the staff the CDE staff and the educational partners who provided input it's been a result

04:22:22.920 --> 04:22:29.080
of a lot of different requests and requirements and it's just taken on a life of its own but at

04:22:29.080 --> 04:22:34.680
the end of the day if it's to be a strategic planning document uh if no one can understand

04:22:34.680 --> 04:22:39.640
what it is i'm not quite sure how it helps to direct the strategic plans that are to actually

04:22:39.720 --> 04:22:47.880
be implemented so what i would um just encourage under the lane of feedback is that as uh staff

04:22:47.880 --> 04:22:56.600
goes into conversation between now and the next november state board meeting um one is to grapple

04:22:56.600 --> 04:23:01.560
with again the requirements and there were two things that were really brought forward how to

04:23:01.560 --> 04:23:10.120
represent those qualitative supports and services for unduplicated pupils in a way that um maintains

04:23:10.760 --> 04:23:15.880
the qualitative aspect of it but also is able to address some of the needs on how do we know

04:23:16.520 --> 04:23:23.880
that um funds that were expended for quantitative purposes don't get lost in the shuffle the other

04:23:23.880 --> 04:23:29.160
is really again i'm going to go back to one of the first ones which was clarifying goals

04:23:29.880 --> 04:23:37.080
and for those requirements related to student groups that are performing below their peers

04:23:37.080 --> 04:23:45.240
or schools within an lea it really seems that there should be something very clearly called out

04:23:45.240 --> 04:23:51.640
in the goal section so that it is clear that those two areas are being addressed for the leas in

04:23:51.640 --> 04:23:58.360
which that requirement would apply and then i just encourage moving forward i don't know that it can

04:23:58.360 --> 04:24:04.520
happen between now and november but it seems like a very larger piece which is just convening more

04:24:04.520 --> 04:24:10.360
conversation and more groups around what was the original intent of the l cap how does the story

04:24:10.360 --> 04:24:16.680
and how does it maintain its purpose as a strategic planning document that's easily understood and

04:24:16.680 --> 04:24:23.160
into and really uh contains the feedback from all educational partners that's a larger conversation

04:24:23.880 --> 04:24:27.720
but i encourage that that conversation take place because i think we can get back to the

04:24:27.720 --> 04:24:32.200
original purpose it's just going to take all of the educational partners together

04:24:32.200 --> 04:24:39.800
um engaging in that conversation to do so thank you um i have member burr member patio bronson

04:24:39.800 --> 04:24:47.080
and member mcquillin uh in in the lineup member burr thank you so i won't repeat what has been

04:24:47.080 --> 04:24:52.600
so eloquently said by my fellow board members about returning to the original intent and having

04:24:52.600 --> 04:24:57.000
that conversation but i want to take a little bit of a different tack here because one of the things

04:24:57.000 --> 04:25:04.440
i'm concerned about is um knowing the context in which these requirements were enacted and i want

04:25:04.440 --> 04:25:09.560
to return to i think our very start of this meeting and something that president darlingham

04:25:09.560 --> 04:25:15.480
and said when we put the budget together this year we thought the school environment was going

04:25:15.480 --> 04:25:20.680
to look very different and we thought the pandemic was going to be over and we were all celebrating

04:25:21.320 --> 04:25:28.120
that has changed a lot and the um requirements that we have put on school districts with respect

04:25:28.120 --> 04:25:34.360
to the pandemic all rightfully done and in the interest of public health and are especially the

04:25:34.360 --> 04:25:40.440
health of our students and our staff are good ones but i worry a little bit that these requirements

04:25:40.440 --> 04:25:45.000
about all of this very specific accounting and what's happening and are you going to spend all

04:25:45.000 --> 04:25:50.040
your money were put on at a time when we thought things were going to be a lot better in terms of

04:25:50.040 --> 04:25:56.600
the educational environment so i would just ask both our staff and the department staff to sort

04:25:56.600 --> 04:26:01.720
of go back and think about that a little bit and also talk to legislative staff about what was your

04:26:01.720 --> 04:26:07.320
intent here and i'll just give you a very specific example every time i heard the conversation about

04:26:07.320 --> 04:26:12.680
carryover i thought oh my gosh these school districts just got a boatload of money which

04:26:12.680 --> 04:26:19.400
they deserved and they but they're having a heck of a time hiring staff and they're going to find

04:26:19.400 --> 04:26:24.840
themselves in the middle of the year with half a boatload of money because they can't hire the

04:26:24.840 --> 04:26:33.320
staff they need especially staff counselors nurses folks who are in short supply anyway and if i

04:26:33.320 --> 04:26:39.480
heard the details correctly we're going to expect them to expend all that money in the year we're

04:26:39.480 --> 04:26:47.480
in right now or next year so i again i just i worry that we're setting our lea's up for failure

04:26:48.120 --> 04:26:54.280
by a circumstance that has changed and i so appreciated president darling hamlin's comment

04:26:54.280 --> 04:27:02.440
about we have been humbled by this and i feel like we are we have legislation that is still in a place

04:27:02.440 --> 04:27:08.600
where we're not and we're not going to be for a long time so i don't want to be implementing

04:27:08.600 --> 04:27:13.640
things i feel like we're trying to hit a moving target here a little bit that really are not

04:27:13.640 --> 04:27:18.200
workable and i think that's a lot of what you were hearing especially from our lea partners

04:27:18.200 --> 04:27:24.040
in the feedback so i i just want to think about that a little bit and i just want to circle back

04:27:24.040 --> 04:27:29.800
to one thing that member sun said about operating principles what are our operating principles here

04:27:29.800 --> 04:27:35.960
and maybe if we set some up in the content context of the environment in which we know

04:27:35.960 --> 04:27:41.400
we're going to be operating and for some number of months and as president darling hamlin said

04:27:41.400 --> 04:27:47.400
we don't know what we're going to happen as these additional variants come on board so

04:27:48.280 --> 04:27:52.920
i just don't want to put our lea's and all of our education stakeholder partners

04:27:52.920 --> 04:27:59.160
in a circumstance that's just not doable and make things even harder than they already are

04:28:00.040 --> 04:28:03.640
oh well said member patty o'brownson

04:28:05.160 --> 04:28:13.400
and i also wanted to thank the team for the eloquent presentation and also for being really

04:28:13.400 --> 04:28:18.840
in the midst of so many people who have such high aspirations for how this document can work

04:28:19.800 --> 04:28:24.440
it's only i think really a testament to how important it is that people are

04:28:24.600 --> 04:28:31.240
sort of giving this level of feedback and interest and really giving voice to the aspiration that we

04:28:31.240 --> 04:28:37.320
get it right i also wanted to align myself with the comments earlier from board member rocker

04:28:37.320 --> 04:28:45.080
and escapado around the importance of actually naming the student populations where we are seeing

04:28:45.080 --> 04:28:50.280
chronic underperformance and also naming the specific interventions and why we think they

04:28:50.920 --> 04:29:00.840
will work this is i think been a continuing thread and it is it is the perfect place to sort of shine

04:29:00.840 --> 04:29:07.880
a light on this and help lea's actually think through how to actually break through and actually

04:29:07.880 --> 04:29:14.440
see some progress where we know there have been pockets of progress in some districts and where

04:29:14.600 --> 04:29:20.760
of progress in some districts and where we have seen either a plateau or a lack of

04:29:20.760 --> 04:29:26.920
attention in other districts the other theme i think that that has come across consistently

04:29:26.920 --> 04:29:34.040
is a desire for greater clarification as to what a qualitative improvement should be defined as

04:29:34.040 --> 04:29:41.640
i think the percentage designation that's on some of the charts gets to this idea but also

04:29:42.520 --> 04:29:46.120
sort of flattens the idea of what a qualitative improvement might look like

04:29:46.680 --> 04:29:52.680
it doesn't get to or yet address the idea of what a more effective intervention might look like

04:29:53.480 --> 04:30:01.560
or necessarily urge that conversation to think about effectiveness beyond sort of what a percentage

04:30:01.560 --> 04:30:13.640
calculation of on a chart might look like i'd also recommend that folks consider some of the sample

04:30:14.360 --> 04:30:20.760
templates that have been offered in public comments the lcff equity coalition offered

04:30:21.320 --> 04:30:27.640
what i think are actually quite helpful sort of back-to-back tables as suggestions for how

04:30:27.640 --> 04:30:33.640
you could actually draw attention to what is different and what the change of strategy could be

04:30:35.800 --> 04:30:41.400
and then the last thing i just wanted to raise which is is actually less than a part of the

04:30:41.400 --> 04:30:48.600
conversation of the five amendments that that cde has presented for our consideration and is more

04:30:48.600 --> 04:30:55.560
in the the bucket of general improvement and clarification potential for the l cap

04:30:56.840 --> 04:31:03.160
so as as was mentioned earlier by the superintendent with the universal tk

04:31:04.040 --> 04:31:12.680
budget and legislation that was enacted this year there is an opportunity i think to help

04:31:12.760 --> 04:31:20.040
districts understand what that means through the l cap process i recall when the original

04:31:20.040 --> 04:31:25.320
samidian legislation was passed back in 2010 which created the first cohort of

04:31:26.120 --> 04:31:32.600
transitional kindergarten eligibility and i as then an advocate working with several school districts

04:31:32.600 --> 04:31:40.840
recall hearing administrators superintendents tell me directly that tk students didn't generate

04:31:40.840 --> 04:31:49.160
ada once we got to lcff i recall people directly saying tk students didn't need to or couldn't be

04:31:49.160 --> 04:31:57.080
incorporated within a district's lcff l cap plan that they didn't generate supplemental grants that

04:31:57.080 --> 04:32:04.360
they didn't count towards uh concentration configurations and all of that obviously is

04:32:05.320 --> 04:32:12.280
and yet this is a prime document that could actually communicate that tk to 12 is the grade

04:32:12.280 --> 04:32:20.920
span so i would encourage us as we think about clarifying moments where we can actually put in

04:32:20.920 --> 04:32:27.400
language to reference the tk to 12 grade spans to call the district's attention to the opportunities

04:32:27.960 --> 04:32:28.840
better before them

04:32:31.480 --> 04:32:36.040
thank you uh member mcquillin and then member rodriguez

04:32:37.800 --> 04:32:44.520
thank you i won't i'll be brief i know we're way over time now and uh we gave up our lunch i'm

04:32:44.520 --> 04:32:50.680
feeling that uh thank you for all the great comments and thank you uh to our staff members

04:32:50.680 --> 04:33:00.840
for presenting a very complicated uh the changes or amendments to the l cap that has become very

04:33:00.840 --> 04:33:09.240
complicated and really should not be i i really appreciated our student members comments in that

04:33:09.240 --> 04:33:15.560
the l cap has become very daunting and really should be a document that communities

04:33:16.280 --> 04:33:22.520
can understand and can be made more succinct and understandable

04:33:23.960 --> 04:33:31.000
but i i also agree with the comments that the low performing subgroups there needs to be a mechanism

04:33:31.000 --> 04:33:36.840
that those groups are mentioned in the planning process in this planning document you know in our

04:33:36.840 --> 04:33:42.840
areas of the north state we have many american indian students that are performing very low

04:33:42.840 --> 04:33:48.680
in terms of their their scores across the board and many districts are not setting goals or

04:33:48.680 --> 04:33:55.560
mentioning the subgroups there i know one of the callers pointed that out also so i agree that we

04:33:55.560 --> 04:34:02.920
need a mechanism to ensure that those subgroups are a part of the plan and being addressed within

04:34:02.920 --> 04:34:10.280
the plan and then the other part i will um carry this forward to the american indian oversight

04:34:10.280 --> 04:34:17.000
committee i think it was amendment number five where some changes in the language moving away

04:34:17.000 --> 04:34:25.000
from the stakeholder words and and looking for suggestions there of maybe partners or

04:34:26.280 --> 04:34:33.960
interested parties or looking for other wording there you know we we do live in a more compassionate

04:34:33.960 --> 04:34:40.600
world now and you know the changes that we're undergoing when we look at the mascot issue or

04:34:42.440 --> 04:34:46.920
sports professional sports teams that are changing and dropping their names and

04:34:47.480 --> 04:34:51.640
or even ski resorts that need to look at their names and changing those that

04:34:52.440 --> 04:34:59.080
are insensitive to the first peoples and the indigenous peoples of of the land here

04:34:59.640 --> 04:35:08.200
so i appreciate that that component and that possible amendment also thank you thank you

04:35:08.920 --> 04:35:17.160
member rodriguez yes thank you um and i want to thank everybody um and especially the cd for this

04:35:17.160 --> 04:35:24.040
very complete um presentation and you know i echo everything that's been said especially naming the

04:35:24.120 --> 04:35:29.320
students um and one of the things that that really struck me because this has been on my

04:35:29.320 --> 04:35:37.160
mind a lot member bananca your very articulate um exposition about the experience with the l cap

04:35:37.160 --> 04:35:45.800
and just how um it feels like a foreign language um and so i i'm all for more clarity and making

04:35:45.800 --> 04:35:51.640
it understandable and digestible too so that people feel like they can contribute you said

04:35:51.640 --> 04:35:56.600
something that really struck me because i've been thinking about this a lot and that's the checklist

04:35:58.040 --> 04:36:04.360
and i think that what happens is you know because of nclb districts are still kind of in that

04:36:04.360 --> 04:36:09.320
mindset of very compliance oriented and so there's this checklist instead of thinking

04:36:09.320 --> 04:36:14.120
we have these students right that we've named that we really need to give extra supports to

04:36:14.120 --> 04:36:19.720
how can we creatively do that and as opposed to like oh they all came to the meeting and so we

04:36:19.720 --> 04:36:26.680
met that requirement so i really hope that we as a board look a lot more at those students and

04:36:28.200 --> 04:36:34.200
name them and see how we can best serve them so that they can achieve their academic goals

04:36:34.200 --> 04:36:42.120
and dreams because they they do have them you know just for they they they start letting go of them

04:36:42.120 --> 04:36:49.240
when our schools can't serve them or won't serve them and lastly i want to comment on the stakeholder

04:36:49.960 --> 04:36:57.320
um expression i've always found that to be very aggressive and violent and for that reason like

04:36:57.320 --> 04:37:04.520
i pictured like oh i'm laying my stake here and so i was really excited to hear hear um us looking

04:37:04.520 --> 04:37:11.480
for another word uh for to express the the partners the communities that come together

04:37:11.480 --> 04:37:17.880
for the betterment of our schools thank you thank you and i think everyone has commented i will

04:37:17.880 --> 04:37:23.880
simply associate myself with a lot of the comments that have been made i want to thank the staff

04:37:23.880 --> 04:37:33.080
again for the enormous work that's gone into the process i think we have some clear goals in mind

04:37:33.080 --> 04:37:38.360
and i know that it's challenging when on the one hand we have legislation asking for you know much

04:37:38.360 --> 04:37:44.200
more specificity of certain kinds and on the other hand we still want to preserve the nature of this

04:37:44.200 --> 04:37:51.000
document as the strategic planning tool and as something that is both understandable by

04:37:51.000 --> 04:38:00.280
constituencies and manageable by educators i want to hold up member burr's comments about you know

04:38:00.280 --> 04:38:05.720
how much adjustment and readjustment and re-readjustment educators have had to do over

04:38:05.720 --> 04:38:11.080
this last year and we'll need to do over this next year and that we need to have that frame of mind

04:38:11.160 --> 04:38:17.000
and we need not to box people in so that they feel like they have to do things that are sub-optimal

04:38:17.000 --> 04:38:22.920
you know because they're trying to meet a compliance requirement you know educators

04:38:22.920 --> 04:38:27.400
across the state for the most part are focused on trying to serve the you know children and

04:38:27.400 --> 04:38:34.600
families i think there's a strong message from the board that students who are struggling and

04:38:34.600 --> 04:38:42.040
performing less well in any respect need to be explicitly attended to in the thinking about

04:38:42.040 --> 04:38:48.120
the strategic planning and in the communication on the tool and then you know we need to make

04:38:48.120 --> 04:39:01.160
ways for that tool to be useful and legible i also want to affirm the thanks to the staff

04:39:01.160 --> 04:39:06.040
for raising up the issue of changing the language around stakeholders and for that sensitivity

04:39:06.040 --> 04:39:12.280
and look forward to the new language that will emerge and finally i want to recognize that

04:39:12.280 --> 04:39:17.880
member mcquillin noted that he gave up lunch and i don't want anyone giving up lunch so let me

04:39:17.880 --> 04:39:23.880
suggest to you that if you need a personal break as i said at the beginning just text brooks when

04:39:23.880 --> 04:39:29.240
you have to go off camera and take a personal break get food if you need to eat it off camera

04:39:30.040 --> 04:39:35.640
do what you need to do to be fortified because we are only halfway through

04:39:37.080 --> 04:39:45.640
i need you strong and engaged and no one should be angry here because they had to give up lunch

04:39:45.640 --> 04:39:52.360
so we do want you to take care of yourselves a little self-care here and with that we are

04:39:52.360 --> 04:39:58.840
going to conclude this item and it's an information item i i'm sure that the staff

04:39:58.840 --> 04:40:05.640
has taken away a great deal to ponder and to work on and we will work with them in a

04:40:05.640 --> 04:40:12.840
collaborative spirit to get to the to the goal we're not going to take a break formally because

04:40:12.840 --> 04:40:18.760
we are about an hour behind where we had thought we might be so i do encourage you if you did not

04:40:18.760 --> 04:40:24.920
grab some food to take a personal break if you need to grab it don't be embarrassed about eating

04:40:24.920 --> 04:40:30.120
on camera whoever's talking is actually i think spotlighted so if you're not talking you're

04:40:30.120 --> 04:40:37.160
probably safe to eat your lunch and we will go on to item number four which is the new targets for

04:40:37.160 --> 04:40:42.600
state performance plan indicators in the annual performance report for part b of the individuals

04:40:42.600 --> 04:40:50.280
with disabilities education act of 2004 and the cde is recommending that we review and provide

04:40:50.840 --> 04:40:56.040
the department with feedback on the proposed new targets and they'll return in november

04:40:56.040 --> 04:41:01.000
to present the final targets for consideration for approval and the item will be presented by

04:41:01.000 --> 04:41:05.240
heather calamities of the cde so heather please do you

04:41:19.800 --> 04:41:20.680
thank you so much and

04:41:24.360 --> 04:41:30.520
good afternoon um president linda darling hammon and sb members i'm glad to see you all and hope

04:41:30.520 --> 04:41:36.680
all that is well today's agenda item tells an exciting story of the trajectory of the special

04:41:36.680 --> 04:41:43.960
education in california the state performance plan which is part of the apr is much more than a

04:41:43.960 --> 04:41:49.480
required federal submission to the office of special education programs it is the heart and

04:41:49.480 --> 04:41:55.240
soul of our special education system it's our north star it's why we do the work that we do

04:41:56.200 --> 04:42:00.520
the presentation of this material is a culmination of many meetings

04:42:00.520 --> 04:42:07.080
many hours and many discussions over the past several years the efforts by our community led

04:42:07.080 --> 04:42:13.640
by cde special education staff and our partners to meaningfully make changes to our system are

04:42:13.640 --> 04:42:20.280
heroic the spp targets are our key levers of improvement to systems which ultimately result

04:42:20.360 --> 04:42:26.520
in improvement to student outcomes our new proposed targets reflect input from a wide variety

04:42:26.520 --> 04:42:31.400
of the special education community here in california and it is an honor and an opportunity

04:42:31.400 --> 04:42:36.520
to present our roadmap as we believe our paths will continue to get brighter in the days and

04:42:36.520 --> 04:42:44.360
weeks and months to come in regards to the timeline that has been mentioned previously

04:42:45.240 --> 04:42:52.280
the cde is required to submit the spp targets and the 2020 apr in february of 2022

04:42:53.160 --> 04:42:57.800
in order to meet the required deadline you will be reviewing and providing feedback

04:42:57.800 --> 04:43:04.440
on the proposed targets in this presentation in november you will be voting to approve the

04:43:04.440 --> 04:43:13.320
proposed spp targets in january of 2022 you will be reviewing and approving the 2020 annual

04:43:13.320 --> 04:43:20.600
performance report which is known as the apr in february both are submitted for review and

04:43:20.600 --> 04:43:27.800
approval by os by osep once submitted the cde staff meets with our osep assigned contact for

04:43:27.800 --> 04:43:32.600
comments questions and clarifications and the typical process concludes by april of may of each

04:43:32.600 --> 04:43:40.280
year in terms of the experience for students with disabilities in california the next slides will

04:43:40.280 --> 04:43:46.280
walk through some basic demographic information for our students and about our students so that

04:43:46.280 --> 04:43:50.680
you can get to know them a little bit better you have seen these slides before in previous

04:43:51.480 --> 04:43:56.840
presentations but i think it's important for us to ground ourselves in the demographic specifically

04:43:56.840 --> 04:44:01.480
of who we're referencing in this presentation and we know that the numbers in the next slide

04:44:01.480 --> 04:44:05.560
present the faces of our students in our communities and in our schools and in our families

04:44:06.200 --> 04:44:11.160
but the numbers tell a story of a system in need of intervention we have identified a need

04:44:11.160 --> 04:44:16.920
and we have provided support our education system is deeply complex and deeply rooted in social

04:44:16.920 --> 04:44:23.720
justice our society chose not to educate students with disabilities in the 1970s and instead we

04:44:23.720 --> 04:44:29.080
chose institutionalizing and pathologizing our students with our students with disabilities

04:44:29.880 --> 04:44:34.760
special education remains an issue of social justice and equity and invisibility and the

04:44:34.760 --> 04:44:39.240
state of california has made significant historic and visionary investments in special education

04:44:40.760 --> 04:44:44.200
the education experience of students with disabilities is just one of the foundational

04:44:44.200 --> 04:44:51.240
experiences that frame and shape and influence who our students will become the experience is

04:44:51.240 --> 04:44:57.240
much more than a series of academic events or progressing from grade to grade the experience

04:44:57.240 --> 04:45:02.600
includes making meaning of living life with a disability developing skills to navigate the world

04:45:04.760 --> 04:45:12.600
and knowing that disability includes a stigma in part of our society and also the pursuit of

04:45:12.600 --> 04:45:20.600
excess full access and opportunity is our ultimate end game so in 2020 2019 and 2020 school year

04:45:20.600 --> 04:45:28.120
there are just north of 804 000 students with disabilities ages 0 to 22 0 to 22 served in the

04:45:28.120 --> 04:45:37.320
california public school system 752 000 are k-12 students with disabilities which represent

04:45:37.320 --> 04:45:43.560
12.2 percent of california's k-12 population of just over six million the numbers in terms

04:45:43.560 --> 04:45:47.720
of the representation of percentage of students with disabilities in the state of california

04:45:47.720 --> 04:45:52.360
is on par with many of the other states across the country in terms of proportion of students

04:45:52.360 --> 04:45:57.240
with disabilities identified in their total student population the next slides in which

04:45:57.240 --> 04:46:04.840
you've seen before point out specifically students within each group who are identified

04:46:04.840 --> 04:46:11.240
as having IEPs in the local control funding formula from 2019 to 2020 so the first pie chart

04:46:11.240 --> 04:46:20.200
that you see before you outlines that 13 percent of our students with IEPs are also identified as

04:46:21.480 --> 04:46:26.280
socioeconomically disadvantaged students that also have IEPs in the local control funding formula

04:46:26.280 --> 04:46:32.920
there are 27 percent of foster youth with IEPs and then there are 17 percent of english learners

04:46:33.880 --> 04:46:35.000
with IEPs as well

04:46:37.880 --> 04:46:44.200
the next pie chart here outlines out of the students with disabilities total how many

04:46:44.200 --> 04:46:51.720
students actually are identified in one or more LCFF student groups in 2019 2020 so in this pie

04:46:51.720 --> 04:46:57.400
chart here you will see that 70 percent of our student groups or 70 percent 70 percent of students

04:46:57.400 --> 04:47:05.640
with IEPs are also located are found or identified as also being identified in the LCFF student groups

04:47:09.160 --> 04:47:14.280
in terms of our demographics and how we monitor and support students with disabilities across

04:47:14.280 --> 04:47:20.680
the state of california in the special education division we tier our LEAs in terms of

04:47:21.800 --> 04:47:26.280
needing support direct support from the CDE and our technical assistance partners

04:47:26.840 --> 04:47:31.800
and so on the right hand side you will see i'm sorry the left hand side you will see

04:47:32.600 --> 04:47:37.080
the the levels of one intensity in which we engage with our LEAs across the state

04:47:37.640 --> 04:47:43.240
and two the number of LEAs that are found or that have been identified in each tier by the CDE

04:47:43.240 --> 04:47:49.320
so in our intensive targets there are 204 LEAs identified in our targeted

04:47:50.440 --> 04:47:58.120
tier there are 1400 just over 1400 LEAs and then in our universal tier there are just over 500

04:47:58.120 --> 04:48:03.720
and the corresponding inverted triangle that you see is an indication or visual representation

04:48:03.720 --> 04:48:08.280
of how the CDE and our technical assistance partners provide support to our LEAs across

04:48:08.680 --> 04:48:15.960
the state directive support assistance and then resources it is also important to note that

04:48:15.960 --> 04:48:21.960
there are 203 LEAs as noted that have been identified for differentiated assistance for

04:48:21.960 --> 04:48:30.520
student outcomes so in that left hand triangle that you see somewhere along the line those 203

04:48:30.520 --> 04:48:34.680
LEAs are somewhere either in the intensive targeted or universal tier

04:48:38.280 --> 04:48:42.520
as we walk through the rest of the presentation and the rest of the data here today it's important

04:48:42.520 --> 04:48:51.480
to note the conditions that are placed or or actually upon our system that present challenges

04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:58.200
and barriers to alignment of our systems and ensuring more inclusive efforts across the state

04:48:58.760 --> 04:49:02.920
first and foremost the teacher shortage which many of which you've heard about today

04:49:03.080 --> 04:49:09.080
severely impacts the field of special education and the impact is felt at the student level

04:49:09.080 --> 04:49:14.360
for students with disabilities not only as a teacher shortage you know at the teacher level

04:49:14.360 --> 04:49:17.560
but we also are experiencing shortages of related service providers,

04:49:17.560 --> 04:49:23.320
paraprofessionals and special education administrators there's a need for additional

04:49:23.320 --> 04:49:28.600
access to the general education environment and we'll talk a little bit more later about

04:49:28.680 --> 04:49:33.560
we'll talk a little bit more later about inclusion inclusive environments through one of our

04:49:33.560 --> 04:49:39.880
indicators indicator five the need for additional universal design for learning resources and

04:49:39.880 --> 04:49:47.480
training across the state of California in talking with one of our SELPA improvement leads

04:49:47.480 --> 04:49:51.880
the one of the number one requests for our teachers by our teachers across the state of

04:49:51.880 --> 04:49:56.600
California additional opportunities to learn more about implementing UDL in the classroom

04:49:59.560 --> 04:50:05.960
the conditions also in terms of having two side load systems that run parallel both at the LEA

04:50:05.960 --> 04:50:12.440
level and also the state level as well we know that special education is part of the general

04:50:12.440 --> 04:50:20.280
education system however over time those two systems have existed and crossed paths only

04:50:20.760 --> 04:50:25.960
when necessary or needed and more intentional efforts are needed to bring greater alignment

04:50:26.360 --> 04:50:31.240
to both of those systems statewide and also the need to examine and address

04:50:31.240 --> 04:50:36.120
the implication of inherent bias and systemic racism in our systems of identification placement

04:50:36.120 --> 04:50:43.400
and discipline as well as I mentioned in the opening slide the annual performance report

04:50:44.360 --> 04:50:52.280
contains the state performance plan so the APR consists of 17 indicators indicators are

04:50:52.280 --> 04:50:57.560
categorized as either compliance or performance and then there's one indicator that has a both

04:50:57.560 --> 04:51:04.520
of compliance and performance elements the state performance plan that you will be hearing about

04:51:04.520 --> 04:51:11.080
today is about setting the state targets for the next six year cycle the annual performance report

04:51:11.080 --> 04:51:17.720
that is also part of the package is merely our annual reporting on how California is progressing

04:51:17.720 --> 04:51:23.880
towards those targets as well the combination of these two activities is known as the SPP APR

04:51:23.880 --> 04:51:30.280
so the past cycle started in 2013 and ended in 2019 and our new targets will be set from 2020

04:51:30.280 --> 04:51:40.040
to 2025 over a two-year period nine meetings were held in terms of engagement in the feedback and

04:51:40.040 --> 04:51:47.000
the development of the new targets as well the meetings began in August of 2019 and included a

04:51:47.000 --> 04:51:51.880
diverse educational partnership group that you see before you today these meetings were designed

04:51:51.880 --> 04:51:57.000
to engage community members from various backgrounds included educators included parents

04:51:57.000 --> 04:52:02.520
school administrators policy advisors school psychologists family empowerment centers and

04:52:02.520 --> 04:52:07.800
early education and advocacy groups these meetings were held in person prior to covid and then

04:52:07.800 --> 04:52:16.840
virtually during the pandemic in terms of the feedback timeline mapping from August of 2019

04:52:17.000 --> 04:52:22.840
to now the associate director Shiloh Duncan Bessaril and said staff presented the performance

04:52:22.840 --> 04:52:30.040
indicators to our community the presentations included an explanation of how each indicator

04:52:30.040 --> 04:52:35.800
is defined measured and calculated and an in-depth history of the statewide performance trends over

04:52:35.800 --> 04:52:41.720
the past five years along with data forecasting these meetings provided time for the community

04:52:42.680 --> 04:52:50.440
to discuss statewide data target setting and and how the CDE can provide supports for LEAs

04:52:50.440 --> 04:52:56.120
to meet the more rigorous targets the community was actively engaged and asked critical questions

04:52:56.120 --> 04:53:00.760
in their pursuit of developing the suggested targets and the community members also brought

04:53:00.760 --> 04:53:06.280
their unique perspective and also worked in small groups to discuss and develop the suggested targets

04:53:12.440 --> 04:53:21.240
The I will first walk through the compliance indicators and rather quickly and then move on to

04:53:21.240 --> 04:53:26.760
the performance indicators which is the meat really of this conversation today. I want to recognize

04:53:26.760 --> 04:53:30.520
that compliance is certainly important and the foundation of the work that we do to ensure that

04:53:30.520 --> 04:53:34.840
there are appropriate services timely services and timely assessments for students with disabilities

04:53:35.480 --> 04:53:42.200
but however in 2014 OSAP shifted their focus from compliance to results to work with states

04:53:42.760 --> 04:53:49.240
to develop their systems to mirror the the fact that compliance is is one measure

04:53:49.240 --> 04:53:54.840
but really looking at results is is the direction that the state and the federal government will go

04:53:55.400 --> 04:54:04.120
The first of our compliance indicators are 4B, 9, and 10. These targets are set by OSAP

04:54:04.120 --> 04:54:08.760
not by the state of California or our community group and the followed the following indicators

04:54:08.760 --> 04:54:14.840
also comprise what we know are what are typically referred to as the disproportionality indicators.

04:54:15.560 --> 04:54:21.800
4B is rates of suspension and expulsion by race race and ethnicity. That target is set at zero as

04:54:21.800 --> 04:54:28.520
are all the other compliance targets that are set by OSAP as well and so this target measures the

04:54:28.520 --> 04:54:35.080
percentage of LEAs that have a significant discrepancy in by race or ethnicity and the rate

04:54:35.080 --> 04:54:40.600
of suspension expulsion is greater than 10 days and the rate of suspension expulsion is greater

04:54:41.320 --> 04:54:48.920
than 10 days in a school year and also include policies and practices and procedures that

04:54:48.920 --> 04:54:55.160
contribute to that discrepancy as well. The second of those is what we call disproportionate

04:54:55.160 --> 04:55:01.800
representation. This compliance indicator also set at zero measures the percent of LEAs that have

04:55:01.800 --> 04:55:06.280
disproportionate representation of racial ethnic groups in special education related services.

04:55:07.240 --> 04:55:14.200
The third compliance indicator is what we refer to as indicator 10 which is again

04:55:14.200 --> 04:55:20.120
disproportionate representation in race and ethnic groups in specific disability categories.

04:55:22.440 --> 04:55:31.240
Indicators 12, 13, and 14 are also considered compliance indicators and those targets are set

04:55:31.240 --> 04:55:37.800
at 100 percent. Child fund comprises indicator 11 ensuring that students

04:55:37.800 --> 04:55:44.360
have an appropriate evaluation within 60 days of receiving parental consent for that initial

04:55:44.360 --> 04:55:52.120
evaluation to be conducted. Early childhood transition in terms of part receiving students

04:55:52.120 --> 04:55:59.560
receiving part C transitioning to part B services and those who are found eligible prior to age three

04:56:00.520 --> 04:56:03.480
must have an IEP developed and implemented by their third birthday.

04:56:04.600 --> 04:56:10.600
The third compliance indicator comprising this group is secondary transition and again this

04:56:10.600 --> 04:56:14.760
compliance indicator measures the percent of students with disabilities ages 16 and above

04:56:14.760 --> 04:56:19.720
with an IEP that includes measurable post-secondary goals. It's important to note that the age of

04:56:19.720 --> 04:56:27.560
transition in California is the age of 16 which is the federal sort of bar that is set though

04:56:27.560 --> 04:56:34.040
many states often choose grades lower than 16 but California currently at 16 a student must

04:56:34.040 --> 04:56:37.320
have a transition plan with appropriate goals in their IEP.

04:56:39.960 --> 04:56:46.120
As we move on to the performance indicators we know that a healthy start to education begins

04:56:46.120 --> 04:56:53.160
before birth. We know it starts with high quality prenatal care early learning experience experiences

04:56:53.160 --> 04:56:58.600
that develop the whole child that really set up young learners for success. We know that timely

04:56:58.600 --> 04:57:04.120
assessment is critical for students suspected of having a disability so that interventions

04:57:04.120 --> 04:57:08.600
can be provided at an early age to mitigate the impact of the identified disability.

04:57:10.200 --> 04:57:15.640
Second to that is timely assessment accurate assessments performed by qualified staff

04:57:15.640 --> 04:57:20.040
and conducted in a collaborative manner lead to identification of the right supports

04:57:20.040 --> 04:57:24.840
for students so that instruction can be aligned to the goals set forth within the student's IEP.

04:57:26.520 --> 04:57:32.200
Moving along on our road in terms of the pathway of success is notated in the in the indicators.

04:57:33.160 --> 04:57:38.520
Ensuring the appropriate supports and services are provided in the right setting also ensures

04:57:38.520 --> 04:57:44.200
access to the general education curriculum most appropriate to student need in order to maximize

04:57:44.200 --> 04:57:50.840
impact. LRE or least restrictive environment is more than just a description of the supports and

04:57:50.840 --> 04:57:55.800
services that often encompasses a belief and a mindset about students with disabilities.

04:57:56.520 --> 04:58:02.520
While a continuum exists for a reason it's critical that IEP teams discuss ways to support

04:58:02.520 --> 04:58:05.240
challenge and foster growth and independence for our students.

04:58:05.800 --> 04:58:11.080
Moving along on our roadway or highway the right evaluation and setting ensures that students are

04:58:11.080 --> 04:58:17.160
also supported from a social emotional standpoint including behavioral needs. Too often students

04:58:17.160 --> 04:58:24.200
that are receiving the right types of supports can be can become disengaged which often result

04:58:24.200 --> 04:58:29.320
in being placed in more restrictive settings or disproportionately being disciplined and or

04:58:29.320 --> 04:58:34.840
suspended which includes then of course missing instructional valuable instructional moments in

04:58:34.840 --> 04:58:41.640
the classroom setting. Statewide assessments play a critical role on the road map as well

04:58:41.640 --> 04:58:47.880
ensuring the best possible result on assessments are the result of many of the other factors and

04:58:47.880 --> 04:58:55.080
indicators that you will see before you and so that some of it compromises or not compromises

04:58:55.800 --> 04:59:04.760
comprises the result of timely assessments, identification and the right provision of supports

04:59:04.760 --> 04:59:11.800
to students. As students prepare for the off-ramp of education with graduation and the on-ramp

04:59:11.800 --> 04:59:17.480
towards independence, graduation plays a huge role in ensuring that students have full access

04:59:17.480 --> 04:59:22.520
to a post-secondary experience that is most appropriate for our students. After leaving

04:59:22.520 --> 04:59:27.800
the formal K-12 setting our goal is to ensure that students are able to meaningly participate

04:59:27.800 --> 04:59:33.160
in our communities. This means continued partnerships with our partners at the Department

04:59:33.160 --> 04:59:38.200
of Rehabilitation and others because whether students are seeking a college experience,

04:59:38.200 --> 04:59:43.160
a technical trade experience or an employment experience we must ensure that options exist

04:59:43.160 --> 04:59:47.880
that do not relegate our students to narrow pathways of what it means to be an adult with a

04:59:47.880 --> 04:59:54.200
disability. Starting with the first of our performance indicators we begin with our

04:59:54.200 --> 05:00:03.640
preschool indicators and they're comprised of six sub-indicators and so preschool LRE as we call it

05:00:04.360 --> 05:00:09.560
is essentially where a child ages three to five receives the majority of their special education

05:00:10.200 --> 05:00:17.000
supports and services. The notable changes that have been implemented by OSEP for this round

05:00:17.000 --> 05:00:22.760
of this cycle means that five-year-old kindergartners are excluded from the calculation

05:00:23.720 --> 05:00:31.400
and that there is a new sub-indicator 6C that measures home settings and services being

05:00:31.400 --> 05:00:43.640
provided in the home. Indicator 6A is essentially as stated before the percentage in which where

05:00:43.640 --> 05:00:48.120
students three through five are receiving the majority of their special education

05:00:48.760 --> 05:00:55.000
supports and services in a regular early childhood program. So you see here before you and in your

05:00:55.000 --> 05:01:03.720
packet the performance on the old targets from 2013 with the top column in row indicating the

05:01:03.720 --> 05:01:11.000
new targets that have been set by our community and our community engagement. California would

05:01:11.000 --> 05:01:18.360
like to see better growth in this indicator with no universal pre-k. This is a challenge that

05:01:18.360 --> 05:01:24.280
California is trying to address. The national mean for this indicator in particular is about 50%

05:01:25.560 --> 05:01:32.040
and we are performing way below but we have set our targets closer in the coming years to get

05:01:32.040 --> 05:01:37.400
closer to that result. As a comparison to other sort of like states in terms of demographic and

05:01:37.400 --> 05:01:46.040
size to California, Texas's results indicate 26.7% and New York right at 42%.

05:01:50.280 --> 05:01:56.280
6B the other sub-indicator for preschool LRE is children with disabilities three through five in

05:01:56.280 --> 05:02:01.640
a separate special education class, separate school or residential facility and you see the

05:02:01.640 --> 05:02:06.360
targets here that California has not been meeting the indicator for the past few years

05:02:06.920 --> 05:02:13.080
and with fiscal supports and additional technical assistance CDE expects the result for this

05:02:13.080 --> 05:02:20.440
indicator to improve over time. The national mean for this indicator is 20% and again in other

05:02:20.440 --> 05:02:26.120
states comparison in terms of Texas and New York, Texas is right at 26%, New York is right at 23%.

05:02:29.480 --> 05:02:34.200
The last which is the new indicator that I mentioned before is a percentage of students

05:02:34.200 --> 05:02:41.000
three to five receiving special education services in the home. The guidance obviously is

05:02:41.000 --> 05:02:47.720
that this target in the indicator is supposed to decrease. It's important to note that our

05:02:47.720 --> 05:02:53.160
community members that engaged around this target setting activity felt very strongly that this

05:02:53.160 --> 05:02:58.280
indicator should that parents should not be discouraged from having their children receive

05:02:58.280 --> 05:03:04.600
services in the home and that LEAs should not be disincentivized for providing this option.

05:03:05.320 --> 05:03:08.040
Our community believed that the target should stay stagnant

05:03:08.040 --> 05:03:11.880
with the 0.1% drop in the last year to meet the OCEF requirement.

05:03:21.320 --> 05:03:27.800
The next indicator is indicator seven which is centering preschool assessment. The assessment

05:03:27.800 --> 05:03:34.760
indicators measure preschool assessment across several indicator areas and so you will see a

05:03:34.760 --> 05:03:44.920
7A, 7B and a 7C. 7A essentially measures the social emotional progress for our students

05:03:45.640 --> 05:03:54.920
with disabilities. 7A, I'll just actually go through the table now, shows that

05:03:55.880 --> 05:04:03.880
the of those children entering into preschool program below age expectation in each outcome

05:04:03.880 --> 05:04:09.000
the present who substantially increased their rate of growth by the time they turned six or exited

05:04:09.000 --> 05:04:17.560
the program. The 7A2 that you see below 7A1 is the percentage of children who are functioning

05:04:17.560 --> 05:04:22.040
with age expectations in each outcome by the time they turn six or exited the program.

05:04:25.880 --> 05:04:34.760
And again we have varied results over the years in terms of this indicator. 7B measures the

05:04:36.360 --> 05:04:41.400
percent of children with disabilities who demonstrate improvement in essentially learning

05:04:41.400 --> 05:04:49.080
communication and literacy and so looking at these targets and the previous target performance

05:04:50.040 --> 05:04:58.200
summary 7B1 which you see in the first row and column indicates the children who entered preschool

05:04:58.200 --> 05:05:03.080
below age expectations in each outcome and the percent who substantially increased their rate

05:05:03.080 --> 05:05:09.800
of growth by the time they turn six. And 2, 7B2 is the percent of children who are functioning

05:05:09.800 --> 05:05:15.240
within age expectations in each outcome by the time they turn six or exited the program again.

05:05:15.320 --> 05:05:24.840
And again you see mixed results in this indicator and 7C is really centers behavior for students

05:05:24.840 --> 05:05:30.040
with disabilities and so the improvement in the use and appropriate behavior is really to meet

05:05:30.040 --> 05:05:39.240
their needs and so again statement one entering and below the age expectations and then who

05:05:39.240 --> 05:05:43.800
substantially increased their rate of growth and then the summary statement two which is the same

05:05:43.800 --> 05:05:48.600
across all who are functioning with age expectations in each outcome by the time they turn six or

05:05:48.600 --> 05:05:56.680
exited the program as well. That takes care of our preschool indicators moving along on our road map

05:05:57.320 --> 05:06:04.520
that you saw earlier centering students assessments for school age students.

05:06:05.240 --> 05:06:11.960
This indicator saw the most significant changes at the federal level hence why states are now

05:06:11.960 --> 05:06:17.720
pivoting to really begin a substantial or substantive discussion on this indicator as well.

05:06:18.680 --> 05:06:26.520
Focusing on these three grade levels grade four, grade eight, and grade 11 will provide the

05:06:26.520 --> 05:06:33.320
following advantages that should be seen and felt in the state of California. One it mitigates

05:06:33.320 --> 05:06:39.160
prevents the masking of high performance low performance or no improvement or improvement

05:06:39.160 --> 05:06:44.200
that would occur if all grades were combined to generate an average. It focuses on the effectiveness

05:06:44.200 --> 05:06:51.400
effectiveness of early elementary education or instruction i.e. K-3 literacy programs which

05:06:51.400 --> 05:06:56.360
is a critical time in literacy development and then also focuses on a successful transition to high

05:06:56.360 --> 05:07:04.040
school from middle to junior high school to high school and then also continues to focus on high

05:07:04.040 --> 05:07:07.720
school with the post-secondary outcomes of students transitioning into adult life.

05:07:08.680 --> 05:07:13.880
It's important to note that the dashboard assessment rate is different than this assessment

05:07:13.880 --> 05:07:19.960
calculation here and so the dashboard combines the smarter balanced summative assessments

05:07:19.960 --> 05:07:24.040
and the California alternative assessments for grade three through eight and 11 to determine

05:07:24.840 --> 05:07:29.000
performance and the opposite here where student groups are broken out.

05:07:29.000 --> 05:07:39.320
So staying with indicator three wanted to provide a few or a couple slides in terms of just the

05:07:39.320 --> 05:07:46.120
performance and talk about the achievement gap of students with disabilities. This data was pre-COVID

05:07:46.120 --> 05:07:54.280
in 2018 to 2019. The blue bar that you see to the left indicates the proficiency level for students

05:07:54.360 --> 05:08:01.640
with disabilities and the percentage of students who tested proficient compared to all students.

05:08:03.640 --> 05:08:08.920
This chart really meant to show the visually the physical gap between proficiency levels

05:08:08.920 --> 05:08:16.760
and students with disabilities for all students. Moving into the sub-indicators of 3A.

05:08:17.720 --> 05:08:24.040
3A measures the participation rate and it's quite simple as is that did the child sit

05:08:24.040 --> 05:08:29.640
and take the assessment and it's important to note why this indicator is important and why we

05:08:29.640 --> 05:08:33.400
still measure it at the state level because historically students with disabilities were

05:08:33.400 --> 05:08:39.080
excluded and not given opportunities to to take or access statewide assessments. So it's important

05:08:39.080 --> 05:08:45.640
to ensure that our students have equal access to take the assessments to learn more about their

05:08:45.720 --> 05:08:51.080
growth moving forward so that we can continue to provide improved supports and services to them as

05:08:51.080 --> 05:09:00.680
well. In terms of our participation performance you will see here that again broken out the grades

05:09:00.680 --> 05:09:10.680
four eight and eleven that we our our targets were at 95 previously and our targets will continue to

05:09:10.680 --> 05:09:18.280
be 95 moving forward as well and to keep in line 95 was chosen to keep in in line with the

05:09:18.280 --> 05:09:26.360
recommendation that with the by the ESSA and the CDE is maintaining the the targets at 95 percent.

05:09:29.640 --> 05:09:35.000
Indicator 3B discusses the proficiency level against the grade level standards.

05:09:35.960 --> 05:09:42.280
3B measures the rate for children against the grade level standards again calculated separately

05:09:42.280 --> 05:09:49.560
in ages four eight and eleven and as you can see by these target charts the proficiency has

05:09:49.560 --> 05:09:55.560
been grouped by LEA type and while some of these targets are low particularly in grade eight and

05:09:55.560 --> 05:10:01.720
eleven the benefit of setting targets by grade is it enables CDE to see where to focus our resources

05:10:02.680 --> 05:10:07.720
lower than what we had before. We recalculated the prior years with a new calculation

05:10:08.440 --> 05:10:12.440
in the grade eight and eleven were lower performing so again it allows an LEA

05:10:13.720 --> 05:10:18.280
you know to to see where they might be able to focus their resources a little bit with a little

05:10:18.280 --> 05:10:25.000
bit more intention and a little more specificity as well. Previously the old targets were clumped

05:10:25.000 --> 05:10:30.440
together by district and again it's you know much more beneficial to

05:10:31.160 --> 05:10:36.680
really look at these grade bands to provide additional opportunities for growth and learning.

05:10:41.160 --> 05:10:47.560
Indicator 3C again measures the proficiency in terms of the California alternate assessment

05:10:48.680 --> 05:10:53.160
and again we're referencing a group of students that have the most significant

05:10:53.160 --> 05:10:59.240
disabilities and are unable to take the traditional standard statewide assessment

05:11:00.040 --> 05:11:05.400
and typically in California that number hovers near one percent as it does nationally at the

05:11:05.400 --> 05:11:12.440
national level and this is new again because the APR previously combined the grade level and

05:11:12.440 --> 05:11:18.120
alternate standards assessment and again we have a grade breakout which again mitigates the high

05:11:18.120 --> 05:11:22.440
low performance and also provides I think real-time information for the state and the

05:11:22.440 --> 05:11:34.440
LEA to to respond and react to. And as you can see by these target charts the proficiency

05:11:34.440 --> 05:11:42.920
again has been grouped by LEA type and again the the targets were set by the community groups

05:11:43.560 --> 05:11:48.040
and then used by recalculating data from prior years as well.

05:11:52.680 --> 05:12:01.720
3D, proficiency gap rates. This does not include data for the students that take the California

05:12:01.720 --> 05:12:07.080
alternative assessment but 3D measures the proficiency rates for students against those

05:12:07.080 --> 05:12:12.920
grade level academic achievement standards as well and the gap that remains in between.

05:12:12.920 --> 05:12:20.440
So this visual is meant to you know visually represent the achievement gap in that indicator

05:12:20.440 --> 05:12:27.960
that goes along with 3D. Each chart is what the gap is for that year so how the data will be

05:12:27.960 --> 05:12:33.800
represented in the future obviously is that we want the gap to close as you see and take a look

05:12:33.800 --> 05:12:40.520
from the right to the left and grade grades four grades eight and grades 11 in terms of the gap

05:12:40.520 --> 05:12:45.320
of the proficiency gap for students with disabilities. We still have much work to do

05:12:45.320 --> 05:12:52.840
to ensure that our students are decreasing over time and that we are sure that

05:12:53.480 --> 05:12:56.200
you know students are receiving the right supports and services as well.

05:13:04.120 --> 05:13:07.720
And again this is an entirely new indicator for the state of California

05:13:09.880 --> 05:13:13.240
and so our targets are set as such.

05:13:18.440 --> 05:13:26.680
Indicator four suspension expulsion measures the rate of suspension expulsion. Again there were no

05:13:26.680 --> 05:13:33.240
notable changes however it is important to note two things. One the way this calculated is is

05:13:33.240 --> 05:13:39.320
different than the dashboard calculation and that this data is lag year data which means it's one

05:13:39.320 --> 05:13:47.960
year behind in terms of reporting. In terms of the difference between the dashboard and special

05:13:47.960 --> 05:13:55.080
education the year this indicator four measures the percentage of LEAs that have a significant

05:13:55.080 --> 05:13:59.720
discrepancy in the rate of suspension expulsions it's greater than 10 days and the dashboard

05:13:59.720 --> 05:14:03.320
captures the numbers of students suspended for the aggregate of a total of one day.

05:14:22.200 --> 05:14:28.920
And then moving on to indicator five indicator five is is what we call our LRE

05:14:28.920 --> 05:14:37.480
our least restrictive environment indicator. Again this is measuring sort of how and where

05:14:37.480 --> 05:14:43.080
the students are receiving their supports in you know in terms of accessing the general education

05:14:43.080 --> 05:14:50.680
curriculum. To put a perspective in moving the needle and changing this indicator to see a one

05:14:50.680 --> 05:14:57.400
percent change in this indicator would nearly be the equivalent of moving the needle for seven

05:14:57.400 --> 05:15:05.480
thousand students. This is traditionally is a very slow growing indicator nationally the average

05:15:05.480 --> 05:15:17.320
rate of change at the national level is 0.21 percent in 5a as well. So LRE is slow growing

05:15:17.320 --> 05:15:25.480
for a variety of reasons as it calls in philosophies beliefs mindsets programming it touches on teacher

05:15:25.480 --> 05:15:30.440
shortage it touches on all the sort of considerations that we mapped or talked about before.

05:15:31.640 --> 05:15:38.360
And so again you know I think that while California and you see here the current

05:15:38.360 --> 05:15:42.600
placement of students with disabilities you see that you know we are

05:15:45.800 --> 05:15:51.480
here in terms of students receiving their their performance or they're receiving their education

05:15:52.120 --> 05:15:58.760
in the general education classroom with 80 percent or more of the day you see our performance targets

05:15:59.720 --> 05:16:02.600
here previously and then the new targets

05:16:04.920 --> 05:16:11.880
for the coming years. While we have met our targets California lags behind other states

05:16:11.880 --> 05:16:17.800
in this indicator. We have seen consistent growth over the past six years but we would like to see

05:16:17.800 --> 05:16:23.080
increased numbers for this indicator over time which is reflected in the targets. The national

05:16:23.080 --> 05:16:33.080
mean for this same time period is 65 percent and we're getting closer but we're not yet there.

05:16:33.800 --> 05:16:40.200
Other states in the comparison again Texas and New York Texas 71 percent New York 58 percent.

05:16:40.200 --> 05:16:48.200
The other sub indicator 5b measures the students that are served in a regular class less than 40

05:16:48.200 --> 05:16:57.160
percent of the day. California has been meeting the targets for this indicator and has seen a

05:16:57.160 --> 05:17:02.760
steady decline over the past seven years and so with additional TA and supports California can

05:17:02.760 --> 05:17:07.560
make progress in this area. The national mean for this indicator hovers around 11 percent

05:17:08.200 --> 05:17:13.000
and we've set our targets closer to get us to that number. A comparison of Texas and New York

05:17:13.560 --> 05:17:20.360
New York is at 19 and Texas is at 14. It's important to note that this sort of band of

05:17:21.640 --> 05:17:27.720
supports and services that students receive oftentimes includes students that sometimes

05:17:28.680 --> 05:17:34.120
are close to progressing to being educated in lesser restrictive environments in the in the

05:17:34.120 --> 05:17:40.200
next sort of category or 5a category moving forward. So there's a very I think sort of

05:17:40.200 --> 05:17:47.160
strategic conversation that should happen regarding within LRE in terms of how we're supporting our

05:17:47.160 --> 05:17:52.040
students is sort of each sort of band of the way and this group here I think is critical to

05:17:52.040 --> 05:18:02.280
part of that discussion. Indicator 5c is the percentage of students that are placed in a

05:18:02.280 --> 05:18:08.680
completely separate environment that would be a separate school that could be a separate facility

05:18:08.680 --> 05:18:15.400
that could be homebound or a hospital setting. Like the rest of the syndicator 5a and 5b

05:18:15.400 --> 05:18:19.800
California has seen a steady decrease and has been consistently meeting the target every year.

05:18:20.600 --> 05:18:26.200
The national mean is 2.8 percent and California is is seeing some progress but we'd like for

05:18:26.200 --> 05:18:36.440
this indicator to continue to improve as well. That takes care of it for our LRE indicators.

05:18:37.000 --> 05:18:41.160
Next we move into graduation and we are winding down our indicator tour.

05:18:42.600 --> 05:18:50.680
Indicator 1 is a graduation indicator and the one change is that the OSEP is requiring that

05:18:50.680 --> 05:18:58.920
states use a one-year calculation not a four-year adjusted cohort rate. This graduation indicator

05:18:58.920 --> 05:19:06.600
is different than the dashboard graduation indicator calculation and again this is lag year data as well.

05:19:06.760 --> 05:19:17.480
Our data from 2015 to 2016 is a is is a little looks a little interesting. I should just say it

05:19:17.480 --> 05:19:26.440
that way but the again this is lag year data. This is calculated from exit data and the one-year

05:19:26.440 --> 05:19:30.600
calculation could make the results from graduation subject to more volatility.

05:19:30.680 --> 05:19:39.880
We may see more ups and downs as well.

05:19:46.600 --> 05:19:53.240
14 post-school outcomes so here we come at the end of the road of the road map and so

05:19:53.240 --> 05:19:58.520
it's important to note in terms of whether students are enrolled in higher education

05:19:58.520 --> 05:20:04.040
employed or enrolled in other post-secondary education within one year there was no change

05:20:05.160 --> 05:20:11.320
and so there are there's a small change that actually I think will produce I think big results

05:20:11.320 --> 05:20:16.520
and interesting conversation to follow is that states now must choose to get two categories to

05:20:17.320 --> 05:20:23.800
measure the representative of respondents to the survey. Critical to this conversation is CDE will

05:20:23.800 --> 05:20:29.560
use not only disability category in terms of the survey but also collect race and ethnicity data

05:20:29.560 --> 05:20:36.280
and I think it's really important for us to in order to address our continual issues of equity

05:20:36.280 --> 05:20:42.600
within special education to ensure you know that students that fall within various race race and

05:20:42.600 --> 05:20:48.040
ethnicity categories are represented in the survey so that we see if they're enrolled in higher ed

05:20:48.040 --> 05:20:52.760
if they're employed or enrolled in other some sort of sort of post-secondary education within

05:20:52.760 --> 05:21:06.440
that one year window. 14a again is another sub indicator role and students enrolled in higher

05:21:06.440 --> 05:21:12.760
education within the one year and we see our targets here that we do see increased growth

05:21:12.760 --> 05:21:22.520
over time for these students. 14b is students are students that are educated in higher ed

05:21:22.520 --> 05:21:29.400
or competitively employed within the one year and here we see the results again we continue to see

05:21:29.400 --> 05:21:38.360
steady growth we'd like to see continued growth in the future and 14c measures the the percent of

05:21:38.360 --> 05:21:43.800
youth no longer in secondary school and are enrolled in some sort of education or training

05:21:43.800 --> 05:21:52.760
program or competitively employed. And again here we do see an increase we'd like to see that

05:21:52.760 --> 05:22:01.880
increase over time as well. Last but not least is our combo indicator which is the

05:22:01.880 --> 05:22:07.560
our state systemic improvement plan or ESSEP as we call it. It is a combination of performance

05:22:07.720 --> 05:22:14.520
and compliance. The ESSEP was developed in phases and was evolved to align with our

05:22:14.520 --> 05:22:20.760
statewide accountability system and statewide system of support. And again the goal is to

05:22:20.760 --> 05:22:25.960
obviously achieve coherence and alignment across our systems in order to better meet the needs

05:22:25.960 --> 05:22:33.640
of our students. Our theory of action for our ESSEP as we call it is our sort of state identified

05:22:34.440 --> 05:22:41.960
measurable result you know is looking at the performance of all students with disabilities

05:22:41.960 --> 05:22:46.840
who took the California assessment of student performance and progress in both ELA and math.

05:22:47.640 --> 05:22:53.640
And so our ESSEP is focused on creating systemic and sustainable change including the necessary

05:22:53.640 --> 05:23:01.480
alignment as well. Prior to 2016 as we look for continual efforts to align

05:23:02.440 --> 05:23:05.960
accountability systems between general education and special education

05:23:07.320 --> 05:23:13.720
the accountability system was largely separate. The inclusion of students with disabilities in

05:23:13.720 --> 05:23:18.920
the dashboard including DA and the statewide system of support has really I think for us

05:23:18.920 --> 05:23:24.120
elevated some of the the gaps that we need to address in terms of improving the outcomes not

05:23:24.120 --> 05:23:31.000
only for all of our students but also students with disabilities as well. The SPP and APR

05:23:31.080 --> 05:23:37.960
is part of the general supervision system. It's a requirement of our federal government as well.

05:23:39.320 --> 05:23:48.040
The you know the shift to compliance to results you know is important and I think it's an

05:23:48.040 --> 05:23:54.920
improvement to ensure that our approaches remain structurally sound and really

05:23:54.920 --> 05:24:01.160
rooted and integrated into our local state and federal accountability measures.

05:24:05.960 --> 05:24:10.600
And again discussing some of the alignment activities between our accountability systems

05:24:10.600 --> 05:24:17.160
for students with disabilities is we've invested 10 million dollars per year through our SELPA

05:24:17.160 --> 05:24:23.080
LEAD and our SELPA LEAD grants. We have moved from a separate system from CASEMAS to CALPATS

05:24:23.880 --> 05:24:29.160
and then we use in the special education department our dashboard data to select LEAs

05:24:30.280 --> 05:24:35.560
to ensure alignment. In terms of our state systemic improvement plan and our targets

05:24:37.800 --> 05:24:44.840
there's some notable changes here but OSIP only allows one target for the ESSEP

05:24:45.640 --> 05:24:51.640
and so our community group that gave input into our targets indicated and agreed

05:24:52.200 --> 05:24:58.200
to keep the targets similar to our 3B math and ELA targets on the same trajectory.

05:25:04.200 --> 05:25:13.320
In terms of next steps in where we go over the next six years really I think you know in terms

05:25:13.320 --> 05:25:22.280
of our efforts starts and ends at the classroom level. Everything that we do from the state,

05:25:22.280 --> 05:25:34.200
county, LEA, to the school, SELPA really rolls upwards and down and back and forth

05:25:34.920 --> 05:25:41.640
in terms of ensuring that our efforts, our system of support, our state funded technical assistance,

05:25:42.520 --> 05:25:47.800
the IDEA funded technical assistance that we receive along with our legislative investments

05:25:47.800 --> 05:25:53.240
that you will hear about in just a moment are aligned and focused on our students with

05:25:53.240 --> 05:25:59.240
disabilities as well. So our SELPA LEAD contents focus on getting training into the classroom,

05:25:59.240 --> 05:26:07.240
into the teachers. Our Golden State teacher grants around 486 were awarded last year totaling 7.5

05:26:07.240 --> 05:26:11.960
million. We have our supporting inclusive practices project which again promotes and

05:26:11.960 --> 05:26:20.120
fosters inclusive environments for our students and then obviously MTSS, our MTSS system ensuring

05:26:20.120 --> 05:26:25.320
that both the academic and social emotional needs of our students are met and supported

05:26:25.320 --> 05:26:32.120
from early identification. In terms of the pathway forward you see another road map in front of you

05:26:32.760 --> 05:26:38.600
with some key levers I think that we think are sort of the cornerstone of change.

05:26:40.920 --> 05:26:48.040
LRE being one of them as you see increasing you know inclusive practices at the pre-k level

05:26:49.560 --> 05:26:53.720
including universal pre-k with dedicated slots for students with disabilities.

05:26:55.000 --> 05:26:58.280
Addressing some of the teacher shortages and credentialing issues

05:26:59.080 --> 05:27:05.560
ensuring that we have teaching staff that is appropriate credentialed high quality in the

05:27:05.560 --> 05:27:14.440
classroom. In addition to ensuring that there is effective communication between community and

05:27:14.440 --> 05:27:23.000
school and also addressing equity and disproportionality as we know that many of our students are excluded

05:27:23.480 --> 05:27:29.720
or suspended are students of color with located within special education and so focusing on

05:27:30.520 --> 05:27:34.040
addressing some of those impacts to the system along with some of the other

05:27:35.320 --> 05:27:41.480
measures here will provide I think a solid road map moving forward. Some of the investments that

05:27:41.480 --> 05:27:48.760
you see on the right hand side are the vehicles to move this work. You will see 260 million of

05:27:48.760 --> 05:27:54.280
early intervention special education funding. We've got 500 million in the golden state teacher

05:27:54.280 --> 05:28:02.680
grants 350 million in the residencies 125 million in the classified school and employee teacher

05:28:03.640 --> 05:28:09.800
teacher credentialing program. 450 million in the special education learning recovery grants

05:28:09.800 --> 05:28:17.640
which provides opportunities for LEAs to ensure that the impact of COVID is mitigated and students

05:28:17.640 --> 05:28:23.560
are receiving and progressing and growing as they return to in-person instruction.

05:28:24.200 --> 05:28:30.440
There's 100 million in alternative dispute resolution grants which is meant to provide

05:28:30.440 --> 05:28:36.280
additional opportunities to solve and resolve issues at the IEP table versus progressing through

05:28:38.760 --> 05:28:45.160
more serious sort of progression in terms of resolving disputes and then a notable

05:28:45.160 --> 05:28:50.200
increase to our supporting inclusive practices which will allow to expand SIPP's reach

05:28:50.200 --> 05:28:56.120
throughout the state almost doubling the amount of grantees that they will be able to work with

05:28:56.120 --> 05:29:01.480
to improve support and improve inclusion across the state as well.

05:29:04.440 --> 05:29:08.360
That concludes today's presentation and a tour through our indicators.

05:29:08.360 --> 05:29:12.920
Thank you very much and happy to take questions at this time.

05:29:15.640 --> 05:29:23.560
Thank you. Oh wow what a very very comprehensive tour. We really appreciate it and we'll start by

05:29:23.560 --> 05:29:29.800
getting folks queued up for public comment. The members of the public who are wishing to

05:29:29.800 --> 05:29:35.320
provide comment on this item can do so by calling the telephone number listed on this

05:29:35.320 --> 05:29:41.080
slide and using the participant access code. While we're waiting for members of the public

05:29:41.080 --> 05:29:45.240
to call in I want to ask Vice President Strauss if she has any initial comments.

05:29:45.960 --> 05:29:51.800
Then we'll take any clarifying questions public comment and come back for discussion. Thank you.

05:29:54.280 --> 05:30:03.000
So Heather I just want to thank you for a really clear presentation on a lot of indicators and I

05:30:03.000 --> 05:30:10.920
think what I want to say is this really gives us a big picture of the many many complexities

05:30:11.480 --> 05:30:18.760
that special needs students that we have to consider for them what school districts need

05:30:18.760 --> 05:30:24.600
to take into account and I appreciated earlier in the presentation the conditions that you

05:30:25.400 --> 05:30:32.040
discussed which really impact our ability to meet some of these goals. So my understanding is this

05:30:32.040 --> 05:30:38.840
is comprehensive and it's required at the federal level but as you said it is guidance for us that

05:30:38.840 --> 05:30:44.360
can actually help guide our work forward to improve practices for students. I just think we

05:30:44.360 --> 05:30:48.760
have to remember that we're focusing on an inclusive environment which wasn't the way it

05:30:48.760 --> 05:30:55.960
always was and you said that I think actually as of 2016 so this is a big change both in teacher

05:30:55.960 --> 05:31:02.440
skillsets and strategies and the issue of capacity building for teachers at a time when

05:31:02.440 --> 05:31:08.200
we have a huge shortage of teachers particularly in the area of special education. I appreciated

05:31:08.200 --> 05:31:13.080
all the investments that you had toward the end of the presentation and the commitment by the

05:31:13.080 --> 05:31:18.360
governor and the legislature to really dedicate but putting the money there we still have to get

05:31:18.360 --> 05:31:24.600
the staff and the support to do the work. The other thing I would say is that as we look at what the

05:31:24.600 --> 05:31:31.240
needs are this document is sort of the top down and then changes the bottom up. It's sort of how

05:31:31.240 --> 05:31:37.400
do you get the pressure to pay attention to these issues and then build the capacity and I appreciated

05:31:37.400 --> 05:31:44.280
the second to the last slide which showed how the system of support is connected and I actually would

05:31:44.280 --> 05:31:50.760
like a little bit more enhancement on the on the role of the CELPA leads because as you said it's

05:31:50.760 --> 05:31:57.320
a very siloed system and these are our students who need so much support in a variety of ways

05:31:57.880 --> 05:32:03.800
and how we actually move to build capacity and get the system. I would say when you listed the

05:32:03.800 --> 05:32:10.760
numbers of LEAs who qualify for assistance in a variety of areas I would say most districts

05:32:10.760 --> 05:32:17.960
identify the need to support special needs students. So with the goal of coherence and alignment

05:32:17.960 --> 05:32:22.040
if you did all these goals you would never make progress you really have to help

05:32:22.040 --> 05:32:27.480
districts stay focused to make some progress toward their goals. So I'm interested just as

05:32:27.480 --> 05:32:34.280
the state lead on this how you see the system of support and the CELPA leads guiding it and then

05:32:34.280 --> 05:32:41.000
I'll turn it over for any clarifying questions to more members before we go to the public comment.

05:32:41.720 --> 05:32:49.800
Thank you. Sure thank you Vice Chair Strauss. In terms of the the CELPA improvement leads that

05:32:49.800 --> 05:32:58.680
you that you mentioned the the our CELPA leads are tasked with with ensuring that the the data

05:32:58.680 --> 05:33:04.360
use and data governance they're focusing on continuous improvement also the implementation

05:33:04.360 --> 05:33:10.520
of high level practices are instituted implemented across across the state as well.

05:33:11.720 --> 05:33:17.480
The the the work that they do is is foundational and critical along with our content leads

05:33:18.120 --> 05:33:24.040
to ensure that we are addressing a multifaceted group of students as students with disabilities

05:33:24.040 --> 05:33:30.440
and empowering our teachers and educational staff across the state to ensure that they are equipped

05:33:30.440 --> 05:33:36.120
and resourced to address teaching and learning the way it looks now and moving forward as well

05:33:36.120 --> 05:33:43.160
and you know the shift that happened during the the COVID-19 pandemic amongst our leads and amongst

05:33:43.160 --> 05:33:49.640
our content leads is is monumental taking many in-person trainings taking them online having

05:33:49.640 --> 05:33:57.240
maximum capacity and maximum reach and so you know we are pleased to continue the work with our

05:33:57.240 --> 05:34:05.000
with our improvement leads but we are also increasingly excited to begin to sort of take

05:34:05.000 --> 05:34:10.920
that what what is could be considered or somewhat feels like a silo system in our state system of

05:34:10.920 --> 05:34:16.120
support and also look for those alignment opportunities within our larger statewide

05:34:16.120 --> 05:34:20.440
system of support as well as we know again our students with disabilities are not separate and

05:34:20.440 --> 05:34:25.400
siloed in in terms of their educational experience so all the sort of mechanisms and arms that we

05:34:25.400 --> 05:34:31.320
have across the state should be operating in coordination and includes our self-improvement

05:34:31.320 --> 05:34:36.600
leads and our content leads and so we're looking forward to you know taking some time out and

05:34:36.600 --> 05:34:41.800
carving some time out in terms of discussion about how sort of this sort of subset or specialized

05:34:41.800 --> 05:34:47.640
subset of of system of support it fits into the larger system you know for the for the benefit

05:34:47.640 --> 05:34:55.880
of all students that's great uh i don't see any other hands raised for clarifying questions at

05:34:55.880 --> 05:35:01.480
this moment so we will go to public comment and then we'll come back for discussion

05:35:04.200 --> 05:35:06.360
all right we have several public commenters

05:35:11.240 --> 05:35:15.800
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

05:35:15.800 --> 05:35:17.080
your time begins now

05:35:21.800 --> 05:35:26.920
good afternoon my name is cammy martin on behalf of the california county superintendent

05:35:26.920 --> 05:35:32.040
educational services association in general we believe the new targets are attainable

05:35:32.040 --> 05:35:37.480
set appropriate expectations and have captured much of the stakeholder feedback an area of concern

05:35:37.480 --> 05:35:43.240
we raise in our letter is the new targets for indicator 5a while we believe ambitious targets

05:35:43.240 --> 05:35:47.400
will encourage better placement and earlier intervention for students with disabilities

05:35:47.400 --> 05:35:52.680
health percent growth over six years may be unattainable the cde may want to examine the

05:35:52.680 --> 05:35:58.840
technical help to help provided to support lea's to improve policies and practices in this area

05:35:58.840 --> 05:36:02.360
thank you for your important work on this item thank you caller

05:36:08.120 --> 05:36:12.760
hello caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

05:36:12.760 --> 05:36:14.040
your time begins now

05:36:17.880 --> 05:36:25.240
good afternoon my name is deborah schlegel i'm a parent um i want to thank director calamities for

05:36:25.240 --> 05:36:31.640
the wonderful presentation uh of of the strategic plan um including

05:36:33.000 --> 05:36:38.840
where we have been in the past i think that is very important when uh delivering this type of

05:36:38.840 --> 05:36:47.880
information i just hope that going forward we can really concentrate on literacy for tk through

05:36:47.880 --> 05:36:56.200
three and consider targeted grants to improve teacher education in that area and consider

05:36:56.760 --> 05:37:04.120
aligning the data that we take in for ieps across all platforms including those needed

05:37:04.120 --> 05:37:11.080
for the l cap information iep information i think alignment of those data

05:37:13.080 --> 05:37:19.560
inputs would be very useful down to the lea level thank you thank you caller

05:37:22.360 --> 05:37:24.680
that concludes our public comment for this item

05:37:24.680 --> 05:37:32.600
um okay um so we're open for discussion both about the uh targets themselves and about the

05:37:35.400 --> 05:37:41.880
um thinking that goes behind where we're going uh maybe i will kick us off with a few uh comments

05:37:41.880 --> 05:37:50.040
and again kudos to heather for the presentation um you know my my favorite uh slide was your path

05:37:50.360 --> 05:37:56.200
you know my my favorite uh slide was your path forward for special education funding and policy

05:37:56.200 --> 05:38:02.200
that might get us to the targets i think that's so critically important i'm excited that we are

05:38:02.200 --> 05:38:09.320
where we are and thinking systemically about this with so many elements of policy uh coming online

05:38:09.320 --> 05:38:15.720
to help us you know really make a change in the in the outcomes for our students it was about five

05:38:15.720 --> 05:38:21.560
or six years ago that when mike kerst was the chair of the state board and i was chairing the

05:38:21.560 --> 05:38:27.320
commission on teacher credentialing that we joined forces to try to get resources for a special

05:38:27.320 --> 05:38:32.520
education task force and some of you will remember that that task force really came out with a

05:38:33.640 --> 05:38:40.360
set of proposals for how do we get to one system from what had been you know a dual very segregated

05:38:40.360 --> 05:38:46.520
system um that was not making progress you know going forward and it began to identify

05:38:46.520 --> 05:38:52.840
some of the needs and i think we're making progress every year on addressing more and more of those

05:38:52.840 --> 05:38:59.000
needs so it is exciting to see it coming together and to have the targets presented with you know

05:38:59.000 --> 05:39:07.400
something of a roadmap for how we could actually meet them i do want to flag as what our color

05:39:07.400 --> 05:39:15.240
flagged as well the challenges of target five a which is the target to get more and more students

05:39:15.240 --> 05:39:22.200
in mainstream classrooms we all want that to be accomplished in a way that supports

05:39:23.640 --> 05:39:29.720
teachers in those classrooms with the knowledge skills and supports that they will need to serve

05:39:29.720 --> 05:39:36.920
the kids well that supports the kids well with all of those um knowledge skills and supports and we

05:39:36.920 --> 05:39:43.080
know that we have particular challenges in that area we also know that when children are

05:39:43.800 --> 05:39:50.280
in mainstream settings without adequate support often some of the other dysfunctional consequences

05:39:50.280 --> 05:39:57.240
happen including exclusion suspension expulsion and so on so i think that's the place where

05:39:57.240 --> 05:40:06.600
we're going to have to dig in the most intensely on both ensuring that we end the teacher shortages

05:40:06.600 --> 05:40:13.320
that have played this state for so long you know with two-thirds of people coming into specialist

05:40:13.320 --> 05:40:20.600
positions being unprepared underprepared when they get there that means that kids have you know

05:40:20.600 --> 05:40:26.200
teachers who want to help them and don't know how those teachers that also need to be able to help

05:40:26.760 --> 05:40:32.440
the general ed teachers we're going to need a system in which we can authorize generalist

05:40:32.440 --> 05:40:38.600
teachers and special ed teachers to work together in teaching teams where they can both work with

05:40:38.600 --> 05:40:43.240
all the kids in the in the classroom with the knowledge bases that are needed there's credentialing

05:40:43.240 --> 05:40:50.200
reform underway at the ctc to help us get there but we don't have programs yet in the state in

05:40:50.200 --> 05:40:57.240
adequate numbers to train up all the people who will be needed to meet those those requirements

05:40:57.240 --> 05:41:03.880
and to be knowledgeable that's the key thing the most important thing that a student in special

05:41:03.880 --> 05:41:08.840
education needs is knowledgeable teaching everything else you know all the other things that get

05:41:09.880 --> 05:41:15.880
talked about in terms of services and so on all rest on whether we have people who have that very

05:41:15.880 --> 05:41:21.560
very extraordinary set of knowledge and skills and that we support those people we know that

05:41:22.120 --> 05:41:26.280
getting and keeping those folks is going to depend on the right kind of preparation

05:41:26.280 --> 05:41:30.520
right kind of support for them to be able to afford to be prepared the right kind of

05:41:30.520 --> 05:41:38.920
credentialing programs the right kind of student loads and working conditions that allow them to

05:41:38.920 --> 05:41:45.560
do their jobs well and it's also going to depend on the kind of training we can give to educators

05:41:45.560 --> 05:41:50.440
around social emotional learning and restorative practices because students with disabilities

05:41:51.160 --> 05:41:55.640
and african-american students followed by native american students are the

05:41:55.640 --> 05:42:02.120
ones that are most often to be excluded and there's a big overlap in african-american

05:42:02.120 --> 05:42:09.480
students and students with ieps in that circumstance so i just want to be sure that

05:42:09.480 --> 05:42:16.280
we have a really strong full complete picture of what we will need to do to achieve those targets

05:42:16.280 --> 05:42:21.800
in a way that really works for children so that they are well served in those classrooms

05:42:22.440 --> 05:42:27.800
by educators who have the knowledge skills and supports to serve them well and i would

05:42:27.800 --> 05:42:35.640
like to suggest that because so much of this is the interaction between cde's work in the field

05:42:35.640 --> 05:42:41.640
and the credentialing commission's work are getting the preparation programs and authorizations

05:42:42.120 --> 05:42:48.200
to line up that we might even want to consider inviting a joint presentation next time around

05:42:48.200 --> 05:42:53.880
that component because it is going to be one of the most important and challenging

05:42:54.440 --> 05:43:00.520
pieces of the work it's something we all want to lean into those goals and we want to lean into

05:43:00.520 --> 05:43:05.720
them in the right way that really works for for children and for for the educators who want to

05:43:05.720 --> 05:43:11.880
serve them and with that i will go to member rucker who has raised her hand and anyone else

05:43:11.880 --> 05:43:17.400
who wants to join in the discussion thank you so much and first of all i do want to say thank you

05:43:17.400 --> 05:43:23.000
to the department and the staff for this very comprehensive presentation i look forward to

05:43:23.000 --> 05:43:29.240
seeing the overview on this particular report every year and i always learn more not only about

05:43:29.240 --> 05:43:34.920
the challenge of providing appropriate support for special education programs to our district

05:43:34.920 --> 05:43:40.760
but really understanding what the instructional challenges are to meet those to meet the targets

05:43:40.760 --> 05:43:47.000
that are articulated here dr darling ham and thank you also for the suggestion about the joint

05:43:47.000 --> 05:43:52.200
presentation with the commission because that was something i was going to suggest but i also think

05:43:52.200 --> 05:43:59.160
that there's a need for us to talk about what is the level of the type of planning and the scope

05:43:59.160 --> 05:44:05.320
and depth of planning that has to happen at the school level to address these targets

05:44:06.120 --> 05:44:11.720
in my experience as a classroom teacher and working at a school campus discussion about

05:44:11.720 --> 05:44:18.600
special education programs and planning for those programs was often separate and segregated from

05:44:18.600 --> 05:44:24.040
planning for the jet for the general school program itself special education students are

05:44:24.040 --> 05:44:30.360
general ed students first and how are they reflected in the planning that we are now tasking

05:44:30.360 --> 05:44:38.920
school districts to do in the l cap regardless of whatever the form the l cap template takes

05:44:38.920 --> 05:44:46.120
how is the needs of these students as reflected in the expectations of these targets also being

05:44:46.120 --> 05:44:53.480
reflected in the l cap and i think that's also a worthy conversation to pursue because frankly

05:44:53.480 --> 05:44:58.360
in the meetings i've gone to in several board meetings and at several sites where i've listened

05:44:58.360 --> 05:45:04.680
in on their l cap discussions special education programs don't come up it's always a focus on the

05:45:04.680 --> 05:45:10.600
general education and we don't pay attention to these students but those outcomes are not only

05:45:10.600 --> 05:45:16.280
integral but they directly overlap on the accountability outcomes that are tied to the l cap as well

05:45:16.280 --> 05:45:23.560
so thank you are there other folks who want to weigh in

05:45:32.200 --> 05:45:38.600
this is an information item so we have been well informed and we really thank heather for that

05:45:38.600 --> 05:45:45.400
we've made a couple of suggestions for looking towards potentially towards the next meeting and

05:45:45.480 --> 05:45:54.200
towards our adoption of the of the targets and with that we are in a position to take a

05:45:54.840 --> 05:46:04.280
10 minute break and we will be almost caught up with our timing so good work and we'll see you

05:46:04.280 --> 05:46:11.800
in 10 minutes at three o'clock and continue from there remember to turn off your microphone and

05:48:16.040 --> 05:48:22.360
and recommendations regarding an appeal from uh uh an action of the riverside county committee

05:48:22.360 --> 05:48:28.920
to transfer territory from kochela valley unified to desert sands unified i want to put

05:48:29.320 --> 05:48:34.520
our recommendation up front we'll come back to this at the end but again we're as indicated

05:48:34.520 --> 05:48:38.840
we're recommending that the state board reverse the actions of the riverside county committee

05:48:38.840 --> 05:48:46.040
to approve the transfer although the transfer substantially meets all the standards in statute

05:48:46.040 --> 05:48:51.320
we determined that there's no compelling reason to transfer the territory but we do find a

05:48:51.400 --> 05:49:00.280
significant concern with with the uh with the issue the proposed transfer area is 124

05:49:00.280 --> 05:49:04.920
single-family homes located in the northwest corner of the kochela valley school district

05:49:07.160 --> 05:49:14.120
the petition began uh with uh or the proposal began with a petition signed by 25 of the voters

05:49:14.120 --> 05:49:21.960
in that area again in that in that red shaded area uh i'm this is the rationale that was in

05:49:21.960 --> 05:49:27.160
the petition provided by the petitioners i'm going to skip that slide in the interest of time

05:49:27.160 --> 05:49:33.400
because i'm going to come back to that information in a moment and i want first to start with just

05:49:33.400 --> 05:49:39.320
kind of a reminder of what is involved in approving a territory transfer it's a two-step

05:49:39.320 --> 05:49:44.680
process there is a legal requirement to determine that the proposal substantially meets nine

05:49:44.680 --> 05:49:52.200
minimum threshold standards that are in statute if those standards are substantially met then the

05:49:52.200 --> 05:49:57.640
county committee and the state board has can take discretionary action to approve the transfer

05:49:59.560 --> 05:50:07.320
the statute the education code does provide that the legislative intent that that reorganization

05:50:07.320 --> 05:50:12.200
should be based on local educational needs and concerns and the courts have established that

05:50:12.200 --> 05:50:17.160
simply meeting the minimum standards step one is not a compelling reason for approval

05:50:20.200 --> 05:50:25.240
the riverside county committee took that first step determined that all minimum threshold

05:50:25.240 --> 05:50:30.680
standards are substantially met however that they did not provide any information regarding

05:50:30.680 --> 05:50:35.480
the merits of the proposal the you know the reason behind their discretionary action

05:50:35.480 --> 05:50:41.480
other than it meets minimum thresholds you know we reviewed all the actions through minutes

05:50:42.360 --> 05:50:48.920
and and audio tapes of the meetings and and it was our opinion it is our opinion that the

05:50:48.920 --> 05:50:54.360
county committee granted approval solely on the basis of the proposal meeting the minimum threshold

05:50:54.360 --> 05:51:04.200
standards coachella valley this is opposed to the transfer the desert sands unified school district

05:51:04.280 --> 05:51:11.640
is neutral and retains that neutral stance here are the reasons for the appeal of coachella valley

05:51:11.640 --> 05:51:15.560
again i'm going to skip over this because i'll come back to it in the next slide

05:51:19.320 --> 05:51:26.040
those appeal issues are part of the minimum standards and i i mentioned there are nine the

05:51:26.040 --> 05:51:32.280
coachella valley school district unified school district brought up four in their appeal the first

05:51:32.360 --> 05:51:38.040
one is that the to transfer would have a negative effect on the district's ability

05:51:38.040 --> 05:51:45.480
to educate students in an integrated environment the district position is that even though only

05:51:45.480 --> 05:51:52.760
one student currently is affected right now with a district that has a 99 minority student enrollment

05:51:52.760 --> 05:52:00.440
the loss of any non-minority student is substantial you know we disagree we believe that the removal

05:52:00.440 --> 05:52:05.560
of one student is not going to have a substantial negative effect on either the district or any

05:52:05.560 --> 05:52:11.080
school to ensure that it can educate students in an in an integrated environment

05:52:13.640 --> 05:52:18.520
the district states that the loss of the assessed valuation of this transfer plus other transfers

05:52:18.520 --> 05:52:26.280
that might be spurred by approval of this would increase state cost in terms of financial hardship

05:52:26.280 --> 05:52:31.720
assistance when it comes to building schools or getting getting funds for renovating schools

05:52:33.320 --> 05:52:38.760
we disagree again that we find that the loss of less than one percent of assessed valuation will

05:52:38.760 --> 05:52:45.160
not increase state cost the district had planned at the time the proposal was considered locally

05:52:45.160 --> 05:52:51.560
to build a school close to the transfer area to serve that that subdivision and also other

05:52:51.560 --> 05:52:57.160
students in the surrounding areas and they felt that if this transfer is approved and other

05:52:57.160 --> 05:53:02.120
transfers follow that would lead to relocation of that school and that would have a negative

05:53:02.120 --> 05:53:08.200
effect on educational program currently there's no funding for that proposed new school

05:53:09.720 --> 05:53:14.680
and and the project has been shelved so the appeal concern is really a non-issue at this point

05:53:15.640 --> 05:53:22.440
and the district also claims that they believe that the petitioners

05:53:22.440 --> 05:53:29.160
primarily brought forward the the proposal to increase their property values there was no

05:53:29.160 --> 05:53:34.520
evidence of that during the local consideration and we found no evidence in in our so we don't

05:53:34.520 --> 05:53:43.320
think that's an issue now moving on to the petitioners reasons again this was step one

05:53:43.320 --> 05:53:49.000
that was just step one finding that all the minimum conditions are substantially met now we

05:53:49.000 --> 05:53:57.080
move on to finding a reason to approve the proposal we look first at the petitioners reasons they

05:53:57.080 --> 05:54:02.520
claim that the desert sands schools are closer to their area than our Coachella Valley schools

05:54:04.040 --> 05:54:08.840
in reality the elementary and middle schools there's not a whole lot of difference so there's

05:54:08.840 --> 05:54:13.000
not a significant difference in terms of the distance from the schools for the transfer area

05:54:13.080 --> 05:54:19.160
in fact the elementary school in Coachella Valley is closer than the desert sands schools however

05:54:19.960 --> 05:54:26.200
the high school the Coachella Valley high school is significantly farther away from the area than

05:54:26.200 --> 05:54:31.480
are the two desert sands high schools that are that are closest to the area a difference about

05:54:31.480 --> 05:54:37.800
eight miles to two or three miles however we also found that those two high schools are on the

05:54:37.800 --> 05:54:45.160
opposite side of highway 111 which is the primary north south route through this Coachella Valley

05:54:45.800 --> 05:54:53.240
and it's also a primary retail corridor for the area so there are safety concerns that

05:54:54.040 --> 05:55:02.200
that kind of mitigate the proximity of the schools there is a misstatement in the in the item

05:55:02.200 --> 05:55:07.160
we indicated in the item that the two middle schools in desert sands also were on the opposite

05:55:07.160 --> 05:55:12.040
side of the of the freeway the highway but actually only one of the middle schools are

05:55:12.040 --> 05:55:19.000
on the opposite side along with the with the two high schools at the time the proposal was

05:55:19.000 --> 05:55:24.040
considered locally no area student ever had attended the Coachella Valley Unified School

05:55:24.040 --> 05:55:30.120
District that's not true now there are a few students that are have attended and currently

05:55:30.120 --> 05:55:36.040
attend Coachella Valley but regardless we don't see that as a compelling reason to change school

05:55:36.040 --> 05:55:42.200
district boundaries the petitioners also state that desert sands has higher test scores in

05:55:42.200 --> 05:55:46.120
Coachella Valley and they want their students in those schools with the higher test scores

05:55:46.920 --> 05:55:53.160
though true it's still not a compelling reason to arrange school district boundaries in our opinion

05:55:55.800 --> 05:56:00.840
so we don't find any compelling reasons and what the petitioners offer us to recommend approval

05:56:01.480 --> 05:56:06.680
we also note as I indicated before that the county committee provided no reason for its actions other

05:56:06.680 --> 05:56:13.240
than that the transfer proposal meets minimum threshold standards but we do have a concern that

05:56:13.240 --> 05:56:19.000
approval of the transfer will set a precedent for future transfers out of Coachella Valley into

05:56:19.000 --> 05:56:26.200
desert sands there's been a history of those transfers and there's also been hysterical

05:56:26.200 --> 05:56:31.080
hysterical historical statewide concern that such attempts would continue

05:56:33.240 --> 05:56:38.920
1985 the Riverside County Committee approved the transfer this was undeveloped land

05:56:41.080 --> 05:56:44.680
that has since been developed into an upscale resort area

05:56:46.760 --> 05:56:53.720
india springs in 1995 there was another transfer proposal that was approved

05:56:54.280 --> 05:57:00.360
by the Riverside County Committee in this case the Coachella Valley Unified District

05:57:00.360 --> 05:57:06.360
did appeal to the state board there was some interesting there was an interesting situation

05:57:06.360 --> 05:57:12.280
at that time because Coachella Valley had a emergency state loan and the state superintendent

05:57:12.280 --> 05:57:18.600
had taken over control of the district from the state board so it actually the department could

05:57:18.600 --> 05:57:24.440
not analyze and make a recommendation because of its relationship with the district to the state

05:57:24.440 --> 05:57:29.480
board so the state board's executive director actually analyzed the proposal and made a

05:57:29.480 --> 05:57:35.560
recommendation that the state board reversed the county county committee's decision the department

05:57:35.560 --> 05:57:43.560
did go on record with concerns about the transfer and the state board eventually unanimously reversed

05:57:43.640 --> 05:57:45.240
the county committee's approval

05:57:48.200 --> 05:57:54.840
1998 there was another one that contained all the error that was in the 94 petition in this case the

05:57:54.840 --> 05:58:02.200
county committee did disapprove it and there was no subsequent appeal about that time the legislature

05:58:02.200 --> 05:58:07.800
became concerned that these attempts to pull territory and assess valuation and students out

05:58:07.800 --> 05:58:15.400
of Coachella Valley would have would have a negative effect on that district in terms of

05:58:15.400 --> 05:58:22.120
it trying to get out from under the the financial concerns that prompted it to get an emergency loan

05:58:23.160 --> 05:58:31.080
so it notified it it listed a number of conditions that if met a territory a territory could not be

05:58:31.080 --> 05:58:34.280
transferred out of a district unless the governing board approved it

05:58:36.280 --> 05:58:43.080
that moratorium stayed in effect for 10 years after the district repaid its loan so that was

05:58:43.080 --> 05:58:51.240
about 2012 so in summary we find that the territory transfer proposal substantially meets all nine

05:58:51.240 --> 05:58:58.760
minimum threshold standards we find no compelling reason to transfer the territory as i indicated

05:58:58.760 --> 05:59:03.720
before the petitioner's reason for the transfers are in our opinion not compelling local

05:59:03.720 --> 05:59:08.360
educational needs or concerns and again the riverside county committee didn't help us here

05:59:10.040 --> 05:59:17.800
and and we also find a reason to disapprove the transfer in other words uphold the appeal of the

05:59:17.800 --> 05:59:23.160
Coachella Valley Unified School District because it would establish a precedent for future efforts

05:59:23.160 --> 05:59:30.120
transfer territory from from that district again our recommendation is that based on our findings

05:59:30.840 --> 05:59:35.080
we recommend that the state board reverse the actions of the Riverside County Committee

05:59:35.640 --> 05:59:40.760
approving a territory transfer from the Coachella Valley Unified School District to the Desert Sands

05:59:40.760 --> 05:59:46.200
Unified School District I can take any clarifying questions now and I certainly

05:59:46.200 --> 05:59:48.840
will be here after the public hearing that that will follow

05:59:48.840 --> 06:00:01.160
I don't see any hands being raised for clarifying questions at this time so I will hereby open the

06:00:01.160 --> 06:00:08.520
public hearing at 3 15 p.m and first we will hear from the petitioners in favor of the territory

06:00:08.520 --> 06:00:14.760
transfer then we'll hear from the Coachella Valley USD in opposition to the transfer and each side

06:00:14.760 --> 06:00:19.960
will have 12 minutes after each side makes their presentations we'll then open up the phone lines

06:00:19.960 --> 06:00:25.560
for public comment from members of the public who are not part of the presentation each speaker will

06:00:25.560 --> 06:00:31.720
have one minute for their public comment so the petitioners in favor of the territory transfer

06:00:31.720 --> 06:00:38.840
you may begin good afternoon honorable president and members of the board Coachella Valley Unified

06:00:38.840 --> 06:00:44.200
School District and members of the public my name is Makayla Wilkie and I'm here today as a parent

06:00:44.200 --> 06:00:49.640
that resides in the Bridget Jefferson community and are asking for the approved district boundaries

06:00:49.640 --> 06:00:55.400
to be honored for our community to be in Desert Sands Unified School District the first thing I

06:00:55.400 --> 06:01:00.680
would like to point out is that the state's educational code has been met in approval of

06:01:00.680 --> 06:01:05.480
the district boundaries all nine conditions were passed unanimously by the Riverside County Board

06:01:05.480 --> 06:01:13.000
of Education in June of 2016 report by a third party place works district boundaries were established

06:01:13.000 --> 06:01:21.080
in 1964 before population growth and community developments took over our development of 124

06:01:21.080 --> 06:01:28.360
homes was not completed until 2013 and the petition was signed by 107 registered voters

06:01:28.360 --> 06:01:36.440
in the community in 2015 this process has been taking place since 2015 with no other community

06:01:36.440 --> 06:01:43.000
coming forward trying to establish new boundaries so I asked the question if the claim has been made

06:01:43.000 --> 06:01:47.480
that this would open more district rezoning wouldn't that have taken place when we were

06:01:47.480 --> 06:01:55.240
approved back in 2016 it has been five years and no other applications this leads me to my next

06:01:55.240 --> 06:02:00.120
point Coachella Valley Unified School District promised a new school closer to our development

06:02:00.760 --> 06:02:06.520
we know that proposed land has been leased for profit during the Coachella Valley music and stage

06:02:06.520 --> 06:02:13.480
coach festivals the festivals just signed a 20-year deal with the city of indio and do you really

06:02:13.480 --> 06:02:19.000
think a new school is going to be built at this site that was promised six years ago with much of

06:02:19.000 --> 06:02:23.800
the surrounding communities having far more vacation rentals than families who live in them

06:02:24.440 --> 06:02:30.680
I don't think so the 1994 district transfer request was never approved by the county

06:02:30.680 --> 06:02:37.320
it is a mute point it was asked for by a developer and contained a long stretch of corridor on avenue

06:02:37.320 --> 06:02:42.600
48 this is not brought forth by the voters or the people who reside in these communities

06:02:43.560 --> 06:02:48.040
the community encourages the board for the betterment of our children to transfer the

06:02:48.040 --> 06:02:53.880
territory to better balance student populations and accommodate growth in the future with minimal

06:02:53.880 --> 06:02:59.400
disruptions to our families according to a document obtained by the city of Coachella

06:02:59.400 --> 06:03:06.040
general plan update from February of 2012 Coachella Valley Unified School District had a

06:03:06.040 --> 06:03:14.120
total of 13 schools exceeding capacity by a total of 1562 students and this number has continued to

06:03:14.120 --> 06:03:21.320
increase along with their enrollment totals through the last few years also contained in

06:03:21.320 --> 06:03:27.400
this document is a section called out for desert desert sands unified stating the schools serving

06:03:27.400 --> 06:03:35.400
the planning area meaning closest to our community had a total enrollment of 3252 students with a

06:03:35.400 --> 06:03:43.880
capacity for 412 presently none of these schools exceed capacity in their space for 858 new students

06:03:44.600 --> 06:03:50.040
currently the schools we are zoned for in the Bridget Jefferson are all over capacity some by

06:03:50.040 --> 06:03:55.560
as much as four to six hundred students this was extremely evident when we went to one of our

06:03:56.360 --> 06:04:02.520
hearings and we're sitting at the elementary school and there are modulars out on the playground

06:04:02.520 --> 06:04:07.880
where kids are supposed to play so I ask you would you want your child going someplace where there's

06:04:07.880 --> 06:04:16.280
modulars and not enough room for them to even have outdoor activity in 2015 there were 15 new

06:04:16.280 --> 06:04:21.400
residential developments that are within the Coachella Valley Unified School District borders

06:04:21.400 --> 06:04:26.920
that have come to completion or are close to completion furthermore increasing the growth

06:04:26.920 --> 06:04:31.960
and the overcrowding in the Coachella Valley Unified School District there is also potential

06:04:31.960 --> 06:04:37.320
for more growth as there is much more open space yet to be developed in Coachella Valley Unified

06:04:37.320 --> 06:04:43.480
School District this is not the case in Desert Sands Unified with these new developments and

06:04:43.480 --> 06:04:48.280
the funding fees for local schools in the Coachella Valley Unified School District our community

06:04:48.280 --> 06:04:53.160
does not feel that transferring our territory would be any sort of financial hardship for the

06:04:53.160 --> 06:04:58.840
Coachella Valley Unified School District the Bridget Jefferson is the furthest most community

06:04:58.840 --> 06:05:03.880
of the Coachella Valley Unified School District distances to the schools in the Coachella Valley

06:05:03.880 --> 06:05:09.640
Unified greatly restricts student involvement in extracurricular activities in essence by

06:05:09.640 --> 06:05:15.400
honoring the district transfer you are disenfranchising our children in our community

06:05:15.960 --> 06:05:22.360
as quoted in an article from the Desert Sun from June 21st of 2015 from the director of technology

06:05:22.360 --> 06:05:28.280
from Coachella Valley Unified School District some of these students spend nearly four hours on a bus

06:05:28.280 --> 06:05:35.000
each day these are our children as they are the furthest away attending Desert Sands Unified

06:05:35.000 --> 06:05:41.480
School District our children are able to walk and ride bikes home this also helps with global

06:05:41.480 --> 06:05:48.440
warming and taking care of our environment the big point here is 90 percent of Indio is located

06:05:48.440 --> 06:05:53.640
in the Desert Sands Unified School District it makes sense that our community should be able to

06:05:53.640 --> 06:05:58.360
identify with the city that they live in and attend the schools that 90 percent of the city

06:05:58.360 --> 06:06:04.280
attend the community members that support our city we want to be able to identify and attend

06:06:04.280 --> 06:06:09.400
public schools in the community for which we have the closest ties currently my husband is a coach

06:06:09.400 --> 06:06:15.720
at Indio High School in Desert Sands Unified and I volunteer at Desert Sands Unified this is due in

06:06:15.720 --> 06:06:20.840
part because Indio is where we live it is the community to which we identify with keeping

06:06:20.840 --> 06:06:24.760
children away from where they live and where parents commute to and from work is a detriment

06:06:24.760 --> 06:06:30.520
not only to the children but to our district this is the norm in our community we are not only the

06:06:30.520 --> 06:06:34.600
community members who have the same route to and from work but we are the ones who give back to the

06:06:34.600 --> 06:06:40.360
community in which we reside safety is another major concern of the community when we discuss

06:06:40.360 --> 06:06:46.440
transportation and safe walking distances to and from school there is no safe walking route

06:06:46.440 --> 06:06:51.080
for the community to use in Coachella Valley Unified School District as the schools are just

06:06:51.080 --> 06:06:56.200
too far away from our community Coachella Valley Unified School District prepared a document back

06:06:56.200 --> 06:07:03.160
in 2011 of May for the board meeting to discuss why change needed to happen in school boundaries

06:07:03.720 --> 06:07:09.400
their main concerns were to relieve student overcrowding live within walking distance

06:07:09.400 --> 06:07:13.720
enforce walking walking distance policies and reduce transportation costs

06:07:14.440 --> 06:07:18.920
by honoring our community to transfer territory you are providing Coachella Valley Unified School

06:07:18.920 --> 06:07:24.040
Districts with the changes that they have been asking for in regards to fiscal solvency and

06:07:24.040 --> 06:07:29.800
providing our community with a positive and safe environment the schools that we our community

06:07:29.800 --> 06:07:34.360
would attend in Desert Sands Unified are all within safe walking distance and provided lighted

06:07:35.160 --> 06:07:41.800
sidewalks and safe routes for our children to bike and walk as a parent we want what is best

06:07:41.800 --> 06:07:46.440
for our children honoring the boundary transfer is not only what is best for our children but we

06:07:46.440 --> 06:07:51.960
feel is best for both districts involved the evidence has been presented as to why honoring

06:07:51.960 --> 06:07:57.800
approved district transfers is beneficial for all the bridge at Jefferson community is asking to be

06:07:57.800 --> 06:08:03.800
the standard not the exception the community is asking for consistency and community identity

06:08:04.440 --> 06:08:08.200
we want to thank you for this time for your time this afternoon at the bridge

06:08:08.200 --> 06:08:13.000
and everybody at the community watching we recognize how difficult this process is and

06:08:13.000 --> 06:08:18.120
we hope that we can offer stability going forward we know that this is that the board's

06:08:18.120 --> 06:08:23.800
responsibility is to make sure quality education is available and we do appreciate you taking that

06:08:23.800 --> 06:08:39.400
time I'll now turn it over to again Glenn Cavalero for some additional comments thank you

06:08:45.960 --> 06:08:53.400
you're muted

06:08:54.680 --> 06:09:02.440
there we go is that better yes okay um thank you all very much for allowing us the time to

06:09:02.440 --> 06:09:06.440
state our case here and especially me I'm just I'm a resident of the bridge of Jefferson I've

06:09:06.440 --> 06:09:13.320
been here for 13 years um I did not have I'm retired and I did not have any children that

06:09:13.320 --> 06:09:19.640
attend the schools and that was one of the points that was made was that with such a low number of

06:09:19.640 --> 06:09:29.000
students uh that were in the district that were looking to transfer um why were there so many

06:09:29.000 --> 06:09:36.200
people that signed the petition and that had to be that the primary concern really was to increase

06:09:36.200 --> 06:09:44.280
our property values which is totally untrue the bridge of Jefferson is a little bit different than

06:09:45.240 --> 06:09:48.120
the bridge of Jefferson is a little bit different than a lot of communities

06:09:48.920 --> 06:09:53.800
I think almost everybody here knows everybody else everyone's out walking in the evening and

06:09:53.800 --> 06:09:59.640
sees each other and if there's a community concern everyone is going to jump on board

06:10:01.480 --> 06:10:08.680
you just don't have to have children to see that as a need for the community and if it's good for

06:10:08.760 --> 06:10:16.040
the community is good for us I want to make a couple of comments also in what was presented

06:10:16.040 --> 06:10:25.480
earlier about highway 111 um how 111 is an east and west corridor it's really just called highway

06:10:25.480 --> 06:10:30.920
111 as it was never given a name if you look at highway 74 that's monterey avenue that runs

06:10:30.920 --> 06:10:36.520
through palm desert and up into the mountains it's really no different than Jefferson street which

06:10:36.520 --> 06:10:42.840
is where the street we live on highway 111 is three lanes in each direction running east and west

06:10:42.840 --> 06:10:47.640
Jefferson is six lanes three lanes in either direction running north and south

06:10:49.640 --> 06:10:56.840
crossing highway 111 is just a daily fact and a matter of everyone that lives in the area so that

06:10:56.840 --> 06:11:03.480
being a safety issue is really not a safety issue at all and I guess you'd really have to just come

06:11:03.480 --> 06:11:13.560
down and take a look at it to see that it's not unlike any other intersection anywhere and again

06:11:13.560 --> 06:11:19.000
from the bridge at Jefferson you know I attend all the Friday night football games at Lakita high

06:11:19.000 --> 06:11:25.880
school and I walk there doesn't take very long so that's basically it there's one one other thing

06:11:26.600 --> 06:11:32.040
that was brought up and it's kind of a touchy situation and I don't even like to bring it up

06:11:32.120 --> 06:11:39.320
it's just that there's the comments that are put into the presentation that was put out about this

06:11:39.320 --> 06:11:46.840
encouraging white flight and when I hear the term white flight that kind of brings the racial

06:11:46.840 --> 06:11:53.960
overtones into it which is really a shame yeah I'm a second generation Mexican American whose family

06:11:54.520 --> 06:12:03.480
came to the United States from Monterey Mexico and I am that that that type of thing never enters my

06:12:04.040 --> 06:12:11.400
mind no matter what the situation is and I hate when that when it comes down to in some cases

06:12:11.400 --> 06:12:17.320
desperation on the on on one side or the other that that has to be brought up into it because

06:12:17.320 --> 06:12:23.080
that really really does need to stay out of this 100 percent the only thing we're looking for here

06:12:23.080 --> 06:12:29.800
is for our children that live in the neighborhood to be able to go to a school that they identify

06:12:29.800 --> 06:12:37.640
with and if you think about why they identify with this because if you go out from my house

06:12:37.640 --> 06:12:44.280
go two tenths of a mile to Jefferson street and look across that's the Coachella that's the desert

06:12:44.280 --> 06:12:52.680
sand unified school district that's where our our children's friends live so they should be able to

06:12:52.680 --> 06:12:59.080
go to school where their friends go to school and sir I'm sorry your time is up thank you

06:13:07.400 --> 06:13:15.240
I think we want to move at this point to the Coachella Valley USD representatives

06:13:15.240 --> 06:13:21.240
Yes, thank you. Good afternoon President Darling-Hammond and members of the State Board of Education.

06:13:21.240 --> 06:13:26.440
My name is Luis Valentino and I am the Superintendent of the Coachella Valley Unified School District.

06:13:26.440 --> 06:13:32.200
We are here today to request that you support the appeal from the action by the Riverside County

06:13:32.200 --> 06:13:37.400
Committee on School District Organization to approve a transfer of territory from the Coachella

06:13:37.400 --> 06:13:43.240
Valley Unified School District to the Coachella Valley Unified School District.

06:13:44.040 --> 06:13:49.560
As you have heard of the California Department of Education's recommendation that the State Board

06:13:49.560 --> 06:13:55.480
of Education reverse the action by the Riverside County Committee after finding no compelling reason

06:13:55.480 --> 06:14:01.240
to transfer the subdivision. We hope the additional comments shared with you today by our leaders

06:14:01.240 --> 06:14:06.200
including our Board President Mr. Acuna and our Council Mr. Barankowicz and others speaking

06:14:06.200 --> 06:14:11.240
through public comment as well as the comments submitted to the State Board of Education.

06:14:11.720 --> 06:14:16.600
As well as the comments submitted to you via email earlier will demonstrate the importance

06:14:16.600 --> 06:14:21.720
of your decision in concluding that it is critical to protect the existing territory

06:14:21.720 --> 06:14:27.640
and keep our school district whole. And with that I would ask Mr. Barankowicz to

06:14:28.680 --> 06:14:36.520
address the board. Yes and I will go ahead and share my screen with you and

06:14:36.520 --> 06:14:46.520
again again you just heard from Dr. Valentino our Superintendent and Unlico Council for the

06:14:46.520 --> 06:14:52.200
District and then last up will be Joey Acuna who is the Board President. Again we so we support

06:14:52.200 --> 06:14:58.200
Coachella Valley USD or Coachella Valley USD supports the CDE recommendation but we also

06:14:58.200 --> 06:15:03.880
wanted to discuss why we believe that conditions four nine five and eight are not substantially

06:15:03.960 --> 06:15:11.160
met. First a little bit different depiction of the bridge territory it contains 37 acres and

06:15:11.160 --> 06:15:17.800
124 parcels as you can see here the aerial on the right and the parcel layout on the left.

06:15:19.480 --> 06:15:29.800
This development is gated it's well appointed and very high end. This is a picture of its entrance

06:15:29.800 --> 06:15:36.440
into into this gated community. Here is another picture of the bridge showing

06:15:36.440 --> 06:15:43.880
a pocket park of the bridge that again is gated and very well appointed. Contrast these

06:15:44.680 --> 06:15:51.160
with pictures of with a picture of what's a typical subdivision in Coachella Valley

06:15:51.960 --> 06:16:01.720
has. They've got very meager homes people are working class and there's nothing like that

06:16:01.720 --> 06:16:08.920
in in the bridge and it's true that the areas adjacent to the bridge are similar to them but

06:16:08.920 --> 06:16:14.360
they are not representative of the Coachella Valley as a whole. Coachella Valley as a whole

06:16:14.440 --> 06:16:19.240
is it's got much more meager housing subdivisions.

06:16:21.720 --> 06:16:25.960
Here is the boundaries of the Coachella Valley district as you can see here in the

06:16:25.960 --> 06:16:32.440
dark outline you can see the Indian palms cut out here on the left hand side or the

06:16:32.440 --> 06:16:38.520
west hand side of the property or the boundaries and then off to the west a little bit is the

06:16:39.160 --> 06:16:40.440
is the the bridge portion.

06:16:44.200 --> 06:16:50.600
What we do agree with with CDE is that there is no compelling reason for the transfer

06:16:52.440 --> 06:16:59.160
and there's no rationale provided and none was addressed by the county committee. The although

06:16:59.160 --> 06:17:10.200
Desert Sands has has higher test scores than Coachella Valley this is due in large part is

06:17:10.200 --> 06:17:17.240
found by CDE that there's a higher population of of English language learners in Coachella Valley

06:17:17.240 --> 06:17:23.480
than there is in in Desert Sands but what's really key and important that was I think missed out of

06:17:23.480 --> 06:17:30.600
CDE's presentation is that that that was found that both districts have sound educational programs

06:17:30.600 --> 06:17:34.920
between the between both districts both Desert Sands and Coachella Valley.

06:17:38.440 --> 06:17:46.680
The precedent for future harmful petitions CDE notes that there were three different attempts

06:17:46.680 --> 06:17:51.400
prior to the transfer these were in 85 which was the Indian palms transfer that did happen

06:17:51.960 --> 06:18:01.560
and then the 1994 and the 1998 ones that were rejected and and all all of these areas except

06:18:01.560 --> 06:18:05.720
the the the first one went through and the other two got rejected but the other two that were

06:18:05.720 --> 06:18:13.480
rejected also included the bridge territory at the time and what's important is staff CDE

06:18:14.440 --> 06:18:19.160
recognizes and acknowledges that there are racial ethnic and socio-economic

06:18:21.320 --> 06:18:30.760
disparities between the districts. This was so evident that as mentioned by CDE the legislator

06:18:30.760 --> 06:18:36.840
acknowledged that the harm to Coachella Valley from potential transfers that it actually had to

06:18:36.840 --> 06:18:45.080
adopt education code 35706.5 which at the time was senate bill 997 which had the 10-year moratorium

06:18:45.080 --> 06:18:52.760
to free Coachella Valley's USD boundaries to allow an acceptable bond program to to move forward with.

06:18:53.880 --> 06:19:01.080
What must be high what must be highlighted is that CDE also applying that this transfer goes through

06:19:01.800 --> 06:19:06.200
others will follow and could exacerbate the already existing racial and ethnic

06:19:06.200 --> 06:19:11.240
and socio-economic disparities between the districts and would have substantial negative

06:19:11.240 --> 06:19:21.560
effects on Coachella Valley USD. So with that where we reach disagreement with the

06:19:23.160 --> 06:19:29.560
CDE is that we believe that conditions four nine five and eight are not met

06:19:30.280 --> 06:19:37.320
and we bring them in the order of importance and condition four talks about preserving an

06:19:37.320 --> 06:19:42.440
integrated environment and will not promote racial or ethnic discrimination or segregation.

06:19:43.000 --> 06:19:48.840
Based on CDE's opinion above that the future potential transfers will exacerbate racial

06:19:48.840 --> 06:19:54.280
ethnic and socio-economic disparities this condition cannot be substantially met.

06:19:55.000 --> 06:20:01.320
This is demonstrated by looking at the extreme high minority

06:20:03.480 --> 06:20:10.040
extreme high minority rates within Coachella Valley as opposed to

06:20:11.640 --> 06:20:23.880
desert sands you can see that Coachella Valley is 99 over 99 minority less than one percent white

06:20:25.000 --> 06:20:34.920
yet desert sands USD is only you know not not as quite it has 18 white population

06:20:34.920 --> 06:20:41.480
and then the rest minority so far less integrated it has a far more integrated

06:20:41.480 --> 06:20:47.400
environment in desert sands than that's certainly in Coachella Valley. Also here is the

06:20:48.040 --> 06:20:56.520
the slide showing the the schools the the amount of the percentages of minorities from Coachella

06:20:56.520 --> 06:21:03.720
Valley at district serving schools versus what would serve at desert sands again still very high

06:21:04.600 --> 06:21:11.960
and and tracking what what I just mentioned earlier is very high minority rates in Coachella

06:21:12.040 --> 06:21:16.600
Valley as opposed to desert sands and what's important about this

06:21:17.480 --> 06:21:26.680
is that we're talking about Coachella Valley only has in its enrollment 177 white students out of

06:21:26.680 --> 06:21:37.880
its 18,000 in enrollment whereas desert sands has 5,788 white students the bridge area has an

06:21:37.880 --> 06:21:46.760
enrollment of 17 and 15 of them are are white now that means that the 15 white students that amounts

06:21:46.760 --> 06:21:52.120
to eight percent of the total white population of Coachella Valley that gets transferred as a

06:21:52.120 --> 06:21:57.720
result of this and if you just look at the number of students that are now attending desert sands

06:21:57.720 --> 06:22:04.520
which is seven students that's four percent of Coachella Valley's white students that is

06:22:04.520 --> 06:22:10.920
a substantial amount of white students percentage wise that are being transferred out would be

06:22:10.920 --> 06:22:16.280
transferred out of Coachella Valley to desert sands and such a large portion of white students

06:22:16.280 --> 06:22:21.720
transferring does not serve an integrated environment but it does promote racial and

06:22:21.720 --> 06:22:27.400
ethnic segregation and discrimination even CDE's regulation on condition four talks in terms of

06:22:27.400 --> 06:22:37.880
future impacts under title five CCR section 18573a4 it says to determine whether new districts

06:22:37.880 --> 06:22:42.440
will promote racial or ethnic discrimination or segregation the effects of the following factors

06:22:42.440 --> 06:22:48.760
will be considered and b it states that the trend and rates of present and possible future growth

06:22:48.760 --> 06:22:56.920
or change in the total population and the districts affected in each racial and ethnic group within the

06:22:56.920 --> 06:23:02.760
total district and in each school and the affected areas so this is talking about terms of of future

06:23:02.760 --> 06:23:09.320
potential transfers so with that there cannot be that condition four cannot be met because of these

06:23:09.320 --> 06:23:13.560
potential future transfers and the wide disparities between the districts

06:23:15.960 --> 06:23:23.080
also condition nine is not met because you can see based on the assessed values that desert sands

06:23:23.080 --> 06:23:31.080
has over almost four percent more or 400 percent more assessed value over over Coachella Valley

06:23:31.640 --> 06:23:37.960
Valley also we have declining enrollment which further exacerbates the the fiscal impact of the

06:23:37.960 --> 06:23:44.440
district and then the increased cost of the state the CDE we did not see them look at the potential

06:23:44.440 --> 06:23:52.200
costs of desert sands having to house 80 students from the bridge also this is is primarily designed

06:23:52.200 --> 06:23:57.560
to increase property values as you can see by just looking at the inferential information from

06:23:57.560 --> 06:24:02.840
it that only 17 students are from the bridge seven are attending desert sands yet more than

06:24:02.840 --> 06:24:09.000
25 percent of bridge residents signed the petition i'm now turning this over to our board president

06:24:09.000 --> 06:24:09.800
Joey Acuna

06:24:17.080 --> 06:24:17.720
go ahead Joey

06:24:20.920 --> 06:24:26.440
am i on now yes yes good afternoon chair and members of the board my name is Joey Acuna i'm

06:24:26.440 --> 06:24:29.000
the current president Coachella Valley Unified School District

06:24:31.560 --> 06:24:38.360
i gotta tell you this has been happening since 1985 30 plus years now that initial

06:24:38.360 --> 06:24:43.160
board i don't think understood that they could stand up and fight this is my personally my third

06:24:43.160 --> 06:24:48.280
one i am more than willing to stand up and fight for our districts from these attacks and please

06:24:48.280 --> 06:24:53.000
these are attacks these are not requests these are attacks and they've been going on for 30

06:24:53.000 --> 06:24:58.440
years now and i say enough is enough additionally i was going to say something else but in lieu of

06:24:58.440 --> 06:25:03.160
what they said you know they came up and said look this is just about us wanting to be in our

06:25:03.160 --> 06:25:08.120
community in the city of indio you know we want our kids to go to community schools the problem

06:25:08.200 --> 06:25:13.560
is that last year seven of their middle and high school students that transferred did not go to

06:25:13.560 --> 06:25:18.440
indio high school or indio middle school they went to la quinta high school and john glenn twice as

06:25:18.440 --> 06:25:24.600
far as the current community schools this isn't about yes you only have 10 seconds remaining if

06:27:07.800 --> 06:27:15.480
valley unified and desert sand unified district for the past 20 years I represent district five

06:27:15.480 --> 06:27:21.000
of the city of indio which is two-thirds located in cattela valley unified and one-third located

06:27:21.000 --> 06:27:26.280
in desert sand unified school district we're here today to talk about the local needs and education

06:27:26.280 --> 06:27:32.520
of our students not to talk about race not to talk about property values but what is in the best

06:27:32.520 --> 06:27:41.640
interest of our children back in the late 1980s this area was not a part of indio so back in 1964

06:27:41.640 --> 06:27:49.560
when the boundaries were drawn this was in the sphere of cattela so the area that is now

06:27:49.560 --> 06:27:57.400

okay um that's it for public comment given that there's no other public comment

06:28:42.520 --> 06:28:49.800
I hereby close the public hearing at 3 43 p.m. and we will now begin with board discussion and

06:28:49.800 --> 06:28:54.840
I'd first like to ask member sue burr if she would like to make some initial comments

06:28:56.280 --> 06:29:01.800
uh thank you president darlin cam and um as those of you who have been on the board a long time

06:29:01.800 --> 06:29:08.360
these are never easy discussions particularly when there are strong feelings from local

06:29:08.360 --> 06:29:15.160
communities about their school children I will have to say I you know I spent a lot of time with

06:29:15.160 --> 06:29:21.480
larry shirey and as usual the department has done I think a really thorough job of reviewing

06:29:21.480 --> 06:29:27.400
all of the components and the statutory requirements relative to

06:29:27.400 --> 06:29:33.400
a territory transfer and I think in this case they've come to the correct conclusion

06:29:33.400 --> 06:29:40.520
that the action of the county committee which we normally will affirm because they have the best

06:29:40.520 --> 06:29:46.040
finger on the pulse in the community but in this case the county community or I'm sorry the county

06:29:46.040 --> 06:29:53.320
committee for riverside county um really didn't find a compelling reason to approve the transfer

06:29:53.400 --> 06:29:57.720
and the department is recommending that we reverse the action of the county committee

06:29:57.720 --> 06:30:03.800
um and based on my review and discussion with larry and cde staff I would concur with that

06:30:04.760 --> 06:30:09.800
so I will if board members have other questions and of course comments we I'd like to hear from

06:30:09.800 --> 06:30:16.280
those but I'm prepared to support the department's recommendation thank you so much and we do have

06:30:16.280 --> 06:30:22.440
some comments from vice president Strauss member rucker and member son so vice president Strauss

06:30:22.440 --> 06:30:30.920
please carry us forward thank you so I just want to thank the presentation I have a couple of

06:30:30.920 --> 06:30:38.760
questions so larry if you're available I have two different questions I want to clarify I kind of

06:30:38.760 --> 06:30:45.320
know this area and um my question is first do we know the number of students who live in the

06:30:45.320 --> 06:30:53.560
bridget jefferson area and where they currently attend school that's my first question yes there

06:30:53.560 --> 06:31:00.040
have been I think they're over the past five or six years the numbers have ranged from I don't

06:31:00.040 --> 06:31:05.640
have the report in front of me between 17 and 18 and I think that's the number of students who

06:31:05.720 --> 06:31:12.920
I don't have the report in front of me between 17 and 7 um uh one or two attend

06:31:14.360 --> 06:31:21.560
five years ago they all were granted inter-district transfers uh to if they if they requested them to

06:31:21.560 --> 06:31:27.320
attend desert sands or some other school district uh the the Coachella Valley school district when

06:31:27.320 --> 06:31:34.920
they realized they were were losing more of than of their non-minority students that they

06:31:34.920 --> 06:31:41.000
thought was good for the educational program they cut down on inter-district transfers that

06:31:41.000 --> 06:31:46.920
they that they were approving so as of right now we do have I think there's one student

06:31:47.640 --> 06:31:53.720
who is from the area who is attending Coachella Valley and I believe the number who are attending

06:31:56.200 --> 06:32:03.560
desert sands at the last number we had was seven for the 1920 school year 18 19 it was 10

06:32:04.280 --> 06:32:11.640
and for 17 18 it was 16 thank you so my second question is and I don't know if you have this on

06:32:11.640 --> 06:32:17.400
a map but based on where the Bridget Jefferson is I'm interested in on where the Coachella Valley

06:32:17.400 --> 06:32:23.640
schools are that students would attend and where the schools for desert sands are because what I

06:32:23.640 --> 06:32:28.280
heard was Coachella was going to build a school but then there are no funds that are not going to

06:32:29.080 --> 06:32:33.720
and um and I hear about the distance of getting to school and what I heard at least in

06:32:34.440 --> 06:32:41.960
the petitioners was that the kids are much closer to desert sands but then I heard Coachella saying

06:32:41.960 --> 06:32:47.400
no I understand the difference in the communities just my question is the location of the school

06:32:47.400 --> 06:32:52.680
students would attend from this area where they are in Coachella Valley and where they are in

06:32:52.680 --> 06:32:59.240
desert sands location wise Coachella Valley schools are are all located south and east

06:32:59.240 --> 06:33:07.720
of the community the desert sands schools are for the most part located north of the community

06:33:07.720 --> 06:33:12.840
you know the the distances are you know I could go through the distances I believe I have that here

06:33:12.840 --> 06:33:17.160
if you want to do the specific distances or isn't a really a substantial difference

06:33:17.800 --> 06:33:24.120
in the elementary and middle school in terms of the the the how far away they are from

06:33:24.680 --> 06:33:30.280
from the proposed transfer area but there is a significant difference between the high schools

06:33:30.280 --> 06:33:38.120
the Coachella Valley high school is eight miles southeast both both the desert sands or sorry both

06:33:38.120 --> 06:33:45.400
the Indio and La Quinta high schools are are between two and three miles north of the of the

06:33:45.400 --> 06:33:50.920
proposed transfer area and are you saying that the elementary and middle are similar in distance

06:33:51.640 --> 06:33:55.240
right the elementary actually the Coachella Valley elementary school is closer

06:33:56.360 --> 06:34:04.920
but and but in terms of the numbers the distance for elementary is in Coachella Valley is 2.2 miles

06:34:05.800 --> 06:34:12.360
versus 2.3 miles in desert sands very similar but slightly closer in Coachella Valley the

06:34:12.360 --> 06:34:19.800
middle schools for Coachella Valley is four and a half miles and the two two desert sands

06:34:20.360 --> 06:34:25.640
middle schools are two and three miles thank you

06:34:28.520 --> 06:34:34.840
that takes care of those uh I have member Rucker member Sun member Rucker you're next

06:34:35.400 --> 06:34:43.560
um Larry I just wanted to get a clarification on exactly what would be the result of what is being

06:34:43.560 --> 06:34:53.240
recommended so the county found no compelling reason to approve the request and your recommendation

06:34:53.240 --> 06:35:01.800
is that we reverse the decision of the county so what would be the outcome from taking that action

06:35:01.800 --> 06:35:08.280
I want to make sure I'm clear on that I just want to clarify your comment uh it's not that

06:35:09.640 --> 06:35:16.440
excuse me it's not that the county committee did not find a compelling reason um again there's a

06:35:16.440 --> 06:35:23.400
two-step process look at the nine required minimum threshold standards and statute if those are

06:35:23.400 --> 06:35:28.200
substantially met then the county committee could have taken the discretionary action to approve

06:35:29.000 --> 06:35:35.320
uh as I stated the legislature said that should be based on local educational needs and concerns

06:35:38.120 --> 06:35:44.680
it's not that they didn't find actively they did not consider any reasons or any they did not take

06:35:44.680 --> 06:35:51.160
that second step at all which led to us not having any information from the county committee

06:35:51.160 --> 06:35:55.720
regarding why they took the action they did other than it seemed very clear to us

06:35:56.440 --> 06:36:01.560
that uh they took the they they assumed they approved the territory transfer because they

06:36:01.560 --> 06:36:08.120
found the nine conditions substantially met in terms of what's this yeah yeah please go ahead

06:36:09.560 --> 06:36:18.120
so in terms of what happens if if the uh if the uh appeal is disapproved the state

06:36:18.120 --> 06:36:25.880
board allows the transfer to take place because Coachella Valley um is opposed to it it'll be

06:36:25.880 --> 06:36:32.040
required to go to a local election if you allow the transfer to go forward then we'll have to

06:36:32.040 --> 06:36:40.120
take another step which is to set the election area for the for this proposal if so just wait

06:36:40.200 --> 06:36:45.480
just be clear I think I think the question is if we approve the CDE recommendation

06:36:46.440 --> 06:36:52.120
then the territory will stay in Coachella Valley where it is now and the children will continue

06:36:52.120 --> 06:36:58.600
to go to school in Coachella Valley USA that's correct there'll be no change in that's what I

06:36:58.600 --> 06:37:04.680
was trying to get clear yeah that's thank you Dr thank you Dr Darling-Hammond you're welcome

06:37:04.680 --> 06:37:15.800
Member Sun yes so uh all right so for the county committee are they required by law to

06:37:15.800 --> 06:37:21.640
do that second step to find the compelling reason there's no requirement to find a compelling

06:37:21.640 --> 06:37:28.840
reason in statute or in regulation what we have is the intent of the legislature which states that

06:37:28.840 --> 06:37:36.440
uh any reorganization needs to be based on educational needs and concerns there is also

06:37:36.440 --> 06:37:45.160
the excuse me I'm suffering from allergies right now um the courts have told us that uh you know

06:37:45.800 --> 06:37:50.840
just meeting these nine minimum standards is not a reason that compels approval

06:37:51.480 --> 06:37:58.200
and the our interpretation of that has been twofold one is that the courts have established a legal

06:37:58.200 --> 06:38:05.560
standard um and the second thing is that you know this is just in line with with what boards do

06:38:06.280 --> 06:38:11.880
on on a regular basis in terms of taking discretionary action you need to find make a

06:38:11.880 --> 06:38:18.120
value judgment on the uh on the proposal on the petitioner's reason for the process for the

06:38:18.120 --> 06:38:25.720
proposal if they don't if those reasons do not compel you to vote for them then then uh it

06:38:25.800 --> 06:38:33.240
should you shouldn't be voting to approve the territory transfer okay and then in the comments

06:38:33.240 --> 06:38:44.200
um between the two the two groups the Coachella Valley is saying that by the transfer they would

06:38:44.200 --> 06:38:53.160
lose a large percentage of their white students um is but then in the CDE presentation you said

06:38:53.160 --> 06:38:58.280
that there was really just one student so you didn't feel that that was a compelling that was

06:38:58.280 --> 06:39:07.560
not a well we look at this uh threshold we look only at the merits of the uh at the individual

06:39:07.560 --> 06:39:13.640
transfer in the circumstances there currently though there may be 17 students uh in the area

06:39:13.640 --> 06:39:19.560
and only one uh attends Coachella Valley uh the transfer is only going to result in the loss of

06:39:19.560 --> 06:39:26.120
that one student it's not going to result uh for our purposes in the loss of all 17 students

06:39:26.120 --> 06:39:32.280
because those students are gone not part of the district as it is so we look at the direct effect

06:39:32.280 --> 06:39:39.080
of the territory transfer which in this case is one student and we don't see that as a as a

06:39:39.080 --> 06:39:45.640
substantial or a significant negative effect on the ability of the district or any school in the

06:39:45.640 --> 06:39:52.920
district to provide an integrated educational environment okay very good so the the reason that

06:39:52.920 --> 06:40:03.960
the CDE's um recommendation to uh to prove the appeal and overturn the county committee is based

06:40:03.960 --> 06:40:11.000
on one that the county even though they were not required to should have um done the compelling

06:40:11.000 --> 06:40:20.280
reason and then the second is there's been some history sort of uh our our rationale is twofold

06:40:20.280 --> 06:40:27.960
is that we didn't find any compelling reason to uh to recommend that the transfer be approved

06:40:27.960 --> 06:40:34.280
you know we when we do these things we typically look to what the county uh circumstances are with

06:40:34.280 --> 06:40:39.640
the county's issues are and they didn't take that action so they didn't provide us anything to help

06:40:39.640 --> 06:40:46.840
us in our determination and then secondly of course so is the issue that we're concerned that

06:40:46.840 --> 06:40:52.280
this would be a precedent setting effect a setting event you know we've seen it in similar

06:40:52.280 --> 06:40:58.920
circumstances across the state uh these things i should i should add it's not within a very short

06:40:58.920 --> 06:41:05.400
time frame these issues go on for decades yes you know i like to point to the ravenswood school

06:41:05.400 --> 06:41:11.720
district in san matteo county when territory transfers out of that district uh started again

06:41:11.720 --> 06:41:17.000
about the same time frame in 1985 and they just and they're continuing to this day efforts to

06:41:17.000 --> 06:41:25.320
transfer territory out i understand i it's just it is a little bit on this one for us to overturn

06:41:25.320 --> 06:41:32.920
a local decision um i'm not sure i'm finding a really really strong reason so i have to kind of

06:41:32.920 --> 06:41:39.560
think a little bit more on this okay yeah we we get great weight to to the local decision it's

06:41:39.560 --> 06:41:44.680
just that we really didn't have anything here so we needed to go with our uh with what we thought

06:41:44.680 --> 06:41:51.160
the issue was and that that's where that question of compelling rationale comes in it was hard to

06:41:51.160 --> 06:41:57.640
know why they made the decision because they didn't state a rationale um i'm going to go to vice

06:41:57.640 --> 06:42:04.760
president strouse and then i'm going to ask member rucker is your hand up on purpose or did you forget

06:42:04.760 --> 06:42:11.400
to take it down i forgot to take it down i am sorry so vice president strouse thank you so

06:42:13.720 --> 06:42:19.240
there's one student currently in this area who goes to coachella valley the other students who

06:42:19.240 --> 06:42:26.680
live in there do not attend they attend desert sands on a permit so my first question is

06:42:28.600 --> 06:42:33.640
if if we if the board supports the cd recommendation the students then

06:42:34.280 --> 06:42:40.600
will can can continue their attendance pattern and in fact continue to attend the schools they

06:42:40.600 --> 06:42:46.120
currently attend is that correct that's that's up to the coachella valley school district in terms

06:42:46.120 --> 06:42:51.960
of its approval of interdistrict transfer uh request and extensions of current uh you know

06:42:51.960 --> 06:42:56.200
my assumption is and perhaps if the district could provide more information is that since

06:42:56.920 --> 06:43:02.200
we do have continuing students on interdistrict transfers that they are grandfathering in

06:43:03.000 --> 06:43:09.720
the previously approved transfers but as with any school district the school

06:43:09.720 --> 06:43:13.720
district has the authority to deny or approve a interdistrict transfer request

06:43:14.840 --> 06:43:22.920
my second question is if the board was to support the riverside county decision the local decision

06:43:22.920 --> 06:43:28.440
and not support the cd recommendation over turnin what would be the next steps

06:43:29.080 --> 06:43:33.640
next step is that we would have to ask you to determine who's going to vote on the issue

06:43:34.440 --> 06:43:41.240
since coachella valley is opposed that requires an election to finalize transfer of the territory

06:43:41.240 --> 06:43:47.560
so if the board votes to uphold the riverside county decision we will need we would need to

06:43:47.560 --> 06:43:53.720
then to move into a a recommend or not a recommendation but an establishment of

06:43:53.720 --> 06:44:02.120
election area by the board we recommend that because there are really this territory transfer

06:44:02.120 --> 06:44:08.040
itself has no direct effects that the election area would just be the the territory proposed

06:44:08.040 --> 06:44:15.240
for transfer should the should the board decide to go with the riverside county approval thank you

06:44:18.120 --> 06:44:27.000
uh are there any other questions comments any further discussion from members of the board

06:44:27.720 --> 06:44:32.360
before we solicit a motion member burr you look like you're

06:44:34.600 --> 06:44:39.560
gearing up to say something no well i'm ready to make a motion if you're ready for that i just

06:44:39.560 --> 06:44:44.680
don't want to shut down discussion okay now i think i think this is a good time for a motion

06:44:44.680 --> 06:44:52.120
okay um so i am i also going to point folks to page three of the item because i think

06:44:53.000 --> 06:44:58.520
this one is a little bit confusing not completely consistent with the way we are usually we usually

06:44:58.520 --> 06:45:03.880
hear these recommendations and act on them i think uh remember ruckers nodding her head because it

06:45:03.880 --> 06:45:09.800
did cause some confusion but the finding and recommendations i think are very clearly articulated

06:45:09.880 --> 06:45:16.440
here that the cd is making this recommendation or that we should consider that although all

06:45:16.440 --> 06:45:22.040
minimum threshold standards are met there is no compelling reason to transfer the bridge at just

06:45:22.040 --> 06:45:28.600
jefferson subdivision and further and this is what i think is important the cd finds that the

06:45:28.600 --> 06:45:34.920
approval of the transfer could promote future transfers from cochella valley based on previous

06:45:34.920 --> 06:45:41.800
efforts as larry articulated and i think we heard from cochella valley the lack of alignment

06:45:41.800 --> 06:45:46.760
among city and school district boundaries in the area which as we know exists throughout the state

06:45:46.760 --> 06:45:53.560
districts are not concurrent with cities and and this is the most compelling thing to me

06:45:54.200 --> 06:45:58.760
the racial ethnic and socioeconomic disparities between the cochella valley

06:45:59.720 --> 06:46:06.360
um school district and desert sands um so for those reasons i would move approval of the

06:46:06.360 --> 06:46:12.040
department's recommendation that the board the state board reverse the action of the county

06:46:12.040 --> 06:46:18.760
committee to approve the proposal to transfer territory thank you do i have a second

06:46:21.400 --> 06:46:28.280

Yes. Vice President Strauss.

06:54:32.360 --> 06:54:33.720
Yes. Member Son.

06:54:34.760 --> 06:54:37.720
Yes. Motion passes.

06:54:37.720 --> 06:54:46.120
Okay. So we're going to invite state board members to report on any liaison activities

06:54:46.120 --> 06:54:52.280
that are not related to any items on our agenda. Let us begin by calling on board members

06:54:54.280 --> 06:54:59.160
based on we're going to go back to reverse order and start with member Son.

06:55:00.120 --> 06:55:07.080
Hi. Yeah. So the California Workforce Joint Advisory Committee is meeting.

06:55:08.440 --> 06:55:13.720
Sorry. When I'm first, I don't have all my information together yet. Okay. On the 29th

06:55:13.720 --> 06:55:22.920
of September, where we will continue working on our the CTE plan for California. It's been quite

06:55:22.920 --> 06:55:27.160
a few years in the making, but I think we are starting to really get some momentum on that.

06:55:28.040 --> 06:55:34.280
I just wanted to note, too, that we have two grant application deadlines out there right now for

06:55:35.800 --> 06:55:46.680
CTE. The Strong Workforce K-12 program is the application went out on August 16th

06:55:46.680 --> 06:55:54.840
and is due by August 15th by 5 p.m. The CTIG program, there was a modification in

06:55:55.480 --> 06:56:01.960
the requirements for that program. So CTE had submitted or had released an RFA.

06:56:02.920 --> 06:56:10.520
That has been modified a bit. And so there will be out the week of September 20th. So

06:56:10.520 --> 06:56:17.240
I think next week sometime. And it will have a quick turnaround. So those who have already

06:56:17.240 --> 06:56:23.720
started applying will be notified. But just wanted to note that that application has been modified a

06:56:23.720 --> 06:56:32.440
bit. And there will be that the next due date will be October 15th. And I think that was all I

06:56:32.440 --> 06:56:38.920
had. There's a number of charter didn't have really any charter items in this on this meeting,

06:56:38.920 --> 06:56:46.040
but there are a number of charter issues and that we're having conversations that we're having with

06:56:46.040 --> 06:56:51.320
especially with regards to non-site based and independent study of laws and how that applies

06:56:51.320 --> 06:56:59.640
and works with charter schools. And I think that is all I have. All right. Vice President Strauss.

06:56:59.640 --> 06:57:04.920
So I'll just follow up. I have a couple things to talk about and thank President Darling-Hammond

06:57:04.920 --> 06:57:08.680
for reminding people at the beginning of the meeting that we are recruiting for a bunch of

06:57:08.680 --> 06:57:13.480
our commissions for the Instructional Quality Commission, for the Advisory Commission on

06:57:13.480 --> 06:57:18.760
Charter Schools and the California Practitioners Advisory Group. We are looking for a lot of

06:57:18.760 --> 06:57:23.640
different people and then for the student board member as well as the student member of IQC.

06:57:24.200 --> 06:57:30.120
So please, if you know people who would really help and serve, have a strong voice that would

06:57:30.120 --> 06:57:35.960
help us and inform and advise the board. I just encourage you to reach out. The applications are

06:57:35.960 --> 06:57:41.720
due later this month. The screening committee already has the dates for screening and interviews

06:57:41.720 --> 06:57:47.480
and we plan to bring our recommendations to the board at the November board meeting. Also,

06:57:47.640 --> 06:57:52.760
IQC had a actually pretty quick public hearing on the World Languages and Arts Education

06:57:52.760 --> 06:57:56.680
Instructional Materials Adoptions. A couple of my colleagues, Member Glover Woods and Member

06:57:56.680 --> 06:58:02.120
Rucker also heard that, so we might be able to make a few comments on that. The Advisory Commission

06:58:02.120 --> 06:58:08.840
on Special Education, you know, our item today talked about the need for inclusive practices

06:58:08.840 --> 06:58:14.200
and the Advisory Commission recognized the Orange County Special Ed Preschool Program

06:58:14.200 --> 06:58:20.280
for an incredible model of inclusive practices. So I just think it's wonderful to see these great

06:58:20.280 --> 06:58:25.720
programs that are actually implementing what our vision is for student engagement and inclusive

06:58:25.720 --> 06:58:31.640
practices and improving for all. They're really sharing. They had a wonderful early childhood

06:58:31.640 --> 06:58:36.600
program. I just wanted to acknowledge that as well. There was the state budget update which you

06:58:36.600 --> 06:58:42.120
heard Director Calamese list all the money that's being invested in special education.

06:58:42.440 --> 06:58:49.960
The State Superintendent Thurmond was present at AXE and did engage with the members on a variety

06:58:49.960 --> 06:58:54.760
of issues. It was very, very helpful and I think much appreciated. So there's two different reports.

06:58:55.880 --> 06:59:02.280
One, the Special Education Funding and Governance Report update which CDE had contact with the West

06:59:02.280 --> 06:59:09.240
Ed to look at improvements to ensure transparency. There's a lot of systemic work that's necessary.

06:59:09.320 --> 06:59:14.040
They talked a lot about inclusive vision and communication. Some key takeaways

06:59:16.200 --> 06:59:20.280
on the need for longevity of teachers and instructional staff and administrators,

06:59:20.280 --> 06:59:24.920
which those of us who try to lead improvement in schools know that that's really important.

06:59:24.920 --> 06:59:32.040
There's a report. That report will go to the legislature in November and really had some

06:59:32.040 --> 06:59:39.480
focus on aligning the roles of self as in county offices and reducing redundancy. So I'm sure we'll

06:59:39.480 --> 06:59:45.320
hear more after that goes to legislature. A second report was on the IEP and alternative

06:59:45.320 --> 06:59:50.920
diploma work group update. That report is actually going to the legislature in October.

06:59:50.920 --> 06:59:58.120
They had a number of recommendations on ways to improve the IEP process, the template,

06:59:58.200 --> 07:00:02.920
training. So we'll hear a lot more about that. But again, this work group did a lot of work.

07:00:02.920 --> 07:00:07.960
If you're interested, you can go to the AXE link and watch that meeting. I think you'll find it

07:00:07.960 --> 07:00:15.400
very, very helpful. And then the last comment was that NASB, which is the National Association

07:00:15.400 --> 07:00:21.320
of State School Boards, which many of us were part of, has office hours. And actually they had

07:00:21.640 --> 07:00:28.280
an input session on September 2nd of which there was a guidance for how to use ESSER funds. And

07:00:28.280 --> 07:00:33.560
there was some highlights of LPI's work, which I thought was actually quite helpful. I wanted to

07:00:33.560 --> 07:00:38.280
comment that because as people think about how to use these funds, I think the guidance is quite

07:00:38.280 --> 07:00:45.400
helpful. And so I did want to share that as well. And they talked a lot about how state boards of

07:00:45.400 --> 07:00:50.920
education can help school districts in the year going forward. So I think that that was really

07:00:50.920 --> 07:00:56.280
quite helpful. So that ends my report. Thank you. Terrific. Thank you. Member Rucker.

07:00:56.920 --> 07:01:02.600
I want to thank Board Member Sun for her report about the California Workforce Pathways Joint

07:01:02.600 --> 07:01:08.280
Advisory Committee. And I also want to thank Member Strauss for her report about the IQC.

07:01:09.160 --> 07:01:15.480
I'm just going to report about the Military Interstate Children's Compact. While the board

07:01:15.480 --> 07:01:22.040
was meeting today, a component project of that collaboration was also having a meeting.

07:01:22.040 --> 07:01:26.760
And this is a picture of me being in two places at once. I think that's the reason why

07:01:26.760 --> 07:01:32.680
I suddenly felt energetic right after our break, Dr. Darlena. Today's meeting focused on continuing

07:01:32.680 --> 07:01:39.320
issues related to the special education system of support for military connected children. I also

07:01:39.320 --> 07:01:45.880
want to note that the California State Compact submitted an end of the year report earlier this

07:01:45.880 --> 07:01:52.120
month. There were multiple accomplishments noted in the annual report. Activities listed included

07:01:52.120 --> 07:02:01.160
the fact that the State Council met four times this year. Also that the panel attended and supported

07:02:01.800 --> 07:02:07.400
multiple presentations virtually about the pandemic and the impact on schools.

07:02:07.400 --> 07:02:12.840
There have been multiple training activities and workshops provided for the Interstate Compact that

07:02:12.840 --> 07:02:18.360
took place six times. School personnel from highly impacted areas were invited to the trainings that

07:02:18.360 --> 07:02:25.880
were held between January and May. We also had created a lot of new positive professional

07:02:25.880 --> 07:02:30.520
relationships with multiple organizations including the Coast Guard, the Governor's

07:02:30.520 --> 07:02:36.760
Military Advisory Council, the Space Force, the National Guard, the California Reserve Forces,

07:02:36.760 --> 07:02:41.880
NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, the Military Child Education

07:02:41.880 --> 07:02:48.360
Coalition, and multiple MICC 3 Compacts from around the country. It's also worth noting,

07:02:48.360 --> 07:02:53.720
and I did report on this earlier, the Department of Education and the State Superintendent have

07:02:53.720 --> 07:02:59.240
approved and adopted the Purple Star School Recognition Program. I reported on that back in

07:02:59.240 --> 07:03:07.880
the summer. The first schools and districts will be announced in 2022. I also do want to report

07:03:07.880 --> 07:03:13.720
that the Department of Education has increased its support to the Compact and accountability

07:03:13.720 --> 07:03:19.720
to the public by updating the Military Family Support webpage and providing digital resources

07:03:19.720 --> 07:03:27.080
to schools, families, and the public. That ends my report. Awesome. Member Rodriguez.

07:03:28.040 --> 07:03:34.040
Yes, thank you. All right. So even though the August Commission for Teacher Credentialing

07:03:34.040 --> 07:03:42.600
meeting was light, there were very meaty items on the agenda. The CTC adopted the SMRs,

07:03:42.600 --> 07:03:47.720
the Subject Matter Requirements for Art, Music, and Multiple Subjects Subtest 3,

07:03:47.720 --> 07:03:53.880
to align with the California Art Standards for Public Schools approved by this body in 2019.

07:03:54.680 --> 07:04:05.080
The RECA was discussed, and there continue to be concerns remaining, the pass rates,

07:04:05.080 --> 07:04:10.760
especially for teachers of color, and there is a need to have the assessment updated.

07:04:12.440 --> 07:04:18.920
As CTC does with all assessments, one of the things that Director Sandy said,

07:04:19.000 --> 07:04:24.520
that doesn't mean that the test is lacking in validity or reliability at the moment,

07:04:24.520 --> 07:04:30.120
it just needs to be brought up to date. So it's not irrelevant, and I'm quoting her,

07:04:30.120 --> 07:04:35.160
it needs to be brought into its next iteration to address the needs of the current concepts of

07:04:35.160 --> 07:04:42.040
literacy with regard to our English language learners and English language arts. Staff is

07:04:42.040 --> 07:04:47.720
closely examining the specifications of this assessment. It will take at least a year to

07:04:47.720 --> 07:04:55.000
develop new requirements. There are new frameworks. The CTC staff now has a lot of experience

07:04:55.000 --> 07:05:00.520
and knowledge developing performance assessments, and the minimum time required for these

07:05:00.520 --> 07:05:09.000
assessments is two years. So there's a 2025 projected update for the RECA. CTC staff is

07:05:09.000 --> 07:05:17.640
incredibly appreciative for the inclusion of $2 million in the 2021-22 Governor's State Budget,

07:05:17.720 --> 07:05:23.720
for a complete review and revision of the RECA. Staff will develop a statement of work for a new

07:05:23.720 --> 07:05:33.880
contract, and without these funds, this could not have been possible. On August 31st, CTC leadership

07:05:34.440 --> 07:05:40.440
attended the Universal Transitional Kindergarten, UTK, I knew that was going to happen,

07:05:40.440 --> 07:05:45.640
design team launch meeting. The meeting discussed the planned collaborative efforts

07:05:46.520 --> 07:05:52.840
across multiple agencies to prepare and promote implementation of the UTK state effort,

07:05:53.880 --> 07:06:01.400
and also looking for applicants to fill a vacancy for the public member position

07:06:01.400 --> 07:06:07.400
on the Committee of Credentials. The application can be found on the Committee of Credentials page,

07:06:08.600 --> 07:06:14.440
and the final filing date is September 15th. So if you know any public members, this is

07:06:15.080 --> 07:06:20.680
truly a labor of love, and it's incredibly important work that the Committee of Credentials does.

07:06:22.600 --> 07:06:28.840
And then my next and final update. The summer session ended for the California Summer School

07:06:28.840 --> 07:06:36.600
for the Arts. Congratulations Class of 2021. It was very exciting because the students

07:06:37.000 --> 07:06:45.240
had this amazing program, and it was all online, and their commitment didn't falter. They continued

07:06:45.240 --> 07:06:53.640
working hard. The CSSA Foundation supported students by providing rental laptops for those

07:06:53.640 --> 07:06:58.520
who had technology needs. So thank you to the Foundation for their support. They were really

07:06:58.520 --> 07:07:05.240
happy that they were returned in great condition. The executive directors in the third round of

07:07:05.880 --> 07:07:10.680
negotiations with CalArts for the summer school site, which is where they've always been, but

07:07:10.680 --> 07:07:16.440
there's a little bit of an increase in price, and they're hoping that they can make it happen.

07:07:18.280 --> 07:07:27.080
The diversity and inclusion subcommittee will meet at the end of this month to strategize outreach,

07:07:28.760 --> 07:07:34.280
and a student satisfaction survey will be shared in October with the trustees,

07:07:34.280 --> 07:07:41.640
and I will pass it on to board members. And lastly, Matthew Gallagher, the executive director,

07:07:41.640 --> 07:07:47.880
is working on a data dashboard to collect relevant data. It's a longitudinal six-year history,

07:07:47.880 --> 07:07:52.120
although he's relatively new. I don't even know that he's been there for a year yet,

07:07:52.840 --> 07:07:57.960
and it includes information on feeder schools, race, ethnicity statistics, admission data,

07:07:57.960 --> 07:08:03.960
and more. His hope is that this information will be useful as we strategize throughout

07:08:03.960 --> 07:08:11.000
the school year ahead. So thank you. And I would also like to say that a big shout out to

07:08:11.000 --> 07:08:19.560
my students who are walking with their masks in 113-degree heat, and they are not complaining,

07:08:19.560 --> 07:08:25.240
and they are walking like almost half a mile from my class to other classes, and they come in and

07:08:25.240 --> 07:08:34.600
their old faces are sweating, and they just sit down and are absolute troopers. And we've been

07:08:34.600 --> 07:08:41.160
doing this for a month and a half now, so I'm waiting for cooler weather. So thank you.

07:08:43.160 --> 07:08:46.520
That's awesome. Member Patio-Bronson.

07:08:46.520 --> 07:08:54.600
I'm going to build off of the last report and share a little bit about the

07:08:55.320 --> 07:09:04.680
UPK Constellation Group that the Department of Education has been convening. They are basically

07:09:04.680 --> 07:09:12.360
looking at the implementation roadmap and have convened a number of design teams to look at

07:09:12.360 --> 07:09:19.240
local implementation and promising practices, research, workforce development, and then also

07:09:20.120 --> 07:09:27.880
partnerships, which is the design team that I'll be supporting the liaison work with the state board.

07:09:29.320 --> 07:09:37.480
In addition, the early childhood policy council met twice earlier this month. The first was around

07:09:38.040 --> 07:09:44.280
shared services, which is sort of back-end function sharing among the CBO

07:09:44.840 --> 07:09:51.320
organizations that provide that pipeline into Pre-K and eventually TK and the K-12 system.

07:09:52.360 --> 07:09:58.360
And then the most recent early childhood policy council meeting focused on racial equity,

07:09:58.360 --> 07:10:03.480
which was very exciting and actually had a lot of alignment with our conversation today.

07:10:04.360 --> 07:10:11.160
We heard from Dr. Lee about equity in early education and the Department of Education plans

07:10:11.160 --> 07:10:17.160
to bring that into the fold in terms of community schools, in terms of behavioral health,

07:10:18.040 --> 07:10:28.200
and of course, obviously UTK. And I think that's it. Otherwise, I just want to say happy

07:10:28.200 --> 07:10:30.120
California admissions day, belatedly.

07:10:32.680 --> 07:10:35.480
Anyone else who's got school children who celebrated that holiday?

07:10:36.520 --> 07:10:39.320
There you go. Member McQuillin.

07:10:40.280 --> 07:10:49.240
All right. Not a whole lot to report on. I do also serve on the California Joint Pathways

07:10:50.280 --> 07:10:56.520
Committee for Career Technical Education. I was asked to give some recommendations

07:10:57.480 --> 07:11:04.840
of folks who can serve on focus groups because they're developing the plan, the California

07:11:04.840 --> 07:11:11.080
statewide plan. So we came up with quite a number of folks that could give a voice to

07:11:12.120 --> 07:11:17.480
American Indian tribes of California, as well as rural communities, rural counties,

07:11:18.120 --> 07:11:25.480
to give a voice to these focus groups that's on a short turnaround over the next couple of months

07:11:25.480 --> 07:11:33.880
to develop this California-wide plan. So tribes have something called tarot offices,

07:11:33.880 --> 07:11:41.160
or tribal employment rights offices, and they develop lots of different career pathways for

07:11:41.160 --> 07:11:47.560
tribal members throughout Northern California. So some of those officers were recommended to

07:11:47.560 --> 07:11:54.280
serve on the committee to come up with the plan and have a voice.

07:11:55.480 --> 07:11:58.680
That was good for me. And that's it. Thank you.

07:11:59.400 --> 07:12:01.880
Terrific. Member Glover Woods.

07:12:03.320 --> 07:12:08.760
Thank you. And thanks to Vice President Strauss for talking about the IQC and the

07:12:09.480 --> 07:12:13.400
World Languages Public Hearing and also what's coming up for the screening committee.

07:12:13.400 --> 07:12:18.760
I have just one other item to share with everyone today, and that's in regards to the virtual

07:12:18.840 --> 07:12:27.240
convening that took place last month on P3 STEM policy. The Education Commission of the States

07:12:27.240 --> 07:12:35.480
did convene that gathering in August, and I had an opportunity to engage in conversation with

07:12:35.480 --> 07:12:42.360
educators from across the state, Tennessee, Colorado, Arkansas, and as participants we also

07:12:42.360 --> 07:12:48.680
had educators from Georgia, Michigan, Vermont, and Virginia. The topic, again, was how to ensure

07:12:48.680 --> 07:12:55.800
that robust STEM instruction takes place for our younger learners and how to make sure that

07:12:55.800 --> 07:13:01.240
that doesn't put on the bath burner as students return to in-person instruction and we really

07:13:01.240 --> 07:13:06.360
focus on accelerating learning. So it was very robust. A couple of thoughts that came through

07:13:06.360 --> 07:13:13.320
was just the necessity and importance of networking professionals that are working in that area,

07:13:13.960 --> 07:13:19.720
especially for those that are in smaller areas and rural areas, and also ensuring, again,

07:13:19.720 --> 07:13:25.320
just professional learning support and keeping the authenticity with STEM instruction. So that was

07:13:25.320 --> 07:13:32.520
quite exciting, and thank you for allowing me to share today. That's wonderful. We'll go to Member

07:13:32.520 --> 07:13:40.440
Burr. Thank you. Because I wasn't here in July, I didn't have the opportunity to congratulate

07:13:41.000 --> 07:13:48.280
Matt Navo on being selected as executive director for the CCE. I think all of you who had the

07:13:48.280 --> 07:13:54.360
pleasure of working with Matt on the board know how fortunate we are to have an educational leader

07:13:54.360 --> 07:14:00.600
of his stature to take over the organization. It probably also won't surprise you that he's only

07:14:00.600 --> 07:14:05.720
been on board a few weeks, and he's already met with over 50 of our educational partners

07:14:06.840 --> 07:14:14.120
to learn more about what our organization, CCE, can do with those educational partners to help

07:14:14.120 --> 07:14:20.760
support learning in all of our schools. And I especially want to thank, on behalf of Matt,

07:14:20.760 --> 07:14:25.880
and I said this this morning, the cooperation and collaboration with the Department of Education is

07:14:25.880 --> 07:14:31.480
absolutely critical, as is the collaboration with the county offices of education. So,

07:14:32.520 --> 07:14:38.120
just a big appreciation to all of those folks. And as we also heard this morning, Matt's busy

07:14:38.120 --> 07:14:45.160
building his leadership team, which will now include Dr. Gregson as the deputy executive director

07:14:45.160 --> 07:14:50.040
of the collaborative. I just want to highlight two pieces of work by the collaborative.

07:14:50.520 --> 07:14:56.680
The playbook for accelerated learning is out and available on their website. If you haven't seen it

07:14:56.680 --> 07:15:03.160
yet, I encourage you to take a look at it. It lays out current research on how best to improve

07:15:03.160 --> 07:15:09.320
student outcomes, identifies models that practitioners can use to accelerate learning in

07:15:09.320 --> 07:15:15.560
their systems, and proposes ways in which they can plan with their teams. And it suggests ways

07:15:15.720 --> 07:15:20.360
and it suggests ways in which LEAs can leverage community-based organizations

07:15:21.080 --> 07:15:27.960
and engage families as partners in this work. Related to that, the state budget included funding

07:15:27.960 --> 07:15:35.160
for learning acceleration grants, and the CCE, in collaboration with our administrative partner,

07:15:35.160 --> 07:15:43.000
Marin County Office of Education, has issued an RFP for those grants, and they will be holding a

07:15:43.960 --> 07:15:52.040
webinar tomorrow, Friday, September 10th, from 1130 to 1215, to provide an overview of the

07:15:52.040 --> 07:15:59.560
requirements. Specifically, these grants will provide professional learning for educators

07:15:59.560 --> 07:16:04.600
to support, again, learning acceleration, particularly in mathematics, literacy, and

07:16:04.600 --> 07:16:10.040
language development. So I encourage you to get the word out. People who are listening, please

07:16:11.000 --> 07:16:16.920
sign up for the webinar on the CCE's website. And the last thing I'll say back to the leadership

07:16:16.920 --> 07:16:25.800
transition is to say, express my deep appreciation to Tom Armalino, who retired and served the CCE

07:16:25.800 --> 07:16:31.960
with great distinction. At our next board meeting, which is October 28th, we will have a little

07:16:31.960 --> 07:16:38.120
celebration of Tom's leadership. So I hope everybody will tune in. Thank you. Thank you.

07:16:38.840 --> 07:16:41.480
And member Badanka.

07:16:45.160 --> 07:16:51.560
Yeah, so recently I've been publicizing the student board member recruitment for the 2022

07:16:51.560 --> 07:16:56.920
to 2023 position. So I'm currently working with Generation Up to publicize it through their social

07:16:56.920 --> 07:17:03.320
media accounts. Additionally, I'm working with the California Association of Student Councils

07:17:03.400 --> 07:17:10.440
to begin the preparations for the SABE conference, which will be held from October 30th to November

07:17:10.440 --> 07:17:15.960
1st, where we will be narrowing down the semi-finalist group of potential student

07:17:15.960 --> 07:17:21.160
board members to a finalist group. And then finally, before the school year began, I collaborated

07:17:21.160 --> 07:17:26.920
with Superintendent Thurman to moderate a webinar aimed at promoting vaccine awareness among students

07:17:26.920 --> 07:17:32.520
and discussing essentially what a safe return to campus would look like. And that'll be all.

07:17:33.720 --> 07:17:40.600
That's terrific. You're off to a roaring start. I love it. And I'll just add a few of my own

07:17:40.600 --> 07:17:47.400
comments. You know, in the summertime, there's a lot of important business that the state

07:17:47.400 --> 07:17:52.520
board gets involved in. Of course, you heard about the state budget when it was passed

07:17:52.520 --> 07:17:59.080
and the additional $20 billion that the governor and the legislature allocated for a variety of

07:17:59.080 --> 07:18:05.240
really important programs. So state board staff, and I want to particularly recognize Brooks Allen

07:18:05.240 --> 07:18:11.960
and, of course, all the staff who work with him, have been busy not only moving those programs

07:18:11.960 --> 07:18:16.440
forward and thinking about implementation with the department, particularly around TK and

07:18:16.440 --> 07:18:20.840
particularly around community schools, some of the big investments that are coming that really will

07:18:20.840 --> 07:18:27.000
reshape the nature of the public school system in California. Many, many details to be worked on.

07:18:27.560 --> 07:18:31.400
But also the trailer bill, which, you know, has just been announced this week,

07:18:32.360 --> 07:18:40.120
you know, clarifying and extending some of those initial parts of the budget. You know,

07:18:40.120 --> 07:18:47.240
we've been working hard on safe school reopening, as I mentioned earlier, all of the policy elements

07:18:47.240 --> 07:18:53.160
that lead to, you know, the excellent work IDAY students are doing wearing their masks.

07:18:54.120 --> 07:18:58.920
Recognize that on behalf of all the students in California and Ronna, I'm sure that you are in

07:18:58.920 --> 07:19:04.840
that number and all of your classmates. The vaccinating that is going on around the state,

07:19:04.840 --> 07:19:11.000
the schools that are taking up the testing programs that the state's been offering, the

07:19:12.120 --> 07:19:19.800
SWIFT, the team that responds to concerns from local schools when there are needs for more

07:19:19.800 --> 07:19:24.040
testing, more vaccinating. So all of that has been going on this summer. So it's been a very,

07:19:24.040 --> 07:19:29.960
very busy summer. I think, you know, the state board staff along with the CDE staff have been

07:19:29.960 --> 07:19:36.760
just critical to the position we find ourselves in today, which is, well, one that has a lot of

07:19:38.440 --> 07:19:43.400
challenge and complexity to it also has gotten us off to a really good start. I just

07:19:43.400 --> 07:19:48.840
saw come across the transom and announcement in the papers that SFUSD announced this afternoon

07:19:48.840 --> 07:19:54.040
that there have been zero outbreaks or transmissions in schools since they've been

07:19:54.040 --> 07:20:00.120
going. And we, you know, see this happening in our districts across the state because they're

07:20:00.120 --> 07:20:07.080
taking advantage of all of the supports that have been made available. So we're all thrilled about

07:20:07.080 --> 07:20:13.320
that. I just want to both thank all the people who have made it possible and encourage everyone to

07:20:13.320 --> 07:20:20.440
keep up the good work so that at our next meeting, we can really be even happier about how healthy

07:20:21.240 --> 07:20:26.840
our state is and how successful the start of school has been for all of our students.

07:20:27.960 --> 07:20:33.400
And with that, I'm going to move to taking up agenda item number 10, which is general public

07:20:33.400 --> 07:20:39.880
comment, which is invited on any matter not included on the printed agenda. And we'll open

07:20:39.880 --> 07:20:45.640
the phone line for the public comment queue. Once again, members of the public wishing to provide

07:20:45.640 --> 07:20:51.640
comment on this item may do so by calling the number shown on the public comment slide and

07:20:51.640 --> 07:20:56.840
using the access code that is there. And we're going to have a little wait time because there

07:20:56.840 --> 07:21:05.880
is a lag for folks who are trying to call in. So we'll give it a minute to see if there is any

07:21:05.880 --> 07:21:10.680
public comment. And if you do call in, we urge you to state your name and affiliation for the record.

07:21:11.240 --> 07:21:15.240
Remember to turn down the volume on your computer if you're following the live feed

07:21:15.800 --> 07:21:22.040
and speakers will be limited to one minute each. Are there any further public comments?

07:21:22.040 --> 07:21:25.080
Yes, we do have public comment. All right.

07:21:29.720 --> 07:21:33.720
Hello, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one

07:21:33.720 --> 07:21:40.840
minute. Your time begins now. Thank you for the opportunity, Lourdes Medina,

07:21:41.800 --> 07:21:46.120
resident of the Central Valley, parent of freshman Uniswap District students,

07:21:47.720 --> 07:21:54.680
honorable board members and committee. This year has been a trying one for all of us.

07:21:54.680 --> 07:22:00.040
Understanding the pandemic obviously has not prepared us or anyone with what's going on.

07:22:00.040 --> 07:22:05.880
I would just ask for us to be more inclusive of communities who are not fluent in English

07:22:06.600 --> 07:22:12.920
and who do not have the resources or the community system to reach out for help.

07:22:15.000 --> 07:22:19.720
Unfortunately, in the Central Valley with the IAS and dependent studies,

07:22:19.720 --> 07:22:24.600
this has been quite an ordeal for our community. They want the well-being of their children.

07:22:24.600 --> 07:22:29.320
They want them to be educated and they want to follow the rules and the recommendations

07:22:29.320 --> 07:22:33.800
from the state and the government. However, they're not being addressed. They're not being

07:22:33.800 --> 07:22:40.200
helped nationally, not locally, and definitely not through the media. I would suggest and I

07:22:40.200 --> 07:22:50.840
would urge for this board to seek to promote more Spanish language media via video, social media,

07:22:51.880 --> 07:22:55.720
so that they can help them understand better independent studies.

07:22:55.720 --> 07:23:00.600
Thank you so much for that comment. Are there any others?

07:23:02.600 --> 07:23:03.480
There are no others.

07:23:05.640 --> 07:23:13.080
All right. With that close of public comments, I will hereby adjourn our September 2021 State

07:23:13.080 --> 07:23:22.040
Board of Education meeting at 4.52 p.m. Good work. Catch yourselves on the back. We'll see you soon.

07:23:22.760 --> 07:23:24.600
Thank you. Bye, everyone.

07:23:27.000 --> 07:23:28.440
Bye, everyone. Have a great day.

07:23:28.440 --> 07:23:30.680
Bye. Take care.
