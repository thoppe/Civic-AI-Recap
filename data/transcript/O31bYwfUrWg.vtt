WEBVTT

00:00.569 --> 00:09.194
All right, I now call the November 6th, 2019 meeting of the State Board of Education to order.

00:10.054 --> 00:11.815
We'll commence by saluting the flag.

00:12.215 --> 00:14.977
Vice President Strauss, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:15.477 --> 00:16.537
Right hand over your heart.

00:17.578 --> 00:17.838
Ready?

00:18.378 --> 00:18.759
Begin.

00:19.439 --> 00:25.162
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic

00:29.625 --> 00:32.486
indivisible with liberty and justice for all.

00:33.947 --> 00:39.589
Okay, I am going to wait and do the public announcements when the public comes in.

00:39.669 --> 00:42.191
So the board will now go into closed session.

00:44.011 --> 00:47.813
Right, and we'll take action on the following litigation, which is L.A.T.

00:48.693 --> 00:50.314
versus the state.

00:50.474 --> 00:56.757
And I ask any members of the public who happen to be here to please clear out of the boardroom and turn off the microphones.

01:03.889 --> 01:04.570
Okay.

01:06.951 --> 01:10.113
I'm going to ask everyone to find a seat if you can find one.

01:10.733 --> 01:14.035
There are a few in the front, but those might be safe for the staff.

01:14.235 --> 01:15.016
I'm not sure.

01:17.137 --> 01:19.259
And so that we can get ready to begin.

01:19.279 --> 01:31.506
Okay, we're reconvening the November 6, 2019 meeting of the State Board.

01:34.332 --> 01:36.874
And I'm now going to instruct you on what's going to happen today.

01:38.495 --> 01:43.739
There is one public hearing on a November agenda, item 8, which will be heard later today.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.984
There's a handout on the table in the lobby identifying the proposed items on the consent calendars.

01:50.604 --> 01:54.427
The proposed regular consent items are items 10 through 14.

01:55.048 --> 01:58.110
The proposed consent waiver items are 1 through 7.

02:00.752 --> 02:10.561
I'd like to remind board members that any members wishing to remove any items from the proposed consent calendars Please advise our executive directors Karen staff Walters by 10 a.m.

02:10.641 --> 02:16.446
Today We will take up the waiver My mic is on

02:19.653 --> 02:23.634
We will take up the waiver consent items and the regular consent items later this afternoon.

02:23.654 --> 02:29.536
In terms of public input, speakers should sign in at the table just outside the room.

02:30.096 --> 02:33.337
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each item number.

02:33.977 --> 02:41.879
Signing in on the page that identifies the item number on which they would like to speak will help ensure that we keep track of all the speakers for a particular item.

02:42.819 --> 02:52.224
Item 16 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on items that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

02:52.985 --> 02:55.626
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker.

02:56.226 --> 03:06.212
In order to ensure that everyone gets their one minute, there is a timer at the podium that will flash a red signal to each speaker when the one minute time limit has been reached.

03:07.552 --> 03:20.877
This is we are seeking again this month to do a one-day board meeting We're getting into a new habit perhaps But that means we have a very very tight time frame.

03:21.318 --> 03:24.559
We're aiming at this point to finish by 6 p.m.

03:25.159 --> 03:33.683
And your participation in moving the meeting along will enable us to meet or exceed that benchmark and so

03:35.263 --> 03:38.545
I want to encourage you to each take your own breaks whenever you need one.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.005
We'll do the same.

03:40.025 --> 03:47.628
We're going to work through lunch, and people will be sort of given permission one at a time to get their lunches so that we maintain a quorum.

03:49.089 --> 03:55.552
I will need to be out for a bit after 1130, so Vice President Strauss will take the reins for part of the meeting.

03:56.012 --> 04:01.034
And we're moving item number five to later in the meeting just before item 15.

04:03.115 --> 04:08.338
And with those instructions, I'm going to invite State Superintendent Thurmond to provide the superintendent's report.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.940
Thank you, Madam President, members of the board.

04:14.221 --> 04:14.941
Good morning, all.

04:15.421 --> 04:20.284
It is great to welcome our Student Advisory Commission members to the chamber.

04:21.284 --> 04:23.565
You know, my first reaction is, well, why aren't they in school?

04:24.926 --> 04:26.767
But we are glad to see you here because

04:27.367 --> 04:39.640
We value civics education and your participation in your community and raising your voices on behalf of students across the state has a value to our students.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.183
It has a value for our board and the Department of Education.

04:42.723 --> 04:53.073
And we believe that it has a value for you because in some future time, many of you will be sitting on this dais or other governing bodies across the state and this nation.

04:53.493 --> 04:57.377
And so we welcome your participation and look forward to what you share today.

04:58.317 --> 05:04.123
For me, I want to share with you how proud I am of the students of California.

05:04.863 --> 05:06.085
They are very resilient.

05:06.785 --> 05:21.798
We've spent the last few weeks really being challenged by environmental challenges, wildfire winds, gusts that are up to speeds that have not been seen in recent times, power safety shutoffs that have had its own impact on our schools.

05:22.839 --> 05:30.126
Our students and educators and families have found a way to persevere in very, very, very difficult times.

05:30.586 --> 05:31.567
At one point,

05:32.767 --> 05:41.833
During the power safety shutoffs, more than 352,000 students were impacted by schools that were de-energized.

05:42.413 --> 05:49.438
Nearly 975,000 student days were impacted by de-energization.

05:50.338 --> 05:53.701
I really want to say that to put that in context of what that has meant.

05:53.801 --> 05:58.344
There are counties where almost every school needed to be closed because of fires.

05:59.024 --> 06:01.586
But in other cases, some counties found a way to stay open

06:02.026 --> 06:03.227
when they didn't have power.

06:03.588 --> 06:14.618
They use generators, they use creativity, but our students have been resilient and the focus has continued to be on providing quality instruction even during difficult times.

06:15.038 --> 06:16.720
This means that we have to think about a lot of things.

06:16.780 --> 06:19.683
How do we address lost instruction time?

06:20.083 --> 06:21.765
And we've had conversations about that.

06:22.345 --> 06:33.314
Districts have asked us to think it through with them what their school calendars look like because we know that with changing conditions and climate that we're likely to see more of the same.

06:34.114 --> 06:48.666
The staff at the Department of Education are really studying what happens in other states to see where there might be practices that we might employ and deploy in California and then make recommendations to the state board on how we think about our work going forward.

06:49.537 --> 07:06.066
Our governor and our legislature have approved putting a bond measure on the state ballot that could provide some answers for school districts on how they use alternative energy, including solar energy, to help them answer questions during times

07:07.013 --> 07:08.014
of being without power.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.838
How do we make sure that meals are secure at school?

07:13.379 --> 07:19.504
A lot of our districts saw food basically get wasted because they didn't have power to keep the food refrigerated.

07:19.965 --> 07:24.869
How do we keep our districts that are on wells able to have fresh water?

07:25.610 --> 07:27.472
How do we maintain sanitation needs?

07:27.812 --> 07:32.457
These are all the things that educators have to think about and we'll have to think about them together.

07:33.038 --> 07:37.964
Our governor has taken some leadership to address issues around our public utilities.

07:40.686 --> 07:49.350
Again, I just want to comment on the resiliency of our students and our educators in getting through these difficult times.

07:49.370 --> 07:57.894
I also want to acknowledge that some two dozen or more staff at the Department of Education have been actively involved.

07:58.534 --> 08:10.340
in the State Operations Emergency Center and really helping to have conversations about how we support students and schools and citizens who are impacted by these conditions.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.182
I want to commend all of them and thank them for their work.

08:13.883 --> 08:21.753
We'll continue to be involved with the Office of Emergency Services and others to find solutions and ways to support our schools.

08:22.273 --> 08:28.461
We engage in a conversation with most of our county superintendents to see how we can be helpful to them.

08:29.062 --> 08:31.305
The board would not be surprised that they're

08:32.566 --> 08:49.846
Their biggest question is about J-13A waivers and how their schools are going to be impacted when these closures occur because these were not planned closures and they don't quite fit the definition of a climatic response or a weather response or an emergency.

08:50.366 --> 09:00.821
And so our staff has provided them consultation on this, as well as how to make the determination of when it's not safe enough to keep your school open and how to address air quality.

09:00.841 --> 09:07.590
And so I wanted to share with you what's been happening here as it relates to weather conditions in the power safety shutoffs.

09:08.010 --> 09:19.982
I want to thank Board President Linda Darling-Hammond and others who participated in a conversation on yesterday about how we support student learning as it relates to state test scores.

09:20.683 --> 09:25.488
As you know, in the last few weeks, the cash scores have become made public.

09:27.229 --> 09:38.416
While there is some moderate growth in some areas and there are some districts that have been bright spots throughout the state, we know that our opportunity gap continues and it persists.

09:39.156 --> 09:48.722
And we want to have brave and courageous conversations about what we do to help close the gap so that all six million of our students get a great education.

09:49.449 --> 10:03.719
And on yesterday in this panel that we had, we did a deep data dive to understand the trends, to understand why the gap persists and in some cases has widened, to understand why for some groups scores decline.

10:04.799 --> 10:08.502
And we had a number of leaders and researchers.

10:08.802 --> 10:09.783
We had our board president.

10:10.163 --> 10:13.745
We had Pedro Nogueira from the UCLA School of Education.

10:14.386 --> 10:17.508
We had Joe Johnson, who is the executive director of the National Center

10:18.012 --> 10:29.016
for urban school transformation, some leaders from Ed Trust West, a number of folks who really could dig into the data to help us find the reasons for the trends.

10:29.476 --> 10:38.179
What we see often is that in the elementary school grades, there are inclines, but what we find is in the higher grades, sometimes we see declines.

10:38.699 --> 10:49.876
And we want to make sure that we're doing all we can to support all of our students, African American students, Latino students, English learners, students with disabilities, API students, students from low income backgrounds.

10:49.996 --> 10:54.103
We want to give every student a chance at a great education and a chance at a great life.

10:54.763 --> 10:57.724
And a lot of great conversations emerged.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.585
What do we do to provide more training and professional development for our staff?

11:02.106 --> 11:10.668
How do we make implicit bias training and unconscious bias training more part of our practice in preparing our students for the future?

11:11.048 --> 11:18.711
How do we close our teacher shortage and make sure that we have teachers who are prepared to support our students and have the right training and the support?

11:19.431 --> 11:21.992
How do we address leadership at every level of the school?

11:22.152 --> 11:29.476
Our president talked about on average, superintendents stay at a district only 19 months.

11:29.936 --> 11:36.059
With that kind of churn in leadership, we are seeing trends of fatigue for our educators.

11:36.079 --> 11:40.761
We're figuring out what initiatives are we working on and how do we make the most impact for our students?

11:41.181 --> 11:51.965
It was a very fruitful conversation and is part of an ongoing series that we really have made our future interests at the Department of Education, what we're going to do to close the achievement gap.

11:52.065 --> 12:03.169
We welcome input from the state board members on that and just know that we are working to align all of our efforts at the Department of Education to be focused on how we close the gap.

12:03.869 --> 12:11.233
I wanted to also just share that we've had an opportunity to have that conversation with most of the staff at the Department of Education on last week.

12:11.253 --> 12:23.819
We hosted an all staff meeting here in Sacramento and just over 900 staff members in one place to have the conversation about how we align our efforts in closing the achievement gap.

12:24.492 --> 12:30.114
I mentioned in closing that we look forward to our STEAM symposium in December.

12:30.654 --> 12:36.476
This is one of our major professional development opportunities provided for educators in the space of STEAM.

12:37.176 --> 12:43.779
Registration is now open for that event, which will take place on December 9th and 10th in Anaheim.

12:44.559 --> 12:50.021
This year, we welcome legendary Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

12:51.442 --> 12:53.644
I'm a Warriors fan, but anyway, I digress.

12:55.986 --> 13:12.339
To be one of our guests, Mr. Abdul-Jabbar has become a spokesperson for expanding STEAM education for our students across the state, and we're very excited to have his presence and to help lift up that conversation at the STEAM Symposium.

13:12.379 --> 13:19.184
So know that registration is open, that we look forward to your participation, and we look forward to the remarks from our students today.

13:19.224 --> 13:20.065
This concludes my report.

13:23.506 --> 13:31.571
Well, as State Superintendent Thurman has noted, over the last few weeks, we've seen a series of devastating fires in northern and southern California.

13:31.811 --> 13:40.816
And this month also marks the one-year anniversary of both the Camp Fire and Woolsey fires, which ravaged the community of Paradise and areas of Ventura County.

13:41.596 --> 13:45.859
Last month marked the two-year anniversary of the Tubbs Fire in Napa and Sonoma counties.

13:46.759 --> 13:57.469
And these fires and other disasters related to climate change, as the superintendent noted, have a devastating effect on our schools and our educators and our students.

13:58.770 --> 14:07.998
And so I'm going to take this opportunity to recognize some civic engagement on the part of students who are really dealing very proactively with climate change.

14:08.118 --> 14:11.902
It's not only an existential threat, but also a threat to our ability

14:12.242 --> 14:15.844
to provide safe and healthy learning environments for our students.

14:16.304 --> 14:23.988
We have with us today middle school students and others from Schools for Climate Action, a grassroots organization in Sonoma County.

14:24.448 --> 14:30.311
And in just a moment, I'll invite these students and their teacher, Park Guthrie, to come forward to be recognized.

14:30.791 --> 14:32.632
But first, I'll just tell you a little about them.

14:33.192 --> 14:39.916
Schools for Climate Action is working to empower educators, students, and elected officials to speak up about climate change.

14:40.456 --> 14:48.721
Because of School for Climate Action's advocacy on this critical issue, more than 100 educational organizations have passed climate change resolutions.

14:49.501 --> 15:00.107
The work of this group dovetails with the state's work to improve the quality of science education and environmental literacy so students become engaged in issues surrounding the national world.

15:01.088 --> 15:14.923
You may remember that the next generation science standards adopted in 2013 are designed to help students become critical thinkers who can analyze the many ways that humans impact this planet that we all share and draw their own independent conclusions.

15:15.444 --> 15:30.014
We've been pushing a shift towards inquiry-based instruction to give students the skills that they need to learn and care about environmental issues so that students can develop curiosity, analyze and evaluate information in seeking answers.

15:30.174 --> 15:35.078
We're also working to integrate environmental principles and concepts into the entire curriculum.

15:35.498 --> 15:44.745
So you'll see guidance on climate change instruction in the language arts and history, social science curriculum frameworks adopted by this board as well as in the science framework.

15:45.805 --> 15:46.945
And this is not all new.

15:47.085 --> 16:02.849
In 1996, the California Department of Education created the California Regional Environmental Education Community Network Program, which assists teachers with locating grade appropriate lesson resources, field trip opportunities for students that help students understand their local environment.

16:03.349 --> 16:07.390
So there's much work going on and more work to be done.

16:07.810 --> 16:12.811
And I'm thrilled to see so many students who are also pushing for more and better

16:13.371 --> 16:15.734
Learning and action on this front.

16:15.794 --> 16:17.155
You're very inspirational.

16:17.596 --> 16:26.846
So with that, I want to present this certificate and I'll tell you what it says to the students from schools for climate action.

16:27.847 --> 16:32.433
The California State Board of Education presents the certificate of appreciation and commendation.

16:33.173 --> 16:53.739
In honor of your contribution to the students of California, your dedication to empowering educators, students, and elected officials to speak up about climate change, we congratulate you, and we'd love to invite speakers from the Schools for Climate Action up to the podium to make a few brief comments, after which we'll get some pictures.

17:07.938 --> 17:10.100
Thank you for speaking up for climate action.

17:10.680 --> 17:15.183
It really means a lot to us that such a high-ranking education leader is speaking up for climate justice.

17:16.123 --> 17:22.187
Climate change directly affects students, so everyone, especially education leaders, should speak up to help enact change.

17:23.283 --> 17:27.624
As of the last two years, I've personally suffered four climate-related disasters.

17:28.125 --> 17:37.728
There was the Tubbs Fire in 2017, the Paradise Fire in 2018, Russian River flooding earlier this year, and most recently, the Kincaid Fire just last week.

17:38.268 --> 17:43.430
School closures due to horrible air quality and unsafe roads meant more than three weeks of school was lost.

17:44.250 --> 17:52.231
So many students in California, Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and other places experienced climate-related catastrophes each year and suffer accordingly.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.472
Congress has had the opportunity to prevent climate harm for more than three decades.

17:57.132 --> 17:58.612
They have simply chosen not to act.

17:58.973 --> 17:59.693
This is neglect.

18:00.333 --> 18:06.394
And by continuing to remain silent, most education leaders are enabling Congress to continue to neglect the climate.

18:07.034 --> 18:12.655
I hope that education leaders all over the country follow Dr. Linda Darling-Ham's example and speak up for climate justice.

18:13.095 --> 18:13.415
Thank you.

18:20.339 --> 18:21.400
Hi, my name is Juan.

18:21.540 --> 18:22.381
I'm in seventh grade.

18:22.821 --> 18:28.626
I deeply believe that everyone can and should speak up for climate justice, especially education leaders.

18:29.226 --> 18:38.574
Last December, we had a Zoom meeting with the executive director of the California Associations of School Psychologists.

18:39.394 --> 18:46.440
In just a few minutes, she told us she was interested in bringing a climate action resolution to the next board meeting.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.722
We were so excited, three months later,

18:49.122 --> 18:52.324
In March, CASP did pass a climate action resolution.

18:53.625 --> 18:57.108
It is that easy to speak up for climate justice.

18:58.088 --> 19:05.594
All education leaders, all 1,000 school boards in California can easily pass a climate resolution.

19:06.054 --> 19:13.519
If CASP and Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond have spoken up for climate justice, all education leaders can.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.141
This will send a powerful message.

19:16.582 --> 19:16.922
Thank you.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.128
My name is Sabine Wolpert.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.651
I'm in seventh grade, and climate change has been a defining element in my life.

19:28.632 --> 19:33.016
I have had countless adults praise my climate activism and tell me that my generation will be the solution.

19:33.556 --> 19:39.301
However, no one in my generation is one that has not greatly contributed to this problem, should have that weight on their shoulders.

19:40.402 --> 19:43.024
I've watched floods, droughts, and fires in a few years.

19:43.505 --> 19:48.989
I've watched education leaders claim to support my generation and then fail to change their actions, words, or principles.

19:49.946 --> 19:59.470
The American Academy of Pediatrics said in their 2015 policy statement that, quote, failure to take prompt, substantive action would be an act of injustice to all children, unquote.

19:59.910 --> 20:00.910
That was four years ago.

20:01.630 --> 20:07.613
This spiral of climate silence that includes most educational leaders is allowing national and global climate neglect.

20:08.473 --> 20:10.935
We all know that denying the climate crisis is dangerous.

20:11.416 --> 20:15.640
Members of Congress commit child neglect by understanding the consequences and still failing to act.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.902
This is an abuse of power at the very least.

20:18.702 --> 20:21.385
This is why Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond's statement is so important.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.908
All education leaders must act to help this injustice.

20:25.448 --> 20:26.569
We're calling for a change.

20:27.150 --> 20:31.033
Your words and actions now will make a difference for generations to come.

20:31.294 --> 20:31.634
Thank you.

20:37.366 --> 20:38.329
Good morning, trustees.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.415
Thank you for this opportunity to speak.

20:40.836 --> 20:41.859
My name is Lola Guthrie.

20:41.939 --> 20:44.947
I'm a sophomore at Credo High and a co-founder of Schools for Climate Action.

20:46.260 --> 20:47.060
I want to be honest.

20:47.461 --> 20:54.024
When I thought about what I might say today, I was so angry and sad that I could hardly thank adults for simply speaking up about the climate crisis.

20:54.724 --> 21:05.529
As someone who was born into a world already on its way toward disaster, it is impossible for me to imagine how adults can justify remaining silent about this while also working so hard to support students in other ways.

21:06.329 --> 21:10.371
You can't protect or support students without confronting the greatest threat of our times.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.212
I was in this room with my family exactly one year ago.

21:14.792 --> 21:18.034
We were in the midst of a climate-related wildfire then, just as we are now.

21:18.775 --> 21:23.058
We asked the California State Board of Ed to speak up for climate justice, but nothing happened.

21:24.018 --> 21:31.463
Four months later, the National School Boards Association considered a climate resolution, but they were unwilling to even use the words climate change in it.

21:32.224 --> 21:39.989
How am I supposed to have hope about the future when 90,000 school board members in the country won't even admit to the reality of this climate crisis?

21:41.161 --> 21:51.002
I have to wonder that if the California State Board of Ed had spoken up when we first asked, in November of 2017, whether the NSBA would have done the right thing and simply stated the truth.

21:52.409 --> 22:00.714
Some people hope that the NSBA will find the courage to act, but I don't think that it should take courage to simply say climate change hurts America's schools and students.

22:01.534 --> 22:04.936
Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, thank you for speaking up for climate justice.

22:05.417 --> 22:14.742
I hope that members of the California School Boards Association, National School Boards Association, and the National Association of School Psychologists will be inspired by your powerful example.

22:16.063 --> 22:17.664
There are many things I find difficult.

22:18.104 --> 22:21.726
Watching my little sister choose what to put in her evacuation bag is difficult.

22:22.458 --> 22:26.260
Driving away from my house and not knowing if it will be there when I return is difficult.

22:26.940 --> 22:31.423
Watching a fire truck pass with its sirens on and not letting panic seize my chest is difficult.

22:32.303 --> 22:36.425
But simply saying that climate change hurts students and that Congress should act is easy.

22:37.166 --> 22:42.568
All education leaders can and must take this simple step, and together it will send a powerful signal.

22:43.289 --> 22:43.589
Thank you.

22:51.750 --> 22:59.294
I appreciate the personal shout-outs, but I want to be clear that the actions I described came from this entire State Board of Education.

22:59.314 --> 23:05.857
The California Department of Education has been on this path for many years, since 1996 in fact.

23:06.637 --> 23:11.520
And so, you know, on behalf of us collectively, I want to be sure that we're recognizing

23:12.080 --> 23:19.201
the civic engagement of our students and the activism that is well called for in this arena.

23:19.942 --> 23:38.165
I want to invite the folks who are here from the school to come up for a photo and I hope Superintendent Thurmond will join us and if we can get the rest of the board members in that would be great too but I don't know how many people we're talking about so we'll see what the crowd looks like.

24:04.192 --> 24:07.567
Board members want to stand up in the right behind here or...

25:33.464 --> 25:54.757
Just a cornucopia of student treasures today and the next item is the 2020-2021 State Board of Education recommendation of three finalists for submission to the governor for consideration and appointment.

25:56.098 --> 26:06.190
And the SBE screening committee recommends that the state board approve the three finalists for the position of 2020 to 2021 SBE student member as identified in the item addendum.

26:10.254 --> 26:16.640
The names of the approved finalists will be forwarded to the governor for his consideration and appointment as the student member.

26:16.660 --> 26:28.852
I have to say that I know from Vice President Strauss that this was an extraordinary group of students and very hard to select from among them because they're all so extraordinary.

26:29.452 --> 26:33.256
This item will be presented by the Screening Committee Chair, Vice President Strauss.

26:33.696 --> 26:34.157
Please begin.

26:34.753 --> 26:36.734
Okay, so good morning.

26:38.674 --> 26:45.297
As in the past years, we had, actually we had a larger and stronger pool than ever, amazing.

26:45.917 --> 27:00.622
And the job of the Screening Committee and the State Board of Education was to narrow the field down and present, as President Darling-Hammond said, the three candidates to the governor, and then the governor will consider and make the selection in the spring of next year.

27:01.002 --> 27:06.244
The screening committee consisted of member Ortiz-Licón and Patio Bronson and myself.

27:06.864 --> 27:12.887
We narrowed, we read all the applications and narrowed them down to a pool of 12 semi-finalists.

27:13.467 --> 27:23.491
It was really hard, I'll just tell you, but hard in a good way because it was so amazing to read these applications and to realize what the hope of the future is with our next generation of leaders.

27:24.111 --> 27:30.473
We reviewed it and selected 12 that we thought represented the best cross-section of applicants across the state.

27:32.113 --> 27:39.115
All the semi-finalists have attended the 2019 Student Advisory Board of Education, which you're going to hear about and see them soon.

27:39.515 --> 27:43.996
That's sponsored by the California Association of Student Council, and it started on November 3rd.

27:44.816 --> 27:49.820
the student delegates voted for six candidates from the 12, so they narrowed it to six.

27:50.300 --> 27:58.366
After listening to their presentations, and my understanding, there was also round tables where students could go and listen to what each candidate was offering.

27:58.987 --> 28:05.191
So yesterday morning, the screening committee, joined by student member, Pangilin, I hope I say that right.

28:07.073 --> 28:12.297
We and Patricia DeCoste from the state board, we helped during the interview process,

28:13.157 --> 28:14.658
I have to say I've done this before.

28:14.678 --> 28:16.559
It was amazing.

28:16.959 --> 28:27.583
Like, in the end, we said, well, maybe we'll just give 6 of the governor's office and let the, but our job was to narrow to 3, but the finalists were incredible in so many ways and you'll hear them in a minute, but we did.

28:28.664 --> 28:31.707
Come to an agreement to support the 3 finalists today.

28:32.167 --> 28:36.392
So, based on the board's decision, we will forward the names of the 3 finalists to the governor's office.

28:36.933 --> 28:42.899
Then they'll go through the governor's office appointment process and the governor will have the difficult job of making the final decision.

28:44.040 --> 28:48.385
I think it's going to be really a tough decision, but he's got some amazing candidates to pick from.

28:48.945 --> 28:59.735
So at this time, I wonder if I should – do I present the certificates first or do you want me to give you the names of the three finalists right now?

29:02.378 --> 29:02.698
Okay.

29:03.159 --> 29:03.419
Okay.

29:05.160 --> 29:14.905
Okay, so our first, so I'm gonna present the names and then students after this I'm gonna have you each come up and we have a certificate and we're gonna take a picture too, okay?

29:15.346 --> 29:19.228
So we have three finalists, not in any order.

29:19.248 --> 29:23.550
Arlene Compa, Arlene you can stand up.

29:27.732 --> 29:30.594
And Michelle Alice, Michelle?

29:36.753 --> 29:39.576
and Zaid Fata.

29:42.799 --> 29:48.624
So I'm actually going to, so first I think we're going to take a vote on that and then we'll introduce all the finalists, is that right?

29:48.684 --> 29:55.670
So the screening committee is recommending these three finalists be presented to the governor's office for next year's student board member to serve with us.

29:55.690 --> 29:56.271
I have a motion.

29:59.696 --> 30:00.919
We got so many motions.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.684
Pick one, whoever is keeping the minutes.

30:03.964 --> 30:05.006
Do I have a second?

30:08.444 --> 30:09.625
You wanna second the motion?

30:10.005 --> 30:10.806
Okay, great.

30:11.807 --> 30:12.848
Any further discussion?

30:13.708 --> 30:16.571
All right, all in favor say aye.

30:16.591 --> 30:16.651
Aye.

30:17.772 --> 30:18.472
Any opposed?

30:19.053 --> 30:19.834
Any abstentions?

30:20.174 --> 30:21.595
All right, the motion carries.

30:21.655 --> 30:23.136
Thank you, Vice President Strauss.

30:24.257 --> 30:35.907
So now I'm gonna go down to the podium and I'm gonna then present each of the students and we'll give you your certificate and then State Superintendent Thurman and President Darling-Hammond are gonna come down and take a picture with all of you all.

30:37.734 --> 30:38.574
Yeah, I'm gonna say all of them.

30:38.594 --> 30:39.834
I'm gonna go down to the front.

30:59.878 --> 31:04.199
Okay, so our first semi-finalist is Christian Calcinas.

31:04.559 --> 31:04.899
Christian?

31:10.520 --> 31:11.121
You're going to come up.

31:24.256 --> 31:26.819
And our second semifinalist, Jennifer Chavez-Vegna.

31:40.925 --> 31:42.846
Our next semifinalist, Rosemary Gomez.

31:56.275 --> 31:58.316
Our next semifinalist, Dayla Metcham.

32:01.959 --> 32:04.080
I think Dayla came from Paradise.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.301
I think she's not with us today.

32:06.301 --> 32:07.382
Lea Perez.

32:08.403 --> 32:08.583
Lea?

32:18.550 --> 32:20.632
And our next semi-finalist, Jessica Ramos.

32:26.376 --> 32:32.841
And our next, Ethan Collier, was one of our candidates that we interviewed.

32:33.381 --> 32:40.006
He was a semi, congratulations.

32:40.206 --> 32:41.207
And Elena Medina.

32:52.795 --> 32:55.097
Elena was also one of our candidates.

32:55.157 --> 32:56.718
And Oliver Zhang, Oliver?

32:56.738 --> 33:08.188
And now our finalists.

33:08.248 --> 33:11.771
And again, I'll bring up our three finalists and you can meet them and then we'll have the whole group.

33:11.831 --> 33:13.892
So Michelle Ellis, Michelle?

33:21.627 --> 33:22.488
Arlene Kampa.

33:30.592 --> 33:31.413
And Zaid Fata.

33:39.099 --> 33:42.440
So I present to you now our recommendations.

33:42.700 --> 33:46.261
These are representative of an amazing group of students who you are now gonna hear.

33:46.841 --> 33:56.344
And so I'd invite State Superintendent Thurman and President Darling-Hammond with them and we'll kind of take a really great picture of these amazing students that you're about to hear from.

33:56.504 --> 33:56.844
Thank you.

34:00.425 --> 34:02.846
No, I think this is, you're gonna hear from everybody today.

34:48.204 --> 34:54.305
Could we have the shorter people come in the, it's just an awkward, it's an awkward photo.

35:02.827 --> 35:11.851
But while we're taking the pictures, I'm just gonna add some of the high schools that these students are representing, because I think the public would be interested in knowing the vast cross-section of our state.

35:12.331 --> 35:16.592
So Michelle Alas is from North Great High School in the Mount Diablo Unified District.

35:17.113 --> 35:22.535
Arlene Campa goes to Los Angeles County High School for the Arts in LA County Office of Education.

35:23.075 --> 35:30.478
Zaid Fata goes to Monta Vista High School in the San Ramon Valley Unified School District in Contra Costa County.

35:31.318 --> 35:35.745
Ethan Collier is Hilltop High School in Sweetwater Union High School District in San Diego.

35:36.226 --> 35:45.801
Elena Medina, High Tech High, Chula Vista in San Diego Unified, and Oliver Zhang, Castro Valley High School in the Castro Valley Unified School District.

35:46.949 --> 36:16.327
Christian Calcines, Valley Academy of the Arts and Sciences between LA Unified, Jennifer Chavez-Veina, Ramona High School in the Riverside Unified School District, Rosemary Gomez, Ramona High School, also in Riverside Unified School District, Dayla Metcham, Paradise High School in Paradise Unified in Butte County, Leah Perez, Shasta High School in Shasta Union High School District, and Jessica Ramos, Skyline High School in the Oakland Unified School District, Alameda County.

36:16.647 --> 36:22.841
These students represent the best of California and the future of our state, which we're now going to hear from.

36:22.941 --> 36:27.090
So I just thought I'd highlight the variety of districts and counties that our students come from.

36:36.027 --> 36:45.172
Okay, so I'm gonna turn it over to our students now who are going to be presenting their proposals.

36:46.212 --> 37:00.079
The students have been working as part of the Student Advisory Board of Education, and they're going to share with us some comments and recommendations for our work at the state level to improve education for students.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.700
They have lots to tell us today.

37:07.981 --> 37:16.746
Good morning, State Superintendent Thurmond, President Darlene Hammond, and Vice President Strauss, esteemed members of the State Board of Education, and honored guests.

37:17.327 --> 37:18.287
My name is Avery Reed.

37:18.567 --> 37:25.111
I'm a senior at Credo High School in Sonoma County and current state president of the California Association of Student Councils, or CASC.

37:26.352 --> 37:33.498
CASC was founded in 1947 by the California Department of Education with the intention of amplifying student voice across the state.

37:34.339 --> 37:38.503
Today, the presentations you will hear are a vibrant manifestation of this voice.

37:39.263 --> 37:43.948
This year's Student Advisory Board on Education has unified delegates from across California.

37:44.468 --> 37:50.713
From San Diego up to Reading, the students seated before you identified six topics of interest in our education system.

37:51.854 --> 37:59.159
They brainstormed respective root problems and developed original solutions to remedy the issues that they identified.

38:00.200 --> 38:09.106
An integral part of this conference and our delegation has been the election process for the 2020 to 2021 student board member on the State Board of Education.

38:10.191 --> 38:15.657
I would like to recommend and commend many of the people who have made this conference and process possible.

38:16.398 --> 38:30.933
The 12 semifinalists who have taken an active role in their candidacy and their respective proposals, as well as the current student board member, Brenna Pangiolini, for conducting the elections she went through only a year ago.

38:32.054 --> 38:38.220
Our consistent platform of presentations to the State Board of Education is an honor for us all, always.

38:38.820 --> 38:48.068
Once again, it is CASC's privilege to represent the California Department of Education's emphasis on the inclusion of student voice in development of education policy.

38:48.649 --> 38:55.915
Without further ado, I welcome the CASC Education Policy Director, Isaiah Colmenaro, for further details on the conference.

38:56.156 --> 38:56.416
Thank you.

39:05.370 --> 39:07.192
Thank you for that introduction, Avery.

39:07.232 --> 39:18.701
Good morning, and thank you, Superintendent Tony Thurmond, President Darlene Hammond, and Vice President Strauss, as well as our esteemed board members for allowing us this amazing opportunity to present our proposals to you today.

39:19.522 --> 39:24.806
My name is Isaiah Colmenaro, and I am a senior at High Tech High at the San Diego Unified School District.

39:25.547 --> 39:29.330
I'm the current Education Policy Director to the California Association of Student Councils.

39:30.110 --> 39:33.731
and the 2019 Student Advisory Board on Education Conference Director.

39:34.432 --> 39:45.195
For over 40 years, students from all over California have come to critique, assess, evaluate the state of their public education and school systems at the annual Student Advisory Board on Education Conference.

39:45.915 --> 39:53.538
It's been a long three days and nights of dedicated hard work, and I can assure you that the six proposals that we're presenting to you today are some of the strongest we've had.

39:54.498 --> 39:59.100
The delegates behind me are intelligent, bright, exceptional, and open to feedback and change.

39:59.660 --> 40:13.346
Their passion for their own education, their willingness to be flexible, and their desire to actively work for positive development in the education system inspires not only me, but the staff that helped me with this conference.

40:13.926 --> 40:15.427
Our qualifications are simple enough.

40:15.707 --> 40:18.128
We are the students that get up in the morning and attend school.

40:19.747 --> 40:22.869
We are the ones who experience the California education system.

40:23.250 --> 40:27.933
These delegates here have proven themselves to be competent in advising the State Board of Education.

40:28.934 --> 40:33.017
With this in mind, this year's delegates have had complete control of the topics presented to you.

40:33.858 --> 40:43.105
With no bias from staff members, delegates debated, voted, and decided on six topics that truly embody what the delegation views to be areas of concern in the California education system.

40:44.770 --> 40:49.434
On day one, the delegates launched themselves into a long process of brainstorming possible topics.

40:49.914 --> 40:59.221
Over the course of three days, they took it upon themselves to compress all of our different experiences, ideas, passions, wants, and needs into six sustained proposals.

40:59.901 --> 41:08.067
We've worked long hours into the night, laying out a foundation for the proposals via root problems, assumptions, causes, and evidence associated with each individual topic.

41:08.788 --> 41:12.491
As the days went on, the delegates refined their word choice and feasibility of these proposals.

41:13.651 --> 41:30.820
The six issues that the Student Advisory Board on Education has decided on are areas of concern that need to be addressed in our California education system are in order, restorative justice, achievement gap, cultural responsiveness, mental health, student board member support, and sustainability.

41:31.621 --> 41:31.981
Thank you.

41:32.181 --> 41:35.463
We will be hearing from our first proposal, restorative justice.

41:48.871 --> 41:55.437
Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, and Vice President Strauss, and esteemed board members.

41:56.018 --> 42:01.303
My name is Anika Mohanpour, and I am a senior at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California.

42:02.043 --> 42:06.388
The words restorative justice have come to mean a lot to me throughout my time in high school.

42:07.008 --> 42:10.511
During my freshman year, one of my close friends was caught cheating on a test.

42:11.252 --> 42:17.795
I can still remember the look of alarm etched into her face as the teacher sent her to our school's on-campus referral center.

42:18.515 --> 42:27.618
Later, during lunch, she approached me, her eyes brimming with tears as she whispered to me that she was being suspended and that this suspension would go on her permanent record.

42:28.199 --> 42:33.841
Years later, as I look back on the incident, I wish our school had different measures in place to help my friend.

42:34.801 --> 42:44.008
Traditionally, schools have used harsh zero-tolerance policies, a practice that has led to an unnecessarily large number of suspensions and expulsions.

42:44.768 --> 42:49.952
Certain student demographics are disproportionately affected by these suspensions and expulsions.

42:50.492 --> 42:52.694
For example, in the 2017-2018 school year, African American students

42:55.896 --> 43:05.861
made up only 6.5% of total California school enrollment, but composed 15.6% of total suspensions classified under willful defiance.

43:06.421 --> 43:11.664
In contrast, white students made up 23.2% of enrollment, but only 20.2% of willful defiance suspensions.

43:15.886 --> 43:22.371
Through conversations with students from across California, we found that students are experiencing a common underlying issue.

43:23.051 --> 43:28.995
At most schools, the disciplinary system does not allow for students to learn from their mistakes in a restorative manner.

43:30.056 --> 43:37.180
Some schools have been extremely successful with the enactment of positive disciplinary practices, such as restorative justice.

43:37.761 --> 43:45.166
These programs emphasize the principle that the individuals most affected by a crime should be able to participate in its resolution.

43:45.786 --> 43:50.108
However, many schools have not implemented positive disciplinary practices.

43:51.048 --> 43:54.830
Suspensions and expulsions often have long-lasting impacts on students.

43:55.730 --> 44:04.254
A study done by Johns Hopkins University found that suspension increased the chance of a student dropping out of school from 16% to 32%.

44:05.334 --> 44:13.018
Suspensions and expulsions also lead to feelings of negativity among students about school and contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline.

44:13.718 --> 44:23.567
Once students are put into contact with law enforcement for disciplinary reasons, many are pushed out of the educational environment and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems.

44:24.188 --> 44:29.133
Statistically, students of minority backgrounds are punished more harshly than their white peers.

44:29.793 --> 44:34.318
The treatment and opportunities people receive in their youth fall them into the future.

44:35.038 --> 44:40.543
A single suspension in the first year of high school doubles the dropout rate chance for that child.

44:41.123 --> 44:47.249
Children who are expelled are three times more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system.

44:48.430 --> 45:00.260
For these reasons, the Student Advisory Board on Education proposes that the superintendent of public instruction facilitate the publication of a blueprint for positive disciplinary practices

45:00.820 --> 45:10.463
which would serve as an implementation model that local educational agencies could reference when developing alternative ways to address and correct student misbehavior.

45:11.163 --> 45:21.567
This blueprint, facilitated by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, will serve only as a primary resource and provide guidance to local agencies, not create a statewide mandate.

45:22.327 --> 45:32.451
The proposed blueprint could perhaps contain information that would aid schools in implementing positive disciplinary programs such as peer-to-peer mentoring groups as well as faculty training.

45:33.451 --> 45:35.612
There is an imminent need for this blueprint.

45:36.112 --> 45:39.073
A couple of months ago, Governor Newsom signed Senate Bill 419.

45:41.094 --> 45:47.276
To summarize, this bill would prohibit schools from suspending students in grades K-8 for willful defiance.

45:47.936 --> 45:50.956
This bill will be enacted in July of next year.

45:51.617 --> 46:05.780
This means that within the next seven months, school districts that have traditionally suspended students for acting out in class will need to find new ways to address and correct student misbehavior since they can no longer suspend or expel for willful defiance.

46:06.540 --> 46:17.743
Without guidance from key experts, researchers, and other stakeholders, school districts may unknowingly implement new practices that are ineffective and counteractive to what the bill intends to address.

46:18.603 --> 46:30.306
While some individual school districts have already implemented restorative justice systems, not all districts have the prior experience or the capacity to create quality disciplinary plans in such a short time frame.

46:31.840 --> 46:39.465
The role of the California Department of Education is to assist local educational agencies in making the right decisions for their own students.

46:40.326 --> 46:48.452
The creation of a blueprint using statewide resources could guide any school district, regardless of prior experience or resources, in the right direction.

46:49.132 --> 46:57.558
We envision an education system with positive disciplinary measures that allow students to grow from their mistakes and feel supported by staff.

46:58.579 --> 47:12.849
As such, the Student Advisory Board on Education proposes that the Superintendent for Public Instruction facilitate the creation of a blueprint that serves as a reference for schools to develop alternative methods to addressing and correcting student misbehavior.

47:13.410 --> 47:20.194
This new blueprint would provide guidance for local educational agencies to flourish in a manner that is most beneficial to their students.

47:20.655 --> 47:20.955
Thank you.

47:27.015 --> 47:40.438
So this proposal had a number of folks who are involved in developing it so I want to ask them to stand and come forward because if you have a few questions we can ask the representatives of this proposal.

47:40.718 --> 47:42.299
Are there others here who were involved?

47:44.359 --> 47:45.199
Come on forward.

47:46.920 --> 47:56.382
Thank you all for the great work on this and well after each of these we'll take a few minutes to see if anybody has any questions they want to ask or any comments they want to make.

48:02.216 --> 48:03.299
What a good looking group.

48:12.458 --> 48:24.561
So my understanding is that you are asking the Department of Ed, the California Department of Education, to create a resource for school districts to use to help implement restorative practices, is that right?

48:24.581 --> 48:29.002
Go ahead, you can say something on the microphone and answer.

48:29.402 --> 48:38.704
And include student, come to the microphone and tell us specifically what you're asking, because we're actually talking to State Superintendent Thurmond about his,

48:39.984 --> 48:41.965
work that they might do that you're asking for.

48:42.026 --> 48:43.026
So, want to clarify that?

48:44.227 --> 48:53.413
So, the creation of this blueprint is solely to be a resource for schools and for local educational agencies.

48:53.894 --> 49:00.098
We understand that not all areas are the same, not all schools are the same, and all schools have different needs.

49:00.758 --> 49:22.425
But for the schools who do not have the resources or the experience or the capability to go in depth on what practices would be best, this state-researched and explored blueprint would provide a strong resource for them to implement positive disciplinary practices.

49:30.774 --> 49:32.315
First of all, thank you for the presentation.

49:32.375 --> 49:34.177
I think it is an excellent idea.

49:35.217 --> 49:53.689
The only question I have for you at this time is, is this something that you'd be willing to work on from the idea, concept, formation stage to actually presenting it before an assembly committee to bring it forward if it requires any legislative action?

49:53.989 --> 49:55.250
Would you be willing to work on it?

49:55.730 --> 49:58.312
Rather than leave the idea on my desk, which I'm happy to have,

49:58.991 --> 50:05.696
Are you willing to also put in some elbow grease, you know, some work to actually see it implemented and actually used?

50:07.177 --> 50:08.739
We would most definitely.

50:08.759 --> 50:10.060
Very good.

50:10.400 --> 50:14.283
And we would be honored to be able to help in the process.

50:14.403 --> 50:15.604
Well, we have you on record now.

50:17.486 --> 50:23.971
And I'll just say that in the past, you know, I have introduced legislation that has come to us from CASC.

50:24.991 --> 50:35.716
And two bills, actually, one that has been signed into law that guarantees that every school board in the state should have a voting student board member.

50:35.876 --> 50:37.877
And so your efforts have real impact.

50:38.217 --> 50:42.019
And so our team is paying attention to what you present today.

50:42.059 --> 50:44.300
We have a whole bunch of questions about how we get implemented.

50:44.700 --> 50:48.102
But I applaud you for your interest and for your presentation.

50:48.583 --> 50:50.644
Go Yellow Jackets, my old assembly district.

50:51.445 --> 50:54.227
Thank you so much for what you presented and we look forward to working with you.

50:54.447 --> 50:54.687
Thank you.

51:01.961 --> 51:03.523
We have a second presentation.

51:03.703 --> 51:05.044
So we have six presentations.

51:05.084 --> 51:06.386
So we have five more.

51:06.686 --> 51:17.817
And what we'll do is just so the committees of the students are ready after the speaker from your group is we'll have the committee come up and then we'll have any clarifying questions from state board staff or the department of it.

51:18.337 --> 51:18.998
So next group.

51:29.617 --> 51:33.720
So good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Hammond, and esteemed board members.

51:34.121 --> 51:40.325
My name is Alvin Lee, and I'm a junior attending Mission San Jose High School in the Fremont Unified School District in Fremont, California.

51:41.006 --> 51:50.053
We, the Student Advisory Board on Education, also known as SABE, collectively worked together this week to identify issues we saw that were pertinent to the California education system.

51:50.673 --> 52:06.065
Throughout the course of the conference, through deeper discussions with my fellow committee members, we identified that achievement gaps within the California education system are symptoms stemming from a lack of student involvement on superintendent appointed work groups and state board commissions and committees.

52:07.066 --> 52:17.774
And so we ask that the superintendent of public instruction appoints one or more students to 12 superintendent appointed transition teams, which can be referred to in section three of your proposal packets in front of you.

52:18.755 --> 52:32.069
In addition, we recommend that the State Board of Education add student members to its commissions and committees, specifically onto the California Practitioners Advisory Group, the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, and the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

52:33.877 --> 52:36.239
I have a good friend, Miguel, who lived two houses down from me.

52:36.739 --> 52:41.162
His parents were both undocumented immigrants who fled from Mexico about four years ago.

52:41.702 --> 52:47.185
He comes from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background and has very limited access to educational resources.

52:47.846 --> 52:49.567
He lived in the garage of his uncle's home.

52:51.127 --> 52:55.552
and didn't have access to basic technological needs to succeed in today's academic environment.

52:56.172 --> 52:59.816
He often came over to my house to eat dinner, use our computers, get homework help.

53:00.437 --> 53:05.962
Miguel is tasked with being his own advocate when it comes to attaining educational resources that are given for me.

53:06.703 --> 53:12.029
It is for this reason that students must have a platform in which to advocate for each other and their education.

53:12.669 --> 53:21.536
The State Board of Education and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction cannot equitably allocate resources among students without their firsthand experience.

53:22.497 --> 53:26.960
We recognize the efforts being made by Superintendent Thurmond via his transitional team work groups.

53:27.361 --> 53:36.668
We also recognize the work of the State Board of Education through its commissions and committees such as the California Practitioner Advisory Group, the Commission on Charter Schools, and the Commission on Special Education.

53:37.448 --> 53:48.256
However, we believe that in order for these bodies to be used to their full potential, they must include the perspectives of the main stakeholders, the 6.3 million diverse students here in California.

53:48.956 --> 53:58.182
Historically, both superintendent-appointed work groups and State Board of Education commissions and committees have included all educational stakeholders except students.

53:58.863 --> 54:06.468
Students bring a unique perspective that can only be captured through firsthand experience, which points the respective groups in otherwise overlooked directions.

54:07.408 --> 54:13.191
The achievement gaps are a symptom of this lack of recognition to address student issues via student voices.

54:13.831 --> 54:22.356
Through their firsthand experiences, students are able to better identify overlooked issues that are the primary contributors to the achievement gaps in and of itself.

54:23.176 --> 54:35.763
Additionally, educators, policymakers, and the superintendent all have their own understanding of what the achievement gaps are, either in a theoretical sense or based on dated past experiences as students.

54:36.483 --> 54:39.986
On the other hand, students of today have firsthand knowledge of what their needs are.

54:40.426 --> 54:46.751
Thus, student perspective in these respective groups is pertinent to bridging differing understandings of the achievement gaps.

54:47.632 --> 54:56.699
Furthermore, the perspective of student board members shapes the respective group's understanding of equity, which allows the state board to more effectively allocate resources.

54:57.420 --> 55:04.145
This, in turn, restores a sense of urgent agency within students, empowering them to become actively involved within their education.

55:05.186 --> 55:15.593
Having students on these respective groups fosters a sense of transparency, as it gives students the authority to hold the respective groups accountable for their actions and implementations.

55:16.494 --> 55:27.001
This engagement combats historical minority disenfranchisement within the education system, giving way to potential for increasing graduation rates and ultimately the pursuit of higher education.

55:28.300 --> 55:35.645
At first glance, we understand the relationship between student involvement and achievement gaps may seem like a stretch due to its unorthodox nature.

55:37.046 --> 55:43.390
However, through careful consideration of the rationale outlined in the proposal in front of you, a clear correlation can be drawn.

55:44.051 --> 55:51.736
Students who are the primary stakeholders in the education system are absolutely essential to bridging the various understandings of the achievement gap.

55:52.496 --> 55:57.520
It is imperative that we add a student representative to these respective work groups and commissions.

55:57.860 --> 55:58.120
Thank you.

56:01.991 --> 56:14.996
So will the committee that came up to develop this proposal come forward and then board members or Department of Ed or State Superintendent, President Darling-Hammond, we might have some questions for the students.

56:28.334 --> 56:35.079
Okay, so Member Sandoval, and then Member Rucker, and then maybe State Superintendent Thurmond, right?

56:35.239 --> 56:36.340
Okay, so Member Sandoval?

56:36.941 --> 56:44.687
Thank you so much for your well-thought presentation and paper and your research, and I know many of you were up all night finishing your work, so thank you.

56:45.808 --> 56:55.435
I have the privilege of serving as the liaison on special education issues with the Advisory Commission on Special Education, and there is a student member

56:56.517 --> 57:08.867
on the Advisory Commission on Special Education and has been for a very long time and that student voice is so important to everything that we do and particularly regarding special education issues.

57:08.907 --> 57:16.933
So I do want to let you know that that voice is certainly represented and we often hear from students and family members out in the community.

57:17.013 --> 57:19.034
So thank you so much for your good work.

57:20.735 --> 57:21.256
Member Rucker.

57:21.946 --> 57:33.390
Well, I want to thank you all for being here today and I noticed as I was listening to Mr. Lee's very cogent presentation, the diversity of school districts that all of you come from.

57:33.850 --> 57:43.693
What I really appreciated about the thought that you put into this comment, this is probably the freshest perspective I have heard in my time on the board.

57:44.193 --> 57:48.556
about student voice because you touched on the issue of student agency.

57:49.097 --> 57:58.203
For most students in your high schools, the students who have that sense of agency are people who are in positions and doing work like you.

57:58.684 --> 58:08.391
But you're aware at your own high school campuses among your peer group that a lot of your peers don't have that same sense of agency that you have.

58:08.991 --> 58:11.792
And I can tell by the way you're nodding your head that that's true.

58:12.373 --> 58:17.115
And so this issue about student voice is not just something you're giving lip service to.

58:17.215 --> 58:28.240
You are explaining and helping us to understand it's not just the presence of the students on these commissions, but what it actually says about the commitment

58:28.920 --> 58:35.922
of the people in a leadership position to each of you individually and to your student peers as a group.

58:36.322 --> 58:42.784
So I really want to thank you for the perspective you gave about this idea of agency.

58:43.184 --> 58:45.264
And I do have just one question.

58:45.925 --> 58:57.828
So when you go back to your campuses and with the students and your peers that you thought about, that you had in mind as you were doing this, what are you going to be able to tell them

58:58.448 --> 59:03.753
about what happened today and what it is you were able to bring back to them as a promise.

59:03.813 --> 59:05.435
What do you think you'll be able to tell them?

59:10.734 --> 59:21.338
So through this process of participating in the SABE conference, I found out that my school board, so my school is under the L.A.

59:21.398 --> 59:22.779
County Office of Education.

59:23.799 --> 59:34.043
So we do not actually have a district board for student voices to be heard, and we do not have a member on the Office of Education board because it's not mandated.

59:34.663 --> 59:43.026
So I think what we're going back into our communities is our own sense of agency to take control of that.

59:43.667 --> 59:50.209
And then also, you know, the fact that there are different ways to demand change that maybe aren't legislative.

59:50.950 --> 59:51.750
Maybe that's, you know.

59:52.430 --> 59:57.773
a little sit-in on the principal's office or challenging what a teacher might have to say.

59:58.553 --> 01:00:04.796
There are small victories that we can take in order to regain sense of agency within our own education.

01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:08.878
I appreciate that answer, so I'm going to give you a piece of advice and remind you.

01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:13.400
Frederick Douglass once said, power concedes nothing without a demand.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.481
It never has and it never will.

01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:23.626
So I will be right there with you in spirit as you do the work to do that advocacy and get a student member on your local boards.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:32.431
And again, I really want to thank you for the conversation you offered us today and that very fresh perspective about student agency.

01:00:33.511 --> 01:00:34.412
Superintendent Thurmond.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.960
Well, there you have it.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.122
You have a quote and a mandate and a charge from board member Rucker citing Frederick Douglass.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:46.503
Thank you for the presentation.

01:00:48.483 --> 01:00:59.547
So as to your question, as to your demand, I should say, that there be students on our transition work groups, the answer is yes, we accept your demand and your inquiry.

01:01:00.427 --> 01:01:08.530
What we'd like to do is work with you to make sure that student participation is not in any way a token kind of participation.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:13.672
We want students to have equal voice and access and so we'd like to work with you on that.

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:20.534
By the way, our office has been working on creating student focus groups to ask students across the state

01:01:20.974 --> 01:01:29.417
for impact on how we help our students do better on statewide tests, especially because we've noticed a huge drop off in the older grades.

01:01:29.497 --> 01:01:34.819
We suspect that students might have some ideas about how we help to counter that.

01:01:35.219 --> 01:01:38.721
And so my question to you is, would you be willing to work with us in that way?

01:01:39.201 --> 01:01:41.782
And could you see a way of creating

01:01:43.122 --> 01:02:00.371
At the school level, groups that are focused on closing the achievement gap, meaning student-led groups that are focused on how we close the achievement gap and advise the educators and leaders on campus and advise the Department of Education and the State Board on how we connect it all up statewide.

01:02:00.391 --> 01:02:03.233
Would you be willing to work with us on developing out such a concept?

01:02:03.697 --> 01:02:14.545
Well, yeah, I mean, to answer your first question, I think I can collectively say on behalf of all the committee here, heck yeah, we'll work with you on getting students into your transitional workforces.

01:02:14.885 --> 01:02:24.032
But in regards to your second question, which is an amazing point, CASC here, specifically at the SABE conference, it represents a diverse collection of students from across California.

01:02:24.312 --> 01:02:26.174
And a lot of members here are actually students.

01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:31.418
A lot of members here are actually local student board members that sit on their local board of education.

01:02:31.758 --> 01:02:42.527
And so it would be really impactful is if perhaps, like you said, we collectively work together, CASC as well as the Superintendent Office of Public Instruction, to really hone in the student board members

01:02:43.007 --> 01:02:57.276
in lobbying to their local school board or local superintendent on instituting these select task forces or whatever select committees on their local school board's institute for these kind of identifications and solution processes.

01:02:57.757 --> 01:02:59.938
We're excited to work with CASC.

01:03:00.178 --> 01:03:02.339
It's been an honor to work with your members.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.666
I would just say this, you know, you all, you know, there are a thousand, more than a thousand school districts in the state.

01:03:09.746 --> 01:03:12.889
And so we can't expect you to be everywhere.

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:21.578
And so we want to work with you, but we also want to figure out how to engage other students who may not be a member of CAST, who may not be a member of a youth organization.

01:03:22.756 --> 01:03:26.119
to be a part of the solution, maybe on their school site or in their county.

01:03:26.539 --> 01:03:38.266
And to be frank, we're actually thinking that by asking students to get involved, we might even be able to help students themselves improve their own student performance by asking them to be part of the solution.

01:03:38.386 --> 01:03:46.331
So, but we like to do that with your kind of coaching and guidance on how to set that up and how to maximize that and make that a really effective strategy.

01:03:46.832 --> 01:03:47.372
You down for that?

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.703
Yeah, let's do it.

01:03:49.723 --> 01:03:50.125
Awesome.

01:03:50.506 --> 01:03:54.420
And Member Sung wanted to follow up with a comment too, Superintendent Thurmond.

01:03:54.844 --> 01:04:00.807
Just wanted you to know that two or three staff in the office, in the room, in the chamber, who are going to want to meet you today.

01:04:01.747 --> 01:04:07.230
Julian Cuevas, who is the head of our government affairs division, is going to want to talk to you all.

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:10.932
He's been walking around and talking to the restorative justice participants.

01:04:11.012 --> 01:04:14.653
And Mary Nicely, who's overseeing our work groups, is also in the room.

01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:20.756
They're going to want to meet you and figure out how we make this more than a one-off, and that we find a way to work together to move it forward.

01:04:21.297 --> 01:04:22.177
Great job, and thank you.

01:04:23.758 --> 01:04:23.998
Thank you.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.321
Yeah, and also I just want to thank the excellent proposal.

01:04:29.341 --> 01:04:30.061
Thank you very much.

01:04:30.101 --> 01:04:46.326
And then I just want us to be cognizant that to have students participate, we also want to ensure that we provide funding for transportation to these committees and then also to ensure that they get excused from school from the principle that this is a very worthwhile endeavor and educational endeavor as well.

01:04:47.586 --> 01:04:47.886
All right.

01:04:48.366 --> 01:04:48.786
Well, thank you.

01:04:48.806 --> 01:04:49.646
We have more to hear.

01:04:49.726 --> 01:04:50.547
So thank you all.

01:04:50.567 --> 01:04:53.548
We're going to look forward to hearing the next proposal as well.

01:04:53.608 --> 01:04:54.988
So thank you all very, very much.

01:05:04.107 --> 01:05:05.235
Okay, the next group come forward.

01:05:05.457 --> 01:05:06.524
Next presenter, please.

01:05:19.073 --> 01:05:23.779
Good morning, Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, and esteemed board members.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:34.353
My name is Angel Jimenez, and I'm a senior attending Mountain View High School in the El Monte Union High School District, where I proudly serve as its student board member.

01:05:35.575 --> 01:05:57.878
On behalf of the Student Advisory Board on Education, we strongly recommend that the Superintendent's Existing Professional Development Transitional Work Group create relevant cultural responsiveness resources for California educators and staff, and make this material available on the Teacher Resource page of the CDE's website.

01:06:00.154 --> 01:06:05.302
My kindergarten teacher was the first teacher I ever had that looked like me, a male Latino in education.

01:06:06.143 --> 01:06:14.095
His name was Mr. Montoya, and every day I came into his classroom with such curiosity and excitement that I felt that I could save the world.

01:06:16.272 --> 01:06:37.944
I remember the safe environment he created in discussing significant cultural figures, Cesar Chavez, Martin Luther King Jr., Harvey Milk, all leaders who represented the underrepresented, the traditionally oppressed groups of people, including, but not limited to, Latinos, African-Americans, and members of the LGBTQ plus community.

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:45.611
Mr. Montoya's teachings have stuck with me for the 12 years since I was in his class.

01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:55.659
And I know this to be true, not just because he looks like me, but because he understood my cultural background as an underrepresented student.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:05.287
I have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to be taught by similar teachers who are culturally competent, even when they do not look like me.

01:07:06.108 --> 01:07:09.651
However, not all students have this opportunity.

01:07:11.184 --> 01:07:28.430
In observing situations across various regions of California where educators are not as culturally competent, we found that underrepresented students are overly encouraged to attend community college when they're more than qualified to attend a four-year university.

01:07:29.371 --> 01:07:32.752
They were encouraged to aim lower than their ability.

01:07:34.733 --> 01:07:43.357
At a school in Danville, a student wrote, whites only, no blacks allowed, in Sharpie, on a school bathroom urinal.

01:07:44.998 --> 01:08:00.725
At a school in Bakersfield, politically motivated students stood outside of a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting, forming a tunnel to bombard students exiting the meeting and saying they would, quote, burn in hell and their club shouldn't be allowed.

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:19.399
In light of observing these situations, we believe that uninformed and misinformed educated perspectives on the experiences of underrepresented students allows for the proliferation of hate speech, academic inequality, and injustice in the classroom.

01:08:20.739 --> 01:08:30.568
When thinking about what we could have done differently to have prevented these situations, we questioned whether or not relevant resources were in place for teachers to access.

01:08:31.588 --> 01:08:46.421
We researched the resources that already existed and stumbled across a page for teachers on the CDE website under LCFF priority one, which linked us to a cultural understanding module from Vanderbilt University.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:09:00.915
The module included an outdated video depicting a single oversimplified situation where two white teachers were struggling to understand and assist a Mexican immigrant named Maria.

01:09:02.637 --> 01:09:09.063
Resources like this module only highlight cultural misunderstandings between educators and students.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:29.771
Although we do appreciate that this page exists with the intent of improving cultural competency for teachers, we believe that new resources should be created to provide methods for educators and school staff to learn how to empower and teach all students regardless of their perceived cultural differences.

01:09:31.388 --> 01:09:41.994
We are not proposing the creation of new curriculum, but instead suggesting a framework designed by recognized experts already within the Department of Education.

01:09:42.755 --> 01:09:52.561
This framework is geared towards educators and school staff who need to navigate sensitive cultural topics in a comfortable and respectable way for all.

01:09:54.033 --> 01:10:03.556
In creating this new relevant page that replaces the old, teachers can effectively facilitate charged conversations with enhanced cultural comprehension.

01:10:04.776 --> 01:10:21.261
Considering California Assembly Member Jose Medina's Assembly Bill AB331, which mandates ethnic studies as a graduation requirement, California's education system is taking a necessary step to providing all students with equal representation in and outside of the classroom.

01:10:22.355 --> 01:10:30.502
The proposal that we provide with you today would bolster AB331 by demonstrating the importance behind this new curriculum to their students.

01:10:31.463 --> 01:10:47.517
As a result, this proposal enacted would prepare educators to feel comfortable teaching culturally sensitive topics and handle difficult cultural situations, thus allowing students to feel accepted, motivated, and safe at school.

01:10:49.093 --> 01:10:54.199
We can't expect students to thrive in a school environment where they do not see themselves positively reflected.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:11:01.148
This proposal would therefore decrease chronic absenteeism among underrepresented populations.

01:11:03.072 --> 01:11:09.176
I stand here today, much like the leaders I learned about in kindergarten, representing the underrepresented.

01:11:10.097 --> 01:11:23.426
With a new diverse generation of students in California schools, there needs to be an increase in attention on cultural competency, as it is every student's right to learn in a safe and comfortable environment.

01:11:24.875 --> 01:11:44.160
For these reasons, we strongly suggest that the superintendent's existing professional development transitional work group create relevant cultural responsiveness resources for California educators and staff and make it available on the teacher resource page on the CDE's website.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:52.202
I hope that California can pave the way to an education system where no one has to feel misrepresented.

01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:53.282
Thank you.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:55.960
Thank you.

01:12:00.245 --> 01:12:07.792
Can we have the committee that supported this work come forward and then we're going to start our questions with board member Ortiz-Lincoln.

01:12:15.345 --> 01:12:16.146
Thank you for that.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:20.910
I'm very inspired by everything that you said, Angel, and welcome back.

01:12:21.111 --> 01:12:27.977
I know you were a finalist last year, and I had the privilege of interviewing you, so I'm happy to see that you have continued the work.

01:12:29.218 --> 01:12:31.680
I have to say that as you were speaking,

01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:40.945
I thought a lot about some of the things that we're living now that perhaps that video that you saw would not have anticipated or was not accurately addressing.

01:12:41.445 --> 01:12:46.787
When we think of culturally responsive practice or materials, we really need to think bigger.

01:12:46.907 --> 01:12:49.929
We need to think of a culturally responsive system, right?

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:59.253
So I think it's great to have those resources available to classroom teachers, but really we need to think of practices, policies,

01:12:59.773 --> 01:13:06.360
the microaggressions that sometimes are hard to point and say, I felt like I was offended, but I can't really figure out why, right?

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.581
Those are microaggressions.

01:13:07.661 --> 01:13:11.826
It's the new way of being culturally, attacking somebody culturally.

01:13:12.306 --> 01:13:17.592
So I know that for all of you standing before us, and yesterday I want to say that Elena

01:13:18.452 --> 01:13:21.334
You really touched me when you said three things during your interview.

01:13:21.794 --> 01:13:25.356
You said, whenever we approach something, you should always ask, is this ethical?

01:13:25.796 --> 01:13:26.717
Is it student-centered?

01:13:26.917 --> 01:13:27.977
Is it evidence-based?

01:13:28.398 --> 01:13:31.459
And I think that's also very appropriate as we look at our systems.

01:13:32.039 --> 01:13:34.481
Are the systems that we have, are they student-centered?

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:36.842
Are they responsive to the students that we're serving?

01:13:37.262 --> 01:13:40.304
And if not, we really need to interrogate those systems and change them.

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:46.307
So I want to encourage us to think of how we could provide those resources for educators

01:13:46.687 --> 01:13:55.230
But think a little bit bigger in terms of how do we create a system so that teachers who are your first grade, Mr. Montoya, feel supported.

01:13:55.490 --> 01:14:02.913
So they're not just the sole star in the constellation trying to shine bright, but that there's a system of support for him.

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:07.816
We want to make sure that there's leaders that encourage that in their school settings.

01:14:08.137 --> 01:14:19.025
We want to make sure there's superintendents, that there's policymakers, so that this is a system of culturally responsive practices that really dignify the students that are part of it.

01:14:19.225 --> 01:14:25.930
And I thank you, all of you, for bringing this to light for us, and I hope that we really take some of your recommendations to heart.

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:26.450
Thank you.

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:38.252
Thank you Madam Vice President.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:51.436
I just want to acknowledge you all for your great work and somewhere Mr. Montoya I'm sure is smiling proud and you know as you laid out the presentation you touched on several things that the department and the State Board are working on.

01:14:51.876 --> 01:14:59.498
Most of them are ways to we've set an aspirational goal to get to a place that we're not at right that we would

01:15:00.238 --> 01:15:01.820
be able to diversify our workforce.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.341
And those are things that we're talking about.

01:15:04.742 --> 01:15:08.444
And so as I sat here listening to your presentation, I thought, wow, you've got our playlist.

01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:23.656
And it would be great to have you and your colleagues be our technical assistants and advisors on all of these things that we're dreaming about and the things that we're doing, that you all could coach us and give us your perspective on all this research that you've done.

01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:25.557
You literally ticked off a million things, right?

01:15:26.098 --> 01:15:26.698
The way you started.

01:15:27.078 --> 01:15:28.920
We've been talking this year about how do we expand

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:34.443
a pipeline of male educators of color in education, particularly in the elementary school grades.

01:15:34.483 --> 01:15:37.144
And then you came up and you just made that your dissertation, right?

01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:38.605
You said kindergarten.

01:15:38.645 --> 01:15:43.207
And all I could think of was that saying that they say, everything I needed to learn, I learned in kindergarten.

01:15:43.227 --> 01:15:45.929
And you got it all, and you're using it to help others.

01:15:46.429 --> 01:15:50.753
We have been talking about implicit bias training and addressing unconscious bias.

01:15:50.793 --> 01:15:58.899
And so your focus on culturally relevant training and a curriculum is certainly in tune with that.

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:08.167
We have been continuing to work on how we deliver a model ethnic studies curriculum guide to help our school districts have conversations

01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:25.229
in ways that students see those who've contributed who look like them and they can see the connections and so just every you know we we've supported legislation this year that the governor has signed to help us help educators better support lgbtq students in our school spaces so everything that you outlined

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:36.100
are key issues of the day and we'd like to work with you all if you are willing to be advisors to us to help us create stronger proposals in each of these areas.

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.243
So thank you for your presentation and great job.

01:16:38.483 --> 01:16:38.763
Thank you.

01:16:44.829 --> 01:16:45.991
We'll take our next presenter.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:06.349
Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, and esteemed members of the board.

01:17:07.530 --> 01:17:13.656
My name is Mina Lee and I am a sophomore attending John Marshall Senior High School in the Los Angeles Unified School District.

01:17:14.257 --> 01:17:19.542
I am here to speak about the rising issue of mental health on behalf of the students of California.

01:17:20.783 --> 01:17:32.192
We propose that the superintendent of public instruction ensure one or more high school student members are appointed to the student mental health policy work group with full voting rights and duties.

01:17:34.153 --> 01:17:43.100
Youth in California have experienced deterioration in mental health due to a lack of implementation of existing curriculum, chronic absence, family problems, and more.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:50.833
This decline has led to consequences such as truancy, chronic absenteeism, self-harm, and even suicide.

01:17:52.304 --> 01:18:00.851
Students struggle with anxiety, depression, and other challenges, yet due to stigma surrounding these issues, existing mental health resources are not utilized.

01:18:02.012 --> 01:18:11.979
This lack of accessibility is exemplified by the fact that 42% of students are unsure if they're properly managing their stress, and 13% do not even consider their stress levels.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:20.406
Improperly treating mental health issues, even relatively minor ones, leads to irreparable harm to students' well-being and future.

01:18:21.903 --> 01:18:27.924
All students who worked on this proposal know multiple peers who have struggled with mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts.

01:18:28.765 --> 01:18:32.406
A year ago, a close friend of mine told me that he attempted suicide.

01:18:33.426 --> 01:18:36.827
He attempted to take his own life because he felt like he did not have support.

01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:37.687
He felt alone.

01:18:38.587 --> 01:18:42.368
Coincidentally, I was also going through the same thoughts because of the same reasons.

01:18:44.995 --> 01:18:51.423
I, like many students across the state, felt that there was no emotional support or acknowledgement that we were human beings, not just statistics.

01:18:52.364 --> 01:18:54.686
No students should ever have to feel this way.

01:18:55.427 --> 01:19:00.693
Issues regarding student mental health in schools is an extensive problem, but it is a problem that can be solved.

01:19:01.494 --> 01:19:13.318
We envision a school where every student is provided with the same environment to talk about their insecurities, where students are aware of resources and support around them, and where no student takes their own life for any reason.

01:19:14.099 --> 01:19:17.840
Schools prevent mental health issues so that everyone feels represented and supported.

01:19:18.703 --> 01:19:30.572
To aspire this vision, we urge the superintendent of public instruction to ensure that there is at least one high school student member on the student mental health policy work group at all times.

01:19:31.272 --> 01:19:40.178
This work group focuses on the development of policy recommendations related to mental health training for educators, student safety, and other mental health related issues.

01:19:41.039 --> 01:19:49.427
Although this workgroup was developed with the intention of helping students, it lacks a high school student member to provide critical feedback and a relevant perspective.

01:19:50.528 --> 01:20:03.139
The implementation of a high school student filling the student member role every year will require an updated and standardized application process with questions in essay format, an application deadline, and a selection timeline.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:15.326
To publicize this position, the superintendent of public instruction will publish a letter to all students, teachers, counselors, principals, and other constituents of California school districts.

01:20:16.307 --> 01:20:24.212
The superintendent will then work with a variety of advocacy groups who work with students directly, such as CAS, to identify potential students to serve on the work group.

01:20:25.032 --> 01:20:34.759
It is vital to have a high school student on the work group because almost all students experience some form of mental health struggles and therefore have a crucial perspective on this issue.

01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:46.047
We believe that without a student member, the work group is unable to counteract the mental health challenges facing students today due to their limited perspective on this issue.

01:20:47.128 --> 01:20:56.453
With the prevalence of media and many other ever-changing cultural challenges, a student's voice is necessary to fully understand this issue.

01:20:57.634 --> 01:21:02.877
This student representative will speak to the ideas of their community and generation.

01:21:03.518 --> 01:21:12.883
Please prioritize the student mental health by ensuring that there is at least one high school member in the student mental health policy and work group.

01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:14.684
Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:21:19.136 --> 01:21:25.621
We have the students who are part of this work group come forward and then we'll ask the board members for some comments.

01:21:35.488 --> 01:21:36.409
Anybody want to talk?

01:21:40.219 --> 01:21:40.499
Thank you.

01:21:40.519 --> 01:21:47.165
I just want to acknowledge you for a great presentation and say, thank you for what you've presented and what you've requested.

01:21:47.766 --> 01:21:57.215
And the short answer is yes, we will be happy to work to ensure that there are high school students on the mental health work group.

01:21:57.735 --> 01:22:00.296
I also wanted to thank you for all that you presented.

01:22:01.516 --> 01:22:11.659
You're a great leader, and I think it really speaks to an issue in our country that we fail to talk about the importance of addressing mental health for young people and for all people.

01:22:11.779 --> 01:22:17.001
And when we start talking about it, we remove the stigma that allows people to get support.

01:22:17.921 --> 01:22:19.302
And so it's a critical issue.

01:22:19.882 --> 01:22:21.283
We'd like to work with you directly on it.

01:22:21.883 --> 01:22:23.204
Thank you for your leadership on it.

01:22:23.724 --> 01:22:32.589
And know that the governor and the legislature have provided $50 million in the budget that just passed this year for school-based mental health programs.

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:39.712
There's a state mental health advisory oversight commission that's making decisions about how that money would be spent.

01:22:39.752 --> 01:22:43.534
We'd like to make sure that your voices are included in what those guidelines should look like.

01:22:43.574 --> 01:22:45.475
So thank you, and we look forward to working with you.

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:51.019
Thank you guys very much.

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:51.585
Thank you all.

01:22:52.009 --> 01:22:52.251
Thank you.

01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:11.866
Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, and honorable members of the board.

01:23:12.426 --> 01:23:18.715
My name is Aubriana McNamara and I am a junior at Somerville Union High School within the Somerville Union High School District in Tuolumne County.

01:23:19.355 --> 01:23:23.000
I am here to speak with you upon the topic of student board member support.

01:23:24.642 --> 01:23:35.649
The Student Advisory Board on Education proposes that the Superintendent of Public Instruction directs the creation of a board outline on how to guide districts and provide training for student board members.

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:51.500
We the students believe that this topic and the guidelines should include, but is not limited to, roles and responsibilities, procedure for meetings, skills of being an effective voice, critical thinking, implicit bias, which should be implemented through the student board member training blueprint.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:01.985
With this, we strongly believe that after the blueprint is created, it should be located on the California Department of Education website and that it is distributed to all district boards and superintendents.

01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:07.507
We understand that each district has very specific needs due to the diversity within California.

01:24:08.067 --> 01:24:14.891
Our overall goal is to provide guidance for school districts so that they can best make the decision on implementing this training blueprint.

01:24:16.011 --> 01:24:18.633
Over the years, the student voice hasn't been heard on a local level.

01:24:19.113 --> 01:24:24.537
The lack of student voice has created a disconnect between students, board members, school staff, and policy makers.

01:24:25.098 --> 01:24:31.783
The disconnect between the adult direction of education systems and the students in the classroom has created a lack of motivation and involvement.

01:24:32.523 --> 01:24:36.105
In what ways can we address this feeling of being misunderstood and unmotivated?

01:24:36.545 --> 01:24:41.787
First of all, there is a need to improve the quality of student voices, and this is where we need your help.

01:24:42.587 --> 01:24:45.769
We found that there isn't a free and in-depth student board member training.

01:24:46.249 --> 01:24:56.514
There are organizations that specify board member training, like CASC and CSBA, where the training is attended by members of certain districts, but others are not always provided with the same opportunity.

01:24:57.714 --> 01:25:14.227
Audrey Mollet, an Ablin Unified School District student board member, attended a CSBA training and expressed that, although the training was a positive learning experience, I wish there was more district-specific components to guide my experience as a student board member.

01:25:14.768 --> 01:25:21.833
She believes that the district-level training would benefit the students in a greater way to see what their district better needs to serve.

01:25:22.674 --> 01:25:24.715
Yet, she's an example of a fortunate one.

01:25:25.196 --> 01:25:28.858
Many student board members are not able to attend these trainings due to high costs.

01:25:29.479 --> 01:25:32.881
Although there are ways to get scholarships, it's a very limited selection process.

01:25:33.741 --> 01:25:38.104
I personally would not be here today at this conference without a scholarship due to financial circumstances.

01:25:38.725 --> 01:25:42.607
Lacking financial aid leads to the need for student support, which I luckily had.

01:25:43.108 --> 01:25:49.031
But we know that many student board members who need but lack the opportunity to and ability to attend these trainings.

01:25:49.972 --> 01:25:53.375
The way we believe we can fix this by allowing a free training at a district level.

01:25:54.396 --> 01:26:02.803
In a survey conducted by Coagula Institute, 66,000 students were surveyed and it was found that 53% of students felt they did not have a voice in their school.

01:26:03.363 --> 01:26:07.327
And 54% of students felt that they were not a valued number in their school community.

01:26:08.167 --> 01:26:09.307
But all hope is not lost.

01:26:09.727 --> 01:26:14.069
Students believed that they did have a voice, were seven times more likely to be academically involved.

01:26:14.729 --> 01:26:20.751
We believe that increasing the voice of the students begins with maximizing the mechanisms of the student voice that already exists.

01:26:21.671 --> 01:26:28.933
This can easily be executed through our proposal of creating a statewide blueprint and training student board members to reach their full potentials.

01:26:29.813 --> 01:26:40.530
As we know, there are applications and ways for individuals to join district boards as a student member, but in order to accurately voice the student's opinions and concerns, the board members need training.

01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:55.281
Creating this process will allow student board members to be more self-aware and aware of their surrounding peers and community through lack of support of state holders in the education.

01:26:56.322 --> 01:27:04.589
This concern of student voice and the student board members would become involved with the needs of the school and the students and be able to speak upon important educational topics.

01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:09.893
Training districts and student board members will allow them to gain credibility and trust within the state of California.

01:27:10.413 --> 01:27:18.099
Similar to how Brenna, the state student board member, is trained by the State Board of Education, helping her students' needs with an extensive knowledge base.

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:28.207
Why are we not training our district student board members at the same capacity that we are training our CSBE board member when we have those training materials?

01:27:29.048 --> 01:27:37.038
The improved communication between the board level policies in the classroom will help close the gap through the explanation of student board members.

01:27:37.539 --> 01:27:44.327
Therefore, we urge the California Department of Education to provide a blueprint on how to train student board members.

01:27:45.288 --> 01:27:50.932
Many states, including Oregon, Texas, and New York, have already created these student board member training processes.

01:27:51.372 --> 01:27:55.655
Why is California, a progressive education state, falling short?

01:27:55.995 --> 01:28:03.581
California needs to meet these other states in preparing their student success, especially in standing up for their own needs.

01:28:04.121 --> 01:28:06.223
Being a student board member has a steep learning curve.

01:28:07.043 --> 01:28:13.206
And in most cases, student board members only serve for one year, and when the next student board member enters, they're just as unprepared as the last.

01:28:13.827 --> 01:28:23.432
With this tool of developing a training system, districts will be able to ensure that students enter the board member position, prepare to serve effectively, and create a positive change for students they represent.

01:28:23.912 --> 01:28:24.593
Thank you for your time.

01:28:29.975 --> 01:28:34.518
So let's have the committee that helped develop this recommendation come forward.

01:28:41.556 --> 01:28:45.092
and see if we have any comments from our board.

01:28:53.117 --> 01:29:01.203
First of all, thank you all for your desire to be well educated as board members.

01:29:01.603 --> 01:29:12.090
We'd like all board members to want that kind of training and it's just really a wonderful thing to hear about students both desiring to be effective and understanding that

01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:16.833
there are ways to actually get that background information to do so.

01:29:16.933 --> 01:29:24.396
So I just want to congratulate you on both the desire for learning and the very good ideas for how to acquire it.

01:29:24.616 --> 01:29:30.238
And I know it's something that we will want to be advocating for in the in the work in this state.

01:29:30.258 --> 01:29:34.660
Okay, thank you.

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.121
Well, we have another comment.

01:29:36.661 --> 01:29:37.542
Oh, sorry, I didn't see.

01:29:37.762 --> 01:29:38.162
Go ahead, please.

01:29:39.902 --> 01:29:50.994
Thank you for that and I'm sorry I missed some of the presentation, but you know as you were presenting, I honestly don't know that we gave board member pendulum and a lot of onboarding training I think all of us just come in.

01:29:51.595 --> 01:29:53.657
No, it's just like, hi, you're here.

01:29:54.658 --> 01:29:57.120
And so I think that that would be a really action.

01:29:57.941 --> 01:30:07.505
I think it's a great idea though because I know that because of the recommendations we heard last year, we now have a student that will be joining the Instructional Quality Commission.

01:30:07.965 --> 01:30:16.309
And so it is important for us to prep the students and let them know just make sure that you have an authentic voice at the table.

01:30:16.349 --> 01:30:24.032
We never want a student who comes into the room serving as the only student and then getting their energy sucked by all the adults in the room, right?

01:30:24.532 --> 01:30:27.414
And so, and which it happens, and it could be very intimidating.

01:30:27.814 --> 01:30:40.301
So I do think that if we consider putting more students in different commissions, there has to be an onboarding process for them so they understand why were you selected, why is your voice important, how does it work to turn on the mic?

01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:44.843
The small things from the logistical things, the reimbursement eventually will be huge.

01:30:45.064 --> 01:30:50.987
We never want a student who should be at the table not being able to travel because they don't have credit cards, they don't have money.

01:30:51.287 --> 01:30:52.948
That is a reality of many of our families.

01:30:53.388 --> 01:31:02.744
And so I wanna make sure that we are very thoughtful in when we bring students so that they understand what their role is and also what the task is at hand.

01:31:02.964 --> 01:31:04.146
So thank you for that recommendation.

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:17.695
Okay, well, thank you all very much for the work, the rewrite, the research, all the data and your passion for wanting to be an informed voice to help us with our work and at your local level too.

01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:18.776
So thank you very much.

01:31:19.236 --> 01:31:23.961
And we have one more group that we're gonna hear about that will be a different proposal as well.

01:31:24.041 --> 01:31:24.862
So thank you very much.

01:31:40.151 --> 01:31:43.132
Good morning, distinguished board members and Superintendent Thurman.

01:31:43.392 --> 01:31:44.712
My name is Estrella Pacheco.

01:31:45.013 --> 01:31:48.614
I attend the Annalee High School in the West Sonoma County Union High School District.

01:31:49.574 --> 01:31:53.435
And I am here today to speak to you about sustainability in education.

01:31:54.916 --> 01:32:01.718
For the fourth time in a period of three years, students in my county have been unable to attend school because of a natural disaster.

01:32:02.847 --> 01:32:10.368
Just this last week, a quarter of a million students, including myself, were out of schools statewide due to wildfires.

01:32:11.668 --> 01:32:25.271
California's fourth climate change assessment projects that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, wildfires that burn over 25,000 acres will increase in frequency by 50% during the next 100 years.

01:32:26.711 --> 01:32:31.932
Evidence like this has created growing concern among California students regarding the current climate crisis.

01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:35.573
and the detrimental effects it will continue to have on posterity.

01:32:36.514 --> 01:32:44.242
These concerns include deterioration of health, loss of school days, progression to an unlivable planet, and lower quality of life.

01:32:45.523 --> 01:32:55.414
With this in mind, our group has created a proposal that will both provide ways for students to move towards a sustainable future and outline model practices to achieve this.

01:32:57.383 --> 01:33:05.834
Currently, local education agencies are required to address eight statewide priorities on their local control accountability plan or LCAP.

01:33:06.555 --> 01:33:11.762
Within the first priority area, basic services, schools currently address three key areas.

01:33:12.363 --> 01:33:17.427
These being one, teachers are assigned and fully credentialed for the students they are teaching.

01:33:17.867 --> 01:33:23.211
Two, students have access to standards aligned instructional materials resources.

01:33:23.451 --> 01:33:27.394
And three, school facilities are maintained in good repair.

01:33:29.215 --> 01:33:37.601
Our proposal is that the LCAP template be modified to add a fourth key area called school facilities are environmentally sustainable.

01:33:38.874 --> 01:33:46.160
As the State Board of Education is currently updating the framework of the LCAP, the addition of the fourth key area is timely and easily implementable.

01:33:48.402 --> 01:33:52.566
I'm sure you are all concerned that we are trying to add a new priority to the LCAP.

01:33:53.047 --> 01:33:54.448
I assure you, we are not.

01:33:55.289 --> 01:34:00.473
We understand that adding a priority to the LCAP requires legislative action, which is not under your jurisdiction.

01:34:01.254 --> 01:34:05.678
To clarify again, we are not proposing the addition of a new priority.

01:34:08.288 --> 01:34:13.394
What we are proposing is the addition of a new key area under an existing priority.

01:34:13.875 --> 01:34:16.678
Doing this is under the jurisdiction of the State Board of Education.

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:24.208
This way, when local educational agencies are developing their LCAPs with stakeholders, they are considering goals and actions that address sustainability.

01:34:25.865 --> 01:34:37.534
By adding the environmental impact of facilities as a key area within basic services on the LCAP, schools would actively create goals to work towards sustainability when developing their funding plans.

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:46.301
The LCAP would also recommend that schools implement model practices outlined in our proposal or sustainable practices within infrastructure.

01:34:47.162 --> 01:34:50.605
This would increase the standard for sustainability in California's education.

01:34:52.321 --> 01:34:57.804
California is often acknowledged for being notably progressive in regards to environmental policy and action.

01:34:59.085 --> 01:35:07.470
In 2018, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 100, which states that California will transition to 100% renewable energy by 2045.

01:35:07.670 --> 01:35:13.433
This simply cannot be accomplished without the cooperation of the school system.

01:35:14.514 --> 01:35:20.357
As the state is already moving towards this goal, our schools should be fully able to join in on this transition.

01:35:21.434 --> 01:35:40.386
Blueprints from the California Department of Education and both the Senate and Assembly bills provide guidelines not only for easily adoptable and sustainable practices in school districts, but also for methods to measure progress and effectiveness of their action plans using water usage, energy usage, carbon footprints, and other metrics.

01:35:41.526 --> 01:35:50.012
The addition of this segment to the LCAP would provide districts with plans to move towards sustainability, which are concrete, feasible, and proven to be effective.

01:35:50.953 --> 01:36:06.141
In the city of Salinas, the transition to the use of solar and LED lights are expected to save the Salinas Union High School District $32 million over the next 25 years and offset 826 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

01:36:06.942 --> 01:36:14.026
Imagine both the fiscal and environmental impacts that could be achieved if all California public schools could make a similar transition.

01:36:15.379 --> 01:36:20.903
As microcosms of society, schools provide the perfect opportunity to influence students' actions.

01:36:21.383 --> 01:36:28.007
By implementing sustainable facilities in schools, students will be inclined to make environmentally friendly decisions off campus as well.

01:36:29.028 --> 01:36:40.536
The modification to the LCAP framework would simultaneously counter the effects of the current climate crisis and create environmentally literate students at no additional cost to the California Department of Education.

01:36:41.923 --> 01:36:44.225
The science is clear, the time for action is now.

01:36:44.726 --> 01:36:53.175
There is no reason that California's educational system should not move towards sustainability, as such a transition will protect the future of the students within it.

01:36:54.116 --> 01:37:02.385
It is certain that the climate crisis will change our schools, but it is up to those who oversee our education to determine whether these changes will be detrimental or not.

01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:12.075
By choosing to implement this proposal, you will help our schools create a path for California's students to have a positive, sustainable, and livable future.

01:37:12.395 --> 01:37:13.676
Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:37:20.041 --> 01:37:22.082
Will the students in this committee come forward?

01:37:29.607 --> 01:37:31.749
Member Rucker, as soon as they're here, then you can start.

01:37:43.206 --> 01:37:47.550
Well, first of all, I want to thank all of you for your very thoughtful and very creative idea.

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:58.920
You know, I have family who live across the country in other states, and when they watch the news about the fires in California, not really understanding the geography of California,

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:11.188
they will call me with great concern to ask me how close the fires are and should they be concerned, do I need money and all of those types of things.

01:38:11.608 --> 01:38:22.675
So while I appreciate that, what I become aware of, especially today, is that for a lot of folks, the environmental concerns that have directly impacted

01:38:23.135 --> 01:38:27.917
you, and particularly Australia, are things that are just news items.

01:38:27.957 --> 01:38:32.078
It's not personal to them and it's not of a great concern to them.

01:38:32.558 --> 01:38:47.824
What I appreciate about what you all did with your proposal today is you made it clear that our schools are a contributing factor to the very problems and the very personal impact that you have experienced multiple times in your life.

01:38:48.504 --> 01:38:58.534
And this is something that this is another thing that we that demonstrates how we compartmentalize the conversation about climate change and the impact of climate change.

01:38:58.935 --> 01:39:04.521
So what I appreciate most about what you suggest is not only why it's important,

01:39:04.901 --> 01:39:25.183
but understanding how it changes the way we have this conversation and how it changes the way we choose to live with this conversation by modeling that it's not something singularly compartmentalized to an area of policy about changing gas emissions or changing the kind of cars and the type of energy we use,

01:39:25.583 --> 01:39:30.709
but also creating the environments that students live and work and learn in.

01:39:31.089 --> 01:39:35.694
So I really appreciate your proposal and I do support this notion and this idea.

01:39:35.734 --> 01:39:41.140
I know that there's more to making changes on the LCAP template than just simply

01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:57.789
adding a statement like this, but for students, it makes the students who especially have been in areas impacted like yours, it changes the complexion of the conversation to know that there's another part of this discussion, another part of the policy community

01:39:58.169 --> 01:40:01.591
that's choosing to get engaged in a very specific way.

01:40:01.651 --> 01:40:10.237
So, I appreciate not only your articulate argument, but also the rationale about what the sustained effect of a proposal as simple as that can be.

01:40:10.297 --> 01:40:12.478
So, thank you so very much for being here today.

01:40:21.274 --> 01:40:27.740
You've brought, yes, great job, and you've brought us full circle from our conversation this morning, so we appreciate that, too.

01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:41.473
This has been a theme of the day, and you've come up with a really good, concrete proposal for how to advance the cause, so we appreciate your thinking concretely as well as passionately about the issue.

01:40:42.566 --> 01:41:03.874
I'll just close by thanking this committee and all the other committees for not only making a strong argument to us, but the research that you gave us to support your arguments around data and research that you did and looking at our website and all of our links really showed the thought and the depth of trying to build on what we're doing.

01:41:04.574 --> 01:41:08.296
really to a credit to all the students who participated in the organization of it.

01:41:08.596 --> 01:41:14.600
We just really appreciate the thought and commitment and the persuasiveness and the arguments that you made for us.

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:16.281
So thank you all very, very much.

01:41:22.585 --> 01:41:25.687
Did you want to get a photo with the students or?

01:41:26.687 --> 01:41:29.289
Okay, all right.

01:41:29.369 --> 01:41:29.749
I'm fine.

01:41:32.691 --> 01:41:43.599
Thank you again to the esteemed board members, Vice President Strauss, President Darling-Hamden, and Superintendent Thurmond for listening to our proposals from this year's SAVE Conference.

01:41:44.119 --> 01:41:52.365
And I sincerely hope that very shortly we can turn these ideas that started in a conference room into actions implemented by you, the State Board of Education.

01:41:53.706 --> 01:41:54.367
Thank you for your time.

01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:16.605
I think we want to appreciate all of the groups and say how much it brings inspiration and

01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:35.379
sort of reassurance to us about the future of our state to see the quality of passion, commitment, and thinking that this process and these students have brought.

01:42:36.179 --> 01:42:39.742
So I think at this point, we're going to go on with the agenda.

01:42:40.603 --> 01:42:44.687
Students, if you're ready to move on, you can.

01:42:44.807 --> 01:42:49.831
But if you want to sit for the state board meeting, you're also welcome to educate yourselves further.

01:42:51.572 --> 01:42:54.353
And we'll give you a minute to exit if you'd like to.

01:42:54.373 --> 01:43:01.175
Yeah, not for too long.

01:43:01.535 --> 01:43:02.575
We should take a photo.

01:43:02.615 --> 01:43:05.356
Yeah, right, for all the... Either is fine, yeah.

01:43:05.376 --> 01:43:07.737
1130, we'll... Do you want me to meet you up there?

01:43:07.797 --> 01:43:08.457
Okay.

01:43:08.577 --> 01:43:10.157
I'll meet you in your office then.

01:43:10.177 --> 01:43:10.717
Okay.

01:48:42.691 --> 01:48:43.512
Reconvene.

01:48:46.618 --> 01:48:50.345
Thank everyone for your perseverance, stamina.

01:48:52.535 --> 01:48:57.299
We're going to move on to agenda item 3, which is the system of support item.

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:01.843
CDE will be presenting.

01:49:02.683 --> 01:49:04.585
Stephanie Gregson will be presenting for us.

01:49:04.645 --> 01:49:10.170
The CDE is requesting feedback on the continued development of the statewide system of support.

01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:13.413
No action is being recommended at this time.

01:49:14.454 --> 01:49:16.956
So, Stephanie, please proceed.

01:49:17.316 --> 01:49:18.618
Yes, good morning everyone.

01:49:18.638 --> 01:49:23.947
We're excited today to present about the progress on the system of support because as we know, this is a journey.

01:49:25.035 --> 01:49:31.079
This is a journey that we're on together in this work and with me I have Ronnie Jones from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

01:49:31.399 --> 01:49:34.841
They are our partners along with the state board in the system of support.

01:49:35.541 --> 01:49:53.732
As you might remember, the system of support is made up of geographic leads, SELPA system improvement and content leads, multi-tiered system of support lead, the community engagement lead, the Title III English learner liaison that's a lead for the 11 English learner leads across the state,

01:49:54.452 --> 01:49:56.955
equity leads and the early math initiative.

01:49:57.395 --> 01:50:08.867
These lead agencies were selected because they have the experience or expertise in specific areas described in the statute and this map shows you the coverage of California with all of the different leads.

01:50:10.441 --> 01:50:29.030
The intended purpose of the statewide system of support is to provide coherent and effective supports to local education agencies through coordinated activities between the California Department of Education, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, and the State Board of Education, and the lead agencies on the previous slide.

01:50:29.971 --> 01:50:30.531
And it's growing.

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:38.395
The intent is growing, as we've learned and had a discussion about yesterday with our panel discussion on our data pieces.

01:50:40.037 --> 01:50:57.754
Research tells us that coherent and effective systems create intentional connections, are interdependent, adapt to new learnings and shifting environment, such as the introduction of the California School Leadership Academy and the Educator Workforce Investment Grant, and I think there will be more.

01:50:58.609 --> 01:51:05.495
Okay, and positively, and this is most important, and positively impact student opportunities and outcomes.

01:51:06.295 --> 01:51:15.243
Our goal for the system of support is to ensure that all LEAs have access to the supports they need to improve outcomes and opportunities for students.

01:51:15.843 --> 01:51:18.405
This means that the systems we're building looks like this web.

01:51:19.566 --> 01:51:24.508
If the LEAs are the blue marbles, then the lead agencies are the black and gray marbles.

01:51:25.749 --> 01:51:41.636
This system supports capacity building at both the LEA and county office of education level, develops and shares and implements resources targeted to local needs, and facilitate improvement and equity in the LEAs and the county offices across our state.

01:51:42.216 --> 01:51:43.597
This is a complex structure.

01:51:44.637 --> 01:51:50.121
And I'll turn this over to Ronnie to explain the complexities and set context for our presentation today.

01:51:51.022 --> 01:51:51.222
Great.

01:51:51.282 --> 01:51:51.983
Thanks very much.

01:51:52.423 --> 01:51:53.684
As Stephanie said, I'm Ronnie Jones.

01:51:53.724 --> 01:51:58.288
I'm the senior manager for the system of support for the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

01:51:59.148 --> 01:52:05.854
And what we want to do today with our presentation is to communicate to you the different layers of the system of support.

01:52:06.394 --> 01:52:13.618
And so today you're going to hear from the Kern County Superintendent of Schools Office, who has been selected as a geographic lead for their area.

01:52:14.699 --> 01:52:23.524
And you're going to hear also from one of their partners, the Selpa System Improvement Leads, who they're working with around their area of focus.

01:52:23.984 --> 01:52:35.471
And so during the presentation, you might hear about the initiatives that are represented on the graphic in front of you, which makes it seem like it's pretty small and it's pretty limited in its scope.

01:52:35.971 --> 01:52:42.693
But what we want to do is we actually want you to think about the system that we're talking about more in the scope that you see on this graphic.

01:52:43.093 --> 01:52:55.337
Not only will you hear about the work that Kern County is doing with its partner county offices, but please remember that each of those partner county offices are connected to all of the LEAs within their counties.

01:52:55.718 --> 01:53:00.499
So those are connections that you can make sure that you're envisioning as Kern is presenting about their work.

01:53:01.359 --> 01:53:02.360
Also know that

01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:10.085
that there are going to be connections that they may not be able to talk about just given the limited time of their presentation today.

01:53:10.565 --> 01:53:23.434
So Kern County not only is working with the self-assisted improvement leads, but they're also partnering with the multi-tiered systems of supports, MTSS, who are in turn connected with LEAs across the state.

01:53:24.254 --> 01:53:31.237
Other connections that you may not hear about today, or you may only hear about briefly, is the connection through some of their other county offices.

01:53:31.277 --> 01:53:33.798
You can see on this graphic that L.A.

01:53:33.858 --> 01:53:43.821
County Office of Ed is working in partnership with the Community Engagement Initiative, which has some peer learning and leading networks, and I believe Ventura County is also working with them.

01:53:43.961 --> 01:53:48.503
At some point, the graphic became too confusing if we tried to put all the connections on there.

01:53:49.163 --> 01:54:02.406
And then you'll also see that the geographic leads are coming together on a regular basis in order to share resources across the state and ensure that, as Stephanie said, that we have coherent and effective systems.

01:54:03.266 --> 01:54:14.369
So one of the things that we just want to highlight is that in the past there have been questions about, well, how are all of the geographic leads and the county offices calibrating their support for districts?

01:54:14.429 --> 01:54:17.550
And so today Kern County is going to talk about that, about how

01:54:17.970 --> 01:54:23.665
They are sharing and improving differentiated assistance strategies across their geographic area.

01:54:25.633 --> 01:54:34.356
But the previous graphic actually made it seem as though Kern County as a geographic lead might be a gatekeeper to some of the resources.

01:54:34.677 --> 01:54:46.721
But we also wanted you to know that the system not only is spread out like a web, but there are also layers within the system so that different counties are connecting with the leads maybe on their own or with other county offices to partner.

01:54:47.642 --> 01:54:53.864
Today, Kern County is going to talk a little bit about in depth that partnership with the system improvement lead, but also about

01:54:54.224 --> 01:54:59.467
how their partner counties are connecting with one another through differentiated assistance case studies.

01:55:00.067 --> 01:55:22.520
So, again, today, during the presentation, it may sound, when Kern's doing their presentation, as though it's a simple connection of one county talking to another, but know that these complex webs of relationships are developing within the system of support, and at any time, if you have questions after the presentation, we'd be happy to answer more in depth about some of these things.

01:55:23.620 --> 01:55:34.954
So today, to get us started with our presentation, we're going to ask Kristen Wright, the Director of Special Education, to come up and give us a little bit of context around students with disabilities in the state of California.

01:55:40.111 --> 01:55:51.238
So Ronnie will be familiar with this conversation that we've had at the collaborative, but if I go back to those two charts, there's sort of two things that strike me.

01:55:51.618 --> 01:55:56.901
One is that the LEA that is seeking differentiated assistance should be at the core.

01:55:57.982 --> 01:56:00.143
If I'm unicorn school district,

01:56:00.823 --> 01:56:06.987
And I say, I have a lot of trouble in reading with my third grade African American students.

01:56:07.227 --> 01:56:08.468
Who do I turn to?

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:13.231
I feel like all of our conversations are coming from the top down.

01:56:13.691 --> 01:56:15.713
And we're doing a lot to try to figure this out.

01:56:16.093 --> 01:56:23.117
And you know me, all of these acronyms, I'm thinking about people who are watching this on the screen going, what on earth are they talking about?

01:56:23.658 --> 01:56:27.120
And DA case studies sounds like a criminal activity to me.

01:56:29.381 --> 01:56:31.424
I know for sure we don't intend it to be.

01:56:32.305 --> 01:56:39.173
So anyway, I'm struggling a bit here with the communication and I'm struggling with the lens through which we're viewing this.

01:56:40.214 --> 01:56:46.882
I want our lens to be, how do we help a teacher in a classroom improve the outcomes for those students?

01:56:47.422 --> 01:56:49.063
And this, I get lost in this.

01:56:49.323 --> 01:56:52.205
And as you know, I'm fairly well informed about it.

01:56:52.625 --> 01:56:56.587
So just a suggestion about how going forward we communicate with it.

01:56:56.947 --> 01:57:03.190
And I don't wanna like pull a fast one on Mary and Kern County and go, okay, I want you to like completely redo your presentation.

01:57:03.690 --> 01:57:08.513
But I do want us all to think about that as we move forward and we continue to talk about this.

01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:10.151
Thank you.

01:57:10.211 --> 01:57:15.574
So I think Kern is prepared to talk about their connections with LEAs and that work that they're doing.

01:57:15.654 --> 01:57:25.279
And then throughout the presentation, too, we also are going to hear from Ed Manansala, and he has brought a district superintendent with him to talk about how they're receiving services within their district.

01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:26.060
Thank you.

01:57:30.333 --> 01:57:33.054
And I can assure you that we're going to get a little bit in the weeds.

01:57:33.975 --> 01:57:41.719
We were worried maybe a little too much in the weeds, but it sounds like you want to hear some weeds around how this is going to connect actually to helping our districts.

01:57:41.779 --> 01:57:47.681
And I feel a personal sense of gratitude in a way that we are

01:57:49.062 --> 01:57:50.543
being incredibly responsive.

01:57:51.523 --> 01:58:05.430
When the flashlight was shined from the dashboard the last few years, the state has pivoted and basically gathered together to surround how we assist our districts in serving our students with disabilities.

01:58:05.471 --> 01:58:12.934
And I just wanted to make sure to bring my favorite slide in the whole wide world, which is really talking about that overlap between the student groups.

01:58:13.235 --> 01:58:17.657
And I think what you'll see today is that the collective of individuals coming together

01:58:18.826 --> 01:58:20.908
are coming together around whole children.

01:58:21.448 --> 01:58:30.336
The fact that we have children who are students of color, who are students who are English learners, who are many other things besides students with disabilities.

01:58:30.997 --> 01:58:41.226
And certainly at the statewide level, we're trying, and why this is so critical is we're really trying to model at the state level that we are all in this together for all students.

01:58:41.386 --> 01:58:43.668
And personally, you know,

01:58:44.469 --> 01:58:49.150
having the special ed division under my purview, we feel like part of a larger system now.

01:58:49.650 --> 01:58:53.571
Whereas before it was like something was going on with special ed, special ed needs to fix it.

01:58:54.051 --> 01:59:05.114
And so I hope that that's what you'll take from today is that there is truly a statewide effort to encircle all students in all schools, in all districts to help make this happen.

01:59:05.154 --> 01:59:07.595
And the capacity building that it takes to do that

01:59:08.876 --> 01:59:22.796
has been a challenge and an opportunity and so I feel like the fact that district superintendents are saying the words performance indicator review and they know those are about the federal indicators for students with disabilities and all those things, it's a different day than we were talking about a few years ago.

01:59:23.417 --> 01:59:40.791
So, just reminding us that in California, our students with disabilities represent about 11.6% of the student population, but if you look at the other student groups, they represent more of a piece of that pie, which makes it even more important that we're working across titles.

01:59:40.971 --> 01:59:45.194
And I'll just highlight a second about our work around English learners.

01:59:46.255 --> 02:00:02.501
that over the last year we've developed an English learner practitioners guide for English learners with disabilities and have had the opportunity to go across the state and working with a lot of districts and county offices around pushing that out for folks to gather around.

02:00:02.561 --> 02:00:13.726
As you know, it's really great to have something to work around instead of just an idea and have some real solutions to provide real professional development to our teachers and our educators and giving them something to go to.

02:00:15.146 --> 02:00:28.691
So again, and this has stayed consistent the last three years, our students with disabilities are represented, 70% of them are in one or more of the local control funding formula student groups.

02:00:28.811 --> 02:00:31.572
And so we're really talking about the same children.

02:00:31.732 --> 02:00:35.414
And again, I'm really excited to talk about this collaborative

02:00:36.494 --> 02:00:39.437
Our SELPA leads are making us proud.

02:00:40.558 --> 02:00:43.381
We, as you know, have two types of SELPA leads.

02:00:43.441 --> 02:00:53.571
The system improvement leads, which are really working around how districts can understand their data around special education and that relationship to the larger system, as well as our content leads.

02:00:53.951 --> 02:00:57.194
One of them is the English learner with disabilities content lead.

02:00:57.795 --> 02:01:00.818
Another one is around disproportionality, doing some great work around

02:01:01.238 --> 02:01:07.139
predictive analysis and helping districts before they're disproportionate see a trend that's going in a negative direction.

02:01:08.179 --> 02:01:25.503
And so basically today they're going to talk about how we're using data to concentrate efforts, really implementing feedback loops, improving the differentiated assistance process to be more responsive, depending on what happens year to year, and partnering really across the system of support to build capacity.

02:01:26.523 --> 02:01:32.528
And so I'm going to ask the Valley to Coast Collaborative to come up and then they'll introduce themselves.

02:01:33.128 --> 02:01:34.469
We'll start with with Mary.

02:01:36.091 --> 02:01:36.391
Thank you.

02:01:38.653 --> 02:01:40.014
Thank you, board members.

02:01:40.314 --> 02:01:55.386
We're very honored to be here today to share with you the work of the Valley to Coast Collaborative and how we are using and leveraging relationships within the statewide system of support to improve outcomes for students with disabilities.

02:01:59.565 --> 02:02:02.207
So I want to share a little bit of information with you.

02:02:02.267 --> 02:02:04.089
My colleagues will introduce themselves.

02:02:04.149 --> 02:02:06.911
They are here behind me as they come up.

02:02:07.451 --> 02:02:18.920
It's been very worthwhile to put pen to paper and really think back about the work that we've engaged in over the past 10 months that we've been part of this geo area work.

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:23.604
Just as a refresher, the Valley to Coast Collaborative includes Fresno Kern,

02:02:24.765 --> 02:02:31.013
Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, Ventura, and Santa Barbara County Offices of Education.

02:02:32.015 --> 02:02:37.162
And as you might know, of these six County Offices of Education serving 207 districts,

02:02:39.565 --> 02:02:45.506
with 3,244 schools over 2.1 million students.

02:02:46.166 --> 02:03:07.610
Now 36% of those districts are in fact eligible for differentiated assistance and of those 36%, 70% of those districts are eligible based on outcomes for students with disabilities and 43% of those districts are in their second year of eligibility and when diving into

02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:32.215
The data that is why we as a geo area decided this would be the focus of our initial work as partners So our goal today is to do three things We want to ensure that we inform the board about How we went about this process so that you can understand the continuous improvement process that was used by our geo area work group

02:03:32.995 --> 02:03:40.803
to develop an action plan based upon how we would provide outcomes and improve outcomes for students with disabilities.

02:03:41.224 --> 02:03:51.774
We want to talk to you a little bit about our continuous improvement process and how we are using that to build the capacity of all COEs within our geo area.

02:03:52.916 --> 02:04:07.542
Secondly, we would like you to understand how we have engaged and leveraged partnerships across the system of support to calibrate, to coordinate, and ultimately to address our own problem of practice as geo areas.

02:04:08.402 --> 02:04:14.548
So we are learning together and how we will continue to build those supports for the LEAs within our area.

02:04:15.409 --> 02:04:20.774
And finally, three, we would like to inform you of our anticipated next steps.

02:04:21.415 --> 02:04:32.826
And to give you detailed information about the continuous improvement process and how that directly impacts local education agencies, I'll turn it over to my colleague, Dr. Rob Arias.

02:04:36.971 --> 02:04:37.372
Good morning.

02:04:38.793 --> 02:04:50.048
So as Dr. Barlow stated, one of our outcomes for today is to understand the process that we used in our geo area in order to determine our game plan and our work together.

02:04:51.369 --> 02:04:53.352
So in our original geo grant,

02:04:53.712 --> 02:04:55.393
Go ahead and click to the next slide.

02:04:56.894 --> 02:05:10.725
We determined that we weren't going to actually create a plan independently in Kern County, that instead we were going to work as a team, as a geo lead in order to determine what our work would look like and ultimately what an action plan would look like.

02:05:11.780 --> 02:05:34.862
In addition, we determined that we would use Kern County's continuous improvement process, which we had great success with, with school districts in our county that were eligible for differentiated assistance, as well as county offices in our geo area that were eligible for differentiated assistance, that we would use that continuous improvement process in order to determine what our action plan might look like.

02:05:35.905 --> 02:05:40.468
So the slide that you see here on the screen is a depiction of that process.

02:05:40.488 --> 02:05:46.611
So what I'd like to do is just take you through each of those steps to describe how we go about actually organizing our work.

02:05:47.852 --> 02:05:50.793
So as you can see, our process begins with data inquiry.

02:05:51.254 --> 02:05:54.415
If you don't know where you are, you're not going to know where you're going.

02:05:55.576 --> 02:06:03.961
So we spend time with our geo area leads, or excuse me, geo area partners, understanding what data we're going to actually look at.

02:06:05.213 --> 02:06:22.977
process data, we look at outcome data, and we look at perception data, and we first determine what data do we need to understand, what data do we need to collect, what data do we need to analyze in order to understand the current health, the status of our geographic area.

02:06:23.577 --> 02:06:28.899
So our skilled facilitators take us through a process of understanding what that looks like.

02:06:29.319 --> 02:06:33.920
We go through an analysis of our data in order to determine what the current status of our area is.

02:06:34.921 --> 02:06:37.661
Specifically, we looked at the California dashboard, for example.

02:06:37.721 --> 02:06:39.162
We looked at student outcome data.

02:06:39.602 --> 02:06:40.643
We looked at indicators.

02:06:40.703 --> 02:06:43.124
We looked at LEA type and size.

02:06:43.564 --> 02:06:49.308
We looked, of course, at the DA status across our geo area of our individual county offices.

02:06:49.988 --> 02:06:57.533
And we also studied the level one services and level two services that are currently being provided by our county offices in our geo area.

02:06:58.860 --> 02:07:03.564
An important step here or point to make is that data inquiry is not a one and done.

02:07:04.485 --> 02:07:08.608
Data inquiry in our process all it's depicted here is you start there and you end there.

02:07:08.948 --> 02:07:10.329
That's really not what happens.

02:07:10.510 --> 02:07:20.718
We come back to data on a regular basis as we learn more about what it is we don't know or perhaps something that we need to study or understand more clearly.

02:07:21.198 --> 02:07:29.351
So as a result, I'd like you to, if you could, imagine that data inquiry is something that we revisit on a regular basis, depending on what our learning needs to be.

02:07:30.785 --> 02:07:32.307
So data inquiry sets the stage.

02:07:32.847 --> 02:07:35.730
It grounds us on basically our current status.

02:07:36.271 --> 02:07:40.855
The next step in our process is the identification of a problem of practice.

02:07:41.696 --> 02:07:51.245
Dr. Einstein once said if I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes actually trying to understand what the problem is and five minutes developing a solution for that problem.

02:07:51.906 --> 02:07:54.348
So this is one of the basic tenets of our work.

02:07:55.289 --> 02:07:57.592
Traditionally, I think we're all probably guilty of it.

02:07:57.632 --> 02:08:06.483
I was a superintendent and I was guilty of it as well at certain times in my tenure and that I see a problem or we collectively see a problem and we go right to solutions.

02:08:06.523 --> 02:08:08.986
We start defining what it is that we're going to do about that.

02:08:10.487 --> 02:08:22.373
Our process slows down that natural adult tendency to go to solutions and instead really take the time, thoughtful time necessary in order to identify what are we actually trying to solve.

02:08:22.594 --> 02:08:27.056
And this is the process that we went through to design the work of our geo area.

02:08:29.332 --> 02:08:30.813
The next is root cause analysis.

02:08:30.853 --> 02:08:34.156
This is another important tenet of continuous improvement in general.

02:08:34.816 --> 02:08:38.339
Root cause analysis is what is creating the problem.

02:08:38.499 --> 02:08:42.722
What's causing the problem to occur or what's contributing to the problem.

02:08:43.963 --> 02:08:51.649
An important point here is that we actually create an action plan ultimately around those root causes and that really

02:08:52.597 --> 02:08:55.419
attacking the problem of practice directly.

02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:58.963
We're tracking it indirectly by addressing those root causes.

02:08:59.123 --> 02:09:02.646
An important distinction, something again that traditionally that we don't do.

02:09:02.906 --> 02:09:06.689
Generally, we're working on a problem, we see the problem, let's find solutions and solve the problem.

02:09:07.190 --> 02:09:11.533
Instead, what we're trying to do is exterminate or alleviate those root causes that we identify.

02:09:12.554 --> 02:09:16.978
We go through a process of prioritizing what those root causes might be.

02:09:17.098 --> 02:09:20.261
So you can imagine that if you have a specific problem of practice,

02:09:20.936 --> 02:09:24.459
that there are many things contributing to that particular problem.

02:09:25.880 --> 02:09:35.007
We go through a, you probably have heard of the five whys, or you've heard of a fishbone activity in order to drill down into what specifically the causes might be.

02:09:35.027 --> 02:09:39.071
Important piece here is that we try to look in the mirror, not out the window.

02:09:39.551 --> 02:09:45.773
We're trying to identify what it is that the adults in the organizations are doing to contribute to the problem.

02:09:46.173 --> 02:09:49.675
This is not about blaming parents or blaming students in this process.

02:09:49.975 --> 02:09:51.915
This is really about what the adults are doing.

02:09:54.796 --> 02:09:57.337
The next step in the process is a theory of action.

02:09:57.357 --> 02:09:58.598
I'm sure you've heard of that before.

02:09:58.658 --> 02:10:01.038
It's borrowed from the scientific methodology.

02:10:02.079 --> 02:10:04.900
If we do this and if we do that, then this.

02:10:05.623 --> 02:10:09.928
So we take those prioritized root causes and we convert them into a theory of action.

02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:16.577
That theory of action is basically putting a stake in the ground stating this is what we're going to work on.

02:10:17.198 --> 02:10:20.061
If we do this and if we do that, then this will occur.

02:10:20.121 --> 02:10:23.105
We will extinguish or eliminate the problem practice.

02:10:23.586 --> 02:10:24.367
It's an important step.

02:10:25.919 --> 02:10:30.721
We always get distracted, I think, by any number of priorities that are around us.

02:10:31.342 --> 02:10:34.543
It's important to identify what it is we say we're going to do.

02:10:34.743 --> 02:10:39.005
It sets the stage for measurement and for monitoring as well.

02:10:39.585 --> 02:10:44.748
It prevents us from chasing rabbits, to be perfectly honest.

02:10:44.828 --> 02:10:48.189
It focuses on specific work that we're intended to do.

02:10:49.870 --> 02:10:51.771
So it's a very important step, the theory of action.

02:10:51.811 --> 02:10:57.513
I'm going to be sharing with you our theory of action to date after we finish with these slides.

02:10:58.774 --> 02:11:03.776
So once we've identified our theory of action, we identify basically initiatives and actions.

02:11:03.836 --> 02:11:10.578
So what initiatives would we create, would we use in order to address each of those if statements?

02:11:10.979 --> 02:11:14.080
So each of our if statements has an action plan around it.

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:19.302
So if we do x, well, we develop an action plan around that specific if statement.

02:11:21.246 --> 02:11:24.548
The action plan is short-term and long-term.

02:11:24.568 --> 02:11:33.933
It's an important piece here in that we create short-term goals and long-term outcomes as well during the action planning process.

02:11:34.625 --> 02:11:37.346
Traditional action planning who's doing what when are they doing it?

02:11:37.426 --> 02:11:56.671
That's all part of that as well But we extend that may be creating outcomes that we're actually trying to address When we're going to monitor and how we're going to monitor them another piece I think that we found through our studies and our work with school districts and other county offices is that We really don't do a good enough job.

02:11:56.711 --> 02:11:58.132
Frankly monitoring our own work.

02:11:58.632 --> 02:12:03.173
I think we're all probably have been a part of creating an action plan

02:12:04.654 --> 02:12:11.379
Either putting it on the shelf or other things take on more priority than our initial action plan.

02:12:11.439 --> 02:12:21.468
So we've embedded some very deliberate steps to monitor our work after creation of an action plan and to analyze where we are in that regard.

02:12:23.075 --> 02:12:31.920
I didn't share this, and Dr. Gilbert, after my piece of this presentation, is going to discuss this, but we have a number of feedback loops throughout our process.

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:45.707
So in our traditional process that we would use for the school district, we would engage stakeholders, parents, board members, teachers, classified employees, administrators in this process and put a team together.

02:12:46.147 --> 02:12:51.650
And that team would identify the problem of practice, the root causes, theory of action, ultimately an action plan.

02:12:53.151 --> 02:13:02.237
Well, we do that in cohorts, so we have other teams that are similar come together and provide feedback on their work along the way.

02:13:03.678 --> 02:13:05.459
This geo area is a little bit different than that.

02:13:05.499 --> 02:13:06.560
We don't have a school district.

02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:10.042
This is a broad geo area, so we engaged the

02:13:10.697 --> 02:13:19.683
players, the actors, the lead agencies, the content experts of the system of support in order to provide that feedback.

02:13:20.104 --> 02:13:22.065
What do you think of our problem of practice?

02:13:22.265 --> 02:13:25.127
Do you think that we have identified the right problem of practice?

02:13:25.347 --> 02:13:26.248
Have we been thoughtful?

02:13:27.128 --> 02:13:27.969
Have we been careful?

02:13:28.029 --> 02:13:30.591
Have we identified the right root causes?

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:39.784
By doing it in that manner, you get a neutral voice, a neutral body that's able to point out, frankly, some areas that perhaps are blind spots for us, right?

02:13:40.264 --> 02:13:43.445
And we encourage that feedback on a regular basis.

02:13:44.486 --> 02:13:48.908
So Dr. Gilbert's going to speak to how we've leveraged those partnerships going forward.

02:13:48.928 --> 02:13:55.051
She's going to speak to specifically what those partnerships look like as we develop our action plan.

02:13:56.311 --> 02:14:03.013
And then lastly, I'd like to describe some of the products that we've created as a result of this process that we've used.

02:14:04.494 --> 02:14:09.196
So our problem of practice is to improve outcomes for students with disabilities.

02:14:09.436 --> 02:14:17.558
We as CSAs need to prioritize building effective partnerships, aligning internal systems, and continuing to develop our expertise to increase the capacity of LEAs.

02:14:18.499 --> 02:14:19.399
So we came together.

02:14:20.287 --> 02:14:26.952
with all of our county offices across our geo area, and we asked ourselves the question, what is our common problem of practice?

02:14:27.413 --> 02:14:29.414
And when you start this process, you have to be authentic.

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:34.758
You can't artificially embed what you believe, current county believes, our problem of practice is.

02:14:34.778 --> 02:14:37.180
You have to let the process take you where it's going.

02:14:38.041 --> 02:14:40.763
And our process went to students with disabilities.

02:14:40.823 --> 02:14:44.546
It was an area that we all collectively did not have an answer to.

02:14:44.966 --> 02:14:48.549
It was a group that we needed to address, and we all shared the same problem.

02:14:51.823 --> 02:14:53.023
So the first if statement.

02:14:53.363 --> 02:14:54.583
So this is our if statement.

02:14:54.623 --> 02:14:55.804
This is our theory of action.

02:14:55.844 --> 02:15:20.648
So if we continue to prioritize, include, and affirm the needs of students with disabilities in our work, and if we continue to develop expertise in providing systemic support to LEAs for students with disabilities, and if we coordinate and calibrate within and among COE departments, SELPAs, and other organizations in the California Statewide System of Support,

02:15:22.429 --> 02:15:27.437
And if we continue to develop consistent and trusting relationships among COEs, LEAs, and SELPAs.

02:15:29.775 --> 02:15:33.977
Then we will increase the capacity of LEAs to improve outcomes for students with disabilities.

02:15:34.017 --> 02:15:36.278
So that's the work that we've done to date.

02:15:37.038 --> 02:15:45.021
We have a meeting actually Friday to continue this particular work to look at the specific initiatives as well as the actions around this work.

02:15:45.101 --> 02:15:46.862
We'd love to share that with you going forward.

02:15:47.342 --> 02:15:54.205
So at this time I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Gilbert to describe the partnerships that we've engaged in.

02:16:00.745 --> 02:16:01.185
Thank you.

02:16:02.506 --> 02:16:02.926
Good morning.

02:16:05.527 --> 02:16:16.852
So as Dr. Arias shared with you a little bit about that process, I'm hoping that you are seeing the importance of relationships within that work.

02:16:17.112 --> 02:16:21.134
In order to get to those really honest, transparent conversations,

02:16:21.874 --> 02:16:38.187
In order to be able to look in the mirror and be honest about what gaps we're seeing and what we need to do better ourselves and that those relationships are really a foundational part of that work and so just please know that as we initiated our geographic area efforts

02:16:38.747 --> 02:16:41.810
And we truly took a collaborative approach.

02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:51.739
We recognize the fact that ourselves as well as all of the other five county offices really bring a lot of expertise, different perspectives into the work.

02:16:52.079 --> 02:16:56.363
And so we've really tried to recognize that and build from that.

02:16:57.063 --> 02:17:18.460
So, as you're very familiar with this graphic, but we wanted to just again recognize that this system has been built out and we are very excited to be a part of this system and have already started benefiting from contacting the other resources within.

02:17:19.861 --> 02:17:22.505
So you're very familiar with this slide as well.

02:17:22.565 --> 02:17:27.493
This just identifies the current lead agencies across the state.

02:17:27.754 --> 02:17:34.764
And so we thought we'd bring this up and kind of share with you how we have connected with and engaged with each of the entities that we have thus far.

02:17:35.485 --> 02:17:38.988
So, the first is the state agencies.

02:17:39.849 --> 02:17:58.025
We have really appreciated CDE and CCE's outreach, the opportunity for them to bring together all leads and really discuss what the system is looking like and how we can come together to build it out to be the most impactful in really changing student outcomes across the state.

02:17:58.765 --> 02:18:01.206
So both CDE and CC have been great partners.

02:18:02.286 --> 02:18:09.287
And in fact, we have invited CDE and CCA staff members to come and be a part of our geographic area meetings.

02:18:10.488 --> 02:18:26.211
Just most recently, Ronnie Jones and Josh Strong came to present to our geographic area information specifically about current events on the statewide system of support, as well as helping us to connect some of the work around differentiated assistance and LCAP and so on.

02:18:27.935 --> 02:18:42.465
The SELPA Systems Improvement Lead Agencies, this has been alluded to, as a geographic area, as we really studied our data, it just became glaringly obvious that our students with disabilities needed some additional support and assistance.

02:18:42.905 --> 02:18:48.829
And again, by looking in the mirror, we recognized as COEs, we had some growing to do as well, right?

02:18:48.849 --> 02:18:51.171
That we needed to build our expertise there.

02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:54.453
So we reached out to the SIL leads,

02:18:55.233 --> 02:18:57.275
immediately became involved in their work.

02:18:57.315 --> 02:19:03.221
They invited us to have conversations with them about a data tool that they were building out, and they got our perspective.

02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:12.550
And then we invited them to come to our geographic area meeting to help us understand that special education world.

02:19:13.710 --> 02:19:18.171
You'll see as they come up, and you mentioned this, Sue, a whole new world of acronyms, right?

02:19:18.251 --> 02:19:25.133
And so as geographic leads, we really started trying to invest in understanding that current reality that our districts are dealing with, right?

02:19:25.153 --> 02:19:32.295
So a lot of our districts are not only identified for differentiated assistance, they're also identified under the quality assurance process.

02:19:32.355 --> 02:19:42.277
And so trying to bridge that gap for our districts and really having that mindset of how can we as county office help them navigate that and streamline our efforts to make sure that we are supporting them in the most meaningful ways.

02:19:43.498 --> 02:19:49.744
And you'll hear a little bit more about some of the specific work that we've been doing together from Jackie Williams after I present.

02:19:50.825 --> 02:19:53.067
Next was the SELPA content lead agencies.

02:19:53.987 --> 02:19:54.188
Ms.

02:19:54.208 --> 02:19:55.289
Wright mentioned these.

02:19:55.609 --> 02:20:05.158
So we have been engaging with these agencies, again, to try to start developing relationships with them because we're not quite sure where our work is going to lead and where we want to necessarily focus.

02:20:06.198 --> 02:20:28.152
But we have asked them to come and throughout our process, as we identified our problem of practice, as we identified our root causes, and then our theory of action, we have actually asked them to come in and we've explained the process, we've explained where we were landing, and asked them to give us very specific feedback on things that they are seeing as gaps, things that they agree with, things that they disagree with.

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:33.796
And so we're asking that expertise to come into our process so that we can end up with a better product.

02:20:35.798 --> 02:20:42.542
In addition, we have connected with Dr. Christine Olmsted, the Assistant Superintendent of Orange County Office of Ed.

02:20:43.062 --> 02:20:58.030
And as we have started to narrow our focus around our theory of action, it became obvious that the MTSS initiative is one that we want to make sure we're well grounded in, assuming that that will ultimately become part of our actions as we move forward.

02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:59.151
So we're very excited to have her.

02:20:59.171 --> 02:21:02.232
She's actually coming to our geographic area meeting this Friday.

02:21:03.613 --> 02:21:05.734
And then finally, geographic lead agencies.

02:21:06.454 --> 02:21:15.456
From the very beginning, we were excited to connect with our other geographic lead agencies to understand how they were approaching this work and learn from them.

02:21:15.596 --> 02:21:22.238
Again, thank you to CDE and CCE for creating the meetings for us to be able to connect and discuss that.

02:21:23.038 --> 02:21:30.980
In addition to the meetings that the state agencies have put together, as geographic lead agencies, we've also been creating our own meetings.

02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:34.782
And I'm very excited about the progress that we're making there.

02:21:34.802 --> 02:21:41.087
And that if you think about that, our California state is so diverse, right?

02:21:41.327 --> 02:21:45.189
And these geographic areas all represent different sections and different perspectives.

02:21:46.050 --> 02:21:57.678
But we have come together and identified our collective goals and how we are defining our roles as geographic leads and what work we want to do together within the statewide systems support.

02:21:57.958 --> 02:22:02.339
and then what work we're going to do individually to support this system.

02:22:02.379 --> 02:22:14.681
So we have really appreciated the partnerships with our other GEO lead agencies, and they have also been providing feedback to us specifically at every step of our process.

02:22:14.721 --> 02:22:25.423
So again, we want to kind of disrupt our group think, have other people come in, we have to explain our process to them, then they give us the feedback and the questions that we need to refine and improve that.

02:22:29.144 --> 02:22:32.605
And now I would like to ask Jackie Williams to come up.

02:22:32.706 --> 02:22:42.789
She will be explaining to you the work of the SIL, but also how specifically we have partnered around our focus on students with disabilities.

02:22:46.789 --> 02:22:47.949
Good morning, everybody.

02:22:48.129 --> 02:22:53.811
Thank you so much for allowing me to share a little bit about the work that we've been doing.

02:22:54.371 --> 02:23:04.553
So I am Jackie Williams, as Lisa stated, and I'm the assistant superintendent of the West San Gabriel Valley SELPA, located right in that little town of LA County.

02:23:04.973 --> 02:23:13.595
So there's about, I think we have 25 SELPAs in the LA County area, one of which is myself.

02:23:14.904 --> 02:23:18.247
So I wanted to tell you how we grounded our work.

02:23:18.828 --> 02:23:26.935
So when we were thinking about applying for the grant, we really went back to this one system theory.

02:23:27.235 --> 02:23:34.241
So the system improvement leads grounded their work in the 2015 special education task force report.

02:23:34.942 --> 02:23:40.366
And we focused on the belief that all children are considered general education students first.

02:23:41.367 --> 02:23:57.052
And all educators have a collective responsibility to see that all children receive the education and support they need to maximize their development and their potential in one system.

02:23:59.795 --> 02:24:16.865
So, I'd like to introduce you to my colleagues, so myself, and then there's Leah Davis, and she is the executive director of the Riverside County Office of Education SELPA and Tamara Clay, who is with Eldorado County SELPA.

02:24:19.616 --> 02:24:22.818
This is our SELPA System Improvement Lead Theory of Action.

02:24:23.218 --> 02:24:48.835
We believe that if we build partnerships with SELPAs, LEAs, County Offices of Education, System of Support Lead Agencies, CDE, and CCEE, and build capacity of SELPAs and LEAs in the areas of data governance and use, continuous improvement, and accesses to resources to support and implement high leverage practices and evidence-based practices,

02:24:49.756 --> 02:25:07.678
that then students with disabilities will have access to a cohesive and effective school system intentionally designed to provide the necessary supports and interventions for educational and post-secondary success.

02:25:09.525 --> 02:25:15.309
So now I want to tell you about our exciting work with the Kern County GEO Lead Agencies.

02:25:15.669 --> 02:25:21.273
We're incredibly grateful that Kern reached out to us and asked us to be a partner.

02:25:21.693 --> 02:25:31.059
As we are into this work, only about seven, eight, or eight months, knocking on the doors of the geographic areas and saying, hey, let us in, let us in, we want to collaborate.

02:25:31.499 --> 02:25:33.100
Everybody has so much going on.

02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:38.844
And Lisa approached me at a CISC conference that we had done a brief little presentation.

02:25:39.364 --> 02:25:41.245
and ask us to come out and work with them.

02:25:41.905 --> 02:25:56.111
So what's resulted from our collaboration is that we actually took the West San Gabriel Valley SELPA team, the SEAL team out there, four of us, to a current geographic lead area meeting.

02:25:56.131 --> 02:25:59.472
And we presented a three hour workshop for them.

02:26:00.033 --> 02:26:05.075
And we went all the way down into the basics of special education.

02:26:07.594 --> 02:26:15.757
Okay, so the workshop structure, a lot of information here, and I'm going to focus on a couple of areas, primarily the APR report.

02:26:16.397 --> 02:26:22.239
The other things are things that we talked about during our three hours, and what we did.

02:26:22.659 --> 02:26:35.743
So I want to give a definition of the annual performance report, in case anybody in the audience is not familiar with that acronym, because I know in special ed, I could acronym my way through an hour of speech, I tell you.

02:26:37.404 --> 02:26:38.385
It would be very easy.

02:26:38.425 --> 02:26:39.026
There's pages.

02:26:39.086 --> 02:27:01.665
So, the Individuals with Disabilities Act, the IDEA, requires that each state to develop a state performance plan annual performance report that evaluates the state's efforts to implement the requirements and purpose of the IDEA and describes how the state will improve its implementation.

02:27:02.045 --> 02:27:02.846
The APR

02:27:03.386 --> 02:27:09.872
report for each district includes data on 14 indicators and we're going to talk about one of those specifically today.

02:27:10.312 --> 02:27:15.116
The results of these indicators are used to determine corrective actions required by the districts.

02:27:15.957 --> 02:27:21.061
Our work with Kern resulted in a deeper dive into the State Performance Plan Indicator 5.

02:27:22.242 --> 02:27:31.369
And Indicator 5 consists of three different, it has an A, B, and C. We're going to talk today about what we're looking at on Indicator 5.

02:27:33.094 --> 02:27:35.442
And that is least restrictive environment.

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:53.274
So one of the tools that we felt that we needed to show this large group of individuals from the County Offices of Ed at our GEO lead meeting was this wonderful tool that was developed through the SIL grant.

02:27:54.095 --> 02:28:02.841
And it's a resource for school leaders and staff to gain a deeper understanding of the California State Performance Plan, the SPP indicators.

02:28:02.921 --> 02:28:06.904
I'll be referring to those as the SPPIs in future slides.

02:28:07.793 --> 02:28:10.298
Let me show you the work that was done here.

02:28:13.197 --> 02:28:21.583
Eldorado County Office of Ed and their director, Tamara Clay, took the lead on this project for the SIL team.

02:28:22.383 --> 02:28:31.629
And this is a very brief overview of this unbelievable dynamic document that is available on our website.

02:28:32.170 --> 02:28:36.132
And dynamic, I say, because you'll see in here right now, we refer to casemists.

02:28:36.593 --> 02:28:42.797
We don't have casemists any longer where it's all cow pads and casemists has sailed off into the sunset.

02:28:43.558 --> 02:28:54.511
So this particular section, these are handouts that are like grab-and-goes that you can print out to give to individuals who have come to your trainings.

02:28:55.152 --> 02:28:58.416
So this section of the SPPA guide

02:29:01.994 --> 02:29:17.479
It digs down deeper into the components of the 14 indicators, which include the data source, how the data source was calculated, how it was identified, the calculation methodologies, and where did that data come from.

02:29:18.223 --> 02:29:25.567
And when we were working with Curran, we went all the way down to where that data comes from, which is our students' IEPs.

02:29:26.467 --> 02:29:29.769
If you mark this box, then that data is going to go here.

02:29:29.969 --> 02:29:37.093
If this is the least restrictive environment and they're in the environment more than 80% of the time, well, that's one of our indicators.

02:29:37.493 --> 02:29:43.576
So we went down and we reviewed that IEP process with them to show them where this data was coming from.

02:29:45.398 --> 02:29:50.388
What we found very well received is the connections that we make at the bottom.

02:29:50.428 --> 02:29:53.414
If you see indicator 5 making connections.

02:29:53.835 --> 02:29:54.797
So what that does

02:29:55.911 --> 02:30:09.297
is it's going to show how that particular indicator is related to the dashboard, the LCAP priorities, and also the quality assurance process that we do in special education.

02:30:09.837 --> 02:30:17.040
So this resource is available, by the way, on our website, which I'll show you towards the end of the slide, you'll be able to access it.

02:30:18.146 --> 02:30:22.730
So the SIL team is currently in the process of launching our improvement data center.

02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:34.160
And this center, this site will house all of our data tools and resources and will be couched in our SIL landing page on our website.

02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:36.382
So this will be one of the tools accessible.

02:30:36.802 --> 02:30:43.488
So what we're striving for is to help create a culture where data is more easily accessible,

02:30:44.409 --> 02:30:51.776
educators as they plan for their students specifically and ultimately through the West San Gabriel Valley side of the grant.

02:30:52.177 --> 02:31:06.031
We're looking at the development of a data governance toolkit which Riverside SELPA has been working on with us, a guidance to the SPPI indicators, and a common set of data tools.

02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:12.142
Make sure we push the right button.

02:31:12.162 --> 02:31:14.704
That's the most challenging, just making sure I push the right button.

02:31:16.906 --> 02:31:17.246
All right.

02:31:17.306 --> 02:31:22.830
So this is a snapshot of one of the pages in our Improvement Data Center.

02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:26.973
And what you can see here are the six little icons at the bottom.

02:31:27.373 --> 02:31:37.321
So when the user goes to this page, you can see the Data Quality Toolkit, which is being worked on by Riverside, Root Cause Analysis Tools, which is future, the SPP

02:31:38.728 --> 02:31:50.976
I am monitoring, that's what we're working on now, improvement monitoring, and towards the end cycle of our grant, we'll be working on some predictive analysis and other things that we come up with.

02:31:51.416 --> 02:31:52.117
So right now,

02:31:53.237 --> 02:32:01.543
What we are focusing on again is the SPPI indicator for indicator 5 and the least restrictive environment.

02:32:01.944 --> 02:32:05.226
I want to show you an example of what we have been doing.

02:32:05.246 --> 02:32:08.228
This is just showing what I just stated.

02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:18.352
So the state of California has the annual performance report, and I explained what that is earlier in the presentation.

02:32:19.192 --> 02:32:23.373
Has anybody ever searched for an annual performance report on CDE's website?

02:32:24.933 --> 02:32:25.154
Yeah.

02:32:26.634 --> 02:32:26.874
Yes.

02:32:27.194 --> 02:32:27.474
Okay.

02:32:27.974 --> 02:32:30.375
So we have a special present for you today.

02:32:31.855 --> 02:32:32.756
So what we did is

02:32:34.565 --> 02:32:35.746
Oh, this is a promise?

02:32:36.226 --> 02:32:37.547
We've already kept the promise.

02:32:37.707 --> 02:32:38.807
We've already kept the promise.

02:32:38.848 --> 02:32:40.769
So we just haven't made it public yet.

02:32:41.189 --> 02:32:53.936
So through our work with Kern, we learned that, of course, least restrictive environment, the more time our students spend in the general education classroom, the better the outcomes are for those students.

02:32:54.616 --> 02:32:55.297
And we know this.

02:32:55.737 --> 02:32:57.438
So we were focusing on that.

02:32:59.299 --> 02:33:10.493
So what we did with the data that you find on CDE's website is we worked with CDE to get that data in an Excel format.

02:33:11.134 --> 02:33:16.080
So we have a data sharing agreement with myself and what we did is we worked with that and we

02:33:17.984 --> 02:33:24.588
created the entire state's APR reports in searchable PDF format.

02:33:25.509 --> 02:33:45.782
So you no longer have to, and this will be ongoing, we'll get caught up, but right now, this is a searchable tool, you can go in and, here it is, you can select your year, you can select your county office of ed, your LEA, or your LEA,

02:33:46.622 --> 02:33:53.244
or your SELPA, and you can pull up those districts that you want to see their APR reports.

02:33:54.005 --> 02:34:00.047
So it's dynamic, it's ongoing, we're going to be building up and getting more current.

02:34:00.067 --> 02:34:06.429
We have three years on there now, and this will help us monitor that data much more effectively.

02:34:08.430 --> 02:34:10.711
So I skipped an entire thing.

02:34:10.731 --> 02:34:13.532
And right now we have three years of that data on there.

02:34:15.382 --> 02:34:21.107
This is our most exciting work that we're currently very close to rolling out.

02:34:21.708 --> 02:34:24.350
And this one, again, we're looking at indicator five.

02:34:25.311 --> 02:34:29.695
And we beta tested this with the current county geoleads at our workshop.

02:34:30.076 --> 02:34:36.201
We actually ran the reports using this tool and took that to each of the county offices of ed that attended.

02:34:36.582 --> 02:34:39.965
And we sat down and we workshopped around that and asked them to identify

02:34:40.425 --> 02:34:44.187
where they're seeing some challenges and comparing them with each other.

02:34:44.627 --> 02:34:46.008
So it was exciting work.

02:34:46.428 --> 02:34:53.893
So with this report, the users are going to be able to graph their respective indicator data.

02:34:54.453 --> 02:34:56.634
And we've used, again, Indicator 5 for this.

02:34:56.874 --> 02:35:01.217
And this tool is going to be searchable by county offices of ed.

02:35:02.077 --> 02:35:20.213
SELPAs, geo areas, so Kern could search their entire geo area, and LEAs, and it will also allow them to create multi-years graphs, and we'll do it one indicator at a time and roll that out as we develop them.

02:35:20.954 --> 02:35:22.875
So this is our most exciting tool.

02:35:22.895 --> 02:35:29.196
You can see here, we have the total number of students receiving services, our total number in the 80%.

02:35:30.336 --> 02:35:38.159
The percentage, our target, and this particular pretend agency actually met all the targets.

02:35:38.299 --> 02:35:43.180
If a district or SELPA didn't meet their targets, it would have a red X.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:48.564
And so we would be able to graph that and compare to other SELPAs, like SELPAs, like districts.

02:35:49.064 --> 02:35:55.029
And this one, we're just waiting on figuring out how our permission levels are going to work.

02:35:55.509 --> 02:36:04.737
And eventually, when we figure out the logistics and the legal things that we need to figure out, districts will be able to upload their CALPADS data.

02:36:05.357 --> 02:36:12.783
into our system and run data, more current data on their students in their districts.

02:36:13.124 --> 02:36:15.505
So we're looking forward to being able to do that.

02:36:16.847 --> 02:36:26.054
And lastly, this is our absolutely magnificent, beautiful landing page for our website and our web address is on there.

02:36:26.414 --> 02:36:32.239
And I thank you so much for your time and thank you for your dedication to the System Improvement Leads.

02:36:32.759 --> 02:36:34.521
We and our students are grateful.

02:36:34.941 --> 02:36:35.601
Thank you so much.

02:36:38.283 --> 02:36:55.270
Hopefully we have accomplished our first two bullets in terms of outcomes that you understand now a little bit more about the continuous improvement process that we have been utilizing and also how we have engaged with our partners across the statewide system of support.

02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:58.492
Now we are going to move on to share with you our anticipated next steps.

02:36:59.592 --> 02:37:05.197
And we're bringing the process map back up because we've explained to you how we have taken those first four steps.

02:37:05.618 --> 02:37:22.974
And now we're at that final step of identifying our initiatives and really putting pen to paper to identify the actions that we will both collectively as a geographic area take to reach our goals and address that problem of practice, as well as each county office of education individually

02:37:23.374 --> 02:37:33.241
creating plans on how they will contribute to addressing that problem of practice because we definitely want to recognize the local contexts in which we are all working.

02:37:34.642 --> 02:37:46.049
In addition to going through this continuous improvement process with our geographic area, we've also simultaneously been doing some of the work that is called out in statute as geographic areas that we need to do.

02:37:46.510 --> 02:37:48.691
And so I'm going to share with you a little bit about that.

02:37:49.672 --> 02:37:53.114
But I think it was mentioned earlier in the presentation

02:37:53.554 --> 02:38:01.440
that we as a group have really discussed and struggled with how to best share our work around differentiated assistance, right?

02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:07.525
So one of our jobs is to really make sure that we're coming together to coordinate and calibrate that assistance that's being provided to school districts.

02:38:08.065 --> 02:38:10.807
And so we have done, we've employed a number of strategies to do that.

02:38:10.847 --> 02:38:14.610
We've been sharing practices and doing activities around that.

02:38:14.950 --> 02:38:30.292
But the group decided that they really thought a case study format would be really valuable so that we could go a little deeper into our journeys with specific districts and what challenges we faced, what successes we've had, and what we can learn from each of those case studies.

02:38:30.792 --> 02:38:39.777
And so at our last geographic area meeting, three of our county offices presented those case studies, and then on this next Friday, the remaining three will be sharing those case studies.

02:38:40.157 --> 02:38:58.147
Just as a specific example, Sue, specifically to speak to your point about how are we getting this work down to the district and classroom level, we shared our case study last meeting, and we're able to share specifically about our work with our largest school district,

02:38:59.367 --> 02:39:06.630
who realized in going through our process that there was some work to do around coherence.

02:39:07.050 --> 02:39:11.731
They had a large number of school sites that were all kind of doing their own thing.

02:39:12.171 --> 02:39:19.253
And so in coming together in our process, it really helped them to bring that diverse team together to get perspective from across the district.

02:39:19.473 --> 02:39:27.516
And they created an action plan specifically on how they were going to improve all of the interventions that were being provided to their students.

02:39:28.336 --> 02:39:30.498
And so they address social-emotional learning.

02:39:30.838 --> 02:39:33.020
They address their academic interventions.

02:39:33.741 --> 02:39:40.066
They are implementing PBIS and restorative justice types of programs across their district.

02:39:41.267 --> 02:39:45.870
And they have also began the restructure around becoming more inclusive.

02:39:46.691 --> 02:39:54.237
We had staff actually attend a beginning of the year meeting in which they informed all, I believe, 23 of their principals

02:39:55.598 --> 02:40:08.868
about how they were going to be moving into a push-in model for their students with disabilities and how that represented a significant mindset shift as well as resource shifts that were going across the district.

02:40:08.888 --> 02:40:16.874
So we are seeing concrete examples of this process leading to changes occurring that will ultimately benefit our students very specifically.

02:40:19.252 --> 02:40:24.193
So the other piece that we've been trying to work simultaneously on is our asset mapping.

02:40:24.433 --> 02:40:31.714
So one of the pieces of language on statute say that we want to identify resources across our geographic area and identify how we might share those.

02:40:32.134 --> 02:40:38.435
So we have been working with WestEd and identified those assets across our geographic area.

02:40:38.455 --> 02:40:40.916
So each county office has been in the process of doing that.

02:40:41.356 --> 02:40:43.716
And with a lot of discussion around what is an asset, right?

02:40:43.816 --> 02:40:47.817
And then also how might we actually share these assets once we've identified them.

02:40:48.317 --> 02:40:54.521
So we came up with an organization for our asset map, and we're really close to being completed.

02:40:54.842 --> 02:41:03.207
But what we did is we organized the asset map to identify assets for each county office and where they would reside in alignment with the California School Dashboard.

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:11.993
What we would anticipate is a county office or a school district wanting to see specific resources around a specific problem that they're facing.

02:41:12.033 --> 02:41:12.894
So for an example,

02:41:13.414 --> 02:41:34.122
If a district was really wanting to address chronic absenteeism and see what assets and resources exist around that particular issue, in our asset map, they would go to academic engagement, which aligns with the category that the school dashboard uses, and then drill down into chronic absenteeism and be able to see by county office what assets and resources are available to address that specific issue.

02:41:34.742 --> 02:41:42.727
In addition to those three categories that align with the California School Dashboard, academic performance, academic engagement, and conditions and climate, we added two.

02:41:42.787 --> 02:41:48.831
We added governance because we saw that there was a lot of work to be done and being done in our county offices around leadership.

02:41:49.752 --> 02:41:51.313
Also about specific processes.

02:41:52.054 --> 02:42:01.420
And then in addition, we thought it was important to include in our assets, the assets and resources that our SELPAs bring to the table, especially with our problem of practice.

02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:04.542
So we added a community section to address that.

02:42:05.002 --> 02:42:13.710
You'll see we also within our assets recognize the need to work on and encourage parent and family engagement.

02:42:13.950 --> 02:42:20.335
And so you'll see that is an area and we will be identifying assets and resources specific to that under conditions and climate.

02:42:20.355 --> 02:42:21.496
Okay.

02:42:24.369 --> 02:42:29.194
And then the next conversation was about how we would share.

02:42:29.574 --> 02:42:35.039
So once we've identified the assets, how will we determine how we might access them and share them with one another?

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:41.466
So we created four different categories, and each county office is identifying how they might share that asset or resource.

02:42:41.826 --> 02:42:43.247
The first is just share.

02:42:43.548 --> 02:42:47.952
So they've put together documentation so that it's just something we could pick up on a website,

02:42:48.272 --> 02:42:54.996
or a packet of information that we can take and use immediately so that we can employ that asset.

02:42:55.056 --> 02:42:58.257
The next offer is that if they can share it through shadowing.

02:42:58.638 --> 02:43:06.642
So will we be able to invite other COEs to come in and observe the process or the asset and be able to discuss that with them so we can learn from them.

02:43:07.122 --> 02:43:17.490
Also service, there are times when we may not be able to share our shadow, but for a fee for service cost recovery, we might be able to go to another county office and share the resource that way.

02:43:17.931 --> 02:43:30.781
And finally, we're asking as much as possible if they have a trainer of trainers opportunity so that if that asset can be shared through a trainer of trainers program, then we might be able to then try to replicate that work within our own county offices.

02:43:33.649 --> 02:43:54.473
And then finally, as we were preparing for this presentation, which we are very grateful for the opportunity to come and share with all of you, we thought it was really important that you not just hear our voices, because we have approached this work very genuinely and authentically, recognizing that what all of our county offices bring to the table.

02:43:54.893 --> 02:44:02.514
And so we just created a very brief video so that you could hear specifically from the other county offices about our process and what they've gotten out of it.

02:44:04.949 --> 02:44:06.090
See if I can get this going.

02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:07.731
Deep work is happening.

02:44:07.911 --> 02:44:10.252
Schools and districts and counties are engaging in it.

02:44:11.072 --> 02:44:14.514
We're trying to do something as a state that hasn't been attempted before.

02:44:14.674 --> 02:44:17.416
We are operationalizing the California way.

02:44:17.776 --> 02:44:23.059
We're turning it into actual work that happens in schools, classrooms, and school districts.

02:44:23.859 --> 02:44:27.061
And the support of each other make it possible.

02:44:30.908 --> 02:44:35.411
We have this shared experience of learning with a real problem that we want real answers to.

02:44:35.592 --> 02:44:45.999
What has been valuable for us is really just learning what other county offices do, actually getting to know the other people in the other context, our counterparts in the other county offices.

02:44:46.339 --> 02:44:50.583
And so we have an opportunity to learn from each other and build on each other's strengths.

02:44:50.643 --> 02:44:53.685
We have our continuous improvement process, which we ask them to participate in.

02:44:53.945 --> 02:45:04.810
Continuous Improvement, it's created a unifying philosophy for how we will approach complex problems and I don't think that as a county office or as a state we've had that kind of unifying message before.

02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:11.933
Using the tools in it to understand the root causes, really being able to understand at a deep level what the data means.

02:45:12.513 --> 02:45:17.836
You feel grounded in what the work means and what it can do for you as you move forward.

02:45:22.372 --> 02:45:32.299
This year, out of the 35 of our districts that are eligible for differentiated assistance, I believe 23 of them had students with disabilities as one of their qualifying student groups.

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:44.927
And I think it's been clear for years, even prior to the dashboard and prior to the system of support, that we need to do better for our students with disabilities.

02:45:47.059 --> 02:45:53.582
We're finally going to have really transparent, deep conversations about how we are serving our students and what service means.

02:45:53.923 --> 02:45:54.423
Nice.

02:45:54.463 --> 02:46:02.487
The first letter is H. We'll see some really deep systemic changes that will create systems in which our kids can be more successful.

02:46:02.787 --> 02:46:06.049
So we really strive to be collaborative thinking partners.

02:46:06.109 --> 02:46:06.970
That is our goal.

02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:13.193
What I would hope to see five years down the road for this collaborative is that we have a very streamlined

02:46:13.594 --> 02:46:19.176
network and system of sharing resources and support so that we're a model of how not to do this alone.

02:46:19.693 --> 02:46:22.555
Our GEO lead group is not one fixed group of people.

02:46:22.655 --> 02:46:32.724
We're iterative, just like the work that we do, and I think that that's an important consideration that people who enter in bring in their expertise and also benefit from the expertise of the group.

02:46:33.024 --> 02:46:43.593
So that in five years from now, it's a seamless process of networking, sharing resources, learning, so that no matter who enters the county office, the school district, you're plugged into a system of support.

02:46:50.991 --> 02:47:01.442
So to close this presentation, you have a graphic before you that shows adults in the system, children in the classroom with the teacher, and ultimately children succeeding.

02:47:01.482 --> 02:47:05.886
And the graphic is because we realize this work is really all about the students.

02:47:06.747 --> 02:47:16.052
And we know that ultimately it's about providing the opportunities for the teachers to create that magic and that relationship with the students in their classrooms.

02:47:16.692 --> 02:47:18.733
So we are all in, we are committed to this.

02:47:18.793 --> 02:47:22.675
We're talking about disrupting the predictability of student outcomes.

02:47:22.895 --> 02:47:30.439
We genuinely believe that factors that are outside of students' controls, whether it is income or the zip code in which they reside,

02:47:30.919 --> 02:47:34.061
their ethnicity, gender, language, or their learning ability.

02:47:34.521 --> 02:47:37.002
It should never predict a student's outcome.

02:47:37.603 --> 02:47:40.284
And to do this work, we must work through adults.

02:47:40.504 --> 02:47:46.047
We need to work through changing mindsets and behaviors to ultimately see changes in the classroom.

02:47:46.488 --> 02:47:47.868
It's about scalability.

02:47:48.349 --> 02:47:59.155
So as GEO leads, we are creating coherent systems of support across our county partners to strengthen our own practice, to better then support school district leaders,

02:47:59.775 --> 02:48:20.845
who in turn will support the school leaders that they lead, then they will be able to equip the teachers in the classroom with the best practices to improve student teaching and learning, instruction and learning, so that ultimately we will be able to see improved student outcomes.

02:48:21.525 --> 02:48:28.429
Now we're scaling this across 2.1 million students, 3200 schools.

02:48:28.890 --> 02:48:30.271
It's going to take time.

02:48:30.651 --> 02:48:32.232
We appreciate your patience.

02:48:32.732 --> 02:48:33.833
I am not patient.

02:48:34.513 --> 02:48:35.714
I want to see numbers.

02:48:35.874 --> 02:48:37.075
I want to see action.

02:48:37.095 --> 02:48:38.376
I want to see results.

02:48:39.156 --> 02:48:42.237
And I'm not alone, I don't think any of us are alone in that.

02:48:42.657 --> 02:48:54.679
But we are asking for your continued support, we're asking for your guidance, and we're asking for your support of continuing in this effort, because we do believe it's the right work.

02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:58.560
Thank you for your time today, and we're available for any questions you may have.

02:48:58.580 --> 02:49:01.441
Dr. Brother and your team, thank you so much for really helping

02:49:01.781 --> 02:49:09.447
We're going to stop for a 2nd here board members because we want to kind of ask you some questions and give us a chance before we go to document a solid in the next step.

02:49:09.927 --> 02:49:23.978
So, just helping us understand how the geo leads and all the everything in the, in the graphs that you've been sharing and how complicated is just to reinforce your support for building capacity and articulating across.

02:49:25.019 --> 02:49:34.189
all the different players to build that, and we realize how complex, how big our state is, but even in your geographic area and the counties you have.

02:49:34.570 --> 02:49:44.902
So I have a question that builds on Member Burr, and I'll ask her to follow since we're the liaisons for accountability, and we'll ask each board member if you have one question to clarify before we move on.

02:49:45.542 --> 02:49:52.510
But you talked about building coherent support, which we know there's a lot of stuff going on out there, and it hits districts and principals.

02:49:52.970 --> 02:49:58.255
And I appreciate Rob talking about what you're, you've tried to look at what level one is for everyone.

02:49:58.275 --> 02:50:01.018
What are the supports for every, what does everybody get?

02:50:01.439 --> 02:50:03.000
What do you do for tier level two?

02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:05.183
And what are we doing for targeted for three?

02:50:05.683 --> 02:50:17.128
And so I'm interested in sort of how that impacts a district that's probably got capacities, probably got a teacher shortage, there may be some literacy issues in mathematics because they got identified for support.

02:50:17.268 --> 02:50:21.970
Besides just students with disabilities, as Kristen was saying, they're overlapping the group.

02:50:22.130 --> 02:50:24.391
How do you build a coherent focus?

02:50:24.411 --> 02:50:29.593
Do you serve as a broker for the LEAs to help them guide what research?

02:50:29.613 --> 02:50:30.833
There's so much stuff out there.

02:50:30.873 --> 02:50:32.354
How do they get a focus?

02:50:32.934 --> 02:50:34.294
to actually make some growth.

02:50:34.574 --> 02:50:42.296
So I'm interested in sort of that tiered support and how it directly impacts the LEA based on all these different opportunities there.

02:50:42.476 --> 02:50:46.517
So I don't know if that's, Mary, if you're the right one to, or Rob, to share that, but that would be helpful.

02:50:46.537 --> 02:50:51.038
I'll be inviting both Rob and Lisa up here with me, but I'm gonna start with sharing this.

02:50:51.378 --> 02:50:58.940
As the County Office of Education, our goal and all of our partner goals within the GEO area is to be a broker.

02:50:59.640 --> 02:51:03.804
and to understand that we are not experts in every single area.

02:51:04.224 --> 02:51:13.872
And so when meeting with the LEA that is eligible, one of the first things we do is a deep dive into what they've identified as their areas of expertise.

02:51:15.053 --> 02:51:19.596
problems of practice, but also looking at data, because sometimes we have blind spots, right?

02:51:20.197 --> 02:51:30.043
And so by going through that exercise and that review, we're better able to identify resources that they then need to be connected to.

02:51:30.543 --> 02:51:42.011
We as GeoLEADS, through our asset mapping, will be also able to work through other COEs to identify those resources that may not reside in Kern, they may be in LA.

02:51:42.631 --> 02:51:43.872
They may be in Fresno.

02:51:44.092 --> 02:51:46.334
They may be outside of our GEO area.

02:51:46.774 --> 02:51:55.780
And we will be brokers, if you will, or connectors to bring those resources to any LEA in the GEO area working through our partner COEs.

02:51:57.161 --> 02:51:58.182
Anything to add to that?

02:51:59.372 --> 02:52:00.513
Okay, well, thank you for that.

02:52:00.533 --> 02:52:10.740
I'm going to go to Member Burr, who's also, we both, liaison to accountability and system of support, and then we'll let each board member ask a clarifying question before we move on to the second part of the, the next part of the presentation.

02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:10.840
Sure.

02:52:11.461 --> 02:52:13.522
So, I'd just like to express my appreciation, too.

02:52:13.582 --> 02:52:20.067
I really, I know how hard you're working, and we heard from you early on before we got to this point, so appreciate all the work Kern is doing.

02:52:20.907 --> 02:52:26.891
And I really appreciate your example, Lisa, because I think it's just hard to make this real for people.

02:52:27.091 --> 02:52:32.595
And we get lots of feedback from our stakeholder folks going, what is this?

02:52:32.895 --> 02:52:34.696
How are we helping people?

02:52:35.076 --> 02:52:39.699
And I know it's taken a long time to sort of build up your structure so that you are able to help them.

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:43.662
But I do, I just sort of want to reinforce what I said, that I think going forward,

02:52:44.582 --> 02:52:53.370
it would be helpful to approach it from the LEA lens, to say, just as you did, this LEA had an issue with coherence, that's what we worked on them with.

02:52:53.910 --> 02:53:05.800
And to the extent with asset mapping, if I, again, wake up and I'm in Guadalupe District in Santa Barbara County, and I say, wow, I really need help with my English learners, who's out there to help me with them?

02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:12.285
How does that get to that level, and how do they access that?

02:53:12.765 --> 02:53:20.970
And I'll just, you know, I'll sort of address the elephant in the room a little bit, because we get this question as well all the time of, what if I don't want to work with my county office?

02:53:21.770 --> 02:53:27.914
Are you in your asset mapping also saying, well, there are private providers, or there's WestEd, or there's whatever?

02:53:29.174 --> 02:53:30.455
How inclusive is that?

02:53:30.515 --> 02:53:36.859
I think it's helpful to know that as well, because I think that those are questions that continue to come up.

02:53:36.999 --> 02:53:38.620
So I'll just leave it at that.

02:53:42.654 --> 02:53:45.936
are at the final stages of putting the asset map together.

02:53:45.956 --> 02:53:56.501
And I think to your question specifically, we have not yet included those other external type agencies.

02:53:56.821 --> 02:53:59.283
However, when we created that community

02:54:00.343 --> 02:54:12.496
Category, our thought was if there were other resources that were available and would specifically align with assisting districts or COEs around one of those indicators that we might include them in that section.

02:54:13.416 --> 02:54:28.586
And the goal ultimately is that any LEA within our geo area would be able to look at that map, understand the resources and the assets that are available to them and reach out, preferably first through their county office of education where they have the relationship.

02:54:28.626 --> 02:54:30.408
But as you know, as in statute.

02:54:31.028 --> 02:54:34.450
eventually working with the GEO lead if necessary.

02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:42.074
And our particular idea behind this, along with our colleagues, is that we're working alongside our other county office partners.

02:54:42.614 --> 02:54:57.261
And so together we will build that bridge and we will create, you know, any type of trusting relationship that might not yet exist for whatever reason and ultimately improve that outcome so that they're more tightly working together.

02:55:02.673 --> 02:55:08.158
Thank you for your presentation, and Dr. Barlow, I also suffer from being a little impatient with things.

02:55:09.019 --> 02:55:20.289
And so as I was looking at this, and I understand the monumental task ahead, and I was looking at this diagram here, and the role of the GEO leads, and I thought,

02:55:20.949 --> 02:55:22.991
How do you know that what you're doing is working?

02:55:23.692 --> 02:55:28.496
What are the metrics that you have, and are these metrics aligned to the system of support?

02:55:28.856 --> 02:55:33.781
Because as policymakers, we often look to the system of support and we're like, well, it's going to be taken care of there.

02:55:34.481 --> 02:55:42.188
And so if you're worried about your English learners, well, the system of support is there, and we have tiered levels of support.

02:55:42.688 --> 02:55:43.769
But I do wonder,

02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:48.892
We are asking to completely transform the system that we have.

02:55:49.192 --> 02:55:55.334
It would be great to have a sense of a realistic timeline informed by the jail leads and other partners.

02:55:56.214 --> 02:56:04.017
Is it two years that we need just to build a system to teach people how to work beyond the silos, how to collaborate and how to communicate?

02:56:04.457 --> 02:56:05.718
Is that what we are looking at?

02:56:05.978 --> 02:56:08.359
After two years, we should be able to see A, B, and C.

02:56:09.159 --> 02:56:10.720
how often are we seeing outcomes?

02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:21.766
So I think just collaborating is a great outcome, but this system was built to address academic, community engagement, specific student populations.

02:56:22.246 --> 02:56:30.271
And so for me, I would like to know what are the metrics that you're using when you're looking at the work you're doing, and are those aligned to the system of support?

02:56:30.311 --> 02:56:32.312
So how are we evaluating this entire system?

02:56:33.052 --> 02:56:34.693
And are those the same across the state?

02:56:35.193 --> 02:56:37.435
And what is the sense of timeline that we're looking at?

02:56:37.575 --> 02:56:45.960
Because one is building the system, transforming practices, shifting mindsets, but the other is actually how do we get to the outcomes?

02:56:46.801 --> 02:56:52.504
A lot of community and a lot of the letters we received, they want to know what is the role of community and stakeholders?

02:56:52.544 --> 02:56:54.225
Why are we not part of this system?

02:56:55.346 --> 02:56:58.668
And so if you could address how that is being addressed through your GEO lead,

02:56:59.028 --> 02:57:01.209
But again, I think this question is global.

02:57:01.449 --> 02:57:03.491
How are we evaluating our system of support?

02:57:04.291 --> 02:57:14.917
I'm gonna start with giving a broad piece on evaluation and Ronnie will be speaking on it because specifically that is the role CCE has taken on for us.

02:57:15.578 --> 02:57:26.144
But what I wanna say is first, it starts with evaluating changes in practice and being able to look directly at that and then moving towards seeing actual outcomes for students.

02:57:26.264 --> 02:57:27.665
And we're already measuring that.

02:57:28.385 --> 02:57:28.866
Let's start.

02:57:29.066 --> 02:57:29.306
Great.

02:57:29.406 --> 02:57:38.034
So, CCEE has brought together resources so that we have actually hired an external evaluator to evaluate many components of the system.

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:47.843
So, specifically, CCEE in statute is tasked with supporting the system of support, the GEO leads, the SELPA leads, and the community engagement leads.

02:57:48.303 --> 02:57:56.009
And so we actually will have an individual evaluation plan for the GeoLEADS, the SELPA LEADS, and the Community Engagement Initiative.

02:57:56.390 --> 02:57:59.732
And then there will be an overall evaluation plan for the system of support.

02:58:00.613 --> 02:58:06.337
Our vision is that this will be a five-year evaluation, but each year there will be data and a report.

02:58:06.718 --> 02:58:14.484
In the first several years, that data will be much more formative so that it will inform the system about the changes that need to be made to make it more effective.

02:58:14.864 --> 02:58:18.606
And then at the end of that five years, there will be a summative report.

02:58:18.626 --> 02:58:19.566
So that's where we're going.

02:58:19.606 --> 02:58:21.227
We've just engaged with the evaluator.

02:58:21.547 --> 02:58:41.296
The evaluator has been attending meetings, getting to know each of the participants, doing interviews about what their work is in order to identify those common components, because each element of the system was a separate grantee, and so we're having to pull together each of their action plans in order to identify those common metrics.

02:58:42.176 --> 02:58:43.677
So that's coming down the pipeline.

02:58:44.278 --> 02:58:44.578
Thank you.

02:58:44.798 --> 02:58:45.759
Member Rucker, you're next.

02:58:48.620 --> 02:58:53.103
Well, first of all, I do want to thank you all for this presentation.

02:58:53.663 --> 02:59:07.751
And like you, I have a great deal of impatience, even though the three legs on the stool that's supposed to define our system of support is patience, persistence and what's the third?

02:59:07.931 --> 02:59:08.612
Humility.

02:59:08.872 --> 02:59:09.312
So here

02:59:13.067 --> 02:59:18.852
And in knowing that I only get one question, even though I have a whole lot.

02:59:20.574 --> 02:59:22.236
Yeah, okay, there'll be another round.

02:59:23.015 --> 02:59:38.999
Okay, okay, so I Like my like board member Lee cone I saw the diagram that I'm familiar with that tries to define the system of support in places leas at the center as I was listening to you speak.

02:59:39.079 --> 02:59:50.302
I was trying to understand how all of these graphs fit into that diagram and at the same time I'm sensitive to what stakeholders are saying about

02:59:50.982 --> 02:59:54.605
you know, we're not involved in any of these conversations.

02:59:55.126 --> 03:00:01.652
So I'm going to tell you what I heard from your presentation and then I'll ask my question.

03:00:03.033 --> 03:00:15.685
What I appreciated most about what I heard in your presentation was the amount of time and the deep thought you put into how to organize yourselves to do this work.

03:00:16.881 --> 03:00:29.650
And I heard how the time you took and the thoughtfulness that you took has borne fruit for the people responsible for managing this process.

03:00:29.970 --> 03:00:35.774
And you have created some tangible tools to help you do this work.

03:00:36.795 --> 03:00:37.976
So here's the thing.

03:00:39.278 --> 03:00:50.513
This is the LCAP and the accountability system that the LCAP is supposed to be helping LEAs to guide and plan what has been in place since 2013.

03:00:51.074 --> 03:00:55.880
And the need that districts have had

03:00:56.983 --> 03:01:10.650
to have some support and a relationship with their county offices to provide that system of support, I'm going to assert has also been a need and has been in place since 2013.

03:01:13.072 --> 03:01:14.412
So here's my question.

03:01:15.893 --> 03:01:25.278
I think it's fantastic that you all have done all these things to help you understand how to do your work.

03:01:27.011 --> 03:01:32.894
For the LEAs that were left out of your asset map at being at the center of this.

03:01:33.555 --> 03:01:39.278
For the teachers who are not even identified as stakeholders in the work that you've been doing.

03:01:39.698 --> 03:01:45.781
For the parents and community that are also not included as stakeholders in the work that you're doing.

03:01:46.181 --> 03:01:50.664
For the students who came here this morning and demanded to have a voice.

03:01:51.264 --> 03:01:57.513
and participate in the work that you're doing, how did this improve anything for them right now?

03:01:58.954 --> 03:02:00.657
That is a very fair question.

03:02:00.717 --> 03:02:01.838
I want to share with you.

03:02:01.858 --> 03:02:02.079
Okay.

03:02:02.379 --> 03:02:06.605
I don't want to hear it's a fair question because usually when people start with that, it means they don't have an answer.

03:02:09.076 --> 03:02:18.661
But let me share with you that we do work with all of those student groups, parent groups, and community members through our continuous improvement process.

03:02:19.201 --> 03:02:24.944
When Dr. Arias talked about who we bring to the table, we intentionally bring parents.

03:02:25.525 --> 03:02:35.210
We intentionally ask the district to go back and work directly with their school community, including more parents and students,

03:02:35.790 --> 03:02:44.677
and teachers to ensure that we have a really diverse stakeholder voice when developing a plan with the school district.

03:02:45.617 --> 03:02:51.041
That information has been shared with all of our other geo area counties.

03:02:51.501 --> 03:02:59.427
So they're familiar with this process and they are also engaging in more of an authentic stakeholder process.

03:03:00.067 --> 03:03:04.411
The second thing we're doing is we're ensuring that we're getting out to our LEAs

03:03:05.271 --> 03:03:09.794
and giving them training on that authentic engagement and what it looks like.

03:03:10.354 --> 03:03:27.105
So from our office, we're taking different approaches, getting along, getting involved with other county offices as well as our advocacy groups to reach traditional populations that we might not be able to bring to the table and do it in different ways.

03:03:27.746 --> 03:03:31.188
And so we are doing that type of work to impact

03:03:31.748 --> 03:03:42.195
the access to make sure that they feel welcome, that they understand that we do want to hear their voice and that it has impacted the LCAP.

03:03:43.275 --> 03:03:46.517
I can give you a direct example of one thing that happened last year.

03:03:47.458 --> 03:03:58.305
After the LCAP was created, a community group came forward in one of our largest school districts in our county and said we are very unhappy with this particular LCAP because it changed something.

03:03:59.185 --> 03:04:03.970
It's already been approved, but it changed something that we believe should be promised and should be continued.

03:04:04.671 --> 03:04:19.006
That advocacy group met with the superintendent, met with his cabinet, met with the board, and we facilitated discussions so that they could better understand, both sides, what the concerns were.

03:04:19.847 --> 03:04:22.610
At the end of that, there was a compromise that was reached.

03:04:23.031 --> 03:04:25.654
So we were helping to broker that conversation.

03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:27.757
And so that's part of our work.

03:04:27.817 --> 03:04:36.107
It's not easy, but that's part of our work to ensure that all voices are heard as we conduct this effort.

03:04:36.707 --> 03:04:40.029
Now, I will say that has it changed outcomes for students?

03:04:40.469 --> 03:04:41.449
We're kind of excited.

03:04:41.670 --> 03:04:45.211
We're seeing that we're actually outpacing the state of California in growth.

03:04:45.932 --> 03:04:47.553
Let me tell you, we have a long way to go.

03:04:47.673 --> 03:04:49.193
We have an enormous gap in Kern.

03:04:49.554 --> 03:04:50.674
I am acknowledging that.

03:04:51.134 --> 03:04:56.577
But we are outpacing the state of California, and I'm speaking specifically as Kern, not as a GEO lead right now.

03:04:57.157 --> 03:05:01.800
But I'm telling you that I believe this work is showing promise.

03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:06.062
And it's making outcomes, or it's creating outcomes for students.

03:05:06.542 --> 03:05:07.343
in Kern County.

03:05:07.824 --> 03:05:10.627
Thank you very much for that explanation.

03:05:11.007 --> 03:05:26.726
Let me say in all the slides that you use to develop the depth of this explanation about what you all were doing, none of that's apparent in this presentation and you need to make that more apparent because if it's not visible in what you're presenting, for me it doesn't exist.

03:05:26.986 --> 03:05:27.306
Thank you.

03:05:27.747 --> 03:05:28.127
Thank you.

03:05:28.147 --> 03:05:36.536
So we're just going around once and then we're gonna, we'll let the Eldorado county come forward, but just because it's a long presentation, we want to give everyone a chance to clarify.

03:05:36.596 --> 03:05:37.877
So I'm going to start on this.

03:05:37.957 --> 03:05:42.602
It's okay, but I just want to make sure if there's a question or clarifying comment that you want to make.

03:05:44.802 --> 03:05:57.166
Not a clarifying comment, just a question about professional learning and how all this work will help teachers and students in the classroom which is really the heart of her question in my opinion, what I heard of it.

03:05:58.186 --> 03:06:02.908
So I did hear some elaboration on that and I don't know if in the next presentation there will be more attention paid.

03:06:04.109 --> 03:06:10.498
But I was looking on the website and there are a lot of wonderful resources but I did see professional learning kind of buried and I had to search.

03:06:11.380 --> 03:06:18.229
And to me that's so important about how that's going to change teaching and learning in our schools.

03:06:21.576 --> 03:06:27.118
When you mentioned you looked at our website, are you talking about our geographic area website?

03:06:28.578 --> 03:06:30.178
Okay.

03:06:30.599 --> 03:06:37.180
So professional learning is absolutely in our mind that's the build capacity piece of our responsibility.

03:06:38.140 --> 03:06:43.682
And so currently we've been providing professional learning as Jackie mentioned to our within our geographic area.

03:06:44.443 --> 03:06:54.596
But we anticipate having specific actions in our action plan on how we will expand that to the district and teacher level.

03:06:54.936 --> 03:06:58.741
So we are first having to make sure that we have

03:07:00.163 --> 03:07:09.685
We've all created a foundation of knowledge within our planning group, if you will, and then we will start identifying the specific actions that we will take.

03:07:10.045 --> 03:07:24.529
I am certain there will be a large professional learning emphasis on that, but we just haven't put the pen to paper on exactly our actions yet because we're trying to agree on what we will collectively do as well as what each individual COE will do.

03:07:25.046 --> 03:07:39.856
But as an example for one COE, we looked at all of our outcomes and disaggregated data across the entire county and identified areas that we saw commonalities and all of our professional learning was reorganized around those priority areas.

03:07:40.316 --> 03:07:43.358
So this year, our calendar is much more robust and intentional.

03:07:44.679 --> 03:07:51.904
And if I may, when you mentioned the system leads website and our professional learning, we have offered

03:07:53.499 --> 03:08:00.764
Many, many professional learning opportunities throughout the state are including students with disabilities in the accountability system.

03:08:01.124 --> 03:08:06.468
We registered over 700 people for that and we continue to present that.

03:08:06.928 --> 03:08:10.771
We've also done UDL learnings that are at capacity.

03:08:11.071 --> 03:08:14.653
So I'm not sure why it wasn't available today.

03:08:15.033 --> 03:08:16.354
We just launched it last week.

03:08:16.715 --> 03:08:23.259
But those resources are on our website and eventually we'll host all of the professional learning opportunities

03:08:23.619 --> 03:08:25.240
for our content leads also.

03:08:25.620 --> 03:08:27.140
So we have done that.

03:08:27.200 --> 03:08:31.642
We have Dr. Anthony Mohammed coming out with over 100 people attending that.

03:08:32.542 --> 03:08:36.764
And again, so we've done a lot of work around that in the first seven, eight months.

03:08:37.244 --> 03:08:39.585
And I apologize that you weren't able to find that.

03:08:40.325 --> 03:08:40.645
Oh, did you?

03:08:42.515 --> 03:08:42.935
A buried?

03:08:43.056 --> 03:08:50.082
Well, that's great feedback, because I absolutely, we want to know that, because our goal, of course, is to make everything easily accessible.

03:08:50.362 --> 03:08:51.383
Thank you for that feedback.

03:08:51.743 --> 03:08:53.144
So again, we're going to move around quickly.

03:08:53.204 --> 03:08:57.068
If you don't have a question, that's fine, or clarifying, because we do it the rest of the presentation.

03:08:57.168 --> 03:08:57.368
Brenna?

03:08:59.189 --> 03:09:00.650
Hello, is it working?

03:09:01.130 --> 03:09:09.776
Okay, so I just, I want a little bit of clarification on the way that these geographic leads share best practices.

03:09:09.816 --> 03:09:13.018
And I was a little bit worried about the stakeholder aspect of it.

03:09:13.979 --> 03:09:21.284
And so say even if your geographic lead does do that and is involved in stakeholders, what about the other ones?

03:09:22.845 --> 03:09:28.208
If you're the prime example of a geographic lead that's already doing what should be done, what about those who aren't?

03:09:29.569 --> 03:09:51.443
I really noticed this looking at some of the other geographic leads, and I can never tell if it's because I'm a student, or if it's really not saying anything, but when looking at it, sometimes it says, you have the classic sentence of looking into, moving forward, and addressing certain capacity, and can I not understand it, or is it actually not saying anything?

03:09:51.863 --> 03:09:54.204
So, I just kind of wonder,

03:09:55.425 --> 03:10:06.412
Is there a way to really amplify sharing best practices or just making sure that these geographic leads are actually being used for the best way possible?

03:10:06.472 --> 03:10:15.237
And then having, like you said, a way for students and for communities to actually see that the work is doing something.

03:10:15.277 --> 03:10:21.421
Because when we read sentences like that, it's not really promising for community members.

03:10:22.944 --> 03:10:24.165
Thank you for your feedback.

03:10:24.305 --> 03:10:36.090
I think that really making it concrete is important and actually showing outcome data and showing the services and supports that are connected to better improve outcomes for students.

03:10:36.270 --> 03:10:41.812
I think LEAs definitely are benefiting from this, but it's early in its infancy.

03:10:42.032 --> 03:10:44.614
Are all GEO leads doing exactly the same work?

03:10:44.654 --> 03:10:47.675
They all have different focus areas, but collectively,

03:10:48.195 --> 03:10:56.641
We are coming together, working with the CCEE and the CDE as partners to learn from one another and, again, share those resources.

03:10:57.242 --> 03:11:08.250
Sometimes I, too, get a little bit impatient with the edu-speak or when I talk about the philosophizing kind of sound of things, and I just want to be direct.

03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:21.398
Just tell me what you're going to do and tell me how it's going to make a difference for children So I completely understand and we'll take that back in and consider that as we provide our next Presentation and any training and website access.

03:11:21.918 --> 03:11:22.319
Thank you.

03:11:22.479 --> 03:11:34.346
So continuing to move around remember Thank you for the presentation and I also just want to lift up that it's it's an incredibly ambitious Undertaking it's a third of the state.

03:11:34.366 --> 03:11:35.087
I mean, it's more

03:11:35.707 --> 03:11:41.974
which is both very exciting but also daunting to make a dent in terms of child outcomes.

03:11:43.095 --> 03:11:51.945
The question I wanted to ask was actually about how you're approaching root cause analysis and whether you're incorporating a look at early identification and interventions.

03:11:52.986 --> 03:11:56.009
Yes, we are, and I'm going to invite Dr. Arias up here.

03:11:57.364 --> 03:11:59.425
Actually, we explore all root causes.

03:11:59.445 --> 03:12:03.827
So we have actually looked at that particular piece and what impact that might be playing.

03:12:05.368 --> 03:12:09.389
You saw in our theory of action that we had multiple if statements that we've identified.

03:12:09.610 --> 03:12:17.133
And some of those if statements have been used, actually, combined root causes that have been identified into one particular if statement.

03:12:17.153 --> 03:12:23.415
And that particular area that you discussed is part of a specific theory of action that we already took into account in the if statement.

03:12:23.435 --> 03:12:24.276
So the answer is yes.

03:12:25.316 --> 03:12:32.380
We've taken that into account and we've identified root causes connected to your comment within our process.

03:12:35.642 --> 03:12:38.624
Say a little bit more about how you all are approaching that.

03:12:39.665 --> 03:12:43.907
Well, what you asked was whether or not early identification.

03:12:44.232 --> 03:12:56.556
early identification was taken into account and what we do is we study basically what are our processes around early identification and whether or not there is actual root cause related to our problem of practice.

03:12:57.156 --> 03:12:58.557
Are we identifying early enough?

03:12:58.737 --> 03:13:00.557
Have we done a good enough job identifying that?

03:13:00.957 --> 03:13:05.399
Those are the kind of conversations that took place as we developed our theory of action.

03:13:05.479 --> 03:13:08.320
So those conversations have taken place and we've looked

03:13:08.940 --> 03:13:13.523
again, in the mirror versus out the window to identify where we failed in this work.

03:13:13.843 --> 03:13:16.104
So yes, we have taken that into account.

03:13:16.264 --> 03:13:18.946
We have to bring in outside partners who are doing that work as well.

03:13:19.006 --> 03:13:21.347
It's not just, you know, the school district as you know.

03:13:21.387 --> 03:13:24.789
There's so many other agencies that are engaged with early identification.

03:13:24.849 --> 03:13:37.837
One of the things we're kind of curious about is to what extent is the early prenatal care and birth information able to inform us and how can we better connect

03:13:38.438 --> 03:13:42.074
that to then early intervention and support for students.

03:13:46.124 --> 03:13:51.147
I just have a very quick suggestion that I hope is going to be constructive.

03:13:51.707 --> 03:14:11.137
So given the questions around audience of understanding what the system is and the complexity of the work, I would suggest that instead of a web, that the graphic that had a web, it be an infographic from the perspective of how an LEA would approach, you know, the multilayers of support, et cetera.

03:14:13.100 --> 03:14:13.500
Thank you.

03:14:14.841 --> 03:14:17.262
Okay, just again, we're, we're growing this.

03:14:17.342 --> 03:14:18.783
We know you're working so hard on it.

03:14:19.204 --> 03:14:21.625
We know that Eldorado has another presentation.

03:14:22.726 --> 03:14:25.107
We'll do some clarifying and then we'll have some public comment on it.

03:14:25.147 --> 03:14:26.128
So, thank you.

03:14:26.208 --> 03:14:28.869
Kern county and the whole team and.

03:14:30.450 --> 03:14:31.210
Yes, thank you.

03:14:31.230 --> 03:14:47.419
And we're going to further this conversation by hearing from Eldorado County Office of Education, who is not a geographic lead, but they are part of a geographic region and they have identified how they want to ensure that they're effective partners, not only within the system, but with their districts that they serve.

03:14:47.739 --> 03:15:06.355
And so you're going to hear from our superintendent of El Dorado County Office of Education, Dr. Ed Manansala, and he had the foresight to bring with him the superintendent, Dr. Marcy Guthrie, from Mother Lode Union Elementary District, so they can share with you the impact of the county office directly to the district.

03:15:10.058 --> 03:15:10.938
Oh, slides, sorry.

03:15:11.799 --> 03:15:12.740
I'll get you to your slides.

03:15:14.041 --> 03:15:14.361
There we go.

03:15:16.837 --> 03:15:18.548
Good afternoon, members of the board.

03:15:19.377 --> 03:15:21.038
It's always a privilege to be here with you.

03:15:21.358 --> 03:15:23.280
So my name, again, is Ed Manansal.

03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:25.842
I'm the county superintendent of schools in El Dorado County.

03:15:25.862 --> 03:15:38.831
It's my privilege to introduce to you Dr. Marcy Guthrie, who's the superintendent of Mother Lode Union School District, who recently was highlighted in the Learning Policy Institute's Positive Outliers report.

03:15:39.251 --> 03:15:48.878
And so looking forward to her sharing the work that Mother Lode has been doing in the context of El Dorado County into the broader context of

03:15:49.358 --> 03:15:50.919
the work that's occurring statewide.

03:15:51.600 --> 03:16:05.952
So in the context of the system of support, we'd like to overview the significant shifts that have been occurring throughout county offices in respect to our role, our organization, and practice, and specifically the manner in which we've been supporting districts.

03:16:06.813 --> 03:16:09.375
And once again, in particular, looking at

03:16:10.289 --> 03:16:12.870
in the context of a county and a local school district.

03:16:13.010 --> 03:16:17.252
In many ways, just try to demystify this work that we're explaining to you.

03:16:18.433 --> 03:16:21.814
So since the inception, let me shift here.

03:16:23.925 --> 03:16:47.236
So since the inception of LCFF in 2013, and this was being referenced in previous comments, we embraced that the new accountability system, so I'm just stepping back for a moment, is one that is more than a single number, where equity is at the heart of this work, and three, it's a focus on local control.

03:16:47.896 --> 03:16:52.841
specifically the challenge in terms of meaningful and authentic stakeholder engagement.

03:16:52.861 --> 03:16:54.683
We are fully aware of that.

03:16:55.304 --> 03:17:04.052
A key link to the success of these reforms is the effective implementation of the system of support.

03:17:04.713 --> 03:17:08.997
I would like to highlight within the context of a continuous improvement strategy.

03:17:09.898 --> 03:17:18.445
So supporting the continuous improvement of districts has required COEs to reframe our focus, culture, and structures.

03:17:18.785 --> 03:17:25.310
And so let me now start to just share the story of what it looks like at a local level from the perspective of a county.

03:17:26.431 --> 03:17:39.641
So in spring 2019, so not too many months ago, the 14 superintendents of El Dorado County, representing the 15 school districts in the county, we were on a retreat.

03:17:40.359 --> 03:17:48.344
And we were at a retreat in Lake Tahoe reflecting back on the changes that have occurred since 2013, where we are now, and where we are going.

03:17:48.364 --> 03:17:59.430
I want to give you a sense of what that sounds like from just the voice of one of our superintendents in this idea of looking back, again, at the state level, county level, and local level.

03:18:00.947 --> 03:18:19.116
So this is a very respected superintendent coming out of Lake Tahoe, Dr. Jim Tarwater, and he said, I've been leading for over 30 years in education, and while I believe in the overall direction of these changes, I've had a great struggle in putting all of these pieces together.

03:18:21.157 --> 03:18:28.901
And so, Tahoe is one of the most beautiful areas of our state, but when you look at the issues around the achievement gap,

03:18:29.787 --> 03:18:36.949
When you look at the issues around providing meaningful and authentic teacher support, there's challenges occurring there.

03:18:36.989 --> 03:18:41.050
But let me share with you why he's sharing what he's stating there.

03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:47.232
He's still making adjustments around really utilizing the LCAP.

03:18:47.912 --> 03:18:48.332
That's one.

03:18:49.795 --> 03:18:58.658
This past year, so in 17-18, the year that he's referencing, the district became qualified for differentiated assistance.

03:18:59.218 --> 03:19:08.341
So continuing to refine the LCAP, making adjustments around, or learning to go through the process of differentiated assistance.

03:19:09.561 --> 03:19:14.703
This district was also identified for a special education performance indicator review, the PIR.

03:19:17.478 --> 03:19:19.222
Then again, just continue to layer this.

03:19:19.843 --> 03:19:26.598
And then was also identified from the perspective of ESSA as a comprehensive support and improvement.

03:19:28.308 --> 03:19:39.912
district, right, so there was a school in particular that was identified, and then to put the cherry on the cake, or however you want to describe it, it's like, congratulations, Dr. Tallwater, you're going through WASC this year.

03:19:40.993 --> 03:19:55.318
Right, so, he's reflecting on this, and again, we talk about steel walls with our superintendents, and let's speak real with one another, and while we were talking about the changes and acknowledging

03:19:56.098 --> 03:19:58.781
we sense that there's improvement going on.

03:19:59.481 --> 03:20:09.651
There was a declaration through this discussion of like what's the greatest lever and let's focus on this as a county and individual districts over the next, and it was declared 24 months.

03:20:10.752 --> 03:20:12.914
So if you had to guess what it was, here it is.

03:20:14.560 --> 03:20:18.383
let's relentlessly focus on teaching and learning over the next two years.

03:20:18.924 --> 03:20:19.184
That's it.

03:20:19.664 --> 03:20:35.318
So this, for a county office, while we're listening, we're trying to think through how do we make sense of the feedback that we're getting, the data that we're looking at, and then developing comprehensive system of support around our districts.

03:20:35.898 --> 03:20:42.343
So I'm not gonna go overly in detail, but what I'm sharing with you is we're hearing the voice of our superintendents and leaders

03:20:43.084 --> 03:20:44.709
and then creating our system of support.

03:20:44.749 --> 03:20:46.214
And this is what it begins to look like.

03:20:47.816 --> 03:20:57.321
So before I go into the detail of El Dorado County, I do want to acknowledge my colleagues throughout the state, and I'm referring to the total of the 58 county offices of education.

03:20:59.102 --> 03:21:11.669
We've been in a partnership with PACE, the 58 county offices, and we've acknowledged in our work with PACE and having discussions, we're recognizing there are three important shifts with county offices.

03:21:11.709 --> 03:21:15.872
And again, I'm taking a step back, looking at the big picture, and then I'll come right back into El Dorado County.

03:21:16.272 --> 03:21:20.513
And I want to share with you the three shifts that we've concluded as we're doing this work.

03:21:21.313 --> 03:21:26.034
So one, COEs have shared responsibility to improve student outcomes.

03:21:26.074 --> 03:21:26.855
What do I mean by that?

03:21:27.535 --> 03:21:40.098
Realizing the vision of continuous improvement means that every layer of the system assumes a shared responsibility to improve student outcomes, which requires a mindset shift in COEs from their historical role, meaning

03:21:40.678 --> 03:21:43.520
We are owning the results with our districts.

03:21:44.861 --> 03:21:54.107
It's a tone, it's not about compliance, it's about shared responsibility and that's what's being felt with our districts and our leaders and our teachers as county offices too.

03:21:55.117 --> 03:22:07.504
To support continuous improvement in districts, COEs must themselves experience and lead through continuous improvement to build their own capacity and to run their county offices as improvement organizations.

03:22:08.084 --> 03:22:15.609
So while we're using a lot of terminology like improvement, science, and looking at organizations

03:22:16.969 --> 03:22:22.612
In respect to continuous improvement, we know we need to be demonstrating that and living it.

03:22:22.752 --> 03:22:28.275
Third, COEs must break down departmental silos and have access to data systems.

03:22:28.655 --> 03:22:40.140
So in particular, COEs must break down departmental silos and have access to data systems that provide reliable, timely feedback to coordinated resources in order to lead the continuous improvement of districts.

03:22:40.180 --> 03:22:45.103
So these are principles and shifts that are occurring throughout the state, and I'm gonna give you examples

03:22:45.724 --> 03:22:47.916
Now what that looks like in Eldorado County.

03:22:47.936 --> 03:22:49.705
And I go.

03:22:50.373 --> 03:22:53.394
relatively quick through these, I just want you to get a taste of them.

03:22:54.134 --> 03:22:57.615
I think it's most important that you hear from a district superintendent who's living this.

03:22:58.276 --> 03:23:17.042
So first of all, just in respect to the local control accountability plans, we've set up, we, our county offices, set up just a calendar of, a structured calendar where we are meeting with our districts on a regular basis around the LCAPs, both formally and informally.

03:23:17.742 --> 03:23:25.561
So the support around LCAPS comes in a collaborative environment where districts can bring business partners or

03:23:26.263 --> 03:23:33.829
individuals from instruction, and across obviously different departments, essentially breaking silos.

03:23:34.590 --> 03:23:41.956
It's a place where we analyze data, we look at the LCAP summary, and then of course we're looking at annual updates.

03:23:42.136 --> 03:23:51.484
But what I'm pointing at is we are constantly looking at structures that make sense for districts around improving work.

03:23:51.604 --> 03:23:53.946
And in one area in particular where we're seeing

03:23:55.547 --> 03:23:59.128
that we needed to improve was around just stakeholder engagement.

03:23:59.308 --> 03:24:11.154
And when you begin to see a district that is really becoming innovative and looking at good work around stakeholder engagement, and then is in a collaborative environment with other districts, that's a place just to share best practices.

03:24:13.089 --> 03:24:15.170
So we have developed a learning network.

03:24:15.350 --> 03:24:18.412
It's called the Eldorado Professional Improvement Community.

03:24:18.512 --> 03:24:31.781
We had a partnership with Pivot Learning years back that we acknowledge there was areas and learning networks that they were doing good work that helped set up a template for us and we've really launched in that work.

03:24:31.841 --> 03:24:39.226
So districts are given the opportunity to build professional capacity while working with county colleagues across districts

03:24:40.166 --> 03:24:51.400
It's a place for us to bring experts in the field and looking at high-quality data tools to implement change ideas leading to improvement around dashboard results.

03:24:51.440 --> 03:24:59.990
In particular, like three areas of just in respect to problem areas that we've identified

03:25:00.529 --> 03:25:04.891
El Dorado County, we're looking at ELA, math, and then chronic absenteeism.

03:25:04.951 --> 03:25:13.375
Tomorrow, actually, our district superintendents are going to be focusing on chronic absenteeism together as a county at a retreat.

03:25:15.475 --> 03:25:17.677
Principal development is an important piece.

03:25:17.697 --> 03:25:26.985
We're constantly looking at how we could develop leaders and have stability across the county and really developing that bench.

03:25:27.325 --> 03:25:30.408
But I think this partnership that we are actually doing with

03:25:30.868 --> 03:25:33.230
University of Washington around principal development.

03:25:33.270 --> 03:25:36.733
The shift here is that we're looking at capacity building.

03:25:36.813 --> 03:25:39.875
It's an important piece of the work.

03:25:39.915 --> 03:25:53.406
When I say capacity building, the county office is looking at how we are working closely with Eldorado Union High School District in building their capacity to support instructional leaders and their principals and how to do that really well.

03:25:53.846 --> 03:26:01.207
and it's a presentation in and of itself, but it's the capacity piece around principalship development is an area that I wanna highlight.

03:26:02.228 --> 03:26:06.888
Content area specialists, as I've shared, we've seen themes around ELA and math.

03:26:07.688 --> 03:26:10.169
These are voices from our teachers.

03:26:10.249 --> 03:26:21.271
Again, when you're looking at a rural community, you're looking at a different type of capacity, and so we're identifying individuals to really support to go throughout our county, specifically around ELA and math.

03:26:22.071 --> 03:26:30.275
The last piece that I want to speak to, we know that the importance of the relationships with labor and management is an important piece.

03:26:30.776 --> 03:26:37.699
And so we have partnered with Sac County Office of Education, Eldorado County, in participating in the Labor Management Initiative.

03:26:37.739 --> 03:26:49.786
So these are opportunities that exist for our districts, again, to look at specific training and supports around the critical piece with labor and management.

03:26:50.626 --> 03:27:00.508
So what you see is a comprehensive view of how we are trying to be responsive to our district leaders and teachers and of course community members as well.

03:27:00.588 --> 03:27:08.170
So it's my privilege to introduce to you Dr. Marcy Guthrie who will expand further on the work within her district.

03:27:08.190 --> 03:27:12.071
I feel like I need to give you a brain break.

03:27:12.091 --> 03:27:12.291
Thank you.

03:27:14.216 --> 03:27:21.580
I want to just kind of say that I'm glad I'm in the presence of people who are impatient.

03:27:22.660 --> 03:27:24.581
I'm in good company.

03:27:24.601 --> 03:27:27.123
I want to tell you that I'm

03:27:28.240 --> 03:27:32.082
My mom told me I shouldn't say this, but really, I'm the mother of Motherlode Union School District.

03:27:32.142 --> 03:27:33.763
I've been the superintendent for seven years.

03:27:34.443 --> 03:27:41.427
And I stand here having participated and engaged in a lot of things you learned about today or were reminded of today.

03:27:42.287 --> 03:27:50.451
So my colleague, Dr. Tarwater in Lake Tahoe, when he was working through the LCAP, he had differentiated assistance on his radar.

03:27:50.531 --> 03:27:53.413
He had performance indicator review on his radar.

03:27:53.973 --> 03:27:55.414
Then he needed to worry about CSI.

03:27:57.615 --> 03:27:58.995
And then all of a sudden WASC.

03:27:59.056 --> 03:28:03.417
Well, I had all of those except for WASC because I'm an elementary school district.

03:28:03.837 --> 03:28:06.378
And instead of CSI, it was ATSI.

03:28:06.958 --> 03:28:11.819
But at the end of the day, really, that's kind of what we were up against.

03:28:11.899 --> 03:28:17.841
And so I think Dr. Manansala laid it out that we've gone, we are continuing to evolve.

03:28:18.281 --> 03:28:20.222
And I just want to tell you a little bit about Motherload.

03:28:21.262 --> 03:28:22.123
So we have 1,050 students.

03:28:24.437 --> 03:28:31.930
We serve students in the towns, not cities, towns of El Dorado, Diamond Springs, and the unincorporated parts of Placerville.

03:28:33.519 --> 03:28:40.923
We have over 60% of our students who are unduplicated, meaning they are low socioeconomically.

03:28:41.843 --> 03:28:42.683
That's their status.

03:28:43.524 --> 03:28:45.165
They're English learners or they're foster youth.

03:28:45.905 --> 03:28:53.248
We have 59% that qualify for free, reduced, and meet that no high school education graduation rate for parents.

03:28:54.289 --> 03:28:58.691
So that's a match, 60% of our student population.

03:29:00.287 --> 03:29:06.491
We have nearly 14% who are English learners, 12% who are special education.

03:29:07.531 --> 03:29:09.172
We turned in our numbers yesterday.

03:29:09.232 --> 03:29:12.114
We have 72 homeless students out of 1,050.

03:29:12.194 --> 03:29:20.979
12 of them are students with disabilities, 10 of them are English learners, and nine of them are unaccompanied youth.

03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:23.861
So you're not surprised.

03:29:25.162 --> 03:29:25.763
What did I say?

03:29:25.863 --> 03:29:37.634
Mother Lode has a full-time nurse, a full-time counselor, and a full-time school psychologist when other jurisdictions might not have that kind of staffing level and investment in people to support students.

03:29:38.735 --> 03:29:39.035
OK.

03:29:40.336 --> 03:29:48.244
So back when Differentiated Assistance launched, I knew when my phone rang and I saw Ed's name

03:29:49.784 --> 03:29:57.211
that I was, that I, now it's not personal, that we were identified for differentiated assistance.

03:29:57.291 --> 03:30:07.201
Our students with disabilities, their academic outcomes and their suspension rates had triggered differentiated assistance and it was the first year and I'm new, right?

03:30:07.922 --> 03:30:10.084
New to this like the county office is new to this.

03:30:10.784 --> 03:30:12.686
But fortunate for me, I've been in the county

03:30:14.548 --> 03:30:16.730
Now, at that time, four years.

03:30:17.130 --> 03:30:18.211
I have relationships.

03:30:18.471 --> 03:30:20.052
I know my staff.

03:30:20.693 --> 03:30:21.933
I know my community.

03:30:21.953 --> 03:30:24.735
And I know my student and my demographic.

03:30:26.417 --> 03:30:43.309
Well, when you're working your plan and you're doing all of the things that you know we are supposed to be doing in differentiated assistance, which is coming up with a root cause analysis and defining your problem of practice, and I want you to know I heard your questions.

03:30:45.607 --> 03:30:47.385
Everything is tied to the LCAP.

03:30:48.570 --> 03:30:57.396
So what drives differentiated assistance is what really ends up happening when you're doing your annual update in your LCAP and you're drafting your next year.

03:30:57.836 --> 03:31:03.299
So it is a cycle of inquiry, like a plan, do, study, act, process throughout the year.

03:31:03.840 --> 03:31:05.360
But we were identified in December.

03:31:06.001 --> 03:31:07.382
And we were doing all this work.

03:31:07.702 --> 03:31:11.404
And it was in time to shape our LCAP for the subsequent year.

03:31:12.385 --> 03:31:17.488
But it wasn't in time for us to have any real impact to do anything to change what would be

03:31:18.038 --> 03:31:20.382
landing on the next year's dashboard.

03:31:21.224 --> 03:31:29.800
So year two rolls around, and we're still working our plan that we developed in the spring of the previous year, and we're working our LCAP.

03:31:31.394 --> 03:31:34.656
Well, the new indicator, chronic absenteeism, is added.

03:31:35.137 --> 03:31:42.722
Well, not only are we still identified for special education academic indicators and suspension rates, but oh, guess what goes hand in hand?

03:31:43.382 --> 03:31:45.243
The chronic absenteeism indicator.

03:31:45.604 --> 03:31:49.366
So that was our new indicator, and we added a new student group.

03:31:49.506 --> 03:31:59.433
So across the board, our students with disabilities were lighting up our dashboard, and now our white group was also chronically absent.

03:32:01.437 --> 03:32:12.164
And then we got to address the performance indicator review, which means let's get some stakeholders together and let's take a look at this through the lens of special education.

03:32:13.065 --> 03:32:17.768
But when we attacked differentiated assistance in the first year, we backed up and said,

03:32:19.116 --> 03:32:20.496
It starts in general education.

03:32:20.816 --> 03:32:25.597
If we focus only on special education, we will have missed the mark.

03:32:26.038 --> 03:32:27.278
So I get a little passionate, sorry.

03:32:27.818 --> 03:32:29.818
And I'm kind of hungry, okay.

03:32:30.459 --> 03:32:32.819
But, and I could use a Kleenex.

03:32:33.619 --> 03:32:45.422
But I wanted you to hear a few things today, and I'm so glad that I was like the lone district superintendent here to say, I've been living this, and I think that there is promise in this work.

03:32:47.580 --> 03:32:53.382
And I also want you to know, thank you.

03:32:53.402 --> 03:33:02.685
Why I think there's promise is, and I wish she was here, she's in the T-zone, Dr. Darling-Hammond and colleagues identified the positive outliers, right?

03:33:03.285 --> 03:33:10.507
Who are the districts that are having unprecedented growth for students of color,

03:33:11.676 --> 03:33:15.898
African-Americans and Hispanics, despite their demographics.

03:33:16.338 --> 03:33:35.549
And the letter loads on page 29, number 45 out of 167 school districts that were identified as positive outliers that are making a difference for students that are Hispanic or Latino, despite the 60% free and reduced, despite the 72 homeless students.

03:33:36.029 --> 03:33:39.511
So I guess when I am impatient and thinking about outcomes,

03:33:41.167 --> 03:33:42.128
I'm right there with you.

03:33:43.108 --> 03:33:45.129
But I also know that change takes time.

03:33:46.610 --> 03:33:48.271
And I think that leadership matters.

03:33:48.691 --> 03:34:02.139
So even, and I have teacher leaders, my instructional leaders are my principals and my director of student support services, and we're in the work with our, together, and we bring in our teacher leaders.

03:34:02.960 --> 03:34:07.602
I would say that we always have room to improve when it comes to how do we engage our parents.

03:34:08.903 --> 03:34:13.464
And I want you to know that I listened to the student voices this morning and I thought, gosh, I miss high school.

03:34:14.184 --> 03:34:21.386
I miss high school because, well, I just love kids, but high school students are so passionate.

03:34:21.406 --> 03:34:24.367
And I kept thinking, I was not that articulate when I was in high school.

03:34:24.587 --> 03:34:26.267
Thank God there are smart kids out there.

03:34:27.528 --> 03:34:28.728
But we listen to our students.

03:34:30.749 --> 03:34:40.159
And as a matter of fact, through this differentiated assistance process, we used a tool called empathy interviews.

03:34:41.060 --> 03:34:46.646
And we were trying to get our hands around what's up with chronic absenteeism, right?

03:34:48.211 --> 03:34:53.693
And so instead of making all of our own assumptions as adults, we asked.

03:34:54.913 --> 03:34:56.554
We actually asked students.

03:34:57.554 --> 03:35:00.815
And their answers blew our minds.

03:35:02.036 --> 03:35:09.078
So I could bore you all day, but what I want you to know is what makes a difference for Motherlode

03:35:10.086 --> 03:35:11.788
And so we're engaged in the work.

03:35:12.128 --> 03:35:13.790
And we're partnering with our county.

03:35:14.190 --> 03:35:17.173
And we're partnering with our sister and brother districts out there.

03:35:17.213 --> 03:35:27.243
Because when you're small, and you're rural, and you might have six teachers at your largest grade level, there's no other school that has that grade level to talk to.

03:35:27.824 --> 03:35:32.929
So our teachers find great, they find great

03:35:33.311 --> 03:35:40.175
pride and joy in talking to one another, but also reaching out and talking to their fellow colleagues across the county.

03:35:40.635 --> 03:35:45.277
And the County Office of Education and our partnership has created those conditions.

03:35:45.797 --> 03:35:49.900
And they are only getting better and more refined as we move forward in this work.

03:35:50.960 --> 03:35:51.941
I'm going to stop talking.

03:35:53.081 --> 03:35:56.843
But I want to thank you for the opportunity and the Kleenex.

03:36:08.752 --> 03:36:13.055
So just moving forward, I'd like to summarize on a few ideas.

03:36:13.895 --> 03:36:35.870
So first of all, as I was sharing to you the challenges that Dr. Tarwater was speaking to, and one of the things that the superintendent shared with us in the spring was you need to really begin to map out differently and understand all of the activities that we're involved in, and how do you create a more seamless process?

03:36:35.930 --> 03:36:38.512
And we really have taken that to heart.

03:36:39.092 --> 03:37:08.112
And of course we're working across counties with our colleagues, but we're using what's called, right now, the theme again is this idea of coherence, and we're developing what's called our weaving project, where even this month we're meeting with key leaders throughout the state, so I'm just giving you an example, like Tamara Clay and Kirsten Comstock from El Dorado County Office of Education, they have an area of specialty in the PIR and disproportionality process.

03:37:08.712 --> 03:37:11.515
Jenny Snyder from Sonoma County Office of Education.

03:37:11.555 --> 03:37:19.245
She has an emphasis or obviously really understands differentiated assistance well and improvement science will be coming to a meeting.

03:37:19.365 --> 03:37:28.375
And what I'm pointing out to is how do we make a coherent process when you're engaged with all of these different areas?

03:37:29.176 --> 03:37:33.620
And how does that make sense for a Dr. Tarwater or Dr. Guthrie?

03:37:34.060 --> 03:37:39.285
And I can name out the others who are part of that, but that we just see that as an important part of our work.

03:37:39.445 --> 03:37:43.489
And of course, we're going to be working with our respective partners across state agencies.

03:37:44.069 --> 03:37:49.594
The last note that I want to touch on was that on, well, actually, let me go back on.

03:37:49.935 --> 03:37:52.217
Last week, I wanted to extend a thank you to state

03:37:52.657 --> 03:38:02.822
superintendent Tony Thurman and the governor who came out to El Dorado County last week just to really see what the impact of the public safety power shutoffs are in our county.

03:38:02.882 --> 03:38:06.744
It's very real and very challenging and this is how I'd like to finish.

03:38:07.204 --> 03:38:14.007
So in the spring, the superintendent said the declaration was we're going to focus on teaching and learning.

03:38:14.327 --> 03:38:16.948
That's what we want to see throughout our districts and throughout our county.

03:38:17.889 --> 03:38:19.270
But then on October 9th,

03:38:20.911 --> 03:38:25.533
of this year, 11 of our 15 school districts were without power.

03:38:26.594 --> 03:38:30.936
Just imagine the impact on thousands of families throughout our county.

03:38:32.116 --> 03:38:40.060
But at the same time, we had a high number of teachers and principals and even some district leaders

03:38:40.620 --> 03:38:50.071
who had already planned on that day to go hop on a bus and go down to Sanger to learn about the good work they're doing around universal design.

03:38:50.612 --> 03:38:52.033
And to me, it was symbolic.

03:38:52.233 --> 03:38:56.999
It's like, even if the power goes out, even if the power goes out,

03:38:58.387 --> 03:39:00.407
we're gonna continue to focus on teaching and learning.

03:39:01.027 --> 03:39:04.728
So thank you for giving us the opportunity to share what's occurring locally.

03:39:05.308 --> 03:39:15.710
I've been in El Dorado County since 2013 and for almost 15 plus years prior to that in an urban district in Sacramento.

03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:25.192
And so being exposed to be it urban issues or rural issues, if we're looking at poverty or challenges, I'm very appreciative to the board

03:39:25.632 --> 03:39:29.058
that you're willing to listen just to the various voices across California.

03:39:29.619 --> 03:39:29.900
Thank you.

03:39:30.856 --> 03:39:33.258
So, Dr. Monticello, thank you so much, and Dr. Guthrie.

03:39:33.818 --> 03:39:41.524
So, and you all may know, Dr. Monticello also serves with us on CPAC and is a really important voice in our accountability system.

03:39:41.805 --> 03:39:43.806
So, we have a short number of public comments.

03:39:43.846 --> 03:39:52.753
So, what we're gonna do, since we have a tight schedule, we're gonna listen to our public comments, then we'll have one more board comment, if relevant, before we move on, because that'll kind of tie it up.

03:39:52.793 --> 03:39:57.997
So, don't go far, we'll just hear our public comments, and then we'll come back and see if we wanna clarify.

03:39:58.498 --> 03:39:59.979
So, we'll call for public comments now.

03:40:00.419 --> 03:40:02.901
With the following individuals, please step up to the podium.

03:40:03.501 --> 03:40:09.365
Michael Juba, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Brian Rivas, Leticia Garcia, Liz Guillen.

03:40:16.420 --> 03:40:17.961
Let me be the first to say good afternoon.

03:40:19.221 --> 03:40:19.982
Time has slipped by.

03:40:20.442 --> 03:40:24.064
My name is Michael Juba, and I'm speaking on behalf of California Teachers Association.

03:40:25.064 --> 03:40:27.865
And listening to item three, two things popped into my head.

03:40:28.406 --> 03:40:34.709
The integrating the stakeholders' feedback, all of them, and building that collaborative relationship.

03:40:35.789 --> 03:40:54.200
And on behalf of CTA, we're sharing a letter from the Alvord Teacher Association because they've repeatedly attempted to engage in a meaningful stakeholder process but have been ignored by the administration of the Alvord Unified School District, as well as the Riverside Office of Education.

03:40:54.941 --> 03:40:57.682
And we are urging you, the State Board of Education and CDE,

03:40:58.763 --> 03:41:07.109
to follow up on this letter and restore that trust between the local association, the administration, and the County Office of Education.

03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:08.010
Thank you.

03:41:13.114 --> 03:41:13.895
Good afternoon.

03:41:13.975 --> 03:41:20.079
Martha Zaragoza Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

03:41:20.640 --> 03:41:28.286
I'd like to thank you for including the Practitioner's Guide for English Learner Students with Disabilities in Attachment 3 and encouraging its use

03:41:28.866 --> 03:41:35.091
We believe this guide will provide sorely needed guidance to teachers instructing our English learners with special needs.

03:41:35.732 --> 03:41:55.588
While the information in the memorandum and attachments were greatly appreciated, we were disappointed to see that only one geographic lead mentioned their Title III specialist and only one geo lead mentioned that their Title III lead would join their collaborative specific to the EL professional development.

03:41:56.108 --> 03:42:05.438
In attachment 4, the only GOA lead for which there is not an update was the EL Lead Agency San Diego County Office of Ed.

03:42:05.878 --> 03:42:18.551
We hope that in future updates, information will be provided regarding their work and hopefully more information regarding work of the Title 3 specialists and the Title 3 leads will also be provided.

03:42:18.872 --> 03:42:19.172
Thank you.

03:42:26.351 --> 03:42:30.193
Madam President, I'm Brian Rebus speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

03:42:31.153 --> 03:42:32.593
Kudos to your presenters.

03:42:33.134 --> 03:42:41.017
This is incredibly important and difficult work, so I enjoyed the presentation and we're rooting for the success of the overall effort.

03:42:42.097 --> 03:42:49.040
I wanted to share, though, that we agree with our colleagues in the Equity Coalition that we would like to see stakeholder and community engagement.

03:42:49.600 --> 03:42:51.683
adopted as a foundational principle.

03:42:53.105 --> 03:42:56.289
It comes up over and over in our work with community groups.

03:42:56.689 --> 03:43:00.934
And just a reminder, we think it would be really valuable for a couple of things.

03:43:01.115 --> 03:43:06.782
One, we just think it's the right thing to do, but it would facilitate identification of root causes.

03:43:07.382 --> 03:43:14.789
And also looking ahead, we see it as important in sustaining the work the next time we do take a budget downturn.

03:43:15.490 --> 03:43:17.932
It's important to have community support for the work.

03:43:18.052 --> 03:43:22.276
I worry about what happens the next time that we're faced with a budget shortfall.

03:43:22.676 --> 03:43:23.117
So thank you.

03:43:29.342 --> 03:43:34.087
Hello, this is Leticia Garcia on behalf of the Riverside County superintendent of schools.

03:43:34.127 --> 03:43:44.356
Dr. Judy white just wanted to to offer that we have provided the board and state board staff with a comprehensive response to the

03:43:44.896 --> 03:44:01.263
letters submitted by CTA on behalf of the Alvord Education Association that essentially encompasses all the work that our staff has done relative to the LCAP approval and oversight process at that particular school district.

03:44:01.543 --> 03:44:09.487
And we stand ready to have any conversations and meetings with board members and with staff to further elaborate on that.

03:44:09.687 --> 03:44:10.067
So thank you.

03:44:15.609 --> 03:44:23.775
Good afternoon, Liz Guillen with Public Advocates echoing the comments that Brian Rivas made from Ed Trust West.

03:44:24.916 --> 03:44:41.269
We really need to see counties be more proactive in supporting LEAs to include stakeholder and community in the conversations that they're having with LEAs and also in helping LEAs to be more inclusive.

03:44:42.835 --> 03:44:57.705
We think that the essential role of stakeholders has really been missed and that's why we have been relentless in asking that that be recognized in the foundational principles around the system of support.

03:44:58.146 --> 03:45:05.051
We think that without community and stakeholders, changing the mindsets and behaviors is not possible.

03:45:06.312 --> 03:45:08.553
And we think that that needs to happen.

03:45:08.854 --> 03:45:09.274
Thank you.

03:45:12.679 --> 03:45:12.839
Okay.

03:45:12.859 --> 03:45:14.900
Well, I want to thank our public for the comments.

03:45:15.060 --> 03:45:16.601
And so this will just be a chance.

03:45:16.641 --> 03:45:30.348
You don't need to make a comment, but if there were some comments that a board member wanted to make to close out this presentation on system of support and any clarifying with the last presentation, but again, you don't need to comment, but I just want to be respectful in case somebody wanted to.

03:45:30.428 --> 03:45:32.569
So I'll start on this side and we'll start with member record.

03:45:32.609 --> 03:45:33.270
Just one comment.

03:45:33.290 --> 03:45:36.812
Again, I'm reminded we're going to try to do a six o'clock hard stop.

03:45:36.852 --> 03:45:39.333
So let's work really hard to make our points really clear.

03:45:39.633 --> 03:45:40.033
Okay.

03:45:40.153 --> 03:45:41.194
So, um,

03:45:42.134 --> 03:45:52.976
Knowing that I'm only going to be able to make one comment, I did have a specific question for Dr. Marin.

03:45:53.236 --> 03:46:05.159
Yes, but at the same time, because it is a question about stakeholder engagement, it may be more appropriate for me to ask the question of the superintendent that he brought with him.

03:46:05.879 --> 03:46:13.302
Three of the four people who made comments on public comment talked about the problem with stakeholder engagement.

03:46:13.862 --> 03:46:22.826
So, I'm and the county superintendent, there was a representative from the Riverside County Office who came to say, well, we've done everything we're supposed to do.

03:46:23.366 --> 03:46:31.329
So, I'm hearing three different versions of the truth about what's going on concerning stakeholder engagement.

03:46:31.909 --> 03:46:45.239
The stakeholder community seems to be uniform in their concerns that there's some work that counties and districts need to be doing on this stakeholder engagement piece.

03:46:45.279 --> 03:46:53.325
And I was going to ask questions of them, but since we're trying to limit our time, I will take my one question and ask the superintendent.

03:46:53.425 --> 03:46:53.765
Could you?

03:46:53.785 --> 03:46:57.148
Okay.

03:47:04.324 --> 03:47:10.389
Okay, so this is not designed, the question I have because I only get to have one, it is a loaded question.

03:47:10.989 --> 03:47:13.231
So I'm going to apologize for that in advance.

03:47:13.851 --> 03:47:16.954
But you sat in this room and you just heard the same thing I heard.

03:47:17.034 --> 03:47:26.261
I heard what you said about the work that you're doing and what I appreciate from both you and the County Superintendent was the candor

03:47:26.701 --> 03:47:39.209
about how difficult the work has been for you, about addressing the capacity issues, and particularly from the superintendent from Lake Tahoe, about all the plates that he's really struggling to keep up in the air.

03:47:40.230 --> 03:47:45.013
From three of the four stakeholders who gave public comment,

03:47:45.533 --> 03:47:58.903
One of the plates that apparently are being allowed to crash, not in one area, but it seems to be happening pretty uniformly across the state, is about this thing about how you engage stakeholders in meaningful ways.

03:47:59.444 --> 03:48:03.467
At the same time, the county office from Riverside said, we're doing it.

03:48:04.087 --> 03:48:08.451
So I heard something very different from you when you talked about this.

03:48:08.971 --> 03:48:13.835
So I'm going to ask you to tell me, what did you hear

03:48:14.761 --> 03:48:25.872
from these other folks that you struggled with, that may have been common with what you struggled with, and what do you think you've been doing to try to address that?

03:48:28.769 --> 03:48:34.973
So I will open with stakeholder engagement is like communication, right?

03:48:35.013 --> 03:48:41.478
It's something you always have to work on, and I'm always reflecting on how we're going to do it differently or better or refine our practice.

03:48:42.058 --> 03:48:53.846
So part of me just being honest and being Marcy, right, would say I'm thinking that perhaps some reflection, some

03:48:55.507 --> 03:48:56.507
letting down our guards.

03:48:56.948 --> 03:49:01.029
I've had difficulties, I will be honest, with my own stakeholders, so I'm going to speak for me.

03:49:04.331 --> 03:49:06.732
I have to reinvent some things from time to time.

03:49:07.072 --> 03:49:12.034
I have to take a step back, take a deep breath, and figure out a way to make it work.

03:49:12.614 --> 03:49:14.475
And I'll give you an honest answer.

03:49:15.336 --> 03:49:20.518
My first year in differentiated assistance, my, oh God, this is on TV.

03:49:21.158 --> 03:49:29.062
OK, so we had some pushback from our colleagues that this was going to be a long process.

03:49:29.702 --> 03:49:35.164
And so we thought we need to hear the voices of our employees, and we need to hear the voices of our teachers.

03:49:35.784 --> 03:49:43.168
So instead of not having them come to the table, I actually had my principals and directors of departments

03:49:44.068 --> 03:49:57.037
bring the content that we wanted to share to their departments and meetings, and then solicit input on their terms in their time, which would be like a staff meeting, faculty meeting.

03:49:57.878 --> 03:49:59.799
And what I found, quite honestly,

03:50:00.760 --> 03:50:13.129
was that more people were understanding what the LCAP was, the process that we used to build our LCAP, how we solicited their input, so we kind of had to figure it out, right?

03:50:13.189 --> 03:50:24.496
It's like, if this isn't how they want to play, or this isn't working for us, but I still need them to be on this journey with me, I had to figure out something different, and I guess that's it.

03:50:25.277 --> 03:50:28.279
I just did some, I tried something else, and it actually worked.

03:50:29.790 --> 03:50:44.739
But, you know, thank you so much for... And I will close by saying I want to remind you that the three elements that are important for making this process work is patience, persistence, and what was the hallmark and foundation of your answer, humility.

03:50:45.500 --> 03:50:46.981
And I have that quite a bit.

03:50:47.661 --> 03:50:49.983
I'm reminded all the time and my mother reminds me daily.

03:50:50.723 --> 03:50:51.604
Thank you very much.

03:50:51.744 --> 03:50:53.265
Thank you, Dr. Guthrie, for sharing that.

03:50:56.476 --> 03:50:58.458
I also want to thank you, Dr. Guthrie.

03:50:58.478 --> 03:50:59.940
I appreciate your energy.

03:51:00.520 --> 03:51:05.946
Your total physical response really spoke to me as a former EL, kept me very engaged.

03:51:07.027 --> 03:51:09.950
So I think the other thing I heard from public comment was

03:51:10.851 --> 03:51:17.593
How do we, the state board, make sure that we put that affirmation forward, that stakeholder engagement is important?

03:51:18.013 --> 03:51:23.154
And so I actually heard a very light request, which is added to your foundational principles.

03:51:23.514 --> 03:51:26.355
We have LEAs in schools are more than a single number.

03:51:26.595 --> 03:51:28.675
Resource decisions are driven by student need.

03:51:29.335 --> 03:51:31.056
LEAs are the primary unit of change.

03:51:31.736 --> 03:51:36.040
Sub bullet stakeholder engagement is inherent to this process.

03:51:36.601 --> 03:51:42.987
Um, I actually don't think that's a big ask because the process is premise on stakeholder engagement.

03:51:43.408 --> 03:51:46.491
I'm not sure why we would hesitate to add that 4th bullet.

03:51:46.851 --> 03:51:48.433
I think that's something that's reasonable.

03:51:48.533 --> 03:51:49.094
It's what it's.

03:51:49.634 --> 03:51:52.655
transparency, continuous improvement, building trust.

03:51:53.235 --> 03:51:55.316
It's inherent to the policy.

03:51:55.696 --> 03:52:04.839
So I would really like us to consider, and I don't know if there's a hesitation why we wouldn't, and I know that that's just putting it on print and then the hard work is making it happen.

03:52:05.119 --> 03:52:11.621
But I think that at least by putting it, by saying this is part of our affirmations, I think that that carries weight.

03:52:12.241 --> 03:52:12.501
Thank you.

03:52:15.055 --> 03:52:32.425
So I will just say I completely agree with Felicia, and I think that we should, the next time we have an item, we should have that as an action, and so that we can put it on there, because it comes up every time, it's embedded throughout the statute, so I don't, I sort of forgot why we didn't have it in the first place.

03:52:32.865 --> 03:52:36.707
It's certainly, it's an omission, it's certainly not intentional.

03:52:37.228 --> 03:52:42.991
And to that end, I just want to say two things about the collaborative, our colleague Matt Nava, who's at the collaborative,

03:52:43.812 --> 03:52:49.660
a member on behalf of Dr. Darling-Hammond couldn't be here today, so he asked me if I could say a couple of things.

03:52:50.782 --> 03:52:59.515
First, I want to thank Ronnie for her presentation and all the collaboration that's going on between the department, Stephanie and your staff and everyone.

03:52:59.895 --> 03:53:07.319
to make this work, and you all made visible how complicated this is, and so I just want to express my appreciation.

03:53:08.140 --> 03:53:18.805
To the issue about community engagement, I wanted to make sure, because we didn't really highlight that, but that, in one of those slides, we did talk about the community engagement leads, so we are working purposely on that.

03:53:19.166 --> 03:53:25.149
It's being led by San Bernardino County, so maybe the next time we talk about this, we could hear a little bit more about

03:53:25.869 --> 03:53:31.652
what that effort is and how the learnings from that will be made available to everybody else.

03:53:32.352 --> 03:53:43.417
And then the last thing I just wanted to highlight is the collaborative, and Ronnie, you can speak to this if you want, is having a fall event next week, which you're all invited to, called Equity in Action.

03:53:43.497 --> 03:53:44.898
It's on Thursday, November 14th.

03:53:46.338 --> 03:53:50.940
at the library gallery here in downtown Sacramento from 10 to 2.

03:53:51.400 --> 03:53:55.162
So if you're interested, I encourage you to go to the collaborative's website.

03:53:55.182 --> 03:53:57.463
I think all the state board members have been invited.

03:53:57.923 --> 03:54:01.084
And the keynote speaker is Dr. Christopher Edley.

03:54:01.144 --> 03:54:02.985
I think many of you know Chris.

03:54:03.365 --> 03:54:07.287
He's a nationally recognized expert and advocate for equity in education.

03:54:07.347 --> 03:54:08.647
So again, thank you.

03:54:08.707 --> 03:54:10.548
My last thing is Ed, thank you very much.

03:54:10.968 --> 03:54:12.029
You hit the nail on the head.

03:54:12.389 --> 03:54:15.150
You get a gold star for bringing a district superintendent.

03:54:16.071 --> 03:54:18.833
to talk about the work and how they see it visible.

03:54:19.273 --> 03:54:22.036
And thank you, Dr. Guthrie, appreciate your presentation.

03:54:24.261 --> 03:54:26.963
We move on Stephanie, did you or Ronnie want to make a comment or do you.

03:54:27.463 --> 03:54:29.725
Okay, Hank, we're just carrying hold on.

03:54:30.686 --> 03:54:31.686
Just stay right there.

03:54:31.726 --> 03:54:32.507
We're not done yet.

03:54:32.647 --> 03:54:33.107
Okay.

03:54:33.147 --> 03:54:34.368
Go around member sign.

03:54:34.388 --> 03:54:35.469
Did you want to make any comment?

03:54:35.849 --> 03:54:35.989
Um.

03:54:36.510 --> 03:54:46.297
Remember, um, yes, so it's sort of interesting from the perspective of being a new board member, because externally, I've always heard the communications is that.

03:54:47.397 --> 03:54:55.603
The rationale for LEAs being the unit of decision making is that accountability rests there and rests with community.

03:54:56.083 --> 03:54:58.505
And I feel like that has been a part of the public narrative.

03:54:59.005 --> 03:55:08.211
So it's a little bit of catching up sort of what principles I think we articulate explicitly to sort of what the messaging I think has been for quite some time.

03:55:09.912 --> 03:55:14.896
We don't do robust data collection and transparency just for the sake of informing the LEA.

03:55:16.977 --> 03:55:20.102
in order to enable communities, parents, families.

03:55:20.626 --> 03:55:24.789
to actually engage with their LEAs and be a meaningful partner in those decisions.

03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:33.696
The last thing I'll just say is more concretely, this is I think the first system of support item that has come to the board since I've been on.

03:55:34.977 --> 03:55:49.409
And it just might be something helpful to sort of ask our future presenters to actually have a plank in their presentation to talk about what community and stakeholder engagement looks like in the future so that it is a standing part of what comes forward.

03:55:54.046 --> 03:55:57.687
Stephanie, since you and Ronnie are here, we'll just ask you, did you want to make any closing comments?

03:55:57.707 --> 03:56:03.909
I think with patience, persistence, and humility, we're on this journey together.

03:56:03.929 --> 03:56:11.051
I think the difference in other structures previously that we've had, this is new, and the difference is that we're all partners.

03:56:11.652 --> 03:56:16.333
We're all in it for the same reason, going in the same way, and that's different than before.

03:56:16.913 --> 03:56:19.194
as acknowledged by Mary with the county offices.

03:56:19.535 --> 03:56:33.322
On behalf of the state board, just thank you to all of our presenters who took the time to come from your districts and your counties and for the work you're doing every day to put this system together and to really address the issues that we're trying to get to to improve achievement.

03:56:33.382 --> 03:56:36.064
And just thank you so much for the presentation.

03:56:36.644 --> 03:56:39.826
We're going to move on now to agenda item four.

03:56:58.663 --> 03:57:02.744
So this is item four, item five has moved to the end, but this is item four.

03:57:19.651 --> 03:57:20.131
Okay.

03:57:58.291 --> 03:58:01.233
I don't know if we're, okay.

03:58:03.434 --> 03:58:05.856
So we'll start item four with Cindy Casanas.

03:58:06.757 --> 03:58:14.242
This is an update on the implementation of the integrated local, state, and federal accountability and continuous improvement system.

03:58:14.722 --> 03:58:26.850
The adoption of the English learner progress indicator status methodology and the use of status in LEA and school eligibility assistance determination and the update on the dashboard.

03:58:28.322 --> 03:58:28.702
Thank you.

03:58:28.722 --> 03:58:32.623
Good afternoon, members of the Board, Vice President Strauss.

03:58:33.104 --> 03:58:36.885
I'm Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.

03:58:37.485 --> 03:58:44.908
Today, as Member Strauss stated, we will be going through several of our attachments that we've provided to you in Item 4.

03:58:45.668 --> 03:58:57.892
The first is about the English under Progress Indicator, and then we'll walk through what we've been doing as far as getting the word out about the dashboard, as well as stakeholder outreach, and then the actual rollout of the dashboard.

03:58:59.742 --> 03:59:27.200
The action that is recommended for the board is that you approve first the methodology and cut scores for the English learner progress indicator status by splitting levels two and three of the English learner proficiency assessments for California, LPAC, summative assessments, thereby creating six LP levels based on the LPAC, and then second, use the very low status to determine local educational agency and school eligibility for support.

03:59:29.028 --> 03:59:44.155
So to get us started on attachment one, I wanted to first recognize my staff who is working hard to get out the dashboard, and this is our final action from you in order to get out the 2019 dashboard.

03:59:45.156 --> 03:59:54.200
We worked very closely with our colleagues in our assessment division under the direction of Michelle Senner and our colleagues in the English Learner Support Division under the direction of Veronica

03:59:55.180 --> 04:00:10.790
So this has been something that we've been working on for actually a number of years and are very excited to bring forward to you this final action to actually start using our new assessment in the dashboard.

04:00:13.632 --> 04:00:35.764
So I first wanted to start off with who's actually in this indicator because we've had a couple of changes over the last 12 months to 18 months in which this board, some members of this board who were on it when you approved the Every Student Succeeds Act State Plan subsequently asked for a waiver to include more than just current English learners in the indicator.

04:00:36.324 --> 04:00:43.773
So, because that plan or because that waiver was denied, I just wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page about who's included in the indicator.

04:00:44.313 --> 04:00:54.405
So, it's English learner students in first grade through 12th grade who had summative assessment results on the LPATH in the current and prior year.

04:00:56.181 --> 04:01:10.486
So the English learners that are not included are those who were reclassified, or RFEP, before taking the summative assessment in 2019, students who newly arrived, who were designated as English learners in 2019, and then students who graduated in 2018.

04:01:11.006 --> 04:01:15.227
So you need those matched records in order to create progress.

04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:19.472
which is why this is very unique.

04:01:19.512 --> 04:01:27.484
This is a very unique indicator because of the two years needed to determine whether or not a student is progressing from one level to the next to create status.

04:01:27.985 --> 04:01:32.252
So unlike the other indicators, we need those two years of data.

04:01:35.174 --> 04:01:50.286
So in looking at the original methodology for the English Learner Progress Indicator that you adopted back in 2016, there was a splitting of the levels to create more opportunities for students to show progress.

04:01:51.007 --> 04:01:55.290
And this was something that we knew was going to be something we needed to focus on for

04:01:56.491 --> 04:01:58.833
for the new assessment under LPAC.

04:01:59.754 --> 04:02:02.196
And so we did quite a bit of simulations.

04:02:02.256 --> 04:02:08.061
There are quite a bit of tables in your agenda item that demonstrate why we think it's appropriate.

04:02:08.081 --> 04:02:09.483
I'm going to walk through some of those tables now.

04:02:10.484 --> 04:02:19.728
So we're looking at expanding what are currently known as the four LPAC levels into what we are now calling six LP levels.

04:02:20.168 --> 04:02:36.654
So level one is equivalent, if you're reading this particular slide, is equivalent to the LPAC summative assessment level one, and then we split out level two to a low level two, a high level two, similarly with level three, splitting it out, and then keeping level four at level four.

04:02:42.321 --> 04:02:52.989
So in order to make sure that what we are providing to you is based on data and based on fact, we ran several different simulations in order to get to this place.

04:02:53.490 --> 04:02:58.394
When I came to you in September, there was some public comment and there was some interest in looking at it by grade span.

04:02:58.774 --> 04:02:59.775
So we've done that as well.

04:02:59.795 --> 04:03:01.536
I'll show you that in just a little bit.

04:03:02.657 --> 04:03:11.144
But for this slide, what we're showing you is that for levels two and three, we are recommending that we split it right at the middle of the scale scores for each level.

04:03:12.044 --> 04:03:20.269
So, for example, for grade 2, if we look at the LPAC level 2 scale score range is between 1424 and 1470.

04:03:20.749 --> 04:03:35.597
We would split it directly in half to 1424 to 1446 for the level 2L for LP, so our low level for level 2, and our high level starts at 1447 and expands to the top of the range, which is 1470.

04:03:40.100 --> 04:03:54.445
So in order to make sure that we didn't see differences in the data by grade span, we looked at, again, information at the grade level, and then in the grade spans one to eight, nine to 10, and we chunked out 11 and 12.

04:03:54.905 --> 04:04:00.507
And so we looked at increasing one or more performance levels, or maintaining level four on the LPAC.

04:04:00.907 --> 04:04:06.229
We looked at whether or not maintaining performance levels below level four on the LPAC, and then whether or not they've declined.

04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:09.630
So that information, again, is included in the item, and we'll walk through

04:04:10.050 --> 04:04:11.131
some of it in just a little bit.

04:04:13.313 --> 04:04:22.380
So what you can see here is the impact of allowing students those extra opportunities to show progress by splitting the levels.

04:04:22.821 --> 04:04:33.670
So if we kept it at the LPAC, the four levels from LPAC, you see, based on the data that we have, that 37.4% increased or maintained levels.

04:04:33.690 --> 04:04:34.571
So they showed progress.

04:04:36.392 --> 04:04:41.494
We had 48 percent maintained the lower levels and then we had almost 14 percent decline.

04:04:41.854 --> 04:04:49.538
When we split, we see more progress in allowing that increase between where the concentration is, which is in levels two and level three.

04:04:50.318 --> 04:04:55.961
The maintained lower levels decreases, but the decline does go up to 20 percent.

04:04:56.021 --> 04:04:57.282
So that's the balancing out.

04:04:57.902 --> 04:05:08.591
I also wanted to mention that we got a new file this last Friday, and while you see 843,000 matched records, that number has actually gone up to 900,000 with the new file.

04:05:08.611 --> 04:05:19.120
So we were really glad we were able to use the most recent data when we do actually put out the dashboard, but these simulations were done prior to that file being received.

04:05:19.140 --> 04:05:23.544
So the numbers, the match rate is quite high, and we're very appreciative of that.

04:05:24.364 --> 04:05:35.929
We know that the match rate will go up even higher coming this year because we will be using a computer-based assessment and we can use CALPADS as a registration to allow students entry into the assessment.

04:05:39.764 --> 04:05:44.766
So with that, we have colors that are a little different than what you're used to seeing on the dashboard.

04:05:45.306 --> 04:05:48.408
Somebody calls them the Los Angeles Lakers colors.

04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:55.391
Yeah, growing up in Southern California, we were always Lakers fans.

04:05:56.231 --> 04:06:09.703
So this diagram or this chart was included in the item, but it's meant to show where we're at as far as English learners making progress between the 2018 LPAC levels and the 2019 LPAC levels.

04:06:12.245 --> 04:06:17.226
So what you see overall from this is that students are highly concentrated in levels two and three.

04:06:17.546 --> 04:06:20.407
So really the middle of the chart is where the chunk of the students are.

04:06:21.247 --> 04:06:35.130
Compared to the next slide, again, more purple, gray, and yellow, and lots of numbers, but really what you can see now is just a much more, yeah, smoothing out of the data.

04:06:35.150 --> 04:06:36.790
Thank you, that's a good word to use.

04:06:37.310 --> 04:06:42.415
out of the data and so that we don't have these chunks of students or these high concentrations of students.

04:06:42.875 --> 04:06:55.527
Again, this allowing us to split out the levels provides students the opportunity to demonstrate progress on a year-to-year basis because we know that it takes multiple years if you start at level one to get to level four.

04:06:58.289 --> 04:07:01.012
Consider this to be a more fair approach.

04:07:03.410 --> 04:07:09.594
So our recommendation going forward, we took this out to stakeholder groups.

04:07:10.835 --> 04:07:22.183
Not only was Veronica, Veronica has been very supportive of involving us in all of her stakeholder groups, including the Binding Goal Coordinators Network, but Michelle does an in-person assessment stakeholder group, and I got to present to them last week.

04:07:22.223 --> 04:07:31.189
And there was strong support, there has been strong support to the groups that we've been able to reach out to over the last eight weeks on the splitting of the levels.

04:07:31.209 --> 04:07:32.670
I think the data really tells the story

04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.751
very neatly.

04:07:35.673 --> 04:07:44.240
So before we go into cut scores, I wanted to bring back some slides that we actually presented to the California Petitioners Advisory Group three years ago.

04:07:44.581 --> 04:07:52.868
And we got some questions as the agenda came out about why were we using the methodology we were using to establish cut scores.

04:07:53.248 --> 04:07:56.832
And this is really based on your action from several years ago.

04:07:56.892 --> 04:07:59.214
And so I know there are some new faces on the board, and I just

04:07:59.574 --> 04:08:02.116
wanted to be able to bring these slides back.

04:08:02.537 --> 04:08:10.164
If you want to reference any parts of these, this information is actually also was in a memo to the State Board in August of 2016.

04:08:10.204 --> 04:08:21.714
So it's been a while, but this is really, this has been our guiding path as far as how we look at establishing cut scores and methodologies being used.

04:08:22.155 --> 04:08:24.677
So first, and I'm going to take you through both status and change.

04:08:25.698 --> 04:08:28.561
So for status, we look at the data.

04:08:28.681 --> 04:08:45.417
What we have done for each indicator is looked at where we're at with the data from an LEA perspective and from a charter school perspective, and we order the data from highest to lowest, and we look at four cut points selected based on that distribution.

04:08:45.858 --> 04:08:48.861
Those cut points create the five status levels.

04:08:50.578 --> 04:09:01.342
So for change, what we're looking for is, again, LEAs and charters, looking at ordering them separately from highest to lowest for positive change and lowest to highest for negative change.

04:09:02.242 --> 04:09:06.384
And looking at those cut points, we do create the same four cut points.

04:09:06.924 --> 04:09:08.024
They have different names though.

04:09:09.025 --> 04:09:17.768
And then we've always said from the get-go, even when we looked at the language that's in the current SSA plan, that we're going to

04:09:18.348 --> 04:09:25.992
keep these in place so that there's some, you know, there's some, the districts aren't getting a moving target from year to year.

04:09:26.412 --> 04:09:38.258
But if there's a change that is needed because we are seeing something in the data, some noise in the data, we've brought back those cut points to you and you have approved a change in cut point from year to year if there is something that is extreme.

04:09:38.298 --> 04:09:43.861
And so this slide shows you that we use the example of three to five years.

04:09:45.089 --> 04:09:53.135
Additionally, we look at, we've talked about this already, but the cut points are done separately for each indicator because, of course, the data is different for each indicator.

04:09:53.415 --> 04:09:58.799
Suspension rate is very different than what we're looking at right now today for English learner progress.

04:10:00.441 --> 04:10:03.143
So this is the graphic example that we have.

04:10:03.643 --> 04:10:12.868
So first, the first step we do is we look at our very low status, and keeping in mind our very low and our very high, it's about 10% of the distribution.

04:10:13.308 --> 04:10:29.337
So, of course, very low indicates that that is an unacceptable performance, and that oftentimes combined with the change piece may get a district or a school into obtaining a red color on the

04:10:29.757 --> 04:10:30.458
on the dashboard.

04:10:31.998 --> 04:10:36.181
So the other step, the next step we do is looking at the high status cut point.

04:10:36.301 --> 04:10:39.603
And of course that's a requirement under the Everstudent Succeeds Act.

04:10:40.303 --> 04:10:43.725
And so that's our, we have to put that in our plan about what our goal is.

04:10:44.325 --> 04:10:50.829
And that goal is written for each indicator that's relevant in the Everstudent Succeeds Act state plan.

04:10:52.571 --> 04:10:54.071
Then we do the rest of the distribution.

04:10:54.151 --> 04:10:58.133
So you see very low, low, medium, high, and very high.

04:10:58.213 --> 04:11:04.215
So it averages out to what you're going to see in just a little bit from our cut scores.

04:11:05.955 --> 04:11:08.456
And then in establishing the change cut scores,

04:11:09.594 --> 04:11:28.682
Again, starting first with decline significantly, and then moving over to increased, so almost to high, trying to make sure that there's positive change by the majority of the schools is how we set that cut point, and then ending up with the rest of the change distribution there.

04:11:29.142 --> 04:11:37.346
So it's just a nice graphic, a nice reminder of where we were at, what we've been using as our guiding principles for establishing the cut scores that you see before you today.

04:11:40.464 --> 04:11:53.452
So this is probably obvious, but let me just state it out loud that looking at 2018 assessment results for the LPAC, we see that as grade level increases, the percentage of students in level one increases.

04:11:53.852 --> 04:12:03.398
And of course this is noticeable in grades nine through 12, especially when we have students that come in, come from other countries into our public education system.

04:12:04.318 --> 04:12:17.444
And so in looking at simulations and producing our cut scores, we wanted to make sure that we looked at those cut scores to see if there was a noticeable difference between the grade spans, between grades one through eight and nine through 12.

04:12:21.010 --> 04:12:30.014
And what we saw or what you see here on the table, which is also in the agenda item, is that there's not a noticeable difference.

04:12:30.154 --> 04:12:34.215
There's what we see overall.

04:12:35.993 --> 04:12:46.277
is that our number of elementary and unified school districts and the percentages pretty much neatly align to the percent of LEAs as well as the percent of high schools.

04:12:46.377 --> 04:12:55.581
So without that noticeable difference or not significant differences, we think that it's important that we keep the cut scores the same for grades 1 through 12.

04:12:56.201 --> 04:13:06.085
When we do have cut scores that differ by school or district type, I just want to make notice that we do that for the suspension rate, for example, and we do that for the academic indicator.

04:13:06.546 --> 04:13:09.287
We have to spend a lot of time explaining why they're different.

04:13:09.367 --> 04:13:14.469
And so it does take time away from individuals understanding the actual indicator.

04:13:14.509 --> 04:13:20.852
And so if we can keep the cut score distribution together with the grade spans, it helps for communication purposes.

04:13:22.930 --> 04:13:26.792
So these are the status levels and the cut scores we're recommending for very low.

04:13:26.812 --> 04:13:28.773
We would set it at 35%.

04:13:29.893 --> 04:13:34.155
And if we go to that high, so that goal of LP status would be 55% to less than 65%.

04:13:34.255 --> 04:13:35.276
And again, this is based on the data.

04:13:38.317 --> 04:13:44.098
We will revisit these scores next year when we have to bring back to you the cut scores for change.

04:13:45.158 --> 04:14:05.543
And then I would also wanted to mention is that because we're moving to computer-based assessment, Michelle has scheduled as part of a special study for educational testing services to do a comparability study on LPAC and looking at the impact of the computer-based assessments on scores and so on.

04:14:07.187 --> 04:14:11.109
So, where these cut scores land are LEAs, the distribution.

04:14:11.129 --> 04:14:25.397
Again, it's very neat in that we have just under 10% in the very low, 6.5% in the very high, and then you see the bulk of it in the median, which is what we're looking at for a normal distribution.

04:14:27.099 --> 04:14:28.361
and the distribution for schools.

04:14:28.841 --> 04:14:30.083
This does include charter schools.

04:14:30.524 --> 04:14:36.852
Again, very similar with the bulk of our schools in the medium rather.

04:14:39.031 --> 04:14:47.836
So with that, I wanted to shift over to the next piece, which is using this indicator for differentiated assistance.

04:14:48.157 --> 04:14:51.459
Of course, this is required by the U.S.

04:14:51.479 --> 04:14:56.622
Department of Education because we are out of compliance on this issue as a state.

04:14:56.702 --> 04:15:07.868
And so by including the English Learner Progress Indicator as part of identification for schools under the Every Student Succeeds Act, we will come into compliance with that part of ESSA.

04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:13.753
So, a year ago, you approved the use of the status.

04:15:13.853 --> 04:15:37.311
You signaled to not only to, I think, our stakeholders, but to the federal government that we took this seriously and that we would be, in 2019, coming into compliance by using the LP status for use in determining school identification, but we're also going to be using it for identification under the local control funding formula for districts, including charter schools, for the first time.

04:15:38.444 --> 04:15:48.407
So we have spent quite a bit of time on the language that you see here, and what we are recommending is the use of the term very low.

04:15:48.427 --> 04:15:52.248
So you're going to see that throughout this piece for this one year.

04:15:52.528 --> 04:15:58.930
So it's a proxy for REDD, and we are creating resources around it that you're going to see in just a couple of slides as well.

04:15:59.870 --> 04:16:13.203
This terminology has been vetted through the workgroups that you see listed below, among others, and there is interest in making sure that it's different words than using the word red, because it doesn't mean the same thing.

04:16:13.923 --> 04:16:15.685
We didn't create a color this time around, right?

04:16:15.705 --> 04:16:19.489
This is our transition into a color for next year.

04:16:21.388 --> 04:16:39.999
So this is actually a chart I showed you in September, so I'm not going to spend much time on it, but just to emphasize when we're looking at identification of districts under the local control funding formula that you need to be able to show that you're not improving in the different priority areas.

04:16:40.059 --> 04:16:46.503
So keep in mind that English language arts and mathematics and English learner progress indicator are all in the same priority area.

04:16:46.863 --> 04:16:57.732
So in addition to one of those not showing red or for English language arts and math it would be orange and then a combination with red, you'd have to go out of another priority area.

04:16:57.752 --> 04:17:08.881
And so for this one, we see the LP status at very low and the chronic absenteeism of red gets this made up district, Crystal Unified School District into differentiated assistance.

04:17:08.921 --> 04:17:15.386
They are eligible based on those two priority areas because their English learner student group is not progressing.

04:17:17.378 --> 04:17:29.089
So just a reminder for looking at school support, of course we have different criteria that you all adopted with the Every Student Succeeds Act state plan and the criteria is up here on the screen.

04:17:29.550 --> 04:17:41.862
And the example we're using is again the same from September but just to reemphasize the fact that we are looking at majority in this particular example for Amethyst Elementary School, the majority

04:17:43.296 --> 04:17:54.106
of the indicators need to be read for this one, and because Verilow is a proxy for red, they will be identified for support under the comprehensive support and improvement, so CSI.

04:17:57.429 --> 04:18:02.613
OK, so our recommendation is to, again, use the very low as a proxy for red.

04:18:03.613 --> 04:18:06.495
And we look forward to the discussion.

04:18:06.535 --> 04:18:08.697
I don't know if you want me to take a pause here.

04:18:08.857 --> 04:18:10.818
Actually, I did have two more pieces.

04:18:11.739 --> 04:18:20.965
Because there was a lot of discussion, I think, in September from the board and the dais about how are we going to communicate this out to the field, I just wanted to share with you a couple of things that we have in the works.

04:18:21.565 --> 04:18:31.291
So we have spent actually quite a bit of time with the policy group, with the English learner progress indicator work group on what the display is going to look like on the dashboard.

04:18:31.631 --> 04:18:34.633
And we've gotten actually a lot of great feedback.

04:18:34.693 --> 04:18:38.175
And so that display is in development right now.

04:18:38.896 --> 04:18:41.658
It'll be ready for the dashboard release in December.

04:18:42.578 --> 04:18:53.503
We also have a new flyer that is in progress about how status is calculated, so similar to the examples I gave you just now, you would see something like that in this flyer.

04:18:54.404 --> 04:19:04.989
We will have a webinar, you're going to hear a little bit more about the webinar series in just a minute, just dedicated to the English learner progress indicator, which is what we do to support the rollout of the private preview.

04:19:05.549 --> 04:19:16.274
And then finally, we have updated, and we do have a webpage dedicated to the criteria that we use for differentiated assistance on the webpage here listed below.

04:19:16.294 --> 04:19:22.637
So there's quite a bit of support around this, and again, feedback leading up to the development of these resources.

04:19:23.517 --> 04:19:25.378
So, I'm happy to take a pause if there's questions.

04:19:25.398 --> 04:19:26.839
Yeah, let's do a pause at this point.

04:19:26.899 --> 04:19:40.267
So, let me just say, this discussion piece right now, just one comment from each board member plus the liaison comment for accountability is on the splitting of the LPAC to go to six levels because that's the recommendation that's before us.

04:19:40.587 --> 04:19:41.988
And the status, if we could talk about the status.

04:19:42.108 --> 04:19:43.029
and the status as well.

04:19:43.069 --> 04:19:47.135
So I'll start with Member Byrne, myself, over the accountability liaisons.

04:19:47.175 --> 04:19:49.158
Everyone, one clarifying comment.

04:19:49.498 --> 04:19:55.947
Everyone will get a chance if you want, and then we'll go to public comment, come back for discussion, and then Cindy can highlight the dashboard week.

04:19:56.067 --> 04:19:56.908
So Sue first.

04:19:59.071 --> 04:20:04.556
A big thank you, Cindy, to you and your staff, and Michelle, and Veronica, everyone who's worked on this.

04:20:04.636 --> 04:20:05.857
I know it's been a heavy lift.

04:20:06.517 --> 04:20:07.218
Very thoughtful.

04:20:07.258 --> 04:20:13.784
Appreciate all of the stakeholder input that you've received, and I think we're ready to go, but I'll stop there.

04:20:14.224 --> 04:20:27.971
So, let me say, this was discussed at CPEG with support from the CPEG, but I did understand that prior to CPEG, you had actually gone to the work group and gotten other input, and I think that helps us understand the stakeholder input.

04:20:28.011 --> 04:20:41.297
So, if you could quickly share to be prior, the work group, the stakeholder input that you got on this that actually helped inform this splitting, because honestly, at the CPEG meeting, strong support to going to the sixth level.

04:20:41.377 --> 04:20:42.658
So, Cindy, if you'll share that.

04:20:43.078 --> 04:20:52.160
So I think it actually started back with the September board meeting and the public comment that you received and the letters you received talking about the need for more transparency around the data simulations.

04:20:52.220 --> 04:21:07.264
And so as we were able to work with the data in the month of September, we made sure that the tables that you see reflected in the item today, that we were trying to be as transparent as possible about what the data was showing.

04:21:08.004 --> 04:21:12.785
The policy work group, like I said, they got into the weeds.

04:21:12.865 --> 04:21:21.367
They got into word smithing, what you will see on the display, using the words like progress, using words like maintained.

04:21:22.448 --> 04:21:28.509
We want to make sure that this is ultimately what a parent sees on the dashboard as a parent of an English learner.

04:21:28.929 --> 04:21:29.970
It is digestible for them.

04:21:31.770 --> 04:21:52.890
I would say that the work that you see reflected in this item has been shaped and molded and iterated because of not only the policy work group, which is made up of practitioners and researchers and very – and advocates in the field, but also our technical design group spent almost two hours on this topic in

04:21:54.591 --> 04:21:55.751
I remember which month it was.

04:21:55.791 --> 04:21:56.912
It must have been October.

04:21:57.272 --> 04:21:58.392
Things are starting to bleed together.

04:21:58.692 --> 04:22:07.735
But it definitely was iterated, and so we were updating, actually, these slides up until yesterday because everybody likes to talk about the English Learner Progress Indicator.

04:22:07.755 --> 04:22:09.296
So it's nice to have that kind of support.

04:22:09.316 --> 04:22:10.136
Thank you.

04:22:10.396 --> 04:22:12.037
So let me just clarify for board members.

04:22:12.057 --> 04:22:13.157
This is a clarifying question.

04:22:13.517 --> 04:22:16.938
Then we'll go to public comment, and then we'll come back for a board discussion before we take action.

04:22:16.998 --> 04:22:18.239
So, Member Rucker, I'll start with you.

04:22:18.339 --> 04:22:20.399
One comment going around, if you want to make it.

04:22:20.519 --> 04:22:22.300
If you want to wait until after, that's fine, too.

04:22:22.819 --> 04:22:29.164
Cindy, first of all, I want to add my kudos and compliments to your staff for the work that was done on this.

04:22:29.585 --> 04:22:38.272
I think it was a very thorough, comprehensive and thoughtful process that happened not over the matter of a couple of weeks, but this was a long-term

04:22:39.072 --> 04:22:51.439
very detailed and very in-depth conversation about the facets of what it would mean not only to create the cut scores, but also what the impact would look like this in the field.

04:22:51.479 --> 04:22:55.201
So I'm very grateful for the process that happened with this.

04:22:55.621 --> 04:22:57.582
I do want a clarification about

04:22:58.002 --> 04:23:00.824
the out of compliance part that you said on ESSA.

04:23:01.124 --> 04:23:03.486
You said that in one sentence and you kept going.

04:23:03.946 --> 04:23:13.832
So, what did you mean when you said that by approving this, we would fall into compliance?

04:23:13.852 --> 04:23:24.539
Because the way you said that made it seem like we were accidentally getting into compliance rather than we worked on this in a purposeful way to make it work for the compliance requirements we had to meet.

04:23:24.819 --> 04:23:26.280
I hope that question made sense.

04:23:26.720 --> 04:23:31.403
and I like the words that you chose to use instead of the words I chose to use.

04:23:31.523 --> 04:23:33.765
I'd like to take it back and let's start over.

04:23:33.785 --> 04:23:36.987
I think the board had a very thoughtful approach.

04:23:37.367 --> 04:23:38.488
I would agree with you on that.

04:23:38.988 --> 04:23:45.993
We have spent probably more time on this indicator than a lot of the other indicators because of the board's commitment to making this work.

04:23:46.573 --> 04:23:56.340
So because switching from one assessment to another assessment takes time and we want to be thoughtful about it,

04:23:57.141 --> 04:24:01.965
we did not have two years of data until this year to create status.

04:24:02.026 --> 04:24:12.856
So last year we were able to show on the dashboard simply how students were doing for the one year of that assessment.

04:24:13.176 --> 04:24:19.863
We were not able to use that information to actually show that schools weren't

04:24:21.344 --> 04:24:22.745
weren't helping their students learn English.

04:24:23.025 --> 04:24:32.707
And so as a result, the federal government deemed that we were out of compliance because you need to use that in the identification of schools under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

04:24:33.168 --> 04:24:48.472
So this is a very purposely driven recommendation and it's been a long road that we've all been on together, but this will bring us into full compliance of that measure come when the dashboard gets out in December.

04:24:54.551 --> 04:24:55.211
Thank you, Cindy.

04:24:55.632 --> 04:24:58.554
I want to just foreshadow some of the comments that we'll hear.

04:24:59.394 --> 04:25:02.816
There was a lot of concern about the methodology that we use for the LP.

04:25:03.216 --> 04:25:11.201
There was concerns that some students would not actually reclassified within the established timeline of five, four to seven years.

04:25:12.462 --> 04:25:17.427
This, when we think of our English learner population, we all know here there's many typologies.

04:25:17.467 --> 04:25:19.729
There's not one specific English learner.

04:25:20.329 --> 04:25:23.292
And so, I do want us to be thoughtful.

04:25:23.752 --> 04:25:28.256
I appreciate the commitment to reviewing our data, our thresholds next year.

04:25:28.677 --> 04:25:30.799
We'll have three years of LPAC data.

04:25:30.899 --> 04:25:34.162
We'll have one year of data based on computer-based assessment.

04:25:34.582 --> 04:25:38.584
And so it will really benefit us to have that discussion next year.

04:25:39.024 --> 04:25:43.626
But I also want us to be mindful of who are we looking at when we're looking at our data.

04:25:44.787 --> 04:25:48.108
80% of our students that are English learners are born in the U.S.

04:25:48.568 --> 04:25:56.072
So there's no reason why any of those students who we take into our school system so early on should ever become long-term Ls, right?

04:25:56.492 --> 04:26:02.955
And so just being mindful of that as we're looking at the data moving forward and then revisiting our cut scores to see if those are appropriate.

04:26:03.335 --> 04:26:03.595
Thank you.

04:26:13.118 --> 04:26:19.644
So, what we're, I guess, Cindy, go ahead, because I need just a couple announcements, then we'll go to public comment, then we'll come back for board discussion.

04:26:20.458 --> 04:26:26.641
Great, so this is just giving us a little, showing off a little bit of our work.

04:26:26.661 --> 04:26:27.141
How about that?

04:26:28.642 --> 04:26:44.330
So, led by individuals in the state board office as well as the CDE communications office and others, we launched a dashboard week in September, sort of a back to school kind of awareness about the dashboard.

04:26:44.470 --> 04:26:47.212
And so in this one particular week, it was after the board meeting,

04:26:48.652 --> 04:26:52.474
We did targeted messages about the dashboard and the resources that were available.

04:26:52.494 --> 04:26:54.275
I just wanted to share some statistics with you.

04:26:54.315 --> 04:26:58.597
I think part of this is in the board item now.

04:26:58.617 --> 04:27:05.801
In that one single week, we did see 16,000 individual hits to the dashboard, including 9,500 of those being new users.

04:27:09.883 --> 04:27:13.506
25%, a little bit more than that, raised from the prior week.

04:27:14.647 --> 04:27:17.910
Let the Conversations Begin is the video that you see on the homepage of the dashboard.

04:27:17.950 --> 04:27:22.193
There's also three additional videos, and all of these videos are translated into Spanish.

04:27:22.573 --> 04:27:30.059
We just got some statistics on that particular video for the length of time it's been up, from December to October, and we've had 10,000 hits on that video.

04:27:32.441 --> 04:27:36.002
We still are not getting a lot of hits on the Spanish videos.

04:27:36.062 --> 04:27:49.526
So I'm still, even though we did a whole day around this on social media around the translations that were available, and you can see that's bullet four, translated materials, I think we still need to do some targeted messaging to parents.

04:27:49.646 --> 04:27:59.689
And because we will be onboarding new languages come 2020, early 2020, I think this will be a great time to also highlight those translated materials that are available.

04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:05.113
We did put together, you're gonna see, I'm gonna pass this out and we can look at it at your leisure.

04:28:07.273 --> 04:28:10.215
an equity report, and I'm going to show you that in just a minute.

04:28:10.855 --> 04:28:16.178
And we did get additional users to look at the mobile app or download the mobile app, so that's good, too.

04:28:16.318 --> 04:28:30.986
And then we have a joint newsletter that is a combination of our system of support colleagues in the department, as well as our Title I division, who's helped us to talk a lot about what's going on with the dashboard in one place.

04:28:32.807 --> 04:28:44.558
So we've taken this slide and these activities from our colleagues in assessments because they actually created this template, but I like just to reflect on what we've been doing since we last met.

04:28:44.678 --> 04:28:48.161
And so we have done 15 in-person presentations.

04:28:48.321 --> 04:28:49.882
That doesn't include the two that we did today.

04:28:50.643 --> 04:28:54.825
already before this meeting with 1,300 participants.

04:28:55.365 --> 04:29:02.589
Michelle is going to show you some things from the conference that they just held, and at that conference we had in my session about 150 people.

04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:04.149
So very well attended.

04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:06.430
Folks are very interested in the dashboard.

04:29:07.211 --> 04:29:11.373
We are starting our webinar series, and so you're going to see that with this rollout piece.

04:29:12.273 --> 04:29:17.679
So the flyer you have before you is one that we put together specifically around equity because we wanted to draw attention to it.

04:29:19.021 --> 04:29:26.749
Our superintendent is very focused on closing the achievement gap and we wanted to show how we're able to show that on the dashboard at a glance.

04:29:26.810 --> 04:29:30.434
And so that's what this flyer is intended to do.

04:29:30.934 --> 04:29:39.298
We have other flyers that we're creating, and we've actually rearranged our web page to make it a bit more user-friendly.

04:29:39.658 --> 04:29:42.780
Sometimes we get a lot of things on our website, and it's hard to navigate.

04:29:42.820 --> 04:29:45.141
And so we did a refresh just this last week.

04:29:46.062 --> 04:29:53.485
One of the things that we are going to be uploading in the next couple of weeks are some flyers around how you calculate these things.

04:29:53.546 --> 04:30:00.229
So again, with the same look and feel with the color scheme and trying to make it one page or two pages or less will be

04:30:00.976 --> 04:30:07.862
updating our college career indicator piece to just make it a little bit more user friendly and a fresh look.

04:30:08.322 --> 04:30:10.624
And then we have a flyer on how to compare schools.

04:30:11.124 --> 04:30:18.250
So keep in mind that the dashboard has a component in which you can look at a single school district and compare schools across it.

04:30:18.290 --> 04:30:22.013
And so there is a couple of different ways to look at that information and we wanted to make sure that we

04:30:22.433 --> 04:30:33.596
For those that have not let go of similar schools criteria from the academic performance index from a decade ago or more, this is our attempt to say you can still look at comparing schools.

04:30:33.916 --> 04:30:39.477
Here's how you do it within a different, not similar schools, but in a different context.

04:30:40.057 --> 04:30:43.698
Then we also are going to do a flyer on what is our dashboard alternative school status.

04:30:45.378 --> 04:30:46.519
So we are very busy.

04:30:46.539 --> 04:30:48.020
This is Jenny.

04:30:48.200 --> 04:30:57.887
Jenny Singh leads the effort to make sure that the division, the entire division is on task to complete the activities in the time that we've told the field we were going to do that.

04:30:58.968 --> 04:31:04.691
We've just sent out for private preview chronic absenteeism data.

04:31:05.052 --> 04:31:07.353
The suspension data got a little more complicated this year.

04:31:07.553 --> 04:31:10.635
We added some factors in for cow pads.

04:31:10.715 --> 04:31:12.296
So we're still working on that data.

04:31:13.337 --> 04:31:21.280
But on our webinar just a couple of days ago, we had close to 500 people, and I expect more for next week's webinar on graduation rate and college career indicator.

04:31:21.620 --> 04:31:23.240
These webinars are open to anybody.

04:31:23.680 --> 04:31:28.662
The private preview is only open to designated staff at districts and schools.

04:31:29.980 --> 04:31:35.062
So we are on track to release the dashboard the week of December 9th to 13th.

04:31:36.102 --> 04:31:45.026
What we are planning to do is to release the companion data request report, so that's the graduation rate, chronic absenteeism, and our discipline reports.

04:31:45.526 --> 04:31:50.088
So that is our plan for the next couple of weeks.

04:31:50.728 --> 04:31:52.269
And here's your action before you.

04:31:53.826 --> 04:31:56.067
Okay, so Cindy, thank you so much for the presentation.

04:31:56.127 --> 04:32:00.808
So we're going to go to public comments now, and then we'll come back for board discussion and an action.

04:32:04.069 --> 04:32:06.369
We have seven speakers for public comment.

04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:16.072
Martha Zaragoza Diaz, Lorraine Richards, Samantha Tran, Dean Drescher, Brian Rivas, Liz Guillen, and Sarah Lillis, please line up.

04:32:17.577 --> 04:32:18.257
Good afternoon.

04:32:18.317 --> 04:32:24.161
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

04:32:24.721 --> 04:32:29.164
We support the establishment of the six LP levels based on the LPAC.

04:32:29.624 --> 04:32:44.634
However, concerns have been expressed by our members that the proposed cut scores for each level will not support transitioning an EL out of their status within five to seven years, but instead result in many ELs becoming LTELs.

04:32:45.214 --> 04:32:56.125
Therefore, we would like for you to seriously consider using a criterion reference versus a norm reference methodology in setting the cut scores for each performance level.

04:32:56.625 --> 04:33:01.670
We believe this would result in the likelihood of ELs transitioning within five to seven years.

04:33:02.911 --> 04:33:16.102
Once the third year data is available, it is strongly requested that a complete review of the cut scores for status and then change be done and that there be a review of the thresholds for the proficiency levels.

04:33:16.623 --> 04:33:20.926
Our members stand ready to assist you and have continued discussions on these issues.

04:33:21.067 --> 04:33:21.387
Thank you.

04:33:28.120 --> 04:33:30.441
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

04:33:30.841 --> 04:33:35.704
CTA supports the six levels and will continue to monitor progress of English learners.

04:33:41.827 --> 04:33:55.675
Good afternoon, Samantha Tran with Children Now, and I think Martha said it perfectly, so I'll just say ditto and really appreciate the board and staff's work to get the LP on the dashboard this year and hoping that we can revisit the conversation around cut scores when it comes back up next year.

04:33:55.795 --> 04:33:56.035
Thank you.

04:33:59.588 --> 04:34:04.753
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis with Teach Plus, and again reiterating the points made by Kaveh and Children Now.

04:34:04.813 --> 04:34:14.082
We also support the six levels, or the split, but we do have concerns about the signal being sent by the cut scores, particularly as it relates to our goal.

04:34:14.102 --> 04:34:21.048
When we talk about high as being our goal, if we're saying 55% of students making one level of progress a year is our goal,

04:34:21.849 --> 04:34:28.784
clearly the expectations for reclassification and knowing the barrier that reclassification plays in our students' lives, how important that is.

04:34:28.824 --> 04:34:32.812
So really pushing, as my colleague said, to revisit that.

04:34:37.247 --> 04:34:38.307
Good afternoon, Dean Drescher.

04:34:38.327 --> 04:34:42.089
On behalf of EdVoice, all of my colleagues have said it very nicely.

04:34:42.829 --> 04:34:48.572
And so I recommend that, again, we use a criterion reference approach versus the norm reference that's been proposed.

04:34:49.812 --> 04:35:02.398
And the reason for this is exactly how Sarah just laid it out, which is to increase the likelihood that English learners will transition in five to seven years according to the research that the department cites to justify establishing the six performance levels.

04:35:03.778 --> 04:35:11.380
And so we support the use of criterion reference methodology and would encourage you all to revisit that.

04:35:11.580 --> 04:35:11.900
Thank you.

04:35:15.801 --> 04:35:18.122
Hello, Liz Guillen for Public Advocates.

04:35:19.382 --> 04:35:21.963
I agree with everything that was already stated.

04:35:22.923 --> 04:35:26.344
And I am happy that we are going to revisit this next year.

04:35:27.464 --> 04:35:30.225
And the coalition is as well, the equity coalition.

04:35:30.345 --> 04:35:30.725
Thank you.

04:35:35.511 --> 04:35:37.092
Thank you very much for our public comments.

04:35:37.132 --> 04:35:47.602
So we're gonna go back to the action that is being recommended to us, and then I'll look for a motion and a second, and then any comments before we move on.

04:35:47.762 --> 04:35:51.345
So do I have a motion?

04:35:51.365 --> 04:35:53.507
I move the department's recommendation.

04:35:56.110 --> 04:35:58.212
Okay, so board discussion.

04:36:01.212 --> 04:36:04.033
Do we want to make any comments?

04:36:04.073 --> 04:36:04.513
Yes, go ahead.

04:36:05.594 --> 04:36:06.294
I had a question.

04:36:06.334 --> 04:36:10.595
I don't know if this is part of this presentation on the Navigator.

04:36:12.216 --> 04:36:14.717
So I'll just ask it because I don't think you're going to model it, right?

04:36:14.997 --> 04:36:15.277
Sure.

04:36:15.597 --> 04:36:17.098
I am not going to model it today.

04:36:17.678 --> 04:36:23.620
The California School Dashboard Navigator is a GIS mapping tool that we've shown to you twice.

04:36:23.720 --> 04:36:27.001
We actually reiterated it again because we're continuously improving.

04:36:30.043 --> 04:36:34.385
It was so popular that on the webinar it took a while to load.

04:36:34.405 --> 04:36:38.888
I will say that GIS mapping is something we continue to work on as a department.

04:36:39.008 --> 04:36:42.470
We have a total of one person dedicated to this work.

04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:44.331
And they work for Jonathan Eisler.

04:36:44.391 --> 04:36:46.033
So his name is Greg Dixon.

04:36:46.153 --> 04:36:47.694
He's great, but he's one person.

04:36:47.934 --> 04:36:52.438
And he's also doing fire mapping and things that come up in an emergency.

04:36:52.519 --> 04:37:00.846
So we have planned to continue to work actually with the comp center to develop out mapping components.

04:37:00.886 --> 04:37:05.570
Because I'm sorry, you took me on a detour, but I wanted to say this out loud.

04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:09.714
Things like Barbara Murchison comes to me and says, I have this grant I want to get out.

04:37:11.415 --> 04:37:15.037
Can you tell me where these resources are statewide?

04:37:15.498 --> 04:37:28.026
I think as we look at not only accountability but other data points, the geographic piece is actually a very useful tool, but we need to figure out a way to make sure it reaches the masses.

04:37:28.626 --> 04:37:31.187
With that in mind, I invite you all to JS Day.

04:37:31.288 --> 04:37:31.988
It's next week.

04:37:32.008 --> 04:37:32.668
I think it's the 14th, right?

04:37:34.571 --> 04:37:36.652
13th in this room.

04:37:36.672 --> 04:37:41.235
This is our fourth year of hosting that.

04:37:41.255 --> 04:37:51.341
We have students coming to present, because there are students out there that work with mapping tools, not only at the high school level, but middle, and I think even elementary in some areas.

04:37:52.081 --> 04:37:58.725
So the Navigator is just one of a lot of things you're going to see from the department in the future on GIS.

04:37:59.824 --> 04:38:03.147
Because as soon as I saw the link, I wanted to look at it.

04:38:03.948 --> 04:38:04.828
It is slow.

04:38:04.928 --> 04:38:05.369
It is slow.

04:38:05.669 --> 04:38:08.831
Even offline, because it was like midnight, and I'm like, oh, let me see what's happening.

04:38:08.851 --> 04:38:09.772
And it was a little slow.

04:38:09.792 --> 04:38:17.378
I'm not really sure what the no color means, and it would be great to select multiple state indicators so that you could see.

04:38:17.938 --> 04:38:27.927
Because right now I'm limited to one student population, one indicator, it would be great to see, to select multiple student populations or even regions and multiple state indicators.

04:38:28.307 --> 04:38:32.210
And of course, eventually the LP should be included here, because we don't have one yet.

04:38:32.370 --> 04:38:33.471
Definitely be included in there.

04:38:33.571 --> 04:38:34.412
Thank you for the feedback.

04:38:36.794 --> 04:38:37.795
Any other board, Kim?

04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:47.172
A clarifying question for, so in order to revisit the conversation around cut scores, that's something that will come back as we have the third year of data.

04:38:47.192 --> 04:38:51.753
There's nothing procedurally that needs to be done that's based on passport action already, right?

04:38:51.773 --> 04:39:00.176
Based on passport action, the methodology that we use, but I want to say that, you know, I did reference that we have a normative way of looking at it.

04:39:00.236 --> 04:39:02.077
That's what the cut scores are today.

04:39:02.877 --> 04:39:04.579
Moving forward those customers are gonna.

04:39:04.599 --> 04:39:17.852
You know where our district's land are gonna change and and the research Talks to us about you know what they've they've observed is you know three to five years for oral Attainment and longer for academic.

04:39:17.892 --> 04:39:21.396
That's not what the department is saying we want students to learn English as a

04:39:22.016 --> 04:39:24.097
as quickly as appropriate.

04:39:24.357 --> 04:39:36.583
I think there has been some mixing of terms and we will come back next year when we look at creating a change cut score and we can look at the status cut scores as appropriate next year as well.

04:39:43.697 --> 04:39:46.038
more comments from the board members or clarification.

04:39:47.638 --> 04:39:47.959
Okay.

04:39:48.239 --> 04:39:55.061
So at this point, let's show we have a motion to support the recommendation from CDE.

04:39:55.181 --> 04:39:57.462
So can I have a show of hands of all those in favor?

04:40:00.526 --> 04:40:01.126
Opposed?

04:40:01.487 --> 04:40:02.267
Any abstentions?

04:40:02.727 --> 04:40:04.449
So the motion passes unanimously.

04:40:04.609 --> 04:40:05.709
So thank you very much.

04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:07.831
So I have a quick announcement.

04:40:08.671 --> 04:40:11.993
First of all, item five will be heard at the end of our agenda.

04:40:12.754 --> 04:40:20.519
And also, we're gonna hear waivers in a little bit, but waiver W-5 has been withdrawn by CDE.

04:40:20.539 --> 04:40:22.280
So it'll be posted on the website.

04:40:22.340 --> 04:40:25.162
So it's been withdrawn for this board meeting.

04:40:25.842 --> 04:40:28.084
W-5 waiver has been withdrawn.

04:40:28.724 --> 04:40:53.264
Okay, so we are now skipping we're not gonna we will come back to item 5 and we're going to go to item 6 And again board members if you need to take a rolling break just make sure we have a quorum in the room, okay, thanks Good afternoon

04:40:56.698 --> 04:40:59.379
The mics are very soft and quiet today.

04:41:00.259 --> 04:41:01.640
So, but I think it's on.

04:41:02.600 --> 04:41:08.002
So good afternoon, Michelle Senner, the director of the assessment division here at the department.

04:41:08.943 --> 04:41:15.305
So today I'm going to have an item, I lovingly refer to it as our mega item.

04:41:15.785 --> 04:41:24.489
So in other words, we do have some action before you today in item six, as well as some informational information that I wanna share with you.

04:41:25.129 --> 04:41:27.591
So the action is on this slide right here.

04:41:27.811 --> 04:41:35.056
The department asked the board to approve the proposed threshold scores for the California Science Test or the CAST.

04:41:35.836 --> 04:41:39.438
Those threshold scores are shown in attachment two.

04:41:40.459 --> 04:41:48.748
So in terms of my presentation, I plan to start with a presentation on the proposed threshold scores.

04:41:49.549 --> 04:41:58.779
Then I will follow it up with more of the informational parts of the item, and I have some breaks in between those sections so you can ask your clarifying questions.

04:42:01.519 --> 04:42:17.813
So in this section of my presentation on the proposed threshold scores for the California Science Test or the CAST, I just want to reiterate that the CAST threshold scores are for the overall scale score for grades 5, 8, and high school.

04:42:18.514 --> 04:42:22.277
These threshold scores are in Table 1 of Attachment 2.

04:42:25.051 --> 04:42:42.152
Before I dive too much into that, I want to acknowledge and thank Eileen Strauss for observing the standard setting process, and hopefully when we have time for comments, you'll be able to share out on your thoughts of the process that we used.

04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:50.291
So the science assessment was developed to comply with the following requirements that you see on the slide here.

04:42:50.951 --> 04:42:55.512
It's administered pursuant to California Education Code.

04:42:55.573 --> 04:42:59.893
The action before you today also meets the Code of Federal Regulations.

04:43:00.274 --> 04:43:10.876
Those regulations require a minimum of three levels to be established for performance, as well as achievement scores that differentiate between those levels.

04:43:11.756 --> 04:43:28.702
Also important to note is that the work accomplished was guided by action that the board took when you approved the general achievement level descriptors for this test and will serve as part of our submission to the U.S.

04:43:28.742 --> 04:43:33.984
Department of Education as part of our federal peer review process for this new test.

04:43:36.385 --> 04:43:42.086
The CAST is aligned to the California Next Generation Science Standards or the California NGSS.

04:43:42.846 --> 04:43:46.467
It's administered to students in five, eight, and one time in high school.

04:43:47.287 --> 04:43:49.147
It measures three science domains.

04:43:49.767 --> 04:43:55.408
Those three dimensional domains are earth and space, life, and physical sciences.

04:43:56.489 --> 04:43:59.289
CAST is proposed to have four achievement levels.

04:44:00.349 --> 04:44:04.510
Those would be exceeded, met, nearly met, and not met.

04:44:07.728 --> 04:44:15.974
This slide here shows the massive amount of work that my staff as well as our contractors have done thus far on this new test.

04:44:16.594 --> 04:44:22.539
So just to go over this quickly, we know that the standards were adopted in 2013.

04:44:24.940 --> 04:44:38.329
The board approved our high-level test design for this test in 2016, and then in 2017, you approved the general achievement level descriptors as well as the test blueprint for this test.

04:44:39.349 --> 04:44:44.593
Following a pilot and field test, the first operational administration of CAST occurred in 2019.

04:44:47.034 --> 04:45:05.695
ETS conducted the standard setting workshop in July and August and we brought forth information from that workshop to our technical advisory group in September and that brings us to today where I'm asking for your approval of the threshold scores.

04:45:08.414 --> 04:45:18.597
So we did provide to the board a detailed standard setting plan for this science test in an informational memorandum that was provided to you in October.

04:45:19.557 --> 04:45:23.838
The standard setting approach utilized the ANGOF method of standard setting.

04:45:24.678 --> 04:45:30.400
That's a little new for California, but not a new standard setting methodology.

04:45:31.640 --> 04:45:39.424
The method is widely accepted, adheres to guidelines and best practices that are recommended in standard setting literature.

04:45:39.444 --> 04:45:48.049
And I'm going to go over in the next few slides just a slight overview of what that standard setting process was.

04:45:49.249 --> 04:45:55.211
So this slide might look a little familiar because I used it, something very similar last time when we talked about the Spanish test.

04:45:56.511 --> 04:46:00.653
So for the CAST, you see the four levels on this slide.

04:46:00.993 --> 04:46:04.334
Four achievement levels mean three threshold scores.

04:46:05.434 --> 04:46:11.376
So our panelists define the borderline student for levels two, three, and four.

04:46:11.936 --> 04:46:15.658
That's the solid colored characters, I guess you wanna call them.

04:46:16.798 --> 04:46:23.881
So, in other words, they looked at what does performance look like for a student that is just in level three, for example.

04:46:24.601 --> 04:46:27.182
So that would be the solid pink character in this slide.

04:46:28.162 --> 04:46:44.408
Those borderline student definitions are also referred to as threshold achievement level descriptors, are an important tool, and it is what our panelists used to make their recommendations on the threshold score judgments that they did.

04:46:46.960 --> 04:46:51.044
The standard setting process involved educators first taking the test.

04:46:51.564 --> 04:46:56.469
I think it's one of their favorite things to do when they're with us.

04:46:56.669 --> 04:47:00.592
The panelists reviewed the grade-specific achievement level descriptors.

04:47:01.013 --> 04:47:05.517
They define those behaviors of the borderline student that I just described.

04:47:06.237 --> 04:47:10.641
And then they used all of that information in three rounds of judgments.

04:47:11.642 --> 04:47:18.064
and their judgments were the likelihood that students at that borderline definition would answer an item correctly.

04:47:18.885 --> 04:47:24.807
And they engaged in quite in-depth conversations between each of those rounds.

04:47:26.320 --> 04:47:36.328
So in summary, you can think of the ANGOF method as panelists making judgments on the likelihood of the borderline student answering each item correctly.

04:47:36.868 --> 04:47:44.274
So specifically, they were asked what percent of students at each of the borderlines would answer the question correctly.

04:47:48.467 --> 04:48:01.157
So that was a very simplistic overview of the process, and it probably doesn't really convey the depth of the conversation that occurred, the content conversations that the panelists had at the meetings.

04:48:02.959 --> 04:48:10.865
All you have is me saying so, and maybe Eileen Strauss will also be able to share that that was something that occurred.

04:48:21.768 --> 04:48:24.409
Okay, that's just a fascinating part of the standard setting.

04:48:24.429 --> 04:48:25.369
I'll go back to that slide.

04:48:25.389 --> 04:48:27.169
By the way, it's the same process.

04:48:27.209 --> 04:48:29.610
Please watch with the Spanish test.

04:48:29.630 --> 04:48:34.791
So it's worth sharing because it's fascinating and so impressive, the process.

04:48:34.811 --> 04:48:35.992
So go ahead.

04:48:36.112 --> 04:48:38.652
It's a very deliberate process.

04:48:38.992 --> 04:48:40.253
So we have

04:48:40.993 --> 04:48:45.434
descriptors that define, let's use level three in this example.

04:48:45.474 --> 04:48:48.555
That's the pink range here on the slide in front of you.

04:48:49.076 --> 04:48:54.117
So we have descriptors that describe student performance at level three in general.

04:48:54.797 --> 04:49:04.800
But in order for us to really know where we should set the threshold, we actually need a definition of what the solid pink character looks like.

04:49:05.501 --> 04:49:09.122
That is the character that is just in level three.

04:49:10.362 --> 04:49:27.495
If you think about what that student knows and can do in terms of how they demonstrate it on the test, it actually looks more like the student that is at the top of the green than it does look like the student that is at the top of the pink.

04:49:29.056 --> 04:49:43.392
So they engage in these conversations about what does it mean to be just in level three, just in level four, and they make that definition of that student and what it means in terms of the content they would know.

04:49:44.173 --> 04:49:48.535
and they use those definitions to make that judgment about each item.

04:49:48.715 --> 04:49:52.136
And they think about, they call it just-in for just-in.

04:49:52.696 --> 04:50:01.559
So they think about just-in and whether or not just-in for level three, what is the percent that they would get that item correctly?

04:50:02.460 --> 04:50:02.980
Does that help?

04:50:04.292 --> 04:50:05.173
Oh yeah, that helped.

04:50:05.333 --> 04:50:16.683
The reason why I was asking that is because I recall with Smarter Balanced when the performance level descriptors were adopted, they were adopted with some intentionality by the consortium.

04:50:17.243 --> 04:50:21.287
Who developed and adopted these performance level descriptors?

04:50:22.108 --> 04:50:26.670
So there are multiple performance level descriptors.

04:50:27.451 --> 04:50:34.674
There are threshold descriptors, which is what these definitions are that relate to the student that is just in.

04:50:35.535 --> 04:50:41.358
There are range descriptors, which define performance across that entire pink thing.

04:50:41.918 --> 04:50:43.359
They are that level, sorry.

04:50:44.320 --> 04:50:46.282
And then there are policy descriptors.

04:50:46.742 --> 04:50:49.425
So this board adopted the policy descriptors.

04:50:49.485 --> 04:50:50.606
That's what I wanted to hear.

04:50:50.626 --> 04:50:50.706
Okay.

04:50:51.407 --> 04:51:01.155
And our educator panelists are the ones that come up with the descriptors for the threshold as well as the descriptors for the range.

04:51:02.677 --> 04:51:03.317
Is that helpful?

04:51:03.638 --> 04:51:04.198
That's helpful.

04:51:04.398 --> 04:51:04.698
Okay.

04:51:04.739 --> 04:51:05.059
Thank you.

04:51:07.057 --> 04:51:10.699
So I think I was describing who our panelists were, I think is where I was.

04:51:11.399 --> 04:51:19.264
So if you look at attachment three of this item, you will see some information about our panelists.

04:51:19.384 --> 04:51:22.385
They were 46 diverse California educators.

04:51:23.066 --> 04:51:30.450
These educators have indicated that they have made measures themselves to implement the California Next Generation Science Standards in their teaching.

04:51:31.468 --> 04:51:36.512
We all know it's early on in implementation, but these teachers did indicate that they were doing so.

04:51:37.653 --> 04:51:44.077
The panel's judgments are provided to you in Table 2, in Attachment 2 of the item.

04:51:44.878 --> 04:51:57.887
The CDE consulted with members of the CASP Technical Advisory Group, as well as our own in-house psychometricians, before we finalized the proposed recommendations that you actually see in Table 1.

04:51:59.168 --> 04:52:07.916
The proposed threshold scores result in approximately 30% of students meeting standards.

04:52:10.378 --> 04:52:22.368
In addition to the CASP technical advisory group, briefings were also held with members of our national science expert design team and the California Science Teachers Association.

04:52:25.276 --> 04:52:36.086
So this is a simplified version of the table that you have in Attachment 2 that represents the proposed threshold scores.

04:52:36.947 --> 04:52:49.739
So in order to make sure that we maintain fidelity with the work of our standard setting panel, the threshold scores that we are proposing are within plus or minus one conditional standard error of measurement of the panelist's recommendations.

04:52:50.802 --> 04:53:00.815
This is all adjustments are within the natural air variance around the panelist recommendation and therefore reflect only slight modifications of their judgments.

04:53:12.336 --> 04:53:24.343
So to provide additional context as you consider the threshold scores before you today, I also want to provide you with a little bit of data and information that we received directly from our test takers.

04:53:25.404 --> 04:53:31.567
So immediately after completion of our computer-based science test, students took a survey.

04:53:31.747 --> 04:53:34.089
So this is self-reported data from our students.

04:53:35.948 --> 04:53:44.878
And we asked them about whether they were receiving science instruction in the three science domains, earth and space sciences, life sciences, and physical sciences.

04:53:46.800 --> 04:53:53.508
Grades five and eight, we had three survey questions, and in high school we had an additional question, so there were four there.

04:53:55.253 --> 04:54:00.054
The survey results you have outlined for you in attachment three of the item.

04:54:00.895 --> 04:54:11.818
In general, some of the highlights would be that a majority of students reported receiving instruction on most of the topics covered on the test.

04:54:13.098 --> 04:54:19.940
More than one third of the students felt most of the CAS questions were different from the questions that they were getting in their science classes.

04:54:21.457 --> 04:54:29.604
A majority of students stated that the science questions were harder or about as hard as questions in their science classes.

04:54:31.226 --> 04:54:37.391
And most high school students indicated that they took the test after their last science course in high school.

04:54:40.447 --> 04:54:48.371
So looking beyond today, if the board approves these threshold scores, ETS will then generate our student score reports to send out to our districts.

04:54:49.192 --> 04:54:57.416
And we would anticipate that the department would then provide its public web reporting of this test in January.

04:55:01.138 --> 04:55:09.082
So I'm gonna pause there for clarifying questions before we move on to the aspects that are not related to actions.

04:55:10.017 --> 04:55:13.521
Okay, so I'll just make one comment and then I'll go to a member of the Chiesa Cone and anybody else.

04:55:14.121 --> 04:55:20.127
So this was really amazing for any of us who, several of us have already seen standard setting processes.

04:55:20.468 --> 04:55:24.832
But in addition to the survey that students responded to, I appreciate those comments, Michelle.

04:55:25.693 --> 04:55:32.240
The teachers on the panel really committed people who were really implementing NGSS and really have a sense about it.

04:55:32.700 --> 04:55:36.523
By the way, ETS did an amazing job facilitating this.

04:55:36.563 --> 04:55:41.186
Just a credit to ETS and the work in this process, and I appreciated being an observer.

04:55:41.666 --> 04:55:53.634
But the teachers were asked, what would you now tell teachers about CAST and science instruction as a result of you now setting the standards and looking at the difficulty of the assessments?

04:55:54.014 --> 04:56:01.878
And the feedback from the teachers was amazingly powerful about the vocabulary needed on these tests, about the academic challenges.

04:56:02.039 --> 04:56:13.605
And I had actually asked ETS and CDE if there was a way from the standard setting process that we could create a guidance document as people are working on implementation, because we know people are just

04:56:14.285 --> 04:56:19.309
adopting aligned materials in the next year or so, and it is a slow transition process.

04:56:19.349 --> 04:56:36.722
But let me just say to credit to ETS and the teachers that participate in the standard setting, they have a lot to tell us about the implementation that I think we should listen to if you've been, and I know Patricia's actually been on a standard setting committee, you really learn a lot that might help us in instruction.

04:56:36.762 --> 04:56:38.263
So I'll just put that on the table.

04:56:38.323 --> 04:56:41.646
I'll move to our member Ortiz-Lacon and then other clarifying questions.

04:56:43.892 --> 04:56:45.212
And thank you for the presentation.

04:56:45.352 --> 04:56:46.993
Actually, that was part of my question.

04:56:47.413 --> 04:56:56.815
What do we know from the reflection of teachers, not just the ones that were part of this threshold score setting committee, but just teachers in general?

04:56:56.895 --> 04:57:00.756
Because when I read, for me, what was fascinating was the survey to students.

04:57:01.536 --> 04:57:03.777
And I wanted to know, is this mandatory?

04:57:03.817 --> 04:57:09.198
Did every student that took the exam, they had to, was it a mandatory selection before they exit?

04:57:09.538 --> 04:57:10.959
Or did we miss some data?

04:57:11.039 --> 04:57:12.439
Not every student, was it optional?

04:57:14.467 --> 04:57:17.770
It looks like it wasn't all, but the majority of students did answer.

04:57:17.790 --> 04:57:28.099
Yeah, because I thought, well, this would be great if districts had access to the information from the students and then maybe triangulate that with their scores and teacher feedback.

04:57:28.400 --> 04:57:38.349
Because I know that this is something that is of interest, and we want to make sure that it also resonates and people understand, are we really equipping our students and our teachers for this?

04:57:39.226 --> 04:57:49.555
So just so I can respond to that, we are currently working on getting the student results in a summary for districts that we can provide to our districts.

04:57:49.695 --> 04:57:51.237
We hope to have that done by the end of the month.

04:57:56.345 --> 04:58:12.616
Well, Michelle, you and your team never cease to amaze me, not only with the level of expertise you have on the work that's being undertaken, but just how you make something so very complex really understandable in very plain English.

04:58:12.636 --> 04:58:14.217
So I truly appreciate that.

04:58:15.798 --> 04:58:18.060
and Board Member Strauss is correct.

04:58:18.140 --> 04:58:31.991
I have participated on a standard setting panel and this one, this standard setting method was very different from what was used to do the standard setting for the other two assessments that we have in our accountability system that's in our academic indicator.

04:58:33.032 --> 04:58:39.197
One of the reasons why I was asking for the explanation about what a borderline student is

04:58:39.777 --> 04:58:59.167
is because that was a term of art I hadn't heard before in the standard setting conversation and that seems to, so I'm going to ask you just to correct me on this, it seems with the other standard setting method used for English language arts and math, the indicator focused on a definition of proficiency.

04:58:59.787 --> 04:59:17.779
So is this, and I'm using that word on purpose because it was level three, what is the difference in how, since there's more than one dimension that went into this definition, how was that actually explored?

04:59:17.839 --> 04:59:25.785
Is it related to the standards that were identified for the assessment, the blueprint standards that were identified for the assessment?

04:59:25.865 --> 04:59:41.002
And I think I know, so identifying and defining the borderline student is not different to this methodology that is used in the bookmark method also, which is the methodology that we have used for some of our other tests.

04:59:42.415 --> 04:59:53.767
But you are also correct that when we have this conversation about the borderline student, we also use the policy definitions that this board adopted.

04:59:54.267 --> 04:59:59.573
And when you think back to the policy definitions that you adopted, you, in essence, told them

05:00:00.033 --> 05:00:03.256
which level met standard, right?

05:00:03.776 --> 05:00:17.388
So that proficiency, if you will, conversation is part of that in the sense that when you are defining that particular borderline for that specific level, you are talking about from that point on, you've identified that as meeting standard.

05:00:18.189 --> 05:00:20.511
That was the other piece I was trying to get you to say.

05:00:21.412 --> 05:00:22.132
Thank you.

05:00:27.270 --> 05:00:28.471
OK, so you can continue.

05:00:28.491 --> 05:00:29.632
OK.

05:00:30.734 --> 05:00:37.781
So not that that wasn't fun, but let's go on to some more fun things.

05:00:41.803 --> 05:00:50.090
Okay, so now we're going to do some updates with you, and since we've been talking about science, we'll just continue and start with the science updates that we have for you.

05:00:50.871 --> 05:00:55.835
So, the second operational CAS test is going to launch on January 14th.

05:00:56.496 --> 05:00:58.718
So, it's never ending.

05:00:58.798 --> 05:00:59.619
We don't get a break.

05:00:59.659 --> 05:01:00.299
So, January 14th.

05:01:02.280 --> 05:01:12.004
We have refreshed our training and practice tests, and those are available now, so students, parents, guardians, educators can all go online.

05:01:12.764 --> 05:01:25.349
They can use our training tests to become familiar with the different item types that we have on our test, and they can use the practice tests to really review more of the depth and breadth that we have represented on the test as a whole.

05:01:27.426 --> 05:01:32.948
So now a little bit of an update on our English language proficiency assessments for California, or ELPAC.

05:01:33.068 --> 05:01:36.489
I'm really trying to get out of using acronyms so much.

05:01:37.690 --> 05:01:43.052
So as you know, the computer-based ELPAC field test has been going on.

05:01:43.112 --> 05:01:48.214
It's in its final week, and hopefully it will end this Friday.

05:01:49.645 --> 05:01:55.352
I want to extend a huge thank you to the 370 LEAs that volunteered to participate.

05:01:55.953 --> 05:02:01.720
I know there were others that wanted to participate, but with some of the power outages, they were unable to do so.

05:02:01.820 --> 05:02:03.903
So thank you for the 370 that were able to participate.

05:02:07.447 --> 05:02:19.097
So, just as a reminder, the purpose of the field test was to collect item level statistics on our science items as we prepare for the, not our science test, sorry, did I say that?

05:02:19.157 --> 05:02:19.838
On our LPAC.

05:02:21.939 --> 05:02:26.684
On our operational LPAC that begins on February 1st.

05:02:28.641 --> 05:02:37.947
So a post-test survey was sent out to all of them who participated, or will be sent out since we've extended the timeline, to all that participated.

05:02:37.967 --> 05:02:41.849
We're gonna collect feedback about the administration of the computer-based test.

05:02:42.750 --> 05:02:51.876
We will use that feedback to determine improvements that need to be made to the administration materials, as well as future administrations of our computer-based test.

05:02:53.246 --> 05:02:56.869
A summary of the post-test survey will be provided to this board.

05:02:57.229 --> 05:03:00.292
We anticipate that to happen in February.

05:03:01.713 --> 05:03:05.556
We are also still in the process of collecting data for the comparability study.

05:03:05.576 --> 05:03:09.399
I know that Cindy mentioned the comparability study in her presentation a moment ago.

05:03:10.641 --> 05:03:21.788
Part of the data collection during the comparability study is information on mode effects between test items administered on a computer and test items administered in a paper version.

05:03:22.629 --> 05:03:27.332
That work is being done to ensure that scores across those two modes are comparable.

05:03:28.953 --> 05:03:34.556
The comparability study report, we anticipate we'll be able to provide that to the board in spring of 2020.

05:03:36.653 --> 05:03:41.097
We are also in the process of conducting two LPAC studies.

05:03:41.357 --> 05:03:48.264
The first is an accessibility pilot and the second is a cognitive lab study.

05:03:50.286 --> 05:04:00.875
The purpose of the accessibility study is to try out accessibility resources, ensure they are working the way that we intend them to work for our students.

05:04:02.006 --> 05:04:09.396
The accessibility pilot is open to any English learner who would require any accessibility resource during testing.

05:04:10.578 --> 05:04:12.580
The cognitive lab study is a little different.

05:04:12.801 --> 05:04:19.389
It's going to focus specifically on English learners who have a visual impairment or are deaf and hard of hearing.

05:04:21.024 --> 05:04:23.106
So we will collect that information.

05:04:23.346 --> 05:04:33.617
Of course, we are always dedicated to continuous improvement and enhancements of our assessments in California, as well as the accessibility resources that we provide as part of those assessments.

05:04:34.998 --> 05:04:44.948
In August of 2020, we expect to be able to provide the board with some summary reports on those two special studies that ETS is doing on our behalf.

05:04:48.129 --> 05:04:59.777
Now, if I can navigate a video and speak, I'm going to share with you a new tool that we have available to our districts, our schools, and our teachers here in California.

05:04:59.897 --> 05:05:06.482
And this is based off of conversations that we had with this board about the transition to computer-based.

05:05:07.823 --> 05:05:17.650
So one of the key outcomes that we had on the usability pilot study last spring was to develop what we're referring to as the technology readiness checker for students.

05:05:19.508 --> 05:05:28.192
The intent of this optional tool is to provide our educators with a means to check students familiarity with device navigation skills.

05:05:29.573 --> 05:05:41.418
Those might be dragging and dropping, scrolling, expanding, minimizing screens, windows, those types of skills that our students use on our various assessments.

05:05:41.438 --> 05:05:48.602
So the tool represents the student device interactions that we have on our computer-based LPAC.

05:05:50.225 --> 05:06:11.768
So it is specific to LPAC, but that being said, we have shared this tool and demoed this tool for several audiences now, including AXI, as well as our CASP stakeholder group that includes representatives from CTA, CFT, AXA, CSBA, Charter School Administration, CSTA, I said that, I'm sure I missed some.

05:06:12.669 --> 05:06:24.736
And in all of those conversations, we have heard excitement about using this tool for all students, not necessarily just students who would be participating in ELPAC.

05:06:26.197 --> 05:06:33.702
So in developing the tool, though, since it was for ELPAC, ETS wanted to make sure that, one, it was engaging for our students.

05:06:34.682 --> 05:06:36.063
They wanted it to be game-like.

05:06:36.944 --> 05:06:37.964
They wanted

05:06:39.264 --> 05:06:41.506
it to create a storyboard for students.

05:06:41.546 --> 05:06:43.548
We thought that might be engaging for them.

05:06:44.489 --> 05:06:50.394
And intentionally, we also did not include text or speech in the tool.

05:06:50.614 --> 05:06:51.615
So there will be no sound.

05:06:52.316 --> 05:06:54.858
So now let me start the demonstration.

05:06:54.878 --> 05:06:58.321
And it's a video that I'll just run through here.

05:06:58.821 --> 05:07:04.106
And the video that's running through is on the website that is linked from this PowerPoint.

05:07:06.696 --> 05:07:16.820
As you can see, the tool begins by selecting the grade, next student information, and teacher emails entered, so the teacher can receive a student report at the end of the session.

05:07:16.840 --> 05:07:20.041
It's going faster than I am.

05:07:24.942 --> 05:07:29.043
It's important to note that none of the student or teacher information is stored.

05:07:29.223 --> 05:07:31.844
So we're not collecting this for use by us.

05:07:32.004 --> 05:07:34.065
It is purely for local use.

05:07:35.265 --> 05:07:43.787
So it does disappear once it's done, but teachers will receive a report in their email that they can use.

05:07:45.047 --> 05:07:49.848
So the tool begins by showing how to select a panel and drag and drop a background.

05:07:49.908 --> 05:07:51.789
So you can see here this background is

05:07:53.291 --> 05:07:54.752
the ocean, I think.

05:07:56.734 --> 05:08:01.179
And so next, if I let it, ooh, that is not what it was supposed to do.

05:08:07.426 --> 05:08:08.827
So let it go through that for a second.

05:08:09.248 --> 05:08:20.518
So after you select the background, which in this case was the ocean, and you saw a different background, which was the sky, you then select a character to be a part of your story or your storyboard.

05:08:21.118 --> 05:08:24.941
And then you can drag that character onto the background.

05:08:24.961 --> 05:08:28.324
So you can see here all kinds of different backgrounds that students have to pick from.

05:08:29.205 --> 05:08:32.908
And you can see that they are engaging in navigation skills, right?

05:08:34.997 --> 05:08:38.800
did a drag and drop, they just expanded that screen to view things.

05:08:40.481 --> 05:08:46.505
Next, we wanna make sure that they have fun things to do, so you can see accessories that they can put on their characters, right?

05:08:46.605 --> 05:08:52.489
So, sunglasses, I think there's ice cream in there, I don't know why, but of course I remember the ice cream.

05:08:53.950 --> 05:09:02.977
And then, what you see here is a demonstration of students have the ability to use the record function,

05:09:03.857 --> 05:09:06.219
to mimic what is done on our test.

05:09:06.280 --> 05:09:18.611
For some students, we are asking them to record so that we have some read-behinds, but they're oral speech-behinds, if you will, to ensure that we have

05:09:19.872 --> 05:09:21.853
appropriate local scoring happening.

05:09:22.233 --> 05:09:34.139
So you can see they also can, which is fun for our students, hit the record button and tell you a story that goes along with the storyboard that they have just created there.

05:09:35.199 --> 05:09:36.400
And then they can play that back.

05:09:37.760 --> 05:09:45.706
So once the student does that, then you get what we're referring to as the student progress dashboard.

05:09:46.407 --> 05:09:48.609
And by the way, I've told them it can't be called the dashboard.

05:09:48.649 --> 05:09:49.709
We have to change that name.

05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:51.631
So sorry, it will be changed.

05:09:53.833 --> 05:09:55.414
OK.

05:09:56.315 --> 05:09:57.716
So the teacher will get this.

05:09:59.949 --> 05:10:03.213
set of information in an email that goes back to them.

05:10:03.253 --> 05:10:08.999
So if you look at this report, you can see how many times the student was able to demonstrate each of the skills.

05:10:10.000 --> 05:10:15.667
And they're the things I talked about, scrolling, selecting, and answer.

05:10:15.947 --> 05:10:17.809
They're not really answers, but it mimics that.

05:10:18.965 --> 05:10:27.551
So if you looked at this screen right now, you can see that the student can demonstrate scrolling, but they did not demonstrate that they know how to expand or minimize.

05:10:28.612 --> 05:10:30.633
And you can see that from this information.

05:10:31.394 --> 05:10:33.515
So this is where we are right now.

05:10:33.616 --> 05:10:40.180
And currently, our LEAs are participating in our field test of our computer-based LPAC.

05:10:40.661 --> 05:10:42.342
And so we'll be asking them for feedback.

05:10:43.662 --> 05:10:54.747
on this tool so that we can gather that feedback and have conversations to determine what guidance we should provide our educators for selecting our supports for students.

05:10:55.747 --> 05:11:03.550
So you might recall, in terms of our last action we had before this board, there are two technology supports that can be used for students.

05:11:03.650 --> 05:11:09.193
So if you saw this student, you might think they need a support, or you might actually sit down with them and say,

05:11:10.495 --> 05:11:12.318
show me how you expand a screen, right?

05:11:12.638 --> 05:11:15.142
Or you might just look at this and decide they need a support.

05:11:16.063 --> 05:11:18.847
So first is the technology navigation assistant.

05:11:20.160 --> 05:11:25.982
This is a trained test examiner that can support student navigation in the test delivery platform.

05:11:26.382 --> 05:11:27.982
It's considered a universal tool.

05:11:28.142 --> 05:11:30.083
In other words, any student can have it.

05:11:30.123 --> 05:11:33.384
You don't need any kind of label associated with you to get this.

05:11:34.384 --> 05:11:39.626
These types of support provided may include showing a student how to move the mouse, how to scroll.

05:11:40.246 --> 05:11:46.988
If they get stuck and you just need to go and do small amounts of interactions with your student, that might be appropriate.

05:11:47.668 --> 05:11:50.331
The second is a designated interface assistant.

05:11:50.371 --> 05:11:53.334
So these are students who need more help, right?

05:11:53.374 --> 05:11:57.818
So we have a tiered approach for students who may need more help.

05:11:58.439 --> 05:12:00.561
So this is, again, a training test examiner.

05:12:01.061 --> 05:12:05.366
And in this case, the examiner enters all the responses for the student.

05:12:05.446 --> 05:12:10.391
So the student does not need to engage and have proficiency in navigation skills

05:12:11.071 --> 05:12:17.118
In order to take the computer-based LPAC, they could be assigned a designated interface assistant.

05:12:17.678 --> 05:12:20.001
That is considered a designated support.

05:12:20.521 --> 05:12:23.284
So again, that is available for any student.

05:12:23.304 --> 05:12:26.107
You don't need to have a label.

05:12:26.347 --> 05:12:34.035
You do need an adult to select that for you in terms of our accessibility designations.

05:12:37.091 --> 05:12:44.635
So, I'm gonna stop there, I'm gonna pause there, I'm gonna look for the tissue box, and then I'm gonna answer any clarifying questions that you have.

05:12:46.636 --> 05:12:52.699
So, okay, so, okay?

05:12:53.219 --> 05:12:53.839
Yeah.

05:12:53.859 --> 05:12:54.560
Pass the box around.

05:12:55.060 --> 05:12:55.800
Allergies, sorry.

05:12:55.820 --> 05:12:57.221
No, I know.

05:12:57.641 --> 05:13:05.405
All right, so there's just clarifying questions on LPEC, that's all we're talking about, and I know, Felicia, you went, did you go to this standard setting or the Spanish assessment standard setting?

05:13:08.402 --> 05:13:09.663
Oh, yes, you did.

05:13:10.323 --> 05:13:12.104
Okay, so again, we're not done with the item.

05:13:12.164 --> 05:13:15.985
We're just trying to clarify this part, and then we have a little bit more, and then we'll go to comments and discussion.

05:13:16.005 --> 05:13:16.385
I got more.

05:13:16.545 --> 05:13:20.147
Because Patricia told me I could have some time.

05:13:21.127 --> 05:13:21.968
Mega item, right?

05:13:22.808 --> 05:13:24.729
Okay, President Darling-Hammond.

05:13:25.916 --> 05:13:27.658
First of all, I'm really excited to see this.

05:13:27.678 --> 05:13:35.586
It was a great, I think, innovation and I agree with the folks who think we might want to be able to use it beyond this LPEC.

05:13:35.626 --> 05:13:41.792
I'm wondering, so how do you then guide the districts when they get the profile on the student like the one we got?

05:13:42.593 --> 05:13:45.616
What would they then decide to do or how would you help guide them?

05:13:46.581 --> 05:13:52.184
So we started having those conversations thinking that we could create that guidance.

05:13:52.804 --> 05:13:57.367
And then I paused and suggested we not do that right now.

05:13:58.528 --> 05:14:11.735
I would rather, I feel more comfortable using the information from our educators and having conversations with those educators that were involved in the field test so that we can have a document developed that would provide the guidance.

05:14:12.095 --> 05:14:13.676
So we have every intent to do that.

05:14:14.998 --> 05:14:19.024
But I would feel more comfortable talking to our teachers before developing it.

05:14:19.265 --> 05:14:23.191
Some of the people using it will be assembled to help begin with the guidance.

05:14:23.331 --> 05:14:23.612
Yes.

05:14:24.694 --> 05:14:25.435
Member Ortiz-Lincoln.

05:14:29.418 --> 05:14:31.218
I also had a similar thought.

05:14:31.278 --> 05:14:35.879
I thought, well, would a teacher know what would trigger sort of the need to use it?

05:14:36.440 --> 05:14:44.361
And then when I was looking at the check marks, I thought, well, is it, if you're above three, then, you know, you could do this.

05:14:45.441 --> 05:14:56.984
So I do think that there's gonna be some tighter guidance needed, but I'm also wondering, once a school system or a district in a school, once they have the information, will they have the capacity to assign somebody?

05:14:58.305 --> 05:15:03.248
to say, hey, we know that Jose or whomever needs that one-on-one.

05:15:03.308 --> 05:15:05.949
Somebody needs to administer this assessment.

05:15:06.510 --> 05:15:20.258
So is there going to be a feedback loop where that, those reflections, first year administering a computer-based assessment, when is that gonna happen so that we know what we're looking at?

05:15:20.319 --> 05:15:23.841
Is it a function of support, technology, or skillset?

05:15:24.421 --> 05:15:37.925
Absolutely, every year after our testing we do a post-test survey and so I know that ETS behind me is listening to your remarks so we will make sure that we include questions that address your concern in the post-test survey this year.

05:15:39.386 --> 05:15:41.386
Member Sanghez-Lazon, do you have any comments?

05:15:42.607 --> 05:15:50.629
I just, we had some questions around the technology piece of it and I just want to just commend you guys for doing such a great job.

05:15:52.810 --> 05:15:53.270
Member Rucker?

05:15:55.646 --> 05:16:08.390
Well, Michelle, one of the questions I always ask you every year when you do the report on the assessments itself is what kind of information do you have from the field about the use of the accessibility tools?

05:16:08.830 --> 05:16:24.254
And so I hope that as you're building out the guidance, especially for the implementation of this, that we have some way in that feedback loop of also collecting summative data about how the accessibility tools were used by how many students

05:16:24.674 --> 05:16:36.283
in how many different districts because I still have a concern even when the guidance is well written that there's still an underutilization of the tools for the students it was intended for.

05:16:36.723 --> 05:16:44.829
So I think having the data about who's using it and where will give us some better information about how to clarify that utilization.

05:16:44.849 --> 05:16:49.953
And by the way, I didn't get that information from you this year about this year's state assessment.

05:16:50.333 --> 05:17:01.660
So I think that it's a continuing conversation for us because it continues to be a problem of confusion in the field already with the accessibility tools and who can use them.

05:17:02.081 --> 05:17:05.343
And it's still my concern that they remain underutilized.

05:17:05.703 --> 05:17:21.735
And so going then to this new computer-based assessment, because for the same reasons that districts are not making the accessibility tools available to all students as they should, we may see the same kind of thing happening as we go to this computer-based assessment as well.

05:17:21.755 --> 05:17:31.442
So you are absolutely correct that I thought I would come to this board providing you with data on the use instead of the assignment.

05:17:32.323 --> 05:17:34.044
And I had every intention to do that.

05:17:35.513 --> 05:17:38.376
In reality, what happened was we did receive a data file.

05:17:38.476 --> 05:17:48.145
So imagine a data file for millions of students for every single item, whether or not they used each accessibility support.

05:17:48.245 --> 05:17:51.227
It was a small number that we were taking on year one, right?

05:17:52.388 --> 05:18:06.758
And so we received that, and there were obvious questions that we had about the criteria that were used to set up that data file.

05:18:07.478 --> 05:18:09.400
And those questions are outstanding.

05:18:10.220 --> 05:18:12.362
They are questions we've submitted to AIR.

05:18:12.942 --> 05:18:15.984
I've also requested that AIR, I believe,

05:18:17.645 --> 05:18:33.048
Stephanie Gregson was in one of her first meetings when we had a very honest conversation with them about how this is a priority in California and asked them to fulfill their commitment to helping California understand that data set.

05:18:33.308 --> 05:18:34.228
They have not done that.

05:18:35.448 --> 05:18:42.750
And so we are continuing to do that and we are continuing also our conversations with the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:49.676
so that maybe multiple states can come together to try and figure out how we analyze this data.

05:18:50.176 --> 05:18:56.702
We're also working with University of Minnesota, correct?

05:18:57.062 --> 05:19:08.033
Yes, University of Minnesota, in terms of looking at that data set and how you would take that massive amount of information and visualize it in a way that we could actually interpret it and understand.

05:19:08.613 --> 05:19:10.740
So we have also created that partnership.

05:19:11.061 --> 05:19:13.469
So it is still something that we are working on, but you are correct.

05:19:13.529 --> 05:19:15.455
I have not provided it to the board yet.

05:19:16.348 --> 05:19:19.110
Okay, and I wasn't bringing it up to say I got you.

05:19:19.130 --> 05:19:23.513
I just want to, you know, that's something I've been continued asking about and it is a concern.

05:19:23.933 --> 05:19:43.906
I do want to take, having said that because that did seem like a ding, I do want to make sure I also compliment though the technicians and the technical staff from Smarter Balanced because they've met with me personally and with a lot of stakeholders to look at the current guidance they wrote and they have redrafted the guidance to give more clarity to districts about

05:19:44.306 --> 05:19:59.131
the intent of the use of the accessibility tools and clarifying that just because a student used any of those accessibility tools, it doesn't change the status of how information about that student's performance is going to change or be reported in a different way.

05:19:59.231 --> 05:20:06.694
So we can learn a lot about how that guidance was developed in creating this guidance also for the LPAC.

05:20:06.994 --> 05:20:07.254
Thank you.

05:20:08.234 --> 05:20:09.155
So thank you, Michelle.

05:20:10.396 --> 05:20:12.337
Do you have a few more things?

05:20:13.157 --> 05:20:13.418
Right?

05:20:13.798 --> 05:20:14.198
I do.

05:20:14.218 --> 05:20:14.618
I know.

05:20:14.738 --> 05:20:15.919
And then we'll do the recommendation.

05:20:15.939 --> 05:20:17.340
I do have a few more things.

05:20:17.420 --> 05:20:17.700
Okay.

05:20:17.800 --> 05:20:18.060
Go ahead.

05:20:18.961 --> 05:20:19.241
Okay.

05:20:19.962 --> 05:20:24.825
So I'm excited to report that we held our first California assessment conference.

05:20:24.925 --> 05:20:28.227
It was designed for our classroom educators in California.

05:20:28.247 --> 05:20:33.130
I'm going to play a short video in a moment, but I want to share some details first.

05:20:34.673 --> 05:20:39.354
So highlights from the conference include an opening keynote from Rosie Reed.

05:20:39.574 --> 05:20:42.155
She's the 2019 California Teacher of the Year.

05:20:42.895 --> 05:20:47.276
She spoke about her use of standardized test data to monitor her student progress.

05:20:48.216 --> 05:20:53.217
We had a panel discussion from our contest finalists from Sciences Elementary.

05:20:53.837 --> 05:21:01.119
They shared their use of formative assessment tools to engage students in the study of science phenomena in elementary grades.

05:21:02.159 --> 05:21:17.589
We had a keynote address from renowned literacy scholar, Dr. Doug Fisher, who explained the importance of assessment-capable students and shared examples of students clearly in charge of their own learning.

05:21:18.670 --> 05:21:25.274
Of course, the conference also held many other sessions on using assessments to support our student learning.

05:21:26.823 --> 05:21:33.891
The evaluation survey is still out because we just had this conference, but we've already heard very positive feedback.

05:21:34.372 --> 05:21:39.959
So we've already started planning for year two of the conference, which will be held in Riverside.

05:21:40.720 --> 05:21:45.826
So let me, I get to toot my horn a little bit and.

05:22:01.744 --> 05:22:10.134
It's great to see some schools really share how they've gone far in this journey, really collecting data, looking at students' work.

05:22:10.875 --> 05:22:16.682
We've been able to see some best practices, and we hope to take this back to our district and help our students learn.

05:22:20.018 --> 05:22:25.162
And I'm learning the most at this conference from colleagues at other schools.

05:22:25.282 --> 05:22:38.954
Teacher leaders this morning really opened my mind to how to integrate these tools authentically into classroom instruction so they are the most useful for teachers and the most authentic for students.

05:22:42.925 --> 05:23:07.101
I think absolutely as a participant it was great to listen to the conversations that were generated based on the presentations, the aha moments from educators and recognizing how they can incorporate this learning into their daily practice to make the whole learning process more meaningful so that when the assessment piece comes into play it is just part of their norm.

05:23:07.481 --> 05:23:15.548
part of what students are used to for their expectations and they're really addressing how to remove barriers for kids.

05:23:19.011 --> 05:23:35.087
And one of the great things about this conference is the focus was on how do we actually use the resources that have been made available in the Smarter Balance system and from CDE to really support teachers in the classroom, to make a difference for teachers and students.

05:23:35.387 --> 05:23:38.711
Because ultimately that's what it's about, helping students achieve and succeed.

05:23:49.123 --> 05:23:53.467
Those were our science teachers, I think.

05:23:53.527 --> 05:23:56.430
They were very excited contest winners.

05:23:56.510 --> 05:24:06.538
We did have some donations that allowed us to provide each of our science contest winners with $1,000 each.

05:24:07.039 --> 05:24:08.040
They were very happy.

05:24:08.080 --> 05:24:09.601
There may have been tears, even.

05:24:11.943 --> 05:24:15.326
It was sad, but I was happy that we were able to acknowledge them.

05:24:15.346 --> 05:24:22.471
But what was sad is they felt like, as elementary school teachers, they don't get recognized for their content knowledge very often.

05:24:22.591 --> 05:24:27.675
And so to be recognized for science was very meaningful for them.

05:24:29.286 --> 05:24:31.769
So next, I'm going to invite up one of my staff.

05:24:31.809 --> 05:24:36.995
My staff don't get to come up and share with you their great work very often.

05:24:37.256 --> 05:24:39.518
And Patricia's already excited.

05:24:39.558 --> 05:24:40.339
I can see that.

05:24:40.960 --> 05:24:46.527
So the new web tool released by Smarter Balanced is called the Smarter Content Explorer.

05:24:47.496 --> 05:24:52.659
No one knows it better than Member Rucker, because she was up until 3 a.m.

05:24:52.679 --> 05:24:53.260
looking at it.

05:24:53.960 --> 05:25:08.349
So this tool helps educators to better understand the expectations of students on the Smarter Balanced summative and interim assessments, and really to bridge the gap between the language of the test developers and the language that teachers use in the classroom every single day.

05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:15.374
It combines the information in the Smarter Balanced content and item specifications, which are incredibly lengthy documents,

05:25:16.710 --> 05:25:27.283
and dull, OK, but very important documents, which are key resources that our test and item development experts have used.

05:25:28.004 --> 05:25:32.088
And it does this to create an easy to use search interface for our classroom teachers.

05:25:32.469 --> 05:25:32.829
So now.

05:25:35.538 --> 05:25:39.961
Yes, we did this because member Recker asked us to do this.

05:25:40.622 --> 05:25:43.424
So now I want to bring up Rebecca Bauer.

05:25:43.464 --> 05:25:46.166
She's an education programs consultant in my division.

05:25:46.766 --> 05:25:51.910
And she's going to go ahead and actually demo the site.

05:25:54.532 --> 05:25:55.812
And that is not the site.

05:25:57.133 --> 05:25:57.594
There you go.

05:25:58.815 --> 05:25:59.175
Thank you.

05:26:01.750 --> 05:26:02.431
Good afternoon.

05:26:03.872 --> 05:26:07.455
I'm here, like Michelle said, to share this wonderful resource that we have.

05:26:07.595 --> 05:26:13.319
I'm Rebecca Bowers, and I'm an Education Programs Consultant in the Assessment Development and Administration Division.

05:26:14.140 --> 05:26:18.744
And prior to coming to the CDE, I was in the classroom as a classroom teacher for 10 years.

05:26:19.404 --> 05:26:24.228
I was an English Language Arts, or ELA, teacher, primarily at the middle school level.

05:26:24.288 --> 05:26:26.310
So eighth graders, I couldn't get enough of them, I guess.

05:26:27.911 --> 05:26:38.526
So, as a teacher, I know I went through, you know, I administered the CSTs and then I administered the SBAC or Smarter Balanced assessments, and I've seen the changes.

05:26:38.586 --> 05:26:44.474
I was also department chair, lead teacher, and I worked with teachers on how to use these resources.

05:26:45.416 --> 05:26:50.901
And so a lot of times you're given resources, but they're like, you know, the item and content specifications.

05:26:50.961 --> 05:26:52.082
What do teachers do with them?

05:26:52.162 --> 05:26:53.303
How do they access them?

05:26:54.184 --> 05:27:01.912
And, you know, you're downloading zip files that are crazy and, like Michelle said, very lengthy and technical.

05:27:02.872 --> 05:27:09.359
So I'm very excited about this application, which I did work on with Smarter Balanced and their member states.

05:27:10.320 --> 05:27:22.173
And so as you can see here, this is the landing page, and basically it really does help bridge the gap between the language of test developers and the language used in the classroom, whether it be by teachers or even by students.

05:27:22.874 --> 05:27:24.115
So I'll start with...

05:27:25.997 --> 05:27:38.626
Let's see, so on the landing page, you can see you have a nice welcome screen, and then also you can dive in and start filtering by the grade level, subject area, claim, and even target and standard.

05:27:38.766 --> 05:27:50.334
So if teachers are not familiar with targets, and they're more familiar with Common Core State Standards, which is something I was more familiar with, this definitely helps bridge that gap.

05:27:51.335 --> 05:27:54.096
And so as you can see here, this is the Explore tool.

05:27:54.316 --> 05:28:03.179
They also have the Search tool, which I'll show you here, which you can actually type in a topic and then start filtering that way.

05:28:04.139 --> 05:28:18.564
The Test Development page is very lengthy, but it has a lot of things like blueprints, scoring guidelines, construct relevant vocabulary, a lot of tools or documents that are spread throughout the SmarterBalanced.org site.

05:28:20.605 --> 05:28:28.091
But the two primary features that I'm going to share with you are the explore feature and then the search feature here.

05:28:28.751 --> 05:28:31.553
So we can get to the explore feature in two different ways.

05:28:32.234 --> 05:28:37.037
One is up here on the top and one is right in front of us, right here on the landing page.

05:28:37.318 --> 05:28:40.700
And since I was an ELA teacher, I'm going to search for ELA.

05:28:41.561 --> 05:28:42.802
But I'll start with grade six.

05:28:44.685 --> 05:28:51.489
and scroll down, select a subject, ELA, and the claim.

05:28:51.509 --> 05:28:57.773
I'm going to choose Claim 4, which is Researcher Inquiry, because it'll give us the most options here.

05:28:58.714 --> 05:29:08.660
And if teachers are not, uh-oh, if teachers are not familiar with what a claim is or a target is, they have these information icons throughout the website.

05:29:08.720 --> 05:29:14.104
So they can click on the claim, and it pulls up the math and ELA claims right there for them.

05:29:15.560 --> 05:29:18.302
The same is true, yes, I'm excited about that.

05:29:18.922 --> 05:29:20.703
The same is true for target and standards.

05:29:20.723 --> 05:29:31.050
So if you were like me and more comfortable with standards, you can click and easily select your standards here, which teachers do actually know what all these standards are.

05:29:31.710 --> 05:29:41.617
But if you want to start challenging yourself and thinking about the test developers and start reading all these documents that have been available to teachers, you can select a target.

05:29:42.398 --> 05:29:43.559
And I'll select Target 2.

05:29:44.119 --> 05:29:46.081
And the related standards pop up below.

05:29:46.141 --> 05:29:48.082
So again, you're starting to bridge that gap.

05:29:48.202 --> 05:29:52.766
And it does it for if you select two targets, et cetera.

05:29:52.886 --> 05:29:57.049
But I'm going to focus on Target 2 and click Results.

05:29:59.093 --> 05:30:01.174
And then you get this nice resource card here.

05:30:01.374 --> 05:30:04.256
And so the resource card has everything that we preselected.

05:30:05.296 --> 05:30:06.617
And then I'll click More.

05:30:07.978 --> 05:30:14.982
And since this is basically filtered for the content I've selected, you'll see the resource card on the right.

05:30:15.082 --> 05:30:19.785
And then on the left, it'll have Target 2, Target 4, 2, 3, and 4.

05:30:20.025 --> 05:30:22.046
So you start seeing that progression on the left.

05:30:22.606 --> 05:30:38.912
Also, for teachers that are selecting materials that may be on a topic they're studying in class, if they want to understand or choose stimuli that is more relevant to something they're teaching, it does give explanations about what types of stimuli to select as well.

05:30:40.996 --> 05:30:44.158
One of the key features that I really like is the sample items button.

05:30:44.658 --> 05:30:52.923
And so instead of pulling up the sample items website on the SmarterBalanced.org site and filtering all this content, it's already filtered for you.

05:30:53.223 --> 05:30:56.105
So if I click on sample items, we jump out.

05:30:56.245 --> 05:30:59.026
It pulls it up in a new browser or a new page.

05:30:59.587 --> 05:31:07.371
So if you're like me and you exit out and then you lose your site, you have to remember the millions of sites you're looking at, it doesn't do that.

05:31:07.451 --> 05:31:08.452
So it's on a new window.

05:31:09.292 --> 05:31:13.235
And it's already pre-filtered for you with everything we've selected.

05:31:13.996 --> 05:31:20.921
And when you select the card, it goes right into that test item from the sample items website.

05:31:21.361 --> 05:31:24.183
So this is great because you can pull it up, show it to the class.

05:31:25.344 --> 05:31:30.307
Maybe students aren't familiar with why does this word have dots above and below?

05:31:31.268 --> 05:31:34.451
Well, that is an item that has the glossary term there for you.

05:31:35.751 --> 05:31:46.515
Also, I had students, I remember with the transition to the Smarter Balanced assessments, I remember they were hovering over and not quite sure, why is this highlighting and why is it not?

05:31:47.355 --> 05:31:48.796
This is great practice for them.

05:31:48.816 --> 05:31:52.817
And we have many resources that do this, but again, this is right here, easy to access.

05:31:54.517 --> 05:31:55.898
And if I exit out of that.

05:31:57.774 --> 05:32:04.759
If I scroll down, you'll see that the hover text or the hover bar above will stay with you as you scroll down the page.

05:32:05.360 --> 05:32:08.282
And basically it organizes everything that you're gonna see.

05:32:08.422 --> 05:32:10.403
So the overview is at the top.

05:32:11.124 --> 05:32:13.826
We have all the standards that are associated there.

05:32:14.967 --> 05:32:22.552
The depth of knowledge levels, and since this is a research, since we looked at claim four, it's gonna have many different depth of knowledge levels listed.

05:32:23.593 --> 05:32:28.119
Evidence required is one of my favorites because what are students expected to do?

05:32:28.239 --> 05:32:30.201
I want it plain and simple as a teacher.

05:32:30.582 --> 05:32:35.928
Well here they're expected to analyze information, integrate it while avoiding plagiarism.

05:32:36.068 --> 05:32:38.912
So I'm not boggled down with all these different documents.

05:32:39.052 --> 05:32:40.373
It's very short and sweet.

05:32:41.584 --> 05:32:47.446
The accessibility is great as well because it's catered to that specific criteria that we filtered.

05:32:48.027 --> 05:32:58.691
So as you can see here, items that are students with physical impairments, they may need to use an adapted mouse for these types of items or a computer with eye scanning capabilities.

05:32:58.771 --> 05:33:01.212
So again, you don't have to go through all those documents.

05:33:01.372 --> 05:33:02.313
It's right here for you.

05:33:03.193 --> 05:33:09.976
If you do wanna go through those documents though, you can click more and you'll be taken to the Smarter Balanced website where they're all housed there as well.

05:33:11.567 --> 05:33:24.434
The stimuli here, again, if teachers want to select different types of passages, it gives you guidelines such as no more than 225 words at the middle school grade level, could be a diary entry, and so forth.

05:33:25.836 --> 05:33:28.498
Task models are something that's also very powerful.

05:33:29.899 --> 05:33:37.465
If you want to know what does it take to write an item that is filtered in this way, then there are four different examples for you here.

05:33:38.646 --> 05:33:46.792
And if I scroll down, you can see the different alignment, how do test developers create distractors and rationales, the rationale for them.

05:33:47.593 --> 05:33:49.875
And then this is one of my favorite, are the item stems.

05:33:49.915 --> 05:33:52.757
So how is this type of question asked on the assessment?

05:33:52.797 --> 05:33:54.338
They give you an item stem right here.

05:33:55.319 --> 05:34:00.122
And there's one for that one, but if you go on task model, any of the others, I'll choose seven.

05:34:01.483 --> 05:34:04.625
Scroll down and you have four item stems right there.

05:34:04.725 --> 05:34:06.987
So again, it's very easy to access and filter.

05:34:09.062 --> 05:34:12.663
And if I scroll back to the top, another great function, and this is new.

05:34:13.583 --> 05:34:19.204
This function was just added a couple weeks ago, and this whole resource was just released two months ago.

05:34:20.064 --> 05:34:28.646
Then I can click on the download PDF functionality, and I can actually create a customized report based on all of this material that I've selected.

05:34:29.206 --> 05:34:30.907
So if I don't want to know

05:34:32.067 --> 05:34:39.535
Maybe the depth of knowledge, I'm already familiar with that, but I'm really interested in sharing with my PLC the Task Model 4.

05:34:39.595 --> 05:34:45.061
I can select that and it'll generate and download a customized PDF for that right away.

05:34:46.942 --> 05:34:48.804
The other functionality I was going to share is the

05:34:50.794 --> 05:34:53.176
search functionality and this is great.

05:34:53.196 --> 05:34:57.340
It looks like I've searched on this computer before because I usually search for theme.

05:34:57.520 --> 05:35:00.082
Theme is something I taught a lot as an 8th grade ELA teacher.

05:35:00.102 --> 05:35:06.809
If I click on theme and search, you can see there are 12 results now because it's not

05:35:07.409 --> 05:35:09.272
catered to the specific grade level.

05:35:09.312 --> 05:35:16.022
Now I'm searching all grade levels for theme, and as I scroll down you'll see there's two cards for four, grade five, etc.

05:35:16.483 --> 05:35:21.330
So you can go to your grade level, choose the card, and you'll be confronted with all that information as well.

05:35:22.904 --> 05:35:25.706
And just because I love this resource, I'm going to try to keep it short.

05:35:26.206 --> 05:35:31.389
But if I go to test development, there are many other resources that are here.

05:35:31.890 --> 05:35:36.353
So again, the primary focus is those, you know, dive in and search for that content.

05:35:37.053 --> 05:35:46.819
However, as a teacher, I really want to know where are the blueprints, you know, where am I going to find all this stuff, the CDE site, you know, CASP.org or Smarter Balanced.

05:35:46.879 --> 05:35:47.840
Well, again, it's all here.

05:35:48.400 --> 05:35:54.383
So I have blueprints, interim assessment information for the blueprints, and the overview document, one of my favorites.

05:35:56.344 --> 05:36:00.786
Bias and sensitivity, because test developers think about all this when creating items.

05:36:02.087 --> 05:36:03.308
And as a teacher, I want to know.

05:36:03.428 --> 05:36:04.808
I want to know what's going into it.

05:36:04.888 --> 05:36:08.030
I have rubrics, which was my go-to all the time.

05:36:08.230 --> 05:36:09.931
Construct relevant vocabulary.

05:36:10.091 --> 05:36:13.172
Are they saying central idea or main idea?

05:36:13.192 --> 05:36:15.714
What type of terminology is used, et cetera.

05:36:16.454 --> 05:36:18.656
Content specifications are all there as well.

05:36:19.917 --> 05:36:23.339
And the last bit of information is the support.

05:36:23.920 --> 05:36:29.584
If I'm a teacher and I don't know what a task model is, they have that information provided here.

05:36:30.165 --> 05:36:35.669
So then, again, that helps bridge that gap between the languages test developers and the language used in the classroom.

05:36:36.269 --> 05:36:40.152
So if I were still in the classroom, this is definitely something I would have used.

05:36:41.113 --> 05:36:42.094
So thank you very much.

05:36:42.974 --> 05:36:45.076
And are there any clarifying questions?

05:36:48.744 --> 05:36:59.171
So I am so lucky to have staff like Becky, as well as so many other staff in my division, many of which were classroom teachers.

05:36:59.991 --> 05:37:01.512
So that's important to know.

05:37:01.552 --> 05:37:16.762
Yes, we reach out to classroom teachers all the time in our work, but we are also lucky to have so many in-house teachers that help us really think about things from that perspective when we're looking at our development.

05:37:17.762 --> 05:37:24.487
So I do want to go back to the slides.

05:37:24.987 --> 05:37:29.650
I was going to pause here for any questions, but that is the last pause and the last topic.

05:37:30.871 --> 05:37:34.013
And then I'm going to put up your motion so you can have it on the screen.

05:37:37.895 --> 05:37:39.416
So any questions?

05:37:45.373 --> 05:37:53.358
So the Content Explorer application that you just shared with us is live on the Smarter Balanced website or on the CDE website?

05:37:56.720 --> 05:38:03.325
It's on the Smarter Balanced website and on the CDE site, and it's on our Smarter Balanced resources webpage.

05:38:04.425 --> 05:38:05.806
So it's kind of buried a little bit.

05:38:05.966 --> 05:38:10.509
That's the reason why I asked the question, because I went looking for it.

05:38:10.789 --> 05:38:11.630
I'm hooked on it now.

05:38:12.050 --> 05:38:12.831
Couldn't find it.

05:38:13.491 --> 05:38:20.493
So if there's a way, you know, most students, you know, they get bored looking for things if it takes more than three clicks.

05:38:21.393 --> 05:38:30.096
Teachers have, don't have as much time to use even three clicks if there's a way to make it more prominently displayed both on the Smarter Balanced website.

05:38:30.677 --> 05:38:36.323
and on the department website, even if it's featured as one of your pop-ups on your landing page.

05:38:36.704 --> 05:38:43.412
I think that that would be important because this is an important new resource that teachers really do need to have.

05:38:43.772 --> 05:38:49.259
When Michelle sent me the preview and she told me I could share it with a lot of educators,

05:38:49.779 --> 05:38:55.081
you know, when you took down that little preview, now they're, you know, bugging me like on the hour.

05:38:55.221 --> 05:38:55.721
Where is it?

05:38:55.761 --> 05:38:56.282
Where is it?

05:38:56.302 --> 05:38:57.562
It's like they're hooked on crack.

05:38:58.162 --> 05:38:59.843
So, it would be nice.

05:38:59.923 --> 05:39:03.965
Yeah, it would be nice to be able to tell them how to find it in an easy way.

05:39:03.985 --> 05:39:10.927
And that makes me think that Member Rucker is not following our Twitter feed, but besides that.

05:39:12.488 --> 05:39:13.028
Yeah.

05:39:18.576 --> 05:39:19.817
So that's a good point.

05:39:19.837 --> 05:39:20.538
We'll take that back.

05:39:20.598 --> 05:39:27.363
I also think it would be good for us to work with ETS, because many of our educators, I know it's hard to believe, don't go to the department's website.

05:39:27.383 --> 05:39:28.984
They actually go to the ETS website.

05:39:29.465 --> 05:39:31.867
So we'll go ahead and make sure we have a link from there also.

05:39:33.528 --> 05:39:34.149
Ortiz-Lacon?

05:39:36.070 --> 05:39:38.812
So I send this to my husband right away.

05:39:38.832 --> 05:39:40.934
And I tell him, Christmas came early.

05:39:44.898 --> 05:39:45.438
Yes.

05:39:46.498 --> 05:39:50.199
And I know that why I have the California standards on an app.

05:39:50.699 --> 05:39:51.039
I don't know.

05:39:51.099 --> 05:39:52.900
I don't teach, but it's there.

05:39:53.440 --> 05:39:55.880
And I also have the data dashboard.

05:39:56.020 --> 05:39:58.221
Is this going to become an app as well?

05:39:58.941 --> 05:40:01.521
Just so that I could absorb all my storage space?

05:40:02.181 --> 05:40:02.662
Yes.

05:40:02.822 --> 05:40:03.262
We will.

05:40:04.522 --> 05:40:09.023
So just to be clear, this was developed by the consortium.

05:40:09.063 --> 05:40:11.203
So this is not an ETS product.

05:40:11.243 --> 05:40:14.624
But I'm happy to take that feedback back to them.

05:40:19.212 --> 05:40:41.547
there any more board questions or clarifications it's just so funny because I also just shared link with people at my school so so we have a recommendation from the CD staff now that was the that's part of this item I believe we have some public comments am i right

05:40:44.525 --> 05:40:49.674
We have two people for public comment, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and Cameron King.

05:40:49.774 --> 05:40:50.335
Please line up.

05:40:57.210 --> 05:41:04.052
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

05:41:04.752 --> 05:41:06.992
My comments are specific to the LPAC.

05:41:07.292 --> 05:41:19.275
We greatly appreciate the two studies being conducted on the computer-based LPAC administration and we also appreciate the steps taken by CDE to involve educators

05:41:19.895 --> 05:41:29.100
on the LPAC transition review panel to review the results of the comparability study and LPAC items used in the mode comparability study.

05:41:29.700 --> 05:41:38.845
We look forward to being able to discuss the results and implications of these studies as well as the results of the comparability study with CDE staff.

05:41:39.565 --> 05:41:55.501
Lastly, I appreciate the interest expressed by some of the state board members on the use of accessibility tools by our students because it is important to know the extent as to whether they are being used or not being used by our students.

05:41:55.982 --> 05:41:56.282
Thank you.

05:42:01.363 --> 05:42:04.944
Good afternoon, Cameron King with the California Science Teachers Association.

05:42:04.964 --> 05:42:28.854
I just wanted to take this opportunity to publicly reiterate our comments that were submitted previously and express our appreciation to the State Board and to CDE for your commitment to science education, high quality science education, and to the assessment staff for their commitment to incorporating educators in the process of evaluating and implementing these assessment tools.

05:42:29.494 --> 05:42:45.909
We stand ready to continue to be partners and collaborators with CDE and with the department staff, as well as with each and every one of you, as we continue to implement the California NGSS standards, assess those, and evaluate the amendments that may need to be made accordingly.

05:42:46.369 --> 05:42:50.213
So thank you so much for the opportunity and your commitment to science education in the state.

05:42:52.424 --> 05:42:53.425
Thank you for our comments.

05:42:53.685 --> 05:42:54.726
So we'll come back now.

05:42:55.786 --> 05:43:05.573
We have a recommendation to approve the proposed CAS threshold scores beginning with 18-19 administration as shown in the attachment to this item.

05:43:05.633 --> 05:43:07.574
So do I have a motion?

05:43:07.795 --> 05:43:09.596
I would move the staff's recommendation.

05:43:09.816 --> 05:43:10.556
Do I have a second?

05:43:12.458 --> 05:43:14.219
Felicia Ortiz-Lacon, second.

05:43:15.019 --> 05:43:17.081
Any discussion or comments on the item?

05:43:18.815 --> 05:43:21.459
So all those in favor, say aye.

05:43:21.479 --> 05:43:22.340
Raise your hand.

05:43:22.920 --> 05:43:23.862
Any opposed?

05:43:24.683 --> 05:43:25.664
Any abstentions?

05:43:25.684 --> 05:43:28.027
Okay, that was passed unanimously.

05:43:28.047 --> 05:43:28.768
Thank you.

05:43:29.509 --> 05:43:33.995
Okay, so now we will move to item number seven.

05:43:36.328 --> 05:43:41.009
Thank you so much for getting us through all the items in between.

05:43:42.250 --> 05:43:44.250
Item 7 is, guess what?

05:43:44.670 --> 05:43:45.991
Another assessment item.

05:43:46.631 --> 05:43:53.192
By the way, I just thought it was delightful to see all those teachers so happy about assessment.

05:43:53.372 --> 05:43:54.113
I know!

05:43:55.013 --> 05:43:58.854
I tell people that I strive to make assessment fun and they laugh at me.

05:43:59.534 --> 05:44:00.875
But we truly do.

05:44:00.895 --> 05:44:02.755
We're laughing with you.

05:44:02.775 --> 05:44:07.177
Assessment stuff is another assessment item.

05:44:07.197 --> 05:44:12.839
We're getting the release of up to 10% withheld for the 2018-19 regions of the University of California contract.

05:44:13.319 --> 05:44:13.739
Take it away.

05:44:14.858 --> 05:44:17.501
So the item before you is an action item.

05:44:18.602 --> 05:44:20.103
I do not have a PowerPoint with this.

05:44:20.143 --> 05:44:21.885
You just have to look at me, so sorry.

05:44:23.026 --> 05:44:27.931
But the CDE asked the board to release the full amount of $13,769.26 of funds withheld from the UC Santa Cruz regents contract.

05:44:35.859 --> 05:44:40.281
There were no contract deficiency that would warrant any withholding of funds.

05:44:41.241 --> 05:44:52.685
So as a short little bit of background on this item, because this is the first time I've ever come to this board with a 10% release item for UC Santa Cruz.

05:44:52.805 --> 05:45:00.688
You are all familiar with the fact that I come every year with a similar item for ETS, but not for UC Santa Cruz.

05:45:01.628 --> 05:45:05.370
So the contract with UC Santa Cruz includes two components.

05:45:06.050 --> 05:45:09.072
The first component is the Smarter Balanced membership fees.

05:45:09.932 --> 05:45:22.179
The Smarter Balanced membership fee portion of the contract is not subject to the 10% withhold and release that is a normal part of what you see for our assessment vendor contract.

05:45:23.308 --> 05:45:35.921
But the second component within that same contract is the expansion and customization of the California Educator Reporting System, also known as CSRS.

05:45:35.941 --> 05:45:45.772
CSRS is not being paid for out of our membership fees, except for the CSRS component specific to Smarter Balanced.

05:45:49.770 --> 05:45:59.036
So SIRS will eventually include summative and alternate English language proficiency assessments for California or LPAC.

05:45:59.976 --> 05:46:08.341
It will also include Smarter Balanced assessments as well as the non-Smarter Balanced CASP assessments.

05:46:08.781 --> 05:46:16.486
So those include our science test, our Spanish assessment, our alternate assessments in English language arts, math and science.

05:46:17.867 --> 05:46:31.220
So eventually, over time, SURGE will allow educators to view student results from CASP, from LPAC, in a single one-stop shop for them to see results.

05:46:31.880 --> 05:46:36.004
So it is the development of SURGE within the contract that is subject to the 10% withhold.

05:46:38.246 --> 05:46:53.831
In order to engage in this expansion and pay for this project, you may recall that when this board actually acted on this contract to customize and add CSRS,

05:46:55.399 --> 05:47:04.366
We used a one-time credit of $390,000 that we had in order to pay for some of the work in year one.

05:47:04.426 --> 05:47:20.037
So that is why you see these costs slightly lower than what you would think it would cost us to do this work is because we had a one-time credit because there was an increase in consortium membership revenue that allowed us to have a one-time credit in year 18-19.

05:47:22.273 --> 05:47:27.475
So the credits were used to offset the year one costs, which was a planned use of those funds.

05:47:28.956 --> 05:47:32.878
That one-time membership credit is not a permanent reduction.

05:47:33.598 --> 05:47:38.700
So we are paying for the expansion of CSRS for the rest of the years.

05:47:38.760 --> 05:47:45.023
You may recall we actually cut some money out of our other contract in order to put it into the UC Santa Cruz contract to pay for this.

05:47:46.023 --> 05:47:49.425
So in this contract, only tasks one, two, and four are subject to the 10% withhold.

05:47:51.938 --> 05:47:55.943
One includes activities for the development of SERS for summative and alternate LPAC.

05:47:56.603 --> 05:48:01.809
Task two includes activities for the development of SERS for CASP that are not Smarter Balanced.

05:48:02.810 --> 05:48:10.778
And task four are all the other activities related to contract oversight, management meetings, schedules, communications, and that type of work.

05:48:11.839 --> 05:48:28.086
So in summary, I'm asking that this board approved that the funds be released for the UC Santa Cruz Regents Contract for work that has been completed to our satisfaction Okay Tingson our assessment liaison.

05:48:28.106 --> 05:48:30.107
Do you have any comments on this item?

05:48:30.587 --> 05:48:34.969
No, I think we've heard about this item a little bit before in the past as well.

05:48:35.069 --> 05:48:39.011
And this is Pretty standard I think at this point.

05:48:39.171 --> 05:48:39.391
Yeah, I

05:48:39.912 --> 05:48:40.192
Great.

05:48:40.372 --> 05:48:43.055
And is there any clarifying questions?

05:48:43.555 --> 05:48:45.597
It's a pretty clear presentation.

05:48:45.717 --> 05:48:46.677
Any public comment?

05:48:47.878 --> 05:48:48.379
All right.

05:48:48.519 --> 05:48:52.262
Hearing none, do I have a motion?

05:48:52.822 --> 05:48:53.583
I'll move the item.

05:48:54.158 --> 05:49:11.264
thank you second thank you any further discussion all right all those in favor say aye any opposed nay any abstentions motion carries thank you Michelle you get to sit down we appreciate you

05:49:12.405 --> 05:49:29.222
We're moving on you guys have wonderful stamina and we're just going to keep plowing ahead Item 8 is the public hearing regarding the bay point preparatory academy san diego We have a consideration of a material revision of the charter to change admission preferences

05:49:30.323 --> 05:49:55.248
The CDE recommends and proposes to recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request for the material revision of the BPA San Diego petition to amend element 8 admission requirements for the remainder of the five-year term of July 1st 2008 through June 30th 2023 under the oversight of the SBE based on the CDE's findings.

05:49:56.968 --> 05:50:00.910
And so I'm going to let Lisa Constancio of the CDE present the item.

05:50:00.930 --> 05:50:02.151
Good afternoon.

05:50:02.171 --> 05:50:03.971
Is this one working?

05:50:04.391 --> 05:50:04.571
Yes?

05:50:04.772 --> 05:50:05.032
We're good?

05:50:05.112 --> 05:50:05.352
Okay.

05:50:05.972 --> 05:50:06.712
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:50:06.772 --> 05:50:09.573
I need to open the public hearing.

05:50:09.934 --> 05:50:10.294
Not yet.

05:50:10.494 --> 05:50:11.234
After that, okay?

05:50:11.254 --> 05:50:13.275
Yeah, you will in just a little bit.

05:50:14.275 --> 05:50:15.296
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:50:15.736 --> 05:50:21.478
Lisa Constancio with the Charter Schools Division here to present item number eight for Bay Point Preparatory Academy.

05:50:21.878 --> 05:50:23.719
This is a request for a material revision.

05:50:25.250 --> 05:50:29.593
During the term of a charter, the school may request an amendment to its current approved charter.

05:50:30.194 --> 05:50:48.187
Material revisions are governed under Education Code 47605, and what that means is that on top of looking at the request for material revision, we also look at the petition again, we take a look at their fiscal viability again, and then we also take a look at their charter elements again to make sure they're reasonably comprehensive.

05:50:48.507 --> 05:50:53.011
So we do a comprehensive look again on top of the request for material revision.

05:50:54.406 --> 05:51:02.525
Material revisions to a currently approved petition may only be with the approval of the authority and in this case with the State Board of Education that granted the charter.

05:51:04.417 --> 05:51:06.038
A little bit of background on Baypoint.

05:51:06.098 --> 05:51:11.203
Baypoint Preparatory Academy in San Diego was approved by the State Board in March of 2018.

05:51:11.823 --> 05:51:18.709
It's a TK through grade 8 school and they're approved for a five-year term from July 1, 2018 through June 30th of 2023.

05:51:18.809 --> 05:51:23.132
They're currently in their second year of operation serving 159 students.

05:51:25.394 --> 05:51:36.046
Currently at a temporary facility at the Boys and Girls Club and they are planning to move to a permanent facility in San Marcos in January of 2020 within the San Marcos Unified School District.

05:51:38.308 --> 05:51:46.052
July 29, 2019, CDE received a request for material revision from Baypoint to amend Element 8, the admission requirements.

05:51:46.652 --> 05:52:00.940
The admission preferences would need to be revised in order for the school to maintain their eligibility in the Charter School Facility Grant Program, previously known as Senate Bill 740, which is for grant and lease costs for charter schools.

05:52:01.980 --> 05:52:06.142
The grant amount we're talking about here is about $88,000 to the charter school.

05:52:07.023 --> 05:52:14.406
And if the material revision request is not approved by the board today, the school will continue to operate but without access to this grant.

05:52:14.466 --> 05:52:16.447
So they just wouldn't have access to this additional $88,000.

05:52:16.848 --> 05:52:29.274
The CDE recommendation is the state board hold a public hearing to approve the request from Bay Point San Diego for a material revision for their admission requirements.

05:52:31.311 --> 05:52:34.013
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on October 8th, 2019.

05:52:35.255 --> 05:52:39.759
The Advisory Commission moved staff recommendation to approve the request for a material revision.

05:52:40.479 --> 05:52:45.764
The motion passed unanimously by a vote of six to zero with one commissioner not in attendance.

05:52:48.171 --> 05:52:51.033
A little bit of background on the Charter School Facility Grant Program.

05:52:51.513 --> 05:52:56.998
It is administered by the California State Treasurer, the California School Finance Authority.

05:52:57.578 --> 05:53:09.106
There's currently $137 million for the fiscal year 19-20, and it provides annual reimbursement assistance with facility rent and lease expenditures to charter schools that meet the eligibility criteria.

05:53:09.947 --> 05:53:23.756
Charter schools are awarded $1,184 per unit of classroom ADA, and that is up to 75%, so it doesn't cover 100%, it covers up to 75% of their annual facility rent and lease costs for the school.

05:53:24.896 --> 05:53:33.722
And according to CSFA, the program is currently not projected to be oversubscribed for those that are applying for lease costs only, which is what Baypoint is applying for.

05:53:36.351 --> 05:53:40.396
In order to be eligible for the program, you have to have an approved charter on file.

05:53:40.877 --> 05:53:42.819
It needs to be a classroom-based school.

05:53:43.520 --> 05:53:49.327
The school must meet one of two low-income priority provisions.

05:53:49.387 --> 05:53:55.554
The first is that at least 55% of the students at the school meet the free and reduced-price meal criteria,

05:53:56.395 --> 05:54:03.039
or they're located in an attendance area of an elementary school that has at least 55% free and reduced price meals.

05:54:03.860 --> 05:54:16.868
So in order to meet the second prong here, number two, there does need to be a preference in admissions to qualify and to allow the students that are in that general area or in that local elementary school to have first priority.

05:54:17.168 --> 05:54:24.553
So that does need to be included in the admission preferences, which is why the school is before you today.

05:54:26.380 --> 05:54:34.748
Currently, they are at 48% free and reduced price meals, so they don't meet that first prong because the school itself does not have 55%.

05:54:35.369 --> 05:54:48.222
So they are requesting to come before the board for this material revision so they can qualify under the second criteria, which would be to be located in an attendance area of an elementary school that has at least the 55% free and reduced price meals.

05:54:49.645 --> 05:55:05.045
So the petition will include, and we have verified this, a preference for pupils who are currently enrolled in or who reside in the elementary school district, in this case it's San Marcos Unified, of the public elementary school, San Marcos Elementary School, in which Bay Point is located.

05:55:07.378 --> 05:55:11.599
As I mentioned earlier, as part of the material revision, CDE does do a full review.

05:55:11.659 --> 05:55:13.360
We've taken a look at the petition again.

05:55:13.680 --> 05:55:24.644
Even though it only been about a year and a half, we take a look at the educational program, we take a look at their multi-year budget for their fiscal viability, and then we look again at the charter elements that are in the petition.

05:55:26.932 --> 05:55:35.238
Based on our review, the projected budget indicates that the school is projected to have a positive ending fund balance of about $276,000.

05:55:35.898 --> 05:55:37.760
They are over their reserves right now.

05:55:37.860 --> 05:55:41.843
Currently, we recommend a 5% reserve in our MOU with them.

05:55:42.703 --> 05:55:47.046
They do also have positive ending fund balances out for the next two fiscal years as well.

05:55:48.147 --> 05:55:56.272
Now, the monthly rent for the new facility is going up from $6,600 a month, which is what they're paying now at the Boys and Girls Club, to $31,000 a month.

05:55:56.292 --> 05:56:00.995
So it is going up from $6,600 a month for the Boys and Girls Club to $31,000 a month with this new facility.

05:56:01.055 --> 05:56:02.096
Facilities are expensive.

05:56:16.673 --> 05:56:17.834
Yeah, $31,000 a month.

05:56:18.394 --> 05:56:30.159
So over a nine-month period, the cost to lease the facility, the new facility, is about $279,000 compared to about $59,000 that they're paying now with the Boys and Girls Club.

05:56:30.559 --> 05:56:34.641
So this grant would substantially help them with those additional facility costs.

05:56:37.293 --> 05:56:48.223
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval of the material revision in order to allow the school to meet the eligibility criteria for this grant and allow them to revise their admission preferences.

05:56:48.463 --> 05:56:58.632
And again, we did a re-review of each of their elements to ensure their fiscal viability, their educational program, and their comprehensive description of their charter elements.

05:56:59.812 --> 05:57:00.713
So that's all I have.

05:57:00.733 --> 05:57:03.655
Are there any questions I can answer for you at this time?

05:57:04.856 --> 05:57:07.838
The school is here also and will be giving their presentation as well.

05:57:08.639 --> 05:57:10.240
Now we want to open the public hearing.

05:57:10.480 --> 05:57:10.640
Yes.

05:57:25.984 --> 05:57:39.349
how they meet all the other criteria and how they don't meet the specific criteria about the current enrollment and you explain that the purpose of the hearing is to approve this material revision on their enrollment criteria.

05:57:39.790 --> 05:57:52.615
The one thing that you didn't, I didn't hear in your analysis is whether or not this material revision will actually result in a net increase in the number of low-income students that actually enroll

05:57:53.335 --> 05:57:54.336
at the charter school.

05:57:54.396 --> 05:57:58.418
So I want to understand why I didn't hear that in your analysis.

05:57:58.738 --> 05:58:03.240
And again, if that's not a question I should be asking now, I'm willing to wait for that answer till later.

05:58:03.921 --> 05:58:11.405
I think it would be good to hear the presentation from the school and then if we still have the question, we can talk more after that.

05:58:13.612 --> 05:58:16.373
So I hereby open the public hearing at 3 10 p.m.

05:58:16.874 --> 05:58:38.865
First we'll hear from the petitioners the petitioners have 10 minutes then we'll hear from the county or districts that are opposing the material revision they will also have a total of 10 minutes after the presentations from both sides then there will be a opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each so the petitioner

05:58:54.224 --> 05:58:56.368
Good afternoon board members and CDE staff.

05:58:56.809 --> 05:59:02.239
My name is Nancy Spencer and I'm the executive director for Bay Point Preparatory Academy in San Diego.

05:59:02.918 --> 05:59:12.460
I want to thank you for the opportunity to present on behalf of Bay Point San Diego's petition for the material revision, specifically element 8, admissions requirements.

05:59:13.381 --> 05:59:22.803
As presented by the CDE staff, in 2018 the California School Finance Authority changed the requirements for qualifying for the SB 740 facility funds.

05:59:23.403 --> 05:59:31.025
In order to receive these funds, CSFA required element 8 of the petition to include specific lottery language and guidelines.

05:59:31.789 --> 05:59:40.197
Because Bay Point San Diego's petition was written in 2017, it did not have the CSFA required language in that element.

05:59:40.978 --> 05:59:45.022
A change to that element requires a material revision based on our MOU with the State Board.

05:59:45.483 --> 05:59:52.570
We are seeking this revision in order to qualify for these reimbursements that will allow us to spend more of our funds on educating our students.

05:59:53.210 --> 05:59:55.773
I'd like to illustrate this through the next several slides.

05:59:58.260 --> 06:00:01.302
In the fall of 2017, we began our facility search.

06:00:01.762 --> 06:00:13.430
After an exhaustive search, our only option to open on time for the 2018-19 school year was to locate in a light industrial building formerly occupied by a non-classroom based charter school.

06:00:14.554 --> 06:00:23.380
The city approved this location on the condition that Bay Point San Diego only operate there for one year as well as limit the number of students enrolled.

06:00:24.200 --> 06:00:30.624
Despite the facility and city imposed challenges, we successfully completed our first year.

06:00:31.465 --> 06:00:42.252
This facility was located in the La Mirada Academy boundaries, but it did not qualify for the FRPM elementary school criteria based on CDE data.

06:00:45.717 --> 06:00:53.283
Last December, we began negotiating to lease the facility located at 520 East Carmel.

06:00:53.943 --> 06:00:58.147
In June, a lease was signed and the city's required approval process began.

06:00:58.947 --> 06:01:06.874
Because that process is not complete, we opened this school year in the San Marcos Boys and Girls Club adjacent to San Marcos Elementary School.

06:01:07.534 --> 06:01:11.057
Again, the city has limited our enrollment numbers at this location.

06:01:13.089 --> 06:01:17.234
Since our inception, our goal has been to serve the underserved students in the community.

06:01:17.634 --> 06:01:32.451
Because the Carmel site is located in the San Marcos Elementary School boundary area, which currently serves a demographic population of more than 77% FRPM students, we meet the requirements for the SB 740 facility funds.

06:01:34.349 --> 06:01:40.951
Despite our facility constraints, our FRPM has increased from 30 to 48% in just one year.

06:01:41.531 --> 06:01:46.852
Relocating into this large facility allows us to serve more students and continue the growth.

06:01:47.513 --> 06:01:55.895
Our plan, after meeting all of the city's change of use entitlement requirements, is to relocate in this permanent facility in January.

06:01:58.345 --> 06:02:07.439
This data chart details the FRPM for both Bay Point San Diego and the two elementary schools whose boundaries we have been located in.

06:02:08.996 --> 06:02:27.044
At the beginning of the school year we came close to reaching the same percentage of 49.9% that La Mirada held with our school now and our goal is to continue as you see on the blue there to continue to reach out as we now have room to expand on the two facilities.

06:02:27.484 --> 06:02:28.505
The facility on

06:02:29.705 --> 06:02:36.327
Linda Vista that we rented the first year was 9,000 square feet, and we paid 18,000 rent on it.

06:02:36.767 --> 06:02:38.788
We were able to get into the Boys and Girls Club.

06:02:38.828 --> 06:02:45.030
They gave us a deal, but they would only let us stay there, the city, for the rest of this year, and it's not large enough for expand.

06:02:45.050 --> 06:02:50.151
We were limited on the enrollment as well, and so they cut us a deal with 6,000.

06:02:50.491 --> 06:02:56.233
This new facility is 41,000 square feet, plus it has areas for playgrounds and outside activities.

06:02:56.733 --> 06:03:03.839
So it's a much large facility that will accommodate the number of students that we presented in our petition as our growth over the five years of that petition.

06:03:05.320 --> 06:03:12.146
I hope these slides have put a face to Bay Point, the students we serve, and the qualifying FRPM data.

06:03:12.886 --> 06:03:23.375
We'd like to thank Lisa Constancio and the CSD for their thorough review, their ongoing support, as well as the CDE and the ACCS recommendation for approval.

06:03:25.629 --> 06:03:29.191
So questions now or am I done and questions later?

06:03:32.192 --> 06:03:37.194
Oh, okay.

06:03:37.454 --> 06:03:39.295
I'm okay.

06:03:41.916 --> 06:03:45.137
This will make it go faster too, the meeting will be over soon.

06:03:45.397 --> 06:03:47.578
Do we have opposition presentation?

06:03:50.299 --> 06:03:50.519
Okay.

06:03:59.623 --> 06:04:02.190
We have two speakers for public comment.

06:04:03.193 --> 06:04:05.440
Angela Doramos and Katlyn O'Halloran.

06:04:18.479 --> 06:04:20.860
Catlin O'Halloran with the Charter Schools Development Center.

06:04:21.580 --> 06:04:25.942
We support the CDE's recommendation and the ACCS unanimous recommendation.

06:04:27.122 --> 06:04:41.328
We support the Bay Point Preparatory Academy's request for the material revision and we think that the $88,000 from the grant will help them with their increase in the facilities cost in particular in addition to just supporting their students and their growth.

06:04:41.548 --> 06:04:41.808
Thank you.

06:04:46.161 --> 06:04:46.381
Hi.

06:04:46.521 --> 06:04:50.002
Angela DeRamos representing California Teachers Association.

06:04:50.483 --> 06:04:54.684
We ask the state board to deny Bay Point's request for material revision.

06:04:55.265 --> 06:04:59.546
The intent of the charter facilities grant is to provide funding for low income areas.

06:04:59.966 --> 06:05:09.370
Despite being located in an area in which 80% of students are eligible for free and reduced lunch, Bay Point has been unable to recruit a student body that reflects the community in which it operates.

06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:19.003
We ask instead that the school do the hard work of engaging in meaningful outreach So that the student population of their charter actually reflects the neighborhood in which it's located.

06:05:19.363 --> 06:05:24.991
Thank you That's the end of public comment then

06:05:26.403 --> 06:05:26.784
All right.

06:05:27.805 --> 06:05:34.634
So, seeing no other public comment, I now close the public hearing for this item at 3.16 p.m.

06:05:35.094 --> 06:05:37.057
and commence with board discussion and action.

06:05:37.137 --> 06:05:41.382
And first, I'll ask Sue Burr, our liaison, if she has any initial comments.

06:05:42.433 --> 06:05:44.034
I don't think I have to add anything.

06:05:44.114 --> 06:05:46.855
I do think that I appreciate Lisa's presentation.

06:05:46.895 --> 06:05:48.835
The department did a very thorough review.

06:05:48.895 --> 06:05:50.916
I think this is fairly straightforward.

06:05:51.356 --> 06:05:56.358
It seems like the school kind of got caught in the middle of an eligibility change on CSFA.

06:05:56.398 --> 06:06:01.040
They've also had this transitional facility issue that they're trying to work out.

06:06:01.060 --> 06:06:05.441
And the ACCS was unanimous in their approval.

06:06:05.561 --> 06:06:10.083
And so when you're ready, I'm happy to move the recommendation to adopt the material revision.

06:06:10.828 --> 06:06:24.936
Okay, I'll see if the board has any clarifying questions at this point and if any of those need to be directed to the petitioner, we can invite them back to the yes, member Rucker.

06:06:26.337 --> 06:06:29.159
I'll direct my question to the petitioner that I originally asked.

06:06:29.579 --> 06:06:40.105
I'm not, I don't really understand what is your recruitment plan to improve your enrollment of the students that are the target of your adjustment, your request?

06:06:42.127 --> 06:07:04.584
As I mentioned before that we're limited in the number that we can Serve at the current Boys and Girls Club site and so we have people that are waiting to see when we're going to move into a new facility because we're pretty much maxed out there and What our plan to do then is to reach out to that area as I mentioned the Linda Vista site was in the La Mirada Academy or Alvin Dunn who's called before and

06:07:04.984 --> 06:07:28.164
Area and then we're relocating into we found a facility that we could lease And so we're moving into that which is the san marcos elementary boundaries So then our goal is to go out and reach out to the neighborhoods We've got apartment buildings that are near the the new facility site as well as neighborhoods all around there that we want to reach out but we've had to limit it just because of our constraints on the number that the city would let us have to occupy the site and

06:07:28.584 --> 06:07:34.767
And explaining in the Boys and Girls Club, I know you look at the numbers and go, wow, the difference in the price, $6,000 versus $31,000.

06:07:35.147 --> 06:07:36.848
It's a smaller facility, obviously.

06:07:36.888 --> 06:07:45.792
But the Boys and Girls Club will only let us operate during certain times in the day because they serve an after-school program for the elementary school district.

06:07:46.253 --> 06:07:49.094
So we currently have to end school an hour early.

06:07:49.474 --> 06:07:51.175
And then on Wednesdays, it's minimum day.

06:07:51.215 --> 06:07:55.277
We still have over the minimum number of minutes required for all the grade levels.

06:07:55.777 --> 06:08:04.904
But what that entails to is every day we have to set all the desks, tables, chairs out and then put them all back, put everything piled away so that the Boys and Girls Club can do their thing.

06:08:04.924 --> 06:08:13.331
And the city is graciously letting us stay there until we get all of our conditional use permit stuff in the CEQA studies and things done.

06:08:14.532 --> 06:08:16.333
So they've approved that for now.

06:08:17.814 --> 06:08:22.818
Okay, again, I appreciate all the detail that you've given me on all the other things.

06:08:23.530 --> 06:08:28.371
but I don't hear the detail about what your recruitment plan is.

06:08:28.571 --> 06:08:29.211
Oh, okay.

06:08:29.231 --> 06:08:33.872
So we mentioned we're going to go door-to-door, which we had started initially when we opened the school.

06:08:34.152 --> 06:08:38.212
We've been on social media, we've been on Facebook, we've got parents involved with us.

06:08:38.513 --> 06:08:42.493
We have an extremely active PAC Parent Advisory Committee.

06:08:42.553 --> 06:08:44.053
We're really excited about it.

06:08:44.214 --> 06:08:49.134
Four of the members have joined our board and we have others that are interested in participating in it.

06:08:49.214 --> 06:08:52.635
So using them, we've done some fundraisers in the community.

06:08:54.335 --> 06:08:58.936
It's exciting to see that the parents are behind it and supportive of the whole thing.

06:08:59.816 --> 06:09:06.718
I applaud them and appreciate what they've done because we were in a small facility that had really no playground areas.

06:09:06.758 --> 06:09:13.339
We had to use a parking lot, rope it off the first year, and then it's taken longer to get this facility approved.

06:09:13.899 --> 06:09:20.521
So now that they're sitting there and supporting us, they're still there and they still want to help and do whatever they can to reach out.

06:09:22.025 --> 06:09:30.899
Did you want to add something we have somebody so we've already demonstrated that effort in that did you tell us I'm sorry I'm Frank Aguero CEO of Bay Point Prep

06:09:32.723 --> 06:09:39.511
This year alone we increased our enrollment from 80 students to 168 students.

06:09:41.133 --> 06:09:51.465
We were able to, about 60% of those parents actually utilize the before and after school care program so we are directly serving the underserved community.

06:09:52.446 --> 06:09:57.348
And our Hispanic population and African American population have increased substantially.

06:09:57.428 --> 06:10:03.250
We went from, like was mentioned in the slide, 30 to 48% in our FRPM data.

06:10:03.730 --> 06:10:13.093
So we're directly, we have direct success in that effort and we plan to continue to do so in the new facility.

06:10:14.433 --> 06:10:18.615
We pushed very hard within two to three weeks right before the summer

06:10:19.275 --> 06:10:37.061
Target the the demographic and try and mirror the school to our community schools given that we were stuck in that initial facility in year one I'll second the motion You're ready to second the motion, okay

06:10:40.603 --> 06:10:44.685
This is just a clarifying question, I think more for Lisa.

06:10:45.085 --> 06:10:56.972
The standard isn't, is the standard that in order to qualify for the facilities grant that they need to hit 55% enrollment or just open up and offer a preference?

06:10:58.152 --> 06:11:01.894
It's procedural, it's not actually a numbers requirement.

06:11:01.935 --> 06:11:03.095
It's procedural, correct.

06:11:05.056 --> 06:11:07.257
Okay, any other clarifying questions?

06:11:08.278 --> 06:11:08.838
Member Sun?

06:11:09.939 --> 06:11:10.199
Go ahead.

06:11:11.960 --> 06:11:13.562
Then I'm ready to make it.

06:11:13.602 --> 06:11:15.824
I don't know if she did make it yet.

06:11:15.844 --> 06:11:17.085
We'll officially make it.

06:11:17.105 --> 06:11:18.987
We adopt the department's recommendation.

06:11:19.688 --> 06:11:20.568
And I'll second that.

06:11:21.129 --> 06:11:21.529
All right.

06:11:21.770 --> 06:11:22.911
Any further discussion?

06:11:23.711 --> 06:11:24.712
All in favor say aye.

06:11:25.453 --> 06:11:25.573
Aye.

06:11:25.874 --> 06:11:26.734
Any opposed nay.

06:11:27.755 --> 06:11:28.516
Any abstentions.

06:11:30.148 --> 06:11:30.488
Thank you.

06:11:31.629 --> 06:11:32.790
Thank you very much, Lisa.

06:11:32.830 --> 06:11:40.317
We are moving on to agenda item nine, and I see in my notes that we will be able to take a break after this item.

06:11:41.097 --> 06:11:41.758
Hang in there.

06:11:41.778 --> 06:11:56.631
We will now take item nine to consider the appointment of instructional materials reviewers for the 2020 Health Instructional Materials Adoption, and this item will be presented by Stephanie Gregson of CDE.

06:12:02.958 --> 06:12:05.839
After this item, don't go yet, if you can manage it.

06:12:05.859 --> 06:12:06.199
Be quick.

06:12:06.659 --> 06:12:07.559
If you can manage it.

06:12:07.579 --> 06:12:12.960
All right, I was going to say good morning, but it's good afternoon.

06:12:13.000 --> 06:12:14.820
It's way into the afternoon.

06:12:15.561 --> 06:12:26.783
So Stephanie Gregson, Deputy Superintendent of the Instruction and Measurement Branch, and I'm here with the newly appointed Director of the Curriculum, Frameworks, and Structural Resources Division, Shanine Coates.

06:12:27.723 --> 06:12:28.244
Yes.

06:12:30.485 --> 06:12:35.950
So we're going to share the presentation of this item because I'm training her to take over all of these items.

06:12:37.771 --> 06:12:40.873
And so with this, let's see.

06:12:41.234 --> 06:12:46.878
So for our new board members, just kind of give you context of where we're at in the process with health instructional materials.

06:12:46.938 --> 06:12:52.803
So we started in March 2008 with the adoption of the health education content standards.

06:12:53.403 --> 06:12:56.666
And once the standards are adopted by the State Board of Education, then we

06:12:57.186 --> 06:13:01.370
work through developing a curriculum framework to align to the standards.

06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:02.952
So the standards are the what, right?

06:13:02.992 --> 06:13:05.554
It's what we want our students to know and be able to do.

06:13:05.874 --> 06:13:07.356
The curriculum framework is the how.

06:13:07.776 --> 06:13:12.600
It's the guidance to teachers and administrators on how to help students meet the standards.

06:13:13.021 --> 06:13:18.165
And so in May of 2019, this year, we adopted the health education framework.

06:13:18.886 --> 06:13:24.969
And within the framework is a chapter that outlines the criteria for instructional materials development.

06:13:25.630 --> 06:13:34.054
And so with that criteria, publishers are then developing their curriculum that's aligned to the standards and aligned to the content of the framework.

06:13:34.414 --> 06:13:40.798
And so now we are here in November 2020 to start the process of the health instructional materials adoption.

06:13:43.083 --> 06:13:43.743
Great, thanks.

06:13:44.284 --> 06:13:50.266
So the recruitment of reviewers took place from April 5th through August 15th, 2019.

06:13:50.886 --> 06:13:55.508
And if you look on the slide, we're about right in the middle of this diagram here.

06:13:56.729 --> 06:14:05.593
And that is the point where you may appoint instructional material reviewers and content review experts that are being recommended by the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:14:06.173 --> 06:14:16.497
So, in January, looking forward, just to give you an idea of what's coming next, January 2020, the CDE will host the publisher's invitation to submit.

06:14:16.917 --> 06:14:24.260
And this is where the statutory and regulatory requirements for participation in the adoption process will be explained.

06:14:24.420 --> 06:14:28.602
And this is a public meeting where we will invite public comment as well.

06:14:29.022 --> 06:14:43.518
And then in April, the commissioners with support from the curriculum frameworks and instructional resources staff will facilitate a training for all of our instructional material reviewers and our content review experts.

06:14:44.299 --> 06:14:48.044
And that would be on the SPE adopted evaluation criteria.

06:14:48.624 --> 06:15:01.250
On the final day of the training, our publishers have an opportunity to essentially present their specific programs and walk the reviewers through their materials prior to submitting them for review.

06:15:02.090 --> 06:15:10.834
After the training, each reviewer receives the materials to be reviewed as well as any items necessary for review directly from the publishers.

06:15:10.874 --> 06:15:12.675
This includes things like the workbooks,

06:15:13.916 --> 06:15:20.541
small readers, or sometimes in the case of electronic resources, the appropriate device for viewing those materials.

06:15:21.482 --> 06:15:32.930
After those materials have been delivered to the instructional material reviewers and the content review experts, they reconvene for deliberations, and that will happen in July of 2020.

06:15:35.285 --> 06:15:42.791
So at the deliberations, the reviewers will rejoin their panels and discuss the findings of their individual reviews.

06:15:43.171 --> 06:15:50.616
The IQC, the commission, will serve as facilitators to help the panels come to consensus on their recommendations.

06:15:52.113 --> 06:15:58.978
They will write and submit to the commission a report, which is their panel report, to describe whether the materials met the requirements or not.

06:15:59.638 --> 06:16:03.161
Again, there will be public meetings in this case as well.

06:16:03.721 --> 06:16:14.288
So following the work on the panels, the IQC will conduct, again, public hearings, two of them, one in August, one in September, where they will also make their recommendations to the state board.

06:16:14.808 --> 06:16:21.073
And over the entire process, the IQC will receive public comment in person and via the CDE email box.

06:16:21.894 --> 06:16:31.953
So, and finally, you will receive the IQC recommendations and hold your own public hearing and take action on the program submitted for the 2020 instructional materials adoption.

06:16:33.203 --> 06:16:36.786
All right, so what we're here today is to talk about the Instructional Material Reviewers.

06:16:37.146 --> 06:16:43.010
So on April 5th, 2019, we began the application and recruitment process for Instructional Material Reviewers.

06:16:43.410 --> 06:16:50.055
We had to extend it through August because we did not receive enough applicants, a large enough applicant pool.

06:16:50.115 --> 06:16:55.099
So we did extend it through August and reached out to recruit more, and we did get more, thank goodness.

06:16:55.419 --> 06:16:55.659
Woo-hoo!

06:16:56.180 --> 06:16:56.520
And so...

06:16:57.981 --> 06:17:02.044
So went through a process to look at our content review experts.

06:17:02.244 --> 06:17:05.826
So all of our panels are required to have a content review expert.

06:17:06.147 --> 06:17:11.390
A content review expert is an instructional material reviewer that has a doctorate in the related fields.

06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:14.792
So they are there to provide their expertise on current research.

06:17:15.333 --> 06:17:24.919
Then you have the instructional materials reviewers that, again, do the same review process as the content review experts, but they're coming from the lens of being a classroom teacher or an administrator.

06:17:25.179 --> 06:17:27.461
And the majority of our panels need to have

06:17:28.201 --> 06:17:30.683
K to 12 classroom teachers on them.

06:17:31.024 --> 06:17:36.328
So those are the voices that are being heard during the review and deliberation process.

06:17:36.908 --> 06:17:42.272
So are there any questions on the difference between instructional material reviewers and content review experts?

06:17:42.553 --> 06:17:45.595
They do the same review process, they're sitting at the same table.

06:17:46.396 --> 06:17:49.959
I just thought that would be important to share that they're not separated, they're part of the panel.

06:17:49.999 --> 06:17:55.223
They're part of the panel, there's no difference except for the content review experts have a doctorate degree.

06:17:55.723 --> 06:17:56.524
in the related field.

06:17:56.544 --> 06:17:56.884
Must have.

06:17:57.065 --> 06:18:03.231
Yeah, they must have.

06:18:04.232 --> 06:18:12.381
So now, because Shanine's going to have to get used to this, when she gets turned over as the Executive Director of the Instructional Quality Commission, she'll get the recommendation.

06:18:12.461 --> 06:18:13.122
But we have a question.

06:18:15.250 --> 06:18:26.239
So the Ed Code refers to the instructional materials pertaining to kindergarten through eight, but the instructional materials will be made available for K-12, is that right?

06:18:27.140 --> 06:18:32.264
So, well, the instructional materials that are submitted are for the grade levels of K-8 only.

06:18:35.595 --> 06:18:40.358
So material, are you talking about the instructional material reviewers that can be K to 12 classroom teachers?

06:18:40.678 --> 06:18:54.586
Yes, so as I'm looking through the list of requirements and where teachers come from, it's a very heavy, there's a lot of nine to 12 teachers, but they won't actually be reviewing materials that will go to high schools.

06:18:55.246 --> 06:18:55.827
That's correct.

06:18:55.947 --> 06:19:02.310
And the reason why it's heavy on 9 through 12 is that is where the single subject health credentials are mainly held.

06:19:02.651 --> 06:19:05.773
That's where the single health courses are housed at.

06:19:05.853 --> 06:19:07.474
They're in 7th through 12th grade.

06:19:07.954 --> 06:19:11.236
You don't find a single health teacher in K to 6.

06:19:11.376 --> 06:19:15.719
Okay, great.

06:19:17.259 --> 06:19:18.140
So the instructional

06:19:24.568 --> 06:19:25.449
review experts.

06:19:26.069 --> 06:19:31.775
The California Department of Education recommends that the State Board of Education take the following action.

06:19:32.195 --> 06:19:38.281
Appoint instructional material reviewers and content review experts as recommended by the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:19:38.301 --> 06:19:40.904
Any questions?

06:19:41.124 --> 06:19:49.152
Yeah, I'm gonna first ask member Ortiz-Lacona as our liaison if she has any comments and then I'll go to member Rucker and then we'll see if there are any other comments or questions.

06:19:50.453 --> 06:19:54.654
I have no comments, but I am hearing some side conversation about the actual number.

06:19:54.834 --> 06:19:59.495
Is this on average how many we recruit to serve as reviewers?

06:19:59.575 --> 06:20:03.676
Are we over, under, right about the number that we typically have?

06:20:03.896 --> 06:20:05.757
It's really based on the content area.

06:20:05.897 --> 06:20:10.218
So English language arts, you're going to have a lot more publishers that are going to be submitting programs.

06:20:10.238 --> 06:20:12.178
So we need a larger amount of reviewers.

06:20:12.558 --> 06:20:14.579
Math the same way, science the same way.

06:20:14.599 --> 06:20:16.079
We had the largest science adoption.

06:20:16.459 --> 06:20:16.999
This is health.

06:20:17.739 --> 06:20:19.220
It's a very finite.

06:20:20.040 --> 06:20:25.842
topic and not a lot of publishers are creating health instruction materials to go through the adoption process.

06:20:26.162 --> 06:20:34.826
So therefore we are kind of actually over planning with our reviewers to ensure that we're ready for five to eight submissions from publishers.

06:20:35.706 --> 06:20:36.766
We don't expect that many.

06:20:37.367 --> 06:20:38.247
I reviewed the list.

06:20:38.567 --> 06:20:43.929
I think it's a lot more diverse than what we saw with the initial group of advisors.

06:20:44.849 --> 06:20:45.550
This is help.

06:20:46.130 --> 06:20:56.814
And so we will have to make sure that we follow this closely as the process unfolds and that there is obviously fluid and constant communication with the board so that

06:20:57.674 --> 06:20:59.836
It is exactly what we had envisioned.

06:20:59.916 --> 06:21:06.243
It adheres to the standards, the framework, but we also are very mindful of the materials that we're adopting.

06:21:11.271 --> 06:21:15.474
So I'm glad that I get to follow my colleague on the board in asking this question.

06:21:15.554 --> 06:21:23.059
So I recognize in approving your recommendation, what we're only approving is the list of reviewers.

06:21:23.120 --> 06:21:32.226
But my question really relates to the training that you anticipate that the reviewers will be receiving.

06:21:34.418 --> 06:21:52.048
We learned a lot from the adoption of the history social science material because there was a series of very controversial discussions and a long running dialogue about the content and the intent of the materials and the adoption.

06:21:52.608 --> 06:21:59.632
And so we've learned a lot from that in preparing those trainers and there was a conversation to help those reviewers

06:22:00.231 --> 06:22:03.752
in preparing to do the work of that adoption.

06:22:04.272 --> 06:22:16.396
And so, as was already stated, this is health, and we are aware of what the controversy is about the content that many anticipate the materials will include.

06:22:16.996 --> 06:22:28.880
And so, in looking at the list of reviewers, I'm very satisfied with who is chosen to step into this process and become involved, but I want to understand

06:22:29.520 --> 06:22:46.825
for the training or the work that they will be given, how will that conversation be facilitated based on what we learned from what happened with the history social science reviewing process?

06:22:47.108 --> 06:23:03.893
So we took what we learned from the history of social science adoption process, specifically around the Fair Education Act, and utilized that in our science adoption training to see if the clarity that we could provide helped the deliberation discussion when our reviewers came together.

06:23:03.933 --> 06:23:04.713
And we found that it did.

06:23:05.533 --> 06:23:22.419
So we are going to even do further clarity because it's not just around the Fair Education Act in this instance, it's around the health education standards themselves and the actual content of the framework versus what people perceive is within the framework.

06:23:22.799 --> 06:23:25.380
So there will be a lot of clarity within our training.

06:23:25.420 --> 06:23:27.881
We have the reviewers for a four-day training.

06:23:28.681 --> 06:23:39.089
And they are trained by the commissioners and CDE staff so that we are able to ensure that they are fully understanding what their role and responsibility is in the review process.

06:23:39.410 --> 06:23:45.995
We do have a lot of reviewers that come to this process thinking that they're going to be able to change the entire content of a textbook.

06:23:46.615 --> 06:23:52.040
And so through our training process, we help them understand what their role is and what their role isn't.

06:23:52.500 --> 06:23:54.321
And as a former reviewer, it's hard.

06:23:55.422 --> 06:23:56.343
It's very difficult.

06:23:56.383 --> 06:24:11.613
You spend hundreds of hours poring through these textbooks for alignment to the standards as a very first criteria and then looking for all of the other elements that are outlined in the framework chapter on the instructional materials development process.

06:24:11.813 --> 06:24:14.975
So it is a rigorous process and our training is rigorous as well.

06:24:15.015 --> 06:24:19.458
We've done a lot of changes since we've been learning with the history social science adoption.

06:24:19.778 --> 06:24:20.958
So, I appreciate you bringing that up.

06:24:21.078 --> 06:24:25.040
I just like to reinforce the strength of CIFR in the training.

06:24:25.200 --> 06:24:26.480
They've really learned a lot.

06:24:26.620 --> 06:24:39.464
It is so impressive to watch how the team takes the reviewers through the process and for the reviewers themselves, the personal commitment to going through the 4-day training, getting a pallet of materials delivered to their house.

06:24:39.984 --> 06:24:42.966
going through all of it and then coming back to review it again.

06:24:43.086 --> 06:24:46.868
It's really a commitment to the quality of materials we're going to provide to students.

06:24:46.888 --> 06:24:47.849
I will agree with that.

06:24:47.909 --> 06:25:01.617
I have sat through and participated in three of the four adoption trainings, and I did not sit in with the science adoption training, so I am looking forward to seeing what will happen with this as well.

06:25:04.562 --> 06:25:27.619
And just to bring up one another area of sensitivity and it was came to mind Through board member Patio Bronson's comment around more health K. Sorry high school 912 educators that we want to make sure that for younger students that the material is sensitive to kindergarten and elementary so

06:25:27.819 --> 06:25:28.799
Yes, absolutely.

06:25:28.859 --> 06:25:36.662
And like I say, I'm just going to reiterate, the reason why you see so many upper grade teachers is because they're also experts in the health education content standards.

06:25:37.162 --> 06:25:38.202
No, I understand that.

06:25:38.442 --> 06:25:41.663
But we do have experts in early childhood as well.

06:25:41.683 --> 06:25:42.063
We do.

06:25:42.123 --> 06:25:43.804
We have that developmental appropriateness.

06:25:43.924 --> 06:25:44.144
Yes.

06:25:46.305 --> 06:25:49.646
Are there any other questions or comments at this point?

06:25:50.186 --> 06:25:52.967
We're going to move to see if there's any public comment.

06:25:54.127 --> 06:25:55.368
There is no public comment.

06:25:56.669 --> 06:25:58.711
So do I have a motion?

06:26:03.775 --> 06:26:04.535
It's been a long day.

06:26:05.556 --> 06:26:09.840
I move the CDE's recommendation.

06:26:09.940 --> 06:26:10.821
I'm so sorry.

06:26:10.901 --> 06:26:12.942
I move the CDE's recommendation.

06:26:12.962 --> 06:26:14.584
All right.

06:26:14.724 --> 06:26:15.965
We have a first and a second.

06:26:16.025 --> 06:26:17.146
Is there any further discussion?

06:26:17.166 --> 06:26:19.067
You guys are getting punchy now.

06:26:19.307 --> 06:26:20.609
Is there any further discussion?

06:26:21.987 --> 06:26:23.167
All in favor say aye.

06:26:23.847 --> 06:26:25.008
Any opposed say nay.

06:26:25.488 --> 06:26:26.348
Any abstentions?

06:26:26.608 --> 06:26:27.488
Motion passes.

06:26:27.948 --> 06:26:29.409
You may take a 10-minute break.

06:26:33.570 --> 06:26:34.150
It's time.

06:26:34.970 --> 06:26:38.290
Go run around the building or something, you know, take some recess.

06:26:39.571 --> 06:26:40.231
Okay.

06:26:42.711 --> 06:26:49.473
I just want to let you know as we're reconvening that if we press on ahead we may finish by 5.

06:26:51.838 --> 06:26:53.440
Little motivation there.

06:26:56.443 --> 06:26:57.384
Well, don't change it yet.

06:26:57.404 --> 06:26:59.527
Don't change it yet.

06:27:01.389 --> 06:27:04.792
Well, this has been a very expeditious board.

06:27:06.111 --> 06:27:11.013
I think Eileen, you must have really moved things forward when you were... Okay.

06:27:12.554 --> 06:27:16.276
So we're going to move to our consent calendars at this point.

06:27:17.676 --> 06:27:20.818
And we will take up the waiver consent items.

06:27:22.379 --> 06:27:26.881
Waiver 01 through 04 and then 06 and 07.

06:27:28.141 --> 06:27:31.303
Is there any public comment on waivers one through four?

06:27:32.363 --> 06:27:32.543
No.

06:27:33.164 --> 06:27:33.544
All right.

06:27:35.083 --> 06:27:36.324
Then do I have a motion?

06:27:39.225 --> 06:27:40.506
Member Sandoval, thank you.

06:27:41.486 --> 06:27:41.927
Thank you.

06:27:44.368 --> 06:27:45.588
Is there any further discussion?

06:27:46.689 --> 06:27:48.650
Seeing none, all in favor say aye.

06:27:49.410 --> 06:27:50.451
Any opposed say nay.

06:27:51.091 --> 06:27:51.911
Any abstentions?

06:27:52.452 --> 06:27:53.212
Motion carries.

06:27:54.793 --> 06:28:03.517
And then I think now we're moving to numbers six and seven and member Rucker do you need to read on that or not?

06:28:04.173 --> 06:28:04.974
No, okay, we're fine.

06:28:04.994 --> 06:28:07.676
The one that got pulled was the one that you might have had to leave for, yeah.

06:28:08.356 --> 06:28:08.676
Okay.

06:28:10.298 --> 06:28:13.320
Just want to be sure that we're remembering all of those.

06:28:13.700 --> 06:28:16.122
So is there any public comment on item six or seven?

06:28:16.743 --> 06:28:16.923
No.

06:28:18.364 --> 06:28:19.885
We'll be ready for you in a moment, Cindy.

06:28:19.905 --> 06:28:21.726
I'm ready now.

06:28:22.087 --> 06:28:26.750
I know.

06:28:27.211 --> 06:28:28.211
No public comment.

06:28:30.573 --> 06:28:31.674
So do I have a motion?

06:28:33.476 --> 06:28:33.916
Thank you.

06:28:33.956 --> 06:28:34.416
A second?

06:28:34.676 --> 06:28:35.156
I'll second.

06:28:35.316 --> 06:28:36.357
Member Sun, thank you.

06:28:36.477 --> 06:28:37.237
Any discussion?

06:28:38.177 --> 06:28:38.537
All right.

06:28:38.717 --> 06:28:39.777
All in favor say aye.

06:28:39.797 --> 06:28:39.858
Aye.

06:28:40.738 --> 06:28:41.518
Any opposed?

06:28:42.338 --> 06:28:43.238
Any abstentions?

06:28:44.079 --> 06:28:44.399
All right.

06:28:44.459 --> 06:28:45.419
The motion carries.

06:28:46.039 --> 06:28:50.360
So now we're going to take up the regular consent items, items 10 through 14.

06:28:51.100 --> 06:28:54.101
Are there any public comments on items 10 through 14?

06:28:54.341 --> 06:28:54.561
No.

06:28:55.461 --> 06:28:55.981
All right.

06:28:57.342 --> 06:28:58.682
I will now ask for a motion.

06:29:01.167 --> 06:29:01.488
Okay.

06:29:01.508 --> 06:29:01.948
Thank you.

06:29:02.009 --> 06:29:02.489
Is there a second?

06:29:02.509 --> 06:29:02.790
Second.

06:29:03.631 --> 06:29:04.853
Thank you, Member Sandoval.

06:29:05.814 --> 06:29:07.296
Any discussion?

06:29:09.159 --> 06:29:09.479
All right.

06:29:09.519 --> 06:29:10.841
All those in favor say aye.

06:29:10.861 --> 06:29:10.921
Aye.

06:29:11.863 --> 06:29:13.665
All opposed say nay.

06:29:13.685 --> 06:29:15.227
Any abstentions?

06:29:15.708 --> 06:29:16.489
Motion carries.

06:29:17.941 --> 06:29:25.603
And now we're going to go back to item 5, which we had moved to this point in the agenda.

06:29:25.623 --> 06:29:33.945
So you'll be happy to know, Cindy, it is your turn to come to the podium with Barb, I guess.

06:29:34.345 --> 06:29:42.527
This is the update on the development of the California State Plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act, technical amendments for inclusion in the state plan for resubmission to the U.S.

06:29:42.547 --> 06:29:43.567
Department of Education.

06:29:44.249 --> 06:29:44.710
Take it away.

06:30:01.306 --> 06:30:02.266
while they find a replacement.

06:30:02.626 --> 06:30:15.250
So today I will present, I'll open the item and then Barb is going to, Barb Richardson is going to talk about the educator equity and then I'll close it out with the increase of the goal for graduation rate.

06:30:15.950 --> 06:30:16.611
So just

06:30:18.291 --> 06:30:21.553
A little background, we're now three, four years into this law.

06:30:23.554 --> 06:30:28.378
Obviously it's part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

06:30:28.678 --> 06:30:33.181
I'm not going to go into it much further because we talk about this plan almost all the time.

06:30:33.201 --> 06:30:36.043
So these are the topics we're going to cover today.

06:30:37.323 --> 06:30:40.824
equity, and then long-term goal for graduation rate.

06:30:41.684 --> 06:30:44.765
The Department of Education approved our plan over a year ago.

06:30:45.545 --> 06:30:49.366
You took action a year ago to send amendments to the U.S.

06:30:49.566 --> 06:30:54.967
Department of Education, and we have still not received official word whether or not they've accepted our amendments or approved our amendments.

06:30:55.527 --> 06:30:58.268
So a year later, the submission is still pending.

06:30:59.451 --> 06:31:08.373
We are on track to submit another round of amendments for everything that you've done this year, the actions you've taken around the accountability system, among other things.

06:31:09.173 --> 06:31:14.634
You will get a high-level summary of that in an information memorandum in December.

06:31:15.134 --> 06:31:18.535
And then in January, we're going to give you the plan and track changes.

06:31:18.855 --> 06:31:21.716
So that is the bulk of it.

06:31:22.036 --> 06:31:26.597
It's a very bulky item, but it'll just have whatever we've looked at for this year, assuming

06:31:27.797 --> 06:31:33.061
we are still on track with our prior amendments that hopefully will be approved by then.

06:31:34.062 --> 06:31:37.665
But that is the plan moving forward for the next two months.

06:31:38.706 --> 06:31:41.528
So with that, I will turn it over to Barb.

06:31:46.712 --> 06:31:48.053
Good afternoon, everyone.

06:31:48.214 --> 06:31:57.161
President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Alcala, and board members, I'm Barb Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division here at the Department of Education.

06:31:59.079 --> 06:32:16.816
So, our SSA state plan requires that we describe how the state educational agency will evaluate and publicly report information regarding how low-income and minority children in schools supported by Title I funds are not served at disproportionate rates by ineffective, out-of-field, or inexperienced teachers.

06:32:17.637 --> 06:32:33.152
Further, ESSA requires that LEAs applying for federal funds to describe how they will identify and address any disparities that result in low-income and minority students being taught at higher rates than other students by ineffective, inexperienced, or out-of-field teachers.

06:32:34.073 --> 06:32:40.399
More than 1,600 LEAs have responded to this requirement already in their LCAP federal addenda this year.

06:32:41.829 --> 06:32:55.496
Just as a small side note, when I presented information on this topic to the CPAG last month, the California Practitioners Advisory Group, sorry, I'm gonna try and avoid all acronyms, one member of the group shared that she thought that labeling teachers ineffective was not very helpful.

06:32:56.296 --> 06:33:01.378
So I wanna be very clear right here at the outset that we 100% agree with her.

06:33:01.398 --> 06:33:08.642
This is a term that is used by the federal government and we only use it at the state level for this specific federal requirement.

06:33:09.282 --> 06:33:21.724
Further, we know that some of the disproportionalities or equity gaps that we see in California schools and districts are greatly exacerbated by the fact that California is in the midst of a severe teacher shortage.

06:33:22.364 --> 06:33:27.185
So it's really important to just sort of set this is not about blaming people for things.

06:33:27.625 --> 06:33:37.607
This is our work to meet this federal requirement and also to do our best to make sure that kids have access or equitable access to the best prepared teachers we can find.

06:33:38.641 --> 06:33:45.684
Finally, I want to really say that collecting and reporting this type of data is extremely complicated.

06:33:46.744 --> 06:33:58.028
To do it properly, you need folks with deep expertise and credentials, federal and state law, standards and courses, and who's teaching what, and of course, data.

06:33:58.188 --> 06:34:00.429
So you may notice that behind me, I've

06:34:01.329 --> 06:34:05.533
amassed a small army of experts from two agencies.

06:34:05.573 --> 06:34:11.319
We have colleagues from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing here to help support the conversation this afternoon.

06:34:11.339 --> 06:34:15.023
And our data friends are here, Cindy and her team.

06:34:16.690 --> 06:34:32.253
And I think it just shows you we've been working together across the two agencies, program, data, folks from both agencies, really working hard to do the best we can to meet this federal requirement and serve our kids.

06:34:32.633 --> 06:34:43.375
So with that, the CDE proposes to clarify the definitions for ineffective and out-of-field teachers that are currently in our ESSA state plan.

06:34:45.697 --> 06:34:51.938
The state plan right now defines the term ineffective teacher as a teacher who is misassigned or teaching without a credential.

06:34:52.558 --> 06:35:08.882
A teacher who is misassigned has been placed in a position for which the employee does not hold a legally recognized certificate or credential or a certificated employee placed in a teaching or services position in which the employee is not otherwise authorized by statute to serve.

06:35:09.562 --> 06:35:18.425
This definition was designed back in 2017 to align to LCFF Priority 1, which addresses appropriately assigned teachers.

06:35:21.522 --> 06:35:34.877
An out-of-field teacher in the current plan is defined as a teacher who is assigned based on a general education or special education limited assignment teaching permit, also known as a GLAP or a CLAP.

06:35:35.117 --> 06:35:38.541
And even though I'm going to avoid acronyms, some of them are too hard to resist.

06:35:38.881 --> 06:35:39.982
More as we move forward.

06:35:41.764 --> 06:35:53.266
So, GELAPs can be issued at the request of an employing school district, county office of education, charter school or state agency to fill a staffing vacancy or need.

06:35:53.887 --> 06:36:05.529
They're issued for a one-year period only and can be reissued in any one subject twice if the holder completes the renewal requirements and the employing agency requests the permit.

06:36:06.249 --> 06:36:22.752
Similarly, CELAPs can be issued to fill a staffing vacancy or need for a one-year period and can be reissued in any one special education specialization area twice if the holder completes the renewal requirements and the employing agency requests the permit.

06:36:26.823 --> 06:36:32.032
An inexperienced teacher is defined as a teacher who has two or fewer years of teaching experience.

06:36:32.553 --> 06:36:36.280
Fortunately, we do not propose to update this definition in the new plan.

06:36:37.141 --> 06:36:37.863
That one will stick.

06:36:39.693 --> 06:36:57.729
So as I mentioned, each LEA receiving ESSA funds must submit a plan to the state educational agency that describes how it will identify and address any disparities that result in low-income and minority students being taught at higher rates than other students by ineffective, inexperienced, or out-of-field teachers.

06:36:58.450 --> 06:37:05.376
In the 2018-19 school year, more than 1,600 LEAs addressed this requirement in their LCAP federal addendum.

06:37:06.357 --> 06:37:18.629
This is probably a good time to mention that the CDE has developed the Promoting Equitable Access to Teachers, or PEAT, program to assist LEAs in identifying and addressing local disparities or equity gaps.

06:37:19.350 --> 06:37:25.716
The PEAT program includes a suite of equity tools designed to assist LEAs as they collect and analyze the appropriate data

06:37:26.377 --> 06:37:37.553
conduct data analyses to identify equity gaps, conduct a root cause analysis, and consider various strategies to address disparities and engage stakeholders throughout the process.

06:37:38.604 --> 06:37:48.308
These tools were developed to help LEAs successfully complete their LCAP federal addenda this year and also to continue to address any equity gaps in the years ahead.

06:37:48.988 --> 06:37:55.850
You can take a look at them if you go to our webpage and just type Pete, like the soil amendment, in the search box.

06:37:56.951 --> 06:37:59.011
P-E-A-T, not our friend Pete.

06:37:59.692 --> 06:38:03.113
But Pete in the search box, you'll get to the page and you'll see all of the tools.

06:38:04.560 --> 06:38:16.089
Further, to meet ESSA data reporting requirements, the CDE, in collaboration with our colleagues at the Commission on Teacher Credentialing, has been working to update several elements of the educator data collection process.

06:38:16.749 --> 06:38:24.975
The two agencies have entered into a data sharing MOU in order to modernize and digitize the current system for assignment monitoring statewide.

06:38:25.856 --> 06:38:40.989
The Commission is currently developing a new system that will use both CTC and CDE data to identify potential misassignments and provide communication platforms for counties and school districts to address and resolve those potential misassignments.

06:38:41.009 --> 06:38:47.635
So we're going to automate this process that the CTC has been conducting for many years under state law.

06:38:49.224 --> 06:38:57.775
Finally, in order to effectively assess which credential and authorization is required to teach a course based on the state course code name and description.

06:38:58.433 --> 06:39:05.617
CDE staff has updated the entire set of state course codes to bring them into alignment with all of our new standards.

06:39:06.277 --> 06:39:08.818
And those course codes are collected in CALPADS.

06:39:09.259 --> 06:39:14.001
And we've also added a number of attributes that further refine each one of those course descriptions.

06:39:14.061 --> 06:39:23.506
So again, we have a better understanding and our LEAs have a better understanding so that we can do a better match to figure out who is and isn't appropriately assigned.

06:39:25.106 --> 06:39:37.858
So to share information around all of these updates, Department and Commission staff partnered this spring and offered 31 in-person trainings and several webinars around all of these updates.

06:39:40.621 --> 06:39:48.569
3,300 people through in-person trainings at county offices of education and over 1,900 additional participants via webinars.

06:39:49.190 --> 06:39:54.275
Staff continue to offer support to the field through office hours held every Monday for one hour.

06:39:54.476 --> 06:40:01.343
The hour is dedicated to informing the field of any changes or updates within the various programs and to take any questions from LEAs.

06:40:02.444 --> 06:40:18.920
As staff traveled the state to share all of this information about changes, participants requested quite often clarification around how specific authorizations and permits fit into those 2017 adopted definitions because they're relatively broad.

06:40:19.200 --> 06:40:21.522
Particular people were like, well, where do the PIPs and STIPs go?

06:40:23.003 --> 06:40:33.188
So staff proposes to update the definitions adding more detail to clarify where each of California's permits and authorizations falls into our as a state plan definitions.

06:40:33.808 --> 06:40:50.135
We think that these clarifications will both help LEAs more easily and consistently identify and address local equity gaps and they'll also provide the state with a more accurate picture of our state level equity gaps and this will help us provide more targeted and effective technical assistance.

06:40:50.715 --> 06:41:06.554
So, we propose to clarify the definition for ineffective teacher to include individuals whose assignments are legally authorized by an emergency permit that does not require possession of a full teaching license,

06:41:07.475 --> 06:41:19.166
Individuals who hold a full teaching credential, but do not hold a permit or authorization that temporarily allows them to teach outside of their credentialed area, those teachers are misassigned.

06:41:19.306 --> 06:41:26.372
They have a credential, but they're not holding the proper permit to teach the students and content that they're teaching.

06:41:27.133 --> 06:41:32.798
And finally, the individuals who hold no credentials, permits, or authorizations to teach in California.

06:41:36.013 --> 06:41:43.376
Under this new clarified definitions, teachers with the following permits would be considered ineffective.

06:41:44.537 --> 06:42:00.723
That would include those teaching with provisional internship permits, short-term staff permits, variable term waivers, and individuals teaching with substitute permits or teaching permits for statutory leave who are teachers of record.

06:42:01.203 --> 06:42:04.945
They would all be considered ineffective under this refined definition.

06:42:08.863 --> 06:42:14.230
So a couple of explanations of what PIPs and STIPs and TPSLs are.

06:42:14.310 --> 06:42:16.813
See, I can't resist those acronyms.

06:42:16.994 --> 06:42:22.340
Who doesn't, you can say TPSL with me, because it just feels so good to say it.

06:42:22.461 --> 06:42:24.704
PIPs and STIPs and TPSLs, come on.

06:42:28.004 --> 06:42:34.169
The board is fortunate to have two former chairs of the CTC on it.

06:42:34.229 --> 06:42:38.752
But for those of you who haven't worked at the CTC, come on, pips, tips, never mind.

06:42:40.093 --> 06:42:40.394
So.

06:42:43.436 --> 06:42:43.756
See?

06:42:43.777 --> 06:42:45.698
You want to do a little spin.

06:42:47.259 --> 06:42:47.640
Here we go.

06:42:47.660 --> 06:42:48.921
All right, so.

06:42:52.321 --> 06:43:05.391
Provisional internship permits can be issued to individuals who have not yet met subject matter competence requirements needed to enter an intern program to fill an immediate staffing need in an employing agency.

06:43:06.552 --> 06:43:21.283
And short-term staff permits, or STIPs, can be issued to individuals that possess a baccalaureate degree or higher, have satisfied the basic skills requirement, and completed required coursework to fill an acute staffing need in an employing agency.

06:43:22.352 --> 06:43:32.394
Variable term waivers can be issued to individuals to give them a little more time to complete credentialing requirements when a fully credentialed teacher is not available for the assignment.

06:43:33.235 --> 06:43:47.718
And TPSLs can be issued to individuals with baccalaureate degrees that have satisfied basic skills requirements as well as an initial 45 hours of preparation to fill a position where the teacher of record is unable to teach due to a statutory leap.

06:43:49.955 --> 06:44:03.779
Individuals teaching with PIPS, STIPS, variable term waivers, and TPSLs do hold official documentation from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing to fill immediate staffing needs when a fully credentialed teacher cannot be found.

06:44:04.179 --> 06:44:11.941
However, these individuals have not yet completed a preparation program and are fundamentally teaching without a credential.

06:44:12.441 --> 06:44:16.942
So that's why we recommend that they move into the ineffective definition.

06:44:19.608 --> 06:44:22.970
Staff also recommends clarifying the definition of out-of-field teacher.

06:44:23.570 --> 06:44:29.033
The current definition for out-of-field teachers includes individuals teaching with G-LAPS and C-LAPS.

06:44:29.733 --> 06:44:44.621
Staff proposes to include individuals teaching with short-term waivers, emergency English learner or bilingual permits on local assignment options, in addition to the G-LAPS and C-LAPS that are in the current definition.

06:44:47.068 --> 06:44:59.172
So quick explanations, short term waivers allow employers to assign teachers who hold basic credentials to teach outside of their credential authorization for one semester or less with the teacher's consent.

06:45:00.172 --> 06:45:11.856
Emergency English learner permits and bilingual authorization permits allow qualified individuals to be employed while completing the requirements for the English learner certificate or bilingual authorization.

06:45:14.232 --> 06:45:28.763
And finally, local assignment options allow employing agencies to place a teacher in a position outside of their credential authorization if the agency is unable to assign a teacher or other certificated employee with the appropriate credential.

06:45:29.323 --> 06:45:37.189
So, all of the individuals that we propose to include in the out-of-field definition have completed a preparation program.

06:45:38.511 --> 06:45:52.376
Unlike most of the individuals that would be included in the ineffective definition, these teachers do hold credentials but have not yet demonstrated subject matter competence in the subject area or for the student population to which they are assigned.

06:45:54.077 --> 06:46:08.241
So once these definitions are approved, we will update our PEAT program resources to reflect these clarified definitions and conduct additional and ongoing outreach and technical assistance to LEAs as they work to eliminate their equity gaps.

06:46:09.302 --> 06:46:19.725
LEAs will be required to update the section of their LCAP federal addendum related to educator equity to reflect the updated definitions of ineffective and out-of-field teachers.

06:46:21.324 --> 06:46:22.766
I'm not sure if you want to go on.

06:46:22.866 --> 06:46:33.458
As I mentioned, we have a large contingent back here who would be happy to address any questions regarding the recommended updates, revisions to these definitions.

06:46:33.938 --> 06:46:36.361
We have colleagues from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

06:46:36.421 --> 06:46:36.802
We have

06:46:37.222 --> 06:46:40.824
the Executive Director, Mary Sandy, and two Aarons.

06:46:41.124 --> 06:46:47.408
Those of you who work at the credential know that we are so lucky to have both Aarons Google and Aaron.

06:46:48.529 --> 06:46:49.610
We have a lot of Aarons here.

06:46:49.770 --> 06:46:51.371
And we have Cindy's whole team.

06:46:51.851 --> 06:46:56.794
And we will do our best to support you to make this decision.

06:46:57.054 --> 06:47:00.016
Or you can go on to accountability, and we'll come back to this.

06:47:01.471 --> 06:47:06.947
only take a few clarifying questions, but hold our kind of big questions until after public comment.

06:47:07.489 --> 06:47:09.554
So, Member Rucker, a clarifying question.

06:47:18.691 --> 06:47:27.260
would make these corrections in their LCAP addendum related to this area.

06:47:27.380 --> 06:47:35.389
Is the correction also related to the expenditure that they have in their narrative about the Title II funds or is it just about this definition?

06:47:35.749 --> 06:47:36.769
that they have to amend?

06:47:37.149 --> 06:47:39.250
All right, so thank you for that question.

06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:40.130
That's a good question.

06:47:40.150 --> 06:47:41.811
I think probably lots of folks have.

06:47:42.771 --> 06:47:47.172
We're not asking them to make corrections because they haven't done this incorrectly.

06:47:47.793 --> 06:48:04.118
They have crafted responses based on our current definitions, and we will be asking them to update responses to reflect the numbers of teachers that are involved with these updated, clarified definitions.

06:48:06.752 --> 06:48:07.793
Does that answer your question?

06:48:07.813 --> 06:48:10.974
I wanted to understand what the revision was, so that's helpful.

06:48:12.435 --> 06:48:18.319
We are continuing to support those 1,600 LEAs right now to do this properly.

06:48:18.779 --> 06:48:23.922
Most of them have completed and had this section of their LCAP addendum approved, about 75%, 79%.

06:48:24.422 --> 06:48:28.285
We're continuing to work with the remaining folks.

06:48:29.305 --> 06:48:43.685
And then this spring, we're going to ask everyone to go back, pending your decision on what the new definitions would be, or the clarified definitions would be, and revisit and update that section.

06:48:48.216 --> 06:48:50.897
I will wait because now I have another question.

06:48:50.917 --> 06:48:53.638
Any other clarifying questions?

06:48:53.958 --> 06:48:59.360
Well, I have a couple of comments, liaison, and then a question as well.

06:49:00.020 --> 06:49:06.323
So, thank you for bringing up the definition of the word ineffective.

06:49:06.443 --> 06:49:10.064
I had a lot of issues with this when we were submitting the ESSA plan.

06:49:10.624 --> 06:49:15.246
because it's just an incorrect term for this.

06:49:15.506 --> 06:49:25.089
And I had even suggested that we first define what effective teacher is and then we can pick out the effective teachers and then everybody else would be ineffective.

06:49:25.549 --> 06:49:27.910
But we didn't have 10 years to get there.

06:49:28.270 --> 06:49:29.852
as a plan in.

06:49:29.872 --> 06:49:31.233
So this is where we went.

06:49:31.674 --> 06:49:43.085
And so nevertheless, you know, given this, it does provide data to us to see where we do have teachers who may not be fully credentialed.

06:49:43.606 --> 06:49:50.833
When we did the definition initially, we had not considered all of the different, you know,

06:49:51.954 --> 06:49:55.916
types of credential certifications that are out there.

06:49:56.016 --> 06:50:03.799
And so, this item here is to help clarify that for the field and to help us with collection of that information.

06:50:04.279 --> 06:50:13.042
So, I guess my question is, then, what do we do, other than to send this to the feds, this information, and collect it?

06:50:13.522 --> 06:50:15.363
How do we use it in California?

06:50:15.563 --> 06:50:20.845
And I don't know if the commission folks might want to speak to that and what they're doing.

06:50:20.845 --> 06:50:32.956
if we're getting into our deeper discussion and maybe we should get our public comment and then come back to that deeper discussion because I think there are a lot of questions that will emerge as we do that.

06:50:33.397 --> 06:50:34.578
Because it's a great question.

06:50:34.638 --> 06:50:36.940
I just want to give it time.

06:50:37.641 --> 06:50:38.962
So are there any public comments?

06:50:40.704 --> 06:50:41.124
Okay.

06:50:41.204 --> 06:50:41.865
You have more item.

06:50:43.021 --> 06:50:44.301
All right, okay.

06:50:44.482 --> 06:50:48.983
We'll do our other item, then we'll do public items, then we'll have a robust discussion of both items, okay?

06:50:49.803 --> 06:50:50.984
Once we get deeply in.

06:50:51.184 --> 06:50:51.544
Thank you.

06:50:51.624 --> 06:50:59.966
So, the other part of the ESSA item is proposing the shift in the long-term goal for the extended graduation rate.

06:51:00.006 --> 06:51:03.087
So, you all... So, completely change your brain.

06:51:03.147 --> 06:51:04.228
Yeah, change your preview.

06:51:04.248 --> 06:51:04.748
Yeah, yeah.

06:51:04.848 --> 06:51:06.408
It is hard to do that, I know.

06:51:06.448 --> 06:51:07.789
We'll try to change our brain.

06:51:09.309 --> 06:51:15.715
So back, if we go back two months to July, you all adopted a combined four and five-year graduation rate.

06:51:15.955 --> 06:51:18.097
Nationally, they call that the extended year graduation rate.

06:51:18.397 --> 06:51:22.941
There has been a series of consequences that we need to deal with within our ESSA state plan.

06:51:22.981 --> 06:51:27.685
And so this is the last piece of it is that we need to set a more rigorous long-term goal.

06:51:28.425 --> 06:51:35.370
So in order to come into compliance, we are suggesting you shift the goal for our graduation rate from 90% to 90.5%.

06:51:37.972 --> 06:51:45.818
Based on our analysis, it would impact from the prior year 56 LEAs and schools that had graduation rates between 90% and 90.4%.

06:51:49.552 --> 06:52:06.263
So this is a just a nice chart that just shows you where the shift is and then in the board item it actually had the tables note that there was an Error on one of the tables for the DAS we didn't update the high it actually stayed at 90% it should have been 90.5% So essentially what is not changing?

06:52:07.184 --> 06:52:12.147
for our Traditional schools is a very high rate what is changing for?

06:52:12.588 --> 06:52:19.032
Traditional schools is changing shifting it from 90 to 90.5 percent to less than 90 percent 95 percent and then for median

06:52:19.572 --> 06:52:24.034
medium, you need to go up to that 90, your top of the range will be 90.5%.

06:52:24.434 --> 06:52:29.516
And the same shift is being done for our dashboard alternative schools as well.

06:52:30.296 --> 06:52:33.557
That is the end of my piece of the presentation.

06:52:35.806 --> 06:52:38.869
So again, we'll take clarifying questions, but can you go back to the chart?

06:52:39.089 --> 06:52:47.335
I can, and I should have mentioned that before we got to today, we have been conducting as a stakeholder meetings.

06:52:47.395 --> 06:52:52.299
And so we do these about, I think it's been about every month for the last couple of months, or at least the entire year.

06:52:52.820 --> 06:52:54.461
And those are very well attended.

06:52:54.941 --> 06:52:57.083
We always get over 100 people on those webinars.

06:52:57.123 --> 06:53:01.907
So this is something we have taken to the field as well as the information that Barb just presented.

06:53:03.004 --> 06:53:05.105
Are there any clarifying questions on this item?

06:53:05.125 --> 06:53:07.947
Yes, member of Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:53:10.388 --> 06:53:14.391
I have a question about sort of the modest increase from 90 to 90.5.

06:53:15.491 --> 06:53:26.477
Is it because we looked at the data and that would have great impact on those schools that were in the blue for graduation or I know why we did why we increased it but I'm wondering why the 0.5?

06:53:28.277 --> 06:53:30.519
The .5 is something that we felt we could stand behind.

06:53:30.559 --> 06:53:34.243
We had looked at other states, so the shift is modest.

06:53:34.263 --> 06:53:38.927
We know that a lot of schools, majority of our schools are not actually graduating.

06:53:40.225 --> 06:53:42.387
large numbers of students in that fifth year.

06:53:42.507 --> 06:53:49.153
So it's sort of in keeping with the data in general about the actual number of students who are in the fifth year.

06:53:49.173 --> 06:53:53.817
But beyond that, you get to sort of take a guess.

06:53:53.857 --> 06:54:01.103
And I don't know that 91% would have been, I don't know that we've actually done, I need to double check on whether or not we did the simulations for that.

06:54:04.552 --> 06:54:09.496
So it's time to get to any public comment.

06:54:09.936 --> 06:54:29.791
I should note, I probably should have noted earlier that I am going to, when we get into deeper discussion, propose an amendment to the item on definitions because our ESSA plan states that an out-of-field teacher is a teacher who has not yet demonstrated subject matter competence in the subject areas for which he or she is assigned.

06:54:30.431 --> 06:54:35.073
and some of the areas in which that is true are not currently in the definition.

06:54:36.173 --> 06:54:49.278
So this is really CTC speak, but just to flag that I believe that all of the areas in which subject matter competence has not been demonstrated should be included as examples there.

06:54:49.999 --> 06:54:58.702
There will be potentially different perspectives on that, but I'll just, we'll come back to that when we get into the deep discussion.

06:55:00.137 --> 06:55:01.519
All right, so public comment.

06:55:01.760 --> 06:55:03.002
How many do we have?

06:55:04.384 --> 06:55:04.965
There are four.

06:55:06.628 --> 06:55:11.356
Sheila Whitley, Dean Drescher, Rigel Massaro, and Sarah Lillis, please line up.

06:55:18.482 --> 06:55:20.724
Hi, Angela de Ramos on behalf of CTA.

06:55:21.405 --> 06:55:25.489
We don't have a position on the changes themselves, but we did have some questions and a suggestion.

06:55:26.210 --> 06:55:36.301
Will the new changes require consolidated application for this year to be redirected, or will the new changes be added to be in line with the LCAP template that is being adopted in January?

06:55:36.921 --> 06:55:56.536
And then CTA also recommends that the state would prioritize Title II funds and that you direct school districts to meaningfully consult and strategize with their bargaining units to develop local plans to help improving teacher quality and effectiveness, particularly for beginning teachers and out-of-field teachers with that goal in mind.

06:55:56.636 --> 06:55:56.937
Thank you.

06:55:56.957 --> 06:56:03.842
We have to take note of these questions so we can ask them to you when we're done with public comments.

06:56:10.330 --> 06:56:12.471
Good afternoon, Chair Darling-Hammond and members.

06:56:12.571 --> 06:56:14.311
Rigel Massaro with Public Advocates.

06:56:14.511 --> 06:56:21.353
I'm speaking to the letter submitted by the LCFF Equity Coalition on these revised educator equity definitions.

06:56:21.493 --> 06:56:29.356
We appreciate the board and department staff's engagement with stakeholders in this item, and we support the revised ineffective and out-of-field definitions.

06:56:29.456 --> 06:56:32.256
I will avoid both spelling them out and the acronyms.

06:56:33.397 --> 06:56:37.738
While imperfect, as Barbara described, these definitions are the only current measure.

06:56:38.378 --> 06:56:46.004
of statewide and local teacher equality, and how prepared and experienced teachers are equitably placed to teach our low-income and students of color.

06:56:47.365 --> 06:56:49.306
I'd love to hear more about the chair's proposal.

06:56:49.346 --> 06:57:05.798
We would support the out-of-field definition being inclusive, that is actually including everyone that is under the ineffective definition, but that is also out-of-field, which is often the case with misassigned teachers, permit holders, and waiver holders.

06:57:06.879 --> 06:57:17.591
If that is not the way the board goes, we would urge the department to aggregate both ineffective and out of field into a distinct combined measure that is actionable for policymakers and local communities.

06:57:17.871 --> 06:57:18.192
Thank you.

06:57:30.502 --> 06:57:33.164
for the lines of comment.

06:57:34.185 --> 06:57:45.735
Okay so we want to take up these items in in turn and maybe we'll invite Barb back to the podium first to talk about the

06:57:47.056 --> 06:58:02.227
First item and member Sun you were about to Raise a set of interesting questions, and why don't you go first so yet, so I was gonna Ask a little bit about that is how do we look at it as a state?

06:58:02.867 --> 06:58:07.871
You know I and I do think that this isn't this is a problem and again Thank You Barbara for bringing up

06:58:08.451 --> 06:58:23.280
that collecting of this data is for us to see where we have gaps in fully credentialed teachers or teachers who are credentialed in their field for the purpose of supporting students.

06:58:24.901 --> 06:58:27.262
But we also know about the teacher,

06:58:28.943 --> 06:58:32.488
the lack of teachers in the state at this point.

06:58:32.648 --> 06:58:38.675
And so it's not about blaming and shaming, but as a state, we really need to take on that responsibility as well.

06:58:38.735 --> 06:58:42.240
So I was curious about what we do with this data at the state level.

06:58:44.124 --> 06:58:46.765
So we do a lot of different things at the state level.

06:58:46.805 --> 06:58:54.189
And I think everyone here knows how much work has been done and has been able to move forward because we have these huge teacher shortages.

06:58:54.950 --> 06:58:57.191
So we have loan forgiveness programs now.

06:58:57.231 --> 06:58:59.612
We have teacher residency programs now.

06:58:59.672 --> 06:59:07.477
We have new professional learning programs, which we are optimistic will help people to stay in the profession because they're better prepared and better supported.

06:59:07.857 --> 06:59:12.980
So from a policy making place, I think having this information that shows that we have

06:59:13.840 --> 06:59:18.428
overall shortages of fully prepared teachers is very helpful to us.

06:59:19.370 --> 06:59:24.699
Under No Child Left Behind, the state was required to intervene and provide sanctions

06:59:25.390 --> 06:59:31.733
You remember as a school leader.

06:59:32.113 --> 06:59:36.735
So the very broad thing is we can advocate for policy because we have issues.

06:59:37.456 --> 06:59:44.719
But in a much more targeted way, we help individual LEAs think about their equity gaps and encourage them.

06:59:45.279 --> 06:59:47.981
Because it's one thing to have inexperienced teachers.

06:59:48.041 --> 06:59:49.441
We were all inexperienced once.

06:59:49.922 --> 06:59:54.044
And it's one thing to have a teacher shortage that requires you to have various,

06:59:54.864 --> 07:00:05.258
types of authorizations in your district, but should all of the less than fully prepared teachers be teaching certain student groups?

07:00:06.201 --> 07:00:07.282
in certain schools.

07:00:07.883 --> 07:00:17.070
So under No Child Left Behind, we were authorized to require folks to do an equitable distribution plan if they had gaps.

07:00:17.511 --> 07:00:19.012
We went in and intervened.

07:00:19.713 --> 07:00:25.778
In the third year of Compliance Monitoring Intervention and Sanctions, we went in and said you have to spend your Title II money

07:00:26.218 --> 07:00:34.347
to address these gaps and you have to have board policy that says we will not have all of our underprepared teachers in one school, we will spread them out.

07:00:34.868 --> 07:00:45.379
So we don't have authority to do that anymore and that's fine, that's not really consistent with LCFF anyway for the state to come in and require districts to move, right?

07:00:46.400 --> 07:00:59.370
That's not who we are, but we still do provide lots of technical assistance to LEAs as they're calculating their equity gaps and trying to figure out who is teaching which students in which schools.

07:00:59.870 --> 07:01:08.256
We can provide them with support to say, hey, maybe you want to try this and maybe you want to think about that and provide that level of technical assistance and support.

07:01:08.276 --> 07:01:11.619
I don't know if, no, that's fine.

07:01:13.689 --> 07:01:13.909
Other?

07:01:14.730 --> 07:01:16.671
Yeah, Member Ortiz-Lacon and Member Burr.

07:01:18.752 --> 07:01:29.658
You know, as you were describing, and this is an educator equity sort of audit that we're holding to see where we have our concentration of inexperienced, ineffective.

07:01:30.179 --> 07:01:38.544
But as you were answering the question, I thought the initiative that the superintendent has to recruit more males of color,

07:01:39.748 --> 07:01:45.410
would actually fall under perhaps inexperienced because we're trying to recruit them, right?

07:01:45.450 --> 07:01:46.190
And where are they going to go?

07:01:46.210 --> 07:01:53.253
We're going to put them in racially isolated schools because we also want them to be mentors and for students to see themselves in the teachers.

07:01:53.733 --> 07:01:57.274
Some of them may actually qualify under this ineffective teacher category.

07:01:57.894 --> 07:02:14.163
So it is important for us to also think not only on the accountability side, but the support side, because sometimes this will, as we're trying to recruit and diversify the student or the teacher pool, they fall under these categories.

07:02:14.563 --> 07:02:21.987
And, you know, ineffective, I also struggle with that, because you can have somebody that doesn't have the proper credential, it's there in an emergency,

07:02:22.527 --> 07:02:35.376
or any of these classifications, but they really can connect to the students that they're serving, but they do need support because they're new and we put them in hard to staff and under-resourced schools.

07:02:35.856 --> 07:02:48.505
So I think it's more than just the accountability, though I agree that that's important, but it's also how do we support and strengthen this if we do really want to diversify the teacher pool and bring them to the students in racially isolated schools.

07:02:48.705 --> 07:02:50.787
Many of those educators will fall under these buckets.

07:02:53.296 --> 07:02:54.077
and already do.

07:02:54.097 --> 07:03:00.826
May I ask a question about the reporting because I think it's related to this.

07:03:01.507 --> 07:03:03.850
In the item that you sent us in August, the

07:03:08.063 --> 07:03:10.485
Summary of key issues on the educator equity data.

07:03:11.246 --> 07:03:13.348
There's a lovely chart which I really love.

07:03:13.468 --> 07:03:20.054
It's table three and it lists each of the credential types just very without any other labels or descriptors.

07:03:20.735 --> 07:03:28.262
Fully credentialed, university intern credentials, district intern credentials, limited assignment teaching permits, PIPs, STIPs, variable term waivers.

07:03:29.902 --> 07:03:34.343
Those of us from the CTC just love to use these terms over and over again.

07:03:34.783 --> 07:03:53.587
But it gives people like just like here's just the facts and I'm wondering are we going to as our ESSA plan had suggested publish this at the state district and school level you know irrespective of these labels that were required also to give people information on

07:03:54.895 --> 07:03:57.037
That is something that we are working on.

07:03:57.137 --> 07:04:07.324
Our intent is to be able to provide, because as we've supported districts to calculate their equity gaps for the last six months or so, we've realized that they need more help to be able to do that.

07:04:07.885 --> 07:04:14.129
So our goal is to be able to automate that calculation for them and include it in the student accountability report card.

07:04:14.810 --> 07:04:20.454
That'll take a little time and a little resources that would fall under Cindy's shop to be able to

07:04:20.954 --> 07:04:27.376
do that and as you know she's pretty busy doing 72 other things but it is on the list of things that we want to do.

07:04:27.416 --> 07:04:34.179
We want to be able to have this data be readily available for schools and districts as well as compile it at the state level.

07:04:34.239 --> 07:04:39.081
One of the reasons I ask is because it comes without affective labeling.

07:04:40.001 --> 07:04:49.576
of the kind that we have to report for comparability purposes, but it is just very clear and factual and gives people the information that they can use.

07:04:49.636 --> 07:04:50.778
So I appreciate that.

07:04:51.399 --> 07:04:51.780
Member Burr.

07:04:53.103 --> 07:05:00.728
So, excuse me, Barb, it is late in the day and I may have fallen asleep at the beginning part of this about, but I- I should have said tips a little sooner.

07:05:00.748 --> 07:05:10.755
I'm trying to understand what changed since we did our first plan that caused us to go back in and want to change the definitions.

07:05:11.155 --> 07:05:13.857
That's my first question, just to sort of understand the context.

07:05:14.417 --> 07:05:17.779
But my second one is my anti-ESSA hat.

07:05:19.915 --> 07:05:21.876
which is how does this interact?

07:05:21.916 --> 07:05:32.882
And it's kind of, I think it's consistent with what people are saying here is that A, I can't stand the idea that we're labeling again and we're calling people ineffective because of where they are in their experience level.

07:05:33.583 --> 07:05:43.789
But B, we have a lot of state mechanisms for this purpose, assignment monitoring, we have the LCAP about basic conditions, we have the Williams Settlement.

07:05:44.609 --> 07:05:55.175
I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that the state has a huge commitment to making sure that we have fully qualified teachers in all of our schools.

07:05:56.036 --> 07:05:58.197
And we don't call them ineffective or effective.

07:05:59.037 --> 07:06:01.399
So I'm struggling with this a bit on the two levels.

07:06:01.699 --> 07:06:04.060
What changed and why do we have to go in and change it?

07:06:04.080 --> 07:06:06.822
And maybe again, I fell asleep and don't know what that is.

07:06:07.402 --> 07:06:20.826
But secondly, how is this going to enhance what our state level commitment is to educator equity, separate and not, once again, bow down to the federal government?

07:06:25.328 --> 07:06:26.628
I plan to, thank you.

07:06:30.369 --> 07:06:32.030
Oh, Dave's gonna help.

07:06:35.751 --> 07:06:48.041
First of all, as we went out and did the roadshow this spring, we heard from a lot of folks a lot of confusion about where various authorizations and certifications landed in these definitions in the 2017.

07:06:50.855 --> 07:06:52.195
for the definitions themselves.

07:06:52.255 --> 07:06:54.136
I think that's what Sue is asking.

07:06:54.176 --> 07:07:08.880
So in ESSA and even before that in CLB and before that, there's a comparability requirement that districts must show that in Title I schools there are no more

07:07:09.860 --> 07:07:22.914
There's not a greater proportion of out-of-field teachers than in non-Title I schools, of inexperienced teachers than in non-Title I schools, and then they moved to the term ineffective rather than uncertified, which was...

07:07:25.381 --> 07:07:29.746
I thought it was, anyway, we used to just be able to report certification.

07:07:30.606 --> 07:07:33.610
So they moved to that term for measuring comparability.

07:07:33.650 --> 07:07:37.574
So that's the genesis of us having to do it because it's part of the federal law.

07:07:38.174 --> 07:07:47.024
Now Barb can explain how we're changing from one plan submission to the next, the way we're classifying those.

07:07:48.325 --> 07:07:50.587
Yes, so it's a federal requirement.

07:07:51.087 --> 07:08:07.780
And the reason to bring the proposal to clarify is fundamentally, as we went out in the field and we talked to thousands of folks who are responsible for pulling this data together and reporting it to us so we can report it to the feds, they had questions about, well, where do PIPs go?

07:08:07.820 --> 07:08:08.841
Where do TPSLs go?

07:08:08.861 --> 07:08:10.442
I just want to say TPSLs again.

07:08:10.483 --> 07:08:12.124
I don't know if you have questions about TPSLs.

07:08:12.784 --> 07:08:14.165
Where do all these various

07:08:16.648 --> 07:08:29.562
So this is us trying to provide more information to the field as they do what they're required to do, because not only does the state have to,

07:08:30.683 --> 07:08:40.072
collect and report and evaluate this data, under ESSA, LEAs are required to describe how they're going to address any identified equity gaps.

07:08:40.112 --> 07:08:46.899
So they just need clarification on if we're using these buckets, the state is using these buckets, who's actually in the buckets.

07:08:53.732 --> 07:09:02.214
Dave Sapp, Deputy Policy Director for State Board of Education, offered to help Barb on the second question, which is sort of, there's a lot of things in state law, what role does this have?

07:09:02.314 --> 07:09:14.997
And the reason why, because of the transition for Shanine and how the different pieces fit together, just think this interacts with the board's accountability work very closely, and so I just thought it would be helpful to provide some support, is that

07:09:16.637 --> 07:09:25.947
This year's budget trailer bill which was SB 75 included some some new language that will require the board to review the existing local

07:09:31.092 --> 07:09:33.776
Siri's listening.

07:09:33.836 --> 07:09:35.578
Siri loves TPSLs too.

07:09:36.819 --> 07:09:46.492
But the board will be required to review and update the existing local indicators for which the state has comparable school level data on a statewide basis.

07:09:48.053 --> 07:09:52.457
By 2021, the Board will have to take a look and update local indicators if such data exists.

07:09:53.017 --> 07:09:57.601
This is one area for the existing local indicators where such data will exist.

07:09:57.661 --> 07:10:07.269
In fact, it may end up being the basics priority, that priority one under LCFF may end up being the only one of the current local indicators that meet that requirement.

07:10:07.669 --> 07:10:15.145
So, I think this goes both to Member Sun's question, to Board President Darling-Hammond's questions about what do we do with this data.

07:10:15.746 --> 07:10:18.512
This is truly a federal reporting requirement.

07:10:19.920 --> 07:10:22.402
The data has to be carved up and reported in a particular way.

07:10:22.882 --> 07:10:29.307
As far as how to make it actionable, that is something that can be addressed within the state accountability process and the board actually has authority.

07:10:29.807 --> 07:10:42.496
Under that new trailer bill language, we will be required to actually look at within the dashboard itself, going back to the question of can the data be reported granularly as opposed to just this broad category of quote-unquote ineffective.

07:10:43.337 --> 07:10:48.039
the sub-breakdowns of these different authorization statuses and how they're combined or not combined.

07:10:48.059 --> 07:10:56.203
I understand there will be a discussion of is ineffective plus out of field, do you look at those together or are they overlapping?

07:10:56.283 --> 07:11:00.245
Whichever way the board comes down on the federal reporting, that's federal reporting.

07:11:00.765 --> 07:11:05.087
For state accountability, it can be looking more at a broader base of what's going on in schools.

07:11:06.334 --> 07:11:14.680
And what is the quality of the credential status of the teachers in schools and the disparities across a district where there are multiple school sites?

07:11:14.700 --> 07:11:19.484
And if there are disparities, how should that factor into determining if they're eligible for differentiated assistance?

07:11:20.024 --> 07:11:29.071
I think there will also be opportunities, and this will be more of a legislative-type conversation, of thinking about how this data might fit in to these new initiatives that Barb referenced,

07:11:29.992 --> 07:11:33.616
the teacher residency, loan forgiveness, etc.

07:11:34.056 --> 07:11:47.151
If we know that there are certain schools that are disproportionately relying on teachers that both have not completed teacher preparation and lack subject matter expertise for the subjects that they are teaching, maybe that should be factored into eligibility, etc.

07:11:47.171 --> 07:11:48.572
So I think there is a lot of

07:11:49.153 --> 07:11:53.337
It's really exciting because this data can be used to inform those state policymaking questions.

07:11:53.677 --> 07:12:06.450
I think the decision today for the board is simply one of how to report in a federal report, and that's not limit how the underlying data can be used for state accountability, support determinations, and otherwise.

07:12:06.790 --> 07:12:11.154
So I think sort of how they fit in together is this is one of those examples of we need to do it as a condition of $2.5 billion.

07:12:13.016 --> 07:12:20.578
And so updating the definition to ensure, frankly, just to be blunt, the first definition included terms that was subject to two interpretations.

07:12:21.538 --> 07:12:24.239
And that was the source of the confusion in the field.

07:12:24.619 --> 07:12:30.221
And it also would undermine the quality of the data looking at it from a statewide perspective because people may be using different definitions.

07:12:30.621 --> 07:12:34.645
different understandings of the definition because they were susceptible to those different definitions.

07:12:35.065 --> 07:12:45.415
So this is trying to be more specific and comprehensive to ensure that the data are in fact comparable and then that can inform future actions as appropriate for state accountability and support determinations.

07:12:58.097 --> 07:13:09.950
So, first of all, I just want to say $2.5 million, even though we can sit billion, $2.5 billion with a B, B, B, B, B. That's a lot of government cheese.

07:13:10.331 --> 07:13:18.440
That may not seem like a lot of money at this level, but in those LEAs that receive that money, it's a lot of money for them.

07:13:18.940 --> 07:13:24.204
So I can understand why we need to take the steps of meeting the compliance requirement.

07:13:24.625 --> 07:13:29.428
But again, I heard you say something that gives me some pause for concern.

07:13:29.929 --> 07:13:42.458
Board member Burr has pointed out we have mechanisms in the state to address not only accountability, but the work that needs to be done with districts concerning these teacher quality issues.

07:13:42.518 --> 07:13:47.222
Because this is a persistent and seemingly intractable problem.

07:13:47.662 --> 07:13:59.912
And so one of the statements that I heard was that, you know, we don't have necessarily the levers to make districts do certain things, and I'm not sure I agree with that.

07:14:00.372 --> 07:14:10.280
Under Title II, there's 23 approvable activities or acceptable activities that can be used for using Title II funds.

07:14:10.960 --> 07:14:23.865
And part C of Title II requires districts to meaningfully consult with their local associations before they spend any part of that money under Title II.

07:14:24.326 --> 07:14:27.327
With the teachers that we are adding who are misassigned,

07:14:27.907 --> 07:14:39.116
Districts have an obligation under our state law to provide the professional development to make those teachers whole, to address whatever the issue is of that misassignment.

07:14:39.616 --> 07:14:57.391
Further, we know in this state there was a moment in time where teachers who were going through induction were being charged a fee by their districts to pay for their induction, even though teacher induction and certification programs can also be paid for by Title II funds.

07:14:57.831 --> 07:15:11.440
So I think that we're missing the opportunity here to do some additional enforcement and to do some additional mandating with our LEAs by identifying this as a state priority.

07:15:12.300 --> 07:15:15.002
That's one of those approval activities under Title II.

07:15:15.062 --> 07:15:19.045
If we decide that this is a state priority, we can direct to districts.

07:15:19.365 --> 07:15:22.787
They have to use those funds to support their beginning teachers.

07:15:23.407 --> 07:15:26.928
on their certification issues and make sure they pay for induction.

07:15:27.208 --> 07:15:43.193
But we can also make sure that when they have identified teachers who are misassigned under this new definition, that they are directed, as a condition of approving whatever we're going to be reporting in the spring, as a condition of approving that,

07:15:43.493 --> 07:15:49.036
that they show in their plans, that they revise their plans to address that as a priority as well.

07:15:49.456 --> 07:16:05.423
I think we're not using all the policy levers we have, not just in writing the definitions, but in establishing conditions for approving their plans and their LCAPs to make sure that this actually happens in the way it's intended.

07:16:07.182 --> 07:16:12.384
That would be something we might want to come back to as an additional policy conversation.

07:16:12.404 --> 07:16:14.445
Okay.

07:16:14.725 --> 07:16:20.107
Member... Okay, Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:16:22.608 --> 07:16:23.448
I like ESSA.

07:16:24.509 --> 07:16:25.249
Board Member Burr.

07:16:29.181 --> 07:16:33.124
We have the sisterhood, but there was a little bit of distance there.

07:16:33.745 --> 07:16:38.749
And so I just want to remind us that we opted for these definitions.

07:16:39.449 --> 07:16:44.052
So when we're looking at the ineffective teacher, not every state is defining it like this.

07:16:44.072 --> 07:16:47.275
There are states that are defining it based on performance, right?

07:16:47.475 --> 07:16:49.877
We chose to move away from that.

07:16:50.397 --> 07:16:50.797
And so,

07:16:51.698 --> 07:16:53.960
We have to live with this because this is what we chose.

07:16:54.460 --> 07:16:59.123
There was a robust discussion that we had about, are we looking at performance?

07:16:59.884 --> 07:17:04.287
I remember Bruce Holliday and Michael Kerr saying, I feel uncomfortable with this definition.

07:17:04.627 --> 07:17:07.989
But we also didn't want to reach into collective bargaining agreements.

07:17:08.349 --> 07:17:12.712
And so I just wanted to remind us that, hi, we created this.

07:17:13.793 --> 07:17:15.294
And so this is where we're at.

07:17:15.714 --> 07:17:16.175
We own this.

07:17:18.559 --> 07:17:34.176
So I have to apologize to everybody because when this item came up in our discussion on our liaison call, this is, for me, this was simply we needed to change or be more explicit in the definition to help the field.

07:17:35.037 --> 07:17:37.419
to figure out what bucket to put things in.

07:17:38.359 --> 07:17:55.090
I had the suspicion that it could open up this can of worms of this whole conversation here, and I think I inartfully did this, because I'm tired, by bringing up the whole, what does California do with this data?

07:17:55.951 --> 07:18:03.116
Yeah, I know, and I so apologize, but the item at hand is

07:18:04.957 --> 07:18:05.025
you

07:18:06.124 --> 07:18:11.968
providing more clarity on those buckets for the field to report the data.

07:18:12.088 --> 07:18:16.591
And so it's simply just a reporting mechanism piece here.

07:18:17.051 --> 07:18:29.260
Now what we wanna do with educator effectiveness, all of that is more of a state conversation that's much, much broader that we do need to take up and we do need to ensure that we continue that conversation.

07:18:29.820 --> 07:18:32.902
So I know, that's why I'm apologizing.

07:18:32.922 --> 07:18:35.103
But we appreciate.

07:18:36.448 --> 07:18:46.594
the mea culpa, but we have to have this conversation so we don't blame you for those of us whether we like us or we don't like us.

07:18:47.515 --> 07:18:51.998
And I would like to just point out one other piece of the clarification.

07:18:52.578 --> 07:18:53.700
so that we can consider it.

07:18:54.301 --> 07:19:07.440
So I noted that the ESSA plan had said that an out-of-field teacher is a teacher who has not yet demonstrated subject matter competence in the subject areas or for the student population to which he or she is assigned.

07:19:08.331 --> 07:19:13.794
And if we were to go back, I don't know if you can do this, Barb, to your ineffective teacher slide.

07:19:14.934 --> 07:19:29.781
As you noted when you were briefing it, there are a number of the PIPs, the STIPs, we all like to say it, the Variable Term Waivers and Substitute Permits, TPSLs, also lack subject matter verification.

07:19:30.521 --> 07:19:34.203
So they are, by that definition, they are out of field.

07:19:35.450 --> 07:19:54.008
The way that out of field in the next slide is currently proposed to be defined, wherever that is, is really, I'm not sure about all of these, Ting, Mary, you'll have to catch me on this, but it's mostly credentialed teachers who are placed out of field.

07:19:55.790 --> 07:19:57.431
And so if we wanted to

07:19:59.626 --> 07:20:14.305
make the definition clear, we'd either say credentialed out-of-field teachers when we publish it to our publics so that they know who's counted, or we should count all of those out-of-field teachers from the ineffective teacher definition as well as out-of-field.

07:20:16.287 --> 07:20:20.392
The categories are not used in the federal sense to add up to 100%.

07:20:20.432 --> 07:20:34.289
You just compare schools that on ineffective teachers, Title I versus non-Title I, out-of-field teachers, Title I versus non-Title I, inexperienced teachers, Title I versus non-Title I.

07:20:36.571 --> 07:20:39.614
many inexperienced teachers will fall in another category, et cetera.

07:20:39.654 --> 07:20:43.797
So there can be overlap in the numbers.

07:20:45.158 --> 07:20:57.508
But I think there should be clarity because parents, consumers, stakeholders, when they're looking at these numbers, want to understand that they fit the definition.

07:20:57.849 --> 07:21:01.191
So we don't want to pretend that people who don't have subject matter

07:21:02.162 --> 07:21:13.250
qualifications like emergency permit holders do have those qualifications, which is the problem with the current proposal if we don't clarify it further.

07:21:13.310 --> 07:21:28.920
So I think there's, you know, one way to go is to simply say as we, to amend this out of field definition to say it includes the categories that are listed under ineffective teacher and these following ones, which will then get everyone

07:21:29.981 --> 07:21:49.496
Counted in that definition who does not have subject matter verification for the thing that for the subjects they're teaching Yeah And so that would be you know a proposed amendment to make the definition actually accurate for what it's saying Pat or member Rucker

07:21:51.010 --> 07:22:08.058
And as I said, the other alternative would be in our own reporting to say credentialed out-of-field teachers for this rather than out-of-field teachers and then to make it aligned to the definition so people know what we're counting.

07:22:08.699 --> 07:22:15.562
Because here we're basically only counting those people who are placed out of field and not all the other people who lack subject matter.

07:22:16.203 --> 07:22:23.479
Verification member Rucker, I think in hearing what Barbara said as she was going through the presentation

07:22:24.304 --> 07:22:35.066
When we look at the definition of the ineffective teacher, so both of these categories of teachers have some kind of document that was issued by the state of California.

07:22:35.586 --> 07:22:51.789
What I heard in the staff presentation is that the difference between the ineffective teacher and the out-of-field teacher is that the definition for the out-of-field teacher was intended to focus on

07:22:52.529 --> 07:23:05.139
California teachers who do have a state credential, but for the subject area they're currently assigned to teach, do not have the subject matter competence.

07:23:05.640 --> 07:23:21.073
I think another way to consider it, what was missing for the definition of ineffective teacher, and that's what I was waiting to hear, these are people who don't have state certification because they have not completed a state credential program,

07:23:21.953 --> 07:23:31.016
And they also have not demonstrated the required subject matter competence to be issued or to receive the state credentials.

07:23:31.056 --> 07:23:34.877
So there's two different issues for these two different groups.

07:23:35.298 --> 07:23:44.961
I think if you try to put the first list of folks also under the second list, the problem is they don't have the same kind of piece of paper.

07:23:45.561 --> 07:23:49.684
as the people who are being identified under this original definition.

07:23:49.704 --> 07:23:51.105
I just think that we have to line up.

07:23:51.145 --> 07:23:52.446
Yeah, we have to line it up.

07:23:52.666 --> 07:23:55.408
Yes, very clearly because there's a public

07:23:56.021 --> 07:23:56.922
Yes, I agree with you.

07:23:56.962 --> 07:23:57.882
We need to line it up.

07:23:57.902 --> 07:24:02.625
But I think what's missing in the first definition is that they don't have subject matter competence.

07:24:03.206 --> 07:24:09.149
And what's missing in the second definition is they don't have subject matter competence for the subject area they're teaching.

07:24:09.189 --> 07:24:10.190
It's not made clear.

07:24:10.230 --> 07:24:11.190
So I agree with you.

07:24:11.531 --> 07:24:13.732
There's something missing from both definitions.

07:24:14.152 --> 07:24:16.754
But I'm not sure if combining it will fix the problem.

07:24:18.451 --> 07:24:19.311
You could do either.

07:24:20.532 --> 07:24:21.952
Either way of solving it.

07:24:22.693 --> 07:24:23.353
One of the errands.

07:24:25.074 --> 07:24:33.798
The suggestion is to amend the definition of out-of-field teacher to just state fully credentialed teachers who have not yet demonstrated subject matter competence.

07:24:33.818 --> 07:24:38.901
Can't be fully credentialed because interns are not fully credentialed, but it could be credentialed teachers.

07:24:40.765 --> 07:24:47.551
Basically everybody here is on a permit except for people who have a preliminary or full credential or an intern credential.

07:24:47.611 --> 07:24:49.132
Those are the only three credentials.

07:24:50.373 --> 07:24:53.235
But fully credentialed would not include interns.

07:24:53.535 --> 07:24:57.839
So you would want to say a credentialed teacher who is placed out of field.

07:24:57.959 --> 07:25:01.061
Does that address the issues at hand?

07:25:01.101 --> 07:25:01.742
That helps me.

07:25:04.465 --> 07:25:09.731
But then you would need to change the definition at the top, so that would also change from our previous ESSA plan.

07:25:09.771 --> 07:25:18.099
It would say a credential teacher who has not demonstrated subject matter competence, if we leave it.

07:25:23.277 --> 07:25:37.951
I do want to clarify that all of the document types that are listed under out-of-field, so the GLAP, CLAP, short-term waivers, emergency, English and bilingual permits and local assignment options, intern credential holders actually cannot be issued any of those.

07:25:38.531 --> 07:25:43.216
So those can only be issued to an individual who has a preliminary or a clear teaching credential.

07:25:43.276 --> 07:25:46.359
So they actually wouldn't be able to be counted in that bucket.

07:25:49.434 --> 07:26:01.660
So that's another wrinkle because under misassignment, for example, which we're trying to get these things to be analogous, you know, intern teachers who are placed out of field would nonetheless be classified as misassigned.

07:26:01.841 --> 07:26:02.881
Yes, exactly.

07:26:02.921 --> 07:26:06.923
An intern teacher who's placed out of field, they would fall under the ineffective teacher category.

07:26:09.465 --> 07:26:10.065
No, they don't.

07:26:11.840 --> 07:26:14.761
because they would technically be misassigned for their assignment.

07:26:14.921 --> 07:26:15.861
They're not listed.

07:26:15.881 --> 07:26:19.802
They're the second bullet in ineffective.

07:26:20.922 --> 07:26:27.023
Short-term staff permits are only issued to... The second top bullet.

07:26:27.203 --> 07:26:33.524
A teacher who holds a full teaching credential but does not possess the permit or authorization that temporarily allows them.

07:26:45.859 --> 07:26:50.964
It wouldn't include your intern teacher who holds the appropriate authorization on their document.

07:26:55.949 --> 07:26:56.189
Yes.

07:26:57.550 --> 07:26:59.212
Any teacher who's misassigned, yes.

07:26:59.912 --> 07:27:02.575
Whether they hold an intern, a preliminary, or a clear credential.

07:27:03.396 --> 07:27:05.498
Is a part of the ineffective teacher.

07:27:05.638 --> 07:27:08.580
That's not what we currently have on the slide.

07:27:08.620 --> 07:27:11.163
If you go back to that slide, it does not

07:27:15.756 --> 07:27:23.482
All right, well, we look at the handout which came from the item, I apologize for the slide.

07:27:24.922 --> 07:27:28.205
The second bullet at the top of the handout under ineffective.

07:27:30.606 --> 07:27:33.028
And this is what's in the item right now as well.

07:27:37.520 --> 07:27:46.263
The teacher who holds the full teaching credential but does not possess a permit or authorization that temporarily allows them to teach outside of their credentialed area, those are misassigned.

07:27:46.423 --> 07:27:49.604
Right, but an intern does not hold a full teaching credential.

07:27:50.344 --> 07:27:54.206
They hold an intern's full needs to be removed from that definition.

07:27:54.226 --> 07:27:55.166
Okay.

07:27:56.947 --> 07:27:57.627
That would clarify.

07:28:00.376 --> 07:28:02.017
Right, and there are only those three.

07:28:02.418 --> 07:28:03.519
Take out the word full.

07:28:04.379 --> 07:28:06.681
This is so in the weeds for the CTC people.

07:28:06.761 --> 07:28:11.305
I realize everybody else is probably going bleh.

07:28:11.965 --> 07:28:27.378
So then that would come out of there, and then we would make it clear that an out-of-field teacher, and I would hope we would label it for the purpose of public dissemination, that it's credentialed out-of-field teachers, and we would then put in the definition, a teacher who has not yet

07:28:27.978 --> 07:28:31.680
a credential teacher who has not yet demonstrated subject matter competence.

07:28:32.260 --> 07:28:42.445
And then you could keep them as orthogonal groups that do not overlap, but they would be accurate to the definitions.

07:28:44.966 --> 07:28:47.767
I'm going to propose that amendment.

07:28:50.493 --> 07:28:51.714
before we get more confused.

07:28:54.156 --> 07:28:55.957
It's intended to be a friendly amendment.

07:28:56.838 --> 07:28:59.720
I don't know how it's being received, but it's intended to be a friendly amendment.

07:29:01.707 --> 07:29:08.791
Yes, so the ineffective teacher definition would say an ineffective teacher is any of the following.

07:29:08.811 --> 07:29:13.955
And in the second bullet, it would delete the word full.

07:29:14.755 --> 07:29:25.522
It would say a teacher who holds a teaching credential but does not possess a permit or authorization that temporarily allows them to teach outside their credentialed area.

07:29:26.502 --> 07:29:26.823
All right?

07:29:27.683 --> 07:29:31.945
And then in the out-of-field teacher, it would read a credentialed out-of-field teacher.

07:29:32.986 --> 07:29:37.948
And an out-of-field teacher is a credentialed teacher who has not yet demonstrated subject matter competence.

07:29:38.048 --> 07:29:39.969
So it would insert the word credentialed there.

07:29:41.590 --> 07:29:47.934
And then I think we would have the clarity that the public needs to be able to know what's going on and what, you know, that we need.

07:29:55.197 --> 07:29:58.783
No, then you would no longer move them because it would be clear.

07:29:58.803 --> 07:30:00.325
Okay, good.

07:30:00.345 --> 07:30:02.128
Yes, I'm totally for that.

07:30:02.588 --> 07:30:05.313
Okay.

07:30:05.673 --> 07:30:08.017
Got the big item again.

07:30:09.779 --> 07:30:10.459
This is part of it.

07:30:10.479 --> 07:30:17.066
So I would like so first I'm going to move the amendment and let's vote on the amendment and then we'll vote on the motion as amended.

07:30:17.186 --> 07:30:17.506
Okay.

07:30:18.107 --> 07:30:20.909
So all in favor of the amendment as stated.

07:30:22.851 --> 07:30:24.153
We don't have a motion.

07:30:24.233 --> 07:30:26.315
I'll move the motion for the amendment.

07:30:29.237 --> 07:30:29.518
All right.

07:30:30.759 --> 07:30:31.380
All in favor.

07:30:32.080 --> 07:30:32.200
Aye.

07:30:32.681 --> 07:30:33.301
Any opposed.

07:30:34.136 --> 07:30:34.916
Any abstentions?

07:30:35.096 --> 07:30:37.557
You're allowed to abstain if you're just completely confused.

07:30:39.678 --> 07:30:43.600
Now we'll move with that amendment to the State Board recommendation.

07:30:45.881 --> 07:30:52.143
All right, second?

07:30:52.804 --> 07:30:53.124
Second.

07:30:53.384 --> 07:30:53.844
Thank you.

07:30:54.104 --> 07:30:55.645
Member Sun, all in favor?

07:30:56.945 --> 07:30:57.065
Aye.

07:30:57.605 --> 07:30:58.326
Any opposed?

07:30:59.986 --> 07:31:01.167
Any abstentions?

07:31:02.202 --> 07:31:04.064
The motions carry.

07:31:05.806 --> 07:31:06.287
Thank you.

07:31:07.128 --> 07:31:14.496
This is probably the hardest thing we have to do for the rest of the day, and we may not make 5 o'clock, but we'll get out of here before 6, I think.

07:31:15.758 --> 07:31:18.040
So we're now going to move on to items 15.

07:31:27.247 --> 07:31:34.675
Which is our state board projects and priorities to take up our minutes from our September 2019 meeting our liaison reports.

07:31:35.776 --> 07:31:42.883
The state board staff recommendation recommends that we approve the preliminary report of actions and minutes for the September 11th, 2019 meeting.

07:31:45.866 --> 07:31:56.932
And consider the State Board screening recommendations for appointments to the Advisory Commission on Special Education, California Practitioners Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality Commission.

07:31:57.712 --> 07:32:03.455
Do I have a motion from a board member to approve the September 11th State Board of Education?

07:32:04.596 --> 07:32:05.736
Just the minutes first.

07:32:05.776 --> 07:32:06.517
Yes, that's what I'm doing.

07:32:06.577 --> 07:32:08.978
Draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes.

07:32:12.521 --> 07:32:31.789
and second thank you member Rucker any discussion all right any public comments all right all in favor say aye any opposed nay any abstentions motion carries

07:32:33.204 --> 07:32:46.135
Now I'll ask Vice President Strauss to share the recommendations from the State Board Screening Committee regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission on Special Education, California Practitioners Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality Commission.

07:32:46.195 --> 07:32:53.140
And I want to ask her to do that while offering thanks for her amazing role in helping us get to this point.

07:32:53.340 --> 07:32:53.881
Let me just say.

07:32:54.321 --> 07:33:05.589
the screening committee of Kim Petillo-Bronson and Feliz Ortiz-Lincon and myself read more than 220 applications for all the commissions.

07:33:05.909 --> 07:33:07.390
220, more than.

07:33:07.851 --> 07:33:15.796
So when we have a second day meeting in January, we will recognize the support and the time they spent on weekends and nights to do that.

07:33:16.137 --> 07:33:22.301
So that included, by the way, reading all the applications, then have a call to narrow down the applications

07:33:22.601 --> 07:33:27.847
And then another call, which was all the interviews to finalize each of commissions recommendations.

07:33:28.427 --> 07:33:32.771
The other thing that you should know is the staff worked really hard to really extend and recruit.

07:33:32.852 --> 07:33:38.938
So we did a really strong job and in every category got amazing, amazing field of candidates.

07:33:39.858 --> 07:33:43.841
So for everyone who reached out to people they knew and encouraged them, it was really wonderful.

07:33:44.242 --> 07:33:48.565
The other thing is state board staff and CDE staff staff each commission.

07:33:48.965 --> 07:33:56.531
So for each commission, we have the CDE and state board staff members as part of the paper screening and interview process as well.

07:33:56.571 --> 07:33:58.312
So it's really a comprehensive support.

07:33:58.732 --> 07:34:01.034
So, with that, we have an amazing recommendation.

07:34:01.714 --> 07:34:04.116
The 1st, 1 is for instructional quality commission.

07:34:04.457 --> 07:34:19.729
We are recommending for appointments 3 now for starting in January 1 in January 2021, Lily Jarvis, director of bilingual programs and a principal at Monrovia unified was selected to represent the world language category for a 3 year term.

07:34:20.202 --> 07:34:22.183
Her term begins in January 1st, 2020.

07:34:23.323 --> 07:34:33.966
Dr. Lindsay Gotanda, Assistant Superintendent of Ed Services for Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, was selected to represent the All Subjects District Administration category for three-year term.

07:34:34.066 --> 07:34:35.966
She also begins her term in January 2020.

07:34:37.387 --> 07:34:45.669
Mariana Estorga-Almanza, Visual and Performing Arts Coordinator for Linwood Unified School District, was selected to represent the Visual and Performing Arts category

07:34:46.129 --> 07:34:48.573
and her three-year term begins in January.

07:34:48.893 --> 07:34:58.387
She's moving over from CPAC, so she's had some experience on our commissions, so that actually vacated a position on CPAC, but she's gonna add a lot in the VAPA area.

07:34:59.833 --> 07:35:05.756
Denae Popovich is a principal in Arcadia Unified, was selected to represent all subjects in elementary administration.

07:35:06.236 --> 07:35:07.697
She's selected for a three-year term.

07:35:07.757 --> 07:35:10.858
Her term begins in January 1st, 2021.

07:35:11.358 --> 07:35:15.600
Amazing candidates, actually huge field, really amazing.

07:35:15.641 --> 07:35:21.523
Now this next part is particularly special because we spent the morning hearing what students had to say about what we should do.

07:35:21.863 --> 07:35:24.465
Last year, they recommended that we should have a student on IQC.

07:35:25.285 --> 07:35:36.754
And this is the first year that the State Board will appoint a student member to serve a one-year term on IQC, and they'll function as a regular voting member with full rights and duties as the other members.

07:35:37.154 --> 07:35:40.317
The SBE Screening Committee is recommending the following individual.

07:35:40.337 --> 07:35:46.822
This student is also a junior, similar to the cycle we have for student board members, so they're appointed in their junior year to serve in their senior year.

07:35:47.262 --> 07:35:48.383
This is Maya Howard.

07:35:48.423 --> 07:35:55.186
She's currently a junior at Mira Loma High School in the San Juan Unified School District, and she'll serve a one-year term beginning in September 2020.

07:35:56.766 --> 07:35:58.907
So that's our recommendations for IQC.

07:35:59.448 --> 07:36:06.851
For the California Practitioners Advisory Group, better known as CPAG, this group, we recommended

07:36:07.151 --> 07:36:10.912
So, we're recommending a reappointment of 2 members for 2 year terms.

07:36:11.412 --> 07:36:17.915
Nancy Lauro, who's a teacher with the San Diego Unified School District representing teachers at traditional public schools.

07:36:18.395 --> 07:36:22.036
So, she will be reappointed for 2 years starting January 2020.

07:36:22.816 --> 07:36:24.937
She's done an amazing job in elementary.

07:36:25.277 --> 07:36:27.699
focus and really a great voice on our CPAG.

07:36:28.220 --> 07:36:41.332
And then Joanne Isken, who's Director of Special Projects at UCLA Center X with Teacher Education, and she's been the chair for the last three years, which we greatly appreciate the service as chair and the working together to bring the committee together.

07:36:41.712 --> 07:36:47.838
She's going to represent the educational research category and she's also reappointed for a two-year term starting in January as well.

07:36:48.358 --> 07:36:51.481
So in addition, we're recommending an appointment of a three-year term

07:36:52.771 --> 07:37:04.798
Melanie Green you might know her as Melanie shoppy green Sheppy she was and she's being appointed as a direct She's director of continuous improvement and support with the San Joaquin County Office of Education.

07:37:05.279 --> 07:37:17.186
She's recommended to Take a three-year term and to represent authorized chartering agencies We're also recommending that she begin a two-year term as a CPAC chair chair starting in January as well.

07:37:17.206 --> 07:37:17.246
So

07:37:17.466 --> 07:37:20.230
So I think she'll, and she's agreed to do that.

07:37:20.711 --> 07:37:28.241
And then we're also recommending Ronald Anaya, a teacher with the Rockland Unified School District to represent teachers from traditional public schools.

07:37:28.281 --> 07:37:31.105
And his term begins in January 1st, 2020.

07:37:33.628 --> 07:37:35.489
So let me just make one more comment.

07:37:37.010 --> 07:37:37.891
Special education.

07:37:38.872 --> 07:37:52.383
So we are recommending, the Advisory Commission on Special Education, we're recommending a reappointment for a four-year term beginning in January 2020 for Christina Mills, currently the Executive Director of the California Foundation for Independent Living Center.

07:37:52.403 --> 07:37:59.129
She's been an amazing participant on the Special Education Commission and was really strongly recommended for reappointment.

07:37:59.741 --> 07:38:04.043
And we're recommending an appointment for a four-year term, Christine Oyekawa.

07:38:04.663 --> 07:38:09.646
She's board president and teach of another language to kids, a parent of a child with disabilities.

07:38:10.046 --> 07:38:12.307
And we're recommending her fill the parent role.

07:38:12.968 --> 07:38:19.731
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, we had a huge volume of applications, wonderful, but in many, many categories.

07:38:19.771 --> 07:38:22.092
So we won't be doing those interviews till a week from Monday.

07:38:22.132 --> 07:38:23.873
That's a full day set of interviews.

07:38:24.313 --> 07:38:29.336
And so we'll bring that screening committee recommendation back to the board for the January 8th and 9th.

07:38:30.496 --> 07:38:30.836
meeting.

07:38:31.156 --> 07:38:45.841
So with that, we're recommending that the board approve our appointments to IQC, CPAG, Advisory Commission on Special Ed, I think those were the, and Instructional Quality Commission, yes.

07:38:47.161 --> 07:38:48.562
And I'll make the motion to approve.

07:38:49.402 --> 07:38:52.463
And Kim Petillo-Bronson second.

07:38:53.963 --> 07:38:58.725
With great thanks to our colleagues, is there any further discussion?

07:38:59.744 --> 07:39:00.765
All in favor say aye.

07:39:00.785 --> 07:39:01.566
Aye.

07:39:01.746 --> 07:39:02.427
Any opposed?

07:39:02.467 --> 07:39:03.068
How dare you?

07:39:03.088 --> 07:39:07.573
Or you can be on the screening committee.

07:39:08.274 --> 07:39:09.175
Any abstentions?

07:39:10.156 --> 07:39:11.137
The motion carries.

07:39:11.217 --> 07:39:14.420
Thank you very much for all of the, you know, amazing work.

07:39:14.460 --> 07:39:18.245
We have to thank all of the members of those committees for their public service.

07:39:18.345 --> 07:39:19.766
It is a lot of work.

07:39:20.927 --> 07:39:29.190
Okay, so we're going to take some time for our report outs on any liaison activities that are not related to items on our agenda.

07:39:29.570 --> 07:39:34.112
We're going to go in reverse alphabetical order so that Member Sun can begin.

07:39:38.935 --> 07:39:48.279
All right, so the California, I'm going to get this right one day with California joint workforce, joint advisory committee.

07:39:48.299 --> 07:39:54.202
Sorry, it's late and we are meeting tomorrow because we always like to meet after the state board meeting.

07:39:55.883 --> 07:40:08.509
And so our major work right now is to work on the Perkins V application, and we will be doing a full reading of the first draft of that application tomorrow.

07:40:09.109 --> 07:40:13.411
And you will be seeing, this body will be seeing a draft of that, I believe, in January.

07:40:13.871 --> 07:40:18.934
So we have plenty of work for us ahead, and in the meantime,

07:40:19.574 --> 07:40:31.302
The division that is working on this, the Career Technical Education Leadership Office is also conducting several stakeholder meetings throughout the state.

07:40:31.482 --> 07:40:39.308
And so if you kind of watch for those and you have people who you want to recommend to go and speak to that plan, please do so.

07:40:40.629 --> 07:40:41.069
Thank you.

07:40:41.089 --> 07:40:42.630
Vice President Strauss.

07:40:43.290 --> 07:40:49.574
So, um, I'm going to report on met for 2 days, September 19th and 20th on the 1st day was member record myself.

07:40:49.994 --> 07:40:57.078
And on that day, the, the draft visual performing arts framework went out for its 1st, 60 day public review and comment.

07:40:57.558 --> 07:41:02.942
and also the draft world language framework went out for its first 60-day public review and comment.

07:41:03.323 --> 07:41:06.005
There also was an update on the mathematics focus group meetings.

07:41:06.045 --> 07:41:13.651
I think we'll hear more about it as we move into the framework approval because that's going to IQC next week, the recommendation for the framework committee.

07:41:14.171 --> 07:41:20.076
But they're actually going out and having focus groups about while that we've worked with the framework, what do we need to do differently now that we've had

07:41:20.416 --> 07:41:21.577
an implementation on it.

07:41:22.457 --> 07:41:29.161
And so we also, on the second day, a member, Artisna Cohn, and I were there for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.

07:41:29.181 --> 07:41:31.282
That's not a framework, it's a model curriculum.

07:41:32.102 --> 07:41:40.467
And the recommendation from CDE was to delay any action or decision so there could be more time for CDE to review, revise, edit, and consider feedback.

07:41:41.027 --> 07:41:48.631
You should know that with history, social science, which was a really active framework group, we had about 10,000 comments, and this time we had

07:41:49.752 --> 07:41:50.152
20,000 comments.

07:41:51.193 --> 07:41:56.057
They were grouped together, 23,000, 22,000, something, over 20,000.

07:41:56.317 --> 07:42:05.145
So, and we had 64 people in the public comments on that day, very respectful, very thoughtful, very passionate about ethnic studies.

07:42:05.205 --> 07:42:09.809
And there is a plan going forward with a listening tour and listening and experts and

07:42:10.131 --> 07:42:16.012
We actually had Assemblywoman Shirley Weber there and State Senator Ben Allen, who are the appointees to IQC.

07:42:16.432 --> 07:42:23.414
It was very thoughtful and well organized, so congratulations, Stephanie, on your work on coordinating all of that work.

07:42:23.814 --> 07:42:30.596
Anyway, next week, IQC's meeting on Wednesday, and we have four outgoing members, because we just appointed some new ones, and there'll be a luncheon that

07:42:31.736 --> 07:42:32.517
We'll honor them.

07:42:32.957 --> 07:42:39.281
The Chair, Suman Chow, Jennifer Wu, the Vice Chair, Lisette Diaz has done an amazing job, had been Chair, and Nicole Nades.

07:42:39.321 --> 07:42:41.342
So, we really do thank their service.

07:42:41.762 --> 07:42:44.004
When you're on IQC, you don't just come to the meetings.

07:42:44.424 --> 07:42:48.787
You listen to all the hearings, you read all the frameworks, you go to the materials review adoption.

07:42:48.907 --> 07:42:52.629
It's a really intense commitment that I think people don't realize the hours.

07:42:52.649 --> 07:42:57.252
And so, Member Rucker will be there next week, and they'll be

07:42:57.702 --> 07:43:00.884
talking about the math curriculum framework group.

07:43:01.464 --> 07:43:09.249
I did, AXA invited me to present the current state of the state driving forces in public education for their Curriculum and Instruction Academy.

07:43:09.649 --> 07:43:13.272
So I did a interesting workshop on kind of where we are and what we've done.

07:43:14.172 --> 07:43:17.494
And then we also had a community of practice math meeting.

07:43:17.814 --> 07:43:21.417
So you all might remember, hold on, this is not working.

07:43:21.777 --> 07:43:24.278
You might remember that there's a group of,

07:43:25.456 --> 07:43:33.101
math leaders who are collaboration, and science leaders who are collaboration, and then they also have a community of practice.

07:43:33.161 --> 07:43:42.147
And so the math community practice that works on equity and access, support for administrators, content knowledge, all the things that we're talking about that we need to fully implement our math.

07:43:42.727 --> 07:43:47.370
They had a wonderful session, Strengthening English Learner Opportunities in Mathematics and Language.

07:43:47.450 --> 07:43:49.632
It's totally relevant to all the work that we're talking about.

07:43:50.712 --> 07:43:53.774
And there's some materials if you're interested in that.

07:43:54.154 --> 07:43:58.336
And then I actually was fortunate, the morning of CPAG, the Science Collaboration Committee met.

07:43:58.396 --> 07:44:06.499
So I really got a chance to talk to the leaders of science around the state on where are we in reviewing and piloting materials that are aligned to NGSS?

07:44:07.020 --> 07:44:08.100
Where are your counties?

07:44:08.200 --> 07:44:13.843
And basically, we're hearing that people are reviewing and piloting now, maybe to adopt for 2021.

07:44:17.148 --> 07:44:20.190
but more likely to be adopted by 21-22.

07:44:20.430 --> 07:44:30.096
And the discussion was, we're gonna put something on the dashboard, we're giving out the results, when do we think people will at least have a year of using Align materials in their new framework?

07:44:30.136 --> 07:44:40.442
So they were wonderful, they're a small group of less than 20, and offered their expertise in all the different counties of our state, and I think they're a resource that we could consider using.

07:44:41.723 --> 07:44:45.605
Last week I talked to the Orange County School Board members and administrators about the state.

07:44:45.965 --> 07:44:47.606
forward what we do and what it means for them.

07:44:47.646 --> 07:44:53.148
A lot of discussion on the Healthy Youth Act and ethnic studies and what we do and what we don't do.

07:44:53.228 --> 07:44:55.869
What we don't pass laws, we don't do budget, those kind of things.

07:44:55.949 --> 07:44:58.469
And there were 150 people was really interesting.

07:44:59.710 --> 07:45:08.333
Last comment, Concurrence Commission, which is a subject matter project, is holding and supporting with UC and CSU a global assignment

07:45:08.673 --> 07:45:14.039
Global Climate Summit at UCLA, December 12th and 13th, and Kim is going to attend.

07:45:14.679 --> 07:45:23.589
Mayor Eric Garcetti has actually just agreed to be the keynote speaker, and there are going to be table groups and about 200 people, and they're going to make a film for follow-up on Climate Summit.

07:45:23.649 --> 07:45:26.091
So that'll be a resource that we'll be able to look at.

07:45:26.411 --> 07:45:26.972
Last comment.

07:45:28.093 --> 07:45:28.774
I think this is it.

07:45:30.175 --> 07:45:31.116
I thought that was my last one.

07:45:31.136 --> 07:45:31.477
I'm sorry.

07:45:33.109 --> 07:45:51.188
So I'm trying to talk fast, so anyway, CTC met September 26th and 7th, and I'm just gonna highlight a little bit of CTC, although Mary's here, so I might not do as good a job as she would, but anyway, they talked about the single subject theater and dance, so some work on that, that's coming up, particularly for us to think about in our visual and performing arts.

07:45:51.568 --> 07:46:02.239
Some straight state grants to recruit teachers, that was in the budget in 18-19 and there's some really a lot of money and work to try to support teacher residency and help our areas of shortage.

07:46:02.659 --> 07:46:08.705
A lot of discussion on literacy and the RECA and the assessment of how to be an effective reading and literacy teacher.

07:46:09.125 --> 07:46:12.768
That's not – that's part of the next CTC meeting in two weeks.

07:46:12.848 --> 07:46:14.129
I just talked to Mary about it.

07:46:14.449 --> 07:46:21.916
So it's a lot of discussion about updating the CTC standards to match our standards, and then the assessments and performance to match that as well.

07:46:21.956 --> 07:46:27.620
And so there's a law that required the RECA, and the standards that we expect are a little bit different.

07:46:27.820 --> 07:46:36.908
Linda's been very involved in that, but I think if this is an area of interest to you, I'll – we'll keep you updated, but it's a very important issue that we need to remember.

07:46:37.288 --> 07:46:44.494
Then also there's some more work groups starting on the career technical ed, which is an area that we're looking at in college and career.

07:46:44.854 --> 07:46:46.715
So lots of work done in that area.

07:46:47.056 --> 07:46:48.917
And then bilingual authorization standards.

07:46:48.957 --> 07:46:59.825
So these are areas, and the reason I bring these up, believe that there were more than this that happened at CTC, but these are areas that affect the things we talk about as far as our ESSA plan, as far as our implementation of standards.

07:47:00.126 --> 07:47:02.788
And with that, that ends my presentation.

07:47:03.408 --> 07:47:03.909
All right.

07:47:04.350 --> 07:47:06.895
Member Sandoval, did she have to leave?

07:47:06.935 --> 07:47:07.737
Okay.

07:47:08.298 --> 07:47:08.799
Member Rucker.

07:47:10.856 --> 07:47:19.303
Okay, so I'm going to just cover an update on the California Early Math Initiative that's being led by the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools.

07:47:19.924 --> 07:47:29.432
As you already know, math has become a statewide priority for us because 50% of California's children at every grade are not achieving state math standards.

07:47:29.872 --> 07:47:39.040
California achievement data clearly demonstrate that elementary, middle, and high school students are not acquiring even the basic mathematical foundations

07:47:39.520 --> 07:47:41.662
needed for college and career success.

07:47:42.183 --> 07:47:49.069
To address this issue, the Fresno County Superintendent of Schools is collaborating with the Early Learning and Care Division,

07:47:49.674 --> 07:48:09.131
of the California Department of Education, the Ames Center for Math and Science Education, the State Board of Education, the California Early Math Project, film director Les Mayfield, and independent evaluation partner WestEd to implement innovative professional development, communications, and resources

07:48:09.642 --> 07:48:17.610
to support children from birth to third grade and ultimately decrease the achievement gap in mathematics for California students.

07:48:18.050 --> 07:48:31.224
The project is geared to support the mixed delivery system of the early care and education field, which includes school districts, county offices of education, family care, home providers, child centered based child care providers,

07:48:31.644 --> 07:48:32.305
and so on.

07:48:32.785 --> 07:48:41.532
In July of this year, there was a summer institute with 30 agencies representing county offices of education, school districts, and early learning agencies.

07:48:41.892 --> 07:48:45.155
This was led by the Aims Center for Math and Science Education.

07:48:45.715 --> 07:48:52.841
The institute focused on developing statewide capacity and expertise in early math and science education.

07:48:53.241 --> 07:49:00.247
The participants represent 22 counties across the state, from Modoc in the north and San Diego in the south.

07:49:00.627 --> 07:49:08.490
The Summer Institute engaged over 100 early childhood educators from these agencies for a week of professional development and networking.

07:49:08.990 --> 07:49:18.293
The goals of the Institute were to help participants develop capacity and expertise in facilitating professional learning with educators in their home context.

07:49:18.733 --> 07:49:22.314
Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the Institute

07:49:22.954 --> 07:49:27.438
and provided feedback on their own developing capacity as leaders.

07:49:28.259 --> 07:49:43.392
Each of the organizations who participated in the institute is currently preparing and presenting implementation plans through which they will work with local educators in their context to scale the goals and outcomes from the initiative.

07:49:43.872 --> 07:49:53.981
WestEd reported some testimonies from the participants and some of their statements included, it elevated my confidence in math and training others in math concepts.

07:49:54.501 --> 07:50:03.189
I feel more confident knowing I do have a good foundation in math and I have a greater understanding of how to move forward as a leading learner.

07:50:03.889 --> 07:50:11.798
In October, a series of public service announcements and math vignettes were filmed in Los Angeles by Les Mayfield.

07:50:12.159 --> 07:50:24.473
The public service announcements and vignettes use humor and everyday situations accessible to all to show how every adult can have a great impact on children's mathematical understanding and success.

07:50:25.073 --> 07:50:31.178
There is a plan to share an example of the public service announcements at an upcoming SBE meeting.

07:50:31.899 --> 07:50:50.453
On November 14th, the Family Math Engagement Night will be held at the Lighthouse for Children Child Development Center in Fresno to pilot a series of math activities, take-home backpack activities, and math installations that will be evaluated and disseminated for replication statewide.

07:50:50.974 --> 07:50:53.596
EdSource will cover and write about this event.

07:50:54.256 --> 07:51:10.812
And also being developed for statewide distribution is a free early math application for parents, literature reviewers, showing how to support mathematical understanding through picture storybooks, a series of early math research briefs, and a resource inventory.

07:51:11.212 --> 07:51:20.944
These components will be tested and refined throughout the project period and will ultimately be made accessible for free on the California Early Math Project website.

07:51:21.324 --> 07:51:30.756
I really want to thank Christine and her staff for supporting me and helping me be an active liaison for the board, not only in the Early Math Project,

07:51:31.136 --> 07:51:33.338
but in the conferences that they do for teachers.

07:51:33.419 --> 07:51:48.834
I do want to say her program and the staff are very successful with recruiting classroom teachers to come to these conferences and to participate in meaningful ways and I think that the work that they're doing is an exemplar for the work that we need to continue doing for math.

07:51:48.854 --> 07:51:51.997
Thank you.

07:51:52.037 --> 07:51:53.118
Member Patio-Bronson.

07:52:04.206 --> 07:52:04.826
That probably helps.

07:52:05.446 --> 07:52:06.406
Yes.

07:52:06.967 --> 07:52:09.927
And it was convened by Early Edge California.

07:52:09.947 --> 07:52:15.068
Assemblymember McCarty, Gomez-Reyes, and Monique Lemone joined.

07:52:15.108 --> 07:52:19.149
Sarah Neville Morgan from the Department of Education also joined.

07:52:20.249 --> 07:52:24.390
And Toby Boyd and Laurie Easterling were there from CTA.

07:52:24.770 --> 07:52:29.251
Edgar Sanzueta from AXA was present as well and a host of early learning

07:52:30.231 --> 07:52:31.632
advocacy organizations were there.

07:52:31.652 --> 07:52:47.320
It was a really interesting benchmarking of how different state systems look and are structured and are funded, and also weave together LEAs with community-based providers, either center-based providers, family child care homes.

07:52:48.460 --> 07:53:03.027
They have a early childhood block grant that is separate and freestanding from their K-12 allocation in the budget, but 85% of their preschool for all seats are administered by LEAs in Illinois.

07:53:03.788 --> 07:53:05.628
They have high quality learning standards.

07:53:08.829 --> 07:53:24.656
a robust teacher induction program that has been longstanding for many years in Illinois, and they are showing outcomes in early literacy by third grade and ELA scores.

07:53:25.296 --> 07:53:27.277
So it was very eye-opening, very exciting.

07:53:28.558 --> 07:53:40.909
And also, you know, good learning to think about as the early childhood master plan is set to kick off with the governor's office and the state board and CDE all together.

07:53:42.190 --> 07:53:47.575
And then I also will just say I enjoyed immensely working with my fellow board members on the screening committee.

07:53:47.615 --> 07:53:51.159
We were ruthlessly efficient in our calls.

07:53:52.920 --> 07:53:55.723
I so appreciated that, and it was great.

07:53:57.545 --> 07:54:00.127
It is actually really also just lovely to hear.

07:54:00.768 --> 07:54:05.992
People were very, I think, genuinely excited to serve and offer a contribution to the work.

07:54:06.132 --> 07:54:06.813
So thank you.

07:54:16.132 --> 07:54:17.132
Yeah.

07:54:17.813 --> 07:54:19.074
So, is it on?

07:54:19.354 --> 07:54:19.534
Yes.

07:54:19.814 --> 07:54:29.721
So, for the last couple of days, I have been at the Student Advisory Board and Education Conference, and I helped with the student board member selection process.

07:54:30.161 --> 07:54:44.811
I know it's been said before today, Vice President Strauss said it, and I just want to emphasize it again, but these candidates were so amazing, and I just want to congratulate all of them, because they all did amazing, and it was so difficult to get

07:54:45.311 --> 07:54:51.777
it down to three, but I know that whichever one is selected is more than qualified.

07:54:52.158 --> 07:55:00.926
So it was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to seeing who makes it, but also congratulating everybody that was able to participate in the entire process.

07:55:01.747 --> 07:55:02.067
Thank you.

07:55:04.830 --> 07:55:05.691
Member Ortiz-Lacaux.

07:55:07.625 --> 07:55:14.769
So I am a liaison along with Board Member Sun and Board Member Rucker to the Joint Advisory Commission.

07:55:14.829 --> 07:55:15.530
You heard that.

07:55:16.090 --> 07:55:18.611
We also vetted 200 applications.

07:55:18.872 --> 07:55:20.473
Yes, we have a cape hiding behind.

07:55:21.353 --> 07:55:23.094
It was pretty, I mean, it was a lot of work.

07:55:23.134 --> 07:55:25.015
Even my kids were like, are you done with the applications?

07:55:25.375 --> 07:55:28.998
So I think that it's, yeah, it was a lot of our time, but it was great.

07:55:29.078 --> 07:55:34.381
We have amazing educators that want to be part of the process and part of the recommendations.

07:55:35.341 --> 07:55:37.182
So you heard that as well.

07:55:37.362 --> 07:55:43.663
I guess on my page six activities, I deliver the keynote for the California Latino School Boards Association.

07:55:44.123 --> 07:55:52.146
And there is a lot of interest in the model curriculum, the ethnic studies model curriculum, Jose Medina's requirement for ethnic studies.

07:55:52.546 --> 07:55:54.586
There's fear that we're rolling back.

07:55:55.166 --> 07:55:57.087
And so part of what,

07:55:57.947 --> 07:56:05.755
I assure some people was that this is something that we are as eager as most to make sure that we do it and that we do it right.

07:56:06.596 --> 07:56:17.948
So the other thing that came up a lot was Latinos, Latino students, not English learners, but just Latino students and their academic performance and making sure that as we are looking at achievement gaps,

07:56:18.328 --> 07:56:32.251
we are also paying attention to Latino students and not confounding the student populations because we often assume that English learners are Latino students and these are two very different student populations which at times overlap but they have different needs.

07:56:33.411 --> 07:56:40.492
So and also I learned that I was the only in the history of the organization the only state board member who has ever attended.

07:56:40.512 --> 07:56:42.753
So I want to encourage my colleagues

07:56:43.473 --> 07:56:44.614
to participate.

07:56:44.654 --> 07:56:59.320
They have an annual summit in San Diego and it's great to see fellow board members at the local level who are really focused on EO roadmap, the implementation, Latino students and issues that impact our community.

07:56:59.740 --> 07:56:59.980
Thank you.

07:57:04.018 --> 07:57:05.259
I'll bring up the rear.

07:57:06.861 --> 07:57:07.641
I can quickly go.

07:57:09.183 --> 07:57:19.393
So, as Superintendent Thurman noted, there was a panel on looking at data and understanding our achievement trends and our achievement gaps.

07:57:20.113 --> 07:57:23.395
which I participated in just before our meetings began.

07:57:23.415 --> 07:57:33.279
I think that was a really productive conversation, not only about where do we see the gaps and the needs, but also where some of the bright spots and some of the strategies that people are undertaking.

07:57:33.859 --> 07:57:37.821
There's some terrific people there from Riverside County and a number of districts.

07:57:37.861 --> 07:57:42.844
Sanger Unified was represented there, often studied for their progress.

07:57:44.284 --> 07:57:47.866
And so I think, you know, we can continue to learn a lot and when we

07:57:48.166 --> 07:58:09.860
revisit this conversation about how we want to be involved in the leveraging of educator equity and the way in which our ESSA funds are being spent and so we should revisit the question of what enables places that are succeeding with all groups of students to do so and how can we encourage more of those practices elsewhere.

07:58:11.201 --> 07:58:15.406
I was appointed our commissioner to the Education Commission of the States.

07:58:15.426 --> 07:58:17.588
They have a meeting coming up in December.

07:58:17.989 --> 07:58:25.658
They've been already very helpful to us, as Eileen knows, because she's worked with them over the years in helping us get going on some special education.

07:58:27.199 --> 07:58:28.019
examinations.

07:58:28.279 --> 07:58:30.620
This is going to be a big issue for us over the coming year.

07:58:31.400 --> 07:58:33.481
And we can learn a lot from what other states are doing.

07:58:33.541 --> 07:58:44.826
They do a lot of 50 state scans and also do some deep dives within member states and on sort of a whole child approach to early childhood education and to young children.

07:58:44.986 --> 07:58:48.708
So they will be, that will be a theme of their meeting.

07:58:49.748 --> 07:58:55.011
And they're very, by the way, interested in, you know, inviting folks to participate.

07:58:55.051 --> 07:59:04.837
So if anybody's particularly interested in any of these topics, they will have all kinds of working groups and interview processes and, you know, meetings and so on.

07:59:04.877 --> 07:59:06.778
They have many, many kinds of meetings.

07:59:07.358 --> 07:59:13.922
So those are two issues where we will take advantage of their offers of expertise and help.

07:59:14.302 --> 07:59:17.023
And there may be others that we want to raise our hand for down the road.

07:59:17.924 --> 07:59:18.364
Member Burr.

07:59:20.591 --> 07:59:33.060
So you already heard a lot this morning or afternoon, whatever it was, about the work of the collaborative through the system of support item, and I know they'll continue to do that reporting and hopefully bring additional clarity to the work that they're doing.

07:59:34.060 --> 07:59:45.468
The one thing I wanted to call out as the charter liaison is the October 30th memo that was posted to our website, and I want to make sure that everybody has a chance to take a look at that.

07:59:46.188 --> 07:59:50.212
I want to thank the board staff and the department staff for doing that.

07:59:50.633 --> 08:00:00.181
I think you probably know from reading in the press there are substantial, substantive changes to the charter school law, many of which will affect the work of the state board.

08:00:00.221 --> 08:00:07.088
So I would call that out to your attention, actually starting on page three of the memo and throughout the rest of it.

08:00:08.449 --> 08:00:11.412
But it will, for those of you who are excited about that,

08:00:12.252 --> 08:00:15.514
Because it will reduce our role in some ways.

08:00:15.534 --> 08:00:18.596
It will certainly change it materially.

08:00:19.357 --> 08:00:21.458
But it won't do that until July of 2020.

08:00:22.079 --> 08:00:26.722
So between now and July, we will have sort of our regular charter renewal.

08:00:26.742 --> 08:00:28.423
You saw the material revision today.

08:00:28.963 --> 08:00:30.984
And I do know that we have at least one charter.

08:00:31.024 --> 08:00:31.705
I'm looking at Judy.

08:00:32.685 --> 08:00:35.627
that will come up for action in January.

08:00:35.687 --> 08:00:39.410
There may be more, but typically January through March is our busy time.

08:00:40.270 --> 08:00:45.374
But after that, starting in July 1 of 2020, it will change dramatically.

08:00:45.514 --> 08:00:48.035
And for those of you who are working on the screening committee,

08:00:49.136 --> 08:00:56.381
The work of the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools also changes quite a bit, so that's why we have to be very attentive to those appointments.

08:00:56.421 --> 08:01:06.208
So just wanted to make sure that everybody had a chance to read that and kind of absorb it because it is materially changing what we will do relative to charter schools.

08:01:08.524 --> 08:01:09.685
Thank you.

08:01:09.945 --> 08:01:13.509
We will now take up agenda item 16, general public comment.

08:01:14.470 --> 08:01:18.554
Public comment is invited on any matter that was not included on the printed agenda.

08:01:18.774 --> 08:01:20.015
Are there any public comments?

08:01:20.636 --> 08:01:23.679
Will the following speakers please line up at the podium.

08:01:23.859 --> 08:01:28.864
Jennifer Barajas, David Tako, Rachel Navarrete, and Rigel Massaro.

08:01:39.304 --> 08:01:57.033
officer trainer and I'd like to give my time to Jennifer that's okay is that possible make sure the mics are near your mouth hold the mics down a little bit so we can hear you yeah yeah

08:01:59.577 --> 08:02:00.798
Okay, start your minute now.

08:02:01.118 --> 08:02:06.082
So I had officially came in with the whole speech prepared, but I think we're all tired and we're just going to go through it.

08:02:06.142 --> 08:02:08.344
So I'm Jennifer Barajas.

08:02:08.564 --> 08:02:13.188
I am your California State Officer for SkillsUSA, serving as your parliamentarian.

08:02:13.829 --> 08:02:16.131
And I'm here on behalf of SkillsUSA.

08:02:16.171 --> 08:02:18.633
We're officially going to be talking a little bit about Perkins V.

08:02:19.293 --> 08:02:22.516
But I got the word that you guys are going to be talking about that tomorrow.

08:02:22.656 --> 08:02:24.898
But I have school tomorrow, so you'll hear from me today.

08:02:25.619 --> 08:02:28.761
And basically, I just want to tell you my story a little bit.

08:02:29.562 --> 08:02:33.165
You know, the first time I was at a SkillsUSA competition, it was in 2018.

08:02:33.726 --> 08:02:36.888
I was in there for public speaking, and I lost completely.

08:02:36.948 --> 08:02:40.591
I was completely last place, and it devastated me, and it hurt so much.

08:02:41.292 --> 08:02:44.495
And then the next year, I ran for state officer, and I got the position.

08:02:44.555 --> 08:02:45.636
So I don't think it was that bad.

08:02:46.216 --> 08:02:53.825
But SkillsUSA kind of just taught me that confidence level that I needed, those work ethics that I need to keep moving forward in everything I do.

08:02:54.406 --> 08:03:04.277
And I kind of just wanted to point out a little bit that SkillsUSA has allowed us to build that confidence and skills we need in order to go within our... Okay, bye now.

08:03:05.263 --> 08:03:05.523
Oh, okay.

08:03:07.303 --> 08:03:16.385
Okay, so it's allowed us to build the confidence and skills that we need in order to go forth in our professional career and college and or college careers.

08:03:16.966 --> 08:03:21.927
And SkillsUSA is growing rapidly with over 427,000 nationwide members.

08:03:22.867 --> 08:03:31.489
California specifically continues to hold the first place in high school membership and middle school membership, so that's something that we're completely proud of when we go to nationals.

08:03:32.689 --> 08:03:49.218
Washington DC to advocate for career and technical education With the growth of our state's membership 64 new chapters or slash schools have opened up in California So that's going to give the opportunity to hundreds of more students to be able to get that That work ethic that they need those skills

08:03:49.764 --> 08:03:54.429
sorry, the skills that they need to be able to be good workers in the workforce for the United States.

08:03:55.330 --> 08:04:09.845
And despite our 600 business and trade and union partners, over 17,000 classrooms at Conducting Skills USA training, and the growing CT advocates nationwide, we continue to face that stigma that college is the necessary only way that you're going to reach success.

08:04:10.525 --> 08:04:22.374
And I will go to college, and I'm going to study what I want to study in, but SkillsUSA has given me that knowledge and work ethic that I needed to be successful and an exemplary member of the workforce in the U.S.

08:04:22.414 --> 08:04:23.435
and anywhere I end up.

08:04:24.095 --> 08:04:32.681
So we are career and college ready, and that's something that we really want to point out, and especially when we talk about career and technical education, is really pointing out that.

08:04:33.001 --> 08:04:33.462
Thank you.

08:04:36.844 --> 08:04:38.365
Thank you very much.

08:04:38.605 --> 08:04:39.006
Thank you.

08:04:53.338 --> 08:04:55.420
Good evening, Raichel Massaro of Public Advocates.

08:04:55.680 --> 08:04:59.263
I'm making comments on the LCAP template and the California Auditor's Report.

08:04:59.343 --> 08:05:03.646
On the LCAP template, I'm speaking to the letter you received from 14 community-based organizations.

08:05:04.146 --> 08:05:11.972
We have a lot at stake to ensure the LCAP template provides the transparency our communities need to engage in an informed way and meaningfully participate in local control.

08:05:12.473 --> 08:05:16.776
We hope you were able to review the template before the January meeting along with our substantive comments.

08:05:17.316 --> 08:05:25.563
And on the auditor's report, you've heard that released yesterday found that SNC dollars are not benefiting high-needs students as LCFF law and regulations require.

08:05:26.063 --> 08:05:28.525
We urge the board to take up the auditor's recommendations.

08:05:28.946 --> 08:05:30.587
If it does not, the legislature will.

08:05:31.128 --> 08:05:42.397
More must be done on the practice of carrying over unspent supplemental and concentration dollars into the next year for required investments in high-needs students, as well as delineating and evaluating the efficacy of those investments.

08:05:43.398 --> 08:05:51.305
LEAs have the obligation to increase or improve in proportion to the supplemental funds they receive, and if they don't, they need to do more than explain away their shortcomings.

08:05:51.385 --> 08:05:51.766
Thank you.

08:05:51.786 --> 08:05:55.890
I think that's it.

08:05:57.251 --> 08:05:57.651
All right.

08:05:58.732 --> 08:06:03.997
So I now adjourn the November 2019 meeting of the State Board of Education.
