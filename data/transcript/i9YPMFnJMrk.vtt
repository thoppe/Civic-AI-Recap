00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
Good morning. We hereby reconvene the March 2022 meeting of the State Board of Education.

00:10.480 --> 00:14.080
And Brooks, can you please call the roll to reestablish the quorum?

00:14.080 --> 00:17.080
Good morning. Member Bonanca?

00:17.080 --> 00:18.080
Here.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.080
President Darlin-Hammond?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
Here.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.080
Member Escobedo?

00:23.080 --> 00:24.080
Here.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.080
Vice President Glover-Woods?

00:26.080 --> 00:27.080
Here.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.160
Member Lewis?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.160
Present.

00:31.160 --> 00:36.160
Member McQuillan?

00:36.160 --> 00:39.160
Member Olken?

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
Present.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.160
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez?

00:43.160 --> 00:44.160
Present.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.160
Member Petillo-Brownson?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.160
Here.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.160
Member Rodriguez?

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
Present.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.160
We have a quorum.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.160
Terrific.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.240
We are going to be having a public hearing.

00:58.240 --> 01:05.240
And I want to describe the way in which members of the public can dial in for public comment.

01:05.240 --> 01:12.240
You should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what time we will ask for public comment for each item on the agenda and for the hearing.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.240
Public comment will be provided by dialing the phone number and participant access code and then following each of the operator's prompts.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.240
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

01:22.320 --> 01:26.320
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

01:26.320 --> 01:36.320
We will also ask the public calling in for public comment to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they're following the live feed in order to avoid an echoing effect.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.320
Public comment is limited to one minute for each speaker per item.

01:40.320 --> 01:51.320
Item 13 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the Board's agenda.

01:51.400 --> 02:00.400
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on as much as possible to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's virtual meeting.

02:00.400 --> 02:10.400
For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for Board members to raise your hand using the Zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.400
Item 11 is where we're beginning today.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.400
Item 11 is a public hearing regarding the Eagle Collegiate Academy.

02:17.480 --> 02:25.480
And this is to consider revocation of the charter pursuant to California Education Code 47607H.

02:25.480 --> 02:36.480
And the CDE recommendation is that the State Board hold a public hearing on March 10th to consider the final decision to revoke the charter.

02:36.480 --> 02:45.480
If the State Board finds sufficient grounds for revocation, the Department recommends that the State Board adopt the final decision to revoke Attachment 1

02:45.560 --> 02:55.560
and that the State Board provide notice to the ECA Board, the Eagle Collegiate Academy Board, that revocation becomes effective on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022.

02:55.560 --> 03:07.560
If the State Board takes action to revoke the charter, the CDE recommends that the State Board direct Eagle Collegiate Academy to immediately begin the closure procedures set forth in the ECA charter.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.560
This item will be presented by Stephanie Ferland of the CDE.

03:11.560 --> 03:14.560
Stephanie, you may begin.

03:15.560 --> 03:20.560
Thank you.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.560
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and Board members and Chief Deputy Mary Nicely.

03:25.560 --> 03:39.560
As President Darling-Hammond mentioned, today consists of the California State Board of Education holding a public hearing and considering the revocation of the Eagle Collegiate Academy charter.

03:39.640 --> 03:54.640
The CDE's recommendation today is that the SBE adopt the final decision to revoke and that the SBE provide notice to the Eagle Collegiate Academy Board that revocation becomes effective on Wednesday, March 30th, 2022

03:54.640 --> 04:05.640
and direct ECA to immediately begin the closure procedures set forth in the ECA charter and memorandum of understanding between the SBE and ECA.

04:05.720 --> 04:22.720
Just as a reminder, we went over this yesterday, but the grounds for revocation for California Education Code 47607F is that a charter may be revoked if substantial evidence indicates that the charter school did any of the following.

04:22.720 --> 04:28.720
Committed a material violation of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.800
Failed to meet or pursue any of the people's outcomes identified in the charter.

04:32.800 --> 04:38.800
Failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles or engaged in fiscal mismanagement.

04:38.800 --> 04:44.800
Violated any law.

04:44.800 --> 04:54.800
The CDE has provided substantial evidence that ECA engaged in fiscal mismanagement, committed a material violations of the charter, and committed violations of law.

04:54.880 --> 05:01.880
The CDE outlines the specific violations committed by ECA in item five of yesterday's meeting agenda.

05:06.880 --> 05:13.880
So the summary is that the CDE concludes that there is no fiscal viability for ECA moving forward.

05:13.960 --> 05:29.960
Based on the CDE analysis, the CDE estimates that ECA will have an estimated negative ending cash balance of over $480,000 and a negative ending fund balance close to $600,000 by June 2022.

05:30.040 --> 05:46.040
ECA will fail to meet its financial obligations, including but not limited to staff salaries, pension obligations, and benefits by May 2022, and payments beginning in July 2022 will be offset to recover any remaining LCFF overpayment.

05:47.040 --> 05:56.040
The CDE has communicated with the districts of residence for ECA's current students, as well as the Los Angeles County Office of Education.

05:56.120 --> 06:02.120
All are prepared to help ECA's 12 students transition to other educational options within their area.

06:06.120 --> 06:11.120
In conclusion, the CDE recommends that the SBE take the following actions.

06:11.120 --> 06:19.120
Adopt the final decision to revoke the ECA charter and provide notice to the ECA Board that revocation becomes effective on March 30th, 2022.

06:19.200 --> 06:30.200
Direct ECA to immediately begin the closure procedure set forth, as stated earlier, in the charter and the memorandum of understanding between SBE and ECA.

06:35.200 --> 06:38.200
The public comment slide is on the screen.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.200
And that's it for my presentation this morning.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.200
I believe you're on mute, President Darling-Hammond.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.200
Thank you.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.200
I hereby open the public hearing at 8 37 a.m.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.200
We will first hear from representatives of ECA.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.200
They will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

07:05.200 --> 07:13.200
After the presentation from the school, we will open up the phone line for public comment from individuals who are not part of the school's presentation.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.200
Dr. Akoya Johnson, you may begin.

07:19.200 --> 07:23.200
I'm not hearing you.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.200
I'm seeing a slide.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.200
I had to unmute.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.200
All right.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.200
And now we are not seeing the slides yet.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.280
Yes, I have to start sharing it again.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.280
Okay.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
Thank you.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.280
Thank you very much.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.280
I just want to go to play from start.

08:06.280 --> 08:07.280
Yes.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.280
Okay.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.280
Now let's come back.

08:14.280 --> 08:15.280
Screen.

08:18.280 --> 08:33.280
Good morning, Madam President of the California State Board of Education, Dr. Darling-Hammond.

08:33.280 --> 08:37.280
Good morning, honorable State Board members of education.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.280
Good morning, CDE staff.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.280
And I thank you again for hearing us today.

08:42.360 --> 09:02.360
Today I would like to spend time going over the fact that we have received some additional pledges that we shared with CDE that were not included in the results and the reports that they presented.

09:02.440 --> 09:18.440
And so we believe that the notice was sent, but that it included facts that were outdated and that CDE omitted all the recent facts and recent responses that we submitted to them.

09:18.440 --> 09:24.440
And one of them is that we received $530,000 in pledges.

09:24.520 --> 09:37.520
And this is enough to be able to repay the LCFF overpayment, provide the required budget reserve, and thereby eliminating all the fiscal solvency alleged violations.

09:37.520 --> 09:44.520
If you look at that slide in front of you, you would see the items in bold.

09:44.600 --> 09:58.600
With the $530,000 pledges that we received, we would have $85,431 as a net surplus for 2021-22.

09:58.600 --> 10:12.600
We would have a fund balance of $65,087, and we would have a fund balance as a percent of expenses with the $530,000 at 7.06%.

10:12.680 --> 10:23.680
Our team worked really hard with the fundraising campaign that we did, reached out to different groups, and some are still sending us funds to help us keep this school open.

10:23.680 --> 10:41.680
And so as a result of that being the fact that this is the main concern, we believe that we did provide evidence to show that we can be fiscally solvent, but this was not shared and was not reported in the CDE response.

10:41.760 --> 10:57.760
As a result of that, we are showing as well that the facts that were included about the facility did not include the Caltrans information showing that the site has been cleared.

10:57.760 --> 11:09.760
It omitted the fact that our future site has received a Los Angeles County Regional Site Plan approval, which will allow us to begin the process of placing modulus on the site.

11:09.840 --> 11:19.840
We did not continue with that route because CDE required us to find a place we can use right away, and so we went to the church site.

11:19.840 --> 11:35.840
It omitted the floor plan that shows, and this floor plan was reviewed by the California Los Angeles County Regional Planning, Building and Safety Department, and showed the occupant load for it to be used to be up to 76.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.840
That was not shared.

11:37.920 --> 11:45.920
So we believe also that the information about the non-classroom program was also not updated.

11:45.920 --> 11:53.920
The facts are outdated because once we have a facility to use, then that will eliminate the non-classroom based alleged violations.

11:53.920 --> 12:00.920
And we remain confident that we have already addressed the Independent Study Written Agreement alleged violations.

12:01.000 --> 12:21.000
We also show that in terms of enrollment, the information is also outdated because it doesn't show the response that we submitted showing that we have received substantiated registrations that could be used for this school year as well as next school year.

12:21.080 --> 12:31.080
And we're not sure why CDE keeps not adding this information and creating the false impression of any intent on our part not to provide them accurate information.

12:31.080 --> 12:41.080
They know that we make projections, and then they know that we also have to show them who walked down through the door when the school opens.

12:41.080 --> 12:48.080
So as a result of that, we are asking you to please deny the notice of intent to revoke.

12:48.160 --> 12:59.160
We are asking and we are requesting that ECA be allowed to use the Crown Church facility that has been prepared for the students, which has been cleared by Caltrans,

12:59.160 --> 13:11.160
to enroll more students for this school year and to be allowed to complete the remaining five-year term since we have already received 92 applications that could be substantiated for the 2022-23 school year.

13:11.160 --> 13:17.160
We believe that if allowed, we should be able to enroll students again for this school year.

13:18.160 --> 13:40.160
However, should CDE, should SBE, I'm sorry, decide that you would not allow us to continue and that you would go ahead and revoke this charter and deny our students the opportunity to continue,

13:40.240 --> 13:49.240
we are then requesting to surrender this charter as of June 30, 2022 for the following reasons.

13:49.240 --> 14:05.240
We implore your humanity and ask you that you please heed the askance, the pleas of our families and students who have requested and are asking to be allowed to finish out this school year

14:05.320 --> 14:14.320
so that they will not have to be pulled during the middle of the year, which will devastate and disrupt their lives.

14:14.320 --> 14:21.320
We are asking for the students to be allowed to use this facility, which they've been promised for so long,

14:21.320 --> 14:30.320
which we spent considerable time, the families came to put it together, to set it up so that they will be ready for CDE to review.

14:30.400 --> 14:39.400
We do have, contrary to what CDE keeps saying, enough funds to be able to finish out the school year and meet all our obligations.

14:39.400 --> 14:52.400
So for that reason, we're asking for you to please allow us and allow the students to reach the end of the school year should you decide to revoke and then allow us to be able to surrender the charter by then.

14:52.480 --> 15:08.480
Here is the site draw that I was not able to show you yesterday of the current site, the way it was set up, so that you can see that it's really ready to go.

15:08.560 --> 15:17.560
The Caltrans has now cleared it and showing that there is no reason why that can be a viable school site for us.

15:17.560 --> 15:29.560
And it's been set up so that students can use this site and the students and their families were very excited when they came to visit this site and couldn't wait to get in and just start learning.

15:38.560 --> 15:49.560
And it has room and enough space for all the students that we currently have and will have.

15:54.560 --> 15:57.560
And a playground for them as well.

15:57.640 --> 16:18.640
And then as for the next school year, we also have a slide to show you of what we plan to provide our students using the modular classrooms.

16:18.720 --> 16:34.720
The Los Angeles County Department of Regional Planning has approved our site plan review process and we are ready to begin to be able to place modular classrooms here, which is the next phase and we have plenty of time to be able to accomplish that.

16:34.720 --> 16:47.720
Again, our families were looking forward to this site and we're looking forward to starting their new year at this site with the modular buildings that you're watching right now during this tour.

16:47.800 --> 16:54.800
So we do have a place for us to be able to start next school year and we have a plan to be able to do that.

16:54.800 --> 17:07.800
We continue to conduct a vigorous enrollment campaign using paid enrollment companies that know what they are doing in addition to our own efforts of door to door knocking.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.880
We know where our families are.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.880
We have spoken to them.

17:12.880 --> 17:21.880
You have heard them and we are asking you to please, please allow us to finish what you allowed us to start.

17:21.880 --> 17:28.880
We have been trying to get, do everything that CDE has asked us to do.

17:28.960 --> 17:36.960
We have reached out to them to ask in emails that can be substantiated what they need us to do to make this happen.

17:36.960 --> 17:43.960
We generally don't get any response back or we get nothing saying that we could move this forward.

17:43.960 --> 17:49.960
So we have shown the desire to work with CDE to do what they've asked us to do.

17:50.040 --> 17:53.040
And we continue to show that desire.

17:53.040 --> 18:05.040
If you allow us to continue to serve our students and our families and to provide for them this education that they have themselves, they themselves have shown that they are happy with.

18:05.040 --> 18:12.040
And we want to be able to serve more families who are really ready for this to happen.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.040
If you let us.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.040
Thank you.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.040
Thank you.

18:23.040 --> 18:30.040
At this point, we will open the phone line for public comments and we will need the public comments slide displayed.

18:30.040 --> 18:41.040
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this public hearing may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that will be shown momentarily.

18:41.040 --> 18:44.040
I'm going to pause and wait for the slide.

18:50.040 --> 18:57.040
It may be that.

18:57.040 --> 19:02.040
Dr. Koya Johnson, would you mind stop? Thank you so much.

19:10.040 --> 19:18.040
OK, members of the public, we encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record when you call in.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.120
There is the telephone number and the participant access code.

19:21.120 --> 19:29.120
Turn down the speaker volume of your computer if you are following the live feed and speakers will be limited to one minute each.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.120
We also ask, as always, that callers be respectful.

19:32.120 --> 19:38.120
Comments at this time must be related to the item before the board at this time.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.120
Are there any public comments?

19:40.120 --> 19:44.120
Yes, we have about 19 people signed up for public comment.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.120
I will open the phone line now.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.200
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.200
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.200
Hello, can you hear me?

19:57.200 --> 19:58.200
We can.

19:58.200 --> 20:06.200
OK, my name is Adison and I'm the Director of Charter Services for the Actinagua Dulce Unified School District.

20:06.200 --> 20:11.200
I'm here in support of the revocation of Eagle Colleges Academy Charter School.

20:11.280 --> 20:18.280
We work collaboratively to hold operating procedures of our charters at high standards and accountability.

20:18.280 --> 20:28.280
Eagle Colleges Academy has in the past four years made four unsuccessful attempts to obtain approval to establish a charter school within the Actinagua Dulce boundaries.

20:28.280 --> 20:36.280
A great concern to our district has been the charter's consistent inability to give assurances of the appropriate operating requirements for the school.

20:36.360 --> 20:48.360
Inability to provide reasonable enrollment numbers and inability to provide financial plans that do not rely heavily on aggressive initial enrollment and growth to cover its projected expenditures.

20:48.360 --> 21:02.360
Providing additional fiscal support, facilities, and time will not rectify the inherent deficiencies that have been consistent from years with planning and the implementation of Eagle Colleges educational.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.360
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

21:03.440 --> 21:10.440
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

21:10.440 --> 21:22.440
Yes, my name is Gene Stabe. I'm a local pastor here in the Actinagua Dulce area and I am in support of the Eagle Collegiate Academy.

21:22.440 --> 21:30.440
The staff and the administration are excellent. I like the program that they have and it's needed here in our community.

21:30.520 --> 21:38.520
I've been in here this community for over 22 years. The teachers are the best and go the extra mile.

21:38.520 --> 21:45.520
I've witnessed students and teacher interactions and they're well behaved and eager to learn.

21:45.520 --> 21:51.520
And so I just wanted to say this would be wonderful to see them continue to meet here in our community.

21:51.600 --> 22:00.600
And I know they have a facility that's available to them. So I really encourage you to consider them and continue to keep them open. Thank you.

22:00.600 --> 22:06.600
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

22:06.680 --> 22:19.680
Hi, good morning. My name is Ejike Makoye. I'm a father of two children. My kids go to school at Eagle Collegiate Academy.

22:19.680 --> 22:26.680
I'm begging on behalf of them for not shutting down the school because the teachers have a great program for the children.

22:26.680 --> 22:33.680
Since my kids started going to that school, they've been doing good in the academic and they really love going there.

22:33.760 --> 22:40.760
Are we praying for us to continue letting our children go into this school?

22:42.760 --> 22:54.760
Please don't shut down our school. We need it so we can be smarter or we just don't know how to do things that much.

22:54.840 --> 23:01.840
We have to learn things. If we don't have the school, we won't learn things.

23:01.840 --> 23:09.840
And we won't be able to get real school. We just have to go online school. That would be sad.

23:11.840 --> 23:18.840
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

23:24.840 --> 23:29.840
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

23:31.840 --> 23:38.840
Okay, moving on. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation. Your time starts now.

23:41.840 --> 23:48.840
Hello, my name is Jolie. I'm a mother of two kids at ESCA and I'm here to support them.

23:48.920 --> 23:55.920
My kids are really happy with the school. They have been learning so much. The staff, everybody has been so supportive for my kids.

23:56.920 --> 24:06.920
I mentioned this to them last night about closing school and they got really sad and I'm really worried about them emotionally because they're really happy with the teachers.

24:07.920 --> 24:15.920
So I would like you guys to consider this, to leave the school open. I know it's going to be a great opportunity, not just for the kids but for everybody, for our community.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
I mean, there's so much to say about this school and I'm really happy. I'm really thankful for this school, for everybody.

24:24.000 --> 24:35.000
So please consider this and please leave the school open. Give them the opportunity to become somebody, some special kids and people in this community.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
So consider this call, consider this message and thank you so much.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

24:46.000 --> 25:04.000
Yes, my name is Whitney E. Banks. I was looking to enroll my son for the next coming year into this school. Once I saw the curriculum they offered, it's really unmatched in terms of what the other schools in the area are offering.

25:04.080 --> 25:16.080
I was super excited. The idea of smaller classrooms plus being able to have after school care is like beyond needed, especially with folks like me trying to get back out here, get back into work.

25:17.080 --> 25:25.080
And you know, we need that extra help with the after school care. A school like this, it's a shame that it doesn't have a chance to really get off the ground.

25:25.160 --> 25:35.160
If there are small things that can be rectified, it will be awesome. If you guys could just lay it out clearly, give a reasonable time frame and allow the school to actually have a chance to thrive and succeed.

25:36.160 --> 25:50.160
During a pandemic, everything is upside down. The school, you know, from my understanding, kind of started in the midst of all that. It really should be given a fair chance. Education is important and it should be top priority in this country.

25:51.160 --> 25:52.160
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.240
Am I shooting it down like this?

25:54.240 --> 25:55.240
Thank you, caller.

25:56.240 --> 26:00.240
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. You have one minute.

26:00.320 --> 26:21.320
Jeffrey Forrest, board member with Eagle Collegiate Academy, and I'm calling to ask that you give generous consideration to allowing Eagle Collegiate Academy to continue to deliver the kind of excellence and educational stewardship that it has done since it's found.

26:21.400 --> 26:33.400
Yes, it is struggling, but if you go back in history, many of the schools that originally opened throughout our country often had the same exact struggles that Eagle Collegiate Academy have had.

26:34.400 --> 26:46.400
I believe that given this opportunity, we will see that this specific school will provide the kind of equity and access that many of our students who are struggling from communities of color desperately need.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
Thank you, and we appreciate your consideration.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
Thank you.

26:51.400 --> 26:56.400
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

26:59.400 --> 27:06.400
Good morning. My name is Ken Higginbotham, president, board of directors for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

27:06.480 --> 27:28.480
It is imperative that you allow this exceptional institution of learning for these children and in some cases in underlying areas to have the education that they deserve.

27:28.560 --> 27:39.560
You know, if you shut it down right now, you are depriving all of these children and the family of the opportunity to excel.

27:40.560 --> 27:48.560
You've heard the comments and you've heard the statements made that are totally, totally justifiable.

27:48.640 --> 27:59.640
I highly encourage you allow us to move forward and provide better students, which are better citizens. Thank you.

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
Thank you.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

28:05.720 --> 28:16.720
Good morning. My name is Dawn Hakeem, and I am calling to voice my support for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

28:17.720 --> 28:24.720
There is not another high performing, high test score charter school in this area.

28:24.800 --> 28:39.800
And not only that, the opportunity to be in a primary year's international baccalaureate program, this is something that these kids will benefit from for a lifetime.

28:39.880 --> 28:59.880
I please urge you, beg you to consider giving us a chance, letting us get into a location and then see how it goes because there are so many people working behind the scenes with passion that I am confident it will be a success.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
Thank you for your consideration.

29:03.880 --> 29:04.880
Thank you.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.880
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

29:09.880 --> 29:27.880
Good morning. This is Jack Ritter, and I just ask you please provide the ability to use the approved facility to help us finish out the year and not stop the student's development and thus allowing the school the opportunity to enroll more students.

29:28.880 --> 29:31.880
I just hope that you think about the students. Thank you for your consideration.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.880
Thank you.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.880
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

29:39.880 --> 29:53.880
Hi, my name is Ashley Cussell. I am the second and third grade teacher at Eco Collegiate Academy, and I just want to please ask you to please help ECA and please allow them to remain open.

29:54.880 --> 30:06.880
These students will be devastated if the school closes. They're doing so well. They're learning so much, and the idea of having them have to start at a brand new school in the middle of the year is so heartbreaking for them.

30:06.960 --> 30:23.960
I ask that you please allow the school to continue and to allow these families to get the chance to get their students into a school that is now in person and that is basically everything that these students have been dreaming of and these parents have been dreaming of.

30:24.040 --> 30:38.040
Please do not shut the school down, and if there is a chance that it has to be shut down, please let the students stay till the end of the school year. Don't have them have to uproot their lives in the middle of the school year. They're doing so well.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.040
Please think about the children. Thank you.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.040
Thank you.

30:43.040 --> 30:47.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
Caller, you're live.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
Go ahead.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
Yes, thank you so much.

30:53.120 --> 30:58.120
My name is Eliana Howe, and I'm here to voice my support for ECA.

30:59.120 --> 31:12.120
And basically, I know this is a brand new school, and it's just everything that the parents have been dreaming to have in this area is going to be as new as possible.

31:12.200 --> 31:23.200
I think that the parents have been dreaming to have in this area is going to be a nice safe location for them to send their children to, and they will have an after school program.

31:24.200 --> 31:29.200
And it's just an amazing academic program they have going.

31:29.280 --> 31:36.280
Also, I have been there myself, and I think it's an amazing place.

31:37.280 --> 31:42.280
And also, I have seen the students in the classroom, and they are doing amazing.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.280
Please keep the school open. Thank you.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.280
Thank you.

31:47.280 --> 31:51.280
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

31:51.360 --> 31:58.360
Hi, good morning. My name is Johanna Chavez, and I'm a mother of second grade students.

31:59.360 --> 32:06.360
I'm asking you please to support ECA, and consider it to be open.

32:07.360 --> 32:16.360
I see in our Dulce we don't have too many schools, and I applied for I leave once, and my kids still in the waiting list.

32:16.440 --> 32:27.440
And I see the other schools that are closest to me is in action, and it's a little bit hard for me because I have another busy middle school.

32:28.440 --> 32:35.440
And please give a chance to have another option in our area. Thank you.

32:36.440 --> 32:37.440
Thank you.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.440
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

32:41.520 --> 32:50.520
Hi, my name is Ruth Posey, community member. I'm calling to support Eagle Collegiate Academy.

32:51.520 --> 32:58.520
At this point in the school year, I think it would be unfair to the children and the families to interrupt instruction.

32:59.520 --> 33:09.520
The kids and the families deserve to go to this school, and the kids definitely deserve to continue learning and thriving with their classmates and teachers.

33:09.600 --> 33:14.600
So please consider keeping the school open. Thank you.

33:15.600 --> 33:16.600
Thank you.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.600
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

33:23.600 --> 33:28.600
Hi, my name is Kristen, and I support Eagle Collegiate Academy.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.600
Please consider keeping the school open for the children and the community.

33:33.680 --> 33:41.680
Again, it would be sad and a shame to close the school down, especially in the middle of school year.

33:42.680 --> 33:50.680
The school has a great education program, and it's good for the community. The teachers, the staff, and the students are doing well.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.680
Please don't shut the school down. Thank you.

33:54.680 --> 33:55.680
Thank you.

33:56.680 --> 33:59.680
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

33:59.760 --> 34:06.760
Hello, my name is Isabella, and I support Eagle Collegiate Academy.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.760
I support their mission and their values, their strong core values.

34:13.760 --> 34:20.760
I see how caring and dedicated the ECA staff is to one another, especially to students and families.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.760
And I know that my children will receive a quality education.

34:24.840 --> 34:32.840
So I ask that you please consider keeping the school open for the children, especially the students of color and the community,

34:33.840 --> 34:42.840
because of the rigorous education that is not widely available in the community, especially in the International Baccalaureate Program

34:43.840 --> 34:48.840
and the multiple languages, Korean and Spanish, not really seen in this community.

34:48.920 --> 35:02.920
And it would really help if you keep it for this year and for the next year if they are in person and they experience ECA as it should be, as it is.

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
Thank you, caller.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.920
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

35:10.000 --> 35:23.000
Hi, my name is Brandi Ervin, and I am a mother of a pre-K student at ECA, and me and my family support this wonderful school and the staff and administration.

35:24.000 --> 35:34.000
We are more than dedicated to this school. My daughter has been thriving and learning and just loving everything that ECA has to offer.

35:34.080 --> 35:47.080
I believe that if we're able to get this school open and let the kids really come in and experience what this developmental plan and all the things that they have to offer the kids,

35:48.080 --> 35:59.080
it can really go really far, and I'm more than certain more parents will come and really be able to see what ECA has to offer and more students will be able to be a part of this wonderful program.

35:59.160 --> 36:09.160
So please leave this school open. Give them a chance. Let us open up. Let our kids really experience all the great academics they have to offer. Thank you.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.160
Thank you.

36:12.160 --> 36:15.160
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

36:15.240 --> 36:25.240
Good morning, State Board members. My name is Lorraine Richards, and I am a classroom teacher representing California Teachers Association.

36:26.240 --> 36:32.240
CTA supports the CDE's recommendation that the State Board adopt the final decision to revoke the ECA charter.

36:33.240 --> 36:42.240
As stated by my colleague yesterday, the issues that CDE outlined in the item are egregious and led to ECA being overfunded by almost half a million.

36:42.320 --> 36:56.320
ECA's shifting attendance actions are reminiscent of the A3 scandal, and we believe it would be prudent for the CDE to investigate ECA's actions to determine if it was growth mismanagement, growth incompetence, or fraud.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.320
As educators, we are deeply committed to the success of each student.

37:01.400 --> 37:12.400
That is why we urge the State Board to send a message that these types of actions will not only be punished via revocation actions, but also with legal actions whenever warranted. Thank you.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.400
Thank you.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.400
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

37:19.480 --> 37:35.480
Good morning. My name is Uza Makamadziski. I'm just asking the Board to allow ECA to be opened and not to close it.

37:36.480 --> 37:43.480
I beg you guys to please allow them some time to put in place everything that is required of them, because the school is exceptional.

37:43.560 --> 37:53.560
They offer good curriculum, and kids there love everything about the school. So please think about the children and let the school remain open. Thank you.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
Thank you.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.560
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

37:59.640 --> 38:15.640
Hi, my name is Anna Ward. I'm a parent of a third grader, Andrew, and I please ask that you continue to have Eagle Community School open.

38:16.640 --> 38:22.640
My son has been thriving, and I wish that you could give him an opportunity to soar in an interesting environment.

38:22.720 --> 38:35.720
He was a home school child. He has been thriving in this environment, and I believe that if you take this away from him, he will take back steps into what he was a couple of years ago.

38:36.720 --> 38:49.720
So I really plead that you continue to give him an opportunity. It just sunk in in his brain that his school might be closing, and he was not happy. He was very upset in learning that his school might be closing. Thank you.

38:50.720 --> 38:51.720
Thank you.

38:52.720 --> 38:57.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

Caller with the last four digits of the number 6831, you are live. Please start your public comment now.

39:12.800 --> 39:22.800
Okay, moving on. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

39:25.800 --> 39:39.800
Hello, my name is Jenny Gonzalez. I'm a parent of a third grader. His name is Jaden Gonzalez, and this morning he was very upset, and he's like, mommy, we need to call because I don't want my school to be closed.

39:39.880 --> 39:59.880
I believe that they need an opportunity to have a physical building and to build more relationship with their peers as they're being doing now through the computer. There's an excellent chance for growth. Please give us the opportunity. Don't close the school. Thank you.

40:00.880 --> 40:01.880
Thank you.

40:02.880 --> 40:06.880
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

40:09.880 --> 40:20.880
Caller ending in the last four digits, 1-0-0-0. Please start your public comment now.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.880
Okay, it looks like nobody is on the line. That concludes public comment for item number 11.

40:28.960 --> 40:34.960
Thank you very much.

40:35.960 --> 40:46.960
At this point, with no further public comments, I'd like to close the public hearing at 9-10 a.m., and we will now begin board discussion.

40:47.960 --> 40:53.960
And I'd like to ask our liaison, Vice President Glover-Woods, if she would like to make some initial comments.

40:54.040 --> 40:57.040
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

40:58.040 --> 41:14.040
I'd first like to just reiterate my appreciation for all of the callers that called in today for public comment, the students, the families, the staff of Eagle Collegiate Academy, as well as others who have voiced their thoughts and ideas.

41:14.120 --> 41:24.120
I do want to underscore something that I said on yesterday, which is my ongoing concern for the fiscal viability and solvency for the school.

41:25.120 --> 41:36.120
I have a few clarifying questions that I'd like to ask when we open up for discussion, and I will hold my questions until other board members have a chance to ask as well.

41:36.200 --> 41:58.200
The last point that I'd like to make before we go into our discussion is the acknowledgement of the school districts in the area and the Los Angeles County Office of Education who have indicated that they will be assisting any families should the board decide to revoke the charter during this school year.

41:58.280 --> 42:16.280
They will be in assistance to quickly ensure that any students enrolled in Eagle Collegiate Academy are enrolled in a local school area per what is wanted and decided by their families, so I do appreciate that as well.

42:17.280 --> 42:26.280
At this time, President Darling-Hammond, I will hold my additional comments and my questions until my fellow board members have opportunity to ask and discuss as well.

42:26.360 --> 42:27.360
Thank you.

42:27.360 --> 42:28.360
All right.

42:28.360 --> 42:36.360
While I'm looking for, please use the raise hand function to let me know if you want to make a comment.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
Member McQuillin.

42:39.360 --> 42:47.360
Thank you, and I want to thank all the callers for calling in also to try to support their school.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.360
I appreciate all the callers.

42:50.360 --> 42:52.360
I have a clarifying question if I can ask.

42:53.360 --> 42:54.360
Please do.

42:54.440 --> 43:10.440
In the report from CDE staff, we heard, I think I heard 12 students were attending in November, and it sounded like most of the learning was occurring online, and is that still the case this month of March?

43:10.440 --> 43:11.440
Do we know?

43:12.440 --> 43:13.440
It is.

43:14.440 --> 43:15.440
Thank you.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.440
We have Member Lewis and Member Escobedo.

43:21.440 --> 43:22.440
Member Lewis.

43:24.440 --> 43:35.440
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and thank you for Dr. Johnson for the presentation and also for the callers.

43:36.440 --> 43:40.440
I just have a clarifying question and then just one initial question.

43:40.520 --> 43:55.520
ECA talks about the acquisition of the $530,000 in pledges, and we have the concern about ongoing fiscal, meeting those fiscal obligations.

43:56.520 --> 44:09.520
And so going forward, I mean, we have to look beyond this year and into future years, and I think Vice President Glover Woods answered my question, but I just want to ask straight out.

44:09.600 --> 44:17.600
We are still concerned about fiscal responsibilities and the charter being able to meet those going forward.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
Am I correct?

44:19.600 --> 44:24.600
The $530 in pledges would just help them take care of obligations in current year?

44:25.600 --> 44:26.600
Is that correct?

44:27.600 --> 44:28.600
It is.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.600
We don't have any.

44:32.600 --> 44:36.600
The information about those pledges came in, actually, while I was presenting yesterday.

44:36.680 --> 44:45.680
So we don't have anything formal in terms of the pledges or whether these pledges can be verified, that sort of thing.

44:45.680 --> 45:03.680
But given even giving the school the benefit of the doubt that they certainly can get these this this money, typically what the department does is they don't include soft money in in budgeting analysis just for the reasons that you outlined Member Lewis.

45:03.760 --> 45:12.760
And yes, even if giving them the benefit of the doubt and that they would be able to receive this money from the pledges, they would still be in the red at the end of the school year.

45:12.760 --> 45:21.760
And it would and yes, it would not dig them out of out of the fiscal hole that they're in.

45:22.760 --> 45:23.760
OK, thank you for that.

45:23.840 --> 45:24.840
Thank you for that.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.840
And if I could, I have one more question, please.

45:27.840 --> 45:35.840
The your suggestion or request to extend the closure date to June 30th.

45:35.840 --> 45:44.840
What fiscal impacts would that place on them or or additional fiscal impacts or or deficits?

45:44.840 --> 45:49.840
I guess if we extended it to that day, if that was even considered.

45:49.840 --> 45:50.840
Right.

45:50.920 --> 45:59.920
Well, based on our analysis, they will not have enough money to make it to the end of the school year.

46:00.920 --> 46:19.920
And so I'm not sure and I'm sure Judy Sias can can weigh in if she needs to, but I'm not sure what the liability is for the board or the department if they do run out of money and cannot pay their expenses and their teacher salaries and retirement benefits and all of that that goes along with that.

46:20.920 --> 46:28.920
But our analysis shows that they will not they will not be able to sustain through the end of the school year.

46:29.920 --> 46:37.920
It's not wanting to close the school in the middle of school year is not something that you would want to do unless there was no other option.

46:38.920 --> 46:39.920
Thank you.

46:42.920 --> 46:44.920
Judy, did you want to weigh in on that?

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Yes, Judy Sias, Chief Counsel for the State Board.

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
Based on CDE's projections, they will run out of money in May.

46:54.000 --> 47:07.000
Again, as Stephanie testified yesterday, there are some concerns about whether or not they will have sufficient funds to meet their obligations for staff salaries, staff benefits, health and health benefits, as well as pension benefits.

47:07.080 --> 47:10.080
In the past, there has been some question about liability.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.080
Should pension benefits not be made?

47:14.080 --> 47:17.080
Whether it falls onto the county office of education or the state.

47:18.080 --> 47:22.080
So it gets pretty complicated when the pension obligations are not met.

47:22.080 --> 47:30.080
And obviously, when staff salaries and benefits aren't able to be met, that also can create quite a few problems for the school and the staff.

47:31.080 --> 47:32.080
Thank you.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.080
Member Escobedo?

47:34.160 --> 47:56.160
Actually, that was one of my comments is, you know, they have 4.5 FTEs with 12 students and the expenditures even and if they obtain a school site, the expenditures then will increase even further, will increase further and the gap will just widen.

47:56.240 --> 48:09.240
So my understanding there has been no attempt in decreasing expenditures or increasing revenues, is that right, Stephanie, and that they will lose, they will run out of money by May.

48:10.240 --> 48:17.240
That is our analysis and you're correct and I'm sure member Glover-Woods can attest to this.

48:17.320 --> 48:42.320
This was a conversation that the ACCS also had during their discussions in terms of the number of staff they had for the small amount of students and whether they've made the appropriate reductions in expenditures for what they have and we have found that they have not.

48:42.400 --> 48:55.400
And typically when a charter is closed, we liquidate assets and my understanding there are no assets at this point.

48:56.400 --> 49:02.400
They don't own a facility and they don't have much left in their bank account.

49:02.480 --> 49:12.480
And so there wouldn't be too many assets as far, I mean, we really need to do a total review of it, but I don't think there are many.

49:13.480 --> 49:14.480
Thank you.

49:16.480 --> 49:21.480
Are there any other questions or comments from members of the Board?

49:22.480 --> 49:26.480
Member Patio-Bronson and then go ahead, please.

49:26.480 --> 49:55.560
I just want to appreciate all the callers who voiced their concern and also appreciation of what the school has provided thus far and also recognize that I think that the leaders of the school and the teachers have had the best of intentions, have tried to bring forward something that is innovative and responsive to the opportunity to grow something new and exciting.

49:56.560 --> 50:16.560
And also at the same time recognize that part of running a school system is more than that and it requires a level of oversight of the finances and the facilities that we just aren't seeing and I do think there have been multiple

50:16.640 --> 50:34.640
Outreaches to the school to try and help them cure some of these challenges, but we have a fiduciary responsibility as board members to actually ensure that it is not just innovation, but it's innovation that can actually live within the bounds of a public use of funds.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.640
The one question I did want to ask

50:38.720 --> 50:50.720
and a number of callers I think reference this is if you can just talk a little bit more about what the options are for families as they navigate what happens at the end of March 31st.

50:51.720 --> 50:55.720
In part, it seems like there might be some misinformation as to what

50:55.800 --> 51:05.800
families believe their options to be that they have to do online only as their only resource or option and if CD folks could talk to that.

51:06.800 --> 51:17.800
Certainly, so we have determined the districts of residence for all of the 12 students who are currently enrolled in ECA.

51:17.880 --> 51:33.880
We have reached out to each of the districts where those students reside and have gotten written confirmation from each of those districts that they are ready and willing to place students in classroom based instruction if that's what they choose immediately.

51:33.960 --> 51:53.960
We've also received written confirmation and you heard from Los Angeles County Office of Ed yesterday that they are also ready to work not only with the districts and helping them place students, but with the families themselves for any district programs or any charter also if they want to remain in a charter school, there are lots of charter options in Los Angeles County.

51:54.040 --> 52:08.040
That may not even be in the districts that the students reside in, but may be accessible to them. So LA County Office of Education also is ready to help place families in the appropriate in the appropriate educational options and certainly those could be classrooms and classrooms.

52:08.040 --> 52:12.080
be accessible to them, so LA County Office of Education

52:12.080 --> 52:16.480
also is ready to help place families

52:16.480 --> 52:21.040
in the appropriate educational options.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.680
And certainly, those could be classroom-based,

52:24.680 --> 52:26.880
or if they wish to stay in non-classroom-based,

52:26.880 --> 52:29.880
there can be non-classroom-based programs found for them.

52:29.880 --> 52:36.880
Are there any other questions or comments

52:36.880 --> 52:37.880
from board members?

52:37.880 --> 52:40.880
Member Glover-Woods?

52:40.880 --> 52:41.880
Thank you.

52:41.880 --> 52:43.880
Just a couple of clarification questions

52:43.880 --> 52:45.880
for Director McFarland.

52:45.880 --> 52:50.880
Could you let us know if you have received

52:50.880 --> 52:53.880
the evidence of the Caltrans approval

52:53.880 --> 52:57.880
that was mentioned during the presentation,

52:58.880 --> 53:02.880
as well as do we have information or evidence

53:02.880 --> 53:07.880
of a property that has been secured for the modulars

53:07.880 --> 53:12.880
that were indicated for the 22-23 school year?

53:12.880 --> 53:17.880
So no, we have not received any formal communication

53:17.880 --> 53:21.880
as required by statute from Caltrans.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.880
I understand that the director of the school

53:24.880 --> 53:26.880
has communicated informally

53:26.880 --> 53:28.880
with one of the consultants at Caltrans,

53:28.880 --> 53:31.880
but EdCode requires Caltrans to send

53:31.880 --> 53:34.880
the Department of Education a formal notice

53:34.880 --> 53:37.880
of approval or disapproval within 30 days,

53:37.880 --> 53:40.880
and we have not yet received that.

53:40.880 --> 53:44.880
And in terms of a facility, no,

53:44.880 --> 53:49.880
they do not have a facility already leased for next year.

53:49.880 --> 53:54.880
We did just two days ago check with the realtor

53:54.880 --> 53:58.880
of the lot that Dr. Johnson mentioned earlier,

53:58.880 --> 54:01.880
and while they did have a lease with them

54:01.880 --> 54:02.880
earlier in the school year,

54:02.880 --> 54:04.880
that lease is no longer valid.

54:04.880 --> 54:07.880
So as of this moment right now,

54:07.880 --> 54:08.880
as far as we know,

54:08.880 --> 54:11.880
they do not have a lease for the next school year,

54:11.880 --> 54:16.880
nor do they have modulars already rented

54:16.880 --> 54:17.880
and ready to go.

54:17.880 --> 54:21.880
Right now that lot is a completely empty lot.

54:21.880 --> 54:23.880
And just for the record,

54:23.880 --> 54:25.880
that lot is in the same area

54:25.880 --> 54:29.880
as the current facility that they're leasing,

54:29.880 --> 54:30.880
which is a short-term lease.

54:30.880 --> 54:34.880
So the current lease will end at the end of June,

54:34.880 --> 54:38.880
and will have the same aeronautics requirement.

54:38.880 --> 54:43.880
So they will still need to get a Caltrans clearance

54:43.880 --> 54:47.880
on the new lot as well before they lease anything new,

54:47.880 --> 54:51.880
if it's the same lot that we're thinking of.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.880
So as of today,

54:52.880 --> 54:55.880
they do not have a lot already leased

54:55.880 --> 54:58.880
and ready to go for next school year.

55:03.880 --> 55:06.880
Any further questions or discussion from the Board?

55:14.880 --> 55:19.880
Then I see that Dr. Okoye Johnson would like to,

55:19.880 --> 55:20.880
who's been raising her hand,

55:20.880 --> 55:22.880
can I ask you for,

55:24.880 --> 55:27.880
whether you have a last statement you wanna make?

55:27.880 --> 55:30.880
Yes, ma'am, and thank you for the opportunity.

55:32.880 --> 55:35.880
I'd like to address certain things that has been mentioned

55:35.880 --> 55:38.880
that are not really completely accurate.

55:38.880 --> 55:42.880
While Caltrans has now sent its official,

55:42.880 --> 55:45.880
quote unquote, report,

55:45.880 --> 55:48.880
Caltrans has sent an email

55:48.880 --> 55:51.880
from the Office of Chief of Airports,

55:51.880 --> 55:56.880
letting the CDE facility consultant,

55:56.880 --> 55:58.880
as well as other staff,

55:58.880 --> 56:03.880
know that the site is clear and could be used.

56:03.880 --> 56:07.880
And we'll be sending this report within the next few days,

56:07.880 --> 56:10.880
because of the timeframe involved

56:10.880 --> 56:13.880
of putting all the report together to send to CDE.

56:13.880 --> 56:18.880
So CDE has been notified officially via email

56:18.880 --> 56:22.880
that this site is ready, that's one.

56:22.880 --> 56:27.880
As it relates to the pledges that we received

56:27.880 --> 56:28.880
and are continuing to receive,

56:28.880 --> 56:33.880
because we were really pushing and fighting to stay alive,

56:35.880 --> 56:38.880
we know that we can

56:39.880 --> 56:44.880
and be able to retain and contain ECA

56:44.880 --> 56:46.880
continuing past this school year.

56:47.880 --> 56:50.880
I am not sure who CDE reached out to.

56:50.880 --> 56:52.880
We're not dealing with routers.

56:52.880 --> 56:54.880
We are really working directly

56:54.880 --> 56:56.880
with the owner of the facility,

56:56.880 --> 56:59.880
who happens at this point in time to be in Egypt,

56:59.880 --> 57:01.880
out of the country.

57:01.880 --> 57:04.880
And he has told ECA

57:04.880 --> 57:09.880
that he will lead that lot to us,

57:10.880 --> 57:11.880
that we do not need,

57:11.880 --> 57:15.880
because having a lease involves continuing to pay them.

57:15.880 --> 57:18.880
And he said, I understand your predicament.

57:18.880 --> 57:21.880
I don't want you to continue to pay me,

57:21.880 --> 57:26.880
but I want you to know that this lot is available for you

57:27.880 --> 57:30.880
and I will work with you to make that happen.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.880
We are not working with the routers.

57:32.880 --> 57:35.880
So I'm not exactly sure who CDE talked to.

57:35.880 --> 57:40.880
And then as he relates to the current site,

57:41.880 --> 57:44.880
you saw in the video that it has been set up.

57:45.880 --> 57:48.880
Considerable amount of time and funds

57:48.880 --> 57:51.880
were invested in setting this up

57:51.880 --> 57:53.880
so that CDE would come and see it.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.880
It is ready for the students to use.

57:56.880 --> 57:58.880
And you heard the parents.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.880
We know that we will get more students to join us

58:01.880 --> 58:05.880
for the rest of the year, if allowed to do so.

58:05.880 --> 58:06.880
Thank you.

58:06.880 --> 58:07.880
Thank you very much for your comments.

58:07.880 --> 58:08.880
We appreciate that.

58:08.880 --> 58:10.880
We appreciate all the callers.

58:11.880 --> 58:14.880
Is there a motion from the Board?

58:17.880 --> 58:18.880
Member Glover Woods.

58:19.880 --> 58:21.880
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

58:21.880 --> 58:26.880
I move that the CDE recommendation

58:26.880 --> 58:29.880
to adopt the final decision to revoke

58:30.880 --> 58:33.880
to also provide notice to the Eagle Collegiate Board

58:33.880 --> 58:36.880
that replication becomes effective on March 30th

58:37.880 --> 58:39.880
and also to direct Eagle Collegiate

58:39.880 --> 58:43.880
to immediately begin closure procedures set forth

58:43.880 --> 58:46.880
in their charter and the memorandum of understanding

58:46.880 --> 58:48.880
with the State Board of Education.

58:50.880 --> 58:51.880
Thank you.

58:51.880 --> 58:52.880
Is there a second?

58:53.880 --> 58:55.880
I will second.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.880
Thank you.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.880
Any further discussion?

58:59.880 --> 59:00.880
All right.

59:00.880 --> 59:03.880
Brooks, will you please call the roll for a vote?

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
Member Bonanca.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.880
Aye.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.880
President Darling-Hammond.

59:10.880 --> 59:11.880
Yes.

59:11.880 --> 59:12.880
Member Escobedo.

59:13.880 --> 59:14.880
Yes.

59:14.880 --> 59:15.880
Vice President Glover Woods.

59:16.880 --> 59:17.880
Yes.

59:18.880 --> 59:19.880
Member Lewis.

59:20.880 --> 59:21.880
Yes.

59:21.880 --> 59:22.880
Member McQuillan.

59:23.880 --> 59:24.880
Aye.

59:24.880 --> 59:25.880
Member Olken.

59:25.880 --> 59:28.880
Abstain due to absence yesterday.

59:29.880 --> 59:30.880
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

59:31.880 --> 59:32.880
Yes.

59:33.880 --> 59:34.880
Member Petillo-Brownson.

59:35.880 --> 59:36.880
Yes.

59:36.880 --> 59:37.880
Member Rodriguez.

59:38.880 --> 59:39.880
Yes.

59:39.880 --> 59:40.880
The motion passes.

59:43.880 --> 59:44.880
Thank you.

59:44.880 --> 59:47.880
I know it is very difficult when there are so many good

59:47.880 --> 59:52.880
efforts underway to have to consider all of the fiduciary

59:52.880 --> 59:57.880
aspects of running a school, but we hope that the program

59:57.880 --> 01:00:02.880
that has been developed will find its way into one of the

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.880
neighboring schools and be available to students because

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.880
the work is, it goes on, even when it does not go on in a

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:14.880
particular site or a particular facility.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:20.880
Let me, at this point, move us to item 12, which is approval

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:25.880
of the fiscal year 2021-22 career technical education

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.880
incentive grant allocations, including the allocation formula,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.880
specific funding amounts and number of grant awards, the

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.880
purposes for grant fund use, and allowable and not allowable

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.880
expenditures.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:43.880
And I am going to pass the ball to Pete Callis of the CDE.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.880
And Pete, you may begin.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
Good morning.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.880
I am just loading up my slides real quick.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.880
Okay.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.880
Good morning, President Darlin-Hammond, State Board

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.880
members, Superintendent Thurmond and Chief Deputy

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.880
Nicely.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.880
I am Pete Callis, the division director over the career

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.880
college transition division.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:24.880
I am here to present the career technical education incentive

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.880
grant program allocations.

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:32.880
Also joining me is my administrator over the CDE

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:35.880
leadership office, Colby Franklin.

01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:39.880
So we will begin with our presentation.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.880
The California Department of Education recommends approval

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.880
of the round 7A of the career technical education incentive

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:54.880
grant program 2021-22 allocations.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:03.880
So I will be doing an overview of the program, reviewing the

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:07.880
new allocation application requirements, and then an

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.880
example of how the allocation calculation works.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:17.880
So the career technical education incentive grant

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:21.880
program was established as a state education economic and

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.880
workforce development program.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:30.880
For grades, kindergarten through grade 12, with the knowledge

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.880
and skills necessary to provide pupils in kindergarten through

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:39.880
grades 12, with the knowledge and skills necessary to

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.880
transition to employment and post-secondary education.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:48.880
Funding began in 2015, and it was a three-year program back

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880
then.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.880
It was $900 million over three years.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:57.880
The first year, 2015-16, $450 million with a one-to-one

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.880
required match for LEAs.

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.880
2016-17, there were $300 million distributed with a 1-to-1.5-to-1

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.880
match required for the LEAs.

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:15.880
And 2017-18, it was $150 million distributed with a 2-to-1

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.880
match.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.880
The legislature for 2018-19 made this an ongoing program for

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.880
California, with $150 million ongoing and a required 2-to-1

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:29.880
match for each of the LEAs.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:35.880
For this current school year, for 2021-22, the funds were

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:39.880
doubled to $300 million as ongoing with a 2-to-1 match

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.880
required for each of the LEAs.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.880
So for 2021, the CTIG allocation funding, CTIG is a formula-based

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.880
competitive grant program.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.880
70% of the formula for allocation, calculation of allocations,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.880
is based on the LEA's average daily attendance, their ADA.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.880
30% of the formula is based on eight positive considerations.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.880
Four of the positive considerations have a 5% weight to

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:22.880
them, and they include organizations managed by a joint

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880
power authority.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:28.880
Also, another one is for their unduplicated pupil count, also

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:32.880
high dropout rate, and high unemployment rate for their

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.880
region.

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.880
There are three positive considerations that are weighted at

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.880
2%.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.880
One of them is for rural LEAs.

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:45.880
Another one is for leveraging programs such as Perkins,

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.880
California Partnership Academies, and the agriculture incentive

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.880
grant program.

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:56.880
And the third piece of that is for investment in CTE equipment,

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.880
facilities, and anything else related to CTE.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:06.880
The third positive consideration is weighted at 4%, and that's for

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.880
collaboration, LEAs that collaborate with post-secondary

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.880
programs.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.880
We had three funding groups.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.880
4% of the funds were earmarked, which is approximately $12 million,

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.880
and that's designated for LEAs with average daily attendance of less

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.880
than or equal to 140 students.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:34.880
8% of the funds, which is $24 million, is designated for applicants

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.880
with average daily attendance of more than 140, but less than equal

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:41.880
to 550.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:47.880
And then 88% of the funding, which is approximately $264 million, is

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:52.880
designated for applicants with average daily attendance of more than

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:53.880
550.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:00.880
For 2021-22, CTE was determined by the formula calculation or the

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.880
LEA match, and they received a lower amount of those two numbers.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.880
Also this year, there was language added to our Ed code for the CTE

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.880
incentive grant program, which states that we cannot provide any more

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:22.880
funds above the formula calculation for their allocation.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:29.880
So in CTIG 2021-22, round 7A, which is this current year, funds

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:34.880
available were approximately $300 million, and that's the amount of

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:38.880
funds we had for the CTE incentive grant program.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.880
We had $300 million.

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:49.880
Apologize for not having it on full screen.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.880
370 total applications were submitted.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:07:00.880
342 of those 370 were approved, and our distribution for this round in

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:03.880
2021-22 is just over $240 million.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:09.880
We did have remaining funds for this year of just over $59 million, so

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:14.880
we ran a round 2, which is round 7B, and we received a total of 40

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:15.880
applications.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:19.880
Those are being scored currently, and we will bring those grant

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:26.880
allocations to the May State Board of Education.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:34.880
There were some changes to this year's application program for the CTE

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:36.880
incentive grant.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:41.880
Total funding, as I said, doubled to $300 million from $150 million.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.880
Also this year, in previous years, the match was allowed to be encumbered

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.880
over the two-year grant timeline.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:53.880
This year, the match must be encumbered during the first year of the grant.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:59.880
CTE was required to post the CTE allocations at least 30 days before

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:04.880
submitting the list recommended new and renewal grant recipients to the

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:07.880
state board for review and approval.

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.880
That was posted 30 days prior, our preliminary list.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:15.880
We did have to make some adjustments to ADAs for the consortiums that had

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:22.880
applied, so we submitted or we posted an updated list on February 28th.

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:28.880
Also a change in this year's application requirements was that LEAs can

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.880
include in the CTE pathways advanced placement programs that are CTE-based,

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:39.880
international baccalaureate programs that were CTE-based, or dual enrollment

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.880
programs that were CTE-based.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:49.880
So that was new language that was added to this year's head code for CTE.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.880
A brief example on how the calculation is run with the positive considerations

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880
in the base.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.880
So XYZ High School has an ADA of 1,000 students.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.880
Their unduplicated pupil count was 900.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.880
They're considered rural.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.880
They had a high dropout rate, a high unemployment rate, and they did

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.880
collaborate with post-secondary programs.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:19.880
So as you can see, for this school, it's above the 550 ADA, so they're part of

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:25.880
the larger group of the allocation applicants for the allocations.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.880
So on average, they receive $95 for their ADA per student.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:38.880
So at 1,000 students, they would have received $95,100 for their 70% base.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:48.880
For rural, they received $43.12 per student, which comes out to about $43,120.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.880
On the collaboration piece, they would get $6.20 per student.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.880
With 1,000 students, they would get $6,200.

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:05.880
Unduplicated count, they would receive $6.32 per student, and that's times 900

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:09.880
per student, so they would receive $5,688.

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:18.880
For the high dropout rate, $7.75 per student, so they would receive $7,750.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.880
And then the high unemployment rate was $13.23 per student, times 1,000 students

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:28.880
would be $13,230.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:33.880
When you add up the base along with the positive consideration funding that they

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:41.880
received, their total calculation would be $171,088 for the allocation.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:47.880
The LEA had put up a $220,000 match, the two-to-one match.

01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:56.880
So in this example, truly an example, the actual allocation for high school XYZ

01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:01.880
would be $171,088.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:07.880
Now, with this example, if their total calculation had been above the $220,000

01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:10.880
match, they would only receive their match amount.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.880
We do not go above what their match could be.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.880
Again, California Department of Education recommends approval of the round 7A of

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:32.880
the career technical education center grant program 2021 and 2022 allocations.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.880
Any questions?

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:40.880
Comments?

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:45.880
Are there any clarifying questions for members of the board?

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.880
That was a very thorough explanation.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:54.880
It's a very complicated formula when you really have to break it down and make sure

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.880
all your I's are dotted and T's are crossed.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.880
You're a good teacher.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.880
Thank you.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.880
I think we can proceed.

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.880
Is there anything else you wanted to present or are we all set?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.880
Okay.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.880
I don't know if we were just doing clarifications.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.880
Very good.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.880
At this point, the phone line should be open for public comment, so we want to put that

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.880
public comment slide up.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.880
And members of the public wishing to provide comment can do so by calling the telephone

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.880
number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:39.880
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask members McClellan

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.880
and Rodriguez if they have any initial comments, and then we'll see if we have any clarifying

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.880
questions, but I didn't see any yet.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.880
So member McClellan.

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.880
Yes.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.880
Thank you for the great presentation.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:02.880
To the point, this is such an important area for our students in the state of California.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:10.880
You know, when we think of CTE, we usually think of, you know, carpenters and auto mechanics

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:17.880
and construction technology, but we know today's CTE includes so much more, you know,

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:25.880
health sciences programs, engineering, entrepreneurship, theater arts, media, culinary

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:30.880
arts, and many, many other pathways for our students.

01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:38.880
So I just wanted to remind folks of that, that it's the jobs of the future for our students.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:47.880
I really appreciate how the formula turned out on this in terms of, you know, the weighted

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:56.880
acknowledgement for high unemployment areas and the rural areas, of course, and then the

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:03.880
collaboration, acknowledging collaboration and bringing together LEAs with our community

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:07.880
colleges, and that's so important, so important that people work together.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.880
And then, of course, acknowledgement of the smaller LEAs in the formula.

01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:22.880
I also really like that we created a second round for the 59 million that was still remaining to

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.880
create a second round for folks to apply again, especially during the pandemic when we know

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.880
folks are overwhelmed and our LEAs and our staffs are just trying to hold their own through this

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.880
school year, so that second round, I think, has been very helpful.

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880
So thank you.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.880
Thank you for the presentation.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.880
Thank you so much.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.880
And Member Rodriguez, would you like to add some comments?

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.880
Yes.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.880
Thank you, Member McQuillin.

01:14:52.880 --> 01:15:00.880
That was a wonderful overview because it isn't the home ec classes that we knew about in the

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:02.880
past, right?

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:08.880
You know, this is actually our students are able to see professionals in action.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:12.880
They're able to mentor and model with them.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:17.880
And for my community in particular, we do have such a high unemployment rate.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:26.880
And I see how our CTE pathways at my high school and throughout our community is producing

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.880
students who are learning about culinary arts, who are becoming dental hygienists.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.880
They graduate and they are on their path to go into a career.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:48.880
And these are a lot of the programs that change the poverty that sometimes our students, you know,

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:50.880
that path, right?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.880
They're able to graduate with confidence.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:01.880
They go into deep learning with especially using, you know, some of the schools that employ the

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.880
methods of linked learning.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:08.880
It's very powerful to see what we see we can become.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:17.880
And it makes me excited when I see my students transform from being disconnected from school to

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:25.880
actually having hope that they found a career that they can follow and enrich their lives and their

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.880
families and our community.

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.880
So I really appreciate this.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.880
And the second round.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.880
And I'm excited to see what the second round is going to look like.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:36.880
Thank you.

01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:38.880
Terrific.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.880
Are there any other clarifying questions before we go to public comment?

01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:46.880
Seeing none, we will see if we have some callers in the queue.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.880
We have four callers in the queue.

01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.880
I will open the phone lines now.

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.880
Thank you.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:54.880
Good morning.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.880
You have one minute.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.880
Your time starts now.

01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:02.880
Good morning.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.880
Kyle on behalf of the CTA coalition, an organization comprised of 14 regional programs and centers to

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.880
deliver CTA school districts in California.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:16.880
Our coalition was very supportive of increasing the ongoing CTA funding for $150 to $300 million in

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.880
the 2122 state budget act.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.880
However, despite the significant increase, many of our members were funded below their match request for

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.880
2122.

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:28.880
While we understand the current methodology utilized by CDE caps grantee awards at the formula

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:34.880
eligibility amount, this nonstatutory formula has also led to a remaining balance of over $59 million.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:38.880
Rather than risk CTA funds returning back to the state, we believe that CDE could allow 2122

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:42.880
applicants that are proposed to be funded below their match level access to the remaining dollars.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.880
There is no reason for the funds to go unspent when high quality CTA providers have the capacity to

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:48.880
invest these resources in successful programs.

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.880
Our coalition also requests that the CTA allocations and methodology be made available earlier in the

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.880
fiscal year.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:58.880
CTA recipients rely on these funds to sustain and grow existing programs and a possible task when

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.880
recipients do not know until late in the fiscal year whether or not they will be receiving the funds.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.880
For these reasons, we believe CDE should commit to an annual schedule for application approval and

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.880
distribution.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.880
Thank you.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.880

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.880
Good morning.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.880
President, members of the board.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:26.880
On behalf of the association of career and college readiness organizations, I would like to associate

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.880
myself with the comments of Mr. Highland.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:34.880
And I would just add that while we are very excited to have this long anticipated funding go out,

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.880
there is still confusion in the field over process and so forth.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.880
We know you're working out the keys.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.880
So we look forward to working with CDE and the state board to have a more consistent and stable process

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.880
and hopefully get the funds out earlier because we know we have students ready to learn.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.880
Thank you.

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.880
Thank you.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:00.880
Hi.

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.880
Good morning.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.880
President Darwin-Hammond and members of the board.

This is Manuel Buenrostro with California Together.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.880
And I'm calling in reference to the second round of applications.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.880
We recommend adding to the eight criteria for positive consideration.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:12.880
A priority in education with an incentive for teacher preparation programs for high-need fields,

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:14.880
including bilingual teachers, CDE programs.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.880
This funding can be the beginning of creating a bilingual teacher pipeline in high school

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.880
and also pipelines for other high-need areas.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.880
This would attract students who are bilingual and working towards attaining the state's dual

01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.880
bi-literacy upon graduation to pursue their credential.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.880
And there's an indication of the need for this.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880
So I'm calling in reference to the second round of applications.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.880

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:30.880

And there's an indication of the need for this.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:44.880
We look at much of the data from CCTC and the need for more teachers in these high-need fields.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:46.880
Thank you again, and have a great rest of your meeting.

Action requests of CDE prendre allocation methodology.

At the same time, release the preliminary allocation in conjunction with methodology is not only best practice but is often the best option for transparency.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.880
Thank you.

01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480
Okay.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.960
It looks like that concludes public comment for item number 12.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:26.800
All right.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.000
Thank you very much.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
So we are now open for discussion from the board.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.480
I do want to make one note.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:43.240
There was a caller who talked about launching teaching academies or teaching pathways.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:49.560
And there is a proposal in the January budget from the governor's office to do precisely

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:57.320
that, to put $1.8 billion towards pathways that would include STEM pathways, computer

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.080
science pathways, green technology pathways, and teaching pathways.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:07.400
So hopefully we will be able to be talking about and looking at those sometime in the

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.680
near future.

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.000
I see a hand up.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
It came and it went.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.200
Member Olken, did you have your hand up for a second?

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:21.200
Okay.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.400
The Zoom board also shifted on me.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.360
So I saw the hand and then the Zoom shifted.

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.480
Member Benaka, please go ahead.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.320
Yes, thank you.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.320
I just really want to...

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:39.320
I think...

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320
You may be freezing on us.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320
Is it working?

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320
Okay.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320
Try again.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.320
Why don't you go back to the beginning?

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.320
Hopefully it's working now.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
It is now.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.320
It is.

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.320
All right.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:02.680
I just want to applaud the efforts in developing this formula and applaud that and just thank

01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:04.680
Peter for the presentation.

01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:12.800
And I also want to say that I think that CTE is not only practical in the sense that it

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.080
helps prepare students for careers, but I think just the fact that students are able

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:24.680
to focus on their passions and develop that into something that they can do for a living

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:27.480
is just such an incredible opportunity for students.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:33.440
And I also think that it really helps students engage with what they're doing at school.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:40.400
And then also in the formula, I really appreciate the weight of the unduplicated pupil count,

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:47.960
the high dropout rate and the high employment rate that is considered when giving out these

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:48.960
grants.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:52.440
And so, yeah, I just really applaud these efforts and I'm really glad that we're working

01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:53.440
on this.

01:23:55.640 --> 01:24:01.080
Any other comments or questions?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:09.840
I do want to clarify, Pete, that my understanding is that by statute we're not permitted to

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:11.800
fund up to the match.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.920
We have to fund to the formula.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.920
Is that right?

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.840
And you're on mute.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:21.280
You're talking to yourself on mute.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:28.400
Yeah, in the past, they've been able to do some things with the formula to add share

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.400
funding to them to get them closer to the match.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:36.200
There is actually language that was added this year that does not allow us to do that.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.920
So that's very clear in the language now that they either get their calculated amount or

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:45.280
if it goes beyond that, they only get their match.

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.280
Okay.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280
Member McQuillin.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:25:00.040
Yeah, just to follow up related to the caller who called in asking for an addition to support,

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:10.240
I think, bilingual teachers and what you mentioned, Chairperson, that the one billion plus that's

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:17.240
in the proposed governor's, would this include supporting bilingual teacher development?

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240
It would.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200
Yeah.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:26.320
So I'm excited for the possibilities that we could start to address our teacher needs

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.080
and shortages by getting kids excited about teaching in high school.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:36.040
I think Member Glover-Woods has a hand up.

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:39.200
Yes, thank you.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:45.800
Just wanted to ask a quick question around the timeline for the allocations because we're

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:50.840
looking at allocations, I believe, and Pete, correct me if I'm wrong, for the 21-22 school

01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:54.600
year, which will be coming to a close in a couple of months.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:01.400
Is that the typical timeline that we use and are the awardees required to expend these

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:04.840
funds within the 21-22 school year?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.440
That's my first question or first and second.

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:14.680
So our goal was to get them out sooner and we had all the applications in and scored.

01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:21.400
But once the trailer bill language came out with new requirements, we had to make a shift

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:28.080
and add two addendums to the application process, which delayed us in getting the allocations

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:30.280
processed sooner.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:37.000
If there are no changes in language for this coming school year, we should have them to

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.680
the board by no later than a November board meeting for approval.

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:43.680
That's our goal.

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:47.840
And if we can do it by September, that would be even better for us to answer the second

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.340
part of your question.

01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:54.880
They have until December 2023 to expend these funds.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:55.880

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.440

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:52.080
So brooks can keep track of raised hands. I don't know. I guess that's if you have a comment

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.440

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.040
Motion carries

01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.840
All right, that was easy

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:50.960
Um now I want to invite the state board members to report on any liaison activities that are not related to any items on our

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:52.800
March agenda

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:59.440
Um, and although I will not call on our new board members today for that purpose at the end of our liaison reports

01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:04.480
I will call on them if they have other comments and say a few words about them

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.940
So we'll start with um student member ron anka

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.280
Thank you president darlin hammed

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.760
To begin with in january

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:21.620
I attended a discussion hosted by the california student board member association or csbma

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:25.840
About the 2022 revision of the state math framework

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:31.440
And I was able to hear a multitude of opinions and perspectives on the proposed

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:40.640
framework from student board members through throughout the state and even perspectives from adults like math professors and advocates and of course

01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:45.120
I was diligently taking notes because I know that we are set to take action

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.400
On this framework in our july meeting

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:54.240
And then I also attended a national student board member association meeting where I was able to learn

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.600
From the experiences and the insights of student board members throughout the nation

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:07.520
And I really love to hear about how they all approach hearing student voice, which is of course really important to student board members

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.960
Um, and so in that same vein i'm currently working on organizing statewide virtual student forums so that I can hear

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.120
Input from students throughout the state about the issues that they're passionate about and the issues that they care about most

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.280
And then i'm also starting to work with the california association of student councils or cask

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.760
To plan more ways that the student board member on the state board or me this year

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.760
Um can increase their collaboration with cask moving forward whether that be through hosting

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.880
student town halls or giving reports at

01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.520
cask conferences on statewide

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Updates and things of that nature

01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.640
And so i'm looking forward to that

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:54.960
And then finally in terms of the mask mandate being lifted just in time for school on monday

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:59.860
I want to remind students to be respectful of other people's decisions

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.640
I know that i've already seen discussions in my school about it and students are

01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:11.120
Or some students I should say are already making fun of other students for their decisions of whether or not to wear a mask

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.040
Um, and more often than not I see that students that are choosing to continue to wear their masks are

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:21.120
Are being poked fun at and made fun of a bit more

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.840
which is really

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.880
Mask wearing is still strongly recommended

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.800
But at the end of the day once the mandate is lifted, we need to be respectful of each other's choices

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360
And that concludes my liaison report

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:45.840
Thank you, and thank you for that very important, um comment and reminder. We really appreciate that

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.720
members cabello

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:53.200
Yes as part of being a liaison for wested wested has been

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.400
very busy in in gearing up for

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.720
the

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.720
2022 just last week

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.920
um air was part of a

01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:06.240
the keynote at

01:36:06.240 --> 01:36:07.760
address with

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.200
With I mean wested was part of a keynote address, uh with air

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:18.720
At the national association of school principals in dc

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:25.200
Um, it gathered many of the elementary and middle school leaders across the country

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:31.040
Um, and they highlighted a real interesting study. It was a study on

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.040
Um entitled leaders we need

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.480
Now research series and

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:45.440
They conducted wested conducted. Um 36 focus groups with 188 principals

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:48.480
across the nation and

01:36:48.800 --> 01:36:50.560
there were three

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:54.320
Tenants that I would love to bring up one was um

01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.140
That during this time there was some real specific school innovations and new perspectives

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.240
that have been

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.600
Created or discovered, you know from this

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.160
covid time

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.760
and basically some of the learnings specifically in how

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:21.760
The use of remote instructional technology helped in some cases obviously supplement and extend learning

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:26.640
And and the importance of flexible staffing as well and and then

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:32.800
A second finding was really the evolution of the principalship, especially during this

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:37.440
Pandemic year that will continue on will continue

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:46.320
In the sense of crisis management and the importance of communicating effectively, especially in in in the highly

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:48.640
politicized

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.640
local community and

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.040
the importance of balancing

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.440
Vocal and ardent groups and then and then the third finding is is the finding on

In school mental and and physical health support how we're doing this. I mean, it's

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.800
It's heartwarming to see

01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:33.540
That uh, some of this research is being applied in california

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:37.520
and something that you may be interested in is

01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.420

01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:45.680
covid-19 accelerated learning recovery plan has been created by uh west ed

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:41.600
um observe the instructional quality commission meeting that took place in january and they took action forward to

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.840

the joint commission on career technical education to

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.240
Sort of find a date that works. We've had to cancel the past couple. I think we're

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.760
Waiting for additional board members to be seated

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:27.120
And the tentative date for the next joint

01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:29.200
committee

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.200
Is march 25th

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:37.040
and that's where uh members of our state board of education pulled together with the members of the

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:40.180
community colleges of california

01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:45.860
Board members on that committee so aiming for march 25th if that works

01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.220
I also want to report that um

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:54.100
cd has selected uh, two sites to work on the

01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:57.960
model american indian curriculum for california

01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:00.900
and uh, those two sites are

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:07.780
San diego county office of education and humble county office of education were selected

01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:11.780
To develop and pull together the model curriculum

01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:16.740
On, uh native american studies for california. We're happy about that

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:22.980
It's kind of up in here in my neck of the woods humble del lorde area at least they call it behind the redwood curtain

01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:29.700
Um, there was only 300 000 allocated for that work between the two sites

01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:36.740
So it's a little underfunded. So we're hoping that additional funds will be added to that effort, but that's very good news. So

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:39.860
That's all I have to say. Thank you

01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:46.100
All right. Thank you very much. Uh, that's really good news about the curriculum getting rolling. Uh,

01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.180
that's

01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:49.540
historic

01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.540
Member patil bronson

01:41:56.180 --> 01:42:01.300
Uh, good morning. I I wanted to highlight a couple of meetings, um that

01:42:02.260 --> 01:42:04.580
Focused on that connection between the early years

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.700
early learning pre-k tk up to the third grade

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:14.580
Timeframe, um, I think I had mentioned previously that there is a upk

01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:18.180
kitchen cabinet being convened, um

01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:23.620
by a number of state leaders and led by sarah neville morgan, uh very ably

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:29.860
In terms of really shining a light on the importance of the universal tk rollout

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.940
i've also been in conversation with a number of school districts who are

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:37.540
very busily getting ready for the new

01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:45.140
school year and thinking about both what it takes to communicate through the ranks of school districts

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:51.460
the value proposition that transitional kindergarten and upk universal pre-k offer

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:54.500
in terms of preparation for

01:42:55.140 --> 01:43:00.020
K to 12 success, um, and also for eliminating and preventing the achievement gap

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:02.740
um, I think um

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:06.180
That communication challenge is one side on one

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:08.660
in terms of communications to leas

01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:14.980
And then of course there is the broader set of communications that will be necessary to make sure that families understand what?

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:18.260
a meaningful offering is being

01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:26.660
Made available in california because it really is unprecedented and it's excited also to be in conversations with leaders from other states

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.300
Who are watching california and and cheering us on to get this right?

01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:38.180
um, there's also been a number of recent meetings and i've been doing these more in southern california to

01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:41.460
Look at what is the pipeline for the 24 unit?

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400
requirement, um and

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:48.880
What both districts can offer in-house in terms of those necessary

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:54.080
Sort of educational units, but also what partnerships can be had with higher ed?

01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:58.240
Related to that, I think

01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:01.680
hearing and now seeing sort of the trickle of

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.960
information in terms of assessments as to where

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.600
Where we have lost ground and where there are opportunities to really accelerate?

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.160
both

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.360
Gains, but also just ongoing progress and third grade reading

01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:18.480
the the trailer bill language

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.880
Articulating that some of the community schools funding can be used for reading specialists

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.240
As well as literacy coaches, I think is really exciting

01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.720
as well as the budget the governor's budget proposal, uh for

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:39.120
The 500 million to focus on that to make sure that kids by third grade are where we need them to be so that the rest

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:42.400
Of their their k-12 trajectory is about

01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.600
Learning beyond but they have that foundation squarely under their belt

01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.480
It's been an interesting process of learning

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.800
how few

01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:54.800
programs can offer

01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.360
the reading specialist credential on an expedited basis because

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.000
Obviously the emergency is now and we want to make sure that kids have access

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:06.300
to these

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:07.600
specialty

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:12.420
Especially trained teachers and adults who can help them accelerate

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:16.800
Their learning and reading progress as quickly as possible

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:22.320
And then the last thing i'll just say which is more on the wraparound services just

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:28.160
Hearing california highlighted for the cali itc work for working families

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:30.960
and again recognizing that

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:33.920
students children live in the context of families and however

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:37.440
There are a whole set of available resources

01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:44.640
for their families to be well and economically secure matter and the starting to to

01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:50.720
Track some of the partnerships that are happening with leas to actually promote some of these offerings

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:57.440
So that families can be well as their children are on their own wellness journeys in schools

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:00.240
And that concludes my report

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.480
Terrific. Thank you

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:07.760
So many exciting things happening that are getting off the ground right now. It's wonderful to hear all of the ways in which

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.300
People are experiencing them member rodriguez

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:15.040
Yes, thank you. Um president charlene hammon

01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:18.080
So

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:21.840
First of all, I want to start out. I I have three reports. One of them is uh,

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.760
tamo the uh, and the regional el specialist the other

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:29.920
Uh, sisa some california summer school for the arts

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.480
And then lastly ctc

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:38.080
But one of the things that I want to acknowledge and recognize that in the last two years

01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.480
We have all

01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.920
Worked in ways that we never imagined doing something that we

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.520
Didn't really weren't prepared and really didn't know how to do

01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:52.640
And you know starting

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:57.920
With the leadership at the state level, uh, you know our governor setting the example

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880
Or support from the state legislature

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.560
and

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:06.880
These last meetings that I attended i'm just so optimistic about seeing this

01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:14.240
progress and successes and upward trends, uh, and again, especially during you know as we're

01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.960
Literally building the plane while we're flying it and it just goes to show

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.560
how

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:22.560
strong and creative and innovative

01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.520
and adaptable, uh we are

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:29.760
In meeting the needs of our of our students and our teachers

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:37.440
And you know when i'm talking about adaptability i'm talking about parents students the bodies that were all

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:42.400
Uh, you know that we all sit on whether it's as policy makers or liaisons

01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:49.440
So I just really want to acknowledge that and thank you to everyone who has modeled this california way attitude

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:54.240
So i'll start with uh tamo and for

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:57.680
Um, the new members in the public, uh, i'll

01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:03.600
Just, you know talk a little bit about the acronym. It's technical assistance and monitoring office

01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:09.040

Specialists and what a powerful and insight is inspiring meeting it was

01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:20.720

The support that they have provided county offices and the regional

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:44.640
El specialist is at the core of the success that was shared at this meeting. Um, yes, they have challenges ahead

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:49.840
Uh, one of the members of the team has taken a job within another department

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:55.360
And they still have a lot of the important work to do conducting the reviews for the al caps

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.880
Um, and there were a few of the uh, ewig partners ewig educator workforce investment grant

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:09.600
Shared about some of the highlights that they have experienced in the last

01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:12.080
Um in the last couple of years

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.920
Uh, first dr. Ana castro from cave and m cap shared some some of these

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:21.840
Uh progresses they've held two statewide summits

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:23.680
um

01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:29.280
The m cap team meets monthly. They have delivered training to para educators

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:33.120
Language training because they have requested

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:40.000
To know more and so that's exciting right, you know for the para educators to receive

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.860
Some of these powerful programs that they've put together nine asynchronous academies

01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.940
And um, very exciting they've launched parent innovation programs

01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:57.460
Where they have served the parents helping them work closely with their children at home

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:05.700
And supporting them with technology platforms. They're also working to improve the bilingual teacher preparation programs

01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:10.020
Next dr magali lavadans her name came up yesterday

With english learner master plan playbook, which by the way, it's available for download

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:23.780
And it's just a fantastic

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:31.460
Resource for anybody working with the all students whether it's you know, the leadership at the lea or teachers in the classroom

01:50:32.900 --> 01:50:34.900
Para professionals

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:41.700
I suggest downloading it and planning accordingly the team has created has worked to create

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:46.820
Clarity across the state they have far exceeded their original goal and have worked with

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:53.640
45 county offices across california and have reached over 500 participants

01:50:54.180 --> 01:51:01.320
They're working with colleagues to create visionary policies patricia carlin of s, san diego county office of education

01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:03.940
Shared that she has used the playbook

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.740
and has created a google doc that

01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:12.420
Um alias can use as a template and leave their examples and this is a great

01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:17.220
Um a great way to highlight the collaboration and sharing best practices

01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:23.300
Uh, then a regional recap the um the regional, uh

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:25.520
leads

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:28.500
Presented they talked about they had five minutes to talk about

01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.740
The successes they were having and then some of the challenges that they were facing

01:51:33.380 --> 01:51:40.180
And generally, uh, some of the successes is the work around parent support, uh, especially talking about trauma

01:51:40.820 --> 01:51:48.180
and um, you know resilience being able to understand some of the barriers, uh that students are facing

01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:51.140
And giving the parents access

01:51:51.220 --> 01:51:56.740
Uh to support their their children at home some of the barriers or are some of the barriers that we have seen

01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:00.740
uh, right the lack of data just because of uh, you know our

01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:04.100
Our testing changes in in because of the pandemic

01:52:04.820 --> 01:52:12.260
And for reclassification purposes and also just a sense of general exhaustion because of the plates that people are juggling

01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:13.860
um

01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.860
One of the things that gq said

01:52:16.740 --> 01:52:23.060
Is that um, you know, the goal is for the alias to avoid solely a compliance centered

01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:28.980
Uh model and uh, you know when he's conducted reviews

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:36.100
Uh, oftentimes alias are using instruments that are three or four or even 10 years old and so

01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:42.020
He's really trying to get into a service centered rather than a compliance centered model

01:52:42.900 --> 01:52:45.380
And I I really like

01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:49.060
You know that going into into the future that way

01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:53.880
Um next with um ctc

01:52:53.960 --> 01:53:02.440
Um, many of the members of the commission and executive director sandy shared touching anecdotes and tributes and um,

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:10.040
very heartfelt tributes to assembly member and state senator gary hart who passed away in january and who was uh,

01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:13.240
such a big part of uh ctc

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:18.440
and you know a lot of the a lot of the changes that have had happened within the

01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:21.880
Last couple of decades

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.320
Um

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:30.440
and the work continues with the two design teams of ece early childhood education experts

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.080
advising the commission on the development

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.640
of both the ece

01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.400
Teacher performance assessments and the new program called quality peer review process

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:47.160
Um, they're continuing to move the initial developmental work to the pilot testing

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:51.980
Um, and which will happen around late spring 2022

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:59.480
The four ece pilots are continuing to support implementation of this transformative work

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:09.000
Moving toward the tpe aligned curriculum and instruction within ece preparation programs as well as towards supporting the programs

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:15.240
to complete a self-analysis regarding how close they are to meeting the commission's adopted

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:20.620
Program guidelines that address quality prep for the ec workforce

01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:23.880
Um

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:25.800
next there was a

01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:28.200
report on the residency programs

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:31.880
The ct staff developed a timeline timeline

01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:39.740
For the request for applications for the new teacher residency grant competitions authorized by assembly bill 130

01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:41.980
Um

01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:48.620
Findings from the second year of the teacher residency program during a global pandemic were presented at the meeting

01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:56.620
The highlights were centered around enrollment completion and hiring findings from an analysis of data collected

01:54:56.940 --> 01:54:59.260
About the first two cohorts and residents

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:08.460
Recommendations, uh from a newly released teach brief teacher residency programs in california financial

01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.820
Sustainability challenges and opportunities include the following

01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:17.980
Grantee programs have made progress toward key outcomes

01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:20.680
challenging conditions and

01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:23.260
Including or included

01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:26.300
They highlight the importance of the residencies

01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:30.060
Their plans for future sustainability

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:32.220
um

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.660
the

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.660
Let's see grant funding remains available

01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:43.500
For the encumbrance through june 30th 2023 a final report is due from the commission

01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:46.140
Uh, probably in december

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:54.220
2022 because it will uh, it'll be for the policy committees and state legislator. So once we that is complete

01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:56.300
I will return with a report

01:55:57.660 --> 01:55:59.660
And next there was a

01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:02.060
a very

01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:04.700
Strong and

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.760
robust conversation

01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:08.860
about ed tpas

01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:10.780
they're

01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:12.780
You know one of the questions that that

01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:16.200
commissioners and

01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:18.460
people from the public

01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:23.020
Would like to see addressed in further research and further studies

01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:27.920
Is um, you know, what is it? Is it the context about ed tpa?

01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:32.060
That seems to be tough for teachers of color

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.120
Uh to pass the performance assessments

01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:42.380
There, uh, you know while there were some people that were calling in and saying we'd like to see more evidence

01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.940
um, they're

01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:50.060
The thought is that context matters, right? Um, and so

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:55.900
There are a few studies that uh, you know are showing how powerful the tpas are

01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:01.420
for teachers that they feel prepared when they go into the classroom and

01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:07.500
some of the public and some of the commissioners would like to look into those studies a little bit more and answer some of

01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:09.260
the questions of

01:57:09.260 --> 01:57:11.420
Is there a barrier? What is it and how can we?

01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:13.980
uh work to make sure that we

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.060
Uh that that this isn't

01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:20.300
A gatekeeper for teachers of color to come into the profession

01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:22.940
um there

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.100
Uh, the student liaison

01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:29.340
Said that you know, she has found that the ed tpa

01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:33.820
She was actually going through it at the time that the meeting was happening

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:39.340
And how much she appreciated the reflective practice, which is what the ed tpa intended

01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:46.700
Uh, you know, she said she had you know had to question like why she did this the focus of equity, right?

01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.700
Which was another intention of the ed tpa

01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:52.060
And how prepared she felt?

01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.780
To confront the challenges of the classroom

01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:57.980
um, uh, it was it was interesting because

01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:03.580
a commissioner who used to be one of the public members representing, um,

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:07.020
Uh sisa

01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:15.100
Talked about how when the ntpas were first adopted he was a little bit reluctant. He thought it was another

01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:20.060
uh bureaucratic hurdle and as a human resource employer

01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:27.020
And this is commissioner simmons said that he has noticed how well prepared the teachers who?

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:34.220
Uh are with the ntpas how how ready they are to handle the challenges, um ahead of them

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:38.540
So it was a very interesting discussion and there will be more on that

01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:42.380
Executive director sandy

01:58:42.380 --> 01:58:48.780
uh, you know said that uh, we'll bring it back in a very transparent way to reflect and to

01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:51.020
answer

01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:53.020
the initial question of

01:58:53.020 --> 01:59:01.020
The purpose and how to make sure that uh, they can confront the barriers that they're seeing especially when it comes to teachers of color

01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.300
And then lastly

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:12.380
Another acronym sisa not sisa, uh, the california state summer school for the arts

01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:14.940
And this is for the new members

01:59:14.940 --> 01:59:18.560
If you're not familiar a rigorous profession, uh pre-professional

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:24.100
Month-long training program in the visual and performing arts creative writing animation

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.400
And film for talented artists of high school age

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.320
Sisa provides a supportive environment in which students own

01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.720
Acquired skills and explore new techniques and ideas for an intense and exciting learning experience

01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:44.580
The school was created by the california legislature and held its first session in 1987

01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:52.340
Uh, and the purpose is to provide a training ground for future artists who wish to pursue careers in the arts

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:56.040
And entertainment entertainment industries in california

01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:00.820
Applications for summer school have closed with so this is the update

02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:06.660
Um with a thousand applicants and that is a big deal because that signifies an upward

02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:13.620
Trend there have been a couple of difficult years and sisa is definitely recovering

02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:19.700
Um, the 2022 application deadline was monday. It's past monday at 6 pm

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:27.860
And as always it was a rush to the finish with 70 percent of the applicants arriving within the last 48 hours of the deadline

02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.260
Applicants are up from last year and this is really good

02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.860
But they have not reached pre-pandemic levels

02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:38.980
This year the board decided

02:00:39.060 --> 02:00:41.060
to limit

02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:46.580
The program to only students from california because of covid if somebody would contract

02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:49.620
Would be covid positive

02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:52.900
If they're, you know from france or china

02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:55.540
how will they

02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:56.900
you know be

02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.420
as

02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:00.420
Be sent home if they're covid positive

02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.940
so

02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.940
Only california students applied this year

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.220
But last year there were

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.620
895 applications

02:01:09.620 --> 02:01:11.620
The overall applications have uh

02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:16.600
Were started steadily declining since their peak of 2017

02:01:18.260 --> 02:01:23.860
But the uptick this year is encouraging visual arts and writing are under the six-year average

02:01:24.180 --> 02:01:30.760
The other departments have larger decreases including animation, which is the most competitive program historically

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:35.700
Um the increased tuition may also have been a factor

02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:43.480
Um executive director matt gallagher will be researching the data further and report back soon on race ethnicity

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:45.700
stance

02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:52.980
Percentage of the applicants with financial aid and more so stay tuned and thank you always so much for your support

02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:56.660
Thank you

02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:58.020
um

02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:02.740
I will just piggyback on a couple of the reports that have been made to note that

02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:04.180
Uh

02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:08.260
As several folks have said tk is rolling out across the state

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.860
There's a lot of work going on on the workforce question

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:14.340
the ctc is

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:18.500
Going to be approving the requirements for an early childhood credential

02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:23.540
Shortly and that will be accessible not only through the multiple

02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.100
subjects

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:32.660
Pathway where teachers can add 24 units but also for early childhood educators or people trained in early childhood

02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:34.740
to come in

02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:36.180
and be

02:02:36.180 --> 02:02:37.620
credentialed for

02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:41.300
To build on what they've already accomplished in their permits

02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:50.340
And then to be credentialed for early childhood from age three through I think they're calling it three through three age three through grade three

02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:53.620
Is I think the strategy that they're pursuing?

02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:59.860
So I wanted to be sure that people understand particularly those who are trying to think about how to staff tk programs

02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:06.020
There's also going to be some guidance coming out shortly that will provide guidance for how

02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:09.060
in the short run

02:03:09.460 --> 02:03:11.460
districts and

02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:16.020
County offices that are involved in this can staff up from multiple sources of supply

02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:18.560
there are

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.660
30 000 folks in the assist in the early childhood system who have the bachelor's degree and most of the

02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:30.100
Requirements for a credential already and then of course folks from the elementary school

02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.300
Side of the equation as well

02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:36.500
And then the other thing I just wanted to note building on

02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:39.220
member patio brownson's

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:43.380
comments about literacy coaches and reading specialists those

02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:47.620
That is a proposal in the january budget

02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:52.740
for 500 million dollars to help tiny districts to

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:57.700
To develop and extend their reading programs with

02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.820
literacy coaches who are

02:04:01.620 --> 02:04:08.580
Trained there will be a training program attached and reading specialists who can work one-on-one in small groups with kids there has there's

02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.660
extraordinary

02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:16.820
Data available about the impacts of high intensity high intensity tutoring for rapidly

02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:22.340
Enabling students to regain ground both in math and english language arts

02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:24.820
We have another

02:04:25.860 --> 02:04:30.580
Grant proposal going out to provide training for those tutors

02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:33.700
in reading and english language arts who use and

02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.220
Mathematics who use a vetted

02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:40.260
highly

02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:43.620
Effective curriculum and strategies to

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:47.380
Help students

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:52.260
Really catch up quickly and so I want people to be aware that that is

02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:55.380
Going on there will be grants issued for

02:04:56.580 --> 02:05:00.580
several county offices in in the coming days or weeks, it's

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:04.100
imminent to

02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:06.820
Begin providing that kind of training

02:05:07.620 --> 02:05:09.220
for

02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:14.500
strategies for learning acceleration that can be used in multi-tiered systems of support

02:05:14.900 --> 02:05:20.100
Can be used in regular classrooms and can be used in the after school and summer school

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:24.420
Context where we have new resources going out

02:05:25.060 --> 02:05:28.500
So lots going on all across the state

02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:32.500
I do want to give our new board members an opportunity to say a few words

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:37.700
We needed when you first arrived to get to a closed session meeting which you

02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:44.580
Had a chance to participate in but we didn't have a chance to say very much about you or hear very much from you

02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:49.160
So I just wanted to take this opportunity for at least a brief introduction

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:56.040
To each of you. I'm going to start with brenda because she's in the middle of the alphabet and

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:03.160
You know, we sometimes start at the end we start sometimes start at the beginning we hardly ever start in the middle

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.320
And if you ever play bidwist some people will know bidwist goes uptown and downtown

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:14.680
But some people want to create a form of bidwist that starts in the middle of the deck of cards

02:06:15.240 --> 02:06:22.440
Uh, dr brenda lewis, uh, you retired as an associate superintendent, I think from the pern high school district

Thank you president darlin hammon and you know, i'll start by saying yesterday in my introductory comments

This board and I want you to know that after yesterday and today i'm still excited. Okay, that hasn't left me

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:36.120
So

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:39.720
No, I I truly I mean you've given my background. Um

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:47.960
uh been I was at the district for 33 years and uh again had the opportunity to participate in a lot of different areas or

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:50.600
A lot of different hats and administration along the way

02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:57.640
And I I will say yesterday and so far today it has it's been a rewarding experience. I

02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.920
I admire each of you for you know

02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:07.640
The time that you've been on this board and continuing on the board because we cover a lot of agenda items a lot of issues coming from

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:10.040
uh different uh

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:12.940
topics in different directions and have to take into consideration

02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:18.520
statute and law and what's best for kids on the school site and also

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:23.240
A couple of them I will say tug at your heartstrings over the last couple of days

02:08:23.320 --> 02:08:28.600
but we you know, we have to to to do what's best in the overall big picture for students and

02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:33.480
Um, you know my comments may go everywhere, but I love rana

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:36.040
I love the fact that there's a student on this board

02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:39.880
I just left the district and wasn't able to serve with the student

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.280
We just put a student on the the board in the district that I left but

02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:49.320
Some of the things I hear and all of the things that are going on behind the scenes with the members

02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:52.860
Uh different groups that they are working with or committees

02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:56.860
Um, it's it's a lot of work and i'm ready to dive in

02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:00.460
wherever needed to enroll up my sleeves and get started

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:08.060
to provide what knowledge that I can and expertise that I can bring to the board and to help in any way possible and

02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:13.900
Again, just looking forward to the work that we have ahead of us and being a contributor

02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:17.020
Um to to our work and a good teammate

02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:22.380
To my fellow board members and again rana, I can't say enough about students

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:28.940
I love mentoring. I love working with students and to see you and just hear you the last couple of days

02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:34.380
I mean if if if we would if president darling ham and would have introduced you as a student

02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:39.740
I think someone would have thought you were a staff member somewhere by your comment in your intellect. So

02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:45.180
Thank you for that and a student voice is so important. So good luck

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:49.020
With your efforts and bringing together that virtual meeting

02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:55.340
Statewide to bring students together because for so long it was just the adults in the room

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:59.820
but the students add a great voice a great perspective of

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:06.220
To a lot of issues and it keeps us on our toes. So thank you for that and to my fellow board members

02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:10.780
I'm just looking forward to the work we have ahead of us. Thank you. Terrific. Thank you

02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.500
And all of the new board members know that they will be

02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:17.820
Um having the opportunity to take up their liaison assignments

02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:23.340
Shortly, so we'll be hearing more from you in that capacity by next time

02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:26.240
I'm going to go to gabriela roscoe gonzalez

02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:30.300
That goes either way in the alphabet depending on which name you use

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:36.780
She is an elementary school teacher and has taught in montobello unified school district for over 20 years

02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:39.980
She's taught kindergarten through sixth grade. So she's gone

02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:45.980
Up and down the the ladder with the kids and knows how they develop at every age and stage

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:51.660
She is a common core standards expert a curriculum and assessment writer master teacher and mentor

02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:56.780
In addition, she's a teacher leader for the instructional leadership core, which is a wonderful

02:10:57.340 --> 02:11:00.620
a group of a couple of hundred teachers across the state

02:11:01.900 --> 02:11:04.380
who have been helping us with the

02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:10.380
Uh shifts in instructional practice associated with the common core state standards

02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:16.940
And have been doing just incredible work. I had the opportunity to participate in an evaluation of the program and the

02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:25.100
Evaluation comments from other teachers about having teachers in their districts leading them through this process. We're so positive

02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:30.940
And so inspiring. She's a national presenter on common core instructional hips and teacher leadership

02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:36.700
And she's also a blogger and she writes about teaching strategies curriculum and educational resources

02:11:37.500 --> 02:11:42.300
So for those of us who like to geek out on those topics, there's a new blog for us to find

02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.860
Gabriela, would you like to say a couple of words?

02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:51.820
Yes, thank you. Um again really excited just like member lewis about being part of this board

02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:56.700
I'm very fortunate to have a voice as an elementary school teacher. I've

02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:01.420
12 second grade for 12 years now and it really

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.980
I think of

02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:09.580
Miss bronz and how you mentioned about reading literacy and how important for um to support

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:17.420
As our students are in that developmental stage of learning to read and this whole two days has been a whirlwind but i've

02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:21.180
Really had several items that I know that i'm really passionate about

02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:24.380
I mean, I think about item number two and assessments. I started

02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:29.260
The work with common core when it was first introduced in 2010 and

02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:35.180
As an assessment writer and item reviewer. I really think that I can bring a voice to

02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:37.900
Those topics as they present to the board

02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:45.900
I also think about item six and how about job quality and safe safety and and just workplaces and

02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:52.380
Adult education family literacy all programs that I've worked really closely with in my district and I've bought into

02:12:52.940 --> 02:13:01.180
When I work with ilc and work my collaboration with the california teachers association and building partnerships with families

02:13:02.060 --> 02:13:07.740
Some of the things that i've done in our local districts and downing and montobello and in the la area is

02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:13.500
Really bringing parent connections into the classroom and building those partnerships with students. So

02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:18.220
rana, I also think about how important it is to have student voice and

02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:23.740
And really build those communities of learners where

02:13:24.540 --> 02:13:31.500
We collaborate as educators with not only the community with parents and and including student voice

02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:36.140
Continuously and everything that we do in education how that impact is

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:40.620
Is just enormous in our school district. So

02:13:41.740 --> 02:13:46.380
Just learning i'm a listener right now and just kind of taking it all in

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:50.380
But I know that I can contribute as time goes on. I just want to make sure that I

02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:59.280
I have the right pockets to to insert my thoughts into but thank you for this opportunity and i'm excited to collaborate

02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:02.540
terrific and sharon olken

02:14:03.420 --> 02:14:09.040
Sharon has been the executive director of gateway public schools in san francisco

02:14:09.740 --> 02:14:11.740
Which is a middle and a high school?

02:14:11.980 --> 02:14:14.620

02:14:15.180 --> 02:14:17.180
parents of students with disabilities

02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:21.660
To create an inclusive and effective learning environment

She's been there for more than 20 years as a teacher a school leader and a school founder

02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:28.540
I've learned a lot from Sharon

02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:35.260
She is a graduate of the stanford teacher education program who we have tapped many times for advice and counsel

02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:39.180
on special education needs and on a variety of other things

02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:42.140
she

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:48.940
Helps the students discover their unique potential what they love the impact they help to make on their communities in this very diverse

02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:50.620
student community

02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:59.660
She recently founded everyday leadership a website dedicated to providing models of positive leadership and helping others cultivate their power in their voice

02:15:00.460 --> 02:15:02.460
Sharon

02:15:06.060 --> 02:15:08.060
Thank you president darling hammond and

02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:11.980
I can't tell you how much i've learned from you over the years, so i'm

02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:16.940
honored and flattered that you turned that around on me and

02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:19.580
I just want to say i'm so

02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:27.900
Humbled to be on this board with you all and to when you when you said yesterday we

02:15:28.540 --> 02:15:32.880
Are serving 6.2 million students in the state of california

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.320
Um, I got butterflies in my stomach, um, because that is such a

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:45.520
Exciting and huge responsibility and one I feel

02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:53.200
Just really honored to be able to um be part of I

02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:57.680
Those of those who know me at gateway know that um

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:03.360
I try my best to speak without acronyms as much as possible and

02:16:04.320 --> 02:16:06.880
Keep sort of the intent of what we're doing

02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:10.080
front and center, which is for me all about

02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:12.880
the well-being and sense of

02:16:13.340 --> 02:16:15.340
agency of our students

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:17.120
um

02:16:17.120 --> 02:16:21.760
So I have a lot of learning to do about the acronyms. I'm keeping a i'm keeping a running list

02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.960
But what i've learned so far in just the brief time i've been here is

02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:28.880
um

02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:30.960
All those acronyms if you get past

02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.200
Trying to figure out

02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.880
Trying to remember what they are. They're all doing amazing work. That's making

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:38.560
um

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:42.880
Our school's better places for our students first and foremost, but also for our staff

02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.600
um and

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.080
It's it's really um

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.720
Well, i've i've been a strong believer in the importance of

02:16:55.280 --> 02:17:00.800
The this the local context, you know the importance when I first got in education

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:04.800
I thought I wanted to do education policy work and then when I became a teacher

02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:07.680
It's like no the real work happens in the classroom

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:10.800
And i've stayed as close as I can to kids

02:17:11.840 --> 02:17:13.840
Throughout my career. Um

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:18.560
But even in the the short time i've been here mostly listening

02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.200
I can see that the marriage of really good policy and really good schools

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.960
Is how you make major change for kids. Um, and so i'm

02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:33.440
excited to be on this team and learning from you all and um, hopefully

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:40.000
Helping us do more good for our young people who are going to help us make our state and

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:44.240
The world a better place because we know there's a lot of work to do so

02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:49.360
Indeed there is and thank you. We're thrilled to have all of you join us and doing that work

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:56.000

Uh, are there any public comments?

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.820
There are no public comments for for item 13

02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:40.640
We understand that there's a little bit of a lag in the feed so maybe we just give 30 more seconds as a lag

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:42.960
We'll do a little wait time

02:18:48.240 --> 02:18:50.240
