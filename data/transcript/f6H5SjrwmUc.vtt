WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.580
All right, good morning, everyone.

00:09.580 --> 00:14.200
Seeing that the board members are now present, Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish

00:14.200 --> 00:15.200
a quorum?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
Good morning.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.200
Member Rodriguez.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.200
Are you?

00:18.200 --> 00:19.200
I see Member Rodriguez.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
I'm just making sure she's in.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
Are you connected to audio, Brooks?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
I should be.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.200
We're not yet hearing you.

00:24.200 --> 00:25.200
Brooks.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.200
Yeah, the mic says it's live here.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.200
And we can hear me in the room.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.200
Okay.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.200
Okay.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.200
Okay.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.200
Okay.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.200
Okay.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.200
Okay.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.200

00:42.200 --> 00:43.200
Okay.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.200
Okay.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.200
Okay.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.200
Okay.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
Okay.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
Okay.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.200
We're seeing you.

00:51.200 --> 00:52.200
Okay.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.200
Would you like me to call the roll?

00:55.200 --> 00:57.200
President Darling-Hammond, this is the quorum?

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
This is Judy Saez.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.200
Please do.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.200
Okay.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.200
Thank you.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.200
Member Bonocca.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Here.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
Member Darling-Hammond.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
President Darling-Hammond.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Here.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
Member Bonocca.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Here.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Okay.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
All right.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
Okay.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
Thank you.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Okay.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.200
Thank you.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
Thank you.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.100
President Darling-Hammond.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.340
Member Escobedo.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.460
Here.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.620
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:22.620 --> 01:23.460
Here.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.740
Member Lewis.

01:26.740 --> 01:27.580
Here.

01:28.620 --> 01:30.060
Member McQuillan.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.640
Here.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.660
Member Olken.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.660
Here.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.860
Member Oresco-Gonzalez.

01:37.860 --> 01:38.700
Here.

01:39.620 --> 01:41.500
Member Patio-Bronson.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.340
Here.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.160
Good morning.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.420
And member Rodriguez.

01:45.420 --> 01:47.000
Here.

01:47.000 --> 01:47.840
Great.

01:47.840 --> 01:48.660
We have a quorum.

01:48.660 --> 01:49.720
Thank you.

01:49.720 --> 01:50.560
Terrific.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.320
In closed session,

01:53.320 --> 01:57.840
the board took action on Mark S versus state.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.920
And now we are looking for the public comment slide

02:00.920 --> 02:05.920
to go up so that we can discuss the waiver consent items.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.480
Waivers W-1 through W-19.

02:09.480 --> 02:12.800
We'll open the phone line for the public comment queue.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.060
And give it a couple of minutes

02:17.060 --> 02:18.860
to be sure people can catch up with us.

02:18.860 --> 02:23.860
Is there any comment on those items, public comment?

02:25.540 --> 02:28.740
We do have a few people in the queue currently.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.340
I will open the phone line now.

02:31.980 --> 02:32.820
Good morning.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.380
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.220
You have one minute.

02:35.220 --> 02:36.480
Your time starts now.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.480
Caller, ending with the last four digits, five, seven, six,

02:39.480 --> 02:41.060
five, you are live.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.060
Please start your public comment now.

02:45.940 --> 02:46.780
Okay.

02:46.780 --> 02:47.620
Hearing none.

02:48.620 --> 02:50.620
Moving on to the next caller.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.780
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:52.780 --> 02:53.620
You have one minute.

02:53.620 --> 02:54.820
Your time starts now.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.340
Caller, ending in the last four digits, five, seven, six,

03:03.340 --> 03:05.180
five, you are live.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.840
Caller, ending in the last.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.720
Okay, I was told we need to hold off on public comment

03:12.720 --> 03:13.540
for just one moment.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.500
I think they're having some technical issues.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.160
I apologize.

03:18.160 --> 03:19.000
Okay.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.480
All right, I think we're gonna just go ahead

03:28.480 --> 03:30.300
and take a five minute break.

03:30.300 --> 03:34.100
Let the technology folks work out the needs there.

03:34.100 --> 03:38.720
If you need a cup of coffee or whatever this morning,

03:38.720 --> 03:41.040
we'll reconvene at about 9.15.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.000
All right.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.320
Welcome back, everyone.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.720
I think our technology issues have been resolved

04:00.720 --> 04:03.120
and we will ask Brooks to call the roll

04:03.140 --> 04:05.340
to reestablish the quorum.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.180
Great, thank you.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.700
And thank you everyone for your patience.

04:07.700 --> 04:08.800
Member Rodriguez.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.500
Here.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.700
Member Patilla-Brownson.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.140
Sorry, can you hear me here?

04:17.140 --> 04:17.980
Yes, thank you.

04:17.980 --> 04:18.800
Okay, I got that.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.320
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.300
Here.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.140
Member Olken.

04:26.060 --> 04:26.900
Here.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.900
Member McQuillan.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.140
Here.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.740
Member Lewis.

04:31.740 --> 04:32.620
Here.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.040
Vice President Glover-Woods.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.320
Here.

04:36.320 --> 04:37.160
Member Escobedo.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.800
Here.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.640
President Darling-Hammond.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.480
Here.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.320
Member Bonacca.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.680
Here.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.520
We have a quorum.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.040
And just as a brief reminder,

04:48.040 --> 04:49.680
as we come back from the break,

04:49.680 --> 04:51.480
for those that may have called in,

04:51.480 --> 04:54.920
that we are dealing right now with the waivers on consent,

04:54.920 --> 04:57.640
items W1 through W19.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.560
If you're calling about a subsequent item,

04:59.560 --> 05:01.780
please hang up and call back in for that item.

05:01.780 --> 05:02.620
Thank you.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.120
Thank you.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.600
And Brooks, I don't know if you intend to be off video,

05:07.600 --> 05:09.960
but we are not seeing you on video right now.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.920
I do intend to be.

05:11.920 --> 05:12.760
Okay.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.340
So is there any public comment?

05:18.160 --> 05:20.040
Yes, it looks like we do have some public comment.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.200
And again, this is for W1 through 19,

05:23.200 --> 05:25.220
the waiver consent calendar.

05:25.220 --> 05:26.760
I will open the phone line now.

05:29.080 --> 05:29.920
Good morning.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.540
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.200
You have one minute.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.040
Your time starts now.

05:37.600 --> 05:38.440
Caller.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.240
Go ahead, caller.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.000
This is former Governor Jerry Brown.

05:45.880 --> 05:50.880
I want to speak very briefly to the Samora Beach Academy.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.680
This is an extra charter.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.480
Apologies, Governor Brown,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.760
but that's actually gonna be on a subsequent item.

05:57.760 --> 06:01.120
Right now we're dealing only with our waiver items.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.580
Okay, so do I call in or do I just stay on the phone?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.780
You can just call back in after we finish this up.

06:10.700 --> 06:13.940
Okay, so I hang up and then just call back, same number?

06:13.940 --> 06:14.780
Yes, please, sir.

06:14.780 --> 06:16.020
Thank you.

06:16.020 --> 06:16.860
Okay, good.

06:16.860 --> 06:18.160
Thank you.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.260
Okay, next caller.

06:19.260 --> 06:21.200
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.040
You have one minute.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.140
Your time starts now.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.860
Caller, ending with the last one.

06:31.660 --> 06:32.500
Am I on now?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.340
You are.

06:33.340 --> 06:35.220
Please go ahead with your public comment.

06:36.180 --> 06:39.420
My name is Lisa Kimada from Monabella Teachers.

06:39.420 --> 06:42.420
I'm calling in opposition to allowing the time charter

06:42.420 --> 06:43.940
any further opening to Monabella.

06:43.940 --> 06:45.540
Oh, I apologize.

06:45.540 --> 06:46.380
I apologize.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.220
We are currently taking public comment

06:48.220 --> 06:52.820
for waiver consent items W1 through W19.

06:52.820 --> 06:54.660
If we just ask if you could please call back

06:54.660 --> 06:57.160
in a couple minutes, okay?

06:57.160 --> 06:58.000
Okay.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.900
Thank you very much.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.120
And it looks like that concludes public comment

07:01.120 --> 07:02.360
for the waiver items.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.480
All right.

07:04.480 --> 07:05.640
Thank you very much.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.200
At this point, given that there's no other public comment,

07:11.200 --> 07:15.960
I now ask for a motion on waivers one through 19.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.640
So moved.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.640
Second?

07:22.600 --> 07:24.440
Second.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.000
Terrific.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.680
We'll now have a roll call vote.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.660
Brooks, will you please call the roll?

07:29.660 --> 07:30.740
Member Rodriguez.

07:31.900 --> 07:32.920
Aye.

07:32.920 --> 07:34.180
Member Petillo-Brownson.

07:35.260 --> 07:36.180
Yes.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.460
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

07:38.460 --> 07:39.460
Yes.

07:39.460 --> 07:40.300
Member Olken.

07:42.660 --> 07:43.640
Yes.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.660
Member McQuillan.

07:47.540 --> 07:48.460
Yes.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.300
Member Lewis.

07:50.260 --> 07:51.400
Yes.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.740
Vice President Clever-Woods.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.740
Yes.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.620
Member Escobedo.

07:56.620 --> 07:57.720
Yes.

07:57.720 --> 07:59.480
President Darlene Hammond.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.440
Yes.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.280
Member Bonanca.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.600
Aye.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.440
Motion carries.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.640
Thank you.

08:05.640 --> 08:06.780
Thank you very much.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.800
We're gonna move on to item 16.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.360
Item 16 is the appeal of the denial of a petition

08:13.360 --> 08:15.760
for the establishment of a classroom-based charter school

08:15.760 --> 08:18.760
pursuant to California Education Code Section 47605K2.

08:21.440 --> 08:25.700
And the California Department of Education recommends

08:25.720 --> 08:30.320
that the State Board of Education hear the SBA appeal.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.720
This recommendation is based on CDE's review of the appeal

08:33.720 --> 08:35.680
and the documentary record.

08:35.680 --> 08:39.320
SBA has submitted sufficient evidence to hear the appeal

08:40.200 --> 08:42.720
and there are no grounds to summarily deny

08:42.720 --> 08:44.680
per the recommendation.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.880
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

08:48.880 --> 08:50.580
Stephanie, please begin.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.160
Good morning, President Darlene Hammond,

08:55.160 --> 08:57.520
board members, chief, deputy, nicely.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.960
Let's go in here.

09:01.960 --> 09:06.960
So we are here to hear this item,

09:08.760 --> 09:11.280
which is to ask the State Board to hear

09:11.280 --> 09:14.100
or summarily deny the appeal of Samoa Beach Academy.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.480
Little background on this item.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.820
The Samoa Beach Academy petition

09:20.820 --> 09:24.000
proposes a new grade nine through 12 charter school.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.220
The petitioner submitted its petition

09:28.220 --> 09:31.460
to the Northern Humboldt Union High School District

09:31.460 --> 09:34.500
pursuant to Ed Code 47605A.

09:35.860 --> 09:40.220
The district denied the petition on September 14th, 2021

09:40.220 --> 09:42.500
by a vote of five to zero.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.820
SBA then appealed to the denial

09:45.840 --> 09:48.400
to the Humboldt County Board of Education

09:48.400 --> 09:52.640
pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K1AI.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.080
The county denied the petition on February 9th, 2022

09:56.080 --> 09:57.940
by a vote of five to zero.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.200
The charter petitioners then submitted its petition

10:02.200 --> 10:04.960
on appeal to the California State Board of Education

10:04.960 --> 10:09.960
on March 11th, 2022 pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K2.

10:10.180 --> 10:15.180
As stated, the Department of Education is recommending

10:16.020 --> 10:20.400
that the State Board hear the SBA appeal.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.300
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools

10:25.300 --> 10:30.300
pursuant to 47605K2D will hold a public hearing

10:32.100 --> 10:34.140
to review the appeal and documentary record

10:34.140 --> 10:36.380
and shall submit a recommendation to the State Board

10:36.380 --> 10:39.340
whether there is sufficient evidence to hear the appeal

10:39.340 --> 10:41.440
or to summarily deny review of the appeal

10:41.440 --> 10:43.600
based on the documentary record.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.480
The ACCS did, at its June 14th meeting,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.720
hear the appeal, review the documentary record,

10:50.720 --> 10:54.200
and the ACCS accepted the CDE recommendation

10:54.200 --> 10:59.200
and moved to recommend that the SBE hear the SBA appeal.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.540
The motion was passed on a vote of seven to one.

11:02.540 --> 11:07.540
The SBA has submitted all required documents

11:10.220 --> 11:15.220
and met all timelines pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K2A.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.280
It submitted its appeal, a record of the findings

11:18.280 --> 11:21.780
from the district and county, and a written submission

11:21.780 --> 11:24.000
with citations to the documentary record.

11:25.760 --> 11:30.600
NHUHSD and HCBOE provided written oppositions

11:30.600 --> 11:32.940
with specific citations to the documentary record

11:32.940 --> 11:36.220
pursuant to Ed Code section 47605K2C.

11:37.220 --> 11:39.100
The aforementioned documents demonstrate

11:39.100 --> 11:41.380
that there is a factual dispute concerning

11:41.380 --> 11:45.700
the district and county's decisions to deny SBA's petition.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.780
Based on the CDE's review of all documents,

11:48.780 --> 11:51.080
the CDE finds sufficient evidence

11:51.080 --> 11:53.580
for the SBE to hear the appeal.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.800
In this item, the SBE shall decide to either

11:56.800 --> 11:59.360
hear the appeal or summarily deny a review of the appeal

11:59.360 --> 12:00.960
based on the documentary record.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.320
If the SBE decides to hear the appeal,

12:04.320 --> 12:06.960
as recommended by the CDE and ACCS,

12:06.960 --> 12:09.640
the matter will be considered in the following item.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.320
So as we stated, the CDE recommends

12:14.320 --> 12:17.320
that the SBE hear the SBA appeal.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.440
And as I stated earlier, the ACCS

12:19.440 --> 12:21.200
will decide to either hear the appeal

12:21.700 --> 12:25.900
and as I stated earlier, the ACCS at its June 14th meeting

12:25.900 --> 12:28.400
accepted that recommendation and moved also

12:28.400 --> 12:31.500
to recommend that the SBE hear the SBA appeal.

12:43.420 --> 12:47.260
Are you done with your presentation?

12:47.260 --> 12:48.820
I'm done with my presentation.

12:48.820 --> 12:51.120
Okay, thank you.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.540
So we have the public comment slide now

12:53.540 --> 12:57.480
and we will open the phone line for the public comment queue.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.980
The item is limited to a decision

12:59.980 --> 13:02.740
as to whether or not to hear the appeal.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.700
People wishing to make comments on the merits of the appeal

13:05.700 --> 13:09.460
should please wait and comment on the next item,

13:09.460 --> 13:11.660
which is item 17.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.860
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

13:13.860 --> 13:17.300
on this item may do so by calling the telephone number

13:17.300 --> 13:20.060
and using the access code provided on the slide

13:20.080 --> 13:21.520
that is shown now.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.840
While we're waiting, I want to ask our liaisons,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.440
Vice President Glover-Woods and Member Olken,

13:26.440 --> 13:28.600
if they have any initial comments.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.880
We'll check then to see if anyone has clarifying questions

13:31.880 --> 13:34.020
and then go to public comment

13:34.020 --> 13:36.880
on whether or not to hear the appeal.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.160
And I'm gonna ask Vice President Glover-Woods

13:39.160 --> 13:44.160
to see if she has any framing comments for us.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.720
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.700
I just wanted to underscore a couple of items

13:49.700 --> 13:52.920
that Director Farland shared with us.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.800
One, the ACCS did have opportunity to hear

13:56.800 --> 13:59.680
from the petitioners as well as a representative

13:59.680 --> 14:02.720
for both the district and the county office

14:02.720 --> 14:05.960
and decide if there was enough evidence for us

14:05.960 --> 14:09.920
to actually hear the appeal itself.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.720
So again, just to underscore the action that we take

14:13.720 --> 14:18.720
on this particular item is to decide to hear the appeal.

14:19.420 --> 14:23.100
It does not have anything to do with the actual merit

14:23.100 --> 14:24.580
of the appeal itself.

14:26.260 --> 14:27.100
Thank you.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.060
And Member Olken, anything you'd like to add at this point?

14:31.340 --> 14:32.940
Yes, thank you.

14:32.940 --> 14:37.740
So I just wanted to add that as the advisory commission

14:37.740 --> 14:40.460
on charter schools was deliberating,

14:41.420 --> 14:45.620
they were grappling a bit with their new role

14:46.560 --> 14:50.560
as described in 1505.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.400
And so it took a little bit of thinking for them

14:53.400 --> 14:56.240
because it's a change in the process.

14:56.240 --> 15:00.880
But as they thought about what their role is,

15:00.880 --> 15:04.440
they concurred with CDE that in fact,

15:04.440 --> 15:07.380
there was enough of a factual dispute

15:07.380 --> 15:10.020
that this should be heard by the state board.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.640
All right, thank you very much.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.420
Are there any clarifying questions from members of the board

15:16.420 --> 15:18.140
before we go to public comment?

15:25.060 --> 15:27.500
I'm seeing no hands raised.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.100
In that case, we'll see if there's any public comment.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.020
We do have some callers in the queue for public comment.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.520
I will open the phone line now.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.160
Good morning.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

15:39.860 --> 15:40.700
You have one minute.

15:40.700 --> 15:41.960
Your time starts now.

15:44.380 --> 15:47.380
Hello, thanks for the opportunity

15:47.380 --> 15:48.640
to address the school board.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.260
My name's Tom McMahon.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.540
I am the president of the Humboldt County School Board

15:52.540 --> 15:55.540
and I'm a retired educator with 27 years experience,

15:55.540 --> 15:57.440
all of it in Humboldt County.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.360
My decision to deny the appeal for the Sama Bay Academy

16:00.360 --> 16:03.520
was based on my thorough review of the documents submitted,

16:03.520 --> 16:06.020
my consideration of substantial public input

16:06.020 --> 16:08.240
and the presentations offered by both parties

16:08.240 --> 16:09.900
during the public hearing.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.940
I'm an avid supporter of quality career technical education

16:12.960 --> 16:14.960
for the students and local community,

16:14.960 --> 16:16.960
but I could not support the model and plan

16:16.960 --> 16:19.420
presented by Samoa Beach Academy.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.440
My concerns were the model did not present

16:21.440 --> 16:23.720
a sound educational program for all students,

16:23.720 --> 16:26.920
especially those with special needs and the underprivileged.

16:26.920 --> 16:30.080
The program is highly unlikely to be successfully implemented

16:30.080 --> 16:32.360
due to the unrealistic enrollment projections

16:32.360 --> 16:34.720
and the accompanying budget projections

16:34.720 --> 16:36.000
and the lack of availability

16:36.000 --> 16:37.760
of specialized credentialed teachers

16:37.760 --> 16:39.480
to fill the anticipated need.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.480
I'm sorry, sir.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.720
If you could please,

16:43.540 --> 16:44.700
sorry to interrupt.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.740
If you could please call back for the next item.

16:46.740 --> 16:51.740
We are currently taking public comment for item number 16.

16:51.740 --> 16:52.580
Thank you.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.400
Oh, okay.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.540
Next caller, please state your name

16:56.540 --> 16:57.780
and affiliation for the record.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.980
You have one minute, your time starts now.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.500
I believe I'm calling for the next item as well.

17:08.500 --> 17:10.000
Okay, thank you very much.

17:10.000 --> 17:10.840
It is confusing.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.180
Next caller, please state your name

17:12.180 --> 17:13.500
and affiliation for the record.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.500
You have one minute, your time starts now.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.340
Good morning, it's Eric Premack

17:19.340 --> 17:21.420
with the Charter Schools Development Center.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.660
I wanna note that by any reasonable process or standard,

17:24.660 --> 17:29.180
the local denial was unlawful and therefore constituted

17:29.180 --> 17:32.260
an abuse of discretion that should be heard today.

17:32.260 --> 17:36.340
Therefore, we do urge the board to vote yes on this item

17:36.340 --> 17:38.740
and hear the public comment.

17:39.240 --> 17:44.000
I will note though that in my 30 years

17:44.000 --> 17:45.560
of working on education policy,

17:45.560 --> 17:48.200
the underlying statutes here are just horribly drafted

17:48.200 --> 17:49.720
and beg a lot of questions

17:50.600 --> 17:53.320
that the board needs to step up and deal with.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.680
We addressed these in the letter

17:54.680 --> 17:56.800
that we shared with the board last week

17:56.800 --> 17:59.300
and we hope that there will be a discussion of these

17:59.300 --> 18:00.760
more thoroughly in the future.

18:00.760 --> 18:01.600
Thank you.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.080
Thank you.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.780
Next caller, please state your name

18:07.800 --> 18:08.960
and affiliation for the record.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.960
You have one minute, your time starts now.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.240
Good morning, my name is Caroline Neuhaus-Wesley

18:16.240 --> 18:19.240
calling from Sephora Education Associates

18:19.240 --> 18:24.200
and I urge the State Board of Education to hear this item.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.840
There is enough evidence that there is a factual dispute

18:27.840 --> 18:29.800
that needs to be discussed.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.680
And since this is the first appeal coming to you

18:33.740 --> 18:38.220
since AB 1505, it is important that the board hear

18:38.220 --> 18:41.260
the appeal to determine the abuse of discretion

18:41.260 --> 18:43.740
as we move forward with charters in the future.

18:43.740 --> 18:44.580
Thank you.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.340
Thank you.

18:46.340 --> 18:48.780
That concludes public comment for item number 16.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.100
All right.

18:52.940 --> 18:54.940
Having concluded a public comment,

18:54.940 --> 18:59.620
I wanna open the floor for discussion with the board.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.580
Is there anyone who'd like to ask any questions

19:03.580 --> 19:04.840
or make any comments?

19:11.440 --> 19:15.600
I am seeing no hands going up.

19:15.600 --> 19:18.000
So would someone like to make a motion?

19:21.480 --> 19:26.480
I'll move that we hear the appeal

19:29.520 --> 19:33.280
and align to CDE's recommendation on this item.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.120
I second that.

19:35.040 --> 19:35.880
Thank you very much.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.240
Any other discussion?

19:38.240 --> 19:40.440
Brooks, can you call the roll for the vote?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.520
Member Rodriguez.

19:43.720 --> 19:44.680
Aye.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.980
Member Paquillo-Brownson.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.020
Yes.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.480
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

19:50.680 --> 19:51.680
Yes.

19:51.680 --> 19:52.520
Member Olken.

19:53.980 --> 19:54.960
Yes.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.020
Member McQuillan.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.240
Yes.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.120
Member Lewis.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.260
Yes.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.140
Member Rice, President Glover-Woods.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.600
Yes.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.440
Member Escobedo.

20:10.620 --> 20:11.780
Yes.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.860
President Darling-Hammond.

20:13.860 --> 20:14.700
Yes.

20:14.700 --> 20:15.540
Member Bonanca.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.340
Aye.

20:18.180 --> 20:19.020
Motion carries.

20:21.060 --> 20:22.660
All right.

20:22.660 --> 20:24.160
Thank you very much, Stephanie.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.860
And now we're gonna move on to item 17.

20:28.860 --> 20:32.420
Item 17 is a public hearing regarding the appeal

20:32.420 --> 20:34.620
of the denial of the petition for the establishment

20:34.620 --> 20:36.860
of the classroom-based charter school

20:36.860 --> 20:41.860
pursuant to California Education Code 47605K2,

20:42.340 --> 20:44.940
consideration of the allegations of abusive discretion

20:44.940 --> 20:46.860
made by Samoa Beach Academy,

20:46.860 --> 20:49.340
which was denied by the Northern Humboldt Union

20:49.340 --> 20:50.580
High School District

20:50.580 --> 20:53.100
and the Humboldt County Board of Education.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.740
The California Department of Education recommends

20:56.740 --> 21:01.660
that the SBE affirm the NHUHSD

21:01.700 --> 21:05.820
and HCBOE decisions to deny the petition

21:05.820 --> 21:09.620
to establish Samoa Beach Academy.

21:09.620 --> 21:13.860
The item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

21:13.860 --> 21:15.280
Stephanie, you may begin.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.180
Thank you.

21:18.180 --> 21:19.660
Good morning again.

21:19.660 --> 21:23.260
In this item, the California State Board of Education

21:23.260 --> 21:25.780
will hear the Samoa Beach Academy appeal

21:25.780 --> 21:30.780
pursuant to California Education Code 47605K2E,

21:30.900 --> 21:33.900
the SBE may either affirm the determination

21:33.900 --> 21:35.540
of the Governing Board of the School District

21:35.540 --> 21:37.260
or the County Board of Education,

21:37.260 --> 21:39.540
or both of those determinations,

21:39.540 --> 21:42.740
or reverse only upon a determination

21:42.740 --> 21:44.720
that there was an abuse of discretion.

21:45.620 --> 21:48.580
In the previous item, the SBE decided to hear the appeal

21:48.580 --> 21:50.860
based on the documentary record.

21:50.860 --> 21:52.740
So for those on the board that are used

21:52.740 --> 21:54.620
to the previous standard of review of appeals,

21:54.620 --> 21:57.460
this will look and feel different.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.380
The CDE is not reviewing the charter petition

21:59.380 --> 22:00.540
as it has in the past.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.140
We're reviewing this written submission

22:02.140 --> 22:04.500
by the charter petitioners with their specific citations

22:04.500 --> 22:06.060
to the documentary record,

22:06.060 --> 22:08.500
and any written opposition from the district and our county

22:08.500 --> 22:10.980
with their specific citations to the record

22:10.980 --> 22:14.140
to determine if there has been an abuse of discretion

22:14.140 --> 22:17.540
by the district or county boards of education or both.

22:17.540 --> 22:20.260
We focus our review on those written submissions.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.620
Each of the appeals that comes before this board

22:22.620 --> 22:24.940
will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

22:25.940 --> 22:29.740
The California Department of Education

22:31.740 --> 22:35.260
recommends that the SBE affirm

22:35.260 --> 22:38.060
the Northern Humboldt Union High School Districts

22:38.060 --> 22:41.580
and Humboldt County Board of Education's decisions

22:41.580 --> 22:44.620
to deny the petition to establish SBA,

22:44.620 --> 22:47.620
pursuant to Ed Code Section 47605K2D.

22:49.060 --> 22:52.540
This recommendation is based on the CDE's determination

22:52.540 --> 22:54.620
that the documentary record indicates

22:55.260 --> 22:57.900
that neither the N-H-U-H-S-D

22:57.900 --> 23:01.900
nor the H-C-B-O-E abused its discretion

23:01.900 --> 23:03.900
in denying SBA's petition.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.700
I will most likely be saying district and county

23:07.700 --> 23:10.420
moving forward because those initials

23:10.420 --> 23:13.460
are very hard to say without tripping up.

23:18.140 --> 23:19.740
So there was an information memo

23:19.740 --> 23:23.700
that was posted on June 30th that outlines the SBE's role

23:23.700 --> 23:26.260
under the new appeal and review standards.

23:26.260 --> 23:30.140
I will just cover a few of the points covered in that memo.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.260
The role of the SBE in charter schools

23:32.260 --> 23:36.100
pursuant to Ed Code Section 47605K2E,

23:36.100 --> 23:38.220
the role of the SBE is as follows.

23:38.220 --> 23:40.100
The SBE shall either hear the appeal

23:40.100 --> 23:41.820
or summarily deny review of the appeal

23:41.820 --> 23:43.300
based on the documentary record,

23:43.300 --> 23:45.220
which you did in the previous item.

23:45.220 --> 23:46.980
If the SBE hears the appeal,

23:46.980 --> 23:48.940
the board may affirm the determination

23:48.940 --> 23:50.660
of the governing board of the school district

23:50.660 --> 23:52.100
or the county board of education

23:52.100 --> 23:54.300
or both of those determinations

23:54.300 --> 23:57.180
or may reverse only upon a determination

23:57.180 --> 23:59.140
that there was an abuse of discretion.

24:01.260 --> 24:03.140
Abuse of discretion is the most

24:03.140 --> 24:05.260
deferential standard of review.

24:05.260 --> 24:08.020
The SBE is required to give deference to the decision

24:08.020 --> 24:09.420
of the school district governing board

24:09.420 --> 24:13.060
and county board of education to deny the petition.

24:13.060 --> 24:15.860
The SBE's review is limited to a determination

24:15.860 --> 24:17.540
of whether the district governing boards

24:17.540 --> 24:21.140
or county board's decision to deny the charter petition

24:21.140 --> 24:23.700
was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking

24:23.700 --> 24:27.820
in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

24:34.020 --> 24:37.580
The CDE's review of SBA's written submission,

24:37.580 --> 24:39.700
which detailed with specific citations

24:39.700 --> 24:41.300
to the documentary record,

24:41.300 --> 24:43.020
how the governing board of the school district

24:43.020 --> 24:46.740
and the county board of education abused their discretion.

24:46.740 --> 24:49.100
The CDE also reviewed the documentary record

24:49.100 --> 24:51.660
as cited by SBA in their written submission,

24:51.660 --> 24:53.100
districts and county's findings

24:53.100 --> 24:56.140
and the districts and county's opposition.

24:57.700 --> 25:01.180
Based on its review, the CDE will make a recommendation

25:01.180 --> 25:03.180
to the state board to either affirm or reverse

25:03.180 --> 25:05.020
the decisions of the governing board

25:05.020 --> 25:07.060
of the school district and the county

25:07.060 --> 25:09.540
based on the presence or absence of an abuse of discretion

25:09.540 --> 25:11.540
in the denial of the charter petition.

25:12.220 --> 25:17.220
So now we will move into Samoa Beach Academy's allegations

25:17.220 --> 25:18.420
of abuse of discretion.

25:21.140 --> 25:25.660
SBA states that the district and county's decisions

25:25.660 --> 25:27.580
to deny the charter petition

25:27.580 --> 25:31.020
are not supported by substantial evidence.

25:31.020 --> 25:33.020
SBA's written submission detailing

25:33.020 --> 25:35.700
the specific allegations regarding the district's findings

25:35.700 --> 25:39.700
can be found on pages 560 to 560 of the SBA's report.

25:39.700 --> 25:44.180
Can be found on pages 562 to 580 of the documentary record

25:44.180 --> 25:46.420
from the HCBOE.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.180
SBA's written submission detailing

25:48.180 --> 25:52.340
the specific allegations regarding HCBOE's findings

25:52.340 --> 25:55.180
can be found on page 537 to 552

25:55.180 --> 25:58.860
of the documentary record from the county.

25:58.860 --> 26:01.580
So all of the detailed information regarding their claims

26:01.580 --> 26:03.980
can be found in item attachment one.

26:05.620 --> 26:08.500
And we will be going into some detail in later slides.

26:10.700 --> 26:16.220
SBA states that the district and county

26:16.220 --> 26:19.060
did not proceed in the matter required by law

26:19.060 --> 26:20.740
and therefore abused their discretion

26:20.740 --> 26:22.460
in denying SBA's petition.

26:25.060 --> 26:27.420
The district failed to comply with equal time

26:27.420 --> 26:29.260
and procedures guarantees.

26:29.260 --> 26:32.220
The district and county each failed to comply

26:32.220 --> 26:34.260
with statutory requirement to maintain

26:34.260 --> 26:35.820
and produce a transcript record.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.780
And the county impermissibly denied the charter petition

26:39.780 --> 26:43.260
on the basis that SBA did not re-obtain signatures.

26:50.340 --> 26:53.660
Districts and counties oppositions to SBA's appeal.

26:56.180 --> 27:01.300
NHUHSD's opposition states that its denial of SBA's petition

27:01.300 --> 27:03.060
was based on evidence demonstrating

27:03.060 --> 27:04.580
the following findings.

27:04.580 --> 27:07.140
You can find that on pages six through 22.

27:08.140 --> 27:11.300
The SBA presents an unsound educational program

27:11.300 --> 27:14.380
for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school

27:14.380 --> 27:16.940
and the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely

27:16.940 --> 27:18.980
to successfully implement the program

27:18.980 --> 27:20.460
set forth in the petition.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.820
Additionally, the district argues that the procedural claims

27:24.820 --> 27:27.740
and SBA's appeal do not demonstrate

27:27.740 --> 27:29.100
an abuse of discretion.

27:35.300 --> 27:40.300
The county, did I skip a slide, no I didn't, okay.

27:44.180 --> 27:46.260
The county opposition to SBA's appeal.

27:48.860 --> 27:52.140
HCBOE's opposition states that it did not abuse

27:52.140 --> 27:54.260
its discretion by not recording the meeting

27:54.260 --> 27:56.740
at which SBA's petition was denied

27:56.740 --> 28:00.260
and that its findings in support of denying SBA's petition

28:00.260 --> 28:02.500
met all requirements of the law

28:02.500 --> 28:04.660
and that could be found in their opposition letter

28:04.660 --> 28:05.740
pages four to nine.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.780
The county denied SBA's petition

28:08.780 --> 28:10.980
based on the following findings.

28:10.980 --> 28:14.020
The SBA petition presents an unsound educational program

28:14.020 --> 28:17.220
for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.620
The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely

28:19.620 --> 28:21.580
to successfully implement the program

28:21.580 --> 28:22.980
set forth in the petition.

28:23.980 --> 28:26.180
The petition does not contain the number

28:26.180 --> 28:27.940
of signatures required.

28:33.180 --> 28:37.780
Based on the CDE's review of SBA's written submission,

28:37.780 --> 28:41.060
documentary record, and supporting documentation

28:41.060 --> 28:45.820
and the NHUHSD's and HCBOE's opposition,

28:45.820 --> 28:49.260
the CDE has determined that the district and county

28:49.260 --> 28:50.940
did not abuse their discretion

28:50.940 --> 28:53.100
in the denial of the SBA petition.

28:54.260 --> 28:57.260
A summary of the district and county's findings

28:57.260 --> 28:59.500
regarding the SBA petition,

28:59.500 --> 29:02.100
SBA's allegations of abuse of discretion

29:02.100 --> 29:03.860
and the district and county's oppositions

29:03.860 --> 29:06.060
are all provided in attachment one.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.660
CDE's review of district's findings.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.700
After reviewing the documentary record

29:17.700 --> 29:18.940
and supporting documentation

29:18.940 --> 29:21.180
submitted by the parties to this appeal,

29:21.180 --> 29:26.180
the CDE has determined that NHUHSD's findings

29:26.180 --> 29:27.660
were supported by evidence.

29:28.660 --> 29:33.380
NHUHSD based their decision to deny SBA's charter

29:33.380 --> 29:34.580
on the following findings,

29:34.580 --> 29:36.100
which were supported by evidence

29:36.100 --> 29:37.660
in the documentary record.

29:40.180 --> 29:42.940
The charter school presents an unsound educational program

29:42.940 --> 29:46.020
for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

29:46.020 --> 29:48.140
The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely

29:48.140 --> 29:49.900
to successfully implement the program

29:49.900 --> 29:51.300
set forth in the petition.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.460
The district finding of unsound educational program.

29:58.260 --> 30:00.940
The district's written finding set forth specific facts

30:00.940 --> 30:03.420
based on evidence in the documentary record,

30:03.420 --> 30:05.660
including, but not limited to,

30:05.660 --> 30:07.900
proposed course offerings and staffing plans

30:07.900 --> 30:10.020
raise concerns that the educational program

30:10.020 --> 30:13.780
is not likely to be of educational benefit to students.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.820
SBA's budgeted per special education pupil spending

30:16.820 --> 30:19.380
is lower than comparable schools in the area

30:19.380 --> 30:21.060
and does not account for transportation

30:21.060 --> 30:23.060
or an alternative placement.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.140
The petition's description

30:24.140 --> 30:25.540
of the special education program

30:25.540 --> 30:27.620
includes the use of paraprofessionals

30:28.580 --> 30:31.020
are not included in the petition's budget.

30:31.020 --> 30:34.140
SBA proposes both resource specialist program services

30:34.140 --> 30:35.580
and special day class placements,

30:35.580 --> 30:37.020
but their staffing plan includes

30:37.020 --> 30:39.900
only a single education teacher.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.420
The district finding of demonstrably unlikely

30:46.420 --> 30:49.420
to successfully implement the program.

30:49.420 --> 30:51.900
The district's written finding set forth specific facts

30:51.900 --> 30:53.860
based on evidence in the documentary record,

30:53.860 --> 30:55.900
including, but not limited to.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.180
SBA's special education budget includes errors

30:58.180 --> 31:00.180
in calculating special education revenues

31:00.180 --> 31:02.340
for unduplicated students.

31:02.340 --> 31:04.180
SBA's budget assumes they will not need

31:04.180 --> 31:08.460
to serve severe students that produce related high costs.

31:08.460 --> 31:10.580
As an independent charter, one high cost student

31:10.580 --> 31:13.780
could be devastating to a budget with virtually no reserve.

31:13.780 --> 31:16.220
Several figures in SBA's cash flow projections

31:16.220 --> 31:19.020
are unclear as to how the calculations were reached.

31:19.020 --> 31:21.660
High facilities costs will require SBA's enrollment

31:21.660 --> 31:25.380
to grow at a rate far exceeding most charter schools.

31:25.380 --> 31:28.540
The multi-tiered system of support, MTSS,

31:28.540 --> 31:31.020
is a framework requiring collaborative work,

31:31.020 --> 31:33.460
robust use of data, intensive training,

31:33.460 --> 31:35.180
and professional development.

31:35.180 --> 31:38.900
The petition proposes only a .5 full-time

31:38.900 --> 31:41.620
equivalent counselor to support MTSS.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.340
The petition budget does not allocate

31:44.340 --> 31:47.180
specific funding for MTSS.

31:47.180 --> 31:49.540
The petition's proposed teacher compensation

31:49.540 --> 31:52.700
is less competitive than other local employers.

31:53.700 --> 31:57.820
The CDE reviewed the county's findings.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.980
After reviewing the complete documentary record

31:59.980 --> 32:03.300
and supporting documentation submitted

32:03.300 --> 32:05.740
by the parties to this appeal, the CDE has determined

32:05.740 --> 32:10.340
that two of HCBOE's three findings were supported

32:10.340 --> 32:13.540
by evidence in the documentary record.

32:14.380 --> 32:17.180
The charter school presents an unsound educational program

32:17.180 --> 32:20.260
for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school,

32:20.260 --> 32:22.500
and the petitioners are demonstrably unlikely

32:22.500 --> 32:24.580
to successfully implement the program

32:24.580 --> 32:27.340
set forth in the petition.

32:30.580 --> 32:33.780
476056C states that the governing board

32:33.780 --> 32:36.460
must make written findings setting forth specific facts

32:36.460 --> 32:39.140
to support one or more findings

32:39.140 --> 32:41.220
when they review a charter petition.

32:43.540 --> 32:46.780
The county finding of unsound educational program.

32:46.780 --> 32:49.260
The county's written findings set forth specific facts

32:49.260 --> 32:51.660
based on evidence in the documentary record,

32:51.660 --> 32:53.700
including but not limited to.

32:53.700 --> 32:56.660
The design of SBA's career technical education program

32:56.660 --> 32:58.140
limits student choice and is likely

32:58.140 --> 33:00.340
to compromise student engagement.

33:00.340 --> 33:02.380
Proposed course offerings and staffing plans

33:02.380 --> 33:04.260
raise concerns that the educational program

33:04.260 --> 33:07.380
is not likely to be of educational benefit to students.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.620
MTSS is not a specific intervention,

33:09.620 --> 33:12.100
but instead is a framework around

33:12.100 --> 33:14.500
which evidence-based interventions are built.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.140
Instead, the petition gives a formula

33:16.140 --> 33:19.020
for when certain interventions are used.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.500
The proposed program emphasizes supporting students

33:21.500 --> 33:24.260
through MTSS and restorative practices.

33:24.260 --> 33:26.620
Staff in the program must have designated time

33:26.620 --> 33:29.220
and effective training to implement the petition.

33:29.220 --> 33:32.700
SBA underestimates the likely English learner percentage

33:32.700 --> 33:34.300
based on its proposed location,

33:34.300 --> 33:36.300
and is unclear how the proposed program

33:36.300 --> 33:38.540
can support a larger EL population.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.620
Continuing with the unsound educational program findings,

33:45.620 --> 33:50.620
the county writes the petition proposes

33:51.540 --> 33:54.140
a resource specialist program model of services

33:54.140 --> 33:55.980
with push-in and pull-out services,

33:55.980 --> 33:59.020
and a special day class, and online specialist programs,

33:59.020 --> 34:02.140
all taught and or coordinated by a single teacher.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.980
SBA's special education description

34:03.980 --> 34:05.580
includes the use of paraprofessionals,

34:05.580 --> 34:06.700
but the budget does not include

34:06.700 --> 34:08.580
funding for paraprofessionals.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.900
The petition proposes to secure

34:10.900 --> 34:12.740
the special education staff and services

34:12.740 --> 34:15.820
as needed with assistance from SBA's SELPA

34:15.820 --> 34:17.860
and or County Office of Education.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.620
But the petitioners have not reached out

34:19.620 --> 34:21.900
to the humble Del Norte SELPA

34:21.900 --> 34:24.100
or the El Dorado County Charter SELPA

34:24.100 --> 34:26.060
regarding membership and or what supports

34:26.060 --> 34:28.420
could be provided by the SELPA.

34:28.420 --> 34:30.900
SBA's budget does not account for realistic costs

34:30.900 --> 34:33.340
associated with special education

34:33.340 --> 34:35.420
in the first year of operations.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.420
The petition's budget did not include costs

34:37.420 --> 34:40.780
that accurately reflect the scope for the MEALS program.

34:44.100 --> 34:46.220
The county finding for demonstrably unlikely

34:46.220 --> 34:48.020
to successfully implement program.

34:49.820 --> 34:52.700
The county's written finding set forth specific facts

34:52.700 --> 34:55.580
based on evidence in the documentary record,

34:55.580 --> 34:58.180
including, but not limited to,

34:58.180 --> 35:00.300
SBA projects unrealistic enrollment

35:00.300 --> 35:01.540
that far exceeds the enrollment

35:01.540 --> 35:03.260
of charter schools in the area.

35:03.260 --> 35:05.740
SBA projects a 95% attendance rate

35:05.740 --> 35:07.540
which exceeds local high school averages

35:07.540 --> 35:09.020
in both local districts,

35:09.020 --> 35:13.300
leading to over projection of LCFF funds.

35:13.300 --> 35:16.020
SBA's petition does not indicate any student support

35:16.020 --> 35:17.940
shown to increase attendance.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.260
SBA's special education budget includes errors

35:20.260 --> 35:22.180
in calculating special education revenues

35:22.180 --> 35:23.820
for unduplicated students,

35:23.820 --> 35:25.820
and there is no budget for food service staff,

35:25.820 --> 35:27.500
maintenance custodial staff,

35:27.500 --> 35:30.340
paraprofessional staff, or a secretary registrar,

35:30.340 --> 35:34.100
each of which are contemplated in the petition.

35:34.100 --> 35:36.700
The petition states that food services will be outsourced.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.860
However, the budget does not account for staffing

35:38.860 --> 35:41.780
to heat and serve meals or to supervise meal times.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.060
In addition, SBA's proposed lease

35:47.060 --> 35:48.380
includes an annual increase

35:48.380 --> 35:51.380
but does not reflect a standard percentage-based increase.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.860
Lease cost for the five-year term as follows,

35:53.860 --> 35:56.380
and it is on the screen.

35:56.380 --> 35:58.380
In addition to rent and utilities,

35:58.380 --> 36:01.820
SBA's lease requires SBA to pay all property expenses,

36:01.820 --> 36:03.060
including real estate tax,

36:03.060 --> 36:04.860
building insurance, and maintenance.

36:09.220 --> 36:11.260
Continuing under demonstratively unlikely

36:11.260 --> 36:12.900
to successfully implement program,

36:13.900 --> 36:16.700
the county finds SBA's petition

36:16.700 --> 36:18.860
does not indicate how the petitioners

36:18.860 --> 36:22.100
will overcome the difficulty of hiring qualified teachers,

36:22.100 --> 36:24.500
especially CTE teachers in Humboldt County,

36:24.500 --> 36:27.140
where the teacher shortage is potentially leading

36:27.140 --> 36:29.740
to a CTE program crisis.

36:29.740 --> 36:32.660
SBA's proposed staffing plan includes a greater workload

36:32.660 --> 36:34.820
and lower compensation than local areas,

36:34.820 --> 36:36.700
schools, and districts.

36:36.700 --> 36:39.540
SBA's former lead petitioner and executive director,

36:39.540 --> 36:42.060
Katherine Scott, has withdrawn from the charter.

36:42.060 --> 36:45.300
SBA's proposed program of integrated core course content

36:45.300 --> 36:49.420
and CTE standards require the necessary background

36:49.420 --> 36:52.620
to ensure successful implementation of that program.

36:52.620 --> 36:54.820
Petitioners have not indicated who will serve

36:54.820 --> 36:57.100
as the school's executive director.

37:00.940 --> 37:04.540
The CDE also reviewed the claims of procedural violations.

37:06.860 --> 37:09.820
SBA alleges that there are procedural violations

37:09.820 --> 37:13.180
and that each violation constitutes an abuse of discretion.

37:14.180 --> 37:18.900
Ed Code section 47605 K2E requires

37:18.900 --> 37:21.140
the State Board of Education to determine

37:21.140 --> 37:23.380
whether the district's and county's decisions

37:23.380 --> 37:27.100
to deny the SBA petition in totality

37:27.100 --> 37:30.020
constitute an abuse of discretion.

37:30.020 --> 37:33.260
The CDE does not find that the procedural violations

37:33.260 --> 37:35.620
alleged give rise to a determination

37:35.620 --> 37:37.660
that there was an abuse of discretion.

37:40.340 --> 37:44.740
Equivalent time and procedures.

37:44.740 --> 37:49.940
And so these are the alleged violations submitted by SBA.

37:51.540 --> 37:54.580
Ed Code section 47605 B states,

37:54.580 --> 37:56.500
at the public hearing at which the governing board

37:56.500 --> 37:59.180
of the school district will either grant or deny the charter,

37:59.180 --> 38:02.660
petitioners shall have equivalent time and procedures

38:02.660 --> 38:04.420
to present evidence and testimony

38:04.420 --> 38:07.260
to respond to the staff recommendations and findings.

38:08.260 --> 38:11.020
SBA did not meet their burden of showing

38:11.020 --> 38:15.620
how the district did not provide equivalent time and procedures.

38:15.620 --> 38:18.620
For example, the district staff asked petitioners

38:18.620 --> 38:21.420
if 10 minutes were enough for petitioners' presentation

38:21.420 --> 38:23.260
and petitioners agreed.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.380
And all this can be found in the documentary record

38:25.380 --> 38:27.580
in the pages that are listed.

38:27.580 --> 38:30.620
Petitioners presented for approximately 11 minutes.

38:30.620 --> 38:34.700
District staff and legal counsel presented approximately 26 minutes.

38:34.820 --> 38:37.740
However, district staff did not limit petitioners' time.

38:38.860 --> 38:41.700
The district board members deliberated and heard answers

38:41.700 --> 38:44.380
to their questions of district staff and legal counsel.

38:47.100 --> 38:54.100
Neither N-H-U-H-S-D nor H-C-B-O-E produced a written transcript.

38:54.100 --> 38:57.660
However, SBA has not made any claims

38:57.660 --> 39:00.900
indicating how the absence of a transcript

39:00.900 --> 39:04.940
impacted the district or county's denial of SBA's petition.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.020
After reviewing the complete documentary record

39:11.020 --> 39:13.420
and supporting documentation submitted by the parties

39:13.420 --> 39:16.420
to this appeal, the CDE has determined

39:17.340 --> 39:23.860
that neither the N-H-U-H-S-D nor H-C-B-O-E

39:24.420 --> 39:27.580
abused their discretion in reaching their decisions

39:27.580 --> 39:29.620
to deny SBA's charter petition.

39:30.620 --> 39:36.860
Therefore, the CDE recommends the SBE affirm N-H-U-H-S-Ds

39:36.860 --> 39:42.380
and H-C-B-O-E's decisions to deny SBA's charter petition.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.260
And that concludes my presentation.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.780
Thank you very much, Stephanie.

39:55.780 --> 39:57.740
We're going to open the public hearing.

39:58.540 --> 40:03.940
I hereby open the public hearing at 9.55 a.m.

40:03.940 --> 40:06.660
We will hear first from petitioners representing

40:06.660 --> 40:08.780
Samoa Beach Academy Charter School.

40:09.380 --> 40:12.100
They will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

40:12.700 --> 40:15.860
We will then hear from Northern Humboldt Union High School

40:15.860 --> 40:17.980
and the Humboldt County Office of Education,

40:17.980 --> 40:19.940
who denied the charter appeal.

40:19.940 --> 40:22.380
They will have 12 minutes to make their presentation.

40:23.060 --> 40:28.060
The district and county will have a combined total of 12 minutes,

40:28.060 --> 40:29.140
to be clear.

40:29.140 --> 40:31.580
After the presentation, we'll open up the phone line

40:31.580 --> 40:33.620
for public comment from individuals

40:33.620 --> 40:35.660
who are not part of the presentation.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.820
The petitioner may begin. You have 12 minutes.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.700
Our video has been turned off.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.700
I guess we need to ask the folks

40:49.700 --> 40:52.540
who are managing the technology to turn you on.

40:54.140 --> 40:55.140
Thank you.

41:01.020 --> 41:02.020
You're on.

41:02.020 --> 41:03.580
Okay, thank you very much.

41:03.580 --> 41:06.180
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and board members.

41:06.180 --> 41:08.780
My name is David Lawn, and I am the lead petitioner

41:08.780 --> 41:11.140
and a board member for the Samoa Beach Academy.

41:12.140 --> 41:14.980
As a career educator, I've spent close to four years

41:14.980 --> 41:16.300
in the Samoa Beach Academy.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.900
I've spent close to four years in education in various roles,

41:19.900 --> 41:23.420
from classified positions as an instructional aide and custodian,

41:24.180 --> 41:27.260
to a certificated positions as a teacher,

41:27.260 --> 41:29.380
athletic director, coach, and administrator,

41:29.900 --> 41:31.980
including as an assistant superintendent

41:31.980 --> 41:34.700
in the Northern Humboldt Union High School District.

41:34.700 --> 41:38.420
I currently am working in education as an administrative coach,

41:38.420 --> 41:41.700
helping educators complete their administrative credential.

41:42.380 --> 41:45.180
I'm so pleased to be a part of the extremely well-qualified

41:45.180 --> 41:49.820
petitioning team behind the proposed charter school

41:49.820 --> 41:52.020
that we are supporting.

41:52.020 --> 41:56.420
Samoa Beach Academy will bring much needed full-time CTE programs

41:56.420 --> 41:58.820
in Humboldt County that will accommodate the needs

41:58.820 --> 42:00.500
of so many students in our area.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.500
SBA is focused on individual students.

42:05.580 --> 42:07.660
Janelle, I think you can go to the next slide, please.

42:07.660 --> 42:08.980
Thank you.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.980
As we will be a small high school with small class sizes,

42:12.700 --> 42:15.580
SBA will offer three CTE pathways,

42:15.580 --> 42:18.940
including residential and commercial construction,

42:18.940 --> 42:21.220
patient care, and business management.

42:22.180 --> 42:25.580
SBA is committed to career skills and financial literacy

42:26.140 --> 42:29.900
with internship opportunities and required courses.

42:30.780 --> 42:35.020
Finally, SBA will offer both college and career-bound programs,

42:35.020 --> 42:39.260
allowing students to meet A2G requirements and CTE coursework.

42:39.980 --> 42:43.820
Now, we'd like to hand over our presentation to our legal counsel.

42:43.820 --> 42:46.700
We feel this is important due to the legal changes

42:46.700 --> 42:49.100
and how the state considers charter appeals.

42:50.780 --> 42:52.300
Thank you, Dave, and good morning,

42:52.300 --> 42:54.700
Board President Darling-Hammond, board members.

42:54.700 --> 42:55.980
My name is Janelle Ruhle.

42:55.980 --> 42:58.620
I'm an attorney with the law offices of Young, Minion Corps.

42:59.180 --> 43:00.940
I'm certain that you're going to hear a lot today

43:00.940 --> 43:02.780
about the importance of your vote,

43:02.780 --> 43:05.340
and I will lend my voice to that chorus.

43:05.340 --> 43:08.300
I can assure you that a lot of folks, including a lot of lawyers,

43:08.300 --> 43:10.620
are going to be paying attention to today's outcome.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.940
As we work through the issues,

43:12.940 --> 43:15.260
I know that we will all be mindful of precedent.

43:16.300 --> 43:19.180
We ask you today to determine that the district and county

43:19.180 --> 43:22.620
abuse their discretion in denying the Samoa Beach Academy Charter

43:23.180 --> 43:25.900
and to therefore reverse those denial decisions.

43:26.620 --> 43:29.340
We ask that you take action to guard the protections

43:29.340 --> 43:30.460
that we want in the law.

43:31.020 --> 43:33.020
We ask that you ensure meaningful appeals.

43:34.060 --> 43:37.100
I am so proud to represent Samoa Beach Academy.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.700
The team behind this charter petition

43:38.700 --> 43:42.620
is full of committed business owners, volunteers, and educators

43:42.620 --> 43:45.420
who are passionate about increasing choice for students

43:45.420 --> 43:47.980
and creating a viable career path for them.

43:48.780 --> 43:51.660
This part of the state is desperately in need of trained workers.

43:51.660 --> 43:53.900
I have no doubt Samoa can deliver them.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.820
This is a charter school that will succeed.

43:56.780 --> 43:59.820
So this morning, we'll talk about defining abuse of discretion,

43:59.820 --> 44:01.100
the role of the state board,

44:01.100 --> 44:03.500
and then applying the definition to Samoa Beach.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.780
First up, defining abuse of discretion.

44:07.420 --> 44:08.860
It's important to have a definition

44:08.860 --> 44:10.780
so that we know what it is that we're aiming for.

44:10.780 --> 44:12.300
We know what our target is.

44:12.300 --> 44:15.100
Without a definition, we just don't even know where to begin.

44:15.660 --> 44:19.580
So as we've heard, this term is not defined in the Ed Code,

44:19.580 --> 44:20.620
the Charter Schools Act.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.700
We don't have regulations yet in this area.

44:23.420 --> 44:25.180
So we look to statute and case law.

44:25.900 --> 44:27.660
Samoa Beach is proposing a definition

44:27.660 --> 44:31.260
that comes from the Code of Civil Procedure as well as case law

44:31.260 --> 44:34.300
that an abuse of discretion is established when the agency,

44:34.380 --> 44:37.020
one, has not proceeded in a manner required by law,

44:37.900 --> 44:41.100
two, the order or decision is not supported by the findings,

44:41.100 --> 44:44.060
or three, the findings are not supported by evidence.

44:44.060 --> 44:45.500
So the or is important there,

44:45.500 --> 44:46.940
and I'll come back to that a little later.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.900
The CDE's definition, also up on the screen,

44:50.620 --> 44:53.580
has five prongs, arbitrary, capricious,

44:53.580 --> 44:55.900
entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

44:55.900 --> 44:58.220
unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

44:58.220 --> 45:00.220
Again, that definition also includes an or.

45:00.220 --> 45:03.180
So in practical terms, we don't see these two definitions

45:03.180 --> 45:05.500
as very far off from one another.

45:05.500 --> 45:09.980
So we're not here today to argue against the CDE's proposed definition.

45:09.980 --> 45:11.980
In fact, there really is some clear overlap

45:11.980 --> 45:14.220
between the two definitions, between the standards.

45:15.180 --> 45:17.740
And the prongs that are at issue for Samoa

45:17.740 --> 45:19.740
are precisely the ones that are overlapping,

45:19.740 --> 45:20.940
that they're in the middle.

45:21.660 --> 45:24.060
So I mentioned the or in the two different standards.

45:25.020 --> 45:28.540
Having an or legally makes the definitions different

45:28.540 --> 45:30.860
legally makes the definitions disjunctive.

45:30.860 --> 45:33.660
That means that we only need one of those prongs to be triggered

45:33.660 --> 45:35.980
in order to find an abusive discretion.

45:35.980 --> 45:40.540
The district, for example, has to only be arbitrary or capricious,

45:40.540 --> 45:43.660
or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

45:43.660 --> 45:46.060
or unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

45:46.780 --> 45:48.540
We only need one of those five prongs.

45:49.100 --> 45:52.300
What Samoa is here to show you is that the unlawful prong was triggered

45:52.300 --> 45:53.900
both by the district and the county.

45:56.700 --> 45:57.740
I want to be clear about this.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.300
An unlawful act is an abuse of discretion.

46:01.020 --> 46:03.500
An unlawful act is an abuse of discretion.

46:04.220 --> 46:07.100
We'll demonstrate five different unlawful acts in this case.

46:08.460 --> 46:12.380
You may hear from others that just procedure,

46:12.380 --> 46:16.620
or mere procedure, or only procedure is somehow not a violation of law.

46:17.820 --> 46:19.580
I heard that myself from the CDE.

46:20.300 --> 46:22.540
You might also hear that a minor violation of law

46:22.540 --> 46:24.300
can simply be shrugged away.

46:24.300 --> 46:25.260
But this is untrue.

46:26.220 --> 46:28.460
When AB 1505 became law,

46:28.460 --> 46:31.980
it enshrined several new protections for charter petitioners and statute.

46:32.540 --> 46:35.660
They're all plainly written with no need for interpretation.

46:35.660 --> 46:37.820
These provisions must be protected today.

46:39.020 --> 46:40.300
Now, I'm not a criminal lawyer,

46:40.300 --> 46:43.340
but I did take criminal law and evidence classes in law school,

46:43.980 --> 46:47.180
where we talked a lot about a concept called the fruit of the poisonous tree.

46:47.980 --> 46:49.340
This concept is evocative.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.380
If the government or a prosecutor does not observe

46:52.380 --> 46:55.020
all procedural rights during an investigation,

46:55.100 --> 46:56.860
then the results of that investigation,

46:57.500 --> 46:59.420
evidence, tips, confession,

46:59.420 --> 47:01.420
all of those things are forever tainted.

47:01.420 --> 47:03.500
They cannot be relied upon for a conviction.

47:04.140 --> 47:05.500
If the tree is poisoned,

47:05.500 --> 47:07.260
the fruit that comes from it is poisoned.

47:08.540 --> 47:10.380
This concept is echoed in civil law.

47:10.940 --> 47:13.180
If a school district or charter school governing board

47:13.180 --> 47:17.260
posts the agenda for their regular meeting only 71 hours in advance,

47:17.820 --> 47:20.300
the entire meeting is unlawful under the Brown Act.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.420
Any actions taken in that meeting would be void.

47:24.380 --> 47:27.420
No one would argue with a straight face that 72 hours

47:27.420 --> 47:29.500
is really just a minor provision of the Brown Act.

47:30.460 --> 47:32.460
Even this appeal you heard from CDE,

47:32.460 --> 47:35.100
if we hadn't gotten this appeal in timely,

47:35.100 --> 47:37.340
we wouldn't be here before you today.

47:37.340 --> 47:38.700
These things have to make a difference.

47:38.700 --> 47:39.660
They have to matter.

47:40.940 --> 47:44.140
So CDE's approach appears to be the exact opposite,

47:44.140 --> 47:48.460
where if they find just one piece of fruit from that tree is ripe,

47:48.460 --> 47:51.900
then the whole tree must be healthy and nothing else matters.

47:52.860 --> 47:55.020
So we argue, again, the opposite.

47:56.300 --> 47:59.340
Procedural protections are vital to citizens and entities.

47:59.340 --> 48:00.620
They're enshrined in statute,

48:00.620 --> 48:02.940
just like the ones that we're talking about this morning,

48:02.940 --> 48:06.300
and they cannot be dismissed as just procedural protections.

48:06.300 --> 48:09.740
These are laws and the meaning behind them has to be there.

48:12.620 --> 48:14.540
So the role of the state board,

48:14.540 --> 48:15.820
you've heard that it's different,

48:15.820 --> 48:17.500
you're experiencing now that it's different.

48:18.380 --> 48:21.740
State board no longer gets to review a charter with fresh eyes.

48:22.060 --> 48:25.020
Making its own findings around educational soundness,

48:25.020 --> 48:26.220
reasonably comprehensive,

48:27.020 --> 48:28.620
and the other standards that you're used to.

48:29.740 --> 48:32.380
Now the state board's role is limited to evaluating

48:32.380 --> 48:35.020
whether the district or county, or both,

48:35.020 --> 48:37.420
abuse their discretion and denying the charter.

48:37.420 --> 48:40.060
That means that we're confined to the underlying record.

48:40.060 --> 48:42.220
The state board is more like an umpire now,

48:42.220 --> 48:43.580
rather than a trier of fact.

48:44.380 --> 48:45.340
In that umpire role,

48:45.340 --> 48:47.340
the board is bound to follow the law

48:47.340 --> 48:50.940
and to reverse the denials if it finds abuse of discretion.

48:52.700 --> 48:54.940
So the CDE, they actually did conclude

48:54.940 --> 48:57.980
that the district and county violated the law.

48:57.980 --> 49:00.780
That was in some of their findings in their report.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.860
Inexplicably though,

49:02.860 --> 49:04.460
they've decided that violating the law

49:04.460 --> 49:07.020
is not sufficient for meeting the unlawful prong.

49:08.140 --> 49:10.620
The CDE appears to conclude again

49:10.620 --> 49:13.260
that if there was at least one element of factual accuracy

49:13.260 --> 49:15.500
in the denials, some good fruit,

49:15.500 --> 49:18.860
then there could not possibly be an abuse of discretion,

49:18.860 --> 49:21.020
no matter how many other laws were violated.

49:21.740 --> 49:24.060
This approach taken to its logical conclusion

49:24.060 --> 49:26.540
means that virtually no charter appeal

49:26.540 --> 49:28.300
will ever result in reversal

49:28.300 --> 49:30.860
if there's even one shred of legal accuracy in the record.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.700
We're asking you today to act independently

49:34.700 --> 49:35.980
and reverse these denials.

49:36.700 --> 49:38.860
If you don't, it will be a death knell

49:38.860 --> 49:41.500
to the procedural protections for charter petitioners

49:41.500 --> 49:43.100
that are written into statute.

49:43.100 --> 49:46.300
If you do not reverse here with clearly legal violations,

49:47.100 --> 49:50.060
no school district or county anywhere in the state,

49:50.060 --> 49:52.540
any time will follow any of these requirements.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.140
There simply won't be any consequences

49:54.140 --> 49:55.180
for not following them.

49:57.020 --> 49:58.620
Okay, so what are these abuses?

49:59.340 --> 50:01.900
The first abuse is that the district did not comply

50:01.900 --> 50:04.700
with the equal time guarantees during the decision meeting.

50:04.700 --> 50:07.580
Samoa got about 11 minutes to present

50:07.580 --> 50:10.060
and the district staff and council took 31 minutes,

50:10.060 --> 50:11.260
nearly three times as long.

50:12.540 --> 50:15.660
You've heard that Samoa only asked for 10 minutes.

50:15.660 --> 50:16.380
That's true.

50:16.380 --> 50:17.740
We got an open-ended question.

50:17.740 --> 50:19.340
How long do you think you need?

50:19.340 --> 50:21.500
We said 10 minutes because that's what's most common.

50:22.300 --> 50:25.340
It was on the district conform to what we said.

50:25.340 --> 50:27.580
If we said 10 minutes and we took 10 minutes,

50:27.580 --> 50:30.300
then they needed to limit themselves to 10 minutes.

50:30.300 --> 50:31.180
They didn't do that.

50:32.140 --> 50:33.340
The loss is equal time.

50:33.340 --> 50:34.700
Samoa didn't get in.

50:34.700 --> 50:36.380
Therefore, there's an abuse of discretion.

50:37.820 --> 50:40.460
Abuse number two, the district failed to comply

50:40.460 --> 50:44.940
with equal equivalent procedure guarantees as well.

50:44.940 --> 50:49.260
They never posted Samoa's response to the staff report

50:49.260 --> 50:50.300
with their meeting agenda.

50:51.580 --> 50:54.460
If we don't have any belief or expectation

50:54.460 --> 50:57.900
that the district board members read our responses,

50:57.900 --> 50:59.420
but they did read the staff report,

50:59.420 --> 51:01.100
which was posted with the agenda,

51:01.100 --> 51:02.780
there's no way that we can know

51:02.780 --> 51:04.220
that we had equivalent procedures.

51:05.180 --> 51:07.420
And if the district didn't read our responses,

51:07.420 --> 51:09.260
of course their decision was prejudiced.

51:10.540 --> 51:12.780
Abuse number three, the district and county each failed

51:12.780 --> 51:14.220
to comply with the legal requirement

51:14.220 --> 51:15.420
to prepare a transcript.

51:16.140 --> 51:18.060
The CDE is trying to say that it doesn't matter

51:18.060 --> 51:20.300
that there's no transcript, but it does.

51:20.300 --> 51:24.060
The ACCS almost derailed this whole thing.

51:24.060 --> 51:25.980
There were commissioners from the ACCS

51:25.980 --> 51:28.540
who wanted to throw out the entire appeal

51:28.540 --> 51:29.740
because there was no transcript,

51:29.740 --> 51:32.220
because they see this like an expulsion appeal.

51:32.220 --> 51:34.620
And if there's no transcript on an expulsion appeal,

51:34.620 --> 51:39.180
you have no idea whether or not the underlying triers

51:39.180 --> 51:41.900
of facts actually followed what the law was.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.220
So the transcript is extremely important.

51:44.220 --> 51:49.220
And the CDE made a decree that a transcript can be a video,

51:49.740 --> 51:51.500
but it's just simply not true.

51:52.620 --> 51:54.220
A transcript can be made from a video,

51:54.220 --> 51:56.140
but a video is not a transcript.

51:56.140 --> 51:57.180
Transcript is a writing.

51:57.180 --> 51:58.620
It's something you can print out

51:58.620 --> 52:00.060
and put in a binder and read.

52:01.260 --> 52:04.380
So not having the transcript nearly derailed this appeal.

52:06.540 --> 52:09.100
The fourth abuse of discretion is that the county board

52:09.100 --> 52:11.500
made up out of thin air a new reason for denial

52:11.500 --> 52:13.580
and then denied the charter because of that.

52:13.580 --> 52:15.260
We simply don't have a requirement

52:16.380 --> 52:19.260
to gather new signatures at the appeal stage.

52:20.460 --> 52:22.860
The CDE found that this was a violation as well.

52:23.820 --> 52:25.740
And then last, abuse number five.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.660
If somehow I haven't convinced you about procedure,

52:30.540 --> 52:31.900
and I hope that I have,

52:33.180 --> 52:34.700
many of the district's findings,

52:34.700 --> 52:35.980
many of the county's findings,

52:35.980 --> 52:39.740
the CDE independently found had actually no merit to them.

52:39.740 --> 52:40.780
And without any merit,

52:40.780 --> 52:42.940
without being based on facts or law,

52:42.940 --> 52:46.780
those findings were not sufficient to deny the charter.

52:46.780 --> 52:47.980
So just some examples.

52:49.180 --> 52:51.580
These are findings that were not supported,

52:52.300 --> 52:56.220
that the charter school will provide inferior CTE,

52:56.220 --> 52:58.700
that online instruction is not high quality,

52:58.700 --> 53:01.740
that recruitment of teachers would be a barrier to success,

53:01.740 --> 53:04.700
that the school has not accounted for special ed services,

53:04.700 --> 53:06.700
needs to hire more than one special ed teacher,

53:07.660 --> 53:10.140
that there are four CTE programs in the district

53:10.140 --> 53:12.060
that are thriving and it's unlikely that...

53:12.380 --> 53:13.500
Thank you, your time is up.

53:14.380 --> 53:22.380
Thank you very much.

53:29.660 --> 53:31.900
President Darling-Hammond, I apologize, I think you're on mute.

53:34.060 --> 53:37.740
We are now going to hear from the Northern Humboldt Union High School

53:37.740 --> 53:41.180
and Humboldt County Office of Education for a combined 12 minutes.

53:42.060 --> 53:46.940
Hi, good morning, State Board of Education.

53:47.660 --> 53:48.860
My name is Jennifer Nix.

53:48.860 --> 53:52.060
I'm the attorney representing the Humboldt County Board of Education,

53:52.060 --> 53:54.460
as well as the Humboldt County Office of Education.

53:54.460 --> 53:58.140
I'm here today with the Humboldt County Superintendent of Schools,

53:58.140 --> 53:59.580
Michael Davis Hughes,

53:59.580 --> 54:02.620
on behalf of both the Northern Humboldt Union High School District

54:02.620 --> 54:04.780
and the Humboldt County Board of Education

54:04.780 --> 54:08.620
to ask you to affirm the denials of this charter petition.

54:12.060 --> 54:15.420
The SBA petitioners were denied a charter school

54:15.420 --> 54:18.540
because two different local boards found that the program

54:18.540 --> 54:22.380
the petition seeks to provide will be a detriment to children,

54:22.380 --> 54:24.060
is financially unviable,

54:24.060 --> 54:28.700
and will funnel a significant amount of public funds to a private company.

54:29.820 --> 54:31.900
The Northern Humboldt High School District

54:31.900 --> 54:33.980
and the Humboldt County Board of Education

54:33.980 --> 54:36.460
did not make this decision quickly or lightly.

54:36.460 --> 54:40.540
Instead, they had staff conduct thorough reviews of the petition,

54:40.540 --> 54:42.300
including meeting with the petitioners

54:42.300 --> 54:44.540
and researching all of the claims in the petition.

54:45.260 --> 54:49.180
Both boards held two separate public hearings

54:49.180 --> 54:53.180
with extensive public input at each meeting prior to making their decisions.

54:53.900 --> 54:59.020
SBA wants to make this appeal about alleged minor issues in the process.

54:59.020 --> 55:03.500
However, minor procedural hiccups in a charter school process

55:03.500 --> 55:06.140
cannot override the fact that this school

55:06.140 --> 55:08.940
would be harmful to the students of Humboldt County,

55:08.940 --> 55:13.100
even if the petitioners found a way to make it financially viable.

55:15.340 --> 55:19.900
Of course, you all know that AB 1505 changed the standard for appeals

55:19.900 --> 55:21.500
and how you review appeals.

55:22.220 --> 55:25.340
That change of standard was designed to emphasize

55:25.340 --> 55:29.820
local control over decision-making with regard to charter school petitions

55:29.820 --> 55:32.860
and to put in place a system where those local decisions

55:32.860 --> 55:35.900
were not overturned unless the local school district

55:35.980 --> 55:39.980
and the county board were both derelict in their duties under the law.

55:40.700 --> 55:46.220
CDE has recommended that you define abuse of discretion as arbitrary, capricious,

55:46.220 --> 55:50.780
entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

55:51.340 --> 55:53.820
We, the LEAs, agree with that definition

55:54.700 --> 55:57.420
because it is the definition that courts have been applying

55:57.420 --> 56:01.900
to review school district decisions with regard to charter schools for many years now.

56:02.620 --> 56:07.500
However, regardless of the definition that you choose for abuse of discretion,

56:07.500 --> 56:12.540
SBA did not and cannot show that there was an abuse of discretion

56:12.540 --> 56:16.140
here by either LEA, much less both of them.

56:16.140 --> 56:20.220
The record is clear that both LEAs acted in a reasonable manner.

56:20.220 --> 56:23.740
Both LEAs supported their decisions with lengthy factual findings

56:23.740 --> 56:27.020
citing to the record and any procedural concerns

56:27.740 --> 56:32.860
either are not grounded in what's required in the law or did not cause harm to the petitioners.

56:34.300 --> 56:38.940
Northern Humboldt based their decision to deny SBA's charter on two findings.

56:38.940 --> 56:42.780
First, that the charter school presented an unsound educational program

56:42.780 --> 56:45.260
for the students enrolled in the charter school.

56:45.260 --> 56:48.220
And second, that the petitioners were demonstrably unlikely

56:48.220 --> 56:51.420
to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.

56:52.060 --> 56:55.580
They supported that decision with 12 pages of findings.

56:55.660 --> 56:59.340
Notable in those findings are that the CTE program

56:59.340 --> 57:01.900
that the petition describes would be understaffed

57:01.900 --> 57:05.180
and would rely too heavily on an online curriculum.

57:05.900 --> 57:10.300
Additionally, the budget was not accurate and relied on incorrect assumptions,

57:10.940 --> 57:14.860
including the fact that it did not reflect an understanding

57:14.860 --> 57:18.380
of the programming or costs related to students with disabilities.

57:18.380 --> 57:22.460
You're going to hear that that was a significant concern from the school board,

57:22.460 --> 57:25.580
in part because Humboldt County has one of the highest

57:25.580 --> 57:28.460
percentages of students with disabilities in the state.

57:29.580 --> 57:34.620
The Humboldt County Board of Education based their decision to deny SBA's charter

57:34.620 --> 57:35.660
on three findings.

57:36.380 --> 57:40.140
First, that the charter school presented an unsound educational program,

57:40.140 --> 57:44.460
that the petitioners were demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program,

57:44.460 --> 57:48.380
and additionally, that the petition did not contain the number of required signatures.

57:49.020 --> 57:54.460
Now, similarly to the district, the county board had concerns with regard to the CTE program,

57:55.260 --> 57:59.580
with regard to the petitioner's ability to implement an integrated CTE program,

57:59.580 --> 58:03.100
and with regard to the staffing, which was unrealistic in concept,

58:03.100 --> 58:06.060
because it relied on a number of part-time teachers,

58:06.060 --> 58:10.220
and in reality, because of a countywide CTE teacher shortage.

58:10.940 --> 58:15.420
Additionally, the county board was concerned that the budget was inaccurate

58:15.420 --> 58:17.740
and relied on incorrect assumptions.

58:18.380 --> 58:26.220
Similar concerns were raised by the county board with regard to the petition's information

58:26.220 --> 58:28.380
regarding supports for students with disabilities,

58:28.380 --> 58:30.620
students with social-emotional deficits,

58:30.620 --> 58:33.500
and the budget to provide supports to those individuals.

58:34.380 --> 58:37.580
The county board also raised two additional concerns.

58:37.580 --> 58:43.100
First is that the petition identified a location or a facility that SBA intended to lease,

58:43.100 --> 58:48.620
that cannot be contracted with without running afoul of government code section 1090,

58:48.620 --> 58:55.740
due to significant conflicts of interest with the building's owner and the Samoa Beach Academy.

58:55.740 --> 59:00.780
The proposed lease, moreover, reflects a gross misuse of public funds,

59:00.780 --> 59:05.500
as it would funnel almost $2.7 million to a private company

59:05.500 --> 59:08.380
within the first five years of SBA's existence.

59:09.100 --> 59:16.940
That lease reflects a space that has a cost far in excess of the facilities

59:16.940 --> 59:19.900
of any other charter school within Humboldt County.

59:19.900 --> 59:24.860
The square foot cost in year five would be almost $35 per square foot,

59:24.860 --> 59:29.340
whereas the maximum cost any other charter school in Humboldt County

59:29.340 --> 59:34.620
is paying for a leased facility is $1.10 per square foot,

59:34.620 --> 59:37.020
almost 35 times the rent.

59:37.980 --> 59:43.180
Additionally, the county board found that the petition did not contain the required signatures.

59:44.220 --> 59:50.220
The petition was required to have four signatures from four meaningfully interested teachers.

59:50.780 --> 59:55.820
The county office of education contacted the four individuals who were listed,

59:55.820 --> 59:56.700
well, three of them.

59:56.700 --> 59:58.220
One of them did not have a phone number.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.940
Only one of them was actually interested in teaching at SBA,

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.060
and that individual does not hold a California teaching credential.

01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.300
One individual indicated he had been interested in teaching at SBA,

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.140
but was no longer interested.

01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:17.100
One individual indicated that he was never interested in teaching at SBA

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.500
and that he had misunderstood what his signature meant.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.660
To be clear, when the county board found that the petition

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.060
did not contain the required signatures,

01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.500
they were looking at the signatures on the face of the petition,

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:33.340
not at any additional requirement.

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:38.380
County office staff did acknowledge the passage of time as permitted by the education code

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:42.060
and permit petitioners to provide additional signatures,

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.740
but they chose not to do so.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.780
The LEAs both issued extensive factual findings

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:52.540
that cannot be said to be entirely lacking in evidentiary support.

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:57.580
They also can't be said to not reflect substantial evidence supporting their decision.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.140
So turning to the procedural violations that are alleged,

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:07.420
SBA can't point to any procedural error that actually rises to an abuse of discretion,

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:11.500
because minor procedural errors do not rise to an abuse of discretion.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.940
The LEAs are requesting that the SBA affirm the denial of the charter petition

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:21.740
unless there are significant issues regarding the review and appeal process at the local level.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:27.980
To adopt SBA's argument that any procedural error would require the SBA

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:32.540
to grant the charter petition would result in petitions that are

01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:36.140
substantively deficient like this one being granted.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:43.420
This likely would cause SBA to grant more appeals than before AB 1505 was enacted,

01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:46.780
which is clearly contradictory to the legislative intent.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:51.100
So I want to talk about the alleged procedural violations.

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:55.180
The procedure in the code requires equal time and procedures,

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:57.260
and that was given to the petitioners.

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.740
The school district, Northern Humboldt Union High School District,

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.500
did produce a transcript on appeal.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:11.260
Second, there's concerns raised that the response to the staff findings was not properly provided

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:16.700
to the board, but SBA actually provided that response directly to the school board members

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.500
via email.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:22.780
Finally, there are concerns raised with regard to equal time.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.260
However, as you heard Miss Rowley admit,

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:30.380
the SBA petitioners were offered as much time as they wanted to present.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.260
They requested 10 minutes, they took 11 minutes,

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:37.740
and they never requested more time even when the school district took additional time.

01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:43.740
Importantly, none of these allegations of procedural unfairness against the district

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.140
are tied to any alleged harm.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:51.180
They simply present these allegations and ask for the deficient charter petition to be granted

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.260
because of these procedural concerns that did not cause any harm.

01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.460
With regard to the County Board of Education,

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.180
Miss Rowley is correct that the county board did not record the board meeting

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.500
at which the SBA petition was denied.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.580
However, that requirement is not in the code.

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:12.700
Education Code Section 47605 Subdivision B

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.420
provides the procedural requirements that the school district and the county have to follow

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.660
with regard to charter school petitions and reviewing those petitions.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:26.940
That code section does not require that the meetings be recorded.

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.700
Now, if you look down further in the code,

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.980
when you get to the section with regard to appeal to the SBE,

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:39.420
it does note that there should be a transcript provided with the documentary record.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:44.780
But in every other code section in which a public meeting is required to be recorded,

01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:48.300
the code explicitly states that it has to be recorded.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.820
So here we have a code section that is unclear at best.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:59.100
Regardless, SBA does not allege any harm that occurred because the meeting was not recorded.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.700
The harm that we would be looking for in this situation

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.660
would be that you, the SBE, are not able to review something that happened at the meeting

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:10.380
that was erroneous or that was unlawful.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.460
However, there's been no allegation that the County Board of Education did

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:17.500
anything that was erroneous or unlawful in that meeting,

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.460
just that they failed to actually record it.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:27.260
Accordingly, we the LEAs are requesting that you find that neither LEA abused their discretion

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:32.700
and that you affirm the decision to deny this charter petition.

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.500
And I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Davies-Hughes to conclude.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:41.100
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, members of the Board.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.380
My name is Michael Davies-Hughes.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.020
I'm the Superintendent of Schools for Humboldt County.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.940
We want to conclude by stating that Humboldt County is home

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:53.500
to many successful charter schools and thriving CTE programs.

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.540
Indeed, both the Northern Humboldt High School District

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:00.780
and the Humboldt County Office of Education are authorizers of charter schools.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.300
And we recognize the positive ways in which they support

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.460
the diverse needs of students we serve.

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.860
However, the Samoa Beach Academy charter petition

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:15.740
falls short of the standards we expect for charter schools in Humboldt County.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.780
And therefore, we cannot support its establishment.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:21.420
We thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.580
And I ask that you take action to adopt the recommendations of CTE

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.820
and affirm the denials of both the District and the County Board of Education.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:37.580
Thank you very much.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.500
At this point, I think we want to open the phone line for public comment.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.620
Is the public comment slide up?

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.020
Great. I see it.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:52.700
Public comment. There we go.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.220
Public comment is limited to one minute.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.700
It's for people who are not part of either presentation.

01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:02.700
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.260
may do so by calling the telephone number

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.700
and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:15.420
As we listen for public comment, we encourage you to please state your name

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.500
and affiliation for the record.

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.260
Please remember to turn down the speaker volume of your computer

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.020
if you are following the live feed.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.900
Speakers will be limited to a minute each.

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.660
Are there any public comments?

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.700
Yes, we have a number of callers in the queue.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:32.060
I will open the phone line now.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.420
Thank you.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:35.020
Good morning.

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.020
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:37.820
You have one minute.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.860
Your time starts now.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:47.180
Hi, I'm Dr. Fred Van Vleck and I'm in my 11th years as Superintendent of Eureka City Schools.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.380
Eureka City Schools is a proud sponsor of other independent charter schools

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:52.140
and we are not anti-charter.

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.700
I'm a former Career and Tactical Education teacher myself

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.020
and I understand quality CTE programs.

01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:01.420
I am a graduate of the NHUHSD and a native to the North Coast.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.180
I'm a state certified business official

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:05.580
and a former Assistant Superintendent of Business Services

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.540
where I successfully led a district through the Great Recession.

01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.420
My concern is the fiscal solvency of the SBA charter.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.300
The worst thing that can happen for students is if they open,

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:17.900
start educating students and they close leaving students deeply impacted.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.460
This charter is not set up for fiscal success.

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:24.380
Bottom line, Eureka High School has over half of its 1,200 student population

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.940
enrolled in a high quality CTE program

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.220
taught by highly qualified and credentialed CTE teachers

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:33.980
including a brand new over $7 million CTE facility.

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:35.900
While the SBA charter is a fine concept,

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.300
the reality of the fiscal solvency is a dream.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:41.660
Please support the recommendation of the CTE staff to affirm

01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:45.020
the local decision of the district and county boards of education

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.620
who know our community needs best.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:47.980
Thank you.

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:51.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:52.140
You have one minute.

01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:53.180
Your time starts now.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.460
Hi, my name is Ericka Goldsbury.

01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:01.900
I am clerk to the board of the Northern Humboldt Union High School District.

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.260
I'm proud to be here with our history of authorizing three charter schools

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.660
and our devotion to career technical education.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:13.100
And I believe when I voted and still believe that it is in the best interest

01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.380
of students and families in our region to deny the approval of SBA.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.460
As a board member, and I'm aware this is true of my colleagues as well,

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:23.260
I reviewed hundreds of pages of documents including the petition,

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.020
the district staff's recommended findings,

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.980
and SBA's response to the district initial findings

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.220
SBA emailed directly to us.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.980
We listened carefully to SBA's presentation.

01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.060
First of its initial withdrawn petition and then its second similar petition,

01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:41.340
which is before you now, when we voted to deny.

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:46.620
And while the concept of SBA may be laudable aspirationally,

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.900
my deeper review of the budget and petition revealed too many concerning gaps

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.980
in experience and preparation for us to responsibly allow it to move forward.

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.860
Thank you.

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:55.340
Thank you.

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:58.540
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:08:59.260
You have one minute.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.300
Your time starts now.

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:04.220
Okay.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.180
Thank you very much.

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.780
This is former Governor Jerry Brown.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:14.060
My essential point here is the great difficulty that 1505 has now created.

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:19.580
Your role in reviewing the very important arguments that both sides can make

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:24.780
is now foreclosed and limited by this very legalistic term abuse of discretion.

01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:30.540
The result, I'm afraid, is the continuing denial of all new charters

01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:34.620
and massive rejection of charter renewals statewide.

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:37.580
So I would ask you, as you make this determination,

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:41.260
to make very clear the inadequacy of this standard review.

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:43.820
You ought to look at the merits, hear both sides,

01:09:43.820 --> 01:09:46.060
and be able to make a substantive decision,

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.660
not engage in these very legalistic back and forth.

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.380
Charter schools play an important role as do our public school system.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.020
I think we have an unfortunate law, and the legislature ought to be modifying it

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:03.020
so we can be fair to the public schools and the charter schools

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.300
that so many enthusiastic citizens want to create.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.340
That's my point.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.780
It's a very tough situation that you've now put in

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:14.060
because the law does not allow you to make a full review.

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.820
You're limited to finding basically legal nitpicking

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.540
with the law following exactly or not.

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:22.860
That's not the way to run a railroad,

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:27.820
and I hope this board will fully probe into what is the situation on review.

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:34.140
That very American fundamental right that no decision at a local level

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:36.300
can never be reviewed at a higher level.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:39.820
That's a very un-American approach, but there it is,

01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:41.980
and only the legislature can change it.

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.900
But this school board can illuminate the issues at stake

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:49.740
and can be vigilant in protecting our public schools

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:52.940
and the very creative charter schools that the law makes available,

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.540
or at least used to make available.

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:55.580
Thank you very much.

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:56.860
Thank you very much, Governor Brown.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:00.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.340
You have one minute.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.380
Your time starts now.

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:06.700
This is Leif Gill.

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:10.220
I am the chapter consultant of the Northern Humboldt High School Teachers Association

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:11.820
and the Eureka Teachers Association.

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:16.700
I support the CDE staff recommendation to affirm the Northern Humboldt School Board

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:21.100
and Humboldt County Board of Ed denials of the charter petition for the Samoa Beach Academy.

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:25.500
Both the district and the county had strong reasons to deny that were well founded.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:28.300
Humboldt County is in long-term declining enrollment.

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.980
The elementary school in Samoa uses only a fraction of its classrooms.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.540
Eureka City Schools has closed several elementary sites

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:38.780
and has lost about 40% of its enrollment over the last few decades.

01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:41.900
Most secondary schools in the county have shrunk over the past 20 years.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.900
There is no demand for new schools.

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:46.940
Samoa Beach Academy's budget for staffing is insufficient

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:50.540
to attract and retain qualified teachers from existing schools to switch.

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:53.500
It is also insufficient to compete with private industry for people with the

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.780
necessary background and qualifications as CTE teachers.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.540
The existing high schools in the area, Eureka High and Arcata High,

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.020
have invested millions of dollars in facilities

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:06.220
and offer locally competitive wages and benefits packages.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.860
Even so, Eureka High School is losing CTE teachers.

01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:09.980
Thank you, Collie. Your time is up.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.140
Thank you, caller.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.260
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.860
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.900
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed board members.

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:27.180
My name is Tina Plait from the California Charter Schools Association.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:31.180
We appreciate the care that the department put into coming up with

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:35.260
a definition for abuse of discretion using existing statutes.

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.340
However, we're very concerned that the department clearly acknowledged

01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:43.980
that the district and county violated the law, as you heard in the presentation,

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.620
but then also stated that the actions of the district and county were not unlawful.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:55.580
We cannot undermine some of the core tenets of AB 1505 in ensuring a fair process for charter

01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.220
approval by allowing a violation of law around process to be accessible.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:07.020
Any violation by a district or county of process set forth in statute is unlawful

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.180
and a clear abuse of discretion.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.580
Therefore, we respectfully request that you overturn the local decisions.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.460
Thank you.

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.420
Thank you.

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.820
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.420
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.140
My name is Tom McMahon.

01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.380
I'm the president of the Humboldt County School Board,

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:30.940
and I'm a retired educator with 27 years of experience at all of it in Humboldt County.

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:36.060
My decision to deny the appeal by Samoa Bay Academy was based on my thorough review

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:41.180
of the documents submitted, my consideration of substantial public input, and the presentations

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:43.980
offered by both parties during the public hearings.

01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:49.660
I'm an avid supporter of quality career technical education for the students and our community,

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:53.820
but I could not support the model and plan presented by Samoa Beach Academy.

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:59.020
Concerns were the model didn't present a sound education program for all students,

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:04.380
especially those with special needs and the underprivileged program was highly unlikely

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:09.180
to be successfully implemented due to unrealistic enrollment projections and accompanying budget

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:14.460
projections and the lack of ability of specialized credentialed teachers to fill the anticipated need

01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:15.820
for full staffing.

01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:19.020
Thank you for your time and careful consideration of this matter.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:19.420
Thank you.

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:22.460
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.100
You have one minute.

01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:23.980
Your time starts now.

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:27.820
Good morning.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.180
My name is Siva Kordamanj.

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:33.100
I'm a fifth generation resident and business owner of Humboldt County.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.060
I support the Samoa Beach Academy for many reasons.

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:40.380
First, with Cal Poly set to add 10,000 students in the following years,

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.460
Humboldt does need more schools.

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:46.860
With the additions of students, professors, and families, who is going to build the housing

01:14:46.860 --> 01:14:48.460
and work in our hospitals?

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:54.140
SBA will ensure their education directly ties into career readiness preparation.

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:58.780
Second, as a business owner who works directly with these businesses in the trade,

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.820
I know the businesses end up teaching everything on the job or hiring workers from out of the

01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.180
area who have experience.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:10.460
Workers with skill, confidence, and mindfulness in these trades are safer.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:17.500
Third, this charter proposal represents a unique public-private partnership and we need more

01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.340
innovation like this in Humboldt County.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:23.820
I hope the state sees that because if you don't, we are failing our community and kids.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:28.060
Lastly, I have full confidence in the board, every single person on the board,

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:32.700
and behind the scenes brings experience, confidence, and a work ethic to accomplish

01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.980
the untouchability of our kids.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:36.780
Thank you, caller.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:40.860
You have one minute.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:41.820
Your time starts now.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:49.180
Hi, my name is Teresa Grosjean and I am the president of the Northern Humboldt Union High

01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:51.260
School District Board of Trustees.

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:55.020
I sent public comment to the State Board of Education on July 7th.

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:59.340
In that letter, I detailed dates of hearings and receipts of documents that I received

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.140
in preparation of voting on SBA's charter petition.

01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:08.620
I also detailed the many factors that I considered and the rationale I used in voting to deny.

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:13.100
Today, I want to reiterate that SBA had ample time to present information to our board.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.900
They received the amount of time they asked for that I had thoroughly on multiple occasions

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:22.940
read all the materials they provided to us, including their petition and response to our

01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.300
district findings.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.300
I listened to all public comment, made for and against approval, and carefully considered

01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:29.020
their petition.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:34.060
In the end, based on nearly nine years of serving as a board member in my community,

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:38.060
and what I know to be true about the needs of the students in our district, I was convinced

01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.780
by the evidence that SBA had not created a sound educational program and would be unable

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:46.540
to adequately serve the students of Humboldt County and that it was demonstrable.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:47.260
Thank you, caller.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.100
Thank you.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:50.300
Thank you very much.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:52.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:53.340
You have one minute.

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.300
Your time starts now.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.660
Go ahead, caller.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.220
You are live.

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:06.620
I'm sorry.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:07.740
We can barely hear you.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.620
Would you mind calling back in?

01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:12.700
Thank you very much.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.500
Can you hear me well?

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.220
We can hear you now.

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:15.820
Yeah.

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.580
I'm a long-term resident of Humboldt County and I support the Snow Beach Academy.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:25.580
The main reason I'm supporting it today is we were constantly asking our citizens and

01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:30.220
our local communities to step up and take a bigger role and responsibility and not only

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:34.540
in our school systems but in our local government and how we conduct ourselves.

01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:40.060
This is a perfect example of citizens and people stepping up putting in not only a lot

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:45.020
of money and effort and blood and sweat and tears into creating a better education system

01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:45.740
for our children.

01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:49.020
That is the main reason why I'm supporting Snow Beach Academy.

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.860
Thank you.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.260
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:53.980
You have one minute.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:54.940
Your time starts now.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.700
Good morning, board members.

01:17:58.700 --> 01:17:59.740
My name is Cindy Vickers.

01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:02.860
I'm the Director of Fiscal Services for Northern Humboldt Union High School District

01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.100
and have been in that role for the past 11 years.

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.380
I reviewed the budget portion of the Samoa Beach Charter petition

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.220
as a member of the district's review team.

01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.740
I had significant concerns about the fiscal sustainability of SBA.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:16.620
The startup funding source cited is Charter Asset Management.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.860
This company advances funds to the school with payback coming from future state aid.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:22.700
State aid is driven by enrollment and ADA.

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.700
The enrollment projections were unrealistic which would jeopardize the ability of the SBA

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.900
to pay back the funding.

01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:32.060
The petition states they will provide food service but does not budget for food service staffing.

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:36.140
There is no transportation budgeted, further reducing ADA potential and not accounting

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.340
for legally mandated transportation for special ed students.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:43.180
There is no budget for special ed paraprofessionals although the petition says they will employ

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.220
paraprofessionals.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:49.020
The budgeted cash balance at the end of year one is approximately $16,000 given the omission

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:53.420
of costs associated with food service, transportation and special ed coupled with the unrealistic

01:18:53.420 --> 01:18:54.540
enrollment projection.

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.380
$16,000 is inadequate to sustain SBA beyond even year one.

01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.180
Thank you.

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:00.300
Thank you very much.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:02.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:19:02.700 --> 01:19:03.340
You have one minute.

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.300
Your time starts now.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.500
Good morning.

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:12.380
My name is Colby Smart and I am the Assistant Superintendent of Educational Services at

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.340
HDOE.

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:17.340
I would like to comment on the process that we went through in reviewing SBA's petition.

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.420
First, we conducted a de novo review.

01:19:19.420 --> 01:19:23.900
There were 17 members of the HDOE staff who carefully reviewed the petition from their

01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:30.380
own particular domain of expertise including curriculum and instruction, CTE, special education,

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.980
MTSS, fiscal, facilities and charter oversight.

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:37.580
The findings of the Humboldt County Office of Education are based on an exhaustive review

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:40.620
by staff who have decades of experience in education.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:44.540
HDOE has a tradition of supporting CTE and charter schools.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:49.020
HDOE staff's findings reflect deep structural deficiencies in the petition.

01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:54.220
We were tasked with reviewing the petition itself and although there is merit in SBA's

01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:59.020
concept and vision, our findings expose significant and concerning flaws.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:19:59.820
Thank you.

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:00.700
Thank you.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:04.620
Your time starts now.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.340
You have one minute.

01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.220
My name is Dama Ramour, Council for Northern Humboldt Union High School District.

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:18.700
I would like to respond to the following claims by SBA of alleged procedural errors by the

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:19.340
district.

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.820
Two are complete misrepresentations.

01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:26.860
Regarding the alleged lack of a transcript, prior to providing SBA with a video transcript,

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:31.740
the district verified with Sandy Ridge at CDE that a video transcript was sufficient.

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:36.940
This email exchange has in the record see page 487 and the SBA has it.

01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:41.420
Secondly, regarding the alleged failure to provide SBA's response to the district's

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:43.980
findings, that's not even an illegal requirement.

01:20:43.980 --> 01:20:47.980
Furthermore, SBA emailed its response to board members as you've heard today.

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:52.940
About the alleged lack of equitable time, the difference in time is de minimis and SBA

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:55.100
has identified no harm caused.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:59.420
SBA presented to the board three times by the end of the final meeting.

01:20:59.420 --> 01:21:03.820
Any minor procedural deviations in time was more than made up for by the two public hearings

01:21:03.820 --> 01:21:08.780
prior to the final meeting plus the 25 minutes of public comment in favor of SBA at the final

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.420
meeting.

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.740
Thank you, honorable members of the board.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:12.540
Thank you.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:14.940
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.500
You have one minute.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.460
Your time starts now.

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.180
Good morning, Madam President and members.

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:25.180
My name is Chris Myers and on behalf of the California School Employees Association,

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:29.020
we are urging the board to affirm the decisions of the Northern Humboldt Union High School

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:33.260
District and the Humboldt County Board of Education to deny this Namoa Beach Academy

01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:34.380
Charter Petition.

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:39.900
CSCA agrees with the CDE staff recommendation which concluded that neither LEA abused its

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.900
discretion in denying the petition.

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:46.380
It's abundantly clear based on the records before you that both LEAs made well-reasoned

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:51.900
decisions to deny the petition after fairly evaluating the petition, consulting qualified

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:55.340
experts, comparing relevant data, and calling upon their own expertise.

01:21:55.900 --> 01:22:00.780
Even in the event of a minor procedural error, it should not then follow that the LEA's decision

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.940
be reversed and the petition granted.

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:06.620
The LEA's acted within the letter of the law and completed their due diligence in

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.540
fairly evaluating the petition.

01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:12.140
Therefore, we urge you to affirm the LEA's decision to deny the Charter Petition.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:12.640
Thank you.

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:14.780
Thank you.

01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:17.180
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:17.820
You have one minute.

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.780
Your time starts now.

01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:28.140
Hi, my name is Rob Flint and I've lived in Arcata since 1984.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:32.300
I've been in the trade since 1987 when I took my gap year from college.

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:36.060
I support the Samoa Beach Academy because it's the type of education that would have

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.260
benefited me.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:41.820
I think the public schools here are good, but I don't think that they're good for everybody.

01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:45.980
There's enough people who would benefit from a trades-based education.

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:48.060
It would be a great symbiotic relationship.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:54.300
The trades could use an influx of youth with a baseline of knowledge.

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:01.660
I think the students would benefit from having a relevant education for them where they see

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:04.060
the end game and they see the benefit of what they're learning.

01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:09.500
I also think that choice is a positive thing and competition is a positive thing too.

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:14.700
The local high school district would benefit from the competition as well.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:15.980
It makes everybody better.

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.860
Thank you.

01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:17.660
Thank you.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:20.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:20.860
You have one minute.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.820
Your time starts now.

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:30.380
Hello, my name is Steve Brodhag and I run the Danco cabinet shop.

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:37.100
I'm calling to support the Samoa Beach Academy as someone that hires the employees that these

01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.380
schools put out.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:43.180
Calling their education anything but mediocre is a gross overstatement.

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.820
My best employees were so disgruntled with school that they dropped out.

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.860
A school like this can reach children and make them want to go to school.

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:57.420
If I had this, I would have been so much better off than I am now.

01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:02.460
These are high paying jobs that these children can get right out of high school without going

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:05.740
to college, without student debt.

01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.740
It will only help the underprivileged people of our community.

01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.940
And I feel so strongly about this.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:18.220
When this school is approved, I plan on getting my teacher's credential and teaching there.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.260
Thank you very much.

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.300
Thank you very much.

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.740
You have one minute.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.780
Your time starts now.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.140
Hello.

01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:34.460
My name is Sheila Rocker Heppe and I serve on the Humboldt County Board of Education as

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.700
trustee representing area three.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:40.220
My professional background includes a decade of teaching eighth grade before serving as

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:43.980
the coordinator of the secondary teacher credential program and what is now Cal Poly

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:48.140
Humboldt, where I was a member of the School of Education teaching faculty for 14 years.

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:53.260
My children attended four schools in Humboldt County for their elementary education and two

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:55.180
of those schools were charter schools.

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:58.220
I reviewed the SBA proposal very carefully.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.860
I concur with the findings from the Northern Humboldt School District and the County Office

01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:04.300
of Education staff.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:09.100
A particular concern is the quality and feasibility of the educational program and the lack of

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.780
professionally qualified teachers interested in working at the charter school.

01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:17.100
Two years ago, I facilitated a countywide teacher shortage task force, which brought

01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:21.740
together leaders from districts, the university, local tribal education leaders, and the County

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:24.700
Office of Education to seek solutions for our area.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:30.380
The SBA proposal fails to address or maybe fully understand important staffing and credentialing

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.980
concerns facing our region.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.460
Additionally, I was significantly concerned.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:35.020
Thank you, Colleen.

01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:35.740
Your time is up.

01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:38.860
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:39.580
You have one minute.

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.540
Your time starts now.

01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:44.300
Good morning.

01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:45.420
My name is Tonya Trump.

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:49.740
I am the program manager for Career and College Resources employed by Humboldt County Office

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.780
of Education.

01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:54.300
I consulted with Northern Humboldt Union High School District when they received a charter

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.820
petition from SBA claiming SBA would provide a CTE medical pathway program.

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:04.540
As I shared with council for the district, HCOE has been attempting to hire a qualified

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:08.700
health science and medical technology sector CTE teacher since May of 2021.

01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:14.700
In June 2021, the position was posted in newspapers and other media such as adjoin and social

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.340
media.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.860
This reached over 1,500 people with 49 engagements.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.900
In September 2021, HCOE posted the position again and paid to boost it on social media.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:29.020
Despite reaching nearly 1,900 people by October, we received only one applicant.

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.100
This applicant pulled their application after hearing the salary ranges in this area.

01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.020
I am aware of two other large districts in this county who have been unable to recruit

01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.820
CTE credentialed candidates for this pathway.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.940
Thank you for your time.

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.340
Thank you.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:44.220
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:44.940
You have one minute.

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.900
Your time starts now.

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:49.500
Hello.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:51.980
It's Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Development Center.

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:56.380
I think the one thing that everybody agrees on today is that we don't have a definition

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.700
of the key term of use of discretion.

01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:05.180
Under any definition of that term, however, the underlying statutes matter.

01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:10.380
And in this case, the underlying statutes require the school districts to make specific

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.060
factual findings pertinent to the school in question.

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:16.060
And in this case, they failed to do that.

01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:21.340
We also question the findings of the CDE on procedural matters.

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:23.420
We don't think they passed the Google test.

01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:27.260
For these and other reasons, we would urge you to reverse the district's denial

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.820
and allow this school to move forward.

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:30.540
Thank you.

01:27:30.540 --> 01:27:30.940
Thank you.

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.980
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:34.700
You have one minute.

01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:35.740
Your time starts now.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.100
Caller, and hello.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:45.740
Okay.

01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:46.060
Thank you.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.260
Good morning, state board members.

01:27:47.260 --> 01:27:50.940
My name is Patty Campbell, and I'm the chair of the Samoa Beach Academy Board.

01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:55.180
I'm a sixth generation Humboldt County native, a local business owner,

01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:57.580
and a parent of three local high school graduates.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.780
We are seeking to offer a research-based career technical education school,

01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.900
which will directly prepare our students to go to work in the trades.

01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:11.580
This aspect is extremely important to me as my family owns a lumber mill in Humboldt County,

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:16.380
and we've experienced firsthand the dwindling pool of qualified applicants for jobs.

01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:21.820
With a public-private partnership opportunity in the trades like SBA will offer,

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:25.500
I know that local businesses like mine will immediately employ those graduates.

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.500
We have been on a very long road to seek approval of this charter,

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.660
which is proof of the commitment of this team.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:37.500
We persevered after denials by the district and county and now ask you to reverse those denials

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.060
because the district and county did not follow the law.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:44.860
Private citizens have to follow the law, and the same goes for government bodies.

01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:45.820
Thank you for your time.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:46.940
Thank you.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:50.860
You have one minute.

01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:51.820
Your time starts now.

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:03.100
Caller with the last four digits ending in 0866, you are live.

01:29:03.100 --> 01:29:04.540
Please start your public comment now.

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.700
Good morning, honorable board members.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:12.780
I'm Melanie Susavilla, a member of the district's petition review team.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:16.700
I was in charge of special education for the district for five years and have seven years of

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.740
training and experience in the development of multi-tiered systems of support, or MTSS.

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:26.780
I consulted with our SOFA director and our regional CTE specialist and personally spent

01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:31.900
more than 80 hours reviewing, investigating, and writing our findings based on the evidence.

01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:38.540
Two key concerns were, one, SBA understaffed special education did not adequately budget

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:44.700
related services such as a single paraprofessional or provide a continuum of placement options.

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:49.500
I cannot emphasize enough how concerned I am for any students with IEPs attending SBA.

01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:54.540
And two, the petition items related to MTSS are largely

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:58.300
summarized or copy and pasted text from the internet.

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:04.780
SBA has not outlined a development plan and does not have the experience to implement MTSS.

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.180
Thank you.

01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:06.700
Thank you.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.180
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:09.900
You have one minute.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:10.860
Your time starts now.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:20.860
Hello, my name is Larry Gonzalez and I've been a Humboldt County resident for over 12 years.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:26.860
I came up here to go to Humboldt State University, graduated college, and upon graduating,

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:30.060
I couldn't find work, decent jobs, so I joined the trades.

01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:34.700
Been there for eight years now and I wish I could have attended a high school such as

01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:39.980
Beach Academy is proposing because I could have started a career in the trades a lot sooner,

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:45.260
probably be a lot farther and advanced in my career now than I would have been if I had

01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:46.140
this opportunity.

01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:53.100
I just believe that Humboldt County is growing and to continue growing, we have to grow the youth

01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:57.020
and that's going to mean offering more career and technical education

01:30:57.660 --> 01:31:02.780
because not everyone that graduates from a Humboldt County high school is going to go to college.

01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:03.740
It's a reality.

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:04.620
We know it.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.380
If you look at the college rates now, you know, they're not, it's not like 90%,

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:12.700
not everyone's going to college, so I just feel that college is not for everyone

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:17.980
and giving an opportunity to get technical skills in high school is just priceless

01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:20.780
and I just really love that we have an opportunity to innovate

01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:23.340
and get Humboldt County to be more competitive.

01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:24.060
Thank you, caller.

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:25.900
Thank you, caller.

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:29.100
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:30.220
Your time starts now.

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:40.220
Oh, good morning, President Darling-Hammond and honorable members of the board.

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:42.700
I appreciate your service and thanks for having us here today.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:46.140
I'm Roger McDonald, the superintendent of the Northern Humboldt Union High School District.

01:31:46.140 --> 01:31:50.540
To address one issue raised in the appeal, Dave Law, the petitioner, did not request any specific

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:54.540
amount of time to present to our board on the day voted on the petition before you.

01:31:54.540 --> 01:31:55.660
I suggested 10 minutes.

01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:58.860
He agreed to it in an email, which is in evidence.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:01.660
He could have easily asked for more time, which we have readily granted.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:06.780
To dilute the charter petition, I created a district review team consisting of myself,

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:09.820
the district's fiscal director, the district's expert in special education,

01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:14.220
multi-tiered systems of support, and counsel for the district.

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:17.980
This team consulted with the SELPA director, with our regional expert in CTE,

01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.940
with the regional charter directors, and with other Humboldt County superintendents

01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:24.700
who run CTE programs and who have engaged in dual enrollment with the two colleges

01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:26.220
that were listed in the petition.

01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.140
We also consulted with the following department leads in HWE, business services,

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:32.060
college and current personnel services.

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:36.860
It was these individuals' expertise that informed our recommendations

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:38.540
to deny the charter petition.

01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:39.660
Thank you, caller.

01:32:39.660 --> 01:32:41.420
There was no abuse of discretion.

01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.060
Thank you.

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.180
Thank you very much.

01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.580
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:46.380
You have one minute.

01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.580
Your time starts now.

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:52.540
Good morning.

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.980
My name is Charles Barnhart.

01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:56.540
I've been a resident of Humboldt County for 55 years.

01:32:57.500 --> 01:32:59.500
I've been in the trades for 38 years.

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:05.500
I graduated from Eureka High School, and I wish I would have had an opportunity

01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.340
like the Smoa Beach Academy is presenting here.

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:15.660
The trades have provided a tremendous living for my family.

01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:17.820
We've pretty much wanted for nothing.

01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:21.980
My son struggled in high school, and I barely got him through.

01:33:22.620 --> 01:33:26.620
And then he went to a trade school in Arizona for audio engineering.

01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.420
Flourished top five in his class.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:32.140
He's a hands-on learner, which I know lots of kids are.

01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:36.140
He's now an audio engineer in Universal Studios.

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:40.060
This type of program is much needed in Humboldt County,

01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.540
and I support the Smoa Beach Academy.

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:43.820
Thank you for your time.

01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:44.940
Thank you very much.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.580
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:48.540
You have one minute.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.660
Your time starts now.

01:33:53.340 --> 01:33:57.820
My name is Mandy Hu, and I'm a staff attorney with California Teachers Association.

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.060
I'm responding to Smoa Beach Academy's definition of abusive discretion.

01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:05.660
Minor procedural errors that do not affect the outcome of the district or county's

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:09.420
otherwise well-founded decisions to deny the petition should not be considered

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:10.940
abusive discretion.

01:34:10.940 --> 01:34:14.380
To hold otherwise would be to flout the intention of AB 1505

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.940
that law significantly changed the role of the state board in the charter process

01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:22.060
to ensure that the state board could not approve charter petitions denied

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:25.020
by district and counties unless there were significant issues

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.540
regarding the review and appeal process at the local level.

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:32.780
As Governor Brown recognized, this law restricts the state board's scope of review.

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:37.100
Under the new standards, local decision is intact unless it's an abusive discretion,

01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:39.580
and minor procedural errors do not meet this high bar.

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:45.020
Under Smoa Beach's reading, if a petitioner submits a flagrantly unlawful charter petition,

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:47.980
for example, one that doesn't even describe a course of study,

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:51.180
but the district or county fails to give literally the same amount of time

01:34:51.180 --> 01:34:53.580
to the petitioner as others at the hearing,

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:57.660
the state board would have to authorize a flagrantly unlawful petition.

01:34:57.660 --> 01:34:58.300
Thank you, Coller.

01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:00.780
The third result will not be the way the law is read.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:01.260
Thank you.

01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:02.460
Thank you very much.

01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:05.420
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:06.140
You have one minute.

01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:07.180
Your time starts now.

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:11.260
Good morning.

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.340
This is Claire Crawford with In the Public Interest.

01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.180
Despite assertions in previous comments, many new charter schools

01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:20.620
have already been authorized with AB 1505 in place,

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:23.500
and the existence of the charter industry is not at stake today.

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.700
The petitioner's interpretation of the law is absurd.

01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.140
When taken to its logical conclusion, a minor procedural error by a district

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:33.260
would require the state board to authorize any charter school

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.980
despite being denied by two local elected bodies

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:38.380
and regardless of how serious the findings.

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:42.860
For instance, the scandalous A3 founders could petition a district and a county,

01:35:42.860 --> 01:35:46.460
and if the district staff spoke for one minute longer than the charter petitioners,

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:49.420
the SBE would be required to authorize the school.

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:51.900
This is clearly not the legislative intent.

01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:54.140
CDE found no abuse of discretion.

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.300
Two elected bodies made findings supported by facts to deny this petition,

01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.460
and the SBE should affirm their decision.

01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:00.860
Thank you.

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.580
Thank you very much.

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.900
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.460
You have one minute.

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.420
Your time starts now.

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:11.100
Good morning.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:15.820
My name is Caroline Neuhaus-Wesley from Sephora Education Associates,

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.300
and I urge the board to reverse the determination

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.420
made by the governing boards of the district and the county

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:23.740
because there is clearly an abuse of discretion.

01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.660
Anytime there is something that is procedurally unfair

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:31.500
or not proceeding with law, that is an unlawful act.

01:36:31.500 --> 01:36:33.980
Therefore, it is an abuse of discretion.

01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:38.140
You've heard a lot about staffing, food services, budget, and registrar,

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:40.380
and special ed.

01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.460
All of those things are included in the budget.

01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:48.300
I think there is a clear misunderstanding of the review of the charter petition

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:55.500
as food services can be found in line 4700, janitorial services 5502,

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.980
and registrar in 2400 of the budget.

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.100
Special education is a huge concern,

01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.860
and to say that the school is demonstrably unlikely is unfair,

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.780
and I urge you to not make a precedent-setting case

01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:11.260
which would cause a massive rejection of new charters.

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:12.140
Thank you.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:12.940
Thank you.

01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.580
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:16.140
You have one minute.

01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:17.020
Your time starts now.

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:23.100
Good morning, State Board of Education members.

01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:25.660
My name is Lorraine Richards, and I am a classroom teacher

01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.380
representing the California Teachers Association.

01:37:28.380 --> 01:37:34.940
A primary purpose of AB 1505 was to return control over charter school

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.980
authorizing to local school districts.

01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:44.540
CTA supports the CDA staff recommendation to deny the appeal of Samoa Beach Academy.

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.060
As highlighted in the CSEA CTA letter,

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:53.340
minor procedural errors do not rise to the level of abuse of discretion,

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.220
and both the district and the county had strong reasons

01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:59.340
to deny the petition that were well-founded.

01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:03.020
Abuse of discretion is a very high standard

01:38:03.020 --> 01:38:06.940
and meant to be extremely deferential to local decisions.

01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:10.540
We urge the State Board of Education to affirm the school districts

01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:15.420
and county's decision to deny the Samoa Beach Academy Charter School Petition.

01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:16.300
Thank you.

01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.100
Thank you.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:19.580
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:20.140
You have one minute.

01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:21.100
Your time starts now.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:32.620
Coller, with the last four digits, 3599, you are live.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.060
Please start your public comment now.

01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.340
I'm sorry.

01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.740
I think I'm on the wrong agenda item.

01:38:39.740 --> 01:38:40.140
Okay.

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:40.540
Thank you.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:44.860
Next, Coller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:45.500
You have one minute.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:46.460
Your time starts now.

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.900
This is Suzanne Kuya with the Charter Schools Development Center.

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.060
Thank you, members of the board, and thank you, Governor Brown.

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.500
CTE programs are needed, and per EDCO,

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.820
the establishment of charter schools should be encouraged.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:05.260
So I'm confused why the intro slides only summarize the reasoning for the denial

01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.860
and didn't give an equivalent summary of rebuttals.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:12.780
The balance of the evidence must meet the legal standard,

01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:16.780
unsound program, or demonstrably unlikely to succeed.

01:39:16.780 --> 01:39:18.140
These are high legal bars.

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.620
Most of the denial findings, however, are speculative, not demonstrative.

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:27.100
Long list of findings of this nature are typical, but it doesn't mean they'll materialize.

01:39:27.740 --> 01:39:32.540
Is there any specific substantive concern where the petitioners have been heard?

01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:38.300
The intro slides showed that only the district staff got to respond to questions,

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:41.500
not the petitioners, and that is not minor.

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.860
We see an obvious abuse of discretion,

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:50.380
and the SBE does have this discretion to determine what to do in this case,

01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:53.340
and we hope that they will give this school a chance to...

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:55.180
Thank you, Coller.

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:56.780
Thank you.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.220
That concludes public comment for item number 17.

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:03.820
All right.

01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:07.820
I want to thank all of the public commenters.

01:40:08.620 --> 01:40:13.420
This is a complicated determination, and we appreciate all of the input.

01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:18.940
I am now going to close the public hearing at 10.55 a.m.

01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:23.420
We'll begin board discussion, and I'd like to ask our liaisons,

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.500
Vice President Glover-Woods and Member Olken,

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:27.900
if they would like to make initial comments.

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:29.180
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.380
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:38.380
Just some initial comments before we begin to engage in our discussion.

01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:43.740
We did have opportunity to hear during this public hearing,

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.860
as well as through written documentation we received,

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.420
a lot of comments regarding the benefits of CTE programs,

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.900
and even the desire to see more of those offerings in the proposed area.

01:40:56.780 --> 01:41:00.380
But I respectfully say to all of us that we are not

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:05.420
charged with the review of the petition itself.

01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:10.860
What we are asked to do is to determine if there has been an abuse of discretion

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.060
on behalf of the district and county office,

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:18.540
and if so, decide accordingly from that point.

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.980
Just to again lift up the definition that we've been provided

01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.460
regarding an abuse of discretion,

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.980
one of many things would need to have occurred.

01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.300
So the definition we received was that an abuse of discretion

01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:39.900
would be that the actions of the district and county office

01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.300
were either arbitrary, capricious, lacking in evidentiary support,

01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:47.580
unlawful, or procedurally unfair.

01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:51.020
So again, we've got a lot of information.

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:55.180
This is a very important conversation and discussion to have,

01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:59.180
but I just encourage us to anchor ourselves

01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:01.900
with what we have been charged to do as a board,

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:05.580
which is to decide if there has been abuse of discretion

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:12.140
on behalf of the district and county office,

01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:15.580
which has resulted in a denial of the charter petition.

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:28.060
Thank you, Member Glever Woods for that start,

01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:31.260
and certainly thank you to everyone who presented today,

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.700
both formally and through public comment.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:45.100
This is a very meaty, complicated, and new thing for us to be deciding upon,

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:52.940
and so I appreciate the reminder of what the new rules are and what our role is.

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:58.620
I myself, as I was listening to the presentations and the public comment,

01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:03.980
spent most of the time trying to disentangle what felt like,

01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:18.780
which parts of what we were hearing were comments on the merits of the charter versus

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:23.980
comments on the process that has happened thus far,

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.100
because my understanding is we're looking at process,

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:39.020
rather than at the...we're not redesigning whether this charter school is...whether it

01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:42.060
has merit as a school or not. That's not our role today,

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:45.580
and so I spent most of the time trying to disentangle the comments myself,

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:52.700
so I look forward to hearing our deliberation as we take this on. Thank you.

01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:57.180
Thank you. We're now open for board discussion.

01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:02.540
If anyone has comments or questions that they would like to raise.

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.140
Yes, Vice President Glever Woods.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:23.420
I did have a clarifying question, and I'm not quite sure who should respond to it.

01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:32.140
As it relates to the public hearing and the difference in time, my question is,

01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:42.540
were the petitioners denied a request to present for more time after seeing that the district

01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:48.780
presented for longer than the time that had been requested by the petitioners,

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:56.860
because my understanding is the petitioners requested 10 minutes and presented for 11,

01:44:56.860 --> 01:45:01.420
then the district presented afterwards. Then seeing the difference in time,

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:07.980
did the petitioners ask for more time, and if they did, were they denied that request?

01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:13.180
Yes. Stephanie, are you available to answer that question?

01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:25.900
Yes, I am. So the petitioners, as we understand it, and at the district level we did watch the video,

01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:32.940
did not request more time. They were given, well, they were asked how much time they needed. They

01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:39.580
had said 10 minutes. That is illustrated in emails that are attached to the documentary record.

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:48.220
At the actual hearing, they gave 11 minutes. As you noted, Member Glever Woods, they were not

01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:59.340
asked to stop their presentation, nor did we see them request more time during the hearing.

01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:12.300
Any other questions or comments? Member Lewis?

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:21.500
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and thank you, Vice President Glever Woods, and for your

01:46:22.460 --> 01:46:29.980
guidance in directing us to really stay focused on what our charge is here today and not try to

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:41.260
comment on the merits of the actual petition. So I just want to just be clear about the response

01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:47.900
from the CDE response, the district, and the county's response to the allegations. I just

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:53.020
want to make sure that I heard things correctly and that I have it accurately. You've already

01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:57.900
asked the President, excuse me, Vice President Glever Woods already asked the question, clarifying

01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:04.380
question about the time. And the second allegation of the petitioners was that

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:13.340
they did not get the opportunity, the Board didn't have the opportunity to receive their

01:47:15.020 --> 01:47:21.820
written response to the county and the district's findings. And I just want to make sure that I

01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:33.580
heard correctly that the SBA actually directly emailed their responses to the Board, and that's

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:42.220
why their responses were not included with the Board agenda along with staff responses. Is that

01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:47.100
correct? I'm not sure who I'm asking that one of the CDE staff. I think Stephanie is the person

01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:55.900
we're asking at this moment if she can provide that answer. So there is no requirement in Ed

01:47:55.900 --> 01:48:03.740
Code for the district to post the petitioner's response to their findings. There is a requirement

01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:09.420
Ed Code that the district post their findings 15 days before the public hearing to decide

01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:17.180
on the petition. But there is no requirement that the district post the charter's responses.

01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:23.180
From what I understand, and we can certainly ask them directly, but from what I understand from

01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:32.540
the documentary record and from the district, I believe or the county attorney's response earlier

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:39.180
that the response from the charter petitioners was directly emailed to every Board member prior

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:45.580
to the hearing. So they did have the opportunity to review that response.

01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:58.220
That is what we just heard. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And also there was no, in the petitioner's

01:48:58.220 --> 01:49:06.060
allegation about they should not have been required to obtain new signatures. And I believe what I

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:13.980
heard was that wasn't a requirement. It was merely the Board and the county because they had contacted

01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:25.020
the teacher, the four teachers who were listed in the petition. And there was no continued interest

01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:32.620
with them going, being a part of the academy. And they were merely asking for more, but there

01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:41.740
wasn't a requirement made to submit more. That affected the judgment of the county or the

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:52.700
district. That wasn't a procedural violation. Just clarification. Just making sure I'm

01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:58.540
reading that correctly, if I'm asking it correctly. So I think that it was

01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:06.620
not clear in the documentary record. If you notice in our A-1, we did not find

01:50:08.060 --> 01:50:16.300
the sufficient findings within the documentary record. I believe the county did answer that

01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:22.700
question during their testimony today. And we can certainly go back to them if they would like to

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:34.060
answer that. But it seemed to be a real matter of best practice for the county in reaching out to

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:43.980
those teacher signature folks to find out if they were still interested, which is not prohibited

01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:53.740
by Ed Code, certainly. Member Lewis, is that responsive to your question?

01:50:54.300 --> 01:51:01.980
It is responsive. And I really want to stay focused on whether or not it was abuse of discretion

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:08.300
based on those categories that were described in the definition. So I believe it was answered

01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:16.140
sufficiently for my clarification. Thank you. I'm sorry, President Hammond. I would remind

01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:22.700
that the abuse of discretion standard really applies to the decision to deny and not the

01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:32.300
individual procedural errors that have been discussed here today. Your decision

01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:37.900
to find an abuse of discretion must be on the totality of the decision to deny.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:44.940
Thank you. Okay. Member Patio-Bronson and then Member Olken.

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:54.380
So I want to start by thanking Vice President Glover-Wood for the framing and the reminder of

01:51:54.380 --> 01:52:01.500
sort of what the changed standard of review, the more limited standard of review that we're

01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:10.540
looking at. And also for folks who are watching that noticing that it is quite a different

01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:18.780
standard review than what we have undertaken before. I remember when 1505 was enacted and

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:26.780
I think it was described as the first major overhaul to the charter school law since its

01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:33.260
inception and laws have consequences. I think the abuse of discretion standard is quite clear

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:42.780
that it is a more limited review. So the conversation on the merits is a much more

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:50.540
circumscribed form of review that we're undertaking. And I think CDE analysis has been, I think,

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:58.540
quite compelling around why on the merits there hasn't been an abuse of discretion.

01:52:59.260 --> 01:53:06.460
The procedural pieces, I think, and it was very helpful just to hear the totality of the

01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:16.860
circumstances description that was just provided. I did just want to ask around the piece on the

01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:25.420
transcript. I appreciate the clarification as to the time differential that was raised and

01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:30.860
certainly I don't think equal time would mean leaving, for example, a 30-minute timer

01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:39.420
going just because the other side had presented for 30 minutes and not having asked for additional

01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:50.060
time having been given as much time as the petitioner wanted to provide I think is actually

01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:59.180
a pretty generous version of how the time could be allotted. I did want to just confirm that

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:08.300
there's nothing in Ed code that prohibits, however, a video transcript as being the official

01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:21.340
record. Stephanie, can you respond to that? I can. There is not anything in Ed code and I'm

01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:28.460
sure Judy Sias can weigh in if this is not correct, but there is nothing in Ed code that

01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:38.540
prohibits a video being sent or being used as the transcript. I believe that the Ed code states

01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:49.900
just transcript. It doesn't even state written transcript. For now, CDE has made the decision

01:54:49.900 --> 01:55:00.540
that a video transcript or a video is sufficient for a transcript. We do ask that there be timing

01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:09.180
on the video so that it can be cited to, but you are correct that Ed code does not prohibit a video.

01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:13.980
Judy, did you want to add anything?

01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:24.780
Yes, Stephanie is correct. Ed code does not prohibit a video transcript and there are other

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:30.300
agencies that accept video transcript in these types of hearings. If the goal of the transcript

01:55:31.020 --> 01:55:36.940
is to allow the petitioners to have a record of what has occurred, the video with the time stamps

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:43.420
seem to achieve the same result. Thank you. Thank you. Member Olken?

01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:57.660
Thank you. First, as we were talking about time and the differential on amount of time for

01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:05.820
presentations, one thing I've noted over the last couple of days is our very clear each side gets 12

01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:22.060
minutes. I don't have any indication that that's a requirement in any way

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:31.180
of law. It's an interesting way of looking at what equal time looks like. I want to put that out

01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:43.020
there. The second thing is as somebody who leads to charter schools, I think

01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:55.260
as I was listening to and reading through the concerns about the viability of Samoa Beach Academy,

01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:04.060
there were pieces where I thought to myself, in my world, I might very well be the person

01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:11.900
heating lunch because if the choice is I'm going to put money into the classroom or I'm going to

01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:18.300
put money into the heating of lunches, I guarantee you I'm putting money in the classroom and I am

01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:26.860
heating lunches up. There were quite a few examples of that in the concerns and in the

01:57:31.580 --> 01:57:36.700
reasons that either the budget or the academic program were deemed unsound where I thought

01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:44.700
through my lens, I'm not sure about that, or I disagree. That said, I don't believe

01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:48.460
that that's the standard by which we're supposed to be deciding today.

01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:59.740
I appreciated former Governor Brown's comments about that being frustrating.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:12.940
I appreciated him calling in to that effect. I just feel like it's important to put these

01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:27.660
things out here. That leads me to the second part, which is AB 1505 was a long and

01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:37.580
collaborative and complicated process to get it passed. I think in the charter school world,

01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:44.460
there was a sense that in exchange for what was definitely some dialing back of

01:58:49.260 --> 01:58:55.180
the onus for denial, putting more responsibility on charter schools, put it that way, there were

01:58:55.180 --> 01:59:06.700
some procedural safeguards enacted that felt important because we see in schools all the time

01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:11.100
the importance of procedural safeguards. We see the importance of procedural safeguards for

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:17.020
students going through the IEP process or through the disciplinary process. These things matter.

01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:31.980
I was wondering if we could re-hear from the department why they believe that the

01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:37.740
process wasn't followed entirely, but that they didn't raise to the level of

01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:42.700
abusive discretion. I was wondering if we could re-hear those because that feels like a really

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:45.740
key point to me in terms of being able to make a decision.

01:59:47.100 --> 01:59:54.620
Thank you. I think we want to ask Stephanie and perhaps Judy to come back to the discussion.

01:59:54.780 --> 02:00:03.820
Thank you. I think we want to ask Stephanie and perhaps Judy to respond to that.

02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:11.420
Thank you. I'm actually standing here with CDE's chief counsel, Amy Holloway,

02:00:11.420 --> 02:00:14.460
who would like to respond. Thank you.

02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:24.380
I can't see over the podium. Good morning, Amy Holloway. I am now the deputy

02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:29.500
over the charter schools division. Normally when we were in person you'd see me at a desk and

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:34.620
avoiding public comment. I feel compelled in this instance to give you some information,

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:41.180
in particular in response to member Olken's comments, which are well taken. I think that

02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:47.420
we need to make sure that the record is clear that what 47605 requires is equivalent time and

02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:54.300
procedure. It does not require equal, so equivalent should mean that it feels fair on the record

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:59.340
about whether each side had appropriate and adequate opportunity to be heard. We haven't

02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:04.700
heard from SBA that they did not feel that they didn't have sufficient time or that they didn't

02:01:04.700 --> 02:01:11.820
ask for additional time. What they said was we needed 10 minutes, so the district and the county

02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:16.380
in this instance should have been limited to 10 minutes and that the questions that the board

02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:21.500
members had for the county should have been limited to the same number of questions or the

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:27.740
same amount of time for SBA. As decision makers, think about how you would feel if your discretion

02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:33.740
were limited that you had to ask each side the same number or types of questions. Now there may

02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:38.860
be that SBA felt that if it had opportunities to answer questions it could have presented additional

02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:45.900
information, but the record does not require, the statute does not require that the board's exercise

02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:51.820
of discretion in asking each side the same number of questions or have the same issues for each side.

02:01:55.020 --> 02:02:01.740
I also appreciate the member Olkins comments about she did not agree in some cases and I think that's

02:02:01.740 --> 02:02:08.380
going to be a very hard place for you all to be as well as you know in reviewing the decisions,

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:14.540
but courts have made clear that in an abuse of discretion standard you don't get to substitute

02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:22.300
your judgment for that of the trial or fact or the parties that heard that and in fact many of

02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:27.580
the lawsuits that we see against the state are from folks saying we think you should have operated

02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:31.820
this program differently, not that the law required it but we think you should have done something,

02:02:31.820 --> 02:02:37.500
you should have exercised your discretion differently. So I think member Olkins comments

02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:42.860
are helpful to locals about how they should be looking at these petitions when they come before

02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:49.740
them and it may be a good signal to the legislature that there is some needed

02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:56.700
amendments to the statute. I don't know but I take her comments to heart and also wanted

02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:02.620
to mention that the staff around this item worked extremely hard, the charter school staff, legal

02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:09.180
staff to make sure that they were implementing the statute as written in spite of its areas where

02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:17.100
clarity would be of benefit. And lastly with regard to the procedural safeguards,

02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:25.740
we take each case as it's presented so in another case the equivalent time might be more dramatic,

02:03:25.740 --> 02:03:31.820
it might have been imposed to limit the charter schools or the district or the county's ability

02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:36.780
to present the information that they felt that the board needed to make their decisions. That's

02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:43.500
not necessarily in the record, it's not in the record as presented to you today. And lastly with

02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:49.580
regard to the transcript, if an issue was raised about the manner in which the hearing was held

02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:57.980
and the transcript would demonstrate that and a charter petitioner is inhibited or barred in their

02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:02.380
ability to present that information, then this board could find that the failure to have a

02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:12.140
transcript was something that could be viewed against the local decision and you could overturn

02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:17.740
that. But that's not the case here again and the transcript itself does not constitute

02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:24.860
the decision that was before the local board. It documents it and the process that they use,

02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:30.300
so I don't want to minimize its importance. The statute does not require the districts to create,

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:36.140
develop or maintain a transcript. It says the districts and the county shall produce a written

02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:46.540
record including transcripts and I know that's a point that's a little vague but we don't impose

02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:54.620
obligations on local districts, local LA's without express statutory authority for that. So thank you.

02:04:55.020 --> 02:05:02.220
And just to clarify, there was a video which is serving as the transcript, is that correct?

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:04.220
Yes, from the district.

02:05:04.220 --> 02:05:10.220
Thank you. Are there other questions or comments?

02:05:10.620 --> 02:05:13.820
Are there other questions or comments?

02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:29.420
All right, I think if there are not additional questions or comments, we're probably ready for

02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:39.260
a motion and I just would like to say as we're thinking about the motion, just to reinforce

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:44.540
that this is a complicated situation. We're asked to make a procedural determination not

02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:52.380
based on the merits of the petition. I shared your view, Member Olken, that sometimes the standard

02:05:52.380 --> 02:05:57.740
that was applied was a standard of how would we do it in a traditional setting, not necessarily how

02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:06.220
might an innovative school approach particular elements of the program. So I think it's important

02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:15.500
for us just to, as Amy said, to be clear that that's not an expectation that we're holding of

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:23.740
the review of charges but Governor Brown was right that the decision we make is by legislative

02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:31.100
requirement one that is really only about the procedural elements of this, not the merits

02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:36.780
of the petition itself. We're doing our due diligence and implementing the statute to the

02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:43.820
best of our ability and unless we're finding that, for example, in the cases that Member

02:06:43.820 --> 02:06:49.100
Olken raised that the decision was, quote, entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:56.940
which is the standard that we've been given, we will not be substituting our judgment for the

02:06:56.940 --> 02:07:03.100
judgment of the people who reviewed the petition. I do appreciate all the public comments and letters

02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:09.420
we received on the issue. There's a heightened level of attention surrounding the action to

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:15.420
be taken today because this is the first abuse of discretion appeal implementing AB 1505.

02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:21.100
I understand because it's a new process there's been a significant shift in the board's role and

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:26.780
authority. There may be a temptation for folks to speculate about future board actions based

02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:33.660
solely on this single appeal because it is the first one in line and I do want to provide a

02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:42.300
caution about reading too much into today's decision should we move to approve the

02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:48.700
department's recommendation. Both the department and the board are taking a new charge very

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:53.900
seriously. The analysis and the board's decision are based on this specific administrative record

02:07:53.900 --> 02:08:01.420
before us, the totality of the circumstances in this particular appeal. We have received a

02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:08.220
thorough analysis, I thank the CDE staff for that, and in the future each petition and each

02:08:08.220 --> 02:08:13.660
administrative record will receive the same level of review and analysis and the board will make a

02:08:13.660 --> 02:08:20.940
decision based on the totality of the particular circumstances involved. I don't want to discuss

02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:27.180
hypotheticals but if we move to approve the department's recommendation the action today

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:32.540
should not be misconstrued as sending a message that we're not concerned about procedural issues

02:08:32.540 --> 02:08:38.380
or evidentiary issues or that those issues might never serve as the basis for a determination

02:08:39.020 --> 02:08:46.140
that there has been an abuse of discretion. So with that framing I'd like to see if we have

02:08:46.140 --> 02:08:54.460
someone who'd like to make a motion on this decision. Member Glover Woods.

02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:05.020
Thank you President Darling-Hammond for that framing. So with that being said I do move that

02:09:05.020 --> 02:09:13.100
we affirm the CDE recommendation and affirm the decision to deny the SBA charter petition

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:20.380
that was made by the district and the county office. And do I have a second for that motion?

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:26.940
I second it. Thank you very much. Any further discussion of the motion?

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:36.460
Member Glover Woods your hand is okay it's going down. Seeing no other discussion I would ask

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:40.700
Brooks to call the roll for the vote. Member Rodriguez.

02:09:42.380 --> 02:09:50.860
Aye. Member Petillo-Brownson. Yes. Member Orozco-Gonzalez. Yes. Member Olken.

02:09:54.060 --> 02:10:02.780
Yes. Member McQuillan. Aye. Member Lewis. Yes. Vice President Glover Woods.

02:10:03.260 --> 02:10:15.100
Yes. Member Escobedo. Yes. President Darling-Hammond. Yes. Member Bonacca. Aye. Motion carries.

02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:26.220
Thank you and we'll now take a 15 minute break and return at 1140.

02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:38.140
All right welcome back everyone. Board members we need to re-establish the quorum so Brooks is

02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:47.180
going to call the roll. Member Rodriguez. Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson. Yes. Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:59.020
Yes. Member Olken. Yes. Member McQuillan. Yes. Member Lewis. Yes. Vice President Glover Woods.

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:08.780
Yes. Member Lewis. Yes. Vice President Glover Woods. Yes. Member Escobedo. Yes. President Darling-Hammond.

02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:14.780
Yes. Member Bonacca. Yes. Everyone's present we have a quorum.

02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:23.500
All right so we're up to item 8018 which is the time community school consider issuing a notice

02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:33.340
of violation pursuant to California education code 47607G and this item will be presented by

02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:45.500
Stephanie. Stephanie please begin. Thank you. So item number 18 consideration of the issuance

02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:51.500
of a notice of violation to time community school pursuant to California education code section

02:11:52.140 --> 02:12:03.100
47607G. A little background on time. The appeal to establish TCS was heard by the California

02:12:03.100 --> 02:12:09.260
State Board of Education at its July 9th 2020 meeting. At this meeting the CDE recommended

02:12:09.260 --> 02:12:16.060
that the SBE deny the TCS petition. At its June 9th 2020 meeting the advisory commission on charter

02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:20.700
schools did not agree with CDE's recommendation to deny the school and instead voted to approve

02:12:20.700 --> 02:12:26.620
the TCS petition with a delay in opening for one year. The motion passed by a vote of seven to two.

02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:32.780
The SBE voted to approve the charter petition to establish time for a term of five years effective

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:40.460
July 1 2020 with a delay in opening and starting instruction in the 21-22 school year. That motion

02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:47.980
passed by 10 votes. At the same meeting this SBE delegated delegated oversight of time charter

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:54.540
school to the Los Angeles County Board of Education pursuant to former ed code section 47605K1.

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:59.820
The Los Angeles County Board of Education delegated monitoring and oversight of TCS

02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:02.460
to the Los Angeles County Office of Education.

02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:14.300
Since March 2022 CDE and SBE staff have been in communication with LACO about LACO's concerns

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:20.300
regarding the sustainability of time charter school. Due to the nature of the concerns a

02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:25.420
recommendation to the state board of ed regarding the issuance of a notice of violation to TCS was

02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:30.780
discussed. At that time LACO expressed their desire to continue collaborating and providing

02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:36.460
guidance to TCS in the hopes of bringing the school into compliance and into a more stable

02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:45.580
fiscal position. The CDE and LACO believe that there is substantial evidence that TCS

02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:51.180
engaged in fiscal mismanagement failed to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes identified

02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:57.820
in the charter petition and committed a material violation of the conditions standards or procedures

02:13:57.820 --> 02:14:03.580
set forth in the charter petition. For the aforementioned reason the CDE recommends that

02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:09.420
the SBE consider issuing a notice of violation to time charter school pursuant to ed code section

02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:19.660
47607G. And so now President Darling-Hammond I am going to hand over the bulk of the presentation

02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:28.060
to the Los Angeles County Office of Education Mr. Indra Chikarali who is the Director II of

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:34.700
the charter school's office for LACO and as they have been conducting the oversight of time they will

02:14:36.300 --> 02:14:43.260
provide the board with the details of why we are asking the board to issue a notice of violation.

02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:45.020
Mr. Chikarali.

02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:49.180
Great thank you so much.

02:15:05.660 --> 02:15:08.300
There you go and that is that screen up for everybody to see?

02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:09.020
Yes.

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:10.380
All right thank you.

02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:21.180
Good morning board members as you know Time Community School began instruction in July of 2021

02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:26.220
within the boundaries of the Montebello Unified School District. In its first year of operation

02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:32.940
Time planned to enroll 260 students in grades 9 and 10. Prior to opening the school submitted

02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:39.740
evidence of enrollment for 263 students. Despite this evidence the school opened with only 27

02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:45.340
students and eventually enrolled a total of just 41 students by October failing to enroll any

02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:54.300
additional students throughout the school year. Here you have the school's mission and operating

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:58.060
entity presented to you on the screen in front of you.

02:15:58.140 --> 02:15:59.260
On the screen in front of you.

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:04.060
Give you a moment to read that.

02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:16.700
Since Time's authorization LACO has taken many steps to support time including seven site visits

02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:21.980
by LACO staff including the charter school office facilities unit and Los Angeles County SELPA.

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:26.940
Two comprehensive meetings with the executive director and members of the governing board

02:16:26.940 --> 02:16:32.140
monthly fiscal monitoring bi-weekly zoom meetings with all authorized county charter schools

02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:38.060
and regular meetings calls and emails with a LACO assigned coordinator. Unfortunately time has been

02:16:38.060 --> 02:16:42.540
unwilling to implement much of the guidance offered by LACO staff based on LACO's extensive

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:48.140
experience with new charter schools. Therefore despite this widespread support LACO staff were

02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:54.140
prompted to send out two notifications of concern delivered to the time board on January 26th

02:16:54.140 --> 02:17:05.580
and June 28th of 2022. The following items were listed in the January 26th notice of concern.

02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:10.860
Time failed to demonstrate financial viability in the current and subsequent fiscal years

02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:16.300
due to its enrollment shortfall, deficit spending, potential cash def deficiencies,

02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:21.740
reliance on debts, and a negative ending net position for the 2021-22 fiscal year.

02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:27.420
Time failed to demonstrate the implementation of ELD standards for long-term English learners

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:32.460
as required by federal and state law. This population represents almost half the school's

02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:38.460
student body. Time failed to implement teacher credentialing requirements and lastly at the time

02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:43.980
of the LACO fall oversight visit time had not cured all required corrections from an initial

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:50.460
facility inspection conducted on May 26, 2021. Time did however work with the Montebello Unified

02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:53.580
School District to eventually cure these remaining corrections.

02:17:58.060 --> 02:18:03.580
As previously mentioned, LACO sent time a second notice of concern on June 28th based on the issues

02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:08.300
listed here. Each concern will be detailed in the slides to follow.

02:18:13.660 --> 02:18:19.580
First, both LACO and CDE staff found that the time budget and multi-year projections are based

02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:24.860
on unrealistic enrollment projections. In addition, time is fiscally insolvent for the

02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:30.380
current fiscal year and also in the subsequent two fiscal years due to unrealistic projections.

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:41.340
This table before you here illustrates time's unrealistic enrollment in ADA projections

02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:49.660
from its PENSEC report to fiscal year 2023-24. The proposed ADA increase in 2022-23

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:57.100
represents 185% increase from the 2021-22 enrollment. In addition, there is another

02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:08.300
50% increase in 2023-24 for a two-year total increase of 120 ADA or a 327% increase from 2021-22.

02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:20.220
This table here illustrates projected fiscal insolvency and includes the school's financial data

02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:26.700
submitted for fiscal year 2021-22 operation, including the budget, first and second interims

02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:35.180
and actuals through May 31, 2022. Time ended May 31, 2022 with a structural deficit of negative

02:19:35.180 --> 02:19:45.740
$321,464 and an ending net position of negative $211,793. In addition,

02:19:45.740 --> 02:19:50.300
time's reserves for economic uncertainties is a negative 21.7%.

02:19:58.700 --> 02:20:02.780
This slide illustrates the concerns of debt accumulation and cash flow projections.

02:20:03.660 --> 02:20:14.380
As of May 31, 2022, time has a fund balance of negative $211,794, notes payable of $211,348

02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:19.180
due to the executive director and a loan owed to the California School of Finance Authority

02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:31.660
for $100,000. Also, as of May 31, 2022, time has a cash balance of $8,105 or three days of operating

02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:39.260
cash. For fiscal year 2022-23, the school plans to sell current and future receivables and access

02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:44.140
a California School of Finance Authority revolving loan in the amount of $150,000.

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:52.220
Cash flow projections reflect negative cash balances for six out of 12 months in 2022-23.

02:20:53.260 --> 02:20:57.100
Due to cash deficiencies and reliance on borrowing, time may not be able to meet

02:20:57.100 --> 02:21:00.940
its obligations, including payroll expenses and related benefits.

02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:06.940
I would now like to hand the presentation over to my colleague, Dr. Daryl Brown, coordinator

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:11.660
three with the Los Angeles County Office of Education to review student academic outcomes.

02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:18.620
Thank you, Indra. As the school has struggled to meet its financial obligations,

02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:22.220
it has also struggled to meet the academic obligations to its students.

02:21:22.860 --> 02:21:29.020
Time submitted an annual report to LACO that included NWEA benchmark data for the 21-22 school

02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:34.380
year. However, no students took all three assessments given in the fall, winter, and spring

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:40.060
for language usage, and only 8% of students took two out of three tests for language usage.

02:21:40.780 --> 02:21:45.500
Benchmark participation rates in all academic areas were significantly below

02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:50.060
the 95% threshold established by the SBE for verifiable student data.

02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:55.500
The majority of students, two-thirds, did not meet the expected growth metric that

02:21:55.500 --> 02:22:01.100
would be required for renewal. This lack of student data directly impacts LACO's ability

02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:05.820
to assess student learning and causes concern regarding the school's process for assessing

02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:11.580
students as well as how instructional decisions are being made. On June 28,

02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:17.100
Time submitted a revised version of the annual report based on additional data requested by LACO.

02:22:17.980 --> 02:22:22.860
This updated report did not change the findings related to the school failing to report benchmark

02:22:22.860 --> 02:22:28.860
data for all students and low student participation. In addition, the report did not include an

02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:36.460
analysis of NWEA conditional growth index data as also requested by LACO. Troublingly,

02:22:36.460 --> 02:22:42.940
the report incorrectly compares CASP proficiency data from Montebello Unified School District

02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:49.580
to Time's NWEA growth data. Time's growth data is based on NWEA assessments which are in no way

02:22:49.580 --> 02:22:56.140
designed to be comparable to CASP proficiency data. Time's continued attempt to compare these

02:22:56.140 --> 02:23:01.500
incongruous metrics again causes concern over Time's ability to analyze their data.

02:23:04.620 --> 02:23:10.460
With regard to operations, the school facility that Time occupied in 21-22 did not align with

02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:15.900
the facility design included in the charter petition. The petition includes an illustration

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:20.780
of an open classroom space with border-free classrooms and a central learning hub designed

02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:26.140
to support the unique Time community school's learning model. Despite discussions regarding

02:23:26.140 --> 02:23:30.700
how accommodations and modifications might be made for the school to be more reflective

02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:35.500
of the learning model described in the petition, Time continued to reflect a traditional standard

02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:42.860
program throughout the 21-22 school year. In regards to staffing, the 22-23 proposed staffing

02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:48.460
list does not include a full-time counselor. The originally approved petition included one counselor

02:23:48.460 --> 02:23:54.940
in year one, adding an additional counselor in years two and three. During the 21-22 school year,

02:23:54.940 --> 02:24:00.700
Time did hire a counselor. However, after staff turnover in the fall, the counseling position was

02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:06.380
left vacant. The impact was immediate as the school admitted that the loss of the counselor

02:24:06.380 --> 02:24:11.980
early in the school year caused participation errors with benchmark testing. Dr. Ramirez,

02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:16.940
the Time executive director, has stated that he will continue to assume counseling responsibilities.

02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.260
However, he does not hold a counseling credential and has cited experience with

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:27.340
college admissions and scheduling only. In addition to academic support, a counselor plays a significant

02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:31.740
role in the social and emotional lives of students, particularly during this time where we have seen

02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:37.340
increases in the social and emotional needs of students resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic

02:24:37.340 --> 02:24:42.780
and traumatic experiences outside of school. Failure to include this critical staff position

02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:47.020
calls into question Time's ability to adequately serve the needs of its students.

02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:52.860
Finally, there are some additional concerns for the board to take into account.

02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:59.420
Time has submitted a material revision to change locations and modify the school calendar for the

02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:05.340
upcoming school year. It is unclear how and when the school will make necessary upgrades to the

02:25:05.340 --> 02:25:11.660
proposed private location. The material revision includes an affidavit which states that Time will

02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:17.020
complete the required facilities fixes contingent upon LACO providing the school a letter of good

02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:22.700
standing for the sale of receivables. LACO has previously met with members of the Time board

02:25:22.700 --> 02:25:27.340
and the executive director and informed them that a letter of good standing would not be issued.

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:34.620
Time is also awaiting an accreditation term based on its initial WASP visit in April of 2022.

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:40.220
Lastly, there is a concern regarding the organizational guidance provided by the

02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:46.220
Time board in light of the previously mentioned fiscal academic and instructional program concerns.

02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:54.540
Thank you, Dr. Brown. In summary, while there has been some extenuating circumstances such as the

02:25:54.540 --> 02:26:00.540
COVID pandemic, that does not change the fact that despite widespread guidance and support,

02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:05.340
Time has been unable to demonstrate fiscal sustainability, program adherence,

02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:12.220
or positive student outcomes. Thank you so much and I will now hand the presentation back to CDE staff.

02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:26.620
Thank you, LACO staff for the presentation. So in conclusion, the CDE and LACO believe that there

02:26:26.620 --> 02:26:31.740
is substantial evidence that TCS engaged in fiscal mismanagement failed to meet or pursue any of the

02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:36.460
people outcomes identified in the charter petition and committed a material violation of the condition

02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:41.900
standards or procedures set forth in the charter petition. The CDE recommends that the SBE

02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:50.620
consider issuing a notice of violation to TCS and as stated in the draft notice of violation

02:26:50.620 --> 02:26:56.540
that is included in your item, TCS does have until July 20th to respond to the notice of violation.

02:26:58.460 --> 02:27:04.780
And that ends our presentation. All right, do you want to put up the public comment slide?

02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:10.620
So we will now open the phone line for public comment. Members of the public wishing to provide

02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:14.940
comment on the item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code

02:27:14.940 --> 02:27:20.620
provided on the slide that is shown now. While we're waiting for members of the public to queue up

02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:26.860
for comment, I want to ask Vice President Glover-Woods and Member Olken if they have any initial comments,

02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:30.460
and then if we have any clarifying questions, we'll be happy to answer them.

02:27:30.940 --> 02:27:32.300
Vice President Glover-Woods.

02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:41.500
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Just to help to frame what we will be deciding in this

02:27:41.500 --> 02:27:50.140
particular item, again, we've received a lot of information regarding the concern, as well as

02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:57.020
information we've received from the SBE. We've received a lot of information from the SBE

02:27:57.260 --> 02:28:03.980
as well as information we've received from the charter itself. The action that we would be looking

02:28:03.980 --> 02:28:11.740
at today would be to issue a notice of violation. It's not a revocation, but a notice of violation

02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:18.060
to provide opportunity in a formal manner for the charter to respond to some of the concerns

02:28:18.060 --> 02:28:22.780
that have been brought forward. Thank you. Member Olken?

02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:26.140
I don't have anything to add at this time. Thank you.

02:28:26.140 --> 02:28:34.220
Thank you. In terms of clarifying questions, I'm going to ask one and then invite others if they

02:28:34.220 --> 02:28:43.420
have clarifying questions as well. One of the first points on the list of concerns is fiscal

02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:51.100
mismanagement, and I saw plenty of evidence of fiscal instability and concern.

02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:56.780
I don't know that I understood what the mismanagement

02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:01.020
point was, and maybe you could clarify that for us.

02:29:04.300 --> 02:29:08.220
Thank you, President Hammond. Thank you for the question. I'm happy to answer that.

02:29:09.020 --> 02:29:16.460
We really saw fiscal mismanagement for time as three big items. One, their lack of a strategic

02:29:16.460 --> 02:29:23.820
plan to get out of debt. Two, their failure to prioritize actions to adhere to the PCSGP

02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:28.220
grant requirements and to pursue other grant opportunities. And then finally,

02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:31.820
their failure to adjust their expenditures to reflect the actual budget.

02:29:34.460 --> 02:29:38.700
Thank you. Any other clarifying questions?

02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:44.780
All right. With that, we will go to public comment if there are some.

02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:50.940
So, yes, we have five callers in the queue. I will open up the phone line now.

02:29:52.540 --> 02:29:55.100
Good afternoon. Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:29:55.100 --> 02:29:56.860
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:07.420
Hi. I hope it's me that's talking. Mark Scott is my name. I'm a former

02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:13.340
Los Angeles County Office of Education employee. We did about 20 years there

02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:20.460
in crisis intervention. My comment is to a pretty small window, but I'll try to describe

02:30:20.460 --> 02:30:27.580
it as quickly as possible. I just saw an incredible effort in community support and culture,

02:30:29.260 --> 02:30:37.020
working with the facilities that were limited in opportunity. I won't say there was hostility,

02:30:37.020 --> 02:30:45.900
but certainly there was difficulty in accessing the facilities. But I still saw a lot of progress

02:30:45.900 --> 02:30:54.140
in using the facility for everything from open area workshops in the auditorium to open area labs

02:30:55.020 --> 02:31:01.260
in the science lab. But what I was most impressed with was their trauma mitigation.

02:31:01.740 --> 02:31:10.940
And from my perspective, working in MTSS and PBIS, seeing that they had reduced office referrals,

02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:15.660
that resulted more in access to curriculum, which is my perspective.

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:17.820
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Thank you.

02:31:19.260 --> 02:31:21.740
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:23.500
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:30.140
Good morning, State Board of Education members. My name is Lorraine Richards,

02:31:30.140 --> 02:31:35.100
and I am a classroom teacher representing California Teacher Association. CTA supports

02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:40.860
the CDE's recommendation that the State Board of Education consider issuing a notice of violation

02:31:40.860 --> 02:31:46.940
to time community schools. As outlined in the item, time has committed the following,

02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:52.460
fiscal mismanagement, failure to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes identified in the

02:31:52.460 --> 02:31:57.740
charter petition, and violation of several conditions, standards, or procedures set forth

02:31:57.740 --> 02:32:03.500
in the charter petition. These issues were clearly predicted by the CDE during the July

02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:10.060
2020 hearing for time, and now it is time for the State Board of Education to take action by issuing

02:32:10.060 --> 02:32:12.380
the notice of violation. Thank you very much.

02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:15.660
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:17.260
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:24.460
Good afternoon. My name is Lisa Kimada from the Montevallo Teachers Association.

02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:30.140
I am in support of a violation notice going to time charter because of the local and county

02:32:30.140 --> 02:32:37.820
denials showing strong indicators that the students are being compromised regarding their safety,

02:32:37.820 --> 02:32:42.780
their security, and their academic stability. There is no counselor, there is no accreditation,

02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:47.500
and there is insufficient assessment data. There is, however, clear fiscal responsibility.

02:32:47.500 --> 02:32:52.780
During this climate in America, safety is paramount, and time charter shows no indication

02:32:52.780 --> 02:32:57.100
of doing anything to support the security and safety of students. Thank you.

02:32:57.100 --> 02:33:00.460
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:33:00.460 --> 02:33:02.060
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:33:04.460 --> 02:33:07.660
Good morning. My name is Jessica Zwaal, and I work at Montevallo High School,

02:33:07.660 --> 02:33:10.380
and I'm here as a member of the Montevallo Teachers Association.

02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:15.740
Speaking in favor of the notice of violation to the time community charter item 18,

02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:19.100
the school should have never been approved after it was denied by the Montevallo Unified

02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:23.580
School Board and the Los Angeles County Office of Education. This was a disservice to students

02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:29.820
at both time charter and Montevallo High. Time charter lacked participation in benchmark

02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:34.300
assessments, has no accreditation, and did not provide counselors. Time charter provided

02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:38.700
broken promises to its students and families. Observations alone revealed attendance was an

02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:43.260
issue at time charter. Montevallo High School provided multiple classrooms to time charter,

02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:47.740
and it barely had enrollment to host a partial class. Time community has had trouble managing

02:33:47.740 --> 02:33:52.460
student behavior. Students disrupted educational services at Montevallo High School because they

02:33:52.460 --> 02:33:56.300
tried to integrate themselves into the Montevallo High School classrooms because they wanted to be

02:33:56.300 --> 02:34:00.860
part of the traditional high school and not the charter. Time charter destroyed substantial

02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:07.420
equipment in the computer lab, paid for by the district, and they only used that they did not

02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:12.300
notify anyone. Thank you. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:14.380
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:22.620
Well, my name is Lamar Brown, the president of Time Community Schools. I'm here today to provide

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:27.820
assurance that SBE is asking for in regards to our financial statement capacity. The TCS

02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:31.260
Board conducts every meeting committed to transparency, thoughtfulness, integrity,

02:34:31.260 --> 02:34:35.340
and a desire to look out for the interests of all stakeholders. As the president, it's an honor to

02:34:35.340 --> 02:34:40.860
work with TCS, and no one understands the fiscal responsibility that has been bestowed upon us

02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:45.020
within the last past school year. I have been challenging the board, the executive director,

02:34:45.020 --> 02:34:49.100
and the TCS team revigilant in examining our finances throughout the year. We made a tough

02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:53.660
decision to cut expenditures to ensure our academic program could continue to operate

02:34:53.660 --> 02:34:57.900
successfully. We have utilized best practices and captain of resources that charter schools

02:34:57.900 --> 02:35:02.940
regularly use, especially startups. Currently, our enrollment has nearly doubled what it was last

02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:07.420
year, and we have students each day. We have the students and the budget to be valuable and

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:12.460
sustainable. Please do not move forward with this notice because TCS has provided the—will provide

02:35:12.460 --> 02:35:16.700
the evidence, the tenacity and commitment to operate what we would believe to be the best

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:20.940
school in the state of California. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:35:20.940 --> 02:35:23.260
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:30.060
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed board members. My name is Gina Plait

02:35:30.060 --> 02:35:35.340
from the California Charter Schools Association. The state board unanimously approved this school

02:35:35.340 --> 02:35:40.060
back in 2020 as the board saw the value that it was bringing to this local community.

02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:45.020
And then while we thought we knew what the impacts of the pandemic were, the truth is nobody

02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:49.180
could have predicted the many challenges that came up when trying to open a school during the

02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:55.340
pandemic and in a Prop 39 facility. The challenges that you have read about in your materials,

02:35:55.340 --> 02:36:01.180
including the info included in recent legal action, resulted in fewer enrollments than projected,

02:36:01.180 --> 02:36:05.180
and this is not fiscal mismanagement and should not be characterized as such.

02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:09.980
Now, however, the school is in its own facility and not facing the many burdens they face

02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:16.060
previously. School starts on August 17th, and if you issue this notice, you will only impede

02:36:16.060 --> 02:36:21.580
the momentum that the school has finally generated. We respectfully request that you not issue the

02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:26.460
notice of violation. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:36:26.460 --> 02:36:28.540
for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:38.300
Caller, you are live. Please state your name and affiliation.

02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:45.660
Hi, my name is Brandi Price. I'm the vice president of the TCS board. TCS opened its doors

02:36:45.660 --> 02:36:50.140
to students in July 2021, and children who were not thriving in traditional schools found their

02:36:50.140 --> 02:36:56.620
way to us. The incoming ninth grade class GPA was 1.71, and for 10th grade it was 1.2. The innovative

02:36:56.620 --> 02:37:00.380
time learning model was created for all students, and especially for those who have not experienced

02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:07.580
success in school often or yet. The TCS ninth grade semester two class GPA was 2.77, and for

02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:13.340
10th grade 2.56, grades indicate something beyond academic achievement, engagement.

02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:18.060
Our students became invested in school, and it showed anyone fortunate enough to visit the campus

02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:24.700
side. Next year, TCS, this upcoming school year, TCS will have its own facility of significant

02:37:24.700 --> 02:37:29.420
development. The proposition 39 facility did not appeal to families, and consequently we lost

02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:35.180
enrollment. Notably, our enrollment has already nearly doubled. This year we had challenges,

02:37:35.180 --> 02:37:41.180
but also so many successes. Nearly 50 percent of our students had GPAs of 1.0 or below,

02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:44.620
nearly before joining us. Thank you, Coller, your time is up.

02:37:46.460 --> 02:37:51.180
Thank you, Coller. That concludes public comment for item number 18.

02:37:54.940 --> 02:38:01.020
All right, thank you very much. I want to allow three minutes of time for Dr. Gabriel

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:03.260
Ramirez, the school's leader, to address the board.

02:38:10.700 --> 02:38:16.060
Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Great, thank you. Good morning, President Darlene Hammond and SBE

02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:20.140
board members. My name is Dr. Gabriel Ramirez, and I am the executive director and founder of

02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:24.060
Time Community Schools. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today, although I wish

02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:28.700
the invitation was rooted in celebrating the many successes of time. Like our many school-wide

02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:33.020
academic improvements, the growth of our student leaders, development of partnerships,

02:38:33.020 --> 02:38:37.580
and the many stories of individual student transformations. Also, I'd like to share that

02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:42.380
we were just informed that we will be moving on to the final round for membership to the League of

02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:46.620
Innovative Schools, a national network that connects and supports the most forward-thinking

02:38:46.620 --> 02:38:51.580
leaders in education, started by the Department of Education under President Obama. Today I will

02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:56.380
provide you with the facts and assurance needed to dismiss this notice of violation. The first

02:38:56.380 --> 02:39:01.260
finding attempts to connect fiscal mismanagement to low enrollment. This is a false equivalent.

02:39:01.260 --> 02:39:05.420
While TCS did not meet first-year projections due to the global pandemic and the challenging

02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:10.540
relationship we had with our local district, time has worked diligently to increase our enrollment,

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:16.700
and currently TCS has 72 fully registered students with another 16 in process of completing

02:39:16.700 --> 02:39:22.780
registration, a total of 88 families. TCS has essentially increased its enrollment by over 100%.

02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:29.980
Also, TCS has over 200 families who have expressed interest in our school, so we continue to recruit

02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:35.180
and our numbers will increase. TCS has provided LACO the names of our registered families, which

02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:41.740
is the evidence needed to demonstrate that our projections are not unrealistic. In order to give

02:39:41.740 --> 02:39:47.900
more assurance, we have reworked our budget at 85 students, and time is financially viable and is

02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:52.540
able to meet its reserve requirements. Next, the finding alleges that time did not meet

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:57.820
pupil outcomes identified in the charter petition. To clarify, time's petition identifies pupil

02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:03.420
outcomes in relation to state assessments, and time did not assess students because we currently

02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:09.580
do not have an 11th grade class to provide any data. In regards to NWEA benchmarks, time has

02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:15.340
provided all data to the LACO, including all other academic data requested. TCS looks forward to

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:19.980
sharing student state assessment scores once we have an 11th grade class to establish a baseline

02:40:19.980 --> 02:40:26.460
and then to compare to future classes. We have pursued the pupil outcomes using the NWEA assessment

02:40:26.460 --> 02:40:31.180
as a benchmark. The third finding provides that time committed a mature revision in relation to

02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:37.260
our charter petition specific to facilities. In our charter petition, we described our ideal of

02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:41.580
what we would like our school to someday look like. However, in our charter petition, we also

02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:47.740
acknowledged that this might not be possible due to facility requirements and our growth.

02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:51.820
TCS has made every effort to incorporate the furniture, the physical design, and use of

02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:57.420
collaborative procedures to transform every classroom into a tool to aid in learning and

02:40:57.420 --> 02:41:03.420
meet our vision, despite the constraints of Prop 39. On July 29, 2020, the SBE approved

02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:07.820
time's charter position because the SBE believed in our innovation and capacity. Time has made

02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:12.460
extraordinary progress and has had a profound impact on our community. We have addressed all

02:41:12.460 --> 02:41:17.100
concerns, financial and academic, and have demonstrated that we are viable and capable.

02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:21.420
Thank you. I'm asking today that the board not move forward with the notice of violation.

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:22.380
Thank you. Thank you.

02:41:27.900 --> 02:41:33.180
All right. Thank you very much. We are open for board discussion.

02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:52.060
And I wonder if I could ask Stephanie to put up the motion as it is currently framed.

02:41:53.100 --> 02:41:56.700
Member Escobedo and then Vice President Glover Woods.

02:41:58.460 --> 02:42:06.300
Yeah. I have a question on the pupil outcomes in the sense of utilizing benchmarks typically to

02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:16.780
um judge charters. Is that consistent? Because my understanding of benchmarks are used to

02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:26.700
really plan for future instruction and kind of reflect on the next quarter or semester.

02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:39.420
I'm just curious on that area and how it's being used or applied in this case.

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:45.900
Do you, I'm not sure I completely understand your question. Are you directing that to

02:42:45.900 --> 02:42:49.020
to Director Ramirez?

02:42:50.620 --> 02:43:02.540
Yes. Yes. Or in general with CDE is I'm just curious why they found substantial evidence

02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:05.340
in that area number two.

02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:09.340
Given that we don't yet have state tests available.

02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:12.540
Exactly. I think I just find it premature.

02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:16.380
Sure. May I respond?

02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:19.980
Sure. Yes. Well, I would agree with you.

02:43:20.780 --> 02:43:25.980
Board member Escobedo, I would say that you're correct. If you look at what's listed on the

02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:30.380
screen, it says identified in the charter petition, which benchmarks are not. Further,

02:43:30.380 --> 02:43:35.420
according to the LACO MOU, when they do refer to internal benchmarks, there's just a reference

02:43:35.420 --> 02:43:41.100
to submit those, which we did. And there is no timeline or deadline listed in the LACO MOU.

02:43:42.060 --> 02:43:46.860
In speaking to LACO at the time, they asked for it. They specifically, when we spoke to

02:43:46.860 --> 02:43:51.900
our coordinator and the initial discussion that was had was that we were supposed to submit,

02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:56.780
they asked us to submit it when we could, but that by July that they would like to have that.

02:43:56.780 --> 02:44:02.540
And then the timeframes changed very quickly. But ultimately, schools are supposed to be

02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:07.980
charged according to the dashboard year to year, not within one school year. So this finding to me

02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:12.860
just seems to be not in line with what was meant to happen in terms of charter schools.

02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:15.980
I'd like to respond to that a little bit.

02:44:15.980 --> 02:44:22.300
Hang on a second. Wait a minute. I'll get to you if we complete this part. Okay.

02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:28.700
Director Rivera, did you finish your statement?

02:44:31.500 --> 02:44:31.740
Yes.

02:44:31.740 --> 02:44:32.940
It seems like you're interrupted.

02:44:32.940 --> 02:44:38.780
Sorry. Yes, unless there's any other further questions to clarify.

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:47.580
Okay. So, Mr. Ciccarelli, go ahead and offer your view.

02:44:48.540 --> 02:44:54.140
Yes. So currently, you know, when we're looking at charter schools, we're always looking towards

02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:59.660
renewal. And currently under education code, one of those standards for renewal is showing

02:44:59.660 --> 02:45:05.660
year over year academic progress for all students. And the state has issued a list,

02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:12.940
CDE has issued a list of what is considered verifiable data and what are the metrics to be used

02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:21.580
for that piece of evidence. And NWEA CGI is one of the metrics that is identified. So that is

02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:28.060
something we ask all of our charter schools to have one of those identified verifiable data pieces

02:45:28.860 --> 02:45:33.740
that they are tracking in order for them to be able to make their argument for renewal.

02:45:33.740 --> 02:45:40.140
And so when we look at those scores, one, you know, it was difficult because we didn't always get,

02:45:40.140 --> 02:45:46.620
we didn't get the actual CGI, which is the approved metric by the state. But even so,

02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:53.820
looking at that NWEA data, we certainly did not see a majority of students that were meeting that

02:45:54.460 --> 02:45:56.700
standard of year over year growth.

02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:04.460
We're talking about a charter that's only been around for a year. So how could we have year over

02:46:04.460 --> 02:46:09.420
year growth? No, it's the, that's the point of the verifiable data piece. That's the point of NWEA

02:46:09.420 --> 02:46:14.940
is that it's standardized so that you can do your pre-test and your post-test and you can actually

02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:23.020
see if there was an expected growth for that time, specific time period. So we can see sort of that,

02:46:23.020 --> 02:46:30.620
you know, if it's two, if it's, excuse me, fall to spring or winter to spring, that particular

02:46:30.620 --> 02:46:35.340
growth metric is standardized for that particular time period. And you can determine whether the

02:46:35.340 --> 02:46:41.500
students actually met their expected growth or not. And that's what we looked at and saw that

02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:44.540
majority of students did not meet their expected growth for that specific-

02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:49.260
But you did have test scores for them. So the assessment was conducted.

02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:53.980
I'm going to move on to a member Glover Woods and member Olfin who have their hands up. Thank you.

02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:00.380
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. Was that for me to go?

02:47:00.380 --> 02:47:01.020
Yes, please.

02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:09.180
Thank you very much. Director Ramirez, thank you so much for sharing as you have with us. And as

02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:17.980
was indicated, the board, the State Board of Education did approve this charter even though

02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:23.740
it was recommended not to. So I think that shows kind of a vote in confidence of the merits of the

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:32.540
charter petition at the time when it was decided to move forward. And I keep that in mind as I

02:47:32.540 --> 02:47:39.660
look forward to where we are now, also recognizing we did have the pandemic and that did have an

02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:47.100
impact on all of the schools here in California. But to date, there have been two notices of concern

02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:56.460
that have been issued to the charter and those issues have not yet been rectified,

02:47:56.460 --> 02:48:03.740
which is why this item is before us today. So just to reiterate again, the notice of violation,

02:48:03.740 --> 02:48:10.940
in my lens, provides opportunity for the formal process to begin so that we can, as a board,

02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:20.540
hear more information and more of the specifics to support or refute really what those concerns

02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:29.260
are. So again, just want to reemphasize an action on this particular item is not to choose to revoke

02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:35.500
the charter, close the school, or anything along that line. It just opens the more formal process

02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:40.860
for us to receive more information related to some of the concerns that have been brought up

02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:44.620
so that we can make an informed decision moving forward.

02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:48.060
Member Olken.

02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:57.100
Thank you. And thank you, Vice President Glover-Woods, for reframing the purpose of

02:48:57.100 --> 02:49:07.340
the notice of violation because as a new board member and the leader of a district-approved

02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:14.220
charter, this is something that is not a common occurrence, so it's good to get the

02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:20.460
reiteration of the point of it. I just wanted to comment on the

02:49:22.620 --> 02:49:27.580
number two, the failed to meet or pursue any of the people outcomes identified in the charter

02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:39.740
petition. In the time since this school opened, we've all, I think, had to pivot in one way or

02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:46.300
another in terms of thinking about what the most important outcomes are for kids as they were

02:49:46.300 --> 02:49:56.380
dealing with a worldwide crisis. And I think while academic outcomes are obviously our first

02:49:58.300 --> 02:50:08.300
priority, I think they absolutely can't be our sole priority. And so I think it's important to

02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:16.300
recognize the way in which the time period of the opening of this school

02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:22.140
may have impacted certainly number two on this list and perhaps the others as well.

02:50:24.620 --> 02:50:35.660
I am most interested in understanding the financial position of the school

02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:43.420
in order to meet its obligations to its staff. And perhaps that's what this

02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:53.100
notice of violation would allow us to dig further into. But I also was interested in hearing about

02:50:53.100 --> 02:51:00.940
the revised budget based on only having 85 students because perhaps it already has been addressed.

02:51:01.740 --> 02:51:04.540
If you want to, Ramirez, did you want to respond to that?

02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:11.580
Yes, if I may. Thank you so much for the question. And yes, I would agree with President

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:16.780
Darling-Hammond in regards to the term fiscal mismanagement. I mean, when you look up fiscal

02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:24.700
mismanagement, it really is a term that relates to gross abuse and negligence. And time is not in

02:51:24.700 --> 02:51:29.980
any way engaged in that. Yes, there has been financial instability. And so what LACO has asked

02:51:30.060 --> 02:51:36.060
in the conversation from us really is this issue of low enrollment. And so they said to us what

02:51:36.060 --> 02:51:43.260
they thought the magic number was, 80 students. And so in the time that they issued the notice

02:51:43.260 --> 02:51:49.740
on June 28th, that seemed to be what they believe the magic number. So like I shared with you in

02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:57.260
my response, we currently have 72 fully registered families with another 16 in process right now that

02:51:57.260 --> 02:52:02.220
brings us to 88. In addition to the other families that we have listed that have an interest that

02:52:02.220 --> 02:52:08.780
we're continuing to pursue one month still prior to school opening. So again, they stated that

02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:14.700
they believe that we didn't have the capacity or that the projections were unreachable. And then

02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:19.100
these numbers that I'm sharing with you, that is just not the case. We are going to reach these

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:25.900
numbers. And after receiving this notice, we were instructed to start running numbers. Can you achieve

02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:32.460
a budget on 80 students? We did it on 85 because as of right now, we even look at 88, but I did

02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:39.820
it on 85. And on 85 students, time community schools is viable and we do meet the 3% reserve.

02:52:40.620 --> 02:52:46.060
So what I would say is that first, again, number one, fiscal mismanagement, I just think is a

02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:51.020
terrible mischaracterization of our school because we are so committed to our school and our community

02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:55.980
and being transparent and making sure that we make decisions that really support our programs

02:52:55.980 --> 02:53:02.540
and our staff and what we're attempting to do. So I would, again, argue that the three findings,

02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:10.540
one, two, and three simply do not apply to us. And even so, we still have addressed all of these

02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:16.540
issues to make sure that there are no concerns moving forward. So thank you again. And I'll

02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:19.340
answer any other questions if you require more clarification.

02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:25.740
Are there other questions?

02:53:30.220 --> 02:53:33.900
I have a question for our CDE staff.

02:53:38.140 --> 02:53:45.100
There are terms like fiscal mismanagement that would be understood, for example, as

02:53:46.060 --> 02:53:53.660
corruption of some sort as opposed to instability and challenges. And I wonder whether when we make

02:53:53.660 --> 02:54:02.300
the, when we are voting on the notice, whether it in fact comes with these characterizations.

02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:08.620
I also wonder about the characterization of fail to pursue any of the pupil outcomes

02:54:09.260 --> 02:54:14.460
as opposed to fail to meet. It seems frankly like overreach in the language.

02:54:15.420 --> 02:54:27.580
So that is the reasons outlined in Ed code to issue a notice of violation. So I'm not

02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:34.940
100% sure how we can change those in the resolution. So I welcome any input from

02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:38.620
from SBE general counsel

02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:44.780
on that in terms of the actual resolution language.

02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:54.140
So again, Stephanie is correct. This is what the Ed code says. And if you will recall,

02:54:55.900 --> 02:55:01.580
last winter, the board issued a notice of violation for the equal collegiate academy.

02:55:01.580 --> 02:55:06.060
And one of the allegations was also fiscal mismanagement. And that has to do with

02:55:07.020 --> 02:55:11.900
instability as Lego has laid out, the fact that they're buying on borrowing receivables,

02:55:11.900 --> 02:55:19.020
that there is some concern that staff and STRS, there's not sufficient funding to pay

02:55:19.740 --> 02:55:24.620
staff and STRS moving forward. And that is the long accepted definition of fiscal mismanagement.

02:55:25.180 --> 02:55:28.380
And this is what is in Ed code. And I'd like to reiterate what

02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:33.020
board member Glover Woods said. This is the first step in the process

02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:39.100
at the ACCS. Should the board decide to issue the notice of violation,

02:55:39.100 --> 02:55:43.020
the school will have a chance to prepare, respond, and there'll be a thorough hearing at ACCS

02:55:43.020 --> 02:55:49.020
to go over whether the response adequately respond adequately, if they adequately have a plan

02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:54.380
to respond to some of the concerns Lego has alleged. And that will be the place where the

02:55:54.380 --> 02:56:01.180
ACCS can really dive into the merits of some of these issues. But this is the first step in

02:56:01.180 --> 02:56:06.700
a formal process. And there are plenty of opportunities for them to respond moving forward.

02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:15.420
Is that also the case, Judy, with respect to statements like failed to meet or pursue

02:56:16.140 --> 02:56:21.100
any of the pupil outcomes, which makes it sound as though there's not even been an effort to

02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:26.300
educate the students, which we have not heard any evidence of that.

02:56:28.140 --> 02:56:34.060
Yes, you're correct, President Darling-Hammond. That is true, but it is an or. So again,

02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:39.980
we're issuing a notice of violation, the school will have an opportunity to respond to all of

02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:45.260
these allegations and their plan moving forward. The ACCS will deliberate on whether that plan

02:56:45.260 --> 02:56:51.180
sounds real and then that may or may and then that will come back to the board in September.

02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:57.580
I would say one thing with the timing, the pandemic is certainly cause a lot of instability in the

02:56:57.580 --> 02:57:03.500
system. But the other thing to keep in mind is when the school closes mid-year, and I'm not saying

02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:07.820
that that's something that's going to happen with this school. We certainly have no evidence of that,

02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:12.620
but one of the reasons why these often come to you in the summer is because a mid-year closure

02:57:12.620 --> 02:57:17.740
is often very difficult on the families, the students and the staff involved. So I think

02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:23.100
that's partially, I think someone had a question about the timing and it's unfortunate and it's

02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:30.380
unfortunate that the pandemic has caused enrollment problems for many schools. But again, that leads

02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:36.940
to a lot of the fiscal problems that we are hearing from LACO here. Member Olken.

02:57:36.940 --> 02:57:51.100
Thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to elevate the idea that one of the real issues that's plaguing

02:57:51.100 --> 02:58:01.660
this school seems to be student enrollment and issuing a notice of violation would probably or

02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:09.820
could potentially, try not to predict the future, could potentially exacerbate that.

02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:19.020
And so in essence, there are students who are in the process of registration. And so I just want

02:58:19.020 --> 02:58:28.220
to point out this could be a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I wonder in the public comment,

02:58:28.220 --> 02:58:33.660
there weren't any students or families speaking up. And I wonder if that's

02:58:34.940 --> 02:58:44.300
because in order to maintain a sense of stability in the school, the families don't know. I truly am

02:58:46.140 --> 02:58:50.620
thinking through the lens of what I would do as a school leader and the types of calculations

02:58:51.900 --> 02:58:57.260
I would be making. But it's striking both that we didn't hear from any students or families.

02:58:57.900 --> 02:59:03.900
And then in my mind, I have this sense of perhaps why not. Is that a question?

02:59:06.620 --> 02:59:13.180
And if so, who are you directing? Yeah. So the first part was just something to point out

02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:20.300
about the impact of enrollment on when there's stability in a school, instability in a school.

02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:23.340
And then the second, I guess, is a question for the director

02:59:24.780 --> 02:59:32.060
if his community is aware of this potential that we're discussing today.

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:45.500
Thank you for the question and for the thoughtfulness of it. Yes, I think again,

02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:51.660
in looking at number one in terms of issuing the notice, that is one of our concerns as well.

02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:57.820
We have made a lot of progress. And LACO throughout the year always is commenting

02:59:57.820 --> 03:00:03.180
on the progress that we make and our commitment, our work ethic. At one point in the last meeting,

03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:09.900
in fact, that we had with LACO, LACO described me as extraordinary. So there is an acknowledgement

03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:14.620
that we work very hard and that we're committed to the school. And so we're trying to do everything

03:00:14.620 --> 03:00:19.980
in our power to give the families the confidence that they need to enroll in our school, given the

03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:24.940
fact, too, that we are within a district that has been very challenging. And so we have all these

03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:33.100
different factors that affect us and we've been combating them all year. So with that, yes,

03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:40.460
there has been little information given to families to not give that concern that there

03:00:40.460 --> 03:00:46.780
is this huge possibility of closure. We've been very strategic in how we've shared that

03:00:46.780 --> 03:00:51.500
information and it's been more on as families have asked questions, we have provided if there

03:00:51.500 --> 03:01:01.100
were any and have just been very minimal in sharing that information. Thank you. Any other

03:01:02.060 --> 03:01:12.220
questions or comments? Seeing none, is there a motion?

03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:25.340
I think the fact that we're not receiving a motion. Oh, there we go.

03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:30.460
I don't know. They reflect some of the discomfort on the board. I don't know.

03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:39.180
And I'm wondering whether there are steps that we can take to trigger the responses that are

03:01:39.180 --> 03:01:45.980
needed from the school short of a notice of violation with the kind of language that this includes.

03:01:47.900 --> 03:01:52.540
I don't know of any, President Carling-Hammond. I don't know if you wanted me to answer that,

03:01:52.540 --> 03:01:59.580
but I don't know of any and I just want to say that this really is their opportunity to respond

03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:10.540
in a way. They've offered a lot of new information here today that was not given to CDE or LACO prior

03:02:10.540 --> 03:02:18.620
to writing of this item or posting of this item. So this is all new information that they are

03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:25.260
sharing today and so the notice of violation would give both CDE and LACO an opportunity to

03:02:25.260 --> 03:02:37.660
review it in a thoughtful way, which obviously we can't do it now. So I think this is the way

03:02:37.660 --> 03:02:45.420
for the school to show how they are going to respond to the concerns.

03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:49.260
Vice President Clover Woods?

03:02:50.860 --> 03:02:56.780
I had a question. I had a question, Director Farland, to the point that you made.

03:02:58.540 --> 03:03:06.700
Are you able or is it possible to review the new information that's been received with the

03:03:06.700 --> 03:03:13.180
new enrollments and all of the new budget and various things that Director Ramirez has shared?

03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:21.740
Is it possible to have that reviewed absent issuing a notice of violation or is a notice

03:03:21.740 --> 03:03:27.660
of violation required in order to review the new information that has been presented since

03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:29.980
the item was written?

03:03:29.980 --> 03:03:45.820
I think this is a question to Stephanie Farland. Is that right?

03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:50.700
I'm sorry. I thought she was asking. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought you were asking LACO.

03:03:50.700 --> 03:03:59.740
I apologize. Well, we certainly and LACO can review information certainly at any time,

03:03:59.740 --> 03:04:11.420
but if, for instance, we review it and it's not a cure or a remedy to all of the concerns,

03:04:11.420 --> 03:04:14.860
then we certainly have to come back and do this process all over again

03:04:16.380 --> 03:04:23.660
in order to move on to the next step. So we would have to repeat it.

03:04:25.580 --> 03:04:26.300
Thank you.

03:04:26.300 --> 03:04:32.380
Yeah, this is Judy. I'd like to add to what Stephanie said. So if the board chooses to not

03:04:32.380 --> 03:04:40.060
issue a notice of violation now, certainly we can ask that LACO continue to work with the school.

03:04:41.740 --> 03:04:45.980
Should LACO still have concerns after they review the new information the school has provided today,

03:04:47.020 --> 03:04:51.260
then it's possible they would need to come back to the board for a notice of violation in September

03:04:51.260 --> 03:04:56.940
and then that would mean that the revocation hearing would happen. In theory, if the board

03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:02.300
decided to issue a notice of violation in September, then a revocation hearing would happen in November.

03:05:05.900 --> 03:05:10.780
Member Escobedo, you had, oh, Member Glover-Woods, did you want to follow up on that before I take

03:05:10.780 --> 03:05:16.620
the next question? No, please go to Member Escobedo and then you can come back to me if no one else

03:05:16.620 --> 03:05:23.580
has their hand up. Thank you. Member Escobedo. Yeah, I was in line with Member Woods if we can

03:05:23.580 --> 03:05:33.900
just table this. If we take no action, we could obviously hear this later and I just, for me,

03:05:34.620 --> 03:05:42.540
I want to make sure this is an important decision because a notice of violation can lead to revocation

03:05:43.100 --> 03:05:54.300
and, you know, that will be, something will be, I agree with Member Olken that that could actually

03:05:54.300 --> 03:06:01.820
create a self-fulfilling prophecy as well. So I just want to make sure that before I make a decision,

03:06:02.860 --> 03:06:11.500
I have all the facts and I'm still hung up with number two. I just don't feel like I'm comfortable

03:06:11.500 --> 03:06:20.060
I'm comfortable in making this significant decision. It's more than just procedural.

03:06:21.020 --> 03:06:30.860
Member Orozco-Gonzalez. I just want to kind of bring up what one of our members, I think it was

03:06:32.860 --> 03:06:37.180
Ms. Olken, brought up. I'm concerned that we didn't hear from the community,

03:06:37.820 --> 03:06:43.740
from the students of the school. I would have liked to have heard from the students who attend

03:06:45.100 --> 03:06:51.580
Time Charter and to see how the school impacts them, maybe from the teachers. And

03:06:52.940 --> 03:06:58.300
for me, that would have made an impact. But otherwise, since they didn't have anyone from

03:06:58.300 --> 03:07:02.300
the community, then I feel like the investment is not fully there.

03:07:02.300 --> 03:07:10.460
Yeah, I think we heard that they are not necessarily aware of this action.

03:07:10.460 --> 03:07:14.620
Yeah, and that's what concerns me because I feel that one of the biggest things that I think that

03:07:14.620 --> 03:07:21.260
school districts do is they really encompass the community. You know, we build bridges,

03:07:21.260 --> 03:07:26.780
we build partnerships, and we invest in our communities. And I would like to have heard

03:07:26.780 --> 03:07:33.260
from the teachers who are invested, the parents, and the students because this impacts them also.

03:07:34.140 --> 03:07:42.060
And their voice is vital. And it's an awkward process because this is not the place where that

03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:47.660
is set up to happen. At the point at which that would happen, it would be at a hearing

03:07:47.660 --> 03:07:53.740
about the revocation, at which point it begins to feel like it's, you know, way down the road.

03:07:53.740 --> 03:07:59.340
So we are, you know, again, it's a procedural challenge that we are facing.

03:08:00.380 --> 03:08:03.740
Member Glover Woods, and then what member Lewis is also?

03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:07.740
Go ahead, member Glover Woods, do you want to?

03:08:09.260 --> 03:08:18.460
I do. I just want to say I definitely concur with the feeling of many of my fellow members on the

03:08:18.460 --> 03:08:26.140
board. This is a very difficult, difficult decision. And I too would have wanted to hear

03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:33.180
a bit more from those who are vested in the school, either in written correspondence or

03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:42.300
during public comment today. And absent that, it's a little difficult. One thing that continues

03:08:42.300 --> 03:08:47.500
to weigh on me is the fact that there have been two notices of concern that have already

03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:56.940
been issued and apparently have not been resolved to the desire of the county office.

03:08:57.500 --> 03:09:05.260
And that is why this is before us today. I definitely understand how issuing a notice of

03:09:05.260 --> 03:09:12.540
violation can impact the registrations that are currently in place for the charter and that are

03:09:12.540 --> 03:09:19.980
desperately needed for the charter. I'm just not sure that weighs or outweighs, if you will,

03:09:22.140 --> 03:09:30.300
the implication of not issuing a notice of violation today and hoping that this time around,

03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:36.300
the third time around, that the areas of concern would be resolved so that this is not before us

03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:43.820
again later in the school year where we would need to take action on issuing a notice of violation.

03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:48.700
And if we do and things are not resolved, moving forward with a revocation. So I just,

03:09:49.980 --> 03:09:56.940
again, understand for myself just the quandary, if you will, in making this decision.

03:09:57.820 --> 03:10:04.620
I do feel, however, that probably the best way to try to bring this to resolution and hopefully

03:10:04.620 --> 03:10:09.820
resolution in benefit of the charter itself is to move forward with the notice of violation

03:10:10.460 --> 03:10:15.580
so that we can get resolution to the concerns that have been brought forward.

03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:22.380
And one last thing I will say, the language in Ed code is quite unfortunate that because it does,

03:10:22.380 --> 03:10:27.020
I do believe, send a message, but I also understand that if that's the way the Ed

03:10:27.020 --> 03:10:32.380
code is written, we have to adhere to that particular language as we move forward.

03:10:37.180 --> 03:10:40.700
I saw a hand from Member Lewis.

03:10:41.980 --> 03:10:47.740
President Darlin-Hammond, I apologize, but I do not have the icon at the bottom to raise my hand.

03:10:47.740 --> 03:10:53.340
I don't know what happened. Sometimes it does seem to show up.

03:10:54.140 --> 03:10:57.020
And I looked in the apps. I can't find it in the apps.

03:10:57.020 --> 03:10:59.260
No worries. I apologize for that.

03:10:59.260 --> 03:11:08.220
But I agree with everything that has been said by my fellow board members about how difficult this

03:11:08.220 --> 03:11:14.140
is, especially hearing from Mr. Ramirez. And he's very heartfelt. He's very sincere

03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:19.340
about all of the efforts that they are making to keep the school open and to provide the

03:11:19.340 --> 03:11:26.460
opportunity for students. But I've been listening and I'm trying to think of, you know, what would

03:11:26.460 --> 03:11:37.180
be a reason, a really valid reason not to move forward with issuing the notice of violation,

03:11:37.180 --> 03:11:42.620
other than what I've heard about that it could impact the number of parents and students who

03:11:42.620 --> 03:11:50.220
decide to go to the school. Well, it could also, if they have 200 names of students who have

03:11:51.980 --> 03:11:58.140
expressed interest in being a part of the school and 72 that are committed with another 16 in

03:11:58.140 --> 03:12:03.580
progress, it may also do the opposite. It may actually motivate those parents to know that,

03:12:03.580 --> 03:12:08.060
hey, if we really want to be a part of this innovative school and we want to be a part of

03:12:08.140 --> 03:12:14.060
keeping it open, then we have to move and act on our enrollment. And then there's no guarantee

03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:21.100
if we don't move forward with this, that all of those parents will and students will step forward

03:12:21.100 --> 03:12:25.660
and the enrollment will be at the magic number it needs to be to make the budget work and

03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:33.500
the school can move forward. I too have concerns about the other two notices that were issued.

03:12:33.500 --> 03:12:39.580
And then there wasn't an appropriate or an acceptable response to those. So I do believe

03:12:39.580 --> 03:12:46.860
that this is the opportunity, you know, with the notice of violation for the school to just

03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:51.180
continue to work as hard as they're working the staff to get the students and the parents on board

03:12:51.180 --> 03:12:56.060
to be a part of the school. And which is I hope that that's what really that happens and that

03:12:56.060 --> 03:13:02.860
they're able to move forward. And then in August, when the ACCS reviews things that everything is

03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:07.740
in a good place and the school can move forward for the year. But I really think there's a benefit

03:13:07.740 --> 03:13:15.820
to both to the school and to all those concerned to issue the notice and get the proof on the table

03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:19.900
and all of the resources and things that are needed to make the school move forward.

03:13:19.900 --> 03:13:29.820
So that's it. Appreciate that. I see another, I see Member Glover Woods raising her hand.

03:13:30.780 --> 03:13:36.940
I'll just note that what I think all of the logic around getting the

03:13:36.940 --> 03:13:43.100
answers to the questions clearly on the table is good logic. I think I heard Stephanie say that

03:13:43.100 --> 03:13:48.700
that could be done in any event. Concerns here about whether there might be a mid-year closing.

03:13:48.700 --> 03:13:55.900
I am continue to be troubled by the language of the notice, which I think is not accurate to the

03:13:55.900 --> 03:14:03.820
work of the school around pursuing academic achievement and engaging in fiscal mismanagement.

03:14:03.820 --> 03:14:07.420
So I will just leave that. Member Olken?

03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:14.300
Thank you for calling me. But I think you had already said you were going to

03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:22.380
go with Vice President Glover Woods next. Or was that a no? Sorry, I just don't want to jump.

03:14:22.380 --> 03:14:24.940
No, go ahead. Yeah, Vice President Glover Woods, go ahead.

03:14:25.900 --> 03:14:31.900
President Darling-Hammond, I can defer to Member Olken for her comment first.

03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:40.540
Thank you. I just wanted to comment on the language one more time that you just mentioned,

03:14:40.540 --> 03:14:47.500
President Darling-Hammond. Your question about whether it could be changed,

03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:54.620
and the answer was it can't be, because those are the reasons in Ed code that we would issue

03:14:55.580 --> 03:15:05.020
a notice of violation is troubling to me, because it's important to me. Because if

03:15:06.140 --> 03:15:14.460
what we think is those words aren't the right ones, we can't change them because we don't have the

03:15:14.460 --> 03:15:23.500
right to issue a notice of violation if those things aren't met. And so just your questioning

03:15:23.500 --> 03:15:33.900
around the language and what it means is, I think, is important. I just wanted to reiterate

03:15:33.900 --> 03:15:41.580
that. Thank you. All right. I think Member Glover Woods, the ball is in your court.

03:15:43.420 --> 03:15:48.140
Okay. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. I'd like to move forward with the motion

03:15:48.220 --> 03:15:53.980
on this item, please, and I do move that we issue a notice of violation

03:15:54.860 --> 03:16:02.620
and pursuant to the Ed code that is cited in the item. Thank you. And is there a second?

03:16:05.100 --> 03:16:13.340
I second it. Thank you. Any further discussion of the item? Brooks will call a roll call vote.

03:16:13.340 --> 03:16:16.700
Okay. Member Bonacca.

03:16:18.540 --> 03:16:20.780
Aye. President Darling-Hammond.

03:16:22.460 --> 03:16:24.860
Nay. Member Escobedo.

03:16:26.060 --> 03:16:28.620
Nay. Vice President Glover Woods.

03:16:30.380 --> 03:16:32.380
Yes. Member Lewis.

03:16:33.740 --> 03:16:36.060
Yes. Member McQuillan.

03:16:37.740 --> 03:16:40.140
Nay. Member Olken.

03:16:40.140 --> 03:16:45.580
Nay. Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

03:16:47.260 --> 03:16:49.980
Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson.

03:16:51.340 --> 03:16:54.380
Yes. Member Rodriguez.

03:16:57.500 --> 03:16:59.980
I think she might have had to have left for her flight.

03:16:59.980 --> 03:17:07.020
So the motion carries.

03:17:08.620 --> 03:17:14.060
All right. Thank you all for a very intensive board meeting.

03:17:19.420 --> 03:17:24.940
Executive Director Allen, do we have six aye votes? We need six aye votes for a motion to carry

03:17:25.020 --> 03:17:27.260
pursuant to Ed code. No, we have five.

03:17:29.340 --> 03:17:34.300
Motion fails. So then the board has taken no action. Unless someone wants to reconsider

03:17:34.300 --> 03:17:40.620
the motion, that results in no action by the board. Thank you. All right. Then the board has

03:17:40.620 --> 03:17:51.340
taken no action. Thank you for the very intense and deep board meeting. Thank you all for your

03:17:52.300 --> 03:17:59.820
very determined participation. And I hereby adjourn our July 2022 State Board of Education

03:17:59.820 --> 03:18:04.860
meeting at 1249 p.m. I look forward to seeing you in September.

03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:10.620
Thanks, everybody.
