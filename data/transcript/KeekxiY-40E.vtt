WEBVTT

00:05.106 --> 00:06.946
Yeah, let's go and then we have to adjourn the room.

00:07.507 --> 00:16.191
So the State Board will reconvene and we will be adjourning, not adjourning, but having a closed session.

00:16.831 --> 00:21.834
So we will consider during the closed session

00:22.794 --> 00:33.698
The demand letter received from Morrison, Forrester and public advocates regarding early literacy in Stockton Unified School District and Los Angeles Unified School District.

00:34.098 --> 00:38.399
So we need to clear the room of the audience because we're going into closed session.

00:47.303 --> 00:47.563
Item 18.

00:49.554 --> 00:55.237
Michelle Center will present for the Department of English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

00:55.257 --> 01:06.743
Good morning.

01:07.784 --> 01:12.166
President Kirst, Bossman, Carrick-Ashley, members of the board.

01:13.871 --> 01:16.513
Michelle Center, Director of the Assessment Division.

01:17.254 --> 01:18.955
I'm here today to talk about item 18.

01:19.015 --> 01:20.657
This is an action item before you.

01:21.657 --> 01:25.320
I will be having a PowerPoint to go through the actions that are in front of you.

01:25.981 --> 01:30.404
We're going to ask the board for three different actions.

01:30.464 --> 01:35.549
The first are revisions to the summit of assessment test blueprints for the LPAC.

01:36.721 --> 01:41.612
The next is the reporting hierarchy of the LPAC summative assessment and initial assessment.

01:42.454 --> 01:45.380
And lastly, revisions to the general performance level descriptors.

01:45.681 --> 01:47.425
So those are the three things before you today.

01:53.683 --> 02:02.611
First, we request approval for revisions to the summative assessment test blueprint.

02:03.071 --> 02:10.398
So as a reminder, a blueprint details the number of items and the points for each task type and content standard.

02:11.138 --> 02:14.521
This is for the operational test that begins in fall 2018.

02:16.906 --> 02:20.488
The SBE approved the original blueprints in November of 2015.

02:21.248 --> 02:30.812
And the CDE is now recommending revisions based on stakeholder input and the field test of the summative assessment that has occurred.

02:32.580 --> 02:37.143
The proposed revisions fit into a few different categories.

02:37.903 --> 02:47.389
The first are revisions to address administration concerns, which resulted in the elimination of task types that did not really reflect authentic scenarios.

02:48.550 --> 02:54.094
The next are revisions to ensure appropriate rigor were also made to the blueprint.

02:54.475 --> 03:02.561
This change ensured that the appropriate number of items were included for various task types to address the full continuum of performance.

03:03.914 --> 03:07.835
Lastly, revisions were made to address the performance of various task types.

03:08.296 --> 03:13.777
This resulted in the realignment of some task types and the elimination of others.

03:14.898 --> 03:27.182
Specific examples of these revisions are included in the item as well as a mocked up version of the blueprint that clearly identifies where we are recommending changes.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.844
The next action before the board addresses the reporting hierarchy.

03:33.894 --> 03:39.176
Before I share the reporting hierarchy recommendations with you, I want to share our approach for its development.

03:40.176 --> 03:48.259
As we thought about how to report the results, we considered how the new ELD standards integrate listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.

03:49.239 --> 03:58.783
We also wanted to ensure the technical quality of the test and the reliability and validity of the information given to parents, teachers, schools, and districts.

04:00.034 --> 04:11.077
To address questions of reporting, the CDE did ask its contractor, ETS, who is here with me to answer tough questions, to conduct what is called a dimensionality study on the field test results.

04:12.177 --> 04:22.520
The study was designed to investigate which domains could be combined into a scale score that would provide useful and technically sound information.

04:26.598 --> 04:36.544
Based on the results of that study, we are proposing reporting hierarchies for the summative assessment and initial assessment, and those are shown in slides six and seven.

04:37.839 --> 04:43.582
At the top level for the summative assessment reporting hierarchy, you will see an overall scale score.

04:44.483 --> 04:53.828
That is a composite scale score of the oral and written language subscales and will be mapped onto both or all four of the performance levels.

04:54.528 --> 05:03.253
So you'll notice in that top box, you see overall scale score, scale score, a number, as well as under that for performance levels, 1, 2, 3, 4.

05:06.653 --> 05:11.135
The overall score is based on all test items across the four domains in the LPAC.

05:12.416 --> 05:15.838
Next, the oral and written subscales are under that.

05:15.878 --> 05:20.220
You'll see that as oral language scale score, written language scale score.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.622
Each of these are mapped onto the four levels.

05:25.011 --> 05:25.891
You'll see that under there, 1, 2, 3, 4.

05:27.132 --> 05:28.472
You also see the word score.

05:28.872 --> 05:29.673
Again, that's a number.

05:30.593 --> 05:35.455
The last row of the hierarchy will be the domain levels of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

05:36.175 --> 05:40.177
They'll be mapped to three performance levels, but no scores provided.

05:40.597 --> 05:51.381
As you can imagine, those being at the bottom level have fewer test items associated with them, therefore less precision, and so we are recommending three levels and no score.

05:52.501 --> 05:59.503
This proposed reporting hierarchy is an enhancement over the CELT because it provides three scores.

06:00.003 --> 06:07.406
Imagine this overall score, this oral score, and the written score that can be used to look at progress longitudinally.

06:10.306 --> 06:16.768
Next on slide seven is the reporting hierarchy for the initial assessment that begins July 2018.

06:19.378 --> 06:25.647
As a reminder, the summative assessment measures student progress annually and is used for accountability.

06:26.368 --> 06:35.080
Whereas the initial assessment is a screener to identify students who are either initially fluent English proficient or English learners.

06:36.301 --> 06:41.945
As with the first hierarchy, the overall score is a composite of the two measures below it.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.827
Again, oral language and written language.

06:45.888 --> 06:50.191
The overall score will produce a scale score and be mapped onto three performance levels.

06:51.612 --> 06:54.314
Again, this is a shorter assessment than the summative.

06:55.275 --> 06:58.797
All test items on the initial are included in the overall score.

07:00.579 --> 07:05.002
At the second level, we are anticipating three oral language and written level

07:06.673 --> 07:08.054
written language performance levels.

07:09.095 --> 07:13.137
At the third level is the number of items in each domain is relatively small.

07:13.858 --> 07:17.760
There will be no scores or levels produced for the individual domains.

07:21.102 --> 07:28.967
Finally, the last portion of this action before you today is proposing revisions to the general performance level descriptors.

07:29.548 --> 07:30.648
I have examples of those.

07:31.609 --> 07:34.211
I have those changes in slides eight and slides nine.

07:35.694 --> 07:41.436
So in January 2016, you approved the LPAC general performance level descriptors.

07:42.336 --> 07:58.482
Based on discussions with California stakeholders, as well as to reflect the field test dimensionality study and the reporting hierarchy that I just described to you, the CDE is proposing revisions to all the levels as shown in the red italics on the slides before you.

08:00.218 --> 08:05.061
In general, what we're doing is replacing the word functional with developed based on stakeholder input.

08:06.022 --> 08:11.625
We replaced receptive and productive with oral and written based on the results of the dimensionality study.

08:12.725 --> 08:24.212
We also added a reference based on the request of stakeholders to the 2012 ELD performance levels, bridging, expanding, and emerging, that correspond to each performance level descriptor.

08:27.674 --> 08:40.926
The CDE will provide an October information memorandum to you that details the summative assessment standard setting plan, as well as the threshold validation study that UTS plans to conduct.

08:41.807 --> 08:49.914
Additionally, in October of this year, we will be conducting a standard setting of the summative assessment with educators throughout California.

08:50.993 --> 08:58.498
In November, we plan to bring the preliminary proposed threshold scores for the summative assessment to you for approval.

08:59.418 --> 09:08.263
And in early 2018, we plan to present revised initial assessment test blueprints, if necessary, to you for approval.

09:08.284 --> 09:14.567
And make sure that's all, yep, that is all the slides.

09:14.627 --> 09:17.189
So I'm available to answer questions.

09:17.809 --> 09:18.870
Okay, questions?

09:19.871 --> 09:20.531
Board Member Rucker?

09:22.799 --> 09:25.320
Michelle, first of all, thank you for doing this work.

09:25.380 --> 09:33.405
It's really important and technical stuff and people's eyes tend to glaze over because that's not all, you know, that's not the stuff that makes the headlines.

09:33.905 --> 09:35.406
But I do have a question.

09:35.426 --> 09:39.628
So I appreciate the technical work that's required to do this.

09:40.048 --> 09:42.870
I do have a question on the revision.

09:43.730 --> 09:48.814
on the general prescription level description, PLDs.

09:48.974 --> 09:49.474
There we go.

09:50.055 --> 10:05.166
If you could take a look at level four and I'm looking at the last sentence, it says that this test performance level corresponds to the upper range of the bridging proficiency level.

10:05.586 --> 10:06.667
Okay, I was okay with that.

10:07.187 --> 10:11.671
Then when you go to level three, I get confused because there seems to be some overlap

10:12.130 --> 10:13.791
between level three and level four.

10:14.291 --> 10:28.855
It says in that last sentence, this test performance level corresponds to the lower range of the bridging proficiency level through the upper range of the expanding proficiency level.

10:29.515 --> 10:31.436
Okay, I don't understand that.

10:32.642 --> 10:41.007
So as I was thinking about this PowerPoint, there is a particular page within the standards that I probably should have included in here.

10:41.027 --> 10:58.478
It's page 20 of the ELD standards, which gives information about when this transition occurs for students and when they are needing less support to develop their language skills.

10:59.379 --> 10:59.559
And

11:01.092 --> 11:04.894
You know, I took special note of that because ELD is not my area.

11:05.114 --> 11:06.494
Looking to Veronica and it's hers.

11:07.495 --> 11:10.576
Because it is in that range difference.

11:10.616 --> 11:12.637
It is not set at a particular level.

11:12.697 --> 11:14.218
And so I believe that is accurate.

11:14.478 --> 11:15.378
Looking to Veronica.

11:16.879 --> 11:18.560
I did go and read that section.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.401
I did go back and read page 20.

11:20.741 --> 11:23.102
The reason why I'm bringing up this is because

11:23.882 --> 11:42.261
I think there's another sentence that's needed in level three to describe that point because I'm not sure that that... I know that you're trying to keep the PLTs uniform and parallel and how they explain what the difference in the definition of the performance is.

11:42.742 --> 11:45.585
But I actually think there's another sentence needed

11:46.165 --> 11:59.397
in the descriptor for level three to explain that particular point about how teachers would based on students who identified at this level, how you make decisions about intervention or instructional support.

11:59.817 --> 12:05.222
Because the way this is written, it doesn't give that clarity or that clarification.

12:07.256 --> 12:14.323
So maybe I should also clarify what we will be using these for and I think that might be helpful.

12:15.243 --> 12:19.868
So these general performance level descriptors are not reporting descriptors.

12:20.668 --> 12:26.153
So these will be used when we go forth and do additional work that goes on beyond this.

12:26.253 --> 12:29.697
So when we develop reporting descriptors which are

12:31.178 --> 12:35.760
parent friendly descriptions of what the levels mean.

12:35.920 --> 12:42.823
They will be based on this information, but we will not be including what is almost a paragraph as you see here.

12:43.403 --> 12:46.605
We also use this information with the standard setting panel.

12:46.725 --> 12:52.928
So, this should represent the policy information that this board agrees is appropriate for the levels.

12:52.988 --> 12:55.229
So, we provide that information to the standard setting.

12:56.309 --> 12:56.649
panel.

12:57.470 --> 13:05.936
Additional places where it may be used is if we do different manuals or guidance that we would be providing to educators about the meaning.

13:06.597 --> 13:14.923
But in essence, this is not what you would see on a report that is meant for parents and their understanding.

13:15.463 --> 13:16.684
Does that help or make it worse?

13:16.884 --> 13:17.685
It makes it worse.

13:18.225 --> 13:20.187
Let me tell you why it makes it worse.

13:20.247 --> 13:25.551
Having sat in the back of the room and observed a standard setting panel, a great deal of time

13:25.951 --> 13:40.975
was spent by the teachers, the parents, and other stakeholders who are in that room as participants in that standard setting, parsing out the meaning of those performance level descriptors.

13:41.455 --> 13:54.359
So a teacher of students of English learners may understand what the bridging and expanding proficiency level is, but the way this descriptor is written will take a lot of time

13:54.719 --> 14:00.022
to explain and talk to parents and other stakeholders who are not educators.

14:00.362 --> 14:09.127
And unless you plan to walk them through page 20 and walk them through how page 20 informs the instructional decisions that teachers make,

14:09.887 --> 14:16.728
This description is going to create some confusion in that room when those standard setting activities are going on.

14:17.088 --> 14:27.630
So I still say another sentence is needed in Level 3 to help explain what that seeming overlap actually means.

14:31.931 --> 14:35.271
Okay, seems like we have agreement.

14:36.332 --> 14:38.652
Do our liaisons on this want to comment at all?

14:40.489 --> 14:49.316
No, I think this test has been quite a few years in the making and it's very exciting to see that we're at this phase and we're about to do the launch.

14:49.797 --> 14:57.002
I think it may be helpful to reiterate when this is actually, when we have the pilot, when this will become in effect.

14:57.322 --> 15:06.910
And then in the interim, what we might, so that we're kind of clear when this is actually going to come, when this is actually going to become in effect.

15:08.274 --> 15:17.762
So, I mean, I think I did provide the dates for when the test becomes operational and when we come back to you with the standard setting.

15:18.083 --> 15:30.974
I think that what you're asking for, and though this isn't how you worded the question, is information on what districts should be using for decision making that could be occurring during that year.

15:31.774 --> 15:39.340
And so I would ask that, you know, Veronica, who is over our English Learner Policy Division, respond to that question.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.098
Good morning.

15:46.498 --> 15:47.519
My name is Veronica Aguilar.

15:47.539 --> 15:49.900
I'm the director of the English Learning Support Division.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.722
In terms of currently, we send guidance to the field.

15:55.162 --> 16:01.064
As you know, the bill that was going through the legislature did not get passed, so it became a two-year bill.

16:01.484 --> 16:03.045
So the law has not changed.

16:03.325 --> 16:08.247
Education code has not changed in terms of reclassification and what we can use for placement.

16:09.327 --> 16:14.308
So the short answer is we're still, we have to wait till the standard setting occurs.

16:14.648 --> 16:16.569
We have to wait till the legislation passes.

16:17.229 --> 16:27.131
We are working with the Comprehensive Center and we are engaged in that work in terms of once the standard setting occurs, we'll be looking at reclassification criteria.

16:28.212 --> 16:28.572
Thank you.

16:28.812 --> 16:32.513
So how does this affect our ability to, in our dashboard,

16:34.164 --> 16:39.306
report what we need to report on English language proficiency and so on.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.766
What's the timing on that?

16:42.367 --> 16:46.608
And classification, I guess that isn't formally on the dashboard or?

16:47.848 --> 16:48.129
No.

16:48.189 --> 16:48.609
Yeah.

16:48.669 --> 16:49.629
So, okay.

16:49.649 --> 16:54.211
It doesn't affect that, but... No, it shouldn't affect the dashboard at all.

16:54.871 --> 16:55.211
We have

16:58.558 --> 17:05.925
There'll be a status for one year, but other than that, everything will remain the same.

17:06.506 --> 17:06.846
Okay.

17:07.407 --> 17:08.708
We'll have a smooth transition.

17:09.148 --> 17:09.348
Yes.

17:13.953 --> 17:15.234
Any other board member questions?

17:16.115 --> 17:16.976
Board member Valdez.

17:19.372 --> 17:35.059
Just a comment, thank you for all of the work and this is an exciting moment and as a practitioner looking and being able to look at the blueprints and get ideas and understand where we're going I think is going to be very, very helpful and everyone is excited and anticipating this.

17:35.099 --> 17:45.164
It's just the transition and so the clear communication from this level, I know this is a little more technical, but as you move forward that would be very, very helpful.

17:45.244 --> 17:45.724
So thank you.

17:46.044 --> 17:46.384
Thank you.

17:47.685 --> 17:49.046
President Kurtz, can I make a correction?

17:49.927 --> 17:54.850
So what was in the PowerPoint, I didn't quite get the correction that we already have in your item.

17:54.930 --> 18:03.436
So if you look in your item on attachment three, you do see a slight reordering of that statement related to level three member record.

18:04.076 --> 18:11.501
So it says the test performance level corresponds to the upper range of expanding proficiency through the lower range of bridging.

18:11.541 --> 18:12.402
So we reverse the order.

18:12.442 --> 18:14.423
So I want to we did catch that.

18:14.503 --> 18:15.864
I didn't realize we didn't get it in the slide.

18:17.385 --> 18:19.828
Okay, thank you.

18:20.128 --> 18:21.850
All right, I think we need an action here.

18:21.870 --> 18:23.712
I need a motion.

18:23.732 --> 18:25.473
So I will move.

18:28.777 --> 18:29.658
Oh, public comment.

18:32.701 --> 18:35.243
Would the following people please line up for item 8?

18:36.004 --> 18:37.886
Doug McRae and Martha Diaz.

18:46.253 --> 18:49.935
Good morning, I'm Doug McRae, retired test guy from Monterey.

18:50.916 --> 19:02.242
The three revisions for the LPAC test development plan outlined this morning are unusual for a large scale K-12 testing program at this stage of development.

19:03.022 --> 19:09.950
But fundamentally, they are okay to match the results of the field test that was conducted spring 2017.

19:10.831 --> 19:20.401
However, the next steps to use the field test data to conduct standard setting is a visibly poor educational measurement practice.

19:21.562 --> 19:34.886
Test development field tests are not designed to provide interpretable individual student results, nor are they designed to provide comparable item-to-item data required for standard setting or identification of cut scores.

19:35.406 --> 19:40.088
Rather, standard setting should take place on the census operational data collected spring 2018

19:41.668 --> 19:43.429
to allow for reporting fall 2018.

19:44.790 --> 19:52.175
I'd be happy to answer any questions on this important standard-setting aspect of the project.

19:53.556 --> 19:53.876
Thank you.

20:00.518 --> 20:06.725
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

20:07.266 --> 20:17.137
And I concur with member Rucker's comments about when you first look at what's presented, it's very technical and it's like, ah, you know, what are we trying to do here?

20:17.938 --> 20:27.711
But we have had several conversations with CDE staff, especially on the performance level descriptors, because we did have some concerns.

20:28.492 --> 20:32.618
We appreciate the number of opportunities given to us to really have a very

20:33.735 --> 20:37.757
comprehensive conversation around the PLDS.

20:38.897 --> 20:48.642
We are pleased to see the revisions and we support the revisions that are proposed in this item, but in particular to the PLDS.

20:49.262 --> 21:06.709
We think that the revisions really establish a clear link regarding the PLDs to the ELD standards that will help teachers better understand the LPAC and to enable them to better use the LPAC.

21:06.829 --> 21:11.131
So we support this item and we would request a yes vote by the members.

21:11.451 --> 21:11.771
Thank you.

21:13.352 --> 21:15.152
Okay, that concludes the public comment.

21:15.412 --> 21:16.833
So I think we're ready for a motion.

21:17.958 --> 21:36.549
So I will move CDE's recommendation that to approve the proposed revisions to the standards, sorry, the summative assessment test blueprints for the LPAC and the revised general PLDs and the reporting hierarchy of the LPAC essays and IA score reports.

21:36.569 --> 21:39.450
For second?

21:40.491 --> 21:40.731
Second.

21:41.231 --> 21:41.992
Second holiday.

21:42.864 --> 21:43.204
All right.

21:43.704 --> 21:45.065
All those in favor, raise your hands.

21:45.866 --> 21:46.646
That's unanimous.

21:47.807 --> 21:47.987
All right.

21:48.047 --> 21:49.708
Now we're going to turn to charters.

21:49.788 --> 21:59.433
But before we do, I'd like to recognize the contributions of Cindy Chan as the director of the Charter Schools Division since 2015.

22:01.414 --> 22:07.517
She has worked in that division at CDE for more than 14 years and is now going to retire.

22:09.219 --> 22:12.741
And I don't know anybody on the board that doesn't miss her or won't miss her.

22:14.122 --> 22:19.044
In particular, in addition to your fine technical analysis and clear explanations.

22:20.014 --> 22:21.915
You have such a calming influence.

22:22.415 --> 22:25.376
You never get rattled.

22:26.417 --> 22:29.238
Things get a little tense, and you're always calm.

22:30.558 --> 22:35.380
So we also will miss the affect, which will be hard to duplicate.

22:35.400 --> 22:39.082
So thank you so much for your service, and we look forward to a happy return.

22:44.719 --> 22:48.424
So, item 19 is a public hearing.

22:49.245 --> 22:52.849
So, Cindy will present and then I'll open the public hearing.

22:55.279 --> 22:58.362
Oh, Bruce wants to make a few comments.

22:58.843 --> 23:01.966
I just wanted to add to Dr. Coors' comment.

23:02.526 --> 23:11.034
I speak for member Williams and myself in thanking you, Cindy, for all the help and all the guidance that you've given us over the years.

23:12.356 --> 23:16.980
It has been a pleasure working with you because not only are you calm, but you're very smart.

23:17.461 --> 23:19.683
And the combination is wonderful.

23:20.163 --> 23:24.168
Thank you, and I don't know if Member Williams could be here, she would agree wholeheartedly.

23:24.349 --> 23:25.230
Thanks for all you've done.

23:26.494 --> 23:32.038
And Deputy Superintendent Kerrick Ashley would like to comment on behalf of Tom Torlakson.

23:32.238 --> 23:43.947
Yes, the superintendent is dismayed that he can't be here for your last board meeting, but he wanted to make sure that I expressed his appreciation, the department's appreciation for the work.

23:44.407 --> 23:51.092
Not only smart and competent and calm, but we'll miss you just because you're a good person.

23:51.852 --> 23:53.673
And it's always a pleasure to work with you.

23:53.694 --> 23:54.234
So thank you.

23:54.909 --> 23:55.289
Thank you.

23:55.349 --> 24:01.934
So just real briefly, I'll just say, I don't know if a lot of you know my background, but it's mainly of my 30 years in the state.

24:02.514 --> 24:04.435
It is predominantly fiscal.

24:04.715 --> 24:10.039
So in auditing, accounting, budgets, apportionments, funding formulas.

24:10.099 --> 24:21.006
But the reason why I was interested in this position, believe it or not, one of the things on my bucket list was I wanted to prepare at least present one or two items to the state board.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.046
Oh yeah.

24:25.385 --> 24:26.586
Well, you got your wish.

24:26.766 --> 24:27.667
I got my wish.

24:28.088 --> 24:36.395
So, I mean, with that, you know, I thank the CDE executive team, especially Nick Schweitzer, who's my deputy.

24:36.475 --> 24:49.547
He's been very supportive as well as the other leadership within the department and the superintendent, the chief deputies, the deputies, as well as other divisions, my division staff, which is just wonderful.

24:49.628 --> 24:49.868
And then

24:50.468 --> 24:57.594
Just all of you, Karen, staff, Walter's office, I think I work with Karen's staff more than anyone because of all the items.

24:57.674 --> 25:00.937
And we have a really great working relationship with the staff.

25:00.997 --> 25:04.059
So it really makes everything so much easier.

25:04.139 --> 25:07.162
And I just want to just say thank you for it.

25:07.302 --> 25:12.026
There's three board liaisons that I work with closely on the charter items.

25:12.746 --> 25:20.231
Board Member Rucker on the charter waivers, and then Board Member Holladay and Board Member Williams, if she's watching out there.

25:20.251 --> 25:27.777
And the support that the three of you provide when I'm up here, I mean, these items are so difficult.

25:28.577 --> 25:36.264
But it's something really small as much as, you know, the eye contact we make, a nod or a smile.

25:36.344 --> 25:51.316
It really helps to, I mean, I think move things along and I feel that support and I feel like they bail me out sometimes when I'm just not certain I'm getting a point across and they understand what I'm trying to say and then they articulate that because they know you all so well.

25:51.396 --> 25:52.998
So I want to thank you especially.

25:54.159 --> 26:01.588
It's been an honor and a privilege to be able to stand up here and present the items on behalf of the department and the charter school community.

26:02.288 --> 26:04.411
And I'm really going to, I'm going to miss the work.

26:04.611 --> 26:07.354
So thank you all so much.

26:10.817 --> 26:17.983
Cindy, I just have to tell you, not just because you're smart and not just because you're patient, you're actually a very good tutor.

26:18.504 --> 26:36.700
I have learned so much from you, not only about the regulatory process and the board's responsibilities and obligations for monitoring and overseeing charters, but the great demand on not only your expertise, but on the work that you do as a representative for the board and for the department

26:37.260 --> 26:41.962
in having these conversations with a lot of stakeholders in the charter community.

26:42.463 --> 26:53.708
It's been probably the greatest collaboration that I've been able to witness that we have grown both in dimension and aspect in the relationship with the charter community.

26:54.048 --> 27:00.972
And a lot of that has been because you have been a very good leader in this conversation and in this policy area.

27:01.012 --> 27:03.553
So I really personally will miss you a great deal.

27:07.388 --> 27:08.768
All right, I guess you may begin.

27:09.189 --> 27:25.733
Okay, so I'm going to take just a brief moment and I think it's on behalf of our new member and just for all of you as my last kind of meeting just to present a little bit, just a little bit of background information on the types of charter school petition items that come before you.

27:26.073 --> 27:30.075
And then it sort of serves as a segue into the three items that I'll be presenting this morning.

27:31.995 --> 27:36.096
So there's four types of charter items that the state board can take action on.

27:36.116 --> 27:38.216
And I'm going to kind of categorize them.

27:38.256 --> 27:39.917
There are new charter establishments.

27:40.677 --> 27:43.077
And in these cases, there's three types.

27:43.257 --> 27:50.559
There's appeals that are denial by a local entity, a school district, county board of education, where it's denied.

27:50.599 --> 27:53.419
And so the charter petitioner appeals to the state board.

27:53.559 --> 28:00.921
Currently, we have 15 state board of education authorized charter schools that were appeals by a local entity.

28:01.961 --> 28:04.965
Another type of charter establishment is a statewide benefit charter.

28:05.145 --> 28:08.168
We haven't had any that I've been able to present to you other than a renewal.

28:08.228 --> 28:14.295
We currently have one statewide benefit charter, high-tech, that operates six individual charter schools.

28:14.956 --> 28:20.542
And then a district-wide charter, which may be coming at some point in the near future.

28:21.062 --> 28:34.809
in which an existing school district converts all of its charter schools to a charter school and so they submit a district-wide petition for joint approval by the state superintendent of public instruction and the state board.

28:35.810 --> 28:44.255
The next type of item or charter petition item would be a revocation and we've brought two types to you before.

28:44.755 --> 28:48.457
One would be an appeal of a revocation action by a local entity

28:48.997 --> 28:53.979
and also an action that the state board may take on one of its own charters to revoke.

28:54.820 --> 28:59.262
Third type of a charter petition would be an appeal of a renewal.

28:59.842 --> 29:03.584
And that is a denial by a local entity of an existing charter.

29:03.684 --> 29:08.246
And so the charter school can appeal its renewal to the state board.

29:08.386 --> 29:15.890
And currently we have six active charter schools that were authorized originally by a local district,

29:16.690 --> 29:21.152
not approved or renewal came to the state board and were approved here at the state level.

29:21.713 --> 29:27.535
And then lastly, the last type of request is a material revision.

29:27.916 --> 29:34.059
And this is the only type of request that is not done at the local level and come to the state.

29:34.119 --> 29:39.221
So you will never hear a material revision request by a locally authorized charter.

29:39.261 --> 29:42.663
These are only for your existing state board charter schools.

29:43.263 --> 29:50.845
And with that, I'll just talk a little bit about what we do with material revisions, because all three today are material revision requests.

29:50.885 --> 30:01.889
So the standard of review for material revision is virtually the same for the establishment of a new charter school, absent local district findings and signature requirements.

30:02.489 --> 30:09.211
But it does include a thorough review of the charter petition and the multi-year financial plan, which we do on your behalf.

30:10.271 --> 30:24.214
Our review is to determine whether the educational program is sound, the charter school is likely to implement that program, and whether the petition provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the charter elements, the required charter elements.

30:25.074 --> 30:30.716
The action before the State Board is to either approve the material revision or deny the material revision.

30:31.196 --> 30:35.817
If approved, the charter school may actually implement that revised petition.

30:36.838 --> 30:49.851
If the action is to deny the request, which must be based on factual findings, the school continues to operate, so it doesn't cease to exist, but it has to operate under its current charter without the material revisions.

30:50.571 --> 30:58.019
So now I'll present the first of the items for you, which is the Puppetech Los Angeles High.

30:58.659 --> 31:00.281
So item 19 is a request.

31:00.441 --> 31:04.983
for material revision from a current State Board of Education authorized charter school.

31:05.803 --> 31:13.326
Prepa Tech Los Angeles High was originally denied by the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles County Board of Education.

31:14.147 --> 31:22.850
The charter school appealed to the state and was approved by the state board in January 2016 for a five year term to serve up to 168 pupils in grade nine.

31:25.412 --> 31:30.137
adding an additional grade level each year, expanding to 672 pupils in grade 9 through grade 12 by 2019-20.

31:30.157 --> 31:31.779
PrepaTech is currently in its second year of operation.

31:40.289 --> 31:46.715
The charter schools are operated by Alta Public Schools, which is a private non-profit public benefit corporation.

31:47.075 --> 32:04.471
Currently, Alta Public Schools operates two charter schools authorized by LAUSD, Academia Moderna, which serves kindergarten through grade five, and a middle school, Prepatech Los Angeles, which serves grade six through grade eight.

32:04.711 --> 32:06.753
And then lastly, the state board school

32:07.635 --> 32:12.070
serves the full spectrum, the remaining spectrum, which is the high school grades 9 through 12.

32:13.447 --> 32:19.789
PEPA Tech predominantly serves the low-income Latino Hispanic communities of Southeast Los Angeles.

32:20.669 --> 32:29.631
In their original petition, they budgeted to begin its first year of operation, which was last fiscal year, with 168 pupils.

32:30.351 --> 32:41.634
However, in their actual enrollment, ended up being 112 pupils at the 2016-17 second period report of attendance, which represents a decline of 33%.

32:43.955 --> 32:46.917
from what the state board had approved in its original petition.

32:48.258 --> 33:00.668
Furthermore, the charter school's 2016-17 second interim report projected a negative ending fund balance of approximately 189,000 with 0% reserves.

33:02.049 --> 33:12.157
So as a result of the decline in their actual and projected enrollment and the year-end negative financial position, the charter school was required to submit a material revision

33:12.917 --> 33:20.600
and also presents a balanced multi-year financial plan that aligns with the lower, more realistic pupil enrollment.

33:21.380 --> 33:30.543
In addition, we ask the charter school that they also address the proposed actions that the prep-tech board will take to ensure pupil enrollment growth.

33:31.763 --> 33:40.089
On May 31st, we received PREPTEC's request for a mature revision to its charter, which I'm just going to focus on those changes for you.

33:40.590 --> 33:52.658
Those are changes to enrollment, which reflect a reduction in all of the remaining years of the charter school's term, change to facilities, and a presentation of a new multi-year financial plan.

33:53.759 --> 33:54.680
for the facilities.

33:55.501 --> 34:01.428
In the prior year, ProperTech operated in a leased church facility in Huntington Park.

34:03.210 --> 34:10.859
Beginning in the current year, the Charter School proposes to operate at two different sites within the LAUSD boundaries.

34:11.661 --> 34:21.235
The grade 9 pupils will be located in the LAUSD Proposition 39 facility on the campus of Huntington Park High School in Huntington Park.

34:21.937 --> 34:26.223
Grade 10 pupils will be located at a lease facility in the city of Bell.

34:27.004 --> 34:34.467
And grade 11 and 12 pupils were not included in their plan, and so the charter school could share.

34:34.487 --> 34:43.650
We've tried to reach out to them, but we wanted to confirm when they build out the remaining high school levels, what their plans are within these two facility operations.

34:44.910 --> 35:00.085
We performed a thorough review of the revised budget and multi-year financial plan, which is super critical in this case because the material revision proposes to reduce enrollment as well as address the prior year negative fund balance.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.405
and no reserves.

35:01.865 --> 35:05.367
So we just note the following as a highlight to the financial plan review.

35:06.407 --> 35:14.389
The revised multi-year budget includes reduced revenues and expenditures across all years in comparison to their original budget.

35:15.590 --> 35:17.910
It includes a projected enrollment of 260 pupils

35:20.231 --> 35:27.217
in the current year, which is an increase of 148 pupils compared to their prior year actual enrollment.

35:27.677 --> 35:31.740
So as such, this will increase their local control funding formula revenues.

35:33.321 --> 35:41.668
The plan includes expenditure reductions to certificate and classified salaries and benefits, books and supplies, and contracted services agreements.

35:42.368 --> 35:49.170
In response to the change in facilities, the budget does include an increase in total estimated costs for rents and leases.

35:50.271 --> 36:01.975
We find that the adjusted multi-year financial plan to be reasonably sufficient as the charter school begins to rebuild its reserves in the current year, but I do want to note that the fiscal sustainability

36:03.395 --> 36:07.296
is dependent on the charter school increasing and maintaining its enrollment.

36:07.896 --> 36:11.798
The reduction of expenditures won't be sufficient going forward.

36:12.618 --> 36:24.221
The recruitment efforts that the charter school has planned will need to continue and be implemented throughout the year and moving forward and critical to the ongoing viability of the charter school.

36:25.081 --> 36:33.907
Unfortunately, there was no plan submitted with the material revision that would explain their outreach and recruitment efforts.

36:35.028 --> 36:40.632
So we are recommending a condition that the charter schools submit a plan to the CDE.

36:41.572 --> 36:54.101
I believe the prep tech principal is here today to present to the board and I reached out to him and shared that he should present to you what those efforts are, at least you know, orally, because there was nothing provided in writing.

36:55.461 --> 37:02.106
The PREP-ITEC request for material revision was not presented to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools for their consideration.

37:02.806 --> 37:12.813
Since the final petition documents and all the materials that the school wanted to provide, we didn't receive them in time to present for the August ACCS meeting.

37:13.974 --> 37:21.739
But since the proposed changes to the charter school were critical because it dealt with the budget and the facilities and the enrollment,

37:22.799 --> 37:41.347
We felt that they needed to be approved prior to this current school year starting and so there was an agreement that the request would be brought directly to the state board rather than wait for the next October meeting which would make a November board item and that we felt that it was a little too late for the charter school.

37:43.024 --> 37:52.951
We review the entire material revision petition and we find that it meets the standards and criteria and provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the required elements.

37:53.192 --> 37:55.934
There are some recommended technical amendments that we are making.

37:56.854 --> 38:08.243
We recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with technical amendments and the one condition, which is that they submit the plan, recruitment and outreach plan to the CDE.

38:10.771 --> 38:23.595
That the request for mature revision of the prep tech charter under the oversight of the State Board for the remainder of the charter term effective July 1 2017 through June 30 2021 is approved.

38:24.316 --> 38:28.537
So I believe representatives of the school are here and I can also answer any questions that you have.

38:29.565 --> 38:35.108
Yeah, I think the way we usually do this is initial technical questions to Cindy.

38:35.608 --> 38:46.454
If we have them, then we'll do the public hearing and then I'm sure that districts and the charter school will be able to comment during the public hearing.

38:46.894 --> 38:48.915
So, they'll have 10 minutes in the public hearing.

38:48.935 --> 38:51.257
We have to have a public hearing for all these sorts of things.

38:51.597 --> 38:57.200
Any technical questions or... Okay.

39:01.575 --> 39:04.336
If not, then I will convene the public hearing.

39:04.356 --> 39:10.800
The public hearing is open and each side will have 10 minutes and we'll start with the petitioners.

39:14.982 --> 39:16.523
Teca Prepa, please come forward.

39:19.145 --> 39:19.825
Is anybody here?

39:21.426 --> 39:21.586
No?

39:22.727 --> 39:23.027
Okay.

39:37.864 --> 39:38.985
Are you from TACA PREPA?

39:40.026 --> 39:40.847
Yes, okay.

39:41.647 --> 39:42.628
Please come forward.

39:42.668 --> 39:43.049
We're ready.

39:43.069 --> 39:45.110
You have 10 minutes for the public hearing.

39:51.236 --> 40:01.025
Okay, we'll start the clock as soon as you have 10 minutes for your petition to be presented and whatever else you wanted to say to the board.

40:02.643 --> 40:03.043
Good morning.

40:03.063 --> 40:04.404
We just flew in from L.A., so.

40:04.744 --> 40:06.244
Yeah, very timely, right?

40:06.304 --> 40:06.664
Yes.

40:08.065 --> 40:08.545
Well, good morning.

40:08.565 --> 40:09.625
My name is Jose Salas.

40:09.945 --> 40:12.706
I'm the founding principal at PrepaTech Los Angeles High School.

40:13.487 --> 40:17.508
We are opening our second year tomorrow, hopefully, and

40:19.368 --> 40:26.050
We, at this time, the only 100% IB school in South LA, so we're very proud of that and excited about starting our second year.

40:27.010 --> 40:27.970
We have our staff hired.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.571
We have our teachers are credentialed.

40:30.511 --> 40:31.611
We're excited about our new class.

40:31.711 --> 40:32.832
We're adding a 10th grade now.

40:32.972 --> 40:33.852
We had 9th grade last year.

40:33.872 --> 40:34.872
We're now with 9th and 10th.

40:35.552 --> 40:36.772
Our enrollment is getting stronger.

40:37.733 --> 40:42.234
Last year, when we only had our 9th grade class, we started the year with 105 students.

40:44.133 --> 40:48.854
ended the year with 112, retained almost 95% of our students.

40:48.894 --> 40:57.815
So we're very satisfied that those numbers show that our kids felt like they got what they deserved or what they needed and stayed with us.

40:58.055 --> 41:05.357
Our second class now has grown and at this time we have 125 students enrolled and still a few more processing.

41:05.397 --> 41:06.957
So we're ready to get our school year started.

41:07.957 --> 41:12.718
We did last year teach at a location, a church location.

41:13.708 --> 41:18.258
And part of why we're here today is that we requested a change of venue and

41:19.796 --> 41:22.477
there for purposes of improved facilities.

41:22.717 --> 41:24.257
So last year, we were at a church facility.

41:24.858 --> 41:28.299
This year, we're splitting our school into two campuses.

41:28.339 --> 41:33.600
We have our ninth grade at a Prop 39 site at an LAUSD high school, Huntington Park High School.

41:34.301 --> 41:39.242
And our 10th graders are going to a private site that we have converted into a school.

41:39.362 --> 41:42.823
So the move is to improve what we're delivering.

41:43.103 --> 41:48.105
So our being at the Prop 39 site, larger classrooms, more technology,

41:49.205 --> 41:54.547
science lab, everything compliant with USD standards, which is an improvement from where we were.

41:55.067 --> 42:02.050
And then with our 10th grade site, the private site, it has been converted in the classrooms, a larger state of the art technology.

42:02.530 --> 42:06.812
So the request for a move is to improve our instruction, improve our student experience.

42:08.212 --> 42:15.795
We also requested to, and I don't know if this was already talked about, but it's our change of enrollment goals from 168 per grade level to 130.

42:19.146 --> 42:25.089
We did go back and look at what enrollment numbers are for similar charter schools throughout our area.

42:25.109 --> 42:30.391
And that's what we are choosing to change is consistent with what everyone else in our area has.

42:30.411 --> 42:32.572
It still balances our budget.

42:32.612 --> 42:35.233
It still gives us an opportunity to run our IB program.

42:35.774 --> 42:37.114
That has not been compromised.

42:37.174 --> 42:39.095
So those numbers make more sense.

42:39.735 --> 42:44.718
And listening to the enrollment numbers that I shared with you at the beginning, we will be able to meet our goals.

42:46.779 --> 42:47.139
And that's all.

42:47.459 --> 42:47.639
Thank you.

42:50.840 --> 42:53.721
Just as part of the public hearing, you have 10 minutes.

42:53.861 --> 42:58.783
So that's all you... Because I need to have the other side before we have questions.

43:00.863 --> 43:01.083
Okay.

43:01.724 --> 43:02.004
Thank you.

43:03.024 --> 43:03.304
Okay.

43:04.985 --> 43:10.146
So now we have 10 minutes for the opponents to the petition.

43:15.008 --> 43:18.649
Seeing no opponents, I now declare the public hearing closed.

43:19.301 --> 43:23.943
And now we can have, we could ask for public comment, I think.

43:26.243 --> 43:32.545
Would the following people please line up for item 19, Eric Premack and Michelle Lynch.

43:38.788 --> 43:40.368
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

43:40.428 --> 43:42.629
We support the amendments here.

43:43.149 --> 43:47.971
We would note though, and you've heard this from me before, we don't think enrollment is

43:49.261 --> 43:54.026
subject of a charter amendment and that that could and should be handled at the staff level.

43:54.566 --> 44:01.293
The change in facilities, splitting to two locations, that is a legitimate item that should be amended in the charter.

44:01.794 --> 44:03.836
A number of you over the years have

44:04.637 --> 44:13.600
expressed concern to me about the amount of time that you spend on charter matters given that charter schools only serve about 10% of the kids in the state and you feel like you spend half your time on charters.

44:14.000 --> 44:18.201
This is a great, this type of subject is a great opportunity to focus your work.

44:18.782 --> 44:28.965
I would also suggest that if it is a routine facilities change that that could probably go on your consent calendar as well unless there's some real substantive issue to debate behind it.

44:29.105 --> 44:29.365
Thank you.

44:35.461 --> 44:37.842
Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

44:37.862 --> 44:47.808
I'll just echo Eric's comments that we don't believe this should be a material revision for the change in enrollment and that, you know, facilities change could be done probably on consent if it is a routine change.

44:48.248 --> 44:52.050
Also, we do support this material revision today.

44:52.130 --> 44:52.450
Thank you.

44:54.731 --> 44:57.173
Yeah, I'd like our legal counsel to comment on those.

44:57.213 --> 44:59.994
Let me declare the public hearing closed.

45:00.034 --> 45:00.634
I already did.

45:00.695 --> 45:02.616
So we're now in public comment so we could have

45:04.269 --> 45:06.870
your comment on why we have to do this.

45:07.310 --> 45:11.071
It has to be a public hearing.

45:11.611 --> 45:16.653
So I'm not sure how we can have a public hearing on the consent agenda because we have to give both sides the opportunity to talk about it.

45:17.233 --> 45:24.095
And in our MOU, we say any changes in enrollment that are greater than 25% constitute a material revision.

45:24.395 --> 45:26.176
So we can certainly explore that in the future.

45:27.186 --> 45:36.009
We landed on 25% because then that affects the budget, also affects the facilities, and there's so many other domino effects that result from the change in enrollment.

45:36.269 --> 45:39.810
That's why we've determined that 25% is the material revision.

45:41.311 --> 45:42.831
But that is a memorandum.

45:42.951 --> 45:44.492
What is the legal basis of that?

45:44.912 --> 45:51.234
That's the MOU, the contract that we have between our charter schools and the state board, our operated charter schools.

45:51.454 --> 45:53.435
So that is within our discretion?

45:54.445 --> 45:56.526
You can explore whether that's the right amount.

45:56.906 --> 46:12.854
But it's, like I said, it's a determination that I don't think we can say that enrollment in and of itself is not a material revision because of the effect of enrollment changes on budget, facilities, staffing, all of the other, like I said, it's a domino effect.

46:12.974 --> 46:15.095
So it affects a lot of other things.

46:16.216 --> 46:18.617
But we will certainly look into the MOU.

46:19.955 --> 46:22.516
Okay, and the requirement for the public hearing is?

46:23.117 --> 46:23.517
Ed code.

46:24.137 --> 46:24.717
Education code.

46:24.958 --> 46:25.098
Yeah.

46:26.058 --> 46:26.899
And it says what?

46:27.379 --> 46:28.639
We have to have a public hearing.

46:29.700 --> 46:36.823
The charter material revisions are conducted in accordance with the same method that you conduct charter approvals and that's a public hearing.

46:37.764 --> 46:41.766
So that's why we have 10 minutes for each side because that's how our public hearings are conducted.

46:44.292 --> 46:44.873
We'll look into it.

46:45.013 --> 46:46.854
We're happy to look into it.

46:47.234 --> 46:48.775
We're getting more and more of these.

46:48.835 --> 47:10.550
And at some point, some board will confront, it seems to me, an overload, perhaps, particularly when we get into discussions of reauthorizing all these operations that are off-site, you know, and these kinds of things that we're going to be taking up from the Shasta decision.

47:10.630 --> 47:11.331
So every...

47:12.311 --> 47:12.712
Yeah.

47:12.772 --> 47:13.593
Those are new schools.

47:13.633 --> 47:15.755
So that would be a different, different discussion.

47:15.775 --> 47:15.895
Yeah.

47:15.915 --> 47:19.078
But if we approve some, we're going to have to go through a material revision.

47:19.138 --> 47:19.598
At some point.

47:20.179 --> 47:20.459
Yeah.

47:20.519 --> 47:29.168
And I think we need to be cognizant of the workload, not only for our board, but future boards as well.

47:30.289 --> 47:35.294
As we, because if we, you know, we might have a big load next

47:37.417 --> 47:40.339
year on these.

47:40.379 --> 47:41.660
We'll be happy to explore it.

47:41.960 --> 47:42.240
Yeah.

47:42.360 --> 47:43.320
Okay.

47:43.500 --> 47:43.881
Yeah.

47:45.562 --> 47:45.942
Okay.

47:46.682 --> 47:47.002
Pardon?

47:48.543 --> 47:48.843
Okay.

47:48.903 --> 47:49.164
Yes.

47:49.284 --> 47:54.626
We will start then with the questioning with our charter school liaison.

47:58.649 --> 48:02.991
I'll defer to the rest of the board and then I... No, I think you would prefer to defer.

48:03.723 --> 48:03.923
Yes.

48:04.103 --> 48:07.325
And then I will, I do have some comments.

48:07.505 --> 48:08.025
Yeah, I know.

48:09.026 --> 48:10.187
So who was first here?

48:10.207 --> 48:12.388
I thought Ortiz-Lacon was first.

48:12.868 --> 48:13.168
Yeah.

48:13.409 --> 48:17.551
Actually, I just wanted to just make a comment on the last thing.

48:17.871 --> 48:22.154
The material, there is requirement for a public hearing for material revision.

48:22.314 --> 48:24.455
But what constitutes material revision?

48:25.236 --> 48:26.898
we've established in an MOU.

48:26.918 --> 48:28.621
So we have discretion on that part.

48:28.681 --> 48:35.072
And I think that is the piece that we may want our liaisons to work with our staff in reviewing.

48:37.596 --> 48:37.956
All right.

48:37.996 --> 48:38.958
So Ortiz-Lacombe.

48:40.814 --> 48:47.779
I actually had a question about recruitment, retention and also the facility.

48:48.019 --> 48:51.901
So if you could come back, Principal Berbatek.

48:53.142 --> 48:57.985
I actually had the privilege of serving the Southeast community as a field deputy during my days at LAUSD.

48:58.365 --> 49:00.847
So I know that the communities, I know them well.

49:00.947 --> 49:04.970
And I also know that they tend to be not very friendly towards charter schools.

49:05.930 --> 49:08.412
And that's something that seeps through the community and also even

49:08.792 --> 49:12.357
their own individual governing bodies from the different cities.

49:13.759 --> 49:25.195
So I could understand why you're having a hard time recruiting but I'm wondering how do you plan to recruit and even if the numbers are lowered and also because I know the area so well

49:26.036 --> 49:41.527
I know that HP and Bell tend to be rivals, the high schools at least, so I'm wondering how you're going to create a school culture when you have your students split in two cities, although the cities are so close by and everything is like two streets away, but

49:42.327 --> 49:46.849
The culture there is it's, you know, Hunter Park versus Bell.

49:47.089 --> 49:51.291
And now you have one ninth grade in one side and 10th grade in the other.

49:51.911 --> 49:59.674
So what's your plan to bring them together to really have a unified school culture and also grow in one location?

49:59.754 --> 50:06.317
And I also know how difficult it is to to find facilities in the southeast because it's such these are small, dense cities.

50:06.937 --> 50:09.578
But again, I am concerned that we're trying to build a culture

50:10.098 --> 50:13.342
and you have your students split up, which is a very common practice.

50:13.622 --> 50:18.588
But given the landscape of the communities in the Southeast, that could be a little problematic for school culture.

50:19.689 --> 50:21.892
And I'll address the question about culture first.

50:22.372 --> 50:29.260
And I guess it is a challenging thing to be in a Prop 39 site where, you know, we do have, you know,

50:30.043 --> 50:31.986
prep attack schools, right?

50:32.066 --> 50:33.568
They've been around for 10 years.

50:33.628 --> 50:41.178
And there is an elementary school there that started organically almost 10 years ago and then moved on to middle school, now high school.

50:41.198 --> 50:43.561
So you do have a lot of families that are

50:45.908 --> 50:46.949
very much pro-charter.

50:47.869 --> 50:55.872
And being on an LAUSD site for them was a very difficult thing at the beginning for us to a message to get across.

50:56.913 --> 51:01.194
But in time, I think everyone has begun to embrace that concept.

51:01.274 --> 51:08.938
And Huntington Park High School has a brand new principal and a couple of new vice principals that we've been working together.

51:08.978 --> 51:09.518
It's been great.

51:10.131 --> 51:10.591
It's been great.

51:10.631 --> 51:12.873
District personnel has received us very well.

51:14.755 --> 51:18.878
Their parent center, which is right across from our building, has been very welcoming.

51:18.958 --> 51:24.342
So, so far, all the signs are there that we're going to collaborate and work well together.

51:25.163 --> 51:31.788
Luckily, the way this Prop 39 is set up, we are almost completely separate from the rest of the high school.

51:31.828 --> 51:35.771
So, we're really not going to have much interaction, but we do share sports.

51:36.872 --> 51:39.034
And we have been, last year, we

51:39.850 --> 51:44.372
did have the opportunity to send kids to play varsity and junior varsity sports at HP.

51:44.912 --> 51:46.072
Very few kids participated.

51:46.092 --> 51:47.813
They did not feel comfortable going there.

51:48.473 --> 51:52.535
Now that we're on that site, though, it's almost like we have a satellite office there.

51:53.375 --> 51:56.876
And our participation with sports has grown by 10 times.

51:57.877 --> 52:03.299
So, so far, as unusual as it may seem and as difficult as this

52:04.102 --> 52:12.755
may have this even this whole concept you know was maybe 15 years ago between charter schools and LASD schools so far it's actually going quite well and

52:14.358 --> 52:19.000
Of course, when the school year begins tomorrow, then we'll really find out what else we need to do.

52:19.100 --> 52:20.441
But, you know, we are in uniform.

52:20.481 --> 52:21.541
They're not in uniform.

52:21.581 --> 52:22.922
We have a separate entrance.

52:23.002 --> 52:24.182
We have our own set of rules.

52:25.223 --> 52:37.488
I think through very careful planning with our orientations and talking to parents about what needs to be done, you know, we do feel we're going to carve our little culture on that same property.

52:38.088 --> 52:39.649
Now, our other campus is in Bell.

52:40.587 --> 52:47.813
And luckily, with CIF rules, at first we thought half of our kids would have to play sports at Bell and then the other half at HP.

52:48.453 --> 52:57.140
Luckily, CIF already thought of this and all our kids have to play sports at HP, so we don't have to work with Bell at this time.

52:58.181 --> 53:03.725
So, so far, it seems like we're taking those steps and we're just carving out our own culture within the same property.

53:04.548 --> 53:06.508
Well, I meant your own school.

53:06.549 --> 53:10.629
So your 10th graders and your ninth graders, when will you physically bring them together?

53:10.730 --> 53:13.950
What is the plan to have them all in one location?

53:14.430 --> 53:17.691
Because then you're going to grow into, you're going to have juniors and seniors.

53:18.071 --> 53:19.812
So where, where's your school?

53:19.852 --> 53:23.433
Is it going to be in two different locations, in three different locations?

53:23.873 --> 53:33.375
Is it, is there a plan of how to bring your school together and keep them in one location and start building your school culture in one location versus co-locating?

53:33.995 --> 53:41.558
Our CMO office with our executive director are actively right now in conversations with the local community college.

53:42.218 --> 53:52.422
They're planning to abandon a large campus that we, they're talking to about, you know, moving in there.

53:53.003 --> 53:54.923
I don't think I can reveal too much about that.

53:54.963 --> 53:58.885
I'm not part of those conversations, but that is one of the plans.

53:58.945 --> 54:01.746
It is a large enough property where we can have all our fourth grades there.

54:02.659 --> 54:05.322
and it's only maybe five or six blocks away.

54:10.286 --> 54:11.427
Should I answer the first question?

54:12.849 --> 54:20.576
So the first question is about enrollment and just looking at year one and year two enrollment, you know, we started last year with 105, this year we're going to start

54:21.797 --> 54:24.599
with 125, 130, and we're still enrolling.

54:25.440 --> 54:27.541
We're starting to develop a bit of a niche.

54:27.561 --> 54:31.144
You know, we're the only IB school, so that is of interest to families.

54:31.704 --> 54:43.393
We do have busing, so we have added a few more stops throughout the South LA area, and that seems to be bringing in families that were, you know, interested in us, but maybe the parents don't drive or

54:44.033 --> 54:45.953
can't afford to bring the kids to us.

54:46.914 --> 54:49.214
We are out there and we're still enrolling.

54:49.654 --> 54:53.595
So, there is a need in South L.A.

54:53.675 --> 54:55.275
for high school I.B.

54:55.935 --> 55:01.176
and parents are slowly finding out about us through flyers and all the different things that we do.

55:01.836 --> 55:05.117
But our busing has been a big help and we just added that this year.

55:07.698 --> 55:09.378
Okay, board member Rucker.

55:10.894 --> 55:16.937
OK, so first of all, I want to congratulate you for being on an international baccalaureate program.

55:16.977 --> 55:24.720
Starting up that program, regardless of what type of school that you are, what district you're located in, is very difficult.

55:25.160 --> 55:28.662
And it is also difficult to recruit students to go into the program.

55:28.722 --> 55:36.505
So I think you're taking on a very important and significant type of high school experience for your students.

55:36.525 --> 55:38.246
So I want to congratulate you on that.

55:39.026 --> 55:47.893
It doesn't surprise me about the facilities and the need to split up your campus, particularly in the communities where you work.

55:48.333 --> 55:56.539
I'm going to use on purpose the word landlocked because there really is not a lot of options for trying to grow or expand your program.

55:56.899 --> 56:02.343
And that could also be in some ways material to some of the recruitment challenges you're finding.

56:02.843 --> 56:04.665
in finding and identifying students.

56:05.305 --> 56:14.652
Parents may be making a decision to be attracted to your program because of IB, but have a concern about the location of facility where their students may be going.

56:15.453 --> 56:23.559
Cindy indicated that part of the reason why, or part of what she asked you to speak to today is about your recruitment strategy.

56:24.039 --> 56:27.121
So I do have some questions for you on that.

56:27.662 --> 56:30.604
Knowing that you are still working to grow your program, you're adding

56:31.104 --> 56:33.928
a grade this year and you'll be adding another grade next year.

56:34.428 --> 56:40.215
Can you tell me a little bit more about what your actual recruitment strategy is?

56:40.295 --> 56:49.887
And in asking you this, it's not related to the material revision that you're requesting to change your enrollment, but I want to understand what your challenge is.

56:50.567 --> 57:06.010
And in understanding why this particular revision is important to be approved, I want to make sure that you all have a clear understanding, not only of what your recruitment challenge is, but in crafting your program for the recruitment, your plan.

57:06.531 --> 57:09.133
is a reflection of your understanding of those challenges.

57:09.213 --> 57:25.301
So, I'm going to vote, I want to let you know before you even answer this, I'm going to vote to support the material revision, but I want to make sure next year you're not going to be coming back again and asking for another reduction because your plan for recruiting did not work.

57:25.682 --> 57:34.907
I want to make sure that you have a clear idea about what your recruitment challenges are and how you think your plan addresses it.

57:36.032 --> 57:48.412
I think one of our, we're understanding our challenges more and more and I'll talk about two things, our challenges and then the message that we're getting out now that we feel is working and the challenge is IB is rigorous.

57:49.595 --> 57:52.558
And some families feel their kids are not ready for it.

57:52.859 --> 57:57.984
Or, you know, our kids are taking seven, eight classes instead of six.

57:59.266 --> 58:02.029
We don't have an emphasis on sports.

58:02.109 --> 58:03.971
Our emphasis is academics.

58:04.291 --> 58:07.154
It's not a traditional high school experience.

58:07.775 --> 58:10.257
We're zeroed in on getting kids to college.

58:11.338 --> 58:13.459
So that is, it's a great thing, but it's still a challenge.

58:14.939 --> 58:21.500
But at the same time, the message that's really working for us right now is that, you know, that we're a rigorous school.

58:22.561 --> 58:25.821
We are now officially an IB candidate school.

58:26.062 --> 58:28.762
So we can actually put the logos on our website and on our paper.

58:28.822 --> 58:29.822
We couldn't do that before.

58:30.283 --> 58:40.285
So it was all based on trust that we're going to apply and be accepted as an applicant school and also trust that we're going to find them a facility that works.

58:40.865 --> 58:49.310
So I've been really blown away by how loyal the families that do like our message and believe in our message, how loyal they are.

58:50.011 --> 58:56.195
And I tell you right now, they'll follow us to Lynwood or somewhere else in South L.A.

58:56.235 --> 58:59.417
just to be a part of this program, you know, with what we have established so far.

59:00.373 --> 59:18.237
But the message that's really working for us is the IB and the world studies, the kids learning a second language, kids working in teams, presenting, all that sort of instruction.

59:18.697 --> 59:22.358
I'm very fluent in Spanish, so I can explain this very well to parents.

59:23.358 --> 59:28.441
All that, that entire message is really working with some parents and the word is slowly getting out.

59:28.901 --> 59:45.891
So when I go out and recruit and I speak to families at churches and at different recruitment events, just talking about the academic program and the rigor of it and the kind of classes they're taking and the critical thinking and working in groups and presenting all that message, that's what's slowly bringing us more and more students.

59:46.551 --> 59:49.253
So we're going to continue with that.

59:49.593 --> 59:52.275
And once students enroll with us, they don't leave.

59:53.335 --> 59:58.799
As long as they get in the door and they get a taste of the experience of what we're providing students, they don't leave anymore.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.523
And that's why we were able to retain kids last year, even though our facility was not the best.

01:00:04.543 --> 01:00:08.306
I don't know if that answers your entire question.

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.001
Board Member Holligan?

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:11.382
No.

01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:12.964
OK.

01:00:13.784 --> 01:00:14.766
I'll be honest with you.

01:00:15.146 --> 01:00:16.828
No, it didn't answer the question.

01:00:17.649 --> 01:00:20.813
And I think you were aware that no, it didn't answer the question.

01:00:21.294 --> 01:00:27.581
But I understand what you're saying about if you get them in the door, the experience retains.

01:00:28.402 --> 01:00:31.163
So I understand that and I believe you on that point.

01:00:31.683 --> 01:00:38.826
But my question was, what are you going to be doing during the course of this year to get them in the door?

01:00:38.866 --> 01:00:44.808
So I heard you talk about some of the recruitment events and your visits to specific places.

01:00:45.548 --> 01:00:54.572
So let me just suggest, and again, as I told you before, when I asked the question, you're getting a question from a receptive and supportive board member.

01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:55.252
I'm going to vote.

01:00:55.632 --> 01:00:57.693
to approve this RETIRA revision.

01:00:58.714 --> 01:01:03.116
Let me suggest that you really do need to think about scheduling the events.

01:01:03.476 --> 01:01:13.021
You need to have some goals about what will constitute your new incoming class, how many students at a minimum you need, and why that number is important.

01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:21.805
You need to talk to, you need to think about what your deliverables are in doing this recruitment and where you're going in each of those events and planning

01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:23.086
that type of recruitment.

01:01:23.106 --> 01:01:26.809
We have people on the board who do this better than I do.

01:01:26.889 --> 01:01:34.315
We have people in the audience who are stakeholders with different charter management and charter advisory groups who can help you on that.

01:01:34.395 --> 01:01:49.168
So I urgently recommend that you talk with Eric and with the Charter Schools Association to get some help on your recruitment because my concern is we're going to see you back here again next year asking for another change.

01:01:49.708 --> 01:01:53.510
if you do not develop a more concrete recruitment strategy.

01:01:53.530 --> 01:02:01.615
And Eric, I'm apologizing now for volunteering you into that, but I know you will do that and I know you will help him with that.

01:02:01.715 --> 01:02:03.296
One thing we're definitely doing is starting earlier.

01:02:03.316 --> 01:02:08.619
In the first couple of years of DREPA Tech, the outreach

01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:10.701
didn't start until January or February.

01:02:11.442 --> 01:02:17.389
And in that community, not just LA Unified, but also other churches will start as early as October.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:27.021
So that is on our schedule for the year already, having open houses earlier in the year, so parents can come in and understand what we do.

01:02:27.939 --> 01:02:36.002
So that is on the schedule already and we do have some strategic partnerships with some middle schools, charter and LEUSD.

01:02:36.162 --> 01:02:41.164
Everyone's been very friendly so far and different organizations to go in and speak.

01:02:41.184 --> 01:02:45.686
So we do have a handful, more than a handful of places to go to, but I

01:02:46.897 --> 01:02:47.477
I agree with you.

01:02:47.497 --> 01:02:48.117
We need to do more.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:56.260
And again, let me, I'm going to, I said this yesterday and I'm going to, and this bears repeating, you can't make progress without struggling.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.061
That's not my original idea.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.402
Frederick Douglass said it first and he said it better.

01:03:01.122 --> 01:03:07.664
Embrace the fact that you are struggling and be honest in that conversation so that, because it will help you understand

01:03:08.064 --> 01:03:14.007
not only what you're struggling with, but it'll help you come up with more concrete ways to resolve what those issues are.

01:03:14.448 --> 01:03:36.480
And again, my advice really and truly is there are some experts who have testified today and you've had a chance to, you weren't here when they testified, but please make sure before you leave today that you talk to those folks and get some help on that because if you don't come up with a better idea for doing your recruitment, your school is not going to survive.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:36.920
Okay.

01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:37.641
Thank you.

01:03:43.578 --> 01:03:59.932
I'm sorry that you weren't here at the beginning and didn't hear the CDE presentation because I think that might have helped You present in a slightly different way and address some of these questions that have been raised But I do I do think that

01:04:01.153 --> 01:04:06.555
sort of naturally you're finding ways to help your recruitment process such as the busing.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:23.480
I struggled with recruitment in a charter school for a number of years and, you know, what's important to families, what's important to parents, I didn't quite understand until I got into the weeds and then suddenly things came up that were really, really helpful.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:28.361
So I agree with Member Rucker that there are people that can really support you in this process.

01:04:29.475 --> 01:04:43.507
That being said, this recommendation by the CDE has very specific conditions and technical amendments associated with this recommendation that we are going to vote for.

01:04:43.768 --> 01:04:46.350
And I want to address some of those very specifically with you.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:55.034
For one thing, it does, there is a condition that says that you absolutely have to detail out a very specific strategic recruitment and retention plan.

01:04:55.574 --> 01:05:09.321
And so based upon your comments this morning, I have a feeling that when this passes, as I think it will, you really will need to sit down and detail that out and provide that to the CDE.

01:05:12.353 --> 01:05:14.294
I do want to talk about a couple of the other conditions.

01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:33.661
So one of the conditions or technical amendments, I guess it's Defined here in this recommendation is about the school site council and in that technical amendment the CDE is asking that your school site council number 20 and

01:05:36.395 --> 01:05:39.658
As I understand it, EDCO does not require a specific number.

01:05:41.279 --> 01:05:55.849
However, it does require a ratio between community members, teachers, and that the composition of this Schools Like Council is determined by EDCO.

01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:07.177
I'm a bit concerned about our setting a precedent of establishing a specific number for a charter school school site council.

01:06:07.778 --> 01:06:25.811
And what I intend to do is to make a recommendation that changes this technical amendment to provide more flexibility in terms of the number of members of the school site council, but adheres to Ed Code specifically.

01:06:27.012 --> 01:06:30.295
Is that something that you've thought about?

01:06:30.995 --> 01:06:33.557
Are you perfectly content with this number 20?

01:06:33.677 --> 01:06:49.451
Would it, you know, is it more appropriate to change this amendment to align and verify to the CDE that you are meeting Ed Code as opposed to a specific number?

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:52.074
I know what the wishes of our board is to

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:58.673
comply with the state board recommendation, that is their wish.

01:06:59.134 --> 01:07:02.355
As principal, I'm the one that's actually going to be out there implementing this.

01:07:04.297 --> 01:07:09.459
If we could have that as, you know, what Ed Code has, it makes it more doable for us.

01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:12.561
Last year, that's what we did.

01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:13.782
We ran it with the

01:07:14.361 --> 01:07:16.483
Ed Code requires.

01:07:17.444 --> 01:07:19.826
But if we go above that, it just makes it a little more challenging.

01:07:19.846 --> 01:07:24.670
But I know our board officially would like to comply with what you recommend.

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:30.556
Member Rucker.

01:07:33.263 --> 01:07:33.603
Okay.

01:07:33.663 --> 01:07:45.033
So, you know, I read that and I actually wasn't bothered by that particular number just because of the multiple sites that all of the students would be at.

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:51.258
I think the Ed Code requires the school site council contains basically two groups.

01:07:51.339 --> 01:07:54.021
There's a staff side of the school site council.

01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:55.703
and there's a parent side.

01:07:56.163 --> 01:08:02.249
And I thought that when I read that part, I was looking particularly at the issue of the parent side.

01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:14.262
If the goal for this recommendation was to ensure or to assure the opportunity that parents from each of these sites, where the school will be housed,

01:08:14.682 --> 01:08:24.350
have an opportunity to be on the school site council, you're going to have a lot of parents on that school site council.

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:28.373
You're going to then have to have parity from the staff side.

01:08:28.413 --> 01:08:32.036
So that site council is going to grow in sheer numbers anyway.

01:08:32.436 --> 01:08:43.986
So the number didn't bother me, but I understand the revision that you want to make to simply say that it has to have the parity between the in the composition.

01:08:44.486 --> 01:08:46.487
as required by the Education Code.

01:08:47.047 --> 01:09:04.372
So, if you're going to do that, could I offer a friendly amendment saying that there needs to be assurance that parents from each of the sites where the school will be located will have parity and representation on that council.

01:09:07.413 --> 01:09:09.694
So, that would mean at least one parent from each site.

01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:11.715
At least one parent from each site.

01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:21.764
Cindy, would you like to speak to this question about why this number 20 came up?

01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:28.229
I just think it's a situation where we're adding something to EDCODE that we don't need to add.

01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:29.170
That's all.

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:32.032
Come up, please.

01:09:32.052 --> 01:09:33.694
Yeah, speak into the microphone.

01:09:35.775 --> 01:09:36.356
You need to come up.

01:09:38.103 --> 01:09:47.230
We base the numbers on what's in the petition in terms of the multiple schools, but really the intent is that they meet the education code.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:51.034
So we'll just have to look at that and make sure that the numbers align with that.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.114
So we are fine with that.

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:52.815
Okay, thanks.

01:09:55.137 --> 01:09:55.717
And one more.

01:09:58.689 --> 01:10:12.482
So you already have, in essence, a school culture established with a great number of the children that you work with because they have actually matriculated from an elementary school into a middle school.

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.285
And now many of them are continuing on into this high school.

01:10:15.345 --> 01:10:15.846
Is that correct?

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:20.433
About 65% of our kids come from our middle school.

01:10:20.513 --> 01:10:30.315
So that is mostly true, but we do have a good number of kids coming from a variety of different charter and district schools throughout South LA.

01:10:30.675 --> 01:10:33.155
About 65% come out of the middle school?

01:10:33.655 --> 01:10:35.476
About 35% are from other schools.

01:10:35.496 --> 01:10:37.496
Are they in an IB program in the middle school?

01:10:37.876 --> 01:10:38.296
Yes, they are.

01:10:38.837 --> 01:10:40.457
IB in the elementary and in the

01:10:41.517 --> 01:10:42.197
in middle school.

01:10:43.018 --> 01:10:55.241
So, it's important for them, if they want to continue in the IB program, and obviously 65% of them do want to, it's important that they have an IB high school to go to.

01:10:55.301 --> 01:10:55.842
Is that correct?

01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:56.442
Absolutely.

01:10:57.562 --> 01:11:01.043
So, what are their options if they don't go to you?

01:11:01.063 --> 01:11:02.484
They want to attend Repotec.

01:11:02.704 --> 01:11:06.585
There are a couple of charter schools in the area, but that would, you know, that would

01:11:07.855 --> 01:11:08.157
I.B.

01:11:08.277 --> 01:11:08.740
options.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.504
But they're not I.B.

01:11:09.926 --> 01:11:10.730
I'm talking I.B.

01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:11.172
options.

01:11:11.192 --> 01:11:11.333
I.B.

01:11:11.373 --> 01:11:12.057
there are not any at all.

01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:14.630
So, thank you, sir.

01:11:15.031 --> 01:11:15.271
Okay.

01:11:15.831 --> 01:11:28.094
So one of my concerns here is that the admissions preferences do not give any preference to the middle school prep tech that has an IB program.

01:11:28.694 --> 01:11:40.957
And I do think that, once again, the recommendation from the CDE goes as far as the usual statement about school, I mean, admissions preferences.

01:11:41.477 --> 01:11:53.505
But at the same time, in this case, as in other cases that we've seen with some of the charters that we've heard, some other additional admissions preferences could be appropriate.

01:11:53.545 --> 01:11:55.486
And that is within our right to do.

01:11:55.846 --> 01:11:59.429
And in this case, I do believe that having an admissions preference

01:12:00.729 --> 01:12:04.972
available in the list for Prep Tech Middle School would be appropriate.

01:12:05.452 --> 01:12:11.856
Otherwise, these IB kids could be left out in the process of the program.

01:12:12.096 --> 01:12:16.479
And as I understand, the IB program doesn't end at middle school.

01:12:17.039 --> 01:12:23.523
And so being able to make sure that these kids can continue, I think, is an important piece.

01:12:23.903 --> 01:12:25.324
With that, I'm ready to make a motion.

01:12:25.504 --> 01:12:25.744
Yeah.

01:12:25.764 --> 01:12:26.925
Do you have any response to that?

01:12:27.742 --> 01:12:28.602
No, I agree.

01:12:28.682 --> 01:12:32.864
I mean, the kids are, you know, the IB program, middle years program is a five-year program.

01:12:32.904 --> 01:12:38.967
And, you know, even though middle school ends and they're going to high school, they still need years four and five to complete what they're doing.

01:12:39.007 --> 01:12:43.809
So, I completely agree that we should give our own middle school kids preference.

01:12:44.589 --> 01:12:48.591
You know, our middle school is smaller than what our high school numbers are going to be anyway.

01:12:48.651 --> 01:12:53.913
So, there's always going to be room for other kids for, you know, diversity and just bringing new kids into the system.

01:12:54.853 --> 01:12:55.154
Okay.

01:12:55.174 --> 01:12:56.034
We're ready for the motion.

01:12:56.465 --> 01:12:56.905
Thank you, sir.

01:12:56.925 --> 01:12:57.465
Thank you.

01:12:59.806 --> 01:13:04.686
I'm passing around a motion just so everyone can read it and make sure that you're clear on it.

01:13:04.806 --> 01:13:09.307
I am going to take the friendly suggestion from Member Rucker.

01:13:09.667 --> 01:13:17.929
And so we will add just a couple, a few words, six, seven words in this to make that piece.

01:13:18.249 --> 01:13:20.649
So this is not what I gave you is not quite right.

01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:25.150
So approve the CDE recommendation with changes to two technical amendments.

01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:28.383
school site council, and admission preferences.

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:46.607
For the school site council, the technical amendment shall require PREPTEC to verify with CDE that site council membership is compliant with Ed Code Section 52852, and I would add at the end of that sentence these words, and include parents from each site.

01:13:47.682 --> 01:13:47.962
Okay.

01:13:49.183 --> 01:13:59.267
And then for the admissions preferences technical amendment, approve the preferences recommended by CD along with the additional preference for students attending PrepaTech Los Angeles operated by PrepaTech.

01:13:59.287 --> 01:14:00.027
That's my motion.

01:14:02.128 --> 01:14:02.488
Okay.

01:14:02.948 --> 01:14:04.469
Any further discussion on the motion?

01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:07.190
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

01:14:07.690 --> 01:14:07.930
Good.

01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:08.811
All right.

01:14:08.851 --> 01:14:10.932
We'll take a break for the board.

01:14:11.032 --> 01:14:12.612
So we'll come back at 10 o'clock.

01:14:21.038 --> 01:14:30.060
We convene and we're now ready for item 20, the Solarity Charter School material revision.

01:14:31.921 --> 01:14:39.163
This is another public hearing, so Cindy Chan will present to begin that and then we'll move to the public hearing.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:48.494
So this one is a little bit longer, but then item 21 is a duplicate of this one because they're identical petitions, so that one will be shorter.

01:14:49.155 --> 01:14:52.216
But this one's a little longer because it's more complicated.

01:14:52.356 --> 01:14:59.901
So item 20 is a request for a material against Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:06.003
Item 20 is a request for a material revision from a current State Board of Education authorized charter school.

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:13.785
Celerity Homalia Charter was originally denied by the Los Angeles Unified School District and Los Angeles County Board of Education.

01:15:14.786 --> 01:15:19.767
Celerity Homalia appealed to the State and was approved by the State Board in November 2016 for a five-year term.

01:15:22.288 --> 01:15:35.111
to serve 455 pupils in transitional kindergarten through grade six in year one, which is 2017-18, increasing to 565 pupils in TK through grade eight by 2020-21.

01:15:35.371 --> 01:15:45.073
Solarity Himalaya is in year two of its five-year term, but in its first year of operation this year, recently opening on August 15th.

01:15:46.853 --> 01:15:55.996
The charter school offers a site-based matriculation setting with a commitment to increasing the achievement of at-risk pupils from communities in need within LAUSD.

01:15:57.296 --> 01:16:07.239
On June 1st, the CDE received Celerity Himalaya's request for material revision to its charter, which includes the following changes, and then I will briefly summarize each one.

01:16:07.999 --> 01:16:22.278
change to the governance structure, termination of Solarity Global Development Services contracts, increases in pupil enrollment, change to grade levels offered, and a change to the facilities.

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:26.457
So I'll give you a little bit of background about the governance structure.

01:16:26.578 --> 01:16:42.005
If you recall, back in November, when the original Solarity Haumāia petition was presented, we had expressed some concerns over the governance structure, which was multi-layered and very complex.

01:16:42.045 --> 01:16:43.746
We did a lot of boxes and everything.

01:16:44.526 --> 01:16:45.527
on how to describe it.

01:16:45.547 --> 01:16:58.097
Celerity Himalaya is operated by Celerity Educational Group, a non-profit public benefit corporation that oversees a network of charter schools, including seven in Los Angeles County.

01:16:59.438 --> 01:17:09.626
The governance structure authorizes Celerity Global Development, another separate non-profit public benefit corporation, to serve as the sole statutory member of CEG.

01:17:10.186 --> 01:17:13.049
I'm going to refer to Celerity Educational Group as CEG.

01:17:14.049 --> 01:17:25.255
In that capacity, Slurdy Global or Global, Global's rights include approving the elected CEG trustees and may also remove a CEG trustee at any time without cause.

01:17:26.336 --> 01:17:29.337
In addition to Global's role as sole statutory member of CEG,

01:17:30.758 --> 01:17:35.820
CEG also contracts with Global for various services for all of the charter schools that are overseas.

01:17:36.721 --> 01:17:49.646
We had concern that the control that this affords one of CEG's primary vendors over its governing board presents the potential for a conflict of interest that puts at risk the charter school's operational welfare.

01:17:50.626 --> 01:17:57.375
So in the material revision, Solarity Himalaya is proposing to change the governance structure.

01:17:57.776 --> 01:18:05.687
In May 2017, Global's Board of Directors adopted a resolution resigning as a sole statutory member.

01:18:06.627 --> 01:18:14.672
of CEG, thereby relinquishing all of its rights as a member of CEG, including those reflected in the CEG bylaws.

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:29.459
The CEG Board of Directors adopted a resolution accepting Global's resignation as sole statutory member, also amending CEG's bylaws to remove any and all rights of Global in CEG,

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.703
and reflecting that CEG shall have no members.

01:18:35.484 --> 01:18:37.385
They'll just have their board of trustees.

01:18:38.326 --> 01:18:42.749
These actions are documented in a number of the attachments that we've included in the item.

01:18:44.286 --> 01:18:50.711
A second change is the termination of the Solarity Global Development Services contracts as the vendor for CEG.

01:18:51.592 --> 01:19:09.586
So in the current Solarity Himalaya petition, CEG contracts with Global for various services, management, fiscal, personnel, procurement, facilities operations, facilities financing, different program services, and other miscellaneous services.

01:19:10.567 --> 01:19:16.949
With the material revision, CEG submitted a transition plan to several contracts with Global.

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:29.633
In June 2017, CEG sent terminations to Global of the two contracts between CEG and Global for limited services and an agreement for miscellaneous services.

01:19:31.654 --> 01:19:40.001
These terminations triggered the 120-day notice that the contracts will expire on September 30th, 2017.

01:19:40.782 --> 01:19:49.589
Also, CEG's board did not renew its annual contracts with Attenture, a global affiliate that assisted with information technology.

01:19:50.790 --> 01:20:01.776
As part of the transition plan, services will be provided either in-house with the hiring of new positions or selecting new vendors to provide those services.

01:20:02.856 --> 01:20:08.259
CEG has been recruiting and continues to hire key executive team positions.

01:20:09.119 --> 01:20:16.603
By October 1st, 2017, CEG expects to have severed all ties with global and global affiliates.

01:20:18.203 --> 01:20:24.244
So the third change in the mature revision is the change to grade levels and enrollment.

01:20:24.384 --> 01:20:33.326
In 2016, the LAUSD board denied the renewal of two Solarity charter schools, Solarity Dyad Charter and Solarity Trica Charter.

01:20:34.166 --> 01:20:42.267
Both charter schools appealed to the state board for renewal and both were denied by the state board at the May 2017 meeting.

01:20:43.087 --> 01:20:46.988
Solarity Dyad and Solarity Trica closed effective June 30th.

01:20:48.428 --> 01:20:59.717
As a result of these closures, Solarity Himalaya is proposing to add grade levels in the current year and the next year, and to increase enrollment across all years.

01:21:00.197 --> 01:21:05.021
Specifically, they will offer TK through grade 8 in all years.

01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:16.470
The material revision change is that they're going to add grade 7 and grade 8 in the current year, and then add grade 8 in 2018-19, and then the rest was in the original plan.

01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:31.414
So their proposes to increase enrollment each year are estimated at approximately a 63% increase in the current year, 43% increase next year, and then a 39% increase in the last two years.

01:21:31.454 --> 01:21:36.216
And those increases are in comparison to the original build-out plan.

01:21:37.975 --> 01:21:51.454
As a result of the additional grade levels and increases to enrollment, Celerity Himalaya is proposing to operate at four leased facilities within the LAUSD boundaries that will serve different grade level clusters.

01:21:51.874 --> 01:21:54.277
So that is a change to the original plan.

01:21:55.618 --> 01:22:12.027
And then finally on the financial plan, we reviewed the revised financial plan submitted with the material revision and we just highlight revenues and expenditures for the proposed increases to pupil enrollment and expenses for the additional facilities are included and appear sufficient.

01:22:13.308 --> 01:22:22.153
It includes expenditures that represent some of the changes to services outlined in CEG's transition plan to several contracts with Global.

01:22:23.233 --> 01:22:32.676
And it also includes expenditures to Global to cover services being provided by Global until the service contracts are terminated on October 1st.

01:22:33.857 --> 01:22:45.861
As new contracts are secured by CEG, the CED will perform a review of each contract and the cost impact to the financial plan since it's still sort of in a transition state.

01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:55.776
Overall we find the Charter Schools revised financial plan to be fiscally viable with projected positive ending fund balances and reserves.

01:22:57.277 --> 01:23:14.349
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the celerity hamalia petition material revision at its August 15th meeting and voted unanimously to recommend that the State Board approve the request for a material revision of the celerity hamalia charter as proposed by the CDE.

01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:24.893
As part of our review, we reviewed the petition documents thoroughly to determine whether the petition sufficiently meets the required legal criteria.

01:23:25.774 --> 01:23:39.299
And we find that it does adequately describe the educational program and the multiple required elements, noting we found one element that required a technical amendment.

01:23:40.679 --> 01:24:01.211
With that, the CD recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with one condition, which I'll note, and a technical amendment, the request for a material revision of the Celerity-Hemalia Charter under the oversight of the State Board for the remainder of the charter term, effective July 1st, 2017 through June 30th, 2021.

01:24:01.792 --> 01:24:06.995
As part of the approval, we recommend that if you recall, there was a condition that we recommended

01:24:07.495 --> 01:24:13.183
the original petition, and we feel that it's still necessary and prudent to maintain that condition.

01:24:13.584 --> 01:24:15.586
But we have revised it slightly.

01:24:15.606 --> 01:24:17.189
It was slightly modified.

01:24:17.269 --> 01:24:18.310
We've removed global.

01:24:19.011 --> 01:24:22.977
And so it reads now, CEG may only continue to contract with affiliates

01:24:23.117 --> 01:24:46.350
for goods and our services if CEG and the affiliates agree to timely respond to all CD inquiries and to the operations of CEG, any affiliates including but not limited to management, fiscal personnel, procurement facilities, operation and financing, and programmatic services in accordance with Education Code 47604.3.

01:24:49.472 --> 01:24:56.436
and fully cooperate with any investigation to their operations conducted pursuant to Education Code 47604.4.

01:24:56.997 --> 01:24:59.999
This condition will remain in effect for the term of the Charter.

01:25:00.279 --> 01:25:04.141
So we just want to maintain that original condition that the State Board approved.

01:25:05.342 --> 01:25:12.346
So representatives from the Charter School are here to address the State Board and I can answer any questions that you have as well.

01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:14.191
Thank you.

01:25:14.511 --> 01:25:19.156
Board, technical questions on anything Cindy has covered at this point?

01:25:21.018 --> 01:25:22.860
Seeing none, I'll open the public hearing.

01:25:23.621 --> 01:25:28.486
Public hearing is open and we, both sides have 10 minutes in the public hearing.

01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:35.053
And the, I'll start with the petitioners for the approval of the material amendment.

01:26:26.377 --> 01:26:26.777
Good morning.

01:26:27.318 --> 01:26:32.801
My name is Grace Canada and I have the honor and pleasure of serving as the CEO for Solarity Educational Group.

01:26:33.561 --> 01:26:36.523
Next to me is Nadia Shaikh, our Chief Academic Officer.

01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:45.979
I'm going to speak to you today about operational and governance improvements, and Nadia will address our request for expansion of enrollment and grade levels.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:57.043
Before turning to the governance issues, I want to remind you that Celerity succeeds where so many others fail, from South Los Angeles to the Valley.

01:26:58.243 --> 01:27:00.404
Our schools outperformed LAUSD.

01:27:00.844 --> 01:27:04.305
The county and state averages in both math and ELA on the 2016 CASP.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:15.850
And we are proud to be recently featured in CDE's own youth voice and leadership and safe and supporting environment videos, expanded learning videos.

01:27:17.371 --> 01:27:24.334
But the accolades and numbers, like the recent Stanford report highlighted in this slide, only tell half the story.

01:27:25.395 --> 01:27:32.118
We invite each of you to visit our schools so you can see for yourselves what makes Celerity so special.

01:27:33.917 --> 01:27:35.258
On to why we're here today.

01:27:36.178 --> 01:27:48.425
Celerity Educational Group, which I will often refer to by its acronym CEG, is requesting a material revision to its charter to reflect a separation from Celerity Global Development.

01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:55.094
I will get into the details in a minute of how we've separated, but I just want to convey the big picture.

01:27:55.114 --> 01:27:57.918
It is a new day at Celerity.

01:27:58.879 --> 01:28:01.643
We have terminated our relationship with Celerity Global.

01:28:02.925 --> 01:28:05.989
Celerity's board is also making changes in senior leadership.

01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:24.019
As mentioned to the commissioners at the ACCS and with staff, I plan to step aside as CEO as we near the completion of this transition and let new leadership alongside our current leadership, such as Nadia, write the next chapter of Celerity's story.

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:34.067
I am of course committed to helping our new leaders to manage and work through this transition period and for our schools to continue to run smoothly.

01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:41.193
The board and our leadership are also committed to continuing to work closely with our authorizers.

01:28:42.013 --> 01:28:52.602
To that end, we are particularly proud that the ACCS, CDE staff, and LAUSD, just on Tuesday, have all reacted positively to the changes that we've made

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.802
Now to the details of what we've already done.

01:28:57.442 --> 01:29:02.266
As you may recall, CEG previously had two connections with Celerity Global Development.

01:29:03.207 --> 01:29:10.072
First, Global was CEG's parent organization, so to speak, or to be more precise, the sole member of CEG.

01:29:10.792 --> 01:29:12.673
That has been terminated completely.

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:19.438
There is no longer any corporate relationship whatsoever between us, CEG, and Global.

01:29:20.799 --> 01:29:26.582
The second component was that Global provided a suite of services to CEG through contracts.

01:29:27.343 --> 01:29:27.803
No more.

01:29:28.203 --> 01:29:37.388
By October 1st, 2017, we will not be receiving any services from Global, or for that matter, any affiliate, Global affiliate.

01:29:38.897 --> 01:29:48.362
To fill in the services previously provided by Global and Global Affiliates, we are utilizing both outside vendors and ramping up our own staff and capabilities.

01:29:49.103 --> 01:29:59.389
On the vendor front, we have made swift but careful progress leading to our board's approval earlier this month of vendors for back office, payroll, PR, and E-rate.

01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:01.931
The process we followed was thorough.

01:30:02.492 --> 01:30:03.873
We had a public RFP.

01:30:04.433 --> 01:30:13.983
The proposals were then reviewed by staff, presented to the Audit and Compliance Committee, and then presented to the board, recommended to the board for approval.

01:30:14.463 --> 01:30:16.585
The board examined them and approved the vendors.

01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:20.367
We've also been bringing some components in-house.

01:30:20.968 --> 01:30:31.293
We've filled eight key positions and are busy interviewing additional candidates for a new general counsel position and to continue our renowned performing arts program.

01:30:32.053 --> 01:30:36.836
Simply put, we are ready and excited about this next chapter in the Celerity story.

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:41.041
We are also proud of our efforts to enhance oversight.

01:30:41.662 --> 01:30:53.932
In May, the CEG's board created an Audit and Compliance Committee that will oversee our internal controls, policies, and risk management, our auditors and the auditing process, among other things.

01:30:54.772 --> 01:31:06.142
Indeed, the committee has been particularly busy over the last few months as they have been meeting regularly, twice sometimes twice a week, to oversee the process of this transition away from global.

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:22.228
We believe that these efforts at reform will not only make Celerity a better and stronger organization, but will also allow us to go back to WASC and get all of our schools accredited, including the schools before you today, Rolas and Himalaya.

01:31:22.768 --> 01:31:34.855
As you know well, our academic successes are undeniable, and with the changes we've made over the last few months, we believe our schools will be in a great position to obtain WASC's mark of excellence.

01:31:36.036 --> 01:31:49.082
With that, I turn this over to Nadia to discuss our recent request for increases in the number of students and grade levels so that we can offer to our many students and parents who want a celerity education.

01:31:51.063 --> 01:31:51.703
Thank you, Grace.

01:31:52.364 --> 01:31:57.826
As Grace mentioned, there's a strong demand for celerity schools because of our reputation for academic excellence.

01:31:58.567 --> 01:32:03.389
That demand is best exemplified by Himalaya, our new school in South Los Angeles.

01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:11.247
We're already at capacity at Himalaya with 479 students in school and learning as we speak.

01:32:12.248 --> 01:32:22.259
But we have 223 more elementary students on the wait list and we have 229 middle school students ready to enroll if we're allowed to add grades 6 through 8.

01:32:24.178 --> 01:32:27.921
The staggering demand only surfaced at the start of the school year approached.

01:32:28.722 --> 01:32:37.189
At the beginning of the process, we only received 236 applications, and most of those dropped out due to uncertainty about Prop 39 space.

01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:48.199
But after dyads sadly closed and parents started researching their local options, demand grew substantially, leading to where we are today, filled with a long waiting list.

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:54.100
We'd love to accommodate these students and give them the first rate education they deserve.

01:32:54.722 --> 01:32:58.290
We have the teachers, the facilities, and the resources ready to do that.

01:33:00.464 --> 01:33:05.968
I wanted to end our presentation with a story about a seventh grade student and her mother, who I met about a month ago.

01:33:07.829 --> 01:33:13.533
When Dyad closed, the mother looked around at the local options and decided her daughter could not attend.

01:33:14.173 --> 01:33:20.938
Putting aside the poor academics, she feared for her daughter's safety at schools where gangs and drugs were prevalent.

01:33:21.858 --> 01:33:26.222
So she decided to enroll her daughter at Celerity Nascent, our sister school, which is half an hour away.

01:33:27.003 --> 01:33:32.187
In order to do that, she had to drop her first child off at Himalaya and then drive over to Nascent.

01:33:32.928 --> 01:33:36.571
The family was waking up earlier, getting home later.

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:44.899
The mother, she works an hourly shift and actually asked for less hours so she could make the drive, which was a financial strain on the family.

01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:49.481
But when I asked her about it, she said it's worth it for a celerity education.

01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:55.763
We have a group of parents who were considering pitching and renting a bus in order to get over to Nascent.

01:33:57.204 --> 01:34:11.190
When I asked that mother what she wanted me to convey for her, she asked just to request to the board to open a middle school at Himalaya so that the parents and students have a celerity school in their backyard where they should be.

01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.370
Thank you.

01:34:13.151 --> 01:34:13.451
Thank you.

01:34:14.957 --> 01:34:15.697
Okay, thank you.

01:34:16.457 --> 01:34:20.638
So now we're ready for 10 minutes for the opponents to the material revision.

01:34:24.639 --> 01:34:33.220
Seeing no opponents, I declare the public hearing closed and I think we'll take public comment and then proceed to our discussion.

01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.821
Will the following people please line up to speak for item 20?

01:34:38.981 --> 01:34:43.282
Sheba Gillis, Carla Labadors, and Patrick Stickley.

01:34:57.912 --> 01:34:58.372
Good morning.

01:35:00.955 --> 01:35:05.760
My name is Atrella Gillis, and I am the Director of Expanded Learning at Celerity Educational Group.

01:35:06.521 --> 01:35:13.648
I've been with Celerity for 10 years, and in that time I've been a teacher, a curriculum specialist, a principal, and currently the Director of Expanded Learning.

01:35:14.488 --> 01:35:21.736
I'd like to talk to you today and appeal to you to approve the addition of middle school to Celerity Himaya and later Celerity Rolas.

01:35:22.529 --> 01:35:34.995
I can attest firsthand to the passion and to the dedication that is poured into every single Celerity student to ensure that their exposure is broadened, their goals are heightened, and that their dreams become a reality.

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:40.578
The sense of community within a Celerity campus, within a Celerity school, goes beyond the classroom.

01:35:41.438 --> 01:35:47.141
My colleagues and I have mentored former students through high school, undergrad, and now even graduate school.

01:35:48.121 --> 01:36:04.214
I ask today that you approve the addition of grades six through eight as celerity homalia, so the students in middle school have the opportunity that our former students have had, the opportunity to learn and to grow in an environment that is centered on their academic success, but also cultivates them.

01:36:04.854 --> 01:36:07.316
Thank you to become conscious members of our society.

01:36:07.577 --> 01:36:07.937
Thank you.

01:36:16.468 --> 01:36:18.369
Good morning, dear board members.

01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:21.271
My name is Carla Lavadores and I have two children.

01:36:21.872 --> 01:36:25.674
One of them is in third grade at Celerity Amalia Charter School.

01:36:26.154 --> 01:36:29.917
Today, I would like to share my point of view as a parent.

01:36:30.737 --> 01:36:33.299
We live in South Central Lake, South Central.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:42.715
What I can assure you is that there is a big difference between our school, Celerity Himalaya, and any other schools.

01:36:43.456 --> 01:36:52.541
Within our community, students and parents attending Celerity Himalaya can confirm the greatness of his small community school.

01:36:53.302 --> 01:37:01.347
Today, I would like to ask from you, esteemed, I'm sorry, esteemed board members, if you value

01:37:01.852 --> 01:37:14.080
the education of our children, please allow grades six through eight be open since my son needs a school that will challenge him and bring out his potential.

01:37:14.621 --> 01:37:18.483
Myself and our community will be grateful forever.

01:37:18.844 --> 01:37:19.164
Thank you.

01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:27.821
Good morning board members.

01:37:27.881 --> 01:37:31.684
My name is Patrick Stickley, and I'm the principal of Celerity Himalaya Charter School.

01:37:32.364 --> 01:37:38.028
We opened our doors on August 15th, 479 students, kinder through fifth grades.

01:37:38.448 --> 01:37:40.049
And we also have a wait list, as Ms.

01:37:40.089 --> 01:37:44.652
Scheich said, of more than 100 students, more than 200 students for our middle school.

01:37:45.313 --> 01:37:49.455
Middle school students such as Alfredo, Sadie, and John.

01:37:50.316 --> 01:37:55.700
In addition to their parents, they're hoping that Celerity Himalaya's material revision is approved today.

01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:01.582
so that they have a choice where to complete their middle school academic career.

01:38:01.982 --> 01:38:03.323
They have stopped by the office.

01:38:03.703 --> 01:38:06.544
They've called in and said, hey, how are things going?

01:38:06.865 --> 01:38:08.385
What's the progress of the request?

01:38:08.985 --> 01:38:15.568
I believe those families have decided on Solarity Himalaya because of our successful academic program and the safety of our campuses.

01:38:16.068 --> 01:38:19.310
With your approval of Solarity Himalaya's material revision today,

01:38:19.890 --> 01:38:26.176
It will enable California students in South Los Angeles to choose where they experience their middle school education.

01:38:26.557 --> 01:38:26.837
Thank you.

01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:35.110
Eric Premack, CSDC.

01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:38.971
I also just wanted to echo everybody's comments with respect to Ms.

01:38:39.011 --> 01:38:39.352
Chan.

01:38:39.412 --> 01:38:41.132
She's done fantastic work here.

01:38:41.812 --> 01:38:48.274
And I know that when I get into an argument with her, I'm going to have a real problem because she's always fact-based and a straight shooter.

01:38:49.534 --> 01:38:59.177
And she's had, I think, the two hardest jobs in the department here, running the apportionments unit that doles out the big money to school districts and the charter directorship, although Carrick's job may be harder.

01:39:01.057 --> 01:39:07.686
strongly support the amendments here, commend Solarity on their work to streamline what was a pretty complicated governance structure.

01:39:08.407 --> 01:39:19.140
I wanted to shift back to the prior item and just go on the record saying that it's been our long understanding for over 20 years that there's no requirement at all for a charter school to have a school site council.

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:22.742
That was the whole idea of the charter school block grant funding system.

01:39:23.282 --> 01:39:27.664
And we've been kind of playing a little game of bureaucratic whack-a-mole on a whole bunch of issues.

01:39:27.784 --> 01:39:31.306
And this is just one of maybe 20 or 30 of them hanging out there.

01:39:32.286 --> 01:39:34.967
I see a few nods up there and hope that we can clean that up.

01:39:35.067 --> 01:39:35.388
Thank you.

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:46.033
Michelle Lynch on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association, also here in support of this material revision today.

01:39:46.273 --> 01:39:46.573
Thank you.

01:39:48.956 --> 01:39:50.557
concludes the public testimony.

01:39:50.697 --> 01:39:55.020
So, Board Member Holiday, do you want to make remarks now or defer?

01:39:58.703 --> 01:40:18.037
So, I think Solarity Education Group heard this board very clearly with our concerns in the past and have stepped up through this material revision to make the changes that would provide the transparency and the clarity of the governance structure.

01:40:19.397 --> 01:40:22.079
I commend them for taking these steps.

01:40:22.699 --> 01:40:32.084
I think that it shows a tremendous focus and dedication to their students and to their families and to their educational program.

01:40:33.005 --> 01:40:45.872
This is in some ways above and beyond potentially what might have been required, but they have certainly taken the bull by the horns and made these changes.

01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:58.483
That being said, I do also want to add that Member Williams and I have been learning a lot about non-profit governance structures over the past few months.

01:40:59.306 --> 01:41:02.427
And I thought I knew quite a bit about them, but I'm learning more and more.

01:41:03.388 --> 01:41:15.652
And I hope that Member Williams and I will be able to provide this board with further information should non-profit governance structures become an issue moving down the road.

01:41:16.632 --> 01:41:18.033
In this case, once again,

01:41:18.933 --> 01:41:29.762
I commend Solarity Education Group for taking the stand for making these changes and bringing them as a material revision to the board and I would move the CDE recommendation.

01:41:29.782 --> 01:41:32.064
Is there a second?

01:41:33.685 --> 01:41:34.125
I'll second.

01:41:34.866 --> 01:41:35.006
Okay.

01:41:36.727 --> 01:41:39.790
Yes, yeah, we're ready for board member comments.

01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:40.570
I have one too.

01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:40.911
Go ahead.

01:41:42.699 --> 01:41:44.379
Well, I actually have two.

01:41:44.639 --> 01:41:55.741
One is, as I recall, part of our issue with the other, the two that we turned down had to do with law enforcement activity surrounding celerity.

01:41:55.881 --> 01:42:00.142
And so I don't know if there's a question for you, Cindy, in your review or not.

01:42:00.882 --> 01:42:09.404
But I'm not clear whether that law enforcement activity was directed at the schools, because this is where we got into this entanglement of these

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:17.874
various entities or was directed at the corporation, this whole statutory.

01:42:18.274 --> 01:42:32.102
And whether or not in the review of this material revision, you were able to get any clarity about what that raid was about, what the status of it is, whether it has any impact on these schools going forward.

01:42:32.122 --> 01:42:33.222
That's my first question.

01:42:33.242 --> 01:42:34.783
I'll ask both of them while you're here.

01:42:35.203 --> 01:42:39.306
And then the second one is, the one that's troubling to me is the WASC status.

01:42:40.647 --> 01:42:56.381
And it's there's just a little paragraph in our item and then it's left and said I appreciate the school Directly responding to it, but but that's a pretty big deal to have your accreditation withdrawn So anyway, if you could address those two

01:42:56.801 --> 01:43:01.644
So we had reached out to both federal agencies.

01:43:02.045 --> 01:43:04.366
And again, this was all based on media.

01:43:04.907 --> 01:43:12.372
But Solarity stepped up and did notify us that they were approached and had to provide records.

01:43:12.412 --> 01:43:13.773
So we reached out to the agency.

01:43:13.813 --> 01:43:18.996
We also reached out to LAUSD's Office of Inspector General, which is different.

01:43:19.036 --> 01:43:19.697
That's their own.

01:43:20.097 --> 01:43:23.758
inspection agency, and we weren't given any updates.

01:43:23.818 --> 01:43:28.340
I mean, it's pretty much sort of a sealed secret kind of review.

01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:30.701
I mean, they don't share anything publicly until they're done.

01:43:31.081 --> 01:43:33.842
So as far as we know, we don't know the status of it.

01:43:33.962 --> 01:43:37.743
I think the school had updated at one point saying they hadn't heard anything.

01:43:38.704 --> 01:43:46.733
We did ask for, because they didn't know what the scope of the investigation was, so we asked for, well, what did they take?

01:43:46.853 --> 01:43:48.916
What kind of records did they take to give us an idea?

01:43:48.976 --> 01:43:53.021
And off the top of my head, it appeared to be nothing to do with the school.

01:43:53.101 --> 01:43:54.282
There were no school records.

01:43:54.362 --> 01:43:55.784
It was all administration.

01:43:55.804 --> 01:43:57.926
It looked to be more of the

01:43:59.188 --> 01:44:04.173
of the work with Global, more of the CMO work.

01:44:04.393 --> 01:44:10.320
It was more those kinds of records, so nothing to do with pupils or the actual charter school itself.

01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.362
And that's as much as we could get.

01:44:12.382 --> 01:44:17.688
In terms of the WASC letter, I mean, in reading through the last, I think,

01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:24.834
letter that was sent to the charter school, it appeared to be a lot of it to do with the raid.

01:44:24.854 --> 01:44:30.098
You know, the fact that that happened and they couldn't answer anything.

01:44:30.218 --> 01:44:40.405
And then I think, and Celerity will have to speak to this, I think WASC asked for some sort of audit, which I don't know if it was done or if they had even gone out and

01:44:41.426 --> 01:44:42.327
try to get one.

01:44:42.367 --> 01:44:48.210
And I think maybe it was to help WASC get a sense of, you know, their operations.

01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:52.492
So we did put that in there because we thought it was important.

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:54.834
Again, you know, these are middle, it's middle school.

01:44:54.914 --> 01:44:59.296
So, I mean, it has a little less impact than the high school and a high school would.

01:44:59.796 --> 01:45:02.558
But we did ask Solarity to kind of address that.

01:45:02.578 --> 01:45:05.600
And so they did in their PowerPoint, like, what are you going to do moving forward?

01:45:05.640 --> 01:45:06.020
And I think

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:12.784
there is an appeal process for the charter school and I think they were looking at whether they would move forward and do that or not.

01:45:12.864 --> 01:45:22.049
So at the time that was something that their board was considering and they were going to update, you know, you all here on what their plan is moving forward.

01:45:25.811 --> 01:45:27.832
I have a follow-up question to that which is,

01:45:29.147 --> 01:45:36.751
The Los Angeles Unified School Board heard Solarity and it seemed to go reasonably well.

01:45:37.171 --> 01:45:38.712
Do you have any comment on that?

01:45:39.432 --> 01:45:42.994
Tuesday night they, no?

01:45:43.214 --> 01:45:46.116
Maybe, well, okay.

01:45:47.967 --> 01:45:48.267
All right.

01:45:48.307 --> 01:45:52.493
There's articles about they're considered, it seemed to be positive to me.

01:45:53.955 --> 01:45:55.897
Could Solarity comment on it?

01:45:55.977 --> 01:46:05.409
I realize that it's your viewpoint, but I think it's worth the board hearing that there was a local school board that considered this quite deeply on Tuesday night.

01:46:05.925 --> 01:46:10.287
Yes, we were at the LAUSD building on Tuesday evening.

01:46:11.508 --> 01:46:17.151
We presented the material visions for our four schools that are authorized by LAUSD.

01:46:18.611 --> 01:46:19.692
I believe it went well.

01:46:19.952 --> 01:46:24.695
We received a 7-0 vote in support of the material revision.

01:46:26.636 --> 01:46:27.436
Was there anything else?

01:46:28.737 --> 01:46:32.538
You know, all I've read is the media, which confirms what you're saying.

01:46:32.599 --> 01:46:35.340
And even some of your critics voted for 7-0, right?

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:36.521
Yes, it was 7-0.

01:46:36.581 --> 01:46:37.101
Absolutely.

01:46:37.221 --> 01:46:44.466
I think that's important for the record for people to know that that happened at the local level, which is OK.

01:46:44.486 --> 01:46:46.507
I think board member Rucker was next.

01:46:47.108 --> 01:46:49.870
Well, as always, I'm happy when I follow board member Burr.

01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:53.392
She asked two of the questions that I had some concern about.

01:46:53.412 --> 01:46:58.575
I do have a couple of other questions and I did want to talk to the outgoing CEO.

01:46:58.635 --> 01:47:00.997
I have a couple of questions for you on this.

01:47:01.237 --> 01:47:02.378
First of all, congratulate.

01:47:02.418 --> 01:47:03.659
I was also going to comment about

01:47:04.199 --> 01:47:09.626
the success of your conversation with the LAUSD school board.

01:47:10.266 --> 01:47:15.813
And in your presentation, you talked about the fact that you will be resigning your current position.

01:47:16.834 --> 01:47:21.239
Will you be continuing in any way in work, continuing to work with the charter school?

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:25.521
I'm committed to transitioning Nadia Shaik in.

01:47:26.422 --> 01:47:33.084
The specifics, the specific details, we are still needing to work out the details of that.

01:47:33.144 --> 01:47:40.087
So then when that transition is done, you will... I will no longer be at Celerity Educational Group, no.

01:47:41.196 --> 01:47:44.159
My other question is concerning the WASC accreditation.

01:47:44.620 --> 01:48:01.357
Are you, what is your plan or what is, and this may be something beyond the scope of your, the balance of your tenure, but is there a plan to address how the accreditation will be restored or the work that you'll do with WASC?

01:48:01.957 --> 01:48:04.260
I appreciate that Cindy explained what kind of

01:48:05.672 --> 01:48:09.896
documents were actually the source of what was requested in this investigation.

01:48:10.376 --> 01:48:18.964
And the investigation is proceeding through no fault of your own and it's not your fault either that it's non-public that they're doing their investigation behind closed doors.

01:48:19.404 --> 01:48:31.495
But we can draw some conclusions from the types of documents or the types of information that they asked for that what is not in question or what is not under review probably is not

01:48:31.915 --> 01:48:35.919
the school program or the services you're providing to students.

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:45.509
And I suspect that in some ways, the decision that WASC made to review and remove the accreditation wasn't

01:48:47.182 --> 01:48:53.046
I'm going to say this word on purpose, knee-jerk reaction to what happened with the investigation and the criminal proceedings.

01:48:53.566 --> 01:48:58.810
And so I believe that at some point in time, they may come to that conclusion as well.

01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:08.116
But how are you, is there a plan to help them to understand or come to that conclusion so that they can make the determination to restore their accreditation?

01:49:08.536 --> 01:49:09.376
Yeah, absolutely.

01:49:09.497 --> 01:49:20.542
So the CEG board has met to discuss WASC and is planning on focusing on the reapplication process and is planning to.

01:49:21.783 --> 01:49:34.689
We're confident that the changes that we're talking about today, the governance and the termination of the contracts are all, will be, will help in that reapplication process.

01:49:35.757 --> 01:49:35.897
Okay.

01:49:35.937 --> 01:49:36.638
All right.

01:49:36.958 --> 01:49:37.318
Thank you.

01:49:37.338 --> 01:49:37.738
Thank you.

01:49:38.099 --> 01:49:38.399
Thank you.

01:49:38.519 --> 01:49:44.603
And let me just say to my colleagues on the board, this is this charter item and the other two items we looked at.

01:49:44.623 --> 01:49:53.109
This is some of the messiness that comes with dealing with innovation and taking on the responsibility of monitoring and oversight.

01:49:53.629 --> 01:50:01.455
And while it is a lot of work and it does take up a lot of time, it's important to do that work and it's important to take that time

01:50:01.895 --> 01:50:02.735
to do those things.

01:50:02.795 --> 01:50:04.996
It's an exercise of our due diligence.

01:50:05.376 --> 01:50:12.239
If we want to choose to lead and innovate, we have to choose to take the time to deal with the messiness.

01:50:12.659 --> 01:50:26.184
So, I have to just say, because I was one of those folks, when this whole conversation started, who asked a lot of questions and who made it clear that I didn't understand, I smelled a rat,

01:50:27.424 --> 01:50:34.368
I appreciate, for my colleagues, your patience in allowing me to ask those questions and allowing me to disagree.

01:50:34.848 --> 01:50:42.312
And I think what we did in going through this messiness and in dealing with this problem, we modeled how adults have disagreements.

01:50:42.672 --> 01:50:54.215
how adults have conversation about some of those really tough things and how a mature policy conversation where we have to struggle actually should play out in a public forum.

01:50:54.255 --> 01:51:02.336
So, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the board for the work and the diligence we exercised in investigating and looking into this.

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.477
Yes, Ortiz will come on.

01:51:07.046 --> 01:51:07.426
Thank you.

01:51:08.426 --> 01:51:15.128
I think that Solarity is taking the right steps to address some of the concerns that we all voiced in our previous meeting.

01:51:15.648 --> 01:51:28.812
But I wanted to ask specifically, I know that you severance your relationship with Solarity Educational Group, but specifically McFarland, is there any way, any role that she will play moving forward

01:51:29.432 --> 01:51:33.335
And is it possible for us to specifically call out the name?

01:51:33.375 --> 01:51:43.861
Because I've seen where there's bodies at, you know, severance relationships and then they start, they come back in a different group, in a different consulting capacity, under a different name.

01:51:44.282 --> 01:51:55.409
And so I want to make sure that because that is the root of a lot of these issues, that we do specify this person and any contract consulting with this particular person or any

01:51:56.429 --> 01:52:01.453
organization that she represents could also be part of our disclaimers in our technical amendment.

01:52:01.953 --> 01:52:07.176
And I'm wondering if the school could answer, is there any role that you foresee for this person moving forward?

01:52:08.577 --> 01:52:09.698
I want to hear them say no.

01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:15.241
So, Ms.

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:21.164
McFarland does not have any current role with CEG and the board is clear.

01:52:22.625 --> 01:52:27.388
The answer is no, moving forward, no role moving forward with Ms.

01:52:27.408 --> 01:52:29.429
McFarland or global or global affiliates.

01:52:31.150 --> 01:52:36.092
That was also an issue addressed by the Los Angeles Unified School District in quite a bit of depth.

01:52:39.754 --> 01:52:41.215
Okay, board member Valdez.

01:52:44.630 --> 01:52:46.352
So I just conferred with Judy.

01:52:46.372 --> 01:52:54.601
I mean we had, that was one reason why we left the condition in there because the whole plan, the transition plan is still sort of rolling out.

01:52:55.762 --> 01:52:58.846
The school hasn't yet opened, so this will be our first kind of

01:52:59.506 --> 01:53:01.787
opportunity to work on oversight with the school.

01:53:01.827 --> 01:53:05.769
And so just as for prudence, we maintain the condition.

01:53:05.829 --> 01:53:08.450
We did remove global, but we left affiliates in there.

01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:14.092
We should still cover it, but we could include an individual in the condition.

01:53:15.012 --> 01:53:18.333
I think we'd have to, we can just add to the affiliates.

01:53:22.183 --> 01:53:25.384
Well, I think the condition is pretty overarching and broad.

01:53:25.424 --> 01:53:30.026
I don't think it's necessary to call out anything more specific.

01:53:30.166 --> 01:53:35.828
But if that is something that the board requires, I would have no objection.

01:53:35.908 --> 01:53:37.329
But, pardon me?

01:53:39.796 --> 01:53:44.537
I just wanted to follow up before you make your motion and to vote.

01:53:44.977 --> 01:53:46.458
I did find the documents.

01:53:46.518 --> 01:53:50.859
I just wanted to kind of read them off the things that in the raid that they took.

01:53:51.359 --> 01:53:57.441
Business records including, for example, contracts, lease agreements, personnel listings, employee registers.

01:53:58.101 --> 01:54:13.616
grant applications, board meeting minutes, memoranda, administrative records, insurance quotes, travel records, draft budget proposals, organization chart, articles of incorporation, and then financial and accounting records including

01:54:14.116 --> 01:54:26.765
For example, payroll records, receipts, invoices, billing statements, bank account records, credit card records, check ledgers and photocopies, wire transfer documents, tax records and financial audit documents.

01:54:26.805 --> 01:54:35.731
So that's what the Charter School provided to us, saying these were the types of records that we had to provide to the federal and LAUSD OIG agencies.

01:54:36.212 --> 01:54:38.013
So that was the specific response.

01:54:40.438 --> 01:54:41.319
Board Member Valdez.

01:54:41.679 --> 01:54:41.979
Thank you.

01:54:42.059 --> 01:54:47.743
So I appreciate the reorganization and the real true listening to some of the recommendations and conversations that were happening.

01:54:47.763 --> 01:54:54.168
So one other point of clarification is what is the structure of the governing board look like and is there a community member on it?

01:54:54.568 --> 01:55:01.994
And are these the same board members that they had when we either didn't go forward with the last two schools at the May meeting?

01:55:02.014 --> 01:55:03.855
I'll have to look at that.

01:55:03.975 --> 01:55:04.315
I don't know.

01:55:04.936 --> 01:55:07.338
Grace, can you answer that while I'm looking this up?

01:55:15.169 --> 01:55:22.775
The current CEG board members, the five board members are still the same board members.

01:55:23.816 --> 01:55:39.348
But I do know that the CEG board and we've expressed to CDE staff here as well as LAUSD is willing to work with authorizers to add new members or work with authorizers to change that if necessary.

01:55:39.468 --> 01:55:42.431
But currently it is the same five members.

01:55:45.733 --> 01:55:46.714
Can I build on that?

01:55:46.754 --> 01:55:48.634
Did you, did you change?

01:55:48.754 --> 01:55:51.595
I thought in May you talked about some board members being new.

01:55:52.336 --> 01:56:00.119
No, so there was an audit and compliance committee created with three members on that committee.

01:56:01.059 --> 01:56:03.780
Kurt Hessler, Ron Ben-Yehuda and Francisco Mares.

01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:10.983
And so that is the sort of subcommittee or committee that is overseeing this entire transition.

01:56:12.404 --> 01:56:15.967
and then they report back up to the CEG board.

01:56:17.169 --> 01:56:18.630
Member Valdez, did you have another question?

01:56:19.771 --> 01:56:20.091
Okay.

01:56:23.094 --> 01:56:23.715
Member Holliday.

01:56:23.735 --> 01:56:28.379
Again, I did make a motion earlier but preemptive strike that didn't work.

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:33.424
So I would like to move the CDE recommendation.

01:56:35.231 --> 01:56:35.591
Second.

01:56:38.152 --> 01:56:38.453
No, no.

01:56:38.533 --> 01:56:39.833
I'm asking if there's a second.

01:56:40.254 --> 01:56:41.014
I'll second.

01:56:41.914 --> 01:56:42.194
OK.

01:56:43.015 --> 01:56:43.275
OK.

01:56:43.315 --> 01:56:44.556
Any comments on the motion?

01:56:44.576 --> 01:56:48.157
So we'll take a board member vote.

01:56:49.318 --> 01:56:50.218
All those in favor?

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.360
Passes unanimously.

01:56:55.221 --> 01:56:55.601
Thank you.

01:56:56.822 --> 01:56:57.042
Item 21.

01:56:59.591 --> 01:57:06.917
So item 21 is a request for a material revision from another current State Board of Education authorized charter school.

01:57:06.957 --> 01:57:14.643
Celerity-Rolos Charter was originally denied by LAUSD and the Los Angeles County Board of Education.

01:57:15.884 --> 01:57:23.130
The charter school appealed to the state and was approved by the State Board in November 2016 at the same meeting that Celerity-Jamalia was approved.

01:57:23.610 --> 01:57:38.677
for a five-year term to serve 455 pupils in transitional kindergarten through grade six in its first year of operation, which is in the current year is their first year, increasing to 565 pupils in TK through grade eight by 2020-21.

01:57:40.138 --> 01:57:48.422
Again, the charter school is in year two of a five-year term, but it is in its first year of operation this year, recently opening on August 15th.

01:57:49.642 --> 01:57:51.724
So I'm going to focus just on the material revision.

01:57:51.764 --> 01:57:59.770
This one is pretty much identical to Solarity Himalaya, so just to save you some time, I will just summarize the couple of differences.

01:58:00.250 --> 01:58:15.542
The material revision request is the same, change to governance structure, termination of Solarity Global Development Services contracts, slight increase in pupil enrollment, there is a change to the grade levels offered, and then there's a minor change to facilities.

01:58:16.463 --> 01:58:19.644
So the enrollment differences are really minor.

01:58:19.704 --> 01:58:26.246
There's only about an addition of 25 pupils that they're adding a year.

01:58:26.346 --> 01:58:36.949
But they are adding a couple grade levels earlier, so they're going to add grade seven and grade eight in the current year, and then adding grade eight next year, which is, that's the change from the original.

01:58:37.549 --> 01:58:38.110
petition.

01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:43.757
In terms of the facilities, they're making a change to facilities operations.

01:58:43.817 --> 01:58:54.529
They will occupy two private facilities and one Proposition 39 facility within the LAUSD boundaries that again will serve different clusters of grade levels for the charter school.

01:58:55.570 --> 01:59:05.033
We reviewed the financial plan which was revised with the material revision and we find it to be fiscally viable with projected positive ending fund balances and reserves.

01:59:06.054 --> 01:59:23.040
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools considered the celerity roll loss petition material revision at its August 15th meeting and voted unanimously to recommend that the State Board approve the request for material revision of the celerity roll loss charter as proposed by the CDE.

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:29.524
Again, we are recommending the same condition that we recommended with celerity homalia.

01:59:29.564 --> 01:59:33.407
So if there is any modification to that, you'd want to make the same action on this one.

01:59:33.427 --> 01:59:36.209
And there is the same technical amendment.

01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:40.232
There's a minor technical amendment to dispute resolution in their charter.

01:59:40.852 --> 01:59:48.156
But with that, we would recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing, approve with one condition and the technical amendment.

01:59:48.776 --> 01:59:57.301
The request for material revision of the celerity roll loss charter under the oversight of the State Board for the remainder of the charter term effective July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021.

01:59:57.381 --> 01:59:58.441
Any board member comments before?

02:00:06.828 --> 02:00:08.110
Let's have public comment.

02:00:08.571 --> 02:00:09.032
Public hearing.

02:00:09.052 --> 02:00:10.014
We've got to do the public hearing.

02:00:10.696 --> 02:00:12.239
Well, public hearing, but yeah.

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:12.941
Okay.

02:00:13.021 --> 02:00:14.143
I open the public hearing.

02:00:15.246 --> 02:00:16.608
Each side will have 10 minutes.

02:01:01.035 --> 02:01:02.315
Good morning, my name is Grace Canada.

02:01:02.335 --> 02:01:04.036
I'm the CEO of Solarity Educational Group.

02:01:04.976 --> 02:01:12.740
My portion of this next presentation mirrors that of the previous regarding operational and governance improvements.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:20.123
So if it's okay, I'd like to kick this over to Nadia to talk specifically about Burlesque Charter School.

02:01:21.143 --> 02:01:21.404
Hello.

02:01:22.565 --> 02:01:26.868
Our new ROLAS school is also seeing substantial interest from its community.

02:01:27.348 --> 02:01:35.615
This is particularly true for our middle school, where we have 72 students from the Eagle Rock and Highland Park area who want to attend if we can open these grade levels.

02:01:36.716 --> 02:01:38.758
As with Himalaya, we're ready to serve these students.

02:01:38.998 --> 02:01:44.923
We have what we need, the teachers, the supplies, the resources, and we've carefully planned our school calendar.

02:01:45.363 --> 02:01:47.705
All we need now is the wonderful students in the seat.

02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:50.981
Thank you.

02:01:53.042 --> 02:01:55.504
The opposition will now have 10 minutes.

02:01:57.706 --> 02:01:59.687
Seeing one, we're ready for public comment.

02:02:02.309 --> 02:02:03.710
The following people line up.

02:02:03.750 --> 02:02:04.751
Close the public hearing.

02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:09.394
The following people please line up to speak to item 21.

02:02:09.595 --> 02:02:13.918
Connice Solis, Eric Premack, Michelle Lynch.

02:02:20.936 --> 02:02:25.683
Hello, my name is Karina Solis Robles and I am the principal of Celerity Rural West Charter School.

02:02:25.983 --> 02:02:35.696
I've been with Celerity since 2005 and I'm still here 12 years later because I truly believe this is an organization that supports their teachers, students, and families.

02:02:37.217 --> 02:02:42.801
Solarity Rollas has already in its short existence created a school like no other in Northeast Los Angeles.

02:02:42.881 --> 02:02:51.685
It is one which teachers and staff collaborate to create environments centered on students and their individual needs in which parents are equal and active partners in this journey.

02:02:51.926 --> 02:02:53.987
I want to share a quick story about

02:02:54.847 --> 02:02:58.028
an incoming 8th grade student that is on our wait list.

02:02:58.088 --> 02:03:06.832
The student has been with Celerity School since Kinder and is currently on the wait list for Celerity ROLAS and will enroll if our material revision is approved.

02:03:07.132 --> 02:03:11.114
I spoke with this student last week as he was with his mother to pick up a younger sibling.

02:03:11.974 --> 02:03:14.235
And I asked him, how was it going at his new school?

02:03:14.895 --> 02:03:19.536
The student said he didn't feel welcomed and felt like his teachers at his new schools didn't know him.

02:03:19.977 --> 02:03:24.518
He asked, will I be able to come back to a Solarity school?

02:03:24.938 --> 02:03:28.659
I would love to give this family a call today and tell them, yes.

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:30.380
Thank you so much for your time.

02:03:41.294 --> 02:03:41.534
Okay.

02:03:41.654 --> 02:03:43.536
That's no other comments.

02:03:46.238 --> 02:03:46.578
All right.

02:03:46.938 --> 02:03:47.579
All right.

02:03:48.319 --> 02:03:49.280
Board member Holliday.

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:51.982
You want to make some comments?

02:03:52.963 --> 02:03:53.143
No.

02:03:53.483 --> 02:03:55.245
I would move the CDE recommendation though.

02:03:57.046 --> 02:03:57.666
Is there a second?

02:03:58.727 --> 02:03:59.168
I'll second.

02:04:00.328 --> 02:04:01.369
Board member discussion?

02:04:03.451 --> 02:04:03.951
Seeing none.

02:04:04.071 --> 02:04:05.412
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:04:05.753 --> 02:04:06.173
Okay.

02:04:06.353 --> 02:04:07.374
Carries unanimously.

02:04:08.114 --> 02:04:08.315
All right.

02:04:08.355 --> 02:04:09.956
Now we're up to item

02:04:11.506 --> 02:04:16.710
22 for general public comment that are issues that are not on our agenda.

02:04:19.772 --> 02:04:25.057
Will those signed for public comment please step to the line up.

02:04:35.525 --> 02:04:36.666
Yes, come forward please.

02:04:42.017 --> 02:04:42.437
Good morning.

02:04:43.958 --> 02:04:45.479
My name is Guru Raj Narasimha.

02:04:45.799 --> 02:04:50.321
I'm a resident of Folsom, California for the past 12 years now.

02:04:50.901 --> 02:04:56.023
And two of my children go to school in Sacramento area, when one of them is in the middle school.

02:04:57.124 --> 02:05:08.249
I'm here to talk about the Instructional Quality Commission and the textbook review, the social sciences drafts from HMH, McGraw-Hills, and Discovery

02:05:09.505 --> 02:05:17.915
So I feel that the IQC is working in the best interest of the publishers rather than the public interest, which I'm very much concerned about.

02:05:18.817 --> 02:05:24.243
So there has been a lot of stories of bullying that the public, many of them being children,

02:05:24.904 --> 02:05:25.985
they have shared in the past.

02:05:26.565 --> 02:05:33.389
So they have sat through public testimony, focused on a timer instead of the speaker.

02:05:33.409 --> 02:05:39.312
So a lot of feedback was provided by the review panels and those who are not considered at all.

02:05:39.873 --> 02:05:45.196
And some incorrect instructions were also provided so that the publisher's draft textbooks could get approved.

02:05:46.036 --> 02:05:47.277
I'm hereby requesting.

02:05:48.878 --> 02:05:49.138
Thank you.

02:06:02.078 --> 02:06:11.526
Hi, my name is Chiranth and I am from Folsom, resident of Folsom, and my kid will be going to school from next year.

02:06:12.346 --> 02:06:17.830
And I'm here to express the anguish about the process violations the IQC has committed in 2016 and 17.

02:06:20.212 --> 02:06:25.319
The IQC facilitators pressurized the individual panel members multiple times.

02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:34.890
Many content reviewers have raised concerns over the IQC's protecting the public interest during the panel reviews especially.

02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:37.934
There was explicit push to end early

02:06:38.474 --> 02:06:46.480
on 25th of August and consequently the deliberations were ended a day fully before actually.

02:06:46.601 --> 02:06:48.082
One day was totally cancelled.

02:06:48.842 --> 02:06:54.046
So multiple times the members of the community were stopped by IQC staff from entering the building.

02:06:54.146 --> 02:06:54.347
So

02:06:55.147 --> 02:07:03.749
on one of my case and I went with my friends for like on 11 o'clock, 11 a.m.

02:07:04.630 --> 02:07:06.590
from my office to attend this.

02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:10.991
They did not allow us inside because it was closed early.

02:07:11.432 --> 02:07:12.092
Thanks for listening.

02:07:12.352 --> 02:07:12.832
Thank you very much.

02:07:18.803 --> 02:07:21.345
I know you're all ready to get out, so I'm going to try to do this in a minute.

02:07:23.087 --> 02:07:26.790
I think there's not enough time in a minute to tell you what on earth we're talking about.

02:07:27.171 --> 02:07:30.774
So it's really about the history, social science textbook curriculum.

02:07:31.655 --> 02:07:34.457
And we have a whole group of people protesting at many events.

02:07:35.138 --> 02:07:36.399
But that's not the best way to do things.

02:07:36.559 --> 02:07:39.882
We have to be item number 17 for this discussion.

02:07:39.902 --> 02:07:43.346
So we're going to try to do that after this board meeting, try to see how we can get on that.

02:07:44.046 --> 02:07:48.588
agenda item rather than being part of item 22, where we get a minute.

02:07:49.068 --> 02:07:53.430
So my colleagues here are trying to speak and trying to make an impression in a minute.

02:07:54.610 --> 02:08:06.635
Just telling you that we will come back and reach out to your people, try to get on the board to give you more information on what the problem really is about the curriculum about India and the textbooks.

02:08:07.236 --> 02:08:10.337
We don't want it to be better than what it is, but we don't want it to be wrong.

02:08:11.077 --> 02:08:12.598
And all our attempts seems to be

02:08:13.258 --> 02:08:18.721
just wasting our time and making all of us look bad because you guys have such complicated topics here.

02:08:19.222 --> 02:08:23.464
So we'll do that outside this meeting today.

02:08:23.544 --> 02:08:23.845
Thank you.

02:08:23.865 --> 02:08:25.746
Okay.

02:08:26.446 --> 02:08:26.846
Go ahead.

02:08:29.888 --> 02:08:32.010
I guess that concludes the public comment.

02:08:32.630 --> 02:08:33.450
No more commenters.

02:08:34.291 --> 02:08:34.631
All right.

02:08:34.791 --> 02:08:36.192
So the meeting is... Yeah.

02:08:37.333 --> 02:08:37.533
Yes.

02:08:38.993 --> 02:08:44.917
So Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, when I said my kind words about Cindy Chan before did not have.

02:08:45.336 --> 02:08:47.418
the certificate from the superintendent.

02:08:48.338 --> 02:08:58.546
So I will read just the highlights because there's much information here about Cindy's career, including 31 years of state service.

02:08:59.547 --> 02:09:10.695
But for her commitment to excellence and unparalleled work ethic, her tenacity and attention to detail have served her well throughout her career, allowing her to adroitly manage the most complex

02:09:11.155 --> 02:09:13.157
and sensitive program areas.

02:09:13.517 --> 02:09:20.322
This applies in particular to her work with charter schools and her ability to do multiple board items in very high heels.

02:09:23.905 --> 02:09:25.806
I added that last part myself.

02:09:26.467 --> 02:09:28.268
Superintendent, I'm sure, meant to say that.

02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:30.750
Anyway, again, congratulations.

02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:31.671
Congratulations.

02:09:35.354 --> 02:09:37.135
OK, with that, the board is adjourned.
