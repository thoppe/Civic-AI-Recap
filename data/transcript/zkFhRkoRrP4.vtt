WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.320
Okay, Linda. We're live. All right. Seeing that the board members are now present, I

00:11.320 --> 00:16.640
convened the September 10th, 2020 meeting. Karen, can you please call the roll to establish

00:16.640 --> 00:29.400
a quorum? Sure. Sue? Here. Linda? Here. Zaid? Here. Linda?

00:29.720 --> 00:48.920
Here. Cynthia? Here. Kim? Here. Pat? Here. Kim? Here. Aide? Here. Patricia? Here.

00:48.920 --> 01:02.080
Dean? Here. Ting? Here. All present. All right. I hereby call the September 2020 meeting of the

01:02.080 --> 01:09.080
State Board of Education to order at 846 a.m. and I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

01:09.080 --> 01:15.040
Vice President Strouss, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance? Yes.

01:15.040 --> 01:30.560
Ready, begin. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic

01:30.560 --> 01:39.160
for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:39.640 --> 01:54.320
This is why it's so hard to do a choir on Zoom. Thank you very much. I am delighted to be able

01:54.320 --> 02:02.080
to administer the oath of office to our new student board member, Zaid Fattah, and I'm going

02:02.080 --> 02:12.000
to ask you, please, Zaid, to raise your right hand and repeat after me. I, Zaid Fattah. I,

02:12.000 --> 02:19.960
Zaid Fattah. Do solemnly swear that I will support. Do solemnly swear that I will support. And defend

02:19.960 --> 02:26.640
the Constitution of the United States. And defend the Constitution of the United States. Against all

02:26.800 --> 02:33.360
enemies, foreign and domestic. Against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That I will bear true faith

02:33.360 --> 02:39.000
and allegiance. That I will bear true faith and allegiance. To the Constitution of the United

02:39.000 --> 02:44.360
States. To the Constitution of the United States. And the Constitution of the State of California.

02:44.360 --> 02:51.440
And the Constitution of the State of California. That I take this obligation freely. That I take

02:51.440 --> 02:57.760
this obligation freely. Without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion. Without any

02:57.760 --> 03:04.600
mental reservation or purpose of evasion. And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties.

03:04.600 --> 03:12.200
And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties. Upon which I am about to enter. Upon

03:12.200 --> 03:18.640
which I'm about to enter. Congratulations. Thank you. Welcome. We're delighted to have you here.

03:18.640 --> 03:29.240
And look forward to this year with you. I'm delighted to introduce you now more formally to

03:29.240 --> 03:35.800
Zaid, who is a senior at Monte Vista High School in San Ramon Valley Unified School District. And

03:35.800 --> 03:40.720
would you like to share a little bit about your background so that we'll all get to know you a bit?

03:40.720 --> 03:47.520
Definitely. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, President Darlene Kamen and good morning esteemed

03:47.560 --> 03:52.320
board members and everyone. My name is Zaid Fattah and I'm a senior at Monte Vista High School in

03:52.320 --> 03:57.560
the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. And I am incredibly honored and humbled to serve as

03:57.560 --> 04:02.320
this year's student board member. This past year I served on my district's Local Control and

04:02.320 --> 04:07.680
Accountability Plan Committee, LCAP. And it really changed the way I view education and the importance

04:07.680 --> 04:13.120
of the student voice and the decision making process. It's really hard for me to articulate

04:13.120 --> 04:17.360
how much this position means to me because it's something that I've been thinking about actively

04:17.360 --> 04:21.920
since the eighth grade. I first heard of this position when I was in the eighth grade. I was

04:21.920 --> 04:26.720
at a speech and debate tournament and I watched former board member Jaden Gray deliver an oration

04:26.720 --> 04:32.080
at the speech tournament. And following the round, I kind of heard of this position and I had a chance

04:32.080 --> 04:36.640
to talk to him. And ever since that day, I've kind of had this position at the forefront of my mind.

04:36.640 --> 04:41.280
And so when I got the call from the governor's office a few weeks ago, it was a dream come true,

04:41.280 --> 04:47.120
truly. And so I'm really excited to chart my own path with this position and will truly give it

04:47.440 --> 04:53.920
100% to represent the nearly 6.3 students I represent. Perfect. Thank you very much and

04:53.920 --> 04:59.280
welcome, welcome. I'd also like to announce that this is the last meeting that Chad Owes of the

04:59.280 --> 05:05.920
CDE Executive Office will be serving as the CDE State Board Liaison. He has taken an administrative

05:05.920 --> 05:11.280
position in the Instructional Measurement Branch. We'd like to thank him for all of his coordination

05:11.280 --> 05:15.120
help over these last eight months. We look forward to working with him in his new role.

05:15.840 --> 05:22.480
In addition, I want to share that after serving for seven and a half years, our executive director,

05:22.480 --> 05:28.240
Karen Steph Walters, will leave after today's board meeting. We have a tribute plan for Karen

05:28.240 --> 05:33.360
early this afternoon when we reopen the State Board priorities item after closed session.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.200
She won't be going far. She'll be with the California County executives and we will be

05:41.200 --> 05:46.320
working with her in a new role. And finally, this is the annual time of year when the fall

05:46.320 --> 05:51.760
recruitment for the State Board Advisory Commissions and the 2021-22 student board

05:51.760 --> 05:57.200
member position have begun. And applications can be found on our website and we're recruiting for

05:57.200 --> 06:02.560
the following positions. The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools is seeking applications from

06:02.560 --> 06:07.840
teachers who are employed by charter school. The Advisory Commission on Special Education is

06:07.840 --> 06:13.440
recruiting for three positions. Strong preference will be given to parents of a child or a young

06:13.440 --> 06:18.800
adult with disabilities and to a representative of the charter school community. The California

06:18.800 --> 06:24.160
Practitioners Advisory Group is seeking applications to fill the specialized instructional support

06:24.160 --> 06:28.960
personnel and paraprofessionals position. The Instructional Quality Commission is currently

06:28.960 --> 06:35.840
seeking applications for their 2021-22 student member position. And lastly, the State Board is

06:35.840 --> 06:43.520
currently accepting applications for the 2021-22 State Board student member position. Interested

06:43.520 --> 06:48.480
students who will be high school seniors in good standing in any California public high school

06:48.480 --> 06:55.200
during the 2021-22 school year and are available to participate in a virtual statewide conference,

06:55.200 --> 07:00.960
which is being held from October 31st to November 2nd, are invited to apply for the position of

07:00.960 --> 07:06.000
student member on the California State Board of Education. The final filing date for all

07:06.000 --> 07:13.280
of these positions is 5 o'clock p.m. on Thursday, October the 8th. I do have a change in the agenda

07:13.280 --> 07:19.040
to announce. There's an addendum for item five related to the state seal of civic engagement

07:19.040 --> 07:25.120
evaluation criteria. And as mentioned, we'll reopen item one, which is State Board priorities

07:25.120 --> 07:30.560
following closed session to pay a tribute to our executive director to take action on the

07:30.560 --> 07:36.960
draft minutes and receive the State Board liaison reports. The board will go into closed session

07:36.960 --> 07:41.840
right after the lunch break. And as a reminder to board members, there is a separate Zoom

07:41.840 --> 07:47.760
line and access code set up for the closed session. There is one public hearing on the

07:47.760 --> 07:53.280
agenda, which we will take up this afternoon. Item six is an appeal to transfer territory

07:53.280 --> 08:00.640
from the Lawndale Elementary and Centinella Valley High School districts into Wiseburn Unified.

08:02.080 --> 08:11.680
The proposed waiver consent items are W01 through W03 and W05 through W08. The proposed regular

08:11.680 --> 08:18.400
consent items are items seven through 10. We'll take up both the waiver consent items and the

08:18.400 --> 08:25.040
regular consent items later this afternoon. On public input, members of the public who

08:25.040 --> 08:28.800
are wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting

08:28.800 --> 08:34.160
to know at what time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may be provided

08:34.160 --> 08:39.360
by dialing the phone number and entering a participant access code. Upon dialing in,

08:39.360 --> 08:44.400
callers will be added to a caller queue. The operator will notify callers when it is their

08:44.400 --> 08:49.920
turn to provide public comment. We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume

08:49.920 --> 08:55.680
of their computers if they are following the live webcast to avoid the echoing effect because there

08:55.680 --> 09:02.720
is a slight lag. Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker. Item 11 is the

09:02.720 --> 09:07.440
general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on any matters

09:07.440 --> 09:12.960
that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda. And then I'd like to ask board members

09:12.960 --> 09:18.560
to please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on at all times except

09:18.560 --> 09:23.440
during the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's virtual

09:23.440 --> 09:29.280
meeting. For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand using

09:29.280 --> 09:36.480
the zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment. So agenda item one

09:37.040 --> 09:42.080
is our state board priorities item and we are opening item one to hear the superintendent's

09:42.080 --> 09:47.360
report and the state board president's report at this time only. And then as I mentioned,

09:47.360 --> 09:53.200
we will reopen the item after closed session for the remaining items and I'll now turn it over to

09:53.200 --> 10:00.560
state superintendent Tony Thurmond for his report. Superintendent Thurmond. Thank you, madam president.

10:00.560 --> 10:05.680
Thank you for your leadership in these challenging times. I think we're on zooms and calls almost

10:05.680 --> 10:11.840
always and appreciate your stewardship and leadership during these challenging times.

10:12.640 --> 10:18.800
I'm honored to see all of our board members. I hope that wherever you are, you are safe and well

10:18.800 --> 10:25.280
during these very difficult times and grateful to be able to welcome our new student board member

10:26.320 --> 10:33.440
Fatah. Welcome and great remarks and exciting that you've aspired towards this since you were

10:33.440 --> 10:40.400
in eighth grade. Great speech. Who knows? Perhaps we'll see you at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue sometime

10:40.400 --> 10:46.240
in our near future. So continue to dream and continue to lead and we're excited to have you

10:46.240 --> 10:51.120
here especially since you worked on LCAP. Most people want to run away after they've worked on

10:51.120 --> 10:56.880
LCAP matters and to hear that because it's so complicated but it's important to hear that you

10:56.880 --> 11:03.040
are inspired to want to do more from it. We're grateful to have your perspectives here. I just

11:03.040 --> 11:09.440
want to say how much I'm in awe of what our California schools and everyone in the education

11:09.440 --> 11:16.640
community are doing right now. It goes without saying that we never imagined that we'd find

11:16.640 --> 11:21.760
ourselves in this situation where all of our schools are open, most in distance learning,

11:22.880 --> 11:30.320
trying to deal with the impacts of COVID-19, trying to deal with the impacts of a man-made

11:30.320 --> 11:36.960
pandemic, of racism and police brutality as it plays out on our streets as we watch it and think

11:36.960 --> 11:43.440
of the impact that it has on our students. We know that we need to continue to lead with education

11:43.440 --> 11:50.800
to promote change for all and now to see as our schools finally are in a place where they can open

11:51.520 --> 11:58.400
some in person most in distance learning to add to it fires and issues with air quality on top of

11:58.400 --> 12:04.560
that. Our schools are dealing with the most difficult circumstances. There aren't words to

12:04.560 --> 12:10.000
describe it. Our hearts go out to those who've lost loved ones. Many have lost their home.

12:11.280 --> 12:16.000
We know that in Butte County, which has had its own share of challenges over the years,

12:16.800 --> 12:22.960
we've lost schools. We've lost Berry Creek School that was destroyed. We know that there are other

12:22.960 --> 12:28.480
schools that maybe not fully destroyed have been severely damaged. This is a tough time and this

12:28.480 --> 12:34.240
is a time for us to all lean in and to help in any way that we can. Obviously, we're doing all we can

12:34.240 --> 12:40.480
to defer any kind of requirements that these schools would have to provide. We've met with

12:40.480 --> 12:46.560
all the county superintendents to say that we will expedite any J-13A waiver request. These are the

12:46.560 --> 12:52.720
waivers that school districts who are impacted by disaster can use to be held harmless and to

12:52.720 --> 12:58.720
receive their ADA even when they're dealing with these types of disasters that make it impossible

12:58.720 --> 13:04.720
for our students to be in school. Our team and I have worked on ways to send face coverings

13:04.720 --> 13:11.680
to communities that are impacted. We sent some N95 masks to a community in Tulare County

13:12.320 --> 13:18.000
where many of the children of farm workers have been impacted and their parents as well are working

13:18.000 --> 13:24.880
under the worst air quality conditions that we've probably seen. We know that these challenges

13:25.440 --> 13:32.560
persist and we are doing all we can to offer our support to our school districts but need to

13:32.560 --> 13:38.800
commend our students, their parents and family members, our educators, our administrators,

13:39.520 --> 13:46.240
our entire education community for its resilience under these conditions. On yesterday, we held a

13:46.240 --> 13:52.880
webinar for all 1,000 school districts to go over the latest guidance for when schools can be open

13:52.880 --> 14:00.480
and when they need to be closed. Well over 1,000 participants on that Zoom with lots of great

14:00.480 --> 14:06.960
questions hosted. We hosted it but we're honored to be joined by Ben Chita, the deputy chief cabinet

14:06.960 --> 14:14.000
secretary in the governor's office and by Dr. Erica Pond who leads the team at the California

14:14.000 --> 14:19.520
Department of Public Health. And we are just staying synchronized with our partners in the

14:19.520 --> 14:25.600
health arena to make sure that our schools are getting the information as best that we can get

14:25.600 --> 14:30.240
to them. We continue to work with school districts on making sure that they have the tools that they

14:30.240 --> 14:36.000
need for distance learning. As you know, the governor and the legislature provided a learning

14:36.000 --> 14:42.400
loss mitigation fund that provides $5.3 billion for school districts to use for computing devices,

14:43.280 --> 14:48.480
for counseling programs and social emotional programs, and for training and professional

14:48.480 --> 14:54.000
development for educators around distance learning. And the CDE administers those dollars. We've been

14:54.000 --> 14:59.520
in touch with every district about exactly how much money they can have. We've even tried to

14:59.520 --> 15:05.680
play matchmaker between schools that are looking for computing devices and companies that still

15:05.680 --> 15:10.320
have supply because as you know, there is a worldwide shortage for computing devices

15:11.120 --> 15:17.680
at this time. And so we've inventoried what exists for every manufacturer who has it.

15:18.480 --> 15:23.760
A big shout out to Mary Nicely who has been leading our effort and has almost single-handedly

15:24.880 --> 15:31.440
inventoried what every school district needs and has figured out a way to get distributors like

15:31.440 --> 15:37.440
Office Depot and Staples to hold on devices just for our students. You know, Apple and T-Mobile

15:37.440 --> 15:44.640
have done the same in the face of a shortage of devices. They've held on to hundreds of thousands

15:44.640 --> 15:51.200
of devices for our students that are internet enabled. And so while it is a challenge and

15:51.200 --> 15:56.640
districts are still scrambling, we are leaning all the way in. By this time, I can say that

15:56.640 --> 16:02.160
through our work with a number of partners, we've probably helped to get shipped out hundreds of

16:02.160 --> 16:08.720
thousands of devices to school districts. Many of you have been involved in asking for donations.

16:08.720 --> 16:13.680
Obviously, our board president has been a leader in asking for donations and securing donations.

16:13.680 --> 16:20.560
We've worked very closely with the CBE Foundation, which is a 501C3 that can accept donations

16:21.520 --> 16:27.520
and then move them to the school communities where they are needed. We announced that PG&E

16:27.520 --> 16:34.800
has made a $500,000 contribution through this process to support schools in Humboldt County

16:35.600 --> 16:42.160
who are in deep need of computers. Literally, we are working on these kinds of connections

16:42.160 --> 16:48.000
all across the state. We've reached out to 100 different companies to really ask them to make

16:48.000 --> 16:53.440
financial donations to support our students. We will be announcing in the days to come

16:54.080 --> 16:58.160
many companies who've made donations to help us support tribal communities,

16:58.160 --> 17:02.720
rural communities, urban communities, suburban communities, and frontier communities.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.440
But yet we know the bigger question still looms. How do we create the infrastructure

17:07.440 --> 17:13.440
so there can be broadband in rural communities? And we're working with the legislature and other

17:13.440 --> 17:21.520
entities on how to create a new way for California, how to create innovation that results in helping

17:21.520 --> 17:26.080
California close the digital divide. You'll hear me talk about that quite a bit. I created a task

17:26.080 --> 17:31.040
force on closing the digital divide. As we speak, we're talking with business leaders and technology

17:31.040 --> 17:37.920
leaders to identify how we need to innovate in California to once and for all close the digital

17:37.920 --> 17:42.800
divide. And so these are some of the things that we're continuing to work with our districts on.

17:42.800 --> 17:48.240
The California Department of Education did release new guidance to support moving into

17:48.240 --> 17:52.960
distance learning to make sure that there is a balance between live instruction to make sure

17:52.960 --> 17:58.880
that students are supported. They're seeing their teachers and staff to make sure that there is

17:58.880 --> 18:04.640
content that teachers can use in distance learning. We did a survey asking teachers,

18:04.640 --> 18:09.040
what worked for you during distance learning in the first round? What did it work? What worked

18:09.040 --> 18:13.520
for our students and what didn't work? We've heard from more than 300 teachers across the state who

18:13.520 --> 18:20.000
sent innovative lesson plans and content that we can share with other educators on how to support

18:20.000 --> 18:25.600
our students. I can tell you, I've heard from most, our educators are really leaning in here,

18:25.600 --> 18:31.760
recognizing that while in-person instruction is the most important thing, safety warrants us being

18:31.760 --> 18:35.920
in distance learning and that it's important for us to do things in a way that we can offset

18:36.720 --> 18:42.480
learning gaps that occur and were exacerbated in the first round of distance learning. And so

18:43.120 --> 18:47.600
big shout out to the team at the California Department of Education who put on probably

18:47.600 --> 18:53.600
70 or 80 webinars by now since the first round of distance learning. And to TSD, the division

18:53.600 --> 18:59.440
that's hosting us today, they've hosted all those webinars and they continue to dig deep and to

18:59.440 --> 19:07.280
provide more. You'll hear from some new staff today. Again, we welcome a board member to this

19:07.280 --> 19:12.960
board. You'll hear from some new staff. We're introducing for the first time a new special

19:12.960 --> 19:19.360
education director, Heather Calamiz, who has already started. Heather is previously the

19:19.360 --> 19:24.560
executive director for special education at the Illinois State Department of Education.

19:25.200 --> 19:31.600
Great reputation for work that she has done with a high emphasis on equity and we're excited to

19:31.600 --> 19:38.480
have her join our team. You'll hear from her often in our meetings. We want to thank Chad for

19:38.480 --> 19:44.720
his work as serving in this role as liaison to the State Board of Education. We're grateful that he

19:44.720 --> 19:51.120
will be continuing on at CDE in a new role, working very closely with our deputy superintendent,

19:51.120 --> 19:57.680
Rachel Mage, who we've announced to you, but I want to reintroduce to you today and you'll

19:57.760 --> 20:05.840
hear from her today and you'll hear from her often. She will be presenting to you often because she

20:05.840 --> 20:10.960
oversees the branch that has many of the items that come before the board, like our curriculum

20:10.960 --> 20:16.160
frameworks and assessment, accountability, education data management, and educator

20:16.160 --> 20:20.960
excellence. And so you'll hear her often and we'll be reintroducing her to you today. She's

20:20.960 --> 20:25.600
already leaned in in just a few several weeks that she's been on board and we're excited

20:25.600 --> 20:30.640
to have her here. And I'm happy to tell you of who the new liaison will be to the State Board and

20:30.640 --> 20:37.760
he also is no stranger to you or to CDE. It's Dr. Alex Moos who's been working at the Department of

20:37.760 --> 20:44.960
Education for seven years on our computer science test on our science testing work and he will be

20:44.960 --> 20:52.160
joining us in the new role as liaison to the State Board. And so we are excited to welcome new faces.

20:52.160 --> 20:56.400
I want to acknowledge the new executive director who will join us in Brooks Allen.

20:56.400 --> 21:01.840
I want to acknowledge Deborah Brown in her appointment and I want to say my deep thanks

21:01.840 --> 21:11.280
to Karen Staff Walters who has led with class and grace in the most difficult of times and from whom

21:11.280 --> 21:17.200
I've learned a great deal. You know sometimes she doesn't say anything but she's always saying

21:17.200 --> 21:25.200
something that is useful and helpful to the conversation and if you never get a chance

21:25.200 --> 21:31.280
to do this I suggest that you just ask her what do you think about this problem. Since my days in

21:31.280 --> 21:38.240
the legislature I've had the chance to watch her work through really complicated formulas and

21:38.240 --> 21:44.400
programs and protocols to help our students and I always feel like she gets what's at the heart of

21:44.400 --> 21:48.800
what we do. It's not about the complicated protocols. It's about what we do for our

21:48.800 --> 21:54.160
students. It's about do they lead us towards a positive outcome for our students and I'm

21:54.160 --> 22:00.640
grateful for your servant leadership Karen and while you'll be missed in this role I am grateful

22:00.640 --> 22:06.560
that you're not going far and that we can continue to bug you. I mean consult with you in your new

22:06.560 --> 22:11.600
role at SESSA. So thank you for your service here. Thank you for your service at SESSA.

22:12.240 --> 22:19.840
And Madam President this completes my report. Thank you very much and I co-sign those comments

22:19.840 --> 22:25.600
about Karen knows that I still intend to talk with her regularly as we as we do now.

22:26.400 --> 22:33.040
Well I just want to reinforce a couple of points that State Superintendent Thurman made. We've come

22:33.040 --> 22:38.880
a long way in California in terms of figuring out how to provide high quality distance learning

22:39.760 --> 22:45.600
and the efforts that are underway that were just enumerated about getting closing that digital

22:45.600 --> 22:54.560
divide are continuous. They're persevering. We've been working together as a team to just keep the

22:55.760 --> 23:05.840
resources coming to schools, the connectivity expanding and the devices in that supply chain

23:06.800 --> 23:13.200
challenge moving across and I know there's State Superintendent announced just about a month ago

23:13.200 --> 23:20.000
a million devices from Apple and T-Mobile that will be on their way as soon as we can get through

23:20.000 --> 23:26.640
the supply chain issues. So I believe that we will in fact get to the place where we close the digital

23:26.640 --> 23:34.080
divide soon in this state. Districts have been enormously creative. County offices have been

23:34.080 --> 23:39.840
stepping up to launch a distance learning consortium to provide curriculum units and

23:39.840 --> 23:44.960
lesson plans as well as training for teachers. Districts of course have been doing that.

23:46.160 --> 23:51.760
Many have reached out to parents to say what do you want? What worked for you in the spring? What

23:51.760 --> 23:57.440
do you need? Many have found ways to connect to families in a one-on-one way to figure out what

23:57.440 --> 24:03.920
the specific family needs are. I hope that we continue some of the practices that are

24:04.880 --> 24:12.960
being invented now. It's a time for invention and sharing when we get back to what may never be

24:12.960 --> 24:20.720
regular school as we knew it but what will become the new normal in the schools. Places like

24:20.720 --> 24:31.440
San Diego and Elk Hills really designed their new systems around what parents wanted.

24:32.480 --> 24:38.400
We're hearing from across the state, I'm talking to teachers and superintendents and parents,

24:39.520 --> 24:44.640
what a good start we're off to in distance learning in so many districts this year,

24:44.640 --> 24:52.320
many of them reporting 95, 98, 100% attendance, kids showing up bright and shiny in front of

24:52.320 --> 24:58.720
their computers when they can't be there in person and teachers understanding how to work with them

24:58.720 --> 25:04.160
in and out of the zoom breakout rooms and with projects that are going on and small group

25:04.160 --> 25:08.720
instruction to help kids catch up and one-on-one instruction where it's needed. As you know, the

25:09.600 --> 25:16.640
state has developed a plan for districts to be able to bring back small groups for instruction

25:16.640 --> 25:25.200
and targeted services, particularly students who special education needs, students who could not

25:25.200 --> 25:32.800
easily connect. Districts like San Francisco have started learning hubs with their Department of

25:32.800 --> 25:39.600
Family, Youth and Children so that they can provide spaces for kids who need to do distance

25:39.600 --> 25:45.840
learning from a place other than the home where they can be online, get support, get food and

25:45.840 --> 25:55.440
other supports during that time. So it's an extraordinary moment to see educators, cities,

25:55.520 --> 26:02.000
communities stepping up in the face of all of the challenges that Tony enumerated

26:02.960 --> 26:09.440
both from the pandemic and from the fires that are going on now. The other thing that I am very

26:09.440 --> 26:16.800
heartened by is the recognition of the importance of social and emotional learning. Virtually every

26:16.800 --> 26:24.400
district I connect with says we're starting out with a social and emotional learning agenda,

26:24.400 --> 26:31.440
a platform, a way to figure out what supports students need and also to engage in social,

26:31.440 --> 26:40.400
emotional learning and practices on a regular basis. There are so many that in the wake of the

26:41.520 --> 26:48.320
shootings that occurred by police have begun to move away from policing towards restorative

26:48.320 --> 26:56.080
practices in schools and are continuing their learning about how to create more inclusive and

26:56.080 --> 27:05.920
supportive environments for students. I think the key issue for us in the state is the issue of

27:06.640 --> 27:15.200
how to deal both with the ongoing chasm of inequality outside the schools as well as the

27:15.200 --> 27:21.040
issues that we deal with inside with loss of employment, with loss of

27:23.600 --> 27:31.440
housing, food security and so on. Our governor and our legislature have stepped up over and over

27:31.440 --> 27:37.840
again to try to build back a safety net to the extent that it's possible, but we really need

27:37.840 --> 27:44.320
to continue to work as we are in the federal environment for the kind of recovery that will

27:46.080 --> 27:51.280
allow us to see all of our children adequately supported both inside and outside of schools.

27:51.280 --> 27:58.400
The schools have been doing heroic work, heroic work to step up into those gaps and be sure that

27:58.400 --> 28:06.720
kids are getting as much of what they need as the education system can provide. The final

28:06.720 --> 28:10.640
thing I'll just say is that I think in moments like this, there are moments of social upheaval

28:10.640 --> 28:18.240
like this and we've had them in history. We see tremendous moments of social progress

28:19.200 --> 28:24.480
following. If you think back to the 1930s when the Great Depression

28:26.080 --> 28:33.200
emerged, think back to the 1960s in the middle of intensive civil rights gains and issues,

28:33.600 --> 28:40.880
assassinations, all kinds of things were triggering social mobilization.

28:41.840 --> 28:48.400
We transformed that into progressive policy that supported equity, that supported

28:49.200 --> 28:54.640
empowering education. We're at that moment. We are in that inflection point. We are working

28:54.640 --> 29:02.880
on that agenda in California and we need to continue to double down on that. People are

29:02.880 --> 29:11.840
inventing ways to strengthen the relationships between schools, families, and communities,

29:11.840 --> 29:22.400
as well as the work that goes on within them, and we need to share across in all of the ways that

29:22.400 --> 29:29.040
the defense, the CCE, state board, and others are seeking to make sure that that sharing goes on.

29:29.600 --> 29:37.920
With that, I think we need to get into our agenda for the day. We're going to move us

29:37.920 --> 29:46.960
of agenda one and move us on to agenda number two, which is our accountability item.

29:46.960 --> 30:02.080
I'm going to ask that Cindy Kazanis appear on our screen. Agenda two is

30:03.840 --> 30:08.640
a recommendation from CDE that the state board adopt the following new career measures for

30:08.640 --> 30:12.480
inclusion in the college career indicator. Actually, I'll let them come to that in a moment

30:12.480 --> 30:17.280
and detail all of those measures. We'll also receive an update on the development of the

30:17.280 --> 30:24.480
growth model and the implementation of some statutory provisions. Cindy, I see your slides.

30:27.760 --> 30:35.920
I assume you are there, so please begin. Good morning. Cindy Kazanis with the

30:35.920 --> 30:40.320
Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division. I just wanted to echo

30:40.320 --> 30:45.440
Superintendent Thurmond's comments about Karen Staff Walters and her tenure here at the board.

30:46.240 --> 30:51.360
We would not have gotten to the place we have with accountability without her leadership.

30:52.080 --> 30:59.680
Seven and a half years meant the birth of LCFF, the new assessment system, the new accountability

30:59.680 --> 31:06.000
system, and the system of support. You have fought so hard for that and have been a great supporter.

31:06.800 --> 31:12.480
You even made a trip to Washington, D.C. to fight for the ESSA state plan with us. I do

31:14.000 --> 31:21.120
appreciate your support and your leadership. Congratulations on your new endeavor. We will

31:21.120 --> 31:27.200
miss you. We're really looking forward to having Brooks Allen back. It's nice to see a familiar

31:27.200 --> 31:33.680
face and somebody who's so steeped, of course, in LCFF. We're looking forward to working with Brooks

31:33.680 --> 31:40.720
again. I wanted to get us started today. We're going to actually take our attachments out of

31:40.720 --> 31:46.240
order. We do have some meaty things to talk about today, but we only have one action item.

31:46.240 --> 31:51.680
So I'll walk through the attachments individually, and I'll be joined at the podium by Jenny Singh

31:51.680 --> 31:58.640
and others to present this item. So the recommendation for today is the adoption

31:58.640 --> 32:02.560
that the state board adopt the following new career measures for the inclusion in the college

32:02.560 --> 32:07.920
career indicator, pre-apprenticeships, state and federal job programs, transition work-based

32:07.920 --> 32:14.240
learning experiences, transition classroom-based learning experiences. And before we get into that,

32:14.240 --> 32:18.560
we wanted to talk a little bit about what we've been doing. So in order to bring any item to the

32:18.560 --> 32:23.840
board when it comes to accountability, we go through an extensive stakeholder outreach process.

32:23.840 --> 32:31.200
And while we've all been working remotely since around St. Patrick's Day, we have been really

32:31.200 --> 32:37.680
getting out there in terms of accountability to make sure that the field understands things

32:37.680 --> 32:42.800
about the waiver that's been approved by the federal government around accountability,

32:42.800 --> 32:48.400
the subsequent legislation from the state that supports that, and then the items before you

32:48.400 --> 32:56.800
today. And so between April and August, end of August, we have had six work groups, which for

32:56.800 --> 33:04.560
us have been focused primarily on the college career indicator and advisory meetings. And with

33:04.560 --> 33:12.320
those meetings, about 190 participants, 13 virtual presentations with over 2,000 participants. And

33:12.320 --> 33:17.040
then some work that we've started on that you're going to hear about at the next board meeting

33:17.040 --> 33:24.320
is around AB 1505. And that was the accountability hosted webinar that we did back in late June,

33:24.320 --> 33:34.720
where we had nearly 400 participants. So attachment one walks us through the

33:34.720 --> 33:40.800
options before you for the college career indicator. I will stop after I present this

33:40.800 --> 33:45.120
material for clarifying questions, and we'll do the same for the other attachments because there's

33:45.120 --> 33:53.360
a lot of material here to cover. So to begin, this has been a work in progress for many years.

33:53.360 --> 34:00.400
You all had an actual study session just around the college career indicator last year in May.

34:01.360 --> 34:06.960
And so we are at a place where we're ready to propose new career measures. And we'd like to

34:06.960 --> 34:12.320
publicly report out in these career measures in fall of 2020. Why that's important is because

34:12.320 --> 34:18.160
we want to make sure that schools get recognized for the work that they've done to prepare students

34:18.160 --> 34:24.720
for not only college but career. And we've known this indicator has been lacking on the career

34:24.720 --> 34:31.520
side. And so we've really spent the last year or so focused on collecting this data, analyzing

34:31.520 --> 34:37.200
this data, and what you see before you today for the recommendations. The data, it's important to

34:37.200 --> 34:43.200
note, will not be used on the dashboard to determine a color because of the legislation

34:43.280 --> 34:49.520
that's referenced in the second bullet, SB 98. We are required under that provision to report

34:49.520 --> 34:54.320
valid and reliable data that would have been included in the dashboard. And so we will be

34:54.320 --> 34:59.520
able to report out on our additional reports the measures in which students demonstrate that they

34:59.520 --> 35:05.280
were prepared or approaching prepared for the college career indicator. And I think for the

35:05.280 --> 35:10.880
first time this spring, we are working towards a solution where we can provide this information

35:10.880 --> 35:19.520
back to school districts at the student level. I also wanted to note, and I think we put this in

35:19.520 --> 35:26.000
the item, that this by adopting these measures, this takes us to the ultimate goal that I think

35:26.000 --> 35:30.960
you have all expressed to us in previous meetings to make this not only a college career indicator

35:30.960 --> 35:37.520
but a college and career indicator. And also to the place where we can actually have a category

35:37.520 --> 35:46.080
that's called well prepared. So there are four items that we are bringing before you for adoption.

35:46.080 --> 35:51.200
The first is pre-apprenticeships, and there's a nice summary chart if it's easier for you to look

35:51.200 --> 35:56.240
at. It's on page two of the attachment. The pre-apprenticeship piece would be available to

35:56.240 --> 36:02.240
both traditional and our dashboard alternative school status schools or DAS schools. The second

36:02.320 --> 36:08.000
is the state and federal job programs, which is limited to DAS schools. The third transition

36:08.000 --> 36:12.640
work-based learning experiences that would be available only to students with individualized

36:12.640 --> 36:18.400
education programs or IEPs. And then finally the transition classroom-based learning experiences

36:18.400 --> 36:22.640
available only to students with IEPs and who have earned a certificate of completion.

36:25.840 --> 36:29.200
It's important to note that many of these measures were collected for the first time

36:29.200 --> 36:36.320
in 2018-19, and we're currently collecting our second year of this data as we speak.

36:36.320 --> 36:41.040
The collection is scheduled to close tomorrow, and so we'll have I think some robust data to

36:41.040 --> 36:49.120
be able to share with districts around this. So at your May 2019 study session you provided,

36:49.120 --> 36:53.920
there was a very robust discussion. I think we had about a four-hour session with you prior to your

36:54.640 --> 37:01.440
May board meeting, and there was a lot of talk around how we can start to bring on career

37:01.440 --> 37:07.120
measures and not tying them to how we do our college measures, which is to the smarter balance

37:07.120 --> 37:12.960
some of the assessments. So in order to do that, what we've been working on to make sure that we

37:12.960 --> 37:21.040
followed your directive was to base our proposed career measures on research and the completion of

37:21.040 --> 37:28.160
career technical education coursework. So we've looked at local, state, national research on the

37:28.160 --> 37:34.240
programs that are before you today, and you have them summarized in the item.

37:39.200 --> 37:45.600
So if you're following along on the board item, we're on page 14, and the two pieces that fall

37:45.680 --> 37:51.360
under the pre-apprenticeship program are registered pre-apprenticeships and non-registered

37:51.360 --> 37:57.520
pre-apprenticeships. And registered pre-apprenticeships are recognized by businesses and our industry,

37:58.080 --> 38:02.400
and are registered at the state or national level, and the non-registered ones simply are not

38:02.400 --> 38:06.880
registered at the state or national level, but are recognized by businesses or industry.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.680
So for the first, there's actually two slides for this. The first slide is around traditional schools,

38:14.640 --> 38:20.000
and the second slide is around dashboard alternative school status schools, because there's a slight

38:20.000 --> 38:25.440
variation on the non-registered pre-apprenticeship piece. So the recommendation is for the registered

38:25.440 --> 38:29.840
pre-apprenticeship for traditional schools that in order to be in the prepared category, they've

38:29.840 --> 38:35.440
completed the program. There is no recommendation for approaching prepared. Well, this is similar

38:35.440 --> 38:40.000
to the state's syllabi literacy, so by earning that seal, you are determined to be prepared.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.840
For the non-registered, it's not only completion of the program, but also the completion of a CTE

38:45.840 --> 38:49.680
pathway. The approaching prepared criteria is completion of a program.

38:52.080 --> 38:57.040
So I think it's important to note that overall, by adding this measure, what we've found is that

38:57.040 --> 39:06.000
over nearly 700 students, or 679, would shift into the prepared category. Of those students,

39:06.000 --> 39:15.280
80% are in traditional schools, and about 20 in the DAS schools. So while we're moving the needle

39:15.280 --> 39:22.640
for a small number of students of over 400,000 students in our cohort, it's important that we

39:22.640 --> 39:28.160
recognize where to meet students, where they're at. Not all students are on the college path,

39:28.160 --> 39:32.960
and so this captures some of the students who may not be being able to demonstrate that they're

39:32.960 --> 39:39.840
prepared under the college career indicator. So for DAS, again, the same for the pre-registered

39:39.840 --> 39:43.360
criteria, completion of the program. The difference is for the non-registered

39:43.360 --> 39:49.280
pre-apprenticeship, we not only have the completion of the program, plus the completion of one semester,

39:49.280 --> 39:54.320
two quarters, two trimesters of a CTE course, and then adding in with a C-minus or better.

39:55.040 --> 40:01.040
The same category, or rather, approaching prepared criteria is for DAS as it is for

40:01.040 --> 40:12.960
the traditional schools. Moving on to the state or federal job program, and we're recommending

40:12.960 --> 40:18.960
this be limited to DAS schools. Many of the programs that we reviewed really actually are

40:18.960 --> 40:27.680
at DAS schools. So the first is the Job Corps, which is a U.S. Department of Labor sponsored

40:28.400 --> 40:35.520
program. We know that there are several DAS schools, if not actually charter schools,

40:35.520 --> 40:43.920
that work with this program. The WIOA youth program has a lot of the same students as well,

40:43.920 --> 40:47.920
again sponsored by the Department of Labor. I know that there was a letter of support

40:47.920 --> 40:54.320
specifically on this from SciTech, because they've been strong in this area and actually have

40:54.880 --> 41:00.080
a long-standing history with the WIOA program. The other piece that we looked at for the state

41:00.080 --> 41:05.520
and federal job programs is YouthBuild. Again, there are a couple of charter schools that

41:05.520 --> 41:10.160
focus on YouthBuild, and then the California Conservation Corps, which of course is a state

41:10.160 --> 41:18.080
program, RCOP as well. And so we do not have discrete data on each of these programs because

41:18.080 --> 41:22.960
of the way the collection was done in CALPADS, but beginning this year or moving forward,

41:22.960 --> 41:30.000
we will start to collect them for each of the programs. So the recommendation for this is to,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.880
for prepared, is the completion of the program plus completion of one semester, two quarters,

41:34.880 --> 41:40.320
two trimesters of a CTE course with a C minus or better, and then the approaching prepared criteria

41:40.320 --> 41:47.680
is completion of a program. This measure would add 403 students to prepared from either approaching

41:47.680 --> 41:55.920
prepared or not prepared. And so it's, again, small amounts, but moving the margin for a really

41:57.040 --> 42:02.880
critical piece of students, many students who are over 18 and are trying to come back and

42:02.880 --> 42:13.520
earn their high school diploma or earn a GED. And then the final group is based on students who

42:13.520 --> 42:18.240
are students who have an IEP, so this is limited to an even smaller universe of students, but a

42:18.240 --> 42:25.120
universe that is very hard to demonstrate college or career preparedness. And so this data collection

42:25.120 --> 42:31.120
and how we looked at this was done from the old special education data system called CASEMIS,

42:31.120 --> 42:35.840
and this information has been transferred over to our student level data system or CALPADS.

42:36.960 --> 42:43.200
We are looking at for classroom or work-based experiences, the prepared criteria would be

42:43.200 --> 42:48.320
completion of 100 hours of work experience and the equivalent of four semesters of college and

42:48.320 --> 42:52.640
career exploration, preparation, designed to prepare the student with an IEP for employment

42:52.640 --> 42:57.440
and independent living, and then the approaching prepared criteria would be completion of the 100

42:57.440 --> 43:02.080
hours of work experience or the equivalent of four semesters of college and career exploration

43:02.080 --> 43:09.600
or preparation. It's important to note that all of these measures have support ultimately from

43:09.600 --> 43:14.880
both the policy work groups that we have been developing the college career indicator under,

43:14.880 --> 43:22.560
which is the college career subgroup for accountability, and then the alternative

43:22.560 --> 43:29.520
school work group. And they had a meeting not only in February, but they came back in May,

43:29.520 --> 43:34.000
and then some came back even in August to work through these. We also had the support of the

43:34.000 --> 43:39.280
California practitioners advisory group, and really there's not been a lot of

43:41.760 --> 43:49.120
discussion. These seem to be things that folks generally are ready to move on with and bring

43:49.120 --> 43:52.240
on board to the college career indicator. So with that, I'm happy to turn it over

43:53.840 --> 43:57.760
to President Darling-Hammond to ask any clarifying questions,

43:57.760 --> 44:00.240
and then from here we'll move over to the growth model discussion.

44:00.240 --> 44:08.960
Yeah, we'll just see if anyone has clarifying questions, and I

44:11.120 --> 44:17.120
need to make my screen function so I can see everyone again.

44:18.320 --> 44:20.400
So give me just a second here, sorry.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.440
Linda, Cynthia has her hand up.

44:23.440 --> 44:27.680
Okay, please, Cynthia, go ahead. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my screen to work.

44:27.680 --> 44:37.120
Good morning, thank you so much. I just had a quick clarifying question in regards to the

44:37.120 --> 44:45.760
CTE coursework that would be aligned to the apprenticeship program. Can you clarify,

44:46.800 --> 44:55.360
in order to be approaching, would the CTE course for the traditional school need to be aligned

44:55.840 --> 45:00.320
to the content or the focus of the pre-apprenticeship?

45:01.840 --> 45:06.400
I'm going to turn it over to Jenny Singh, who's been diligently working on this for a long time.

45:10.160 --> 45:17.280
So as we were working with our CCI work group, they were very clear that if students are in

45:17.280 --> 45:22.240
an apprenticeship, they are traditionally also taking CTE courses that are aligned to that.

45:23.200 --> 45:30.640
I will say that when we do our programming and we pull out the CTE courses, we will not

45:30.640 --> 45:37.680
be determining if those courses are actually aligned. But if they complete a CTE pathway and

45:37.680 --> 45:42.880
a pre-apprenticeship, we've been assured that those are aligned very well at the local level.

45:44.960 --> 45:51.680
Okay, so pretty much the likelihood of that, of the alignment, is in place right now based upon

45:51.680 --> 45:59.200
what has been seen, but there isn't any measure to ensure that that would indeed occur. Is that

45:59.200 --> 46:08.160
accurate, Jenny? Yeah, it would be extremely difficult to do that in our program. But as we

46:08.160 --> 46:12.880
start to collect courses a little bit differently, we may be able to do that in the future.

46:12.880 --> 46:15.200
Thank you.

46:15.200 --> 46:28.400
So yeah, my question. So these indicators that are being asked, or that you're asking us to adopt,

46:29.280 --> 46:37.280
when they, sorry, I'm not forming my question correctly. Some of the indicators on our college

46:37.280 --> 46:46.720
career readiness are coupled with others, right, to be prepared. So these that you're recommending,

46:47.280 --> 46:51.680
are they standalone? They're not coupled with anything else? I know we were trying to stay away

46:51.680 --> 47:00.720
from academic and just have sole CTE, or career rather, based indicators.

47:00.720 --> 47:06.880
So some of the measures that we're asking you to approve are standalone, and some of them are

47:06.880 --> 47:16.640
coupled with the completion of CTE pathways or courses in some way or another. Okay, and so the

47:16.640 --> 47:22.960
department has a really great chart that on the career readiness indicator right now, and so

47:23.840 --> 47:28.080
these will be woven in. It's starting to become complex, and so I worry a little bit about

47:28.080 --> 47:34.640
communication, about how all of these indicators work with each other. You're correct. It is a very

47:34.640 --> 47:39.600
complex indicator because we do have lots of measures in there, and we will be working with

47:39.600 --> 47:45.680
our contractor, the Sacramento County Office of Education, to update the chart and hopefully make

47:45.680 --> 47:52.880
it as clear as possible. So there's as little confusion as possible out in the field. Thank you.

47:55.360 --> 48:01.200
I'm not seeing other hands at the moment. Trisha Rucker has her hand up, Linda. Oh great, thank you.

48:01.680 --> 48:07.120
Thank you. I hope you can hear me. I want, my question was, I wanted to get some clarification

48:07.120 --> 48:15.040
about how the courses that the students are going to receive credit for in this indicator

48:15.600 --> 48:21.600
are being reviewed or certified, and I hope this does not either add complexity or confusion

48:22.160 --> 48:27.600
to what you said, but I want to make sure I heard you say that you have not vetted or reviewed,

48:28.480 --> 48:37.680
or there is not criteria for vetting and reviewing these courses to make sure that they either are

48:37.680 --> 48:49.680
parallel and rigor or contain and are aligned to the standards that we're expecting, and I understand

48:49.680 --> 48:55.680
that because these are approved either meet industry standard or have been approved in various

48:55.680 --> 49:02.960
ways by different agencies, is there a way over time to grow what the matrix is for considering

49:02.960 --> 49:08.800
these courses? Because there are, right now we're approving this based on courses that currently

49:08.800 --> 49:16.880
exist. As we continue to mature not only the indicator, but continue based on the plans we

49:16.880 --> 49:24.160
have for the overall development and upgrade of CTE, we're looking at also approving courses that

49:24.160 --> 49:31.760
currently are not in place, so I want to understand, I understand how the courses that you currently

49:31.760 --> 49:38.160
identified have been selected and approved, but what is going to be the criteria going forward

49:38.160 --> 49:44.800
for either refining or improving what is collected or called out of the student database

49:44.800 --> 49:50.960
as additional courses are identified and brought in? Sure, so let me, let me start to answer that

49:50.960 --> 49:57.520
question and then Jenny can help if I miss something. Each of these courses are collected

49:57.520 --> 50:03.600
at the student level in CALPADS, and so like I mentioned, if I take for example the state and

50:03.600 --> 50:10.640
federal program job programs typically done through the course collection process, so the

50:10.640 --> 50:17.360
certification is done at the local level. I think, I want to make sure I understand the question, but

50:17.760 --> 50:26.240
the question that I heard previously was about the alignment of the specific courses within

50:26.240 --> 50:33.120
the pre-apprenticeship and to the CTE pathway, and that's what Jenny was mentioning was a little

50:33.120 --> 50:39.600
more difficult to be that discreet. We recently went through an overhaul of our course,

50:40.240 --> 50:47.600
courses, and how we're looking at courses in CALPADS, and so we are hopeful that we are going

50:47.600 --> 50:53.120
to have better data quality moving forward. We also know that there's not only with the college

50:53.120 --> 50:57.600
career indicator, but other things at the state level related to the cradle to career

50:59.840 --> 51:04.960
work group that the governor has sponsored, that there's a lot of interest in just knowing

51:05.680 --> 51:11.840
a lot more about courses, and of course I know your work with the community college system and

51:11.840 --> 51:17.600
that work group, there's just keen interest on the courses, but ultimately courses are

51:17.600 --> 51:22.320
submitted by local educational agencies and certified through CALPADS.

51:23.840 --> 51:29.920
Okay, yes, and you did tag on to exactly what I was seeking and asking that question, because a

51:29.920 --> 51:37.280
lot of what you have reported to me today or to the board today is very important to board member

51:37.280 --> 51:43.120
Sun and I because of the work we're doing on the California joint workforce pathways advisory

51:43.120 --> 51:48.560
committee, and it informs some of the conversations we've been trying to have, not only about the

51:48.560 --> 51:56.560
content for the plans for the development of the overall CTE statewide plan, but also on what we're

51:56.560 --> 52:02.880
looking for and evaluating and understanding the programs that are being funded for CTE and

52:02.880 --> 52:09.760
multiple sources. So thank you for clarifying what was stated about how the courses are identified

52:09.760 --> 52:16.080
and certified at the local level, and also thank you for clarifying how this work broadens out or

52:16.080 --> 52:23.760
can be connected to the other ongoing activities for the project. So like board member Sun,

52:23.760 --> 52:28.320
I'm having some problem this morning, it seems, trying to make sure I put my question out there

52:28.320 --> 52:33.440
correctly, but you clearly, you answered what I was asking, you answered and gave the information

52:33.440 --> 52:36.880
for what I was seeking, so thank you, and I believe I have lowered my hand.

52:37.680 --> 52:43.760
Okay, great. Seeing no other clarifying questions, we will have a chance to come back for board

52:43.760 --> 52:51.840
discussion, but I'm going to encourage Cindy to go ahead with the growth model discussion.

52:51.840 --> 52:57.040
I'm going to turn this over to Jenny Singh and to our partners at ETS to take over this piece of

52:57.040 --> 53:06.480
the presentation. Good morning board members. As Cindy said, we do have some of our colleagues

53:06.480 --> 53:13.920
from ETS who are online. I am going to start out the presentation, and then we'll have staff from

53:13.920 --> 53:20.400
ETS take over after a few slides. So I'm just going to do a really brief overview about how

53:20.400 --> 53:27.200
we're exploring the empirical best linear prediction calculations for the aggregate growth measures.

53:29.120 --> 53:34.880
So I just wanted to start out with the timeline because I think it's really important to remember

53:34.880 --> 53:40.560
that this has been a very long process. We've invested a lot of time into the growth model.

53:40.560 --> 53:49.280
We started work in March of 2015 looking at various growth models that we should explore,

53:49.280 --> 53:54.720
and then we started the technical work in September 2015. Then in March of 2016,

53:54.720 --> 53:59.040
we started collaborating with the Education Testing Services or ETS.

54:00.640 --> 54:07.520
Then in January of 2017, we had a conversation with the board members about the criteria that

54:07.520 --> 54:12.480
we should be looking at when we're selecting a growth model, and then in April we actually

54:12.480 --> 54:22.720
contracted with ETS for an evaluation study. So in 2018, in February, ETS explored three models,

54:22.720 --> 54:28.480
the residual gain, the change in distance to met, and the conditional percentile ranking.

54:29.120 --> 54:35.520
These were models that were recommended by various groups as we were going out and

54:35.520 --> 54:41.520
asking for input. I have a chart that will explain what that study looked at.

54:42.560 --> 54:50.160
Then in June, ETS submitted part two of the study, which was done at the request of the board members

54:50.160 --> 54:54.160
because they wanted to look at data over time for the growth model.

54:56.240 --> 55:01.360
So for the three models that they looked at, they looked at three different criteria,

55:02.240 --> 55:05.200
strength or relationship with background characteristics,

55:05.200 --> 55:12.560
X, sensitivity to school configuration and assessment content area, and statistical precision.

55:13.600 --> 55:17.120
So it's really important when you read this chart that you understand that if it's blank,

55:18.960 --> 55:25.040
it means that it performed well, and if it's got an X, it means it performed worse on that measure

55:25.040 --> 55:33.360
than the other two models. So based on this information,

55:38.720 --> 55:45.200
so in July of 2018, the board asked us to put a pause on our growth model work,

55:46.000 --> 55:51.040
and that's because the student-level growth model really didn't align with the requirements

55:51.040 --> 55:56.080
that we established for our multiple measures accountability system. The stability of the

55:56.080 --> 56:03.040
growth model over time, it wasn't what we wanted it to be. And we were getting a lot of questions

56:03.040 --> 56:08.080
from the field and a lot of input from stakeholders about how the information from the residual gain

56:08.080 --> 56:13.520
model may not really be answering the questions that they wanted to have answered from a growth model.

56:13.520 --> 56:20.880
So, in 2019, at the request of the state board, we put together a growth model stakeholder group,

56:21.600 --> 56:25.360
and we had four meetings with them, and we did that in partnership with WestEd.

56:26.400 --> 56:34.160
And so the work from these meetings did influence the CDE and the SBE to continue to pursue the

56:34.160 --> 56:39.680
residual gain student growth model. And that brings us to 2020.

56:39.680 --> 56:48.080
A great year that it has been. We worked on the technical modifications with ETS and the

56:48.080 --> 56:54.080
technical design group, or TDG. So one of the first things we did was we revised the highest

56:54.080 --> 57:01.920
obtainable scale score, and we presented that to you last time, and then at the last July meeting,

57:01.920 --> 57:14.320
and then we developed a new regression formula to increase accuracy and stability.

57:15.760 --> 57:18.160
And that's the work that ETS has been doing for us.

57:19.920 --> 57:24.080
So with that, I would like to turn it over to our colleagues at ETS,

57:24.080 --> 57:28.880
and I believe JR Lockwood is going to be presenting this material. JR?

57:29.760 --> 57:34.560
Yes, I'm here. Thank you for the opportunity to present. If anyone cannot hear me clearly,

57:34.560 --> 57:40.960
please speak up. I feel like I'm unmuted now. The goals for this presentation are to give a brief

57:40.960 --> 57:46.080
overview of the empirical best linear prediction, or what will be called the EBLUP method of

57:46.080 --> 57:52.320
computing aggregate growth measures for schools and LEAs, and also to summarize findings of our

57:52.320 --> 57:57.920
empirical study of this method using growth data from California. Next slide, please.

57:58.880 --> 58:07.520
So I can give a very brief background on how we got here. These aggregate growth measures,

58:07.520 --> 58:12.960
which I'll abbreviate AGMs, are intended to summarize student achievement progress for

58:12.960 --> 58:19.600
schools and local educational agencies. And a standard approach to computing AGMs is a

58:19.600 --> 58:25.200
simple average of all the individual student growth scores available for a school or LEA

58:25.200 --> 58:32.880
in a particular school in a particular school year for a particular subject. For example,

58:32.880 --> 58:39.760
if a school had 100 students with mathematics growth scores in spring 2019, the simplest method

58:39.760 --> 58:47.600
to compute the mathematics AGM for that school in 2019 is just the average or mean of those 100

58:47.600 --> 58:52.880
growth scores. Of course, this method is straightforward, but it does have a downside.

58:53.680 --> 58:59.600
Specifically, simple averages that are based on very few scores are less accurate than those based

58:59.600 --> 59:08.560
on many scores. As a result, AGMs for schools or LEAs serving smaller numbers of students

59:08.560 --> 59:14.960
are less accurate than those who are serving larger numbers of students. So I want to provide

59:14.960 --> 59:19.920
a concrete example that I hope will help to convey what I mean by accuracy of a simple average.

59:20.880 --> 59:26.000
And for this example, we're going to consider school level average mathematics growth in spring

59:26.000 --> 59:33.360
2019. So I went into the California growth data and I found two schools that both had average

59:33.360 --> 59:39.360
mathematics growth on the scale of the residual gains of 22 points. One of these schools, which

59:39.360 --> 59:45.440
I'll label school A, is very large and had over 1200 students with mathematics growth scores in

59:45.440 --> 59:52.160
spring 2019. And alternatively, school B, is a very small school, had only 15 students with

59:52.160 --> 59:58.080
mathematics growth scores in 2019. So these are two schools, the same average growth score,

59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.800
but where that average is based on vastly different numbers of students. And I considered

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.240
what would happen to these averages if we were to think about removing just one of the growth

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.280
scores from the average. For example, suppose that a student was ill during the testing period in

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:19.440
2019 and didn't have a test score, or even more distantly, suppose that one student just happened

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:27.040
to miss testing back in 2018 and so wouldn't have a growth score in 2019. So for school A,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.480
with where there's over 1200 growth scores, there's little sensitivity to just one score

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.840
being removed. And in fact, depending on exactly which score is removed, the possible values of

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.640
the AGM for the school range from 21.9 to 22.3. So very close to the original average of 22.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.640
Thus, the presence or absence of a single individual growth score has a very minor

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.880
impact on the AGM for school A, because there's so many scores contributing to the average.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:03.120
Next, please. For school B, it's a totally different story. If we think about taking away

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:09.440
just one of those 15 growth scores, you can make that average go anywhere from 11 up to 28,

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:15.440
depending on which specific score is taken out. So while the actual average based on all 15 is 22,

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.800
you can see very big changes to this average, resulting from just one score being removed.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:26.400
So the idea is that average growth scores for smaller schools are much more sensitive to the

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.280
specific set of scores that are included in the average than averages for larger schools.

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.400
And this is roughly what we mean when we say that the accuracy of simple averages is lower

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.440
for smaller schools than it is for larger schools. Next slide.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.840
So why do we care about accuracy? One of the most problematic side effects of low accuracy is that

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:54.560
it can cause excessive year to year fluctuation in the AGMs for the same school or LEA. For example,

01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:00.080
a small school AGMs might bounce around a lot from year to year. And in fact, this issue was noted as

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:08.480
a key concern for CDE when examining simple average AGMs in the past. If the AGMs for a

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.920
school or LEA are very inconsistent from one year to the next, it can leave educators unsure about

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.240
how to make changes in response to the measures because they're sending inconsistent signals.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.920
And this ultimately could cause people to lose trust in the measures because

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:29.520
they behave in ways that feel capricious. And a related problem caused by low accuracy is

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.440
that because accuracy is driven by the number of growth scores included in the AGMs, the measures

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.960
behave differently across schools or LEAs of different sizes. So think back to schools A and

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:47.280
B in the previous example. The AGMs for school B, which has very few student growth scores each year,

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.920
are almost certainly going to fluctuate a lot more from year to year than those for school A.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:56.320
And these kinds of disparities can again erode credibility and perceived fairness

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.920
of the reporting system. In addition, these problems caused by low accuracy can be even

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:08.080
more pronounced for AGMs that are computed for specific student groups within schools and LEAs,

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.280
such as students with disabilities or socioeconomically disadvantaged students,

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.480
because there may be many schools or LEAs serving relatively small numbers of students in particular

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:25.760
groups. Thus, for relatively rare student groups, low accuracy can be severe and widespread.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:34.960
So given this background, next slide please. Given this background, I and some colleagues at ETS

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.200
have been developing an approach to improve the accuracy of AGMs. It's called the Empirical Best

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.080
Linear Prediction Approach, or EBLUP for short. Not the best acronym, but it is well established

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:53.600
in the statistical literature. The idea for EBLUP is that it is intended to improve accuracy of the

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:59.520
AGMs for each school in each year. And if we can improve accuracy, hopefully it also will improve

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:05.120
year-to-year stability as a result. And in addition to that, hopefully reduce disparities

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:12.800
in both accuracy and stability of the AGMs between small and large schools or LEAs. Next slide.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.360
I'm going to briefly summarize what the EBLUP method is and how it works.

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.600
First, just like simple averages, it starts with the raw material of individual student-level

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:35.520
growth scores, here residual gains in mathematics and ELA. The method doesn't alter these growth

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:41.280
scores at all. In other words, EBLUP is not a new or different growth model. It takes the same input

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.200
that the simple averages do, but it is a method for computing AGMs from these individual growth

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.560
scores that goes beyond simple averages with the goal of improving accuracy and ultimately

01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:01.200
year-to-year stability of the measures. Next. So to describe how this method works,

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:07.360
I'm going to imagine the goal of computing the mathematics AGM for one school in the 2018-19

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:12.720
school year. And as I said previously, the simple average method of computing the AGM would just

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:18.960
take the average of the mathematics growth scores for the school students in the 2018-19

01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:28.640
school year. Alternatively, the EBLUP combines that information with not only the mathematics

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.400
growth scores for those students as well as the ELA growth scores for those students in 2018-19

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.800
and mathematics and ELA growth scores for those school students in one or more prior school years.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:47.120
And more concretely, the EBLUP is approximately a weighted average of all of these sources

01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:56.160
information. And the reason that a weighted average can improve accuracy is because these

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:02.160
other sources of information indirectly contain information about the school's average mathematics

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:07.920
growth in 2019. For example, go back, I'm still on the previous slide.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.600
For example, if we look across the whole state, we can observe that schools that have high average

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:23.520
mathematics growth in 2018-19 also tend to have high average ELA growth. Thus, ELA growth is

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.800
indirectly informative about math growth. And likewise, if we look across the whole state,

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:34.480
we can observe that schools with high average mathematics growth in spring 2019 also tend to

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.120
have high average mathematics growth in the previous school year. So again, a school's

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.440
average growth from the prior school year is indirectly informative about its average growth

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:48.720
in the current school year. And so EBLUP is a method for incorporating this indirect information

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.400
via a weighted average when it is needed to improve accuracy. Next slide.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:58.800
So this naturally leads to the question of how the method determines the weights to use for this

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:05.520
weighted average. And in short, the weights are tailored to each individual school or LEA and are

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:10.400
determined using a mathematical formula that provides the weights that attempt to maximize

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:17.360
the accuracy of the AGM for each school and LEA. For example, when calculating the mathematics

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:23.920
AGM for a particular school in 2018-19, the EBLUP method uses mathematical formulas to determine a

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:29.600
set of weights specific to this school and specific to mathematics that tries to make the resulting

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.800
mathematics AGM for the school as accurate as possible. And probably the most important thing

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:40.640
to understand about the weights is that they're adaptive to sample size. Specifically, when an

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:45.280
AGM for a given year and subject is an average over many students, like sports or sports,

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:50.320
is an average over many students, like school A, that average gets almost all of the weight in the

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:56.160
EBLUP and this indirect information is largely ignored. But when the AGM would be based on

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.960
fewer students, more weight is given to the other sources of information to try to make up for the

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.240
fact that the simple average based on few students has low accuracy. Next slide.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.560
I thought it would be useful to actually provide a concrete example, returning back to this example

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.440
of school A and school B. These are, again, two schools that had the same average mathematics

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.040
growth in 2018-19, but school A had over 1,200 student growth scores contributing to that average

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.680
where school B had only 15. And the table shows how the EBLUP method allocates weight to different

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:35.600
sources of information when computing the mathematics AGM for each of these two schools in 2018-19.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.480
There are four rows and one for each source of growth data and the top row is the mathematics

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.760
growth scores from 2018-19. These are the scores that would be used in the simple average and the

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.640
other three rows are the indirect growth data that EBLUP tries to use to improve accuracy.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:59.280
So we have the ELA growth data from 18-19 as well as the mathematics and ELA growth data from the

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:04.800
previous school year. For school A, the EBLUP puts almost all of the weight on the first row.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.680
As a result, for this school, the EBLUP is almost exactly equal to the simple average of the school's

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:17.760
mathematics growth scores from 2018-19. And the reason it allocates weight in this way is because

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.960
the simple average based on over 1,200 students is already very accurate and there is almost nothing

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:29.120
to be gained by incorporating the indirect information. And this is in contrast to school B

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.320
where just over 50 percent of the weight is on the first row and the remaining weight is split

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.840
across the other sources of indirect information. This is because school B with only 15 growth

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.360
scores and the simple average of these scores has fairly low accuracy and so the EBLUP tries

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:50.720
to put extra weight on these other sources of indirect information in an attempt to make

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:58.160
the AGM mathematics measure for the school as accurate as possible. Next slide please.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:08.800
Next slide please. So with this background, I want to discuss some key findings of a study

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.080
in which we analyzed over 17 million individual growth scores from California students

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:20.880
to compare the EBLUP weighted averages to simple averages to understand whether and how much the

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.320
EBLUP method improves accuracy and improves year-to-year stability. We provided a technical

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.520
report and presentation of these studies findings to the technical design group last month and today

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:38.480
I'm just going to summarize some of the key findings. The first thing we wanted to look at

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:45.680
is to what extent does using the EBLUP weighted averages improve cross-year stability of AGMs

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:52.560
relative to simple averages? In other words, to what extent does EBLUP weighted averages,

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.840
what to what extent do they fluctuate less from year to year for the same school or LEA

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.400
than simple averages fluctuate? And as noted previously, this issue of cross-year stability

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:07.120
has been a core concern when developing the growth model and associated reporting and so

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:14.000
it was a key part of our evaluation. So this table summarizes some of the results regarding

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.080
year-to-year stability at the school level and this is just a slice of the full results and

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.680
more details are available in the attachment that we've submitted to the board.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:27.680
The three rows of the table correspond to splitting schools into three size categories

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.400
based on the number of students with mathematics growth scores they had in 2018-19.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.960
The first row is for small schools quote-unquote where the number of growth measures is between

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:44.800
11 and 29 and just to be clear schools with 10 or fewer growth measures are not considered here

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.480
because AGMs for these schools wouldn't be reported. The next row is for the medium-sized

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:56.560
schools and the last row contains all of the larger schools and now look at the middle column.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.520
The middle column is for simple averages and the numbers here are correlations

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:08.640
between a school's simple average mathematics AGM from spring 2018 and the school's simple

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:15.040
average mathematics AGM from spring 2019. The correlation can be thought of as a measure of

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:21.520
stability of the AGMs across years and larger values of the correlation mean stability is

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:27.520
higher or that fluctuation is lower and looking at the middle column for the simple averages we

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.480
see that the correlation is lowest for the smallest schools and highest for the largest schools

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.520
which is consistent with the fact that simple averages are less accurate for smaller schools

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.720
and we know that lower accuracy decreases year-to-year stability. The last column provides

01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.600
the corresponding correlations for the e-blups and we see that these correlations are larger

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:55.040
for all the school size categories meaning that the e-blup measures fluctuate less from year to

01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.840
year for the same school than the simple averages do and also note that looking at the first row

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.480
e-blup creates the largest improvements in stability for the smallest schools which is what we want

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:13.360
because what this does is decrease the disparity in year-to-year stability across schools of

01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:20.480
different sizes so e-blup hit the school level improves stability overall and reduces disparities

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.440
in stability across schools serving different sizes of student populations. Next slide please.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:33.920
This is analogous but this is at the LEA level rather than school level and again we broke the

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:39.200
LEAs into three size categories and we consider in the middle column the year-to-year correlations

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:46.240
of the simple averages and in the last column the year-to-year correlations of the e-blups

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:51.360
and very similar to what we saw with schools, e-blup improves cross-year stability particularly

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.200
for smaller LEAs. It has almost no effect on stability for large LEAs because in that case

01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.520
the e-blups are extremely similar to the simple averages because as many of the sample sizes there

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:13.280
are extremely large. Next slide. So those are the key findings regarding year-to-year stability. Now

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:19.360
I want to present some results on accuracy. e-blup is a method that theoretically is designed to

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.760
improve accuracy and we wanted to see to what extent these theoretical benefits were actually

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:32.240
realized with California growth data. And as before here's a slice of results for school level

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:37.840
mathematics AGMs and again we broke the schools into size categories and for each size category

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:43.360
we computed the percentage of schools for which the e-blup method improves accuracy

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.720
relative to the simple average. And these percentages are in the last column and make

01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:53.520
clear that e-blup is actually improving accuracy for all schools regardless of size.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:01.920
The attachment to the board agenda provides some more details about the actual magnitudes of these

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:07.920
accuracy improvements but just to summarize, consistent with the theory, e-blup has relatively

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:13.040
large accuracy improvements for smaller schools and then the size of the accuracy improvement

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:22.400
goes down as school size gets larger. So next slide. So the story is actually less clean at

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:28.480
the LEA level. This table here is analogous to the previous one but is now at the LEA level and again

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:34.880
we use three size categories. And we see that e-blup does improve accuracy for all the smaller

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:40.160
LEAs but unfortunately this is not the case for larger LEAs. Specifically there are some larger

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:46.000
LEAs for which the e-blup is actually less accurate than the simple average. To be clear,

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.280
the simple averages in e-blups are extremely similar for large LEAs so it's not as if the

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:56.160
e-blup method is producing bad or misleading results, it's just that whatever additional

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:01.760
changes or adjustments it's making to the simple averages don't appear to provide any benefit in

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:08.800
terms of accuracy and in fact for many large LEAs are reducing accuracy by a small amount.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.600
So next slide, last slide actually.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:21.920
Next slide please. So as a result of these findings CDE is recommending further evaluation

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.520
of options for reporting AGMs for large LEAs because the goal is to provide the most accurate

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:33.840
possible AGMs for all LEAs and right now the e-blup is not quite there. And with that I will stop and

01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:40.240
take questions. Well we do have one more slide before we go to questions. Oh sorry. I just wanted

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:48.960
to point out though that the TDG is in alignment with the department's recommendation. So if we

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:58.320
if ETS does this additional work that's going to modify our timeline. So I wanted to be very clear

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:05.440
that this additional work will push the timeline for when we can release the growth model. So

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.080
with this additional work we will not be bringing a growth model to the board for approval until

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:21.600
the March 2021. That means we'll release the data based on prior CAFS data from 2016 to 2019 for

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:29.760
informational purposes only in April of 2021. And then from April 2021 through November 2022

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.280
we will work with LEAs and stakeholders on communications trying to figure out the best

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:42.080
way to display the data, provide hopefully some tools for LEAs to use as they talk with their

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:49.680
schools and with their parents and community. Then when we produced the dashboard in December

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:56.480
of 2021 it's really important to understand that we will not have another set of growth scores

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:02.320
and that we will continue to use the academic indicator methodology that is currently on the

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.520
dashboard and this is because in order to get a growth score you have to have two consecutive years

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:15.120
of data. So we won't have that until December of 2022 and that's when we will have the CAFS data

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:22.480
from 21 and from 22 and that's how we'll get that growth score. So with that we'll open it up for

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:29.600
technical questions. All right are there clarifying questions from anyone?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:45.360
I'm going to use wait time. I know you've all been calculating. Here we go Patricia and then Sue

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:55.840
and then Cynthia. Patricia. Well I want to begin by thanking you for doing this presentation

01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:04.160
and for trying to lower the register of English that you used for explaining the statistical model.

01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:10.960
So my clarifying question is and I'm especially concerned and first of all I'm impressed but I'm

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:18.160
especially concerned about the differences on how the model works between small schools and large

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:26.960
schools. On some previous developments on the conversation about growth models we've heard from

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:34.400
department staff about the fluctuations or the instability that does happen for these smaller

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:42.480
schools. I want to be clear that what you're recommending that this eBLIP could do is over

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:49.200
time smooth there would be smoothing in the growth curve over time that would take care

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:55.760
of these fluctuations for the differences when students drop in or drop out at small schools

01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:02.240
so that or are you saying that the model would not be intended to allow comparisons

01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:10.160
among schools and that the data for small schools has to be considered separate and differently

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:17.440
from the data that this would report for larger schools. Okay I'll take that there were actually

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:23.280
two questions there the first question is was about what effect this method would have on

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.960
the annual measures provided for smaller schools and yes there were two questions I'm that good so

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:35.120
yeah okay so the first question is from what we've seen so far the method will reduce the

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:40.080
amount of fluctuation that is observed from year to year in measures provided to small schools

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:48.160
and the second question was about comparability these measures ought to be as comparable at

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.720
least as comparable across schools of different sizes as simple averages would be and one might

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:59.760
argue that they are even more comparable because the method reduces the disparity in accuracy of

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.760
the measures across large and small schools now you can't get around the fact that you're always

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:10.000
going to have more accuracy in school in schools like school a with 1200 growth scores versus

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.280
schools like school b if you compare the simple averages for those two types of schools you don't

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.240
really know what you're going to get because the simple average for school b is so unstable and low

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:26.640
accuracy the e-blop method does reduce that disparity to some extent and so I don't think

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:33.200
that there is any more or less uh comparability across schools with the e-blop method and if

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:39.920
anything it would probably make numbers more comparable okay and then my final question so

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:46.560
when I see this report what I'm supposed to understand or what I'm supposed to be able

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:54.560
to glean and conclude from the information the report will give us is growth over time

01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.640
at the school or the student level based on the scores that were used to create it

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:06.400
it's the inferences at the school level would be inferences about the average growth for students

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:13.280
in that school in a particular year in a particular subject and go ahead go ahead no go I'm sorry I

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:20.320
interrupted you I haven't a little bit of an echo go ahead okay the the method um is not intended to

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:27.760
alter or uh make reporting down at the student level any more or less reliable because it doesn't

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:33.440
alter the growth scores for individual students it just changes how they're aggregated to produce

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:39.200
average growth score measures for lea's and schools and subgroups within those entities

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:46.800
okay thank you very much this was very helpful for me thank you okay thank you so I just want

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:51.760
to clarify that we would not be reporting growth at the student level but at the student group level

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.480
just to be clear

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:02.080
uh the next person I have in the queue is Cynthia and Sue did you have your hand up earlier yeah

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:10.240
right right after Cynthia then Cynthia thank you thank you very much and I believe Sue had

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:16.080
her hand up before me okay that's modeling a good etiquette

01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.280
so you're next

01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:28.080
you want me to go yeah please so I would just say um echo what uh member Rucker said

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.920
I really appreciate the presentation it helped to clarify many questions for me um so these are

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:40.320
sort of future questions assuming that we do additional study I wonder whether you've looked

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:47.360
at um how this model affects student growth I mean for student group changes

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.600
whether it helps in that regard or if you've modeled that at all and then the second question

01:23:53.600 --> 01:24:00.720
is I assume that if we were to adopt this that when we have science test scores we potentially

01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.720
have the same challenge and we'd have to do some kind of weighted average smoothing once those

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:13.120
science test scores become available thank you okay I'll take both of those questions

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:18.080
on the first one our report did look at the performance of the method for estimating

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:24.000
average growth for socioeconomically disadvantaged students and students with disabilities

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:31.600
not surprisingly since many schools have small counts of those particular groups of students

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.640
um the method does greatly improve year-to-year stability for the averages for

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:44.160
those uh subgroups of students and that is detailed in our attachment as well as our report to the

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:52.960
tpg um if there are regarding science scores if there is a way to use the science scores to

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:58.560
compute growth in science uh the method theoretically has no limitation with respect to

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.720
stacking together individual growth scores across multiple subjects

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:06.800
I don't know enough about the details of how science is going to be

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.280
fielded to know whether science growth scores would be possible to compute

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:24.960
okay um I think next we have Cynthia and then I have Ting and I have Eileen thank you um again

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.600
just appreciate the information and really the efforts being made to increase the accuracy

01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:37.280
and stability of the scores I know I may be preaching to the choir to say um the accuracy

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:44.960
of the scores is so critical as LEAs are writing their plans on how to best address student group

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:52.160
performance and individual students so again the data is as stable and as accurate as the data is

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:58.720
as good as the plans can be to support students overall so again just appreciate just the continual

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:05.680
look at how to make that happen I was concerned and appreciative of the indication on I believe

01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:14.240
the last couple of slides about the impact of the EBLIP to larger LEAs and how that level of accuracy

01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:21.440
is not as high as we would see for the moderate and the medium and the smaller LEAs

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.640
you did mention JR that there were some additional evaluation measures that

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.960
would be looked into to really look at how to best increase the accuracy of using the EBLIP

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:40.960
with larger LEAs okay do you have any information right now on what some of those additional

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:47.280
evaluation measures might be that will be explored yes um we haven't done the work yet but

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:53.280
the idea of the EBLIP is that it is intended to improve accuracy when you're starting with a simple

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:59.920
average that wouldn't be very accurate it is not intended to make the averages for large school

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.920
districts where growth scores may be based across tens of thousands of students it is not intended

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:11.200
to make those growth scores more accurate so the things that we are considering are figuring out

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.560
ways of simply not using the EBLIP for really large districts and there are a couple ways

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:22.880
of implementing that type of decision rule but the idea is that the method wasn't designed to improve

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:27.920
simple averages for very large school districts therefore we shouldn't be using this method to

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:34.880
report simple averages for large school districts so we are exploring ways of coming up with a

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:41.440
decision rule to decide when a district is large enough we wouldn't use the EBLIP would rather

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.840
just stick with a simple average but we have not explored the implications of those decision rules

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.840
yet thank you and i had one other question it actually is more a question for clarification

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:59.520
for jenny um you mentioned uh that the timeline would be uh let's say pushed out a bit to provide

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:09.360
more opportunity for exploration can you repeat for me the impact of this timeline change on

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:16.240
the dashboard and when districts may begin to see the growth measures in the dashboard

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.200
and again the goals that have been set out from doing this work

01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:26.960
just some clarification jenny you said it i'm sure i just want to hear it again sure um so

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.440
we had intended to release the growth scores in january for informational purposes only

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:38.160
so instead we'll be releasing them in april that will give districts some time to um to look at

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.880
um and to look at the growth scores and we can have conversations with them about how we could

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.320
report it so that it's easy for people to understand and we actually had a meeting with

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.920
kabe a couple of weeks ago and they have offered to help us put together some parent groups

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.720
when this comes out so that we would have some parent groups from kabe for parents who have

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.760
children who are english learners and then they can help us try to come up with a model for

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.840
communicating this out to parents as well so we're really excited about that

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.760
but for the it the soonest that it could be incorporated into the dashboard

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:24.400
would be december of 2022 because that's when we would have our next set of growth scores

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.840
based on 20 21 spring assessments and 2022 spring assessments

01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:39.440
okay um next i have ting eileen and matt ting i i just want to um echo all of my colleagues

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:42.960
and thank you for the presentation it was actually one of the more clear

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:48.320
and concise explanation of the e-blip um that i've heard so far so thank you

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:56.640
um i have a couple of questions and one comment um related to um what cynthia just said

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:06.160
um what cynthia just said with questions about the release in 2021 22 so first let me go to that

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:13.760
first the i'm you know we're all concerned i'm sure that uh because of the skipping of the 2020

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:22.480
administration of the test it's we won't know what we get in 2021 and so i wonder that you know we

01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:32.080
will be looking at um approving the model based on the the 2016 2019 scores so that we can kind

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:37.520
of see how the model works on those scores um but then you know i think we might get very different

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:44.720
results for 21 22 um just because we may not be comparing apples and apples given that we've got

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.280
this one year skipping and i just don't understand you know i don't know how you know technically

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:54.240
what that would mean and maybe we just need to wait and see what happens um with that and

01:30:54.240 --> 01:31:00.640
before we make any policy decisions um the other um the other question i had i think i may have

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:06.480
under misunderstood um i was really disappointed in the conversation at the last board meeting

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:12.240
because i thought we would not get individual student growth scores but it does sound like

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:18.240
we will have individual student growth scores upon which to base these averages we're just not

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:26.160
publicizing them so uh or we're not not reporting them but are we going to report them at um the

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:32.800
school level or we're not even going to report them in the individual student reports and um

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:39.360
or is that an ongoing conversation we need to have so i was curious about that so let me

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.240
address the first question about the one year skipping of assessments of course when we get

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:50.240
the new growth scores in we would have to come back to the board to take up and we would take

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:54.880
a look at them and do some analysis to determine if we want to move forward with incorporating

01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:02.720
into the 20 um the 2022 dashboard or if we want to make adjustments or if we want to delay

01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:07.280
so it will not be put into the dashboard unless we have another conversation

01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.720
based on the results that we see from 21 and 22.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.960
In regards to your second question i don't think that we've made a decision about

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:21.040
student level data and providing it to LEAs

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.520
we we will not be putting that information on the student growth report students already have a

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:36.240
growth report that that our assessment division has put a lot of thought in and has been well

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:42.000
received and is well understood by parents now we are not going to make adjustments to those

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.960
student growth reports there is some discussion about whether we will put it in the data file

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:52.320
that we give to LEAs but if a decision has not been made on that there are some concerns that

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:56.960
were expressed by people in the field that if districts receive that they would use that to do

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:04.720
evaluations on teachers and of course districts aren't allowed to use that data to do to do teacher

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.040
evaluations so i think that's an ongoing conversation that we're going to be having

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:20.480
over the next few months um i hope that answers your questions team it does it just um i i you

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:27.280
know i'm hoping that this doesn't just tell us what um more on student aggregate but i was hoping

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:35.440
that this growth model might help provide actionable data on a student level for LEAs

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:41.840
and classrooms and so i um you know i don't know i know we need to have more conversations on that

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:51.920
so i appreciate it okay we will come back to those topics i am quite sure um eileen um thank you um i

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.960
just first um thank you so much for this presentation and for the ongoing work to try

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:04.320
to get this right um i have a question jenny about um the disaggregate um for the student

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:11.520
suburbs so my understanding from the presentation is that we um in the analysis it was disaggregated

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:19.280
for students with disabilities and socioeconomically disadvantaged did we also um do any disaggregation

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.920
around all our other our english learners our our febs are to see if this is actually reliable

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:32.000
and accurate around the subgroup data that's my first question and secondly you said that the

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:39.680
plan is to release subgroup data um when we release this data so i just want you to expand on that

01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.840
i can take that if you wish jenny

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:50.880
sure um so we looked at uh those are the two groups of students that we did look at in addition to

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:56.960
all students and we we did this only because we had a limited number of limited resources

01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.720
to do the analysis and we're still in the stage of sort of finalizing the methodology and making

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.840
sure it makes sense and for example the decision rule about how to report these numbers for large

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:14.160
lea's is still pending the method absolutely does apply and can be applied to all the student

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.600
subgroups that are important to track in california and we have intention to use the method to produce

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.560
those numbers as soon as we finalize the exact under the hood details of the method i have started

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:33.360
to look at it a little bit for um some of the less prevalent uh racial ethnic subgroups and so far i

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.680
have seen no indication that the method is doing anything other than very much helping the accuracy

01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:48.640
of those numbers okay um and i'm sorry jenny yeah i just jenny what's the plan at this point for what

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:54.400
data would be then released and reported would all the subgroup data for all the groups that we

01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:01.440
report on be available to lea's we would we would we would release the data for all the student

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:06.800
groups that we currently provide data on and that also includes um separating out

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:14.160
as you know right now um on our detailed report we do provide data separately for el's rfx and

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:21.920
english-only students and we would provide that same in april so all student groups thank you

01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:32.320
thank you okay i have matt and then patricia and i day thank you so i'll be really quick as

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:37.600
board member sung and board member glover had had covered the questions i initially had but i do

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:43.600
want to thank you for this report this it was immensely helpful for me the growth model has

01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:49.040
been a long time coming and local educators have been asking for this for some time and it's amazing

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:54.320
when you go back into the timeline jenny how hard and how long cd has been working to get this right

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.760
and i appreciate the reality that we're trying to improve the accuracy of these these scores

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:04.080
prior to putting it in front of our districts where they're going to make decisions about how

01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:09.760
to improve so i appreciate it very much and the only comment i would add would be to board member

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:16.000
sun's comment that i know that we have a decision decision to make about individual student scores

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.720
and i know that there's some concern as jenny as you'd pointed out around how those scores might

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:26.080
be used but i think that we my food for thought would be just consideration for the reality that

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:32.960
if we want districts to be able to improve and support their students i don't necessarily believe

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.840
that it's in in in their best interest or students best interest to hold back data that could be

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.720
helpful well that's all i have to say thank you for the report though it's very good very nice

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.160
very very informative great patricia and then i day

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.600
and hopefully at that point we can move on to the next item

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:01.920
with respect president darling ham and since i'm asking a question for the second time i'd i'd let

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:07.200
i i would like to let i day go first and then i'll i'll come back all right we are modeling good

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:11.920
etiquette this morning i day thank you so much board member wrecker and thank you for the

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:18.720
presentation and i just want to what i was going to say has been said but i just want to echo how

01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:24.640
important it is to you know be able to break down the data so it'll be useful for us especially

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:33.440
with our large english learner population that we're able to see you know the the data broken down

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:39.360
with you know the rfs and the el within this model and i'm glad to see that it's

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:48.240
that this was just a sample but that it can all be done so thank you terrific and patricia

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:57.280
okay thank you very much i just want to just ask a clarifying question and also make a comment

01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:03.360
concerning the how the data that's being reported at the individual student level

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:11.840
if i heard correctly and i'm asking the um either the staff or the presenter who i explained the

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:17.840
model to us to clarify this because i believe i'm going to make a misstatement here there is

01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:26.960
this issue about the model and how it works with very large school districts and i think i heard

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:35.360
in the presentation that some consideration has to be made for deciding whether or not to use this

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:44.320
model at all with very large school districts by define by creating criteria that defines very large

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:53.920
is that did i misunderstand that oh that's exactly accurate okay so this would be my concern about

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.760
what i'm hearing my colleagues on the board saying about what is good what could be given

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:06.640
to school district there is a possibility going forward with this model that we're already going

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:15.600
to be differentiating what what is reported for all school districts in the state so i'm not sure

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:22.720
what is the utility for providing data to some schools that will be whose data and statistics

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:28.960
about student performance will be analyzed by this model while other school districts that

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:36.480
serve very large and significantly a significantly large portion of our student population overall

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:43.760
will not have that same information so while i think it's important to have that conversation

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:50.000
i think it's also equally important to be aware of what we're differentiating and what we're

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:56.320
trying to provide in a uniform and consistent way so that the conversation about student performance

01:40:56.320 --> 01:41:02.720
is also uniform and consistent across the models that we're trying to implement here so that's the

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:10.160
only thing i wanted to say about that chair go ahead okay i was going to take this i i apologize

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:17.600
if i was not clear there the idea for large school districts wouldn't be to simply not report

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.960
averages it's just a matter of which exact methodology is going to be used to compute the

01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:28.880
average that's reported right the idea for a large school district is just taking the simple average

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.720
of the growth scores either for all students or even particular subgroups of students those numbers

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.200
are already going to be highly accurate so that is what would be reported and the e-blot method

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:45.120
would just not be used to produce the averages but it wouldn't be the case that districts

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:49.920
wouldn't get those averages reported it's just a matter of changing the count switching back

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:54.720
to the sort of simple average approach for that reporting rather than relying on the e-blot method

01:41:54.720 --> 01:42:00.640
which is designed to improve accuracy for cases where the averages would not be based on many

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:08.480
students so just to underscore everybody gets the same data yeah yeah everyone yes okay so no that's

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:15.920
helpful uh let me uh if if by the time you are ready to start writing this report and producing

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.960
this information the thing i love about you mathematicians and statisticians you love to

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:28.960
use those big 24 dollar words so if i'm still on the board when you are are putting this report

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:35.440
together as a former high school english teacher let me help you write it in english for the rest

01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:41.680
of us who don't understand or translate it for you for into english for a standardized english

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:47.120
for the rest of us who don't understand what you just explained i get it but that's not going to

01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:53.520
be clear going forward and lost somehow in the details of all this technical stuff so i think

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:58.400
it's very important for us to think about not only what you're reporting but how that's framed

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.920
i understood what you were saying and i missed that point so thank you very much

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.560
all right i think we have gotten our clarifying questions in thank you again for that wonderful

01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:16.560
and clear presentation and um we have one more set of um accountability items

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.720
great i'm gonna turn this over to jonathan isler in just a moment but before we get started on on

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.680
the specifics of this education code section i just wanted to provide some framing remarks

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:36.480
based on the correspondence we continue to receive on this this section of code and the first data

01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:42.640
set that we're going to talk about that's available it's it's evident to us that reporting out on on

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:51.200
data around teachers is is very important to to the field and to of course the board and so it

01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:56.080
it's not only limited to this code section we have an obligation to report this out because of the

01:43:56.080 --> 01:44:01.120
sark we have an obligation to report this out to help districts with their local control and

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:07.120
accountability plans and so i want to make sure that the framing of this is much broader than

01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.320
just this one code section and we know based on prior experience specifically around discipline

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:19.040
data and the release for the first time of suspension data by student groups how much

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:23.360
of an impact that makes for the field it doesn't have to be part of an accountability system

01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:28.640
to make um to make differences in schools and districts we saw with the release of that data

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:35.680
file prior to coming even into the accountability system actionable uh practices that affected

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.400
students and we saw we've seen a steady decrease over the last several years if not

01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.600
since the data was first put out of suspension um suspensions of students for specific student

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:53.280
groups and so just to put that framing in mind um we're really excited about the data set that

01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:58.000
jonathan's going to talk about today um but we just need to get the data set out and i think

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.400
that that will be the start of the conversation around this education code section and our

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:11.360
obligations to implement it great thank you hopefully everyone can hear me good morning

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:16.400
everyone members of the board president darling hammon i just wanted to personally wish karen

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.560
staff walters well we miss you a lot and i've really enjoyed working with you the last several

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:27.840
years so good luck to you so i'm jonathan eisler i am the administrator for the data visualization

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.480
and reporting office at the cde and i work directly with cindy in the accountability division

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:40.480
wanted to talk this morning about california education code section 52064.5 as all of you

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:47.840
know this was passed many years ago and required the state board on or before october 1st 2016

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:53.040
to adopt what were then known as evaluation rubrics of course now we know better known

01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.720
as the california school dashboard as a tool to help districts and schools identify strengths and

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:04.480
weaknesses and to provide assistance to county superintendents in identifying school districts

01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:10.400
and charter schools that needed technical assistance as part of this context these

01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:15.680
state and local measures are actually drawn from the 10 priority areas of the local control funding

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:25.760
formula or lcff which is also required in california education code 52064.5 last year in 2019

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:32.480
california senate bill 75 updated that education code with additional information about local

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:39.840
indicators so just as a refresher for everyone these are the list of the different priority

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:45.760
areas and local indicators under lcff obviously all of these are important but this morning our

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:52.640
focus is going to be really primarily on priority one the basics and looking at text textbook access

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.680
and availability school facilities and good repair and in particular talking about appropriately

01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.880
assigned and fully credentialed teachers as cindy mentioned it's really important to note

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:08.400
that this information is required annually in the school accountability report cards or sarx

01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:14.240
and that information is going to continue to be reported this this current year and ongoing so

01:47:14.240 --> 01:47:20.880
just wanted to provide that additional background and context for the state and local indicators

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:28.480
so senate bill 75 like i said was passed in 2019 it does provide a time frame and some direction

01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:34.640
on the consideration for inclusion of indicators in our accountability system quote no later than

01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:40.720
january 31st 2021 local indicators shall reflect school level data to the extent the department

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:46.080
collects or otherwise has access to relevant and reliable school level data for all schools

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:50.880
statewide and what's really important here is that relevant and reliable

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:56.880
school level data which we'll talk about in a little bit so the cd has been reviewing the

01:47:56.880 --> 01:48:02.240
different local indicators and in particular we identified priority area one that appropriate

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:07.840
assigned and fully credentialed teachers as a data set that could potentially be it is being

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.160
collected for the first time right now and we're looking into the fact that it may meet the

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:18.000
standards under sb 75 for local indicators so again right now very much in an exploratory phase

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.640
of looking how this how this may may be an important part of sb 75 for local indicators

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:30.960
so we're going to talk through in the coming slides just make clear that we do not currently

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:37.040
have a current full data set to do analyses to determine how reliable these data are for all

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:45.920
schools statewide so in 2018 the cd and the california commission on teacher credentialing

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:53.120
or ctc we entered into a data sharing agreement or mou for teacher and credential data and by

01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:58.800
which we provide them with staffing information and they were they will now enter that information

01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:04.000
into their california statewide assignment accountability system or cal sas in order to

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.600
conduct teacher monitoring the ctc when they receive these data will match these with their

01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.360
credential data and provide indicators to the cd in order to meet our essa or every student

01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:21.040
succeeds act reporting requirements and this is based on the what was approved by the state board

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:30.240
in their november 2019 meeting so this is an exchange timeline of what has been going on

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:35.920
since 2018 i do have really good news to report for that last item in just a minute here so in

01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:41.600
october 2018 we did sign a memorandum of understanding a data sharing agreement formalizing our data

01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:48.480
sharing last year in july we implemented an overhaul of our course codes in calpads

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.880
so in our longitudinal data system so this basically changed the way that these course

01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:01.120
data was entered into calpads by lea's that was originally scheduled to close in march of 2020

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:09.040
and then as i mentioned in november of 2019 the state board adopted the teacher equity definitions

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:14.880
under essa as well as made recommendations about state reporting requirements and then of course

01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:21.360
march 2020 comes and covid 19 hits so there were delays in the reporting of the calpads data

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:30.240
the fall 2 submission deadline was then extended to april 24th then this spring and summer april

01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:37.120
through july cde spent extracting the data and then the last couple months so july into just

01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:43.840
recently cde staff including from our accountability division have been working with calpads staff with

01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:50.640
our it folks to extract the calpads data and the good news is as of this week so just a couple days

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:58.000
ago the cde was able to successfully transfer these data over to the ctc so we're very excited

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:05.520
about that the last slide i just wanted to present here in terms of the process is now that we have

01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:12.320
provided the data to ctc they have a two-phase process by which they can then produce the final

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:19.200
data that they can send back to us in terms of assignment of staff so the first phase is for each

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:25.280
assignment in the initial calpads assignment data set they indicate whether the educator was

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:31.360
properly assigned or misassigned and if in and if there is a misassignment which dimensions of of

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.320
that that is indicated this is it's really important to note that that first phase of the

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:43.200
of the data processing the cd ctc conducts is not sufficient for what we need to do for essa

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:46.880
reporting so i just want to make that really clear that's the first phase of the data processing

01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:52.400
after they are able to accomplish phase one phase two will occur where they will then match the

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:58.240
data with their credential data and provide necessary indicators to back to cde in order

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:04.480
to meet our essa reporting requirements so as of right now we anticipate that the ctc will accomplish

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:12.080
these by early next year and then at that point the cde will have access to that data to begin

01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:22.000
doing simulations to look into the validity and reliability of that data so that is my portion

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.200
of the presentation

01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:32.480
we open it up to questions so we can i think either open up to questions or we can open up

01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:39.440
the whole item to to questions whatever your preference is president helman do you have

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:49.120
anything else in this section or prior to public comment the item sorry it concludes the item

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.360
right okay great so what i'd like to do is just take clarifying questions on this portion

01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:00.880
and then we'll get hear from our liaisons we'll open to public comment and then we'll have a

01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:05.920
fuller discussion so that we save our full discussion until after we have our public comment

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:14.960
um so are there uh any um questions clarifying questions on this i see patricia's hand is up

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:18.320
patricia

01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:22.560
did you intend for your hand to be up for this

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:33.520
i'm not hearing patricia where did she go i'm not seeing patricia i'm here

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:42.000
oh i i'm what i said was i apologize i had put my raised my hand because he was as he was closing

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.720
down his comments but he answered my question about what the next steps from the commission

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:51.440
were going to be so i don't the question i don't have that question anymore i apologize i didn't

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:59.040
lower my hand that's okay thanks um i do have a question and um anybody else does i'll keep the

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.560
matt will have one also um so first of all jonathan uh thanks so much for the very good news

01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:11.600
you know i'm extremely excited about this uh when i was chair of the commission on teacher

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.560
credentialing we were having these conversations about sharing the data the fact that the data has

01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:23.920
been successfully shared for those of you who have been watching this gripping um you know uh drama

01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:29.360
that has been unfolding for several years is a big big deal so thank you jonathan i know you've

01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:37.920
played an important role in that um and i just wanted to um return not only to the um state law

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:46.000
around reporting in priority one but to the essa plan where we also will need to be reporting

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.920
based on our educator equity plan um the proportion of teachers who are on waivers permits

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.800
um and then according to our educator equity plan interns fully credentialed and among

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:04.640
fairly credentialed teachers those who are um assigned properly and misassigned

01:55:05.360 --> 01:55:11.440
so i just want to clarify that while those analyses are going on the all of that will

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.800
be happening uh in that time frame

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:24.800
thank you yeah so um thank you president don hamman so um as of right now um we do not

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.160
anticipate that we're going to be able to to report that for the equity plan until

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:36.080
following year right no um next year i think is what is what you're asking about um whether or

01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:43.200
not the essa reporting requirements would extend out to priority one so essa has um more components

01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:50.000
than um basics does on priority one and and i i was trying to to preempt that with my opening

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.200
comment that um we we anticipate that uh what what is needed to report out on not only sarc and

01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:04.320
and and essa and then this component that we report on on the full data set that is available

01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:09.520
and the first step of course is simply to meet our federal reporting requirements

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:17.920
and that deadline is is february of this coming this coming year so 2021 um you know assuming

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:23.280
that we get um these two phases of the ctc is able to complete them in a timely manner

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.160
they do have an extensive process ahead of them to to work with the data it's very complex data

01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:34.880
but our goal is to get out a complete data set that could be used for a variety of purposes

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:43.280
right and isn't it um don't go away cindy because i just want to be sure we're i've understood this

01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:51.280
part um yeah part of our requirement to the feds is also to be able to say we had a had to tell

01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.600
them how we were going to identify ineffective teachers etc inexperienced teachers and teachers

01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:03.840
who are out of field and we defined an effective as teachers on waivers and permits um who are you

01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:12.320
know not preliminarily credentialed so that is actually easier to analyze than the

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:19.280
misassignment data which requires matching up by course codes that i know that's very complicated

01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:26.400
and the ctc has those data readily available so am i understanding you that that will be

01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:34.320
analyzed by them in this same round of analyses yes so the the first phase is of course to engage

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:43.040
with this new system that that ctc has um piloted in in the i think this this past spring to have um

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:50.160
lea's you know proactively talk about um whether or not the educator was properly assigned the the

01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:57.120
greater detail and the amendments that you made to the estate plan last november is on the ctc's

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:03.200
plate for phase two so there i know that they're trying to do this in a somewhat parallel process

01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:08.240
but um we understand you know they know the requirements that that you have laid out under

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:14.160
essa this is the the careful dance between state agencies um where we we work together

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.680
but i anticipate we'll have that that full file um you know whether it's the end of this year or

01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:25.440
early next year to meet all the components that you have to meet all the components and then when

01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:31.680
we do our sark we'll be able to you know we have these requirements coming in we've we've put them

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:37.840
in place in different plans and in different places under esa under our educator equity plan

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:43.840
under the state priorities but it makes sense to kind of put them all together in one reporting

01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:50.240
place um in the sark i assume is where that would be is that your understanding

01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:56.480
so the sark is always one year in a rear so we do already have the sark data so that that data will

01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:02.560
be provided but i think what she's asking she's suggesting jonathan is to have an extended a

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.120
report out of what's currently in the sark um so that you know the board has the responsibility

01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:12.160
of adopting that template every july and so we'll bring that back to you in july of 2021

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:19.520
if you decide to expand out on on you know the legal statute around that um but i think it

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:26.160
makes sense to have the same data set available in each of the places in which it lives instead of

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:31.840
you know like like i mentioned this is a data set and if we're going to have just a portion of it

01:59:31.840 --> 01:59:37.920
someplace and another portion in another place it's not it's not really easy to find so no that is

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:43.440
work that would be ahead of us this spring as we prepared it to get the data set out just period

01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:47.520
out on on data quests and then from there figure out where else we can populate it into those

01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:54.880
areas where we know we have to report out on some version of staffing information right yeah that's

01:59:54.880 --> 02:00:02.880
great i mean this has been a you know long time figuring it out but um the uh the ctc routinely

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:09.200
reports um in its own reports the teachers on waivers permits internships preliminary credentials

02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:16.000
full clear credentials you know schools and districts need those data in order to understand

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.080
what they need to be doing in their educator equity plans which we're going to be asked

02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:26.240
to approve shortly in this meeting um the plans that come up from the locals there's a lot of

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:34.800
desire for us to be able to give a clear rendering of what's going on on that very very important

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:42.240
component of equity if we don't know where we have to make investments to get a well-qualified

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:48.960
teaching force it's hard to figure out how we're going to make progress on those those agendas and

02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:54.400
mrs simon is identified as one thing but it is actually the tiniest portion of the problem

02:00:54.400 --> 02:01:00.720
it is not the major concern that a lot of communities have around um getting plans in

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:06.960
place to strengthen the teaching force so i just want to be sure that we're maintaining a clear

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:12.320
focus on how to bring all these pieces together because they've been living as you said jonathan

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:18.240
in different places and we have to figure out how to put them together in a way that is useful

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:25.200
for the state and for local communities to address this really pressing set of issues so

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:30.800
thank you for the progress you're making um and we'll look forward to the pieces coming out

02:01:30.800 --> 02:01:39.200
hopefully um as quickly as possible i know the ctc is working um as hard as they can on it so

02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:44.480
eager for the next report and i know are there any other i was just going to say one other thing

02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:49.600
and i know you know that we're in very regular contact with ctc staff on all of these items so

02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:54.560
yeah yeah and we appreciate that and thank you so much for your report are there any other

02:01:54.560 --> 02:02:00.880
clarifying questions before we begin to move to public comment all right um i'm going to ask that

02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:08.480
you go ahead and put the public comment slide up um and then uh we will when that comes up we'll

02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:16.960
open the phone line for the public comment uh queue and members can call in is that is that

02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:27.200
there i've got so many screens open the dialing in number there yes linda it's up okay okay great

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:32.560
i have multiple screens covering each other so that i can see the people in the hands and the

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:37.200
and the slides um so while we're waiting for members of the public to call in because there

02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:45.600
is a little bit of a lag time i want to ask super first and then eileen strouse as our accountability

02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:52.000
liaisons if they have any initial framing comments and then we'll take public comment and then we'll

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:06.240
come back for discussion so thank you yeah sure um so first of all i just um sorry to remember

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:11.760
the very beginning but i would like to reinforce i think what cindy led with and i think it's so

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:17.680
important for all of us to realize the level and depth of outreach that the department staff and

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:24.160
the board staff do with our various stakeholder groups is really to be commended and they're very

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:31.280
thoughtful collaborative they take you know every minute of time that they have to try to make sure

02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:36.480
that they're understanding people's concerns and to the extent they can addressing them in the

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:43.920
very complicated area so just wanted to say that as a as a start um and i think i don't need to

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:47.920
go into a lot of other detail i think we've had a full discussion actually of each one of the

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:54.480
components and when you're ready linda i'm happy to make a motion to approve the criteria for the

02:03:54.480 --> 02:04:03.120
career measures terrific thank you eileen well let me just say um to cindy and jenny and the

02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:11.600
entire cd team i just so appreciate how hard and how detailed focused and how clearly they're just

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:20.080
pursuing getting all of these um details correct and and relevant in our system and i just think

02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.840
the outreach the communication just the work they did at cpeg and helping to explain everything

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:30.720
they just are just persistent and i just so appreciate all the work we're doing to get it

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:40.000
right um and i would make the second when we get ready for a motion okay you have dibs uh and so

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.280

we have unmuted you and your time starts now i'm martin and i'm this executive director of

02:05:20.240 --> 02:05:25.520
californians together one of our strategic priorities for the past few years is supporting

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:30.960
an accountability system that is coherent and effective for english learners for the past eight

02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:36.800
months we have worked studied with dr pete goldschmidt he is a professor at cal state

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.840
northridge who has served as the assistant secretary for assessment and accountability

02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:48.080
for the new mexico public education department as senior researcher at ucla crest focusing on

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:53.440
the use of growth models for accountability and evaluations and for the past three years

02:05:53.440 --> 02:06:00.320
with the council of chief state school officers to provide state departments of education support

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:05.920
to develop and utilize growth models to monitor programs for english learners he has followed the

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:10.880
work of the growth model advisory committee and the state board and has submitted a paper with

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:16.800
recommendations that we are supporting and hope the board will recommend while further developing

02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:20.000
california's future growth model thank you thank you

02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:29.920
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:32.960
now

02:06:38.720 --> 02:06:39.600
caller are you there

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:49.680
hello superintendent board members i'm pete goldschmidt professor in the school of education

02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:54.000
at california state university in arthur my comments are based on the brief that was submitted

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.080
to you and considering your growth model is important to not only consider technical issues

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:03.040
about the model and potential adjustments such as smoothing but equally important to consider the

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:08.640
context in which it would be used and its purpose if goals are to monitor progress gaps and generate

02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:13.680
actionable results and it is paramount that results are reported by substantively meaningful

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.880
subgroups specifically evidence suggests that the relationship between prior and current performance

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:23.520
is different for english language learners and reclassified english language proficient students

02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.320
and their english-only classmates there are knowable differences as to why eels and rfps

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:34.400
may or may not progress like eos on academic content thus is important that all preliminary

02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:40.000
as well as operational results are reported separately for eels and rfps el student success

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.800
does not end with reclassification so it is important to continue to monitor academic progress

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:50.480
so potential language barriers and progress can be identified effectively and efficiently thank you

02:07:50.480 --> 02:07:50.880
thank you

02:07:54.880 --> 02:08:01.680
next caller you're unmuted and your time starts now thank you good morning madame president of

02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:07.200
the board dr linda harley and darlin hamans and members of the board superintendent of the schools

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:12.000
my name is carlina gilera fort and i am the superintendent of the schools of the author

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:20.720
school district i would like to advocate for the board to make sure that the reporting

02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:30.160
of this process and this model separates eels from rfps as a school district superintendent i

02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:37.360
really need the information for each year's staff and myself separated so that we can see

02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:44.000
which one is the real progress of our eels and rfps and then determine what kind of instructional

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:52.880
strategies we will need including those two groups together will not allow us to look at

02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:59.600
the different points of data and strengths in areas of need for the two different groups so i

02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:05.200
really urge the board to look at the report and the thank you for your time with us two groups

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:08.240
separate thank you thank you

02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:16.000

cave i'm here to urge the board in their consideration of a growth model for california's

02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.280
accountability system that english language proficiency be included in the calculations for

02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:39.040
this model in a state like california and districts like ours where we have a little

02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.200
less than half of our students are english learners utilizing lpac scores within the model

02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:47.760
allows for better interpretation of residual performance gaps and changing gaps it is important

02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:51.760
that we recognize that some of these gaps are largely due to the insufficient english language

02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:56.160
knowledge skills and abilities of our english learners by including the lpac scores within the

02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:00.480
growth model we will increase the coherence of the accountability system and showing progression

02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:04.560
the lpac is important because it both informs us of the progress of our students english language

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:09.280
learning as well as how this language learning contributes to academic content learning i thank

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.520
you for your consideration and urge you to do the right thing by our english learners of california

02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:16.240
and the many school districts who serve them thank you

02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:23.840
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:10:24.720 --> 02:10:30.720
board president arlingham and members i'm shelly spiegel-kohler strategic advisor for californians

02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.040
together and i want to address one of the recommendations from dr bolster's paper

02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:41.680
in about including the english language proficiency level from lpac in the calculation of the growth

02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:47.360
model for current english learners i continue to serve on the growth model stakeholder group

02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:53.120
and understand the decision not to include demographics but we believe language proficiency

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:58.480
is different and that there is clear research that indicates language proficiency affects

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:04.320
academic achievement similar to the presentation that we had about the relationship of math and

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:09.760
lea scores setting growth for el's without considering their language proficiency

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:15.440
makes that unrealistic targets until english learners were reclassified we urge you to direct

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:21.200
the staff to do some modeling of the data without english with english language proficiency and

02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:26.880
without to see the current implications on our current english learners which might suggest

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:32.160
the return of the definition of the el subgroup for accountability thank you thank you

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.400
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now good morning president darneen hammon and

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:47.360
members of the board i'm russ barajas with californians together i appreciate the leadership

02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:52.400
of superintendent thurman and the cd staff for their great work and to dr goldschmidt to raise

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.680
some important points here the federal law mandates not only that we provide english language

02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.520
development to el's but that we also monitor their progress and once they are reclassified

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:08.560
we monitor them for four years and more to effectively evaluate their progress we must

02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:14.160
consider the expected growth trajectory for our reclassified students separate from el's

02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:19.520
federal law also requires schools that have a function to have a functioning elac made up

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.600
of parents of english learners to advise the principal staff in the development of a site

02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:28.560
plan that is responsive to the needs of the el's how will our parents be able to do this

02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:33.520
without disaggregating data for el's how will they know if there are set students are meeting

02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:38.480
expected growth targets parents want transparency so it's encouraging to hear that the cde is

02:12:38.480 --> 02:12:43.040
working with cave and others to put together parent groups for engagement so now we have

02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:47.280
the opportunity to adopt thank you callers model let's make it work thank you thank you

02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:57.040
next caller you are muted and your time starts now state board members i'm evita armas director

02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:01.440
at lmu center for equity for english learners i offer these comments in support of the brief

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:07.120
submitted by dr goldschmidt in operationalizing the residual gain model we urge the board to

02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:12.800
avoid the unintended consequences of our current system that aggregates el's and our feds for the

02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.680
academic indicator english learner subgroup although it's been stated that disaggregated

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:23.280
subgroup data can be reported we need to consider modifying the definition of the el subgroup for

02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:29.280
academic indicators our examination of el dashboard results for this subgroup revealed that many

02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:34.480
districts in the yellow category had high percentages of current el's in orange or red

02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:39.920
thus diminishing the urgency for districts addressing their el's in the outcast only 57

02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:47.200
inclusive of 14 coes receive differentiated assistance focused on el monitoring and reporting

02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:52.880
our grip and el progress has separate subgroups has the potential to rebuild in targeted support

02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.520
to address the needs of el students and foster intentional programs and services

02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:01.360
time those opportunity and achievement gaps thank you for your time thank you

02:14:04.240 --> 02:14:06.800
next caller you are needed and your time starts now

02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:13.840
board president darling hammond and board members my name is martha martinez and i'm

02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:18.160
the director of research and evaluation for steel i'm here to support the recommendations

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:23.440
described in dr goldschmidt's brief by including english proficiency levels in the growth model for

02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:28.400
el the state would strengthen the validity of using english assessments of language arts and

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:35.200
mathematics for el a test in english is a test of english this has long been the rightful critique

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:41.760
of using english academic assessments to monitor el academic progress and this is a major reason why

02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:48.560
rfp performance on s back test is so different from current el performance by taking el english

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:54.000
proficiency into account in academic progress as dr goldschmidt proposes we can create more

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:59.360
appropriate expectations for el and rfp progress and identify which schools are helping current

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:04.960
el's and rfp meet appropriate benchmarks and which schools are not thank you thank you

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:10.960
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.040
good morning board president darley hammond and board members i am

02:15:18.080 --> 02:15:22.880
policy associate at california together i'm calling her in regards to the recommendation

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:27.280
in goldschmidt's paper regarding the proposed empirical best linear prediction method

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:31.280
the sb should examine various options for stabilizing year-to-year growth

02:15:32.160 --> 02:15:37.360
estimates before deciding on the best method it's important to consider the impact and trade-offs

02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:43.040
between the eblp method and other methods specifically within the context of california

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:47.680
consideration should include overall stability stability by subgroups including both el's

02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:54.400
and rfp relationship between any single year transparency and implementation factors and

02:15:54.400 --> 02:16:00.720
interpretation for intended uses it may it may work it may very well be that the eblp method is

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:05.200
the most effective but it is important to present and review trade-offs against other potential

02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:10.800
solutions for results presented by all relevant subjects thank you thank you

02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:21.680
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now good morning martha ziragosa dies representing

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:26.400
the california association for bilingual education and californians together

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:33.680
dr goldschmidt's brief on the rg growth growth model reflects a broader vision of what it can

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:39.760
and should do please accept the recommendations contained in the brief including reporting

02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:46.320
current el's and rfp separately including LPAC scores and the calculation of the model

02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:51.280
and analyzing the impact of the model and stabilization techniques for current english

02:16:51.280 --> 02:16:56.800
learners and rfs implementation of these recommendations in the development of the

02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:02.560
rg growth model are critical in order to provide a more accurate analysis and data

02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:09.520
regarding the growth and performance of our english learners let's make this work thank you thank you

02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:15.040
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:18.000
now

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:21.600
hi my name is adam karenza mountain view elementary board of education

02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:27.760
the el cap should be written to address our current el statewide and in our district there

02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:34.240
is a need to accelerate and enhance the academic achievement of the el in our classrooms by only

02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:40.640
including a performance level of rfs plus el the academic indicator will hide the urgent need to

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:47.520
be targeted with our approach to program services and allocation with our el cap funds focusing on

02:17:47.520 --> 02:17:52.960
our current el mountain school district has done just that with a research-based pre-k to third

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:58.400
grade academic language model district wide but now we need to be able to follow those students

02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:03.920
into the upper grades and see the success and possible remaining challenges by seeing year-to-year

02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.720
match scores distinct for english learners and rfps in the growth model we would be able to

02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:15.760
document growth and design what is needed for our el pre-k through eighth grade thank you thank you

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:21.120
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:27.200
my name is lexi lopez from ed voice and i'm commenting on the student growth model

02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:30.960
thank you for releasing district level school level and subgroup data in december but we

02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:35.680
encourage the board to release historic individual student growth records to districts and schools

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:42.800
using 2017-18 and 2018-19 data to help educators better understand how the growth measure works

02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:47.360
ed voice also requests the board to require disaggregated english learner data english

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:51.680
learner and reclassified fluent english proficient subgroups have significantly different support

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:57.440
needs re-designated students are generally not likely to experience as much backside

02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:01.680
as english learners recent reports from the la times have highlighted the inequities these

02:19:01.680 --> 02:19:05.440
students groups have experienced during the pandemic and it's critical to state does all

02:19:05.440 --> 02:19:10.560
it can to adequately track and support over 1 million el students we also recommend the

02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.480
board direct staff to evaluate the use of a two-year residual gain measure of growth

02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:20.480
that students made from spring 2019 to spring 2021 allow for comparison to past growth value

02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.760
of the analysis would help the state and districts better understand the overall

02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:27.920
learning loss and loss that individual students and subgroups may have experienced

02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:31.840
including low english learners thank you so much thank you

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.720
next caller you are muted and your time starts now

02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:45.280
good morning my name is jessica saco with children now i would first like to urge the

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:50.160
state board and cde to begin the process of developing objective criteria for both fully

02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:54.960
credentialed and misassigned metrics of future quality as identified in priority one for the

02:19:54.960 --> 02:20:00.160
release of the 21-22 dashboard the data would be is going to be available via our essay

02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:05.040
reporting and it's critical that this information make its way to the dashboard and be incorporated

02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:10.960
into the LCAP process next i'd like to thank you for the excellent technical work done around the

02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:15.280
e-blip model i appreciate the presentation and the clarifications that have been provided today

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:20.080
we would like to suggest that the board does not have to wait to see actual data in order to talk

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:25.680
about communicating about the growth model or the use of growth data nor does it need the data in

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:30.560
order to have a conversation about how individual student data might be shared and the safeguards

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:34.960
that might be need to be put into place in order to be sure that it is used appropriately

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:40.160
finally measuring learning loss is going to be a critical need this year we need the board to

02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:44.960
direct time to develop methods to ensure learning loss and include possibly looking at individual

02:20:45.040 --> 02:20:47.360
student growth thank you thank you

02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:54.080
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:20:58.160 --> 02:21:04.560
good morning uh president dollingham and board members john afel from public advocates

02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:12.960
the i want to talk about the establishment of objective criteria for local indicators

02:21:13.920 --> 02:21:20.320
the reporting in the sark and elsewhere is critical no doubt but what's important about

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:29.760
ed code section 52064.5 is that there be objective criteria established

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:37.840
for local indicators so that means both for misassignments and for fully credential

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:46.800
the state has the cd has data sets now on fully credentialed teachers in every school in the

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:53.440
state and we should be getting those objective criteria working now the misassignment data

02:21:53.440 --> 02:22:00.880
we're glad to see that that is moving forward and it seems like with that time fully operational

02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:07.840
in 2021 we want the board to take action at this meeting to make sure time that criteria get

02:22:07.840 --> 02:22:14.160
established on september 2021 board meeting for next year's dashboard thank you thank you

02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:19.200
next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.320

i'm ishri aru senior director of field action and advocacy for link learning alliance the alliance

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:36.080
leads an education movement proven to help more students stay in school graduate on time and

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:40.160
develop the knowledge and skills employers seek for the future we submitted a letter but i would

02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:44.560
like to reiterate how much we appreciate the work the state board of education and california

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:49.440
department of education staff have done on the college career indicator in particular we support

02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:54.960
the continued efforts to add more robust career measures to the cci and we encourage consideration

02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:59.600
of additional ways to provide recognition for students who complete both a college measure

02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:04.720
and a career measure in the cci as opposed to one or the other as the build out of the cci moves

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.200
forward please know we are here to support your work and hope you will see us as a resource we

02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:13.840
are happy to share our data research and other support materials whatever would be helpful as

02:23:13.840 --> 02:23:18.800
you continue to develop a strong comprehensive and inclusive cci thank you thank you

02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:24.480
you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:32.400
good morning my name is lorraine richards and i represent california teachers association

02:23:32.400 --> 02:23:37.840
we appreciate the cda's update and work plan regarding the implementation of education code

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:45.920
section 52064.5 related to local indicators as laid out in the item the cda's plan to process

02:23:45.920 --> 02:23:51.200
analyze and report out the initial set of data under priority one is a thoughtful approach to

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:58.800
fulfilling the requirements of sb75 and the revised ed code priority one is comprehensive in nature

02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:04.560
and the ability to have high quality data points for its local indicators is important to fulfilling

02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:12.080
the basic services and conditions for the benefit of students cta supports the cte's plan approach

02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:16.960
and we look forward to having additional discussions on the implementation of education

02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:26.800
code section 52064.5 related to local indicators thank you thank you next caller you are unmuted

02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:37.200
and your time starts now hello madam president this is brian reeves calling on behalf of the

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:43.360
education trust west about the growth measure we think this is one of the most important things

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:49.040
that you can add to the dashboard it's going to get a lot of attention when it comes out

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:56.000
and i think to that end to be most productive we would recommend that you take steps to ensure

02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:04.160
broad consensus and buy-in to the methodology so we're requesting a lot of stakeholder input

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:11.920
lots of communication a lot of opportunities to ask questions about the eblip we don't want

02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:17.520
to be in a situation when the data comes out of having disputes over the methodology we want

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:23.920
the emphasis to be at that point about supports to lea's that are showing problems and really

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:31.200
talking about what we need to do as a state to accelerate growth our partners at kabe and keltog

02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:35.840
have been opinion leaders in this space so please work with them and listen to them which i think

02:25:35.840 --> 02:25:41.840
you're already doing time and we support the recommendation to disaggregate english learners

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:48.320
and rfx thanks thank you next caller you are unmuted and your time starts now

02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:57.120
good morning this is sarah lillis with teach plus california we just wanted to associate our

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:03.040
comments with those of our colleagues public advocates and children now to focus on to urge

02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:10.960
the board to set recommendations for identifying objective criteria now on priority one the local

02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:16.640
indicator we appreciate the really thoughtful conversation you had about the data but we believe

02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:22.080
that we could begin discussions with stakeholders right now about what that objective criteria might

02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:27.360
look like for fully credentials and misassigned metrics of teacher quality in priority one to be

02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:33.360
included then in the 21-22 dashboard we also associate our we also want to support the

02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:38.960
recommendations of our partners at keltog and kabe about again disaggregating english learners

02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:45.840
and rfx in the growth model thank you thank you and next caller you are unmuted and your time starts

02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:56.000
now good morning um dr sarla hammond and state board members my name is diane avu with the

02:26:56.000 --> 02:27:00.880
association of california school administrators and we want to state our support for the inclusion

02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:05.920
of dde's recommended career measures in the college career indicator we believe that these

02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:10.080
measures will be will provide schools with districts and districts with the possibility of

02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:14.640
reaching realistic but meaningful marks based on the well-earned humans of students particularly

02:27:14.640 --> 02:27:19.920
the work-based programs further these additions for the cci advance the goals of ensuring the

02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:24.560
indicator reflects both college and career readiness while we support the inclusion of

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:30.080
additional work-based post metrics and item two we urge the board to review and incorporate other

02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:35.840
important metrics particularly for students who pursue less traditional path in college and career

02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:41.440
this includes recognizing students as college and career ready and when they enroll in college

02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:45.920
courses through dual enrollment and alternative education programs in addition as the board

02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.880
reviews additional changes to the accountability system act to request the board consider active

02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:59.200
time published in may 2019 thank you thank you uh next caller you're unmuted and your time starts now

02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:07.600
good morning uh president darling hammond and members of the board this is liz dian

02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:14.000
the public advocate and i'm testifying to reinforce a point from the equity coalition's letter

02:28:14.880 --> 02:28:22.800
to talk about the two-year residual gain model there has been a lot said and done policy-wise

02:28:22.800 --> 02:28:28.880
about learning loss the state will be investing billions of dollars targeting this learning loss

02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:33.840
we think it's critical that there be a temperature check on the experience of learning loss and we

02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:39.440
would like the board to direct staff to evaluate the use of a two-year residual gain measure of

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:46.960
growth that students had made from spring 2019 to spring 2021 and allow for comparison to pass

02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:53.760
growth while this data would only be provided once the value of the analysis seems critical to

02:28:53.760 --> 02:29:01.600
understand learning loss that students have experienced we also want to align our comments

02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:09.840
around the english learner inclusion time with learner data thank you thank you

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.200
that concludes public comment for item number two

02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:26.000
all right uh we're now open for board discussion uh so who would like to kick us off

02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:38.640
well i i have some questions for staff oh here goes a hand uh patricia do you want to start us off

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.040
sure um the first of all i want to thank all the

02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:52.960
stakeholders who called in on the to give public comment i know this process is kind of unwieldy

02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:59.760
and so i appreciate not only the effort that was made to make the calls but also to participate

02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:08.800
and offer the feedback i want to also express my um uh thanks my appreciation for californians

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:14.320
together i received i'm sure along with the other board members a copy of the information brief

02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:21.200
that was prepared concerning the data system and the upgrade on what can be reported concerning

02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:26.160
english learners and i read the full report with great interest and in listening to the

02:30:26.160 --> 02:30:32.400
presentation that was made today it clearly there's a lot of new things that have happened

02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:37.200
and a lot of new and exciting considerations on the development of the growth model that we didn't

02:30:37.200 --> 02:30:43.040
have prior to today's meeting or at least that i wasn't aware of and i think a lot of work has gone

02:30:43.040 --> 02:30:49.280
on moving forward to address this and some of the requests that they've made specifically was

02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:55.280
what type of data can be reported about english learners is worth thinking about and considering

02:30:56.080 --> 02:31:01.920
that got at the base that their their paper gets at the root of the question that i really

02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:08.640
want to understand is what is the growth model actually going to report and what is what is it

02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:14.800
that we're considering useful information there is a difference between what is useful and reported

02:31:14.800 --> 02:31:21.600
to us about all students and what is useful and actionable when we start looking at disaggregated

02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:26.800
student subgroups and so in listening to the reports and the information from the staff about

02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:32.560
what their next steps were and are going to be i'm very clear that there's a lot of other work

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:37.600
that they're looking at on what the growth model will report and how it will function

02:31:37.600 --> 02:31:44.000
at the student group level so the request that i'm reading in this paper and some of the

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.000
recommendations that i'm reading are not incompatible with some of the efforts that they

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:55.200
are proposing for their data models and the data runs that they are going to be making to

02:31:57.360 --> 02:32:04.080
continue building out and testing the strength and the stability of what is reportable and doable

02:32:04.640 --> 02:32:10.880
in this growth model so i'm going and and in saying i said all of this as a way of background

02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:17.680
to suggest that maybe there are some things in this document in the brief that we receive

02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:22.640
that are not incompatible with what the department staff are looking at doing

02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:29.120
and continuing looking at the work and experimenting with reporting and the statistical modeling

02:32:29.120 --> 02:32:34.960
for data and assessment information that will be in the model so i would ask the staff to take a

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:40.400
look at some of those recommendations and where there's clear alignment and opportunity to take

02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:46.480
a look at what is reportable about english learners and what can be reported differently

02:32:46.480 --> 02:32:52.640
in a way that disaggregates more actionable information as specifically as as was report

02:32:52.640 --> 02:32:59.040
reported and requested from the representative from several of the lea's i think something worth

02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:05.520
considering patricia can you turn your camera back on we can't see you before

02:33:07.600 --> 02:33:14.000
my camera my camera's on i'm having fluctuating bandwidth problems so when that happens it

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:19.760
switches off so it'll come back on all by itself i haven't been turning my camera off my camera's on

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:33.120
okay i don't see any other hands up so i'd like to oh cynthia go ahead thank you i just wanted to

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:41.520
reiterate and echo board member rucker's statements i think as we continue to look at how

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:48.400
to best look at the e blip and how it can really help with accuracy and stability

02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:55.520
since there are going to need to be some additional runs if you will especially related to large lea's

02:33:55.520 --> 02:34:02.240
it would be helpful to see some information and some data related to looking at possibly

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:08.080
additional assessment measures like the l path what does that look like as it relates to accuracy

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:15.040
and stability and any other runs that might be helpful in us knowing that the stability

02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:22.720
for particular student groups is in place as well there's been a lot of work done and i know again

02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:28.720
the goal is to make sure that we're able to get this right when we start implementing and

02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:35.280
showing this information on the dashboard so as we are continuing to explore it would be helpful

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.760
to see some of that additional information in our next conversation

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:49.520
great i wanted to pursue some of the same questions and i wonder if cindy might

02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:56.160
come back or i don't know if this would be cindy jenny are you there

02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.440
maybe you could take down the stop sharing your screen and then we can

02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:09.600
see other that we can see things there you are great so i am curious about as others have

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:16.320
suggested this notion of including lpac scores is that something that's come up at all with our

02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:22.880
technical advisory group not to buy knowledge i mean the first that we heard of dr goldsmith's

02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:29.600
work was when the information was shared on friday as part of the public comments so

02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:37.120
we have been trying to review it just as quickly as you all have and i think if anything we can

02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:44.640
take this back and look at it further you know any additional work that is added to ets will

02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:49.440
have to consult with our assessment office because the contract is very limited in scope

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:58.080
there's a very tight timeline and work scope for ets to do this work on our behalf and so

02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:05.360
expanding that scope could lead to additional costs that we're we may not have the funding for

02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:10.400
so we just need to to take back and look through this a bit more but it has not come up to my

02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.280
knowledge it has not definitely definitely not come up in any of the technical conversations

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.640
especially with our technical design group okay well i hear some enthusiasm for learning more

02:36:20.640 --> 02:36:28.800
about it so it'll be great to see what can be explored i also heard a lot of the commentary

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:38.640
about reporting el's and rfps separately i know that's a question that comes down the road when

02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:45.440
we get to reporting you may or not be able to help me with this but but i have this challenge

02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:50.640
in thinking about i can understand why we would want to see how rfps are progressing

02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.840
after they become reclassified and they are a stable group at that point when they become

02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:01.920
reclassified so you can watch over time the dilemma we always have with the el group is

02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.600
that as soon as you are reclassified you leave the group so the group itself is not a stable group

02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:14.560
and it's hard for me to understand how we would let's say we have an el student in that group they

02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:21.360
become reclassified in that year if we report the el group by itself without that student the

02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:26.880
fact that that student main gains that student gets lost then because they they've jumped over

02:37:26.880 --> 02:37:32.800
the style so to speak into the reclassified group so they're no longer represented in the el group

02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:40.800
which means their their aggregate trend is inaccurate because some people have left

02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:48.800
is that something that's been discussed at all are there any strategies to address that fundamental

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:56.720
dilemma absolutely that prior to you coming on board discussed this extensively and actually

02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:02.400
voted to have the el group for the academic indicators structured as it is to include rfps

02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:07.360
for an additional four years it seems to us that there's there continues to be confusion in the

02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:12.320
field on what this measure will report out on and we will be we have committed to being consistent

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:17.120
with what we're currently doing with the academic indicator reporting out by student groups and then

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:24.560
for the el student group reporting out additionally between rfps and english english only so it with

02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:30.960
the additional disaggregation of data for this student group is is very unique but it's something

02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:36.400
that the board committed to several years back and nothing has changed so there just appears to be

02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.560
some confusion in the field that that for some reason we wouldn't be reporting on this data and

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:44.880
we absolutely are committed to to getting that information out to the field we know it's important

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:51.040
to folks that are especially at paying attention to so we would be reporting the rfps you know

02:38:51.040 --> 02:38:57.360
as a separate group so they could be tracked in addition to the el group as current instructor

02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:01.520
there's a disaggregation that is one click away from that student group on the dashboard so we

02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:08.240
would one click away okay thank you this was a long long discussion um a couple years back yeah

02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:12.080
yeah and i just wanted to you know kind of you know make sure that we were

02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:19.520
thinking about it and and clarifying what we're planning to do um on the objective criteria for

02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:26.720
teacher data that was called for um for priority one the percentage of teachers who are fully

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:36.480
certified as well as those who are certified but misassigned um we really um should be making some

02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:42.240
movement toward that can we look to the next meeting for some recommendation on

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:48.400
how to establish some objective criteria we can definitely provide you an update at the next

02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.880
meeting i think my my hesitation is i don't think by the next meeting we're going to have data back

02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:58.000
so your next meeting is in november we have a time frame right now that ctc won't be able to

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:04.160
give us the full data set back until december at the earliest and objective criteria to me means

02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:09.040
looking at this from an accountability standpoint which we all know we want to look at more than

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:15.840
one year's worth of data to establish those kinds of criteria those high stakes kinds of measures

02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:23.520
and so i i can't report out on a data set i don't have yet um and i'm that's my my hesitation and

02:40:23.520 --> 02:40:31.760
even um exploring objective criteria when i haven't even seen the data set so the data are report you

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:36.000
know it is one of these the the data on the percentage of teachers who are fully certified

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:48.560
uh in districts is routinely collected and reported by ctc so again this is a cross agency

02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.560
question so that we could talk more about what it will take to get from here to there but i think

02:40:54.560 --> 02:41:01.360
it's a useful point that we should be moving towards some objective criteria i just want to

02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:05.440
make one last comment on the question of learning loss that many people brought up

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:12.160
and simply remind folks that the department and the board work together to

02:41:12.880 --> 02:41:17.200
provide some guidance on formative assessments diagnostic assessments

02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:27.120
that have already been approved by the board and are listed in a guidance document from cde

02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:34.880
that allows you to track students learning gains and losses over time actually in a more

02:41:35.440 --> 02:41:42.160
specific way using tools that are specifically designed for diagnostic formative assessment

02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:48.560
and so there is a deep seated desire and need on the part of districts and schools to figure out

02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:53.280
where kids are where they've been where they're going how to get them there what progress they're

02:41:53.280 --> 02:42:01.200
making and those other tools which include the smarter balanced formative and diagnostic tools

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:09.440
the interim assessments which have been made much more specific and there's a whole new

02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:15.520
variety of those tools as well as other diagnostic assessment tools that many districts are already

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:21.840
using that we've encouraged all districts to take up this year if they haven't in the past

02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:27.920
should be being used and we encourage them to be used for looking at this question of learning loss

02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:36.080
now without waiting you know for a whole other reporting cycle of the summative state test

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:46.160
are there any other questions or comments before we make a i see zade is ready to contribute

02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:53.920
zade yes this is closing off of what president darlin cammon was just saying in regards to

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:59.920
learning loss at least i know that in my school district we've been taking i'm not 100 sure what

02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:04.880
the test is called but we've been taking a test to track learning loss and to make sure that that's

02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:10.960
accounted for so i thought that that would just be something interesting to throw into the conversation

02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:15.840
yeah i hope that your district's experience is happening across the

02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:23.760
state sometime in these next you know coming coming weeks with that matt you want to make a comment

02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:29.120
you know i do but we've we probably need to keep moving on and i can

02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:36.160
cover it later okay yeah no worries all right so i'm ready for a motion i think

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:43.120

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:51.920
discuss the federal addendum i am joined by cde staff josh strong barbara murchison veronica

02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:59.520
aguila as this item has spanned branches and divisions within cde each of my colleagues

02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:04.640
holds an admirable depth of knowledge and expertise in their respective fields so i

02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:10.480
will likely defer most questions to them this is the first time i've appeared appeared before the

02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:16.960
state board of education you have my title as deputy superintendent of instruction but i wanted

02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:24.480
to give you the briefest sense of who i am and what i care about my name is rachel maves i grew

02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:30.880
up in minnesota but all of my professional career has been here in california i have been a high

02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:38.480
school english teacher a curriculum writer an instructional coach a principal a district

02:48:38.480 --> 02:48:43.760
superintendent and most recently directed continuous improvement at the sonoma county

02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:50.960
office of education i'm married to a wonderful man and we have three children all of us

02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:57.440
and our dog are making the adjustment of having moved to sacramento friends it is hot here

02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:06.080
this is my 101st day at cde but given the current circumstances seems much longer i think many of us

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:12.720
would agree these last few months have felt like years my teenager continues to point out that

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:18.480
even my eyebrows are starting to go gray my hair was dark when i first interviewed for this position

02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:25.920
for this position a few years ago i was asked to tell colleagues in only five words

02:49:26.480 --> 02:49:33.440
my educational why and this is what i said to see the invisible child

02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:43.360
to see the invisible child let me tell you why i grew up in abject poverty

02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:51.920
in a violent and abusive home i understand the feeling of safety at school as the eldest of four

02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:59.600
my focus was not on school it was on survival i remember one of the houses we lived in the

02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:04.880
upstairs was condemned and two of my siblings and i slept together on a mattress on the floor

02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:11.840
when i was in second grade i received my report card and was terrified to show my parents

02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:18.560
on the bus ride home i crumpled it into the tiniest ball and shoved it between the seat

02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:27.920
and the metal wall no one noticed it was at that moment i realized the freedom of never having to

02:50:27.920 --> 02:50:35.600
bring home another report card along the way i experienced teachers that were my champions

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:41.440
and teachers that placed me in the corner of the classroom as if i were invisible

02:50:43.200 --> 02:50:52.480
for me education is not just a profession it is a deep seated call to see the students we serve

02:50:53.440 --> 02:51:02.480
to be their champion and we need to be effective champions when i took this position one of the

02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:11.360
first people i contacted was a man who has been my professional champion who saw me and he said

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:20.160
rachel to those who have been given much much is required you are leading at a state level

02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:31.120
lead well you have been given a platform speak well you have been given a charge

02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:43.200
knock down walls well that is my commitment and aspiration as i join the cde team to lead well

02:51:44.720 --> 02:51:53.200
to speak well and with your collective support and collaboration to knock down walls together

02:51:53.200 --> 02:52:00.080
and without apology and on that note i will transition to the agenda item before you

the approval of the local education agency plans as required by the every student succeed act

02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:14.960

02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:27.840
approval process as well as a deeper examination of our processes from one of our title leaders

02:52:28.800 --> 02:52:34.320
in march of 2018 the board developed and approved the process outlined today

02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:40.400
as required by essa your action is significant as a substantially

02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:45.280
approvable plan is a requirement for an lea to receive any title funding

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:54.080
the essa requires leas that apply for essa funds to complete an lea plan that addresses

02:52:54.080 --> 02:52:59.440
the required provisions of the essa programs for which the lea is applying for funding

02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:07.120
to ensure alignment between the local and federal law california requires leas that apply for essa

02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:14.560
funds to complete a local control and accountability plan federal addendum and the consolidated

02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:23.760
application in california the l cap serves as the primary strategic planning document for each lea

02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:32.000
within the l cap lea set goals plan actions and leverage resources in consultation with

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:37.600

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:49.920
while ensuring the eligible leas have the opportunity to meet all of the lea plan provisions

02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:59.440
of essa as a quick timeline and refresher essa was signed into law on december 15 2015

02:54:00.400 --> 02:54:09.040
in september of 2017 california submitted essa consolidated state plan in december of 2017

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:15.120
representatives from the cde and sbe participated in a phone conference with the u.s department of

02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:24.640
education to discuss california's proposed state plan in january 2018 the sbe discussed ed's feedback

02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:31.200
proposed revisions and approved california state plan pending the sbe executive director's approval

02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:52.160
lea submitted their l cap federal addendum to cde through the online system in april 2019

02:54:53.360 --> 02:55:00.720
beginning in april 2019 and continuing through the present the cde has provided ongoing technical

02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:07.600
assistance and support to complete an approvable l cap federal addendum as per the cde review

02:55:07.600 --> 02:55:16.960
and approval process together the l cap l cap federal addendum and con app serve as the essa

lea plan aligning state and federal resources and reducing duplication efforts for leas

02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:30.240
in march of 2018 the board approved the process and template for the l cap federal addendum

02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:39.280
consistent with the intent of california education code section 52064 the addendum allows an lea to

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:46.160
complete a single plan together with the consolidated federal the consolidated funding application

02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:51.840
to meet both state and federal requirements align state and federal resources and help

02:55:51.840 --> 02:56:00.080
minimize duplication of effort at the local level leas must submit an lea plan for approval

02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:07.520
by the state educational agency wants within california the california state board of education

02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:13.840
serves as the sea additional review and modifications to an lea plan consistent with

02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:21.200
specific essa title program requirements resultant of program changes or availability of new data such

02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:29.280
as the educated educator equity data are made at the local level to reflect the most current information

02:56:30.320 --> 02:56:36.800
lea's are also required to annually review their lea lea plans and update them as necessary

02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.400
at this point i'd like to provide an overview of the approval process

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:48.720
for the federal addendum lea submitted their federal addendum to cde

02:56:49.360 --> 02:56:57.040
via its online system to apply for essa funds for the 2019-20 school year lea's are required

02:56:57.040 --> 02:57:02.320
to address the strategy and alignment prompts in the addendum template explaining how their

02:57:02.320 --> 02:57:09.680
federal addendum aligns to their l cap lea's are required to address each provision for

02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:15.280
each essa program for which they are applying for funding unless the provision is not applicable

02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:21.840
to the lea lea's must provide a narrative that addresses the provision within the l cap federal

02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:30.400
addendum template the addendum approval process is an iterative process for each individual essa

02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:37.120
title program each program office work directly with lea's through the federal addendum system

02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:42.080
with emails and phone calls to provide individualized technical assistance and

02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:48.480
coaching as needed to ensure an lea's response to each of the provisions for the specific title

02:57:48.480 --> 02:57:56.080
programs reached a substantially approvable form the cde provided initial guidance on completing

02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:02.320
and submitting the addendum during a tuesdays at two webinar in april 2019 and posted guidance

02:58:02.320 --> 02:58:08.800
for completing the addendum prompts specific to each title program on its website i think it is

02:58:08.800 --> 02:58:15.360
also important to note that each title office holds deep expertise in their areas of focus

02:58:16.160 --> 02:58:23.200
their primary work at cde is to support districts on an ongoing basis as they address the varied

02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:28.960
requirements for federal funding reviewing the federal addendum is one component of the services

02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:36.080
they provide including ongoing support services and guidance to lea's webinars to ensure districts

02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:40.720
are receiving the most current information about program requirements and available resources

02:58:41.600 --> 02:58:49.200
conducting federal program monitoring reviews and much more they truly are the experts in their area

02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:56.720
of focus and used that expertise to review each component of the addendum to ensure that it met

02:58:56.720 --> 02:59:07.840
the requirements of federal law on august 26 2020 the cde sent a letter to lea's informing them

02:59:07.840 --> 02:59:12.240
that their l cap federal addendum met the necessary requirements for approval

02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:18.800
and would be brought forth to the state board for for approval in the letter cde strongly

02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:24.720
encouraged lea's to post their addendum on their webpage with their adopted l cap to provide

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:30.880
transparent to transparency to their stakeholders which at that time was all that was within our

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:37.760
authority to do as there was no mandatory requirement that addendum be posted following

02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:44.880
the approval of the addenda cde will notify lea's of the approval of their l cap federal addendum

02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:50.880
and we are pleased to share pending the governor's signature to sb 820

02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:56.960
we will also inform them of the new requirement to post their approved addendum on their website

02:59:57.760 --> 03:00:03.760
to provide a clear understanding of the rigorous process cde engaged in with districts

03:00:03.760 --> 03:00:09.840
i have asked barbara merchantson to join us as her team led the reviews for title one educator

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:16.000
equity section of the addendum each of our title offices holds a deep abiding knowledge of federal

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:21.760
requirements in their respective fields and engage in the same rigorous process you will hear from

03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:26.640
process you will hear from barb today and with that i will transition to barb

03:00:32.080 --> 03:00:35.120
thank you rachel and good morning president arling hamond

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:40.800
chief deputy gregson board members i'm barbara merchantson director of the educator excellence

03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:46.320
and equity division here at the cde i really appreciate having the opportunity to speak with

03:00:46.320 --> 03:00:51.440
you today about the l cap federal addendum review process my division reviewed several

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:57.360
sections of the addenda that were submitted by local educational agencies or lea's we reviewed

03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:03.280
the title two part a sections the title four part a section and the section that i'll be talking

03:01:03.280 --> 03:01:10.720
with you about today the educator equity section under title one but i do want to be really clear

03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:16.400
dozens of staff across the department including staff in the english learner support division

03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:22.240
and the student achievement and support division were involved in the review of federal addenda

03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:28.000
over the course of more than a year before i get into my presentation i really do want to

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:33.120
acknowledge all of the work on the part of those staff and the support that the cde received from

03:01:33.120 --> 03:01:39.600
the region 15 comprehensive center at west ed and the county regional el specialists to complete

03:01:39.600 --> 03:01:50.480
this work so we're going to go way back to 1965 i promise i'll move quickly but the elementary and

03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:56.880
secondary education act or esea which was first signed in 1965 really does represent the federal

03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:03.440
government's commitment to educational equity for historically underserved groups i can't really

03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:09.440
speak to the authorizations before 2001 but i do know that the esea is authorized under no child

03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:15.760
left behind and the current authorization under esse both have provisions related to ensuring that

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:21.040
low income and minority children are not disproportionately served by teachers who are

03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.960
inexperienced or not appropriately credentialed for the students or content that they are teaching

03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:35.120
we refer to these disproportionalities as equity gaps under no child left behind states were required

03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:41.200
to identify and address equity gap california did this through implementation of the compliance

03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:48.080
monitoring intervention and sanctions program under that program the cde required lea's with

03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:53.680
identified gaps to convene local stakeholders to examine data and develop local equitable

03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:59.360
distribution plans lea's were required to adopt board policies around addressing gaps

03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:05.840
if gaps did not close after a couple of years sanctions came into play and lea's were required

03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:11.440
to direct their title to part a funds to activities that would address those gaps like paying for

03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:17.840
additional coursework for teachers well a couple of things changed when the esea was reauthorized

03:03:17.840 --> 03:03:25.440
as esea in 2015 first under no child left behind the educator equity language referred

03:03:25.440 --> 03:03:31.520
to unqualified teachers recall that for many years the system paid a lot of attention

03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:39.360
to whether or not teachers were highly qualified or hqt hqt sunset along with nclb

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:45.360
and now under ese states are required to report on which students are being taught by ineffective

03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:50.800
teachers before ese did california did not have a definition for ineffective

03:03:51.440 --> 03:03:55.920
and the board and the department have spent considerable time addressing this new requirement

03:03:57.360 --> 03:04:03.440
the other big change under ese is that the responsibility for identifying and addressing

03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:10.800
equity gaps has shifted from the state level to the local level this is more consistent with

03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:20.000
california's local control system as well under ese the state evaluates and reports

03:04:20.880 --> 03:04:31.200
and lea's identify and address so here's the ese provision that describes what lea's are required

03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:38.000
to do around educator equity to address those gaps each lea must submit a plan to the state

03:04:38.000 --> 03:04:44.640
educational agency that describes how it will identify and address any disparities that result

03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:50.320
in low income and minority students being taught at higher rates than other students by ineffective

03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:58.400
inexperienced and out-of-field teachers the cde moving from a compliance role under nclb to one

03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:04.480
of support has developed the promoting equitable access to teachers or pete program to help

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:10.160
districts identify and address equity gap pete which is housed in the educator excellence and

03:05:10.160 --> 03:05:16.240
equity division is a suite of tools guidance and technical assistance i'm not going to go

03:05:16.240 --> 03:05:21.200
into too much detail around pete now because i don't want to get too far afield from the l cap

03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:26.640
addendum but i do feel that it is important for everyone to have this additional context we spend

03:05:26.640 --> 03:05:33.200
a lot of time talking about accountability through teacher data which is a key part of

03:05:33.200 --> 03:05:38.400
this system but i feel it's important for everyone to know that we see our work reviewing

03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:45.360
the l cap federal addenda as a key piece of the pete program the addenda work is embedded into

03:05:45.360 --> 03:05:50.560
a larger body of ongoing work which includes ongoing technical assistance and support

03:05:51.280 --> 03:05:55.360
and ongoing accountability through data sharing and federal program monitoring

03:05:56.240 --> 03:06:00.960
much more information regarding past and current efforts to provide low-income and minority

03:06:00.960 --> 03:06:08.080
students equitable access to teachers under the e sea is available on our web pages and

03:06:08.080 --> 03:06:17.040
president darling hammond made note of california's educator equity plans you'll see that on these

03:06:17.040 --> 03:06:22.800
web pages on these links which we get to from i think it's the main pete page we do have a

03:06:22.880 --> 03:06:28.800
i think it's the main pete page we do have two information memoranda we provide those to the

03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:35.760
board annually providing updates on implementation of these efforts and also providing the most

03:06:35.760 --> 03:06:41.680
current data and we will continue to provide that as required by our e sea plan and also i

03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:48.400
think it's really good institutional historical knowledge to to review the annual educator equity

03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:55.120
plans that were required under no child left behind multiple years for those are available on

03:06:55.120 --> 03:07:04.880
the pete web page so if you have time you know teacher data is is going to be a big discussion

03:07:04.880 --> 03:07:10.080
for the board moving forward and i think again having some expertise around some of

03:07:11.280 --> 03:07:14.080
these efforts as we move forward will be very helpful

03:07:14.880 --> 03:07:19.360
so we partner really closely with the commission on teacher credentialing on all matters related

03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:25.360
to educators as cindy and jonathan mentioned during their presentation of item two we are

03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:30.080
currently working with them to streamline the collection of teacher data with the intent that

03:07:30.080 --> 03:07:37.200
we will have better data quality and have it more readily available in one system we also in spring

03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:42.640
of 2019 partnered with our colleagues at the commission to provide trainings on a few key

03:07:42.640 --> 03:07:49.520
topics we shared updates around calpads we had just updated all of the course codes as

03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:55.680
miss assignment's become more consequential to the larger education system we looked at the course

03:07:55.680 --> 03:07:59.920
codes and realized they hadn't been updated since before the adoption of the common core

03:07:59.920 --> 03:08:04.000
so it was very much time to take a good look at all of those course codes and bring them into

03:08:04.800 --> 03:08:10.560
alignment with our current standards so we did that work and wanted to go out and talk to folks

03:08:10.560 --> 03:08:16.000
in schools and districts directly about the changes to those course codes and how they would

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:22.400
need to be entered into the calpads system so our colleagues in the calpads office

03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:28.720
were partners in this endeavor as well we talked to them about the new california state assignment

03:08:28.720 --> 03:08:34.640
accountability system or cal sass just so folks knew the changes that were coming around how data

03:08:34.640 --> 03:08:40.000
would be collected and shared and finally and most relevant for teachers and teachers is

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:45.360
relevant for today we shared information regarding the educator equity section of the l cap federal

03:08:45.360 --> 03:08:51.840
addendum we provided an overview of what would be required and information about the tools that

03:08:51.840 --> 03:09:00.720
could be used to successfully complete the section the team conducted 31 in-person trainings across

03:09:00.720 --> 03:09:06.960
the state and presented webinars to ensure that everyone could participate so we partnered with

03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:14.400
our counties and our county office of education colleagues and conducted 31 in-person trainings

03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:20.320
across the state there and after the training series was complete we followed up by offering

03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:25.680
weekly office hours so that people could ask specific questions on any of these topics and

03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:31.360
receive more personalized technical assistance more than 5 000 people participated in these

03:09:31.360 --> 03:09:37.040
trainings last spring and the recorded webinars are still available for anyone who is interested

03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:45.920
so if we were in person today i would probably take the chance of going out to the internet

03:09:45.920 --> 03:09:50.080
to show you some of these pete tools but since we're zooming i'm just going to give you a

03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:57.200
screenshot you can see on this slide that we have all kinds of information on our pete page

03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:05.040
to help people understand how to calculate equity gaps how to address equity gaps we've got updated

03:10:05.040 --> 03:10:10.880
teacher equity definitions as mentioned earlier the board adopted some updated definitions

03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:16.960
in november 2019 a big piece of work that we're working on is diversification of the teacher

03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:22.240
workforce click on that link there's all kinds of great information about why that's a good thing

03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:28.800
and some strategies through which to do it link to our pete training webinars educator equity

03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:35.360
data instructions tools how to do a root cause analysis engaging your equity stakeholders

03:10:35.920 --> 03:10:42.560
and research-based strategies for recruiting teachers and retaining teachers and as you get

03:10:42.560 --> 03:10:47.440
to the bottom of the page you can see that information around how to complete the educator

03:10:47.440 --> 03:10:53.760
equity section of the addendum is embedded into the pete page and if you click on that

03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:59.680
you can see the guidance that would lead you step by step through completing the addendum

03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:06.800
behind each one of these links are tools and worksheets and research that people can download

03:11:07.520 --> 03:11:14.640
and use to move through the process of completing the educator equity section

03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:21.200
of the l cap addendum successfully so i know that there's a lot on cde web pages

03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:24.800
and over the years have heard that people are sometimes challenged to find what they are

03:11:24.800 --> 03:11:31.360
looking for but to be really clear we shared information regarding these web pages tools

03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:37.520
and l cap addendum requirements with more than 5 000 people to get them ready to complete this

03:11:37.520 --> 03:11:42.240
section of their agenda so we didn't just post something and put it up and hope for the best

03:11:42.240 --> 03:11:47.600
we posted we created these tools and then went out and shared with thousands of folks

03:11:48.240 --> 03:11:51.280
the availability of these tools and how to use them

03:11:54.080 --> 03:12:00.400
so i very quickly moved us from 1965 to the summer of 2019 which i referred to

03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:06.720
as the summer of l cap addenda as i mentioned the educator excellence and equity division was

03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:12.880
responsible for reviewing multiple sections of the addenda so my entire 50 plus person team was

03:12:12.880 --> 03:12:18.960
engaged in some way we had a big kickoff lots of training lots of treats we're going to do these

03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:27.520
addenda all told 12 reviewers reviewed the educator equity section submitted by more than

03:12:27.520 --> 03:12:34.720
1700 lea's and again i need to thank our colleagues at the comprehensive center who provided

03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:41.760
support to help us with this task all reviewers were trained and calibrated on essa requirements

03:12:42.560 --> 03:12:49.040
the suite of pete tools how to provide the actionable feedback and tracking responses

03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:54.800
each one of our reviewers adhered to a rubric and written responses were standardized

03:12:57.760 --> 03:13:03.600
so here are the elements we used to assess the lea responses these are taken straight from the

03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:10.400
essa provision that i described earlier in this presentation did the lea describe its data collection

03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:16.320
process for identifying disparities did the lea describe the distribution of ineffective

03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:21.200
misassigned inexperienced and out-of-field teachers working with low-income students

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:27.200
did the lea describe the distribution of ineffective inexperienced and out-of-field

03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:32.800
teachers working with minority students did the lea describe how it engaged stakeholders

03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:37.760
in its process for identifying strategies for addressing those discovered equity gaps

03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:44.320
and did the lea describe the actions it will take to address any disparities discovered during the

03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:51.520
data analysis process if any of these questions was not answered completely the section was

03:13:51.520 --> 03:14:00.160
returned to the lea for more information so as i hinted at before the summer of el cap adenda

03:14:00.160 --> 03:14:05.040
lasted much longer than anticipated it turned out to be really a year of el cap agenda

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:13.600
after each submission the reviewer provided actionable written feedback to the lea via

03:14:13.600 --> 03:14:19.520
the addendum system many of the addendas you can see were approved after the first submission

03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:26.880
so folks submitted something and for some folks it was complete and considered substantially

03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:34.080
approvable and i should qualify here this the the cde did not approve el cap sections we approved

03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:38.480
them to move forward to the board for actual approval so substantially approvable

03:14:40.560 --> 03:14:45.280
many more of them were approved after two submissions so they got some feedback from

03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:50.800
us around what was missing and they were able to make those revisions and resubmit something

03:14:50.800 --> 03:14:58.160
that was substantially approvable we provided much more intensive technical assistance

03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:04.960
to leas with sections that were not approvable after two submissions for these leas in addition

03:15:04.960 --> 03:15:12.160
to specific actionable written feedback cde staff called the lea to help them to better understand

03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:17.920
the requirement and to complete the success the section successfully so quite a bit of

03:15:17.920 --> 03:15:24.800
individualized coaching happened if after the second submission the lea was not substantially

03:15:24.800 --> 03:15:32.800
approvable as you can see more than 300 leas received this intensive technical assistance

03:15:33.360 --> 03:15:40.880
with 55 of them submitting five or more times before being approved so and this again is for

03:15:40.880 --> 03:15:46.800
the educator equity sections this was happening for all of the sections in the el cap federal

03:15:46.800 --> 03:15:55.440
agenda in a variety of divisions at the department as challenges as challenging as it was to provide

03:15:55.440 --> 03:16:01.040
these supports over the course of many many months in addition to lots of other projects that staff

03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:06.880
have assigned to them i know my team is really grateful for the experience ultimately it was

03:16:06.880 --> 03:16:12.000
very rewarding to connect with our colleagues in districts to learn more about their workforce

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:17.840
challenges and to ensure that they understood the requirements of the law and the tools that were

03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:26.320
available to them the hard work of building and maintaining a strong stable well-prepared and

03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:33.040
supported workforce is ongoing and in the spirit of continuous improvement we adjust as we go

03:16:33.040 --> 03:16:43.520
so in september 2017 i mean november no september 2017 the board approved definitions for ineffective

03:16:43.520 --> 03:16:48.160
inexperienced and out-of-field teachers as part of the s estate plan approval

03:16:49.680 --> 03:16:55.760
lea's used these definitions to develop their el cap federal agenda educator equity responses

03:16:56.720 --> 03:17:03.760
and then last november in 2019 the board approved updated definitions for ineffective and out-of-field

03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:09.840
teachers to include more specificity around permits and authorizations that fall under each

03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:17.520
one of the definitions and now lea's will need to update their section of the el cap federal

03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:25.360
addendum related to educator equity with using these new definitions i think we've been very

03:17:25.360 --> 03:17:32.640
clear in writing both in the november 2019 item that presented the updated definitions and in the

03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:39.520
august 2020 educator data information memo that lea's will need to update this section

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:46.640
with these new definitions all along lea's have been encouraged to review the el cap federal

03:17:46.640 --> 03:17:52.960
addendum annually with their el cap as s of funding should be considered in yearly strategic

03:17:52.960 --> 03:18:00.800
planning we're optimistic that with the new cal sass coming online in early 2021 and with all of

03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:08.160
the training supports and technical assistance that we've provided to lea's to get their section

03:18:08.160 --> 03:18:16.160
for educator equity substantially approvable to you today lea's will find it much easier

03:18:16.240 --> 03:18:22.160
to locate the data they need and be able to update this section relatively easily and then

03:18:22.160 --> 03:18:28.640
they'll update their agenda in tandem with their el caps as they undertake that next spring and of

03:18:28.640 --> 03:18:35.440
course cde's federal program monitors will continue to review the federal agenda to ensure that

03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:43.760
they're updated as part of the monitoring process so to help lea's understand these

03:18:44.320 --> 03:18:50.400
expectations we're developing a set of recorded webinars that people can access on demand you

03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:55.760
know like scheduling webinars for a certain time and place has proven to be challenging as much of

03:18:55.760 --> 03:19:02.480
our lives moved into the internet so we're going to record these webinars these videos and release

03:19:02.480 --> 03:19:09.120
them this fall to help people be ready to update their el cap federal agenda but also to address

03:19:09.120 --> 03:19:16.320
equity gaps moving forward we this is an ongoing piece of work and the el cap federal agenda

03:19:16.960 --> 03:19:21.520
in our mind represents how things are going in a particular space and time

03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:28.560
so our goal is to have this set of videos posted and available by the end of this year and to

03:19:28.560 --> 03:19:35.440
reestablish weekly office hours in early 2021 as the new data becomes available in cal sass

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:42.080
and folks are undertaking the update of this section of their addendum we're confident that

03:19:42.080 --> 03:19:47.840
these additional supports will help lea successfully update their agenda and address any equity gaps

03:19:47.840 --> 03:19:55.600
moving forward so i hope all this information has been helpful and rachel and i and our colleagues

03:19:55.600 --> 03:20:04.720
online are here to support with any questions that you may have the recommendation is that the cde

03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:10.960
recommends that the state board of education approve the lea's addendum list referenced in

03:20:10.960 --> 03:20:21.360
attachment one of item three thank you very much um we're going to get to public comment

03:20:22.160 --> 03:20:28.400
quickly but if there are any clarifying questions that was a very thorough and clear presentation

03:20:28.400 --> 03:20:35.120
thank you so much barbara um we'll get the public comment slide up there i don't see any

03:20:35.120 --> 03:20:46.320
clarifying questions so let me turn to our liaisons um sue burr and eileen to um get us started with

03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:54.240
framing this sue thank you linda um i just want to express my very deep appreciation to both

03:20:54.240 --> 03:21:01.040
rachel and to barb for an incredibly comprehensive overview of how this process has worked

03:21:01.600 --> 03:21:06.320
um and also just to reinforce as probably the person who's been around the longest year

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:09.920
this is the way our federal work has taken place for many many years

03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:16.160
we rely on the department staff as you can tell and i'm proud to see the expertise

03:21:16.160 --> 03:21:21.840
and depth of knowledge that they present and the incredible process that they go through

03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:29.120
including enlisting the help of the comprehensive center on this work so just a hooray of great

time third time to get this line the way it needed to be so i have confidence in the thoroughness

03:22:04.880 --> 03:22:10.880
and also responsiveness to support individual districts and i also appreciate the recorded

03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:16.800
webinars and the continued support from the district so this money is tied to this and

03:22:16.800 --> 03:22:21.760
there's clear expectations of what districts need to do so i just really want to thank the

03:22:21.760 --> 03:22:29.760
department for their ongoing work in this area thank you really impressive um with that uh we

03:22:29.760 --> 03:22:34.880

comments i will open the phone line now um next caller you are you are unmuted and your time starts

03:22:43.520 --> 03:22:51.120
now my name is lexy lopez from ed voice i've always supported the removal of this item from

03:22:51.120 --> 03:22:56.240
july's agenda and we remain concerned and strongly urge the board to refrain from approving lea

03:22:56.240 --> 03:23:01.360
agenda this 90 page item only includes three examples of agenda with no links to the other

03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:07.120
nearly 2000 lea's which are recommended for approval very few districts have followed cd

03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:12.560
guidance to make their agenda public and of the few lea plans stakeholders have reviewed

03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:17.120
most do not meet federal essay requirements to identify and address inexperienced teachers

03:23:17.120 --> 03:23:22.400
teaching students of color and low-income students as noted in our letter ed voice urges the board to

03:23:22.400 --> 03:23:27.760
request how and why lea's are recommended for approval when they are providing inaccurate

03:23:27.760 --> 03:23:32.320
information to the federal government we believe it's improper to condone cd staff

03:23:32.320 --> 03:23:37.600
passively allowing lea's to obfuscate stakeholder engagement and recommend approval without

03:23:37.600 --> 03:23:42.960
verifying that cd guidance is followed by each individual lea in order to be accountable to

03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:47.040
address the needs of disadvantaged students and English learners thank you thank you

good afternoon john afro from public advocates i appreciate the training that the department

03:26:15.280 --> 03:26:24.000
has gone around the state on the teacher unmuted and the pete system the problem is that those

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:31.840
5 000 individuals were trained on the wrong definition the currently outdated definition

03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:39.360
of an ineffective teacher and that they need to be affirmatively informed that the

03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:45.200
definition has been updated and that they have the obligation to

03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:54.160
lea's have the obligation to update their educator equity plan people don't all read august memos and

03:26:54.240 --> 03:27:02.480
board items as as many of us do so we need the department to affirmatively send a letter to

03:27:02.480 --> 03:27:09.120
lea's informing them that they are obligated to update their educator equity plans according to

03:27:09.120 --> 03:27:17.600
the new ineffective definition by june 30th time thank you caller thanks

03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:23.280

03:28:43.520 --> 03:28:47.600
from the alley aids the con the last comment that was made by public advocates

03:28:47.600 --> 03:28:50.320
the last comment that was made by public advocates

rachel or barb do you want to respond to that how that's being handled

03:28:57.680 --> 03:29:03.280
yeah sure thank you so as soon as the board approved the updated um definitions we posted

03:29:03.280 --> 03:29:10.160
them on our webpage we've updated all of our tools around with with with the updated more

03:29:10.160 --> 03:29:15.360
refined definitions and as you can see on this slide or i hope you can see on this slide out in

03:29:15.360 --> 03:29:21.360
zoom a huge piece we're going to lead our technical assistance with how the educator equity

03:29:21.360 --> 03:29:26.960
definitions have changed right this is i think most lea's are aware we will continue our

03:29:26.960 --> 03:29:33.760
communications around this after the l cap agenda are approved by the board we will continue to

03:29:33.760 --> 03:29:39.200
communicate with lea's our county office of education partners who support lea's and anyone

03:29:39.200 --> 03:29:47.680
who will listen the education have been updated and that lea's will need to update this section

03:29:47.680 --> 03:29:53.920
of the plan and that we encourage them to do that using the new data that will be available

03:29:53.920 --> 03:30:00.000
through the cal sass system and with our support as they develop their l caps next year so yes

03:30:00.960 --> 03:30:05.920
a big part of our work is the outreach and helping lea's understand what is

03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:12.160
required and providing them with the support to meet those expectations thank you thank you thank

03:30:13.680 --> 03:30:21.200
i just want to add my thanks um barbara for both the history of esda which was a wonderful trip

03:30:21.200 --> 03:30:28.560
down memory road and the um you know description of this process um you know as i i know you

03:30:28.560 --> 03:30:35.360
believe the educator equity gaps are a really important part of getting to equity in this state

03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:41.280
it's so useful to raise consciousness about these issues i know there are glitches in the

03:30:41.280 --> 03:30:48.480
process sometimes but the various ways in which the data are coming online which allow us to

03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:55.360
um you know both at the local level and the state level to make policy decisions that will

03:30:55.920 --> 03:31:02.560
you know support as you said a well-prepared you know well-supported educator workforce are

03:31:02.560 --> 03:31:07.840
just critically important so i know you've been working on this for many years and your passion

03:31:07.840 --> 03:31:13.840
and commitment come through and i appreciate both how challenging this process was but how

03:31:15.120 --> 03:31:20.400
much you're gathering it together and moving it forward to keep that consciousness raising and

03:31:20.400 --> 03:31:28.080
those policy steps moving forward are there any other comments before we go ahead and take a motion

seeking to turn these immense challenges into opportunities to ensure that all children

03:36:18.080 --> 03:36:21.760
to echo president darlin hamlin receive the support and opportunities that they need

03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:28.160

welcome you and thank you so much for taking a moment here and you may want to stay for our

03:37:09.520 --> 03:37:15.760
next item which is we're reopening number one item one we begin with a tribute to karen staff

03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:22.000
walters we've already begun tributing karen but we're going to continue in a more formal way

03:37:22.560 --> 03:37:28.320
she has served as executive director of the state board special advisor to the governor for the last

03:37:28.320 --> 03:37:37.440
seven and a half years and then after that we'll take action on our draft 2020 and july 2020

03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:44.400
meeting minutes and our liaison assignments so i would like to start us off by noting some of

03:37:44.400 --> 03:37:51.040
karen's amazing abilities i know that many of you are aware of her high level of competence

03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:57.840
her unyielding perseverance her quiet determination that have produced so much important education

03:37:57.840 --> 03:38:05.680
policy on behalf of the children of california but did you know that karen can keep 22 plates

03:38:05.680 --> 03:38:11.680
twirling on 22 sticks without any of them ever falling off and she can do that while she's

03:38:11.680 --> 03:38:16.640
walking a tightrope over the heads of the lion tamers the flame throwers and the elephant riders

03:38:16.640 --> 03:38:23.040
below as they are drafting bills lobbying for and against and sometimes crashing loudly into each

03:38:23.040 --> 03:38:29.520
other she does all of this without a net below her and as far as i can tell without engaging in

03:38:29.520 --> 03:38:35.360
common mortal activities such as sleep as our daily phone calls and emails that start early

03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:41.520
in the morning and go into the evening seven days a week reveal you will always see that she does

03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:47.040
this with a smile on her face and with a long list in her hand and as you talk to her she's always

03:38:47.040 --> 03:38:53.040
adding to that list and the only person i know who actually manages to get through and cross off

03:38:53.600 --> 03:38:59.520
everything on her list i'm not sure how she does that i can go on at length but i know that many

03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:04.960
people want to speak and i'll only note a few of her most notable accomplishments over the last

03:39:04.960 --> 03:39:11.360
seven and a half years among along with key members of the state board she has helped to

03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:17.440
implement the local control funding formula overseeing the establishment of new state standards

03:39:17.440 --> 03:39:22.720
curriculum frameworks and instructional materials estate resources for strengthening instruction

03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:28.080
and maximizing student learning and those are standards and frameworks of which i know we are

03:39:28.080 --> 03:39:33.520
very very proud she's provided leadership in getting legislation passed over all the system

03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:38.640
of assessments not only for the content areas of english language arts math and science

03:39:38.640 --> 03:39:44.400
but also for supporting english learners all in support of teaching and learning guided the

03:39:44.400 --> 03:39:49.840
development of the california school dashboard and the local control and accountability plan template

03:39:49.840 --> 03:39:54.640
and helped shape the development of california's statewide system of support partnering with the

03:39:54.640 --> 03:40:01.120
county offices of education of the cce and the california department of education and as someone

03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:08.880
said earlier this morning she has been a wonderful collaborator with the cde which is our key partner

03:40:09.600 --> 03:40:16.800
and with whom all of these things need to be done jointly and as she transitions to her new role

03:40:16.800 --> 03:40:22.800
as executive director of the california county superintendent's educational services association

03:40:22.800 --> 03:40:29.760
we want to extend to her our heartfelt thanks for her tireless commitment her wisdom her sense of

03:40:29.760 --> 03:40:36.560
humor that has made this journey in improving the conditions of public education all the more

03:40:36.560 --> 03:40:43.360
pleasant as well as effective karen we have been trying to sneak around you but it's not that easy

03:40:44.160 --> 03:40:50.640
so you probably know most of what's about to happen but we have a group card which we have

03:40:50.640 --> 03:40:56.800
signed for you and many current and past state board members some of our colleagues in the

03:40:56.800 --> 03:41:05.920
governor's office and elsewhere and i think that patricia dicas who was the guru of the card

03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:13.760
development is showing that on her screen right now and patricia did you want to say anything

03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:19.280
at this point i'm not hearing patricia

03:41:19.440 --> 03:41:25.840
so maybe we're just seeing the card at this moment but you will see many many many many

03:41:27.120 --> 03:41:33.840
tributes inside of it i would like to invite eileen strouse to say a few words

03:41:34.880 --> 03:41:40.720
and then we'll give everyone a chance who wants to add on after state superintendent also speaks

03:41:40.720 --> 03:41:48.320
after state superintendent also speaks so so i have to i have to say um you know i've been on

03:41:48.320 --> 03:41:54.080
the board for a long time and when i first came on the board we didn't have an executive director

03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:59.600
and then sue was executive director and then sue stepped down to join us as colleagues on the board

03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:08.400
and karen came on and i have to say she's been a model for as a leader and someone who can

03:42:08.400 --> 03:42:14.160
collaborate and stay calm no matter what's happening and i think linda made a long list

03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:20.880
of the things that we accomplished but just the calmness the effectiveness she'll call you back

03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:27.680
she'll explain something she'll say no that's not your role or yes that's what the board does she

03:42:27.680 --> 03:42:32.560
had a real strategic approach to things i have to say i love sitting down in karen's office to

03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:40.320
visit with her and also to eat her peanut butter cups which are deadly for me but wonderful

03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:48.080
just strategic the relationships i just feel so lucky that we got to work for with karen

03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:53.120
and i think she sets a great model going forward for how to collaborate with all the separate

03:42:53.120 --> 03:42:57.040
board members and divisions and pieces that it takes to move things forward

03:42:58.000 --> 03:43:04.240
and i just think from the days where we were drawing on a whiteboard the effective indicators

03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:09.040
for accountability and the first dashboard was a spreadsheet you might remember that and

03:43:09.600 --> 03:43:15.120
and now what it looks like i think we can be so proud of where we are and we have a clear roadmap

03:43:15.120 --> 03:43:20.400
of where we're going and it's to karen's leadership so i just have to say karen we look forward to

03:43:20.400 --> 03:43:25.120
collaborating with you in your new role i think you can really help too in the work with the system

03:43:25.120 --> 03:43:30.960
of support in the counties and i feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to spend so much time

03:43:30.960 --> 03:43:36.960
working with you on important work for the students of california thanks that's great and

03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:42.480
let's invite state superintendent thurmond to say a few words

03:43:46.240 --> 03:43:52.160
madam president thank you welcome back to the state board brooks looking forward to working with

03:43:52.160 --> 03:43:58.560
you i think that president darling hammon's comments really captured so many great

03:43:58.560 --> 03:44:05.600
accomplishments that karen has helped to to bring into to fruition i would i would add just one

03:44:06.400 --> 03:44:13.840
and that is a piece of legislation that she worked on to help districts that find themselves

03:44:14.560 --> 03:44:20.480
facing receivership to get support in a way where they don't have to pay it back meaning

03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:26.640
districts that are already in financial stress you know happen to pay back loans only adds to

03:44:26.640 --> 03:44:33.520
their distress and karen worked on a very important policy that helps districts in this way as someone

03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:38.160
who came from one of those districts a district that was in receivership for 20 years before it

03:44:38.160 --> 03:44:45.760
could pay off all of its debt yeah i really appreciate that i also appreciate what president

03:44:45.760 --> 03:44:53.280
darling hammon said about karen's sense of humor it kind of sneaks up on you you know i think that

03:44:53.280 --> 03:44:58.640
i think that karen you're an example of i think of you as a quiet leader but an effective leader

03:44:58.640 --> 03:45:01.920
and it tells me that you don't have to be yelling and screaming to get things done

03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:08.000
you know that quiet leadership should not be mistaken for not being a strong leader you are

03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:14.560
a strong leader and a strong leader knows when to use you know a laughter or a quiet voice and also

03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:19.200
knows how to get their message across regardless of what the speed or the cadence is of what's

03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:24.480
happening in the room and i've appreciated that sense of humor because let's face it we we live

03:45:24.480 --> 03:45:29.600
in times that would just bring you to tears and bring you to your knees and the ability to have

03:45:29.600 --> 03:45:36.160
some levity in those moments is greatly appreciated and i'm sure it will serve you well you went from

03:45:36.160 --> 03:45:42.320
having to report to a board now you have to report the 58 county superintendents and so i would

03:45:42.320 --> 03:45:49.600
encourage you to continue to use that sense of humor but but i'll just say again i'm grateful

03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:53.600
for the time we've had to work together and looking forward to working with you in your next

03:45:54.160 --> 03:45:57.840
in your next capacity and obviously we're available to you in any way that we can be

03:45:57.840 --> 03:46:07.200
helpful so congratulations and thank you for your service all right i'm guessing that su

03:46:08.000 --> 03:46:14.080
burr you would like to kick off the rest of the comments i would love to thank you so much

03:46:15.680 --> 03:46:20.640
you know i've had the distinct pleasure of knowing karen i won't tell how many years because it might

03:46:20.640 --> 03:46:28.800
age both of us and worked with her in a variety of roles when i got ready to retire governor

03:46:28.800 --> 03:46:35.520
brown said to me you can only go if you find your replacement and so i went oh i know the first

03:46:35.520 --> 03:46:42.560
person top of my list and that was karen and i certainly know that none of us are that we're

03:46:42.560 --> 03:46:48.560
all grateful that we had the opportunity to bring karen into work on the board i will say just kind

03:46:48.560 --> 03:46:55.280
of building on what superintendent thurman said that one of my greatest mentor was gary hart who

03:46:55.280 --> 03:47:01.120
was a longtime senate chair of the senate education committee and the trait he valued most in people

03:47:01.200 --> 03:47:06.960
was their ability to listen and i at the time that he shared that with me i probably didn't

03:47:06.960 --> 03:47:11.520
think about it as carefully as i should have but over the years i certainly have and that's one

03:47:11.520 --> 03:47:18.000
of karen's number one traits and characteristics that i think makes her that very effective quiet

03:47:18.000 --> 03:47:26.080
leader that superintendent thurman just described so i'm just thrilled karen for your next challenge

03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:32.800
you're sort of following me around all the time just kidding i know it will be a great

03:47:33.760 --> 03:47:39.600
you'll enjoy the experience and they will certainly value having you in that role and all of us on the

03:47:39.600 --> 03:47:45.120
state board will value having you in that role because the county superintendents are such key

03:47:45.120 --> 03:47:51.040
partners in all that we do along with the department of education so i will certainly miss you greatly

03:47:51.040 --> 03:47:58.000
in this role you know i'm always just a phone call away and look forward to working with you

03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:04.240
in your new endeavor thank you awesome are there others who would like to say a word

03:48:07.600 --> 03:48:12.160
i guess i'm not looking at the hand raising i should be patricia and matt

03:48:13.520 --> 03:48:18.720
patricia well first of all i'm grateful that i'm making this comment and my camera is still

03:48:18.720 --> 03:48:25.680
working so that karen can see me as i'm speaking karen like sue i have i although i have not known

03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:33.760
you as long as sue i have i first met you when i stepped out of my classroom and began working

03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:39.840
with the california teachers association at the time you were working as a legislative advocate

03:48:39.840 --> 03:48:45.040
at at axa i was always impressed with your preparation and the background and research

03:48:45.040 --> 03:48:50.720
you did but more so i was impressed as as all the education lobbyists worked together and met

03:48:50.720 --> 03:48:57.280
together and did our collaboration particularly with no child left behind it was just wonderful

03:48:57.280 --> 03:49:03.760
to figure out ways that we could find consonance and agreement and i was just so impressed with

03:49:03.760 --> 03:49:08.000
the ways that you were always reaching out and seeking ways that there could be some common

03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:14.640
agreement but more importantly i was impressed by your grace your sense of style and the way that

03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:21.680
you approach not only relationships but work but just doing things to do the work together and

03:49:21.680 --> 03:49:28.080
to encourage all of us to be together so while everybody is lauding and praising what you do and

03:49:28.080 --> 03:49:33.520
expressing great expectations about what you'll be doing next i want to take this opportunity

03:49:33.520 --> 03:49:41.920
to offer you some words of advice as you sit as you step away from the board this has been a very

03:49:41.920 --> 03:49:50.640
high profile high fidelity high intensity and high energy activity and step over to work with

03:49:50.640 --> 03:49:56.640
the county superintendents this is an opportunity to do the thing that i always hear superintendent

03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:03.520
thurman say lean in one of the most important things that i've already heard sue say is that

03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:08.000
the county superintendents are an important partner for us and the work we're doing as we

03:50:08.000 --> 03:50:14.160
move forward where you're leaving us at a very important inflection point because we're turning

03:50:14.160 --> 03:50:20.160
a new phase and looking at a new stage in the implementation of the accountability system as

03:50:20.160 --> 03:50:26.480
well as the blossoming of the system of support and so this is the inflection point where as an

03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:33.040
entity and as a group of stakeholders we need the county superintendent to lean in and that's

03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:39.120
something that prodding and leading and guiding is something you've been very good at and something

03:50:39.120 --> 03:50:44.560
that you have been very careful with so i encourage you to engage that the county

03:50:44.560 --> 03:50:51.200
superintendents to lean in to look at not only how to use their authority but also how to use

03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:56.960
their platform their bully pulpit and their position in the relationships they have with

03:50:56.960 --> 03:51:02.960
all the schools across the state to move this agenda and to move this process to the next

03:51:02.960 --> 03:51:08.800
level because we really will rely on them to do that and to take the reins to blossom and build

03:51:08.800 --> 03:51:14.960
out the system of support my second piece of advice is to remember who your friends are

03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:22.880
every so often even though linda has already told you she plans to call you ever so often uh

03:51:22.880 --> 03:51:27.920
call up some folks just to have a cup of coffee that's something we don't know right now in this

03:51:27.920 --> 03:51:32.880
environment we don't have time to do that and we're not allowed to but probably the thing i

03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:38.720
appreciated most about you when i first met you at axa is that's the thing you did all the time

03:51:38.720 --> 03:51:45.040
we met we worked it out over a cup of coffee we worked it out over lunch so take the time to call

03:51:45.040 --> 03:51:52.720
up folks and just take and go out for a cup of coffee and finally and probably most importantly

03:51:52.720 --> 03:51:59.760
have fun because if you're not having fun it's just work so i will miss you and i appreciate you

03:51:59.760 --> 03:52:08.240
and i've already told you privately i don't have the words or the the the perlative adjectives

03:52:08.240 --> 03:52:15.760
to describe how much i honor admire and respect you but you will be missed and i'm just so glad

03:52:15.760 --> 03:52:21.120
i'm going to be able to find an excuse when i go to work at cpa to call you as well so thank you

03:52:21.120 --> 03:52:27.520
very much and i'm just so happy to know you and so happy to see you taking on this next important

03:52:27.520 --> 03:52:34.080
role awesome matt did you want to say a couple things sure i imagine this is very difficult

03:52:34.080 --> 03:52:38.960
for karen she's so incredibly humble so i'll be brief karen but i just in the short time that

03:52:38.960 --> 03:52:45.600
i've had to get to know you your optimism your positivity your courage your integrity and most

03:52:45.600 --> 03:52:50.480
importantly your character is one i respect and admire and i wish you well in your new venture

03:52:50.480 --> 03:52:54.560
and i know that the system of support and the kids of california will benefit from your

03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:59.520
contribution there as well as your contribution you're leaving here and brooks welcome welcome

03:52:59.520 --> 03:53:05.600
aboard it's our paths keep crossing so i'm sure you're going to do wonderful and zade wants to

03:53:05.600 --> 03:53:12.880
say a word and then ting i'm a staff walters i just wanted to say that your work on the lcff

03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:18.880
and the l cap truly opened the door to welcoming student voices to the decision making process in

03:53:18.880 --> 03:53:23.520
school districts and it truly started the next generation of student leaders in the california

03:53:23.520 --> 03:53:27.520
education system and i know personally that i don't think i would be in the position that i

03:53:27.520 --> 03:53:32.880
am in today if it wasn't for you really looking out for the state of california and for its students

03:53:32.880 --> 03:53:36.720
and so for that i'm really thankful for your service and you've clearly touched the hearts

03:53:36.720 --> 03:53:41.680
of all the members here on our board and although i wish i could have had the opportunity to work

03:53:41.680 --> 03:53:49.280

perspective than many of you and working with karen because i was new to cde when i first met

03:57:49.840 --> 03:57:55.680
karen coming straight from a district and who knew that curriculum instruction could be such a

03:57:56.640 --> 03:58:06.240
highly engaging topic for something and so i just want to say how much i appreciated karen

03:58:06.240 --> 03:58:14.960
and being the person that i could learn from when i first started at cde being a mentor as a woman

03:58:14.960 --> 03:58:24.720
in leadership and just how real you are and how kind you are on top of being so real because

03:58:24.720 --> 03:58:30.160
sometimes being real means that you are telling a truth that's hard to hear but you always did it

03:58:30.160 --> 03:58:36.880
with such kindness and so i am truly grateful that you are a role model for many of us

03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:43.040
in leadership positions and grateful that i got to learn from you during these highly engaging

03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:48.800
times so i just want to say that i really appreciate that i'll get to continue to get

03:58:48.800 --> 03:58:54.160
to work with you in your new role with cecessa and continue to learn from you thank you very much

03:58:55.120 --> 03:59:01.680

04:06:03.760 --> 04:06:10.320
the state board in what i have to imagine is probably one of the largest and most expansive

04:06:10.320 --> 04:06:15.840
periods of change um for for california's educational system with lcff with all the

04:06:15.840 --> 04:06:24.480
accountability work um and to have overseen such an incredible body of work um and to have been at

04:06:24.480 --> 04:06:31.600
the helm in the midst of some exciting high points but also controversies um what has also

04:06:31.600 --> 04:06:38.880
been really apparent is just watching how forthright and fair um and an incredibly expert

04:06:39.680 --> 04:06:46.000
person you have been and guide for all of us state board members so i am so grateful for your

04:06:46.000 --> 04:06:54.080
calmness in the midst of storms um for long hours incredible leadership and for setting the bar high

04:06:54.080 --> 04:07:02.000
for all of us to continue this work um and i i just i can see brooks alan there and welcome

04:07:02.000 --> 04:07:09.440
and very excited to be working with you as well terrific okay karen this is the part you've been

04:07:09.440 --> 04:07:20.000
writing the center of attention which is not your usual oh but we so appreciate you yes well thank

04:07:20.000 --> 04:07:27.760
you you've all been very kind and very generous and so i really didn't focus on this at all that

04:07:27.760 --> 04:07:32.560
you were going to do anything until i got the script some of you know we do a script for linda

04:07:32.560 --> 04:07:38.480
that lays out the process especially now in this remote environment because there's more pieces of

04:07:38.480 --> 04:07:44.800
the process and so i was reading it on tuesday night and patricia had sent it to several of us

04:07:44.800 --> 04:07:49.920
on staff and i get to this part this is tribute to karen so i called judy sias and i said okay

04:07:50.000 --> 04:07:56.080
what is that about and i think if i had real if i had focused on this earlier i'd seen the script

04:07:56.080 --> 04:08:01.520
earlier and i think maybe they didn't send it to me earlier intentionally i could have amended this

04:08:01.520 --> 04:08:07.760
little section but anyway so i took a deep breath so okay i'm gonna go on so i said to judy does

04:08:07.760 --> 04:08:12.080
this mean i have to say something and she said yeah you better you better get it together so um

04:08:12.960 --> 04:08:19.040
anyway i took her advice and i wrote it down because i thought otherwise i won't get it together

04:08:19.040 --> 04:08:22.320
so anyway you've all been very kind and very generous i really appreciate it the balloons

04:08:22.320 --> 04:08:28.160
are lovely the plant is lovely thank you all very much it truly has been amazing seven and a half

04:08:28.160 --> 04:08:33.920
years it's we've really accomplished a lot and many of you linda you included have outlined much

04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:39.520
of what we've done it's really been quite amazing but one of the reasons that we've been so successful

04:08:39.520 --> 04:08:44.880
is because of the board that we've been able to work with both governors brown and newsome

04:08:44.880 --> 04:08:50.240
have selected amazing folks as witnessed today by everything we've worked on today together

04:08:50.880 --> 04:08:57.280
to serve in california and this it's a hard board some boards are easy this one isn't a lot of work

04:08:57.280 --> 04:09:02.720
on this board i feel very fortunate to have worked with such an esteemed group now and in the past

04:09:03.440 --> 04:09:07.680
because as eileen and sue and some of the other folks have been on board patricia rucker for a

04:09:07.680 --> 04:09:13.920
long time now we've had some very good folks go through this board it's been a special privilege

04:09:13.920 --> 04:09:19.760
to serve under the leadership of linda and my curse before before her i can't imagine

04:09:19.760 --> 04:09:23.760
having done this job without their incredible leadership and partnership i feel like that's

04:09:23.760 --> 04:09:35.280
been a special gift i knew this was going to be hard

04:09:35.280 --> 04:09:45.760
i'm all right i'll take a deep breath here i'm very aware too that we've done what we've done

04:09:45.760 --> 04:09:53.920
together wouldn't be possible without the collaboration of the superintendent and his

04:09:53.920 --> 04:10:00.000
staff in fact we wouldn't have a board agenda without the department i want to thank tony and

04:10:00.080 --> 04:10:05.920
stephanie and the staff of the department for their work with us in years past tom tollex and

04:10:05.920 --> 04:10:12.160
glenn price michelle zoom and rich ziger goes back a ways and their leadership teams were

04:10:12.160 --> 04:10:21.680
critical partners as well thanks for working so closely with the board this is the hard part

04:10:22.880 --> 04:10:28.960
as i said to linda i will get this together transitions are hard because of the people that

04:10:28.960 --> 04:10:35.200
leave so i especially want to thank the state board staff past and present wouldn't have been

04:10:35.200 --> 04:10:40.640
as successful as we've been accomplished as much as we did or enjoyed the work as much as we have

04:10:40.640 --> 04:10:46.400
if it weren't for a strong team many of them are in the room today so thank you i thank you for

04:10:46.400 --> 04:10:52.480
taking and responding to my evening and weekend calls text messages and emails when i just had to

04:10:52.480 --> 04:10:56.480
know an answer to a burning question of course at that moment it was most important i'm sure

04:10:57.200 --> 04:11:02.560
the work can be hard but it's also incredibly rewarding i wouldn't have done this job as long

04:11:02.560 --> 04:11:08.480
as i have if it wasn't thank you for your support your professionalism and especially for the last

04:11:08.480 --> 04:11:14.960
we shared you're a great team i'm also thrilled that brooks will succeed me in this position

04:11:14.960 --> 04:11:19.120

specifically asked to share some information about the work we're doing to provide support online

04:20:18.960 --> 04:20:24.080
for students and on how we're accounting and making contact and reaching out to students

04:20:24.880 --> 04:20:29.840
as part of our distance learning activity so that is information i'll be reporting and sharing out

04:20:29.840 --> 04:20:34.720
from the content that's already been provided in such detail and so ably from our state

04:20:34.720 --> 04:20:40.240

04:20:40.240 --> 04:20:46.240
back to you on the work in progress going on from that work group meeting at our november

04:20:46.240 --> 04:20:53.680
stay for me terrific thank you member rodriguez yes hello thank you

04:20:55.600 --> 04:21:01.200
so first of all i want to acknowledge members strouse's tremendous work as a liaison with the

04:21:01.200 --> 04:21:07.600
ctc and i'm sure that you were missed and they were surprised to see me although it was you know

04:21:07.600 --> 04:21:15.600
good to be back there and you know the my report is mainly about the continuation of the work

04:21:15.600 --> 04:21:24.560
actually that was started when president darlene hammond you know back when when the

04:21:25.120 --> 04:21:33.200
special education task force in 2015 issued a report and we're coming around the ctc adopted

04:21:33.200 --> 04:21:39.600
the new structure for the preliminary education specialist teaching credential and it'll take

04:21:39.600 --> 04:21:48.000
effect summer fall 2022 the credential structure is designed to support the vision of one system

04:21:48.000 --> 04:21:57.440
for all right which was work that was started a while back for informed by the special education

04:21:57.440 --> 04:22:06.000
task force and while there were seven credentials at one point these have been these are five new

04:22:06.000 --> 04:22:14.320
credential areas early childhood special education visual impairments deaf and hard of hearing mild

04:22:14.320 --> 04:22:22.720
to moderate support needs and extensive support needs and ctc wants to work with the teachers who

04:22:22.720 --> 04:22:30.640
are currently already credential and ways to look for the to add the authorizations which would be

04:22:30.640 --> 04:22:36.560
either through coursework professional development or prior knowledge demonstrated competence

04:22:38.800 --> 04:22:43.440
additionally the universal teaching performance expectation the tb

04:22:45.200 --> 04:22:49.520
has established a common foundation for all teachers based on the concept that

04:22:49.520 --> 04:22:57.040
teachers are teachers of all students all students are general education students first

04:22:57.040 --> 04:23:01.280
and that all students need intervention at different points in their academic career

04:23:03.200 --> 04:23:09.280
and so the design team for the education specialist cal tpa has come to consensus

04:23:09.280 --> 04:23:15.520
that the education specialist cal tpa will align with key qualities of the general education cal

04:23:15.520 --> 04:23:21.440
tpa a task-based structure that is completed at two different times during a candidate's

04:23:21.440 --> 04:23:29.760
preliminary preparation program and there was a discussion on the issues with virtual teaching

04:23:31.120 --> 04:23:39.360
and three points came up the clinical practice right and the 2021 continues to be 600 hours for

04:23:39.360 --> 04:23:44.800
teachers but the focus should be on ensuring that candidates have sufficient experiences

04:23:44.880 --> 04:23:52.560
to develop their teaching practices this is for beginning teachers who are you know getting their

04:23:52.560 --> 04:23:56.720
teaching credential and then the teacher and administrator induction

04:23:58.480 --> 04:24:04.400
was discussed how to focus the induction make sure that it's individualized for each candidate

04:24:04.400 --> 04:24:13.600
and then the child development permit the members gave input on how the ctc can best support them

04:24:15.440 --> 04:24:23.360
let's see here there there's a work group the that's updating the california standards for

04:24:23.360 --> 04:24:30.720
the teaching profession and that is continual and that will they will meet again september november

04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:36.960
for the next steps it was a very robust and rich meeting took two days but i'm trying to condense

04:24:36.960 --> 04:24:43.760
this for the sake of time and then there was also a wonderful presentation on micro credentials

04:24:43.760 --> 04:24:51.440
and micro credentials is a competence-based system that for teachers who are already in the

04:24:51.440 --> 04:24:59.440
classroom something that can be done at as a classroom teacher at our own pace and it's a

04:24:59.440 --> 04:25:06.080
wonderful way to push the profession forward based on the the needs of our students right so

04:25:06.640 --> 04:25:11.680
the credentials would be something that's added on to our our current teaching credential but

04:25:11.680 --> 04:25:18.480
with a specialty and one of the wonderful things about the micro credentials is that it's innovative

04:25:18.480 --> 04:25:25.440
and it's competency-based therefore as we are rethinking what our students need

04:25:26.640 --> 04:25:33.440
this is an innovative way to get us to understand the needs of our students as well

04:25:34.080 --> 04:25:40.480
so that's my report thank you terrific thank you member petia brunson

04:25:46.560 --> 04:25:52.960
um hi i wanted to share an update on the california statewide early math initiative

04:25:52.960 --> 04:26:00.160
and the 2020 institute which was held on august the third and there were educators from all around

04:26:00.160 --> 04:26:06.320
the state and from county offices of ed who were sharing in a number of poster sessions and also

04:26:07.600 --> 04:26:17.040
larger format conversations about strategies that they are seeing make changes in how educators both

04:26:18.080 --> 04:26:25.440
understand the teaching of math but also feel confidence and have strategies to apply everyday

04:26:25.440 --> 04:26:33.040
math and integrate it with ele integrate it into the ongoing coursework with children with

04:26:33.040 --> 04:26:39.920
disabilities and also making sure that english language learners are brought into this work as

04:26:39.920 --> 04:26:47.280
well it was an incredible cross-section of folks from kern modic riverside humble chasta

04:26:47.920 --> 04:26:55.360
um president i will not read the full list um but i i think the common thread um is really that

04:26:55.360 --> 04:27:04.800
it is about how how do we support teachers um to grow not just the mechanical skills of addition

04:27:04.800 --> 04:27:10.240
and counting in the early years but math mindsets um some of the literature i think that we were

04:27:10.240 --> 04:27:16.880
looking um at was also um looking at in an international context the idea for example that

04:27:16.880 --> 04:27:25.520
um that any group of people might be considered um good or bad at math um is is a something that

04:27:25.520 --> 04:27:31.920
doesn't exist in other countries um and also is not considered optional that you could for example

04:27:31.920 --> 04:27:37.200
as a fifth grade girl decide to opt out and not be good at math is not really something that's on

04:27:37.200 --> 04:27:44.000
the table in lots of other countries and something that we should um invite in california as well um

04:27:44.800 --> 04:27:50.080
i i think we are behind on the agenda so i'll just stop there and um was really just glad to

04:27:50.640 --> 04:27:54.240
offer support for the state board um for work that is continuing

04:27:55.520 --> 04:28:02.880
perfect member novel sure there's a lot going on with cce i'll pull out uh just two highlights

04:28:03.760 --> 04:28:09.600
the cc continues to work in collaboration with the cd county office and state board staff

04:28:09.600 --> 04:28:13.360
to support and be responsive to lea's and california system of support

04:28:13.360 --> 04:28:19.440
in regards to coven 19 pandemic at the august 6th board meeting we affirmed three goals

04:28:20.080 --> 04:28:25.120
goal one was direct technical assistance to support lea's and who are receiving direct

04:28:25.120 --> 04:28:28.960
technical assistance to address the issues and needs that they have for their students

04:28:28.960 --> 04:28:33.520
goal two was professional learning identifying expanding and developing professional learning

04:28:33.520 --> 04:28:38.320
resources focused on priority topics and goal three was a system of support which is the

04:28:38.320 --> 04:28:43.920
facilitation and development of implementation structures relationships and processes to support

04:28:43.920 --> 04:28:52.720
lea's we also have several rfps out right now two of the rfps one of which is data analysis

04:28:52.720 --> 04:28:58.800

04:30:05.840 --> 04:30:12.240

students to apply and i kind of introduced myself in my experience and that article was sent out

04:30:23.040 --> 04:30:28.640
in a mailing list to 1100 students across the state and then i've been working with just some

04:30:28.640 --> 04:30:33.360
student organizations such as gen up to i guess get the position advertised through their social

04:30:33.360 --> 04:30:39.280

04:31:22.080 --> 04:31:31.600
effort has gone to managing this transition from karen to brooks and helping us get to a master

04:31:31.600 --> 04:31:38.560
plan for early childhood education that will be released shortly there is a wonderful team of

04:31:39.520 --> 04:31:46.080
analysts working from wested the rand corporation and a variety of other organizations in the

04:31:46.080 --> 04:31:55.280
consortium to help us launch by october a master plan for early childhood which will look ahead a

04:31:55.280 --> 04:32:01.680
number of years to where we want to be at the point where there is a more predictable budget

04:32:01.680 --> 04:32:08.000
in place than what we're experiencing this year but we'll also figure out some of the starting

04:32:08.000 --> 04:32:15.920
places towards that goal that can be put in place sooner than later and get us moving in a

04:32:15.920 --> 04:32:22.880
useful direction so we'll have a lot more to say about that soon kim also serves as a liaison to

04:32:22.880 --> 04:32:27.600

for questions sorry

04:36:06.400 --> 04:36:11.040
first we'll provide the update on the california assessment of student performance and progress or

04:36:11.040 --> 04:36:19.760
casp this slide provides an overview of the assessments within casp and under the general

04:36:19.760 --> 04:36:26.160
assessment column we have the smarter balanced english language arts um literacy literacy or

04:36:26.160 --> 04:36:33.680
ela and mathematics and about 3.2 million students in grades three through eight and 11 take these

04:36:33.680 --> 04:36:39.280
assessments then for students with significant cognitive disabilities whose individualized

04:36:39.280 --> 04:36:45.920
education plans or iep specify that they take an alternate assessment are eligible to take the

04:36:46.000 --> 04:36:54.400
california alternate assessments or caas for ele and mathematics which last year about 49 000

04:36:54.400 --> 04:37:01.760
students are eligible or were eligible to take them in grades three through eight and 11 next

04:37:01.760 --> 04:37:08.160
we have the cast or the california science test for about 1 million students in grades five and

04:37:08.720 --> 04:37:17.200
about 500 000 students that that take it once in 10th 11th or 12th grade in high school

04:37:18.320 --> 04:37:24.400
now the california alternate assessment or caa for science is the alternate assessment

04:37:24.400 --> 04:37:29.200
for students with the significant cognitive disabilities whose iep specify that they take

04:37:29.200 --> 04:37:36.480
an alternate assessment and last year about 21 000 students were eligible to take the caa for science

04:37:36.480 --> 04:37:43.520
in grades five eight and once in high school then we have the csa or the california spanish

04:37:43.520 --> 04:37:50.640
assessment in spanish reading language arts and last year there were about 33 500 students in

04:37:50.640 --> 04:37:56.480
grades three through eight and about excuse me 5 500 students in high school who were registered

04:37:56.480 --> 04:38:03.600
to take the csa so some students such as those who are in bilingual education or spanish or dual

04:38:03.600 --> 04:38:10.240
immersion programs take this and they also take the smarter balance test also take this

04:38:10.240 --> 04:38:15.840
csa so overall some students can take up to four assessments depending on the grade level

04:38:16.400 --> 04:38:22.240
so with the exception of the caa for science the statewide testing window this year for all the

04:38:22.320 --> 04:38:31.520
other casp assessments will begin on january 12 2021 and end on july 15 2021

04:38:35.520 --> 04:38:41.680
so a large part of the casp is the smarter balance assessment system california did

04:38:41.680 --> 04:38:47.520
join the smarter balance assessment consortium in june 2011 as a governing state and we have

04:38:47.520 --> 04:38:52.800
worked with the member the other members in the consortium on development of the english language

04:38:52.800 --> 04:38:58.720
arts literacy and mathematics assessments which measure the common core state standards

04:38:58.720 --> 04:39:05.440
and were adopted by our california state board of education so the three components of the smarter

04:39:05.440 --> 04:39:11.200
balance assessment system which are the summative assessments the interim assessments and tools

04:39:11.200 --> 04:39:16.880
for teachers are designed to support teaching and learning throughout the year the smarter

04:39:16.880 --> 04:39:22.320
balance summative assessments for english language arts and mathematics serve as california's end of

04:39:22.320 --> 04:39:28.720
year assessments for these two content areas the smarter balance interims for for english language

04:39:28.720 --> 04:39:35.120
arts and math which can be used as strategic times throughout the school year and tools for teachers

04:39:35.120 --> 04:39:41.360
which is a great new resource of formative assessment tools and strategies that can be

04:39:41.360 --> 04:39:46.320
used to support daily instruction so we'll go into more detail on the interim assessments

04:39:46.320 --> 04:39:52.880
and the tools for teachers shortly so first let's look at the overview and overview of the

04:39:52.880 --> 04:39:59.520
interim assessments there are three types the focus interim assessment blocks the interim assessment

04:39:59.520 --> 04:40:07.200
blocks or you know your ibs and then the which assess let me back up a little bit the focus

04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:13.680
interim assessment blocks really assess about one to three targets the interim assessment blocks

04:40:14.320 --> 04:40:21.360
overall assesses about one to eight targets and then the interim comprehensive assessments or icas

04:40:22.240 --> 04:40:27.760
assess the same targets as the summative assessment so between the three types of interim

04:40:27.760 --> 04:40:35.280
assessments there are over 160 interim assessments to choose from about 75 for math and 90 for ela

04:40:36.000 --> 04:40:42.400
they were made available to local educational agencies on august 20th and will continue to be

04:40:42.400 --> 04:40:47.920
available for to support distance learning throughout the school year which means that

04:40:47.920 --> 04:40:54.400
the students or these interim assessments can be administered remotely to students on their devices

04:40:54.960 --> 04:40:58.640
and instructions to do so are on the casp.org website

04:41:01.440 --> 04:41:07.200
in addition a new tool called the interim assessment item portal was introduced also or

04:41:07.200 --> 04:41:14.800
made available in august 2020 through this new portal educators can search for view and print

04:41:14.800 --> 04:41:20.720
interim assessment items and the it really does allow users to search for interim assessment

04:41:20.720 --> 04:41:28.320
items by grade subject test name claim target and even content standard so this new tool

04:41:29.280 --> 04:41:34.240
can be accessed through the tools with teachers website which i will talk about next

04:41:34.960 --> 04:41:41.360
and as i came to you in july and shared a little bit about the tools for teachers

04:41:41.360 --> 04:41:47.360
it is really the formative assessment component that replaced the digital library and the smarter

04:41:47.360 --> 04:41:53.280
balance system and in it there are hundreds of instructional resources for kindergarten through

04:41:53.280 --> 04:41:58.720
grade 12 students they are aligned with the common core state standards for english language arts and

04:41:58.880 --> 04:42:06.240
math and all resources must adhere to a set of quality criteria for example every instructional

04:42:06.240 --> 04:42:12.640
resource is embedded with strategies to implement all components of the formative assessment process

04:42:13.600 --> 04:42:19.040
and has embedded accessibility strategies to ensure that the resources can be used meaningfully

04:42:19.040 --> 04:42:25.840
with all students and every source a resource also offers differentiation strategies for working with

04:42:26.720 --> 04:42:30.160
strategies for working with students with varying levels of need

04:42:31.920 --> 04:42:39.200
so really one of the key features is the interim connections playlist for the interim assessment

04:42:39.200 --> 04:42:44.640
blocks that i mentioned they provide a description of what students generally know and what

04:42:45.280 --> 04:42:52.480
i can do when they are below near or above expectation on that content area also we have

04:42:52.560 --> 04:43:00.000
um provide an academic vocabulary as part of that so that students are expect vocabulary that

04:43:00.000 --> 04:43:05.760
students are expected to know for that content which can be very helpful in planning instruction

04:43:05.760 --> 04:43:12.960
as well so furthermore there are professional learning resources such as videos and use case

04:43:12.960 --> 04:43:19.440
scenarios for how to use the interim assessments some other key features i just want to point out

04:43:19.440 --> 04:43:26.080
is now it's fully accessible and has a lot of publicly available content before you even need

04:43:26.080 --> 04:43:34.640
to log in so other people can look at the site even if they may not have work in a local educational

04:43:34.640 --> 04:43:41.920
agency that would have access and there are enhanced ways on the website for educators to

04:43:41.920 --> 04:43:47.440
share resources where they're called with their colleagues another benefit is that

04:43:48.320 --> 04:43:55.120
california has our own instance of the tools for teachers so we can add resources developed by

04:43:55.120 --> 04:44:01.440
california for other subject areas as i will explain later on how we will soon be able to

04:44:01.440 --> 04:44:08.480
offer science resources and there is a self registration available for staff who have

04:44:08.560 --> 04:44:13.600
and local educational specific work email address that they can self register

04:44:14.160 --> 04:44:20.480
or the majority of the people in the system are already registered through our test operations

04:44:20.480 --> 04:44:27.520
management system locally so a preview of the tools for teachers website have been available

04:44:27.520 --> 04:44:33.840
since june 16th and every digital account holder automatically received that tools for teachers

04:44:33.840 --> 04:44:40.160
account at that time so the official grant opening of tools for teachers just want to remind you will

04:44:40.160 --> 04:44:47.360
be on september 30th in conjunction with the 10 year anniversary for smarter balance and between

04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:54.320
now and then more features and content will be added as well so on that note let's transition

04:44:54.320 --> 04:45:02.800
to the california science tests updates as a reminder this is an online assessment as well

04:45:02.800 --> 04:45:09.840
many of our assessments are have all transitioned to online assessments and it's administered to

04:45:09.840 --> 04:45:16.480
eligible students in grades five eight and one time in high school our high school means high

04:45:16.480 --> 04:45:22.160
school for this test means grades 10 11 or 12 so to allow students the chance to become familiar

04:45:22.160 --> 04:45:28.000
with the cast we have training and practice tests available on the online practice and training test

04:45:28.080 --> 04:45:34.800
portal web page on the casp website students parents and guardians and educators can use

04:45:34.800 --> 04:45:40.240
the training tests to view the different item types and practice tests to view the depth and

04:45:40.240 --> 04:45:50.800
breadth of the cast content next i would like to provide you an update on the elementary school

04:45:50.800 --> 04:45:56.800
science instructional resources aligned with our california next generation science standards

04:45:57.760 --> 04:46:03.360
since i mentioned since california has its own instance of the tools for teachers we can add

04:46:03.360 --> 04:46:11.280
resources developed by our california educators for the other subjects beyond ele math so tools

04:46:11.280 --> 04:46:18.480
for teachers will soon have 38 assessment instructional resources for grades three

04:46:18.480 --> 04:46:25.760
okay through five in earth and space sciences life sciences physical sciences and engineering

04:46:25.760 --> 04:46:34.400
technology and applications of science so since april we've been developing those resources and

04:46:34.400 --> 04:46:42.320
they will have as they were being developed by educators they have these of this goal in

04:46:42.320 --> 04:46:48.480
mind is to embed the formative assessment and accessibility strategies that promote opportunities

04:46:48.480 --> 04:46:55.360
for three-dimensional learning and emphasize hands-on activities that facilitate peer feedback and

04:46:55.360 --> 04:47:02.240
collaboration and then integrate the common core state standards for ele and math into the

04:47:02.240 --> 04:47:09.600
resources so cd is planning to have some additional work with educators to develop additional

04:47:09.600 --> 04:47:18.640
resources throughout the school year as well onto the california alternate assessment for science

04:47:18.640 --> 04:47:28.320
updates this test is for uh is administer with the most significant students with the most

04:47:28.320 --> 04:47:34.640
significant cognitive disabilities again whose um individualized education plan indicates that

04:47:34.640 --> 04:47:41.200
they use an alternate assessment so test examiners administer four embedded performance tasks

04:47:42.160 --> 04:47:48.240
throughout the year two students one-on-one as close to the time of instruction for each

04:47:48.240 --> 04:47:56.000
performance task as possible so the first operational caa for science opened on september 8th

04:47:57.200 --> 04:48:02.880
and it will be available throughout the year we have updated the exam test examiner tutorial

04:48:02.880 --> 04:48:10.160
which can be found on the cde's california alternate assessment for science main webpage

04:48:10.800 --> 04:48:18.240
we have also updated the caa for science administration planning guides and version

04:48:18.240 --> 04:48:24.640
assignments and these links again can be found on the casp website and the caa main webpage

04:48:29.120 --> 04:48:35.840
so now let me take a few minutes and give you some updates on the california on the excuse me on the

04:48:35.840 --> 04:48:39.760
english language proficiency assessments for california or alpac

04:48:41.920 --> 04:48:47.520
so this slide provides an overview of the assessments under alpac under the general

04:48:47.520 --> 04:48:53.520
assessment column the initial alpac is administered to approximately 300 000

04:48:53.520 --> 04:48:59.600
newly enrolled students whose primary language is not english and it's based on the home language

04:48:59.600 --> 04:49:07.120
survey for students in kindergarten through grade 12 to identify students as english learners or

04:49:07.120 --> 04:49:13.200
initial fluent english proficient so the initial alpac testing window is from july 1

04:49:14.400 --> 04:49:22.800
2020 through june 30th 2021 so under the alternate assessment column is the initial alternate alpac

04:49:23.760 --> 04:49:30.640
i want to say that this is still under development it will be available starting in the 2021-22

04:49:30.640 --> 04:49:36.480
school year for assessing eligible newly enrolled students with significant cognitive disabilities

04:49:37.120 --> 04:49:43.440
whose primary language is not english again based on the home language survey in kindergarten through

04:49:43.440 --> 04:49:49.360
grade 12 so they can use it to identify whether they are english learners or initial fluent english

04:49:49.360 --> 04:49:58.960
proficient next we have the summative alpac which is given to about 1.5 million students in

04:49:58.960 --> 04:50:05.120
kindergarten through grade 12 who have been identified as english learners based on the

04:50:05.120 --> 04:50:11.200
results of the initial alpac and measures a student's progress toward english proficiency

04:50:11.760 --> 04:50:17.600
so the results support decisions or is used to make decisions for students to be redesignated

04:50:17.600 --> 04:50:24.720
as fluent english proficient the summative alpac testing window is from february 1st through may

04:50:24.720 --> 04:50:32.880
31st 2021 for the first time this year eligible english learners in kindergarten through grade 12

04:50:32.880 --> 04:50:39.120
with significant cognitive disabilities whose iep specified that they take an alternate assessment

04:50:39.120 --> 04:50:46.000
will be able to take a summative alternate alpac operational field test so up to this year we have

04:50:46.000 --> 04:50:49.840
not had a statewide alternate assessment for alpac at all

04:50:53.360 --> 04:50:59.440
next i'd like to share a few updates about the operational administration of the 2019-20

04:51:02.160 --> 04:51:09.600
summative alpac so due to the testing suspension last year many english learner students did not

04:51:09.600 --> 04:51:18.400
complete taking the 2019-2020 summative alpac and senate bill 98 approved by the governor on

04:51:18.400 --> 04:51:27.360
june 29th 2020 provided and it provided for an extension of the 2019-20 2020 summative alpac

04:51:28.080 --> 04:51:37.760
as an optional administration for reclassification purposes and the window has opened from it's being

04:51:37.760 --> 04:51:44.640
made available from august 20th through october 30th for english learners to complete their

04:51:44.640 --> 04:51:50.320
assessments so that the results can be used for reclassification so if the students were eligible

04:51:50.320 --> 04:51:55.840
on may 31st to take the summative they will remain eligible to take the optional summative

04:51:56.560 --> 04:52:02.320
alpac so the primary purpose is for reclassification of students who have already met

04:52:02.400 --> 04:52:09.120
the remaining criteria however lea's have the discretion to determine which students

04:52:09.120 --> 04:52:14.960
will most benefit from the administration so english learners who partially completed the

04:52:14.960 --> 04:52:21.920
summative alpac last spring will be able to complete any remaining domains this fall along

04:52:21.920 --> 04:52:26.160
with other students who were not able to begin testing at all last spring

04:52:26.720 --> 04:52:32.480
on may 31st a snapshot of the eligible english learner students was collected and these students

04:52:32.480 --> 04:52:39.280
are available in our test operations management system students who have moved will still be

04:52:39.280 --> 04:52:46.080
available in the toms system and coordinators can run their completion status reports to identify

04:52:46.080 --> 04:52:51.760
those students the only students who are not available or not eligible are the newly enrolled

04:52:51.760 --> 04:52:56.320
or not eligible are the newly enrolled students this year because they should be taking our

04:52:56.320 --> 04:53:03.280
initial alpac so lastly lea's will be provided with a cumulative file that includes results

04:53:03.280 --> 04:53:08.400
from the spring and the fall for the 2019-2020 summative administrations

04:53:11.440 --> 04:53:17.680
as a reminder the alternate alpac blueprints were approved last may at the state board of

04:53:17.680 --> 04:53:23.360
education meeting which allow for the continued development and preparations for the alternate

04:53:23.360 --> 04:53:32.080
alpac operational field tests scheduled for july no january excuse me through january 12th through

04:53:32.080 --> 04:53:40.160
february 16th 2021 so this field test is a census field test meaning that all eligible english

04:53:40.160 --> 04:53:45.040
learner students with the most significant cognitive disabilities will be required to

04:53:45.040 --> 04:53:51.840
participate and in preparation for this field test we have recommended to local educational agencies

04:53:51.840 --> 04:53:57.680
that they hold individual education program team meetings to discuss the students participation

04:53:57.680 --> 04:54:01.760
in the coming field test if they are eligible for alternate assessments

04:54:04.400 --> 04:54:10.400
so to assist local educational agencies parents guardians and students prepare for this field test

04:54:11.040 --> 04:54:16.880
training and practice tests are being developed and in fact the training tests are now available

04:54:16.880 --> 04:54:22.720
and the practice tests will be available in november so to prepare the test examiners for

04:54:22.720 --> 04:54:29.040
the upcoming field tests virtual administration and scoring training will be available in the

04:54:29.040 --> 04:54:34.960
moodle training site this november and we are very excited about the development of this new assessment

04:54:35.040 --> 04:54:40.640
as it will provide consistency throughout the state in how english language proficiency

04:54:40.640 --> 04:54:47.520
of our english learner students with the most significant cognitive disability is being measured

04:54:50.320 --> 04:54:57.120
now i will transition to provide a status on the physical fitness test which is given to

04:54:57.120 --> 04:54:59.600
students in grades five seven and nine

04:55:02.880 --> 04:55:09.440
contingent upon the approval upon the approval of the governor senate bill

04:55:10.240 --> 04:55:21.360
820 proposes to suspend the physical fitness test for the 20 21 2021 school year and require that

04:55:21.440 --> 04:55:26.240
the superintendent of public instruction consult with experts and other stakeholders

04:55:27.200 --> 04:55:31.200
and to provide recommendations on the purpose and administration of the tests

04:55:32.800 --> 04:55:39.120
to the appropriate fiscal and policy committees of the legislature the department of finance and

04:55:39.120 --> 04:55:47.840
the state board of education by november 1 2022 so more information will be provided when they

04:55:47.840 --> 04:55:55.360
become available so i will transition to share some key resources and highlight them for you

04:55:57.120 --> 04:56:02.080
one resource update is the california educator reporting system also known as

04:56:02.080 --> 04:56:08.480
sirs we love our acronyms which is the secure website that california

04:56:09.040 --> 04:56:15.360
local educational agency staff can use to access individual and aggregate student results from the

04:56:15.360 --> 04:56:21.280
smarter balance interim assessments as well as the results from all of our casp and alpac summative

04:56:21.280 --> 04:56:30.080
assessments so the historical results from summative assessments through 2018-19 school

04:56:30.080 --> 04:56:35.360
year are all available and they are available for the smarter balance ela and math assessments

04:56:36.080 --> 04:56:42.880
the california alternate assessments for ela and math the science test the california

04:56:42.880 --> 04:56:48.480
spanish assessment and the summative alpac so over the coming months our results from

04:56:48.480 --> 04:56:56.000
these 2019-20 assessments that are available will be added to sirs and starting in the spring of

04:56:56.000 --> 04:57:02.960
2021 regular feeds of the summative assessment results as they happen will start to occur

04:57:04.240 --> 04:57:08.480
weekly for alpac assessments and daily for casp assessments

04:57:09.440 --> 04:57:15.600
um again a quick little reminder about the availability of our sirs sandbox training tool

04:57:15.600 --> 04:57:23.600
which is which was released last year in july 2019 and it's still publicly available it is a

04:57:23.600 --> 04:57:30.000
useful tool to help staff become familiar with the features of sirs in a non-secure environment

04:57:30.800 --> 04:57:36.800
so this website has the same structure and features as sirs except all the data is mock data

04:57:36.800 --> 04:57:42.960
so in fact there is mock data for all of the assessments that sirs houses results for as i

04:57:42.960 --> 04:57:49.440
just mentioned in the previous slide and it is useful for individual and group learning opportunities

04:57:51.440 --> 04:57:57.760
another resource update is the smarter balance usability accessibility and accommodations

04:57:57.760 --> 04:58:05.760
accessibility and accommodations guidelines document smarter balance maintains and updates

04:58:05.760 --> 04:58:12.400
this guide this um the set of guidelines which includes all accessibility resources that are

04:58:12.400 --> 04:58:18.000
available for the english language arts and mathematics assessments and the same category

04:58:18.000 --> 04:58:23.680
structure is applied to non-smarter balance assessments for consistency purposes

04:58:24.080 --> 04:58:33.200
so smarter balance just concluded the most recent guide um guidelines document review cycle and the

04:58:33.200 --> 04:58:40.960
updated guidelines are um for the 2020-21 test administration year was published on june 30th

04:58:41.600 --> 04:58:48.720
and the link can be found in the item now just some other quick updates about what the updates

04:58:49.360 --> 04:58:58.880
what the updates are in the um guides in the guide um we have some we have added some um

04:58:58.880 --> 04:59:06.560
embedded expanded items added some non-embedded calculator clarification update on multiplication

04:59:06.560 --> 04:59:14.320
tables update on the hundreds number table and scratch paper clarification and also some text

04:59:14.320 --> 04:59:21.280
to speech clarification then we've also updated the frequently asked questions

04:59:21.280 --> 04:59:30.560
section and added embedded text to speech in spanish beginning in the 2021-22 school year

04:59:31.520 --> 04:59:35.920
which will provide one year for us to pilot a new resource

04:59:36.720 --> 04:59:46.160
and one more um new and exciting resource is um providing access to the lexile and quantile measures

04:59:47.120 --> 04:59:53.920
so these provide access to um research-based tools for educators families and students to learn how

04:59:54.720 --> 05:00:00.960
these measures can be used to advance student learning and growth and both in the classroom

05:00:01.520 --> 05:00:09.280
and at home so the resource links the assessment results from the smarter balance english language

05:00:09.280 --> 05:00:14.720
arts and mathematics with instruction so that teachers can target instruction to students

05:00:14.720 --> 05:00:21.600
abilities promote students growth and monitor their progress and effectively communicate student

05:00:21.600 --> 05:00:27.040
achievement and evaluate the effectiveness of instructional programs and interventions

05:00:27.040 --> 05:00:37.680
so there are three levels three access levels provided to provide the for each of the user groups

05:00:37.680 --> 05:00:44.480
so there is free guest access for students where they don't have to have an email address and no

05:00:44.480 --> 05:00:50.960
registration required then there's a free basic plus access for families where an email is required

05:00:50.960 --> 05:00:58.800
for registration and then free premium access for all california educators so the link to the hub

05:00:58.800 --> 05:01:09.520
is https hub.lexile.com the educator hub will be the first set of resources available for california

05:01:09.520 --> 05:01:16.080
educators parents and students and through our contractor educational testing service you will

05:01:16.960 --> 05:01:21.600
educators will receive more information about how to access this in the coming days

05:01:24.480 --> 05:01:31.600
just some overall there's specific lexile tools for english language arts they are find a book

05:01:32.640 --> 05:01:40.000
these tools are a tool called analyzer there are word lists there's a career database that allows

05:01:40.880 --> 05:01:47.200
users to identify reading demands needed for a desired career which can inform goal setting

05:01:47.200 --> 05:01:53.760
for students there's a measures manager a growth planner there are grade level charts

05:01:55.600 --> 05:02:01.040
and similar specific quantile tools for mathematics

05:02:01.440 --> 05:02:09.920
they are summer math challenge a tool called that a math skills database is a teacher assistant

05:02:09.920 --> 05:02:18.320
a tool a math at home tool career database again measures manager there's a find your lesson

05:02:18.320 --> 05:02:26.640
a growth planner tool and grade level charts so again more information about access to these

05:02:26.960 --> 05:02:29.920
about access to these resources is coming soon

05:02:33.920 --> 05:02:40.000
so that was the updates on our assessment programs i will now move on to a brief overview of some

05:02:40.000 --> 05:02:46.560
trainings and educator involvement opportunities this fall or to support the use of interim

05:02:46.560 --> 05:02:52.240
assessments we continue to provide virtual hand scoring trainings this fall we will offer two

05:02:52.240 --> 05:02:59.760
types of virtual workshop series one using a train the trainer model for ele and for

05:02:59.760 --> 05:03:05.680
local educational agencies staff trainers and one focus on training teachers who will need to

05:03:05.680 --> 05:03:12.880
conduct hand scoring the goals of both trainings will be for participants to understand the design

05:03:12.880 --> 05:03:18.320
and items item types of interim assessments and how they work together to support learning

05:03:18.800 --> 05:03:25.920
and both trainings will provide level setting for how students writing score writing is scored

05:03:25.920 --> 05:03:29.440
and include time for collaboration and hand scoring practice

05:03:31.920 --> 05:03:37.760
just the overview of the tools for teachers training opportunities with the grand opening

05:03:37.760 --> 05:03:45.680
coming up on september 30th we've done a number of provided some several tools for teachers

05:03:45.680 --> 05:03:53.120
professional opportunities and some upcoming ones as well for example on june 22nd our cde

05:03:53.120 --> 05:03:59.840
staff provided an overview and demonstration webinar to show the key features on july 28th

05:03:59.840 --> 05:04:05.680
smart balance conducted a train the trainer workshop for regional representatives and then

05:04:05.680 --> 05:04:11.920
on september 8th two days ago all california educators were invited to a shared practices

and this fall cde will offer the interim and formative assessment training series and the

05:04:24.160 --> 05:04:30.000
and through the california assessment conference we'll have some virtual sessions on the tools for

05:04:30.000 --> 05:04:40.320
teachers with that which that that leads me to our upcoming 2020 virtual california assessment

05:04:40.400 --> 05:04:46.400

looking forward to working with you as well as with the other new board members thank you

05:08:34.160 --> 05:08:44.320
okay so with that i'm going to stop talking and i will be available to take any questions if there

05:08:44.320 --> 05:08:57.680
are any first we're going to get the public comment slide up there and members of the public

05:08:57.760 --> 05:09:01.280
and members of the public who want to provide comment can call that number

05:09:02.720 --> 05:09:06.320
and while we're waiting for members of the public to call in i want to ask ting sun

05:09:06.880 --> 05:09:11.840
as an assessment liaison if she has any initial comments before me and then we'll ask board

05:09:11.840 --> 05:09:16.880
members if they have any clarifying questions and we'll go to the public comment and come back for

05:09:16.880 --> 05:09:24.080
discussion yeah just a real quick comment as you can see even though we did not have our assessments

05:09:24.880 --> 05:09:32.000
last spring that the work of this division continues to work to go on and so there's still

05:09:32.000 --> 05:09:38.400
a lot of work there thank mal and her staff for the hard work they did and i'm especially excited

05:09:38.400 --> 05:09:43.760
that we will now get the lexile and quantile scores as part of the interim assessments

05:09:44.560 --> 05:09:50.800
i think that this will provide the field and parents during this time of distance learning

05:09:50.800 --> 05:09:56.960
some very actionable tools actionable information and some tools that they can help support their

05:09:56.960 --> 05:10:03.920
students and maybe even mitigate some of the learning loss so i'm very very excited that mal

05:10:03.920 --> 05:10:13.040
was able to get that for us and so just thank you for your persistence and for your hard work

05:10:13.040 --> 05:10:23.440
and getting this to us so quickly and i'll just add my thanks to mal and also recognize the

05:10:24.960 --> 05:10:32.480
perseverance of ting in you know figuring out that there was an additional kind of assistance we

05:10:32.480 --> 05:10:38.400
could offer districts in this moment and really helping us figure out how that might how that

05:10:38.400 --> 05:10:45.120
might work so we're doing as you can see everything we can to help districts figure out how to support

05:10:45.120 --> 05:10:51.120
students learn about their learning and build on that even when we don't have at the moment

05:10:51.680 --> 05:10:59.600
the large-scale summative test from last year i don't see any hands for clarification questions

05:10:59.600 --> 05:11:06.400
at the moment so that being the case we will go ahead to public comment if there is any

05:11:07.360 --> 05:11:16.240
we do not have any public speakers for this item all right so if there's no public comment we can

05:11:16.240 --> 05:11:23.280
have any other board discussion and this is not an action item so really this is just for our

05:11:23.280 --> 05:11:26.800
collective information at this time is there any other board discussion

05:11:27.600 --> 05:11:34.880
seeing none mal thank you very very much we are fully informed and we thank you for all the work

05:11:34.880 --> 05:11:43.280
that has gone into the items that you presented we're going to move right ahead then to item

05:11:43.280 --> 05:11:50.720
five which is the approval of the state seal of civic engagement criteria this item does have an

05:11:50.880 --> 05:11:58.240
criteria this item does have an addendum the cde recommends that the state board adopt the state

05:11:58.240 --> 05:12:03.840
seal of civic engagement recommended criteria for local use the item is presented by barbara

05:12:03.840 --> 05:12:11.280
murchison of the cde nice to see you again barbara take it away nice to be back with you again good

05:12:11.280 --> 05:12:16.320
afternoon president arling hammon chief deputy gregson and board members i'm barbara murchison

05:12:16.400 --> 05:12:22.000
director of the educator excellence and equity division here at the cde it is my pleasure to

05:12:22.000 --> 05:12:26.800
bring to you revised criteria for the state seal of civic engagement for your approval

05:12:27.520 --> 05:12:32.240
this is an action item the cde recommends that the state board of education

05:12:34.800 --> 05:12:43.600
there we go adopt the criteria for use by local educational agencies the criteria designed to

05:12:43.600 --> 05:12:49.200
provide local educational agencies or leas with a framework for making determinations of student

05:12:49.200 --> 05:12:56.640
qualifications required to earn the seal based on their own local context once the criteria are

05:12:56.640 --> 05:13:02.400
approved the cde will encourage leas to implement the criteria in a manner appropriate for their

05:13:02.400 --> 05:13:09.840
own local context to ensure maximum maximum accessibility for all students at all grade levels

05:13:09.840 --> 05:13:12.240
including those in alternative school settings

05:13:15.680 --> 05:13:19.840
based on your feedback we've made several updates to the criteria and guidance

05:13:19.840 --> 05:13:27.520
originally provided to you in july and september of 2019 first i'll quickly review the authorizing

05:13:27.520 --> 05:13:32.080
statute through which the criteria and guidance were developed and then i'll share with you some

05:13:32.080 --> 05:13:36.960
highlights of our updates to the proposed criteria and guidance here is a bit of the

05:13:37.040 --> 05:13:42.240
education code to help ground us in the intent of the legislature it is the intent of the

05:13:42.240 --> 05:13:48.080
legislature to establish a state seal of civic engagement to encourage and create pathways for

05:13:48.720 --> 05:13:53.040
pupils in elementary and secondary schools to become civically engaged

05:13:53.040 --> 05:13:58.320
in democratic governmental institutions at the local state and national levels

05:14:00.720 --> 05:14:06.400
california education code requires the state superintendent of public instruction to develop

05:14:06.400 --> 05:14:11.760
and recommend to the state board of education criteria for awarding the state seal of civic

05:14:11.760 --> 05:14:17.200
engagement students receiving the seal must demonstrate excellence in civics education

05:14:17.200 --> 05:14:22.960
and participation and have an understanding of the united states california constitutions

05:14:22.960 --> 05:14:30.240
and democratic systems of government the statute requires the superintendent to incorporate the

05:14:30.240 --> 05:14:35.200
six proven practices for effective civic learning developed by the education commission of the

05:14:35.200 --> 05:14:41.280
states and any and all other best practices for civic learning and engagement the superintendent

05:14:41.280 --> 05:14:46.160
was also required to consult with a group of classroom teachers who teach history social

05:14:46.160 --> 05:14:50.240
science and secondary schools as part of the criteria development process

05:14:53.600 --> 05:14:58.480
the superintendent was required to consider a number of other criteria including completion

05:14:58.480 --> 05:15:03.280
of history government and civics classes and participation in community service or

05:15:03.280 --> 05:15:08.640
extracurricular activities the statute also provides some flexibility for the superintendent

05:15:08.640 --> 05:15:15.920
to develop other requirements as appropriate here are a couple of other key elements from the

05:15:15.920 --> 05:15:21.680
statute again to ground us in the legislative intent the statute does say that the criteria

05:15:21.680 --> 05:15:28.240
should provide all pupils with the opportunity to earn the seal the statute also provides some

05:15:28.320 --> 05:15:32.880
guidance that the seal should recognize outstanding achievement while also remaining

05:15:32.880 --> 05:15:37.840
somewhat independent of grades or other established measures of achievement the

05:15:37.840 --> 05:15:43.280
seal should also provide benefit to students beyond high school to the extent possible

05:15:44.720 --> 05:15:49.520
so now that i've reviewed the statutory requirements i'm going to quickly review the

05:15:49.520 --> 05:15:55.520
process through which the draft criteria were developed first the cde conducted an application

05:15:55.520 --> 05:16:00.480
process to identify classroom history social science teachers to serve on the state seal of

05:16:00.480 --> 05:16:05.520
civic engagement advisory group we walked the advisory group through a set of prompts based

05:16:05.520 --> 05:16:11.120
on statute to solicit feedback on what should be included in the criteria and then we conducted a

05:16:11.120 --> 05:16:17.520
public comment period around that draft criteria early on we met with members of the advisory

05:16:17.520 --> 05:16:21.760
commission on special education to seek their advice around ensuring the seal was accessible

05:16:21.760 --> 05:16:27.680
to students with disabilities and during this period we also asked cde staff to review the

05:16:27.680 --> 05:16:34.320
draft criteria in particular staff who serve english learners migrant students students in

05:16:34.320 --> 05:16:39.920
special education programs foster youth and youth who are homeless to make sure that the

05:16:39.920 --> 05:16:46.800
criteria were such that all of these students could potentially earn the seal we also convened

05:16:46.880 --> 05:16:52.480
representatives from the power of democracy group the california history social science project

05:16:52.480 --> 05:16:57.760
the constitutional rights foundation the promoting authentic college career and civic

05:16:57.760 --> 05:17:02.880
readiness assessment systems committee the los angeles county office of education

05:17:02.880 --> 05:17:07.200
and the california civic engagement project to help refine those early drafts

05:17:08.800 --> 05:17:14.960
we first presented the criteria to the board in july 2019 for feedback and then again

05:17:14.960 --> 05:17:24.320
in september 2019 for recommended adoption key feedback received in september 2019 included a

05:17:24.320 --> 05:17:29.920
recommendation to look into incorporating civic engagement into the college career indicator

05:17:29.920 --> 05:17:36.640
or cci which i will review in a few minutes we have since partnered with the analysis measurement

05:17:36.640 --> 05:17:42.480
and accountability reporting division within the cde to convene a civic engagement work group

05:17:42.480 --> 05:17:47.920
which is scheduled to meet virtually three times through december 2020 to weigh in on this

05:17:47.920 --> 05:17:53.760
recommendation the cde was originally scheduled to present the updated criteria to the board

05:17:54.560 --> 05:18:01.280
for adoption in may 2020 but this was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak please note that

05:18:01.280 --> 05:18:08.480
the statutory deadline for the board to adopt reject or modify the seal is january 31st 2021

05:18:08.880 --> 05:18:16.880
so cde first presented the criteria to the board on july 10th 2019 and as i shared in september

05:18:16.880 --> 05:18:21.760
i think that was one of the most robust conversations i have ever enjoyed from this place

05:18:21.760 --> 05:18:28.720
here at at the podium people are very engaged and very excited to have the opportunity to

05:18:28.720 --> 05:18:35.360
encourage additional civic engagement amongst our students feedback we received in july 2019

05:18:35.920 --> 05:18:41.360
feedback we received in july 2019 included seeking to ensure that the seal is accessible

05:18:41.360 --> 05:18:47.920
to all students that it would support continuous civic engagement that it would promote diversity

05:18:47.920 --> 05:18:53.440
and inclusion that it would provide multiple opportunities to engage even our youngest student

05:18:54.240 --> 05:18:59.600
and that it would support civic engagement across the content areas and there was also

05:18:59.600 --> 05:19:04.480
quite a lot of conversation regarding how the seal might be included in the accountability system

05:19:05.440 --> 05:19:11.120
some board members suggested that we use this as a local indicator and others thought that it

05:19:11.120 --> 05:19:22.080
should be included in the cci the september 2019 presentation also provided us with additional

05:19:22.080 --> 05:19:28.800
feedback regarding the criteria and guidance since then the cde has worked with stakeholders

05:19:28.800 --> 05:19:34.400
to further modify the criteria and guidance so that it ensures the seal is accessible to

05:19:34.400 --> 05:19:41.040
all california students supports continuous and rigorous civic engagement promotes diversity and

05:19:41.040 --> 05:19:47.360
inclusion engages even the youngest students supports an interdisciplinary approach and

05:19:47.360 --> 05:19:53.520
explicitly recognizes civil disobedience as a form of civic engagement i will provide a

05:19:53.520 --> 05:20:02.880
quick summary of some of these updates for you so of particular importance i think to everyone

05:20:02.880 --> 05:20:08.320
is the intention that the seal remain accessible to all california students we'd like as many

05:20:08.320 --> 05:20:16.720
students as possible to be encouraged to engage in civic affairs so after we created a second path

05:20:16.720 --> 05:20:23.360
to include civic engagement in the cci we revisited the seal criteria to ensure that the

05:20:23.360 --> 05:20:28.080
criteria for this seal the one the criteria that i'm bringing to you for adoption today

05:20:28.080 --> 05:20:34.640
are very clear that the seal should be accessible to as many students as possible first we change

05:20:34.640 --> 05:20:40.000
the language of criterion one so it now reads the student must be engaged in academic work in a

05:20:40.000 --> 05:20:47.040
productive way we also clarified in the guidance to criteria one to be explicit that students in

05:20:47.040 --> 05:20:52.880
alternative school settings are also eligible to earn the seal we recognize that student engagement

05:20:52.880 --> 05:20:58.160
the seal we recognize that student engagement and academic work can look very different based

05:20:58.160 --> 05:21:04.160
on context and not all students may be on track to complete required high school coursework we

05:21:04.160 --> 05:21:10.640
did not want this to be a limited factor for students seeking to earn the seal additionally

05:21:10.640 --> 05:21:15.680
criterion four now guides students to demonstrate civic knowledge skills and dispositions through

05:21:15.680 --> 05:21:21.680
self-reflection the guidance for criterion four also encourages students to self-reflect

05:21:21.680 --> 05:21:28.240
in a variety of formats written and or digital several examples are listed in the guidance

05:21:28.240 --> 05:21:35.120
included written reports public presentations podcasts video and other options we made a

05:21:35.120 --> 05:21:41.760
similar modification to the guidance for criterion five which now encourages adults to use a variety

05:21:41.760 --> 05:21:47.440
of formats to submit recommendations for students applying for the seal while also encouraging lea's

05:21:47.440 --> 05:21:53.280
to provide recommendation templates in languages to the common to the local community to the extent

05:21:53.280 --> 05:22:01.120
possible we heard your feedback regarding ensuring that civic education is not just the purview of

05:22:01.120 --> 05:22:06.080
civics teachers and we strengthened existing language to make it clear that civic education

05:22:06.080 --> 05:22:11.680
has a home across the content areas since the statutory language already lays out a rigorous

05:22:11.680 --> 05:22:17.840
expectation that students will demonstrate an understanding of the us and california constitutions

05:22:17.840 --> 05:22:22.640
and we want to make sure that the seal remains accessible we focused on modifying the guidance

05:22:22.640 --> 05:22:28.000
for criterion two to further encourage students and lea's to approach civic engagement in an

05:22:28.000 --> 05:22:34.400
interdisciplinary manner this guidance now includes a course in world history or its equivalent

05:22:34.400 --> 05:22:40.080
as determined by the lea as a requirement for earning the seal the guidance for criterion two

05:22:40.080 --> 05:22:45.520
also now includes specific support for interdisciplinary coursework including economics

05:22:45.520 --> 05:22:51.120
law geography ethnic studies and current events among others as well as the ability to apply

05:22:51.120 --> 05:22:54.080
this knowledge across multiple settings and circumstances

05:22:57.280 --> 05:23:01.440
we also heard a lot of feedback that while flexibility is important in awarding the seal

05:23:01.440 --> 05:23:07.200
it should also reflect continuous and rigorous civic engagement so we added language about the

05:23:07.200 --> 05:23:13.360
importance of the role of the citizen in a constitutional democracy we also modified the

05:23:13.360 --> 05:23:18.640
language for criterion three which now reads participate in one or more informed civic

05:23:18.640 --> 05:23:23.600
engagement projects that address real world problems and require students to identify

05:23:23.600 --> 05:23:29.600
and inquire into civic needs or problems considered very responses and take action

05:23:29.600 --> 05:23:36.400
and reflect on efforts our intention is that this language encourages students to avoid the tendency

05:23:36.400 --> 05:23:42.800
to engage in one-off projects instead of focusing on long-term thoughtful civic engagement that

05:23:43.520 --> 05:23:49.520
transcends a single class or experience and as you may recall we learned that the term action

05:23:49.520 --> 05:23:54.240
civics is somewhat controversial in some parts of the country to the extent that there is some

05:23:54.240 --> 05:24:00.720
concern that the term has impeded civic education efforts in some states so for that reason we have

05:24:00.720 --> 05:24:04.720
replaced the term action civics with civic engagement

05:24:08.960 --> 05:24:15.040
we heard your september 2019 feedback regarding the special place that civil disobedience has in

05:24:15.040 --> 05:24:20.720
meaningful civic engagement as we all know events that have transpired in recent months have only

05:24:20.720 --> 05:24:26.240
highlighted the significant role that civil disobedience plays in america so we added

05:24:26.240 --> 05:24:31.760
additional guidance to criterion three to reflect this the guidance for criterion three

05:24:31.760 --> 05:24:38.240
now includes a statement that some acts of civil disobedience such as walkouts or sit-ins may be

05:24:38.240 --> 05:24:44.480
considered acts of civic engagement when taken in context of the student's community historic

05:24:44.480 --> 05:24:51.920
examples of this include the 1960 greensboro lunch sit-in and the 1963 birmingham children's march

05:24:52.480 --> 05:24:57.200
and fall under the category of what congressman john lewis referred to as good trouble

05:24:58.960 --> 05:25:05.280
we also refer leas to guidance in criterion five regarding civic mindedness as well as chapter

05:25:05.280 --> 05:25:12.000
17 of the 2016 history social science framework which discusses the role of dissent and civil

05:25:12.000 --> 05:25:18.160
disobedience in the american democratic system our intention is that this will provide enough

05:25:18.240 --> 05:25:23.840
definition that leas can promote examples of civil disobedience when it makes sense within their

05:25:23.840 --> 05:25:30.160
own local context additional information on addressing civil disobedience in the classroom

05:25:30.160 --> 05:25:34.880
is presented in chapter 17 of the history social science framework

05:25:38.560 --> 05:25:42.800
a significant portion of the feedback we received focused on the importance of promoting the

05:25:42.800 --> 05:25:47.760
qualities of citizenship and being a good human being in a manner that promotes diversity and

05:25:47.760 --> 05:25:53.840
inclusion this has been of heightened importance given the events covid 19 outbreak and movements

05:25:53.840 --> 05:25:59.120
for social justice and anti-racism that arose since the last time we presented the criteria

05:25:59.840 --> 05:26:03.840
so in addition to the other changes that i've already highlighted for you today

05:26:03.840 --> 05:26:09.200
we modified the language of and the guidance for criterion five significantly to promote greater

05:26:09.200 --> 05:26:15.760
diversity and inclusivity criterion five now reads exhibit character traits that reflect civic

05:26:15.760 --> 05:26:20.960
mindedness and the commitment to positively impact the classroom school community and or

05:26:20.960 --> 05:26:26.880
society our intention here is to welcome the vast array of character traits that can indicate civic

05:26:26.880 --> 05:26:32.640
mindedness while also emphasizing the positive impact that civic mindedness has not only at

05:26:32.640 --> 05:26:40.480
school but in the community and in the larger society we also made significant updates to

05:26:40.560 --> 05:26:45.040
further promote diversity and inclusion while helping lea's measure civic mindedness

05:26:45.760 --> 05:26:51.600
in the guidance we instruct lea's to consider the extent to which the civic engagement project

05:26:51.600 --> 05:26:56.880
exhibit concern for the rights and well-being of all including members of historically disenfranchised

05:26:56.880 --> 05:27:01.680
racial and ethnic groups we added language stating that civic mindedness may encompass

05:27:01.680 --> 05:27:08.160
a proactive commitment to equity inclusivity racial and ethnic diversity and fairness and

05:27:08.160 --> 05:27:13.840
dismantling structures and practices that have previously excluded select groups from civic

05:27:13.840 --> 05:27:21.360
participation as examples of evidence of observed character traits of civic mindedness we added

05:27:21.360 --> 05:27:26.240
language suggesting that evidence of observed character traits that reflect civic mindedness

05:27:26.240 --> 05:27:32.960
may include standing up for oneself or another who is experiencing bullying harassment discrimination

05:27:32.960 --> 05:27:40.400
exclusion or unwanted attention we also suggested that when looking for evidence of ongoing civic

05:27:40.400 --> 05:27:45.440
engagement lea should consider students demonstrating civic engagement at various points

05:27:45.440 --> 05:27:50.800
throughout one's schooling experience by engaging with one or more groups or organizations that

05:27:50.800 --> 05:27:56.480
attend to community or societal priorities in addition to forms of engagement that are a required

05:27:56.560 --> 05:27:57.680
classroom experience

05:28:01.040 --> 05:28:06.800
finally we also heard you say that we should encourage even more children in the earliest

05:28:06.800 --> 05:28:12.080
grades to be civically engaged even though students can't be awarded the seal until

05:28:12.080 --> 05:28:17.120
completion of a few high school courses our intent is to encourage pathways for people

05:28:17.120 --> 05:28:23.760
from elementary schools and up our language on page one of the document states that even

05:28:23.760 --> 05:28:27.760
the youngest students can engage in and demonstrate civic knowledge skills and

05:28:27.760 --> 05:28:33.120
disposition civic learning opportunities may begin as early as pre-kindergarten elementary

05:28:33.120 --> 05:28:39.520
or middle school we also included language in the guidance for criterion three that encourages

05:28:39.520 --> 05:28:45.600
lea's and students to form ongoing partnerships with community organizations this can incentivize

05:28:45.600 --> 05:28:51.360
ongoing civic engagement for even our youngest students while also continuing to maintain the

05:28:51.360 --> 05:28:56.480
seals accessibility by guiding students to acts of civic engagement unique to their community's

05:28:56.480 --> 05:29:02.720
needs our updated resources to support civic engagement webpage which we're very proud of

05:29:03.440 --> 05:29:08.320
also includes targeted resources for younger students including a section that calls out

05:29:08.320 --> 05:29:13.280
resources specifically for students in kindergarten through grade eight

05:29:13.760 --> 05:29:19.840
so i want to circle back around to our conversation about officially recognizing civic engagement in

05:29:19.840 --> 05:29:28.400
the college career indicator back in the august 2019 information memorandum we shared on this

05:29:28.400 --> 05:29:33.440
topic we noted that the criteria would need to be standardized to ensure that the measure

05:29:33.440 --> 05:29:38.880
is valid and reliable enough to be included in a state-level indicator integrating civic

05:29:38.880 --> 05:29:45.360
level indicator integrating civic engagement into the cci would require extensive developmental

05:29:45.360 --> 05:29:50.720
work and would take some time to execute one issue is that the standardization would reduce

05:29:50.720 --> 05:29:55.440
the number of eligible students which we feel is inconsistent with the authorizing statute

05:29:56.320 --> 05:30:04.160
so in that august 2019 memorandum we recommended exploration of a future advanced seal informed by

05:30:04.160 --> 05:30:10.320
the recipients of the basic seal that we're here deliberating today since i last presented the

05:30:10.320 --> 05:30:17.040
criteria we have partnered with our friends in the accountability division to convene a civic

05:30:17.040 --> 05:30:23.120
engagement work group to go deeper into this possibility of integrating civic engagement

05:30:23.120 --> 05:30:31.040
into the cci the group has met once in august already and we are proposing to convene them again

05:30:31.040 --> 05:30:37.680
in october and december of this year to really go deep into what it would look like to standardize

05:30:37.680 --> 05:30:44.800
measures of civic engagement so that they could be included in the state level indicator we will

05:30:44.800 --> 05:30:49.840
we plan to provide an update to the board on progress towards integrating civic engagement

05:30:49.840 --> 05:30:56.880
into the cci as part of the annual accountability work plan update in next march 2021

05:30:57.440 --> 05:31:02.560
so here are our hopes and dreams for a timeline of when we would be able to integrate a measure of

05:31:02.560 --> 05:31:09.520
civic engagement into the cci one thing we have learned through 2020 is that things are subject

05:31:09.520 --> 05:31:17.120
to change but you can see here on this slide a timeline where we would meet with our work group

05:31:17.120 --> 05:31:24.640
a few times this year and then we can begin to collect data in calpads or calpads and we can

05:31:24.640 --> 05:31:30.320
collect data in calpads around how many students are earning the seal it takes a bit as you know

05:31:30.960 --> 05:31:37.520
to get data collected through calpads and then we hope if things go according to plan that we

05:31:37.520 --> 05:31:45.840
would be able to incorporate some measure of civic engagement into the dashboard by december of 2024

05:31:46.640 --> 05:31:53.760
all that said here are five recommended criteria for the state seal please keep in mind that these

05:31:53.760 --> 05:31:59.600
criteria provide a framework for local educational agencies to adapt to their own local context

05:32:00.560 --> 05:32:06.800
we are very hopeful that many lea's will use them but they are for voluntary use only they are not

05:32:06.800 --> 05:32:11.360
binding we hope that they will tailor them in a way that makes sense for their local communities

05:32:11.440 --> 05:32:16.560
the student must be engaged in academic work in a productive way demonstrate a competent

05:32:16.560 --> 05:32:21.600
understanding of u.s. and california constitutions functions and governance of local governments

05:32:22.560 --> 05:32:28.640
tribal government structures and organizations the role of the citizen in constitutional democracy

05:32:28.640 --> 05:32:36.080
and democratic principles concepts and processes student must also participate in one or more

05:32:36.320 --> 05:32:40.480
informed civic engagement projects that address real world problems and require students to

05:32:40.480 --> 05:32:47.360
identify and inquire into civic needs or problems consider varied responses take action and reflect

05:32:47.360 --> 05:32:53.360
on efforts they must demonstrate civic knowledge skills and dispositions through self-reflection

05:32:54.160 --> 05:32:59.520
and exhibit character traits that reflect civic mindedness and a commitment to positively impact

05:32:59.520 --> 05:33:05.920
the classroom school school and the community of california and california and california

05:33:06.000 --> 05:33:14.640
community and or society so much more information regarding the seal is available on the cde state

05:33:14.640 --> 05:33:20.880
seal of civic engagement webpage including a variety of resources that were used to create

05:33:20.880 --> 05:33:29.440
the criteria and again we are really proud to have developed a new webpage our resources to

05:33:29.520 --> 05:33:37.920
support civic engagement webpage has been updated we know that folks are in resource

05:33:37.920 --> 05:33:45.840
overload a little bit in the era of covid and remote learning so we have reorganized our page

05:33:45.840 --> 05:33:51.440
into tabs in an effort to make it easier for different audiences to find what they need on

05:33:51.440 --> 05:33:57.360
the page there are specific distance learning resources highlighted right as you land there

05:33:57.360 --> 05:34:02.720
as well as the foundational documents to support the work the resources are broken into different

05:34:02.720 --> 05:34:08.880
grade spans and organized by the six proven practices of civic learning there are tabs

05:34:08.880 --> 05:34:17.520
with resources dedicated for students families and educators so with that i want to thank you

05:34:17.520 --> 05:34:23.360
all again for providing such rich helpful feedback in both july and september of last year

05:34:23.920 --> 05:34:29.040
we believe that we have managed to incorporate i mean i think about where we were a year ago

05:34:29.600 --> 05:34:34.880
and we've got the criteria and we've also got a path going to be able to integrate civic

05:34:34.880 --> 05:34:43.440
engagement into the cci so we have come a long way and i also need to thank all of the stakeholders

05:34:43.440 --> 05:34:49.040
who have provided us with feedback on various drafts of the criteria and all of the cde staff

05:34:49.040 --> 05:34:54.400
members past and present who have helped to shepherd this work over the past two years so

05:34:55.360 --> 05:35:01.600
again our recommendation is that the board adopt the recommended criteria for local use

05:35:02.320 --> 05:35:05.600
and i would be happy to take any questions at this time

05:35:05.600 --> 05:35:16.000
thank you very much barbara we want to put up the public comment slide

05:35:17.440 --> 05:35:25.280
and unless there are any clarifying quick clarifying questions now we'll take a discussion

05:35:25.280 --> 05:35:32.800
after the public comment and after we've heard from our liaison kim do you want to give us

05:35:33.360 --> 05:35:40.560
sort of a little framing where are you kim are you there i am okay great further down in the

05:35:40.560 --> 05:35:49.360
hollywood squares yeah so i just wanted to first start by thanking barbara in particular but the

05:35:49.360 --> 05:35:58.720
whole cde team for an incredible amount of work i think it's it's a herculean task integrating so

05:35:58.800 --> 05:36:05.440
much impassioned feedback but i think for all of us who are board members who are who view this

05:36:05.440 --> 05:36:12.720
as part of civic service and civic engagement i think it was demonstrated by how how invested

05:36:12.720 --> 05:36:19.040
everyone has been in making sure that we launch this appropriately i think they've also done a

05:36:19.040 --> 05:36:25.120
really great job of addressing some of the questions about how to incorporate this into

05:36:25.120 --> 05:36:32.800
the accountability conversation and having the two tracks for a basic seal as well as a more

05:36:32.800 --> 05:36:40.720
advanced one that will be on a separate sort of work group and calendar has been fantastic

05:36:42.240 --> 05:36:47.760
the inclusion of early learners i think is is something that i was also very delighted to see

05:36:48.880 --> 05:36:54.400
recognizing that you are not suddenly civic minded upon graduation but that this is a

05:36:54.400 --> 05:37:05.360
lifelong learning process that starts early and lastly language around sort of what inclusivity

05:37:05.360 --> 05:37:14.400
actually means more concretely to actually sort of say how how that lives and functions in the world

05:37:15.040 --> 05:37:25.200
i think the presentation already sort of went through how the cci question will be

05:37:25.760 --> 05:37:29.280
answered i also just want to recognize that we got a ton of public comment

05:37:30.000 --> 05:37:34.720
and i want to say thank you to the many many students who submitted letters and emails across

05:37:34.720 --> 05:37:40.560
the state we got quite a few from and i'm just going to read a sampling from torrance garden

05:37:40.560 --> 05:37:47.280
grove oakland santa rosa cerritos san diego san clemeni diablo woodier freemont san jose

05:37:47.280 --> 05:37:54.640
los gatos calabasas copertino elk grove san mateo and i will stop reading geographies now

05:37:56.000 --> 05:38:04.560
but i i take it all as a endorsement of of a level of student interest and engagement in this topic

05:38:04.560 --> 05:38:11.760
which is really healthy and that this practice of even submitting emails and letters of support

05:38:11.760 --> 05:38:20.480
is a sure sign of how important it is for folks the last thing that i was going to bring forward

05:38:20.480 --> 05:38:29.840
and i think that barbara might have a slide that might be able to be pulled up is is a last piece

05:38:29.840 --> 05:38:35.120
of language that i am proposing to wait wait can we wait until after public comment for that

05:38:35.120 --> 05:38:41.200
because we're getting beyond clarification okay sorry yes great it will be a discussion and i

05:38:41.200 --> 05:38:45.120
want to be sure we get to public comment okay i also want to just fly for folks that we're

05:38:45.120 --> 05:38:50.560
going to lose two board members one at six and one at 6 30 we're going to need to

05:38:51.760 --> 05:38:57.600
up our pace to get to the votes that have to happen at the end of the day before we lose them

05:38:58.320 --> 05:39:05.120
um so let's get to public comment if you if we can um yes and we'll come back to

05:39:05.120 --> 05:39:08.080

05:39:34.640 --> 05:39:41.840
and i really want to say that the state seal of civic engagement supports so many of our

05:39:41.840 --> 05:39:47.280
organization's goals most specifically our commitment to equity and inclusion for all

05:39:47.280 --> 05:39:53.360
students and support for the civic mission of schools the seal can encourage and increase the

05:39:53.360 --> 05:39:59.680
capacity of local education agencies to deliver high quality civic learning to every student

05:39:59.680 --> 05:40:04.160
but with a special emphasis on students of color those from low-income families and those with

05:40:04.160 --> 05:40:14.320
disabilities further this item stresses the importance of civic education being infused

05:40:14.320 --> 05:40:19.280
at all grade levels we believe even the youngest students can and should have experiences

05:40:19.280 --> 05:40:21.120
that help them see themselves as civic

05:40:27.200 --> 05:40:33.040

05:40:48.320 --> 05:40:53.280
on behalf of riverside county superintendent of schools dr judy white we support the recommended

05:40:53.280 --> 05:40:58.560
criteria for the state's deal of civic engagement and offer two additional considerations as you

05:40:58.560 --> 05:41:03.040
further engage in discussions on how the seal might evolve or be incorporated into the college

05:41:03.040 --> 05:41:08.240
and career indicator we ask that you consider the timing of one student's career and their

05:41:08.480 --> 05:41:12.880
the timing of when students complete the seal we believe the completion should be earlier in

05:41:12.880 --> 05:41:18.240
a student's academic career in order to maximize the benefits of this distinction in college

05:41:18.240 --> 05:41:23.360
applications scholarships and career this is especially important for some call some

05:41:23.360 --> 05:41:30.160
colleges and universities including the uc will no longer use fat and act test courts for admissions

05:41:30.800 --> 05:41:36.560
and second how a student's capacity is consistently measured whether it's through a course grade test

05:41:36.560 --> 05:41:42.880
or interview to ensure that all students have access rigor and equity in earning the seal of

05:41:42.880 --> 05:41:54.080
civic engagement thank you for your time thank you speaker thank you for calling you are now

in utilizing youth voice and influences to influence decisions students must have opportunities to

05:43:08.640 --> 05:43:12.720
learn how to create change within their schools and communities and be supported in doing so

05:43:12.800 --> 05:43:18.000

good afternoon i'm john transvenia i'm california executive director for generation citizen

05:44:23.840 --> 05:44:28.800
who promote action civics and high school civic engagement i want to commend the board and the

05:44:28.800 --> 05:44:34.720
staff particularly being able to conduct this meeting in spite of covid we will beat covid

05:44:34.720 --> 05:44:40.720
will beat covid but it is exposing inequities and potentially leaving a legacy of cynicism

05:44:40.720 --> 05:44:46.800
and mistrust in government that is why it's such a key time to strengthen democracy repair the

05:44:46.800 --> 05:44:54.480
health of the body politics and the state seal of civic engagement is a vital and critical tool

05:44:55.120 --> 05:45:00.320
to do that not only for this generation but for the next the state seal promotes civic training

05:45:00.320 --> 05:45:04.960
and engagement when high school students are forming their identities so part of their

05:45:04.960 --> 05:45:12.000
identity should be as members of communities and civic identity is certainly a part of that

05:45:12.560 --> 05:45:17.200
i want to associate my remarks also with the previous comments from the representative of

05:45:17.200 --> 05:45:22.800

recommendation on the state seal of civic engagement we urge the board though to encourage

05:45:55.120 --> 05:46:01.920
the department to build the capacity of lea to implement the seal as recommended by the

05:46:01.920 --> 05:46:08.800

state high school in the mount diablo unified school district in walnut creek california

05:46:44.320 --> 05:46:49.120
i'm calling today to urge you to vote yes on item five the california state civic engagement i want

05:46:49.120 --> 05:46:53.280
to convince staff on a very well-prepared and thorough presentation i mean for recognizing

05:46:53.280 --> 05:46:56.960
that the field would be a starting point in providing avenues for civic learning opportunities

05:46:56.960 --> 05:47:02.640
for k-12 students making sure those opportunities are early and frequent and that they are available

05:47:02.640 --> 05:47:08.720
to all students this the state field i think would be a great jumping point especially for

05:47:08.720 --> 05:47:13.920
combating inadequate provision of civic learning opportunities especially common in schools serving

05:47:13.920 --> 05:47:19.280
low-income communities communities of color and immigrant communities and i also urge you to

05:47:19.280 --> 05:47:24.240
consider voting to allocate funds specific learning work to ensure a multi-disciplinary approach

05:47:24.240 --> 05:47:28.320
and multiple access points thank you so much for your work and for your leadership

05:47:29.120 --> 05:47:35.200
and i hope you vote yes on the state field thank you very much speaker next speaker please state

05:47:35.200 --> 05:47:38.640
your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

05:47:38.640 --> 05:47:48.640
hello i'm dr erica hudson speaking on behalf of lead a research consortium out of ucr and ucla

05:47:48.640 --> 05:47:53.920
that studies and supports access to civic learning opportunities i'm very excited by the leadership

05:47:53.920 --> 05:47:59.120
of the state board and cde in developing the state seal of civic engagement and i urge you

05:47:59.120 --> 05:48:04.560
to approve it today there is strong evidence in the research that high quality civic learning

05:48:04.560 --> 05:48:09.600
opportunities promote both capacities for and commitments to civic engagement

05:48:09.600 --> 05:48:14.560
but unfortunately the research also indicates that exposure to civic learning in schools is

05:48:14.560 --> 05:48:20.160
infrequent and unequal for example high achieving students white students and students from higher

05:48:20.160 --> 05:48:26.320
ses backgrounds often get more exposure to civic learning so this is why a systemic commitment to

05:48:26.320 --> 05:48:32.080
civic learning from the state and also lea's is so important to ensure that all students have access

05:48:32.720 --> 05:48:38.560
and we believe that the field can help promote this important commitment however a range of

05:48:38.560 --> 05:48:44.320
supports will be necessary and the state board and cde can play a critical role in this new research

05:48:44.320 --> 05:48:51.120
that our group is conducting we're finding that attention thank you speaker thank you thank you

05:48:53.280 --> 05:48:58.080
next speaker please state your name and affiliation for the record and your time starts now

05:48:58.480 --> 05:49:04.240
good afternoon i'm huling lean the executive director of a statewide working group to promote

05:49:04.240 --> 05:49:08.960
authentic college career and civic readiness assessment systems or pacris we have been

05:49:08.960 --> 05:49:14.080
partnering with cde to support the state seal civic engagement for over two years now because

05:49:14.080 --> 05:49:19.520
we really believe the seal represents an important step toward realizing a more holistic

05:49:20.160 --> 05:49:25.040
and equitable outcomes for students we have submitted a letter to the board signed by over

05:49:25.360 --> 05:49:32.160
30 members representing various stakeholders and organizations to encourage the state board to

05:49:32.160 --> 05:49:38.160
approve the state seal civic engagement criteria today we commend the state board and cde for your

05:49:38.160 --> 05:49:43.840
thoughtfulness in setting out the student criteria to be as equitable and inclusive as possible i

05:49:43.840 --> 05:49:48.160
also want to thank the department for their collaboration and hard work to go through the

05:49:48.160 --> 05:49:53.920
so many the many iterations of the criteria to ensure for greater inclusion so please approve

05:49:53.920 --> 05:49:59.280
the seal criteria today so that students across california can be recognized for their community

05:49:59.280 --> 05:50:04.960
and civic engagement efforts as soon as possible thank you thank you speaker and this concludes

05:50:04.960 --> 05:50:12.960
our public comment it's very good um thank you very much um i'm going to urge us to

05:50:13.760 --> 05:50:19.120
think quickly about this it's an important topic we spent a lot of time on it i think

05:50:19.120 --> 05:50:24.960
we have a lot of interest and support uh in the board uh is there any discussion

05:50:24.960 --> 05:50:30.560
and i know kimmy wanted to launch us with at least one piece of discussion discussion

05:50:33.440 --> 05:50:42.640
do you want to start us off kim yes um so i i think um what is fantastic is um how much criteria five

05:50:42.640 --> 05:50:51.360
um lifts up this idea of civic mindedness as encompassing um an embrace of um the

05:50:52.400 --> 05:50:58.560
diversity and inclusion uh that that lives um here in california and and is something

05:50:59.120 --> 05:51:05.200
that enables us to sort of think about the common good and work collectively on behalf of the common

05:51:05.200 --> 05:51:16.640
good um there's language that i think might be able to be brought up um which and if not i can

05:51:16.640 --> 05:51:23.920
oh okay there's amendment language that i'm offering which is um to actually thread the

05:51:23.920 --> 05:51:31.600
needle between criteria one and criteria five um which is around the idea of knowledge of our

05:51:31.600 --> 05:51:39.440
constitution and this idea of an inclusive society the legislative findings leading up

05:51:40.160 --> 05:51:46.000
to this body of work very much emphasize that there are fewer opportunities for low income

05:51:46.000 --> 05:51:54.880
students for black and latino students to engage in civic opportunities and civic learning spaces

05:51:55.680 --> 05:52:02.400
um notably also i think um obviously and you'll see this following in the parens we're just

05:52:02.400 --> 05:52:10.800
following the eg um that our constitution in fact um also talks about broadening um the

05:52:10.800 --> 05:52:16.400
franchise as one of the most revered forms of civic engagement so the 15th amendment extended

05:52:16.400 --> 05:52:23.440
the franchise um regardless of past conditions of servitude of slavery obviously in the 19th

05:52:23.440 --> 05:52:31.120
amendment extending the franchise to women um i think the this language is important i think to

05:52:31.120 --> 05:52:37.840
add to thread these these needles and also to connect to these two concepts um and then i guess

05:52:37.840 --> 05:52:43.680
i'll i'll just also add of course that the preamble to the constitution starts with what we are

05:52:44.480 --> 05:52:50.000
the work of the constitution is about creating a more perfect union and establishing justice um

05:52:50.000 --> 05:52:58.720
and that is the actual language of the preamble um i will maybe just conclude by saying i think

05:52:58.720 --> 05:53:05.520
uh it's fantastic that good trouble and the john lewis quote is encompassed within the types of

05:53:05.520 --> 05:53:12.160
civil disobedience um that is pro-social productive and about engaging students in a different way

05:53:12.160 --> 05:53:17.920
um and i will close with the john lewis quote that is not as often read which is that democracy is

05:53:17.920 --> 05:53:23.440
not a state it is an act and each generation must do its part to help build what we call

05:53:23.440 --> 05:53:30.240
the beloved community a nation and world society at peace with itself what a great way to launch

05:53:30.240 --> 05:53:35.760
this discussion um and we've had so much productive discussion about this and barbara i really

05:53:35.760 --> 05:53:41.280
appreciate the way in which you so carefully integrated all of that discussion into the item

05:53:41.360 --> 05:53:49.360
that's being brought before us um so let's see if there is any further discussion now i assume

05:53:49.360 --> 05:53:55.680
kim that the amended language would be part of the motion that you would suggest us to make on the

05:53:55.680 --> 05:54:05.760
criteria is there further discussion i see patricia i see cynthia patricia i wanted to raise my hand to

05:54:05.760 --> 05:54:12.720
support the suggested amendments that board member patio bronson is making and i also want

05:54:12.720 --> 05:54:19.920
to just say especially in the context of what we are witnessing in the news and in events that are

05:54:19.920 --> 05:54:26.000
happening in communities around this country i think that the work that has been done on

05:54:26.000 --> 05:54:32.160
being more expansive in the definition of civic engagement i i'm hoping that by creating this

05:54:32.240 --> 05:54:39.280
definition and creating some flexibility in the criteria that this privileges the opportunity

05:54:39.280 --> 05:54:45.760
for more students and not just students like our new student board member to have the opportunity

05:54:45.760 --> 05:54:54.160
to earn this particular seal and what i'm hoping is that um it will encourage a broad community

05:54:54.160 --> 05:55:00.640
of students in the graduating class to see the seal and to see it on their diploma my goal would

05:55:00.640 --> 05:55:06.800
be for high schools to be able to offer this to 100 of their graduating seniors by the time we're

05:55:06.800 --> 05:55:14.160
ready to implement this because this is not about academic grading it's about actual participation

05:55:14.160 --> 05:55:19.600
and the type of leadership skills that students should be engaged in not only in their schools

05:55:19.600 --> 05:55:24.880
for student government activities but for all the other types of activities that create a school

05:55:24.960 --> 05:55:30.960
community and that contribute to the types of school climate that about that tend to be the

05:55:30.960 --> 05:55:35.840
reasons why many students see their high school years as part of the best parts of their life

05:55:36.720 --> 05:55:44.080
thank you very much um cynthia and then sue i first just wanted to start by saying again kudos

05:55:44.080 --> 05:55:50.880
to cd staff as well as state board members past and present um for really ensuring accessibility

05:55:50.880 --> 05:55:56.960
and inclusivity for all students to be able to access this seal i think it's very very

05:55:57.760 --> 05:56:04.800
important as was as kim had stated to ensure that the understanding of civic engagement

05:56:05.600 --> 05:56:11.840
does include good trouble if you will and positive acts of civil disobedience and it's

05:56:11.840 --> 05:56:19.440
it's wonderful to see that included to understand and again ensure that everyone can have a way that

05:56:19.440 --> 05:56:26.080
they are able to engage in the seal itself and also the interdisciplinary approach i just wanted

05:56:26.080 --> 05:56:35.360
to throw um just a thought moving forward that as the seal becomes accessible to students it's going

05:56:35.360 --> 05:56:42.240
to be really important to support lea's so that they are able to support students to have the

05:56:42.240 --> 05:56:48.640
access and to be able to meet the criteria so really looking at what that might look like how

05:56:48.640 --> 05:56:55.440
might the system of support be able to possibly help with that are areas that can be used for

05:56:55.440 --> 05:57:01.680
further exploration to have the seal and such wonderful criteria without on roads for students

05:57:01.680 --> 05:57:06.800
to access them through their schools and their districts won't be as helpful so just want to be

05:57:06.800 --> 05:57:13.440
sure that we continue the conversation beyond thank you excellent thank you sue and then eileen

05:57:14.000 --> 05:57:18.240
and then jim so i will just echo the

05:57:21.200 --> 05:57:25.840
compliments to barbara especially and her staff for incorporating all of the various

05:57:26.880 --> 05:57:31.360
work suggestions that we made at different meetings and then also all of the suggestions

05:57:31.360 --> 05:57:36.480
that folks have made from the public and i just have a clarifying question kim i'm not i'm just

05:57:36.480 --> 05:57:42.560
not sure what where this is intended to go is it meant to be a separate criteria

05:57:43.280 --> 05:57:49.280
or it's i'm just i'm just not confused about it it doesn't have track changes so kim why don't you

05:57:49.280 --> 05:57:56.640
explain the language following the bullet um is already in the document uh the part that is new

05:57:56.640 --> 05:58:03.840
is the parenz which is an illustrative example the eg um don't you just read aloud the part that

05:58:03.840 --> 05:58:09.360
would be added to what's already there eg connecting the 15th amendment suffrage

05:58:09.360 --> 05:58:14.800
protections to address anti-black racism racism and discrimination against other racial minorities

05:58:14.800 --> 05:58:19.840
and immigrants including but not limited to native americans latinx asian americans and

05:58:19.840 --> 05:58:24.720
other language minorities protected by the voting rights act and the 19th amendments protection of

05:58:24.800 --> 05:58:28.320
women's right to vote thank you so much for the clarification

05:58:30.640 --> 05:58:37.360
all right uh was that was that all you had sued that you wanted to offer at this moment

05:58:37.360 --> 05:58:43.680
okay then we'll move to eileen and then jim and then zake just a quick comment um barbara to you

05:58:43.680 --> 05:58:48.960
and your team um i just so appreciate how you walked through the entire process so that people

05:58:48.960 --> 05:58:54.640
can see this is a long time in development and we had a lot of important stakeholder input and i

05:58:54.640 --> 05:59:01.440
believe the criteria that we have now come to recommending for adoption really does lay important

05:59:02.480 --> 05:59:08.720
guidance for districts and important activities for students to be involved in i'm really proud

05:59:08.720 --> 05:59:13.600
of this work and for everyone who's worked so hard on this and i just appreciate you laying

05:59:13.600 --> 05:59:18.880
it out talking about what led up and what will come next so thank you very much um again i'm

05:59:18.960 --> 05:59:26.240
really supportive of the product that we got to at this point it's great jim yes thank you i just

05:59:26.240 --> 05:59:32.560
want to say thank you for all the good work on this i think uh it's been well overdue for to have

05:59:32.560 --> 05:59:39.840
something like this a seal of civic engagement i appreciate the criteria too that students are

05:59:39.840 --> 05:59:46.320
to demonstrate a competency in the understanding constitutions and as well as tribal governments

05:59:47.040 --> 05:59:56.640
and tribal government structures and organizations i on behalf of the over 566 federally recognized

05:59:56.640 --> 06:00:04.000
tribes in the united states and over 120 federally recognized tribes in california alone and then

06:00:04.000 --> 06:00:13.520
dozens of unrecognized groups also so i really appreciate that and commend all the work on this

06:00:13.520 --> 06:00:20.320
on this one thank you terrific and zade you may get the last word before we have a motion

06:00:21.120 --> 06:00:27.040
which is very appropriate um well i just really quickly wanted to echo what board member rucker

06:00:27.040 --> 06:00:32.880
said i'm just so glad that this seal isn't tied to grades and truly does a phenomenal job of

06:00:32.880 --> 06:00:38.640
understanding what civic engagement truly is i think that the the criteria currently is

06:00:39.120 --> 06:00:43.360
um both equitable and accessible and i think that the letters that we all receive

06:00:43.360 --> 06:00:47.920
kind of serve as a testament to just how much students truly want this deal to not only

06:00:47.920 --> 06:00:52.720
incentivize them to be civically engaged but to also recognize them for the for their current

06:00:52.720 --> 06:00:56.400
involvement and for the hard work that they're putting into their community so with that being

06:00:56.400 --> 06:01:01.920
said i think that um i don't know i'm fully in support of this all right can i get a motion

06:01:01.920 --> 06:01:11.360
um so i move to adopt the department's recommended criteria for local use with the addition of uh the

06:01:11.360 --> 06:01:19.760
language that appears on screen now okay and do i have a second i will second i second yes thank

06:01:19.760 --> 06:01:27.680
you great uh any further discussion all right we're going to call the roll karen okay ting

06:01:27.680 --> 06:01:33.840
ting aye allene aye trisha

06:01:36.640 --> 06:01:57.600

okay very good we did it we passed it uh and thank you to barbara and all the staff who

06:02:11.520 --> 06:02:17.120
worked on it uh this is a really important accomplishment i can tell you that this seal

06:02:17.120 --> 06:02:24.240
and what it represents will um have uh an effect across the country there are lots of people

06:02:24.320 --> 06:02:30.960
watching this as they think about their own systems of education and accountability and

06:02:31.600 --> 06:02:37.120
the fact that we're taking this step i think will as they sometimes say when california sneezes the

06:02:37.120 --> 06:02:44.400
country catches a cold well i think this will be a good sneeze that will find its way

06:02:44.400 --> 06:02:51.040
into lots and lots of state boardrooms thank you very much barbara and now we're going to move

06:02:51.120 --> 06:02:57.200
straight ahead i know we have to really kind of barrel forward um on item number six we

06:02:57.200 --> 06:03:02.960
have a public hearing and i want to be sure that we get to that get to and through that public

06:03:02.960 --> 06:03:12.640
hearing uh because folks are lined up to present their cases here um eight item uh six is a public

06:03:12.640 --> 06:03:20.160
hearing regarding an appeal to transfer territory from the londale esd and sentinel valley union

06:03:20.160 --> 06:03:26.400
high school district into the wiseburn usd the cde is recommending that the state board deny the

06:03:26.400 --> 06:03:31.440
appeal thus affirming the action of the county committee to approve the proposal to transfer

06:03:31.440 --> 06:03:38.000
territory from londale and sentinel valley to the wiseburn usd the cd further recommends that the

06:03:38.000 --> 06:03:43.520
state board establish the territory proposed for transfer as the election area for the required

06:03:43.520 --> 06:03:49.120
election on the proposal and provide no division of the property funds and obligations of the

06:03:49.120 --> 06:03:55.200
londale and sentinel valley if the transfer is approved an election and this item is presented

06:03:55.200 --> 06:04:01.440
by larry shirey of the cde i'm sure it will be an excellent and succinct presentation

06:04:02.960 --> 06:04:10.960
take it away larry yes it will be i'll do my best to abbreviate it by popular demand and given the

06:04:10.960 --> 06:04:16.320
timelines not my strength but we will go through as quickly as we can we need six board members

06:04:16.320 --> 06:04:21.200
to vote in any direction for it to for us to have a decision and we want to get there before

06:04:21.200 --> 06:04:26.720
we lose a couple sorry i didn't hear i didn't hear you i'm sorry go right ahead i'm just saying we

06:04:26.720 --> 06:04:32.800
we need to be sure we get there before we lose board members okay so as as was mentioned this

06:04:32.800 --> 06:04:38.640
was a uh an appeal of a territory transfer uh approval by the la county committee

06:04:39.600 --> 06:04:46.880
um the issue here is uh 406 homes outlined in yellow on the map currently in the londale

06:04:46.880 --> 06:04:53.200
elementary school district and that they have initiated a petition to move the territory the

06:04:53.200 --> 06:04:58.800
406 homes into wiseburn unified a couple of interesting background issues that there's

06:04:58.800 --> 06:05:04.640
been a long history of open enrollment agreements for students here both londale and wiseburn for

06:05:04.720 --> 06:05:09.600
decades have entered into agreements allow students in these areas to attend any district

06:05:09.600 --> 06:05:17.040
either district they want a lot of charter high schools in the area about 47 percent of the high

06:05:17.040 --> 06:05:22.960
school students attend a charter high school all of wiseburn's high schools three of them are

06:05:22.960 --> 06:05:28.160
charter high school sentinel valley in addition to its three comprehensive high schools has two

06:05:29.120 --> 06:05:34.000
charter high schools and each of the elementary component districts in that high school district

06:05:34.000 --> 06:05:42.240
have at least one including londale um wiseburn used to be a component district of sentinel valley

06:05:42.240 --> 06:05:50.560
but the state board approved their unification proposal uh 2013 the petitioners have three

06:05:50.560 --> 06:05:58.720
primary reasons for wanting to transfer um as as you can see that they're part of an unincorporated

06:05:58.720 --> 06:06:04.560
area that locally they refer to as wiseburn the census bureau calls it del air so we'll use del

06:06:04.560 --> 06:06:11.040
air that they claim they're the only residents in this area that are not part of wiseburn school

06:06:11.040 --> 06:06:17.920
district we've already talked about the open enrollment um issues and the primary reason is

06:06:17.920 --> 06:06:23.920
that the petitioners want to ensure that their neighborhood students have access to wiseburn's

06:06:24.720 --> 06:06:28.960
higher performing charter high schools again these are charter high schools but

06:06:29.920 --> 06:06:37.680
but wiseburn gives preference to residents of of wiseburn and the remaining slots are very competitive

06:06:39.840 --> 06:06:45.120
what the county committee did is as we talked about before in previous issues there are nine

06:06:45.120 --> 06:06:51.600
statutory threshold standards that the county committee has to meet has to look at they took

06:06:52.160 --> 06:06:57.920
they found that all those standards were met even though and then as they moved into considering

06:06:58.800 --> 06:07:06.160
why to approve this they took no formal action to adopt a reason but they've been reviewing

06:07:06.160 --> 06:07:10.240
their discussions throughout the meeting they focused a lot on community identity issues

06:07:10.800 --> 06:07:15.600
and they noted that even though there's choice out there and the students can go whatever district

06:07:15.600 --> 06:07:21.120
they want to uh inter-district transfer students are treated differently than resident students

06:07:21.120 --> 06:07:27.040
in terms of having to renew permits every year parents can't vote in district elections etc

06:07:28.800 --> 06:07:36.320
lawndale is appealing sentinel valley is also affected here but for reasons that if you want

06:07:36.320 --> 06:07:43.520
to know i'll go into but i'm not going to go into right now they have some protections that

06:07:43.520 --> 06:07:50.000
came out of the unification issues so the primary reasons are going to be looking at lawndale

06:07:51.120 --> 06:07:56.480
lawndale states that there's no reason to approve this territory transfer because there's really no

06:07:56.480 --> 06:08:02.240
compelling community identity with wiseburn they claim that the commutes to wiseburn schools are

06:08:02.240 --> 06:08:08.640
less safe they are concerned about a permanent loss of the students in this area as well as the

06:08:08.640 --> 06:08:13.360
assessed valuation they note that there's a long history of open enrollment agreements as we

06:08:13.360 --> 06:08:18.320
discussed so there's really again no reason to do this and they note that it's bad public policy

06:08:18.320 --> 06:08:26.000
to use school district reorganizations as a way to to promote promote competition for the

06:08:26.000 --> 06:08:32.560
higher performing schools we're going to look at those reasons primarily in the context of the

06:08:32.560 --> 06:08:36.960
minimum threshold standards that i mentioned previously and the ones that don't fit in those

06:08:36.960 --> 06:08:41.920
standards we'll talk about when i when i briefly go through the reasons to approve or disapprove

06:08:41.920 --> 06:08:48.000
the transfer the three conditions in statute that we're going to be looking at our community

06:08:48.000 --> 06:08:52.640
identity community identity the school districts are each organized on the basis of a substantial

06:08:52.640 --> 06:08:58.000
community identity the issue of there being an equitable equitable division of property and

06:08:58.000 --> 06:09:04.800
facilities of in this case the lawndale and sentinel valley districts and that the proposed

06:09:04.800 --> 06:09:11.360
reorganization will not have a negative effect on the fiscal status of the of any affected district

06:09:12.400 --> 06:09:18.400
regarding the first condition compelling the community identity lawndale argues that the

06:09:18.400 --> 06:09:25.520
choice block students are are are already able to participate in all community activities and

06:09:25.520 --> 06:09:31.920
transferring to to the new district is not going to change that therefore there is no improvement

06:09:31.920 --> 06:09:38.560
in the community identity of this area that in terms of this condition is not part of the standard

06:09:38.800 --> 06:09:44.480
is not part of the standard and failure to improve community identity is not a reason to find this

06:09:44.480 --> 06:09:52.240
condition not substantially met another component of the community identity is londale's claim that

06:09:52.240 --> 06:09:57.600
commutes to the wiseburn schools are less safe due to longer distances in a freeway that exists

06:09:57.600 --> 06:10:05.680
between the choice blocks and schools if you want to see the actual distances the table on page 15

06:10:05.680 --> 06:10:11.920
of the attachment but we find that commutes are not significantly longer to wiseburn schools and

06:10:11.920 --> 06:10:20.320
londale we do acknowledge that freeways exist as they do in almost all urban areas in our state

06:10:20.320 --> 06:10:27.840
in this case interstate 405 runs through wiseburn all of wiseburn schools are on the west side of

06:10:27.840 --> 06:10:34.640
this freeway that's the that's kind of the basis for londale's concern is that the proposed transfer

06:10:34.640 --> 06:10:40.400
area students have to cross the freeway but so do all those students who live just north of the

06:10:40.400 --> 06:10:46.480
transfer area again all the all the schools for wiseburn are on the west side i also note that

06:10:46.480 --> 06:10:53.040
the freeway as it goes down cuts right through londale all of londale's middle schools are on

06:10:53.040 --> 06:10:59.040
the east side of the freeway so it also it also cuts off the students on the west side of the

06:10:59.040 --> 06:11:06.960
freeway from attending as an obstacle for londale attendance in middle schools finally there is a

06:11:06.960 --> 06:11:12.960
very large shopping center just south of the transfer area that's between the rest of the

06:11:12.960 --> 06:11:19.280
londale district and the and and the transfer area all told we don't see a lot of difference

06:11:19.280 --> 06:11:27.840
between what district these students are in again freeways busy streets and and shopping centers are

06:11:27.840 --> 06:11:34.720
fairly common in urban areas londale also is concerned that the assessed valuation that

06:11:34.720 --> 06:11:38.880
they'll lose from this property will affect its ability to secure future bonding

06:11:39.760 --> 06:11:46.000
efforts and it exacerbate exacerbate the existing disparity between londale's and wiseburn's

06:11:46.000 --> 06:11:52.800
assessed valuation we note that choice blocks does not make up a significant portion of londale's

06:11:52.800 --> 06:12:00.160
assessed valuation at 4.3 percent further londale the assessed valuation in the district has has

06:12:00.160 --> 06:12:06.880
increased more than 21 percent over the past past five years that's five percent a year which is a

06:12:06.880 --> 06:12:12.960
higher rate of growth than was that was projected when this territory transfer proposal was

06:12:12.960 --> 06:12:19.840
considered locally the district has just had recent successful bond elections most recently

06:12:19.840 --> 06:12:26.480
in march of this year so there is already a potential for bond funds available and if they

06:12:26.480 --> 06:12:33.360
run into problems accessing this this these bond funds state board is very good about about

06:12:33.360 --> 06:12:40.160
approving waivers to increase the bonding capacity of the district so we find that that condition

06:12:40.160 --> 06:12:46.960
also this is the equitable division condition is also met moving into the fiscal effects

06:12:47.760 --> 06:12:54.080
the districts report that currently there are 43 choice block students that attend londale and 95

06:12:54.080 --> 06:13:01.600
that attend wiseburn for 1920 these 43 students represent less than three less than one percent at

06:13:01.600 --> 06:13:06.720
three quarters of a percent of the londale enrollment therefore we don't see this as being

06:13:06.720 --> 06:13:14.560
a significant loss in terms of either students or or funding londale is going to argue and has argued

06:13:14.560 --> 06:13:21.360
that all 38 students should be considered as a permanent loss if the territory is transferred we

06:13:21.360 --> 06:13:26.720
don't see a lot of support for that given that the number of students that have attended wiseburn

06:13:26.720 --> 06:13:31.280
from this area over the years has been very consistent so it's a it's a hard to argue

06:13:31.920 --> 06:13:38.080
that you're losing funding that you haven't ever had londale also supports open enrollment which

06:13:38.080 --> 06:13:44.960
says to us that they have supported losing students in the past from this area as a as we noted

06:13:44.960 --> 06:13:51.920
95 of them currently attend wiseburn so we find this fiscal status condition to be substantially met

06:13:53.920 --> 06:14:00.320
once so we find that all the conditions as did the county committee are substantially met therefore

06:14:00.320 --> 06:14:06.080
we're going to move into some reasons why the state board might want to disapprove or approve

06:14:07.040 --> 06:14:13.200
the territory transfer as has already been brought up open enrollment of options already exist

06:14:13.200 --> 06:14:20.000
for choice block students londale elementary enrollment has been declining as has been the

06:14:20.000 --> 06:14:25.520
case for many districts in the state while the enrollment is increasing in wiseburn it's kind

06:14:25.520 --> 06:14:32.080
of an apples and oranges comparison wiseburn for for decades has been a destination district for

06:14:32.080 --> 06:14:37.920
a variety of reasons when the state board considered their unification proposal in 2013

06:14:38.640 --> 06:14:44.720
49 percent of the k-8 population of wiseburn elementary was on interdistrict transfer

06:14:45.520 --> 06:14:51.600
something kind of new for us is the current covid pandemic that that we're current that we're in

06:14:53.680 --> 06:14:59.840
the state board members may have some angst about is this a good time to approve approve a territory

06:14:59.840 --> 06:15:08.880
transfer we don't see a lot of specifics that we can point to on this especially since when we look

06:15:08.880 --> 06:15:13.760
at the process that's going to have to be play play out if the state board allows the transfer to

06:15:13.760 --> 06:15:19.680
move forward there will be an election next year and then it won't go into effect until july 1st

06:15:19.680 --> 06:15:27.680
2022 so it's two years down the road before we'll actually see the transfer in terms of reasons the

06:15:27.680 --> 06:15:33.200
state board might consider to approve the transfer you know one thing we look at a lot is what the

06:15:33.200 --> 06:15:38.320
local folks have have already said there is a local determination the county committee has already

06:15:38.320 --> 06:15:46.960
approved this transfer the issue that the that the petitioners brought up is the transfer would

06:15:46.960 --> 06:15:53.520
ensure that choice block students have access to wiseburn charter schools that's not a real big

06:15:53.520 --> 06:16:02.000
issue for us because we don't see the territory transfer process as being a way to to for parents

06:16:02.000 --> 06:16:10.080
to choose what schools our kids go to and finally is there some community identity advantages to

06:16:10.080 --> 06:16:16.160
moving the territory into wiseburn we've shown these two maps already and they do highlight

06:16:16.160 --> 06:16:22.640
a number of community identity issues including the fact that the the area proposed for transfer

06:16:22.640 --> 06:16:28.640
is the only area of the dell era incorporated area that's not part of wiseburn and that there

06:16:28.640 --> 06:16:34.720
is a a shopping center a large shopping center that separates what the lawndale elementary school

06:16:34.720 --> 06:16:42.800
district from from the proposed transfer area so in terms of a quick review of the local actions

06:16:44.000 --> 06:16:47.040
the county committee they conducted all the required public hearings

06:16:47.840 --> 06:16:52.000
uh district reorganizations are processes under the california

06:16:52.000 --> 06:16:56.800
or projects under the california environmental quality act they completed that sequel process

06:16:56.800 --> 06:17:02.640
successfully they they considered all minimum threshold standards and found them substantially

06:17:02.640 --> 06:17:07.040
met as required by education code as i mentioned we agree with their findings

06:17:07.040 --> 06:17:09.040
and

06:17:11.920 --> 06:17:17.920
legislative intent exists in the education code about what we need to look at when it comes to

06:17:17.920 --> 06:17:22.800
approving a reorganization the statement there is that local educational needs and concerns

06:17:23.760 --> 06:17:29.360
shall serve as the basis for future reorganizations in our examination of the

06:17:29.360 --> 06:17:33.920
administrative record we find that the county committee did consider such needs and concerns

06:17:33.920 --> 06:17:39.440
we've mentioned some of the community identity issues as well as the concerns that county

06:17:39.440 --> 06:17:45.040
committee members had about permit students being treated differently than resident students

06:17:45.040 --> 06:17:49.600
it's our further opinion that the county committee is better positioned to determine

06:17:49.600 --> 06:17:53.280
local educational needs and concerns than than we are here at the state

06:17:55.360 --> 06:18:02.080
in summary we find that all minimum threshold conditions are substantially met we find no reason

06:18:02.080 --> 06:18:06.000
compelling enough to reverse the county committee's decision to approve the transfer

06:18:06.720 --> 06:18:12.240
and we're going to recommend that the as already been stated we recommend that the state board

06:18:12.240 --> 06:18:17.760
affirm the approval i'm going to skip this and just go into our recommendation

06:18:18.960 --> 06:18:24.640
we recommend that again that the state board affirm the county committee's action to approve

06:18:24.640 --> 06:18:31.280
the proposed post the proposed transfer of territory you're required to establish the

06:18:31.280 --> 06:18:39.120
territory that in which the election will be held if you do so we recommend that the election area

06:18:39.120 --> 06:18:44.880
be the default in statute which is just the area proposed for transfer we don't see any reasons

06:18:44.880 --> 06:18:52.160
substantial enough to expand the election area beyond the proposed transfer area there is also

06:18:52.160 --> 06:18:59.840
a default in terms of of how the property and funds and obligations of of of londale and

06:18:59.840 --> 06:19:08.640
sentinel valley will be divided if the territory transfer is approved given how small how minimal

06:19:08.640 --> 06:19:14.080
the number of students are and and the assessed valuation and the fact that these open enrollment

06:19:14.080 --> 06:19:20.000
agreements have been in place for a long time we don't believe that there should be any division

06:19:20.000 --> 06:19:26.720
of londale and sentinel valley's sentinel valley's property that's also a recommendation that the

06:19:26.720 --> 06:19:32.560
that laco made in presenting this to their county committee so if there are clarifying

06:19:32.560 --> 06:19:38.080
questions i can take them otherwise after the public hearing public comment i'll be here to

06:19:38.080 --> 06:19:40.160
respond to other questions

06:19:53.200 --> 06:19:54.560
i think linda's on mute

06:19:58.080 --> 06:20:04.000
talking to myself on mute uh thank you very much i don't see any clarifying questions

06:20:04.640 --> 06:20:10.960
so i'm going to open the public hearing at 4 25 pm first we will hear from the petitioners who

06:20:10.960 --> 06:20:16.240
are composed of the following three groups first the petitioners who live in the neighborhood to

06:20:16.240 --> 06:20:22.880
be transferred second the wiseburn usd district that is proposing to receive the territory

06:20:23.440 --> 06:20:28.160
and third the los angeles county office of education the petitioners district and county

06:20:29.120 --> 06:20:35.920

06:20:36.560 --> 06:20:41.280
union high school district the two districts that are i'm sorry union unified school district

06:20:41.280 --> 06:20:46.400
the two districts that are opposing the petition together those two districts will also have a total

06:20:46.400 --> 06:20:52.160
of 12 minutes after the presentations from both sides there will then be an opportunity for public

06:20:52.160 --> 06:20:57.200
comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each so we're going to

06:20:57.200 --> 06:21:06.240
begin with the petitioner presentation for 12 minutes take it away petitioners

06:21:18.880 --> 06:21:20.000
we see your screen

06:21:20.000 --> 06:21:26.000
so we're not yet hearing you thank you

06:21:27.840 --> 06:21:33.040
good afternoon i am shavonda weber christmas a chief petitioner for the wiseburn residents

06:21:33.040 --> 06:21:39.520
for wiseburn schools choice block petition we petition to transfer our area from the londale

06:21:39.520 --> 06:21:45.600
elementary school district and sentinel valley union high school district to the wiseburn

06:21:45.600 --> 06:21:52.080
unified school district it's unfortunate that our petition has come to this nevertheless it

06:21:52.080 --> 06:21:58.080
is a privilege to be before you today along with the many weighty issues and valiant issues that

06:21:58.080 --> 06:22:05.360
you all are dealing with but we are here to share our story here with me today are three other

06:22:05.360 --> 06:22:10.640
supporters from the community and the school district i will first turn it over to eddie

06:22:10.640 --> 06:22:17.280
urenda an active choice block resident watch leader and parent of a wiseburn unified school

06:22:17.280 --> 06:22:25.680
district permit student eddie thank you shavonda good evening board thank you for listening to us

06:22:25.680 --> 06:22:32.240
this evening i'll start by saying that the communities are are hard to form in suburban

06:22:32.240 --> 06:22:39.360
areas and especially in los angeles yet we formed one and i ask you to consider the commonalities

06:22:39.360 --> 06:22:46.960
that the choice blocks have with the wiseburn area in relation to the one that they may not

06:22:46.960 --> 06:22:54.160
have with londale elementary and sentinel valley first of all in terms of representation we are

06:22:54.960 --> 06:23:00.560
in an unincorporated area of los angeles and represented by a los angeles county supervisor

06:23:02.960 --> 06:23:08.800
in terms of protection we are served by the los angeles sheriff department for the entire area

06:23:10.080 --> 06:23:17.360
in terms of suffrage our voting is around county issues exclusive of the the school

06:23:17.360 --> 06:23:22.080
district issues we are served by a single neighborhood watch

06:23:24.480 --> 06:23:29.920
we also get a single newsletter that unifies the news for the school

06:23:29.920 --> 06:23:38.720
pool access and facilities to to the pool is a dotted line even though we're in 2020 today

06:23:39.760 --> 06:23:46.240
and full district students receive free access to the pool permanent students have a fee access

06:23:46.240 --> 06:23:54.800
to access the pool hard to believe in 2020 yet that is the case here we represent 406

06:23:55.600 --> 06:24:00.160
households out of the 1624 households in unincorporated los angeles area known as

06:24:00.160 --> 06:24:08.800
wiseburn and we share the common zip code of 90250 we're also served by a county library

06:24:08.800 --> 06:24:17.440
the aptly named the wiseburn county library this is the way that that we go to school

06:24:18.160 --> 06:24:26.160
um the choice block influence the boards that serve both the path and and the organizations

06:24:26.160 --> 06:24:31.920
that serve the school including the neighborhood watch the educational foundation and the national

06:24:31.920 --> 06:24:39.360
night out we have safety in numbers in terms of the paths that we walk to school four out of the

06:24:39.360 --> 06:24:46.640
five choice blocks are surrounded by a walking path and that that traversing of the 405 that's

06:24:46.640 --> 06:24:52.240
been mentioned as a security concern we have it's bookended by crossing guards that are present

06:24:52.240 --> 06:24:56.960
during school hours when school is in session during normal non-pandemic times of course

06:24:57.600 --> 06:25:03.200
that guarantees the safety to our children i live in the southernmost block of the choice blocks

06:25:03.200 --> 06:25:08.240
and i feel comfortable in that my children follow a designated walking path with crossing

06:25:08.320 --> 06:25:09.520
guards to access school

06:25:12.080 --> 06:25:19.040
the last four blocks are no for no further away than than the choice blocks are from the wiseburn

06:25:19.040 --> 06:25:26.640
schools again the low accident numbers over the past years we've had three accidents

06:25:28.320 --> 06:25:34.080
over the past three years as opposed to 246 accidents over the past three years

06:25:35.040 --> 06:25:41.520
crossing rosecrans boulevard a major thoroughfare that is 28 miles in length traversing east to

06:25:41.520 --> 06:25:48.400
westbound los angeles county and an important separator between the choice blocks and the

06:25:48.400 --> 06:25:56.560
lawndale school district so i'm going to pass on my the speaking time over to shavonda i was going

06:25:56.560 --> 06:26:02.160
to talk a little bit about equity and suffrage for the choice blocks shavonda

06:26:07.040 --> 06:26:14.800
shavonda you're on mute thank you can you take yourself off mute there we go

06:26:16.400 --> 06:26:20.400
it is true that the choice blocks have a lot in common with their neighbors

06:26:20.400 --> 06:26:27.040
but being a wise man residence has its own privileges um this little girl anaya here on

06:26:27.040 --> 06:26:33.280
the top right of your screen she's very excited and likes what she sees she just can't wait to

06:26:33.280 --> 06:26:37.280
get into these schools that are right down the street from her neighbor from her home

06:26:38.080 --> 06:26:42.080
she's guaranteed services she thinks she's guaranteed services like early start

06:26:42.800 --> 06:26:50.400
walk-in enrollment for kindergarten and if her family moves in even if she's fourth grade or

06:26:50.400 --> 06:26:56.960
fifth grade she automatically gets a seat and best of all there's a pool at the high school that's

06:26:56.960 --> 06:27:03.600
open to wiseburn and el segundo city residents through a special partnership and there's other

06:27:03.600 --> 06:27:09.040
exclusive partnerships that davinci garners like free college that mom and dad really like

06:27:09.920 --> 06:27:17.200
certainly on her on our minds today is suffrage and our ability to vote for not to mention to

06:27:17.200 --> 06:27:25.440
run for the school board of our own community unfortunately anaya is a choice block kid

06:27:26.800 --> 06:27:33.440
just like little jacob here and all the excitement begins to turn to fear

06:27:34.080 --> 06:27:38.560
when mom and dad are told oh sorry you're at the wrong school

06:27:40.480 --> 06:27:47.360
lesd is then slow to release your child on the permit or they simply deny it

06:27:47.360 --> 06:27:54.000
to cause more red tape and then when it's too late to get into wiseburn you hear well maybe

06:27:54.880 --> 06:27:58.720
next year maybe third grade maybe when they get to middle school

06:27:59.120 --> 06:28:04.720
so parents are stuck and have to search many alternatives to try to figure out and while

06:28:04.720 --> 06:28:10.560
they're doing that jacob here is saying excuse me sir um this isn't fun

06:28:12.960 --> 06:28:19.040
now this is not just a cute little story my neighbors and i have been living this narrative

06:28:19.040 --> 06:28:27.520
collectively for more than 35 years it's real the notion of open enrollment however is not real

06:28:27.520 --> 06:28:35.360
it just sounds good londell has not proactively reached out to the choice block residents to give

06:28:35.360 --> 06:28:43.280
us a choice or even promote their school but we the people have made our choice clear we want

06:28:43.280 --> 06:28:53.360
wiseburn school wiseburn unified however is in demand in 2018-19 more than 10 permit requests

06:28:54.320 --> 06:28:59.280
were unfulfilled part of the reason is because there's more school-aged families

06:28:59.280 --> 06:29:06.240
moving into the district as our seniors move out there are new developments like fusion and 360

06:29:06.240 --> 06:29:12.320
complexes bell south apartments they're havens for young families and they're taking their

06:29:12.320 --> 06:29:20.720
rightful seats in wiseburn schools in addition there are restrictions that prevent wiseburn

06:29:20.720 --> 06:29:27.920
from accepting students into the local district from local districts like londell sentinella

06:29:27.920 --> 06:29:40.000
hawthorne so we understand that londell wants you to block our petition but honestly if you do this

06:29:40.000 --> 06:29:47.200
might be the last chance that we get into the lawn into the wiseburn schools londell wants you

06:29:47.200 --> 06:29:55.120
to believe that 100 students will bankrupt their district their appeal claimed that

06:29:56.080 --> 06:30:02.400
this would be very costly for them it would be very costly for cv usd and that it would be costly

06:30:02.400 --> 06:30:11.280
for the residents but the real story for this actually was a nice story it was about children

06:30:11.280 --> 06:30:16.000
helping other children but the story that you see right here it just won't fly

06:30:17.360 --> 06:30:23.840
i urge you to find out what's really going on ask them what percentage londell residents really

06:30:23.840 --> 06:30:31.040
attend i probably consider that number low what percent of non-choice block residents permit out

06:30:31.040 --> 06:30:37.360
or never show up that's probably pretty high what proactive steps are taken to fill the seat

06:30:38.320 --> 06:30:41.520
well we don't see any they're not coming to our doors probably few

06:30:43.920 --> 06:30:52.800
so we also want to urge you not to get caught up in their black box trap you know they tell us that

06:30:52.800 --> 06:30:57.280
the assessed valuation is unknown the bond obligation is really high and that they're going

06:30:57.280 --> 06:31:03.440
to get stuck you can eliminate that speculation there are experts who have in the materials that

06:31:03.680 --> 06:31:09.520
you have before you decided exactly what the assessed valuation is what the obligations are

06:31:10.320 --> 06:31:21.120
and they can once again confirm the negligible cost of these um of the area simple logic will

06:31:21.120 --> 06:31:28.480
conclude that fewer than one percent of their district being moved away and even 0.5 percent

06:31:28.480 --> 06:31:33.680
of sentinela valleys district is not going to deplete these bonds that we've been paying for

06:31:34.560 --> 06:31:41.920
all of the children's education in this area is worth far more than that anyway so state board

06:31:41.920 --> 06:31:47.600
members i implore you please read between the lines listen to what you're really hearing and

06:31:47.600 --> 06:31:53.120
support the recommendation of the california department of education affirm the county committee

06:31:53.680 --> 06:31:59.280
on school district organization in la county that approved the choice blocks transfer to

06:31:59.840 --> 06:32:04.800
wise burn unified school district and designate an equitable voting area within

06:32:05.360 --> 06:32:07.360
the wise burn unified school district

06:32:09.520 --> 06:32:13.840
at this point before we close i just want you to hear from some of our biggest supporters

06:32:14.640 --> 06:32:21.680
wise burn officials mr banuelos part of the wise burn board of trustees

06:32:21.680 --> 06:32:30.560
and dr silver is the superintendent mr brown welles thank you shavonda good afternoon members

of the board of education i am roger banuelos i am currently a wise burn unified school district

06:32:36.240 --> 06:32:42.240
board trustee um i have served in this capacity for 11 years as a trustee of the wise burn unified

06:32:42.240 --> 06:32:47.920
school district i have had the privilege and opportunity to make many and several presentations

06:32:47.920 --> 06:32:54.480
to the county committee and and and district organization as well as to our our overall

06:32:54.480 --> 06:33:01.360
community which does include the choice blocks i have done so in the capacity of board president

06:33:01.360 --> 06:33:08.240
of vice president and board member in addition in that period of time as a resident of the area

06:33:08.240 --> 06:33:15.680
over the last 20 years having lived within holly glenn and in wise burn del air community i have

06:33:15.680 --> 06:33:22.720
seen that in this with regards to the petition what i have seen is that what it really comes

06:33:22.720 --> 06:33:31.680
down to is how a segment of our community lives and learns in these schools the the the students

06:33:32.400 --> 06:33:38.240
that live in the choice blocks attend the same classrooms they play in the very same fields that

06:33:38.240 --> 06:33:43.120
my kids have played in in the school district whether it's baseball softball

06:33:44.560 --> 06:33:50.320
baseball or softball and we would really encourage that the committee affirm the

06:33:50.320 --> 06:33:55.360
recommendation by dde further for the inclusion of the choice blocks thank you

06:33:59.600 --> 06:34:04.640
now we will move to the um opposing district presentation

06:34:08.240 --> 06:34:10.640
um

06:34:20.400 --> 06:34:27.360
hi good afternoon my name is bill schafer i'm a partner with rutan and tucker i and dr betsy

06:34:27.360 --> 06:34:32.720
hamilton superintendent wandell elementary school district will speak on behalf of the wandell

06:34:32.800 --> 06:34:39.280
school district wandell requests that the state board of education exercise its independent

06:34:39.280 --> 06:34:45.520
review and judgment of this matter grant the appeal of wandell and disapprove the territory

06:34:45.520 --> 06:34:51.920
transfer petition transferring the choice blocks area from wandell to wise burn there is no

06:34:51.920 --> 06:34:58.400
compelling reason for the territory transfer however if the petition is approved the election

06:34:58.400 --> 06:35:03.600
area should be for all residents of wandell the remaining property owners will have their property

06:35:03.600 --> 06:35:10.960
tax increased by 3.5 percent 3.55 according to the expert evidence that's in the record

06:35:10.960 --> 06:35:15.280
and the quality of the educational programs for the remaining students will be diminished

06:35:16.480 --> 06:35:20.720
the territory in question has been part of the wandell elementary school district

06:35:20.720 --> 06:35:26.480
since 1909 for several decades wandell and wise burn have allowed parents residing in

06:35:26.480 --> 06:35:32.960
the territory in question to choose which desk district to send their children we invite the

06:35:32.960 --> 06:35:38.160
board's attention to several of the conclusions reached by the county committee staff feasibility

06:35:38.160 --> 06:35:46.400
report of july 1st 2016 on page 11 of the staff report the county committee staff concludes the

06:35:46.400 --> 06:35:51.360
chief petitioners have not made any credible challenges to the outstanding quality of the

06:35:51.360 --> 06:35:57.040
educational programs at the wandell school district petitions to transfer territory are

06:35:57.040 --> 06:36:02.160
requests for change to permanent boundaries they should only be undertaken based on evidence of a

06:36:02.160 --> 06:36:08.560
compelling reason to make such changes no such compelling reason has been presented in this case

06:36:08.560 --> 06:36:13.440
that cannot be mitigated by current collaborative practices of the districts in question

06:36:13.440 --> 06:36:19.360
specifically in the offering of permits we submit as found by the county committee

06:36:19.360 --> 06:36:25.440
wandell provides an outstanding quality of education this critical fact in and of itself

06:36:25.440 --> 06:36:32.240
should control the outcome of the appeal cde's analysis of page 27 also finds no compelling

06:36:32.240 --> 06:36:38.240
reasons to transfer the choice blocks from wandell esd and sentinela valley union high

06:36:38.240 --> 06:36:45.120
school district to wise burn cde further finds on page 28 that the petitioners desire to gain

06:36:45.120 --> 06:36:50.480
an advantage in enrolling their students at the wise burn usd charter high schools is not a

06:36:50.480 --> 06:36:57.520
compelling reason for a territory transfer second the county committee staff recommends on page 21

06:36:57.520 --> 06:37:03.280
of their report that the petition be denied because access is already assured by the districts and

06:37:03.280 --> 06:37:09.280
the uncertain fiscal impact on the districts should the transfer be approved this was back in 2016

06:37:09.920 --> 06:37:14.960
regarding the fiscal impact cde states in relevant part it's in in its analysis

06:37:14.960 --> 06:37:21.680
on pages 23 to 24 the cde does caution that the current fiscal outlook of the state

06:37:21.680 --> 06:37:26.720
as well as the affected districts is unknown and potentially very troublesome

06:37:26.720 --> 06:37:34.080
due to covid the covid 19 pandemic cd further observed on page 26 of its analysis

06:37:34.720 --> 06:37:40.560
the current covid 19 pandemic may have created a fiscal and educational environment that currently

06:37:40.560 --> 06:37:47.600
is not conducive for changing school district boundaries cd continues in this discussion of

06:37:47.600 --> 06:37:54.720
covid 19 on page 27 public education in california is currently suffering due to the ongoing covid

06:37:54.720 --> 06:38:01.280
19 pandemic future impacts on school districts regarding funding staffing instructional planning

06:38:01.280 --> 06:38:07.600
and delivery and facility usage are unknown at this point the cbe may consider that a change

06:38:07.600 --> 06:38:12.480
to school district boundaries a resultant effect on funding and student attendance

06:38:12.480 --> 06:38:18.240
no matter how minimal is unwarranted in the current environment again although some negative

06:38:18.240 --> 06:38:23.280
effects due to covid 19 on the educational programs and fiscal status of every school

06:38:23.280 --> 06:38:30.480
in the state are likely londale fully expects that covid 19 will have a material and negative

06:38:30.480 --> 06:38:35.920
impact on londale's finances in view of londale's outstanding educational program

06:38:36.560 --> 06:38:42.800
this is not the time for boundary change thank you dr besie hamilton the londale superintendent

06:38:42.800 --> 06:38:46.960
will now speak

06:38:51.360 --> 06:38:57.840
good evening thank you for listening to our concerns this evening the transfer of territory

06:38:57.840 --> 06:39:02.560
proposed by the petitioners would permanently remove students who currently reside within the

06:39:02.560 --> 06:39:09.600
londale boundaries and as is mentioned previously would result in a potential loss of up to 1.3

06:39:09.600 --> 06:39:14.240
million depending on the numbers of students in the area a number of the students residing

06:39:14.240 --> 06:39:18.240
in the choice blocks already attend wiseburn schools under the long-standing agreement of

06:39:18.240 --> 06:39:22.880
the districts and i would hope that those agreements would continue but i do not have

06:39:23.280 --> 06:39:29.280
a current agreement with the with the district a number of transfers is set the number of transfers

06:39:29.280 --> 06:39:34.400
is subject to change in any given year based on parental choice once the boundary is changed

06:39:34.400 --> 06:39:40.560
there will be no choice and all students would become wiseborn students many districts including

06:39:40.560 --> 06:39:45.120
londale are experiencing a significant loss in enrollment due to the pandemic and the

06:39:45.120 --> 06:39:50.640
resulting economic crisis if this transfer were approved it would further exacerbate the economic

06:39:50.640 --> 06:39:57.440
status of londale only two of the 12 south bay selpa districts are not experiencing significant

06:39:57.440 --> 06:40:03.360
drops in enrollment and wiseburn is one of those fortunate districts due to the pandemic homelessness

06:40:03.360 --> 06:40:09.680
and poverty have increased in londale and the district enrollment is already 200 students below

06:40:09.680 --> 06:40:15.200
our projections this will require budget and staff reductions and a loss of the choice block area

06:40:15.280 --> 06:40:22.000
would further cripple londale's ability to provide a quality education the permanent loss of students

06:40:22.000 --> 06:40:27.040
would have a tremendous impact on critically needed funding the effect of such a significant

06:40:27.040 --> 06:40:32.560
revenue loss would be further aggravated by operation of the lcff funding model itself

06:40:33.360 --> 06:40:38.960
much of londale's lcff revenue funding is principally directed in l cap to providing new or

06:40:38.960 --> 06:40:45.680
improved services to students socioeconomically disadvantaged el and foster youth and with the

06:40:45.680 --> 06:40:51.120
advent of this revenue which is an equity model of funding several londale programs have been added

06:40:51.120 --> 06:40:56.480
or enhanced such programs would likely be cut or curtailed should the district suffer a loss of

06:40:56.480 --> 06:41:01.680
revenue due to the choice block transfer these programs provide significant support in the

06:41:01.680 --> 06:41:08.080
community with nearly 90 percent of its students living in poverty improved programs and services

06:41:08.080 --> 06:41:13.280
include all-day kindergarten classes and reduced class sizes in kindergarten through third grade

06:41:13.280 --> 06:41:18.160
teacher coaches and language arts and mathematics english learner instructional resource specialists

06:41:18.160 --> 06:41:23.600
to provide support for english learners social workers and community liaisons at every school

06:41:23.600 --> 06:41:28.400
providing student and family counseling and greater parent engagement in londale schools

06:41:28.400 --> 06:41:33.920
increased hours of operation in londale school libraries increased technology in londale's

06:41:33.920 --> 06:41:39.440
classrooms and these resources and supports have improved student outcomes significantly

06:41:40.080 --> 06:41:45.520
the usc soul prize center for innovation has recognized londale for two consecutive years

06:41:45.520 --> 06:41:50.400
for closing achievement gaps for african american latino and english learner students

06:41:50.960 --> 06:41:56.800
a territory transfer would jeopardize these successes the loss in revenue caused by the

06:41:56.800 --> 06:42:01.680
loss of students in this area would have an immediate adverse impact on all of londale students

06:42:02.400 --> 06:42:08.640
the resulting impact impact would be increase in class sizes reduction to elective programs such

06:42:08.640 --> 06:42:14.800
as art music and foreign language fewer classified staff to support campus cleanliness and safety

06:42:14.800 --> 06:42:20.240
fewer counselors and social workers to support students emotional well-being and reduced access

06:42:20.240 --> 06:42:26.320
to school libraries londale is already a distinct disadvantage in bonding capacity when compared to

06:42:26.960 --> 06:42:33.200
other local districts londale is largely residential and thus can can access fewer funds

06:42:33.200 --> 06:42:39.120
to provide upgraded facilities for our students the loss of this land area is estimated to reduce

06:42:39.120 --> 06:42:45.520
the ability to access approximately 750 000 additional dollars to improve facilities for

06:42:45.520 --> 06:42:52.720
our students we respectfully request the state board of education disapprove the territory transfer

06:42:53.440 --> 06:42:59.440
but if approved establish the election area to be all residents of londale elementary school

06:42:59.440 --> 06:43:05.440
district our parents deserve a voice in the future of their children's education thank you very much

06:43:05.440 --> 06:43:11.440
for your attention to this matter and consideration of our appeal i would like to introduce dr gregory

06:43:11.440 --> 06:43:16.000
o'brien superintendent of the sentinel valley union high school district thank you

06:43:16.560 --> 06:43:21.520
thank you president darling hammond esteemed members of the board and members of the audience

06:43:22.080 --> 06:43:26.640
i have been the superintendent of sentinel valley union high school district for the past five and

06:43:26.640 --> 06:43:33.120
a half years i'd like to make just a few brief comments as you consider this petition i would

06:43:33.120 --> 06:43:38.960
ask that you use an equity lens to consider whether this change would make the educational

06:43:38.960 --> 06:43:44.720
system more equitable for the students that are most at promise in our community

06:43:45.200 --> 06:43:50.960
community the california school dashboard shows that both sentinel valley and londale have

06:43:50.960 --> 06:43:57.360
significantly higher counts of students who are socioeconomically disadvantaged english learner

06:43:57.360 --> 06:44:03.520
and foster youth than wiseburn and davinci charter schools i understand the arguments made by those

06:44:03.520 --> 06:44:09.280
presenting their petition today wiseburn and davinci are doing great things for students

06:44:09.360 --> 06:44:15.440
and they are respected partners of ours in the south bay however i cannot support the changing

06:44:15.440 --> 06:44:21.920
of long-standing school boundaries for the reasons they have put forward the potential loss of any

06:44:21.920 --> 06:44:28.640
ada and bonding capacity will have a direct impact on our at promise students sentinel valley has

06:44:28.640 --> 06:44:34.000
worked hard to transform our district and we have 21st century projects that have been completed

06:44:34.000 --> 06:44:38.640
recently and i'll give you two of the most important changes that we've seen with regards

06:44:38.640 --> 06:44:44.080
to instruction on march 18th of this year we were able to immediately begin distance learning

06:44:44.080 --> 06:44:49.360
because 100 percent of our students already had district chromebooks and internet connectivity

06:44:49.920 --> 06:44:54.400
why because four years ago we began a forward-thinking systemic digital learning

06:44:54.400 --> 06:44:59.040
initiative where every incoming freshman received chromebook and access to the internet

06:44:59.600 --> 06:45:04.560
secondly graduation rates are on the rise all three of our comprehensive high schools have

06:45:04.560 --> 06:45:10.240
graduation rates above 90 and that includes our hispanic and african-american subgroups

06:45:10.960 --> 06:45:17.200
we believe that if the petitioners truly want to improve the education for students we invite them

06:45:17.200 --> 06:45:24.080
to join us as we continue our transformation rather than try to break away additionally if you

06:45:24.080 --> 06:45:31.120
support this proposal today what would stop any other group from doing the same as gentrification

06:45:31.120 --> 06:45:37.920
occurs in our area will it be acceptable for new areas to request they join the higher ses school

06:45:37.920 --> 06:45:45.120
districts as well for identification issues in closing homeowners know the district and the

06:45:45.120 --> 06:45:50.800
school district for which they are buying into i ask that you please respect the historic boundaries

06:45:50.800 --> 06:45:58.000
of both londale and sentinel valley and deny the petitioners request we need your support in our

06:45:58.000 --> 06:46:04.560
efforts to eliminate achievement gaps and create a more equitable community for all students we do

06:46:04.560 --> 06:46:10.320
not see any benefits to the students and families in the greater community if this petition is

06:46:10.320 --> 06:46:22.400
approved thank you for your consideration thank you so at this point the public comment slide

06:46:22.400 --> 06:46:30.320
should go up and we'll open the phone line for the public comment queue and while we're waiting

06:46:30.320 --> 06:46:35.360
for members of the public to call in i want to ask matt navo our liaison if he has any initial

06:46:35.360 --> 06:46:43.520
comments then if there are clarifying questions we can take those and we'll get to public comment

06:46:43.520 --> 06:46:50.400
as quickly as possible sure sure you want some just some brief thoughts before we go

06:46:50.400 --> 06:46:57.520
your framing comments yes please yeah i'll so although i typically have very strong opinions

06:46:57.520 --> 06:47:01.840
regarding district reorganization and this is one of those because the timing is really

06:47:02.640 --> 06:47:06.560
tough for londale i think there's a number of clarifying questions that

06:47:08.560 --> 06:47:15.520
need to be asked before we can settle on landing on a secure decision but at this point i can't

06:47:15.520 --> 06:47:21.200
help but recognize the unique realities that these districts have the unique past history

06:47:21.200 --> 06:47:28.000
that they have the reality of the choice blocks and the del air situation that it creates for

06:47:28.000 --> 06:47:33.360
the community members that wish to transfer and i can't help deny the fact that we've had

06:47:34.160 --> 06:47:42.480
the local county approve and we've had cde review and affirm so with that being said i'm very curious

06:47:42.480 --> 06:47:50.960
as to what the public comment will be around this okay are there any brief clarifying questions

06:47:50.960 --> 06:47:54.800
at this point from the board members before we go to public comment

06:47:57.040 --> 06:48:00.560
okay hearing none then we're going to go ahead and start public comment

06:48:03.200 --> 06:48:09.120
yes currently we have four speakers just quick reminder that this is for item six

06:48:09.680 --> 06:48:17.360

06:48:24.400 --> 06:48:34.640
record hello yes you're you're live okay thank you thank you uh my name is dr blake silver

06:48:34.640 --> 06:48:38.160
is the superintendent of the wiseburn unified school district i wasn't able to get a chance

06:48:38.160 --> 06:48:42.800
to speak publicly but i just want to start off by stating wiseburn has great respect

06:48:42.800 --> 06:48:47.600
for lawndale school district sentinel la vali union high school district the boards the staff

06:48:47.600 --> 06:48:52.240
and the community they really do a great job to educate their students this choice block petition

06:48:52.240 --> 06:48:57.200
is largely based on the sense of community that the residents in the area feel for wiseburn and

06:48:57.200 --> 06:49:02.000
i must say the feeling is mutual it's not about an issue that's grounded in educational offerings

06:49:02.000 --> 06:49:08.080
or experience but it's a shared sense of community i note that the 406 parcels in wiseburn area

06:49:08.480 --> 06:49:13.920
wiseburn area residences that are not included i'm sorry i i note that these 406 parcels in

06:49:13.920 --> 06:49:18.880
the choice blocks are not included in wiseburn unified school district and they're the only

06:49:18.880 --> 06:49:25.200
parcels in the dell air wiseburn area that are not of the estimated 200 or so students 95 attend

06:49:25.200 --> 06:49:31.600
wiseburn usd already in 1920 and it's consistently been in the 80s and 90s i want to share that

06:49:31.600 --> 06:49:37.840
wiseburn remains committed to school choice and would honor any residents to transfer

06:49:37.840 --> 06:49:44.640
thank thank you thank you thank you to the board next speaker please state your name

06:49:44.640 --> 06:49:47.520
and affiliation for the record your time starts now

06:49:50.560 --> 06:49:58.160
my name is maria acosta i am a wiseburn resident for wiseburn schools my child is currently in the

06:49:58.160 --> 06:50:06.800
seventh grade our family supports the transfer of the what is designated as the choice blocks

06:50:07.760 --> 06:50:13.040
into the wiseburn unified school district we participate in a variety of activities

06:50:13.840 --> 06:50:22.480
within our community including the wiseburn watch the national night out you know all the

06:50:22.480 --> 06:50:28.400
santa parade you know all these community activities and events and unfortunately those

06:50:28.400 --> 06:50:34.560
residents that live in those choice blocks do not feel fully integrated into our community

06:50:34.560 --> 06:50:40.560
because they have to jump through hoops to petition to be a part of our school district

06:50:40.560 --> 06:50:48.400
so i would like for that the board to consider transferring those 406 households

06:50:48.400 --> 06:50:51.920
into the wiseburn unified school district thank you so much for your time

06:50:52.480 --> 06:50:58.960
thank you speaker next speaker please speak your name and affiliation for the record your time

06:50:58.960 --> 06:51:08.960
starts now yes speaker we can barely hear you are you still with us

06:51:09.600 --> 06:51:21.200
yes i'm the next one chris tory yes fabulous i live in the choice blocks and wiseburn school

06:51:21.200 --> 06:51:26.960
district and like other speakers we're very active in the community and the sports and the kids

06:51:26.960 --> 06:51:34.240
programs and santa and all such i'm pointing out that not it's a gentleman's agreement to be

06:51:34.240 --> 06:51:41.920
released because my child was not given a permit released the first time through we walked into

06:51:41.920 --> 06:51:47.600
what londell school district and they said we're sorry we do not release white children because

06:51:47.600 --> 06:51:54.640
you are statistically and demographically significant and it really did take quite some

06:51:54.640 --> 06:52:02.720
hoops to get him released so i'm just pointing out there are situations where they do not honor

06:52:03.280 --> 06:52:12.880
always having somebody released thank you caller next caller please state your name and affiliation

06:52:12.880 --> 06:52:21.120
for the record your time starts now yes hello my name is michael johnson i live in the dell air

06:52:21.120 --> 06:52:27.920
district and i'd like for you guys to please consider transferring the choice blocks over

06:52:28.400 --> 06:52:33.600
wiseburn district it seems unfair that our tax dollars are going to a school district

06:52:34.240 --> 06:52:38.240
and then we petition our children into wiseburn that means that our tax dollars

06:52:38.240 --> 06:52:42.400
are going towards londale and they're not helping our children in their education in the future

06:52:44.400 --> 06:52:47.680
doesn't seem conducive to the community

06:52:50.400 --> 06:52:56.640
thank you caller thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record

06:52:56.640 --> 06:52:58.160
your time starts now

06:53:03.760 --> 06:53:04.800
caller are you there

06:53:08.000 --> 06:53:12.960
good afternoon my name is tom johnstone and i am the retired superintendent of wiseburn

06:53:12.960 --> 06:53:18.000
and i will comment on community identity as the appeal documents indicate choice block

06:53:18.000 --> 06:53:24.240
residents have been waiting to resolve this issue for over 50 years giving that schools are a hub

06:53:24.240 --> 06:53:29.760
for the community while choice block residents are a part of the wiseburn community they also

06:53:29.760 --> 06:53:36.480
face a tremendous gap namely wiseburn school and they refer to themselves as the orphan blocks

06:53:36.480 --> 06:53:42.240
in 2008 choice block residents were poised to file a petition with the county committee this

06:53:42.240 --> 06:53:47.280
action would have derailed the larger wiseburn unification effort that was already in its seventh

06:53:47.280 --> 06:53:53.920
year so one of my first acts as superintendent i asked them to stand down they unselfishly agreed

06:53:53.920 --> 06:53:58.480
to postpone their petition with an assurance from londale and wiseburn that their children

06:53:58.480 --> 06:54:04.400
could attend wiseburn schools the result was a formal choice block agreement there was never

06:54:04.400 --> 06:54:11.120
any mention verbally or in writing that this was a long-term or perpetual time it was always a time

06:54:11.120 --> 06:54:20.080
thank you caller next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

06:54:20.080 --> 06:54:22.240
now

06:54:22.800 --> 06:54:26.960
hello i'm neil goldman a wiseburn governing board member in support of the choice blocks

06:54:26.960 --> 06:54:30.720
in reading londale's appeal i'd like to quickly address what paul harvey years ago might have

06:54:30.720 --> 06:54:35.680
called the rest of the story as to the revenue picture two significant components were omitted

06:54:35.680 --> 06:54:39.440
first londale's argument of the loss of students and revenues was exaggerated

06:54:39.440 --> 06:54:44.800
londale's appeal notes the potential loss of all 131 students each year but the rest of the story

06:54:44.880 --> 06:54:49.520
in the year of their appeal 91 of those students or 70 percent chose wiseburn

06:54:49.520 --> 06:54:55.200
last year 95 students dramatically mitigating any loss and this consistently stays the same

06:54:55.200 --> 06:54:59.040
second on the revenue side they conveniently omitted the roughly one and a half million

06:54:59.040 --> 06:55:03.840
dollars they receive annually largely because of wiseburn for measure cl the parcel tax

06:55:03.840 --> 06:55:08.800
with a large proportion paid for by the commercial tax base in wiseburn in summary please consider

06:55:08.800 --> 06:55:12.720
the whole story in your review choice block residents have repeatedly sought this action

06:55:12.720 --> 06:55:18.880
for over 50 years please affirm the la county committee ruling and allow these residents local

06:55:18.880 --> 06:55:26.480
self-determination thank you thank you caller next caller please state your name and affiliation

06:55:26.480 --> 06:55:34.480
for the record your time starts now hi this is jessica dordy and i live in the wiseburn area

06:55:34.480 --> 06:55:39.920
not in the choice blocks but my students and my children they play with kids from the choice

06:55:39.920 --> 06:55:45.840
blocks those students and families are part of our district all the potential reasons to disapprove

06:55:45.840 --> 06:55:51.360
the transfer have nothing to do with quite frankly what is best for students and the most compelling

06:55:51.360 --> 06:55:57.760
reason of all is to do what is best for students which is allow them into this district the only

06:55:57.760 --> 06:56:03.120
unifying factor of our district of our area since we are mostly in an unincorporated la county area

06:56:03.120 --> 06:56:09.200
is the school district we live together we communicate together we drive and walk to school

06:56:09.200 --> 06:56:15.040
together it is quite frankly undemocratic to allow these families a voice in their children's

06:56:15.040 --> 06:56:20.000
education a vote and who governs their schools and an opportunity to be full participants in

06:56:21.040 --> 06:56:25.200
in their children's education so thank you very much for your consideration

06:56:26.000 --> 06:56:33.120
thank you caller next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts

06:56:33.120 --> 06:56:36.240
now

06:56:37.440 --> 06:56:44.160
hello my name is carmen bird can you hear me yes please go ahead hi my name is carmen bird

06:56:46.080 --> 06:56:53.840
we are in the choice box and we are living in a family home and my grandmother was one of the

06:56:53.920 --> 06:57:05.360
first people to be affected by the separation at 80 years old marjorie bird told me the story of

06:57:05.360 --> 06:57:09.440
being denied being able to get on the little school bus that would take her to her school in

06:57:09.440 --> 06:57:18.880
wiseburn because she lived basically just right outside the boundary and she told me the story

06:57:18.880 --> 06:57:26.400
when she was 80 so socially and emotionally it really did stick with her for the rest of her life

06:57:27.360 --> 06:57:35.040
so really what what um i'm worried most about is that we live in a village and it doesn't

06:57:35.040 --> 06:57:42.000
take a village to raise a child and emotionally time kids are a part of wiseburn time caller

06:57:42.000 --> 06:57:43.040
thank you so much

06:57:46.160 --> 06:57:51.280
next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now

06:57:54.000 --> 06:58:00.560
my name is chris maddox i'm a resident of the choice blocks in wiseburn it seems to me that

06:58:00.560 --> 06:58:06.080
what should be determinative in this issue is that california law says that there are nine

06:58:06.080 --> 06:58:10.240
thresholds that need to be met the county committee has already found that all nine of those

06:58:10.240 --> 06:58:15.840
thresholds have been substantially met further california law states that local governments

06:58:15.840 --> 06:58:20.160
are in the best position to determine whether or not there should be a transfer of school districts

06:58:20.160 --> 06:58:24.240
again that just gives further weight to the fact that the county committee has already decided that

06:58:24.240 --> 06:58:29.840
all nine thresholds have been substantially met and therefore their decision to approve the transfer

06:58:29.840 --> 06:58:35.440
should be affirmed and the appeal should be denied now looking towards the some of the arguments that

06:58:35.520 --> 06:58:40.320
the lawndale school district has made there's just no compelling or supportive sporting evidence

06:58:40.960 --> 06:58:47.280
to back up those claims first the covid claim this can't this will not go into effect until

06:58:47.280 --> 06:58:52.640
at the earliest 2022 which got helping this this pandemic will be long behind us

06:58:53.280 --> 06:58:58.800
second they talked about enrollment declining and lesb has been pointed out multiple times thank

06:58:58.800 --> 06:59:04.560
you very much thank you caller next caller please state your name and

06:59:04.560 --> 06:59:08.000

caller are you there

06:59:18.320 --> 06:59:21.600
okay this concludes public comment thank you for the calls

06:59:21.600 --> 06:59:35.360
of so i hereby close the public hearing given that there's no other public comment

06:59:36.080 --> 06:59:42.800
at 504 and we'll now begin board discussion board members you know please raise your hands

06:59:43.360 --> 06:59:50.160
and i don't know matt if you want to start us off with any further thoughts or we'll just open it

06:59:50.160 --> 07:00:00.560
up to those who have questions sure i'm happy to start good can you hear me yes okay so larry can

07:00:00.560 --> 07:00:08.480
i are you there larry i can ask you a couple clarifying questions yes i'm here so i understand

07:00:09.280 --> 07:00:19.040
the dilemma i've read and with great interest the 31 pages that were provided by cde and there's a

07:00:19.040 --> 07:00:26.320
couple of things that i just want to clarify the choice block that is in del air essentially under

07:00:26.320 --> 07:00:32.560
the current agreements 100 of those choice block students could go to wiseburn

07:00:34.800 --> 07:00:42.240
is that the correct understanding that has been what has been stated in during local

07:00:42.240 --> 07:00:46.800
county consideration of the issue you know i haven't seen anything in writing that would

07:00:46.800 --> 07:00:54.960
state that but that has been an impression that has been been relayed during local consideration

07:00:56.160 --> 07:01:02.880
okay so the and i heard several callers say that they attempted to transfer and they were denied

07:01:02.880 --> 07:01:08.720
but the reality is is that whatever this agreement is that that gives parameters to this choice block

07:01:08.720 --> 07:01:14.640
students can go to wiseburn or londale and there's an agreement between the districts that they can do

07:01:14.640 --> 07:01:20.480
that there there is there have been agreements for decades to allow students in this area to

07:01:20.480 --> 07:01:26.960
choose what district they want to attend okay how long ago did this process start

07:01:28.320 --> 07:01:36.960
um this particular territory transfer i think was started in 2014 or 15 right after the unification

07:01:37.600 --> 07:01:43.040
issue you know as you know it takes us a while we have some resource issues and it takes us a while

07:01:43.040 --> 07:01:50.800
to hear hear issues that come before the state board so this particular proposal started then

07:01:50.800 --> 07:01:58.720
as the superintendent of wiseburn indicated the community members started back in around 2008

07:01:58.720 --> 07:02:04.160
during the time that the wiseburn district was undergoing its 12-year process to unify

07:02:05.840 --> 07:02:11.760
as dr silver has indicated the superintendent at that time asked the community members to

07:02:11.840 --> 07:02:20.960
stand down or maybe get it and wait until the unification proposal was approved by the state

07:02:20.960 --> 07:02:32.160
board okay so this this started this is started some time ago and okay and if the state if the

07:02:32.160 --> 07:02:40.320
board was to delay this does that start all over um it doesn't start all over you don't have any

07:02:40.320 --> 07:02:48.000
timelines in terms of when you need to take action as kind of confirmed by the fact that

07:02:48.000 --> 07:02:55.040
we've had this here for four years it simply means that you put you move it down the road

07:02:55.040 --> 07:03:01.440
kick the can down the road and and deal with it at a different time you're only and it's term or

07:03:01.440 --> 07:03:06.400
or reverse you're not required as are the counties to do this do so in any time frame

07:03:06.400 --> 07:03:14.160
okay and the reality is is mad this is judy sias council for the board you would need to hold

07:03:14.160 --> 07:03:19.840
another public hearing though at that point if you chose to not take action at this time then

07:03:21.040 --> 07:03:24.400
the board would need to hold another public hearing and start the process over at this level

07:03:25.280 --> 07:03:29.920
yeah and that seems like a lot to ask being that they're two years away they have to go through

07:03:29.920 --> 07:03:36.320
an election so that that particular community is going to have to conduct an election in 2021

07:03:36.400 --> 07:03:43.840
to affirm the this decision from the county and the state board correct it's correct okay so

07:03:43.840 --> 07:03:49.120
they're two years away so financially things could be different although we're in a unique

07:03:49.120 --> 07:03:52.800
situation i agree with you in the sense that it could be different can you talk to me a little

07:03:52.800 --> 07:04:00.320
bit about the numbers that londale's proposing in terms of how it affects them i read in the

07:04:00.320 --> 07:04:08.160
the initial proposal there seems to be some disagreement in regards to how this financially

07:04:08.160 --> 07:04:14.000
affects them and those property owners that would remain in the londale school district as it

07:04:14.000 --> 07:04:21.600
pertains to the property taxes all right let's talk we'll talk first about about a state funding

07:04:21.600 --> 07:04:28.160
per student state funding right now there are 43 students in the choice block area that attend

07:04:28.160 --> 07:04:36.720
londale though londale talked about all 31 as a loss of some one point some million dollars

07:04:36.720 --> 07:04:42.640
the the actual you know in terms of the 43 students and the numbers would be closer to about

07:04:42.640 --> 07:04:50.160
four hundred and seventy thousand dollars if all those 43 students went to went to wiseburn after

07:04:50.160 --> 07:04:55.360
the transfer was complete you know i've been i i don't know how many territory transfers i've

07:04:55.360 --> 07:05:01.680
dealt with over the last three and a half decades i'm sure well over a hundred but what you find is

07:05:01.680 --> 07:05:07.360
that students who are attending a district like londale their territory is transferred to another

07:05:07.360 --> 07:05:14.400
district often many of those kids will are not particularly fond of the idea of leaving their

07:05:14.400 --> 07:05:20.640
colleagues they're not their colleagues but their classmates leaving their teachers so they get

07:05:20.720 --> 07:05:27.520
grandfathered in to the district that they had previously attended you know we can't say that

07:05:27.520 --> 07:05:33.760
for sure but certainly history has indicated that all 43 of those students will not transfer

07:05:33.760 --> 07:05:40.720
to wiseburn once the reorganization goes into effect so that you know if they do the total

07:05:40.720 --> 07:05:48.080
loss in lcff funding is about four hundred seventy thousand dollars regarding the assessed valuation

07:05:48.080 --> 07:05:57.920
issue the londale district indicated that the remaining residents of of londale would be on

07:05:57.920 --> 07:06:04.480
the hook to pay a greater share of property taxes i think they indicated that property taxes would

07:06:04.480 --> 07:06:11.280
go up 3.55 percent that's somewhat of a misleading statement because the only thing that would go up

07:06:11.280 --> 07:06:18.000
would be the the much smaller portion of the property tax that they're paying associated with

07:06:18.000 --> 07:06:26.160
with repaying governing bonds or general obligation bonds right now at the time they considered this

07:06:26.160 --> 07:06:34.800
at the local at the county level a property owner in a half a million dollar home a home that

07:06:34.880 --> 07:06:42.960
assessed that a half million dollars was paying about 217 dollars annually in to pay off the

07:06:42.960 --> 07:06:49.200
bonded indebtedness of londale three and a half percent is what about eight dollars annually so

07:06:49.200 --> 07:06:55.600
we didn't see that as a particularly significant increase of course there are additional bond

07:06:55.600 --> 07:07:01.680
measures that have been approved since the county made it take it take had taken its action but

07:07:01.680 --> 07:07:07.920
those are prop 39 bonds and they're capped in terms of how much you know thirty dollars i

07:07:07.920 --> 07:07:13.680
believe it is for a hundred hundred thousand dollars assessed valuation so uh you know the

07:07:13.680 --> 07:07:23.760
the voters have already have already agreed to uh up to that point so it's certainly things can

07:07:23.760 --> 07:07:31.040
change in terms of how how many of the uh the bonds are sold by the district over time um the

07:07:31.040 --> 07:07:37.040
more the more bonds that are sold the greater debt greater debt that's established and the

07:07:37.040 --> 07:07:45.280
higher the property tax uh associated with the repaying that debt go but as of right now

07:07:46.480 --> 07:07:52.320
you know we we don't see it affecting property owners of say a five hundred thousand dollar

07:07:52.320 --> 07:07:59.360
assessed value home by more than twelve dollars a year and the election practice in the past has

07:07:59.360 --> 07:08:06.640
been that those that are affected by the reorganization are those that vote it's not

07:08:06.640 --> 07:08:12.160
been the practice of in the past that it's extended to the entire district no uh you know there have

07:08:12.160 --> 07:08:17.760
been a lot of court cases looking at uh i'm not going to go into them but there have been a number

07:08:17.760 --> 07:08:24.320
of court cases looking at what it takes to expand the election area the education code provides a

07:08:24.320 --> 07:08:29.200
default election area of just the area proposed for reorganization which would be the choice blocks

07:08:29.840 --> 07:08:36.560
and typically uh you know we look at some substantial effect on the remaining

07:08:37.360 --> 07:08:42.800
lawndale residents if we're going to make a recommendation about expanding the election

07:08:42.880 --> 07:08:48.720
area to them so that you don't overwhelm the voters who are most affected by the by the action

07:08:48.720 --> 07:08:54.480
and those uh those substantial effects are basically in terms of pretty significant

07:08:54.480 --> 07:09:00.640
segregation issues or very significant fiscal issues we don't see okay here and that's why

07:09:00.640 --> 07:09:08.080
we're not recommending expansion of the election area okay i think larry thank you for um answering

07:09:08.080 --> 07:09:12.480
all those questions i i mean when it gets down to it i think what i'm hearing you say and what i read

07:09:12.960 --> 07:09:19.280
correct me if i'm wrong is um cd doesn't necessarily agree with the reasons for the petition

07:09:20.480 --> 07:09:27.200
but doesn't also see a substantial reason to disagree with the county committee's decision

07:09:27.200 --> 07:09:33.120
to support the petition for reorganization based on the reality that the county is better equipped

07:09:33.120 --> 07:09:38.240
than cde is to identify and understand the local factors supporting the district reorganization

07:09:38.240 --> 07:09:42.560
that's basically what it comes down to as i understand it that's correct you know we see a

07:09:42.560 --> 07:09:48.160
number of reasonable issues uh that the state board and the county committee could have considered

07:09:49.040 --> 07:09:55.600
we don't see any compelling reasons uh you know either way but okay the only thing that we're

07:09:55.600 --> 07:10:01.360
looking at is that there is a local decision out there and we uh we we pretty strongly believe

07:10:01.360 --> 07:10:07.520
that the local folks are in a much better position to to judge what the local conditions are than we

07:10:07.520 --> 07:10:14.320
are okay thank you uh board president i'm i'm i i larry's done a great job answering all my questions

07:10:14.320 --> 07:10:20.720
i'll make a motion but i am interested in hearing what other board members say well i appreciate you

07:10:20.720 --> 07:10:26.720
asking all of those very thoughtful questions which were very informative in terms of helping

07:10:26.720 --> 07:10:32.480
all of us understand the situation i'm not seeing any other hands raised at the moment is there any

07:10:32.480 --> 07:10:42.080
other um if there's no other uh desire oops i see cynthia's hand has gone up um go ahead cynthia

07:10:44.880 --> 07:10:50.640
you're on mute talking to yourself on mute okay thank you and i apologize i will make this very

07:10:50.640 --> 07:10:55.760
quick i just had a couple of clarification questions one was regarding the race and

07:10:55.760 --> 07:11:01.520
ethnicity the ethnicity of the students in the choice blocks i know we have the data for each

07:11:01.520 --> 07:11:07.840
of the districts but um do we have any information on the race and ethnicity breakdown

07:11:07.840 --> 07:11:14.800
of the students that are impacted in the choice blocks no no we don't we we did not get the

07:11:15.360 --> 07:11:22.240
that level of of the segregation of the racial ethnic demographics of the area

07:11:22.800 --> 07:11:28.560
they did not do that at the county either that's a that you know that's a time-consuming process to

07:11:28.560 --> 07:11:33.520
do that you know a resource intensity process and that's that's something that we did not that we

07:11:33.520 --> 07:11:42.400
did not focus on okay and one other question um as it relates to the number of permits requesting

07:11:42.400 --> 07:11:49.600
to uh move from either lawndale or sentinel to wiseburn do we have any information on

07:11:49.600 --> 07:11:57.760
how many uh what percentage of those permits are honored um you know that's different differing

07:11:57.760 --> 07:12:06.960
positions the lawndale has has reported both at the local level and and uh and and to us that

07:12:06.960 --> 07:12:13.600
they don't disapprove any of them uh the uh the residents of as you've heard in the public comment

07:12:13.600 --> 07:12:19.520
section um report that there have been some instances where they where their permits have

07:12:19.920 --> 07:12:28.800
been turned down so uh we we uh in terms of going back for a few years we did ask that question of

07:12:28.800 --> 07:12:34.960
the districts and you know again lawndale reported that uh when we asked the question specifically

07:12:34.960 --> 07:12:43.360
that they they approved all permits that were submitted to them okay thank you and and we haven't

07:12:43.360 --> 07:12:49.600
i hadn't heard any comments from any of the parents from either the lawndale or sentinel

07:12:49.600 --> 07:12:55.920
valley from what i can recall um i didn't know if either of the petitioners have any

07:12:56.720 --> 07:13:00.320
well actually there's no need to respond to that i just will make that as a statement

07:13:00.880 --> 07:13:08.880
thank you that's and i believe i had i was just going to say as a follow-up to that that's

07:13:08.880 --> 07:13:13.760
you know when you have these territory transfer proposals that are considered at the local level

07:13:14.800 --> 07:13:20.000
in public hearings the public hearings are going to be dominated by the people who live in the

07:13:20.000 --> 07:13:27.280
area it takes a unusual you don't hear from parents or residents of surrounding areas unless

07:13:27.280 --> 07:13:35.680
there's something that they believe is going to affect them greatly i was just going to note i

07:13:35.680 --> 07:13:40.080
don't know if this is responsive to your question cynthia but i believe in the petitioner's

07:13:40.080 --> 07:13:45.840
initial presentation there was reference to um the uncertainty that many people have experienced

07:13:45.840 --> 07:13:53.200
about whether they will have their requests approved and seemed as though that was an

07:13:53.200 --> 07:14:01.440
unpredictable event is how i heard it are there any other um questions

07:14:01.440 --> 07:14:05.200
all right matt i think we're ready for your um motion

07:14:08.400 --> 07:14:16.400
okay so i think given the fact that the in theory all of the the the students in the choice blocks

07:14:16.400 --> 07:14:23.200
those families could theoretically go to wiseburn should they choose i think that because you have

07:14:23.200 --> 07:14:28.240
the county committee that is closer to the experience and understand the historical issues

07:14:29.200 --> 07:14:35.920
issues with it with wiseburn and londale and sentinel valley and i think in regards to the

07:14:35.920 --> 07:14:41.840
reality that this is the last portion of the dell air community i'm going to recommend that

07:14:42.640 --> 07:14:46.880
we affirm the county committee's action so we're going to approve cd's recommendation

07:14:46.880 --> 07:14:50.240
affirm the county committee's action to approve the proposed transfer of territory

07:14:51.520 --> 07:14:56.880
use the established territory transfer as the election area and that we provide no division

07:14:56.880 --> 07:15:04.960
of funds and obligations do i have a second for that motion a second all right who was it who

07:15:04.960 --> 07:15:12.880

07:22:03.120 --> 07:22:09.040
school district to waive california education code section specific to statutory provisions

07:22:09.040 --> 07:22:15.440
for the lease of surplus property the cde is recommending approval with a set of conditions

07:22:15.440 --> 07:22:23.120
which we will be briefed on by wine morelos of the cde who is going to present this item

07:22:23.120 --> 07:22:31.760
um why are you there good evening madam president this is andrew nave n-4-1 morelos

07:22:32.880 --> 07:22:40.000
i'll be making the presentation tonight if that is okay sure um so with that madam president

07:22:40.000 --> 07:22:45.040
state superintendent and board members my name is andrew nave i am a manager in the school

07:22:45.040 --> 07:22:50.400
facilities and transportation services division and i will be doing a presentation tonight on

07:22:50.480 --> 07:22:55.760
waiver number four waiver number four is a request by the oakland unified school district

07:22:55.760 --> 07:23:02.000
to waive sections of the law that specify how surplus school sites are sold or leased

07:23:02.000 --> 07:23:08.240
specifically the district is requesting to waive certain provisions of statute that would otherwise

07:23:08.240 --> 07:23:15.200
require the district to go through a sealed bid process and select the highest bidder instead the

07:23:15.200 --> 07:23:21.200
district would like to use a request for proposal process that will provide the district more

07:23:21.200 --> 07:23:28.960
flexibility by allowing them to consider other factors besides cost this is generally a standard

07:23:28.960 --> 07:23:35.840
type of waiver request that frequently comes before this board and has historically been approved

07:23:35.840 --> 07:23:42.080
there are two properties in question one is known as the edward shands adult school and the other

07:23:42.080 --> 07:23:49.760
is the tillton child development center both of these properties have been closed since 2010

07:23:49.760 --> 07:23:55.680
and are not currently suitable for instructional use in their current condition it is important

07:23:55.680 --> 07:24:02.640
to note that oakland unified has received emergency loans and funding from the state to help stabilize

07:24:02.640 --> 07:24:09.200
their budget this funding is contingent upon the district establishing a consolidation plan

07:24:09.200 --> 07:24:16.480
that supports the sale or lease of surplus property the district did go through

07:24:17.440 --> 07:24:23.760
all steps prescribed in statute to declare both sites as surplus two of the bargaining units the

07:24:23.760 --> 07:24:31.680
oakland education association and service employees international union chapter 1021 have registered

07:24:31.760 --> 07:24:39.120
opposing positions to this waiver request the oea opposes the sale of the properties

07:24:39.120 --> 07:24:44.000
due to their belief the district lacks a comprehensive plan to utilize

07:24:44.000 --> 07:24:50.480
existing oakland unified facilities for their early childhood and adult education programs

07:24:51.360 --> 07:24:59.520
seiu 1021 seconds oea's opposition and they are concerned that the district will try and sell

07:24:59.520 --> 07:25:06.080
properties to address these concerns staff is recommending that the board approve

07:25:06.880 --> 07:25:14.720
the waiver request with two additional conditions one is that the district holds a public hearing

07:25:14.720 --> 07:25:19.920
where members of the public and the bargaining units can discuss possible uses of the surplus

07:25:19.920 --> 07:25:25.920
properties and their potential impacts on the respective communities the second condition

07:25:25.920 --> 07:25:32.640
is that the waiver only applies to the lease of these properties if the district decides to sell

07:25:32.640 --> 07:25:39.840
the properties without using the statutorily prescribed methodology another waiver request

07:25:39.840 --> 07:25:47.200
would be required with that cde recommends the board approve the waiver request and i am happy

07:25:47.200 --> 07:25:57.680
to answer any questions that you have all right um we will put the public comment slide back up

07:25:59.600 --> 07:26:03.440
so that the call-in number and the access code will be displayed

07:26:04.400 --> 07:26:07.520
so that we can open the phone line to the public comment queue

07:26:10.320 --> 07:26:15.520

07:26:15.520 --> 07:26:24.240
waiver liaison if she has any initial comments or framing for us well um thank you i want to commend

07:26:24.240 --> 07:26:30.640
the staff for the work that they've done both with the associations and reaching out and talking to

07:26:30.640 --> 07:26:36.160
them to try to understand exactly the concerns that were being raised in this process as well

07:26:36.160 --> 07:26:41.760
as the work they've been doing in the district to develop this waiver this matter is related to

07:26:41.760 --> 07:26:47.920
as you heard presented by the staff some other ongoing and separate work and agreements that

07:26:47.920 --> 07:26:54.480

grade class co-president san pedro senior high school gifted theme magnet a school in los angeles

07:31:49.440 --> 07:31:55.040
unified school district located in san pedro california i would like to publicly address

07:31:55.040 --> 07:31:59.360
the learning continuity and attendance plan it's my understanding that the plan will address the

07:31:59.360 --> 07:32:03.600
response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic i would like to state my concern with the lack of

07:32:03.600 --> 07:32:08.400
student input in the plan i am aware that the lcp is required to obtain feedback from stakeholders

07:32:08.400 --> 07:32:12.000
including students finding trouble by the lack of feedback received particularly from student

07:32:12.000 --> 07:32:15.280
demographics that we do not normally hear from such as students with children needs

07:32:16.640 --> 07:32:20.000
i do not feel that the feedback that was obtained in line with actions that will support students

07:32:20.000 --> 07:32:23.520
both in the classroom and during this learning i particularly worry about my fellow students

07:32:23.520 --> 07:32:27.440
with social needs English learners students and possibly students having access to support

07:32:27.440 --> 07:32:32.640
resources that they need during this learning and be successful must be able to voice our concerns

07:32:32.640 --> 07:32:36.400
our needs and our recommendations to make our school experience better while facing this pandemic

07:32:36.400 --> 07:32:40.320

next speaker please state your name and affiliation for the record and your time starts now

07:32:48.960 --> 07:32:54.960
hi good afternoon my name is Marianne Grosner and i would like to share some experiences of special

07:32:54.960 --> 07:32:59.600
needs families they are struggling with distance learning and many students are experiencing

07:32:59.600 --> 07:33:04.560
regression even though districts are starting to bring back the most vulnerable to in-person

07:33:04.560 --> 07:33:09.360
learning many are shocked to find that their mainstream child is no longer mainstreamed and

07:33:09.360 --> 07:33:14.800
fully secluded from their typical peers districts are radically changing IEPs

07:33:14.880 --> 07:33:20.560
some of these kids going to in-person learning are placed into virtual classes which makes absolutely

07:33:20.560 --> 07:33:26.720
no sense transportation has been removed from related services someone needs to step in and

07:33:26.720 --> 07:33:31.600
help the most vulnerable instead of putting them in seclusion and removing services i also wanted

07:33:31.600 --> 07:33:36.880
you to be aware that the for-profit law firm hired by school districts to deny services of special

07:33:36.880 --> 07:33:41.760
needs children haven't slowed down and are actively suing students with disabilities

07:33:41.840 --> 07:33:46.560
many school districts spend a million dollars or more on legal fees annually this funding could go

07:33:46.560 --> 07:33:52.160
to teachers critical programs or even ppe and other necessities to bring back kids to school

07:33:52.160 --> 07:34:00.800

how special education dollars are being misused by the west end selpa we selpa has spent over

07:34:28.160 --> 07:34:34.240
two million dollars on for-profit litigation to deny children special education services

07:34:34.640 --> 07:34:40.960
children special education services in most cases the cost of the lawyers is much more

07:34:41.600 --> 07:34:48.560
than what the parent is requesting i filed a complaint with the state bar about fff

07:34:48.560 --> 07:34:54.960
because they filed a frivolous legal action in federal court over eight dollars and 40 cents

07:34:55.520 --> 07:35:01.760
they have three attorneys getting paid up to 290 dollars per hour to get me to pay the district

07:35:01.760 --> 07:35:07.680
eight dollars and 40 cents these attorneys are being enabled by the upland unified school

07:35:07.680 --> 07:35:13.920

law firms that are fighting parents for just a couple of dollars in my case my district filed
