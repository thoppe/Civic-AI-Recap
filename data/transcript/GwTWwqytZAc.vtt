WEBVTT

00:01.454 --> 00:04.076
Start with the Pledge of Allegiance of the flag.

00:08.138 --> 00:21.646
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:25.757 --> 00:26.097
All right.

00:26.998 --> 00:39.530
First, we will have the report of the superintendent and then I will make the usual announcements and then we will take up item 19 for the election of officers of the board.

00:40.131 --> 00:41.732
So, superintendent.

00:42.513 --> 00:44.535
Board members, public, Happy New Year.

00:45.447 --> 00:47.109
We have an action packed year in front of us.

00:47.129 --> 00:52.214
We've accomplished a lot last year and we'll get more done in 2018.

00:52.294 --> 00:55.217
So welcome to the first state board meeting of the year.

00:55.237 --> 00:58.341
I want to give a quick update on a number of fronts.

00:58.401 --> 01:00.463
First, let me introduce two new division directors.

01:01.104 --> 01:02.645
We have Lisa Constancio.

01:03.346 --> 01:05.428
She will be heading up our charter schools division.

01:06.414 --> 01:13.418
He is responsible for more than, in that position, more than 600,000 students in our 1,200 public charter schools.

01:13.458 --> 01:18.761
So Lisa's here, just wanted to have her stand up and be recognized and thank her for taking on that task.

01:21.499 --> 01:28.823
She previously served as a consultant with the School Facilities and Transportation Services Division, and we welcome her to Charter Schools.

01:29.543 --> 01:36.927
And then Lisa Mistretti is Director of the Fiscal and Administrative Services Division, where she previously oversaw the Budget Management Unit.

01:37.367 --> 01:45.552
She was also an Associate Director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and so she's joining our team, and would she please stand up and be recognized?

01:45.652 --> 01:45.912
Lisa.

01:49.727 --> 01:50.487
That's two leases.

01:50.607 --> 01:51.268
Easy to remember.

01:52.968 --> 01:54.689
So next state budget.

01:54.709 --> 01:56.830
Just a couple of quick comments and highlights.

01:56.870 --> 01:59.911
The governor last week, of course, released a budget is full of good news.

02:00.671 --> 02:02.892
The budget provides a big boost to our public schools.

02:03.452 --> 02:07.854
It shows how far we've come in the past seven years and increasing investments in education.

02:08.595 --> 02:13.101
So our students can succeed in college and the fiercely competitive 21st century economy.

02:13.542 --> 02:20.653
We have to thank the voters of the state for voting for Prop 55 and Prop 30 before that and believing in our public schools and wanting to invest in our public schools.

02:21.451 --> 02:29.357
And I recall back in early 2011, do you remember when we had a call, emergency call?

02:29.797 --> 02:33.320
And we said, I declared a state of fiscal emergency for the state of California.

02:33.340 --> 02:34.421
Well, thank goodness.

02:34.461 --> 02:43.367
We had already lost about 20,000 teachers to layoffs, and we're facing another 10,000 teachers to be laid off if the voters hadn't supported us.

02:43.948 --> 02:49.292
So all the good work that we've done, the districts have done, has worked.

02:49.992 --> 02:59.480
I want to mention that the proposal from the Governor includes $3.8 billion to the annual Proposition 98 guarantees, which will raise per-pupil spending 66% above the 2011-2012 levels.

03:04.218 --> 03:13.202
Total Prop 98 funding in the same period has gone from $47 billion at that time in 2011-12 to more than $78 billion.

03:13.222 --> 03:17.064
That's a $31 billion increase over these few years.

03:17.724 --> 03:21.926
The budget also fully funds the local control funding formula two years ahead of schedule.

03:22.806 --> 03:24.207
In addition, the governor's proposed $100 million

03:26.363 --> 03:30.847
to the commission on teacher credentialing for new programs to help train and retain teachers.

03:31.568 --> 03:38.114
And I'm pleased he plans also to release 640 million in bond funds to pay for critically needed school facilities.

03:38.875 --> 03:45.582
We also thank the governor for maintaining the three-year commitment to increased access and funding for early childhood education.

03:47.386 --> 03:50.608
We have been beset with more disasters, unfortunately.

03:50.668 --> 03:57.391
I reported last board meeting on the fight in Northern California with the wildfires in that area.

03:58.131 --> 04:03.694
At that time, we were having about 300,000 students out of school.

04:03.714 --> 04:11.538
652 schools were closed for one or more days and many for weeks because of the fire disaster in Northern California.

04:12.677 --> 04:20.440
The December fires at peak, 532 schools affected, closed, and 300,000 students out of the classroom.

04:20.881 --> 04:26.803
Again, I want to thank Glenn Price and Brianna Mullen and the whole team, OES.

04:26.923 --> 04:28.104
We work closely with OES.

04:28.764 --> 04:41.450
And they asked us, CDE, and Glenn headed that effort up to coordinate the reopening issues, certifying that hazardous materials were cleared from school sites before students returned.

04:42.450 --> 04:47.452
So they did a terrific job working with the National Guard and Cal Fire, Cal EPA, and Cal Recycle.

04:48.673 --> 04:53.975
We learned a lot from these disasters on what we can do even better to be prepared in the future.

04:55.015 --> 04:57.937
Unfortunately, of course, the fires destabilized.

04:58.657 --> 05:03.759
Without the trees, the slopes were destabilized and we had the mudslides.

05:03.859 --> 05:10.482
And so far, 18 confirmed deaths and many more possible to be confirmed yet.

05:11.222 --> 05:22.025
So our prayers go out and our hearts go out to the families that have been affected by a loss of life or child and just by the full disruption that's gone on.

05:22.065 --> 05:27.807
We have to praise the teachers and school officials for working very closely.

05:28.947 --> 05:33.352
Santa Barbara, Susan Salcedo is doing a great job as county superintendent there.

05:33.992 --> 05:44.402
And we've been providing everything from portables to counselors to help with the shock, the trauma, the post-traumatic syndrome, as it were.

05:46.914 --> 05:47.914
chronic absenteeism.

05:48.234 --> 05:54.337
On a very positive note, this board has worked very focused on this issue.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.118
We've worked in CDE very focused on this issue.

05:57.778 --> 06:02.940
In December, I announced the availability of statewide chronic absenteeism data for the first time in California.

06:03.840 --> 06:13.688
This will provide a new understanding of absenteeism rates and enable schools to see at a comprehensive level which students are missing school and in danger of falling behind.

06:13.708 --> 06:24.157
A big thanks goes to Kerrick Ashley, the state board staff, Cindy Kazanas, and all the other staff who spent so much time getting this effort together, getting this data available.

06:24.597 --> 06:26.418
This data helps us determine which schools

06:27.293 --> 06:30.974
Districts and student groups have the largest concentration of chronic absences.

06:31.714 --> 06:41.137
We are helping educators and community members focus attention and resources and take actions to keep those students in class and back on the path to academic success.

06:41.857 --> 06:48.819
When California enacted LCFF, we were one of only two states in the country to build an indicator around chronic absence.

06:49.560 --> 06:54.001
School districts must now track and address chronic absence as part of their LCAPs.

06:55.168 --> 07:03.853
We are focusing on preventing attendance problems by promoting a positive school climate, ensuring early interventions and addressing barriers to school attendance.

07:05.114 --> 07:08.096
The other big news announced in December was the dashboard.

07:08.136 --> 07:19.763
Again, kudos to the state board staff and members and to Kerrick Ashley, Cindy Kazanas and Jenny Singh for their outstanding work bringing the dashboard to us.

07:21.886 --> 07:35.357
It comes at the same time, and we did that purposely, as we launched the new statewide system of support, which this board has been reviewing and giving input to and helping focus on that system of support.

07:36.719 --> 07:40.482
This is a critical moment in our education reform efforts because we are now turning data

07:41.249 --> 07:42.149
into direct action.

07:42.729 --> 07:47.910
We are identifying districts that face challenges in certain areas and providing them with help rather than sanctions.

07:48.751 --> 07:53.091
This system, as we've developed, has a keen and special focus on equity.

07:53.592 --> 07:58.353
It is designed to shine a light on the students who need this help the most.

07:58.373 --> 08:04.294
And finally, I'll mention that we had a trip to Tijuana to meet with Secretary Mendoza of Baja.

08:05.314 --> 08:12.000
And we learned a lot about our students who were caught in the deportation, caught in the migration issues.

08:13.421 --> 08:21.148
We learned that in visiting several schools that about 50,000 students are going to school in Baja.

08:21.969 --> 08:22.990
who are U.S.

08:23.010 --> 08:23.310
born.

08:24.491 --> 08:29.756
And it turned out as we sat, we met with high school students, we met with elementary school students.

08:30.937 --> 08:37.462
In one roundtable at one of the schools, we asked what city did they come from in California?

08:38.643 --> 08:43.726
and what's it like adjusting to life in Mexico, in Baja.

08:44.726 --> 08:50.429
One girl, Cindy Mateas, Clara Mateas, said, I went to Pittsburgh.

08:50.449 --> 08:56.111
I came from Pittsburgh, California, and I went to Los Maldonados Elementary School.

08:56.432 --> 08:56.672
I said,

08:57.412 --> 09:01.035
That school is one mile from my house where I live.

09:01.515 --> 09:02.696
And she went for three years.

09:02.916 --> 09:05.878
And these 50,000 students don't speak Spanish.

09:06.219 --> 09:10.001
They're coming back to Mexico having been brought up speaking English.

09:10.041 --> 09:18.528
So a large portion of that 50,000 are struggling and taking on the challenge of learning the Spanish language as well as the English language.

09:18.548 --> 09:24.032
So I just thought I'd give that anecdote that I'm writing her a letter and I told her we'll be pen pals and we'll keep in touch.

09:24.708 --> 09:27.969
So we know that this will be a very busy year.

09:28.209 --> 09:29.330
I predict a productive year.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.670
Much progress we made last year, as I said before.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.051
And we know yet there's so much work to be done.

09:34.311 --> 09:35.632
Working together, we'll make it happen.

09:35.972 --> 09:36.572
Thank you very much.

09:38.773 --> 09:39.233
Thank you.

09:39.833 --> 09:44.255
So I will open with the announcements that were typically made at the beginning.

09:44.295 --> 09:50.296
And we also have on the State Board of Education staff a new person to announce, Sarah Petrowski.

09:50.797 --> 09:51.557
Please stand up.

09:52.853 --> 09:53.934
OK, there she is.

09:54.915 --> 10:04.622
And she's a graduate of both undergraduate and master's in public policy analysis degrees from the University of Southern California.

10:05.383 --> 10:18.893
And she has worked in the Sacramento City District on a lot of our topics, assessment, research, and evaluation, accountability, LCAP, strategic planning, and knows how to work with parents and stakeholders in this work.

10:19.574 --> 10:28.501
So she will be working at the State Board of Education staff office on accountability work, including CPAG, school climate, and community engagement.

10:28.681 --> 10:30.242
Please join us in welcoming Sarah.

10:35.346 --> 10:36.527
Changes in the agenda.

10:36.828 --> 10:47.476
We will begin today's open session with item 19, SVE priorities to take up officer elections only before opening item 1, item 8, and item

10:49.636 --> 10:54.618
22 have been pulled from our agenda and are not going to be heard at this meeting.

10:55.258 --> 10:59.299
We have four public hearings tomorrow, item 21, 23, 24, and 25.

11:07.301 --> 11:13.403
calendar and waiver consent items are the following.

11:13.463 --> 11:18.185
The regular consent items are item 9 through item 17.

11:18.965 --> 11:26.988
And then we also have the items for waiver consent, which are W1 through W19.

11:28.329 --> 11:34.451
And there's a handout on the table where you can sign up to speak on those items as well.

11:36.645 --> 11:46.847
Then another set of announcements on the usual things for our procedure.

11:46.968 --> 11:54.409
Letters from the public on matters before the board were aggregated and filed in the members' electronic folders sent out before the meeting.

11:55.129 --> 11:59.070
We have a fully electronic agenda and a print copy in the lobby.

11:59.790 --> 12:03.071
Speakers, you should sign up at the table outside the room.

12:03.749 --> 12:07.051
Please identify the item number in which you want to speak.

12:08.071 --> 12:12.314
We have item 20 at the end of the meeting tomorrow for general public comment.

12:13.194 --> 12:22.159
If you wish to give the board something, please provide 25 copies to Amy Bubico at the front desk here on my right.

12:23.380 --> 12:30.164
If you speak before the board, please introduce yourself and identify the organization you represent prior to speaking.

12:32.625 --> 12:38.647
And then we have additional seating with TV monitors if needed in room 1801.

12:40.708 --> 12:47.530
So now I'm going to turn the meeting over to open the eye of the bill, formal items with item 19.

12:48.731 --> 12:52.252
And the state superintendent will conduct this part of the meeting.

12:53.371 --> 12:55.533
Oh, okay.

12:56.254 --> 12:56.995
We found the gavel.

12:57.555 --> 12:59.777
So, thank you, Mr. President.

12:59.797 --> 13:05.843
So, in keeping, I want to just preface our action for nominating and electing the President of the Board for this year.

13:06.804 --> 13:12.889
In keeping with Article 4 of the State Board's bylaws, I would like to call for nominations for the Office of President.

13:13.670 --> 13:20.653
Six votes are necessary to elect an officer and each officer elected shall serve for one year or until his or her successor is elected.

13:21.393 --> 13:24.954
So I will now open the floor for nominations for the Office of President.

13:25.594 --> 13:26.495
Are there nominations?

13:27.835 --> 13:31.757
So I would like to nominate Michael Kirst as President of the State Board of Education.

13:32.337 --> 13:33.317
Is there a second to that?

13:33.337 --> 13:35.458
It's my pleasure to second that motion.

13:36.458 --> 13:36.798
Excellent.

13:37.699 --> 13:40.980
Now we will have the vote but before that ask is there any public comment?

13:42.403 --> 13:47.386
The motion is to elect Michael Kirst as president of this board for this year.

13:50.068 --> 13:54.731
Having the motion made and seconded, all in favor, raise their hands.

13:56.392 --> 13:57.072
Any opposed?

13:58.353 --> 13:59.173
That is unanimous.

13:59.754 --> 14:02.235
Congratulations, Mr. President Michael Kirst.

14:02.355 --> 14:02.896
OK, right.

14:06.854 --> 14:07.274
Thank you.

14:07.854 --> 14:10.595
Appreciate this vote of confidence.

14:10.655 --> 14:14.817
This will be my 15th year on the California State Board of Education.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.979
I'd like to know if there's, you know, in history, anybody that served longer.

14:20.539 --> 14:24.081
And of course, the first and fourth terms were separated by 40 years.

14:24.141 --> 14:26.822
So quite a time.

14:26.942 --> 14:32.644
So at this point, I will then run the election for the vice president.

14:33.554 --> 14:43.821
And keeping with article four of the state board's bylaws, I would like to call for the nominations for the office of vice president.

14:45.262 --> 14:47.884
Six votes are necessary to elect this officer.

14:49.805 --> 14:50.726
Board member Sandoval.

14:51.287 --> 14:54.729
I nominate Dr. Eileen Strauss for the position of vice president.

14:59.294 --> 15:00.655
OK.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.356
Motion has been made and seconded.

15:03.977 --> 15:06.679
So is there any comment before we proceed?

15:06.739 --> 15:07.519
Public comment?

15:08.840 --> 15:13.644
Hearing none, then all members in favor, please raise your hands.

15:13.664 --> 15:18.327
You can.

15:18.347 --> 15:18.387
OK.

15:18.467 --> 15:19.448
It is unanimous.

15:20.268 --> 15:24.911
And it is my pleasure to announce that your vice president for 2018 has been elected, Dr. Eileen Strauss.

15:32.466 --> 15:40.691
Okay, now we're ready for item one, which is the developing an integrated local, state and federal accountability system.

15:40.731 --> 15:52.457
We're going to be focusing on the dashboard with some presenters who are going to help us understand how they really use it and feature examples of the dashboard being in use locally.

15:52.537 --> 15:59.021
So Cindy Kazanis will present the opening item in terms of the overview and then we'll hear from our guests.

16:01.598 --> 16:05.760
Good morning and Happy New Year members of the board and Superintendent Torlakson.

16:05.780 --> 16:11.544
Thank you for the kind remarks about the release of the chronic absenteeism data as well as the dashboard.

16:12.364 --> 16:25.112
It has been quite an amazing couple of months and it's a privilege to be in this role and helping the state release a new accountability system.

16:25.952 --> 16:29.835
Today, we're going to, as President Kirsch said, we have some guest speakers.

16:29.895 --> 16:33.297
I'm very excited to introduce those to you in a couple of slides.

16:34.298 --> 16:36.279
You will not be taking action on this item.

16:36.359 --> 16:37.480
There is no recommended action.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.603
It's more of an update about the release and where we're headed.

16:41.983 --> 16:43.324
Are you guys getting a little bit of an echo?

16:43.344 --> 16:43.384
OK.

16:49.448 --> 16:50.489
It always happens to me.

16:52.461 --> 16:57.708
Okay, maybe they'll fix it as I'm speaking, if not, they're rock stars.

16:58.248 --> 16:59.330
I don't know about that.

17:00.852 --> 17:03.515
Okay, that's better.

17:04.496 --> 17:09.523
So today, as I mentioned, you're gonna hear an update and then a couple of other.

17:10.484 --> 17:12.505
about the dashboard as well.

17:12.645 --> 17:16.706
So you'll be hearing about the dashboard probably for the bulk of the morning.

17:17.906 --> 17:26.109
Just as a way of background, to get to this place, you all, as I've said on numerous occasions, put in a lot of hard work.

17:26.589 --> 17:35.792
But just to give you a brief overview, it's been over a year since the evaluation rubrics were approved and, of course, rebranded as the dashboard.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.253
in a later meeting.

17:37.673 --> 17:56.542
We had a great deal of stakeholder input leading up to the private preview of the dashboard in February of 2017, and so I want to make sure that I spend a little bit of time talking about stakeholder input today, and also you're going to hear from some stakeholders, our clients, local educational agencies.

17:57.823 --> 18:09.632
The dashboard and the field test that was released to the public in March went through some additional changes in April and continues to evolve as we released it in December.

18:10.313 --> 18:20.541
I think what was critical to the success, not only in the pilot but also in the operational version of the dashboard, was we had an extended period for an LEA preview.

18:21.101 --> 18:27.566
So there was five weeks for both, not only the release in spring, but also in the fall.

18:27.926 --> 18:40.936
And what that allowed us to do was to provide some targeted assistance through a webinar series, as well as field phone calls, take emails on questions that LEAs had around the dashboard.

18:40.996 --> 18:48.201
So as we got ready for the release on December 7th, they knew what was in the dashboard as far as the data.

18:49.162 --> 18:57.688
no surprises in terms of the numbers that were there and we had fully to the extent possible vetted any questions that they had.

18:58.648 --> 19:11.957
So as you saw in your board item there are some things just to highlight that are new to the dashboard as of December and that is the list of schools report, the college career indicator status information.

19:12.458 --> 19:18.422
We do have some new college career indicator reports that we were able to demo at a meeting last month with

19:19.503 --> 19:28.472
with member Rucker and member Ortiz-Lacon, and then we also were able to add in the chronic absenteeism links to DataQuest.

19:29.613 --> 19:35.278
We still have some work to do, so we are still working on making sure that we can provide

19:36.809 --> 19:44.093
these in a printable version through a PDF functionality that our contractor, Sam Joaquin, will be adding shortly.

19:44.874 --> 19:50.037
We are going to be working with Google on helping them to improve the Spanish translation.

19:50.737 --> 19:58.161
And then the governor, in his budget that was released last week, is proposing $300,000 to improve user interface.

19:58.602 --> 20:05.606
And as part of that funding, if it were to be successful in the budgetary process, it would also allow for

20:06.326 --> 20:11.270
some additional stakeholder, some targeted input for that purpose as well.

20:15.694 --> 20:18.096
So we did have one attachment to this item.

20:18.237 --> 20:31.088
We outlined the extensive outreach activities we had done over the last 60 to 75 days, but I wanted to spend a little bit of time on maybe my favorites, and also it will lead into the discussion

20:31.648 --> 20:34.229
for those that are going to be presenting right after me.

20:34.689 --> 20:44.211
So the first, and these are in chronological order, but there also seems to be, we're starting at the bottom of the state and we made our way up to Southern California, I noticed.

20:44.551 --> 20:46.892
The first is the Alternative Accountability Policy Forum.

20:46.972 --> 20:51.033
This is my first time attending, but I know my colleague Jenny Singh has attended in the past.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.994
This is a very targeted forum.

20:54.594 --> 20:57.835
conference for alternative schools, looking at accountability issues.

20:58.535 --> 21:11.000
There is an abundance of charter schools there I have to say which is always good in this space because we want to make sure that we are not only serving our traditional schools but our charter schools that are serving in unique situations.

21:11.620 --> 21:17.162
And we were asked to provide a pre-conference session and the room held about, had about 30 chairs in it.

21:17.941 --> 21:20.582
And they had to bring in another round of chairs and another round of chairs.

21:20.622 --> 21:22.903
And I think there ended up being close to 75 people.

21:23.143 --> 21:25.024
And we had folks from Colorado.

21:25.424 --> 21:32.127
There were a couple other states that were represented that decided to come to our session to learn about what California was doing.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.087
We weren't part of the official conference.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.808
Again, we were a pre-conference highlight.

21:37.329 --> 21:42.891
But it was very interesting to be in a situation where you're hearing from other states as well.

21:43.311 --> 21:48.843
throughout the conference and they had a lot of good feedback for where we were headed with our alternative schools metrics.

21:49.850 --> 21:57.173
We also were offered as part of this conference to do a post-session with our Alternative Schools Task Force members who were able to attend.

21:57.673 --> 21:59.934
And that was a very robust discussion.

22:00.174 --> 22:05.376
And we actually just had a full day session with that task force the first week of January.

22:05.416 --> 22:18.961
So we are on track to start being able to share out some of the things that they're, well, we've been sharing out what they're considering, but we've done some simulations and they've asked us to go back to the drawing board on a couple of things.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.563
But we are on track to implement something this fall.

22:23.004 --> 22:28.729
Moving on to our sort of our bread and butter, which is the California Education and Research Association.

22:28.929 --> 22:32.732
This is what my peers and myself attend on an annual basis.

22:33.272 --> 22:38.757
It was held in Anaheim, and I didn't realize, but they're almost at their 100th anniversary.

22:39.437 --> 22:44.562
96 years and running, and I know President Curtis has participated in this conference in the past.

22:46.223 --> 23:01.056
We always have an abundance of sessions there, but we did have three sessions, and I know Member Burr was recognized at the event as well, and she was able to come to our session talking about DataQuest, and specifically our public reporting with student-level data.

23:01.577 --> 23:10.385
But we had a really dynamic session earlier in the conference with the dashboard, and in fact, my colleagues from Riverside County who will be presenting

23:11.285 --> 23:11.866
in just a bit.

23:12.486 --> 23:16.530
We're part of that presentation with us along with Alameda County Office of Education.

23:17.010 --> 23:31.984
So we start to pick up friends as we go to these conferences and colleagues who want to participate and I think share out what they are doing and so that was a really powerful session and I think the participants got a lot out of it.

23:33.188 --> 23:43.137
And then the final conference that was held, and it's always right after that first long week after Thanksgiving, is the Accountability Leadership Institute.

23:43.377 --> 23:46.319
And that's, of course, hosted by the California Department of Education.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.183
It's focused on Title III leads and our migrant student program representatives.

23:51.844 --> 23:54.867
And we had two sessions related to accountability.

23:54.947 --> 23:57.249
And in fact, the dashboard was repeated.

23:58.289 --> 23:59.671
It was two sessions itself.

24:00.291 --> 24:03.596
And large room, we were given the largest room for that particular session.

24:10.842 --> 24:18.466
And so what I found about that conference that was interesting is these are LEA representatives, but they were super informed.

24:18.546 --> 24:26.711
And so it was a very good, robust discussion of peers asking, if anything, tough questions, which we always appreciate.

24:26.771 --> 24:35.096
But again, I just wanted to make sure that I highlighted in our long attachment on the various meetings we go to on a regular basis what we've been doing.

24:36.621 --> 24:42.763
So next I want to turn it over again to Riverside County Office of Education under the leadership of Cynthia Glover-Woods.

24:42.924 --> 24:44.284
I'll have her introduce her team.

24:44.464 --> 24:50.787
We're so grateful they made the trip today and have been really true partners in helping us get the word out about the dashboard.

24:51.867 --> 24:52.047
Yes.

24:54.748 --> 24:56.349
You don't have anything on your screen in front of you?

24:56.949 --> 24:57.469
It went blank.

24:57.589 --> 25:01.851
Perhaps the gentleman in the room can help with this large screen that the board members look at.

25:39.161 --> 25:39.681
What do you see there?

25:42.483 --> 25:43.944
OK, so let's make one more change.

25:51.950 --> 25:52.190
Black?

25:56.393 --> 25:57.174
Oh, great.

25:58.595 --> 26:02.117
Hang on a second here.

26:02.638 --> 26:02.918
Whoops.

26:03.318 --> 26:04.018
I can't see yours.

26:04.679 --> 26:05.480
How's it look out there now?

26:05.860 --> 26:06.580
Yeah.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.981
Yes, it's just not a great view.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.473
Give me a second here.

26:14.014 --> 26:15.434
It should extend.

26:15.454 --> 26:15.554
Yeah.

26:16.794 --> 26:17.034
Yeah.

26:20.475 --> 26:21.835
It should extend it.

26:25.216 --> 26:25.496
There.

26:25.576 --> 26:26.237
There you go.

26:26.257 --> 26:27.057
OK, that's it.

26:27.117 --> 26:29.477
A little massaging.

26:34.318 --> 26:34.599
Whoops.

26:34.679 --> 26:35.799
No, wait a minute.

26:36.439 --> 26:38.700
OK, we're going to be OK.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.420
Don't leave yet.

26:50.372 --> 26:52.053
We had Riverside County up.

26:52.173 --> 26:53.493
It was up the right way.

26:53.513 --> 27:03.374
OK, so PDF doesn't work the same way PowerPoint does on dual displays.

27:03.895 --> 27:11.176
So when you're doing a PDF, then you need to make sure that you're running in that mode.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.697
When you're doing PowerPoint, it should work here too, but.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.577
OK, thank you.

27:26.013 --> 27:29.394
This is Cynthia Glover-Woods from Riverside County Office of Education.

27:31.035 --> 27:32.795
Good morning, good morning everyone.

27:33.435 --> 27:37.256
Good morning President Kurz, Superintendent Torlakson and members of the board.

27:37.717 --> 27:48.560
My name is Cynthia Glover-Woods and I am honored and pleased to serve as the Chief Academic Officer for Riverside County Office of Education and on behalf of the Riverside County Superintendent of Schools,

27:49.000 --> 28:04.350
Dr. Judy D. White, I'd like to express that we are extremely humbled to have the opportunity to share with you this morning and are honored to share how the California School Dashboard is helping us in Riverside County increase student performance for all students.

28:05.351 --> 28:12.035
In Riverside County, we are committed to every student graduating from high school well prepared for college in the workforce.

28:12.455 --> 28:29.025
And I'm excited to share that the California School Dashboard, the LCAP, and other components of our state's continuous improvement and accountability system have been very instrumental and really serve as the foundation for the ongoing support that we provide to our districts.

28:29.585 --> 28:51.482
We are quite happy that we are able to collaborate with districts in Riverside County to help them in the implementation of actions they have for targeted student support as well as the collaboration that we have with other county offices, with state agencies and CDE staff to continue making sure that every student has every opportunity to be successful in this world.

28:52.243 --> 28:54.965
I'm quite excited to again share that we have

28:55.465 --> 29:03.913
three esteemed members of our Accountability Assessment and Continuous Improvement Unit that will be sharing with you some information this morning.

29:04.213 --> 29:12.181
We have Dr. Melissa Bezanos, the Executive Director of that unit, as well as Steve Ion, Administrator, and Joanne Lauer, Director.

29:12.581 --> 29:21.069
So at this time, I'll ask Dr. Bezanos to come forward and share with you how we are using the California School Dashboard to increase student performance in Riverside County.

29:24.926 --> 29:25.566
Thank you, Cynthia.

29:26.187 --> 29:28.708
Good morning, President Kurst, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

29:29.388 --> 29:36.872
As Cynthia shared, we are extremely delighted to be able to present today, and I did bring the rest of my team as well, just so that we're all in the room together.

29:36.892 --> 29:51.059
You can put some faces to some of the work that we're doing, and we're just gonna share with you some of the highlights, knowing that we wanted to limit the amount of information shared today, but again, connecting the dashboard to, or turning data into action.

29:51.659 --> 29:59.044
So first of all, we wanted to capitalize on some of the existing structures that were part of what we do in Riverside County Office of Education.

29:59.524 --> 30:08.050
So again, we have a variety of different networks that were already in existence as it relates to providing services and support to all the districts in Riverside County.

30:08.470 --> 30:20.238
So our initial goal was to utilize some of those existing structures in order to continue to build capacity with all of the district leaders and district staff related to the new California Accountability and Continuous Improvement System.

30:20.698 --> 30:30.202
So again, we started when the indicators were being approved and the architecture was being approved, when there were discussions about status and change, the five by five grids.

30:30.622 --> 30:39.546
What we wanted to do was go through, provide consistent messages across all of these networks so that they were kept up to speed with all of the developments that were occurring.

30:39.927 --> 30:47.630
So when the dashboard was published, it wasn't a surprise that these are the methodologies, that these are some of the student groups of

30:48.450 --> 30:52.173
that were being included within the accountability system.

30:52.554 --> 31:02.502
So again, we have everything from our district superintendents and our instructional leaders network, which is attended by district assistant superintendents and chief academic officers and curriculum directors.

31:03.002 --> 31:06.445
We have LCAP development teams, which are cross sections of districts.

31:06.545 --> 31:10.488
So again, representative of both educational services and business services.

31:11.468 --> 31:14.730
We have our state and federal program directors as well as our English learning directors.

31:15.051 --> 31:30.220
And as you can see on the list that's displayed, it does take a variety of forms in different audiences across districts so that there was, again, a level of consistency from each different tier of a district down to school levels when we're working with principals.

31:31.061 --> 31:32.702
families, our family engagement network.

31:33.904 --> 31:48.822
We have also extended this across into our special education division with our student programs and services and our Riverside County SELPA and we also host a professional learning network with CCEE as well as participate in the Core Data Collaborative.

31:49.142 --> 32:01.766
So again, as you can see by this list, we have a variety of different opportunities to engage with our districts so that we can ensure consistency of message and then also ensure that there is a level of understanding through a variety of different settings.

32:02.806 --> 32:09.888
Internally, we also share this information within our county office staff so that they are kept up to speed with all the developments.

32:10.588 --> 32:12.630
and across regions in the state.

32:13.030 --> 32:17.574
I serve as the Region 10 lead for the RISDIS, Regional System of District and School Support.

32:18.074 --> 32:25.600
My colleague Joanne Lauer is the Region 10 lead for Title III, and then Dr. Chun-Wu Lee is a RAND representative.

32:25.660 --> 32:31.945
So again, state-level networks, we have an opportunity to share a lot of the developments across different county offices in different regions of the state.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.281
So, when we, I'm just going to show a few examples.

32:36.321 --> 32:46.963
I'm not going to go into detail of all of these, but one of the blessings that we were able to engage with is the convenings that were conducted by CCESA and the Curriculum Instruction Steering Committee.

32:47.363 --> 32:52.324
They were able to put together a variety of resources that were then utilized by county offices across the state.

32:52.784 --> 32:58.685
Again, keeping with that consistent message through all the different, the counties in the state and then down to the district level.

32:59.946 --> 33:15.837
And we were able to utilize a lot of those resources in the presentations that we conducted, so that way we were, again, consistent across the state, but then also enabled us to utilize some of the learning that was taking place across the state in what we were doing to support our districts.

33:16.717 --> 33:20.940
This is an example of Padlet, which is a digital kind of a post-it note tool.

33:21.401 --> 33:27.325
And so we wanted to use additional resources that then our school districts could take back and use in their districts.

33:27.645 --> 33:33.789
So for example, this was a conversation we had related to the spring dashboard and the mathematics academic indicator.

33:34.410 --> 33:37.012
And we asked them to do surface level explorations of their data.

33:37.492 --> 33:40.117
The second column, develop inquiry questions.

33:40.437 --> 33:43.763
We looked at performance gaps, and then we looked at site variation.

33:44.143 --> 33:50.694
So again, there were a variety of different methods that we utilized in order to engage with our districts.

33:51.977 --> 33:54.579
This is an example from our family engagement network.

33:55.700 --> 34:00.343
We wanted to focus on some of the why behind the development of this system.

34:00.863 --> 34:07.568
So, for example, we looked at the student group report and we had conversations with them about the importance of publicly displaying

34:08.248 --> 34:14.890
data for all of the different student groups that are accounted for in this system, as well as data for all of these different indicators.

34:15.671 --> 34:22.413
And it was interesting to hear from them how important they felt it was to show the whole child, to be able to see the picture of a whole school.

34:23.113 --> 34:34.437
Although there are different performance levels for different indicators and we are still in the evolution of this system, it was really refreshing to hear the conversation that they were,

34:35.137 --> 34:42.659
understanding the need to really show more than just an academic or an academic performance index or place a label on a school.

34:44.479 --> 34:50.081
And one big piece of emphasis in the variety of networks that we host is that we really need to get this down to the classroom level.

34:50.581 --> 34:56.422
If what we talk about stays at the district level or stays in a plan that sits on a shelf, we don't get to turn data into action.

34:56.882 --> 35:04.584
And so this is an image of showing the LCAP goal, state priorities, indicators, metrics, all the way down through student groups and into the individual students.

35:05.124 --> 35:14.569
And our conversations relate to what are our leading indicators and formative measures that we're utilizing in order to measure progress throughout the year, not just when the dashboard is published.

35:14.609 --> 35:15.910
The dashboard shouldn't be a surprise.

35:16.891 --> 35:28.037
We also talk about the performance gaps and how do we ensure that there is impact for the different groups and we can accelerate learning for student groups that may not be performing at the expected level.

35:29.277 --> 35:34.378
And we've offered opportunities for our districts to share what it is that they're doing.

35:34.718 --> 35:38.719
So for example, Trevor Payton from Romoland School District, he's an assistant superintendent.

35:39.099 --> 35:53.602
He shared a slide deck that he creates with leading indicators that is shared with his principals monthly so they can engage in conversations with their school staff about their progress in all of these different areas using local formative data.

35:54.382 --> 36:11.969
Esperanza Arce, who's a principal in Val Verde Unified, she shared with a variety of our networks about how she took the dashboard data, the 5 by 5 tables, and each of her departments set targets for progress throughout the year that they can share within their data teams when they're working as a professional learning community.

36:12.269 --> 36:15.110
They can have conversations about progress of individual student groups.

36:15.550 --> 36:25.796
So, again, our goal is really to penetrate all the way down to the classroom level because the impact of all of this data really is where the students sit in the desks.

36:27.397 --> 36:28.438
This is just another example.

36:28.478 --> 36:40.045
I won't go through into too much detail here, but we did develop a tool for districts that need additional resources to facilitate dialogue internally with their staff.

36:40.465 --> 36:49.210
So, actually tomorrow we have an LCAP network meeting that we're hosting and we're going to go through different sections of the dashboard with district leaders and LCAP teams.

36:49.830 --> 37:02.517
And it starts with screenshots of each different page of the dashboard and just poses inquiry questions for them to dialogue around and determine, you know, what might be some next steps as they want to dig deeper into their data.

37:04.419 --> 37:15.813
And lastly, again, as I mentioned, one of the most profound benefits of the variety of networks that we host is that districts get to share with one another, that we don't purport to have all of the answers or all of the solutions.

37:15.893 --> 37:18.216
It's really about them being able to share their practices.

37:18.696 --> 37:20.818
So, this is an example from our CalPADS network.

37:21.519 --> 37:33.950
Catalina who is our executive director from our college and career unit, she was sharing with the CalPADS network about the impact of CalPADS data on all the indicators and talking about graduation rate and the college career indicators specifically.

37:34.451 --> 37:39.696
So, again, really just trying to capitalize on those structures to be able to continue to share information.

37:40.897 --> 37:52.591
Two examples from districts, I know this is very tiny, but Glenn Alegre from the Marino Valley Unified School District, he used Excel to be able to capture a lot of dashboard information in one screen, in one page.

37:53.352 --> 37:57.638
And so he provided this to our county with all of our county districts included.

37:58.218 --> 38:16.453
But he does this site by site, and so a principal can see for each student group, the performance on the indicator, they have the image of the performance level color, but then it also has their status and change, it has their end size, the number of students that are included, so that a principal will have a one-page kind of summary.

38:16.814 --> 38:25.381
And then we invited Glenn to come to our office to then share with all the other districts how he was able to accomplish this and teach them the process so that other districts would be able to do this as well.

38:26.502 --> 38:30.465
And then the last example comes from Palm Springs Unified School District, Dr. Jim Pfeffer.

38:30.826 --> 38:48.403
He was able to take, again, very tiny font, I apologize for that, but for each of the metrics that are part of their LCAP, he took the baseline data and then they set growth targets for each of the different student groups, so each different colored column is related to a different student group.

38:49.143 --> 38:53.066
And there are tabs across the bottom representative of all the sites in the district.

38:53.627 --> 38:57.190
And again, it was about the conversation of how does this translate at the site level.

38:57.430 --> 39:02.314
If this is only about the LCAP and at the district level, then we're not really touching the students.

39:02.634 --> 39:06.117
So it really is about getting this down to the site level and having conversations about that.

39:06.797 --> 39:18.225
And the one thing I'll add to this is that he mentioned that this is supplemented by a publication that's included within their local newspaper, the Desert Sun, which also explains all of the different indicators.

39:18.265 --> 39:23.028
And they do annual, biannual inserts in local newspapers to explain to the public.

39:23.508 --> 39:25.009
about the indicators in the dashboard.

39:25.049 --> 39:37.476
So again, it really is an honor to work with the gifted educators in Riverside County that are able to come up with a variety of different methods in order to get this information down to the classroom level and really impact the students.

39:37.496 --> 39:46.221
So I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, Steve Ion, and he's going to share a little bit about a tool that we're utilizing in order to visualize dashboard data as well.

39:49.783 --> 39:50.343
Thank you, Melissa.

39:50.956 --> 39:51.877
My name is Steve Ayon.

39:52.377 --> 39:56.121
I am the Data and Analytics Administrator at Riverside County Office of Education.

39:58.122 --> 40:09.672
One of the things that we are doing at Riverside County is I'm taking a lot of the data files that CDE provides and we're developing additional reports and visualizations to make that data usable in a variety of different ways.

40:12.135 --> 40:17.039
Here we have an example of what I've done with the files taken from the California School Dashboard.

40:17.774 --> 40:21.179
and we've put it together to produce some different visualizations.

40:22.001 --> 40:30.053
This is our version of it, and in this page that we see here in the screen, we see that we have graduation rates for Riverside County.

40:30.763 --> 40:37.211
as we can see that each bar corresponds to each LEA, and from here we can see that it does five things.

40:37.251 --> 40:43.439
We see that each bar represents the performance level color, same as the California School Dashboard.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.362
We also see an arrow indicating the direction of change.

40:46.743 --> 40:48.906
To the right is increasing, to the left is decreasing.

40:49.606 --> 40:58.169
Also, the length of the bar indicates the magnitude of that change, and of course we see the current status and the previous status.

40:59.529 --> 41:02.930
The current status is the one where the arrowhead is pointing towards.

41:04.011 --> 41:08.792
The visualization allows us to make comparisons between LEAs, sites, and student groups.

41:09.372 --> 41:11.193
Users can select the combination of

41:11.753 --> 41:25.483
county indicator or student groups on the right hand side so they can look at the different indicators, student groups, and this has the entire state data files loaded into there so anybody in the state can view this data including charters.

41:29.540 --> 41:39.787
In this slide we see the district by priority tab and this tab we can see it's a view that allows us to see all the different indicators by priority as well as the student groups across the top.

41:40.348 --> 41:46.512
What this allows us to do is to select the different click on the different arrows and by clicking on them

41:47.032 --> 41:50.313
we get to see a little bit more information about each one.

41:50.393 --> 42:00.337
We get to see how many, all the information about the student group, indicator name, performance level, status and change, and end size.

42:00.937 --> 42:11.081
And as we click on it, we also get to see a little bit more information about how each district is performing and how each school is contributing to the whole of the district.

42:11.741 --> 42:17.727
So, this allows us to get a quick view of an entire district and get to see school level detail as well.

42:21.091 --> 42:24.755
We also have some additional reports that give us different views of the data.

42:25.575 --> 42:30.741
The district schools report displays schools within a district grouped by grade span.

42:31.607 --> 42:35.812
The district student groups shown here displays all student groups within a district.

42:36.773 --> 42:42.679
And the school student groups report displays all student groups within a site or a charter.

42:43.380 --> 42:49.086
And this allows us to do comparisons within the different student groups so that we can get a different view of the dashboard data.

42:51.516 --> 43:11.122
So in addition, we also have a protocol that Dr. Lozano's put together so that we can analyze this data and follow along with the different screens so that districts can help identify which student groups, which sites need more assistance based on the data that is displayed on the dashboard.

43:11.802 --> 43:26.349
And in the spirit of continuous improvement, we will be adding chronic absenteeism data, the CCI college and career indicator data, as well as adding a little bit more English learner performance indicator information in the future.

43:27.109 --> 43:29.310
So with that, I'd like to hand it over to Joanne Lauer.

43:29.330 --> 43:30.471
Thank you.

43:34.613 --> 43:39.015
Hi, Joanne Lauer, Director for Research and Implementation for Riverside County Office of Education.

43:41.246 --> 43:49.689
And I'd like to speak to the fact that although we love the dashboard, another key message is how the dashboard connects the statewide system of support.

43:50.470 --> 43:59.613
And we want to wrap up briefly by sharing how we are utilizing the dashboard in our local context and supporting our districts and converting data into action.

44:03.584 --> 44:09.026
So we've all seen the connecting the system of support multiple times in our conversations around this.

44:09.426 --> 44:17.189
What we wanted to ensure is that we continue to provide extraordinary service and support to our districts in our level one

44:20.730 --> 44:32.075
In addition to understanding that we have differentiated assistance for our eligible school districts based on the LCAP Fall 2017 dashboard.

44:32.555 --> 44:40.599
So we started this by an educational services creating a matrix of our level one supports that you can see here.

44:41.119 --> 44:58.762
Across the top, this is by unit, and within this context, it not only connects to the job-alikes, networks, and collaboratives that Dr. Bozzano just spoke of, but it also includes additional information as to the level of services and support that are available to all districts and schools across our county.

45:02.153 --> 45:09.560
In addition to this, our student program and services division also drafted a version specific to students with disabilities.

45:10.161 --> 45:20.470
So across the top, they have, in addition to the support shown and all the headers across the top, they're also refining their supports by working with their staff

45:21.891 --> 45:31.199
in organizing and supporting specific services around student with disabilities, disability codes.

45:31.740 --> 45:41.548
So they're further developing support, whether it is for students who are autistic, orthopedically handicapped, deaf, hard of hearing, et cetera.

45:41.588 --> 45:43.790
So across the gamut.

45:46.786 --> 45:55.470
But what's very important as we continue this level of support is that we as educators understand the connections between the dashboard and the LCAP annual update.

45:55.790 --> 45:58.451
And so this is where we start to bring these systems together.

45:58.891 --> 46:07.075
So through our networks and especially our LCAP development workshops, we continue to communicate about how these pieces fit and work together.

46:07.715 --> 46:12.799
Not only are we connecting these elements statewide system, we are also connecting them internally as well.

46:13.380 --> 46:27.831
So in our LCAP workshops, we are developing in partnership with our fiscal services team, the presentations that we make with our districts, as well as we co-present in order to really demonstrate the elimination of siloed decision making.

46:30.936 --> 46:39.541
Now for level two support, we've also been working internally on a variety of analyses for our districts that are eligible for differentiated assistance.

46:40.221 --> 46:45.004
For example, as you can see here, we have dashboard and metrics analyses that we've done.

46:45.904 --> 46:54.609
One example of that is we disaggregated our data by student with disability or for students with disabilities by disability group.

46:55.845 --> 47:08.157
And so our districts are then able to use that to really get down and dig into that data around what are the root causes for this data and how can we support that to convert our data into action.

47:09.158 --> 47:14.362
In addition to that, we conducted an analysis of all of the LCAPs in our districts.

47:15.123 --> 47:26.611
And within that LCAP review, you can see here that we were able to visually understand if the dashboard data was connected to the actions and services within the LCAP.

47:27.011 --> 47:35.317
And then this helps our districts to be able to identify where some areas of opportunity may be for them to have a collaborative conversation with their district and respond.

47:36.558 --> 47:41.682
It's also targeted specific student groups, and so they can be very specific in that response.

47:43.294 --> 47:54.642
We also have worked in collaboration with our special education leaders in our county around the PIR status and reviewed the PIR status.

47:55.003 --> 48:07.352
This is extremely important as we know that our districts are going through the PIR process and although the data years are one year different, there is a great deal of overlap into the areas that are identified in our district.

48:07.392 --> 48:10.414
So how can we collaboratively work together and support that?

48:12.423 --> 48:23.869
We also did a participation review of where are our districts also participating in other areas and networks.

48:24.349 --> 48:30.392
So for instance, we have three districts that are participating in the SUMS grant for MTSS.

48:32.093 --> 48:41.017
We have six districts that are in a PLN hosted by RCOE, facilitated by WestEd in educational resource strategies, and four of these are eligible for differentiated assistance.

48:42.338 --> 48:47.760
Three other districts are also participating in other California Collaborative PLNs.

48:48.440 --> 48:58.042
Two districts are in a network facilitated by CORE, and five districts are part of the Riverside County Educational Collaborative, and two of those are eligible for differentiated assistance.

48:58.082 --> 49:03.104
So we have a lot of opportunity, as Dr. Bozanos was describing, to be able to connect to our districts.

49:04.238 --> 49:17.083
And finally, we memorialized our prior services that we have provided to our districts by various educational services units so that we could have a historical context of the type of support that's been provided.

49:20.586 --> 49:29.514
So you may be wondering, well, how are we wrapping all of this up and what is the platform to be able to have these types of conversations and organize ourselves around that?

49:30.155 --> 49:44.708
So as Dr. Bozano mentioned, we wanna also continue our appreciation for CCE and the development of the facilitation guide that enabled us as a county office to have common tools that we could use in our conversations for differentiated assistance in our districts.

49:46.098 --> 49:52.104
Also through CCESA and CISC, the work around improvement science.

49:52.164 --> 49:54.806
And so we have been engaging in the improvement science trainings.

49:55.206 --> 50:05.396
In addition to engaging as a team from Riverside County Educational Services Division, we've also brought the training back to our entire division so that our team is engaged in that process.

50:05.416 --> 50:10.461
So all levels of work understand how to apply the concepts of improvement science.

50:11.161 --> 50:21.451
We also used improvement science to structure our division around this, so it took some adjustment or refinement of our structures to be able to be aligned to this work.

50:22.932 --> 50:32.962
Additionally, we continue to connect the LCAP to the dashboard in every opportunity through networks, trainings, PD opportunities, workshops, et cetera.

50:33.382 --> 50:36.185
And then finally, internally, not only in educational

50:36.605 --> 50:59.863
services division and the reorganization or not reorganization but the restructuring of our supports also being very intentional in collaboration and coordination with other divisions such as student program services for special education as well as fiscal services so that we can continue to work interdependently towards the goal of connecting the dashboard to actions and services.

51:02.325 --> 51:02.645
Thank you.

51:04.343 --> 51:09.685
We're going to go to our next guest speaker, and then we would bring them all back for questions, if you have questions.

51:13.966 --> 51:26.770
We have Dr. Chun-Wu Lee, who's also a member of RAN, and Naomi Purcell, who is an administrator, too, in our unit and was the lead on the LCAP analysis.

51:28.890 --> 51:29.490
Thank you, Joanne.

51:29.771 --> 51:30.551
That was excellent.

51:30.931 --> 51:31.231
Thank you.

51:35.438 --> 51:35.863
It's happening.

51:39.995 --> 51:49.499
Okay, we're going to skip or move forward rather to a smaller school district, Weaver Union Elementary out of Merced County.

51:49.799 --> 51:56.401
And I had the opportunity to speak to, Merced brings together their school board members on an annual basis.

51:56.501 --> 52:06.625
And in doing that presentation last fall, I had the opportunity to meet Superintendent Curry and was very impressed by his enthusiasm over the local indicators and I wanted to share

52:07.245 --> 52:12.552
have him share with you his story of his district and how they're getting the word out about the local indicators.

52:13.233 --> 52:22.324
So I will turn that over to him, and I wanted to make sure before I leave the podium that you can see this screen.

52:22.685 --> 52:23.005
Excellent.

52:23.085 --> 52:23.365
Thank you.

52:24.947 --> 52:25.367
Good morning.

52:26.488 --> 52:27.228
Thanks for having me.

52:27.988 --> 52:29.949
So I'm very excited to share this with you.

52:29.989 --> 52:31.170
First of all, I'll let you know I'm John Kerr.

52:31.190 --> 52:33.090
I'm the superintendent at Weaver Union School District.

52:33.110 --> 52:37.952
We are a small school district in the southern tip of Merced, 2,800 kids, three schools.

52:38.632 --> 52:40.533
I'm also a member of the California League of Schools.

52:40.773 --> 52:44.675
Many of you are familiar with that, with our Schools to Watch taking center stage.

52:44.695 --> 52:50.017
And so proud to be a representative of the elementary branch of that.

52:50.037 --> 52:52.118
I'm the president of California League of Elementary Schools.

52:53.418 --> 52:54.199
Excited about that.

52:54.279 --> 52:58.981
So I'm here today to talk a little bit about the accountability system and local measures.

52:59.081 --> 53:05.484
So as you can see by my website, I've got, we've developed a nice link to something that you may be familiar with.

53:05.564 --> 53:06.845
I'm sure you've seen this before.

53:08.357 --> 53:10.898
And I'm going to direct our attention to the local indicators.

53:11.258 --> 53:19.281
And what I want to say to you is we have determined that this is a perfect opportunity for us to further define the word MET.

53:20.681 --> 53:32.125
We believe that this is how you capture your stakeholders and those folks who are interested in taking a look at your schools and wanting to know a little bit more about local climate and what does MET really mean.

53:32.906 --> 53:35.647
So we've decided that we're going to work on that.

53:36.727 --> 53:40.355
together with the work of education research consultants out of Fresno.

53:41.814 --> 53:47.519
I had an idea, you know how you have an idea and it becomes a concept and then it comes to life.

53:47.539 --> 53:48.960
So I'm very excited about this.

53:49.421 --> 53:57.208
So if you look at what we've done here in the narrative piece, which I appreciate the narrative piece so much, our district has created a local dashboard that you can see.

53:57.588 --> 54:02.652
So then what we have done is we have created this local dashboard.

54:04.294 --> 54:06.976
And that kind of looks familiar to you, doesn't it?

54:08.837 --> 54:10.118
We've seen the wedgies before.

54:10.138 --> 54:12.200
I call them wedgies.

54:12.440 --> 54:18.784
I know Trivial Pursuit has a patent on that, but we all call them wedgies, don't we?

54:19.425 --> 54:20.005
They're wedgies.

54:20.966 --> 54:26.030
So as you can see, we go to our detailed view of this, which I'll explain a little bit later.

54:26.610 --> 54:29.993
And now I have graphic indicators for someone who

54:31.736 --> 54:39.894
isn't necessarily interested in all the academic pieces, but maybe is interested in those local measures.

54:40.968 --> 54:44.490
sharing a little bit about what we measure locally.

54:44.971 --> 54:50.334
And as you can see, we have created a little indications on the top there.

54:50.374 --> 54:51.835
We have three schools, 28, 15.

54:52.235 --> 54:54.037
There's our SCD percentage.

54:54.077 --> 54:55.598
There's our English learner percentage.

54:56.158 --> 54:59.960
And then we go to, this mouse is fast.

55:01.741 --> 55:05.942
Priority one, we use the fitness inspection toolkit and we are status and change.

55:06.002 --> 55:07.182
I love that status and change.

55:07.222 --> 55:11.843
In fact, I really appreciate the new dashboard and what it's doing for many of our districts.

55:11.883 --> 55:16.944
Many of our districts that were never close to 800 just really didn't have hope.

55:17.664 --> 55:22.485
And with status and change now, you have given hope to many districts.

55:22.505 --> 55:23.965
So I wanna thank you for that.

55:24.445 --> 55:25.605
I really applaud that work.

55:26.946 --> 55:28.306
It's very encouraging for many.

55:29.212 --> 55:37.720
So as you can see, status and change over a few years, we can actually show our community, our stakeholders, where we were and where we are.

55:38.460 --> 55:41.243
And this is a little bit more of a definition than MET, as you can see.

55:41.764 --> 55:50.712
So in priority one, we've got the facility inspection toolkit, we've got appropriately assigned teachers, and we have equal access to core curriculum graphically displayed.

55:51.652 --> 55:56.554
Priority two, we utilized option two that the CDE provided for us, the metrics.

55:57.455 --> 56:02.817
And we have now given ourselves the grades on how we are doing in regards to implementation of academic standards.

56:03.338 --> 56:04.098
And there you can see.

56:04.518 --> 56:08.440
Next year, we'll have two years of data on that so that you can see status and change.

56:09.383 --> 56:26.929
Parent engagement piece, rather than show the entire California Healthy Kids survey on a slideshow that people can dig into, what we decided to do was, what do we think that parents and community members are gonna be the most interested in regards to the parent survey?

56:27.390 --> 56:33.012
So we selected these two, parent satisfaction with school communication and their satisfaction with academic program.

56:33.272 --> 56:36.373
We take the survey and every year now we're providing the information.

56:39.770 --> 56:44.294
Local Climate Survey, this is where the Healthy Kids Survey comes in for us every two years.

56:44.735 --> 56:51.701
And we actually pulled the two that we felt were the most important in regards to what our neighbors and our stakeholders would want to know.

56:51.921 --> 56:53.442
Do our students feel safe on the campus?

56:53.883 --> 56:55.124
Do our students feel connected?

56:55.504 --> 56:57.646
And we have two years of data to indicate that.

56:58.046 --> 57:02.891
And as you can see, we've got a little bit of a skip because we do the California Healthy Kids Survey every two years.

57:03.351 --> 57:06.192
So we've got 2014 data and then 2016 data.

57:07.032 --> 57:18.694
We have also thrown a couple of extra ones up there because we're proud of the fact that our ADA rate has gone up and we're proud of the fact that we've only had two students drop out last year and three students the year before.

57:19.054 --> 57:26.036
Now I'll tell you that this is a document, this is a website actually that we are expanding this because

57:27.242 --> 57:35.150
Again, the local measures are to be reported as a district only, but what we have done is we have decided to allow folks to take a look at their school.

57:35.991 --> 57:38.773
I want to know how my kids at Farmdale Elementary are doing.

57:39.774 --> 57:42.317
And so we've desegregated that data.

57:42.477 --> 57:44.519
I had to say desegregated so I could get points.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.401
So we've desegregated our data.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.903
And as you can see, you only have the fifth grade scores.

57:48.923 --> 57:50.324
You don't have the seventh grade scores.

57:52.375 --> 57:54.636
Somebody will be proud of me at home because I said that.

57:56.737 --> 58:00.818
And if you want to take a look at the middle school, you'll see that there is no fifth grade data for the middle school.

58:01.918 --> 58:04.839
And again, these are specific to those school sites.

58:06.460 --> 58:14.883
And you will see that there are a few measures that are district wide, but many of these measures we have desegregated by school site.

58:15.443 --> 58:18.184
One of the other tools that we're going to be utilizing in the future

58:19.164 --> 58:30.332
is we're going to be utilizing what we call a school comparison tool where you can go on and you can see if your elementary school did better than the elementary school down the street because we know those rivalries.

58:30.592 --> 58:36.236
And those rivalries can create some initiative for schools to kind of pay attention and do some things.

58:36.856 --> 58:38.537
We can't be down the street.

58:39.458 --> 58:44.581
Pioneer Elementary versus Farmdale Elementary in our district, they're gonna wanna see if they could beat each other in ADA for sure.

58:44.982 --> 58:46.603
And so this can spur them on to do that.

58:47.103 --> 58:53.287
We're excited about this because it's another way to engage stakeholders.

58:53.347 --> 58:59.812
And I'm talking about stakeholders, including your realtors that want to brag about location, location, location.

58:59.852 --> 59:03.595
And we want you to move to these schools because take a look at this school in this district.

59:04.555 --> 59:07.738
It can expand to that level.

59:07.818 --> 59:15.023
We believe that this is wonderful for board members as well, that we ask board members to study numerous documents.

59:15.723 --> 59:24.788
This is at a glance showing the priorities in a district in a local measure that will allow them to understand more than the word met.

59:25.328 --> 59:26.569
We're excited to share this with you.

59:26.609 --> 59:32.432
And again, I appreciate the partnership that we have with the California League of Schools and ERC.

59:33.052 --> 59:41.957
And happy to share this with any other district if they would be interested in taking a look at it and interested in your thoughts and feedback on this as well.

59:41.997 --> 59:43.518
So thank you for allowing me to do this.

59:58.069 --> 59:58.229
Great.

59:58.449 --> 01:00:04.314
So I just have two slides to close out the presentation and we can turn it back to President Kruse for questions.

01:00:05.195 --> 01:00:05.595
Excuse me.

01:00:06.475 --> 01:00:12.460
Just to give you a preview of what to expect over the next 60 days or so.

01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:17.524
We will be providing you two information memoranda in February.

01:00:18.084 --> 01:00:22.208
The first one is talking about the ongoing development of the college career indicator.

01:00:22.408 --> 01:00:24.489
That is something that I know

01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:50.237
member Rucker and member Ortiz-Larcon had concerns about at another meeting that took place last month so we will talk a bit about that in a memo, and we also will start to explore yet again we can pick back up the student growth model options and we will actually be hosting with our partners from ETS a public session on the growth models at the end of February so I'm pleased to announce that today.

01:00:50.297 --> 01:00:53.878
We will let folks know of the meeting date and location

01:00:54.779 --> 01:00:58.222
in a stakeholder session soon.

01:00:58.983 --> 01:01:01.626
And then for the March meeting, this is of course our annual work plan.

01:01:01.666 --> 01:01:14.579
So we will be coming to you, giving you an update on all the things that we will be working on over the next six months as we prepare for your action on items for input in the dashboard for fall of 2018.

01:01:16.321 --> 01:01:19.605
So those are the pieces, especially in March.

01:01:20.165 --> 01:01:23.068
We know that you need to take action on the chronic absenteeism indicator.

01:01:23.088 --> 01:01:25.631
That's something we've talked about now for two meetings.

01:01:26.171 --> 01:01:37.043
And then we will also provide you in that work plan an update on the development, of course, of our Dashpoint alternative school status and the modified methods that will apply to alternative schools.

01:01:37.603 --> 01:01:44.088
So I wanted to close out with just a quote from actually my home county, from Ventura County Office of Education.

01:01:44.108 --> 01:01:50.874
And Antonio Castro's been, just like Riverside County, very engaged in the process, asking a lot of questions.

01:01:50.994 --> 01:01:59.861
And so I thought it was nice to hear not only from an LA that wasn't able to be here through this quote that was in the local paper in Ventura.

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:03.304
So with that, President Christ, I'll turn it back to you.

01:02:04.295 --> 01:02:06.401
Thank you for the informative presentations.

01:02:06.481 --> 01:02:07.565
Board member questions.

01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:10.854
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.280
Thank you and I want to thank the presenters.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:24.386
I was very impressed by both presentations and really hope that this becomes a standard for practice for LEAs and county offices.

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:36.395
I want to start with the Riverside County Office of Riverside County Office of Education, their presentation and I really love the way that they describe their model which is really braiding

01:02:36.915 --> 01:02:45.769
the LCAP template, the annual update, the data dashboard, and the data that they are now previewed to, as well as support.

01:02:46.349 --> 01:02:46.630
So, I

01:02:49.748 --> 01:02:57.030
was under the impression that the LCAP update, the annual update, would be updated based on the new data that was released.

01:02:57.430 --> 01:03:05.132
And it seems like there may be folks who don't think that that's not necessarily the case, that you don't update your data.

01:03:05.252 --> 01:03:17.336
And I'm seeing it in this presentation and I love that it's clearly stated here that the purpose of having new data is to then go back to your LCAP and say, is this data, are goals still relevant, right?

01:03:17.896 --> 01:03:26.140
Specifically, if we look at the data that we released and when we changed the methodology, new groups were identified.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:33.083
So ELs are now identified more in red and orange because they moved a little bit down from the yellow.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:43.107
So are we expecting districts and county offices to go back to the LCAP annual update and update it according to that data?

01:03:43.427 --> 01:03:47.129
And I know it sounds so simple, but apparently that is something that is not clear.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:54.113
Good morning, Jeff Breshears, Director of the Local Agency Systems Support Office.

01:03:54.633 --> 01:03:58.136
And certainly the dashboard is supposed to help inform the annual update.

01:03:58.156 --> 01:04:08.084
There are specific prompts in the template, in the LCAP template, that ask that the LEAs to go back and look at data within their dashboard and then respond to that.

01:04:08.164 --> 01:04:12.928
And certainly that is part of the needs assessment that would go on to the development or the

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.111
any modification of goals, actions, and services.

01:04:17.871 --> 01:04:27.076
There are prompts within the plan summary that also refer back to the dashboard and say, based on the data that you have in the dashboard, what are you going to do with this and moving forward?

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:32.079
So absolutely, the LCAP is intended to be informed by data from the dashboard.

01:04:32.892 --> 01:04:37.094
So they are updating it according to the most recent data that they receive.

01:04:37.214 --> 01:04:37.454
Yes.

01:04:37.855 --> 01:04:38.955
Okay.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:50.021
Then the second question and I was asking board member Burr, does the annual update also get approved by the county office or is that just by the LEA board?

01:04:50.642 --> 01:04:52.683
It's also approved by the county office.

01:04:52.863 --> 01:04:56.925
It is part of on the annual basis and statute says the LCAP and the annual update

01:04:57.699 --> 01:05:06.950
is developed at the local level, adopted at the local governing board, and then submitted to the county office, school districts, to the county offices for review and approval, yes.

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:15.701
So the annual update also is now subject to review and they will be looking to make sure that there is new updated data in that annual update.

01:05:15.982 --> 01:05:16.762
That is correct, yeah.

01:05:16.842 --> 01:05:17.683
Perfect, thank you.

01:05:19.424 --> 01:05:22.966
The second compliment is to the LEA that presented.

01:05:23.026 --> 01:05:23.426
Thank you.

01:05:23.667 --> 01:05:30.331
I absolutely love that there is a narrative that justifies and substantiates your MET.

01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:35.795
When I was looking, I started randomly, you know, I have two kids and I, of course, the first thing I did is I looked up their school.

01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:43.498
And I looked at the school that they previously attended last year, just to make some comparisons to make sure that I made the right decision in moving them.

01:05:43.918 --> 01:05:54.682
So one of the things that I started randomly putting in districts to see how they had rated themselves under the local indicators, and to date I have not found one that says not met.

01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:57.363
And I have to say that I was like, really?

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:05.872
Because we get a lot of your parents coming to our board meetings who are complaining about parent engagement, who have concerns about school climate.

01:06:06.252 --> 01:06:13.099
And so I was having a really hard time with the indicator and the way that we were, is absolute, not met or met.

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.043
And nothing was substantiating that until this presentation.

01:06:16.683 --> 01:06:23.569
And I really hope that that becomes a trend, because I don't know how many districts right now have said, no, we do not meet that criteria.

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:29.415
And there's nothing to substantiate their met affirmation.

01:06:29.755 --> 01:06:37.522
But I'm sure that we will have parents and other stakeholders that will ask us to look deeper into what's happening at their particular districts.

01:06:37.922 --> 01:06:51.876
So I want to congratulate you for taking the dashboard and understanding that we need to expand a little bit and get more information and then really taking that optional step to put in a narrative.

01:06:52.096 --> 01:06:52.377
Thank you.

01:06:54.347 --> 01:07:04.130
I just have to add that we did feature Weaver Union and Superintendent Curry on one of our dashboard series, actually the first one in the dashboard series.

01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:11.332
And then in that six-part series, the last session was focused all on how to use the dashboard in the new LCAP.

01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:18.014
So Jeff and his team had an excellent presentation and it is posted to our website on the accountability webpages.

01:07:18.474 --> 01:07:20.256
for other districts to know about.

01:07:21.398 --> 01:07:26.744
Superintendent Curry got a lot of questions while we were on that webinar asking how he created it.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:32.111
He's been already sharing best practices across the state because of that series.

01:07:37.442 --> 01:07:43.631
I want to add my comments and echo what board member Ortiz-Lacon just said.

01:07:44.672 --> 01:07:51.842
As you know, this has been my greatest concern and the greatest criticisms that I've often had when districts come to make a presentation.

01:07:52.382 --> 01:08:03.169
to the board about what they're doing and what county offices are doing to support their work of implementing not only the LCFF but understanding how to use the dashboard.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:14.217
What gives me great hope about today's presentation is I continue to ask what are we learning and how is the conversation evolving?

01:08:14.677 --> 01:08:17.938
So first, let me commend the staff at Riverside County.

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:35.246
I walked up to them before the meeting started today to tell them I was really looking forward to hearing what they had to say, and I was really anticipating what they were going to present, not just because it's Riverside County, but I have family, cousins who have kids in those schools in Riverside County,

01:08:35.826 --> 01:08:44.471
And they talk to me every single week and they send me their school documents and tell me, tell me what does this say?

01:08:45.032 --> 01:08:50.875
So it's really heartening to hear the conversation from Riverside County for a couple of reasons.

01:08:51.275 --> 01:09:13.267
What I appreciated most about what you did today was you really did set the table on the conversation about what it means to drill down and push out the type of county-level analysis about the dashboard and about the LCAPs that districts should be engaging in, and you have created not only the model, but clear guidance on the process on how to do that.

01:09:13.807 --> 01:09:26.751
I also appreciate the way that you've given expectations to districts about what the drill down from the district in operating and implementing the LCAP down to the sites and even into the classrooms.

01:09:27.071 --> 01:09:28.732
So I truly do appreciate that.

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:47.682
I also appreciate you did not use a lot of mega terms, and if I sit up here and play bureaucrat bingo, I did not hear you check off all those words that everybody uses in having conversations about implementing the LCAP.

01:09:48.066 --> 01:09:59.551
You actually talked about true, organic, and real conversations that you're actually having with districts and the ways that you're actually getting your hands dirty to do this work.

01:09:59.811 --> 01:10:01.371
I just realized I mixed the metaphor.

01:10:01.412 --> 01:10:09.335
Nobody wants to set a table with dirty hands, but you understand where I'm going, so just keep up with me on this.

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:29.063
But the other part about setting this table is you identified real tools and real ways to use those tools with a clear expectation that in giving them these tools, you expect them to use them in both inappropriate and innovative ways.

01:10:29.603 --> 01:10:32.944
And this is coming from a woman who uses her heels to aerate her lawn.

01:10:33.005 --> 01:10:38.967
So I understand and uses a knife to hammer a nail into the wall to hang a picture.

01:10:39.507 --> 01:10:41.929
I understand all of that.

01:10:41.949 --> 01:10:57.319
The final piece on setting the table, you also gave some projections about what the next steps ought to be in a way that it informs how districts who should now be in this LCAP review and monitoring cycle

01:10:57.739 --> 01:11:19.438
looking at how the new data they received in the fall 2017 dashboard should inform the conversations they are having with stakeholders to update and make changes in the LCAP, not only for this year, but in the process of developing the LCAP that they will be reviewing and revising for submission to you this summer.

01:11:19.819 --> 01:11:23.142
What I truly appreciated in what you said and what you presented

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:31.987
is that the LCAP process and the LCAP cycle doesn't just become a checklist of activities that have to be done on a time frame.

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:37.780
it actually becomes real actionable work that is observable and that's quantifiable.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.102
And I really wanna thank the superintendent from Weaver.

01:11:41.523 --> 01:11:47.348
In a previous life, I was a consultant for the region two areas of the California Teachers Association.

01:11:47.368 --> 01:11:53.232
I spent a lot of time driving up and down 99 and working with teachers in those districts.

01:11:54.754 --> 01:11:59.019
As we implemented the local indicators, my question was yours.

01:11:59.379 --> 01:12:01.381
What does MET mean?

01:12:02.162 --> 01:12:12.593
I personally was never really clear that there was clear guidance and a clear understanding on what districts should do because as my colleague previously said,

01:12:13.254 --> 01:12:17.135
Most districts, when you look up this dashboard, they're all giving themselves A's.

01:12:17.475 --> 01:12:22.917
When you get to self-evaluate yourself, nobody wants to advertise the bad news.

01:12:23.237 --> 01:12:25.358
You want to focus on what you're doing well.

01:12:25.838 --> 01:12:31.640
But what I really appreciate is that you all also are doing a deeper dive on those local indicators

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.722
and you're working toward consensus among your stakeholders.

01:12:36.043 --> 01:12:48.451
So you've also created and crafted a real model for how stakeholders can actually look at the data that you're considering and the evidence that's being developed in your local indicators so that when you say we've met it,

01:12:48.891 --> 01:12:53.632
There's clear and compelling evidence that all can agree upon in a review of that data.

01:12:53.972 --> 01:13:05.696
So this was really helpful, not only to see something from Southern California, from a very large and very successful county office, but from Northern California to see a small LEA where this work is being done.

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:14.478
So the question I have is, first of all, how is this replicated, or how do we know that these are not just, you know,

01:13:16.397 --> 01:13:19.279
hit and miss opportunities of successes that are happening?

01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:22.942
How do we know that this is going on as well in other places?

01:13:23.383 --> 01:13:28.627
How are county offices holding themselves accountable for doing this same kind of good work?

01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:41.418
How are county offices, as we go forward now that we're in this phase two of implementing this accountability system, how are county offices holding districts truly accountable in doing the LCAP reviews

01:13:41.818 --> 01:14:04.051
to make sure that what they are submitting in their updates and the work that they are doing, particularly Jeff, for schools that have already been identified for intervention and support, how are county offices giving real guidance to those districts to make sure that they really are using this new data, using data that's been added to the dashboard that wasn't there when they created their their three-year plan,

01:14:04.511 --> 01:14:13.641
to make sure that going forward the data doesn't just sit there and collect dust, and they understand that there are consequences for not paying attention to that data.

01:14:14.021 --> 01:14:25.494
So these are questions we can live with, but this is a conversation that, as it continues to evolve, it seems like the answers are going in the correct direction and the pathway

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:30.957
by the models that were presented today are actually very hopeful and very, very wonderful.

01:14:31.017 --> 01:14:32.498
So thank you very much.

01:14:32.979 --> 01:14:33.499
And Ms.

01:14:33.519 --> 01:14:40.483
Sheppy, today, in the past I said, well, I was kind of disappointed because this is what I expected to hear.

01:14:40.844 --> 01:14:46.247
Thank you so much for, I know you worked very hard with the presenters today to put this together.

01:14:46.287 --> 01:14:48.889
So I really want to make sure I give kudos to you as well.

01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:52.271
A board member Burr is next.

01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:53.872
Thank you.

01:14:54.552 --> 01:15:00.037
So I just will echo what my colleagues have said about how wonderful it is to hear this information.

01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:03.960
And I'll just say from my perspective, this is what local control looks like.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:12.126
And it's so fantastic to see how you've embraced it, how you have made it work in your local communities.

01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:16.350
I was really struck, and I'm sorry I didn't get everybody's name, but by the comment about

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:35.273
What this ultimately is is leading to the impact it has on students who are sitting in desks in individual classrooms and seeing how at the system level this gets put together is very revealing to us and very gratifying I will say for somebody who has worked on this for a few years.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.397
So, very, very appreciative.

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:44.624
I also just want to say thank you to Cindy and Melanie and anybody else at the department who put this together.

01:15:44.644 --> 01:15:53.335
I do think, and Cindy was very modest, I think, in they're gathering this, they're doing all this outreach to

01:15:53.855 --> 01:15:55.116
in lots of different ways.

01:15:55.276 --> 01:15:56.517
She gave some examples.

01:15:56.898 --> 01:16:02.442
And they're learning about this organically, and they're bringing it to us, which I am very, very appreciative of.

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:08.768
And I think it informs all of us and helps kind of see how this system is actually blossoming.

01:16:08.788 --> 01:16:14.913
I'm gonna come back to county offices in just one second, because I want to make sure there wasn't a message lost there.

01:16:14.953 --> 01:16:19.077
But just to conclude in my opening remarks,

01:16:19.637 --> 01:16:33.748
I want us to remember this and kind of embed it in our head as we talk about the ESSA plan, because it has very significant impact, I think, and relevance to what we do or don't do with the federal government.

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:36.651
So just sort of park that in your mind.

01:16:37.912 --> 01:16:44.037
But with respect to county offices, because we get this question a lot, I'm going to put on my CCEE hat now.

01:16:44.497 --> 01:16:52.924
And we've had the opportunity to talk to county offices over time, work very collaboratively with them, with the work of CCEE.

01:16:53.405 --> 01:17:03.133
And I think I heard, so I'm going to ask the Riverside County folks this question, and I think we're going to hear from the CCESA folks probably later in the system of support item.

01:17:03.934 --> 01:17:23.187
But I just want to clarify that you gave us an example, the facilitation guide, that much of the work that you're doing has been guided at the state level by CSESA and by your colleagues, your curriculum and instruction colleagues, your business administration colleagues, and your student services colleagues.

01:17:23.667 --> 01:17:30.130
in an effort to calibrate across all county offices how they interact with school districts.

01:17:30.170 --> 01:17:37.354
So if you could just reinforce that or answer me, maybe I'm wrong, but at least that's my understanding of it.

01:17:37.394 --> 01:17:50.220
And I think there is a great lack of information or understanding of that among LEAs, in the public conversation, because I hear the question all the time, what are county offices doing?

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:55.103
and how do we make sure that they're all operating off the same playbook?

01:17:56.344 --> 01:18:11.133
And Member Burr, you are extremely accurate in that a large majority of our work in the foundation of the support we're providing has been in collaboration with CCESA through CISC, the Curriculum Instruction Steering Committee.

01:18:11.533 --> 01:18:19.618
There's been a lot of work done in planning common presentations over the last couple of years that we have used

01:18:20.038 --> 01:18:26.942
to ensure that there's consistency, not only throughout our county and throughout our region, but also throughout the state.

01:18:27.443 --> 01:18:35.067
So we've been able to take tools that have been collaboratively developed at those levels and then make them applicable for our local levels.

01:18:35.208 --> 01:18:48.656
So the work led by CCESA through CISC, through some of the other steering committees, as well as our collaboration and conversation with CCEE, because we have engaged in conversations with them as well,

01:18:49.296 --> 01:18:51.979
as there's providing support to a district in our county.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:58.666
So it has indeed been a collaboration and that has served as a foundation for us applying it at the local level.

01:19:02.622 --> 01:19:28.363
Well I want to echo my colleagues that have gone before me and just support the and thank the CDE team and the Riverside County and Weaver's presentations because we do know that this is a different system than before and I really believe that people are doing the best with best intents but the idea of analyzing multiple data is different than what many of us did with just math and math and literacy scores and

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:35.309
Models that you're following and sharing with people, I think are very, very helpful as people get into multiple measures.

01:19:35.869 --> 01:19:38.091
And I heard Riverside County say a couple of things.

01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:40.313
Let me just say, I've been to their college and career network.

01:19:40.413 --> 01:19:43.036
The energy in those room is amazing.

01:19:43.396 --> 01:19:45.198
And the trust and the collaboration that.

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:46.499
that network has.

01:19:46.599 --> 01:19:55.404
And what I've heard from educators and leaders around the state is these networks and collaborative are wonderful ways to get support to support the local efforts.

01:19:55.484 --> 01:19:59.846
So I've just felt the energy and I think the Riverside team is a wonderful model.

01:20:00.187 --> 01:20:03.929
But I also heard them say, and again to build on my colleague's comments,

01:20:04.429 --> 01:20:12.013
they're focusing on the data and the multiple measures, and they're focusing on the school and the local classroom data.

01:20:12.033 --> 01:20:15.055
And I think that's important for the particular subgroups.

01:20:15.095 --> 01:20:20.817
And both presentations I thought highlighted what else technology has done beyond what the state provides.

01:20:20.877 --> 01:20:27.841
And so I just asked to assess the shares, their models, and I'm assuming at the sixth meeting next week that's likely to happen.

01:20:27.881 --> 01:20:31.343
Also, there's a state superintendent's meeting, so I don't know if we were planning to share,

01:20:32.003 --> 01:20:41.888
I'm assuming that people want to know what's happening in local districts that they can share and just to see what technology can do to provide the opportunities to drill deeper.

01:20:41.909 --> 01:20:54.535
And then I also heard Riverside talk about a use of protocol to follow that they're sharing protocols to give districts and sites because I think I really believe people do want to do the best but they don't necessarily know how to do it differently.

01:20:54.675 --> 01:20:57.197
It's new and we've asked from the board level to

01:20:57.677 --> 01:21:11.347
what are the models we're sharing with people, but we're a really big state, 58 counties, so the model of doing some exemplars and networks and protocols and then sharing, I think, is so important to help everyone get better at that.

01:21:11.407 --> 01:21:17.211
So, again, the focus on student group performance, I think, is really to our hearts of

01:21:18.252 --> 01:21:23.454
we don't wanna lose groups in high performing or schools where we want to make sure we're focusing on the needs.

01:21:23.494 --> 01:21:30.777
And I appreciated the breakout also on special ed, because we know special ed has been quite forefronts for many districts.

01:21:31.057 --> 01:21:36.859
They hadn't paid maybe as close attention or they thought they were dealing with it through IEPs and specialized support.

01:21:37.279 --> 01:21:43.502
And yet, I think we are in a transition to say, no, this is a responsibility of everybody, not just a special ed.

01:21:44.142 --> 01:21:48.664
special educators, all core teachers have responsibility for English learners or special needs.

01:21:49.185 --> 01:22:07.975
So the fact that the data is providing that I think is a really good model and I would just ask that as we continue to see these wonderful exemplars both county-wise and school district-wise that we do share it not just in webinars but here publicly so that we can over the next few years really strengthen the skill set and the knowledge and the strategies.

01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:22.482
Also, I appreciated the connection to the system of support because people I think now are saying so like what does this mean what kind of support and so to the Riverside team who put that particular day together and showed how all the components.

01:22:22.882 --> 01:22:24.003
I think you really provide.

01:22:24.603 --> 01:22:25.043
leadership.

01:22:25.123 --> 01:22:33.727
I believe in success and across our state, but as well to provide districts in a variety as I know you have a few large, but you have lots of small districts too.

01:22:33.767 --> 01:22:40.170
And I think as I've talked with county supes and superintendents within counties, they have to differentiate as well.

01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:43.252
So they don't have big teams in some cases in small districts.

01:22:43.312 --> 01:22:43.432
So

01:22:43.932 --> 01:22:47.675
Again, that willingness to share and model for us, I think is what we're all about.

01:22:47.715 --> 01:22:50.937
I just have to say, this is what we were hoping for.

01:22:50.997 --> 01:22:54.820
I know we're early in the process and I look forward to the March presentations.

01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:12.151
I would just ask CDE as you continue to outreach, that you continue to share the bigger picture at the state level with the combination of what is happening county and local wise so that we can share that and also understand for ourselves the impact as we hope to impact the local practice.

01:23:12.692 --> 01:23:12.932
Thank you.

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:14.722
Board Member Sun.

01:23:15.763 --> 01:23:16.183
Thank you.

01:23:16.203 --> 01:23:21.987
So I have to echo what all my fellow colleagues, board members have said already.

01:23:22.067 --> 01:23:26.630
Again, as Board Member Burr said, this is what local control looks like.

01:23:27.011 --> 01:23:35.636
And the level of ownership and the robust data sets that you've produced at that level to meet your needs, it's amazing.

01:23:35.696 --> 01:23:42.521
And it's great to see the framework that the state has set to support and develop that.

01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:49.349
And so, and especially as a practitioner myself and doing a lot of work at my school level,

01:23:50.586 --> 01:23:57.010
I thought we were all that with what we were doing, and then I'm looking at the work that you've done, and I thought, oh, we could do that.

01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.851
That's awesome.

01:23:58.311 --> 01:23:59.472
So thank you very much.

01:23:59.532 --> 01:24:00.513
It's very inspiring.

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:18.564
You know, it's a very inspiring presentation, and yet, and this might also kind of foreshadow a little bit of our discussion for item five, is that, you know, what I still hear is a lack of trust that

01:24:19.605 --> 01:24:21.827
Gosh, could the school district really do it?

01:24:21.927 --> 01:24:24.689
Will they put their blinders on and not really recognize?

01:24:24.729 --> 01:24:29.873
Can we trust that they're going to move in this self-improvement process?

01:24:30.393 --> 01:24:34.056
And so we do know we need to provide a lot of support.

01:24:35.097 --> 01:24:44.243
So I guess, I think maybe the counties, because of your perspective on all the different districts and schools that you're working with, I'd like to ask a couple things.

01:24:44.484 --> 01:24:44.664
One is,

01:24:46.605 --> 01:24:52.768
Have you had experience with a district or a school that's just not willing to look at its information?

01:24:52.788 --> 01:25:00.572
And what's been your experience with that as far as the information coming, that's come out?

01:25:00.592 --> 01:25:03.374
Yeah, I guess it would be Riverside.

01:25:03.854 --> 01:25:04.274
Yeah.

01:25:08.857 --> 01:25:10.358
Have you noticed the hesitancy?

01:25:10.418 --> 01:25:10.618
Yeah.

01:25:12.606 --> 01:25:17.748
I will say I don't know that we've had a district that has verbally said we're unwilling to look at our data.

01:25:18.469 --> 01:25:28.553
There are systems that we have in place with our collaboratives and networks that really there's no way not to look at your data because that embeds everything that we do.

01:25:29.453 --> 01:25:38.557
I will say though, as with any county, there are differing levels of capacity and ability to be able to look at that data and analyze it appropriately.

01:25:39.057 --> 01:25:53.732
So, as one of the board members said, we do need to differentiate because there are different levels of expertise, different levels of knowledge, and sometimes even a different level of willingness to understand exactly what the data is saying.

01:25:54.293 --> 01:25:58.136
And so, as a county office, we're there to differentiate to support in that area.

01:25:59.017 --> 01:25:59.378
Very good.

01:26:01.069 --> 01:26:01.910
I appreciate that.

01:26:02.050 --> 01:26:23.005
And then I guess the other piece, too, is that there's the concern that identification of schools, that the support would be very narrow, that if, say, for instance, we identify a school is identified based on one subgroup or student group, that the technical assistance would just go in and focus just on that specific student group.

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:37.350
And nothing that I've heard or seen from the support that we've said that it would just be that narrow because I think we know that the indicators and they overlap in many, many ways.

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:46.813
So while a school could be identified by a certain subgroup, that when there is a support, we're taking a holistic approach and look at it.

01:26:46.893 --> 01:26:52.375
And I think that's been the philosophy and I think that's been what our intent has been.

01:26:54.016 --> 01:26:55.538
in the support system that we have.

01:26:55.558 --> 01:26:58.401
Okay, thank you.

01:26:58.622 --> 01:27:01.105
Board member Valdez is next.

01:27:03.314 --> 01:27:21.128
So I have the unique opportunity because I'm part of Riverside County, I say I'm part of the county, but part of really working well with this wonderful, talented, dynamic group who have been at the forefront and I think and they really work collaboratively with districts and so I'm one of the districts that's been able to partake in all of this.

01:27:21.868 --> 01:27:26.452
And so I really commend you and it was really nice to hear your story today and it was fun to watch you present.

01:27:27.832 --> 01:27:30.573
I think one of the things is today's national Winnie the Pooh Day.

01:27:30.593 --> 01:27:31.433
I don't know if you know that.

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:38.314
So here's a quote from Winnie the Pooh and it says, you're braver than you believe, you're stronger than you seem, and you're smarter than you think.

01:27:38.734 --> 01:27:41.034
And I think that's what Riverside County Office is doing.

01:27:41.074 --> 01:27:55.637
They're making, helping districts feel that way and with all of the tools and the resources and the ongoing communication and the just-in-time meetings, the networks, the PLNs, all of those things that you are growing and fostering

01:27:56.497 --> 01:28:06.762
I think your sense of wonder as a county office has really helped push you forward in front of all of the CCESA and the CISC opportunities that you've had.

01:28:06.802 --> 01:28:08.203
So I want to congratulate you on that.

01:28:08.223 --> 01:28:10.644
And I'm really proud to be part of Riverside County.

01:28:11.544 --> 01:28:20.849
And with that empowerment, I was with an assistant superintendent yesterday who had been in one of your meetings, your first meetings of differentiated assistance.

01:28:21.269 --> 01:28:23.569
And I have to tell you, he was just so thankful.

01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:26.290
And it wasn't like, oh, I went to this meeting and I got in trouble.

01:28:26.690 --> 01:28:28.570
It was like, I really see where we can go.

01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:33.571
And so I think that's what we're trying to do is in the spirit of moving forward, how do we move forward together?

01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:37.912
And I think the approach is not that you have all the answers, but together we're going to figure it out.

01:28:38.252 --> 01:28:40.113
Here's some tools to really dig down deep.

01:28:40.433 --> 01:28:43.693
And that ultimately, your vision is that it gets down to teaching and learning.

01:28:43.733 --> 01:28:46.194
And I really think that that's a true

01:28:46.594 --> 01:28:48.235
hallmark of a good county office.

01:28:48.976 --> 01:28:52.918
One of the questions I have is on the guidance document that CCESA put together.

01:28:52.938 --> 01:29:09.510
I know in one of the letters that I read, and I think it's a good recommendation, something like that at the district level, because the facilitation skills, again, countywide, it's important to have that calibrated and an opportunity for different county offices to have that kind of a resource.

01:29:09.570 --> 01:29:10.991
And I really think that down at the

01:29:12.112 --> 01:29:17.598
at the LEA level, and then it would certainly impact at the school level facilitation guides.

01:29:17.638 --> 01:29:26.629
I think that's one thing that I think everyone can get better at, and especially as we're really wanting to be inclusive of all stakeholders, so that's another piece.

01:29:27.129 --> 01:29:48.787
And then finally, I really think that John Curry, you really modeled the way your data, and I really applaud you for really taking on that from the legal definition, if you will, of what MET means to actually breathing life into it and really being the transparency of showing that from year to year and asking the same kinds of questions because you're really looking at some trend data.

01:29:48.807 --> 01:29:50.028
So thank you for that.

01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.149
But anyway, thank you.

01:29:56.164 --> 01:30:02.527
I wanna get back to the question of the dashboard and the design, and I'm glad to hear that there may be some funding to do that.

01:30:03.567 --> 01:30:10.390
I think that it's great for us to take some of the lessons learned and some of the practices and really think of how we could use that to enhance the dashboard.

01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:22.035
Because not every district has the capacity, the resources, and I think it was mentioned, the will to really take this information and really delve into the data.

01:30:22.455 --> 01:30:35.043
So I want to see how we could use some of these lessons and really upgrade so that it's not a bright spot in the state that has access to this great information and practices, but that it becomes, again, the standard of the state of California.

01:30:36.184 --> 01:30:45.190
In looking at the equity report, I think that this is a place where I really would like us to go out to different stakeholders and think how can we better enhance

01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:52.594
this landing page because right now when I look at it, I like that we included the 5x5 into the dashboard.

01:30:53.374 --> 01:30:57.576
I wasn't able to access the Google Translator when I was looking at it.

01:30:57.657 --> 01:30:59.738
I'm not sure if there was a glitch that day.

01:31:00.698 --> 01:31:06.380
But when I look at the way that we lay out the equity report, and I've said it before, it's not intuitive.

01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:09.582
You kind of have to read everything to figure out what is this landing page.

01:31:10.142 --> 01:31:13.863
And again, as I mentioned, my focus group was my husband.

01:31:13.883 --> 01:31:16.284
He was like, what is this?

01:31:16.384 --> 01:31:17.725
And I was like, ah.

01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:25.868
So even things like changing the columns, all student performance, student groups in red and orange, and then total student groups.

01:31:25.928 --> 01:31:31.710
That's one basic small change, but that it really starts narrowing the eye to what we're hoping to accomplish.

01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:35.151
The other thing is the level of support.

01:31:35.331 --> 01:31:39.293
I think that if a school is comprehensive or targeted, that should be

01:31:40.073 --> 01:31:42.334
very clearly stated in the equity report.

01:31:42.374 --> 01:31:44.996
I think that is accountability, that is transparency.

01:31:45.016 --> 01:31:51.999
I think that there's better ways for us to really hone in on what equity means when we're looking at this landing page.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:58.563
And I think that, again, we've made some great changes and enhancements, but we really should be listening to what others have done.

01:31:59.023 --> 01:32:00.704
And it shouldn't be just a bright spot.

01:32:00.744 --> 01:32:11.628
It should be something that all of our students have access to, regardless of the county office, regardless of the LEA, and regardless of the people who may have a will to really look at your needs and understand the root cause.

01:32:11.968 --> 01:32:13.689
Because root cause is an interesting thing.

01:32:13.769 --> 01:32:19.392
People could look at data and say, well, of course, they're getting suspended at a disproportionate rate.

01:32:19.472 --> 01:32:20.432
They're oppositional.

01:32:21.412 --> 01:32:30.475
Of course, this student is, that is not a root cause, that is an assumption, but that is a lens that some folks could look at this data with.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:43.119
And so we need to make sure that not only do we have common practices and common systems, but a common mindset where we're looking at data and really owning what we've contributed to those outcomes.

01:32:43.559 --> 01:32:43.819
Thank you.

01:32:45.396 --> 01:32:48.378
OK, that concludes, I think, the comments on this.

01:32:48.418 --> 01:32:50.719
We're now ready for public comment on this item.

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.101
With the following people, please line up.

01:32:56.862 --> 01:33:01.864
Sheila Whitley, Doug McCray, Eric Adams, Liz Guillen, and Brian Rivas.

01:33:02.084 --> 01:33:03.105
You have one minute to speak.

01:33:12.528 --> 01:33:15.851
I'm Sheila Whitley and I'm here speaking on behalf of CTA.

01:33:16.772 --> 01:33:29.382
Our area of concern with this accountability system is really in the area of how we measure growth and the status for our subgroups for our English language learners.

01:33:30.342 --> 01:33:40.410
This is an area that a lot of schools and districts have been working with and we're not sure that we really have adequately indicated a correct measurement for measuring their growth.

01:33:40.951 --> 01:33:41.271
Thank you.

01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:48.641
Good morning.

01:33:48.681 --> 01:33:51.203
I'm Doug McRae, retired testing specialist from Monterey.

01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:57.847
At your board meeting two months ago, I commented on the data integrity issues of the academic indicators on the dashboard.

01:33:58.989 --> 01:34:02.531
particularly the 2017 Smarter Balanced Gain Scores.

01:34:03.192 --> 01:34:06.414
I followed this with further written material on the problem on November 22.

01:34:07.475 --> 01:34:13.619
No action or information on this problem has been forthcoming from either the CDE or Smarter Balanced until this morning.

01:34:14.999 --> 01:34:19.482
I submitted a handout for this item to your electronic folder last week consisting of

01:34:20.643 --> 01:34:34.297
Strongly worded op-ed published January 4th, as well as a one-page support letter from the Commissioner of New Hampshire calling for an opening of the wall with secrecy for technical information on this Dean's Corps problem.

01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:38.326
to get to the bottom of the problem as soon as possible.

01:34:39.327 --> 01:34:48.475
I think this gain score problem could be correctable within a few weeks if it indeed involves, in effect, scoring keys for the 2017 administration.

01:34:49.496 --> 01:34:53.359
I'd urge the State Board to follow New Hampshire's lead on this issue.

01:34:53.859 --> 01:34:55.861
I'll have more on this issue for Item No.

01:34:56.161 --> 01:34:56.862
6 today.

01:34:57.723 --> 01:34:58.003
Thank you.

01:35:01.724 --> 01:35:02.304
Good morning.

01:35:02.725 --> 01:35:04.405
Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

01:35:05.926 --> 01:35:21.274
We, too, are really excited about some of the bright spots in the way the dashboard is being rolled out and implemented and the information is being used to take actions for improvement.

01:35:22.775 --> 01:35:34.865
I do want to however call out that the some of the items that member Ortiz-Licón mentioned are things that our community partners are also struggling with.

01:35:36.266 --> 01:35:43.532
To have the dashboard and even to show that there are a certain number of student groups that are showing red and

01:35:43.992 --> 01:35:51.694
and orange is good, but the impact of that and what that means needs to be more transparent.

01:35:51.754 --> 01:35:59.717
So in the same way the state is having to communicate this new system and what its meaning is and isn't,

01:36:00.397 --> 01:36:03.040
to districts and counties.

01:36:03.881 --> 01:36:06.824
It needs to do that with parents in the public.

01:36:07.705 --> 01:36:15.292
So we would agree that the dashboard could be more transparent that way and especially around the level of support.

01:36:16.293 --> 01:36:16.694
Thank you.

01:36:22.975 --> 01:36:23.796
Good morning, everyone.

01:36:23.836 --> 01:36:27.180
My name is Eric Adams and I'm a site organizer for youth together in California.

01:36:28.061 --> 01:36:40.795
And I just wanted to say voice my appreciation for the addition of the chronic absence indicator to the dashboard I think coming from a place like Oakland, knowing that chronic absence does overlap with so many different issues graduation, even just

01:36:41.916 --> 01:36:42.377
performance.

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:55.727
I'm really happy to see that there, but I will say that I would like to see more clarity and transparency, like has been said before by a few other folks with this, especially making it more accessible to families and stakeholders.

01:36:56.888 --> 01:37:05.795
Throughout the year, this year, through our listening campaign and other organizing work, we've been able to get a keen eye and capture from some of the families that we work with and students

01:37:06.415 --> 01:37:10.339
that the dashboard is difficult to understand and that it's actually kind of hard to navigate.

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:15.424
Also that they would like more pictures to be associated with some of the data, especially in the local context.

01:37:16.706 --> 01:37:21.991
I also really appreciated one of the comments made about trust by Ms.

01:37:22.011 --> 01:37:22.271
Sun.

01:37:22.872 --> 01:37:24.994
And I think that honestly there are, sorry.

01:37:26.115 --> 01:37:32.362
There is a lot of distrust from families and communities that needs to be allayed before something like the dashboard can be really successful.

01:37:33.083 --> 01:37:39.690
Also, looking at the ways in which LCAP has been created to be something that is collaborative, we need much more collaboration.

01:37:40.411 --> 01:37:42.173
I want to piggyback on a statement made earlier.

01:37:42.313 --> 01:37:45.036
The dashboard definitely has to exist at the classroom level.

01:37:45.296 --> 01:37:45.557
Time.

01:37:46.718 --> 01:37:46.938
Sorry.

01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:47.459
Thank you.

01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.760
Good morning, my name is Ephraim Mercado, I'm Children Now.

01:37:54.240 --> 01:38:01.022
I would like to appreciate the idea that what we just saw is a great example of local control and really shows our system is moving forward and that's fantastic.

01:38:01.622 --> 01:38:08.203
We also feel that the funding in the January governor's budget will allow more county offices to increase their capacity to do what Riverside County is doing.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:20.265
We'd also like to double down on the idea and the expectation from State Board and CDE that the dashboard will be impacting the LCAPs of districts as they move into this new cycle, especially those that were identified for differentiated systems.

01:38:20.485 --> 01:38:20.725
Thank you.

01:38:24.107 --> 01:38:30.373
Terry Barnes, California School Boards Association and board member of the Natomas Unified School District and I want to tell you that it is being used.

01:38:30.873 --> 01:38:47.168
Last night I sat through two hours of presentations from each of our elementary schools where they showed us their dashboards, where they were, where they talked about what they're doing to help bring up those areas where we have weaknesses and celebrated what they're doing well.

01:38:48.308 --> 01:38:58.898
It really is able to go out into the community, talk about our strengths and weaknesses, see it very visually, and encourage public participation in that process.

01:38:58.918 --> 01:38:59.779
So I want to thank you.

01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.180
We're working.

01:39:01.941 --> 01:39:02.922
We're early at this.

01:39:03.262 --> 01:39:06.805
We know we're early at this, but it is doing what you want it to do.

01:39:06.986 --> 01:39:07.266
Thank you.

01:39:12.158 --> 01:39:16.242
President Kirst, I'm Brian Revis speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

01:39:17.002 --> 01:39:20.906
I want to compliment you and your staff for the presentation this morning.

01:39:22.087 --> 01:39:24.909
Ed Trust West loves to see that kind of engagement with the data.

01:39:25.689 --> 01:39:30.614
We want to see more of it, and I think you asked the right questions about whether or not this is the standard.

01:39:31.194 --> 01:39:39.141
If not, that's the standard we want to strive for, and it raises questions about district capacity and will to do that kind of data analysis.

01:39:39.901 --> 01:40:01.156
We have a recommendation for you that I think would help to integrate the dashboard with the system of support and make it a little easier to understand, and that is add to the dashboard when an LEA is identified for assistance, note that so that people have an idea of what's going on overall and how it relates to the system of supports.

01:40:01.557 --> 01:40:01.857
Thank you.

01:40:03.476 --> 01:40:09.061
All right, that concludes the public comment and the board will recess now till 1020.

01:40:10.382 --> 01:40:11.483
Board member Holliday.

01:40:11.503 --> 01:40:12.404
Sorry.

01:40:12.484 --> 01:40:13.665
I could just make one quick comment.

01:40:14.366 --> 01:40:15.887
It's not just about local control.

01:40:15.947 --> 01:40:16.848
It's about ownership.

01:40:17.569 --> 01:40:30.822
And what we're seeing here are individuals, counties and districts and schools and teachers and parents taking ownership of the data, taking ownership of their plan, taking ownership of how they look at the data and how they apply it.

01:40:31.383 --> 01:40:32.024
That's huge.

01:40:32.524 --> 01:40:33.805
Instead of the top down,

01:40:34.886 --> 01:40:40.969
process where there's always the enemy and we don't want to look at the data because, you know, it scares us.

01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:42.990
Now it is part of us.

01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:44.771
We now take ownership of it.

01:40:44.871 --> 01:40:48.313
And that's a major shift that leads to all sorts of good changes.

01:40:48.753 --> 01:40:56.977
And one of the changes that we saw is that county offices and districts are able to decide

01:40:57.777 --> 01:41:02.858
how they're going to analyze the data in different ways that meet their needs in particular.

01:41:02.898 --> 01:41:04.419
So there's built-in flexibility.

01:41:05.059 --> 01:41:08.280
So ownership and flexibility, I think it's a win.

01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:11.501
Well, thank you for that concluding comment.

01:41:12.321 --> 01:41:13.762
The board will reconvene at 1020.

01:41:23.484 --> 01:41:27.647
We have two opportunities to talk about special education.

01:41:28.468 --> 01:41:30.589
This one is about a federal report.

01:41:30.689 --> 01:41:31.890
We hear it annually.

01:41:33.111 --> 01:41:39.015
It hasn't been updated in a number of years in terms of the federal reporting requirements.

01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:48.175
The next item three, we can talk and there will be another presentation on system of support for students with disabilities.

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:54.218
And so I think we ought to hold the support questions for disabilities for the next one.

01:41:54.338 --> 01:42:01.362
And just here now, this federal report, which is a required set of indicators.

01:42:02.983 --> 01:42:07.305
Kristen Wright will be here from the CDE to present.

01:42:09.329 --> 01:42:10.170
Thank you, President Kirst.

01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.971
Members, are we ready to go?

01:42:12.551 --> 01:42:12.791
We're good?

01:42:12.811 --> 01:42:13.252
We're ready.

01:42:14.472 --> 01:42:17.114
So this is sort of a three-parter.

01:42:17.634 --> 01:42:23.798
This first segment that we're gonna talk about right now during this item is around our federal reporting.

01:42:23.898 --> 01:42:30.943
And as you know, we have indicators that we have to report specific data to the Office of Special Education Programs.

01:42:31.083 --> 01:42:33.064
I'm sorry, I'm Kristen Wright, Special Ed Director.

01:42:34.525 --> 01:42:35.346
Department of Education.

01:42:36.507 --> 01:42:42.292
I am joined by Shiloh Bessariel, our administrator of our data unit.

01:42:42.672 --> 01:42:48.957
When you're doing the work at the federal level, no special ed state director goes anywhere without their data administrator.

01:42:49.118 --> 01:42:51.079
They're joined at the hip.

01:42:51.239 --> 01:42:58.285
Today, because this is really her baby, if you will, she will be presenting the actual data points.

01:42:58.446 --> 01:43:00.507
She'll be able to answer specific questions about that.

01:43:01.568 --> 01:43:02.669
So, back to the three parts.

01:43:02.729 --> 01:43:05.632
The first one is a data submission that's due February 1st.

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:08.215
That's why we're here today, to ask you to move that forward.

01:43:08.695 --> 01:43:11.638
The second piece will be in the next item around the system of support.

01:43:11.678 --> 01:43:21.008
We'll give a brief update, and then I have one of our contractors who's providing technical assistance to give you a flavor of what that looks like coming from the special ed division.

01:43:21.588 --> 01:43:35.284
The third will be next meeting, and that will be our state systemic improvement plan, our indicator 17, that will more detail the work of the special ed division and all the contracting and other things we'll be doing for next year in all of our collaborations.

01:43:36.625 --> 01:43:40.847
Before I turn it over to Shiloh, a couple of things I wanted to mention about the last item.

01:43:41.047 --> 01:43:49.350
I appreciated so much all your comments about this holistic approach.

01:43:50.031 --> 01:43:55.033
We've been talking about this for a really long time, I think a decade, and this is finally coming to fruition.

01:43:56.013 --> 01:43:57.694
One of the things I wanted to mention was

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:16.065
member Rucker's use of the term appropriate use of the data and we worry in special ed that the data doesn't become about blaming a group of students but rather an opportunity to address more supports and needs for a particular student group.

01:44:16.585 --> 01:44:25.770
And so we've had the opportunity to talk with Riverside, too, and see all the incredible work they're doing to desegregate the data, to really use the data that you're gonna be hearing about today.

01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:31.012
Because all of these data come from individual student records and IEPs.

01:44:31.052 --> 01:44:33.133
And so this is the real data for the state.

01:44:33.193 --> 01:44:35.754
This is each and every student in our state.

01:44:36.195 --> 01:44:38.596
But we do run the risk of, you know,

01:44:39.216 --> 01:44:52.026
as we start to desegregate, especially by disability category, to blame certain categories of students when each disability category really spans the gamut of students with very significant support needs and very mild support needs.

01:44:52.426 --> 01:45:06.716
So making any kind of generalizations about a particular disability category is a little bit of a slippery slope, but if we're looking at it from the extent of looking at how we're doing programming and what we need to beef up for support, so if we see

01:45:07.837 --> 01:45:19.042
certain indicators that students with autism are far underperforming, that is a huge indication that maybe we want to look at our programs that serve students with autism and how we're serving students with autism and in what environment.

01:45:19.422 --> 01:45:25.185
So, it's so much about how the conversation is couched that is so crucial in all of this work.

01:45:26.565 --> 01:45:32.490
Also, appreciating Member Strauss' comments about accountability of all teachers.

01:45:32.791 --> 01:45:47.484
We're really moving in a direction in the state around credentialing to really empower all teachers to be able to teach the full range of student needs, and then having our special ed teachers come in as those special ed ninjas that we've talked about in the past.

01:45:48.084 --> 01:45:56.290
We're looking at that in the same way for how the special ed division works and how we support LEAs coming out of the special ed division.

01:45:56.730 --> 01:46:12.360
So you'll hear more about that in the system of support, but I just wanted to say that in that we're not sending everyone off that 163 districts into special ed land, but we're collectively taking responsibility and we're working closely with the CCE and all of our partners to make sure that that happens.

01:46:12.741 --> 01:46:17.264
So we're not just creating that bifurcated system again that we're trying to connect.

01:46:18.385 --> 01:46:27.704
So, I am going to go ahead and empower Shiloh to come and talk to you, and I will see you at the end of this item and next item.

01:46:27.764 --> 01:46:28.606
So, thank you for having us.

01:46:32.079 --> 01:46:32.960
I'm a little bit shorter.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:33.540
Sorry.

01:46:34.441 --> 01:46:35.742
Thank you, board members.

01:46:35.782 --> 01:46:36.902
My name is Shiloh Besreel.

01:46:37.062 --> 01:46:39.564
I am the Data Administrator for Special Education.

01:46:39.684 --> 01:46:47.290
So my responsibility is to collect all data on students with disabilities in California and report that both to the public, to the state, and to the federal government.

01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:48.510
Kristen was right.

01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:49.471
This is my baby.

01:46:50.012 --> 01:46:54.895
When I came to the CDE seven years ago, my child was one years old, and I was assigned this report.

01:46:55.195 --> 01:46:58.057
And it's kind of grown with me as I've been here seven years.

01:46:58.177 --> 01:47:00.018
So it is really my baby.

01:47:01.059 --> 01:47:04.821
I did want to kind of ground everybody in what we're talking about today.

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:12.464
We've been talking a lot about the world and how we see the world and sort of this grand scape and vision that we all have.

01:47:12.944 --> 01:47:15.925
This item that we're talking about is just one small piece of that.

01:47:16.606 --> 01:47:26.230
So just kind of making sure we're aware that we want to talk about how students with disabilities fit in the world and how we see the system of support becoming a big part of that.

01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:32.374
But today this item is just talking about one piece of the federal reporting we're required to do.

01:47:33.956 --> 01:47:37.138
People ask me a lot about how many students with disabilities we have in California.

01:47:37.598 --> 01:47:41.722
We have about 754,000 students with disabilities on any given day.

01:47:42.522 --> 01:47:45.845
So if you take a snapshot of a day, we have about 750,000 students with disabilities.

01:47:47.626 --> 01:47:49.387
That's the largest number in the United States.

01:47:50.247 --> 01:47:54.610
The next number is Texas with about 500,000 students with disabilities.

01:47:54.730 --> 01:47:58.512
So obviously we have quite a large number.

01:47:59.012 --> 01:48:01.633
And that's 10.9 of the overall student population.

01:48:03.925 --> 01:48:13.815
You're going to have to kind of bear with me a little bit today because we are still becoming familiar with the new 508 requirements for our presentations.

01:48:13.955 --> 01:48:19.060
And so a lot of the graphs and pictures that I had in my presentation previously are now turned into words.

01:48:19.381 --> 01:48:22.404
So please bear with me as it's not as jazzy as it has been in the past.

01:48:23.805 --> 01:48:34.774
So just to kind of give you a little bit of sense of how we've grown, the number of students with disabilities has increased 10% since 2005, while the total student population in California has only grown 1.3%.

01:48:34.894 --> 01:48:44.121
Of all the categories you can see, we've seen a 200% increase in the number of students with autism.

01:48:45.042 --> 01:48:48.184
And that is followed behind students with other health impairments.

01:48:48.985 --> 01:48:57.171
To help you understand what other health impairments is, that is students who have typically ADHD or other kinds of health impairments, but ADHD falls in that category.

01:48:57.191 --> 01:48:59.173
That's one of the reasons we see that large increase.

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:08.660
We've also seen an increase in our hard of hearing and some traumatic brain injury, but a decrease in some of our other populations as well over the past 11 or 12 years.

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:13.144
I like to show that because it kind of gives us an idea of what we're looking at over the period of time.

01:49:14.699 --> 01:49:25.883
If you were to think of last year, and this report and the data that I'm presenting on this report is all 16-17 data, so we're required to collect the data from 16-17 and report it to the U.S.

01:49:25.903 --> 01:49:30.725
Department of Education now in February, but it's for the 16-17 school year.

01:49:32.545 --> 01:49:34.487
So that's all where this data is coming from.

01:49:34.808 --> 01:49:48.741
When we look at the students with disabilities ages 3 through 22, we see that 39 percent of students have a specific learning disability and 21 percent have a speech and language disability followed by other disabilities you can see on that graph.

01:49:49.742 --> 01:49:52.064
People ask us a lot of time about home language.

01:49:52.164 --> 01:50:02.110
One of the things, and I'll show some data later on in the presentation, is we know about 15 to 16% of our students with disabilities are English language learners.

01:50:02.471 --> 01:50:04.352
And people often ask me, what are the home language?

01:50:04.392 --> 01:50:06.193
And we come from the home language survey data.

01:50:06.894 --> 01:50:08.555
And this is that data here.

01:50:08.915 --> 01:50:11.677
61% of our students identify their home language as being English.

01:50:12.117 --> 01:50:17.100
And 32% identify their home language as being Spanish, along with other languages.

01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.362
I couldn't list them all here, because there's very many of them.

01:50:21.303 --> 01:50:31.826
And then one of the things that is a little bit different from when we're talking about our K-12 population is that IDEA affords us the ability to serve our three to five-year-old population.

01:50:32.526 --> 01:50:35.687
And so people ask us a lot about our three to five-year-old population.

01:50:36.367 --> 01:50:42.569
So 62% of our three to five-year-olds have a speech and language impairment, followed by 24% who have autism.

01:50:43.969 --> 01:50:45.670
And then if you look at the ethnicities,

01:50:47.770 --> 01:51:01.315
You'll see that 56% of our students ages three to five are Hispanic, 23% are white, 9% are Asian, and 5% are African American, followed by the other significant races.

01:51:04.177 --> 01:51:06.580
I want to talk to you a little bit about the annual performance report.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.822
I know this is not too exciting.

01:51:07.862 --> 01:51:10.185
I'm not going to go through every single indicator.

01:51:10.225 --> 01:51:18.195
I'm going to pull out what I think are the most important indicators, especially ones that are aligning with the conversations we're having on the dashboard and the system of support.

01:51:19.036 --> 01:51:26.500
But just to kind of help you understand, we are required to submit the annual performance report to the US Department of Education on an annual basis.

01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:33.743
Failure to do so will immediately stop our funding from the US Department of Education.

01:51:33.763 --> 01:51:35.984
That's a $1.1 billion grant.

01:51:36.165 --> 01:51:41.047
98% of that flows directly to LEAs to provide services to students with disabilities.

01:51:41.127 --> 01:51:46.930
So it's really important that we prepare this report and that we send it to the US Department of Education.

01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:49.739
You all, as the SCA, must approve this item.

01:51:52.074 --> 01:52:01.222
The annual performance report consists of 17 indicators, and as we go through them, you'll see some of them are compliance, and some of them are performance, and we'll talk about them a little bit separately.

01:52:02.743 --> 01:52:07.427
Just so you know, targets for compliance are either 100% or zero, and we do not get to set them.

01:52:07.527 --> 01:52:09.970
They are set for us, either zero or 100%.

01:52:10.911 --> 01:52:13.473
Targets for performance are ones that we do get to set.

01:52:14.454 --> 01:52:17.036
We have re-benched the annual performance report

01:52:18.538 --> 01:52:22.206
targets for the performance indicators and you'll see that through the items.

01:52:23.188 --> 01:52:26.094
We benched them in 13-14 and they will be valid through 18-19.

01:52:28.689 --> 01:52:32.814
So people ask me, and LA's often ask me, where did you get this data from?

01:52:33.374 --> 01:52:37.879
The data comes from a couple of different sources, CALPADS, we get some of the data.

01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:42.684
The majority of the data comes from CASEMIS, which is our special education information system.

01:52:44.246 --> 01:52:46.188
I will tell you in 2019-20, CASEMIS will be no more.

01:52:49.111 --> 01:53:02.179
We will be collecting all the data through CALPADS starting in 2019-20, and I think that's really important to point out because we will tend to see shifts in the data as people get used to the new reporting system and how the data is going to be reported.

01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:11.025
So we expect to see a little bit of shifts in data, and we did see that when we switched suspension data over to being reported in CALPADS, and I can talk about that a little bit later.

01:53:12.045 --> 01:53:21.408
But KSMIS has been collecting data in a system since 1988, and so I think it's time for us to put that to bed and start collecting it through CALPADS.

01:53:21.448 --> 01:53:24.429
We also collect some of the data through the Office of Administrative Hearings as well.

01:53:26.530 --> 01:53:31.171
So just to kind of understand what we're talking about, we're talking about data from 2016-17.

01:53:31.231 --> 01:53:39.774
There are three indicators that we report that are lag year data, and those are reported from 15-16, and that's graduation, dropout, and suspension expulsion.

01:53:43.871 --> 01:53:45.152
Get ready for the exciting stuff.

01:53:45.352 --> 01:53:46.853
I know it hasn't been too exciting yet.

01:53:47.453 --> 01:53:57.739
So I want to talk a little bit about disproportionality, because if you look at the item, you'll see the largest increases that we saw from last year are in our disproportionality indicators.

01:53:58.299 --> 01:54:04.643
In December of 2016, the US Department of Education changed the regulation around significant disproportionality.

01:54:05.043 --> 01:54:10.346
And I was here around this time last year, and I said, OK, everybody be prepared, because it's going to be really changed.

01:54:10.506 --> 01:54:11.787
It really did change a lot.

01:54:13.408 --> 01:54:21.212
It required the use of a risk ratio for all calculations, and it required the state to set a minimum in size and minimum cell size.

01:54:22.032 --> 01:54:32.838
One of the things that's very confusing for people is we have two things, one called disproportionality, which we're reporting here, and one called significant disproportionality, which is what's changed in the regulation.

01:54:33.738 --> 01:54:38.279
Disproportionality is a one-year calculation and it is a compliance review.

01:54:38.739 --> 01:54:46.100
So we identify disproportionate districts and then we review them to determine if they had problematic policies, practices, or procedures.

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.381
Significant disproportionality is a three-year calculation.

01:54:49.721 --> 01:55:02.963
And districts who are found disproportionate are required to take 15% of their IDEA funds and use them for developing an integrated service plan, an improvement plan.

01:55:03.942 --> 01:55:12.189
So the reason I bring this up is because one of the things that we wanted to do with disproportionality is to mirror the calculations for significant disproportionality.

01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:13.250
Why is that?

01:55:13.610 --> 01:55:31.705
Because if you're a district who becomes significantly disproportionate, it would have been nice if you knew for two years that you were disproportionate and you were on the path to significant disproportionality, and you could have taken steps to identify ways to avoid that significant financial implication.

01:55:33.095 --> 01:55:41.000
So what we did is we took the regulations that Ed imposed on us through significant disproportionality, and we applied it to the one-year calculation.

01:55:42.381 --> 01:55:47.163
Just so you know, when we look at significant disproportionality, year one would be a root cause.

01:55:47.223 --> 01:56:01.432
So hopefully districts who are identified this year would look at their practices, their vision, their ingrained beliefs, and begin to change those so that they can avoid becoming significantly disproportionate.

01:56:01.972 --> 01:56:04.294
They would change some of those practices in year two.

01:56:04.454 --> 01:56:11.100
If they didn't change any of their practices by year three, they would be significantly disproportionate and find themselves with a fiscal consequence.

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:14.743
So what does that mean for this year?

01:56:15.564 --> 01:56:20.388
Last year, we had 63 districts who were disproportionate.

01:56:20.468 --> 01:56:23.290
This year, we have 945 districts who were disproportionate.

01:56:25.732 --> 01:56:33.215
So, you can see, we've seen almost a ten times increase in the number of districts who were disproportionate on that one-year calculation.

01:56:34.095 --> 01:56:45.679
And so, we have had our monitoring units go to those LEAs, look at their IEPs, and begin to determine if there's problematic policies, practices, and procedures.

01:56:46.159 --> 01:56:58.210
We're treating this as year one for most districts so that they can begin to really divide some root causes and determine if they can change their practices to avoid becoming significantly disproportionate in three years.

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:01.592
What did that mean for our indicators?

01:57:01.753 --> 01:57:10.355
Well, what it meant is that we have increases across the board in our disproportionality increase indicators.

01:57:10.575 --> 01:57:20.698
So you'll see we had some, not a big increase in indicator 4B, which is in suspension expulsion, but in indicators nine, which is disproportionate representation, we had a 2% increase.

01:57:21.838 --> 01:57:32.529
And in indicator 10, which is our disproportionate representation by disability, we had a 16% increase in districts who were identified and they had problematic policies, practices, and procedures.

01:57:33.230 --> 01:57:43.039
So the cause of that is the higher number of LEAs, but also looking at the LEAs more closely to identify those root causes identified more noncompliance.

01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:54.348
I did want to give the opportunity for people to ask questions because this has sort of been a hot topic around the world, so if anybody did have any questions about disproportionality before I moved on.

01:57:54.368 --> 01:57:57.091
Board Member Sandoval.

01:57:58.992 --> 01:58:06.058
Thank you very much for pulling this one out, and if you could just describe a little bit about the disproportionality work group that's convening, that would be very helpful.

01:58:06.909 --> 01:58:10.331
We've had a disproportionality work group that has met three times.

01:58:10.531 --> 01:58:12.272
I think we're probably going to need to meet more.

01:58:13.653 --> 01:58:25.140
One of the things that was required in the new regulation was to convene a stakeholder group to begin to examine how we were going to implement the new Department of Education regulations.

01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:27.241
So, we have convened a work group.

01:58:27.281 --> 01:58:35.727
They met one time in June of last year, one time in September of last year, and they just met, I believe, a week ago on, or earlier this week, January 16th.

01:58:36.407 --> 01:58:37.828
Sorry, things seem to be going by fast.

01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:41.891
So, and they were discussing a variety of things.

01:58:42.011 --> 01:58:43.192
One is the calculation.

01:58:43.672 --> 01:58:48.215
The other thing they've been discussing is the notification to LEAs, how we notify LEAs.

01:58:48.635 --> 01:58:53.559
And the third thing they've been discussing is how we sort of include them in our support system

01:58:54.699 --> 01:58:58.980
and our TA system once they are significantly disproportionate.

01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:18.645
I think we still need to have some discussion with the work group around the data and the calculation because one of the things we found when we identified those 945 LEAs, we had lots of very small LEAs who had maybe three students who had, they had three students who were American Indian with disabilities and one of them was suspended.

01:59:18.946 --> 01:59:20.566
So all of a sudden they were disproportionate.

01:59:20.686 --> 01:59:28.788
So I think one of the things that we've learned through this process is that we need to calibrate the calculation accurately so we're not getting very many false positives.

01:59:29.848 --> 01:59:31.489
And I think we're going to meet with the work group.

01:59:31.629 --> 01:59:40.571
And one of the things we talked about is bringing some of the recommendations from the work group back to the state board for you all to review once we have them finalized.

01:59:41.671 --> 01:59:43.451
Other questions about disproportionality?

01:59:43.471 --> 01:59:45.992
Board Member Rucker.

01:59:48.922 --> 01:59:50.403
Hi Shiloh, how are you doing today?

01:59:50.963 --> 01:59:56.766
As you know, this is an issue that I have been monitoring and bird-dogging with the staff for quite a while.

01:59:57.266 --> 02:00:16.256
And one of the concerns I have is not just how this information will impact the way districts are represented and reported in this report, but I want to understand how does it also inform conversations that districts have about the student subgroup of students with disabilities.

02:00:16.736 --> 02:00:27.585
In particular, how does it inform the work that they write about and the decisions that they're making with regard to their LCFF and any of the intervention or support that they probably are going to need on this?

02:00:28.125 --> 02:00:45.840
The reason why I'm asking is because the other thing that I've noticed is since we have over 700,000 students with disabilities, what I have noticed is that in the reports that have come from a separate division about the use of accessibility tools, that doesn't really seem to match up.

02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:55.951
And as a matter of fact, a lot of those supports and interventions for those students is relatively low, given the number of students we have with disabilities on any given day.

02:00:56.551 --> 02:01:07.043
This report is probably one of the most significant reports that districts are on the hook for contributing data to for the state to submit, and it has almost immediate impact

02:01:08.604 --> 02:01:09.586
for accountability.

02:01:09.986 --> 02:01:25.466
So I want to understand how districts are then informed to make what they're reporting on this information a priority as they're turning around and developing information or concerns just for priority with these students in their LCAPs.

02:01:26.325 --> 02:01:29.706
I think this year, well, I wanna answer your question in kind of two parts.

02:01:29.826 --> 02:01:32.607
One, I think this year has been really enlightening for lots of districts.

02:01:32.627 --> 02:01:43.331
Because when we had 63 districts who were disproportionate last year, and now we have a whole new set of over 900 that were disproportionate, it was like, oh my gosh, this is something I really have to look at and pay attention.

02:01:43.711 --> 02:01:47.753
And what we've heard from districts was like, we have to have the hard conversations.

02:01:47.853 --> 02:01:53.775
And when we were talking, we've been talking with CESA about this information, we've been talking about CCE with this information, it's like,

02:01:54.355 --> 02:02:03.137
This is the first time they're having to really have a hard look at some of their practices of their suspension, their identification around race or ethnicity.

02:02:03.417 --> 02:02:16.640
So I think as districts are starting to go through that root cause analysis process that they were identified, especially the ones who are identified for differential assistance, they're going to be looking at their disproportionality numbers and their significant disproportionality.

02:02:17.060 --> 02:02:21.244
The second part of that that I want to answer is you may or may not know the U.S.

02:02:21.264 --> 02:02:26.988
Department of Education has issued a request for comment to delay the implementation of these regulations.

02:02:27.789 --> 02:02:46.164
We as at the Special Division has determined that we will not be following that delay and that we will go along with the original intention of implementing the regulations starting in July 1, 2019 because we just feel like it's a really important issue that people need to look at and delaying it wasn't going to help anything.

02:02:46.804 --> 02:02:48.706
So I'm kind of looking at it that way.

02:02:50.669 --> 02:02:50.989
Thank you.

02:02:51.009 --> 02:02:52.130
That's very, very good to know.

02:02:53.243 --> 02:03:02.088
Okay, so moving on to some of the other parts of the report, I do also always wanna show some of the good things that we've been doing in terms of compliance.

02:03:02.428 --> 02:03:15.255
Last year when I came to you all, I said, oh, you know, we're having some real hard times getting the infants transferred to the preschool program in a timely manner and we'll be working with the regional centers and the Department of Developmental Service.

02:03:15.295 --> 02:03:17.076
Well, good news, it seems to have been working.

02:03:17.116 --> 02:03:19.578
We see an 8% increase in the number of students

02:03:20.038 --> 02:03:23.741
who are transferring from the infant program into the preschool program on a timely manner.

02:03:24.041 --> 02:03:25.963
And it's really important when that occurs.

02:03:26.343 --> 02:03:30.466
The other thing I like to show is our indicator 13 is our secondary transition indicator.

02:03:30.826 --> 02:03:35.150
That's whether or not students have a transition plan by the time they're aged 16.

02:03:35.810 --> 02:03:37.952
We are about as close as you can get to 100%, 99.8%.

02:03:38.052 --> 02:03:45.358
So actually I'm really proud to see that still increasing in terms of having transition plans.

02:03:45.738 --> 02:03:49.541
When we talk about college and career readiness, this is a step in that direction.

02:03:51.448 --> 02:04:00.590
Okay, so I'm gonna talk a little bit about some of the performance indicators, and I'm aligning some of this with some of the indicators that are also in the LCFF and the dashboard.

02:04:01.050 --> 02:04:03.250
So I wanted to talk to you all about graduation rates.

02:04:03.370 --> 02:04:11.912
So we have, this is the graduation data from, again, this is lag year data, 2015-16, and we have a 65.5%, a 1% increase from the previous year.

02:04:18.073 --> 02:04:20.715
not a huge increase, but it is moving in the right direction.

02:04:20.775 --> 02:04:22.937
So I like to always point that out.

02:04:23.557 --> 02:04:26.299
Remember that this is a four year adjusted cohort rate.

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:32.864
And so oftentimes our students with disabilities take five or six years to graduate with a diploma.

02:04:33.264 --> 02:04:43.992
And so really understanding that process as well is that you are including, there's students who are not included in this rate who have graduated with a diploma because they took five or six years.

02:04:44.052 --> 02:04:45.413
We keep students until they are 22

02:04:46.454 --> 02:04:49.303
in the hopes that we can get them moving towards the direction of a diploma.

02:04:51.690 --> 02:05:02.880
One of the things I'd also like to point out is that our statewide participation rate, we did make the participation rate for ELA, but unfortunately we did not make it for math.

02:05:03.361 --> 02:05:06.343
We have to be at 95%, so we were pretty close, 94.6%.

02:05:08.345 --> 02:05:17.954
But in terms of our assessment criteria and whether or not students are meeting the standards, we are finding that in ELA, students are for the most part meeting our targets.

02:05:19.015 --> 02:05:32.575
One thing that's typically pointed out to us and we acknowledge is that the targets are relatively low, so we do want to continue to increase those targets over time once we are required to look at those targets again.

02:05:34.418 --> 02:05:40.366
starting in 18-19, we'll have to begin to re-bench our targets because the new requirements around targets will come out from the U.S.

02:05:40.386 --> 02:05:41.287
Department of Education.

02:05:41.688 --> 02:05:48.898
We hope to be able to kind of re-bench those targets, but the good news is that districts are making progress year after year in the assessment indicator.

02:05:49.799 --> 02:05:51.882
So that's one thing that I think is really important to point out.

02:05:53.394 --> 02:06:01.340
So one thing that is sometimes a little bit hard for people to understand is our suspension and expulsion data that we report.

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:08.364
Now, we have seen an increase in the number of students who are suspended greater than 10 days this year.

02:06:09.605 --> 02:06:14.369
And that is obviously disappointing for us because we would like to see that decrease.

02:06:16.169 --> 02:06:23.071
One factor that may contribute to this is we started collecting this data in CALPADS.

02:06:23.611 --> 02:06:34.373
And so one of the things that we often found is that many of you work at LEAs, you know LEAs have two systems for sometimes collecting data on students with disabilities.

02:06:34.393 --> 02:06:37.434
They have a student information system and electronic IEP system.

02:06:38.294 --> 02:06:41.896
And the suspension expulsion data is collected in the student information system.

02:06:41.976 --> 02:06:47.899
And sometimes the individuals who are collecting that data don't always know the rules and requirements around students with disabilities.

02:06:48.639 --> 02:06:57.223
And so we've been working with LEAs to help understand and cross-train their data folks to make sure that this data is entered correctly.

02:06:57.243 --> 02:07:03.146
Because we have seen an increase just as switching over from K-SMIS to CALPADS in collecting this data.

02:07:03.686 --> 02:07:07.308
And I think a lot of it has to do with really understanding and having that training position.

02:07:07.688 --> 02:07:20.018
But also I think working with LEAs to really recognize that some LEAs have very high suspension rates, and high suspension rates among some of their most vulnerable populations.

02:07:20.318 --> 02:07:25.783
And so if you're implementing things like PBIS, the expectation is that you reduce those suspension rates.

02:07:27.004 --> 02:07:37.675
And I think Kristen is gonna touch a lot about on some of that, I'm not sure, either in the next presentation or next time when we come for this statewide systemic improvement plan.

02:07:39.812 --> 02:07:42.473
Indicator 5, I also want to bring up this one.

02:07:42.693 --> 02:07:46.234
We look at three things for Indicator 5, which is least restrictive environment.

02:07:46.554 --> 02:07:51.055
The students who are 80% or more of the day in a regular class, which is what we would want to see.

02:07:51.595 --> 02:07:57.776
Students who are less than 40% of the day in a regular class, those are typically students who are what's called a special day class.

02:07:58.597 --> 02:08:03.038
And then students who are in separate schools, residential facilities, or homebound hospital placements.

02:08:05.138 --> 02:08:09.361
One of the things I'll point out, and I'll show this in a graph a little bit here, is that we have seen an increase.

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:10.582
We are meeting the target.

02:08:11.362 --> 02:08:20.308
But in terms of our targets for 80% or more of the day in a regular class, the targets are still relatively low.

02:08:20.348 --> 02:08:23.931
We're seeing incremental increases, not huge increases.

02:08:24.031 --> 02:08:34.758
So we're hoping, again, more of the discussion that's happening around the state system of support will help broaden students' access to a regular classroom and regular peers.

02:08:35.258 --> 02:08:36.940
Yeah, I have a question on this one.

02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:45.468
Do you know how we rank nationally on this indicator in terms of the least restrictive environment?

02:08:46.649 --> 02:08:48.711
Compared to other states is what I'm, yeah.

02:08:49.382 --> 02:08:50.683
For the most part, we're very low.

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.244
I don't have the exact number.

02:08:52.264 --> 02:08:53.484
Very low, meaning what?

02:08:53.644 --> 02:08:59.947
So many states are in the 70% range.

02:09:00.287 --> 02:09:03.809
70% of their students are in the classroom more than 80% of the day.

02:09:04.249 --> 02:09:05.830
So I would say we were about middle of the pack.

02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:08.431
I'm happy to bring back the exact spot where we land.

02:09:08.751 --> 02:09:09.792
I haven't analyzed that data.

02:09:10.092 --> 02:09:14.294
But many states have more students in the regular classroom than we do.

02:09:14.654 --> 02:09:18.016
And that's been something that's been pointed out to us by stakeholders on multiple occasions.

02:09:19.861 --> 02:09:23.824
they are, and getting more students in the regular classroom.

02:09:23.904 --> 02:09:27.187
For example, one state that's typically pointed out to us is Colorado.

02:09:27.587 --> 02:09:34.793
Colorado has something like 75 percent of their students are in the regular class greater than 80 percent of the day.

02:09:35.734 --> 02:09:37.796
Obviously, we would strive to have more of that.

02:09:44.033 --> 02:09:50.955
So there hasn't been a lot of correlations between students who are in the regular classroom and the outcomes.

02:09:50.995 --> 02:09:53.176
And so I can't actually speak to that part of it.

02:09:53.716 --> 02:10:01.378
But we would suspect that access to same age peers, access to the regular education curriculum, that is the goal.

02:10:01.418 --> 02:10:03.019
That is the belief of IDEA.

02:10:03.339 --> 02:10:11.001
And so students have access to that are more likely to do better, to progress more in their classroom with supports, obviously.

02:10:16.738 --> 02:10:18.078
I turned it on.

02:10:18.539 --> 02:10:22.341
This is a little bit off topic but it is related to the question I just asked.

02:10:22.901 --> 02:10:27.084
I was off mic when I asked how does it correlate with the outcomes that we are reporting.

02:10:27.464 --> 02:10:30.306
Because there was the Supreme Court ruling last spring

02:10:30.706 --> 02:10:35.589
concerning the higher standard for the outcomes that should be reported for students.

02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:37.290
I think that this is something that's important.

02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:52.158
It's not related to your report here, but it is a conversation we need to be aware of and that we need to monitor and look at because while I understand that we're in the middle of the pack on increasing the percentage of students who are in the least restrictive environment,

02:10:52.518 --> 02:11:09.032
I think we also have to look at what the dashboard is telling us as an indicator for the student subgroup about their performance and whether or not it's trending in the correct direction and are we on track for meeting this new higher standard created by this Supreme Court decision.

02:11:10.212 --> 02:11:20.315
Just for everyone else's knowledge, Board Member Rucker is talking about the Andrew case, which set a higher standard that students should make beyond de minimis progress.

02:11:21.035 --> 02:11:26.576
So students with disabilities, so it really set the bar higher for districts to make progress for students with disabilities.

02:11:26.636 --> 02:11:33.858
And part of that was having them have access to a regular education curriculum and ensuring that they're having access to their general education peers.

02:11:35.499 --> 02:11:45.507
I will say that one of the things that we're focusing on, and I bring up this slide here on least restrictive environment for preschool, is the least restrictive environment around preschool.

02:11:45.527 --> 02:11:51.332
So if preschool students, if we're starting off children who are ages 3 to 5 in a regular

02:11:51.892 --> 02:11:55.253
environment, if they're in an environment where they're around other peers.

02:11:55.593 --> 02:12:03.875
If you remember back to the data that I showed that the majority of students with disabilities who are ages three to five are students who have a speech and language impairment.

02:12:04.536 --> 02:12:12.898
And so we want to encourage those students to have access to a regular preschool program because that's where that language is going to flourish.

02:12:13.238 --> 02:12:20.500
That's where they're going to have real access to peers where they can understand correct language, speech, and those kinds of things.

02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:30.749
So if we are giving students who are ages three to five access, then what the expectation is when they're entering kindergarten, they should have access.

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.510
And so it's starting that period.

02:12:32.530 --> 02:12:42.079
And that's one of the areas that we really want to focus on in the division is in special education is allowing children to have access from that ages three and on.

02:12:42.679 --> 02:12:49.149
because if you have a child who's in a separate setting starting at age four, when they start kindergarten, the expectation is they're gonna be in a separate setting.

02:12:49.509 --> 02:12:54.777
And so not setting up those expectations and ensuring children have access to a regular education curriculum.

02:12:57.701 --> 02:12:58.543
Board member Holliday.

02:13:02.555 --> 02:13:15.402
well I agree with Member Rucker in that I do think often we're very well meaning and the idea sounds really great and yet we really do need to understand how these students are performing.

02:13:15.442 --> 02:13:18.064
Those who are in the least restrictive environment.

02:13:18.884 --> 02:13:25.248
I'm not an advocate for more restriction of course but at the same time are we serving them well?

02:13:25.508 --> 02:13:30.531
And so if there's any way we can get the data on that I think it would be important for us.

02:13:31.603 --> 02:13:32.103
I'll be happy.

02:13:32.344 --> 02:13:42.250
And again, we're going to be back here next, or not next month, I feel like it's March, and so we can definitely bring some of that data back, at least to survive.

02:13:43.181 --> 02:13:47.704
I am one of the board liaisons for the significant disproportionality work group.

02:13:48.124 --> 02:13:54.088
They keep scheduling the meetings on days I can't attend because my boss expects me to show up for work every so often.

02:13:54.969 --> 02:13:56.690
I know, what a mean guy.

02:13:56.710 --> 02:14:00.132
This is on TV, isn't it?

02:14:00.152 --> 02:14:01.013
He's a nice guy.

02:14:01.613 --> 02:14:02.654
He's really a nice guy.

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:04.355
I'm just saying.

02:14:05.436 --> 02:14:12.000
I do want to make sure you know I will continue working with the group and they are really doing good work and having great conversations on this.

02:14:13.083 --> 02:14:14.405
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:14:16.488 --> 02:14:27.604
I also want to know more about the data and I didn't know if this was coming with item 17 when you come back next next time because I think that if we look at the data we may find that

02:14:28.487 --> 02:14:35.432
even within this student group, I am sure there are gaps within categories and across categories.

02:14:35.832 --> 02:14:46.559
And I really wanna make sure that we keep an eye on that because when I look at language and speech, which is one of the highest categories for students three to five, that is where my son was.

02:14:47.099 --> 02:14:53.904
And I've said this before, I had my son identified at 18 months because I knew there was a delay.

02:14:56.826 --> 02:15:15.465
When I went through the IEP process, it's a very complex process, even as an educator, but one of the things that I didn't see was questions or support within the IEP, and he wasn't an English learner because he had a delay, the speech was all in English, and that became his first primary language.

02:15:16.025 --> 02:15:31.651
But I'm wondering how many of our students in this category, three to five, are ELs, and what we're doing in the IEP process to identify their needs as language learners, besides their needs as, you know, just speech needs.

02:15:31.991 --> 02:15:36.873
And so I don't know if that's part of the IEP process, and I don't know what percent of our students

02:15:37.373 --> 02:15:40.194
in language and speech are also EL students?

02:15:40.374 --> 02:15:42.214
Because it could be something that's being confounded.

02:15:42.294 --> 02:15:42.854
We know that.

02:15:43.574 --> 02:15:46.555
But I'm wondering, have we analyzed the data to that level?

02:15:46.835 --> 02:15:54.277
So one of the problems with that, and I think you bring up an excellent point, is that we don't do the LPAC until a student is in kindergarten.

02:15:54.657 --> 02:16:00.978
And so when you are making determinations about whether or not a child is EL, we have no assessment to do that.

02:16:01.398 --> 02:16:02.339
So oftentimes,

02:16:04.079 --> 02:16:20.565
LEAs might be using the home language survey as an indicator of an EL determination, and so it's not as clear as when you have a child who's K-12, because they are given the LPAC with that assessment, so determination what their level is.

02:16:20.645 --> 02:16:22.445
And so that, it's more complicated.

02:16:22.465 --> 02:16:25.866
We have some indication of the data, but it's not as clear-cut for K-12.

02:16:28.334 --> 02:16:35.840
It is a requirement to ensure that we are addressing needs on both the EL side and the students with disability side and understanding that relationship.

02:16:36.260 --> 02:16:44.707
There is currently a work group going on that are developing guidelines around EL and special ed to help better define and delineate that.

02:16:44.867 --> 02:16:47.229
So more to come on that in the near future.

02:16:48.570 --> 02:16:54.494
Sorry, just to clarify, that last piece, there was a bill that was passed that directed the department to develop a manual.

02:16:54.674 --> 02:16:56.636
So I just wanted to clarify, that's under state law.

02:16:58.737 --> 02:16:59.717
Yes, so point well taken.

02:16:59.998 --> 02:17:03.399
And will that be reflected in the IEP template?

02:17:03.419 --> 02:17:07.640
So their language needs again because when you need it.

02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:12.101
Sorry just this is getting beyond the scope of what's been noticed in the agenda.

02:17:12.261 --> 02:17:21.524
It's getting very much into specific individual student IEPs so just for Bagley Keene purposes that this is a little beyond the scope of what's been noticed in terms of reporting data.

02:17:21.544 --> 02:17:22.384
We're happy to bring that back to you.

02:17:23.085 --> 02:17:23.705
Legal alert.

02:17:23.745 --> 02:17:24.605
Thank you DASAB.

02:17:34.344 --> 02:17:34.825
Go ahead.

02:17:34.845 --> 02:17:39.128
I will say that you're not the first person that we've, and it's a concern we obviously look at as well.

02:17:39.188 --> 02:17:43.631
So I think we can bring it back in more in another iteration.

02:17:44.792 --> 02:17:48.175
Does anyone have any other questions about the annual performance report itself?

02:17:51.294 --> 02:17:57.397
Okay, I do have a couple of things that I would like to talk about in terms of preparing you for the next set of items.

02:17:57.477 --> 02:18:02.540
Because remember I showed that big picture of the planet in my first slide saying that you're talking about the world, we're talking about this.

02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:12.325
Well, people ask a lot about what's happening with students with disabilities and the LCAP and the state system report.

02:18:12.585 --> 02:18:16.287
I wanna give you some things to kind of put in your brain as you get ready for that.

02:18:16.707 --> 02:18:18.408
next set of conversations.

02:18:18.508 --> 02:18:22.870
So again, this slide isn't as jazzy as it's been in the past.

02:18:22.890 --> 02:18:27.031
It used to be called the Pac-Man slides because they look like little Pac-Mans.

02:18:27.432 --> 02:18:34.415
But just to help you understand, 10.92%, that's the number of students with disabilities we have in California compared to the overall population.

02:18:34.715 --> 02:18:40.157
When we look at the LCFF subgroups, we notice those students, those percentages are much higher.

02:18:40.217 --> 02:18:44.139
So 12% for students who are in poverty, 15% for students who are EL,

02:18:44.719 --> 02:18:49.981
English language learners, and then 25% of foster care children are students with disabilities.

02:18:50.061 --> 02:18:52.782
So there is a greater percentage.

02:18:53.062 --> 02:19:01.646
The other data that I really like to show is a lot of people say to us all the time, well, you know, all this focus on students with disabilities, what about all the other subgroups?

02:19:01.966 --> 02:19:05.147
Well, 69% of students with disabilities are in one

02:19:05.707 --> 02:19:09.348
of the LCFF subgroup, so something really important.

02:19:10.048 --> 02:19:21.672
The one thing that I did want to prepare you all for in the next sets of conversation that I think Kristen is going to be talking about is around, people ask us, well how have students been doing over time?

02:19:22.632 --> 02:19:25.033
So I wanted to bring you three sets of information to show you.

02:19:25.773 --> 02:19:28.014
You know, we at the department have been doing a lot of work.

02:19:28.624 --> 02:19:38.416
around improving performance, looking at students with disabilities, improving outcomes, but really in our own narrow focus in our siloed world.

02:19:38.957 --> 02:19:47.848
And so if you look at the work we've been doing over the last seven years, you'll notice that the data shows that we've been relatively flat.

02:19:48.588 --> 02:20:00.751
The decrease that happens in graduation from 2011-2012 happened when we implemented the four-year adjusted cohort, and since that time, we've incrementally increased, just one or two percentage points per year.

02:20:01.111 --> 02:20:02.892
We're not seeing major increases.

02:20:04.072 --> 02:20:06.332
Same thing when we talk about suspension expulsion.

02:20:06.832 --> 02:20:12.754
We've seen the suspension expulsion rate for students who are suspended greater than 10 days increase over time.

02:20:13.835 --> 02:20:18.502
And the data that I really like to show is on least restrictive environments.

02:20:18.662 --> 02:20:27.716
So when you see this, this is the data I like to show quite often, that our least restrictive environment categories have remained very flat.

02:20:28.537 --> 02:20:33.782
There's a bump here and there, but for the most part, they are very flat.

02:20:33.842 --> 02:20:44.632
When districts are doing work in a siloed environment, where special ed is expected to fix itself, what happens is you have really flat outcomes.

02:20:45.152 --> 02:20:49.357
And so we're very excited the work that's being done in the system of support.

02:20:49.697 --> 02:21:01.509
And I wanted to give you this data to kind of help you set up that conversation that you're about to have around the system of support because it really does integrate a lot of both the special education and the general education together.

02:21:01.889 --> 02:21:04.332
And I think that's really important to set forward.

02:21:04.912 --> 02:21:08.136
And then if you wanted to kind of assess that.

02:21:09.634 --> 02:21:25.144
So just a few last-minute considerations as we close this item and that is that really access to general ed begins in preschool and so just giving that last plug for really starting our students off on that trajectory.

02:21:26.605 --> 02:21:27.145
That really

02:21:30.538 --> 02:21:36.802
Our employers and community members of tomorrow are the children who share the classrooms of today.

02:21:36.862 --> 02:21:45.546
And this was really pointed out by our director of Department of Rehabilitation, Joe Xavier, who has been working with a lot of employers of individuals with disabilities.

02:21:45.947 --> 02:21:51.870
And in order for people to believe that people have potential, they have to see that potential as they're growing up with them.

02:21:52.350 --> 02:22:01.339
So, if they've been separated from them their whole lives and they suddenly arrive, they don't understand individuals with disabilities or how to support them in employment.

02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.482
Also, that equity and diversity apply to disability.

02:22:04.822 --> 02:22:06.224
I know we're preaching to the choir here.

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:11.966
But sometimes we get that we have the equity and access conversation without people with disabilities.

02:22:12.026 --> 02:22:14.607
And so just always want to make sure we're part of that conversation.

02:22:15.067 --> 02:22:21.609
And again, thank you for supporting the notion that really the task force brought to light, which was we are one coherent system of education.

02:22:21.629 --> 02:22:24.370
And we've seen so many incredible, positive changes.

02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:29.231
And a lot of that is due to your support and continued drive to bring that home.

02:22:29.291 --> 02:22:30.271
So thank you so much.

02:22:32.252 --> 02:22:36.513
Are there further board comments on this presentation before we go to public comment?

02:22:38.419 --> 02:22:40.562
Okay, not seeing any, we're ready for public comment.

02:22:42.223 --> 02:22:44.206
We have three speakers for public comment.

02:22:44.406 --> 02:22:48.050
Gina Plate, Terry Burns, and Jim Anderson.

02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.831
Please line up.

02:22:49.091 --> 02:22:49.772
You have one minute.

02:22:54.037 --> 02:22:58.379
Good morning, President Kurtz, Superintendent Gillis, and members of the board.

02:22:58.399 --> 02:22:58.999
My name's Gina Platon.

02:22:59.019 --> 02:23:00.620
I chair the Advisory Commission for Special Ed.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:09.983
And I just want to start by saying how much I appreciated the discussion this morning about accountability and board member Straus' comments about how we are responsible for each and every child.

02:23:10.103 --> 02:23:14.305
It's just very exciting to hear the ongoing discussion and commitment to that.

02:23:14.945 --> 02:23:22.108
So the commission has been engaged with the department specific to the plan that you just heard our data guru Shiloh talk about.

02:23:22.948 --> 02:23:32.054
And we voted in our last meeting to support the plan and have really appreciated the transparency that the department has shown throughout the process.

02:23:32.114 --> 02:23:34.275
So I want to thank them and commend them for that.

02:23:35.316 --> 02:23:38.738
But we also see this as a call to action of sorts.

02:23:38.818 --> 02:23:41.960
And many of you have articulated something similar this morning.

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:49.285
The commission's eager to continue working with the system of support and the other stakeholders that have come together in a very collaborative way.

02:23:49.805 --> 02:23:53.528
we're ready to roll up our sleeves and continue in this conversation.

02:23:53.628 --> 02:24:01.555
So just want to encourage you to support the plan as it was presented and thank you for your ongoing discussion in this area.

02:24:09.403 --> 02:24:09.824
Good morning.

02:24:10.985 --> 02:24:11.646
I'm Jim Anderson.

02:24:11.686 --> 02:24:14.971
I'm the current chair for the Self Administrators Association of California.

02:24:15.892 --> 02:24:20.378
And we are excited in the direction that we're seeing things move towards one coherent system.

02:24:20.979 --> 02:24:23.962
We appreciate the collaborative work of the Special Education Division.

02:24:24.843 --> 02:24:33.066
There's been a lot of hard work, there's been a lot of change, and it is felt that we are truly moving towards one coherent system for students with disabilities.

02:24:34.047 --> 02:24:45.531
The shift from special education only focusing on compliance to special education and the focus for students with disabilities on performance outcomes is tremendous for our students with disabilities.

02:24:46.051 --> 02:24:52.294
And again, the leadership of the special education division, the work around understanding the data and understanding the shifts,

02:24:53.135 --> 02:24:57.464
It's tremendous, and we look forward to further collaboration and continued hard work on this.

02:24:58.225 --> 02:24:58.466
Thank you.

02:25:05.103 --> 02:25:08.705
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

02:25:08.725 --> 02:25:22.290
I want to thank the Special Ed, the Division for Children with Exceptional Needs, we're going to keep calling it, and Kristen and Shiloh for their tremendous work and leadership in this area.

02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:28.693
Really appreciate the efforts by both the Governor and the Board to create a more integrated system and provide some resources to

02:25:29.213 --> 02:25:31.775
to help our most underserved students.

02:25:32.576 --> 02:25:43.943
But I do wanna echo the comment and I was very pleased that Shiloh raised it relative to smalls who have been designated as disproportionate because it is often one student that's doing that.

02:25:44.023 --> 02:25:54.230
And so we look forward to having conversations and working with, so we wanna make sure that issues are being addressed and we do so in a way that is reflective of the circumstances.

02:25:54.310 --> 02:25:54.931
So thank you.

02:25:58.871 --> 02:26:01.292
Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

02:26:01.352 --> 02:26:07.413
And I certainly want to commend the quality of this report, the readability, the understandability.

02:26:07.893 --> 02:26:12.274
We have shared it with our members as a teaching tool and an experience tool.

02:26:12.634 --> 02:26:16.255
The issue was raised that a lot of times these students are hidden in the shadows.

02:26:16.776 --> 02:26:19.936
And if you don't have one of these students, you don't know that they're out there.

02:26:20.817 --> 02:26:26.398
We think this is a really useful tool in teaching our community about the variety of students we serve.

02:26:27.218 --> 02:26:28.779
and their very special needs.

02:26:28.799 --> 02:26:29.859
So thank you for this work.

02:26:31.519 --> 02:26:31.839
All right.

02:26:32.820 --> 02:26:38.481
This was an information item, so an action item as well.

02:26:38.521 --> 02:26:46.983
We have to approve the report for the federal government to send this plan forward.

02:26:47.123 --> 02:26:49.444
So looking for a motion on that.

02:26:51.963 --> 02:26:53.904
Yeah, I just wanted to mention, thank you.

02:26:54.004 --> 02:26:55.385
I appreciated Ms.

02:26:55.425 --> 02:26:59.247
Burns comment about using this information to inform action.

02:26:59.807 --> 02:27:01.488
So thank you for sharing this as a tool.

02:27:02.128 --> 02:27:04.049
And this is just the first segment of work.

02:27:04.869 --> 02:27:10.792
We have, they're going to be coming back on indicator 17, which is actually a plan for how do we address these issues.

02:27:10.852 --> 02:27:18.176
So while we've seen incremental improvements in some areas, we do have a lot of work to do clearly, but we will be

02:27:18.776 --> 02:27:21.578
looking at that in more depth in March.

02:27:22.279 --> 02:27:27.782
So I move approval of the CD's recommendation to approve the executive summary for FY16-17.

02:27:28.363 --> 02:27:34.127
Second by Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:27:34.707 --> 02:27:36.048
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:27:37.788 --> 02:27:39.009
OK, that is approved.

02:27:39.169 --> 02:27:40.511
And now we're on to item three.

02:27:40.571 --> 02:28:03.031
Before we have our presentation, I wanted to note that Governor Brown's proposed budget, released last week, has proposed more than $70 million in ongoing state funding to implement the state system of support, including around $55 million for county offices of education to provide differentiated assistance

02:28:04.211 --> 02:28:16.205
$4 million for LEED County Offices of Education to support the work of their peers, and more than $11 million in ongoing funding for the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

02:28:17.486 --> 02:28:22.650
There will be more details released on this proposal very soon.

02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:27.292
It's called the budget trailer language and that will sketch out the details.

02:28:27.993 --> 02:28:41.441
So that's a context setting for the item on the integrated system support and Melanie will present for CDE and then we will have several guest presentations.

02:28:44.144 --> 02:28:44.664
Good morning.

02:28:45.265 --> 02:28:46.746
I'm very excited to be here.

02:28:51.729 --> 02:28:54.550
We might have to work off a PDF instead of my PowerPoint.

02:28:55.251 --> 02:28:57.792
It seemed to have disappeared, but that's all right.

02:29:02.315 --> 02:29:06.158
Do you mind if we take, it's a PDF though, sometimes it gets awkward.

02:29:06.958 --> 02:29:09.760
So if you don't mind if I take 20 seconds just to make sure of the PowerPoint version.

02:29:33.717 --> 02:29:35.678
All right, good morning.

02:29:35.858 --> 02:29:38.818
President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

02:29:39.159 --> 02:29:41.199
Oh, thank you.

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:42.760
I'm gonna do it again.

02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:46.881
The screenshot here is... Is it wonky?

02:29:52.282 --> 02:30:02.205
You know, I... See, you call on the magic of Cindy and it just comes, it just comes forward.

02:30:04.062 --> 02:30:05.383
And look, it's even gonna go forth.

02:30:05.423 --> 02:30:05.883
Okay, thank you.

02:30:05.943 --> 02:30:10.326
And you know, I have to say, there were two board members that did see me here at 8 a.m., trying to make sure I had my right side.

02:30:10.366 --> 02:30:12.048
So, you know I take this very seriously.

02:30:13.408 --> 02:30:17.471
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

02:30:18.192 --> 02:30:19.393
I am very excited to be here.

02:30:19.673 --> 02:30:24.236
I am Melanie Sheppy, the Director of the Improvement and Accountability Division here at CDE.

02:30:25.197 --> 02:30:31.241
And I'm happy to present an update on California's system of support for local educational agencies and schools.

02:30:33.345 --> 02:30:41.929
Today is a unique presentation because we're able to pull together chunks of information that you all have discussed and digested since July.

02:30:43.210 --> 02:30:47.932
It's an opportunity to tie together those big pieces of information so that we can see the big picture.

02:30:48.373 --> 02:30:58.038
I think it's so valuable that the Riverside County Office of Education presented earlier because really their work is living out these pieces of the system of support.

02:30:58.498 --> 02:31:00.459
So for those of you that are really concrete,

02:31:00.979 --> 02:31:04.601
I think their presentation gives you a way to visualize these pieces in action.

02:31:04.841 --> 02:31:11.564
And for those of you that are maybe more high-level and want to see the larger picture, the next few minutes will help you see that larger statewide view.

02:31:11.724 --> 02:31:20.528
And so just keep that Riverside presentation in your mind as we go from the high-level, state-level view of the pieces to then what is that looking like in practice.

02:31:23.129 --> 02:31:48.415
After I present on pulling those pieces together, we'll pause for questions and discussion, and then we'll have Peter Birdsaw and Ed Manansala from the El Dorado County Department of Education to talk about the work to support County Offices of Education with differentiated assistance, and then we'll end with an update on the California Department of Education Special Education Division's evolution of their support, which Kristen and Shiloh set up in the item before mine.

02:31:51.187 --> 02:31:56.632
In July, we started very high level with the goal for the system of support, and you'll see that on the screen.

02:31:57.994 --> 02:32:10.305
And even though I, Melanie Sheppy, am presenting today, I cannot stress enough that this work is really the result of collaboration between all the state agencies and stakeholder input in conversation.

02:32:10.605 --> 02:32:13.048
And this work will continue to develop in that way.

02:32:14.662 --> 02:32:31.494
As I have personally discussed this goal in a variety of settings, the focus on building capacity so that communities can continue to improve on their own is one aspect of the goal that resonates across stakeholder groups, from district office staff to teachers to advocacy groups.

02:32:32.810 --> 02:32:35.132
This is the goal and this is what we're working towards.

02:32:35.552 --> 02:32:44.800
It's a way to test our actions so that we can ask ourselves if what we're developing or implementing is aligned with what we value and where we want to be, where we want to go.

02:32:46.602 --> 02:32:52.887
You saw this slide earlier when Riverside County Office of Education talked about their levels of support to districts and schools.

02:32:54.228 --> 02:32:59.433
And even though the goal we just talked about is helpful, it wasn't enough to shape a new reality.

02:33:01.121 --> 02:33:08.767
The new reality of accountability and continuous improvement in California is really what the local control funding formula statute set the foundation for.

02:33:10.008 --> 02:33:13.951
And so we start with the goal, but then we think about levels of support.

02:33:15.653 --> 02:33:27.042
These levels are very similar to an RTI, or a response to intervention, or an MTSS, multi-tiered system of support, approach to education that we see districts and schools striving for today.

02:33:28.291 --> 02:33:29.571
You begin with level one.

02:33:30.372 --> 02:33:34.133
Level one is the support that is available to all districts and schools.

02:33:35.054 --> 02:33:39.755
When you think of the classroom, it's the teaching, it's the support that's available to all the students.

02:33:41.436 --> 02:33:51.199
However, beyond the support for all districts and schools, the local control funding formula statute identified that some LEAs are going to need additional support.

02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:55.061
And that's where we get to differentiated assistance or level two.

02:33:56.590 --> 02:34:08.837
again making the parallel to the classroom, you will have a group of students that will need additional support and the teacher will work to address that in tutoring or have a different scaffolding or building of prior knowledge to address that specific group's needs.

02:34:10.638 --> 02:34:14.200
One thing that's really important and I know I'm speaking to the choir when I talk about this,

02:34:15.285 --> 02:34:23.356
But in a multi-tiered system of support model and approach to education, level two support really leverages what's happening in level one.

02:34:23.976 --> 02:34:33.429
So if we think about the classroom, the teacher is leveraging what they're doing whole group, but then meeting the needs of their students perhaps in a smaller group setting or perhaps with supplemental text.

02:34:34.619 --> 02:34:46.443
And I think you can see California trying to live out this approach and this value through the expansion of the SUMS cohort, or the MTSS cohorts, through the Orange County Department of Education.

02:34:48.164 --> 02:34:57.067
The Orange County Department of Education has committed to adjusting the requests for applications for Cohort 3, so they've done Cohort 1 and 2, and now specifically for Cohort 3,

02:34:58.755 --> 02:35:05.702
Priority will be given to any school district that's been identified for differentiated assistance based on the fall 2017 dashboard release.

02:35:06.643 --> 02:35:18.295
And I think this is a perfect example of California trying to live out a model of a multi-tiered system of support by leveraging support that's in level one for districts that are identified for additional support.

02:35:19.403 --> 02:35:32.246
And districts who go through that Cohort 3 process will also have their county office of education going through that with them side by side, because they're doing that work understanding the data and underlying causes together.

02:35:32.627 --> 02:35:33.227
So that's one way.

02:35:33.247 --> 02:35:40.229
We're not just sending them off to Cohort 3, but it's leveraging what we have for everyone for specific groups of LEAs that need additional support.

02:35:42.009 --> 02:35:43.229
Beyond the levels of support,

02:35:45.794 --> 02:35:53.358
We made sure that we tried to bring forward to the public the results of learnings from previous school and district change efforts.

02:35:53.798 --> 02:35:55.799
And you'll probably remember us talking about this earlier.

02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:07.946
Two of the biggest learnings is that we need to build district capacity to support schools, rather than focusing on schools in isolation, and that we can't create a one-size-fits-all approach to improvement work.

02:36:08.806 --> 02:36:18.210
I think we've heard loud and clear, we need expectations and quality to improvement work, and that's something we need to make sure we continue to focus on, but that it also needs to be able to adjust to local needs.

02:36:18.250 --> 02:36:29.754
And I think you can hear how Riverside County Department of Education has done that, and also in previous presentations from Mary Barlow from Kern County, and when Ed Menanzales spoke with us a few months ago for El Dorado County.

02:36:30.574 --> 02:36:30.714
Yeah.

02:36:39.401 --> 02:36:39.561
Hi.

02:36:39.902 --> 02:36:40.602
How are you?

02:36:40.722 --> 02:36:42.343
It's cutting off for people that are watching.

02:36:42.804 --> 02:36:44.485
They can't see the bottom bullet.

02:36:44.505 --> 02:36:45.486
It's a PowerPoint, right?

02:36:47.647 --> 02:36:48.568
Oh, OK.

02:36:50.450 --> 02:36:51.250
Let's see here.

02:36:52.431 --> 02:36:53.552
Oh, this is a PDF document.

02:36:55.153 --> 02:36:56.654
Yeah, let me see here.

02:37:00.818 --> 02:37:06.442
Well, let's bring it down to there and then full screen it right here.

02:37:07.543 --> 02:37:07.903
What's that?

02:37:08.303 --> 02:37:09.144
Right here.

02:37:13.746 --> 02:37:21.753
It's a PDF, so it's a matter of having to find the right size for this.

02:37:22.634 --> 02:37:26.177
And when you full screen it, it resizes again.

02:38:09.386 --> 02:38:13.108
So again, a few months ago, we put forward the research, and stakeholders found it really digestible.

02:38:13.128 --> 02:38:14.008
It was about four pages.

02:38:14.068 --> 02:38:19.571
WestEd helped us synthesize it, and I know it resonated a lot with your experiences in previous school and district change efforts.

02:38:23.168 --> 02:38:33.677
So we've talked about the goal, we've talked about the levels of support, we've talked about how it's moving forward, we're learning from previous change efforts, but we're also regularly incorporating stakeholder feedback.

02:38:34.297 --> 02:38:50.030
And so the first few bullets here, stakeholders asked for, when we asked them what does support look like, they want more assistance conducting needs assessments, developing action plans, protected time and support of how to create the space for data analysis, not only among staff but with communities.

02:38:51.011 --> 02:38:52.153
Sharing of best practices.

02:38:52.213 --> 02:38:53.735
I think I heard loud and clear.

02:38:53.915 --> 02:38:58.561
Don't just tell me what best practice you're using, but how did it become a best practice at your site?

02:38:58.601 --> 02:39:04.269
Tell me about your improvement journey so that can inform some of the barriers that I might have to overcome in my improvement journey.

02:39:07.257 --> 02:39:20.266
One thing I want to make sure I highlight, it's the last bullet, and it's one thing we're hearing currently from stakeholders, and they're asking for more support in helping build the capacity for districts or local educational agencies to engage with stakeholders throughout the LCAP process.

02:39:20.806 --> 02:39:31.574
And so I think it's our responsibility, all the state agencies, to think about, well, what capacity building can we help support so that LEAs are able to authentically engage with their communities throughout the LCAP process?

02:39:34.963 --> 02:39:50.626
So from here, we talked about the shifts to improvement, because it's not only important to learn from past practices, but also to instill that into guiding principles for the future, especially because folks only know what they've experienced, and we're really trying to help paint a vision of how work can be different.

02:39:51.735 --> 02:39:56.359
The shifts to California's approach to improvement combine what we've learned and what stakeholders have asked for.

02:39:57.200 --> 02:40:01.765
And it's through the actual work currently underway between counties and districts that we see these shifts taking place.

02:40:02.365 --> 02:40:05.188
Now I'll have to say, I'm a very optimistic person.

02:40:05.948 --> 02:40:08.171
I bring a lot of enthusiasm and joy to the work.

02:40:08.791 --> 02:40:11.033
But as you all know, this work is hard.

02:40:12.234 --> 02:40:13.335
This work is challenging.

02:40:14.577 --> 02:40:20.740
I think with each shift here, you can think of all the challenges associated with working in that new way.

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:28.863
So thinking about support providers working alongside LEAs, that creates authentic, that needs authentic relationships.

02:40:29.403 --> 02:40:36.546
And I've heard a lot of county offices talk about, I'm working on my relationship with my district so that they trust me as we're looking at their data together.

02:40:37.307 --> 02:40:39.008
And relationship building is hard.

02:40:39.968 --> 02:40:41.609
And so I say that because

02:40:42.609 --> 02:40:46.590
This approach to improvement is very different from past efforts and it's a big shift.

02:40:47.371 --> 02:40:55.293
But it's our responsibility to make sure that we're taking steps to make sure leaders in education and in the field can take on this shift.

02:40:55.833 --> 02:41:01.875
We can't just paint the future and then let people try to create it without additional specific concrete support.

02:41:02.756 --> 02:41:06.657
So today I'll highlight just a few of the steps that the different state agencies have taken

02:41:16.836 --> 02:41:26.543
So I can highlight today a few of the concrete steps that we've taken to make sure these shifts aren't just aspirational principles, but real things that we can see living out in improvement work.

02:41:27.103 --> 02:41:38.732
The first one was highlighted earlier, and that's the CDE dashboard webinars, including making sure we focused on how do you combine the dashboard and the LCAP process and the physical LCAP template.

02:41:39.412 --> 02:41:43.193
There's also the CCEE, California Collaborative for Educational Excellence trainings.

02:41:43.994 --> 02:41:44.714
They're spring trainings.

02:41:44.774 --> 02:41:48.135
I was just part of their dashboard update training last week.

02:41:48.675 --> 02:41:51.917
But also on February 8th, they have a data and evaluation training.

02:41:51.957 --> 02:41:57.859
And we know we've heard from stakeholders, we want more support in thinking about how to evaluate some of the work we're doing.

02:41:58.914 --> 02:42:07.045
We also have an RFA, a request for application, that just went out yesterday for the funds that were in AB99 to create equity teams.

02:42:07.746 --> 02:42:15.838
And that's specifically helping build not only county capacity, county office capacity, but also making sure there's direct connection to work in schools and districts.

02:42:17.301 --> 02:42:28.087
And then finally, just as one additional example, the county offices of education have had incredible improvement science trainings to build the capacity of county office staff and also peer-to-peer efforts.

02:42:28.247 --> 02:42:39.933
So I had the privilege of being a part of the LCAP directors meeting, I think it was last month, and every county first shared out in their region the struggles and the positive aspects of the initial outreach to districts.

02:42:40.970 --> 02:42:42.350
And then they shared out a whole group.

02:42:43.171 --> 02:42:51.613
And I think one board member asked earlier, I think it was board member Sun, about districts, the willingness and the trust to look at the data together.

02:42:52.033 --> 02:42:58.575
And you could hear counties authentically sharing both the positives and the struggles of even that initial conversation.

02:42:59.195 --> 02:43:00.776
and you can see them brainstorming in regions.

02:43:01.217 --> 02:43:16.649
So I know it's not perfect, and I know we'll have a lot of more work to do, but I think it's important to highlight that we put these shifts forward, but then we're trying to take concrete steps so that it really can live out through the improvement work between counties and districts.

02:43:20.738 --> 02:43:30.882
One other piece we put forward in a board item and that we all discussed together were the elements of support when you think specifically about differentiated assistance.

02:43:31.462 --> 02:43:33.663
Because I think for level one, people understand that.

02:43:33.783 --> 02:43:35.204
Okay, it's what we're doing for all.

02:43:35.264 --> 02:43:38.205
You can almost make a parallel to any system or any support structure.

02:43:39.325 --> 02:43:48.169
But we really wanted to be more clear about what we're talking about for the differentiated assistance process and what would happen at each part of the process.

02:43:49.147 --> 02:43:54.356
You'll remember we've brought up several counties to talk about what their work looks like and how they're organizing to support this.

02:43:55.418 --> 02:43:57.962
One thing is I was going over the slides like the hundredth time.

02:43:58.803 --> 02:44:02.369
One thing that stood out to me on this slide was that the review of data.

02:44:03.604 --> 02:44:07.971
So we're talking about what specifically is happening in differentiated assistance level two.

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:13.078
Review of data and understanding underlying causes being a huge cornerstone of that work.

02:44:13.579 --> 02:44:17.505
And that's what we're expecting to happen in level one with all districts and schools.

02:44:17.565 --> 02:44:18.907
So again, just an example.

02:44:19.628 --> 02:44:27.475
California is trying to leverage what should happen for all districts and schools for those identified for differentiated assistance.

02:44:27.716 --> 02:44:28.957
So you're still looking at your data.

02:44:29.037 --> 02:44:33.161
You're not doing something else, but you're looking at your data with the support of your county office.

02:44:34.101 --> 02:44:43.330
I just think that the more we can make those levels clear and show how we're trying to leverage level one for level two support, the more it will show that California is trying to walk the walk, trying to talk the talk.

02:44:46.010 --> 02:44:50.939
One of the last pieces I'll go over are the possible examples of support and assistance.

02:44:51.180 --> 02:44:52.422
This is in the November item.

02:44:53.544 --> 02:44:56.390
I've had several people ask me, but what happens if it's a one-time issue?

02:44:57.654 --> 02:45:03.759
It's not very lengthy for each of these examples of support and assistance, but I think it is clear.

02:45:03.820 --> 02:45:16.511
And so oftentimes I've said, oh, well, if it's a one-time unique situation, I would imagine that after understanding that, your county office would then, you know, check in with you on how your plan is going to address that one time.

02:45:16.911 --> 02:45:23.096
Because if it's a one-time situation, but you never address it, it's gonna be a one-time situation again, and then we're gonna have a pattern.

02:45:23.777 --> 02:45:29.039
So this is a nice place for folks to go if they, you know, they say, well, what if it's persistent issues?

02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:36.662
What if it's something that the school and the county, or I'm sorry, the district and the county can't really address together?

02:45:37.743 --> 02:45:44.806
And I think what's important is that these examples help show that there's not a clear cookie cutter response.

02:45:45.606 --> 02:45:57.617
if you get to that point where a district has a need and the county office can't directly provide the support for that need for whatever reason, that there's not, then do this, then follow this checklist.

02:45:57.717 --> 02:46:05.524
Instead, it's really the collective responsibility of the state agencies, and one of the primary reasons we created the cross-agency group

02:46:06.204 --> 02:46:07.085
is to discuss that.

02:46:07.785 --> 02:46:09.047
Here's a district that has a need.

02:46:09.667 --> 02:46:11.188
How can we get that need met?

02:46:11.489 --> 02:46:15.372
Is there a partnership that that county office can engage in to support the district?

02:46:16.133 --> 02:46:20.977
Is it an initiative that they don't have access to because they weren't in first round, but we can expand that?

02:46:21.537 --> 02:46:33.767
So I think this concept of mutual accountability and all the state agencies being in regular communication and collaboration so that we can work together to get districts what they need just in time

02:46:34.716 --> 02:46:39.720
is really also part of a cornerstone of a multi-tiered system of support approach.

02:46:40.721 --> 02:46:46.465
You need to have everyone in regular communication about the folks that you're trying to get support to.

02:46:52.610 --> 02:46:56.153
So just for my part, just I wanna close with, what does this all mean?

02:46:56.173 --> 02:46:58.114
And we talked about this at our last meeting in December.

02:46:59.235 --> 02:47:03.639
I think we cannot stress enough that this means that LEAs are the primary drivers of assistance.

02:47:04.872 --> 02:47:10.076
That the LCAP process is the place to identify needs, goals, outcomes, and resources.

02:47:11.257 --> 02:47:14.139
And that support opportunities must be leveraged across California.

02:47:14.159 --> 02:47:15.860
And I tried to give examples of that today.

02:47:18.082 --> 02:47:24.126
We do continue to hear questions about the roles and responsibilities of the agencies charged with support.

02:47:25.627 --> 02:47:31.632
Specifically, thinking about how are we gonna make sure that they have the capacity to provide the support that districts need.

02:47:33.387 --> 02:47:51.529
The overview I provided today ideally responds a little bit to that question, and hopefully the updates that you'll hear next from Peter Birdsall, Ed Manansala, and Kristen Wright and Kristen Brooks from the Special Education Division will continue to respond to that question about the roles and responsibilities of the agencies.

02:47:53.379 --> 02:48:01.282
But as I said, we do not have a clear cookie cutter approach that says these are the needs people have and this is how each agency will respond.

02:48:01.883 --> 02:48:11.487
Instead, we're trying to be in deep relationship with districts and then make sure county offices are connected to the resources they need so that we can get districts what they need just in time.

02:48:12.067 --> 02:48:17.850
And if we find that we don't have it, then we try to create it or we try to make sure that need doesn't go unmet.

02:48:20.832 --> 02:48:24.356
I just really want to stress that there's so much more work to do.

02:48:25.277 --> 02:48:40.652
Today's presentation was really to try to pull together the pieces that we've talked about over the last four meetings, and hopefully with this update we'll be able to continue to not only talk about the work that needs to be done, but the evolution of the work and be able to talk about how are we making sure

02:48:41.212 --> 02:48:44.097
that the work is of high quality across California?

02:48:44.117 --> 02:48:48.685
Because I know that's a question you all have asked and one that's also on top of everyone's mind.

02:48:52.401 --> 02:49:01.264
One demonstration I will have, because I think it's important when I say there's a lot of work to do, to then highlight some of the work we've done to respond to the needs out there.

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:09.928
So I'm gonna pause for questions, but then I will go into a GIS demo, a Geographical Information System demo.

02:49:10.868 --> 02:49:17.911
And this is a tool that responds directly to stakeholders who have asked for assistance and understanding where are people doing this well,

02:49:19.651 --> 02:49:21.652
Where are the support opportunities that are out there?

02:49:22.092 --> 02:49:23.312
What does all of this look like?

02:49:23.533 --> 02:49:31.516
So I will do that next, but I do want to pause before I get into that tool to answer any questions you have or just to, President Christy, encourage any board member discussion.

02:49:31.836 --> 02:49:32.096
Right.

02:49:32.496 --> 02:49:43.800
I think this is a good place to stop because we have another group of students here to be honored and it's on item four, the Senate Youth Students.

02:49:44.041 --> 02:49:47.362
And so I think before we take the questions, we can do that and then

02:49:47.902 --> 02:49:51.905
the students can get on to their other needs of the day with their award.

02:49:51.985 --> 02:49:59.411
So I'm going to turn it over to Superintendent Torlakson to handle this part of the... So we're moving to item four temporarily.

02:49:59.491 --> 02:50:00.992
We will go back to item three.

02:50:03.038 --> 02:50:04.199
Thank you, President Kirst.

02:50:04.299 --> 02:50:11.763
And this is always a fun opportunity to see bright young people who are future leaders for this state and for the United States.

02:50:12.283 --> 02:50:17.826
And Dina Fong is going to come up and just give a little background on the United States Senate Youth Program.

02:50:17.846 --> 02:50:24.650
And then I'll go up and ask each of the honorees to be recognized and tell a little bit about each of them.

02:50:24.670 --> 02:50:29.493
And then President Kirst, you and I will hand out some certificates of commendation and get a photo with them.

02:50:29.853 --> 02:50:40.640
So, Dina Fong, who runs this program, does an excellent job organizing the interview panels and hard choices because there's so many talented people in California, so many talented young people.

02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:41.201
Dina?

02:50:42.782 --> 02:50:44.643
Thank you, Superintendent.

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:51.980
Good morning, Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst, and honorable board members.

02:50:53.281 --> 02:50:55.983
As Superintendent Torlakson said, I'm Dina Fong, the U.S.

02:50:56.003 --> 02:50:57.745
Senate Youth Coordinator for California.

02:50:58.485 --> 02:51:05.170
And today is a special day and one of my favorite days that we have here to honor our United States Senate Youth students.

02:51:05.791 --> 02:51:10.375
To give you some background, the United States Senate Youth Program is sponsored by the U.S.

02:51:10.415 --> 02:51:14.118
Senate and funded and administered by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.

02:51:14.878 --> 02:51:29.359
Now in its 56th year the program provides an opportunity to selected students to gain an in-depth view of the Senate and the federal government as well as provide a foundation for those considering a future in public service on the local, state, and national level.

02:51:30.180 --> 02:51:36.885
High school juniors and seniors are nominated by their principal to apply for this highly competitive merit-based program.

02:51:37.505 --> 02:51:49.293
To qualify, students must hold student body office or another elected or appointed position in their communities and show academic interest and aptitude in government, history, and politics.

02:51:50.133 --> 02:51:59.840
Our students have gone through a rigorous application process and have demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities, school and community involvement, and a desire for public service.

02:52:00.681 --> 02:52:04.043
The last phase of the program is to formally present our 2018 U.S.

02:52:04.063 --> 02:52:07.406
Senate Youth Delegates and Alternates.

02:52:07.966 --> 02:52:12.410
These students are among the best of the best in their school, community, and the state.

02:52:13.011 --> 02:52:18.835
There is no doubt that they will succeed in whatever they do and will serve their communities with passion.

02:52:19.918 --> 02:52:31.362
Our two delegates will represent California during an all-expenses-paid trip this March in Washington, D.C., where they will see national government in action and hear from senators, cabinet members, and other officials.

02:52:33.502 --> 02:52:41.025
They'll each receive a $10,000 college scholarship for undergraduate studies with encouragement to study coursework in political science and history.

02:52:41.885 --> 02:52:46.467
Now, I'd like to invite Superintendent Torlakson to come forward so he can introduce the students to you.

02:52:47.187 --> 02:52:47.487
Thank you.

02:52:53.052 --> 02:52:54.033
Thank you, Dina.

02:52:54.073 --> 02:52:57.035
And it's a pleasure to introduce each of the four to you.

02:52:57.075 --> 02:52:58.997
And I'll start with Mackenzie Hawkins.

02:52:59.857 --> 02:53:04.721
Please come forward and stand here as I read a little bit about your background and your aspirations.

02:53:05.700 --> 02:53:06.300
Nice to meet you.

02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:07.440
Congratulations.

02:53:08.281 --> 02:53:14.983
Our first delegate is Mackenzie, a senior and student body vice president at Amador High School in Pleasanton, California.

02:53:15.023 --> 02:53:23.285
She's an advisor with the Diversity Week Committee and serves as delegate president to the YMCA Youth and Government Program.

02:53:24.505 --> 02:53:28.087
McKenzie has a wide variety of skills which she uses to help her community.

02:53:28.167 --> 02:53:30.388
She tutors at a local elementary school.

02:53:30.488 --> 02:53:33.649
She teaches special needs children and adults how to swim.

02:53:34.130 --> 02:53:37.911
She translates Spanish for low-income families shopping at Kohl's department store.

02:53:38.612 --> 02:53:45.895
She hopes she's working hard to attend Stanford University and major in political science and international studies.

02:53:47.817 --> 02:53:50.698
and attend a law school and get a master's degree afterwards.

02:53:51.458 --> 02:53:58.861
Then she would like to work in the nonprofit sector before pursuing a career in the State Department or United Nations and someday run for public office.

02:54:00.062 --> 02:54:00.942
Congratulations.

02:54:07.304 --> 02:54:14.587
And if you could just stand by here, I'll invite the second delegate up and we'll read a little bit, share a little bit about their background.

02:54:15.111 --> 02:54:18.956
And then we'll get all four of us and get a presentation from the president of the board.

02:54:19.476 --> 02:54:21.699
Our second delegate is Cole McCann Phillips.

And maybe a photograph.

02:59:07.092 --> 02:59:07.772
That's a good idea.

02:59:09.597 --> 02:59:10.337
Right here.

02:59:11.198 --> 02:59:11.538
Right here.

Follow us.

02:59:29.724 --> 02:59:31.164
This one's for Mackenzie Hawkins.

02:59:31.244 --> 02:59:31.744
OK.

02:59:32.925 --> 02:59:34.205
She's the one in black.

02:59:35.245 --> 02:59:36.626
Dina, can you hand those to me?

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:38.760
Thank you.

02:59:39.281 --> 02:59:42.042
And I'll give this one to Mr. President Kirsch.

02:59:42.082 --> 02:59:44.743
OK, where do you want the framing?

02:59:45.384 --> 02:59:46.184
OK, by the flag.

02:59:46.204 --> 02:59:49.686
So I think I do have Mackenzie's first.

02:59:50.126 --> 02:59:53.368
Yeah, Mackenzie's to get hers first from President Kirsch.

02:59:53.508 --> 02:59:56.709
Congratulations again.

02:59:56.769 --> 02:59:57.770
Hang on a second.

02:59:57.850 --> 03:00:00.111
You guys are just going to share.

03:00:00.131 --> 03:00:01.772
Do you want to go down?

03:00:01.832 --> 03:00:04.033
I took a few classes here last summer, so.

03:00:04.073 --> 03:00:05.794
You know, he's a Stanford man.

03:00:06.094 --> 03:00:06.474
Oh, really?

03:00:06.574 --> 03:00:07.435
I've been here for 49 years.

03:00:08.852 --> 03:00:10.734
Thank you, Mackenzie.

03:00:10.794 --> 03:00:12.055
And the next one will be Paul.

03:00:12.075 --> 03:00:15.017
Why don't you stand between us, and we'll get that photo.

03:00:45.245 --> 03:00:45.505
Got it?

03:00:45.825 --> 03:00:46.946
Thank you very much.

03:00:47.306 --> 03:00:48.486
You are so welcome.

03:00:51.087 --> 03:00:53.768
And next we have Olivia.

03:00:54.068 --> 03:00:54.549
Olivia Fu.

03:00:54.569 --> 03:00:57.310
Can you take two steps that way?

03:00:57.390 --> 03:00:57.490
OK.

03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:58.090
There, perfect.

03:00:58.150 --> 03:00:58.770
There we go.

03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:59.310
All right.

03:00:59.350 --> 03:01:00.991
We'll see you at the lunch.

03:01:01.171 --> 03:01:01.891
All right.

03:01:29.821 --> 03:01:30.601
Good.

03:01:31.162 --> 03:01:34.123
And would our student board member like to say a word?

03:01:34.983 --> 03:01:35.503
Definitely.

03:01:35.863 --> 03:01:41.585
Good to see you.

03:01:42.606 --> 03:01:45.887
Well, I'd like to commend you guys.

03:01:47.228 --> 03:01:53.050
So much potential that our generation has, but even more so that we can catalyze change right now.

03:01:53.070 --> 03:01:55.691
You guys are all doing it actively in your communities.

03:01:56.731 --> 03:01:59.052
And in the future, as you guys said,

03:01:59.824 --> 03:02:04.926
in your biographies, I'm sure you guys can do amazing things for the state, amazing things for our nation.

03:02:05.386 --> 03:02:08.367
So I'm really just so proud of each and every one of you.

03:02:09.888 --> 03:02:12.008
When I grow up, I hope I'm like you guys.

03:02:14.489 --> 03:02:17.010
Cole and Steven are actually two of my closest friends.

03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:21.992
So every day, I get to see the amazing things you're doing in the community.

03:02:22.372 --> 03:02:24.613
And Mackenzie and Olivia, even though I don't know you guys personally,

03:02:25.109 --> 03:02:27.349
I'm sure you guys are doing astounding things, too.

03:02:27.369 --> 03:02:31.290
I mean, I just heard, like, I'm sure just the surface of the things you guys are doing.

03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:32.911
So just congratulations again.

03:02:32.931 --> 03:02:33.531
I'm very proud of you guys.

03:02:33.551 --> 03:02:34.311
And have fun in Washington, DC.

03:02:34.331 --> 03:02:34.511
Thank you.

03:02:34.531 --> 03:02:34.711
Thank you.

03:02:34.731 --> 03:02:34.911
Thank you.

03:02:34.931 --> 03:02:35.111
Thank you.

03:02:35.291 --> 03:02:35.511
Thank you.

03:02:35.531 --> 03:02:35.711
Thank you.

03:02:35.731 --> 03:02:35.911
Thank you.

03:02:35.971 --> 03:02:36.391
Thank you.

03:02:36.411 --> 03:02:36.591
Thank you.

03:02:36.611 --> 03:02:36.811
Thank you.

03:02:36.831 --> 03:02:37.011
Thank you.

03:02:37.051 --> 03:02:37.272
Thank you.

03:02:37.292 --> 03:02:37.492
Thank you.

03:02:37.512 --> 03:02:37.692
Thank you.

03:02:37.712 --> 03:02:37.972
Thank you.

03:02:37.992 --> 03:02:38.232
Thank you.

03:02:38.252 --> 03:02:38.432
Thank you.

03:02:38.452 --> 03:02:38.672
Thank you.

03:02:38.732 --> 03:02:38.912
Thank you.

03:02:38.932 --> 03:02:39.172
Thank you.

03:02:39.192 --> 03:02:39.372
Thank you.

03:02:39.392 --> 03:02:39.592
Thank you.

03:02:39.612 --> 03:02:39.832
Thank you.

03:02:39.852 --> 03:02:40.032
Thank you.

03:02:40.052 --> 03:02:40.252
Thank you.

03:02:40.272 --> 03:02:40.492
Thank you.

03:02:40.512 --> 03:02:40.732
Thank you.

03:02:40.792 --> 03:02:40.972
Thank you.

03:02:41.012 --> 03:02:41.252
Thank you.

03:02:41.272 --> 03:02:41.492
Thank you.

03:02:41.512 --> 03:02:41.732
Thank you.

03:02:41.752 --> 03:02:41.932
Thank you.

03:02:41.952 --> 03:02:42.133
Thank you.

03:02:42.153 --> 03:02:42.353
Thank you.

03:02:42.373 --> 03:02:42.593
Thank you.

03:02:42.613 --> 03:02:42.853
Thank you.

03:02:42.873 --> 03:02:43.173
Thank you.

03:02:43.193 --> 03:02:43.373
Thank you.

03:02:43.393 --> 03:02:43.593
Thank you.

03:02:43.613 --> 03:02:43.893
Thank you.

03:02:43.913 --> 03:02:44.873
Thank you.

03:02:44.933 --> 03:02:45.553
Thank you.

03:02:45.593 --> 03:02:46.053
Thank you.

03:02:46.073 --> 03:02:46.553
Thank you.

03:02:46.573 --> 03:02:46.753
Thank you.

03:02:46.773 --> 03:02:46.953
Thank you.

03:02:46.974 --> 03:02:47.174
Thank you.

03:02:47.194 --> 03:02:47.454
Thank you.

03:02:47.474 --> 03:02:47.774
Thank you.

03:02:47.794 --> 03:02:47.994
Thank you.

03:02:48.054 --> 03:02:48.234
Thank you.

03:02:48.254 --> 03:02:48.434
Thank you.

03:02:48.454 --> 03:02:48.674
Thank you.

03:02:48.694 --> 03:02:48.874
Thank you.

03:02:48.894 --> 03:02:49.094
Thank you.

03:02:49.114 --> 03:02:49.374
Thank you

03:02:49.827 --> 03:02:51.168
It's like you got paparazzi.

03:03:22.126 --> 03:03:23.107
Thank you.

03:03:23.127 --> 03:03:23.567
Thank you.

03:03:23.667 --> 03:03:23.808
Sure.

03:03:52.449 --> 03:03:55.090
Okay, Melanie, if you can come back up.

03:03:55.650 --> 03:04:10.355
I think we're ready for... We're now returning to item three on our agenda and we will have initial set of questions on the first presentation if the board has any questions for Melanie.

03:04:10.535 --> 03:04:11.255
Any questions?

03:04:13.296 --> 03:04:16.397
Seeing none, I think we can move on then if you introduce our guests.

03:04:17.709 --> 03:04:18.730
She's still finishing.

03:04:19.090 --> 03:04:20.632
Real quick, I promise.

03:04:21.372 --> 03:04:23.614
Can you all see the GIS map on your TV?

03:04:24.455 --> 03:04:25.275
And it's good size?

03:04:25.936 --> 03:04:26.496
Okay, great.

03:04:27.357 --> 03:04:28.738
So again, my name is Melanie Sheppy.

03:04:28.758 --> 03:04:35.764
I'm the Director of the Improvement and Accountability Division, and I have the ultimate privilege to present a tool that I did not create.

03:04:36.384 --> 03:04:44.891
So this is the work of Greg Dixon and Jonathan Eisler in Cindy Kazanis' division, and I think

03:04:47.119 --> 03:04:51.301
It's a direct response to some of the resources and information that stakeholders are asking for.

03:04:52.162 --> 03:05:03.228
So again, this is a GIS map, geographical information map, and what Greg and Jonathan put together is a storyboard of different ways we could show information.

03:05:03.549 --> 03:05:04.929
This is just a demonstration.

03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:07.071
It's not the full capacity of the system.

03:05:07.671 --> 03:05:12.393
So if you have an idea of could we also map this or could we map this, the answer is probably yes.

03:05:13.034 --> 03:05:19.657
But for this presentation, so that I could show you three discrete tools, we kept it narrowly focused.

03:05:20.618 --> 03:05:24.099
So what you see on your screen is just a map of the counties in California.

03:05:26.721 --> 03:05:30.623
Now, you'll see districts that are identified

03:05:31.618 --> 03:05:33.800
for support under the local control funding formula.

03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:41.686
You'll notice the purple spaces are districts that are identified for support, and the gray spaces are districts that are not.

03:05:42.507 --> 03:05:45.389
When you have this on your computer, you can zoom in as much as you want.

03:05:45.709 --> 03:05:48.491
You'll be able to see that there's district lines in the gray.

03:05:48.572 --> 03:05:53.155
So you'll notice down here in Southern California, the gray spaces are several different districts.

03:05:54.356 --> 03:05:57.379
Up here in the middle of California, those purple spaces are different districts.

03:05:57.419 --> 03:06:00.081
So those are some of the more details you can see as you drill down.

03:06:01.994 --> 03:06:14.182
So beyond seeing spatially who's identified or who's eligible for support, you can also take that and look at, well, how many student groups met the criteria for support?

03:06:14.922 --> 03:06:22.467
So on this map, the size of the circle indicates how many student groups were identified for that district.

03:06:22.968 --> 03:06:24.649
So if you look at a larger circle,

03:06:26.428 --> 03:06:28.949
they had four to five student groups identified.

03:06:29.649 --> 03:06:33.791
Again, if you're on your computer looking at it, you can click and it will give you that information.

03:06:34.211 --> 03:06:38.513
These five student groups here are the specific ones for this district.

03:06:39.173 --> 03:06:45.196
The smaller the circle, the fewer student groups that were identified for that district.

03:06:45.956 --> 03:06:50.198
And again, we're looking at districts for this demonstration, but you can also do it at the school level.

03:06:52.082 --> 03:06:55.283
So now let's move to looking at support opportunities.

03:06:55.803 --> 03:07:04.705
So we've heard folks ask for not only information on level one resources out there, but also where do they exist across California?

03:07:04.745 --> 03:07:05.565
Do we have any gaps?

03:07:05.985 --> 03:07:15.887
So for the purpose of today, Greg only mapped one support opportunity, and that's participating in a professional learning network with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

03:07:16.228 --> 03:07:17.428
So what you see on the screen

03:07:18.669 --> 03:07:25.574
Purple districts are ones that are not participating in a professional learning network, and yellow districts are ones that are participating.

03:07:26.294 --> 03:07:32.518
And I do say I have heard many counties talk about expanding their professional learning network to include other districts.

03:07:32.578 --> 03:07:36.661
So this is just the formal count of districts that are in the professional learning networks.

03:07:36.701 --> 03:07:41.885
We know there's a lot of other informal networking and kind of growing of those participants.

03:07:42.745 --> 03:07:46.606
You could map any type of support on to this map.

03:07:46.686 --> 03:07:49.467
You could think about state-provided support.

03:07:49.507 --> 03:07:56.990
You could map networks that are out there with other types of funding or other types of organizations.

03:07:58.031 --> 03:08:04.173
Finally, the last piece I wanted to show you, people have asked for support in making connections among districts.

03:08:04.653 --> 03:08:08.214
Specifically, if I have a need, how can I find someone who's doing well in that area?

03:08:08.934 --> 03:08:10.295
And so what you'll see on the screen

03:08:12.605 --> 03:08:21.332
So this is very busy, it's a lot of colors because this is all the districts and their overall student performance on the suspension indicator only.

03:08:22.473 --> 03:08:28.878
So if you see a blue space, that's a district that has blue overall for their district suspension indicator.

03:08:29.458 --> 03:08:31.300
Again, you can do this by school site as well.

03:08:32.641 --> 03:08:40.747
Now let's say you were really interested in connecting districts who had a blue performance level with districts who had a red performance level.

03:08:43.513 --> 03:08:47.139
You can very easily see where, I felt a little magical there, right?

03:08:47.159 --> 03:08:47.740
Should I do it again?

03:08:48.140 --> 03:08:48.922
Okay, let's do it again.

03:08:50.604 --> 03:08:52.247
All right, so we start very colorful.

03:08:52.307 --> 03:08:54.410
Don't egg me on, you know I'm really gonna ham it up.

03:08:56.734 --> 03:08:58.456
So we start with all the districts and then.

03:09:00.037 --> 03:09:11.735
You can see districts specifically, thank you, Board Member Rucker, ooh, you can see specifically districts that overall their suspension indicator was red or overall their suspension indicator was blue.

03:09:11.876 --> 03:09:13.318
Again, you can do this at the school level.

03:09:14.161 --> 03:09:20.005
So we wanted to demonstrate this tool for you, also just to get your feedback if there's specific things you'd like to see mapped out.

03:09:20.525 --> 03:09:28.071
Again, this is very narrow, just to provide you three different ways that we can visualize information, and also respond directly to stakeholder feedback.

03:09:28.151 --> 03:09:35.236
I know the last CPAC, the California Practitioner Advisory Group meeting, specifically they were asking for this connection support.

03:09:35.816 --> 03:09:38.618
Can you provide me a tool so I can see connections very easily?

03:09:38.638 --> 03:09:45.002
And this is one way that we'd be able to provide that to the field in counties and districts as they're doing the work together.

03:09:45.682 --> 03:09:46.302
So I'll open it up.

03:09:46.462 --> 03:09:50.845
Any questions for my overview presentation or any comments or questions about the GIS tool?

03:09:51.165 --> 03:09:53.347
I'm sorry, President Kirsten, open it up.

03:09:54.407 --> 03:09:55.588
Board Member Rucker was first.

03:09:56.937 --> 03:09:58.818
Okay, so I have just three comments.

03:09:59.298 --> 03:10:06.902
Comment number one, in looking at this tool, I don't really understand all of the things that you just showed us, but I want it.

03:10:10.112 --> 03:10:12.793
And comment number two, now that's what I'm talking about.

03:10:13.194 --> 03:10:30.166
This is the kind of information that people keep asking to try to understand what are we doing and do we know what we're doing and what are we doing with the information that we've got to understand and give a really good profile about what's going on with our schools and where the work is going.

03:10:30.606 --> 03:10:39.633
and how to define the interlocking and overlapping levels of support that's being provided by different agencies that really shows that.

03:10:40.094 --> 03:10:45.438
And then finally, I just have to say, wow, thank you very much.

03:10:46.739 --> 03:10:47.060
Thank you.

03:10:49.742 --> 03:10:50.923
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

03:10:53.038 --> 03:10:54.519
Now this is really flirting with me.

03:10:55.020 --> 03:10:55.861
I really like this.

03:10:57.102 --> 03:11:04.288
And once upon a time, I received this degree in urban planning, GIS is, which I never really used, but go bears.

03:11:04.828 --> 03:11:06.990
And GIS is, go bears.

03:11:07.411 --> 03:11:10.093
GIS is a very powerful tool.

03:11:10.313 --> 03:11:14.617
You could overlay density, you could look at racial and ethnic breakdowns.

03:11:15.258 --> 03:11:18.921
This is a very powerful tool and I am so glad that we're looking at this.

03:11:19.701 --> 03:11:22.183
I have a perfect home for this, it's called the Equity Report.

03:11:23.084 --> 03:11:28.168
Landing it with a link so that we could then look at all these tabs and more.

03:11:28.268 --> 03:11:30.910
I mean, the possibilities are endless really with GIS.

03:11:31.270 --> 03:11:48.023
So I think that this as a visual is great and you could really zoom in and start geocoding things and start really understanding if we're looking at Riverside County, if we're looking at LA County and we're seeing this information, then we could really make inference about other things and start connecting the dots.

03:11:48.383 --> 03:11:49.644
So yes, thank you.

03:11:49.704 --> 03:11:50.244
This is great.

03:11:50.284 --> 03:11:54.806
I couldn't, I was trying to figure out the link so that I could retrieve it and play with it.

03:11:54.826 --> 03:11:57.868
I'm not sure if that's available to us, just so that we could explore it.

03:11:57.888 --> 03:12:04.211
We'll send you also a PDF of the reports if you just kind of want to see them in static, if that's kind of easier to digest at first.

03:12:04.251 --> 03:12:07.813
But you'll be able to get a link because it is hosted on the web.

03:12:07.853 --> 03:12:13.335
So it's something that we could eventually make public so that the public in the field can use it.

03:12:13.355 --> 03:12:14.296
So yeah, we can make that available.

03:12:14.336 --> 03:12:14.616
Okay.

03:12:14.836 --> 03:12:16.177
Yes, more and more of this.

03:12:16.397 --> 03:12:16.717
Thank you.

03:12:18.001 --> 03:12:19.981
Yeah, I have a question on the providers.

03:12:20.681 --> 03:12:36.144
The Gates Foundation did a pass at this three years ago or so and in looking at networks and consultants that were working in various places and there were these high concentrations and then there were complete deserts with nothing.

03:12:37.004 --> 03:12:39.965
And so how are you going to populate the providers?

03:12:41.305 --> 03:12:46.626
And you know, because there's so many out there and classify them and all that sort of thing.

03:12:47.176 --> 03:12:51.479
Well, I think the first thing we can do is ask for your old feedback on what providers would you like mapped.

03:12:51.679 --> 03:12:53.620
And then we can go and get that information.

03:12:53.700 --> 03:13:03.047
So when we were first looking at this as a department, we had also mapped on there the CCE, the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence pilots.

03:13:03.807 --> 03:13:08.750
We had also mapped some of our federal resources, so our Title I, Title III leads that are out there.

03:13:09.750 --> 03:13:15.933
So really, as long as we can get a spreadsheet of the information, it doesn't matter who's providing the network or the support.

03:13:16.013 --> 03:13:22.957
So it could be a private or a nonprofit set of networks, and then it can just be clearly labeled what you're looking at when you filter that.

03:13:23.077 --> 03:13:31.501
So absolutely, depending on what you all are interested in seeing mapped, then we can go out and get that information and have it in ways that you can see it in different ways.

03:13:32.210 --> 03:13:32.550
Okay.

03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:34.572
Yeah, I think this would elucidate something.

03:13:35.353 --> 03:13:46.343
To me, a lot of the media coverage of our system of support is misleading in that it implies that the counties are going to provide everything or it's all going through the counties.

03:13:46.403 --> 03:13:52.348
You read over and over again, well, they're going to, you know, need some assistance and the counties are going to do it.

03:13:52.388 --> 03:13:53.169
Well, the counties

03:13:53.909 --> 03:13:54.930
cannot do it all.

03:13:54.990 --> 03:13:57.792
They have to, there will be other providers in the mix.

03:13:58.773 --> 03:14:05.617
The county role, as we'll elucidate later, is not to do every bit of the assistance.

03:14:05.677 --> 03:14:11.421
So, anything that we could do to clarify that, and this is one thing, I think would help greatly.

03:14:12.582 --> 03:14:12.882
Thank you.

03:14:16.245 --> 03:14:17.486
All right, any further questions?

03:14:21.308 --> 03:14:31.991
So now I would love to introduce Peter Birdsall and Dr. Ed Manansala, who will provide a discussion on County Office of Education Support for Differentiated Assistance.

03:14:32.031 --> 03:14:38.613
And then, like I said, after that, we'll have Kristen Wright and Kristen Brooks talk about the evolution of the Special Education Division support.

03:14:43.441 --> 03:14:44.141
Well, thank you.

03:14:44.301 --> 03:14:47.902
I'm Peter Birdsall, Executive Director of CSES, the County Shrink Tents Association.

03:14:48.963 --> 03:14:51.923
I just wanted to touch, provide a brief update on three things.

03:14:52.003 --> 03:14:58.545
First, what we've been doing to support counties, to prepare them to support their school districts.

03:14:59.345 --> 03:15:07.768
Second, a review of the rollout of the dashboard and the identification of differentiated districts, districts for differentiated assistance last December.

03:15:08.508 --> 03:15:09.368
And then sort of a

03:15:09.960 --> 03:15:11.381
feedback loop where we are right now.

03:15:12.201 --> 03:15:18.324
In terms of the preparation, we have done, when I say we, this is a global we.

03:15:18.344 --> 03:15:35.492
This is in collaboration with State Board staff and department staff and CCE and lots of other people, but have done trainings for more than 200 county office staff in 16, 17, so last year was four days of training concerning the LCAP and the dashboard, so they were

03:15:36.496 --> 03:15:38.257
very familiar with all that and comfortable with that.

03:15:38.658 --> 03:15:42.480
This year, as you've heard, it was very much focused on improvement science or continuous improvement.

03:15:43.341 --> 03:15:44.462
Six days of training for that.

03:15:46.223 --> 03:15:55.249
The 200 number is important to us because our obligation, our commitment to the state is we will reach every school district, every part of the state.

03:15:55.309 --> 03:15:57.171
It is a statewide implementation strategy.

03:15:57.731 --> 03:16:07.780
There are 51 counties that serve multiple school districts, and so we have been very purposeful in making sure we add teams from every one of those counties at these trainings.

03:16:08.341 --> 03:16:22.974
So 200 people, more than 200, suggests, and in fact, we could give you the data if you wanted to go into that, but there is a team that's been trained in every county in the state to work with the school districts in that county, so there's consistent approach statewide.

03:16:25.056 --> 03:16:33.224
The second part of it, I'm really lucky to present or provide this update after you heard from Riverside, because it is a different kind of model that's taking place.

03:16:33.725 --> 03:16:34.846
It's not traditional.

03:16:35.366 --> 03:16:37.889
We invite state people to come and present the system.

03:16:37.989 --> 03:16:44.335
Most of the material is developed, reviewed, and presented by county office staff or other people working at the local level.

03:16:44.375 --> 03:16:46.617
So it's local materials that we then

03:16:47.803 --> 03:16:52.345
vet and review with the State Board staff, department staff, and CC, and obviously ourselves.

03:16:53.465 --> 03:17:03.529
And sometimes we do ask them to present, but primarily it's the counties like Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, all those counties that are preparing and sharing information with their colleagues.

03:17:04.369 --> 03:17:16.774
We were lucky three years ago to get a grant from the California Education Partners to bring together six counties to start developing tools and assessment protocols to work with their districts on this.

03:17:16.954 --> 03:17:18.235
That then expanded to 11.

03:17:19.235 --> 03:17:21.496
They then each partnered with a district in their county.

03:17:22.082 --> 03:17:33.789
So we've had several years of piloting and refining those, and those have become this resource that was talked about earlier, the facilitator's guide, which is like a compendium of materials that people could use as circumstances require.

03:17:34.730 --> 03:17:37.411
And the third thing is the connectedness of it.

03:17:37.592 --> 03:17:42.074
So obviously there are those trainings, but it's also been presented to the CISC.

03:17:42.635 --> 03:17:47.818
You're familiar now with the Curriculum Instruction Steering Committee, but also our LCAP directors have been presented there.

03:17:48.616 --> 03:17:57.286
Tomorrow we're having a meeting of what we call our math community of practice, the math leads from all around the state, and we have a section in that presentation on differentiated assistance.

03:17:57.366 --> 03:18:09.299
We'll have Nancy Brownell, who you all well know, and Melanie will be there, Sue Stickle from Sacramento County, now retired, so people coming together to connect that across the system.

03:18:10.760 --> 03:18:20.466
On the rollout, the commitment we made to the state, when I say the state, it's really this cross-agency group that Melanie talked about, so the State Board, Department, CC, and CCESA.

03:18:21.207 --> 03:18:30.372
The commitment we made is the county superintendents would call the superintendent of each district that had been identified, so they would have, first of all, make sure they know they've been identified.

03:18:31.068 --> 03:18:38.473
know what the next steps are, and confirm this commitment that the responsibility of leadership still rests with the school district.

03:18:38.493 --> 03:18:48.779
The county role is to be there in partnership and to help, to collaborate, but that the ownership of the plan and these assessments with the district.

03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:51.501
So we had 10 days to make those calls.

03:18:51.821 --> 03:18:53.903
It was 223 school districts located in 43 county offices of education.

03:18:57.665 --> 03:19:07.072
We talked to all 43 of those county superintendents and by 10 days later, every one of those calls had been made, every district superintendent had been contacted individually.

03:19:08.513 --> 03:19:15.397
So I think that's pretty impressive outreach in terms of trying to have a fairly smooth implementation.

03:19:16.238 --> 03:19:20.281
The feedback we got was very positive in the sense that the phone call

03:19:20.916 --> 03:19:26.761
and the commitment to working collaboratively, there was a small minority of those districts that were surprised.

03:19:26.821 --> 03:19:28.582
Most of them already knew they were being identified.

03:19:29.023 --> 03:19:36.349
The ones that were what I would call surprised was because primarily the student groups of homeless and foster youth.

03:19:38.831 --> 03:19:42.413
I was just asked, you know, this is just sort of feedback of how it's working through.

03:19:42.853 --> 03:19:59.823
The major concern we heard at that time, and you've had presentations on this already, is because most of these districts have been identified for student disability, how is this going to interface with the department's technical assistance around the disproportionality and program indicator technical assistance?

03:20:01.083 --> 03:20:04.746
CC and the department have really stepped up to help provide guidance on that.

03:20:05.126 --> 03:20:09.108
We just approved an addendum to our facilitator's guide.

03:20:09.569 --> 03:20:17.113
So we're working together, as Mellon indicated, to identify a problem, work together, and try and address it collaboratively.

03:20:18.134 --> 03:20:26.960
The final thing on feedback, our commitment to, again, the cross-agency group, is that we would routinely be

03:20:27.700 --> 03:20:32.883
cycling through, if you want, the county superintendents to see how things are going, provide feedback to that.

03:20:33.844 --> 03:20:39.747
So we have four CSESA staff assigned as liaisons to each of the CSESA regions.

03:20:41.488 --> 03:20:48.212
The commitment we made is that the county superintendents, there will be a meeting with the districts, each district, by the end of January.

03:20:48.252 --> 03:20:52.374
So we're currently making sure those meetings are taking place, how are those going, so we're collecting feedback.

03:20:52.414 --> 03:20:55.096
We will bring that to the cross-agencies group.

03:20:56.099 --> 03:21:06.846
We will be working with Melanie and others across agencies to have a formal kind of survey in terms of what are the needs and what are the capacity concerns, because we know that's of interest to everybody in the system.

03:21:08.086 --> 03:21:13.830
But we have consciously put in place a feedback system to collect that information in real time.

03:21:17.532 --> 03:21:21.396
The concerns we've heard about scheduling those meetings have not been any kind of resistance.

03:21:21.556 --> 03:21:24.819
It's been just a juggling of schedules of how many people there are.

03:21:25.299 --> 03:21:30.664
But the first of those meetings began to occur in December, and we are convinced they will all be done by the first week in February.

03:21:31.004 --> 03:21:33.406
So we asked Ed to join us.

03:21:33.807 --> 03:21:39.272
Ed is not only Eldorado County Superintendent, but he is our President-Elect and is very involved in all this work.

03:21:39.352 --> 03:21:41.814
So I'd like to turn it over to him and then open up for questions.

03:21:44.520 --> 03:21:49.387
Good afternoon, President Kirst, Chief Deputy Superintendent Price, and members of the board.

03:21:49.407 --> 03:21:50.509
It's good to be here with you.

03:21:50.969 --> 03:21:55.917
As I was walking up to the podium, I didn't realize the pressure that would occur following a GIS presentation.

03:21:57.344 --> 03:21:58.285
I'm going to do my best.

03:21:59.125 --> 03:22:03.767
So there's two things that I would like to just give an overview on.

03:22:03.807 --> 03:22:12.272
The first is just a snapshot of how the differentiated assistance has been rolling out, even from December until now.

03:22:12.832 --> 03:22:20.236
And providing that overview is very similar to asking a student who is on the second day of school, how's your academic year going?

03:22:21.136 --> 03:22:25.600
So we're really early on in the process in the piece that I'm gonna be describing.

03:22:25.680 --> 03:22:34.306
Second, I wanna step back and look at the context of work briefly in respect to the county offices from 2013 until now.

03:22:35.087 --> 03:22:44.134
So first of all, we received word of which students, or I'm sorry, which districts would be eligible for differentiated assistance in December.

03:22:44.574 --> 03:22:48.998
And as was stated, county superintendents made individual calls to those superintendents.

03:22:49.038 --> 03:22:50.359
And I want to give you a glimpse

03:22:50.859 --> 03:22:55.662
of not only the tone, but the nature of what those discussions look like, even from my perspective.

03:22:55.702 --> 03:23:00.546
So there were three district superintendents that I made personal calls to.

03:23:00.566 --> 03:23:05.129
I'd say all three were in a position where they were not surprised.

03:23:05.169 --> 03:23:08.611
They knew their data specifically around students with disabilities.

03:23:09.171 --> 03:23:18.758
But the clarification of the process, even though we took roughly multiple meetings to explain

03:23:19.338 --> 03:23:26.962
the difference of the old paradigm to this paradigm prior to those telephone calls, we had still a range of reactions.

03:23:27.402 --> 03:23:41.968
So one superintendent articulated both to me and her school community, you know, I sincerely believe this is a great opportunity to dig in, to look at instructional practice and behavioral practices within the districts.

03:23:41.988 --> 03:23:47.251
Like again, seizing the ownership and opportunity to do that, which was very positive.

03:23:47.791 --> 03:23:58.654
A second superintendent was ready to share the work that they were currently doing, meaning they recognized it was an area of development and were ready to engage.

03:23:58.714 --> 03:24:01.075
The third was an interesting response.

03:24:01.135 --> 03:24:11.898
Again, even though this was a relatively new superintendent to our county, his response was at the end of the call, Ed, you know, I'm ready for this.

03:24:11.998 --> 03:24:13.879
I've gone through program improvement before.

03:24:16.178 --> 03:24:23.584
even though we had articulated in formal and informal meetings the difference of the process.

03:24:23.604 --> 03:24:37.575
And the point that I'm trying to make is this shift that we're describing is significant internally for our superintendents, leaders, and teachers reacting to this new system that we together have been working on for quite some time.

03:24:38.616 --> 03:24:43.100
An initial call is still an initial call, and an initial reaction is an initial reaction.

03:24:44.201 --> 03:24:56.807
Second, we had an individual from our county office follow up with the superintendent personally to really give a more in-depth overview of the process.

03:24:56.907 --> 03:25:06.171
And while I'm articulating our experiences in Eldorado County, this process was taking place across the state with the other 57 superintendents.

03:25:06.991 --> 03:25:08.372
A team was then developed

03:25:08.792 --> 03:25:14.135
within the county office in addition to a team that was identified on the district side.

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:27.982
What was interesting to me about one of the recent meetings this week that our team, our county office meeting had with a district team around differentiated assistance was the invitation of a district to bring a parent to their team.

03:25:28.542 --> 03:25:32.604
And so the parent said, when we were talking about this process of root cause analysis,

03:25:33.476 --> 03:25:47.939
The parent expressed, you know, it's refreshing and I appreciate this process to not rush to a solution, but rather look at this as a thoughtful process to a long-term fix in our community.

03:25:49.779 --> 03:25:53.880
This is a parent view in the context of the educational team.

03:25:54.420 --> 03:25:59.541
So it's great to see even a community that's embracing this process.

03:26:02.062 --> 03:26:09.025
So we have set up five to six meeting times with these three districts.

03:26:10.066 --> 03:26:18.110
Kern, I'm sorry, Riverside did an exceptional job today demonstrating what in-depth work looks like with a district.

03:26:18.190 --> 03:26:22.052
And so I'm choosing not to give you that in-depth.

03:26:23.173 --> 03:26:34.746
overview of what that looks like with our districts but again I'm just going to highlight that and as you know this will conclude with a report that will be coming from each county superintendent.

03:26:34.786 --> 03:26:35.307
I want to make it

03:26:35.728 --> 03:26:46.817
Clear on the record, President Kearse, we do not see the 58 county superintendents of the county offices that are gonna provide all of the support to all of these districts, and we recognize that.

03:26:47.698 --> 03:27:03.310
And we were also aware, as I shift to this second overview, we as county superintendents were aware that from 2013 to now, that this was going to be a significant shift, not only in our role,

03:27:04.031 --> 03:27:05.953
but as the new dashboard rolled out.

03:27:05.993 --> 03:27:13.720
So let me go back to 2013, and I'm just going to give you some points to give you an overview of how we've been preparing for this.

03:27:14.882 --> 03:27:23.470
So even though I am in my first term as a county superintendent, and there are 58 total, here's what's interesting to take note.

03:27:24.851 --> 03:27:35.016
Since, if you look at the 58 county superintendents, 43 of the county superintendents are either in their first term or second term.

03:27:36.383 --> 03:27:40.827
So in the rollout of this new system, we have embraced this process.

03:27:40.867 --> 03:27:52.357
There are a good number of strong instructional leaders that are present as county superintendents who have lived the old accountability process and are embracing this new process.

03:27:52.858 --> 03:27:55.260
So just one point I wanna acknowledge.

03:27:55.780 --> 03:28:00.182
Early on, we recognized that CCEE was going to be playing a pivotal role.

03:28:00.222 --> 03:28:11.706
We wanted, in this case, Eldorado County wanted to leverage our current structures of collaboration to start introducing these changes that were taking place.

03:28:12.206 --> 03:28:15.748
Obviously, LCFF, the local control accountability plans.

03:28:16.128 --> 03:28:20.690
We had CCEE come in even two years ago to start talking about the work.

03:28:22.971 --> 03:28:31.700
As a county superintendent, and then I know many other county superintendents, we're having one-on-one meetings with district superintendents, really getting a pulse of what their needs were.

03:28:32.281 --> 03:28:40.489
Again, this is all acknowledging the importance of that issue of trust as we move into this change and relationship.

03:28:42.603 --> 03:28:54.190
As we speak, we weren't highlighted on the GIS map as a learning network because we would fall under that informal category.

03:28:54.230 --> 03:28:57.592
But right now, if we were to put a new color on there,

03:28:58.052 --> 03:29:05.380
you would see all 15 of our districts meeting this moment in a rural professional learning network focusing on math instruction.

03:29:06.001 --> 03:29:13.589
And what I'm pointing to is leveraging all of the current structures to support building capacity in this midst of change.

03:29:14.910 --> 03:29:35.443
So while I'm describing the view of the changes that have been taking place from 2013 till now, or I'm speaking to the unfolding of this new model even in these first few months, next week I look forward to meeting with all of our county superintendents at CCESA and we meet, as you know, on a quarterly basis.

03:29:35.844 --> 03:29:41.707
And that is our opportunity to continue to share about the best practices that are taking place and the challenges.

03:29:42.108 --> 03:29:43.929
And we're very appreciative.

03:29:44.609 --> 03:29:54.653
of not only the opportunity that is before us, but the partnership that we have with you, CDE, CCEE, and all of our other partnership agencies throughout California.

03:29:55.753 --> 03:29:56.094
Thank you.

03:30:00.835 --> 03:30:02.636
Okay, questions?

03:30:02.736 --> 03:30:06.318
Do you want to take questions now for this group?

03:30:07.918 --> 03:30:09.699
Yeah, do we have Mary Ann Dewan?

03:30:13.368 --> 03:30:15.753
Oh, she's probably going to do special ed.

03:30:16.775 --> 03:30:17.055
Yeah.

03:30:18.558 --> 03:30:22.145
Yeah, there is a question for the two of these persons here.

03:30:23.828 --> 03:30:24.550
Board member Burr.

03:30:26.004 --> 03:30:36.528
Well, I just wanted to express my appreciation to Peter and to Ed for being here, because I think it does help kind of build out the statewide county work that we heard about with Riverside.

03:30:36.548 --> 03:30:37.449
So thank you for that.

03:30:38.409 --> 03:30:44.211
I do also, though, want to just clarify one thing about county superintendents and their role in this work.

03:30:44.571 --> 03:30:49.613
There is a statutory role for county superintendents on behalf of the state.

03:30:49.633 --> 03:30:50.974
They are our agents.

03:30:51.114 --> 03:30:53.295
They have constitutional authority, et cetera.

03:30:54.015 --> 03:31:08.630
really in our, we used to call this years ago, our arms and legs in the field to actually do the work and to let the state be assured that the work is going forward and that they are touching every district, just as Ed eloquently described.

03:31:09.330 --> 03:31:16.938
So I just want that to be clear because I do hear feedback from LEAs who say, what if I don't want to work with my county superintendent?

03:31:17.718 --> 03:31:28.907
which I think we have to clarify that, that A, that's a relationship issue that needs to be addressed, which I know the counties are working hard on and I expect the LEAs are working hard as well.

03:31:29.547 --> 03:31:37.854
But it doesn't preclude LEAs from working with other providers if there's specific expertise they need or the counties can't do it.

03:31:38.254 --> 03:31:41.577
But the initial touch does have to be by county superintendents.

03:31:41.617 --> 03:31:44.359
So just wanted to be clear about that.

03:31:44.899 --> 03:32:01.147
Because I do think there's an expectation on the part of some providers, which you addressed, Mike, that we, either the State Board or we get this at the CCEE, are going to create lists again of providers, like our favorite SES providers.

03:32:01.627 --> 03:32:02.068
Exactly.

03:32:02.648 --> 03:32:08.571
And at least my intention at the CCEE, and I think everybody who works at the CCEE is

03:32:09.011 --> 03:32:13.133
has the same attitude, we're not going to create lists of providers.

03:32:13.653 --> 03:32:20.457
We're helping LEAs build capacity and making their own determinations about who they would be working with.

03:32:21.017 --> 03:32:24.559
So just wanted to clarify that because it does come up periodically.

03:32:24.579 --> 03:32:30.142
Okay, no further questions.

03:32:30.202 --> 03:32:30.542
Thank you.

03:32:34.775 --> 03:32:42.459
All right, go ahead, sorry.

03:32:43.039 --> 03:32:44.680
Kristen Wright, Special Education Division.

03:32:44.880 --> 03:32:46.881
I am here with the Coalition of Christens.

03:32:47.761 --> 03:32:48.642
This is Kristen Brooks.

03:32:49.262 --> 03:33:05.960
She does a project with us with Santa Clara County office of education and back to Ed's comments about Leveraging we are leveraging and aligning from the special ed division you can I'm sure read attachment 3 which sort of describes some of the work that we're doing around

03:33:06.460 --> 03:33:22.910
changing our infrastructure internally to be more poised to assist LEAs in a more strategic manner, in a more focused manner, in a more transparent manner, and one that really involves our stakeholders in every monitoring practice that we do.

03:33:23.531 --> 03:33:29.114
So my staff is in the process, as we speak, of completely reorganizing and changing up units.

03:33:29.174 --> 03:33:32.737
Again, you can read about that more, and we'll describe that more in our next item in March.

03:33:35.098 --> 03:33:54.869
We are expanding and updating all of our contracts to be aligned to the successor regions, to the state priorities, so everything that we're doing is in the same vein and will look very familiar to LEAs as they're seeking specific resources related to students with disabilities and specialization in that.

03:33:56.050 --> 03:33:58.193
We are also working closely with CCEE.

03:33:58.754 --> 03:34:09.690
We are having weekly calls and working with the Special Education Collective, which includes our partners with SELPA and CSESA, and our other key strategic partners to make sure that we are all aligned as a state.

03:34:09.730 --> 03:34:10.832
It's very exciting work.

03:34:11.673 --> 03:34:15.256
We're working to complement each other and not duplicate each other.

03:34:15.957 --> 03:34:18.158
And expanding existing projects.

03:34:18.198 --> 03:34:30.808
So I've asked Kristen to come and just share a little bit about what she's and her project is doing to support LEAs, particularly around supporting increasing access to the general education environment.

03:34:31.309 --> 03:34:35.572
And I think that's of interest based on some of the earlier statistics you saw this morning.

03:34:35.952 --> 03:34:38.594
So I'm pleased to introduce her to you, and then we'll let you go to lunch.

03:34:38.775 --> 03:34:39.175
So thank you.

03:34:50.846 --> 03:34:52.767
Go ahead and talk amongst yourselves as I find this.

03:34:52.787 --> 03:35:01.512
Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, you got the thing on the lunches.

03:35:01.672 --> 03:35:02.192
Go for it.

03:35:14.465 --> 03:35:15.385
You all can see that, right?

03:35:15.946 --> 03:35:16.486
Great, excellent.

03:35:17.627 --> 03:35:18.787
All right, good afternoon.

03:35:18.807 --> 03:35:20.928
Hi, my name is Kristen Brooks.

03:35:21.008 --> 03:35:26.651
I'm a director with the Santa Clara County Office of Education and I'm in charge of the Supporting Inclusive Practices Project.

03:35:26.731 --> 03:35:32.414
So I'm very honored to be able to share some information with you about the good work that we are doing right there in the trenches.

03:35:32.715 --> 03:35:41.359
So I'm really hoping that this will piggyback off of everything that you've heard today as we kind of talk macro and drill down to micro and what that really means for each and every child each and every day.

03:35:42.360 --> 03:35:42.760
So thank you.

03:35:44.375 --> 03:35:56.558
So the project focus really is around technical assistance for indicators three assessments, five and six which you've heard about earlier today, least restrictive environment for students ages three to five and then six to 21.

03:35:57.718 --> 03:35:59.638
And really we're targeting three areas.

03:36:00.079 --> 03:36:08.420
So when we talk about what are those barriers to inclusion or what things do we need to beef up when we're talking about systemic and systematic change, three things really stand out.

03:36:09.261 --> 03:36:10.981
One being education policy to practice.

03:36:11.241 --> 03:36:13.183
So are we looking at our vision and mission statements?

03:36:13.343 --> 03:36:15.785
Are we looking at how we are running our IEP meetings?

03:36:15.845 --> 03:36:18.027
How we're structuring our supports within our schools?

03:36:18.748 --> 03:36:22.632
And are our practices mirroring what our policies are?

03:36:23.753 --> 03:36:25.074
Also universal design for learning.

03:36:25.114 --> 03:36:27.837
Are we designing our lessons to meet all marginalized learners?

03:36:28.657 --> 03:36:32.920
and really reach the ends as we know through UDL that there is no average learner.

03:36:33.420 --> 03:36:42.106
And so we don't want to continue to design lessons for this student and this student and this student, but really for all students to have equity and access regardless of their abilities and skills.

03:36:42.887 --> 03:36:44.208
And then professional learning communities.

03:36:44.228 --> 03:36:52.373
You heard earlier about silos, and we really want to bring the general ed and special ed worlds together and really bring everyone to the table about students.

03:36:52.713 --> 03:36:54.194
These aren't your students and my students.

03:36:54.214 --> 03:36:55.115
These are our students.

03:36:55.635 --> 03:36:58.217
So those are really three main focal points of the project.

03:36:58.217 --> 03:36:58.465
project.

03:37:00.120 --> 03:37:01.361
These are the list of our grantees.

03:37:01.901 --> 03:37:16.130
So each of these districts are unique in that some of our folks are kind of those exemplar sites who've been identified that their LRE numbers are already at or above the state benchmarks, whereas the other individual districts may be receiving support toward improvement efforts.

03:37:16.190 --> 03:37:17.431
So some have joined this year.

03:37:18.011 --> 03:37:20.093
We brought on nine new districts this year.

03:37:20.493 --> 03:37:22.674
Some have been participating the last couple of years.

03:37:23.255 --> 03:37:28.338
So they're at different stages in that improvement plan process, which you can see who's been identified here.

03:37:28.839 --> 03:37:32.929
So these grantees reach anywhere from Siskiyou, way up north, all the way down to Imperial County.

03:37:33.009 --> 03:37:34.092
So we span the whole state.

03:37:36.536 --> 03:37:37.697
And these are some of the providers.

03:37:37.757 --> 03:37:40.720
So this supporting inclusive practices has evolved over time.

03:37:42.061 --> 03:37:49.948
It used to be that we had facilitators who would kind of deploy out to the districts and improvement plan process, and those would be individual people to provide that support.

03:37:49.988 --> 03:37:52.130
But we really learned that districts learn from districts.

03:37:52.630 --> 03:37:56.154
And so what we wanted to do was provide more like hubs throughout the state.

03:37:56.534 --> 03:38:00.698
So each of the districts and partner agencies that you see here bring a specialty.

03:38:01.298 --> 03:38:11.947
And so it might be Chime Charter in Woodland Hills, who has a 99.9% inclusion rate for students with and without disabilities, and spanning all the way to our most significantly impaired students.

03:38:12.467 --> 03:38:15.910
It might be Pleasanton, who just opened an inclusive preschool program.

03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:19.132
It might be Sanger, a PLC and RTI district.

03:38:19.212 --> 03:38:20.954
So everybody kind of brings something unique.

03:38:21.494 --> 03:38:28.260
And so what we've done is take our grantees and arrange them demographically and assign them, quote, to these providers.

03:38:28.360 --> 03:38:32.344
But that doesn't mean that's who they have to receive that technical assistance from.

03:38:32.704 --> 03:38:35.046
They can receive supports from any one of our partners.

03:38:35.467 --> 03:38:40.271
It's just who is your kind of one contact that is demographically at least close to your area.

03:38:41.252 --> 03:38:47.698
This year we also have two university partners or institutions of higher education, University of Redlands and San Francisco State University.

03:38:48.198 --> 03:39:01.163
and their role has been extensive in that San Francisco State has helped develop a teacher survey, so we're doing a pre and a post survey about perceptions around inclusion and what supports teachers there in the classrooms are needing.

03:39:01.824 --> 03:39:07.666
We have the University of Redlands who has been partnering also with Digicoach, a company that has a data

03:39:09.868 --> 03:39:12.370
using in our classrooms so we're looking at the data around that.

03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:25.581
A lot around the policy practice and also helping with our logic model within this project so all of these different partners have been really instrumental in the work that we're doing to increase achievement and inclusion for our students.

03:39:26.081 --> 03:39:26.802
with disabilities.

03:39:27.322 --> 03:39:35.928
And I know this is specific to students with disabilities, but at least every time I meet with our teams, meet with our districts, I'm really focusing in on we're talking about all kids.

03:39:36.348 --> 03:39:43.453
Yes, this is a special ed division, you know, kind of promoted and supported project, but we're talking about all kids.

03:39:44.714 --> 03:39:45.955
So that's key to this work.

03:39:47.643 --> 03:39:50.045
This is a little quick snapshot of our logic model.

03:39:50.065 --> 03:39:55.669
If you guys are familiar with logic models, you start with your inputs, your activities, and then your outputs and what you expect your outcomes to be.

03:39:56.129 --> 03:40:09.878
So our inputs being those different partnerships with the California Department of Ed, with the different universities, with those exemplar districts who are providing those supports, as well as I mentioned our DigiCoach, kind of our community providers who help us with some of that data collection.

03:40:10.339 --> 03:40:14.822
We do have pallet walls, information and resources that we share kind of virtually that way.

03:40:15.422 --> 03:40:21.130
In terms of activities, a couple of different institutes that we provide, one is the fall and we held that at the University of Redlands.

03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:31.043
That was a chance for representatives from these grantees to come together and talk about what are the goals of the program, where do we want to head, what is this logic model, what are the deliverables under this project.

03:40:32.023 --> 03:40:47.849
And so then we also had presentations around UDL and policy to practice and PLCs just like we talked about our focus So it's all aligned We're gonna have the next Institute which will be in the spring April 24th at San Francisco State and that'll be more of a coming back together again Around what was our progress?

03:40:47.869 --> 03:40:50.850
What did our data look like over this involvement this past year?

03:40:51.230 --> 03:40:54.991
what do we need going forward and then really focusing on that sustainability piece and

03:40:55.731 --> 03:41:04.798
and some of the work around Patrick Lencioni's ideal team player, where each of us brings something unique to the table, and how do we then continue this forward momentum that we've started.

03:41:05.958 --> 03:41:09.561
We also take the districts through a root cause analysis and action planning.

03:41:10.441 --> 03:41:15.665
And so this isn't a kit, this isn't a, you know, this is how you do inclusion, or this is how you increase your assessments.

03:41:16.145 --> 03:41:20.169
It's what do you need in your district based on your population, your culture, and your community?

03:41:20.569 --> 03:41:22.250
How can we establish those relationships?

03:41:22.671 --> 03:41:26.434
And what can we bring to you to help support you in the space that you're in?

03:41:27.155 --> 03:41:41.407
And so that root cause analysis, although guided by documents Colorado uses, Dean Gano's work, it's really specific to those individual districts and the perception data, the demographic data, the achievement data, the LRE data, all that, the deeper dive that we need to do, but it's done

03:41:42.108 --> 03:41:43.790
on an individual basis for those folks.

03:41:44.230 --> 03:41:45.552
And same thing with the action plan.

03:41:45.592 --> 03:41:52.581
Those outcomes of that root cause analysis, some districts, as I mentioned, have been participating in this for a couple of years, while others are just on board.

03:41:53.002 --> 03:41:55.925
And so we don't expect everybody to be at the same place at the same time.

03:41:56.426 --> 03:41:58.609
We just want to get off the hamster wheel and move forward.

03:42:00.491 --> 03:42:18.242
Other things, we have biweekly classroom walkthroughs using this classroom walkthrough tool through DigiCoach and that really is kind of a Likert scale of what are we seeing in terms of evidence-based practices happening in the classroom and how might that look different for a quote exemplar site versus a quote improvement site.

03:42:18.903 --> 03:42:21.725
How can we leverage some support to bring everybody you know kind of

03:42:22.145 --> 03:42:24.047
all boats rising together.

03:42:25.367 --> 03:42:26.608
And so we're doing walkthroughs.

03:42:26.708 --> 03:42:28.730
And really, that template is around UDL.

03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:37.376
There's a very heavy emphasis on UDL to see if we're seeing evidence of action expression and multiple means of representation and engagement and those sorts of things.

03:42:38.757 --> 03:42:40.178
And then ongoing technical assistance.

03:42:40.219 --> 03:42:41.439
So again, what do you need?

03:42:42.180 --> 03:42:43.361
What do you need, Palm Springs?

03:42:43.441 --> 03:42:44.942
Is it different from what you need in Harupa?

03:42:45.002 --> 03:42:46.703
Is it different from what you need in Wairika?

03:42:47.624 --> 03:42:50.886
And so we're trying to deploy that on a very ground level.

03:42:51.887 --> 03:42:56.071
And then you can just see, as you zoom in a little bit more closely, what those short-term and long-term outcomes are.

03:42:56.111 --> 03:43:05.718
But really it's around increasing achievement, increasing LRE, and also perceptions, and making a shift in what we've been doing in the past and how we need to do it differently going forward.

03:43:06.219 --> 03:43:09.441
But there's a very heavy emphasis on that relationship base.

03:43:09.841 --> 03:43:15.346
You know, you can't just go in from a compliance lens and say, you know, here are our numbers and we're comparing it to what they're doing in Boston.

03:43:15.726 --> 03:43:16.927
and we are completely off the mark.

03:43:16.967 --> 03:43:17.607
It's like, no, no, no.

03:43:17.627 --> 03:43:19.508
We come in and say, the compliance piece is there.

03:43:19.628 --> 03:43:24.911
We know we need to do better than what we're doing today, but let's do this together, not with the hammer, but with the heart.

03:43:25.392 --> 03:43:27.893
I know that sounds very lofty, but it's real, right?

03:43:27.933 --> 03:43:36.778
When you're in a room and you have to talk about those hard numbers and that data that some people don't want to look at because it's been in their faces for a long time now, and they're not surprised by those phone calls.

03:43:37.478 --> 03:43:37.919
But guess what?

03:43:37.939 --> 03:43:43.562
We still have to look at it, and we still have to do something about it and hold hands together and say, we're not going back.

03:43:44.962 --> 03:43:46.323
So it's about that relationship piece.

03:43:47.623 --> 03:43:52.325
So these are some of the deliverables that I talked about, just kind of a visual representation, but the root cause analysis, the action plan.

03:43:52.365 --> 03:43:57.227
We have webinars throughout the year around those topics that the districts are coming back and saying we need support with.

03:43:57.667 --> 03:44:03.129
So whether it's UDL, and we had Katie Novak in September, if it's behavior, we had Dr. John Pelletieri in November.

03:44:03.690 --> 03:44:06.771
We have one in February on PLCs with Mike Meadows from Solution Tree.

03:44:06.831 --> 03:44:12.373
So what are we hearing that our districts need, but also what have we been seeing over time as a focus for this work?

03:44:14.134 --> 03:44:20.256
Again, the institutes, the two institutions of higher ed, so all of these kind of supports within those deliverables.

03:44:20.436 --> 03:44:26.118
And then the project focus being progress monitoring, continuous improvement, and in a phase.

03:44:26.478 --> 03:44:29.139
So start with your vision, your mission, your values, and your goals.

03:44:29.179 --> 03:44:30.400
Get your leadership team together.

03:44:30.820 --> 03:44:39.671
bring a general ed rep, a special ed rep, an administrator, a parent, a student, you know, bring your teams together to do the work that is messy but that needs to be done for our kids.

03:44:40.832 --> 03:44:44.716
Invite those stakeholders, develop those action plans, adopt those action plans.

03:44:45.057 --> 03:44:45.718
We know through

03:44:46.779 --> 03:44:52.103
the work of Everett Rogers decades ago, that there is kind of that curve about adoption.

03:44:52.143 --> 03:45:01.131
We have those early adopters that are really, really on board, and then we have those laggards that are just kind of waiting to see, is this stuff really going to work, or is this the shiny object that everybody's looking at right now?

03:45:01.892 --> 03:45:08.577
So we want to work people through those processes to make sure that we're creating real change, and that this isn't something that's going to go away.

03:45:10.851 --> 03:45:11.292
So that's it.

03:45:11.393 --> 03:45:12.054
Was that fast enough?

03:45:12.235 --> 03:45:13.137
All these presentations?

03:45:13.157 --> 03:45:14.561
So I know you guys are getting hungry.

03:45:15.744 --> 03:45:18.171
So contact information, and I'll step back.

03:45:19.656 --> 03:45:19.956
Thank you.

03:45:19.976 --> 03:45:26.440
So I hope this was a good little snippet of some of the work that we've been doing in the division and that we hope to do a great deal more of.

03:45:26.660 --> 03:45:38.647
And so our goal is to provide our LEAs that are in differentiated assistance another option through the special ed division should that be the road that they choose to go down.

03:45:38.867 --> 03:45:46.652
And so we hope to clone and scale Kristen and her project as well as other projects that are similar that are doing really great things for kids.

03:45:50.896 --> 03:46:04.279
So let me just thank Kristen and all of the presentations are really building from Melanie's and laying out the whole picture about how all the pieces are starting to cover our entire state in a differentiated way across.

03:46:04.359 --> 03:46:11.020
I'm interested in the, and we've had, every presentation has helped build on the other and I think gives us hope into the future.

03:46:11.300 --> 03:46:18.122
I'm interested in the collaboration with the cross agencies, particularly the role, I know you spoke about the collaborative and I see Josh in the,

03:46:20.143 --> 03:46:23.224
I hate to have him come without having any opportunity to share anything.

03:46:24.204 --> 03:46:27.485
I'm just interested in how you're collaborating with him.

03:46:27.605 --> 03:46:29.666
I know people have been saying their role is developing.

03:46:29.726 --> 03:46:30.486
What's their role?

03:46:30.566 --> 03:46:32.127
How are they working to help you?

03:46:32.607 --> 03:46:35.528
So I wonder if you could share that and maybe have him.

03:46:38.442 --> 03:46:41.084
How have we been doing that?

03:46:41.644 --> 03:46:49.150
We are taking a closer look at what the needs of those differentiated assistance districts are.

03:46:49.310 --> 03:46:51.732
Clearly, there is a very large number that are special ed.

03:46:54.838 --> 03:47:02.560
Basically, starting with what are we currently doing, what do we need to shift a little, where do we need more partnership to scale?

03:47:02.700 --> 03:47:11.382
I think everyone at the table in the SPED Collective, which includes all the partners, everyone brings a unique piece to help us do that work.

03:47:12.122 --> 03:47:15.863
At our core, the department is responsible for

03:47:16.483 --> 03:47:17.544
compliance and monitoring.

03:47:17.664 --> 03:47:19.585
That's where, that's the core of our work.

03:47:19.665 --> 03:47:25.448
So it's helpful to have other entities come in that are working and talking to districts in a different way.

03:47:25.769 --> 03:47:30.732
We are working towards coaching to compliance rather than, you know, the hammer that we've talked about before.

03:47:31.192 --> 03:47:40.197
But we're still, we still are in that role as a state, that at the end, if someone isn't meeting their requirements, we do have to take some kind of action.

03:47:40.237 --> 03:47:43.999
That's a very different role than someone coaching and holding your hand in a different way.

03:47:44.059 --> 03:47:44.680
So I think

03:47:45.140 --> 03:48:09.062
The complementary relationship with CCESA doing a lot of the regional, with CCEE being able to bring in more of the thought partnering, and we're looking forward to some deeper dives around the data and doing some correlations around our underbelly data, which I think will really help to inform the conversation and offer folks a way to talk about the data that doesn't become divisive.

03:48:10.123 --> 03:48:24.191
So, I don't know if that answers your question, but I would say we continue to meet and talk about what each of us are doing in our assigned roles to make sure that we're complementing each other.

03:48:24.851 --> 03:48:33.756
So, we will have more specifics at the March meeting when we talk about our state systemic improvement plan, which will give you more, I think, nuts and bolts that you're looking for.

03:48:40.134 --> 03:48:40.955
Are you all comfortable?

03:48:41.336 --> 03:48:43.961
Josh, do you want to add anything since you're here?

03:48:50.250 --> 03:48:52.871
Good morning, thank you, Board Member Strauss.

03:48:53.611 --> 03:48:57.872
Josh Daniels, Director of Training and Outreach for the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

03:48:58.132 --> 03:49:05.534
Just very quickly, I'll mention two things related to the collective work that we're doing with CDE around students with disabilities.

03:49:05.894 --> 03:49:10.315
We have a governing board meeting scheduled for February 1st, and we're bringing forward two items for board approval.

03:49:10.475 --> 03:49:13.816
One, a position specific to the work of special ed.

03:49:14.416 --> 03:49:28.565
and also some contracts with special ed experts that we're working with around the data analysis and sort of developing the statewide system of support, particularly for those 163 school districts that have been identified because of students with disabilities.

03:49:30.085 --> 03:49:34.288
And I'm happy to answer anything else, but specifically that's two things we are working on.

03:49:39.574 --> 03:49:58.025
I want to unpack this system of support a little bit more because, you know, as I was reading some of the letters and listening to some of the comments, when there is limited capacity, limited resources, there is an accelerated race to the margin, right?

03:49:58.185 --> 03:50:00.106
Who is the most marginalized in the system?

03:50:00.966 --> 03:50:04.068
And we have many student subgroups that could really claim that.

03:50:05.028 --> 03:50:18.895
And so I think that one of the concerns that has been expressed, and I know that Ting Sun spoke a little bit about how this system would be more comprehensive and not just look at one student group or one indicator, but be more comprehensive in its analysis.

03:50:19.455 --> 03:50:26.679
And I really want us to discuss that publicly because I truly believe these are all our students.

03:50:26.719 --> 03:50:33.282
And I've said that for English learners, for our ethnic student groups, for our students with disabilities.

03:50:33.362 --> 03:50:34.303
These are our students.

03:50:34.343 --> 03:50:35.103
We need to own them.

03:50:35.143 --> 03:50:38.045
We need to own their outcomes and move towards improving upon.

03:50:38.905 --> 03:50:42.347
But I also know that we can't oversimplify what that means.

03:50:42.947 --> 03:50:46.688
you know, I don't want to default into we're all human argument.

03:50:46.908 --> 03:50:53.150
Yes, we're all human, but my experience is very different than your experience and your experience because of who I am as this human being.

03:50:53.830 --> 03:51:00.692
And so when we're looking at our students with disabilities, there has to be, we need to address their abilities.

03:51:00.732 --> 03:51:02.333
We need to address their needs.

03:51:02.593 --> 03:51:04.933
First and foremost, that is who, what is their need?

03:51:05.373 --> 03:51:07.374
If, you know, I went into a school once and asked,

03:51:07.974 --> 03:51:09.515
how many of your students are ELs?

03:51:09.695 --> 03:51:12.877
And they said, we treat all our students as if they were gifted.

03:51:13.397 --> 03:51:16.839
Well, that's great, except gifted students also have language needs.

03:51:17.139 --> 03:51:19.740
And so what are you doing to address their language needs, right?

03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:32.947
So I want us to really emphasize what that means when we're looking at the one student group that triggered the identification for most of our LEAs, but understand that there are needs according to abilities.

03:51:33.607 --> 03:51:39.751
And then that student could be of an ethnic racial background, low income, English learner.

03:51:40.131 --> 03:51:44.334
And so it's a very multidimensional person and student.

03:51:44.834 --> 03:51:51.959
So when we're looking at our systems of support, how are we going to make sure that we're addressing their needs,

03:51:52.699 --> 03:51:53.920
by their ability level.

03:51:54.541 --> 03:52:00.628
And then we're also looking at the majority of these students are Latino, just like the majority of our students in California.

03:52:02.029 --> 03:52:04.452
You know, there's a good number of them that are English learners.

03:52:04.852 --> 03:52:13.742
So how are we making sure that we're addressing the needs of students beyond their ability level so that the rest of the folks here that are thinking,

03:52:14.202 --> 03:52:24.674
If you look at African-American students, there's a lot of needs there, and they may not be captured under this group, but we need to address their needs, and we need to address the needs of English learners, and we need to address the needs of Latino students.

03:52:25.195 --> 03:52:26.356
How are we going to do that?

03:52:26.376 --> 03:52:33.284
Because we have limited capacity, limited resources, but great need out there, and we don't want to pit subgroups against each other.

03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:35.670
I think you make a great point.

03:52:37.812 --> 03:52:40.273
Could not agree more in terms of that coordination.

03:52:40.513 --> 03:52:44.015
And so it starts with thinking about students and what students need to be supported.

03:52:44.035 --> 03:52:51.539
And I think it goes back to some of the things that Kristen Brooks was talking about around how you design classrooms and schools in a universal manner.

03:52:51.639 --> 03:52:56.241
So you're starting off making them the most accessible universes in tier one that you can.

03:52:56.781 --> 03:53:03.445
And then you're recognizing that many of them have all kinds of different needs at tier two, tier three, and then within the special education sort of

03:53:04.365 --> 03:53:05.967
through the tiers.

03:53:06.728 --> 03:53:26.246
So one of the things that we've been doing, and Melanie can speak with this too, is really looking at how the system overall, so our fiefdom is the state system, what can we do at the state level to start integrating all of those particular student groups and areas where currently we've all been doing our own work?

03:53:27.146 --> 03:53:38.012
So as a state, we have to take the lead in saying, we need to be talking about our students and how we're going to gather around them with those supports and services, whatever they may need.

03:53:38.373 --> 03:53:44.176
Now for students with disabilities, the IEP is a great vehicle because it allows us to ask those questions.

03:53:44.476 --> 03:53:49.199
So the most important piece about that, if we're just talking about students with disabilities, and I know we're talking about all students as well,

03:53:49.839 --> 03:53:52.601
is that we have the right people at the table when we're at IEP meetings.

03:53:52.641 --> 03:54:06.833
So it means IEP meetings are not just the special ed teacher and the parent and the principal, but it includes your EL specialist or anyone else that may need to be participating in that student's education to ensure that those supports are wrapped around that student.

03:54:07.333 --> 03:54:12.037
There's a baseline, but there's nothing that's precluding us from having all the right people at the table.

03:54:12.637 --> 03:54:15.980
So your point is well taken, and I don't know if you have anything else to add, Mel.

03:54:18.191 --> 03:54:25.257
The only, Melanie Sheppy, the only other thing I would add is that it's very important to continue to reiterate that publicly in all of our messaging.

03:54:25.417 --> 03:54:36.447
So I know in talking about students with disabilities and how they cross over with different other student groups, I've made sure that's in my messaging in the presentations or discussions that I've had.

03:54:36.567 --> 03:54:45.295
I've seen staff from the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence also talking about that intersectionality and seeing people in those discussions or those stakeholder sessions

03:54:45.715 --> 03:54:48.900
say, oh, I'm going to need help to understand that for my own population.

03:54:49.140 --> 03:55:00.517
And then in a specific instance, we've connected at the next curriculum and instruction steering committee for SSESA, we've connected those county representatives with two staff from CDE

03:55:01.879 --> 03:55:13.309
one specializing in students who are homeless and one specializing in students who are foster youth, to connect county staff with the right understandings about how to understand that data.

03:55:13.789 --> 03:55:20.015
So I think it's, A, publicly always reinforcing it, because to make our shifts real, we all have to say it in different contexts.

03:55:20.035 --> 03:55:23.097
So I think just your question in bringing that up is what we need to do.

03:55:23.518 --> 03:55:24.819
But then also concretely,

03:55:25.439 --> 03:55:30.942
make sure that local educators and communities know how to look at the intersectionality of their data.

03:55:31.603 --> 03:55:39.067
And as they're doing data analysis, make sure our message is not, oh, you're identified for this specific piece, then that's what you're looking at.

03:55:39.247 --> 03:55:43.210
And I don't think I've ever heard that message come across, but then I think it's in

03:55:44.781 --> 03:55:47.745
reflecting on how the work is going to make sure that doesn't happen.

03:55:48.025 --> 03:55:56.096
Because we can make sure we have the right messages and we have the right intentions, but it's then circling back in February, reflecting with the counties, how is the work going?

03:55:56.196 --> 03:56:00.742
Are you having districts that are resistant to looking at data beyond those student groups?

03:56:02.184 --> 03:56:07.528
Do you have excellent examples where you're able to really look at all student groups across all indicators and then drill down?

03:56:07.548 --> 03:56:15.716
And I know that's one of the reasons the LCAP Director Network was set up, so that counties could talk in regions and then with each other about struggles and successes.

03:56:15.756 --> 03:56:25.224
And I think this is a perfect thing that should be top of mind, especially as counties and districts are looking at the data together of, okay, well, how was that data analysis?

03:56:25.304 --> 03:56:26.785
Were you able to go deep?

03:56:27.802 --> 03:56:28.843
Or did you get stuck?

03:56:28.883 --> 03:56:31.045
And if you got stuck, well, let's go back to the table.

03:56:31.506 --> 03:56:34.970
So I think that's a great question, something we need to reflect on as the work continues.

03:56:48.082 --> 03:56:57.333
In light of that, thinking about the data and knowing that we have students who transcend across multiple student groups, how do districts organize that?

03:56:57.373 --> 03:56:58.855
What are the resources that they have?

03:56:58.895 --> 03:57:08.285
I mean, they have their own SISs where I guess they could pull and they could see, but I think bringing that to light and really looking at it really helps them sort the data and get down to

03:57:09.627 --> 03:57:17.033
You know student groups that really need tremendous attention, but also are in four or five different student groups.

03:57:17.133 --> 03:57:35.189
I just think that that organization or the The help that districts might need and in building those lists I mean it sounds simple, but it really would help them be more strategic and streamlined absolutely and that's why we've been trying to make sure we connect the right staff that understands how to

03:57:37.327 --> 03:57:42.731
succinctly and clearly pull that data from different information systems connected with counties and districts.

03:57:42.771 --> 03:57:52.138
So I know Jenny Singh has done a lot of work with counties in helping them navigate the data and how would they pull it together and then with their work with districts, districts reach out directly.

03:57:52.538 --> 03:57:56.921
So I think making sure it's clear that if you have that need, ask for it.

03:57:57.581 --> 03:57:57.722
And

03:57:58.562 --> 03:58:05.404
We need to make sure either through your county support, if you have a county that's able to really support you in the data analysis, or direct CDE support.

03:58:05.424 --> 03:58:10.946
I know also, mentioned a little bit earlier, California Collaborative for Educational Excellence is doing the data and evaluation webinar.

03:58:11.366 --> 03:58:15.968
You know, someone might go to that, but then have a specific need about the system that they have and how to work it.

03:58:16.368 --> 03:58:34.186
So I think we need to make sure that we're talking about it and making sure that when someone says, hey, I don't know how to pull this from Aries or whatever my system is, that we're there to support them and make sure that that's something that you can ask for, you should ask for, because you're not going to be able to understand your data if you can't really understand the different intersectionalities of your students.

03:58:36.044 --> 03:58:46.026
And in addition to that, we've already started planning on a rollout of data boot camps related to the special ed data, because I know that is also an area that LEAs are feeling like they need some support in.

03:58:46.486 --> 03:59:01.769
So not only can they at any time contact us and the folks that are assigned to their regions and speak directly with Shiloh if they need to, but we will be rolling out a series of regionalized events to be able to support that effort as well.

03:59:02.165 --> 03:59:06.835
And Kristen, will you be sharing that information more with us in March at our next meeting about what the steps are?

03:59:06.976 --> 03:59:07.357
Yes, we will.

03:59:07.517 --> 03:59:07.878
Great, thanks.

03:59:14.827 --> 03:59:15.447
That's not a question.

03:59:15.487 --> 03:59:18.609
I really appreciate my colleagues questions are great questions.

03:59:18.729 --> 03:59:20.090
And thank you for the presentations.

03:59:20.130 --> 03:59:22.972
And I just want to acknowledge the leadership of Director Wright.

03:59:23.132 --> 03:59:25.353
She's just the perfect person at the right time.

03:59:26.174 --> 03:59:32.677
And with the restructuring that's happening, too, I think this cross disciplinary work has already been happening.

03:59:33.198 --> 03:59:40.402
And so I'm just encouraged to see that it's there's a more formal restructuring that will enable that to happen.

03:59:41.082 --> 03:59:51.767
And then also the Advisory Commission on Special Education, led by Gina Plate, really has been involved in this work for so long, and it's just great to see it happening.

03:59:52.167 --> 04:00:07.974
And again, commissioners who are working in a cross-disciplinary way already to inform this work, and that really helps leverage resources and expertise, and aligns our system, and makes it more coherent, so thank you.

04:00:13.027 --> 04:00:22.931
Oh, I also want to say that the governor's budget includes a hundred million dollars for increasing the supply of teachers in special education.

04:00:23.611 --> 04:00:39.218
Fifty million dollars for a new teacher training program called for teacher residencies that has a lot of promise for creating teachers that will stay with districts a fairly long period of time.

04:00:39.878 --> 04:00:47.842
and $50 million going to local districts to enhance their ability to attract and retain special education teachers.

04:00:48.643 --> 04:00:56.107
So, you know, if this is approved by the legislature, I think in a number of ways, we're really on the move on special education, including today.

04:00:56.847 --> 04:00:59.349
And I think it's a very heartening movement.

04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:02.811
Any further questions?

04:01:05.072 --> 04:01:06.933
If not, then we're ready for public comment.

04:01:09.901 --> 04:01:11.823
Would the following speakers please line up?

04:01:12.844 --> 04:01:22.432
Sheila Whitley, Mish Cabal, Gina Plate, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, Brian Rivas, Jim Anderson, and John Affeld.

04:01:23.633 --> 04:01:23.933
Thank you.

04:01:37.961 --> 04:01:40.162
Good afternoon.

04:01:41.363 --> 04:01:48.847
I'm Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and I'm representing Californians Together and the California Association for Bilingual Education.

04:01:48.947 --> 04:01:57.212
First I would like to commend staff for the very hard work in addressing the issue of assistance and support to our LEAs.

04:01:58.032 --> 04:02:09.064
I would like to bring to your attention a significant concern that we have regarding the new calculations of the performance levels approved by the State Board on November 2017.

04:02:10.766 --> 04:02:16.552
We now have a completely different picture of the performance level for ELs on the academic indicator.

04:02:17.413 --> 04:02:29.517
Over 64% of districts with the 2017 data are now orange and red compared to 60% last year when they were primarily yellow and some green and some blue.

04:02:30.998 --> 04:02:39.861
The letter that's being distributed to you has three questions on page two that we would like for you to take a look at and consider.

04:02:42.122 --> 04:02:49.566
Most importantly, we would like to see what will happen with regards to whether districts will attend to this data.

04:02:50.346 --> 04:02:57.190
We recommend that the State Board of Education direct CESSA staff to take steps in addressing this issue.

04:02:57.430 --> 04:02:57.690
Thank you.

04:03:05.222 --> 04:03:08.066
Hi there, thank you for the opportunity for letting me speak.

04:03:08.126 --> 04:03:14.293
My name is Mishka Ball and I'm a site organizer for Youth Together and I'm here to talk about how districts can better engage stakeholders.

04:03:14.794 --> 04:03:21.262
For us, as people who engage with youth often, as I mean all we do is community organizing with our youth,

04:03:21.642 --> 04:03:30.187
Authentic and meaningful engagement means requiring more than just youth and parent presence, but their perspective and critical feedback regarding issues that directly impact them.

04:03:30.547 --> 04:03:38.432
It also means long-term relationship building with community members who are also fighting locally to make sure that resources are being distributed equitably.

04:03:38.932 --> 04:03:54.133
Because there are limited opportunities to critically engage our youth and parents due to lack of advertisement of crucial meetings or even decision-making meetings that are closed, our youth have taken it upon themselves to collect data through our listening campaign to provide more student voice around their needs.

04:03:54.634 --> 04:03:57.998
Data can be in the form of narratives and lived experiences.

04:03:58.378 --> 04:04:10.132
And it is both the state's and district's responsibility to want to include, fund, and advocate for the voices most often silenced in these conversations and to develop more community relevant solutions.

04:04:10.232 --> 04:04:10.492
Thank you.

04:04:15.336 --> 04:04:18.879
Good morning again, President Kirst and Chief Deputy Price and Board Members.

04:04:18.919 --> 04:04:22.481
My name is Gina Plait, again, Chair of the Advisory Commission on Special Ed.

04:04:23.262 --> 04:04:26.764
Thank you, Board Member Sandoval, for your comments about the commission.

04:04:26.784 --> 04:04:29.666
We have been very excited about engaging in this process.

04:04:30.627 --> 04:04:37.294
And, you know, we knew that the recommendations that came out of the task force would be a very heavy lift.

04:04:37.874 --> 04:04:41.898
But what we're seeing coming to fruition, I think, is even beyond what we expected.

04:04:41.958 --> 04:04:47.323
And we heard about the recommendations in the budget that we're very, very excited and optimistic about.

04:04:48.044 --> 04:05:06.400
The collaboration that Melanie and Kristen and the other presenters today described and what you saw modeled today, the way that we're operationalizing our commitment to each and every child, in my experience, my career here, it is unprecedented and it's really exciting to see the commitment going forward.

04:05:07.481 --> 04:05:14.024
So we've made significant progress, but I will continue to highlight that we still have much work to do.

04:05:14.224 --> 04:05:25.908
And while this is not an action item in front of you, I ask that you continue to shine the light in this area, continue to hold the field accountable for what we are doing for all kids.

04:05:26.148 --> 04:05:30.730
So I pledge the continued support of the commission and thank you.

04:05:36.294 --> 04:05:45.857
Jim Anderson, current chair of the SELPA Administrators Association of California and also the SELPA director for the Los Angeles County Court School SELPA and Los Angeles County Charter SELPA.

04:05:46.597 --> 04:05:52.698
SELPAs reflect a range in diversity and resources and we've heard that here today about county offices and LEAs across the state.

04:05:53.799 --> 04:05:57.480
Leveraging existing resources across all systems is critical.

04:05:58.100 --> 04:06:05.442
As an association, we are working to increase member SELPA capacity to collaborate and align the existing work around their LEA members LCAPs

04:06:06.162 --> 04:06:09.685
the areas of need highlighted by the dashboard for students with disabilities.

04:06:10.766 --> 04:06:12.027
There's plenty of work to do.

04:06:13.308 --> 04:06:19.213
SELPAs are prepared and engaged as a critical member within the statewide system of support to do this work.

04:06:20.073 --> 04:06:32.443
The association appreciates the work of the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence Collective that was mentioned, including SELPAs, County Office of Education, California Department of Education, and other partners.

04:06:32.964 --> 04:06:33.244
Thank you.

04:06:41.766 --> 04:06:47.429
Good afternoon, board members, John Affeldt from Public Advocates and on behalf of the Equity Coalition.

04:06:48.230 --> 04:06:48.790
Two things.

04:06:49.030 --> 04:07:04.360
One, appreciate the call out to involving community stakeholders in the continuous improvement process, but I think we need to have the state board and the cross agencies be much tighter in making sure this happens.

04:07:05.145 --> 04:07:15.516
For example, the facilitator's guide, pretty good guide, allows it to be optional to include community stakeholders in the root cause analysis.

04:07:16.397 --> 04:07:17.558
This is a non-negotiable.

04:07:17.919 --> 04:07:26.008
Community stakeholders need to be part and parcel of the analysis and the decision-making of the root cause and how the district's going to move forward.

04:07:27.074 --> 04:07:41.493
Secondly, ACSA, we understand, is taking the position that districts don't have to change anything in response to the differentiated assistance conversation because they're in a three-year fixed LCAP plan.

04:07:42.034 --> 04:07:44.675
That makes a mockery of continuous improvement.

04:07:45.756 --> 04:07:56.101
If we've identified problems on specific groups, districts need to be able to modify their LCAPs, have to, in order to move forward.

04:07:56.341 --> 04:07:58.522
So we need some more guidance on that.

04:07:58.562 --> 04:07:58.782
Thanks.

04:08:05.225 --> 04:08:08.027
Sheila Whitley speaking for California Teachers Association.

04:08:08.867 --> 04:08:16.272
CTA is disappointed that there was no opportunity to provide public comment on the revised ESSA plan this time.

04:08:17.393 --> 04:08:19.434
We've had an opportunity.

04:08:19.454 --> 04:08:20.314
That's the wrong item.

04:08:20.675 --> 04:08:21.455
That's the next item.

04:08:21.475 --> 04:08:22.756
The ESSA plan is the next item.

04:08:23.336 --> 04:08:24.637
This is the system of support.

04:08:24.677 --> 04:08:24.777
Sorry.

04:08:24.857 --> 04:08:25.758
Thank you very much.

04:08:33.444 --> 04:08:35.965
Good afternoon, Sarah Lillis, Executive Director of Teach Plus.

04:08:36.966 --> 04:08:53.073
We were encouraged to hear Melanie talking about moving from principles to more concrete action, and like the Equity Coalition highlighted, one of the areas where we feel like there needs to be more clear articulation of what steps and action is on the role of stakeholders

04:08:53.773 --> 04:08:57.614
in this process, and particularly, our teachers are most interested in the role of teachers.

04:08:57.734 --> 04:09:03.455
Specifically, if you want to have sustainable, comprehensive change in a school, they have to be central to that process.

04:09:03.515 --> 04:09:20.379
And so, we would encourage the board and the cross-agency to think about what are the steps, whether it's training on needs assessment, or what are the levers for the state to ensure that this is happening in a meaningful way and that teachers are at the center of this continuous improvement and this change.

04:09:27.352 --> 04:09:31.617
President Kirsten, Brian Reeves speaking on behalf of the Education Trust West.

04:09:32.477 --> 04:09:38.624
I want to agree with my colleague, Mr. Affeldt, on the point he made about meaningful engagement.

04:09:38.844 --> 04:09:44.610
I think we'd like to see greater assurance that communities and the public will have an opportunity.

04:09:44.690 --> 04:09:49.916
Well, one, we think they need to know when an LEA, their LEA is identified for

04:09:50.797 --> 04:09:59.686
And two, we think they deserve an opportunity to play a role in the discussion around how the LEA is helped once identified.

04:10:00.106 --> 04:10:05.092
And we think that the root cause analysis will be enhanced by the inclusion of the public

04:10:06.313 --> 04:10:16.181
Secondly, I was pleased to hear the discussion around the way assistance is provided in the context of a particular group.

04:10:16.722 --> 04:10:20.885
We think it would be a mistake to focus narrowly on a particular subgroup.

04:10:21.246 --> 04:10:30.314
I think we're in the same page with regard to the need for a broader systemic analysis that looks at how the school is doing for everyone.

04:10:31.535 --> 04:10:36.158
And that will be the most meaningful way to actually get at the improvement that's needed.

04:10:36.178 --> 04:10:36.779
Thank you.

04:10:41.102 --> 04:10:41.582
Good afternoon.

04:10:41.602 --> 04:10:43.024
My name is Ephraim Mercado from Children Now.

04:10:43.464 --> 04:10:58.836
I'd like to highlight our letter that we sent to you guys and also say that between the state board items, the cross agency group expanding their participation groups, as well as the January budget, we think that the system is on a very promising trajectory to really have an impact in our state.

04:10:59.636 --> 04:11:23.612
All that said, we have some questions within our letter that we still want to discuss with State Board and CDE and the key groups, but also feel that the best path forward for equity across our state and for closing the achievement gaps will be through the robust articulation of what level one supports really are and how districts receive them, whether that's different for a large district that can do it themselves, medium to small that need more support, what that looks like will be very key, and we look forward to partnering with you guys in the future on this.

04:11:23.812 --> 04:11:24.032
Thank you.

04:11:26.427 --> 04:11:28.531
OK, that concludes the public comment.

04:11:30.255 --> 04:11:31.337
Board member Ortiz will comment.

04:11:33.173 --> 04:11:38.297
Several of the speakers asked about the root cause analysis and the role of stakeholders.

04:11:38.757 --> 04:11:42.380
So I'm wondering if somebody could describe that process.

04:11:42.740 --> 04:11:47.843
The other comment was around the LCAP template and I think that was mentioned earlier on.

04:11:47.863 --> 04:11:48.964
It is a living document.

04:11:49.004 --> 04:11:51.106
It is intended to be updated based on new data.

04:11:51.506 --> 04:11:54.368
So I think that question has been answered during item one.

04:11:54.848 --> 04:11:59.351
But if you could address the root cause analysis and the role that stakeholders play in this optional

04:12:00.773 --> 04:12:04.162
an optional role that stakeholders like teachers, parents, and others would play.

04:12:04.703 --> 04:12:05.104
Absolutely.

04:12:05.365 --> 04:12:05.926
Melanie Sheppy.

04:12:09.059 --> 04:12:12.660
I think what's so important is I'm glad that people are asking about this.

04:12:13.080 --> 04:12:18.082
The fact that if someone had a concern that stakeholders wouldn't be involved, that they have a place to ask.

04:12:18.162 --> 04:12:27.105
And we actually, we being the different state agencies, got an email a few days ago from an advocacy group wondering the same question.

04:12:27.145 --> 04:12:33.227
And we were able to create some talking points around stakeholder engagement so that it's very clear

04:12:34.267 --> 04:12:43.430
The improvement work that you do when you're eligible for differentiated assistance should show up in your LCAP, which means it should be part of your LCAP process.

04:12:44.231 --> 04:13:01.197
Part of an LCAP process is stakeholder engagement, not only in selection of actions and services, but in setting goals and understanding your needs and what's underneath your student outcomes, both qualitative and the indicators on the dashboard, but also your local data.

04:13:03.740 --> 04:13:12.467
I think there's this very specific point of, well, what about that, those initial data, analyzing data between counties and districts?

04:13:13.468 --> 04:13:16.851
Is there a policy that you have to have the specific representation?

04:13:17.351 --> 04:13:26.198
And what we're saying is your stakeholders have to be involved in your LCAP process, and your LCAP and your LCAP process have to reflect your improvement work.

04:13:26.959 --> 04:13:31.122
And the mechanics of those initial data analysis meetings

04:13:32.059 --> 04:13:35.460
There's no absolute process of who has to be involved.

04:13:35.580 --> 04:13:41.361
So some counties have had several data and are starting kind of a series of data analysis meetings.

04:13:41.621 --> 04:13:52.904
First, it's between the district leadership team and the county leadership team, and then the subsequent meeting is between the county team and the district team and community stakeholder groups and teachers and principals.

04:13:54.004 --> 04:14:04.233
Other counties kind of started, I think you heard Ed Manansala, they started with the first initial data analysis sessions or meetings with community groups there at the table.

04:14:04.953 --> 04:14:16.142
So I think the actual mechanics and breakdown of that data analysis and the support counties are giving will look different in each context, but your improvement work needs to show up in your LCAP.

04:14:16.323 --> 04:14:20.106
It needs to be part of your LCAP process, which is dependent on stakeholder engagement.

04:14:20.626 --> 04:14:27.311
And so we're working on some talking points to make sure that's something we can send out through all the advocacy groups and all the state agencies so we're having the same message.

04:14:28.152 --> 04:14:32.555
But I'm really glad people feel comfortable enough to bring that up so that we can address it.

04:14:34.677 --> 04:14:36.058
Board member Sun.

04:14:36.558 --> 04:14:40.581
So what you just said makes absolute sense and it's aligned with the purpose of the LCAP.

04:14:41.022 --> 04:14:48.287
How will stakeholders know if a school or district has been identified for support?

04:14:50.438 --> 04:14:52.939
Well, I think that will also come across in a variety of ways.

04:14:52.999 --> 04:15:03.044
So it might be a part of the LCAP process and discussion of the data and how a district sharing the support they're getting from their county with stakeholders.

04:15:03.445 --> 04:15:06.966
There's also a posted list of all of the assistance status.

04:15:07.146 --> 04:15:15.951
So if you go on the accountability web page and then also the local control funding web page, there's an Excel spreadsheet that has every district of California.

04:15:16.491 --> 04:15:19.214
and if they have general assistance or differentiated assistance.

04:15:19.475 --> 04:15:25.803
And then if it is differentiated assistance, the student group, how they were identified.

04:15:25.923 --> 04:15:32.391
So that's an additional place if someone wants to find the information on their own, but is for some reason not getting it somewhere else.

04:15:34.642 --> 04:15:48.393
So I do think that it would be a high expectation to have parents who may not be familiar with the information to look at their specific school or district information LEA and then go to a different website to try to find that identification.

04:15:50.154 --> 04:16:04.543
Are we looking at maybe the districts or LEAs self-identifying in their LCAPs, a place where it says, hey, these are the schools that have been identified or we've been identified in some way or on the dashboard or any of that?

04:16:05.339 --> 04:16:06.039
That's a good question.

04:16:06.079 --> 04:16:09.721
And I think what we can also do is ask counties and districts how that has unfolded.

04:16:09.941 --> 04:16:19.425
So what are some of the best practices in how districts are engaging with their differentiated assistance eligibility and that specific piece with their community?

04:16:19.485 --> 04:16:29.449
And then we can make sure we publicize those and we get those out to all districts so they know, here's some best practices of how to actually engage with this eligibility for differentiated assistance.

04:16:30.029 --> 04:16:33.811
But as far as I know right now, there's no specific prompt where a district would say,

04:16:34.632 --> 04:16:36.079
I was eligible for differentiated assistance.

04:16:40.290 --> 04:16:44.053
So what I heard was a second from Ting Sun to add that to the dashboard.

04:16:44.653 --> 04:16:50.598
Because I know that it was part of the memos, December one of the memos identified the districts.

04:16:51.539 --> 04:16:55.802
And it's an Excel sheet with a host of cells.

04:16:56.002 --> 04:17:02.607
And I was trying to compare that to a legend to see what subgroups prompted the identification.

04:17:02.627 --> 04:17:06.330
And then it was like general support, what's the other level?

04:17:06.790 --> 04:17:08.132
Differentiate it.

04:17:08.512 --> 04:17:12.496
And of course, I'm trying to just get a list with differentiate it just to minimize it.

04:17:12.556 --> 04:17:15.519
So I'm sitting there deleting the general support.

04:17:15.640 --> 04:17:17.261
It was a lot of work.

04:17:17.502 --> 04:17:20.304
And I'm kind of in this, right?

04:17:20.345 --> 04:17:24.409
And so I'm looking at different things to try to figure out, well, what is this telling me?

04:17:24.729 --> 04:17:27.792
And then, of course, we received more simplified versions of it.

04:17:28.413 --> 04:17:40.277
But the point is that you do have to visit several places and you would have to know as a parent off the street that there is this memo on this website that would tell you if your district has been identified.

04:17:40.617 --> 04:17:50.221
So I think that we need to really be transparent and simplify that and assume that the rest of the world does not tune into these meetings and may know what we know.

04:17:51.001 --> 04:18:00.947
I think that's also a place where the GIS mapping would be helpful because when I saw it visually, it just kind of opened up a lot for me.

04:18:01.007 --> 04:18:06.811
So I think making sure that we work towards having that be something that's accessible and public could also address this.

04:18:10.371 --> 04:18:20.056
So I appreciate Melanie, when you started today, saying I'm going to recapture for you from July and September and November, and that this is a project that is developing over time.

04:18:20.516 --> 04:18:26.999
And so I feel like questions I even had yesterday before the meeting are starting to be more clarified about what our plans are.

04:18:27.079 --> 04:18:33.522
And I know the staff and the collaborative partners are planning more updates in March, and we'll have more specifics in March.

04:18:34.042 --> 04:18:41.966
With that, there were some clarifying questions and comments from our stakeholders who did public comment, and we had followed up with staff.

04:18:42.006 --> 04:18:45.067
I just want to clarify directions and updates.

04:18:45.187 --> 04:18:47.949
We are continuing to put new data on our dashboard.

04:18:48.429 --> 04:18:56.112
My understanding is that the governor's budget has some money in it, and there will be stakeholder input to look at continued improvements in the dashboard.

04:18:56.533 --> 04:18:57.333
That's correct, right?

04:18:57.813 --> 04:19:00.915
So information to make it more linked and

04:19:01.995 --> 04:19:04.657
what is on it, we're gonna continue to hear about that.

04:19:04.737 --> 04:19:07.539
So that's one that I think we're getting better at this.

04:19:08.945 --> 04:19:16.148
Two, that as we put more data, like we know EL and we know college and career is coming up next year, there'll be additional data provided.

04:19:16.168 --> 04:19:26.293
And it's my understanding as a board member and has been part of this process, that the legislation requires that districts use the data to do updates.

04:19:26.333 --> 04:19:27.734
That's why there's an annual update.

04:19:28.294 --> 04:19:33.897
And there seems to be a misconception that I do a three-year plan, not by a lot of people, I think, I'm not sure.

04:19:34.677 --> 04:19:55.053
I just want to clarify from the understanding from CDE, who we hear does lots of monitoring compliance as well as leadership in going forward on new ideas, that this is an expectation that we have that people will use current data to update their plans, inform their practices, and that it's the county office's role to make sure that that is being done.

04:19:55.073 --> 04:19:56.774
Is that true?

04:19:56.794 --> 04:19:57.755
Absolutely, that's correct.

04:19:58.115 --> 04:19:58.335
Okay.

04:19:58.475 --> 04:20:04.656
And that we will see more next steps in our March meeting about how this will develop as more.

04:20:05.077 --> 04:20:10.078
And then, and when will the state, do we know when the stakeholder input sessions on the dashboard, are they starting soon?

04:20:11.098 --> 04:20:11.458
I'm not sure.

04:20:11.478 --> 04:20:22.680
I think, I don't think we, I want to make, I want to make sure we don't get ahead of the budget, but I know that when those get planned and all that plan that I'm sure Cindy would then present that and also get your feedback on it.

04:20:22.700 --> 04:20:23.161
Okay.

04:20:23.601 --> 04:20:23.881
Thank you.

04:20:24.461 --> 04:20:25.221
Board member Rucker.

04:20:27.711 --> 04:20:42.192
Well, I want to again thank all of the folks who made the journey to come and make the presentations and talk to us about what is going on with the rollout and development of the systems of support for education across the state.

04:20:43.536 --> 04:21:02.994
In the good old, bad old days of accountability, there used to be this very expensive mandate that the state had to require districts to annually send letters to parents about the status of their school in the district and all of the work that that status actually meant.

04:21:03.675 --> 04:21:29.919
And they had to send all of these, it was an avalanche of paper and of notices that went home to parents that while the effort was to create this, to remove or push aside the curtains so that it created great transparency, it actually did more to obliterate the works than it did to actually create some form or sense of engagement for parents.

04:21:31.601 --> 04:21:33.683
So what I'm hearing is two things.

04:21:33.723 --> 04:21:38.847
There's two sides of this conversation, and I'm hearing two things in this conversation.

04:21:38.867 --> 04:21:40.708
It's like we're sitting at a bargaining table.

04:21:41.129 --> 04:21:54.879
So on one side of the table is the school and the school officials saying, here are all the things we're doing, here are all the ways we are engaging, and here is all the deep levels of work that's currently going on.

04:21:55.660 --> 04:22:02.043
And on the other side of the table, there are stakeholders who are saying, we are not engaged.

04:22:03.024 --> 04:22:12.769
And so I'm touched by what the superintendent from Weaver said about defining the why and defining what it means to have met the standard.

04:22:13.389 --> 04:22:19.793
I think that we're still having a conversation about engagement and about whether or not engagement is happening.

04:22:20.293 --> 04:22:25.498
because engagement looks different depending on which side of the table you're on.

04:22:26.719 --> 04:22:44.257
For the bureaucracy who thought it was a great idea to make districts send out letters and all kind of notifications to parents, there was a belief that that was actually creating transparency and getting parents engaged and involved because if you get a letter, that should make you curious and want you to be involved.

04:22:45.069 --> 04:22:48.633
But stakeholders are talking about a different type of engagement.

04:22:49.074 --> 04:23:05.013
And so I think maybe while the guidance from CCESA and all of the agencies and the conversations you're having about the work is clear, I think the takeaway from today's conversation is we're not saying you're not talking to us.

04:23:06.220 --> 04:23:09.643
But I think there's a need to look at the preposition that's being used.

04:23:10.023 --> 04:23:14.987
Because I really did hear people say, we're talking to people.

04:23:15.567 --> 04:23:21.912
But there's a difference between talking to people and speaking with people.

04:23:22.512 --> 04:23:30.035
And I believe what I'm hearing is we need to not only look at our action verbs, but we need to understand our actions.

04:23:30.475 --> 04:23:49.241
And so the stakeholder engagement conversation is about not whether or not conversations are happening, but how the conversations are being both facilitated and conducted in ways that are meaningful to both sides of the table.

04:23:50.261 --> 04:23:51.442
So that's the first takeaway.

04:23:52.406 --> 04:24:08.636
The second takeaway is the continuing surprise that people still have about what should be going on with the LCAP and with the continuous review, monitoring, and editing and revising process.

04:24:09.356 --> 04:24:13.419
The fact that, again, we really do have some people who believe

04:24:14.332 --> 04:24:22.576
that once the LCAP has been approved by the county office, that approval means something, and in some ways, it seems like a finite process.

04:24:22.976 --> 04:24:36.783
Despite our continuing effort to show that this is a circular, continuous, cyclical process, some people still think this is linear and that there's an endpoint, and that endpoint is with the approval of the plan.

04:24:37.383 --> 04:24:41.925
I think a lot of that goes back to what my colleagues on the board have talked about,

04:24:42.560 --> 04:24:44.560
on putting the local and local control.

04:24:45.181 --> 04:25:01.624
It does require, again, not only the actions of the leadership, but a clear process so that people who are involved in this process not only know where we are in the process, but they are clear, this is something we will be coming back to.

04:25:02.184 --> 04:25:05.445
That the points of the, our goal is to reach consensus,

04:25:05.785 --> 04:25:13.931
But there will be clear points of dissent where we may not reach consensus, but it's a question we will live with because the process continues.

04:25:14.311 --> 04:25:22.697
So if we do have those places where people feel the process ended with the approval, that's a leadership issue.

04:25:22.997 --> 04:25:24.979
And that is a local control.

04:25:25.399 --> 04:25:30.965
That's an ownership and an action issue about perception and about perspective.

04:25:31.346 --> 04:25:41.938
And so I think that the work that's left to be done is not a mandate from the board demanding that you put the data into your LCAP because the statute is clear.

04:25:42.378 --> 04:26:05.554
the process is clear, the guidance is clear, the template clearly asks for evidence on how that data was considered, but there has to be clear leadership that shows when we review and read those LCAPs, we clearly see that something has changed and that change was informed by my role and my perspective as a stakeholder.

04:26:05.874 --> 04:26:12.018
So that is a leadership process, that is a local control process, and it is about taking ownership

04:26:13.217 --> 04:26:15.519
Stakeholders can take ownership in the process.

04:26:17.481 --> 04:26:18.602
Let me change that.

04:26:18.942 --> 04:26:27.290
A lot of stakeholders feel that they can take ownership in the process with permission from those that they perceive who are in control of that process.

04:26:27.811 --> 04:26:34.377
And so I think that where this conversation lives is in that conversation there locally.

04:26:38.211 --> 04:26:41.632
Yeah, you want to continue on this line?

04:26:41.652 --> 04:26:44.553
Because I wanted to shift to another topic that was brought up.

04:26:44.593 --> 04:26:48.374
Go ahead if you want to.

04:26:48.894 --> 04:26:51.675
Unfortunately, we're not able to agendize but repairing trust.

04:26:52.015 --> 04:26:55.556
And I think that that was something that that board member Sun brought up earlier.

04:26:55.996 --> 04:27:02.658
A lot of what we'll hear in the next item and in this item does have to do with the lack of trust.

04:27:03.379 --> 04:27:05.721
And rightfully so for some groups, right?

04:27:05.761 --> 04:27:09.446
There is a distrust because a system has wronged them historically.

04:27:09.867 --> 04:27:17.837
And so we cannot expect for us to put up this new system and give local control and say, just trust us, it's going to work.

04:27:18.297 --> 04:27:22.901
because we haven't given evidence to some communities that this actually will work for them.

04:27:23.282 --> 04:27:25.043
And so we need to be aware of that.

04:27:25.183 --> 04:27:30.288
And although we cannot sit here and agendize trust, we could do it.

04:27:30.368 --> 04:27:39.056
And somebody, I quoted this earlier from one of the earlier presentations when they said that they were looking at problematic practices, policies, and procedures.

04:27:39.416 --> 04:27:43.400
And the thing is that trust is manifested when we're looking at policies,

04:27:43.760 --> 04:27:46.842
We're looking at practices and procedures and processes, right?

04:27:47.243 --> 04:27:55.669
And so I think that on our end, that is one way that we could really try to restore trust with some of our stakeholders and students and communities.

04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:59.532
But that's something that has to be really be done at the local level.

04:27:59.852 --> 04:28:06.317
Because it doesn't matter if we come up with the best system, it won't be a good system if there isn't trust.

04:28:06.457 --> 04:28:12.301
And we unfortunately don't have the track record to really say, tell people, just trust us, it's going to work.

04:28:14.731 --> 04:28:23.176
I wanted to comment on the some groups saying that, you know, implying at least of me that they don't want to, they don't need to do an annual update.

04:28:24.457 --> 04:28:33.242
And this is surprising and I'd like maybe Jeff Beshears could come up and this is in the law, right?

04:28:33.302 --> 04:28:36.944
The annual update, it's been a crucial part of our theory of change.

04:28:38.078 --> 04:28:47.664
How, you know, could you clarify what the legal situation is and how you view the annual update requirements in the LCAP now?

04:28:48.283 --> 04:28:51.705
Jeff Breshears, again, Director of Local Agencies Support Office.

04:28:52.205 --> 04:29:03.190
Certainly statute and the LCAP template itself requires an annual update and to look at the data that is provided, not only on a local level, but within the dashboard itself.

04:29:03.671 --> 04:29:15.116
When the board adopted the three-year fixed year plan, it's not a static plan, and we were very careful not to say a static plan, but a three-year fixed plan was the idea to set a three-year goal.

04:29:15.156 --> 04:29:16.777
Look, where do we want to be in three years?

04:29:17.157 --> 04:29:24.644
and then what are we going to do in between to get there and evaluate that our progress is the LEA's progress of getting to that three-year goal.

04:29:25.024 --> 04:29:35.053
And so absolutely it is expected, required to look at the data and to look at their progress and LEA's progress on an annual basis

04:29:35.573 --> 04:29:42.997
One of the prompts within the annual update in the template says, as a result of your review, what are you going to do differently?

04:29:43.397 --> 04:30:00.946
And then the template then allows to identify goals that are either new, modified, or potentially unchanged, and also the actions and services are either new, modified, based on the review of data at the local level, and also review on the data within the dashboard.

04:30:02.586 --> 04:30:09.748
Thank you for that clarity and we will try and communicate that through CDE and other purposes.

04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:13.349
Any other comments on this item?

04:30:15.010 --> 04:30:15.430
Thank you.

04:30:15.630 --> 04:30:19.411
If not, we're ready to move to item five.

04:30:19.451 --> 04:30:21.151
We already did item four.

04:30:23.272 --> 04:30:29.594
And we'll have a CDE presenter, but before we do, Marguerite Reese is here.

04:30:30.731 --> 04:30:34.753
I wanted to lay out some of the background as I see it at least.

04:30:36.234 --> 04:30:37.435
After hearing from the U.S.

04:30:37.455 --> 04:30:44.019
Department of Education in December, we heard the day 21st right before the Christmas weekend.

04:30:46.521 --> 04:30:49.342
So that's part of why we're scrambling for time.

04:30:49.463 --> 04:30:59.929
It is clear that we needed to provide more background in the specifics of our state system of accountability in our state plan and some other parts of the plan.

04:31:03.992 --> 04:31:07.154
I don't think they were able to grasp what we were really doing.

04:31:08.714 --> 04:31:13.236
We hope that the new detail in the state plan will clarify the issues raised.

04:31:14.522 --> 04:31:15.923
And we'll hear about that more.

04:31:17.304 --> 04:31:22.909
We made the decision to wait for three years of data before finalizing our State Plan.

04:31:23.689 --> 04:31:25.651
And this pushed our timeline out.

04:31:26.471 --> 04:31:32.156
I suspect we might be in the last third of States that are finally processed by the

04:31:34.137 --> 04:31:34.398
U.S.

04:31:34.418 --> 04:31:35.639
Department of Education.

04:31:35.679 --> 04:31:45.248
And I think including three years of data rather than two years was the right decision to make, particularly, for example, on our new assessment data.

04:31:45.948 --> 04:31:54.796
And so I think that's something that we did right, but it'll make us, I think, a little slower in the processing.

04:31:56.037 --> 04:31:58.139
We are, in March, going to

04:32:00.079 --> 04:32:08.455
finalize a discussion of the identification of low-performing schools to provide more time to hear from our stakeholders.

04:32:09.548 --> 04:32:27.094
And we also have taken the opportunity learned from our peers in other states that have approved ESSA plans especially in the large diverse states to see how their plans address the requirements of ESSA and how that might give us some guidance on how we go.

04:32:27.835 --> 04:32:37.058
So our goal continues to be the creation of one coherent system of accountability rather than what we had under NCLB and with that I will turn it over

04:32:38.102 --> 04:32:46.854
to Marguerite to introduce this item and help us understand what are changes being recommended to the board.

04:32:49.261 --> 04:32:53.304
Well, thank you, President Kirst, Chief Deputy Price, and members of the board.

04:32:53.364 --> 04:32:58.268
My name is Marguerite Reese, and I serve as CDE's Federal Policy Liaison in the Government Affairs Division.

04:32:58.788 --> 04:33:03.632
I am a different face, I think, than they're used to seeing talking about the ESSA State Plan.

04:33:04.452 --> 04:33:07.755
Barbara Murchison was California's ESSA State Lead.

04:33:08.315 --> 04:33:25.710
And shortly after our state plan was turned in in September of last year, Barb took a position as the Director of the Professional Learning and Support Division, and so the work of the state plan transferred within CDE to the Government Affairs Division, which is why I am here before you today.

04:33:25.730 --> 04:33:33.957
I do have formal remarks prepared, and I will be happy to answer technical questions at the end of my presentation.

04:33:35.441 --> 04:33:41.346
So as President Kirst indicated in his opening remarks, I will provide information related to the first half of item five.

04:33:41.787 --> 04:33:58.321
The approval of the revisions to the Every Student Succeeds Act Consolidated State Plan and Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch, will then provide the update to the eligibility criteria for the identification of the lowest performing Title I schools.

04:34:00.336 --> 04:34:02.758
There are four attachments related to this item.

04:34:03.319 --> 04:34:09.944
My comments today will begin with an update of the ESSA state plan submission revision and approval process.

04:34:10.745 --> 04:34:13.067
I will then provide an overview of the feedback from the U.S.

04:34:13.107 --> 04:34:17.791
Department of Education or ED related to the ESSA state plan submitted in September of 2017.

04:34:19.679 --> 04:34:27.587
Attachment 1 includes a matrix of ED's interim feedback cross-referenced with the page numbers from California's ESSA state plans.

04:34:28.708 --> 04:34:35.695
Attachments 2 and 3 of item 5 provide identical content but are displayed for the board using two different formats.

04:34:36.676 --> 04:34:49.625
State and federal agencies must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which in part requires documents and other public resources provided by public agents to be accessible for individuals with disabilities.

04:34:50.366 --> 04:34:56.110
Attachment 2 displays the proposed revisions of California's ESSA State Plan in a format compliant with Section 508.

04:34:57.831 --> 04:35:05.463
You will note that the new language is displayed in green highlight, changes in yellow highlight, and deletions in red highlight.

04:35:05.883 --> 04:35:11.331
Additions, changes, and deletions are further delineated by double brackets indicating the modification.

04:35:12.839 --> 04:35:20.181
Again, Attachment 3 includes the proposed revisions to California's ESSA State Plan displayed using Microsoft Word Track Changes formatting.

04:35:20.782 --> 04:35:23.783
The formatting in Attachment 3 is the method in which the U.S.

04:35:23.803 --> 04:35:27.824
Department of Education has requested that revisions to state plans be resubmitted.

04:35:29.325 --> 04:35:38.968
Once I've completed my update, I will pause to answer clarifying questions from the board, and then I'll turn it back over to Carrick to provide the second half of the item, which includes information from Attachment 4.

04:35:42.202 --> 04:35:55.347
As the board takes a second look at our ESSA state plan, I will spend just a few moments reiterating the foundational elements of the Every Student Succeeds Act, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA.

04:35:56.288 --> 04:36:04.051
The ESSA maintains the original purpose of ESEA, excuse me, ESSA maintains the original purpose of ESEA, equal opportunity for all students.

04:36:04.491 --> 04:36:09.733
This act ensures that disadvantaged and high-need students receive the same educational opportunities as their peers.

04:36:10.573 --> 04:36:15.535
A hallmark of the 2015 reauthorization is the increased emphasis on local control.

04:36:16.316 --> 04:36:20.798
ESSA grants much more authority to states than under its predecessor, No Child Left Behind.

04:36:21.818 --> 04:36:26.100
Despite a change in presidential administration since the law was reauthorized, the U.S.

04:36:26.120 --> 04:36:32.203
Department of Education, led by Secretary DeVos, has continued to encourage local collaboration through increased flexibility.

04:36:32.964 --> 04:36:37.646
As you can see at the bottom of this slide, Deputy Assistant Secretary Jason Botell was quoted as saying,

04:36:38.247 --> 04:36:42.185
Each state has flexibility in how it meets the statutory and regulatory requirements.

04:36:44.775 --> 04:36:50.997
In the years prior to the reauthorization of ESEA, California embarked in an overhaul of its public education system.

04:36:51.297 --> 04:36:54.679
New standards, frameworks, and instructional materials were developed and adopted.

04:36:54.699 --> 04:36:57.400
A corresponding assessment system was implemented.

04:36:57.920 --> 04:37:07.864
And California's new accountability and continuous improvement system, rooted in the local control funding formula and local control accountability plans, was rolled out across the state.

04:37:09.119 --> 04:37:18.207
In many ways, the principles of the Every Student Succeeds Act complement California's efforts to increase our resources and attention on continuous improvement for all student groups.

04:37:20.612 --> 04:37:31.757
California continues to be committed to ensuring the ESSA Consolidated State Plan simultaneously meets the federal requirements while allowing for the full implementation of the Local Control Funding Formula.

04:37:32.458 --> 04:37:43.723
The State Plan originally submitted in September and the proposed revisions provided today for the Board's consideration both outline the steps taken to develop an integrated state, federal, and local accountability system.

04:37:44.523 --> 04:37:54.607
As previously indicated, the work to integrate the revised federal requirements are grounded in the principle of the LCFF, which empowers local communities to make local decisions to address local needs.

04:37:55.687 --> 04:38:00.789
Throughout the plan development process, the Board and most stakeholders have been in full agreement on this point.

04:38:03.083 --> 04:38:13.833
Following the action taken to approve the ESSA Consolidated State Plan at the September 2017 State Board of Education meeting, California submitted its application on the 15th of September.

04:38:14.573 --> 04:38:22.320
Peer reviews took place in late October and early November for just three sections of all state plans, Title I, Title III, and McKinney-Vento.

04:38:23.121 --> 04:38:24.582
From the date of submission, the U.S.

04:38:24.622 --> 04:38:26.924
Department of Education had 120 days to review states' plans.

04:38:30.876 --> 04:38:34.419
A few days, as President Kirst indicated, before the winter holiday, the U.S.

04:38:34.439 --> 04:38:42.485
Department of Education reached out to California to set up a time to review their feedback of our state plan and provide their interim feedback letter.

04:38:43.186 --> 04:38:49.150
Staff from the State Board of Education and the California Department of Education participated in a conference call with staff from the U.S.

04:38:49.190 --> 04:38:51.572
Department of Education on December 21st.

04:38:52.453 --> 04:38:59.078
During the call, ED staff walked through each of the points listed in the interim feedback letter and provided for the board today in Attachment 1.

04:39:00.319 --> 04:39:11.182
The tone of the call was collegial and professional and by all accounts appears to be similar in tone and duration with the conversations between other states and ED regarding feedback on their plans.

04:39:11.762 --> 04:39:21.004
I speak regularly with my counterparts from other states and they confirmed that ED is deliberately working to provide a uniform process for all September submission states.

04:39:21.624 --> 04:39:23.665
In most instances during our call,

04:39:24.548 --> 04:39:28.929
ED staff read directly from their letter and occasionally provided some additional commentary.

04:39:29.489 --> 04:39:44.114
In several instances in which ED staff requested additional information, State Board and CDE staff were able to point out and reference where the information was contained in different areas of the plan, information contained within the disproportionate rates of access to educators being one example.

04:39:45.214 --> 04:39:49.796
The following day, ED posted the interim feedback letter and peer review notes to their website.

04:39:50.696 --> 04:39:56.819
The materials for this item of your agenda, item five, were posted to the State Board of Education's website on January 5th.

04:39:57.339 --> 04:40:05.342
On January 9th, the CDE hosted a public in-person webinar meeting related to the proposed revisions to the state plan for the accountability sections.

04:40:05.922 --> 04:40:08.003
Staff walked through the areas of feedback from the U.S.

04:40:08.023 --> 04:40:11.886
Department of Education and described the proposed modifications to our state plan.

04:40:12.406 --> 04:40:15.608
There were approximately 100 individuals that participated in that meeting.

04:40:17.045 --> 04:40:25.108
During the call with ED, staff indicated that all states were required to respond to the feedback by resubmitting their revised plans within 15 calendar days.

04:40:25.728 --> 04:40:28.649
Many states opted to resubmit within their 15-day window.

04:40:28.809 --> 04:40:40.833
However, given that in California any revisions to the ESSA State Plan must be reviewed and approved by the Board, California requested and was granted an extension for resubmittal until January 26,

04:40:41.854 --> 04:40:47.293
to allow for the proposed revisions to the state plan to be brought before the board today for your consideration.

04:40:48.999 --> 04:40:54.223
As you will recall, states were permitted to submit their ESSA state plans in either April or September of last year.

04:40:54.803 --> 04:40:58.425
As of this morning, 26 state plans have been approved by Secretary DeVos.

04:40:59.426 --> 04:41:06.691
16 states and the District of Columbia submitted their plans as part of the April submission window, and all but one of those states, which is Colorado, have been approved.

04:41:07.312 --> 04:41:09.833
Another 34 states turned in their plans this fall.

04:41:10.394 --> 04:41:14.016
Thus far, 13 of the September states and territories have now been approved.

04:41:14.977 --> 04:41:17.438
And 11 of them were approved just earlier this week.

04:41:18.519 --> 04:41:22.722
It is worth also noting that no states were immediately approved upon their submission.

04:41:23.123 --> 04:41:25.084
All received at least one round of feedback.

04:41:25.464 --> 04:41:33.791
California's approach is somewhat different than those recently approved September submission states and that our state board weighs in on each draft of the state plan.

04:41:37.059 --> 04:41:45.322
The proposed revisions to the ESSA state plan clarify technical points and provide additional information that will help bridge differences between our state and the U.S.

04:41:45.342 --> 04:41:49.243
Department of Education on interpreting key elements of the ESSA statute.

04:41:49.803 --> 04:41:53.284
The revisions offer a deeper explanation of what the plan contains.

04:41:56.323 --> 04:42:06.792
Unlike the September submitted version of the ESSA State Plan, the proposed revisions included in Attachments 2 and 3 add additional state systems context to clarify how federal and state requirements fit together.

04:42:07.572 --> 04:42:12.877
The expectations of LCAPs, Local Control Accountability Plans, are woven throughout the revisions.

04:42:13.217 --> 04:42:20.563
The revised state plan has the same intents as the September submitted version, but with greater rationale and explanation for each of the items raised.

04:42:21.264 --> 04:42:23.265
Specifically, related to items 1, 3, 5, and 11,

04:42:25.587 --> 04:42:35.051
California has provided statewide student level data for all student groups for the English Language Arts, Mathematics, Graduation Rates, and the English Learner Progress Indicators.

04:42:35.811 --> 04:42:48.296
We have added 5x5 tables to the suspension rate for elementary, middle, and high schools, and added data from November of 2017, which of course was unavailable when the state plan was originally submitted in September.

04:42:51.175 --> 04:42:54.796
The following slide highlights the areas of feedback identified by the U.S.

04:42:54.816 --> 04:42:55.916
Department of Education.

04:42:56.496 --> 04:43:02.777
All page numbers I will reference during this slide are related to attachment to the section 508 compliant version.

04:43:03.917 --> 04:43:13.379
During the call with ED, staff requested and the CD has provided for the first bullet change, additional information for how goals meet the statutory requirement.

04:43:13.559 --> 04:43:16.000
Modifications can be found in item one, page 22,

04:43:17.068 --> 04:43:18.869
academic achievement, long-term goals.

04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:29.516
The state plan provides additional information for how goals meet the statutory requirements and includes new statewide baseline data for all students and each student group in ELA and math.

04:43:29.716 --> 04:43:31.036
This can be found on page 30.

04:43:31.857 --> 04:43:38.821
These baseline data are also included for graduation rate, page 41, and the English learner progress indicator, page 48.

04:43:40.402 --> 04:43:47.565
Please note that there is a typographical error on the English Language Arts statewide student group table for the socioeconomically disadvantaged student group.

04:43:48.065 --> 04:43:52.687
The change is listed as negative 44.6, and it should be negative 1.3.

04:43:52.967 --> 04:43:54.328
This is found on pages 30 and 38.

04:43:54.368 --> 04:43:58.450
This will be corrected before the state plan is resubmitted to ED.

04:43:59.830 --> 04:44:06.953
The state plan also discusses that many student groups would need to make significantly more progress to meet the goal within seven years, pages 29 and 30.

04:44:09.226 --> 04:44:14.773
The next bullet, interim measures, refers to item 2, found on page 32, measures of interim progress.

04:44:15.755 --> 04:44:18.939
California added context for reference to the 5 by 5 grids.

04:44:19.640 --> 04:44:23.105
We expanded references to the local control accountability plan on page 32.

04:44:24.486 --> 04:44:33.713
And this section now describes the role of the LCAP to establish goals for all students and the statutory student groups across the priority areas identified in statute.

04:44:34.534 --> 04:44:40.799
It also describes the required actions and services and related expenditures to meet the goals for student performance.

04:44:41.823 --> 04:44:54.386
California added information regarding how the LCAP template requires LEAs to discuss any indicator where the performance of one or more student groups is two or more color-coded levels below the performance for all students.

04:44:55.426 --> 04:45:02.328
We also included a note that state law requires LEAs to describe the efforts they are taking to make progress to close those gaps.

04:45:03.768 --> 04:45:09.030
The state plan was also updated to include the required LCAP annual review and update process.

04:45:10.307 --> 04:45:19.395
Related to the college career indicator and 11th grade assessments in item one, part B, page 31, the academic achievement long-term goals that include high school.

04:45:20.296 --> 04:45:31.786
The revisions provide further context for the purpose of the CCI, the extensive research completed during its development, and the indicator's background as a cornerstone as an academic achievement measure for secondary schools.

04:45:32.587 --> 04:45:36.690
California provided additional third-party context about the robustness of the CCI.

04:45:38.174 --> 04:45:48.621
Related to the English learner progress indicator, item five, page 45, English learner proficiency, California provided additional context for the English learner progress indicator.

04:45:49.541 --> 04:45:55.465
One, we added that the state board felt it was important to include reclassified students from the prior year to show growth.

04:45:56.566 --> 04:46:02.570
And two, that by not including them, we cannot show progress or the growth students are making as they exit this group.

04:46:03.897 --> 04:46:07.019
Item 12, page 60, relates to the weighing of each indicator.

04:46:07.579 --> 04:46:17.844
We added language to describe that only one indicator in California's new accountability system is non-academic, the suspension rate, and the remaining six of seven indicators, or 85.7% of the indicators, are academic.

04:46:21.519 --> 04:46:28.222
Related to the identification of lowest performing schools, item 14, page 64, comprehensive support and improvement.

04:46:28.903 --> 04:46:37.187
The revisions to this section of the state plan describes technical assistance provisions in place to assist LEAs rather than schools to build local capacity.

04:46:37.447 --> 04:46:45.291
The additions further describe the 228 LEAs identified for assistance under LCFF representing 2 million students and 54% of California's

04:46:46.872 --> 04:46:48.473
non-charter Title I schools.

04:46:49.513 --> 04:46:54.376
An in-depth overview of the data simulations will be discussed as articulated in Attachment 4.

04:46:56.197 --> 04:46:57.218
The student growth model.

04:46:57.438 --> 04:47:08.544
This area of feedback is in progress as indicated in Item 1 of the SBE agenda earlier this morning, and the State Board will receive an update in a February information memorandum.

04:47:09.244 --> 04:47:11.305
And finally, access to educators.

04:47:11.965 --> 04:47:14.246
We received letters to the board related to this item.

04:47:14.466 --> 04:47:29.112
And as I mentioned earlier in my presentation, during the conference call with ED at the end of December, when they walked through California's feedback letter, CD staff were able to point staff at ED to information within this section of the plan related to the assignment of teachers in Title I schools.

04:47:29.772 --> 04:47:37.715
The plan has been revised to include the timeline for which California will determine the process through which teacher misassignment data will be collected.

04:47:41.021 --> 04:47:47.145
The California Department of Education recommends that the State Board of Education approve the revised state plan for submission to the U.S.

04:47:47.165 --> 04:47:58.811
Department of Education on January 26, 2018, pending the State Board of Education Executive Director approval of the final revisions requested by the State Board of Education and correction of any typographical errors.

04:47:59.912 --> 04:48:08.197
I will now pause and see if Dr. Kirst or others have questions from members of the board, and then I will turn it over to Cara Cashly for the second half of this item.

04:48:09.349 --> 04:48:12.715
Board members want to ask, let's have Kerrick come up.

04:48:13.056 --> 04:48:13.396
Thank you.

04:48:21.851 --> 04:48:22.192
Always.

04:48:40.700 --> 04:48:41.120
Victory.

04:48:42.922 --> 04:48:46.965
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

04:48:47.305 --> 04:48:51.929
I thank you, Marguerite, for the overview of our SSA plan.

04:48:51.969 --> 04:48:58.134
Just as a reminder, attachment four and what I am presenting for you is not for action.

04:48:58.936 --> 04:49:09.863
What I'm presenting to you is some different options and some data about lowest performing schools in California and how that might fit into our accountability system.

04:49:10.463 --> 04:49:21.650
Of course, if anything in my presentation impacts what you are taking action on, which is submitting the plan for ESSA, you can certainly make amendments to that.

04:49:22.071 --> 04:49:25.032
But we're not asking today for a decision on

04:49:26.673 --> 04:49:34.000
on what I am presenting, which is, again, the lowest performing schools and how that fits into our accountability system.

04:49:34.660 --> 04:49:49.174
The purpose for my presentation is to get some feedback from you so that we can come back to you in March and perhaps make a decision then about where we're going as far as identification of schools.

04:49:50.305 --> 04:49:56.891
So what you have an attachment for, and I first apologize, it's a lot of colors, a lot of combinations.

04:49:56.971 --> 04:50:03.878
I'm going to try to make it as simple as possible in the presentation, but at times it even confuses me.

04:50:05.619 --> 04:50:11.362
But what we're taking a look at is data from the fall 2017 dashboard.

04:50:12.143 --> 04:50:18.326
So just always keep in mind that when fall of 2018 comes along, we'll have a new dashboard, right?

04:50:18.386 --> 04:50:34.455
Because we will have a more complete dashboard as our last two indicators, state indicators, college and career, and chronic absenteeism will have more than just the data that is there now, and there is data there now, but there are no colors assigned to those two indicators.

04:50:34.875 --> 04:50:44.224
But come fall 2018, we will have a complete dashboard for all of those indicators, including the colors.

04:50:44.405 --> 04:50:50.971
I apologize for going over a little bit of background, but I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page as we have this discussion.

04:50:52.553 --> 04:50:58.699
Those of you sitting here are even more informed than those that are in the audience or those that may be listening online.

04:50:59.099 --> 04:51:01.822
And so I think it's important that we just have a little bit of background.

04:51:01.842 --> 04:51:04.926
So I apologize if some of this is a repeat for you.

04:51:05.727 --> 04:51:14.156
But ESSA requires that states identify their lowest performing Title I schools for what's called comprehensive support and improvement.

04:51:14.597 --> 04:51:17.120
Some say CSI for the acronym.

04:51:18.396 --> 04:51:27.600
California was actually one of the few states that had already been discussing their accountability system and, in fact, had quite a bit of it in place when ESSA came along.

04:51:28.040 --> 04:51:33.642
So, of course, our job, our task, is to take what we have been working on

04:51:34.182 --> 04:51:57.271
and marry it with the federal requirements so that we meet our goal of having a single, coherent accountability system, not dueling systems, not two systems, but a single system using where we are with our foundation, which is LCFF and the identification of those schools through that criteria.

04:51:58.976 --> 04:52:15.690
So again, as background, this first bullet point, what we're identifying for LCFF, same student group, must meet the criteria in two priorities, state priority areas, to be identified for assistance.

04:52:16.390 --> 04:52:17.491
And that's what we have done.

04:52:17.972 --> 04:52:22.195
Those are the 228 districts that I think you're familiar with.

04:52:22.235 --> 04:52:24.777
And we've talked about some of that this morning.

04:52:25.318 --> 04:52:26.438
So that has been done.

04:52:27.458 --> 04:52:31.420
The ESSA, though, requires criteria for identifying schools for support.

04:52:31.800 --> 04:52:40.323
And it's based on the all-student group, not what LCFF does, which is the student performance at the student group level.

04:52:42.000 --> 04:52:49.106
I am not going to go over these four bullets, but this is just a little background of where we have come in the last year or so.

04:52:49.966 --> 04:52:52.228
You have approved the criteria for LCFF.

04:52:52.689 --> 04:53:02.416
We provided you quite a while ago some three options that we might use in terms of meeting ESSA criteria for identifying those for support.

04:53:03.317 --> 04:53:23.896
There was a follow-up info memo in which we ran some data simulations on the LCFF criteria and then therefore after that took action to actually identify the 228 districts for support who are currently getting support as you heard this morning from some of our counties and districts.

04:53:25.287 --> 04:53:35.932
And then, of course, the State Board did approve the all applicable indicators methodology for the baseline methodology to identify the lowest performing schools.

04:53:36.272 --> 04:53:43.995
As a reminder, the baseline methodology being all red or all red and one orange, the baseline methodology.

04:53:45.663 --> 04:53:49.606
The dashboard itself, as you know, was released in early December.

04:53:50.026 --> 04:53:52.027
We refer to it as the fall 2017.

04:53:52.227 --> 04:53:53.869
Early December is still fall.

04:53:55.530 --> 04:54:00.693
Fall 2017 dashboard, it has six indicators as listed here that you're familiar with.

04:54:00.733 --> 04:54:09.959
And as I mentioned before, just as a reminder, in fall 2018, all of them will have colors assigned to these state indicators.

04:54:10.420 --> 04:54:12.121
The state indicators blue through red.

04:54:13.131 --> 04:54:32.168
which the colors are assigned based on both status and growth, something that is fairly unique as far as I can tell, looking at different state accountability systems, not just looking at a proficiency level, but looking at status and the growth or the change, I should say, from one year to the next.

04:54:34.795 --> 04:54:46.964
So when we look at these color determinations, it's just again a reminder that each of these indicators is in some ways unique in the way that it's looked at, the way that it's calculated, the data that it's used.

04:54:47.644 --> 04:55:01.274
For instance, the graduation rate applies to obviously schools with just 12th grade students and high school, whereas the academic indicator is just right now for grades three through eight.

04:55:02.535 --> 04:55:07.178
Graduation rate, based on a four-year cohort, means they start first time in the ninth grade.

04:55:07.519 --> 04:55:09.440
Four years later, what is their status?

04:55:10.201 --> 04:55:25.732
Suspension rate is based on what's called the cumulative enrollment, which is something that we actually fairly recently done, calculating a cumulative enrollment, and that is the number of students, not that are just there on one day in October, that are there for the whole year.

04:55:27.193 --> 04:55:34.339
And so that's referred to as a cumulative enrollment and that becomes the denominator for suspension rates.

04:55:34.759 --> 04:55:44.327
So this is all by design, each indicator looked at separately and what makes the most sense to be used as far as a calculation and a denominator when you're looking at percentage of students.

04:55:46.607 --> 04:55:55.176
Of course, colors are only assigned if a school or a district, for that matter, if it's very small, has at least 30 students.

04:55:55.696 --> 04:55:59.440
So 30 students is the minimum for calculating this.

04:56:00.181 --> 04:56:08.950
And you have to have those 30 students in both the past year and the current year in order to receive a color determination on the dashboard.

04:56:10.799 --> 04:56:17.597
The numbers of indicators are going to change on the dashboard depending on what kind of a school you are and what size of a school you are.

04:56:18.180 --> 04:56:24.544
So again, just as a reminder, a very large K-12 school might have up to six indicators.

04:56:24.604 --> 04:56:27.166
All six indicators might apply to them.

04:56:27.826 --> 04:56:32.529
If you're a high school serving 9 through 12, of course, you'll have a graduation rate.

04:56:34.250 --> 04:56:40.134
But if you have less than 30 English learners, you might have only three performance colors.

04:56:40.514 --> 04:56:46.919
And then a very small school with less than 50 students very likely could have just one of these indicators.

04:56:47.779 --> 04:57:03.190
So when we designed this system and we looked at the different color combinations, again, for those who would receive support, we give these indicators equal weight and we treat them equally in that.

04:57:04.827 --> 04:57:16.302
depending on the number of indicators you have, whether it's one, two, three, four, if you're all red, you're all red, whether that's one indicator or six indicators.

04:57:16.362 --> 04:57:22.030
If those are all the indicators you have, you would be identified in the support system.

04:57:23.942 --> 04:57:28.484
Let me step back and say something that I often find myself saying, and I apologize again if it's a repeat.

04:57:29.465 --> 04:57:34.387
What we're talking about here when we're identifying schools and districts for support is exactly that.

04:57:34.687 --> 04:57:37.389
We're using the system to identify them for the support.

04:57:38.089 --> 04:57:43.912
That doesn't mean these are the only schools or districts that are doing something, and I think you heard that this morning both from

04:57:44.552 --> 04:57:47.737
Riverside and El Dorado and Weaverville.

04:57:49.299 --> 04:57:57.550
Every school and every district are supposed to be looking at these dashboards, taking a look at their data, seeing what it is that they need to improve and make that improvement.

04:57:58.011 --> 04:58:01.456
If you have yellow, no, that's not good enough.

04:58:01.916 --> 04:58:03.218
Everyone can improve.

04:58:03.418 --> 04:58:04.619
Everyone can get better.

04:58:05.480 --> 04:58:08.964
It's not just those with reds and oranges that need to look at this data.

04:58:09.084 --> 04:58:12.267
It's everyone because everyone can improve.

04:58:12.807 --> 04:58:24.840
What we're looking at in the system of support and identifying color combinations is who might receive some outside assistance at the state level or money coming from the state down to a local level.

04:58:25.737 --> 04:58:29.338
in addition to what they have locally available to them.

04:58:29.598 --> 04:58:32.599
So who might get some additional support in this process?

04:58:35.360 --> 04:58:42.143
So the methodology for using color combinations is part of attachment four, and there are a lot of different options there.

04:58:42.243 --> 04:58:48.285
I'm not going to go over all of those color combination options for you.

04:58:48.325 --> 04:58:50.205
I think I heard a sigh of relief in there somewhere.

04:58:51.526 --> 04:58:54.387
But I will go over a few as some of the basic ones here.

04:58:55.924 --> 04:58:59.466
We did four simulations, the first one being the baseline methodology.

04:58:59.906 --> 04:59:04.028
That was the all red and the all red and one orange category.

04:59:05.028 --> 04:59:15.812
We then took a look at what ESSA requires, which is Title I schools that don't have a graduation rate as high, it needs to be as high as 67%.

04:59:15.912 --> 04:59:19.554
If they're not at 67%, then they would be identified.

04:59:22.779 --> 04:59:36.690
We also took a look at non-Title I schools because ESSA does not make a distinction in this regard in identifying a high school needing support, doesn't make a distinction as to whether it's a Title I or non-Title I school.

04:59:37.694 --> 04:59:48.557
And then last, there are some calculations in there and some different color combinations about beyond these first three, what might be used if we wanted to expand this baseline.

04:59:49.097 --> 04:59:52.878
And expanding the baseline would just mean using different color combinations.

04:59:53.218 --> 04:59:59.679
Instead of all red and one orange, the color combination might be three reds, one yellow, and one orange.

04:59:59.719 --> 05:00:02.860
And as you can imagine, the combinations are not

05:00:04.119 --> 05:00:07.303
They are limited, but there are many.

05:00:09.606 --> 05:00:22.542
Again, I'm not going to go over all of those color combinations, but we could, if we chose to do that, use different color combinations to expand what we have as far as identifying schools for assistance in districts.

05:00:23.479 --> 05:00:49.853
So using our current data, meaning the fall 2017 data, and again, fall 2018 will give us different results, but using fall 2017 data, that's part of your attachment four, took a look, if we were to look at the school level using the LCFF formula, we would identify an additional 84 districts to the 228 that have already been identified under LCFF.

05:00:51.621 --> 05:01:00.730
So the next slide is a visual that I think will help identify for you who these 84 are that would be additional.

05:01:01.992 --> 05:01:09.659
So if we kind of start in this visual from the bottom up, starting from the bottom, as I mentioned, the LCFF criteria, that's the blue.

05:01:09.840 --> 05:01:14.805
Those are the 228 districts that are already identified already receiving support.

05:01:16.172 --> 05:01:27.195
Then we use the baseline methodology, that's the all red and or all red and one orange, and that gets you an additional 17 districts for support.

05:01:28.555 --> 05:01:41.498
Then the next one up is the graduation rate, using the graduation rate of 67%, below 67%, both using Title I, non-Title I schools, that would bring in an additional 20 districts.

05:01:43.308 --> 05:01:55.035
And then lastly, if we were to use an expanded methodology, one of those methods, you'd get different numbers here, but it could identify an additional 47 districts.

05:01:55.495 --> 05:02:03.199
So you can see on the left, it is the left side, yes, the left side of your visual, the cumulative total going up.

05:02:03.359 --> 05:02:03.959
So it starts with 228.

05:02:05.180 --> 05:02:15.586
with the LCFF criteria, and then as you add each of those bars up, it can get to as many as 312 districts identified.

05:02:18.907 --> 05:02:21.529
So now, I'm gonna go back for just a second.

05:02:22.229 --> 05:02:23.730
Those are districts, right?

05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:29.413
So now let's look at how many schools this would impact if we wanted to look at the schools.

05:02:31.946 --> 05:02:37.607
So this chart, going across horizontally, it starts with the LCFF criteria.

05:02:38.307 --> 05:02:44.929
As you can see in that fourth column, 228 districts, which I've mentioned a number of times, in those 228 districts are 2,911 Title I schools.

05:02:44.949 --> 05:02:47.009
So already, under the LCFF criteria, 228 districts has 2,911 schools.

05:03:03.274 --> 05:03:04.916
Yeah.

05:03:06.298 --> 05:03:15.332
So then as we add the criteria, so the second half of the chart talks about the ESSA criteria in conjunction with the LCFF criteria.

05:03:16.007 --> 05:03:20.509
So again, the baseline methodology, looking in that fourth column, identified districts.

05:03:20.909 --> 05:03:28.032
If you remember from our visual, we added an additional 17 using the baseline methodology, all reds, all reds plus an orange.

05:03:28.593 --> 05:03:33.175
That would give us an additional 80 schools to the 2,911 schools already identified under LCFF.

05:03:33.195 --> 05:03:34.175
Then we go to the graduation rate.

05:03:43.723 --> 05:03:51.969
You go to, that would identify for those in Title I schools, it would identify eight districts, an additional 30 schools.

05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:58.414
You add in the non-Title I high schools that didn't make that 67%.

05:03:59.155 --> 05:04:03.378
That would add an additional 12 districts and an additional 28 schools.

05:04:06.007 --> 05:04:20.072
And then lastly, this expanded methodology that we talked about using different color combinations could identify 47 additional districts and another 216 schools.

05:04:21.633 --> 05:04:25.214
So when you add those up, that's a lot of schools.

05:04:25.394 --> 05:04:27.495
That's a lot of schools.

05:04:27.555 --> 05:04:30.096
And we haven't even gotten to the last line in the chart yet.

05:04:31.414 --> 05:04:39.331
So just take that in of how many schools that is that would already be identified.

05:04:39.963 --> 05:04:43.585
Then, the very last line of the chart talks about targeted support.

05:04:43.826 --> 05:04:56.053
We haven't spent a lot of time talking about targeted support, but the ESSA law does identify schools as targeted support and improvement, or TSI.

05:04:56.734 --> 05:05:00.977
So up until now, we've been talking about the comprehensive support, or the CSI.

05:05:01.417 --> 05:05:07.281
The targeted, the TSI, are schools that get identified by ESSA law

05:05:08.345 --> 05:05:22.736
in that you take the same criteria, you apply it to every student group in the schools, and if any school, any student group, one student group, doesn't meet the criteria, you would identify that school.

05:05:23.917 --> 05:05:27.720
So by applying that methodology, or at least applying it in this way,

05:05:28.831 --> 05:05:40.156
There probably are other ways to apply a methodology, but applying it in this way would identify another 2,649 schools.

05:05:42.077 --> 05:05:48.780
Now, there is one, I'm hoping this is what you had your hand up for.

05:05:48.900 --> 05:05:53.202
There is one little mathematical error on this chart.

05:05:53.583 --> 05:05:54.203
Next to it, it says 2,999.

05:05:57.276 --> 05:06:00.337
If you add the 354 to the 2649 number, it's actually 3,003 rather than 2,999.

05:06:00.497 --> 05:06:02.018
A little mathematical error there.

05:06:02.038 --> 05:06:05.619
But basically, an additional 3,000 schools we're talking about.

05:06:05.659 --> 05:06:06.360
In addition to what?

05:06:06.400 --> 05:06:07.060
In addition to the 2,911.

05:06:07.100 --> 05:06:10.901
So in summary, thank you for- The total number then is five- I'm getting there.

05:06:11.862 --> 05:06:12.002
Yeah.

05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:35.365
The gifted students are always ahead of everybody else.

05:06:35.385 --> 05:06:40.073
So these last two slides are the summary, which is exactly what you're getting to, President Kirst.

05:06:41.169 --> 05:06:51.993
First, using this Fall 17 dashboard, 2,911 schools using the LCFF criteria in 228 districts.

05:06:52.713 --> 05:07:05.138
Just those, just the LCFF criteria, look at the second bullet, that already represents more than 2 million students attending Title I schools.

05:07:06.543 --> 05:07:15.150
in these identified 228 LEAs, 54% of California's public school students in Title I schools.

05:07:15.931 --> 05:07:19.474
That's what the LCFF criteria has already identified.

05:07:20.014 --> 05:07:23.777
And it's actually 32% of the total enrollment.

05:07:24.518 --> 05:07:25.599
One more slide and we'll get there.

05:07:26.900 --> 05:07:28.901
So this is the summary chart then.

05:07:30.182 --> 05:07:35.587
That means approximately 5,900 schools could, and again this is a could,

05:07:37.309 --> 05:07:41.112
be identified for support, 2,900 under LCFF.

05:07:41.152 --> 05:07:43.213
It's actually 2911, if you remember.

05:07:43.953 --> 05:07:52.238
And 3,000 under ESSA, or 3,003 if you wanted to be precise, but again, this is using fall of 2017 dashboard numbers.

05:07:53.059 --> 05:08:06.507
One last reminder, fall of 2018, we're gonna add two more indicators, which will change the numbers, but these numbers are what we have right now, and so these are the numbers we should use to have the discussion.

05:08:08.635 --> 05:08:12.478
Yeah, I think I'm going to resign from this board and go in the technical support business.

05:08:15.201 --> 05:08:16.422
We're going to need everybody.

05:08:17.683 --> 05:08:23.648
So that is the end of the slides for this part of the presentation.

05:08:23.708 --> 05:08:24.969
So thank you.

05:08:25.030 --> 05:08:28.833
I'd like to call on member Burr first to make some comments, then we'll go around.

05:08:30.014 --> 05:08:36.377
Well, so I appreciate you putting that table back up, Kerrick, because I think that's the one that's the most relevant.

05:08:38.318 --> 05:08:52.806
So I just want to start, sort of back up for a second, and I think that during the earlier presentation about the proposed changes in the ESSA State Plan, Marguerite did a really nice job of kind of walking through how we got here.

05:08:53.526 --> 05:09:01.449
And the fundamental tenet was this federal plan is gonna be driven by our state accountability system.

05:09:02.149 --> 05:09:15.033
And I think where we were asked questions, the plan appropriately gives additional information as we should to say here's what we're doing and here's how we got here and this is the backup that maybe wasn't quite so clear in the first submission.

05:09:16.013 --> 05:09:20.274
But this part about the identification of the lowest 5% is a significant

05:09:22.676 --> 05:09:38.097
deviation from LCFF and I think we as a board have to say what what do we do about that and I for one am not comfortable with what's proposed in the plan about which yields these much higher numbers of schools and

05:09:38.377 --> 05:09:43.984
even well beyond if we just tried to hit the target number of what 5 percent would be.

05:09:44.004 --> 05:09:52.854
But it does reflect conversations that we've had before, and especially addresses some concerns I know that were addressed by

05:09:53.414 --> 05:10:04.341
board member Rucker and Ortiz-Lincon about districts where we seem to agree, I don't want to put words in people's mouth, but that our approach should be through LEAs.

05:10:04.401 --> 05:10:05.922
That's the way the system is built.

05:10:06.343 --> 05:10:08.484
Schools don't operate in isolation.

05:10:08.524 --> 05:10:12.327
They can't be successful on their own without the support of their districts, etc.

05:10:13.047 --> 05:10:18.050
So that's why LCFF premise works that you do it through LEAs.

05:10:18.351 --> 05:10:31.019
But we acknowledge while there may be some schools that really are outliers that exist in districts that are kind of bifurcated and have circumstances in which those schools would otherwise not be identified.

05:10:31.079 --> 05:10:33.901
So we agreed to add those and those would be part of this.

05:10:34.621 --> 05:10:42.008
Then we have this whole other thing about the graduation rate that I think we would all agree below 67% is not acceptable.

05:10:42.448 --> 05:10:55.419
So it does make sense to address those, but to completely deviate, and in my view, get to a place where we really would have two separate systems, a bunch of schools identified potentially

05:10:56.440 --> 05:10:59.862
as whatever we're gonna call them, targeted or comprehensive.

05:11:00.083 --> 05:11:03.485
And I would submit that 50% of our schools is not targeted.

05:11:03.505 --> 05:11:07.928
It just, on its face, doesn't make sense to me.

05:11:08.608 --> 05:11:19.296
So anyway, I just want us to think a little bit about that, and I wanna hear the rest of the conversation, but I think potentially there is some language that needs to be changed in the plan.

05:11:21.138 --> 05:11:31.530
to reflect our reaffirmation of using our state accountability system, not promising that we're gonna do these additional color combinations.

05:11:32.070 --> 05:11:39.179
And I think appropriately and in a not so subtle way keeps reminding us that we don't have all the data yet.

05:11:39.899 --> 05:11:45.424
We don't have to make these identifications, as I understand it, until the next academic year anyway.

05:11:45.964 --> 05:11:54.451
So I, for one, would not be comfortable sending a plan in that makes a commitment based on data that is not yet fully fleshed out.

05:11:57.153 --> 05:12:01.336
Again, maybe you want to comment on what we'll do in March and what we're doing here.

05:12:02.797 --> 05:12:07.681
Because we're going to go, you know, the March will have

05:12:08.547 --> 05:12:13.170
we will, the board will consider in more detail the identification of the schools.

05:12:14.331 --> 05:12:14.832
That's correct.

05:12:15.232 --> 05:12:19.695
So we're not asking for a decision today on what member Burr's talking about?

05:12:19.715 --> 05:12:34.727
So the action item for today, or the recommendation for action today, is to approve the revision to the state plan, which is most of the attachments in item five, to send back to the US Department of Education for their review.

05:12:36.709 --> 05:12:44.441
What I'm hearing Member Burr say is that there may be something in that plan to be amended, so that would be an action item today.

05:12:45.518 --> 05:13:05.845
Not asking to select a specific methodology today, but we're just here to hear some reflection from you as to what these numbers mean to you, and if there are future data simulations or things that you want to direct us to do to bring back to you in March, then we're welcome to hear those.

05:13:08.308 --> 05:13:15.771
just for clarity's sake, so people understand, the language that's in the draft, that's in attachment two, is on page 64 and 65.

05:13:16.471 --> 05:13:23.294
And it says, based on current data, here's something we would do, which is essentially we'll consider a different color combination.

05:13:23.694 --> 05:13:26.915
It also, I think, has an inaccurate statement that says,

05:13:27.515 --> 05:13:30.697
The methodology does not result in the identification of at least 5%.

05:13:32.058 --> 05:13:34.961
But we've got 2,911 schools.

05:13:35.061 --> 05:13:37.402
Like, how could that not be the case?

05:13:37.843 --> 05:13:40.024
We're way over the number.

05:13:40.165 --> 05:13:43.667
So anyway, that's the language that I'm most concerned about.

05:13:43.687 --> 05:13:45.509
I just don't think we want to put that forward.

05:13:47.270 --> 05:13:47.550
All right.

05:13:47.650 --> 05:13:49.411
I think board member Rucker was next.

05:13:49.572 --> 05:13:49.792
Yeah.

05:13:50.192 --> 05:13:50.572
Pardon?

05:13:50.612 --> 05:13:53.655
What page is the attachment to?

05:13:53.795 --> 05:13:55.096
Attachment to page 64 and 65.

05:14:01.209 --> 05:14:02.389
Member Rucker, I think you're up.

05:14:02.609 --> 05:14:10.511
Well, I'm glad that I followed my colleague, Board Member Burr, because she explained a lot of what my comments and my concerns would be.

05:14:11.172 --> 05:14:20.714
I just want to verify, and again, in honor of National Winnie the Pooh Day, I'm going to give you another quote that I think is germane to this conversation.

05:14:21.274 --> 05:14:21.875
Oh, bother.

05:14:24.284 --> 05:14:25.104
Oh, bother.

05:14:26.585 --> 05:14:35.608
I just want to be sure, when you talked about the schools that are identified under the LCFF identification, that's 2,911 schools.

05:14:36.169 --> 05:14:43.792
And then the schools that are identified for the ESSA and LCFF identification, that's 3,003 schools.

05:14:44.392 --> 05:14:51.495
I want to make sure I heard you clearly when you said there is no overlap in names of schools in those two lists.

05:14:51.555 --> 05:14:52.315
Is that correct?

05:14:54.184 --> 05:14:56.506
Okay, so we're not actually, so.

05:14:56.707 --> 05:14:58.909
Let me repeat that for those who might not have heard that.

05:14:59.549 --> 05:15:04.314
This is not necessarily an unduplicated count, so there may be some overlap.

05:15:04.414 --> 05:15:09.939
So it's possible that we're talking about a little less than 5,000 schools, all right.

05:15:10.420 --> 05:15:12.922
So I suppose the good news in that is

05:15:13.943 --> 05:15:20.392
You know, under the old system of accountability, we were headed to 100% identification of our schools.

05:15:20.753 --> 05:15:23.356
So that would have been considerably more schools.

05:15:23.437 --> 05:15:28.704
So if you're a glasses-half-full kind of person, and I am, I always ask, well, what's in the glass?

05:15:29.365 --> 05:15:30.486
That's what's in the glass.

05:15:32.148 --> 05:15:52.664
I suppose that in looking at what's in the plan, and I also read the same statements on those pages, I have a concern that the revisions are more than material because they do seem to mark a departure from our intent to let the central driver

05:15:53.383 --> 05:16:01.374
of what we do for federal accountability purposes be focused on the use of the LCFF criteria.

05:16:02.215 --> 05:16:08.164
And in saying or suggesting here are some ways that we could do this identification

05:16:08.824 --> 05:16:23.637
I think that we are over identifying schools in the way that criteria seems to be operating because this is significantly more than 5% and it's not necessary for us.

05:16:23.917 --> 05:16:25.098
Well, let me change that word.

05:16:25.658 --> 05:16:32.141
it is of great concern that that would be the sheer number of schools that would be identified.

05:16:32.721 --> 05:16:53.949
And so I guess my question is, is it necessary for that particular revision to be included in the plan at this time, especially since we don't, we have some time between today and when the actual identification and intervention is supposed to begin to include that language in the plan at this time.

05:16:54.389 --> 05:16:58.153
because it is my feeling that that's more than a technical change.

05:16:58.673 --> 05:17:04.359
Even the mere suggestion to me seems more material as a revision than a technical revision.

05:17:04.859 --> 05:17:12.847
I'm also concerned that if we approve this draft with the changes that are suggested today, there's no public vetting.

05:17:13.207 --> 05:17:17.532
How would stakeholders who have previously weighed in on this plan

05:17:17.992 --> 05:17:19.853
have an opportunity to take a look at it?

05:17:20.293 --> 05:17:31.295
How would the CPAG, who has contributed a lot of work, a lot of study, and done a lot of recommendations to this board in looking at and reviewing this data, have an opportunity to see this?

05:17:31.756 --> 05:17:40.738
So if the action is to approve this plan, I think there needs to be some other vetting subsequently to this or some other work that's done.

05:17:41.158 --> 05:17:56.845
to make sure that the agencies and the groups that have been working with us up to this point have a chance to give us some feedback before we do all the other work that the plan suggests that we could do or that we could consider before implementation.

05:17:57.705 --> 05:18:00.747
Before you answer that, let me clarify this implication about 5%.

05:18:01.627 --> 05:18:06.709
And now you'll correct me, but there's 5% in the law.

05:18:07.249 --> 05:18:10.231
Then there's some other part of the law over here

05:18:11.195 --> 05:18:13.977
that talks and the 5% relates to schools.

05:18:14.858 --> 05:18:29.609
There's another part of the law that's, that is entirely separate that has an add-on that says targeted support must be given to any schools where any subgroup is what?

05:18:30.109 --> 05:18:32.331
Any subgroup is, is what?

05:18:36.055 --> 05:18:37.836
Yeah, any single subgroup.

05:18:38.416 --> 05:18:42.958
And that applies in our case to 13 subgroups or how many subgroups?

05:18:42.998 --> 05:18:45.039
Because we have 13 in LCFF.

05:18:48.160 --> 05:18:49.141
Thirteen subgroups.

05:18:50.161 --> 05:18:52.122
So there's a separate part of the law.

05:18:52.162 --> 05:18:54.103
So take 5% of the schools here.

05:18:54.963 --> 05:18:57.584
That's what people are wondering, having their head.

05:18:57.624 --> 05:18:59.365
But then you've got one of 13 subgroups.

05:19:02.600 --> 05:19:04.622
And those schools have to go in.

05:19:04.742 --> 05:19:09.445
And that's how you get these numbers, which I think, remember Rucker said it was 5,000?

05:19:09.485 --> 05:19:10.666
Wasn't it 5,900?

05:19:11.406 --> 05:19:12.727
Not, you know, 1,000 here and there.

05:19:12.767 --> 05:19:14.929
It doesn't seem to matter in this calculation.

05:19:14.949 --> 05:19:20.993
But, you know, I thought it was 5,900.

05:19:21.073 --> 05:19:25.096
So, yeah, it's about, that's about half our schools.

05:19:25.356 --> 05:19:27.578
It's a little bit more than half our schools.

05:19:30.260 --> 05:19:32.301
is that it's not 100% of our schools.

05:19:33.061 --> 05:19:41.142
And again, going back to Pooh, I guess it's easier to have a conversation with a person who doesn't use big, long words, but short, simple, easy words.

05:19:41.763 --> 05:19:44.143
5,900 is a really short, easy word to remember.

05:19:45.864 --> 05:19:51.385
Okay, now, I want to clarify, now you should respond to Board Member Rucker's question.

05:19:52.445 --> 05:19:53.645
I just want to get that straight.

05:19:54.165 --> 05:19:56.626
I'm sorry, I guess I missed the question.

05:19:58.692 --> 05:20:03.458
My question was kind of buried in a comment.

05:20:03.899 --> 05:20:13.130
I'm concerned that the language on page 64 and 65 seems to suggest that we're adding this identification.

05:20:14.071 --> 05:20:26.453
to the plan and that we may be overselling or over promising what our identification process will be that's going beyond our intent.

05:20:26.933 --> 05:20:42.356
So my question was how was this vetted or how will this be vetted by stakeholders that have previously weighed in on the state plan and will not have an opportunity to weigh in on this if we make this decision today

05:20:42.856 --> 05:20:54.438
and you send in the submission, and how will this be vetted and discussed by the CPAG, who also have not had the opportunity to see this suggestion and this revision?

05:20:54.878 --> 05:21:02.360
Because it seems to me this is material to conversations they have had, and the revision is more material than technical.

05:21:03.840 --> 05:21:04.540
I did understand.

05:21:08.081 --> 05:21:12.542
And to me, it sounds less like a question and more like

05:21:13.979 --> 05:21:23.866
an indication that can we amend the plan if we want more stakeholder feedback on that section?

05:21:24.847 --> 05:21:26.568
So the answer to that would be yes.

05:21:26.668 --> 05:21:28.410
I mean, that's the purpose of this action item.

05:21:28.850 --> 05:21:41.600
To either approve the revision of the state plan as it is presented to you or provide some amendments if you think it's been, if there's an overreach there, you want to walk it back and get more public input on it.

05:21:42.600 --> 05:21:43.400
That is an option.

05:21:45.222 --> 05:21:46.424
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:21:48.185 --> 05:21:57.996
Just to clarify, that option would then mean that we would have to also request a further extension to the department, which would then delay the approval of the plan.

05:21:58.356 --> 05:22:02.701
No, I was not, yeah, perhaps I wasn't clear on that.

05:22:05.248 --> 05:22:10.549
So I guess I'm assuming that this plan that we send in won't automatically be approved by the U.S.

05:22:10.589 --> 05:22:13.550
Department of Education and there would be more time for public input.

05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:19.991
I wasn't suggesting that we ask for an extension while we get that stakeholder input.

05:22:21.332 --> 05:22:22.892
I think we meet their deadline.

05:22:23.112 --> 05:22:31.774
We could even indicate in our submission in a cover letter or whatever that we're seeking more input on certain sections.

05:22:32.995 --> 05:22:44.103
One process detail I can add is that by California or any state asking for an extension, we waived our right for a 120-day review by the US Department of Education.

05:22:44.203 --> 05:22:51.168
So they have assured us informally that they will take a fair amount of time, given that we've asked essentially for two extra weeks.

05:22:51.208 --> 05:22:52.949
They will try to only take two extra weeks.

05:22:53.049 --> 05:22:59.854
But any delays on our end, I think it's safe to assume will result in more time on the US Department of Education's end.

05:23:01.578 --> 05:23:03.439
And I think I agree with you.

05:23:03.459 --> 05:23:04.919
I think that this will come back to us.

05:23:05.239 --> 05:23:09.901
There was a couple of comments that were echoed in the letter from the U.S.

05:23:09.921 --> 05:23:19.505
Department of Ed that were echoed by Bellwether Report, by Fordham Institute, by advocates, by reviewers that are still not addressed in this state plan, in this revision.

05:23:19.525 --> 05:23:28.368
So I'm going to limit my comments to the 5% identification because, you know, I stand where I stood back in September with the state plan.

05:23:29.188 --> 05:23:40.521
In terms of the bottom 5%, there was another layer that President Kurz, it is the bottom 5%, it is the targeted, and it's additional, the schools are not graduating 67%.

05:23:40.841 --> 05:23:44.925
So there are three tiers that we have to identify here.

05:23:46.287 --> 05:23:48.628
And I'm with board member Burr.

05:23:48.668 --> 05:23:56.033
The reason we were trying to identify an expanded baseline is because we were under 303, which was a magic number.

05:23:56.494 --> 05:24:01.397
And so when we had these discussions and we were looking, we were like, the magic number is 303.

05:24:01.517 --> 05:24:03.358
That's the number of schools that makes the 5%.

05:24:04.259 --> 05:24:09.002
And we were way under, so I'm not sure what happened, but I'm assuming the data dashboard happened, right?

05:24:09.022 --> 05:24:09.723
We have new data.

05:24:11.004 --> 05:24:15.486
So, I have questions about just the technicality of this.

05:24:15.587 --> 05:24:17.388
We have LCFF identification.

05:24:17.428 --> 05:24:18.248
There's overlap.

05:24:18.368 --> 05:24:20.049
We need to know how many schools overlap.

05:24:20.510 --> 05:24:26.313
But also, we have a one-year review process, identification process, and a three-year identification process.

05:24:26.434 --> 05:24:29.355
What does that mean when we're looking at identifying the bottom 5%?

05:24:30.636 --> 05:24:38.485
And when we're looking to identify the bottom 5%, right now we have only Title I schools that are part of our data dashboard.

05:24:38.746 --> 05:24:42.009
We have not included the alternative schools.

05:24:42.029 --> 05:24:51.000
So I wanna be clear that this bottom 5% is based on Title I schools, and then alternative schools will be bottom 5% of alternative schools.

05:24:51.680 --> 05:24:56.501
Otherwise, if we bring them together, the majority of those schools would be alternative schools.

05:24:57.422 --> 05:25:00.282
And then, once again, we have limited capacity.

05:25:00.583 --> 05:25:12.886
So we haven't made that decision here, and I wanna make sure that as a policy decision, we agree on what is the bottom 5%, considering that we haven't developed the dashboard for the alternative schools.

05:25:26.367 --> 05:25:32.650
So my office and our division, I'm Jenny Singh, Administrator of the Academic Accountability Unit.

05:25:33.090 --> 05:25:43.555
We have been working under the premise when we identify the 5% that we will identify 5% of Title I non-alternative schools and 5% of alternative schools.

05:25:43.855 --> 05:25:53.119
Just for the reason that you indicated, if we did Title I, if we did 5% and didn't make a distinction, all the schools that would be identified would be alternative schools.

05:25:56.141 --> 05:25:59.823
Does that mean there'll be more schools when we get the alternative?

05:25:59.943 --> 05:26:08.386
Okay, so yes, so we have maybe 60, 70 percent full and we got, you know, a hundred down from a hundred, but that's right.

05:26:08.466 --> 05:26:10.547
So we have about a thousand alternative schools.

05:26:16.010 --> 05:26:16.270
Okay.

05:26:20.063 --> 05:26:20.963
Board Member Burr.

05:26:21.904 --> 05:26:38.088
So I just again want to be clear about what we're looking at that under LCFF and reinforces especially for our commentators who we keep writing about that we're apparently not hard enough on districts that we've identified under the LCFF statute

05:26:38.228 --> 05:26:40.009
which is based on student subgroup.

05:26:40.069 --> 05:26:48.271
I'm having a hard time understanding the interaction between LCFF subgroup focus or student group focus versus targeted support.

05:26:48.291 --> 05:26:51.192
I'm also kind of messing with my mind here.

05:26:52.013 --> 05:27:02.096
But of the 228 districts identified under our system that we've been developing now for five years, of those districts, they contain 2,911 Title I schools.

05:27:06.138 --> 05:27:10.082
And could you just say out of what's the total universe of Title I schools?

05:27:10.803 --> 05:27:12.886
The Title I school, of course, changes every year.

05:27:12.906 --> 05:27:13.687
Roughly 6,000.

05:27:14.187 --> 05:27:14.868
Jenny says 6,400.

05:27:21.380 --> 05:27:25.321
So third-ish and heading toward half, okay.

05:27:26.261 --> 05:27:32.903
So I just wanted to, while Marguerite's here too, just suggest an alternative and would be happy to share language with folks.

05:27:33.323 --> 05:27:48.167
I do think we should strike those two paragraphs on page 64 and 65 because I, for one, and I think I'm hearing other people say, don't wanna go down this path of let's try to identify all the schools, which is what we would be doing by expanding

05:27:49.108 --> 05:28:03.380
Instead, do just some simple language that I think would allow for this stakeholder input language that says we would provide a plan supplement based on our March 2018 deliberations.

05:28:03.561 --> 05:28:10.407
After we have additional stakeholder input, we do some additional understanding of what this data means.

05:28:11.728 --> 05:28:13.790
I just think that might be a way to go forward.

05:28:15.492 --> 05:28:27.385
to the extent people have other questions about the plan, and I want to hear from board members Sun and Kirst, who are the federal liaisons, but that might be a way to allow us to go forward, if that makes sense.

05:28:27.445 --> 05:28:33.011
And I think Dave or somebody's got language that he could share so you can see what I'm talking about.

05:28:33.700 --> 05:28:36.843
Yeah, let me put more context in this as well.

05:28:37.723 --> 05:28:41.486
We're not the only state that's facing some of these issues.

05:28:41.526 --> 05:28:47.431
They may not be as, we may be more extreme than most because of our local plan.

05:28:48.412 --> 05:28:54.897
But if you scrutinize other state plans, they have ideas and some of them have been approved.

05:28:55.902 --> 05:29:04.866
which do not follow the literal interpretation that we have heard today, which Carrick did for enlightenment purposes.

05:29:04.947 --> 05:29:09.189
So that was what I mentioned in my opening remarks.

05:29:10.689 --> 05:29:18.833
One of my first reaction was, we can't be the only person in this, and though I think we're going to be at the extreme end.

05:29:18.893 --> 05:29:22.075
But there have been other state approaches.

05:29:22.235 --> 05:29:23.536
They have been approved.

05:29:24.316 --> 05:29:28.838
So that was part of what I think we need to take a look at.

05:29:29.719 --> 05:29:30.459
Board Member Sun.

05:29:31.579 --> 05:29:43.224
And I just, on this particular issue of identifying schools, I guess I just want to add, we did have that 5% number in our heads and so we were trying to get to that 300 some odd number, right?

05:29:43.805 --> 05:29:48.407
And the difficulty was that in trying to do that, we were trying to mesh

05:29:49.247 --> 05:29:52.828
LCFF with ESSA and it wasn't working.

05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:57.909
It wasn't working very well and frankly we're kind of punting a little bit to try to get to that number.

05:29:58.469 --> 05:30:10.212
I think when we finally just let it go and said let's trust our system, let's just trust what we've designed might actually work well and identified schools that need to be identified, this is what we got.

05:30:10.593 --> 05:30:11.933
And of course we had updated data.

05:30:12.193 --> 05:30:14.914
Because if you remember, we didn't have the fall dashboard.

05:30:14.954 --> 05:30:18.774
I mean, yeah, well, this December fall dashboard come out yet.

05:30:19.174 --> 05:30:31.177
So I think that when we saw this in the new information we have, I think is very valid reason to make some changes to the wording of this particular plan.

05:30:31.357 --> 05:30:37.818
And I think it would still allow for some time for stakeholder input, because this will be an iterative process.

05:30:38.018 --> 05:30:41.299
I'm sure this is not going to be submission, and then that's going to be it.

05:30:44.727 --> 05:30:45.327
Yes, go ahead.

05:30:45.367 --> 05:30:57.549
The other thing, too, that I just hope that when we do the stakeholder input, and I know we'll hear from people today, that we do this in the context of the policy and what is this, what are we doing this for?

05:30:57.569 --> 05:31:03.911
Because I feel like, and I've had these conversations with the board staff, it shouldn't be about chasing numbers.

05:31:04.071 --> 05:31:08.452
It should be what is this doing to improve student learning in the classroom?

05:31:08.832 --> 05:31:10.572
I don't know what it's supposed to be doing.

05:31:11.152 --> 05:31:24.859
When you have that many schools, number one, and you're dividing, if it's really about, well, let's try to get additional resources, the amount of money that would be available to each school is budget dust, my favorite term.

05:31:25.919 --> 05:31:29.161
I don't know that it's enough to really make significant change.

05:31:29.221 --> 05:31:37.705
So again, I think we have to have these conversations in the context of what are we trying to do to help Title I students

05:31:38.425 --> 05:31:40.709
And, you know, I don't know the answer to that.

05:31:40.790 --> 05:31:45.639
And I feel like we get lost in the identification and trying to hit some number.

05:31:47.742 --> 05:31:57.810
To me that is the best comment I've heard about this whole conversation in that if there are 6,000 schools that need support, great.

05:31:58.010 --> 05:31:59.771
There are 6,000 schools that need support.

05:31:59.891 --> 05:32:11.641
But in the context of what can we actually do and to what extent and how successful will that be, that should guide us a little bit more as to how we

05:32:12.861 --> 05:32:25.650
pick and choose the indicators, not indicators, pick and choose the method to get at this group of schools as opposed to simply following an arbitrary sort of policy or plan.

05:32:26.991 --> 05:32:27.992
Board Member Valdez.

05:32:31.054 --> 05:32:40.801
I agree with Board Member Burr and I really think that if we're looking at improvement science and we are looking at starting small and doing it right and then scaling up, we really need to look at this.

05:32:42.216 --> 05:32:43.476
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

05:32:44.997 --> 05:32:51.079
Is it possible when you come back in March to also let us know how we identified that 2,911?

05:32:52.059 --> 05:32:53.040
What were the subgroups?

05:32:53.080 --> 05:32:54.140
What were the indicators?

05:32:54.200 --> 05:32:55.921
A little bit more information behind that.

05:32:56.381 --> 05:32:57.241
That would be great.

05:32:57.981 --> 05:32:59.362
The other thing is I know that

05:33:00.516 --> 05:33:06.180
You know, this will become the focus of any revisions or amendments to the SSA plan, the revised plan.

05:33:07.161 --> 05:33:30.136
One of the things that I want us to really consider in the context of the California way, because I know that that's the only way we will operate, is that there was a lot of discussion through stakeholders, through the feedback, through the reviewers, about how we plan to really hold ourselves accountable for growth and for meeting the state determined timeline.

05:33:31.037 --> 05:33:47.393
I don't believe that we addressed that in the revision of this state plan, but I do think that the LCAP, currently the template that we have that we adopted for the next two years, because now we're in the second year, looks at internal gaps, so subgroups red and orange to the LEA.

05:33:48.394 --> 05:33:54.518
But we're also assuming that that LEA is hitting the state target, and it may not, right?

05:33:54.558 --> 05:34:08.007
And so it's important for us to consider, at the very least, looking at our own LCAP template to say internal gaps, but also subgroups to LEA, LEA to state determined timeline, and we're looking at addressing the targets.

05:34:08.087 --> 05:34:10.308
How will we look at moving?

05:34:10.408 --> 05:34:14.571
You have seven years, but it is unfair to expect a parent

05:34:15.171 --> 05:34:23.634
to say, okay, well, they are significantly behind with Latino students, and I'm just going to trust that in seven years, they're going to get there.

05:34:24.454 --> 05:34:27.875
Without showing me as a parent, what is your growth?

05:34:27.935 --> 05:34:30.716
What is your target for year one, year two, year three?

05:34:31.056 --> 05:34:34.237
And if you're not making gains, how can we assist you?

05:34:34.437 --> 05:34:36.397
How can we support you?

05:34:36.918 --> 05:34:41.159
That has to be somewhere, and that has been my permanent talking point.

05:34:41.499 --> 05:34:44.620
We need to show how we're moving in that direction.

05:34:45.100 --> 05:34:49.844
You know, to say that you have seven years and vaya con Dios, you will figure it out.

05:34:50.424 --> 05:34:58.350
It's not responsible of us as stakeholders, as policymakers, to expect that we should just do it.

05:34:58.430 --> 05:35:01.793
And I know it's local control, but there's also parents in that system.

05:35:01.833 --> 05:35:02.994
There's students in that system.

05:35:03.434 --> 05:35:05.594
And that was brought up in this estate plan.

05:35:05.654 --> 05:35:09.275
It was echoed by many, many other independent and external reviewers.

05:35:09.615 --> 05:35:12.276
And I still feel that we are not addressing it.

05:35:12.576 --> 05:35:14.796
So let's address it at least through the California way.

05:35:15.176 --> 05:35:17.296
Let's use our LCAP template to look at that.

05:35:17.536 --> 05:35:19.397
Let's really consider that feedback.

05:35:19.437 --> 05:35:22.877
Let's listen to the feedback, not just say it's our way, no way.

05:35:22.917 --> 05:35:23.597
California is great.

05:35:23.938 --> 05:35:25.838
We are a great state.

05:35:26.418 --> 05:35:28.478
And when you look at other state plans, we are great.

05:35:29.038 --> 05:35:32.399
But we are still missing the mark and we need to own that as well.

05:35:35.856 --> 05:35:41.999
So just sticking on that point, we have the annual update in the, in the LCAP now.

05:35:42.299 --> 05:35:45.961
So I don't, pardon?

05:35:48.222 --> 05:35:55.046
But we have an annual update in the, in the, in that they, so there is an annual process.

05:35:55.126 --> 05:36:01.489
It's not like we're going away for seven years and we'll come back seven years later and, and look at where you are.

05:36:03.067 --> 05:36:07.509
if it's not included in the template, we could say here, encourage folks to do that.

05:36:07.829 --> 05:36:10.490
But if it's not in the template, they don't have to do it.

05:36:10.750 --> 05:36:14.631
If it's not in the design, is it the seven-year target?

05:36:15.492 --> 05:36:20.334
No, no, the annual update is in the LCAP template.

05:36:21.621 --> 05:36:27.985
Right, but what we're saying is we've identified what our seven year or state determined target is for each indicator.

05:36:28.745 --> 05:36:33.788
And we need to now see our LEAs making progress by subgroup to meet that.

05:36:34.238 --> 05:36:34.458
Okay.

05:36:36.139 --> 05:36:36.940
Where are we here?

05:36:37.100 --> 05:36:37.701
Who's next?

05:36:37.781 --> 05:36:39.242
It could be either one.

05:36:39.282 --> 05:36:40.042
Ting Sun.

05:36:40.302 --> 05:36:40.483
Okay.

05:36:41.243 --> 05:36:51.370
So I think the issue around growth, because if we are contingent improvement, we want some way to be able to measure that, either at the local level, state level, whatever.

05:36:51.431 --> 05:36:54.433
So I think that's going to be a multifaceted approach.

05:36:55.053 --> 05:36:58.716
Remember, our system isn't done yet, and we're still working on that.

05:36:59.636 --> 05:37:05.021
I think there are opportunities to maybe look at that when we hear more about the growth model.

05:37:05.281 --> 05:37:11.866
I think that's going to help with looking at perhaps setting some progress measures or targets and all that.

05:37:12.226 --> 05:37:19.812
I don't think that just a change in the template for the LCAP is necessarily going to get us to where we would like to be.

05:37:20.213 --> 05:37:28.179
So definitely, I don't feel it just because we have not thoroughly addressed that or feel like we've thoroughly addressed that in an ESSA plan.

05:37:28.619 --> 05:37:39.516
that it is not something that California is committed to continue to do and to refine the system so that we can ensure that there is continuous improvement and progress being made for students.

05:37:44.330 --> 05:37:45.150
Board member Valdez.

05:37:46.011 --> 05:38:04.831
To go along with what you were talking about President Kirst is that I think what's been missing for districts is that we haven't had that target that's now identified in the plan in terms of for all of the indicators and so as districts in their updates are putting their goals and and you know annual goals but long term in terms of here's where we want to go

05:38:05.351 --> 05:38:06.492
It was to go to where.

05:38:06.732 --> 05:38:08.112
And so now we have the where.

05:38:08.312 --> 05:38:09.393
And we have a timeline.

05:38:09.433 --> 05:38:13.995
And so we're 45 days, if you will, into after the dashboard has come out.

05:38:14.415 --> 05:38:16.716
So now districts are beginning to wrap their heads around.

05:38:17.056 --> 05:38:23.659
We now really have a clear target where before it was sort of we know we need to get better, but the improvement model didn't really have

05:38:24.299 --> 05:38:28.542
a real defined termination, if you will, destination.

05:38:28.623 --> 05:38:33.006
So I think that we're in a really good place to put the whole system into place.

05:38:33.586 --> 05:38:38.890
And so I agree with you that we now have that and it will be in the, it has to be in the dashboard.

05:38:39.451 --> 05:38:43.574
I'm not the dashboard, but the LCAP as part of the reporting part.

05:38:45.195 --> 05:38:48.357
Okay, perhaps we're ready for some public comment now.

05:38:49.678 --> 05:38:50.519
So call the list.

05:38:54.465 --> 05:38:55.886
Following people, please line up.

05:38:56.086 --> 05:39:09.951
Doug McRae, Michael Flores-Castaneda, Sheila Whitney, Ed Manzala, Colleen Pagter, Brian Rivas, Dean Drescher, Terry Burns, John Affelt, and Eric Premack.

05:39:10.271 --> 05:39:10.651
Thank you.

05:39:12.672 --> 05:39:13.412
Come forward, please.

05:39:17.912 --> 05:39:18.533
Good afternoon.

05:39:18.573 --> 05:39:21.834
I'm Doug McRae, retired testing specialist for Monterey.

05:39:22.555 --> 05:39:28.578
This is on the ESSA lowest 5% requirement we've just been discussing.

05:39:29.599 --> 05:39:38.764
I'd urge the board to maintain use of the status and change model, though ESSA appears to have a status only.

05:39:39.645 --> 05:39:55.822
The data to comply with ESSA status only model is present and if ED requires, Education Department U.S., requires status only data to be submitted, you can do that only to the feds.

05:39:56.243 --> 05:39:57.644
You don't have to publicize it here.

05:39:58.425 --> 05:40:11.389
However, the ESSA requirement for identifying schools is clear in their statute, and I don't think there's a compelling evidence that identifying districts is a better comprehensive assistance model.

05:40:12.709 --> 05:40:19.011
Finally, to credibly identify a lowest 5%, I think we need indicators for

05:40:20.992 --> 05:40:32.061
Indicators for strong and less strong indicators and potentially aggregate data by just counting numbers of reds or reds and oranges.

05:40:32.202 --> 05:40:36.966
I suggested that last September and I'd be happy to resurrect that and provide it again.

05:40:36.986 --> 05:40:38.407
Thank you.

05:40:44.173 --> 05:40:47.034
I'm Colleen Pachter on behalf of Los Angeles Unified School District.

05:40:47.894 --> 05:40:56.355
In response to the proposed approaches to identifying the lowest performing schools, LUSD believes that the state should identify schools regardless of LEA affiliation.

05:40:56.915 --> 05:41:01.356
We understand that the state is trying to focus support on LEAs and align the federal and state systems.

05:41:01.436 --> 05:41:10.918
However, doing so at the expense of certain LEAs and potentially misidentifying the lowest 5% of schools would hinder the state's effort to support schools of greatest need.

05:41:11.898 --> 05:41:20.767
If the state only identifies the lowest performing schools from LCFF support districts, then low performing schools outside of those LEAs would not have access to the same resources.

05:41:21.567 --> 05:41:26.332
In addition, identifying schools among certain LEAs would stretch those districts' capacity for support.

05:41:26.552 --> 05:41:34.500
This would put an undue strain on the resources of certain LEAs while leaving other LEAs without the same responsibilities, accountabilities, and financial obligations.

05:41:35.240 --> 05:41:36.302
Lastly, we agree with the U.S.

05:41:36.322 --> 05:41:47.194
Department of Education's concern that limiting identification to certain LEAs does not meet ESSA requirements, and therefore the state plan should be revised to clearly state the method of identification.

05:41:47.615 --> 05:41:47.895
Thank you.

05:41:52.912 --> 05:41:53.332
Good afternoon.

05:41:53.372 --> 05:41:55.693
Terry Burns, California School Boards Association.

05:41:56.754 --> 05:42:00.956
We are pleased to see in your revisions that you are holding the course.

05:42:02.096 --> 05:42:09.020
Many of the federal questions are in the process of being answered as the system evolves.

05:42:09.540 --> 05:42:11.401
We think that we are already on track

05:42:11.963 --> 05:42:13.403
to get many of those places.

05:42:14.164 --> 05:42:23.087
That direction evolved from a great deal of very, very broad stakeholder engagement, which we appreciated and participated in.

05:42:23.127 --> 05:42:26.228
I am glad that you are not doing a unilateral shift away from that.

05:42:27.248 --> 05:42:41.515
or our organization, like many, has suggestions and expectations for improvements in the system as it grows and builds out, and we encourage your continued stakeholder engagement in that process.

05:42:42.535 --> 05:42:59.954
While staying the course on a system that is focused on local engagement and decision-making, we encourage you to build the capacity of our LEAs to actually do this work, not just find districts that need help and need suggestions.

05:43:00.195 --> 05:43:00.495
Thank you.

05:43:04.025 --> 05:43:07.027
Good afternoon, Michael Flores Castaneda with the California Teachers Association.

05:43:07.707 --> 05:43:11.990
CTA believes the plan should be based on what California needs and wants for the students.

05:43:12.010 --> 05:43:20.856
It's essentially the same thing as my local district's LEA LCAP plan, which should be centered on our students' needs and aligned to the state board guidelines, not influenced by them.

05:43:21.757 --> 05:43:25.179
ESSA was designed to encourage local innovation through federal flexibility.

05:43:25.760 --> 05:43:33.224
Senator Lamar Alexander, ESSA's main architect, said the path to better schools is through decisions made by those closest to our children, not a distant department in DC.

05:43:34.205 --> 05:43:35.906
The system is already in place in California.

05:43:36.226 --> 05:43:39.708
In CTA, we often refer to the California way when discussing national topics.

05:43:40.468 --> 05:43:43.170
LCFF complements ESSA and goes much further.

05:43:43.730 --> 05:43:53.915
Our plan was developed to give the state maximum flexibility to meet ESSA's requirements and also allow the state to continue implementing our new accountability and support system.

05:43:54.455 --> 05:44:00.799
California is the biggest and most diverse state, which requires maximum flexibility to innovate and continually improve our work.

05:44:01.119 --> 05:44:01.339
Thank you.

05:44:06.468 --> 05:44:08.730
Sheila Whitley, speaking for CTA.

05:44:09.410 --> 05:44:15.814
CTA is disappointed that there was no opportunity to provide public comment on the revised ESSA plan.

05:44:16.354 --> 05:44:22.819
There has been opportunity all along the process to include stakeholders, and now with this revision there is basically

05:44:23.499 --> 05:44:26.620
no opportunity for the public to give input.

05:44:27.200 --> 05:44:32.922
We are especially concerned with the new methodologies being considered for identifying the lowest 5% of schools.

05:44:33.482 --> 05:44:51.168
We wanted to express our concern that expanding the criteria just to reach this arbitrary number of 5% seems counter to the philosophy in California for education and would then force schools to be included and labeled as bottom 5% that are actually making improvement.

05:44:51.648 --> 05:45:05.037
We would like you to consider keeping our current methodology that was previously adopted and provide some very specific support for schools who are making progress yet need some support in a few areas that they might be struggling with.

05:45:05.518 --> 05:45:05.838
Thank you.

05:45:10.814 --> 05:45:14.437
I'm Brian Revis on behalf of the Education Trust West.

05:45:15.898 --> 05:45:23.103
We're concerned about the conversation that suggests maybe California shouldn't do the identification of schools at all.

05:45:23.823 --> 05:45:25.364
I've been watching you long enough.

05:45:25.704 --> 05:45:29.227
I understand the concern about the state system driving the process.

05:45:29.947 --> 05:45:42.350
We think there's a path forward that allows the state to meet the requirement and actually builds on the strengths of what's federally required and the strengths of the LCFF system.

05:45:43.230 --> 05:45:47.431
Don't jettison the work on identification of schools.

05:45:47.511 --> 05:45:58.794
We're worried that if you only look at districts, you're gonna overlook some pretty poor schools, and we don't want districts to be able to hide a bad school in the system.

05:45:59.734 --> 05:46:04.519
We agree with Member Ortiz-Licon on the comments regarding interim progress.

05:46:05.140 --> 05:46:12.967
If you leave that work to LEAs to monitor gap closing in their LCAPs, it really departs from the experience we're seeing on the front line.

05:46:14.429 --> 05:46:20.014
We need some big changes to the templates so people know clearly that they're supposed to be undertaking that monitoring.

05:46:24.175 --> 05:46:26.275
Good afternoon, members of the board and President Kirst.

05:46:26.635 --> 05:46:29.016
My name is Dean Drescher, and I'm here representing EdVoice.

05:46:29.516 --> 05:46:31.336
I'm also a former first grade teacher.

05:46:32.437 --> 05:46:42.099
Section 1111 of ESSA was very clear, signed by President Obama, requiring that every state provide, in its plan, academic achievement measures for high school.

05:46:42.739 --> 05:46:48.820
California's plan has ignored this requirement, and the recent feedback to that effect from the United States Department of Education.

05:46:49.620 --> 05:46:51.702
On top of this, an audit recently from the U.S.

05:46:51.722 --> 05:46:57.386
Department of Education found that CDE failed to appropriately monitor local agencies' graduation data.

05:46:58.107 --> 05:47:13.719
This gives us all the more reason to respectfully and with urgency encourage the board to take seriously the notion of accountability for students in high school and to start using 11th grade Smarter Balanced assessments that we already have for this very purpose.

05:47:14.040 --> 05:47:14.320
Thank you.

05:47:18.240 --> 05:47:18.720
Good afternoon.

05:47:18.740 --> 05:47:20.101
Samantha Tran with Children Now.

05:47:21.401 --> 05:47:27.923
Clearly identifying whether gaps in achievement are closing or not is good policy and is well aligned with federal law.

05:47:28.643 --> 05:47:33.785
There are a number of issues in the state plan that we'd like to see revised, but I want to focus on this one because it's so critical.

05:47:34.585 --> 05:47:47.890
Ideally, and Children Now has mentioned this in the past, we'd love to see that gap closure by student subgroup included in the dashboard because we think it's the most transparent way to get it out to the public and to meet these federal requirements.

05:47:48.330 --> 05:47:53.212
We've heard from the materials that you're contemplating including this in the LCAP.

05:47:53.592 --> 05:48:03.056
We think that might be a little unwieldy given the size of these plans and the fact that there are hundreds of pages and already focused on kind of broad goals.

05:48:03.536 --> 05:48:08.861
That said, if the board does decide to move in this direction, we do think that updates to the instructions are critical.

05:48:09.241 --> 05:48:15.928
If you go back and you look at the template, there's language in there that says subgroup metrics may be included, so it's permissive.

05:48:15.948 --> 05:48:18.110
There are three-year plans, which is not

05:48:18.610 --> 05:48:21.533
in a well-aligned with a seven-year timeline, so we just need to figure that out.

05:48:22.033 --> 05:48:28.559
Even when there's note of achievement gap issues, it talks about being two colors below the average student.

05:48:28.880 --> 05:48:31.902
Again, that's not well-aligned with the state or the federal law.

05:48:32.203 --> 05:48:39.469
And we think it's important that counties clearly articulate that they're going to be reviewing the plans for this type of data and the actions and services associated with it.

05:48:39.690 --> 05:48:40.110
Thanks so much.

05:48:47.602 --> 05:48:51.664
Good afternoon, John Affeldt from Public Advocates and the Equity Coalition.

05:48:53.906 --> 05:49:11.818
I want to, for Public Advocates' sake, we want to be clear that we're in agreement with the notion that the state LCFF system should be driving the boat here and the federal system should be supporting it.

05:49:13.219 --> 05:49:14.300
That said, we appreciate

05:49:15.026 --> 05:49:22.531
I remember Ortiz-Lacon comments and Valdez's comments that we ought to amend the LCAP

05:49:23.294 --> 05:49:36.144
to put in there the long-term goals around the seven-year time frame and have the local districts explain how they're going to meet those goals.

05:49:38.045 --> 05:49:40.307
We think that a minimum transparency requires that.

05:49:40.807 --> 05:49:48.473
That's not becoming the federal system that you can still have and will have many other goals.

05:49:49.574 --> 05:49:55.517
in in the plan, but we think that that's a minimum kind of alignment that's called for here.

05:49:55.557 --> 05:49:55.797
Thanks.

05:49:58.618 --> 05:50:00.359
That concludes the public comment.

05:50:00.499 --> 05:50:04.281
So are we ready for a motion at this point or not?

05:50:11.905 --> 05:50:12.385
I'm looking.

05:50:12.405 --> 05:50:12.445
No.

05:50:21.158 --> 05:50:24.400
Well, that could be included in a motion if we had a motion.

05:50:25.741 --> 05:50:25.961
All right.

05:50:25.981 --> 05:50:26.742
I can make an attempt.

05:50:26.822 --> 05:50:27.762
Yeah, make an attempt.

05:50:27.782 --> 05:50:28.843
So I will make an attempt.

05:50:29.223 --> 05:50:29.504
All right.

05:50:29.544 --> 05:50:38.490
So I move that the department's recommendation to approve the revisions to the ESSA plan with the following revision.

05:50:38.510 --> 05:50:41.912
I believe this is attachment 2, page 64-65.

05:50:45.620 --> 05:50:47.341
and attachment three, page 62.

05:50:49.423 --> 05:51:11.598
So we currently have language about identifying with the different colors and replacing that paragraph, those two paragraphs with the state board will consider a proposed plan supplement at its March 2018 meeting for submission to the Federal Department of Education that further describes the approach for identifying the lowest performing Title I schools.

05:51:12.258 --> 05:51:14.019
So if we have just a very broad

05:51:15.120 --> 05:51:20.946
we're going to look at in March 2018 for that methodology.

05:51:21.006 --> 05:51:25.030
So it takes away the attempt to try to find the different codular combinations.

05:51:27.867 --> 05:51:29.588
Okay, is there a second?

05:51:30.568 --> 05:51:33.149
Okay, Board Member Rucker seconds the motion.

05:51:33.550 --> 05:51:48.636
Can I just maybe restate to clarify just so everyone has the same understanding that the motion that was just framed would essentially strike the last two paragraphs of what is section little v. i. a. on the pages 64 to 65 of attachment 3.

05:51:48.676 --> 05:51:49.237
Is it 62 of it?

05:51:49.257 --> 05:51:49.357
Sorry.

05:51:52.878 --> 05:52:01.323
64 to 65 of Attachment 2, 62 of Attachment 3, and replace it with the language that Board Member Sun just read.

05:52:01.563 --> 05:52:06.366
So striking the last two paragraphs of that section, substituting the replacement language.

05:52:06.386 --> 05:52:10.568
Okay, Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:52:11.149 --> 05:52:15.911
It would replace, but also it's a motion to approve the revised SSA plan.

05:52:16.051 --> 05:52:16.291
Yes.

05:52:18.613 --> 05:52:20.554
Okay, any further board discussion on this item?

05:52:22.139 --> 05:52:25.561
If not, all those in favor, raise your hands.

05:52:26.742 --> 05:52:27.282
Opposed?

05:52:28.543 --> 05:52:30.404
OK, carries 10 to 1.

05:52:31.664 --> 05:52:33.225
OK, well, let's take a break.

05:52:34.666 --> 05:52:34.926
Pardon?

05:52:35.066 --> 05:52:35.506
Oh, go ahead.

05:52:35.527 --> 05:52:41.690
Before we take a break, just saying, appreciate all the public input, appreciate the board's keen focus and debate.

05:52:41.850 --> 05:52:45.612
And we'll work as we work as part of additional public input

05:52:47.593 --> 05:52:51.195
vetting the draft that and the work we've done today.

05:52:51.536 --> 05:53:01.782
We'll work very closely with Carrick and his unit and our department work very closely with the State Board staff to address feedback to the public comments as well as your particular comments.

05:53:02.142 --> 05:53:02.422
Thank you.

05:53:04.183 --> 05:53:07.245
Okay, let's come back at 20 of 3.

05:53:12.849 --> 05:53:14.870
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

05:53:16.280 --> 05:53:17.881
And we're ready for item six.

05:53:18.241 --> 05:53:21.383
And this will be in three parts.

05:53:22.203 --> 05:53:24.404
Carrick will first present some things.

05:53:24.604 --> 05:53:30.907
It's an update on the CAS program, our student assessment.

05:53:30.927 --> 05:53:34.929
And Carrick will present something on the smarter balanced assessment to open it up.

05:53:35.589 --> 05:53:38.871
Then we'll also be dealing with the science assessment.

05:53:39.611 --> 05:53:47.264
and the apportionments to local educational agencies for their implementation of our state assessment system called CASP.

05:53:47.745 --> 05:53:49.588
So Carrick will begin and we'll start.

05:53:51.547 --> 05:53:57.131
Thank you so much, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

05:53:58.552 --> 05:54:02.135
I'm presenting the last two items for the day are both assessment items.

05:54:03.276 --> 05:54:08.720
Michelle Center, who is our director for our assessment division, is not available.

05:54:10.121 --> 05:54:11.782
And so you get me.

05:54:13.442 --> 05:54:25.447
But I have brought staff with me, our Assistant Director of the Assessment Division, Mal Vang will be coming up in a minute to present the bulk of this item.

05:54:27.088 --> 05:54:38.332
As you know, CASP covers multiple assessments, Smarter Balance, English Language Arts and Math, of which is the greatest of that contract.

05:54:39.473 --> 05:54:49.033
But it also is made up of science as part of CASP, the upcoming Spanish test is part of CASP, and our alternate assessments are part of CASP.

05:54:50.498 --> 05:54:55.942
So just leading up to this item, I asked if I could do a little introduction to this item.

05:54:56.223 --> 05:55:01.046
You did receive a handout during the break, so you might have to look for it in your basket.

05:55:01.387 --> 05:55:09.373
It will say in large, pretty large letters, item six in the upper right-hand corner and in the left-hand corner is the Smarter Balanced logo.

05:55:11.590 --> 05:55:32.318
So as you recall, in November I was before you and I gave you an oral update at that time about what Smarter Balanced was doing in result of a news article that brought into question the flatness of the Smarter Balanced scores in English language arts and math in multiple Smarter Balanced states.

05:55:32.938 --> 05:55:41.904
So at that time, I talked to you about what the Executive Committee was doing about it, and I am a member of the Executive Committee as well as other states.

05:55:42.444 --> 05:55:45.946
Just as a reminder, Smarter Balance is us, is the states.

05:55:46.907 --> 05:56:01.796
Unlike most test vendors who are basically just under contract and they have their employees, Smarter Balance states actually as part of the Executive Committee and the governing body of those states vote on many things.

05:56:02.156 --> 05:56:12.203
Our California teachers are very involved in the development of test items and the testing of those items and in the scoring of those items as part of the interim assessments.

05:56:12.683 --> 05:56:18.227
So we have quite a bit of say into the consortium and the assessment itself.

05:56:18.747 --> 05:56:31.816
So, the Executive Committee very involved multiple conversations about the flatness of the test scores and what it meant and what it didn't mean and what would Smarter Balanced do in result of this.

05:56:32.296 --> 05:56:42.824
So, at that time in November, I gave you an update about an AIR report that was done, a special report that they did in which they looked at the test item bank from 2016, they looked at it

05:56:43.925 --> 05:56:52.136
compared it to 2017 because one of the speculations of that article was that there was something wrong with the test bank, that there was a difference in the test items.

05:56:52.617 --> 05:56:57.002
AAR determined AAR is not part of our test administration here in California.

05:56:59.005 --> 05:57:15.592
So as an outside independent looking at this, they said no, there's no difference, at least no significant difference in the test items from one year to the next, and no reason to believe that anything in the test caused a deflation of the scores.

05:57:16.052 --> 05:57:18.253
But that wasn't all that Smarter Balanced was going to do.

05:57:18.293 --> 05:57:21.595
That was just one part of that special report that was done by AAR.

05:57:22.635 --> 05:57:34.121
Smarter Balance also agreed under the guidance of their Technical Advisory Committee to do an additional, an extension of that AIR report and to do more than just their technical review that they do annually.

05:57:34.181 --> 05:57:47.167
They do an annual technical review and they provide a written report back to the states of the test administration for each year and any technical issues that come up as part of the administration of that assessment.

05:57:47.487 --> 05:57:50.869
So they are doing that technical report, but in addition,

05:57:51.309 --> 05:58:12.493
again, under the guidance of our Technical Advisory Committee, answering some specific questions about this last year's administration to see if, in fact, there is anything that we should be concerned about in not only the test item bank but in the delivery of the assessment or in the way the algorithm works for the computer-adaptive portion of the test.

05:58:12.853 --> 05:58:16.233
So all of that is being done by Smarter Balanced.

05:58:16.273 --> 05:58:19.814
They are scheduled to give us a report in early

05:58:20.595 --> 05:58:29.125
an early March, a preliminary report, with the final full technical report being available to us, I believe, in July.

05:58:30.286 --> 05:58:32.629
I want to say one thing about the Technical Advisory Committee.

05:58:32.649 --> 05:58:35.152
You can go on the Smarter Balanced website and see who they are.

05:58:35.472 --> 05:58:37.014
They are an amazing group of 17 Ph.D.s

05:58:40.367 --> 05:58:44.828
expert psychometricians that come out of testing companies and researchers.

05:58:45.048 --> 05:58:54.071
They're not employees of Smarter Balanced, so they have no specific conflict here of wanting to overlook any issues.

05:58:54.151 --> 05:59:03.033
In fact, being on the board, they want to make sure that that test is as good as we want it to be because their name is connected with it as being part of the Technical Advisory Committee.

05:59:03.394 --> 05:59:07.655
These are experts from all over the state, and so they're a highly

05:59:09.685 --> 05:59:14.048
knowledgeable group as well as well known in the assessment arena.

05:59:14.809 --> 05:59:19.912
So I gave you that oral update in November and I've just given it to you again and now you have it in writing.

05:59:20.032 --> 05:59:30.279
So Smarter Balanced did provide to us a written notification through this memo, not just to California, but to all of their Smarter Balanced states in response to looking at those test items.

05:59:30.699 --> 05:59:38.685
So when that report becomes available, we'll of course bring it to you as a board and if there are any specific issues, we'll address those at that time.

05:59:41.191 --> 05:59:44.520
So now it is my pleasure, unless you have questions on that.

05:59:45.131 --> 05:59:47.433
Yeah, I think we do have some questions on that, yeah.

05:59:48.193 --> 05:59:49.714
Board member Schwartz.

05:59:49.834 --> 05:59:53.957
So, Erica, I really appreciate you bringing this up.

05:59:54.057 --> 06:00:05.025
I think as people get into looking at the test scores and seeing the flatness in some areas and the concern of not seeing growth, I think a lot of people have their own interpretation.

06:00:05.045 --> 06:00:09.228
I think some of us think we need to actually align our teaching.

06:00:09.748 --> 06:00:21.275
to the standards we've adopted and that the frameworks guide, and that if students were getting consistent instruction on the standards that we assess, we might really begin to see growth.

06:00:21.435 --> 06:00:26.358
But I think there are other people who say, well, I think there's a problem with the tests, and I think the AIR was

06:00:27.918 --> 06:00:45.024
an effort to address that issue but it seems like from the field and from some key leaders we're feeling like we need some more independent validation to the field that this is as solid and as reliable as it can be and that we're addressing any

06:00:47.625 --> 06:00:49.487
any changes or issues that we need to.

06:00:49.707 --> 06:00:52.209
And I think we're doing it differently.

06:00:52.249 --> 06:00:55.112
It's a different kind of test than kids have been exposed to or teachers.

06:00:55.632 --> 06:01:05.561
And I just think I represent many people who feel like we do need a broader independent analysis to validate the system that we're using.

06:01:06.181 --> 06:01:07.202
Could you respond to that?

06:01:07.242 --> 06:01:07.903
I appreciate that.

06:01:09.624 --> 06:01:15.310
You have my commitment that I will bring that to the Executive Committee and to Smarter Balanced as a recommendation.

06:01:16.952 --> 06:01:20.075
I will say I think one of your points is exactly right.

06:01:21.076 --> 06:01:27.181
We knew going in that these are higher standards, they are harder standards, which means the test is harder.

06:01:28.242 --> 06:01:38.604
And so it shouldn't have come as a surprise to us, but I think there was so much growth experience between the first two years that the flatness kind of took us off guard.

06:01:40.144 --> 06:01:56.267
This is not an assessment like the old CST or the STAR assessment where you could do some test prep, which of course we told people not to do, and then experience a couple of points of gains.

06:01:57.768 --> 06:02:03.793
And I think we've gotten so used to kind of that mindset that people haven't fully made the shift.

06:02:04.173 --> 06:02:11.078
These are harder standards to teach and harder to learn and harder assessment to go along with it.

06:02:11.118 --> 06:02:12.920
And we shouldn't shy away from that challenge.

06:02:12.980 --> 06:02:16.563
We should embrace it and see what we can do to actually change our instruction.

06:02:17.063 --> 06:02:19.565
not just for the end-of-the-year assessments.

06:02:20.005 --> 06:02:34.794
We bought into a system that provides us the digital library and the interim assessments to help teachers keep track along the way of how kids are doing because that's where growth is going to come, not just assessments at the end of the year, not just a summative.

06:02:35.094 --> 06:02:38.056
Yes, that's part of the system because that's a requirement of the system.

06:02:39.056 --> 06:02:45.000
But we bought into a system, and we need to embrace that system and make it truly a part of instruction.

06:02:45.461 --> 06:02:50.204
One of the things that we are trying to do when I say we, it sounds like I'm taking credit.

06:02:50.504 --> 06:02:59.550
Our assessment division is working with our contractor, ETS, and is using people like WestEd and Sacramento County Office and some others.

06:03:00.110 --> 06:03:17.908
to put together professional development experiences, especially we've got these CASP institutes that you may have heard about, and we also have some trainings being done in science, because if you think English language arts and math are different, the science standards are right along there with them.

06:03:19.469 --> 06:03:37.115
And so we're putting together some academies, and maybe more, putting together some academies or institutes so that people realize how to go about teaching these new standards and how to use ongoing formative assessment as well as interim assessments.

06:03:37.555 --> 06:03:39.636
to measure progress along the way.

06:03:40.537 --> 06:03:44.520
For those that didn't know, our test administration for this year has opened.

06:03:45.720 --> 06:03:46.981
It opened, I think, last week.

06:03:47.402 --> 06:03:51.664
I don't know how many are testing this early in the season, but it is open and it's possible.

06:03:52.185 --> 06:03:58.329
I do want to say, because we talked about it a lot previously, and that was our interim assessment changes that we made over last year,

06:03:59.270 --> 06:04:08.398
I think we provided to you a report and a demo about the reporting system back to teachers that makes the information much more usable and user-friendly.

06:04:08.418 --> 06:04:10.460
It ties it to standards.

06:04:10.500 --> 06:04:18.307
There was a Patrick O'Donnell bill from last year, and the smarter balance adjustments that were made meet all those requirements from that bill.

06:04:19.088 --> 06:04:31.995
And the reporting system, well, I can report to you that before Thanksgiving, we'd already had a million interim assessments given.

06:04:32.835 --> 06:04:36.377
So last year, we had seven million total for the year.

06:04:36.958 --> 06:04:45.082
So people are using the system, and even using it, if they stay on this track, it will be more than what was used previously, which is a very good sign.

06:04:47.145 --> 06:04:49.207
So anything more before we move on to?

06:04:49.427 --> 06:04:58.436
Yeah, no, I wanted to get your thoughts on an independent analysis and how you would define independent.

06:04:59.717 --> 06:05:01.939
Well, yeah, that's a good question.

06:05:01.979 --> 06:05:05.222
I'm not sure I'm the best one to answer it, but I'm going to give you my best answer.

06:05:05.242 --> 06:05:06.884
So as you know,

06:05:09.386 --> 06:05:14.035
Like in the curriculum world, in the assessment world, a lot of people know each other, right?

06:05:14.295 --> 06:05:19.766
So a lot of these companies contract with each other across the country.

06:05:20.336 --> 06:05:26.481
A lot of states, a lot of different contracts, different vendors, but these vendors do subcontract with each other.

06:05:26.961 --> 06:05:40.151
So when I have that discussion with Smarter Balanced and the Executive Committee, we are going to have to talk about what it means to be independent, and especially if Smarter Balanced then pays for the assessment.

06:05:40.771 --> 06:05:45.614
There are some critics that will say, well, of course they got a good assessment, a good evaluation, because they paid for it.

06:05:46.034 --> 06:05:51.797
So we're going to have to struggle and come up with a solution of what it means to be independent.

06:05:52.037 --> 06:06:02.903
But it does need to be somebody who has a thorough understanding of psychometric principles, as well as these new standards and these new assessments.

06:06:03.163 --> 06:06:04.244
Not the same as CST.

06:06:05.384 --> 06:06:20.331
So, it's got to be somebody who is recent and current in these issues of computer-based assessment and a computer-adaptive assessment environment, and to understand what the test item banks look like and how they look different from previous assessments.

06:06:21.052 --> 06:06:26.054
So, I don't have an exact answer for you, but I know what the issues are that we need to talk about and come up with a solution.

06:06:26.400 --> 06:06:28.081
Yes, I think those are good issues.

06:06:28.282 --> 06:06:40.632
As you pointed out, we have many subcontracts with people that would be qualified to do an analysis of what is going on, so we have to be careful on that.

06:06:40.672 --> 06:06:48.519
Like I said, we have 17 Ph.D.s, some of the most expert psychometricians on the Technical Advisory Committee.

06:06:49.600 --> 06:06:54.304
Many of them would be perfect for this, though I don't know if that would be viewed as independent.

06:06:54.364 --> 06:07:01.331
Yeah, so you have some of the best people in the state that are, you know, not, not quote independent under some definitions.

06:07:01.811 --> 06:07:06.376
Board member, oh, board member Ruckers first.

06:07:07.608 --> 06:07:13.911
Well, this is something I have been saying from the time that we started implementing this assessment system.

06:07:15.171 --> 06:07:24.716
In adopting and implementing the Common Core, there was a call and a needed requirement to have and understand this instructional shift.

06:07:25.316 --> 06:07:35.041
What has not happened with the adoption and implementation of our new assessment system in CAST is there really has not been an assessment shift.

06:07:35.921 --> 06:07:46.806
People are very focused across the state on the end-of-year assessment, but practices in most districts concerning this assessment shift has not occurred.

06:07:47.246 --> 06:07:50.128
So, part of the, some of the

06:07:50.908 --> 06:07:58.374
Contributory factors to these flat scores is that there has not been this philosophical assessment shift.

06:07:59.255 --> 06:08:14.107
AB 1035 by Assemblymember O'Donnell is an attempt to try to guide LEAs in practices to create those local norms to implement an assessment shift concerning the use of the interim assessments.

06:08:14.447 --> 06:08:18.451
So while the data is good that shows we have a million interim assessments,

06:08:19.131 --> 06:08:20.472
How were they used?

06:08:20.872 --> 06:08:27.955
What was the role of stakeholders in having discussions about the use and implementation of those interim assessments?

06:08:28.336 --> 06:08:29.896
What do teachers do with them?

06:08:30.377 --> 06:08:42.983
And how do students interact with and participate in using and understanding what the interim assessments teach them about not just assessment, but understanding the standards themselves?

06:08:43.483 --> 06:08:49.867
Those are the things that are not truly being discussed, and that was part of the reason why AB 1035 became important.

06:08:50.407 --> 06:08:54.049
And let's not forget the campaign we had about the digital library.

06:08:54.389 --> 06:09:04.695
At one point in time, we had a list longer than your legs, because you're taller than me, of districts that hadn't even bothered to enroll their teachers in the digital library.

06:09:05.015 --> 06:09:09.958
When the digital library started, there were about 300 entries of instructional support materials.

06:09:10.378 --> 06:09:19.743
Now there are thousands of entries, but those develop more in isolation, not because of feedback in the learning community that there was an assumption

06:09:20.143 --> 06:09:22.344
the digital library would be built from.

06:09:22.945 --> 06:09:37.712
We still have a lot of work to do, first of all, to make sure that the entire assessment system that was implemented is being used fully and well accessed by teachers, that folks understand what the digital library is for,

06:09:38.132 --> 06:09:49.462
how it grows and how it contributes to and supports their professional learning, and what are the purposes of the interim assessments in creating these assessment shifts in their districts.

06:09:49.482 --> 06:10:00.832
If we are only fully implementing or implementing really well one part of the assessment system, that is a contributory factor behind why we are seeing some of this plateauing in the test scores.

06:10:01.112 --> 06:10:06.343
The test scores are not going to go up by themselves just because we keep testing.

06:10:06.383 --> 06:10:10.833
It goes back to something I have always said, weighing the pig doesn't make it any fatter.

06:10:13.157 --> 06:10:17.020
Don't look at me when you say that.

06:10:18.061 --> 06:10:26.326
So I appreciate you bringing up the example of the digital library because that's a perfect example of Smarter Balance being run by the states.

06:10:26.747 --> 06:10:31.210
We took that to Smarter Balance and said, we have districts not signing up teachers.

06:10:31.650 --> 06:10:36.474
Now maybe they're overworked, whatever the reason, they're not being signed up.

06:10:36.914 --> 06:10:37.995
So Smarter Balance said,

06:10:38.675 --> 06:10:42.899
Well, at your permission, we'll cut out the middleman and let teachers sign up themselves.

06:10:43.299 --> 06:10:43.719
And they did.

06:10:44.100 --> 06:10:49.284
So that's the kind of responsiveness we get when we're part of a system in which we have a say.

06:10:52.627 --> 06:10:57.732
Just commenting on that, isn't HMRU doing some of those kinds of studies?

06:10:58.502 --> 06:11:06.129
We're really talking about an independent analysis of the test score, summative trends.

06:11:06.409 --> 06:11:09.672
We have a big implementation contract out there by HOMRU.

06:11:10.112 --> 06:11:15.597
In fact, everyone on my list is an independent analyst of it, but they are contracted to us.

06:11:15.677 --> 06:11:23.644
So, can you explain there what we've done and what we've already committed to do through them?

06:11:24.524 --> 06:11:25.805
I really wish Michelle Sonner were here.

06:11:28.826 --> 06:11:32.247
But I'm going to do my best, and Mal can correct me if I don't get it quite right.

06:11:32.647 --> 06:11:34.347
So we do have an independent evaluator.

06:11:34.387 --> 06:11:36.928
You approved that contract, and it is HMRO.

06:11:38.369 --> 06:11:39.829
They can look at things.

06:11:40.429 --> 06:11:45.331
I jotted that note about use of interims to see if that can be part of that evaluation.

06:11:46.051 --> 06:11:48.732
They do an evaluation of the test administration themselves.

06:11:48.752 --> 06:11:51.293
So it's really more about ETS

06:11:51.673 --> 06:11:55.235
and their delivery of the system than about the test itself.

06:11:55.555 --> 06:12:05.561
So what we're looking for in this discussion is something to look at the test itself, not so much the delivery and how it's being used and how often and that sort of thing.

06:12:05.661 --> 06:12:08.703
So that's sort of the distinction of what HMRO does.

06:12:10.044 --> 06:12:11.304
Could HMRO do the other one?

06:12:12.745 --> 06:12:14.046
Well, would they be independent?

06:12:14.086 --> 06:12:14.906
That's the question.

06:12:14.926 --> 06:12:15.967
You're taking our money.

06:12:16.027 --> 06:12:17.028
Can you be independent?

06:12:17.048 --> 06:12:17.588
That's the question.

06:12:18.308 --> 06:12:19.089
Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:12:20.310 --> 06:12:37.726
Yeah, I do want to echo the concern and the push to really have an independent reviewer because I know that there is this false narrative out there that there is something flawed with the assessment and therefore let's not pay too much attention to what the data dashboard is telling us about student performance.

06:12:38.426 --> 06:12:56.944
And so once that becomes a narrative, then there is also less of an incentive to really try to align practice and PD to make sure that teachers are prepped to teach to the standards and then hopefully that would then lead to outcomes or improve outcomes in the assessment.

06:12:57.344 --> 06:13:01.388
And this is, I used to teach first grade a million years ago and this is so different.

06:13:01.728 --> 06:13:03.210
Thank God I'm married to a school teacher.

06:13:03.750 --> 06:13:09.813
That is able to help my kids with homework because I look at some of this and I'm like, and then it's Spanish, right?

06:13:09.853 --> 06:13:12.935
So we have to do the dual language plus common core.

06:13:13.175 --> 06:13:14.316
It's a different ballgame.

06:13:14.516 --> 06:13:17.878
It's, we're all, and they're learning too, right?

06:13:18.498 --> 06:13:22.240
And I think he's lucky that he's in a district that they really are emphasizing the training.

06:13:22.680 --> 06:13:26.622
But again, we really need to make sure that we dispel the false narrative.

06:13:26.802 --> 06:13:46.250
If there is nothing wrong with the assessment itself and we're having flat outcomes because it is harder and the standards are more rigorous, then that also needs to be very publicly known so that people are not looking at our data dashboard and saying, doesn't really matter because there's something flawed with the assessment.

06:13:47.751 --> 06:13:48.352
Thank you for that.

06:13:49.054 --> 06:13:50.798
So let me be real clear on this, though.

06:13:51.881 --> 06:13:54.086
There's nothing wrong with raising the question.

06:13:54.912 --> 06:13:55.092
Right?

06:13:55.492 --> 06:13:57.013
Nothing wrong with raising the question.

06:13:57.534 --> 06:14:04.138
The only thing wrong is drawing conclusions without doing a technical review and finding out what the conclusions ought to, are.

06:14:04.718 --> 06:14:04.898
Right?

06:14:05.178 --> 06:14:08.640
So that's what we're trying to answer.

06:14:09.381 --> 06:14:11.482
And that's what Smarter Balanced is willing to do.

06:14:11.642 --> 06:14:13.023
They're not hiding from this issue.

06:14:13.403 --> 06:14:19.647
They've been looking at it since it was first raised, and they will continue until we have an answer.

06:14:21.502 --> 06:14:23.644
OK, other questions on this?

06:14:23.664 --> 06:14:26.286
All right, I think we can move on to science.

06:14:26.346 --> 06:14:34.572
Yeah, so it's my pleasure to introduce to you our assistant division director for our assessment division, Mao Vang.

06:14:35.133 --> 06:14:39.877
Mao came to us out of a school district probably less than a year ago?

06:14:39.897 --> 06:14:40.517
Yes.

06:14:41.398 --> 06:14:42.599
Less than a year ago, Mao Vang.

06:14:49.161 --> 06:14:49.521
Thank you.

06:14:50.442 --> 06:14:59.570
Superintendent Torlakson, President Kirst and board members, as Carrick mentioned, I'm Mao Vang, Administrator for the Assessment Development and Administration Division.

06:15:01.772 --> 06:15:10.280
As Carrick mentioned also earlier, I'm presenting on behalf of Michelle Senter, who cannot be here today, who is the Director for our division.

06:15:11.397 --> 06:15:13.839
This item requires action from the board.

06:15:14.479 --> 06:15:23.607
The CDE asked the board to approve the following draft California alternate assessment for science related test development documents.

06:15:24.247 --> 06:15:30.192
The blueprint, the general achievement level descriptors, and the score reporting structure.

06:15:31.345 --> 06:15:37.392
Your approval will authorize the CDE to make technical edits as necessary to these documents.

06:15:38.373 --> 06:15:44.420
Furthermore, the CDE asks that the board approve the projected apportionment amounts for the 2017-18 CASP test administration.

06:15:48.115 --> 06:15:54.562
I will begin with an overview of the CAA or the California Alternate Assessment for Science documents.

06:15:55.143 --> 06:16:05.273
If you have any technical questions during my presentation, I may ask or invite representatives from Educational Testing Service to come up and help address those questions.

06:16:06.674 --> 06:16:16.618
As a reminder, the California Alternate Assessment for Science is designed for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

06:16:17.519 --> 06:16:30.704
As you know, the SBE did approve the California Alternate Assessment for Science high-level test design in July of 2016, which outlined the embedded performance task model of assessment.

06:16:32.116 --> 06:16:47.127
The embedded performance task model allows teachers to test their students on specific content shortly after they've provided or completed instruction on that content with the student, no matter when during the school year or in what order.

06:16:48.248 --> 06:17:01.947
The California Alternate Assessment for Science will measure student achievement on the California Next Generation Science Standards, similar to the CAST or the California Science Test that was brought to you in November.

06:17:03.570 --> 06:17:19.050
But these are specifically designed or developed core content connectors, or simply called connectors, that act as a bridge to the California Next Generation Science Standards.

06:17:20.312 --> 06:17:34.926
So these science connectors were developed in a multi-year collaborative effort with California educators, educational testing services, test developers, and EdCount.

06:17:35.767 --> 06:17:40.372
They are designed to be developmentally appropriate for the tested population.

06:17:42.153 --> 06:17:46.077
So I'm bringing up this blue, I'm gonna address the blueprint first.

06:17:46.598 --> 06:17:59.913
This blueprint document provides the specifications for how test forms will be developed for the new California Alternate Assessment for Science in grades five, eight, and high school.

06:18:00.533 --> 06:18:13.295
Specifically, the blueprint documents the connectors to be assessed, the number of items, test items, as well as the level of complexity by a next-generation science standard domain.

06:18:15.296 --> 06:18:22.157
The blueprint supports the California Alternate Assessment for Science measuring one overall claim.

06:18:22.417 --> 06:18:28.358
And I have the blueprint here, so I'm just gonna take a moment here, if I could go down to the claim.

06:18:31.414 --> 06:18:34.240
To have this in front of you, I'm not sure why it has the highlights.

06:18:36.823 --> 06:18:38.803
Okay, well I'll just address that.

06:18:39.724 --> 06:18:44.005
So I will read the claim out loud for you.

06:18:44.945 --> 06:19:05.610
Students can demonstrate performance associated with the expectations described by the core content connectors linked to the California Next Generation Science Standards across the domains of earth and space sciences, life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering technology and application of science, end quote.

06:19:06.852 --> 06:19:11.354
A subset of those connectors were identified for assessment purposes.

06:19:12.034 --> 06:19:19.777
This strikes a balance between maximizing the coverage of the science standards and minimizing that testing burden on students and educators.

06:19:20.658 --> 06:19:32.883
The test design rotates through all assessed connectors over a five-year period, further reducing that burden on any one student while covering more standards overall.

06:19:33.948 --> 06:19:37.410
A student is assessed on six connectors per year.

06:19:46.596 --> 06:19:56.362
There are 72 connectors total that are included in this blueprint, and each one is covered at least once over this five-year period.

06:19:56.382 --> 06:20:02.266
There are 20 connectors for grade five, 24 for grade eight, and 28 for high school.

06:20:05.559 --> 06:20:11.604
The embedded performance tasks will each focus on two connectors from one science domain.

06:20:12.265 --> 06:20:19.171
So by taking three embedded performance tasks, a student will cover this annual blueprint on this table.

06:20:22.674 --> 06:20:27.319
The connectors, again, that are listed in the appendix.

06:20:28.590 --> 06:20:41.235
So through this period, CDE and ETS worked closely with California stakeholders and with experts in the field of science, as well as an alternate assessment in developing this blueprint.

06:20:41.995 --> 06:20:50.839
So this blueprint and the plans for implementation have been revised and refined based on the input of the following groups and individuals.

06:20:51.759 --> 06:21:04.265
We did meet with multiple groups of science educators with extensive experience working with the target population, target student population, also researchers as well as CASP administrators.

06:21:05.006 --> 06:21:12.550
We reached out to the California Science Teachers Association for input and the CASP technical advisory group.

06:21:13.790 --> 06:21:34.262
And Dr. Martha Thurlow, who is the director for the National Center on Educational Outcomes, who reviewed this blueprint and stated that we did take a well-reasoned approach, I quote, and I quote, and that our blueprint and standards should positively impact science education for these students.

06:21:34.802 --> 06:21:45.927
and she recommended that we continue to closely monitor implementation well into the operational rollout of the assessment so that we can gauge impact on individual student instruction.

06:21:46.687 --> 06:21:54.851
We also reached out to Dr. James Pellegrino, who is a professor and co-director of the Learning Sciences Research Institute,

06:21:55.491 --> 06:22:08.885
And he also endorsed the embedded performance task assessment model and agrees that the California alternate assessment for science design and blueprint will support teaching for the student population.

06:22:09.786 --> 06:22:17.154
So at this time, the CDE recommends the approval of the draft blueprint as written in attachment one.

06:22:17.714 --> 06:22:25.040
the general achievement level descriptors as written in attachment two, which provide description of student performance.

06:22:25.561 --> 06:22:33.708
They will be used to develop reporting achievement level descriptors that describe levels of performance to educators, students, and parents.

06:22:34.368 --> 06:22:45.198
And also the score reporting structure as written on page four of the board item, which will report an overall score that includes three achievement levels.

06:22:46.921 --> 06:22:50.283
Would you like me to go on to the next item for approval?

06:22:51.764 --> 06:22:56.626
The next item is, no, let's stop on the science, if that's your presentation on science.

06:22:56.646 --> 06:22:57.747
That's my presentation.

06:22:57.767 --> 06:22:59.868
Okay, questions on science?

06:23:00.908 --> 06:23:03.049
No, no questions from our liaison.

06:23:05.390 --> 06:23:08.432
Okay.

06:23:08.972 --> 06:23:11.413
Well, no, she has another item, the apportionments, right?

06:23:11.433 --> 06:23:12.554
Yes, I have another item.

06:23:12.694 --> 06:23:15.876
Yeah, so before we have public comment, you go to apportionments.

06:23:16.096 --> 06:23:16.296
Okay.

06:23:18.928 --> 06:23:19.469
Separately?

06:23:19.549 --> 06:23:23.076
Do we need item action on this item separately or the two together?

06:23:24.378 --> 06:23:24.579
Okay.

06:23:25.260 --> 06:23:26.142
You can combine them.

06:23:26.362 --> 06:23:28.927
Okay, I can, I can continue.

06:23:30.185 --> 06:23:32.748
So I'll go to the second action item for your approval.

06:23:33.949 --> 06:23:51.187
Remember, California Education Code requires that the State Superintendent of Public Instruction apportion funds to LEAs or local educational agencies to enable them to administer assessments within the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or CAS, system.

06:23:52.188 --> 06:24:00.054
and that the state board to annually establish the amount of funding to be apportioned to LEAs for each test administered.

06:24:00.074 --> 06:24:06.919
Remember the apportionments are provided at a per pupil rate, not per individual subject tested.

06:24:07.539 --> 06:24:13.784
So the apportionment rates are the same as that the state board approved in January of 2017, last year.

06:24:14.404 --> 06:24:18.647
The CDE recommends the apportionment rates as written on page two of the board item.

06:24:19.688 --> 06:24:23.970
So at this time, I am happy to answer or address any questions you may have.

06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:28.993
Seeing no questions on apportionment, I guess we're ready for public comment.

06:24:34.856 --> 06:24:38.719
We have two speakers, Doug McCray and Michael Flores-Casameda.

06:24:40.460 --> 06:24:41.040
Please line up.

06:24:49.027 --> 06:24:49.568
Good afternoon.

06:24:49.588 --> 06:24:53.310
I'm a retired test publisher, Doug McRae, a retired test publisher from Monterey.

06:24:54.331 --> 06:25:04.818
In response to the Smarter Balanced memo on integrity of scores, I had two quick reactions seeing it this morning, both involving the timing for relevant data.

06:25:05.618 --> 06:25:13.724
First, on the second to last bullet, page 1, the work in advance was of testing that they mentioned.

06:25:15.385 --> 06:25:17.827
The simulations, indeed, were in advance.

06:25:18.587 --> 06:25:24.890
But there was no realtime data whether the new items in the bank were performing as anticipated.

06:25:26.611 --> 06:25:28.913
The items were not performing as anticipated.

06:25:29.733 --> 06:25:35.296
No one knew there were problems until the consortium-wide results were released.

06:25:37.540 --> 06:25:43.622
The technical report released a full year after test administration is woefully untimely.

06:25:45.103 --> 06:25:49.105
Six months should be the maximum period of time for release of full technical information.

06:25:49.745 --> 06:25:54.507
Timing suggested in the memo does not permit corrections before the next cycle.

06:25:55.427 --> 06:26:08.458
Quickly, experienced folks with corrections for test scores know that errors are quickly after results are released.

06:26:09.458 --> 06:26:13.301
Having mechanisms to correct should be part of a publisher's toolkit.

06:26:13.802 --> 06:26:21.968
Finally, I do have recommendations for an independent evaluation that specializes in comparability of large-scale assessments from year to year.

06:26:23.454 --> 06:26:28.956
I'd be happy to give that access in my November 22 memo to you.

06:26:31.917 --> 06:26:32.418
Good afternoon.

06:26:32.458 --> 06:26:34.458
Michael Flores-Castaneda with CTA once again.

06:26:34.478 --> 06:26:39.340
And I can't tell you how thrilled I am to talk to you all, especially this audience, on this topic.

06:26:39.681 --> 06:26:43.622
So I'm supposed to tell you that CTA has some concerns about the blueprint for the science assessment.

06:26:44.222 --> 06:26:48.264
What I'm really curious to know is if any of the board members have ever seen the CAA being administered.

06:26:48.844 --> 06:26:52.405
Because if you have, then you know, like I do, that there are serious flaws with this assessment.

06:26:53.065 --> 06:26:59.507
Where the CAPA had a level one option for our more profound students, they could be level one through their entire career, the CAA does not.

06:26:59.967 --> 06:27:05.949
So my third grade students functioning at 24 months are taking the CAA with third grade content.

06:27:06.589 --> 06:27:12.371
From the pilot, I can remember a question on cumulus clouds, which wasn't even a science, it was language arts.

06:27:14.252 --> 06:27:15.013
How does this make sense?

06:27:15.113 --> 06:27:18.235
How is this benefiting my students' functional and life skills?

06:27:18.896 --> 06:27:21.578
It's disheartening, and it's cruel to see them, because they know that they're not getting it.

06:27:21.618 --> 06:27:22.559
They know they're not performing.

06:27:22.579 --> 06:27:25.421
For Monday, I have a planning meeting with my special ed department.

06:27:25.761 --> 06:27:28.083
We were asked to bring the blueprints for the math and language arts.

06:27:28.563 --> 06:27:30.365
So never mind what my students need functionally.

06:27:30.665 --> 06:27:32.166
We're once again teaching to the test.

06:27:32.907 --> 06:27:36.149
I'm just happy I only teach kindergarten through third grade and won't be administering science.

06:27:36.830 --> 06:27:41.973
On behalf of CTA, we would like for the state board to send the blueprints back to the appropriate advisory group for further review.

06:27:42.254 --> 06:27:42.474
Thank you.

06:27:45.396 --> 06:27:47.358
That concludes the public comment.

06:27:47.458 --> 06:27:50.422
I guess I'm ready for a motion.

06:27:52.564 --> 06:27:52.864
Pardon?

06:27:57.109 --> 06:27:58.991
Board members.

06:27:59.011 --> 06:27:59.732
I heard a question.

06:27:59.752 --> 06:28:00.573
I just thought maybe the.

06:28:00.593 --> 06:28:03.336
So I just wondered if the special advisory at all

06:28:05.413 --> 06:28:12.398
Yeah, the assessment division routinely, in fact, every meeting that we have, there's an update.

06:28:12.778 --> 06:28:17.241
So the commissioners are very much aware of the progress of this.

06:28:17.261 --> 06:28:21.945
OK, ready for a motion.

06:28:21.965 --> 06:28:33.473
OK, I will move the department's recommendation on the alternative science assessment blueprints and then also the apportionment rates for LEA.

06:28:36.872 --> 06:28:37.813
No further comment.

06:28:37.913 --> 06:28:39.275
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:28:39.295 --> 06:28:41.999
Okay, that carries unanimously.

06:28:43.521 --> 06:28:48.969
Item 7 on the ETS contract renewal.

06:28:50.768 --> 06:28:55.209
Eric Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

06:28:56.770 --> 06:29:09.633
I get the pleasure of presenting to you Item 7, which asks for movement on our recommendation to extend the contract for ETS.

06:29:10.322 --> 06:29:10.723
from 2018 to 2020.

06:29:10.863 --> 06:29:16.330
As some of you may remember, back in July, you took action and approved CDE to begin the process of negotiations.

06:29:26.824 --> 06:29:30.548
For those of you who don't know, the negotiations of this contract are quite extensive.

06:29:31.068 --> 06:29:47.405
They usually take two or three full days of work, and it's not just CDE staff, but we work in coordination with State Board staff who are present, Department of Finance staff are present, as well as the contractor, in this case, ETS, present in the contract negotiations.

06:29:48.025 --> 06:29:52.808
So, you direct us in July, gave us approval to go and renegotiate that process, which we've done.

06:29:53.949 --> 06:30:01.734
In that, we were also to bring back to you a scope of work and a budget, which is what is attached in this item.

06:30:02.315 --> 06:30:16.039
The attachments are first, an executive summary, second, a very long, I apologize, over 300-page scope of work having to do with this contract, and then lastly, a budget that goes along with it.

06:30:16.599 --> 06:30:20.240
So this contract is due to expire at the end of December.

06:30:20.641 --> 06:30:29.223
So what we are requesting is to approve the scope of work and renew this contract through 2019 administration and 2020 administration.

06:30:32.444 --> 06:30:42.770
In that negotiation process, it always opens up the possibilities of getting new things, always within budget, though, which takes some negotiation and some

06:30:45.416 --> 06:30:49.279
some level of cooperation from our vendor to agree to do some of these things.

06:30:49.439 --> 06:30:57.524
And in fact, there are a few things that I'll just highlight in the scope of work so you don't have to wade through the 300 pages to find it.

06:30:57.845 --> 06:31:06.771
One of the things is we asked in this contract to extend the concurrent users on the system.

06:31:07.151 --> 06:31:11.875
As you remember, when we first had this, we had a concurrent user

06:31:12.735 --> 06:31:14.737
500,000 users at the same time.

06:31:15.057 --> 06:31:17.719
That was the initial contract to do that.

06:31:18.640 --> 06:31:23.724
As the testing went along last year, we realized how close we were getting to 500,000 users.

06:31:24.304 --> 06:31:28.888
Those are 500,000 students sitting down at a computer at the same time accessing this assessment

06:31:29.528 --> 06:31:33.052
either the summative or the interim because both access the same system.

06:31:33.993 --> 06:31:41.281
And as we were getting very close, we went back to ETS and they agreed to extend that concurrent use up to 750,000 students.

06:31:41.321 --> 06:31:43.063
And we needed most of that because we almost hit 600,000.

06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:52.933
And what you don't want to do is get so close to where the system starts slowing down or kicking students off the system.

06:31:54.094 --> 06:31:56.556
And so they made that adjustment for us mid-year.

06:31:56.856 --> 06:32:00.719
So in this contract, we said we need more concurrent users.

06:32:01.200 --> 06:32:03.362
So in this contract, 2 million.

06:32:04.226 --> 06:32:09.993
We now have the capacity to have two million students on the assessment system at the same time.

06:32:12.576 --> 06:32:19.384
Although it's a very large number, we think that this is necessary, not only because of the increased use of the interim assessments,

06:32:19.864 --> 06:32:22.945
But we now have a science assessment coming online.

06:32:23.386 --> 06:32:38.212
And any other assessments in the future we want to add to this system, because to the extent possible, we want to make it easier for school districts so that they're accessing a single system versus, oh, here's my science system to access, and here's my English language arts system to access.

06:32:39.433 --> 06:32:44.055
And so by extending this to 2 million concurrent users,

06:32:44.995 --> 06:32:48.218
We think it allows for that building out of capacity of other assessments.

06:32:48.899 --> 06:33:06.397
ETS will also be working on student score reports in electronic formats, so going beyond paper and pencil and seeing and trying out some electronic formats for student reports that would even be available on a mobile device, always thinking

06:33:06.877 --> 06:33:08.698
You don't wait for the future to plan for the future.

06:33:08.758 --> 06:33:24.385
And so this is what we've done is negotiate for them to do some student score reports in electronic format, as well as provide translations for those reports in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and Filipino to start.

06:33:24.685 --> 06:33:25.305
There's always more.

06:33:26.005 --> 06:33:31.328
And then lastly, we also asked ETS in this contract

06:33:32.228 --> 06:33:47.433
to assist the department in doing the work toward growth models having to do with our assessment results and wanting to use growth models to help inform schools and districts of how their students are doing and the possibility of

06:33:47.973 --> 06:33:52.375
using it in the accountability system depending on what kind of models they come up with.

06:33:52.795 --> 06:33:56.457
So those are just some of the highlights of this contract renewal.

06:33:56.937 --> 06:34:04.461
So the motion, of course, is asking for approval to authorize this contract renewal through 2020.

06:34:06.922 --> 06:34:07.822
Board member comments.

06:34:09.223 --> 06:34:10.303
Questions, I should say.

06:34:10.684 --> 06:34:11.524
Board member Valdez.

06:34:12.793 --> 06:34:15.454
Just a clarification on those electronic reports.

06:34:15.574 --> 06:34:17.635
Are districts going to receive paper copies anymore?

06:34:17.655 --> 06:34:20.317
Are they going to be responsible for printing them or how is that going to work?

06:34:20.497 --> 06:34:20.737
Right.

06:34:21.057 --> 06:34:31.622
So this is, and I don't know quite the right word to use if I use the word pilot or, you know, so this is a test of these electronic, right?

06:34:31.903 --> 06:34:38.266
So we are, I think we're looking for districts that are willing to kind of pilot this.

06:34:39.587 --> 06:34:42.469
So, it's not a full-scale switch.

06:34:42.529 --> 06:34:48.874
We want to try this out a little bit and see how it works before trying to go wide-scale with it.

06:34:50.675 --> 06:34:50.755
Okay.

06:34:50.855 --> 06:34:53.558
Other comment, questions at this point?

06:34:53.778 --> 06:34:54.198
Okay.

06:34:54.618 --> 06:34:55.299
Public comment?

06:35:00.963 --> 06:35:05.427
We have two public commenters, Doug McCray and Katharina Gregana.

06:35:06.127 --> 06:35:06.728
Please line up.

06:35:12.287 --> 06:35:15.289
Hi, I'm Doug McCray, a retired test publisher from Monterey.

06:35:15.689 --> 06:35:32.421
I'm okay with the two-year extension for ETS, but I would like to note quickly, I was pleased to see that the standard setting for the science, the main science test, as well as the Spanish test will be done using operational data in August of 2019.

06:35:34.033 --> 06:35:38.196
rather than field test data this summer of 2018.

06:35:39.237 --> 06:35:48.584
For pages 113, 120 in that scope of work, that's a far better design than has been used for the past three tests that have come.

06:35:49.644 --> 06:35:58.570
Also, I'd like to express a concern on the timing of the release of technical reports for CASP tests needed for interpreting the things.

06:35:59.350 --> 06:36:09.497
ETS provides a final, according to the scope, approximately six months after, yet the CDE has not released them for another six months.

06:36:10.357 --> 06:36:13.119
And I would hope somebody would look into that delay.

06:36:14.060 --> 06:36:14.360
Thank you.

06:36:17.333 --> 06:36:20.575
Okay, there's no more further board comments.

06:36:20.615 --> 06:36:22.076
I think we're ready for a motion.

06:36:24.098 --> 06:36:35.166
Okay, I'll make the motion to approve the contract renewal with the Education Testing Service for the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress.

06:36:35.786 --> 06:36:37.888
And I appreciate CDE's negotiation.

06:36:37.968 --> 06:36:45.193
I see that a lot of the new changes in the contract is going to improve the system itself, so thank you.

06:36:47.961 --> 06:36:49.802
OK, no further discussion.

06:36:50.823 --> 06:36:52.084
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:36:52.104 --> 06:36:54.925
OK, that is carried.

06:36:56.586 --> 06:36:59.468
OK, we're now ready for the waivers.

06:37:01.069 --> 06:37:04.271
And we'll do this in three buckets.

06:37:05.572 --> 06:37:10.355
We have waiver one and waiver three through five.

06:37:11.877 --> 06:37:13.738
and Waiver 7 through Waiver 19.

06:37:15.338 --> 06:37:27.202
So we're excluding from this Waiver number 2 where we need Board Member Rucker to recuse and Waiver 6 which has been pulled off proposed consent.

06:37:28.162 --> 06:37:33.564
So what we need to do then is vote on the ones that are on consent.

06:37:33.584 --> 06:37:35.825
Waiver 1, Waiver 3 through 5, Waiver 7 through 19.

06:37:40.114 --> 06:37:42.355
So can I get a motion on those?

06:37:43.835 --> 06:37:44.295
So moved.

06:37:44.315 --> 06:37:46.276
Second.

06:37:46.336 --> 06:37:46.416
OK.

06:37:46.656 --> 06:37:47.656
Moved and seconded.

06:37:47.776 --> 06:37:49.557
Any public comment on these waivers?

06:37:50.977 --> 06:37:51.257
Yes.

06:37:51.457 --> 06:37:52.818
Michael Flores-Castaneda.

06:37:52.838 --> 06:37:53.658
OK.

06:37:53.698 --> 06:37:55.319
Before we start, board member Strauss.

06:37:58.700 --> 06:38:03.701
So I just believe that waiver nine is Oxnard Elementary School District, not Unified School District.

06:38:03.721 --> 06:38:04.741
I just want to clarify that.

06:38:05.902 --> 06:38:06.362
Waiver nine.

06:38:12.557 --> 06:38:12.857
Go ahead.

06:38:12.877 --> 06:38:13.317
Good afternoon.

06:38:13.797 --> 06:38:22.460
Here for Internave School Facilities and Transportation Services Division, President Kirst, State Superintendent Tom Torlakson, and esteemed members of the board.

06:38:23.380 --> 06:38:28.862
We just need to make a minor, make the board aware of a minor and non-substantive change to Waiver Number 9.

06:38:29.682 --> 06:38:34.123
The name of the school district should have been listed as Oxnard School District, not Oxnard Unified.

06:38:34.983 --> 06:38:35.263
Thank you.

06:38:35.864 --> 06:38:36.584
Okay, thank you.

06:38:38.407 --> 06:38:42.650
Do we have any other comment on these waiver consent items?

06:38:43.190 --> 06:38:47.534
Yeah, OK.

06:38:49.735 --> 06:38:50.696
Not waiver six.

06:38:50.956 --> 06:38:52.317
That is not in this motion.

06:38:54.999 --> 06:38:56.900
OK, that concludes the public comment.

06:38:57.001 --> 06:38:58.722
All of those in favor, raise your hands.

06:38:59.884 --> 06:39:00.904
OK, that was carried.

06:39:00.984 --> 06:39:10.706
Now we have to do waiver two and wait for board member Rucker to recuse.

06:39:10.766 --> 06:39:12.326
That is on consent.

06:39:18.968 --> 06:39:21.728
So is there any public comment on waiver two?

06:39:22.669 --> 06:39:22.889
No.

06:39:23.009 --> 06:39:23.189
No.

06:39:23.869 --> 06:39:24.589
All right, a motion?

06:39:27.583 --> 06:39:29.445
Move approval of waiver number two.

06:39:31.767 --> 06:39:32.948
Second on waiver two.

06:39:32.968 --> 06:39:33.309
Second.

06:39:34.270 --> 06:39:34.610
OK.

06:39:34.730 --> 06:39:36.612
Any public comment on waiver two?

06:39:37.853 --> 06:39:38.093
No.

06:39:38.293 --> 06:39:38.694
All right.

06:39:38.934 --> 06:39:40.476
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:39:41.777 --> 06:39:44.900
OK, now let's ask board member Rucker to come back.

06:39:46.041 --> 06:39:50.105
And we will hear waiver six, and the department will present first.

06:40:00.831 --> 06:40:04.573
Good afternoon, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, board members.

06:40:05.053 --> 06:40:09.336
I'm Barbara Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division here at the CDE.

06:40:10.156 --> 06:40:13.558
Today, I'm presenting to you Waiver 6, which is a physical education waiver.

06:40:14.619 --> 06:40:25.024
Los Angeles Unified School District has requested to waive portions of California Ed Code Section 51222A related to the statutory minimum requirement of 400 minutes

06:40:26.425 --> 06:40:34.328
of physical education each 10 school days for students in grades 9 through 12 in order to implement a block schedule at four of their high schools.

06:40:36.048 --> 06:40:44.391
California Education Code Section 51222A requires a minimum of 400 minutes each 10 school days for the entire school year.

06:40:45.252 --> 06:40:54.095
But because students at the four Los Angeles Unified School District high schools only take PE for one semester, they're seeking a waiver of this section of code.

06:40:55.498 --> 06:41:09.012
Specifically, East Valley High School, John Francis Polytechnic High School, Reseda High School, and Verduga Hills High School are on four by four block schedules where students receive from 804 to 854 minutes of physical education instruction each 10 school days for 18 weeks.

06:41:15.467 --> 06:41:19.549
As background, schools began implementing block schedules in the 1980s.

06:41:20.269 --> 06:41:29.112
Several types of these block schedules incorporate PE instruction on a limited basis and don't meet the statutory requirement of 400 minutes each 10 school days.

06:41:29.993 --> 06:41:41.037
To address this issue, a committee of PE experts, district staff, board members, and CDE staff developed a recommendation for board PE waiver policy, which was adopted in 1984.

06:41:43.118 --> 06:41:53.445
This policy, SBE waiver policy number 99-03, was updated in 1990, 1999, and most recently in July of 2006.

06:41:53.505 --> 06:42:04.473
The board considers waivers for high schools that operate on a block schedule and meet the seven criteria, which are listed on pages three and four of the waiver request.

06:42:06.095 --> 06:42:13.905
CDE staff has worked very closely with the district and each of the four schools to ensure that they have met the criteria as outlined in the policy.

06:42:14.706 --> 06:42:22.636
The district is requesting a temporary waiver, two years minus one day, and will need to apply for a permanent waiver before January 13, 2020.

06:42:25.953 --> 06:42:29.796
The CDE recommends that the waiver be approved with the following conditions.

06:42:30.396 --> 06:42:39.962
That the district must renew the waiver before January 13, 2020, consistent with the conditions in SBE policy 99-03.

06:42:40.783 --> 06:42:43.625
And in addition, the district must create a uniform way

06:42:44.165 --> 06:42:48.226
for each school site to document and report to the district evidence of compliance.

06:42:48.806 --> 06:42:59.169
The district will collect documentation that provides evidence of compliance for each waiver criteria applicable to SBE Waiver Policy 99-03 annually.

06:43:01.109 --> 06:43:02.669
So that's what I have for you today.

06:43:02.689 --> 06:43:05.990
Do you have questions or discussion or how you want to proceed?

06:43:07.351 --> 06:43:07.811
Questions?

06:43:08.111 --> 06:43:09.131
Yeah, Board Member Rucker.

06:43:12.378 --> 06:43:32.048
I have a concern that this would become a permanent waiver because they're asking for this waiver for two years less one day and then for the purpose of doing this evaluation and when they come back what they really want is a way to have this practice implemented permanently.

06:43:32.688 --> 06:43:45.892
And I have a concern about, given the intent, I'm sitting here across the dais from the superintendent who, when he was in the legislature, made health and PE instruction a cornerstone of his legislative policies.

06:43:46.373 --> 06:43:56.856
And the legislature, in creating this weekly minimum requirement for instruction in PE minutes, intended for this to be weekly for all students.

06:43:57.236 --> 06:44:01.998
Not just a number in the aggregate, but as a way of making sure

06:44:02.398 --> 06:44:10.366
that students have a well-rounded education that addresses all of the elements of what it means to help these students develop.

06:44:10.787 --> 06:44:19.336
So while it creates a wonderful bureaucratic way to implement a block schedule and do other types of instructional innovations,

06:44:19.856 --> 06:44:30.423
I think we are shortchanging students by creating a school year schedule where for about half the school year they receive no physical education instruction at all.

06:44:30.863 --> 06:44:45.473
So even though this is a short-term temporary waiver the district made clear in their application for this waiver their intent for this to become permanent and I have great concerns that even though we have the authority

06:44:46.013 --> 06:45:00.761
to waive this and create this temporary waiver, I have great concerns about the long term and sustained policy that this is going to lead to, because when they do come back, the board will be asked to make this a permanent waiver.

06:45:04.943 --> 06:45:06.804
OK, is there any public comment on this?

06:45:07.925 --> 06:45:09.826
Yes, Michael Flores Castaneda.

06:45:14.368 --> 06:45:15.389
Last time today, I promise.

06:45:16.068 --> 06:45:18.410
CTA strongly opposes the proposed waiver before you.

06:45:18.750 --> 06:45:26.417
The problem being that this waiver would not meet the main intent of the statute or even the policy which requires PE to be an ongoing and consistent basis.

06:45:27.477 --> 06:45:32.381
It's essentially like hitting the gym really hard January, then not going back for the rest of the year, wondering what happened.

06:45:33.182 --> 06:45:33.522
Thank you.

06:45:35.844 --> 06:45:38.787
Okay, is there any further board discussion on this item?

06:45:40.228 --> 06:45:40.488
Not.

06:45:40.648 --> 06:45:41.429
Can I have a motion?

06:45:47.091 --> 06:45:48.371
Your board member, Ortiz-Lacombe.

06:45:49.611 --> 06:46:07.035
So my guess is that they're having a really hard time with the master schedule to get this block, the block schedule and they're teaching AP courses or honor courses during that block schedule and therefore they probably see it as more of a benefit to the students and not.

06:46:07.795 --> 06:46:11.856
If we deny this or what does that mean?

06:46:12.876 --> 06:46:13.816
The waiver, we deny it.

06:46:16.081 --> 06:46:21.526
They applied for the waiver because they had a finding around meeting the minimum requirements.

06:46:22.486 --> 06:46:23.847
Right, they were out of compliance.

06:46:24.568 --> 06:46:28.832
And my understanding is that is often the case.

06:46:28.892 --> 06:46:33.175
It comes to our attention that they are not meeting the minimum requirements.

06:46:33.655 --> 06:46:43.023
CDE staff has worked really closely with the district and the schools to pursue this waiver option consistent with SBE waiver policy.

06:46:46.502 --> 06:46:48.544
I'm not sure exactly what happens if you deny it.

06:46:48.584 --> 06:46:53.388
I think typically these go on consent, and this is a little bit new.

06:46:56.711 --> 06:46:57.492
Board Member Burr.

06:46:58.793 --> 06:47:06.180
We might need Nick here, but I think potentially they can lose apportionment funding if they're not in compliance with instructional minutes.

06:47:07.021 --> 06:47:10.824
So it's not just a kind of casual action.

06:47:12.731 --> 06:47:19.955
But consistent with our policy, one of the criteria is that it's in the best interest of the students.

06:47:20.155 --> 06:47:21.396
I just don't see how this is.

06:47:23.737 --> 06:47:26.339
Board member Strauss and then who's next?

06:47:27.660 --> 06:47:28.640
Board member Holiday.

06:47:29.861 --> 06:47:50.756
Well I'm just saying as a block schedule my understanding is instead of taking some class both semesters you take more in one so it's combined so the dilemma around PE is you might have more minutes in one semester because you're on block so if we were to deny it and direct them they'd have to have everything on block and PE not on block which it doesn't kind of

06:47:51.316 --> 06:48:04.240
mesh with block schedule, my sense is we could give them a waiver but look at other options of what other block, there are other places that do block schedules and still manage to meet PE minutes.

06:48:04.820 --> 06:48:09.501
So maybe during the time we ask them to research other and come back with options,

06:48:10.071 --> 06:48:10.892
rather than the issue.

06:48:11.012 --> 06:48:13.854
I mean, I think the issue is ongoing physical fitness.

06:48:13.894 --> 06:48:20.099
I just think that's the contrast to having blocked schedules, which other high schools besides this one have done as well.

06:48:20.259 --> 06:48:25.863
So I'd be interested in seeing what other options there are, but not stopping their block schedule.

06:48:26.344 --> 06:48:27.204
Board Member Holiday.

06:48:28.405 --> 06:48:29.546
That's what I was going to say.

06:48:29.586 --> 06:48:29.927
I agree.

06:48:30.307 --> 06:48:32.789
I think they're taking a step here.

06:48:33.439 --> 06:48:39.167
to create a master schedule, a block schedule, which has so many advantages for so many kids and so many schools.

06:48:39.287 --> 06:48:47.158
I'm a pretty big fan of block schedules for all sorts of reasons, but they always come up with these problems, whether it's foreign language or whether it's PE or one of these others.

06:48:47.578 --> 06:48:49.481
But there are block schedules that work.

06:48:50.001 --> 06:48:51.001
and meet the statute.

06:48:51.461 --> 06:49:07.346
I say, my opinion would be that we would go ahead and provide this waiver, but not as a precedent setting, not as a way of saying it's going to be permanent, not giving that indication at all, and instead saying, okay, we don't want to stop your progress, but we want you to figure this out.

06:49:07.466 --> 06:49:13.988
Because I go to the gym four days a week, and if I miss one day, look out, I'm going to miss three or four after that.

06:49:14.008 --> 06:49:18.469
Okay, any other comments by the board members on this?

06:49:21.189 --> 06:49:33.295
Listening to the good debate on this and recognizing Patricia's history with working on the standard and again trying to have our students as fit as possible, which does have academic consequences too.

06:49:34.536 --> 06:49:48.383
So one option is the one that Bruce just laid out and really make sure, and I mean laid out, make sure that there is a different proposal that accommodates PE after the two years of this waiver.

06:49:48.943 --> 06:49:56.550
Another possible, and this is where it's a question to Barbara, is there a time clock on this waiver?

06:49:56.710 --> 06:50:02.876
Could this be tabled while alternatives are looked at over the next month and a half, two months?

06:50:04.377 --> 06:50:13.065
Or is there a time clock either that the district must have this address within or is there any other time clock for consideration?

06:50:14.263 --> 06:50:21.688
I'd want to consult with legal around ed code because I know many things, but state requirements regarding PE minutes is something new.

06:50:21.728 --> 06:50:23.029
There's always something else to learn.

06:50:23.450 --> 06:50:34.177
But my understanding is if we have a complete submission of things that are required for the waiver and we don't approve them within a certain amount of time, they're somewhere in education code.

06:50:34.577 --> 06:50:38.580
There's a rule that you will have to consider it at the next meeting.

06:50:38.680 --> 06:50:42.903
And if you fail to consider it at the next meeting, then it would become a permanent waiver.

06:50:43.803 --> 06:50:49.765
So you have granted these waivers in the past, as Barb said, consistent with the policy.

06:50:50.065 --> 06:50:53.545
In fact, I believe there were some from on the agenda in November.

06:50:53.645 --> 06:50:55.946
Folsom-Cordova is the one that's popping in my brain.

06:50:55.986 --> 06:50:57.686
I might be not permanent.

06:50:57.746 --> 06:50:58.927
This one's not permanent either.

06:50:59.327 --> 06:51:02.388
But as schools that are operating on a block schedule, I believe as...

06:51:04.469 --> 06:51:08.613
Lisa said, because, you know, they have AP classes and they're trying to work out the schedules.

06:51:09.114 --> 06:51:10.796
So this isn't unusual.

06:51:10.876 --> 06:51:11.877
Permanent would be unusual.

06:51:11.897 --> 06:51:16.623
But the issue here is they want a permanent waiver.

06:51:16.663 --> 06:51:17.704
That's not what this is.

06:51:19.666 --> 06:51:20.427
Not giving it to them.

06:51:22.109 --> 06:51:24.672
So I will move the staff recommendation.

06:51:25.512 --> 06:51:28.995
I'll second.

06:51:30.216 --> 06:51:39.285
Can you consider some kind of amendment or language indicating they need to work on addressing the issue like you outlined Eileen?

06:51:40.604 --> 06:51:59.948
but couldn't staff share that with them and we could ask staff as a follow-up to say we want you to look at other options we support your block scheduling but try to will you explore with other schools that do this and come back with it it's not permanent but we want to give you time to do it I mean do we have to communicate that with them?

06:52:00.288 --> 06:52:06.590
Well I'll work if you prefer not I can work directly with our staff and maybe consult you along along the way Eileen.

06:52:07.450 --> 06:52:07.610
Great.

06:52:09.127 --> 06:52:10.948
OK, so it's been moved and seconded.

06:52:11.068 --> 06:52:12.528
All those in favor, raise your hands.

06:52:13.389 --> 06:52:15.530
OK, there's one no vote.

06:52:15.610 --> 06:52:17.070
Yeah, those opposed, raise your hand.

06:52:17.811 --> 06:52:18.411
You're right.

06:52:18.571 --> 06:52:20.812
OK, passes then with one no vote.

06:52:23.073 --> 06:52:24.974
And so thank you for that.

06:52:25.134 --> 06:52:30.316
And now we're on to the proposed consent calendar.

06:52:30.356 --> 06:52:33.257
These are items 9 through 17.

06:52:35.802 --> 06:52:38.983
18 has been withdrawn, so we're on 9 through 17.

06:52:39.023 --> 06:52:47.586
Is there any public comment on these proposed consent items?

06:52:48.146 --> 06:52:48.406
Yes.

06:52:48.606 --> 06:52:50.407
Monique Ramos for item 16.

06:52:50.447 --> 06:52:51.367
OK.

06:52:53.448 --> 06:52:54.228
Please come forward.

06:52:56.329 --> 06:52:56.549
No?

06:52:57.629 --> 06:52:58.250
Nobody here.

06:52:58.490 --> 06:52:58.870
OK.

06:52:59.790 --> 06:53:02.311
So any board member comments on these items?

06:53:05.262 --> 06:53:10.784
If not, do I need a motion before we can go?

06:53:11.265 --> 06:53:13.245
I move approval of the consent.

06:53:13.285 --> 06:53:14.986
Second.

06:53:15.006 --> 06:53:15.326
OK.

06:53:16.107 --> 06:53:17.027
Moved and seconded.

06:53:17.147 --> 06:53:18.508
All in favor, raise your hands.

06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:21.209
OK, we're moving along.

06:53:21.229 --> 06:53:26.711
We're down to item 19, the State Board Projects and Priorities.

06:53:26.791 --> 06:53:29.432
So we have three parts of this.

06:53:29.532 --> 06:53:30.853
We need to approve the minutes.

06:53:31.658 --> 06:53:40.025
We need to approve the screening committee recommendations, and then we need to report on the various activities of the board members.

06:53:40.946 --> 06:53:45.010
So let's have a motion to approve our minutes.

06:53:49.934 --> 06:53:50.855
Board member Burr.

06:53:50.895 --> 06:53:52.076
Move approval of the minutes.

06:53:52.096 --> 06:53:53.257
Second.

06:53:53.317 --> 06:53:54.218
Second, Holladay.

06:53:54.238 --> 06:53:56.540
No public comment.

06:53:56.760 --> 06:53:58.682
All in favor, raise your hand for the motion.

06:53:59.482 --> 06:54:00.383
Okay, that's the minutes.

06:54:00.464 --> 06:54:07.715
Now we have our screening committee liaisons report on the recommended appointments, of which there are a number for our committees.

06:54:09.261 --> 06:54:09.701
Thank you.

06:54:10.061 --> 06:54:19.763
You have a blue addendum in your basket and first I just want to say thank you to Board Member Williams who assisted with this and Carolyn Pfister.

06:54:20.584 --> 06:54:26.105
We had two vacancies to fill on the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

06:54:26.185 --> 06:54:28.946
Thank you for folks who were interested and applied.

06:54:29.646 --> 06:54:34.427
Based on our review of the applications and our interviews we're recommending

06:54:35.034 --> 06:54:41.857
the following people, Gail Garbolino-Mohica, who's the superintendent of schools in Placer County.

06:54:42.638 --> 06:54:45.079
She would be representing the county superintendents.

06:54:45.699 --> 06:54:56.464
And Jamoke Hinton-Hodge, who is a director of the Board of Education for Oakland Unified School District, and she would be representing school district governing boards.

06:54:57.425 --> 06:55:04.168
So I make the motion to approve those individuals to appointment to ACCS for a two-year term.

06:55:04.795 --> 06:55:12.852
And I would second that and just add that we had, I think it was six candidates for the board, district board.

06:55:14.795 --> 06:55:16.615
I think that's right.

06:55:16.896 --> 06:55:24.117
And they were all well qualified beyond just being a district board member and did well in their phone interview.

06:55:24.537 --> 06:55:26.878
And any of them would have been an asset.

06:55:28.058 --> 06:55:32.740
But this was the one that we thought could make some unique contributions to the board.

06:55:33.620 --> 06:55:36.360
So I'm really pleased with both of the recommendations.

06:55:38.441 --> 06:55:39.161
OK.

06:55:39.881 --> 06:55:42.462
Any public comment on these recommendations?

06:55:43.812 --> 06:55:44.773
Motion to proceed?

06:55:44.793 --> 06:55:54.280
Okay, motion and seconded by motion by Burr, seconded by Williams.

06:55:54.620 --> 06:55:55.881
All those in favor, raise your hand.

06:55:57.402 --> 06:56:00.585
Okay, we're down to the SBE priorities.

06:56:00.705 --> 06:56:08.731
Now we're doing these in order by name because we used to do it by these various organizations and

06:56:09.691 --> 06:56:12.274
We are going to have member Burr start.

06:56:12.334 --> 06:56:13.475
She is first in the order.

06:56:13.495 --> 06:56:18.359
I will just report on CCEE.

06:56:18.399 --> 06:56:20.341
You heard a little bit about that this morning.

06:56:21.542 --> 06:56:23.224
We met in December.

06:56:26.886 --> 06:56:31.950
Executive Director Carl Cohn announced his retirement officially.

06:56:32.710 --> 06:56:40.036
His term or his contract is up in August, which he gave us a three-year commitment when we appointed him to that position.

06:56:40.156 --> 06:56:44.459
So the board is in the process of selecting a recruitment firm.

06:56:45.099 --> 06:56:50.263
We will be making a recommendation to the full board at our February 1st meeting.

06:56:50.843 --> 06:56:53.545
And then we will be kicking off an official recruitment.

06:56:53.605 --> 06:57:03.210
So as you might imagine, we are really scouring everywhere we can for the best talent we can possibly get for the successor to Dr. Cohn.

06:57:03.230 --> 06:57:07.232
So if you have folks that you think would be good fit, send them our way.

06:57:08.893 --> 06:57:22.160
We will have a presentation at our next meeting talking about the pilot projects that you've heard a lot about, the professional learning networks, and then the conversation that we heard this morning about the special education collective.

06:57:22.640 --> 06:57:27.182
So if you're interested in any of those items, tune in on February 1st.

06:57:27.863 --> 06:57:31.365
When are you advertising for the next head of CCEE?

06:57:32.552 --> 06:57:37.475
We expect to select the recruitment from February 1st and we'll get them going right away.

06:57:37.655 --> 06:57:42.318
I should have said that our target date to make the appointment is our June meeting.

06:57:42.938 --> 06:57:52.604
So we're on a pretty fast track here because we'd like to select the next person so that there's overlap between Carl and his successor.

06:57:52.624 --> 06:57:55.546
And so that's our timeline.

06:57:55.906 --> 06:57:59.268
And members who are interested in nominating people should send it to you?

06:57:59.628 --> 06:57:59.869
Yes.

06:58:00.129 --> 06:58:00.389
Okay.

06:58:02.015 --> 06:58:05.280
All right, next is board member Holliday.

06:58:12.594 --> 06:58:27.645
Of course, tomorrow Member Williams and I will be helping assist with the charter items, but I just mentioned briefly the Environmental Literacy Steering Committee and the effort once again to embed environmental literacy throughout the curriculum and the state.

06:58:28.326 --> 06:58:34.751
The ELC's major initiative over 2018 is to ramp up the district partnerships with whom they are working.

06:58:35.654 --> 06:58:44.550
Right now, the ELSC is working with nine school districts to embed environmental literacy into the district priorities, plans, and budgets.

06:58:45.191 --> 06:58:51.915
These projects are being managed by three non-profit organizations with guidance and input from the ELSC.

06:58:52.215 --> 06:58:58.940
Change Scale is managing the partnerships in the Bay Area with four districts, Petaluma, Pajaro Valley, Alameda, and Campbell.

06:58:59.440 --> 06:59:06.204
Tree People is managing three school district partnerships in the Los Angeles area, Glendale, Montebello, and Paramount.

06:59:06.604 --> 06:59:12.528
And Inside the Outdoors is managing the partnerships in the Inland Empire with Rialto and Fontana.

06:59:13.260 --> 06:59:17.603
So there are many opportunities this spring to learn more about the work of the ELSC.

06:59:18.764 --> 06:59:37.216
At ACSIS Superintendent's Symposium in January, there'll be a presentation, Green California Summit in February, California Subject Matter Project Lead Learn Conference in February, the California Charter Schools Association Conference in March, and the California Council for the Social Studies Conference in March as well.

06:59:37.236 --> 06:59:40.579
Okay, Board Member Gray.

06:59:45.291 --> 07:00:00.757
I'm going to talk a little bit about, I know that CASC, the organization, had a conference called Sable this past week actually, and what they did there is the proposals that they presented for you guys in November, they basically

07:00:01.957 --> 07:00:20.642
extrapolated on them and basically talked to the legislation or sorry the Committee on Education in the legislature to you know kind of further the proposal that you guys heard and you know and try to make impact in legislation essentially so yeah.

07:00:20.662 --> 07:00:27.364
Okay now we're up to me and the order.

07:00:28.214 --> 07:00:30.418
I spent a lot of time on the federal liaison.

07:00:30.719 --> 07:00:38.574
I wanted to give a heads up on two meetings that are upcoming that I will attend with no other board members.

07:00:41.106 --> 07:00:50.009
Tony Alpert and Kerrick and myself will meet with the Faculty Senate of the UC, University of California System.

07:00:52.029 --> 07:01:03.012
And we're talking about the university accepting the Smarter Balanced Assessment as one of, in addition to SAT and ACT.

07:01:03.852 --> 07:01:19.539
And then in February, the same group is going down to California State University Long Beach headquarters to confer with people down there about this same movement.

07:01:19.599 --> 07:01:20.939
So that's in the offing.

07:01:22.680 --> 07:01:24.541
So we'll move on to Ortiz-Lacombe.

07:01:26.892 --> 07:01:28.233
Thank you, and let me know when you're in Long Beach.

07:01:28.494 --> 07:01:30.476
We'll be happy to welcome you to my city.

07:01:32.237 --> 07:01:40.966
So for the health framework, the Health Education Curriculum Framework and Evaluation Criteria Committee will be meeting next week, January 25th and the 26th.

07:01:41.086 --> 07:01:42.567
We'll be reviewing all chapters.

07:01:42.968 --> 07:01:45.210
This is the final meeting and I will be attending.

07:01:45.230 --> 07:01:50.895
So it'll be great to put some faces to some of the committee members that have been working so hard with this framework.

07:01:51.877 --> 07:01:59.467
On my page six activities, I co-hosted the majority report, and I believe that all of you received a copy.

07:01:59.507 --> 07:02:01.470
If not, I'm happy to give you a copy.

07:02:01.570 --> 07:02:03.853
This was published by the Education Trust West.

07:02:04.353 --> 07:02:07.998
I co-hosted with Assemblywoman Limon and Assemblyman Santiago in LA.

07:02:08.859 --> 07:02:14.425
It focuses on the history of Latino students in the public school system in California.

07:02:14.585 --> 07:02:19.190
We have been the majority, because I'm Latina, we have been the majority for the last 20 years.

07:02:19.811 --> 07:02:28.320
And there was a couple of things that were celebrated, like the fact that we've increased our high school graduation rate and we've had some improvements along different indicators.

07:02:28.980 --> 07:02:38.228
But also there was an opportunity for us to consider how some of the areas of need of improvement and what we're seeing with our Latino population.

07:02:38.248 --> 07:02:43.212
Once you look at the Latino population by generation, we're not homogeneous.

07:02:43.352 --> 07:02:46.074
There's 16 countries that comprise this student group.

07:02:46.394 --> 07:02:50.918
And so we're very diverse in language, in generation, legal status, and other things.

07:02:51.338 --> 07:03:02.185
So how we could best serve the majority of the state of California, considering that the economic future of California really relies on educating Latinos well.

07:03:03.125 --> 07:03:03.966
And that's all.

07:03:04.086 --> 07:03:08.329
I will be speaking to fellows from Teach Plus on Saturday.

07:03:09.029 --> 07:03:12.931
They wanna learn a little bit more about the function of the State Board of Education.

07:03:13.732 --> 07:03:14.232
Yeah, thanks.

07:03:16.754 --> 07:03:18.535
Okay, then member Rucker.

07:03:23.864 --> 07:03:28.009
Okay, so it's been a busy couple of months since we last met in November.

07:03:29.050 --> 07:03:40.863
Board member Strauss and I worked together as the liaisons for the Instructional Quality Commission, and we, in November, at the end of the IQC meetings in November,

07:03:41.503 --> 07:04:04.142
We said goodbye to some of the original appointed members of the IQC including Dr. Bill Honig who was its first chair and first vice chair and really created the structure and the functionality and the good work that the Instructional Quality Commission has done in January last week as a matter of fact.

07:04:05.163 --> 07:04:11.685
had the orientation, the annual orientation for new members who were added to the IQC, including the swearing in.

07:04:12.146 --> 07:04:14.326
Part of the orientation was very interactive.

07:04:14.386 --> 07:04:20.589
I want to commend department staff for their creativity in putting together an excellent day.

07:04:20.609 --> 07:04:28.311
It was well-participated, well-attended by all but one member of the legislature who could not be there, but it was well-attended.

07:04:28.952 --> 07:04:30.692
Members had a chance to get to know one another.

07:04:31.132 --> 07:04:32.413
There was a marriage proposal.

07:04:34.714 --> 07:04:41.688
Yeah, well, that's a long story I could share with you over coffee, but the important part of that story is it wasn't for me.

07:04:45.666 --> 07:04:50.732
I will let Dr. Strauss give more details about the work and the actions that were taken.

07:04:50.772 --> 07:04:53.975
I just focused on the orientation.

07:04:54.716 --> 07:04:58.981
The Significant Disproportionality Workgroup also met this month in January.

07:04:59.021 --> 07:05:00.022
Their meeting was last week.

07:05:00.062 --> 07:05:03.006
I could not attend that meeting because I did have a conflict.

07:05:03.266 --> 07:05:07.970
but you heard earlier the work that they are doing and the work that they are looking at.

07:05:08.450 --> 07:05:28.965
I want to add as it relates to both the work of the Significant Disproportionality Work Group and the IQC, one of the last things Dr. Honig did while he was chair of the IQC was create an ad hoc committee on accountability, not so much to overlap and monitor the work and advising that the CPAC does for the board,

07:05:30.086 --> 07:05:42.563
but to look at how accountability issues and how some of the accountability decisions and the work that is beginning to blossom and go forward has an impact on the quality of instructional activities that are being conducted.

07:05:42.603 --> 07:05:44.024
They still haven't really figured out

07:05:45.168 --> 07:06:01.198
what that means, but their intent is to support the board in the conversations that we saw germinate today and to be able to provide some advice and give you another frame or another way to look at instructional quality as it relates to some of the work that's going on with accountability.

07:06:02.058 --> 07:06:10.944
On January 23rd, I'll be attending another meeting here at the department with the military compact, with the compact on educational opportunity for military children.

07:06:10.984 --> 07:06:12.705
California is one of the member states.

07:06:13.145 --> 07:06:30.516
Part of the work of that committee is to look at the ways that instructional and legislative decisions for students who are military dependents and how that impacts them as they move from state to state to make sure and that we assure they have full access and all the opportunities that should be provided to them.

07:06:30.936 --> 07:06:40.064
to help them matriculate through our K-12 system but also make the necessary transitions from middle school to high school and from high school to their post-secondary options.

07:06:40.545 --> 07:06:53.597
The committee is looking at and continuing to work with and provide input as the state looks at how to implement the federal requirement to have a unique identifier for military students added to the database.

07:06:54.097 --> 07:07:11.005
And then finally on Monday, I wanna remind the board that I visited on behalf of the board Luther Burbank High School back in the fall, and it was to look at the implementation of social emotional learning in their curriculum as part of their work to implement the Common Core.

07:07:11.445 --> 07:07:19.829
So the social emotional learning state team is having a meeting in the Bay Area on January 22nd, and I'll be attending that meeting on behalf of the board.

07:07:21.401 --> 07:07:29.309
I just want to point out the Instructional Quality Commission in the legislation have this role of sort of seeing how the pieces fit together.

07:07:29.809 --> 07:07:40.038
And so this was evidenced in the statute and I guess they're getting around to the point now that they've done so much work on the curriculum that they're trying to look at the interaction effects.

07:07:40.359 --> 07:07:40.739
Okay.

07:07:41.820 --> 07:07:42.701
Board Member Sandoval.

07:07:45.845 --> 07:07:46.265
Okay.

07:07:46.305 --> 07:07:48.826
First the California State Summer School for the Arts.

07:07:49.206 --> 07:07:55.389
The application is open to all high school students throughout the state and the deadline is February 28th.

07:07:55.449 --> 07:07:56.789
It's an online submission.

07:07:57.290 --> 07:08:12.756
Go to www.csssa.ca.gov and there are just more than 500 slots available for this summer's intensive pre-professional training program at CalArts.

07:08:13.536 --> 07:08:16.637
history, social science framework, a few updates there.

07:08:18.158 --> 07:08:37.987
First, the final publication for the framework is now posted on the CDE website, and final versions and the price list for the state board adopted materials will be available in early April, and the executive summary will soon be available for download, and parent brochures are also going to be available for download.

07:08:38.767 --> 07:08:46.512
And the framework rollout activities continue through the year, through 2018, and you can see dates and locations on the CDE website.

07:08:47.173 --> 07:08:56.258
And also wanted to mention that CCESA will be publishing and training their Instructional Materials Adoption Toolkit for History, Social Science at the end of the month.

07:08:57.599 --> 07:09:06.188
And there was also a CDE held an input webinar for the ethnic studies model curriculum with more than 50 participants across the state.

07:09:06.789 --> 07:09:09.672
And this model curriculum will come to the state board in 2020.

07:09:11.373 --> 07:09:15.637
The Advisory Commission on Special Education meets next month, February 21st and 22nd.

07:09:17.559 --> 07:09:21.202
And I just, again, want to applaud the work of each and every commissioner.

07:09:21.242 --> 07:09:24.103
They really are involved in between meetings.

07:09:24.123 --> 07:09:29.867
They're out in the field doing good work, really engaged in the work that's happening.

07:09:30.347 --> 07:09:33.189
So many moving parts, and they really have their finger on the pulse.

07:09:33.209 --> 07:09:37.072
So I'm really grateful for their counsel and their wisdom and their good work.

07:09:37.732 --> 07:09:38.012
Thank you.

07:09:38.573 --> 07:09:39.113
Thank you.

07:09:39.453 --> 07:09:40.354
Board member Strauss.

07:09:41.035 --> 07:09:42.517
So I have several reports.

07:09:42.777 --> 07:09:56.273
First, the Credentialing Commission met in December, and beyond their regular procedural reviews, including updates on scores for the Cal TPA, the Teaching Performance Assessment,

07:09:56.633 --> 07:09:59.074
They spent a lot of time talking about general ed and special ed.

07:09:59.094 --> 07:10:04.558
There's been a lot of talk about whether you need a general ed credential before you need a special ed credential, whether you need both.

07:10:04.618 --> 07:10:06.779
And there's obviously opinions on both sides.

07:10:06.799 --> 07:10:07.859
So they had a study session.

07:10:07.879 --> 07:10:19.206
It was really important and I think significant of what the outcome was, which is a belief that basically there's a common trunk for credentials that will include all general ed and special ed training for new teachers.

07:10:19.326 --> 07:10:22.908
And then from that, general ed teachers would go into specialized

07:10:23.468 --> 07:10:32.416
training for multiple subject or single sub, but that, and then special ed would go into early childhood, special ed, visual impairment, what they need for their special training.

07:10:32.756 --> 07:10:44.806
But that, I think they've worked really hard on understanding what multiple subject teachers need, but the issue has always been about special ed teaching our most challenged students who still need a good core instruction.

07:10:44.946 --> 07:10:48.529
So there's a real movement, and I think we're gonna hear a lot more about it.

07:10:49.831 --> 07:10:53.066
coming out of a lot of work we're hearing about special ed and the special ed task force.

07:10:54.381 --> 07:10:58.304
and needing, if we want different results, we really need to look at better training so teachers are equipped.

07:10:58.324 --> 07:10:59.985
So I think that was really significant.

07:11:01.006 --> 07:11:06.090
I was really fortunate to attend the Education Commission of the States in Denver, Colorado.

07:11:06.170 --> 07:11:11.374
Glenn Price and I went, and Assemblywoman Weber, three of the members of the California team.

07:11:11.434 --> 07:11:14.836
It's a smaller meeting in the winter, a bigger summit in D.C.

07:11:14.856 --> 07:11:15.637
at the end of June.

07:11:16.457 --> 07:11:19.059
We're just pretty new in joining again.

07:11:19.079 --> 07:11:22.602
So it was interesting because we talked about issues about

07:11:23.002 --> 07:11:27.063
K-12, funding, equity and access, and I'll share a couple others.

07:11:27.403 --> 07:11:30.504
And then we sat at tables with representatives from different states.

07:11:30.844 --> 07:11:35.906
So we could talk about what's California doing on funding, what are you doing on equity and access, what are you doing for higher ed.

07:11:36.286 --> 07:11:39.427
So there were facilitated talks, lots of early learning.

07:11:39.887 --> 07:11:43.530
discussions, which I know we're hearing a lot in all of our educational arenas.

07:11:44.651 --> 07:11:46.292
And so really an opportunity.

07:11:46.352 --> 07:11:57.661
The Educational Commission of the States is really intended to be a policy group that will give us neutral research that we identify what areas we need, and they're coming out to meet with the state team on February 1st.

07:11:59.022 --> 07:12:05.451
President Kirsten and I and some of the state board staff are just going to meet with them and talk about some of the areas that we could use research and support on.

07:12:05.792 --> 07:12:07.655
But it's a neat, nice opportunity.

07:12:07.715 --> 07:12:14.845
And Glenn Price and I got to sit at lunch with Assemblywoman Weber and talk with her, which was a really good opportunity, I think, to do that.

07:12:15.686 --> 07:12:18.767
So that is coming up with the state team.

07:12:19.808 --> 07:12:22.229
Then the concurrent, last week was a busy week.

07:12:22.649 --> 07:12:26.571
And just before IQC, we had the Concurrence Commission, which is the subject matter projects.

07:12:26.951 --> 07:12:31.213
So member Holiday, you'll be happy to know that the first presentation was on environmental literacy.

07:12:32.533 --> 07:12:34.454
And we're talking a lot about how to integrate it.

07:12:34.494 --> 07:12:37.936
They involved all the subject matter leads in the activity.

07:12:37.976 --> 07:12:38.856
It was really exciting.

07:12:39.796 --> 07:12:44.477
And then we had updates from all the partners, CDE, State Board, CSUUC did updates.

07:12:45.158 --> 07:13:01.022
But at the Lead Learn Conference, which is gonna be at UC Davis on the 27th and 28th, member Rucker is going to be, I believe, on the panel, facilitated by Tom Adams, talking about equity and excellence in the age of ESSA.

07:13:01.062 --> 07:13:02.882
So I look forward to hearing.

07:13:03.403 --> 07:13:04.903
It'll be a panel, so I think

07:13:06.224 --> 07:13:06.845
OK, all right.

07:13:09.348 --> 07:13:11.610
So IQC last week, very exciting.

07:13:11.670 --> 07:13:16.315
And actually, Senator Anthony Portantino, who's part of IQC, actually came for part of it.

07:13:19.624 --> 07:13:21.926
Yeah, and he talked a lot about needing late start.

07:13:23.027 --> 07:13:34.556
We had some wonderful additions to our new IQC members, and in addition to procedures, the CDE did some really nice things about, okay, is this a Bagley-Keene violation?

07:13:34.616 --> 07:13:36.057
Is this the right Roberts rule of order?

07:13:36.137 --> 07:13:40.701
And some simulations to help people understand how motions are introduced, what the process is.

07:13:40.741 --> 07:13:46.666
And for those of us who took a little while to see, like, how does a framework get, so first you do standards, then you do frameworks.

07:13:46.766 --> 07:13:48.547
How long does it take to do a framework?

07:13:49.087 --> 07:13:50.568
Then it goes out for public comment.

07:13:50.888 --> 07:14:02.595
It was really, I think, informative because really the original members, as Member Reker said, have gone off now and there's a core that is trying to hold on to the culture of collaboration.

07:14:03.235 --> 07:14:05.356
work that the team has developed.

07:14:05.397 --> 07:14:10.420
So Dean Reese is our new chair, and he's going to help us a lot in our science materials adoption.

07:14:10.700 --> 07:14:12.081
He's been really important in that.

07:14:12.161 --> 07:14:15.683
And Suman Chow is our vice chair, and so those are our new chairs.

07:14:16.303 --> 07:14:23.287
We have a new executive committee, and then each subcommittee established their goals and their priorities for the year.

07:14:23.327 --> 07:14:27.590
So it was really a pretty much organizational meeting, but actually really thoughtful and

07:14:28.010 --> 07:14:32.013
They have a lot of work ahead of them, so we'll hear continued reports on that.

07:14:32.414 --> 07:14:35.817
And then we have a standards implementation steering committee.

07:14:35.857 --> 07:14:39.680
That's a collaboration between CDE, State Board, and CCESA.

07:14:39.980 --> 07:14:44.924
And the idea is to say, once we've done all these standards and frameworks and materials, so how do we implement it?

07:14:45.024 --> 07:14:46.125
And it's a collaboration.

07:14:49.469 --> 07:14:59.764
On February 8th, but there are what the success has done with some grant money is they have a small committee of 30 people or so that considered the collaboration committee, and then they have about 100 people.

07:15:01.192 --> 07:15:12.541
that come together three times a year from regions around the state, those are called communities of practice, to try to build regional capacity so they can go back and train people in the regions of this giant state and diverse state we have.

07:15:12.981 --> 07:15:20.607
So last week the ELA-ELD committee met and CD did a really nice job of presenting dyslexia guidelines and reading and what that means for

07:15:21.327 --> 07:15:22.448
Children with dyslexia.

07:15:22.748 --> 07:15:23.648
It was very helpful.

07:15:23.668 --> 07:15:25.048
And then Tom Adams did an update.

07:15:25.889 --> 07:15:28.830
They don't have grant funding now, so they're smaller.

07:15:28.890 --> 07:15:30.610
They don't have a collaboration committee yet.

07:15:31.010 --> 07:15:32.911
But the community of practice.

07:15:33.931 --> 07:15:38.293
The science collaboration was so exciting to be at on Friday after IQC.

07:15:39.213 --> 07:15:43.617
These are people, leaders around the state are so committed to next generation science.

07:15:43.657 --> 07:15:45.118
They're involved in early implementers.

07:15:45.138 --> 07:15:47.660
They're part of the California Science Teacher Association.

07:15:48.120 --> 07:15:51.903
And they're planning the community practice that's coming up on February 1st and 2nd.

07:15:52.343 --> 07:15:54.465
And it's gonna be out in Rancho Cordova at the Marriott.

07:15:54.785 --> 07:15:58.808
It is energetic about the tools and how they're gonna train people and what lessons.

07:15:59.288 --> 07:16:01.850
And really this is the hope as the new materials come up.

07:16:01.890 --> 07:16:06.814
So I just think we are so fortunate and it's so inspiring to hear what our

07:16:07.254 --> 07:16:14.937
regional leads are doing that are actually gonna impact classroom practice, because we all know in science it's not just a new book, it's a complete shift in organization.

07:16:15.298 --> 07:16:21.980
So that was actually really inspiring and hopeful to think that what we're doing policy-wise, the implementation process.

07:16:22.701 --> 07:16:27.743
They're dealing with regional grants, the early implementers, and taking a look at tools.

07:16:28.523 --> 07:16:32.625
And they're also doing a lot of talk about connecting math and science and not leaving them separate.

07:16:32.885 --> 07:16:38.069
So I think you'll hear some more about that, but I think we're just, this is the inspiring part.

07:16:38.529 --> 07:16:55.301
Then next week, I know we have the county superintendents are meeting the beginning of the week in Monterey, and then ACSA superintendents are meeting, and CDE will be doing a presentation on all the data and the dashboards, and they've asked me to come and talk about our system of support, which I'll build on from our wonderful presentations this week as well.

07:16:56.141 --> 07:16:58.342
And Monday, I will be with Member Recker in Oakland.

07:16:58.702 --> 07:17:02.863
So I'm the liaison to the state, the social emotional learning group.

07:17:02.943 --> 07:17:07.845
And we have Glenn Price presenting on the school climate report.

07:17:07.985 --> 07:17:14.407
And also, they're going to look at the guiding principles and some dissemination about materials that they have and resources they can share.

07:17:14.427 --> 07:17:20.389
And then we have a wonderful luncheon speaker from USC who we're going to hear on why emotions are integral to learning.

07:17:20.489 --> 07:17:23.170
So we'll have more to share as Member Recker and I

07:17:23.950 --> 07:17:24.351
hear this.

07:17:24.411 --> 07:17:30.394
So it's a one-day meeting and it's part of a national network that we're involved in so lots of exciting things.

07:17:30.855 --> 07:17:31.155
Thank you.

07:17:33.196 --> 07:17:34.057
Board Member Sun.

07:17:35.418 --> 07:17:40.981
Well I don't have as many committees as Board Member Strauss so but I got a really good one.

07:17:44.953 --> 07:17:54.823
So the Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee is made up of the representatives from the community colleges and state board member representatives.

07:17:55.003 --> 07:17:57.246
And so we are making some good progress.

07:17:57.326 --> 07:17:59.948
We reviewed some draft principles at our last meeting.

07:18:00.909 --> 07:18:01.709
Very interesting.

07:18:01.849 --> 07:18:14.134
And so we will be refining those at our March meeting, March 16th, and hope to present that to this board pretty soon in the very near future for your review and for you to look at.

07:18:14.554 --> 07:18:21.917
And then last meeting was focused on a lot of credentialing issues, CTE credentials and dual credentials.

07:18:21.997 --> 07:18:23.458
So that's very interesting.

07:18:24.098 --> 07:18:26.519
And I will say it's been a pleasure actually serving,

07:18:27.479 --> 07:18:49.999
serving with member Feliz Ortiz Lacone and member Patricia Rucker on that because we've been doing a bit of a show-and-tell with the community our community part college partners so they show us things that they're doing and we show them things that we're doing and the last time we showed them the CCI career and college indicator and we've learned a few things about that

07:18:51.200 --> 07:18:56.764
It's very different when we look at our items here.

07:18:57.204 --> 07:18:59.866
When we look at CCI, we look at it through the accountability lens.

07:18:59.906 --> 07:19:06.011
But when we look at it through a career pathways lens, we say, oh, that needs some little work.

07:19:06.351 --> 07:19:17.740
So I really appreciate the collaboration we're having, the conversations we're having, and the lens that we're taking a lot of, not just the work of community colleges, but also our own work.

07:19:18.160 --> 07:19:25.008
through that lens of developing workforce pathways and preparing our students for careers.

07:19:32.671 --> 07:19:47.673
Okay, so a few things in end of November, beginning of December, I took Eileen's place at the CSBA conference, and so that was really fun to present with Nancy Burnell, the queen of, you know, the single phrase, one single coherent accountability system.

07:19:48.835 --> 07:19:53.660
And so that was really good to be able to talk to that audience and have conversations.

07:19:54.161 --> 07:20:03.292
And then I was invited to be one of the keynote speakers from CDE's Annual Accountability Leadership Institute for English Learner, Immigrant, and Migrant Student Programs, and so that was a really good opportunity to

07:20:03.792 --> 07:20:08.957
spent some time with some really great leaders on behalf of English learners and immigrant and migrant students.

07:20:09.598 --> 07:20:15.864
And I also attended a portion of the CPAG meeting and heard their report on the conditions of climate as we continue to do that work.

07:20:16.265 --> 07:20:22.170
And next week, the World Language Committee will be meeting for the first time on the 25th and the 26th.

07:20:23.792 --> 07:20:24.533
Board Member Williams.

07:20:27.485 --> 07:20:31.188
I'll start by congratulating Dean Reese for the IQC chair.

07:20:32.289 --> 07:20:41.596
I worked so closely with Dean on NGSS, all through NGSS, and was delighted and not surprised that he became the computer science person as well.

07:20:41.976 --> 07:20:47.780
So we've shared those two roles basically throughout the time I've been on the board.

07:20:48.421 --> 07:20:51.163
And he's just a perfect choice for the chair role.

07:20:52.964 --> 07:21:01.966
So Member Holliday and I attended the ACCS meeting in the hearing in December.

07:21:02.986 --> 07:21:05.626
It was a little frustrating because we didn't have a quorum.

07:21:06.886 --> 07:21:20.549
It was a little frustrating because the technical equipment, the AV equipment did not work and every presenter was interrupted multiple times, which I apologize for because when you're trying to make a case for your school,

07:21:21.429 --> 07:21:24.231
and they keep changing microphones and you can't see it.

07:21:24.631 --> 07:21:26.132
It was embarrassing.

07:21:27.232 --> 07:21:28.233
But it's all fixed now.

07:21:28.733 --> 07:21:32.975
So when they come tomorrow, they'll be okay as far as the AV equipment goes.

07:21:33.675 --> 07:21:41.299
So that ACCS attendance by member Holiday and I just want to remind you that that's not required.

07:21:41.339 --> 07:21:48.163
That's not in our job description as a state board member, but I started doing it from the very beginning that I started on the board because

07:21:48.783 --> 07:22:10.371
I felt like the charter items were so complex, and they are both emotionally demanding if they are renewals, and complex in terms of everybody's perspective on which laws apply and which don't, that it was helpful for me to go through like a dress rehearsal, to go through the ACCS hearing and hear what was said and asked, and then I was better prepared.

07:22:11.351 --> 07:22:13.593
to go through the State Board hearing.

07:22:13.713 --> 07:22:21.937
And as soon as Member Holliday got on the Board and also was my co-liaison, he also committed to doing that, and he has a full-time job.

07:22:22.297 --> 07:22:24.719
So I really appreciate your commitment to doing that.

07:22:26.873 --> 07:22:27.654
So, we did that.

07:22:27.814 --> 07:22:33.660
I also was on the screening committee, as Member Burr indicated, and we got three good candidates.

07:22:33.700 --> 07:22:36.643
So, in February, we are planning to have a full slate.

07:22:37.524 --> 07:22:43.630
And we reinforced several times how important it was that every member come, every commissioner attend.

07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:44.811
It makes a huge difference.

07:22:45.873 --> 07:22:51.340
The CS standards Advisory committee started meeting in September in two day meetings.

07:22:51.400 --> 07:22:58.710
They had four scheduled September October November and January So their last meeting is this Monday and Tuesday.

07:22:58.730 --> 07:23:01.254
I will be there on Tuesday all day and

07:23:02.214 --> 07:23:05.556
That will be their last meeting.

07:23:05.576 --> 07:23:18.263
They will have a pretty complete draft, I understand, from the CDE staff, and that will go out for public comment, one 60-day public comment in April.

07:23:18.544 --> 07:23:26.088
I'm going to say roughly this because I'm not sure of the dates it's going to go out, but basically in the April through early June period.

07:23:27.088 --> 07:23:33.993
expecting to have something coming to the board in September for consideration of adoption.

07:23:36.475 --> 07:23:49.784
We also have a Computer Science Strategic Implementation Advisory Panel, such a long name, and most of those appointments are by the governor, a couple by the superintendent, a couple by the legislature.

07:23:50.384 --> 07:23:55.848
And during this time period in the fall, I supported Karen and the governor's staff with recommendations

07:23:56.668 --> 07:24:07.399
For a variety of people multiple different people for multiple different slots and they've been doing that work and are expecting to have all the nomination all the appointees made

07:24:08.921 --> 07:24:14.785
soon, since the law says that this committee will be convened on or before March 1st.

07:24:15.185 --> 07:24:17.967
So they're moving as expeditiously as they can to finish those.

07:24:19.188 --> 07:24:21.949
And I'll be the liaison to that group's work as well.

07:24:22.510 --> 07:24:25.652
I've also organized a presentation on computer science.

07:24:25.772 --> 07:24:28.994
I'm kind of like mostly about computer science these days.

07:24:29.934 --> 07:24:35.758
I organized a presentation on computer science just recently for the California Charter School Association Conference in San Diego.

07:24:36.578 --> 07:24:46.181
For those of you who go to those conferences, it will be on March 27th, and it will be how various charters are scaling up to implement computer science in their schools.

07:24:46.921 --> 07:24:50.362
Granada Hills Public Charter High School in L.A.

07:24:50.462 --> 07:24:53.123
will present, as well as Aspire will present.

07:24:55.283 --> 07:25:00.587
This is not about the state board, but it's something I've been involved in on NGSS and computer science.

07:25:01.828 --> 07:25:22.963
The UC system, UC Boers started a science and computer science faculty working group last fall to discuss the possibility of perhaps being able to count some high school computer science courses under Area D science.

07:25:23.763 --> 07:25:26.485
and they were taking a look at how that would work.

07:25:27.265 --> 07:25:37.631
As you can imagine, those two faculties, the science people are fairly protective of their department and their area and their criteria.

07:25:38.071 --> 07:25:39.472
And so they've been discussing this.

07:25:40.032 --> 07:25:46.936
They did end up with a recommendation to do so with certain kinds of other criteria that would have to go with it.

07:25:47.696 --> 07:25:59.280
It would not be every computer science course in high school, it would be those that could meet the goals and criteria that are already in Area D, which are pretty much aligned with NGSS, pretty well aligned with NGSS.

07:25:59.620 --> 07:26:02.881
They would do some tweaking on it, but not much tweaking.

07:26:03.101 --> 07:26:06.282
The science people didn't want much tweaking done to it.

07:26:06.402 --> 07:26:12.984
So that decision, a decision by the academic council will occur on January 31st.

07:26:14.364 --> 07:26:23.229
and will then go to the, whether it's yay or nay, to do this, will go to the academic assembly after that.

07:26:25.110 --> 07:26:40.038
And the reason I know about this is because I was asked last, a year ago, last August, by the new UC Board Chair, Henry Sanchez, to meet with him because he became aware that I was doing both NGSS and computer science.

07:26:40.558 --> 07:26:44.583
and wanted to sit and talk about the rationale, a possible rationale for this.

07:26:44.623 --> 07:26:50.829
So I am grateful to him and his staff, Monica Lynn, for keeping me informed on the progress of how this is going.

07:26:51.450 --> 07:26:53.793
So that's the stuff I've been doing for the State Board.

07:26:55.034 --> 07:26:59.058
Another thing I want to announce is that my younger son, Elliot,

07:26:59.999 --> 07:27:03.041
who will turn 33 at the end of this month.

07:27:03.441 --> 07:27:06.803
He's a fourth-year general surgery resident at UC San Diego.

07:27:07.444 --> 07:27:16.369
He proposed to his girlfriend on December 20th, and so I now have a future daughter-in-law in my family.

07:27:17.610 --> 07:27:21.652
and we absolutely love this young woman, so we are thrilled with that.

07:27:23.353 --> 07:27:29.856
So that happened over Christmas, became part of our Christmas scene, and at the same time, we didn't plan any of this.

07:27:30.917 --> 07:27:45.684
Well, we didn't plan that, obviously, but also, Stan and I, my husband and I, bought a townhome in Los Angeles that our older son and his longtime girlfriend will lease from us, and that closed on December 27th.

07:27:46.784 --> 07:27:50.412
So there was just a whole lot happening over Christmas.

07:27:50.472 --> 07:27:53.438
And it was kind of, yeah, it was all good, all good.

07:27:53.498 --> 07:27:55.722
So anyway, we're thrilled, we're thrilled for all of them.

07:27:59.262 --> 07:28:02.964
I was just going to talk about the ACCS, but now I've said my daughter got married this fall.

07:28:05.085 --> 07:28:08.567
No, just to make sure the record is clear.

07:28:08.807 --> 07:28:16.611
The ACCS did have a quorum for all of the agenda items at their meeting, except for the last item.

07:28:16.731 --> 07:28:19.012
It was only the last item where we lost the quorum.

07:28:21.273 --> 07:28:23.114
Okay, that concludes our report.

07:28:23.254 --> 07:28:26.396
And now we're up to item 20, the general public comment.

07:28:28.430 --> 07:28:29.030
Is there any?

07:28:30.251 --> 07:28:30.912
Doug McCray.

07:28:30.932 --> 07:28:42.080
I guess I get the last word.

07:28:47.756 --> 07:28:50.657
I'm Doug McRae, retired test publisher.

07:28:50.677 --> 07:28:59.879
I just got a couple quick comments on, I had a couple public records requests that I'm waiting for information on.

07:28:59.939 --> 07:29:05.340
First, I had two requests for two sets of materials that were sent to the U.S.

07:29:05.360 --> 07:29:07.821
Department of Education for assessment peer review.

07:29:09.902 --> 07:29:33.595
That were supposed to come by the 5th of January haven't come yet, but I have been in communication with the department assessment division and I understand I'm going to get them tomorrow morning, which will be okay But secondly, I is a follow-up to the November state board meeting I request for the LPAC a standard setting validation timeline, which is one of the issues that

07:29:34.281 --> 07:29:35.882
we had back in November.

07:29:36.683 --> 07:29:46.932
And in January 5th, the CDE reply was they do not have a detailed timeline for the study validation study to begin in February.

07:29:46.972 --> 07:29:49.854
And that's really not very credible response.

07:29:50.975 --> 07:29:52.076
I just wanted to mention that.

07:29:52.337 --> 07:29:52.637
Thank you.

07:29:53.918 --> 07:29:56.040
OK, that's the end of general public comment.

07:29:56.060 --> 07:30:02.045
So I want to announce that we're continuing this board meeting rather than adjourning.

07:30:03.128 --> 07:30:07.889
because we want to start tomorrow with the executive session.

07:30:08.509 --> 07:30:11.910
And therefore, we don't have to convene and clear the room and do all that.

07:30:12.030 --> 07:30:26.553
So I will announce that tomorrow morning at 8.30, the state board will be going into closed session to discuss and or take action on the one issue of litigation, LAT versus state at all.

07:30:26.733 --> 07:30:30.874
So we'll see you all tomorrow at 8.30, and we're continuing on.
