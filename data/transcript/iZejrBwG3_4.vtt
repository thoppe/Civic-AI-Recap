WEBVTT

00:09.206 --> 00:09.686
Are we ready?

00:09.726 --> 00:10.106
Can we?

00:12.347 --> 00:13.668
Yeah, I'm going to do the consent.

00:14.368 --> 00:15.669
I don't need to reconvene us.

00:16.909 --> 00:19.230
So, good morning everyone.

00:19.250 --> 00:24.493
You can see that we are beginning to practice social distancing.

00:24.513 --> 00:28.274
All of the chairs are further apart from each other.

00:28.334 --> 00:32.576
We're going to be bringing people in in smaller numbers.

00:33.396 --> 00:36.638
If you're keeping up with the news, there's, you know, advancing

00:37.598 --> 00:57.715
understanding of and knowledge about the spread of the coronavirus, and we want you to care for each other by not hugging, practice the California elbow bump, and stay safe and as far apart as you comfortably can.

00:58.796 --> 01:04.381
So, we will see some adjustments to our meeting for the day.

01:05.161 --> 01:18.673
But we're going to move right ahead now with our consent agenda, which is the regular consent items 10 through 13, and start by asking if there are any public comments on items 10 through 13.

01:22.196 --> 01:25.199
I think we're going out to find if there are public comments.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.442
Things have been a little hectic this morning, so.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.344
We'll know in a moment.

01:35.472 --> 01:36.277
Hang on one minute.

01:37.705 --> 01:38.872
We will get to your comment.

02:00.216 --> 02:02.577
Will the following speakers please line up?

02:02.677 --> 02:11.081
Bill Schultz, Joe Hendricks, Hector Perez-Ponches, Juan Gallegos, and Eric Premack.

02:12.622 --> 02:15.384
And please leave about six feet between you.

02:16.624 --> 02:18.885
This is for the consent items.

02:20.606 --> 02:21.367
Are these?

02:26.429 --> 02:29.331
This is items, consent items 10 through 13.

02:34.935 --> 02:35.336
Welcome.

02:35.796 --> 02:38.018
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:39.420 --> 02:44.065
Good morning and thank you State Board President Darlene Hammond and board members.

02:44.085 --> 02:46.868
My name is Bill Schutz speaking on item 13.

02:48.409 --> 02:56.878
I'm with Danis Pelliver-Kelly here on behalf of Yuba City Unified School District to voice our objection to the issuance of a charter school number for Pathways Charter Academy.

02:57.859 --> 03:06.144
We submitted a letter to the board yesterday outlining the details why the pathways number 2089 should be removed from that list identified for assignment of a charter school number.

03:06.924 --> 03:19.111
The state board holds the important role of gatekeeper to ensure that a charter school number which opens the path to issuance of a CDUS code and entitlement to public funding is only issued to a charter school that is formed in compliance with the law.

03:19.971 --> 03:24.752
Among other things, Pathways violates the current moratorium for new classroom-based charter schools.

03:25.432 --> 03:34.054
The moratorium applies to Pathways even though its petition was approved prior to January 1st because it doesn't fall within the narrow exception to section 47612.7.

03:34.914 --> 03:45.137
This interpretation is consistent with other provisions of AB 1505 which apply to changes to charter schools depending on whether they were in operation as of October 1st.

03:46.778 --> 03:55.026
Also, the October 30th memo from state superintendent Thurman to the board and consistent with the legislative purpose for the moratorium.

03:57.208 --> 04:03.115
With that, we request the state board exercises authority and remove pathways from the list before you today.

04:03.275 --> 04:03.515
Thank you.

04:09.427 --> 04:09.888
Good morning.

04:09.948 --> 04:13.952
I'm Joe Hendricks, Deputy Superintendent for the Sutter County Office of Education.

04:14.392 --> 04:19.277
I'm here to speak regarding the Pathways Charter Academy numbering package on the board agenda today.

04:19.837 --> 04:28.085
AB 1505 moratorium does not impact non-classroom based charter schools approved prior to January 1, 2020.

04:29.987 --> 04:36.292
AB 1505 created a two-year moratorium on the approval of non-classroom based charter school petitions.

04:36.892 --> 04:42.856
The new law was not effective until January 1st and its limits did not go into effect until that date.

04:43.496 --> 04:51.222
Although AB 1505 provides two narrow exceptions to the moratorium, those are only exceptions and not the rule.

04:51.762 --> 04:54.424
Pathways Charter Academy petition was approved on December 13, 2019.

04:54.504 --> 04:54.824
Therefore,

04:58.533 --> 05:02.194
It was timely and properly approved before the moratorium went into effect.

05:02.695 --> 05:08.637
I respectfully request the board approve the charter numbering package for Pathways Charter Academy.

05:09.117 --> 05:09.577
Thank you.

05:09.597 --> 05:13.759
Are there any other public comment?

05:14.599 --> 05:21.282
Can we ask staff to speak to the point that was just made by these two speakers?

05:24.618 --> 05:51.603
With regards to the Judy size chief counsel with regards to the moratorium It is our interpretation that the moratorium does not take effect until January 1 and there is so this petition was approved prior to January 1 and therefore it is Proper proper and legit, okay If there is any other further discussion

05:53.578 --> 05:54.399
Do I have a motion?

05:55.060 --> 05:56.061
A consent calendar.

05:56.422 --> 05:56.802
Thank you.

05:56.822 --> 05:56.983
A second?

05:57.003 --> 05:57.383
I'll second.

05:58.765 --> 05:59.606
Thank you very much.

05:59.846 --> 06:01.088
Any further discussion?

06:01.829 --> 06:02.891
All in favor say aye.

06:02.911 --> 06:02.971
Aye.

06:03.852 --> 06:04.873
Any opposed say nay.

06:04.893 --> 06:06.555
Any abstentions?

06:07.457 --> 06:07.837
All right.

06:08.278 --> 06:09.139
Motion carries.

06:09.239 --> 06:09.600
Thank you.

06:10.994 --> 06:18.738
Agenda item 14 is a public hearing regarding the petition for renewal of a charter school under the oversight.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.540
I did see, however, that Lisa Costanza was here.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.782
Are you in a position to want to make an announcement yet, Lisa?

06:32.706 --> 06:37.649
Okay, why don't you do that before we do the petition for the charter school because that may be a long item.

06:38.269 --> 06:39.470
I know that many people are

06:40.822 --> 06:57.396
trying to keep track of the executive orders and the work of the department in terms of helping schools make their way through decisions about closing and service of students given the coronavirus events.

06:57.496 --> 07:05.963
So Lisa Costanzo is here to give us some updates on that and then we may get a further announcement later in the day because there's a lot in motion.

07:06.423 --> 07:06.784
Correct.

07:07.044 --> 07:07.664
Thank you.

07:07.684 --> 07:10.127
So I would say that that's probably an understatement.

07:10.407 --> 07:13.511
Everything is continuing to go hour by hour.

07:13.531 --> 07:26.565
I will start by just saying that we have been involved in daily calls with the governor's office and his task force really around the Corona COVID-19.

07:27.546 --> 07:29.487
So we're involved in daily calls.

07:29.667 --> 07:40.810
We are continually working with the California Department of Public Health, the California Health and Human Services Agency on what kind of guidance we can provide.

07:40.950 --> 07:44.151
So just over the weekend, we were involved with

07:45.231 --> 07:51.133
actually helping them put together the school guidance that was released on Saturday evening to all the schools.

07:51.193 --> 07:58.735
We put it out through our listservs to superintendents, charter school administrators, and county supes as well.

07:59.916 --> 08:10.859
On top of that, we have been continuing to work and we also participated in an exercise that the governor's office did last Friday as well as this kind of continues to evolve.

08:12.580 --> 08:23.353
Currently, the most recent guidance, part of the school guidance that came out on Sunday, there was also a guidance for higher ed that came out and also a guidance around large gatherings.

08:23.994 --> 08:30.481
So just as recently as last night, there was a guidance that came out at about 11 p.m.

08:30.661 --> 08:32.464
around state public health

08:33.865 --> 08:38.889
experts announcing that gatherings with 250 people or more should be rescheduled or canceled.

08:39.370 --> 08:41.592
So that is the most updated guidance.

08:42.052 --> 08:48.157
It also says that if they are non-essential, they should be limited to no more than 250 people.

08:48.738 --> 08:58.787
And if you are going to have them to exercise social distance, which has become our new term here, along with making sure we're not shaking hands and

08:59.187 --> 09:03.510
continuing to talk about everyone washing their hands for 20 seconds.

09:04.070 --> 09:13.055
So as you can tell, this morning, our staff kind of jumped in and did as best we could to adhere to some of the guidance that came out last night.

09:13.896 --> 09:17.458
So we are continuing to work on this as it evolves.

09:17.478 --> 09:24.082
We are already hearing this morning that, you know, school districts are having emergency meetings about what this means for them.

09:24.762 --> 09:29.365
So we're waiting to see what happens here in the next few hours.

09:29.445 --> 09:32.446
Stephanie and I have already been engaged in some of this this morning.

09:34.247 --> 09:36.889
At this point, as I mentioned, it's continuing to evolve.

09:37.449 --> 09:44.673
The governor's office has been reaching out to us multiple times on a daily basis to see how best we can partner in these conversations.

09:45.013 --> 09:50.716
We're having some today about distance learning, about independent study and what that looks like.

09:51.697 --> 09:54.118
So it's continuing to evolve.

09:54.518 --> 09:56.080
is what I can say at this point.

09:56.120 --> 10:00.305
And the latest guidance is what I just mentioned that came out last night at 11 o'clock.

10:00.986 --> 10:03.349
Are there any specific questions that I can try and answer?

10:07.284 --> 10:11.307
Of course, on the school closures and distance learning, right?

10:11.467 --> 10:11.627
Yes.

10:11.687 --> 10:26.078
And we would just add that it's really important that our schools work very closely with their county public health offices, that any decision that they're thinking about, that they collaborate with their county public health office to make the right decision for their area.

10:26.758 --> 10:32.662
That has been the continual message and it resides through the school guidance document.

10:32.762 --> 10:44.269
It's the continual message that the locals please continue to work through their county public health departments to make those determinations on school closures and how they proceed, how they move forward.

10:44.670 --> 10:49.573
So that has been a continual message from us and from the governor's office on how we should be proceeding.

10:49.993 --> 10:59.439
And also including their county office of education as well in their decision because that county office will have a kind of a landscape of what's happening around that county with districts.

11:01.921 --> 11:02.561
No problem.

11:02.581 --> 11:04.162
There will be more today we're working on.

11:04.183 --> 11:06.184
We'll call you up later for more.

11:06.204 --> 11:10.747
I will keep a tab on things and let you know if anything evolves throughout the day.

11:10.787 --> 11:11.507
Thank you very much.

11:11.527 --> 11:12.928
All right.

11:14.229 --> 11:18.312
Now we'll go to agenda item 14 which is a public hearing regarding

11:18.852 --> 11:23.314
The petition for the renewal of a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education.

11:23.894 --> 11:29.737
Consideration of Academia Advance Charter which was denied by the Los Angeles Unified School District.

11:30.297 --> 11:35.379
Member Ortiz-Lacon must recuse prior to opening this item and looks like she's already done that.

11:37.100 --> 11:56.955
The CDE proposes to recommend that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to renew AAC, a grade six through 12 charter school, based on the department's findings pursuant to EC section 47605 and California Code of Regulations, title five, section 11967.5.

11:57.436 --> 12:00.598
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of CDE.

12:01.439 --> 12:02.680
Stephanie, please begin.

12:05.046 --> 12:05.466
Thank you.

12:06.227 --> 12:13.292
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Chief Deputy Gregson, and the board.

12:14.213 --> 12:17.555
I'm Stephanie Farland, the Director of the Charter Schools Division, and as

12:20.397 --> 12:26.202
As President Darling-Hammond mentioned, we're here today to talk about, for this public hearing, Academia Advance.

12:27.343 --> 12:35.230
Academia Advance Charter is an SB authorized charter school, which was with the term expiring June 30th, 2020.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.992
Oops, I got to remember to do this too.

12:41.175 --> 12:46.958
As required by law, they did submit to their local school district before coming up to the board.

12:47.318 --> 12:55.884
They submitted to LA Unified School District on August 19, 2019, and the LAUSD board denied the petition by a vote of 6 to 1.

12:57.224 --> 13:01.768
On December 2nd, they submitted their petition to the State Board of Ed.

13:02.408 --> 13:07.431
This was heard at the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools at our February 5th, 2020 meeting.

13:08.152 --> 13:13.376
The ACCS moved the CDEU staff recommendation to deny the petition on a vote of 6 to 3.

13:17.607 --> 13:26.990
As mentioned earlier, we are recommending that the SBE deny the request to renew Academia Vonce, which is a grade 6 through grade 12 charter school.

13:28.070 --> 13:37.553
The basis for that recommendation is that they are not consistent with sound educational practice, does not perform overall or at least equal to its comparable school districts,

13:39.887 --> 13:51.321
whether students would otherwise attend, and they're demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program based on fiscal concerns, declining enrollment, and the sound educational practice.

13:57.546 --> 14:10.215
So in terms of reasonably comprehensive description, there are several elements within the charter petition itself that were not satisfactory.

14:11.616 --> 14:19.342
We'll talk a little bit more about that later, but there were issues in the governance structure, employee qualifications, and dispute resolution procedure.

14:19.382 --> 14:20.323
So if approved,

14:21.244 --> 14:32.138
today and as a condition of approval, we would recommend that they change some things in their petition in order to be recommended and to move forward.

14:34.326 --> 14:39.250
They have been in operation since September 2005, so it's not it's not their first renewal.

14:39.731 --> 14:43.814
They were originally authorized by LAUSD in 2005.

14:44.094 --> 14:46.456
They were denied by LAUSD on renewal.

14:47.157 --> 14:53.061
Then they were approved by the county, LA County Office Board.

14:55.223 --> 14:56.564
on the appeal of that renewal.

14:56.664 --> 14:59.407
So they were approved by the LA board in May 2010.

14:59.567 --> 15:04.351
And then when they came up for renewal, they were again denied renewal in 2015.

15:04.531 --> 15:08.054
And in that instance, they came to the state board and were approved.

15:09.557 --> 15:16.521
They are proposing to serve 350 students in grade 6 through grade 12 on two leased facility sites.

15:17.742 --> 15:21.224
They are, as a little background, are a college preparatory school.

15:21.884 --> 15:33.731
Their goal is to ensure that all pupils complete the A to G requirements and are equipped to be accepted into colleges and universities and have opportunities to develop into active citizens characterized by the ideals of a diverse and democratic society.

15:36.816 --> 15:38.378
So we'll get into our findings now.

15:39.239 --> 15:49.968
The CDE selected eight schools, four middle and four high schools, where pupils would otherwise attend and that are comparable and that they have similar enrollment for similar significant subgroups.

15:50.669 --> 15:52.050
And this is a little bit of a change.

15:52.411 --> 15:56.694
We initially, before the ACCS meeting, had selected four schools for

16:00.318 --> 16:10.647
for comparable schools and after the ACCS meeting, after hearing some of the testimony, after listening to Yvonne say, we expanded that to eight schools.

16:11.167 --> 16:22.938
Yvonne say had more schools in their comparable, had selected more schools to compare and felt that some of the schools that we had initially

16:25.039 --> 16:36.321
selected had magnet programs within their school, although those magnet programs didn't have program requirements, academic program requirements, they felt that that wasn't a fair selection of schools.

16:36.421 --> 16:44.943
So, for this round, we added four additional schools and we took those schools off of Avance's list that they had used before ACCS.

16:46.043 --> 16:52.324
So, we did listen during ACCS and changed some of our comparable school selections.

16:53.561 --> 17:00.563
Having done that, it did not change our recommendation.

17:01.844 --> 17:09.786
They still are not performing as well as many of the area schools that kids would otherwise attend in LA Unified.

17:10.546 --> 17:19.929
We also determined in looking at the data that they are underserving their EL population, and we'll get into some of that in a minute.

17:22.817 --> 17:34.643
As far as the dashboard is concerned, there's a lot of words on that, but they do have colors for everything, and I'll go on to the next slide so you can see, and it should be in your packet, the colors.

17:35.643 --> 17:43.627
In terms of English language arts, they are an orange in terms of, this is 2018, so we can compare 2018 to 2019.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.348
They were orange in ELA,

17:47.009 --> 17:47.891
and orange in math.

17:49.774 --> 18:00.452
They had high chronic absenteeism, as you can see there, and they were red in 2018, and their suspension rate was at orange, high college to career in blue.

18:02.679 --> 18:06.341
Move on to the next year, which is dashboard for the year 2019.

18:07.221 --> 18:08.802
They improved in their absenteeism.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.523
They improved in their suspension rate.

18:11.283 --> 18:18.867
They went down in their college and career, went up one in their English language arts, and went down in mathematics, which is currently a red.

18:19.527 --> 18:21.908
And that's a red for all groups and subgroups.

18:24.365 --> 18:33.670
And here's, I really like these little slides because it gives you a good sense of how far away they are from standard in English language arts and in math.

18:34.130 --> 18:40.833
And you can see that they have made improvements in their English language arts over the course of the last three school years.

18:42.134 --> 18:43.935
Oops, I'm going backwards.

18:45.015 --> 18:49.159
Mathematics, unfortunately, has gone the other way.

18:49.219 --> 18:54.024
They did have a small bump in 2017-18, and then they went back down again in 2018-19.

18:54.044 --> 18:58.708
And you can see there how many points they are below standard.

19:00.680 --> 19:12.569
With English learner progress, they are, and we were gonna have some data people here, so I'm pretty sure I'm right about this, is that ELs do not have a color yet in terms of that.

19:13.250 --> 19:17.914
But we can see what their results are in terms of English language acquisition.

19:19.115 --> 19:36.108
and we do have them, we can look at their performance level, which is very low, which is the lowest that you can get, and that they actually have decreased this past year in their LP levels for English language learners.

19:39.602 --> 19:47.169
The board does and the staff does review alternative measures pursuant to Ed Code 52052F.

19:49.130 --> 19:59.740
And as I kind of went over a little bit, the data from the AAC alternative measures reflect some increases in their ALPAC results and their graduation rate, college going rate, and there was a decline in their suspension rate.

20:02.529 --> 20:07.072
A lot of the alternative measures, though, that they send in can't be verified by us.

20:07.573 --> 20:20.823
They're not through, we don't use them in our own accountability system, so while I'm sure Avance, when they come up, will be presenting information from some of their alternative measures, like NWEA,

20:21.743 --> 20:36.352
We have no way of verifying that, and so we sort of make that statement in terms of not being able to verify some of the alternative measures that they use if they're not within our state system.

20:38.329 --> 20:49.401
But there are a couple of areas that are, that we can look at and that we can verify, and we did look at their advanced placement test scores and their SAT scores.

20:50.302 --> 20:58.271
I think it was important for us to understand because, and they'll come up and let you know this, they do have a high college going rate.

20:58.812 --> 21:03.015
So a large, higher than most schools in LA Unified School District.

21:03.855 --> 21:07.118
And so there was a little disconnect for us when we were digging into the data.

21:08.578 --> 21:18.125
Because on the assessments that students normally are required to take in order to get into college, AP is not one of those, but SAT is.

21:18.205 --> 21:25.049
But the AP is a good sign of, you know, they are offering ADG classes there and where the kids are placing on those AP exams.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.351
We were able to look at some of the data there.

21:28.572 --> 21:32.054
And again, hopefully you can see it on your screens.

21:32.094 --> 21:33.615
I know that's a lot of numbers on the screen.

21:35.156 --> 21:47.283
But they were far below LAUSD in their AP exam outcomes in terms of, if you're familiar with the AP exam, you generally, three, four, five are passing scores.

21:47.783 --> 22:09.589
universities generally look at four and fives, and they had in the last round that we were able to pull off the data system, they had two percent of their kids scored at a four, two percent at three, and the rest, which was close to 95 percent, scored at a one and a two.

22:11.309 --> 22:11.870
So that was

22:13.690 --> 22:19.574
That was interesting to learn because they do have a high college going rate.

22:20.054 --> 22:21.515
Same with the SAT scores.

22:23.056 --> 22:25.298
About 80, let's see, 34, 54%

22:29.921 --> 22:32.923
Well, 34% met standards for reading and writing.

22:32.943 --> 22:36.426
19% met standards for mathematics.

22:36.846 --> 22:41.010
And again, well below LAEOC's average.

22:42.311 --> 22:50.677
And just another disconnect in the terms of their high college going rates and not having the scores to reflect that.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.181
Obviously, Academia Avance did their own charter review.

22:59.286 --> 23:01.209
Before I go there, I do want to make a statement.

23:01.970 --> 23:12.467
If you saw the ACCS, we had written in the ACCS item that they were eligible for differentiated assistance.

23:15.291 --> 23:27.918
And after the ACCS meeting, our analysis measurement and accountability division reviewed the business rules associated with the creation of the charter school differentiated assistance file.

23:28.318 --> 23:33.741
And as a result of that review, Avanse and several other charter schools came off the list.

23:34.561 --> 23:38.927
So they are no longer on the list for differentiated assistance.

23:39.568 --> 23:51.925
If you have more questions about how that worked, why that worked, why we had to change the business rules, I'm sure that somebody here from our AMR division can answer those questions.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.901
So Academia Avante did their own review.

23:57.361 --> 23:58.761
They did their own data comparison.

24:00.422 --> 24:05.544
They showed some of their improvements that we talked about earlier from ELA and math.

24:06.525 --> 24:09.186
They will spend some time talking to you about their review.

24:09.926 --> 24:11.286
LA Unified also did a review.

24:13.207 --> 24:21.354
their data supported a finding that their performance of academia avance is not at least equal to the LAUSD schools that the students would otherwise attend.

24:22.054 --> 24:29.400
LAUSD was going to be here today, and they have stopped and postponed travel for their staff.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.823
So, unfortunately, LAUSD will not be here.

24:33.757 --> 24:43.206
Oh, yeah, so their GR person is here, but we were expecting their programmatic charter folks and their fiscal folks to be here today.

24:43.626 --> 24:45.968
And they told us last night that they were not able to come.

24:46.569 --> 24:52.334
So that is, you know, it's unfortunate that they won't be able to be here to support their findings.

24:55.654 --> 25:02.118
After the ACCS meeting, Academia Advance did send in a different set of data accessed through the LAUSD open data portal.

25:03.179 --> 25:15.827
We couldn't really verify the data because when we looked at the numbers, we have access, we could look into the portal, but we didn't, we couldn't verify the data because the numbers that they used in their chart didn't seem to add up correctly for us.

25:17.108 --> 25:19.650
And we can talk about that too if you'd like.

25:20.610 --> 25:24.193
So we just could not verify whether their data was correct.

25:27.035 --> 25:32.241
They also sent in an academic plan that was just sent last week, I think.

25:32.401 --> 25:35.925
So, ACCS nor LAUSD had the opportunity to review that plan.

25:35.945 --> 25:47.857
And it is a academic plan in what they're doing currently in the school year and what they'll be doing in the next couple of years to bring up their achievement levels by their students.

25:51.471 --> 25:56.996
The second piece of our denial recommendation has to do with the inability to implement.

25:59.602 --> 26:05.405
So AAC has a history of recurring audit findings and deficit spending.

26:05.865 --> 26:13.188
There's ongoing concerns based upon CDE's review of their independent audit reports for the last few years.

26:13.748 --> 26:25.234
They did significantly decline in their ending fund balance, and they can talk a little bit about that in terms of due to their losses from a divestiture in an LLC that they were invested in.

26:26.854 --> 26:28.235
I'd say the bigger issue

26:31.814 --> 26:40.311
for CDE is that AAC has a history of selling receivables in order to pay its financial obligations.

26:43.379 --> 26:48.961
Are we all familiar with selling receivables, or would you like me to talk a little bit about that?

26:51.421 --> 26:57.343
I'm not a fiscal person, but I do understand the concept of selling receivables.

27:00.444 --> 27:03.385
Oftentimes, the majority of funding that flows to charters are on a fixed schedule.

27:04.225 --> 27:09.229
And that doesn't always align with when the charter needs cash to pay bills.

27:10.069 --> 27:15.833
And so if a charter is in need to borrow money, they often go to a lender.

27:16.474 --> 27:19.536
And that lender will provide them cash today for a fee.

27:20.137 --> 27:23.959
And in exchange, the charter assigns its future state payments to the lender.

27:26.081 --> 27:29.563
So it's like a loan with high interest rates.

27:29.743 --> 27:31.284
They've been doing this for a long time.

27:32.405 --> 27:39.893
and are projecting that they will continue to use this as a fiscal tool for the next few years.

27:41.534 --> 27:42.695
It's a huge issue for us.

27:42.936 --> 27:49.042
The only way that, so if we go to the next page, I'm going to go to the next page and then I'm going to go back.

27:50.843 --> 27:56.226
You see it might sound weird that we're saying that their project projected budget is viable.

27:56.786 --> 27:59.347
It is viable as long as they're using receivables.

27:59.967 --> 28:02.228
If they were not, then we would have a different story.

28:03.209 --> 28:04.809
So you can see there and the.

28:06.050 --> 28:13.595
previous slide, how much AAC has paid in fees to the charter school capital, which is one of these pretty well-known lending firms.

28:14.856 --> 28:31.728
It's quite a bit in terms of what they've paid up through 2018-19, and then what they're not paying anything this year, but then next year, 2021, you see what the estimates are for future payment, and that's just in their fees for money that they will have to borrow.

28:34.309 --> 28:36.470
in order to have the kind of cash they need to pay their bills.

28:37.530 --> 28:46.274
So while we say that their projected budget is viable, take that as a caveat that they have to sell receivables to do that.

28:48.515 --> 28:56.520
Also, in terms of their enrollment, they never really made as much progress as they wanted to in their projected enrollment.

28:58.541 --> 29:03.503
The slide tells you this is the projected enrollment that they had when they were approved by this board in 2015.

29:03.643 --> 29:06.845
At this point, they projected they would have 625 students.

29:07.025 --> 29:07.765
They currently have about 350.

29:13.769 --> 29:14.590
in grades six through 12.

29:15.291 --> 29:24.942
And so we are concerned, I think that area in general, and if LAUSD was here, but I think they said it at ACCS, a lot of the schools are in declining enrollment in that area.

29:27.165 --> 29:30.349
So we are concerned also about their enrollment.

29:31.909 --> 29:43.362
The CDE finds that the AEC petition, as I had mentioned earlier, does not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the following required elements, the governance structure, employee qualifications, and dispute resolution procedures.

29:43.742 --> 29:47.506
And all of those are in your A1 in much more detail.

29:48.867 --> 29:51.869
So the summary is we are recommending denial of the petition.

29:52.489 --> 30:09.219
We feel that they are inconsistent with sound educational practice, does not perform overall at least equal to its comparable district schools, that they're unlikely to successfully implement the intended program because of fiscal concerns and declining enrollment, and they did not give a reasonably comprehensive description of all the required elements.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.401
And so that's it.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.062
So I think we will hear from the school.

30:17.284 --> 30:17.684
Okay.

30:19.437 --> 30:20.379
Thank you very much.

30:23.706 --> 30:25.329
Sure, that's fine.

30:25.349 --> 30:27.153
A couple of clarifying questions.

30:27.173 --> 30:29.738
We're going to come back up before I open the public hearing.

30:31.663 --> 30:39.228
So, Stephanie, on, at least it's on page nine of the handout, but, I'm sorry, it's on page nine of the handout.

30:40.188 --> 30:50.795
It's, I think, slide 18, where you've got the alternative measures, the AP test scores, and then the next one is on the SAT test scores.

30:51.395 --> 30:55.277
Just to clarify, neither of these were presented at ACCS, right?

30:55.697 --> 30:55.898
No.

30:56.118 --> 30:56.338
Okay.

30:56.838 --> 31:04.686
And also, I'm curious about why you chose to compare to the entire district as opposed to the comparison schools.

31:07.708 --> 31:18.334
I think because when we looked at Avance's second round of data that came in later, they were doing that.

31:19.915 --> 31:23.438
And I don't have, I really don't have a better answer than that.

31:23.558 --> 31:26.619
We didn't take a look at all of the schools.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.622
We just wanted to report, yeah, so I'm sorry Sue.

31:31.041 --> 31:44.909
Okay, so I just would say that if we're going to use a comparison set of schools, which I think is appropriate because they're serving a very specific kind of population, that we follow that through with all of the data that we're presenting would be my request.

31:45.390 --> 32:00.499
Then the last clarifying question or just comment is on slide number 23, which talks about the past fiscal concerns, the last point you make there about significant decline in ending fund balance due to this divestiture,

32:01.599 --> 32:08.462
My understanding was that we required them to do that divestiture when we approved the renewal the last time.

32:08.482 --> 32:19.227
I would have to ask Okay, yeah, so I just think just so for you know in the interest of full disclosure It's not it we kind of put them in that bond so just to clarify.

32:19.367 --> 32:19.687
Thank you.

32:19.887 --> 32:20.147
Thank you

32:26.121 --> 32:36.691
Questions, I'm gonna open the public hearing then I hereby open the public hearing at 913 912 a.m.

32:37.292 --> 32:44.979
First we'll hear from the petitioners the petitioners will have 10 minutes then we will hear from the district that is opposing the renewal petition and

32:45.479 --> 32:47.461
They will also have a total of 10 minutes.

32:48.201 --> 32:56.547
After the presentations from both sides, there will be an opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each.

32:57.368 --> 33:08.957
I understand that in the interest of safety, the school has brought some video presentations and will read some public comment, which we appreciate them.

33:10.257 --> 33:16.180
organizing for us in the cause of social distancing that we're engaged in today.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.902
So, Patricia is available to present.

33:32.008 --> 33:36.330
I'll just note a couple of folks have reasons that they have to take calls this morning.

33:36.430 --> 33:43.813
So, member Nava will step out in the middle of this presentation at some point because of a planned call.

33:44.634 --> 33:46.434
Karen Staffold just had to do the same.

33:46.474 --> 33:50.156
People are keeping a lot of business balls in the air today.

33:52.297 --> 33:52.637
All right.

33:52.657 --> 33:57.599
Good morning State Board.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.801
Thank you very much and we did have several

34:03.123 --> 34:06.664
So yes, Ricardo Mireles with Academia Avance.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.265
We had several parents and students that were not able to come.

34:09.285 --> 34:10.906
So let me move through our presentation.

34:11.566 --> 34:13.467
And you have that in front of you, I believe.

34:14.307 --> 34:15.628
There's a printed copy that you're seeing.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.409
This is the population that we're serving.

34:17.789 --> 34:21.830
It is the highest need population for our region in terms of socioeconomic status.

34:23.211 --> 34:27.733
Important here is that the only significant subgroup that has different data is the English learners because

34:28.653 --> 34:33.117
the Latino population is essentially school-wide and the socioeconomic status is essentially school-wide.

34:34.338 --> 34:36.860
These are the references that we use for our program.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.321
I think you guys are familiar with this.

34:38.861 --> 34:41.543
It's part of our Alliance House program and our Life Prep program.

34:41.984 --> 34:45.446
The intention is to try to close the savvy gap.

34:46.327 --> 34:47.468
Oh yes, it's up there.

34:49.142 --> 34:54.643
Here is information about our high school completers amongst the schools in our region that we were compared to.

34:55.524 --> 34:58.284
We have the highest graduation rate and the lowest dropout rate.

34:59.825 --> 35:07.927
And our key signature here is the fact that we are among the top schools for sending students to college.

35:08.567 --> 35:16.029
And in particular for high population of socioeconomically disadvantaged, we're the top three schools in all of LA Unified.

35:17.809 --> 35:22.031
college attainment and here the look is in terms of persistence.

35:22.051 --> 35:31.575
70% of our alumni are in a four-year program or have already completed their four-year program and this is a specific look in terms of statewide trends.

35:32.416 --> 35:41.199
We are doing double of what the statewide is for Latino students and where our students are continuing on to a post-secondary institution.

35:41.219 --> 35:42.280
I also want to point out that

35:43.541 --> 35:47.843
we're high in terms of having our students go to four-year programs as opposed to two-year programs.

35:49.424 --> 35:52.926
This is the NWA data, lots to see in here but let me move kind of quickly.

35:53.347 --> 36:01.011
What you see is four different subjects and for four different years and then all the grades and the trend is

36:02.552 --> 36:10.963
a big gap to the brown line, which is the national norm, but us consistently moving up so that we finally match the national norm.

36:11.444 --> 36:17.572
And even though it's data that other schools aren't using, we reference the fact that it is nationally normed and recognized information.

36:19.072 --> 36:24.475
This is the key piece that we wanted to bring to your attention today and it goes to the issue of the open data dashboard.

36:25.415 --> 36:38.520
If you do a fair comparison by having proper grade spans so 11th graders compared to 11th graders and middle schools compared to middle school and if you take out the magnet school data which is available through the open data dashboard

36:38.940 --> 36:40.280
We only learned of that recently.

36:40.720 --> 36:54.364
Then in these comparisons to the list of schools that was provided by the state for this last round of comparisons, 59% of the time were better than the high schools and 69% of the time were better than the middle schools.

36:55.204 --> 37:04.706
So it's important because the law states the schools that the students would otherwise attend, it's not clear that they would be able to attend the magnet school programs.

37:06.608 --> 37:15.024
Speaking to recruitment, we really took this issue and we have now enrollment commitments for next fall that surpass 450.

37:15.064 --> 37:15.765
We have some binders here.

37:18.959 --> 37:28.886
that if people want to actually verify or look through these commitments, but it puts us at plus 100 over the 350 target that we have for the fall.

37:29.327 --> 37:31.728
And we have someone who will speak to this recruitment effort.

37:33.770 --> 37:38.093
The fiscal health, we have our fiscal person that will address these questions that were brought up.

37:38.673 --> 37:51.439
But we believe we do have the issue is as was brought up by board member Burr that the challenge that we had for those years is to meet the condition that was given to us.

37:51.959 --> 37:59.223
We actually see that now we have we're meeting the reserve requirements and we have the projections that will let us continue forward.

38:00.383 --> 38:06.406
We meet the renewal criteria and we'll have someone from our staff also, but we want to remind you that this should be a de novo review.

38:06.807 --> 38:11.409
And then if you couldn't verify our data, then did you verify the L-Unified data?

38:11.569 --> 38:16.472
And I think that's an issue that needs to be equally, that tests need to be applied on both sides.

38:17.072 --> 38:26.037
Specifically, given that they are now acknowledging, Dr. Perry has acknowledged that they did include the magnet school outcomes in their comparisons, which makes it problematic.

38:27.397 --> 38:34.120
We have Mr. Frankfurt now who will speak quickly about our academic plan and then we're going to complete our presentation and have some speakers.

38:41.523 --> 38:49.766
I'm here to address our academic plan for this and future school years and also address a number of the concerns that were brought up in the earlier presentation.

38:51.383 --> 38:52.103
Oh, I'm so sorry.

38:52.163 --> 38:52.923
I'm Josh Frankfurt.

38:52.963 --> 38:55.364
I'm the instructional coordinator for Academia Advance.

38:57.085 --> 38:58.865
We're focused on three goals.

38:59.625 --> 39:01.706
One, 7% growth on CASP.

39:02.366 --> 39:06.467
Two, greater math aptitude measured by 7% growth on CASP.

39:07.128 --> 39:10.449
And three, 15% growth in EL reclassification.

39:11.109 --> 39:14.930
These are not new concerns acknowledged at the midnight hour of this renewal process.

39:16.018 --> 39:22.982
These have been identified since summer, and programs have been put in place with guidance from CDE on implementation during the fall semester.

39:23.543 --> 39:26.664
I'd like to walk you through our plan, and I'm happy to answer any questions.

39:27.385 --> 39:35.430
Beginning this fall, after being piloted in individual classrooms for three years, Success for All strategies were rolled out in every classroom.

39:36.090 --> 39:41.756
Each teacher is observed weekly and coached bi-weekly for best practices, data analysis, and rigor.

39:42.336 --> 39:51.785
We're developing integration of resources through the LA Library, including a library card, access to online tutoring, access to 215 databases, and more.

39:52.266 --> 39:57.331
We're also supporting students' emotional needs with Kickboard to encourage positive choices.

39:58.536 --> 40:01.357
Math aptitude is, we acknowledge, our greatest challenge.

40:01.817 --> 40:05.418
Students arrive well below grade level and require rapid recovery.

40:06.018 --> 40:08.678
In response, Avance purchased IXL.

40:09.398 --> 40:12.159
A high school readiness math review is also being piloted.

40:12.959 --> 40:16.120
Finally, our reclassification rate has underperformed.

40:16.720 --> 40:20.461
SFA and parallel teaching offer individual assistance for EL students.

40:21.081 --> 40:23.542
We purchased ListenWise to improve listening skills.

40:23.942 --> 40:28.003
We have adopted a profile system, tracking progress and informing next steps.

40:28.704 --> 40:31.604
Parents receive monthly progress reports with action steps.

40:32.065 --> 40:37.266
We have also followed LAOSD's example, revising our reclassification policy for SPED.

40:38.367 --> 40:42.448
Finally, we are looking into the creation of an ELD-specific course for next year.

40:43.581 --> 40:47.343
We monitor data and feedback to determine each program's impact.

40:47.763 --> 40:50.085
Thus far, we're on track to meet our goals.

40:50.685 --> 40:55.588
Students have answered 213,099 questions.

40:55.608 --> 41:01.691
3,029 skills have been completed to proficiency, and 1,817 skills have been mastered on IXL.

41:02.271 --> 41:06.013
The average diagnostic is set to grow 1.8 grade levels in one year.

41:06.774 --> 41:08.615
In both ELA and math,

41:09.435 --> 41:14.157
This year's mean scale score is the highest we have ever had for winter map.

41:15.217 --> 41:19.579
Average fall to winter growth is also our greatest ever.

41:20.980 --> 41:29.723
And for the first time, both 8th and 11th grades, oh, thank you, both 8th and 11th grades are performing above the national norm for reading.

41:31.152 --> 41:34.034
Using our EL profiles, we've already moved one student.

41:34.474 --> 41:38.197
We have another eight profile E's which need only the LPAC.

41:38.797 --> 41:43.700
An additional seven scored three on last year's LPAC and need extra attention to push to a four.

41:44.201 --> 41:46.902
These students are partaking in weekly tutoring sessions to prepare.

41:47.523 --> 41:52.186
Our SPED team has identified two students who are candidates for reclassification under the new guidelines.

41:52.726 --> 42:04.032
In total, 17 students are within striking distance of reclassification and one has qualified, representing 29% of our EL population with a path to reclassification.

42:05.478 --> 42:06.859
There is work to be done.

42:06.979 --> 42:08.260
We are committed to doing it.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.421
We have been doing it.

42:10.081 --> 42:30.814
We hope that our test results being equal to non-magnet schools, our graduation and college going rates, the nearly actually 475 students that have signed up interest forms that are interested in joining us, and the impact of our program will allow us to continue serving our kids, our families, and our community.

42:30.874 --> 42:31.555
Thank you very much.

42:33.354 --> 42:43.041
As we complete our time here, let me state that we have a statement from our special ed person who actually fell ill last night and is submitting it via video.

42:43.701 --> 42:47.724
We also have an extensive mental wellness counseling program that she'll speak to.

42:48.204 --> 43:01.493
On the issue of the English learners, there's kind of a catch-22 here in that if you really push hard for reclassification as we did two years ago, and we had 45% who recognized it, then it leaves the folks that have the biggest need and they're obviously going to score low, right?

43:01.553 --> 43:03.074
So I hope you recognize that.

43:03.794 --> 43:08.957
We also had a big entry from a significant number of unaccompanied minors.

43:09.017 --> 43:15.221
And so these are students that are not coming in in the sixth or seventh grade, they're coming in in the 10th and 11th grade with significant higher needs.

43:15.821 --> 43:28.529
Lastly, other clarifying points on the issue of advanced placement or SAT scores, our focus is on getting the students to complete the AG requirements, right?

43:28.929 --> 43:32.471
And we are successful at that and obviously it's working because they're going to college.

43:33.431 --> 43:38.314
But and we have our goal is not 100% to take the SAT test, right?

43:38.574 --> 43:43.476
If we're compared to other measures often the schools are only testing half the students and so that that measure is off.

43:44.337 --> 43:47.698
So there are some careful points to look at in terms of the data.

43:48.118 --> 43:50.480
We appreciate the opportunity to present here.

43:50.860 --> 43:56.463
We have some speakers that can speak more to some of the specifics here and I look forward to be able to answer your questions.

43:56.623 --> 43:57.223
Thank you very much.

44:25.587 --> 44:40.195
Linda, because um, Ricard mentioned that there you had video, were you going to do that as part of the public hearing or from your staff?

44:42.796 --> 44:45.758
Okay, I think now we're going to hear from LAUSD.

44:46.358 --> 44:46.538
Great.

44:48.649 --> 44:49.049
Should I go?

44:49.069 --> 44:50.210
Okay, thank you.

44:50.871 --> 44:54.213
Good morning President Darlene Hammond, board members and staff.

44:54.733 --> 45:00.077
My name is Marta Alvarez and I'm the Director of Government Relations for the Los Angeles Unified School District.

45:00.697 --> 45:11.805
Before I begin, I would like to point out that as a result of the coronavirus situation that we're closely monitoring, my colleagues from the Charter School Division were not able to be here today to answer questions.

45:12.605 --> 45:24.016
As such, I will be providing prepared remarks on behalf of Los Angeles Unified and I will not be able to answer questions since I am not the subject matter expert on charter schools or on this petition.

45:25.297 --> 45:36.327
Los Angeles Unified supports the Department of Education staff recommendation for the State Board of Education to deny renewal for the Academic Advancement Charter or AAC.

45:37.248 --> 45:39.670
I would like to focus my comments on two areas.

45:40.631 --> 45:43.733
First, the academic renewal criteria findings.

45:44.894 --> 45:59.865
As noted in CDE's report, the CDE reviewed the information provided by LA Unified and has determined that LA Unified's review and analysis of the people achievement data pursuant to education code section 47607 was comprehensive

46:02.967 --> 46:12.036
and supports the finding that AAC performance is not as equal to the LA Unified Schools that AAC pupils would otherwise attend.

46:13.812 --> 46:18.196
CDE's evaluation did not wholly rely on LA Unified's findings.

46:18.916 --> 46:32.648
CDE conducted its own analysis of the data and selected eight comparison middle schools and high schools where pupils would otherwise attend and that are comparable in that they have similar enrollment for similar significant subgroups.

46:33.688 --> 46:41.273
CDE concluded that AAC does not perform at least equal to or greater than the CDE chosen comparable schools.

46:42.253 --> 46:53.900
Four of these schools are not on our list of comparison schools which demonstrate CDE independently did their own data analysis including selecting what they deem are comparison schools.

46:55.720 --> 47:02.163
Since it was brought up about magnet schools, we did include that information, magnet students, into our performance data.

47:02.663 --> 47:09.466
However, our findings are still relevant considering the fiscal findings and other considerations we took into account.

47:10.846 --> 47:24.320
Secondly, we support CDE's findings that the AAC petition does not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of three of the required elements and is not able to successfully implement the intended program.

47:25.502 --> 47:28.225
Finally, I would like to address the fiscal issues.

47:29.386 --> 47:31.848
Based on the CDE report on August 1st, 2019,

47:33.891 --> 47:44.424
AAC has a fair financial standing, which means that a charter school has shown signs of fiscal distress and needs to take appropriate action to address the declining financial condition.

47:46.025 --> 48:05.737
AAC's four-year history of selling receivables to pay for financial obligations, history of falling below recommended 5 percent cash reserves, and history of recurring audit findings remains a concern, and AAC has not improved significantly in order to negate LA Unified's findings from October 2019.

48:07.538 --> 48:18.449
In conclusion, Los Angeles Unified supports the Department of Education's recommendation and stand by the findings of fact that were adopted by the LA Unified School Board on October 15, 2019.

48:18.509 --> 48:18.910
Thank you.

48:18.950 --> 48:19.230
Thank you.

48:24.955 --> 48:34.488
I think at this point we're ready for public comment and we are going to take public comment at one minute per person.

48:34.508 --> 48:42.619
I know there's some arrangements for the showing of the video that will replace some of the public comment that we would have otherwise had.

48:44.976 --> 48:47.957
Yes, I'm going to call five speakers at a time again.

48:47.997 --> 48:58.182
We ask speakers to space yourself appropriately with the six-foot rule and The first five speakers at Michael Yuba.

48:58.722 --> 49:08.626
We have a statement from Assemblyman Creole Margot Gomez Janelle Riley and Spencer styles and

49:16.493 --> 49:17.073
Good morning, everyone.

49:18.093 --> 49:19.014
My name is Michael Jubin.

49:19.034 --> 49:21.334
I represent the California Teachers Association.

49:22.154 --> 49:30.636
CTA recommends that the State Board of Education deny the renewal petition of the AAC as recommended by the CDE.

49:31.256 --> 49:33.617
And we oppose this renewal for the following reasons.

49:34.777 --> 49:42.439
First, AAC significantly underperforms in multiple areas as compared to their CDE chosen comparable schools.

49:43.559 --> 49:58.667
There was significant fiscal concerns given past audit findings, deficit spending, CDE concerns with their ability to pay its future obligations, and a history of declining enrollment at AAC and in the surrounding areas.

49:59.748 --> 50:12.135
The Los Angeles Unified School District, which has spoke, and the ACCS were both correct to deny the renewal petition, and the State Board of Education should deny this renewal petition as well.

50:12.635 --> 50:12.875
Thank you.

50:20.154 --> 50:23.516
At the request of Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo, I'm going to read the statement.

50:23.777 --> 50:28.080
So, good morning Superintendent Thurmond, President Darning-Hammond, members of the State Board of Education.

50:28.560 --> 50:31.562
Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak in support of Academia Vance.

50:31.622 --> 50:33.524
I strongly encourage you to renew their charter.

50:34.024 --> 50:36.065
Academia Vance is in my district, 51.

50:37.352 --> 50:38.673
which I have the honor of representing.

50:38.733 --> 50:42.515
I have visited the school and Avance students and parents have visited my office on multiple occasions.

50:42.535 --> 50:46.097
Avance has had a positive impact on the students and families it serves.

50:46.117 --> 50:51.561
Avance offers first generation students just like me, the assembly member, an opportunity to succeed.

50:51.581 --> 50:53.382
I feel safe, nurtured, and supported.

50:53.962 --> 51:03.108
Having grown up in the district I now represent, I have graduated from public schools impacted by large classroom sizes, limited resources, and at time a school calendar on a track system.

51:03.700 --> 51:11.083
I understand firsthand the educational challenges and barriers students in my community are facing and how hard their parents are working to achieve education equity.

51:11.483 --> 51:21.147
Many of the students that I want to come from mixed status families who fear unjust deportations as well as unjust evictions in a community facing gentrification and displacement.

51:21.607 --> 51:29.610
My request is that you don't take away what is perhaps the one stable thing in their young lives and that is their school, their teachers, their classmates and the safety of their classrooms.

51:30.049 --> 51:36.832
I believe there is a strong case for renewal when all factors are taken into consideration and ask that you please renew the Avance Charter.

51:36.932 --> 51:37.812
Thank you for your time.

51:37.912 --> 51:40.073
That's a statement from Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo.

51:48.576 --> 51:51.417
Good morning, State Board members, President Linda Darling-Hammond.

51:51.857 --> 51:52.998
My name is Janelle Rooley.

51:53.058 --> 51:59.360
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young, Many, and Core here today in support of Academia Avance's Charter for Renewal.

52:00.959 --> 52:14.811
LA Unified has acknowledged to the charter school that its comparison data was in, sorry, that the schools that it compared to were incorrect insofar as it compared Academia Advance's data to some magnet school, magnet programs.

52:16.152 --> 52:26.802
What the law says in terms of comparison is that we have two different groups of schools that we're comparing to, schools that students are otherwise required to attend and also schools in the district that are demographically comparable.

52:27.162 --> 52:30.984
Students could not be required to attend a magnet school by definition.

52:31.445 --> 52:33.446
These are selective admission programs.

52:33.506 --> 52:34.867
And again, students can't be required.

52:34.887 --> 52:36.588
They have to apply to attend.

52:37.448 --> 52:40.670
LA Unified, in addition to that, also discounted alternative measures.

52:40.730 --> 52:44.713
They said just flat out, we're not going to consider these alternative measures.

52:45.293 --> 52:52.458
So if their comparison is inaccurate and they didn't use alternative measures, there's nothing then for the district's recommendation for denial to stand on.

52:54.359 --> 52:54.979
Thank you very much.

52:55.019 --> 52:56.120
We urge your de novo review.

53:03.905 --> 53:04.386
Good morning.

53:04.526 --> 53:05.807
Thank you for the opportunity to be here.

53:05.847 --> 53:07.169
My name is Margaret Godinez.

53:07.249 --> 53:10.252
I serve on the board for Academia Advance.

53:10.692 --> 53:13.796
And I'm here asking for support of charter renewal.

53:15.678 --> 53:20.659
I wanted to address one of the questions that came up regarding cash balance.

53:20.719 --> 53:23.640
I just met with the board and I wanted to bring you up to date.

53:24.180 --> 53:29.701
As of 6-30, 2020 cash balance is projected to be $376,000 above the 4% required for a reserve, which is $202,000.

53:37.327 --> 53:44.812
Also want you to know that we do forecast not relying so much on receivable sales.

53:45.632 --> 53:51.176
There has been a tremendous effort on behalf of the board to work on improving financial status.

53:51.936 --> 53:56.939
But I also want to mention something that was just brought up by the last speaker.

53:57.480 --> 53:59.761
This school is a very successful school.

53:59.861 --> 54:02.743
I also am a representative of the Highland Park area.

54:02.763 --> 54:03.884
I grew up in that neighborhood.

54:04.684 --> 54:07.206
And it has all the factors of the school.

54:07.226 --> 54:08.587
The focus is on the kids.

54:09.047 --> 54:11.288
You'll be affecting 350 families.

54:11.629 --> 54:12.829
Thank you.

54:18.973 --> 54:21.575
I'm going to go ahead and call the next six speakers.

54:21.655 --> 54:24.036
And following these speakers, there will be a video.

54:26.878 --> 54:31.321
Hector Perez Pacheco, Eric Premack, Manuel Garu,

54:32.961 --> 54:46.192
Esmeralda Balavendo, Milagros Valencio, Jose Chicada, and then we have video after that.

54:46.552 --> 54:46.933
Thank you.

54:50.711 --> 54:51.071
Good morning.

54:51.632 --> 54:54.574
My name is Spencer Stiles, president and CEO of Charter Impact.

54:54.594 --> 54:56.496
We serve as the school's business management firm.

54:57.117 --> 54:58.638
So a couple of things I just wanted to point out.

54:58.698 --> 55:08.987
In summary, I think it's important to take into account the school's most recent audit shows that any and all prior audit findings or deficiencies have been corrected and none are outstanding at this point.

55:09.688 --> 55:12.510
And they have met and are meeting the fund balance reserve requirements.

55:13.511 --> 55:31.050
When it comes to receivable sales, again, I don't think anybody in this room would enjoy the idea of spending additional school funds on interest costs, but it is a very commonly used practice as well as required due to the common and standard natural delay in the school's timing of payments from the state.

55:31.911 --> 55:34.114
The other thing I think it is important for this board to consider

55:34.854 --> 55:45.803
is whether or not it is reasonable to hold a school accountable, either Avancé or any petitioner, for this commonly used practice if they've never been either required or even recommended to curb its use.

55:46.064 --> 55:46.344
Thank you.

55:53.493 --> 55:55.996
Good morning members of the School Board of Education.

55:56.176 --> 55:57.657
My name is Hector Perez-Pacheco.

55:58.278 --> 56:00.400
I am with the Perez-Pacheco Consulting Group.

56:00.921 --> 56:11.292
We have developed and dedicated our life to assist organizations like Avanza to reach their goals in terms of enrollment, in terms of outreach.

56:11.812 --> 56:29.856
We have implemented a successful community grassroots campaign to reach out to numerous families within the community and successfully were able to achieve receiving over 150 enrollment interest forms in support of coming to Academic Avance.

56:30.276 --> 56:33.897
We urge you please to support the renewal of Avance.

56:34.197 --> 56:34.417
Thank you.

56:40.208 --> 56:42.029
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

56:42.049 --> 56:53.613
We've supported this school for a very long time and believe they do a very good work and a heavy lift and with a population that has a lot of needs that often otherwise aren't well served.

56:54.313 --> 57:02.436
We think that the school's financial status is markedly improved and that the borrowing practices are extremely common within the charter sector.

57:03.276 --> 57:12.979
Unfortunately, charter schools don't have access to the kinds of capital markets that traditional public agencies do, and so sales of receivables are both necessary and frequent.

57:13.959 --> 57:22.601
We think that the school has more than met the standards of renewal here, both under the comparison methodology, but more important,

57:23.101 --> 57:29.804
The law says that you shall consider growth and academic achievement as the primary factor.

57:30.224 --> 57:36.686
And that should be dominating the discussion here, and we're kind of getting off track with some of these fraught comparisons.

57:36.786 --> 57:44.429
But under either methodology, I think they've more than met it and more than exceeded it, and hope that you will vote favorably on the renewal.

57:44.549 --> 57:44.829
Thank you.

57:51.201 --> 57:54.925
Hi good morning my name is Esmeralda Balvaneda and I'm an alum from Avance.

57:54.965 --> 57:56.606
I graduated back in 2016.

57:57.767 --> 57:58.788
So just a little background.

57:58.908 --> 58:04.954
I grew up in Highland Park and Highland Park is well known for being surrounded by drugs, gangs and most importantly violence.

58:05.695 --> 58:10.679
The establishment of Avance gave students including myself an option other than the streets and prison.

58:11.880 --> 58:16.665
Because of Avance I was able to establish intimate relationships with my teachers that I wouldn't have been able to do in larger schools.

58:17.445 --> 58:21.429
And because of that, I was able to graduate in the 90th percentile of my class.

58:22.330 --> 58:25.033
And even after I graduated, Advancet still continued to support me.

58:25.613 --> 58:31.439
And they helped me get into a four-year private liberal arts school in Oakland, California, Mills College.

58:32.800 --> 58:37.004
Their continuous support got me and my sister through our first years of college.

58:37.845 --> 58:59.316
And it's because of them that I can probably say that I'll be the first person in my family to graduate in May with the bachelor's in legal studies Which would have not been possible without advances help and the support that they gave me I am forever I am forever grateful and I appreciate everything they've done and I just hope that they can get their charter renewals that they continue so they can continue to give opportunities to other first and low-income students like they did to me.

58:59.756 --> 59:00.016
Thank you

59:06.715 --> 59:07.115
Good morning.

59:07.695 --> 59:09.056
My name is Milagros Vizcaíno.

59:09.756 --> 59:12.517
I am a California Green Building Inspector and a Greenpoint Raider.

59:12.777 --> 59:15.418
I'm currently rebuilding the homes that were lost in the California fires.

59:16.078 --> 59:19.579
I'm the fifth of six children in my family, born in a single-parent household.

59:20.059 --> 59:25.361
I'm the third in my family to graduate from high school and receive a diploma, and the second to go on to a four-year university.

59:25.781 --> 59:27.822
I'm the first to actually begin saving for retirement.

59:28.202 --> 59:28.282
I'm 23.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.463
I was a homeless teenager with a short temper and an even shorter attention span.

59:33.843 --> 59:37.926
Where other schools would have turned me away, Academia Avance listened to me and they provided guidance.

59:38.706 --> 59:43.690
They taught me more than the scientific method, the square root of I, and the Pythagorean theorem.

59:44.711 --> 59:47.012
Every morning begins with a question, what are you doing to help?

59:47.332 --> 59:49.634
Which I don't think I've ever heard in any other school.

59:50.935 --> 59:58.701
Academia Avance demands more of its students than just perfect attendance and 80% or higher on tests and exams and a tucked in polo t-shirt.

59:59.557 --> 01:00:08.042
Academia Advance has taught me to think long term and that no matter my gender, my skin color, or my socioeconomic class, my future is brighter than my past.

01:00:08.663 --> 01:00:12.165
There is no doubt in my mind that Academia Advance is an institution worth renewing.

01:00:12.645 --> 01:00:17.829
And I'm thankful to have attended an institution that saw past my immature eye rolls and repeated tardiness.

01:00:18.229 --> 01:00:18.469
Thank you.

01:00:25.606 --> 01:00:26.007
Good morning.

01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:31.213
My name is Jose Chitala, Academia Avanza class of 2015 and recent alum of the University of California, Berkeley.

01:00:31.694 --> 01:00:42.027
I'm here in support of Academia Avanza because I can certify firsthand that having this school in my home community has been invaluable in directing young people such as myself towards greater opportunities, namely college.

01:00:42.407 --> 01:00:44.490
When I enrolled into Avanza, I was in ninth grade.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:50.254
My academic record leading up to ninth grade was very sound, but I was missing something equally valuable, a life plan.

01:00:50.655 --> 01:00:56.239
Growing up, I lacked the social capital to construct a life path that included college and professional opportunities.

01:00:56.660 --> 01:01:10.491
But Academia Avance, a school located five blocks away from my home, offered a unique program that helped close the opportunity gap for me through frequent college trips, two professional internships, and step-by-step college application guidance, and lifelong mentors.

01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:16.514
It is no accident that Academia Avanza demonstrates outstanding high school graduation and college attainment rates every year.

01:01:17.074 --> 01:01:22.637
Rather, it is the product of a supportive and encouraging school culture that reflects the fulfillment of our school's mission.

01:01:23.057 --> 01:01:23.377
Thank you.

01:01:30.021 --> 01:01:30.341
Good morning.

01:01:31.468 --> 01:01:45.357
My name is Manny Gallardo, I'm an English teacher at Academia Valencia High School, and I'm here to summarize the statements that were written by my students who are learning in the basement of a historical edifice in Highland Park, a place where police do foot patrols after dark, but only on the boulevards.

01:01:45.858 --> 01:01:47.379
The avenues don't get the same respite.

01:01:47.879 --> 01:01:50.301
Coincidentally, those are the streets where our students reside.

01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:54.724
But in spite of the reality that seems overlooked, they come to our school and open their books.

01:01:55.164 --> 01:01:58.246
Five years is what it took to build this environment of respect.

01:01:58.566 --> 01:01:59.647
I met them in seventh grade.

01:02:00.147 --> 01:02:00.908
It's been a long trek.

01:02:01.628 --> 01:02:03.911
But we're one year short of arriving at our destination.

01:02:04.331 --> 01:02:06.733
If you were to ask them about it, they'd answer without hesitation.

01:02:07.234 --> 01:02:09.096
Being college students is their aspiration.

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.538
Providing for their family is their motivation.

01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:15.462
400 alumni is their inspiration, so I'm left pondering one question.

01:02:16.443 --> 01:02:18.065
What can I do to show you our school's worth?

01:02:18.725 --> 01:02:21.668
I can't do it with numbers, but I can think of one word, family.

01:02:22.049 --> 01:02:22.289
Thank you.

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:35.675
Good morning board members, Ramel Antoine for the California Charter Schools Association urging your approval of Academia Advance's renewal.

01:02:36.556 --> 01:02:53.110
They say that it takes a village to raise a child and I can easily say that for the past 15 years Academia Advance has been putting together that village that has been wrapping around these students in this community as you've heard from some of the students today and at the ACC has some moving testimony from parents who've been impacted by ICE.

01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:59.956
It's been important to know that school is not just about academics, but it's about the social safety that is available in the community.

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:14.731
It's clear that Academia Advance on the dashboard does not look that great, but we know that there are other alternative measures that the school has put forward in as many ways possible to show that they have been performing at least as well as the schools that students would otherwise attend.

01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:26.159
It's really clear that we need to make sure that we're comparing the school with the schools that are demographically similar and not the MAGNA programs in the community.

01:03:26.239 --> 01:03:27.700
Those schools can select students out.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:28.981
These students would not be going there.

01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:36.847
It's important that we take into consideration the full context of the school and know that it's a cornerstone of the community.

01:03:36.867 --> 01:03:37.867
I urge your approval.

01:03:37.987 --> 01:03:38.308
Thank you.

01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:42.951
It's my understanding we have a video with this, Tom.

01:03:48.428 --> 01:03:54.231
I have three public commenters here via little one-minute smartphone movies.

01:03:55.592 --> 01:04:00.194
The first two are in English, the last ones in Spanish, and we have a translator back here who will help us out.

01:04:00.794 --> 01:04:02.996
Bear with us as we can make this up as we go along here.

01:04:03.196 --> 01:04:07.198
Let's see where we're at.

01:04:10.099 --> 01:04:10.700
It sure is.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:17.223
Here's the first one.

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:19.851
Hi, my name is Angela Vizcaya.

01:04:19.911 --> 01:04:34.922
I'm the Director of Student Support Services, and on behalf of the students in special education, their parents, and my special education team, which includes counselors and behavior interventionists, I would like to ask that you renew our charter.

01:04:36.023 --> 01:04:38.425
Here's a message from one of our RSP teachers.

01:04:38.945 --> 01:04:47.371
She states that to please allow us to continue providing the resources and education needed to empower our students and build a better community for all.

01:04:48.061 --> 01:05:04.712
My intern states that Avanza's tight-knit community atmosphere allows our students in special education and all of our students to be supported at Avanza where they could be overlooked at a bigger district school.

01:05:05.253 --> 01:05:08.415
So, thank you and I hope that you would consider us for renewal.

01:05:09.976 --> 01:05:11.217
Okay, there's the first one.

01:05:15.784 --> 01:05:17.665
Hello everybody, thank you for coming out today.

01:05:17.865 --> 01:05:23.010
I want to start by saying that Avanza deserves to stay and continue to guide, nurture, and save our lives.

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:27.854
I want to start by saying that Avanza has been my home for the past five years and it has been a blast.

01:05:28.394 --> 01:05:34.640
During the years I have been here, I went through the stages of happiness, loneliness, and most of all, comfort.

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:40.545
Knowing that when I leave this place, I will be in a four-year university, knowing that my future is planned, not having to be found.

01:05:41.085 --> 01:05:44.566
The unconditional support that Lansing family has shown is astonishing.

01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:53.529
Although many people say that our test scores aren't there, we still stand here with all the support of our community and proving every single person wrong.

01:05:54.309 --> 01:05:56.690
This will all be thanks to our phenomenal teaching staff.

01:05:57.070 --> 01:05:59.131
Without them, we wouldn't know the things we know today.

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:02.052
And no one, absolutely no one could take that away from us.

01:06:02.554 --> 01:06:06.875
You might be able to take our school, but it's culture and bond that will stand forever.

01:06:07.435 --> 01:06:09.236
Avante isn't just a school for us kids.

01:06:09.616 --> 01:06:10.316
It's a sanctuary.

01:06:10.336 --> 01:06:11.816
It's a quiet place to do homework.

01:06:11.896 --> 01:06:13.117
It's a resource to the community.

01:06:13.157 --> 01:06:15.437
But lastly, it's a place where we can call home.

01:06:15.877 --> 01:06:17.298
Thank you.

01:06:17.318 --> 01:06:17.518
OK.

01:06:19.678 --> 01:06:20.858
And now, here we go.

01:06:20.878 --> 01:06:23.019
I don't know how this is going to work here.

01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:26.960
Hola.

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.860
Mi nombre es Romulo Abelica.

01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:29.621
Hello.

01:06:29.761 --> 01:06:30.961
My name is Romulo America.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:33.573
I've known Avance for 30 years now.

01:06:33.593 --> 01:06:35.674
I think it's very unfair what you want to do.

01:06:35.694 --> 01:06:37.214
Closing the school will not be a solution.

01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:59.274
Please don't cut the pathway for the kids that already have a way to go forward.

01:07:09.918 --> 01:07:11.319
So please be conscious.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:15.083
Instead of closing schools, we need to open new schools.

01:07:15.123 --> 01:07:18.486
So students have more space, more possibilities, more possibilities.

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:43.820
Please give us a chance to show that this school is a very good school.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.025
Thank you very much for your attention.

01:08:06.645 --> 01:08:14.869
Seeing no other public comment, we will now close the public hearing for this item at 9 48 a.m.

01:08:14.969 --> 01:08:17.370
and commence with board discussion and action.

01:08:18.891 --> 01:08:23.653
Oh all right we will reopen public comment.

01:08:25.594 --> 01:08:27.935
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:08:36.418 --> 01:08:36.979
Good morning.

01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:38.661
My name is Dora Arias.

01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:47.129
I've been a member of this school for 30 years.

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:49.812
I've been a member of the Parent Teacher Association.

01:08:49.832 --> 01:08:52.455
I was here five years ago with two of my kids.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:54.577
I have two kids that have graduated from Academia Avance.

01:09:07.845 --> 01:09:10.227
One of my kids wanted to sell things on the streets.

01:09:10.287 --> 01:09:11.447
That was his purpose in life.

01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:17.152
He didn't have any vision of what he wanted to do.

01:09:17.692 --> 01:09:22.676
But thanks to all the help he received in Academia Avance, he's now doing studies now.

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:36.800
I'm here to support the school and asking you for your support too.

01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:42.782
Because I know for sure that in another school they would not have received the support they received from Academia Avance.

01:09:56.909 --> 01:10:02.153
I'm asking your support because our community needs schools like Academia Avance.

01:10:02.453 --> 01:10:06.637
We need more younger, empowered kids so they have the motivation to go ahead to college.

01:10:06.657 --> 01:10:08.098
Thank you very much.

01:10:24.892 --> 01:10:25.473
Good morning, board.

01:10:25.813 --> 01:10:26.774
My name is Juan Gallegos.

01:10:27.415 --> 01:10:29.497
Alexander is a student at Advance.

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:34.762
And I just think it's unfair that LAUSD keeps comparing our school with magnet schools.

01:10:35.043 --> 01:10:36.304
And I'm in a very unique position.

01:10:36.444 --> 01:10:39.948
I have a son in a magnet school, and it took us over two years just to get him in there.

01:10:40.749 --> 01:10:43.451
All of our students from others are not going to go into a magnet program.

01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:50.235
They're going to go into a general school that's overpopulated, lower graduation rates, lower college acceptance rates, and it's just unfair.

01:10:50.715 --> 01:10:52.316
My son is excelling in advance.

01:10:52.677 --> 01:10:54.758
His grades are off the chart at this point.

01:10:55.138 --> 01:10:56.159
He was in a public school.

01:10:56.199 --> 01:10:58.540
He was below grade level just about in every subject.

01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:01.202
His grades have steadily climbed in the past three years.

01:11:01.642 --> 01:11:04.307
and it'd be a shame if Advance were to close.

01:11:04.747 --> 01:11:11.178
My son is amongst his peers and he's doing such a great job and we're so proud of him that we would hate to see his opportunity be squandered.

01:11:11.478 --> 01:11:11.739
Thank you.

01:11:15.794 --> 01:11:17.235
Is there any other public comment?

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:26.804
All right, seeing no more public comment, I will close the public hearing for this item at 9.50 a.m.

01:11:27.444 --> 01:11:30.207
and commence with board discussion and action.

01:11:30.647 --> 01:11:41.597
First, I want to ask Sue Burr as our state board liaison if she has any initial comments, then we'll ask board members if they have any clarifying questions or comments as part of our board discussion.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:12:03.663
I actually just wondered if – there were a few pages in the Academia Avanse PowerPoint that I thought were particularly relevant, and I thought maybe we were going to have a video on this, but I just wanted to call people's attention to the special education services, the percent of students with an IEP.

01:12:05.942 --> 01:12:10.206
and their graduation rate and college attainment rate for students with disabilities.

01:12:10.727 --> 01:12:15.652
And then, excuse me, I have allergies, I promise, not.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.160
I'm far away from everybody.

01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:29.262
The focus on mental wellness and then the life preparation program, which are their internships that they provide in grade 12.

01:12:30.463 --> 01:12:42.846
And just to say that obviously we are operating under very different circumstances than normal, but at the ACCS meeting we saw many students and I really appreciate the alumni who were able to come and talk.

01:12:43.766 --> 01:12:56.470
and we're not able to see the students here today, but it's very clear that this school provides an unbelievably nurturing and supportive environment for students who have traditionally not been well served.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:04.353
I think you heard that, I think the individual who spoke about family and you see family on their t-shirts is very

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:08.217
compelling and that's certainly what we heard at ACCS.

01:13:08.257 --> 01:13:16.084
So I want to just stop there and say that I'll just preview that I hope we can find a way to yes on the school.

01:13:16.104 --> 01:13:19.628
I think it's a school that deserves to continue to operate.

01:13:20.048 --> 01:13:23.412
It's been in existence for 15 years as you've heard and

01:13:24.273 --> 01:13:28.736
I think the school itself acknowledges that it has areas for growth.

01:13:28.856 --> 01:13:32.860
I think there are some ways to get there that we could talk about through conditions.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:39.345
But I'll just preview that for you and then I'm happy to have other board members ask questions or make comments.

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:46.672
Yes, so I just have some areas for clarification.

01:13:46.692 --> 01:13:53.496
I just want to say I appreciate all the People who came from the school and the community to testify.

01:13:53.556 --> 01:14:11.985
I really appreciate Hearing from you on the specifics There were some areas that I think initially were presented that we saw some alternative data on so I think maybe it's best Stephanie if you first let me just say there were some questions about the financing and the receivables and

01:14:12.545 --> 01:14:36.807
And what I heard, so I'm just kind of collecting the information, was that one of the situations was caused by a criteria for our renewal that they, if you could clarify that, and then also that is this a common practice, the selling of receivables, because that's what we heard from some of the testimony, and I know one of the financial status was one of the areas that was of concern.

01:14:37.007 --> 01:14:38.488
That's one of my first questions.

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:43.093
So yes, charters do sell receivables.

01:14:43.653 --> 01:14:44.794
It is a common practice.

01:14:45.275 --> 01:14:55.644
We would hope that after being open for 15 years that they would have a better fiscal structure so that they wouldn't have to do that.

01:14:56.385 --> 01:14:58.567
And you do see a lot of new schools do that.

01:14:58.667 --> 01:15:00.369
And it's understandable because as we said,

01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:06.553
Their state revenue comes in at times that are not always the same as their schedule.

01:15:06.993 --> 01:15:18.880
But you would think after 15 years of doing that, they would have a fiscal policy in place that would not have them rely on something that's as unstable as selling receivables.

01:15:20.376 --> 01:15:27.522
I wasn't here last time so Carrie Lopes who is in our division can answer the other question.

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:33.708
The issue of the criteria under renewal with the property issue, could you clarify that?

01:15:33.728 --> 01:15:36.090
Yeah, I'll do my best to clarify that.

01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:39.834
So in 2015 when the board originally approved

01:15:40.694 --> 01:15:55.744
Vonsay's renewal in September of 2015, there was a lot of discussion at the board meeting about this property called City Terrace, this limited liability company property that Vonsay had like a 49% interest in.

01:15:57.905 --> 01:16:05.173
And so I think there were some concerns that there was some conflict of interest that was going on between Avance's organization and this property.

01:16:05.293 --> 01:16:16.185
So part of the condition was that Avance was supposed to kind of disentangle themselves from this property and we were giving him time to do that and then to let CDE know when that had happened.

01:16:17.426 --> 01:16:24.348
In terms of a timeline, Avanze did own about 49% interest in the property.

01:16:25.068 --> 01:16:35.731
In 2017-2018, Avanze disposed all remaining interest and returned all the rights back as part of a debt forgiveness agreement that they had made.

01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:45.134
And then in 1819, the balance of the $196,000 note was paid off to the city terrorist.

01:16:45.154 --> 01:16:46.314
It was all paid off.

01:16:46.494 --> 01:16:52.356
And then right now, Avanze no longer owns any interest or any part of that property at all.

01:16:52.696 --> 01:16:56.737
So us asking for the condition of him to pay off the property

01:16:59.258 --> 01:17:06.084
cause some um you know hardship on the budget because the priority was for him to pay off the property.

01:17:06.104 --> 01:17:07.885
Okay I really appreciate the clarification.

01:17:08.326 --> 01:17:26.802
So my next area question um and comment is about the academic issue so I appreciate um the I understand I'm from the LA County area and I understand the Huntington Park community and I know actually we have quite a few charters in the area provided a variety of opportunities for students in Huntington Park

01:17:27.222 --> 01:17:28.724
that have been very positive.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:33.910
I have not been on this campus, but I do know and understand the need in that community.

01:17:34.891 --> 01:17:42.701
What I heard was issues of high college going rate and high college attainment and entrance into four-year colleges

01:17:43.421 --> 01:17:54.864
not eligible for differentiated assistance, but some concerns in English language arts and math, and some issues around what we originally compared the data to and what are like schools versus not.

01:17:55.184 --> 01:18:08.647
So I just want to reaffirm, so where are we, because that is one of our criteria that we look at is sort of what are the opportunities for students in like comparable sites in the community, comparable.

01:18:08.707 --> 01:18:11.228
So could you just clarify, Stephanie,

01:18:12.648 --> 01:18:13.709
Where we are on that?

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:16.351
I'd like to make one clarification.

01:18:16.411 --> 01:18:31.864
We did go back to investigate and ask the district about those magnet programs in those schools that we originally used for comparison and actually are that Avonza used in pulling out the magnet scores.

01:18:32.744 --> 01:18:35.747
So I just want to be clear that they're not magnets

01:18:36.067 --> 01:18:43.052
schools, there are schools that have magnet programs within them, so these kids actually would or could attend those schools if they'd want to.

01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:46.434
They don't have to be in the magnet program to attend those schools.

01:18:46.474 --> 01:18:53.900
So I just want to be clear because it was starting to sound like the whole school was a magnet and kids couldn't get into the school at all and that's actually not the case.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.241
I wanted to be clear about that.

01:18:56.521 --> 01:19:03.363
When we look at the renewal, we did acknowledge that they have made some growth in their ELA and that is great.

01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:11.266
They also said that they needed to work on math, but in their math scores,

01:19:12.947 --> 01:19:35.743
through from grade six to grade eleven uh... have been very very poor uh... even when you even when you take out the magnet school scores which l a u s e allows you to do in their open portal uh... they're still very very poor and and lower than almost all the schools in in that in their comparable school area uh... one of the things that

01:19:36.724 --> 01:19:39.026
You know, we did, so we do a de novo review.

01:19:39.366 --> 01:19:43.830
We don't depend on LAUSD's review of the school.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:47.633
We do a de novo review here at the department and with the board.

01:19:49.155 --> 01:20:02.767
And when Avanze sent in a new group of data for us to look at and for you to look at, one of the issues, and we did, we were thoughtful and we did take a look at

01:20:04.708 --> 01:20:06.769
at the beta they brought in.

01:20:06.829 --> 01:20:22.519
One of the problems was we weren't able to really dig down into the data because the numbers of students that they used for comparison didn't change when they were comparing different grade levels.

01:20:23.099 --> 01:20:29.683
So I know that sounds confusing, but for instance, they had a total student group of 391 kids.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:38.778
Then they took out some of the magnet scores and they compared their 391 kids in their 7 to 12 program.

01:20:38.798 --> 01:20:40.940
And then when they compared to the 9-12 schools, they still used 391 kids.

01:20:48.141 --> 01:20:58.794
So that made it hard for us to figure out how they did their numbers, because they didn't change their total enrollment that they were comparing.

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:05.001
So did you still feel like when you took out the magnet, apparently you were able to do that?

01:21:05.482 --> 01:21:05.662
Yes.

01:21:05.982 --> 01:21:07.104
Because they talked about

01:21:08.085 --> 01:21:12.810
59% better than comparable high schools, 69% better than comparable middle schools.

01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:16.875
And I know schools in that area struggle economically in comparison to some other schools.

01:21:17.175 --> 01:21:27.187
I'm just wondering if you feel like their data, the revisit of the data was accurate in that their kids are doing as well or better than the comparable schools.

01:21:27.347 --> 01:21:41.511
And again, I will say, for instance, they had a chart in their group, in their thing called the CASP High School Comparisons, the 54 non-magnet comparisons, and they said Avances equal 59% better than what they're doing.

01:21:42.452 --> 01:21:46.113
But I wasn't sure, we weren't sure, we went back to look at the data.

01:21:47.954 --> 01:21:56.242
how accurate it was because there are 21 schools on the chart, not 54, and 12 of them have better SBAC scores.

01:21:56.962 --> 01:22:01.406
So the numbers that they use really threw us off because they didn't seem that they were

01:22:02.447 --> 01:22:09.692
right numbers and we weren't sure where they got those numbers from because we looked in the SBAC data, the numbers didn't compute.

01:22:10.432 --> 01:22:11.513
They weren't the same.

01:22:12.313 --> 01:22:18.457
And maybe they have a different way of explaining it or can explain why those numbers didn't compute with us.

01:22:18.898 --> 01:22:23.221
And Stephanie, do you believe they are not eligible for differentiated assistance as accurate?

01:22:25.002 --> 01:22:25.302
Yes.

01:22:25.502 --> 01:22:29.184
And we do have someone from AMARD here.

01:22:29.665 --> 01:22:30.005
He was.

01:22:30.645 --> 01:22:31.486
Oh, there's Cindy right there.

01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.930
Cindy's here.

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:36.973
If you wanted, if you want, maybe some clarification around why.

01:22:37.013 --> 01:22:39.915
These are the areas that I have concerns about.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:42.277
So we'll see if there's some other clarifying questions.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:47.281
Do you want to have a clarification right now about the differentiated assistant list and why some charters fell off?

01:22:47.802 --> 01:22:50.143
Well, if it fell off, I just wanted to make sure that that was accurate.

01:22:50.384 --> 01:22:50.884
Yes, it is.

01:22:50.984 --> 01:22:51.284
It is.

01:22:51.464 --> 01:22:52.005
It is accurate.

01:22:59.036 --> 01:22:59.757
the list here.

01:23:00.877 --> 01:23:03.480
Member Sun and then who else?

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:05.881
Okay, Pagalanon, anyone over here?

01:23:05.901 --> 01:23:10.165
Okay, so Rucker, Sun and Pagalanon in that order.

01:23:10.745 --> 01:23:22.735
Okay, so I'm going to begin by saying I actually did have a number of questions for the LAUSD officials and I'm not going to be able to get those questions answered because I am really confused

01:23:23.214 --> 01:23:25.175
about the data information.

01:23:25.615 --> 01:23:33.938
The questions that you were asked by board member Strauss was helpful, but I want to make sure I understand two points.

01:23:34.958 --> 01:23:41.721
First of all, concerning the comparison to other schools in the district,

01:23:42.381 --> 01:23:47.325
I'm confused about how this list of schools was created.

01:23:47.365 --> 01:23:58.413
So there's, there seems to be a difference in the schools that LAUSD, there seems to be confusion about the schools that LAUSD chose to do their comparisons with.

01:23:58.794 --> 01:24:09.762
So I want to ask you, when the department did their review, did you look at the same schools that LAUSD used?

01:24:09.822 --> 01:24:11.964
Was there, or did you create

01:24:12.504 --> 01:24:29.651
a separate list and is there any overlap between the list of schools you used and the list of schools that LAUSD prepared in their presentation for why the appeal was denied?

01:24:31.412 --> 01:24:32.853
Yes, there is some overlap.

01:24:33.033 --> 01:24:34.453
We pick our own schools and generally we do it by

01:24:38.869 --> 01:24:41.830
I don't know the methodology that LA Unified used to pick their schools.

01:24:56.016 --> 01:24:57.957
But there was definitely some overlap.

01:24:58.097 --> 01:25:17.828
Okay, so the reason why I was asking that is I was trying to understand what the comparisons were and whether or not, because I also was confused by the assertion made by the charter about how they compare to the schools that they were actually being compared to.

01:25:18.448 --> 01:25:32.072
So I also don't understand how they seem to believe, their data seems to show that they are actually doing better than the schools that LEOSD compared them to.

01:25:32.112 --> 01:25:38.394
Can you review again what your findings were in comparing the schools that you looked at?

01:25:40.035 --> 01:25:40.315
Yes.

01:25:40.595 --> 01:25:40.915
Okay.

01:25:41.015 --> 01:25:46.397
So the schools that we looked at in terms of ELA and math,

01:25:48.644 --> 01:26:13.556
Our findings were that Academia Avanze, and I'm on page three of the item, Academia Avanze did not do as well or better than the schools that we used on our comparison list, which, as I said earlier, are eight schools, with the exception of one middle school.

01:26:14.497 --> 01:26:16.258
Is Young Oak a middle, or I can't remember.

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.299
with the exception of two middle schools.

01:26:18.939 --> 01:26:28.265
But none of the high schools did we find that they were doing better than in ELA and math.

01:26:28.685 --> 01:26:30.987
And that is with the increase in schools.

01:26:31.007 --> 01:26:36.951
So as I said earlier, we only used four schools in our first comparison with ACCS.

01:26:36.971 --> 01:26:40.112
And then we decided to go up that number.

01:26:40.172 --> 01:26:44.615
And we went with eight schools, some on their list that they use, Academia Advance.

01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:49.337
and it didn't change much.

01:26:50.479 --> 01:26:57.492
So we still feel that they're not doing as well or better than the schools that their kids would otherwise attend.

01:26:58.149 --> 01:27:12.139
And then as it relates to one of the statements or assertions that I heard from the charter was to be fair, the comparison actually needed to look at the grade span or the students from those schools.

01:27:12.179 --> 01:27:21.986
So I heard you explain that when they did that or when they looked at those comparisons, their student group size didn't change.

01:27:22.046 --> 01:27:27.510
So with each of the successive schools they looked at, you said the student group size remained constant

01:27:28.271 --> 01:27:34.078
at 391, does that mean they were looking at their whole enrollment in the comparisons they made?

01:27:34.098 --> 01:27:37.763
That is where our confusion came in.

01:27:37.903 --> 01:27:39.505
That is what it seemed like.

01:27:40.927 --> 01:27:45.252
They do break it out into middle and high, but they use the same comparison number.

01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:53.175
I'm not sure if this is, I'm not, I'm gonna tell you right now, I don't believe I'm asking this question correctly.

01:27:53.675 --> 01:28:02.661
So in the grade, how many high school students are we talking about at Avance and how many students fall in the other grade span?

01:28:03.202 --> 01:28:04.402
Are you able to tell me that?

01:28:07.945 --> 01:28:13.849
Not from the data that they gave us and I don't know that I have that off the top of my head.

01:28:16.148 --> 01:28:18.330
No, but Avanti can come up and speak to that as well.

01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:23.233
Are you asking just for how many 11th graders that have scores, right?

01:28:23.253 --> 01:28:23.473
Sure.

01:28:23.573 --> 01:28:25.054
Opposed to all of 9th through grade 12?

01:28:25.635 --> 01:28:25.915
Yes.

01:28:26.075 --> 01:28:26.596
Okay, yeah.

01:28:27.156 --> 01:28:28.377
And they didn't provide that with us.

01:28:28.457 --> 01:28:30.738
It looked like they used the whole grade span.

01:28:31.679 --> 01:28:34.681
So I... Okay.

01:28:34.821 --> 01:28:35.302
Yeah.

01:28:35.342 --> 01:28:35.502
Okay.

01:28:35.882 --> 01:28:36.322
Thank you.

01:28:38.524 --> 01:28:38.784
Okay.

01:28:39.004 --> 01:28:41.546
The moment where we need that set of answers.

01:28:41.906 --> 01:28:42.707
Shall we do that now?

01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:44.197
Yeah, that's probably it.

01:28:44.798 --> 01:28:57.584
I think it would be good to ask not only about the numbers of students in each grade level, but how you did in fact make the comparisons on the pages that are being referenced.

01:28:57.844 --> 01:29:04.828
Okay, so let me attempt to reiterate, because I am very confused about this data and about the comparisons.

01:29:05.328 --> 01:29:10.613
So let me attempt to reiterate for purposes of clarification what it is I'm seeking.

01:29:11.133 --> 01:29:25.905
I want to understand because I heard you clearly when you said you felt the comparisons were unfair, particularly because of the school sites the LAUSD selected with choosing schools that were magnet schools.

01:29:26.386 --> 01:29:32.431
You also made the point that the comparisons need to fairly look at grade spans of students.

01:29:32.931 --> 01:29:39.682
So I want to begin with the simplest one that will help me understand this best since I can see the information about the high schools.

01:29:40.062 --> 01:29:43.788
How many 11th grade students do you have enrolled at your school?

01:29:44.569 --> 01:29:47.033
We did it for three years, so it kind of moved, but it's approximately 60.

01:29:47.907 --> 01:30:07.995
Sixty so it may be it may have been a little higher one year a little bit lower But for your grade 11 scores, you're saying that you had about 60 students So in the chart that you gave us Can you go through and explain to me for your grade 11 students how they compared with the schools you selected?

01:30:08.776 --> 01:30:09.056
Thank you

01:30:10.257 --> 01:30:21.197
I want to emphasize that the data that is on the chart for the high school and the middle school is data that is directly exported from the LE Unified's open data dashboard.

01:30:22.252 --> 01:30:23.993
There are no changes to those numbers.

01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:32.157
The enrollment issue is confusing because they state the total enrollment for that center.

01:30:32.837 --> 01:30:38.260
Let me be specific, for that center, not for the school campus.

01:30:39.161 --> 01:30:45.304
I think what might help here is a school campus is issued a CDS school code.

01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:46.784
by the state.

01:30:47.905 --> 01:30:51.727
The magnet centers are subcomponents of that.

01:30:52.567 --> 01:31:01.391
So the issue here is that the CASP reporting system provides the scores for the entire CDS code.

01:31:01.952 --> 01:31:05.974
And if we look at, for example, Lincoln High School, it's the entire one.

01:31:06.534 --> 01:31:14.518
But what the uniqueness and the importance of the Open Data Dashboard from L-Unified is it says, here is the component that is not a magnet,

01:31:15.234 --> 01:31:18.895
And it tells you the enrollment for that subcomponent.

01:31:19.496 --> 01:31:22.297
And in this case, Lincoln has two magnet schools.

01:31:23.217 --> 01:31:35.562
Now, to make sure that you're doing an apples to apples comparison, which is what we are trying to get here, is if you add up the enrollment, the total enrollment for those magnet centers, then it matches.

01:31:36.806 --> 01:31:42.591
nearly matches the total enrollment for the CDS school that is reported in the CASP system.

01:31:43.352 --> 01:31:44.513
We did that verification.

01:31:45.854 --> 01:31:48.357
You do have to look at three things at the same time.

01:31:48.377 --> 01:31:49.938
The issue is that the CASP system

01:31:53.161 --> 01:31:59.084
only tells you the number of students tested per grade, it doesn't tell you the total enrollment for the school.

01:31:59.644 --> 01:32:03.906
In a high school, it doesn't include 9, 10 or 12.

01:32:04.506 --> 01:32:06.827
This is where you have to put two things together.

01:32:06.987 --> 01:32:08.748
It's not easy.

01:32:09.208 --> 01:32:12.430
The important part is that the LE unified system

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.273
does have the entire enrollment for the Magnet Center.

01:32:16.313 --> 01:32:20.438
That's how we were able to confirm, yeah, this is the correct disaggregation.

01:32:21.359 --> 01:32:23.060
So I wanted to point that piece out.

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.041
Maybe you have another question.

01:32:24.061 --> 01:32:32.630
Can you also clarify for us, since there were a lot of things that were said in the last session, how you represented the enrollment of your schools?

01:32:33.091 --> 01:32:35.173
Because that also was brought up.

01:32:35.615 --> 01:32:40.916
since we were trying to match what the L-Unified data was saying, apples to apples.

01:32:41.296 --> 01:32:45.597
So on that particular chart, it's correct that we're only showing the total enrollment.

01:32:47.357 --> 01:32:53.219
And that might have been an important clarification to say that for the high school, it's only 11th grade, which is about 60.

01:32:54.439 --> 01:32:59.340
And for the middle school, it's approximately 120, again, with variance across the years.

01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:03.122
And in that particular chart, it doesn't point that out.

01:33:03.462 --> 01:33:07.185
But I do need to, let me, if I can skip to the grade issue.

01:33:08.246 --> 01:33:12.829
So it's important to separate out 11th graders to 11th graders, and here's another challenge.

01:33:13.609 --> 01:33:23.116
The CASP system gives you scores for individual grades, but not for combinations of grades, unless it's the entire school.

01:33:23.997 --> 01:33:27.019
So for a middle school at LA Unified that's six through eight,

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:30.120
they have their entire score 6, 7, and 8.

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:31.600
But what about for us?

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:40.603
So we were able to take the scores for 6th, 7th, and 8th and match the methodology and get the combined score.

01:33:40.703 --> 01:33:41.263
It's an average.

01:33:41.703 --> 01:33:42.483
It's a straight average.

01:33:43.183 --> 01:33:54.206
So we're using our averaged 6, 7, and 8 score to compare apples to apples to LU Unified's non-magnet middle school scores.

01:33:54.947 --> 01:33:55.767
And when you do that,

01:33:57.429 --> 01:33:58.129
we look favorable.

01:33:58.390 --> 01:34:01.631
So this brought the other question of, how did we get to 69%?

01:34:02.452 --> 01:34:04.173
What's actually being counted here?

01:34:05.093 --> 01:34:06.114
If you look on that chart,

01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.412
Whatever is gray is not fair to compare.

01:34:11.472 --> 01:34:18.015
So there are eight schools, I think on the high school one, and we have three years that we're looking at.

01:34:18.795 --> 01:34:20.896
So eight times three is 24.

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:23.236
That's how we do it.

01:34:23.336 --> 01:34:28.178
Oh, I'm sorry, it's eight times six, because there's English language, three, and math, three.

01:34:28.618 --> 01:34:29.579
Six times eight, 48.

01:34:30.519 --> 01:34:36.501
How many times of those scores, the discrete apples to apples score,

01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:39.783
was our score better?

01:34:40.484 --> 01:34:42.105
And those are the ones that are coded green.

01:34:42.946 --> 01:34:47.350
You count them up and you get the universe of all and our number.

01:34:48.371 --> 01:34:54.618
Okay, I appreciate that detailed explanation, but what you just said is not what is shown in this chart.

01:34:54.638 --> 01:34:57.460
You said you had 60 students enrolled in grade 11.

01:34:57.941 --> 01:34:59.883
This chart says 391.

01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:04.451
That is the total enrollment for the school.

01:35:04.491 --> 01:35:07.433
You are correct.

01:35:08.174 --> 01:35:16.620
But you said grade 11 scores only and the chart says the total enrollment for your grade 11 scores only

01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.901
in 2019 is 391.

01:35:19.021 --> 01:35:19.962
It doesn't say 60.

01:35:20.142 --> 01:35:24.625
It says 357, 389, 391.

01:35:25.726 --> 01:35:26.827
That's why I'm confused.

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:27.627
I don't know.

01:35:28.007 --> 01:35:29.989
You said you disaggregated the scores.

01:35:30.269 --> 01:35:31.730
That's not what this chart says.

01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:34.652
It was saying they disaggregated the scores also for middle school.

01:35:35.172 --> 01:35:36.273
Right.

01:35:36.293 --> 01:35:37.514
That's not what this chart shows.

01:35:37.574 --> 01:35:38.314
So that's why I'm confused.

01:35:38.334 --> 01:35:39.735
What are you looking at, Patricia?

01:35:39.755 --> 01:35:40.456
This one.

01:35:40.556 --> 01:35:40.796
Yeah.

01:35:43.666 --> 01:35:45.147
What does the heading say on it?

01:35:45.167 --> 01:35:49.249
It says, of 54 fair non-magnet comparison.

01:35:49.649 --> 01:35:52.911
He was just talking about middle school, so I had switched to the middle school page.

01:35:52.931 --> 01:36:03.237
Yeah, so even between separating out middle school and high school, you have your 5 through 8 plus grade 11 scores, and then grade 11 scores only.

01:36:03.677 --> 01:36:06.398
You didn't separate that out in what you presented in the chart.

01:36:06.439 --> 01:36:08.420
That's why I'm a little confused.

01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:10.701
So let me ask a different question.

01:36:11.081 --> 01:36:21.164
So then when you go to the next set of columns, the ELA scores and the math scores, the ELA and the math scores that you have here, is that only for grade 11?

01:36:21.624 --> 01:36:23.164
Or is that the combined scores?

01:36:23.184 --> 01:36:23.384
Correct.

01:36:23.684 --> 01:36:24.385
It's only for 11.

01:36:24.605 --> 01:36:27.826
So that's for the 60 students in grade 11?

01:36:28.086 --> 01:36:28.446
Correct.

01:36:28.926 --> 01:36:29.226
Okay.

01:36:30.026 --> 01:36:31.768
And it was either or.

01:36:32.409 --> 01:36:39.556
Do I put another column that has the changing enrollment for the grade or do I put the total enrollment as it's reported in the CASP?

01:36:39.576 --> 01:36:41.038
What did you do?

01:36:41.158 --> 01:36:46.244
We chose the total enrollment because that's also what's being, but let me make sure it's clear.

01:36:46.944 --> 01:36:50.146
Though there's no calculations on the scores relative to enrollment.

01:36:50.426 --> 01:36:51.787
That's exactly what's reported.

01:36:51.827 --> 01:36:56.690
These are copied straight over So it's the enrollment numbers are strictly for reference.

01:36:57.370 --> 01:37:00.272
It doesn't impact the scores, right?

01:37:02.353 --> 01:37:10.998
So if I can just be sure that yes, I'm understanding the Second line on this high school page.

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:13.079
Yes reports

01:37:15.205 --> 01:37:21.110
the total enrollment of the school, but the scores for the 60 11th grade students, roughly.

01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:24.732
I think what you are mentioning is there are two lines for Avanza.

01:37:25.853 --> 01:37:30.137
The top one is the scores for the entire grade span, 6 through 11.

01:37:30.697 --> 01:37:33.459
That is what the CASP state reporting system puts out.

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:35.861
Our contention is, thank you, but

01:37:37.282 --> 01:37:41.004
not much we can do with that, because there's very few schools that are sixth through 11th.

01:37:41.184 --> 01:37:46.807
If we want to do a proper comparison, what are the scores only for the 11th graders?

01:37:47.387 --> 01:37:49.388
And I see your confusion point here about the enrollment.

01:37:49.448 --> 01:37:53.590
Actually, probably that enrollment number should have been on the line above, not in the blue.

01:37:55.231 --> 01:37:55.951
I can address that.

01:37:56.932 --> 01:37:59.853
But it is approximately 60 across those years.

01:38:00.353 --> 01:38:05.036
And those scores in blue are the scores only for the 11th graders, which matches

01:38:06.096 --> 01:38:13.477
All the other scores are only for 11th graders, because as we know, the SPAC score is only tested for 11th grade.

01:38:14.018 --> 01:38:20.699
And on the following page, you do the same thing for 6th through 8th only, right?

01:38:20.959 --> 01:38:22.079
One important caveat there.

01:38:22.879 --> 01:38:29.761
Those are the scores as reported in CASP for the entire school, because the school grade span is 6th through 8th.

01:38:30.601 --> 01:38:31.401
In our case,

01:38:32.826 --> 01:38:40.553
This number does have to be calculated, and it's calculated as an average to get the span from 6, 7, and 8.

01:38:40.774 --> 01:38:43.576
And it's a simple calculation that's done from the CASP report.

01:38:45.058 --> 01:38:52.144
So only those six numbers in blue for this page, because of the grade span, are calculated.

01:38:52.164 --> 01:38:54.166
But it's a very simple average of the 6, 7, and 8 score.

01:38:55.370 --> 01:39:02.019
Just so everybody's following, the blue you can see on the color coded, but we have black and white here.

01:39:02.059 --> 01:39:03.300
I don't know if it's on your screen.

01:39:03.420 --> 01:39:04.742
It's on the screen.

01:39:04.802 --> 01:39:06.404
I just want to be sure everybody's following.

01:39:06.484 --> 01:39:08.867
So on the screen, you can see the colors he's referring to.

01:39:08.927 --> 01:39:10.710
And so the colors here are also showing.

01:39:11.465 --> 01:39:22.698
the purple which is the combined CDS coded CASP reported score which has embedded the magnet issues.

01:39:22.718 --> 01:39:24.480
This gets to the issue of the list.

01:39:31.644 --> 01:39:37.468
On October 15th, the list that LU Unified used was the residential comparisons only.

01:39:38.429 --> 01:39:46.414
And the methodology, because it wasn't addressed earlier, but it is in their report, is 10 or more students that attend a school.

01:39:46.494 --> 01:39:55.960
So they go back and look at our zip codes and our addresses, geocode, and any school that 10 or more of our students would have attended.

01:39:56.441 --> 01:39:58.902
So it's a proxy for proximity is what it is.

01:39:59.623 --> 01:40:01.184
That means they're not going to go very far away.

01:40:02.184 --> 01:40:02.925
looking at schools.

01:40:04.506 --> 01:40:17.552
The problem with that methodology though is, especially if you understand the Highland Park area and Board Member Strauss, if I can politely mention that there's Huntington Park and there's Highland Park.

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:23.275
Thank you, I just hope the transcript, I think that's what you meant.

01:40:25.234 --> 01:40:28.415
We are serving the highest need kids in the Highland Park area.

01:40:28.535 --> 01:40:34.736
Around us is Eagle Rock, Glass Hill Park, other neighborhoods that it is a different issue.

01:40:34.916 --> 01:40:41.138
We mentioned the criticism that they did not include the similar composition schools at LA Unified.

01:40:41.178 --> 01:40:47.380
In fact, in their report, they have a table and they have a line that says similar composition and then it is blank and there are no schools in there.

01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:48.500
So they only listed

01:40:49.140 --> 01:40:54.343
residential schools, of which most of them, or I think all of them, had magnet schools in them.

01:40:54.543 --> 01:40:55.324
That was problematic.

01:40:55.404 --> 01:40:56.965
But that was LA Unified, that was October.

01:40:57.005 --> 01:40:58.345
Let's fast forward to February.

01:40:59.306 --> 01:41:16.296
And for the ACCS meeting, the CDE used a different set of schools, but they now included another magnet, Washington Irving from Glassopart, kind of difficult, and they included Eagle Rock High School, also a little bit of a challenge.

01:41:18.982 --> 01:41:24.811
That inclusion of at least Eagle Rock got mentioned at the ACCS meeting by one of the commissioners.

01:41:25.271 --> 01:41:29.197
And so for the third set, it was not included.

01:41:29.978 --> 01:41:32.122
So what is the third set?

01:41:33.223 --> 01:41:34.806
Since October, we all unified.

01:41:36.328 --> 01:41:40.691
We felt it was important to have the similar composition schools, similar demographic schools.

01:41:41.392 --> 01:41:50.498
We did an analysis of all the schools in LA Unified, matching on subgroups, high Latinos index and high socioeconomically disadvantaged students.

01:41:50.638 --> 01:41:52.820
And by high, I mean like 90 plus, 95% the way our school is.

01:41:55.399 --> 01:41:57.501
And we presented that list to the district.

01:41:58.562 --> 01:41:59.703
It was ignored.

01:42:00.364 --> 01:42:02.065
And we presented that to the state.

01:42:02.906 --> 01:42:07.150
It does not show up in the ACCS analysis.

01:42:07.690 --> 01:42:10.973
But it does show up, thankfully, in the SBE analysis.

01:42:11.273 --> 01:42:16.618
And so the list that is in front of you for this meeting is the composition of

01:42:18.954 --> 01:42:26.001
our suggested similar composition schools, which they included, and the residential schools.

01:42:26.622 --> 01:42:27.723
It is a much better list.

01:42:28.464 --> 01:42:29.885
So at least we kind of got past that.

01:42:30.426 --> 01:42:33.329
But now let's step back to the other problem.

01:42:35.031 --> 01:42:42.258
Now that we have identified which schools we're going to look at, if the scores that you're pulling for those schools is coming from the CASP report,

01:42:43.134 --> 01:42:46.475
you have magnet data in there, and you have grade span issues in there.

01:42:47.055 --> 01:42:50.876
This is why it is important to look for disaggregated data.

01:42:51.056 --> 01:42:54.457
Maybe not all districts have it, but LE Unified does.

01:42:55.097 --> 01:42:58.438
We only discovered this data set like three weeks ago.

01:42:58.898 --> 01:43:02.239
We believe it only kind of came online in the fall.

01:43:02.899 --> 01:43:05.140
But our point is, this is an important

01:43:06.285 --> 01:43:17.474
differentiation, disaggregation, it is a critique that we have been constant in providing and so we present this and I hope my clarification on the methodology helps.

01:43:17.895 --> 01:43:19.056
But my last point is

01:43:20.029 --> 01:43:28.532
Now you see the green points do show that we compare favorably in a fair comparison in terms of high schools and middle schools.

01:43:29.092 --> 01:43:34.034
And we think it's unfortunate that Dr. Perry at the ACSS meeting made the statement.

01:43:34.194 --> 01:43:37.996
He agreed with our logic that grade span and magnets should not be included.

01:43:38.056 --> 01:43:39.096
He agreed with the logic.

01:43:39.756 --> 01:43:42.918
But he also asserted that their data didn't have that.

01:43:43.578 --> 01:43:47.039
As of this week, Dr. Perry now is saying, no, Ricardo, you're right.

01:43:47.579 --> 01:43:49.300
And this methodology is the better one.

01:43:51.163 --> 01:44:02.547
Can I come back to Member Rucker and ask Member Sun and Member Pagalanan to get their questions in and then thank you for asking the questions that got us to this clarification and then we'll keep plugging away.

01:44:03.728 --> 01:44:04.208
Member Sun.

01:44:06.697 --> 01:44:07.658
Thank you so much.

01:44:07.698 --> 01:44:13.380
I think the questions of my colleagues and Mr. Morales, your explanation was extremely helpful here.

01:44:13.961 --> 01:44:18.603
So there's two other pieces helpful in getting to the story behind the numbers.

01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:33.630
There's another piece too, and I wonder if Academia Advance has that, around students who have been with the school, because I know that you may have students who come in and out or they come to you extremely

01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:36.833
disadvantage you know behind in grade level.

01:44:37.253 --> 01:44:49.465
Do you have growth data for the lack of you know better word and this is part Carson back to our conversation yesterday without something statewide you know what are you using to show that?

01:44:50.166 --> 01:44:56.953
Let me warn you that this was a significant component of the ACCS meeting in terms of

01:44:58.753 --> 01:45:07.782
And I think it's a recognition that at the state level, unfortunately, there is not a CDE agreed kind of growth metric.

01:45:09.044 --> 01:45:17.112
Either you go with something that relies on student level aggregation, student level data, which is, you can't compare school to school.

01:45:17.132 --> 01:45:21.436
I mean, we can give you our student level information, but we don't have access to other schools.

01:45:22.444 --> 01:45:31.459
Or you can go to the grade-to-grade comparison, which we did provide to LUnified in October, and we also provided it to the ACCS.

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.887
And we can even provide it today, but I was hesitant, given the following critique.

01:45:37.262 --> 01:45:40.043
It's true, those aren't necessarily the same kids.

01:45:40.303 --> 01:45:44.444
So if you're saying two years ago here they were sixth grade, here they're eighth grade, maybe those aren't the same kids.

01:45:44.684 --> 01:45:45.685
Yes, that's true.

01:45:46.845 --> 01:45:49.026
But how else can we do a great comparison?

01:45:49.106 --> 01:45:52.767
So to your specific question, I would turn you to the slide that I put up here.

01:45:53.247 --> 01:45:54.768
Which is the NWA map data?

01:45:54.788 --> 01:45:56.748
Now that's a whole nother criticism.

01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:59.569
Not all the schools are using NWA map data.

01:46:00.090 --> 01:46:02.610
However, they do have a national norm.

01:46:03.971 --> 01:46:04.271
And so,

01:46:04.758 --> 01:46:07.519
The brown line on this chart is the national norm.

01:46:08.419 --> 01:46:14.342
And this data does bias to the students that stay with us over the course of the years.

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:19.824
And what we clearly see here is, first off, there's no skimming going on here.

01:46:20.664 --> 01:46:26.126
If you compare to the national norm, the lower grades, the sixth and eighth graders, have a significant gap.

01:46:28.616 --> 01:46:46.067
Over time, and this is four years worth of data for the end of the year, they keep, as an average for the whole grade, the score is moving up, such that by the 11th grade, we're getting to the norm.

01:46:47.388 --> 01:46:55.373
That we offer is evidence and that shows that over time, the students that stay with us are growing.

01:46:55.413 --> 01:46:57.414
And it also explains the issues about, well,

01:46:58.024 --> 01:46:59.686
How are you getting all these kids into college?

01:47:00.386 --> 01:47:08.994
Hey, if you're staying with us, and you do our academic program, and you do our life program, you're gonna have a high probability of going to college.

01:47:09.815 --> 01:47:16.161
What other explanation can I put in here, though, that's difficult to see, but I think is understandable, especially the comments from Board Member Strauss?

01:47:18.383 --> 01:47:20.565
Our community, this is the immigrant community.

01:47:21.652 --> 01:47:29.115
And so very highly influx, especially at the high school level, we're getting kids in the 10th, 11th, even seniors.

01:47:30.636 --> 01:47:39.459
We have one case of a student came to the 10th grade, had to spend three months in a Houston, some people call them cages, but in a Houston ICE detention center.

01:47:39.819 --> 01:47:45.342
So it was gonna take him at least a year just to get past that experience to start to focus.

01:47:45.382 --> 01:47:46.222
I'm happy to report

01:47:46.892 --> 01:47:50.508
that he's well on his way to graduating and he's well on his way to getting into a college.

01:47:52.381 --> 01:47:53.822
We're not turning those kids away.

01:47:54.282 --> 01:48:08.649
They are a significant component of, or there's even another way, and I think if you knew who this last speaker was, the gentleman with the Dodgers shirt, that's Romulo Avelica.

01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:16.773
His family came in front of this board to speak about the separation for six months, given his ICE detention.

01:48:17.634 --> 01:48:19.655
He has two daughters that are in the school right now.

01:48:20.936 --> 01:48:22.998
That's a huge disruption, right?

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:29.163
So maybe they were with us since the sixth and seventh grade, but definitely during the eighth and ninth grade, there was some other focus going on there.

01:48:29.263 --> 01:48:31.585
I'm happy to report that the eldest is a junior.

01:48:31.645 --> 01:48:45.397
She's doing very well on her grades, on track to finishing AG, and she's determined to go to college like her two cousins, one who graduated last year from UC San Diego and has a great mentorship in the medical field,

01:48:46.689 --> 01:48:57.517
and her sister, who is now a junior at USC, having completed her internship in Washington with Congressman Jimmy Gomez, and is now working on staff for Ilda Solis.

01:48:59.058 --> 01:49:02.080
I think I'm going a bit long there.

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.842
My point is, you asked, is there any kind of evidence of growth?

01:49:05.922 --> 01:49:08.344
We offer this data set with all those caveats.

01:49:08.924 --> 01:49:10.726
We have other data sets that show

01:49:11.874 --> 01:49:19.698
that hey, sixth to eighth grade, there's huge gains, more so than the magnet school programs around us.

01:49:20.118 --> 01:49:29.803
They're at a higher level, but we're showing the growth, and as the point that Mr. Premax said, it's about the growth that is the emphasis in the renewal criteria.

01:49:31.701 --> 01:49:32.022
Thank you.

01:49:32.482 --> 01:49:39.954
Can I also now ask about the differentiated assistance and this may be the CSEE?

01:49:39.975 --> 01:49:42.178
Yes, I think that's somebody else.

01:49:42.278 --> 01:49:44.261
Thank you for that explanation as well.

01:49:48.151 --> 01:49:48.651
Good morning.

01:49:48.792 --> 01:49:52.074
Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.

01:49:52.875 --> 01:50:05.024
This was the first year that the Department of Education was required to identify charter schools under the differentiated assistance criteria under LCFF because they had additional years that were required.

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:06.646
When we conducted our

01:50:08.507 --> 01:50:12.569
analysis of the data and put out a public file, we had 32 charters on that list.

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:25.454
We were made aware, actually by one of the charters, that we had treated our academic indicator differently in our data processing than we had for districts.

01:50:25.514 --> 01:50:28.535
And so what the criteria is is that you treat it as one.

01:50:28.875 --> 01:50:32.837
It has to be red or orange on one of the indicators.

01:50:33.497 --> 01:50:39.520
And so in going back, reprocessing the data, there were nine schools that fell out as a result.

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:42.041
One of them was the school before you today.

01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:54.547
So we have notified all of those schools that the correction of the data and that the error was on the department's part and that they are no longer eligible for different jaded assistance under the criteria that is in law.

01:50:56.243 --> 01:50:57.884
So that was just a technical glitch?

01:50:58.364 --> 01:50:59.065
Technical glitch.

01:50:59.185 --> 01:51:01.266
It was, you know, sometimes we make mistakes.

01:51:01.486 --> 01:51:03.467
And when we make mistakes, we own up to it.

01:51:03.487 --> 01:51:07.189
So that unfortunately... Can you give me the number again?

01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:10.671
How many charter schools originally identified and then how many left after?

01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:11.151
Sure.

01:51:11.271 --> 01:51:14.713
So there was 32 originally identified and we removed nine.

01:51:15.053 --> 01:51:15.193
Okay.

01:51:15.553 --> 01:51:15.933
Thank you.

01:51:16.114 --> 01:51:16.334
We're at 23.

01:51:22.559 --> 01:51:24.463
trying to get into this conversation.

01:51:24.924 --> 01:51:27.629
Member Rucker did you want to return to a different question?

01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:31.979
I had a different I wanted to speak again to the representative from Avance.

01:51:38.755 --> 01:51:46.599
So first of all, I want to thank you for your patience in answering my question to clarify exactly what's represented on your chart.

01:51:47.179 --> 01:52:02.427
And so, based on your explanation that the first chart on the CASP high school comparisons and the chart on the flip side of the middle school comparisons, you said that there was a high percentage of your schools

01:52:03.067 --> 01:52:09.492
that outperformed the non-magnet schools that are on this chart.

01:52:10.193 --> 01:52:24.005
Based on what you explained to me, I then went back through these charts to make sure I understood the comparisons that you cited for the non-magnet schools and I don't find your assertion is accurate.

01:52:24.805 --> 01:52:28.607
And I'm just looking at the 2019 ELA scores.

01:52:29.147 --> 01:52:31.929
You said that you outperformed the non-magnet schools.

01:52:31.989 --> 01:52:35.671
Just for the ELA SBAC scores in 2019, you had, for the grade 11 scores, 36.7.

01:52:36.011 --> 01:52:40.813
And I found that for Benjamin Franklin High School, for Edward Roybal Learning Center,

01:52:54.864 --> 01:53:09.540
Miguel Contreras Learning Center, for their Social Justice School, the Nava Preparatory School, the Woodrow Wilson Senior High School, they all outperformed your program and that's just the non-magnet programs.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.882
Those are the ones.

01:53:11.942 --> 01:53:14.004
No, this says no magnet.

01:53:14.405 --> 01:53:16.327
It says next to that, no magnet.

01:53:16.707 --> 01:53:19.588
Nava Preparatory Academy is a no-magnet school.

01:53:19.968 --> 01:53:22.309
Their SBAC scores were 38.2.

01:53:22.770 --> 01:53:23.510
Your scores were 36.7.

01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:34.114
So unless you made a mistake in designating Nava College Preparatory as a no-magnet school, I don't think I misread the chart.

01:53:34.514 --> 01:53:38.056
So I think there is a problem with the data.

01:53:38.116 --> 01:53:45.559
If I'm understanding what you said, we do have a problem with the data, but we also have a problem with understanding

01:53:46.019 --> 01:53:57.362
what the actual numbers are that are being reported about your students and just based on the data you turned in, you're not outperforming even the non-magnet schools at the numbers that you asserted.

01:54:01.544 --> 01:54:04.084
Maybe this has to do with the black and white versus the color.

01:54:06.045 --> 01:54:09.866
Because you have to see that there's green versus gray versus white.

01:54:10.006 --> 01:54:11.486
White is where we're not better.

01:54:12.107 --> 01:54:13.307
Green is where we are better.

01:54:13.860 --> 01:54:15.681
And gray is where it's not fair to compare.

01:54:15.701 --> 01:54:21.082
Yeah, I only have black and white.

01:54:21.763 --> 01:54:23.023
I only have black and white.

01:54:23.043 --> 01:54:29.205
And for Miguel Contreras Learning Center, and you do have that in cut, you have it as a colored box on your screen.

01:54:29.685 --> 01:54:33.127
But on my chart, it says in 2019 for ELA, your SBAC scores for grade 11 were 36.7.

01:54:33.287 --> 01:54:36.528
And for Miguel Contreras Leadership Community,

01:54:43.530 --> 01:54:47.957
It was 46.4 and for the School of Social Justice, 34.4.

01:54:49.359 --> 01:54:51.061
That's not a significant difference in...

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:52.832
for 2019.

01:54:53.312 --> 01:55:00.494
I'm just looking at the correct year but that example is explaining the the and these are primary centers.

01:55:00.794 --> 01:55:07.156
These are not magnet centers and the school of social justice has 34.4 compared to our 36.7.

01:55:07.476 --> 01:55:14.538
So that's not a significant difference in 2019 and your scores actually went down in 2017 it was 46.6 and 2019 is 34.4.

01:55:14.598 --> 01:55:15.798
That's not trending the correct way.

01:55:22.621 --> 01:55:33.892
Despite the fact that you want to tell me that there is a two-point difference between your performance as a school in grade 11 and this school, you are not trending the correct way.

01:55:33.932 --> 01:55:34.712
You went from 56.2% down to 36.7%.

01:55:34.753 --> 01:55:36.274
That is a 20-point drop.

01:55:36.314 --> 01:55:39.117
I understand why you want to say you are outperforming.

01:55:46.684 --> 01:55:51.586
It was a 20 point drop over those three years that is being reported.

01:55:52.046 --> 01:55:58.908
That is not what you want to be proud of and say we are still outperforming the other magnet school by two points.

01:55:58.928 --> 01:56:00.469
Do you see what I am concerned about?

01:56:01.909 --> 01:56:04.752
I think you will see there's a trend downward on all of these.

01:56:05.112 --> 01:56:09.416
But you're the one who's saying you're outperforming the schools.

01:56:09.696 --> 01:56:12.038
I think the measure is equal to or better.

01:56:12.578 --> 01:56:17.162
But you're the one who said... Let's sort out two things that you're talking about.

01:56:17.543 --> 01:56:21.066
One is you're talking about a trend over time, which we can ask you to talk about.

01:56:21.726 --> 01:56:24.229
The other is the comparison for 2019 between and among

01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:49.815
Or for any given year between and among school well There's a third point over the three years that are being shown their scores are trending in the wrong direction The first point I was raising was the trend so I just want to ask you to separately respond to the question about the trend and then the Comparisons on a given year so that we can at least keep the issues separate

01:56:52.609 --> 01:56:55.051
Obviously, it's a concern for us to address this.

01:56:55.271 --> 01:57:06.579
And we wanted to show evidence that in this particular year, and with the guidance from the CDE staff, Mr. Huddleston has been a great support for us to find, hey, how are you addressing these?

01:57:06.619 --> 01:57:08.220
How are you reflecting on the data?

01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.603
And we have evidence that for this year, but obviously that's not being shown in this chart.

01:57:13.523 --> 01:57:15.705
We did recognize that downward trend.

01:57:16.045 --> 01:57:20.488
There is also the same caveat that I provided before in terms of the growth data.

01:57:21.128 --> 01:57:24.670
These are different classes, every year is different, and the test is different.

01:57:25.191 --> 01:57:31.254
And if we were out of sequence with the trends for the other schools, then that would require a different explanation.

01:57:31.654 --> 01:57:39.339
But for that same school that you point to, board member, they went from 34, but they started also at 46 for the English.

01:57:39.399 --> 01:57:41.900
So the trends impact everybody.

01:57:42.140 --> 01:57:46.263
And this particular test, though, is equal to, we're not saying we're

01:57:46.963 --> 01:57:47.463
were better.

01:57:47.483 --> 01:57:52.125
I made absolutely sure that it was an exact match or not.

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:57.126
There are a couple of other places where we are off by one or two in our favor.

01:57:58.166 --> 01:58:00.087
Let's just go straight up.

01:58:00.187 --> 01:58:01.688
Equal to is green.

01:58:03.408 --> 01:58:06.089
As a collection, overall, when you look at all of these comparison points,

01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:19.630
With all of those controls that I said that make this fair in terms of grade span and magnet centers, overall, the picture emerges that we're doing pretty good here, right?

01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:30.473
It's difficult if we're being compared to magnet schools, but if you're comparing us to the non-magnet schools that have a similar composition like these gold schools, then overall, we're doing okay.

01:58:31.213 --> 01:58:32.093
Now, can we do better?

01:58:32.173 --> 01:58:33.994
Absolutely, and we want to work with the state to do that.

01:58:34.014 --> 01:58:36.535
Right, so this will be the only thing I'll say and I'll be done.

01:58:36.995 --> 01:58:38.816
You did say you were doing better.

01:58:38.856 --> 01:58:42.397
You did absolutely say you were doing better.

01:58:43.758 --> 01:58:50.264
With the explanation you gave me and the time that was taken for the other board members to ask questions, I went back through the chart.

01:58:51.325 --> 01:58:56.810
The trend is going the wrong direction and the trend is uneven between English language arts and math.

01:58:57.811 --> 01:59:02.516
I agree your grade 11 scores can be different from year to year because it is a different class.

01:59:02.936 --> 01:59:15.046
But then if I go back through the students in grades six through eight who are moving in to that grade 11, those scores also don't trend well and the performance is uneven from year to year.

01:59:15.406 --> 01:59:17.547
So I understand the point you're trying to make.

01:59:17.888 --> 01:59:24.033
You're saying we're doing well, but what you're saying is we're not failing as badly as the schools we want you to compare us to.

01:59:24.673 --> 01:59:30.778
That's really not a good way to justify what it is your program is doing and being successful.

01:59:31.438 --> 01:59:33.339
I'll just insert one point of clarification.

01:59:33.639 --> 01:59:37.180
The term is equal to or better, is that strictly what is in the law?

01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:39.381
I just pulled that code out.

01:59:39.461 --> 01:59:42.142
It is not so much an assessment.

01:59:42.182 --> 01:59:49.945
My point is, given the explanation you gave me to help me understand what this data represents, I don't see where it is equal to or better.

01:59:50.705 --> 02:00:13.481
And again, I think your explanation helped me understand better and I don't see where it's equal to or better just based on how and I might and I'm going to admit I might still not quite understand what you're what you're trying to compare in this chart But you're not equal to or better Based on how you explain this chart who it is the students are that are represented in these two charts

02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:17.692
Okay, so we've got the data questions.

02:00:18.012 --> 02:00:23.996
I just want to summarize what I think I've heard about the data, because there's been these questions.

02:00:24.997 --> 02:00:33.603
I think it's important for people to look, because this black and white doesn't help us, just so that we're clear.

02:00:34.363 --> 02:00:36.825
You're saying on these charts that

02:00:38.456 --> 02:00:50.287
In general, and I can see this is true for the 11th grade comparisons, that almost all the schools show a decline from 2017 to 2018 to 2019.

02:00:56.459 --> 02:01:02.240
You're comparing them in any given year to other schools that are non-magnets.

02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:07.241
Those in white are doing better than Avancé.

02:01:07.821 --> 02:01:11.022
Those in green are doing equivalent or worse.

02:01:11.402 --> 02:01:15.203
Those in gray are, in your view, not comparable because they are magnets.

02:01:15.643 --> 02:01:16.143
Is that right?

02:01:16.843 --> 02:01:25.225
And then the other charts that we looked at a few moments ago, which were map scores, are the same students over time.

02:01:26.446 --> 02:01:34.976
9th and 6 7 8 now that may be where we need a little more explanation

02:01:36.044 --> 02:01:39.167
It's the same where for that corresponding year.

02:01:39.327 --> 02:01:44.991
I mean obviously older students are popping off, newer students are coming in, so it's not an exact cohort analysis.

02:01:45.011 --> 02:01:49.115
And it's all of the students in the school that are being measured.

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:51.657
It is for grades 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.

02:01:51.997 --> 02:01:55.520
And this is another significant that this tool lets us do 9th and 10th.

02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:58.522
And it's all the students in the school who were there

02:01:59.643 --> 02:02:01.285
who were also there a year earlier?

02:02:01.305 --> 02:02:01.726
Yes.

02:02:02.006 --> 02:02:08.775
So it's the gain that they made from your, time one to time two for all the students in the school, okay.

02:02:08.955 --> 02:02:11.738
Just so that people know what we're looking at with the different charts.

02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:14.882
Are there any other questions?

02:02:16.003 --> 02:02:34.071
Just maybe just maybe a comment, you know, I do agree that the the trending down is concerning but what is More concerning more on a larger policy level is the training down for all of these similar composition schools and while I understand board member Rutgers point

02:02:34.931 --> 02:02:38.875
It's amazing to me how charters always shine a light on the system.

02:02:39.496 --> 02:02:52.329
So I have actually larger questions now by doing this type of analysis, what is happening with some of our student populations and the performance and these types of schools with certain populations.

02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:53.711
So that's just a comment.

02:02:55.773 --> 02:02:57.875
Yeah, it's concerning actually statewide.

02:03:04.895 --> 02:03:07.456
Whoever made that possible, thank you.

02:03:07.576 --> 02:03:19.940
One of the things that we are up to our eyeballs in are the differences between progress data and growth data, which is something we're going to revisit in May when we come back to the growth model.

02:03:20.721 --> 02:03:29.464
Because from year to year, one group of 11th graders looks different than another group of 11th graders, and that's what we're currently measuring on the dashboard.

02:03:29.904 --> 02:03:32.245
But there may be a different group of 11th graders.

02:03:34.606 --> 02:03:37.747
And then the test may be different as well.

02:03:37.807 --> 02:03:39.288
I mean, that was mentioned.

02:03:39.308 --> 02:03:43.830
And when you see those kinds of things, the same thing happened on the NAEP this year.

02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:51.374
The whole country went down in reading on the NAEP, and it caused many people to say, what happened with the test?

02:03:51.434 --> 02:03:56.056
Maybe the test was incomparable to the test the previous year.

02:03:56.516 --> 02:04:01.418
So you don't know how to sort that out when you see those general trends downward.

02:04:03.154 --> 02:04:05.615
That's a whole nother psychometric issue, right?

02:04:05.955 --> 02:04:12.017
But this chart is looking at the growth of kids who are there at time one and time two and what happened to them.

02:04:12.518 --> 02:04:17.219
This other chart is looking at kids in different cohorts coming into the same grade level.

02:04:17.259 --> 02:04:18.920
So they're gonna tell a different story.

02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.821
I just wanted to be sure that we were...

02:04:22.001 --> 02:04:24.562
clear about what story, which data we're telling us.

02:04:25.362 --> 02:04:48.592
And I think the argument for a growth metric that we have been struggling with and will struggle with some more is that when you're measuring a school and its contribution to student learning, you do care about where that student was at an earlier time versus where that student ends up, which is just a different metric than the cohort metric.

02:04:49.716 --> 02:04:57.201
Okay, member Navo, and then I'm going to try to move us towards some kind of a motion and a process, but no, you go right ahead.

02:04:59.963 --> 02:05:06.187
I apologize for leaving and I may have missed the questions that I'm going to ask.

02:05:06.807 --> 02:05:09.829
I have two questions for you, and I think that

02:05:11.767 --> 02:05:18.113
I watched the ACC, the Charter Advisory Commission meeting, and I heard a lot of talk about enrollment.

02:05:19.574 --> 02:05:21.435
I heard a lot of talk about funding as well.

02:05:21.535 --> 02:05:22.576
So my questions are this.

02:05:24.098 --> 02:05:24.938
There's a trend here.

02:05:25.219 --> 02:05:31.484
In 2005, you were authorized by LAUSD, and then they requested a non-renewal.

02:05:32.505 --> 02:05:37.249
Then LA County Office of Ed authorizes you in 2010 and requests a non-renewal.

02:05:38.285 --> 02:05:44.007
The state board then authorizes you in 2015 and then requests a non-renewal today.

02:05:45.428 --> 02:05:45.808
The staff.

02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:55.692
There's a trend and I'm struggling to find out what you can do to change this trend.

02:05:56.513 --> 02:05:59.194
If we were to, you know, recommend some type of

02:06:00.799 --> 02:06:04.043
conditions, we're bucking the system.

02:06:04.103 --> 02:06:06.626
The system is telling us, this is not working.

02:06:06.686 --> 02:06:09.609
You're dealing in year 15 with year one financial issues.

02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:14.054
If I understand the receivables correctly, you're selling ADA basically to pay.

02:06:15.396 --> 02:06:16.457
You're banking on ADA.

02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:19.160
OK.

02:06:19.721 --> 02:06:21.543
So my issue is enrollment.

02:06:22.412 --> 02:06:26.816
I did not hear about the 100 new students in the charter school meeting.

02:06:27.376 --> 02:06:32.921
I'm interested in where those came from, because you had articulated in that meeting enrollment was declining in your area.

02:06:32.981 --> 02:06:35.362
Obviously, it was a tough area, and declining all around.

02:06:35.903 --> 02:06:40.206
So between the charter school meeting and today, there's two binders full of 100 new students.

02:06:40.547 --> 02:06:42.148
So that would be my first question.

02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:45.190
And the second one is about funding.

02:06:47.052 --> 02:06:47.812
Let me see if I can.

02:06:48.533 --> 02:06:51.976
How are you going to make the bottom line 15 years into this thing now?

02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:53.491
And it goes into enrollment.

02:06:56.214 --> 02:07:00.297
For the first three years of this current charter, we stayed constant at 390.

02:07:02.399 --> 02:07:11.007
So the issue is, in this particular year, and there are two parts to that, why was there a particular drop for this particular year?

02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:15.701
One is, I think, the cloud of renewal.

02:07:16.502 --> 02:07:19.362
We had hoped to be approved by October.

02:07:20.343 --> 02:07:24.524
That cloud is, and I think we're gonna, I will get to how I think we've addressed that.

02:07:25.564 --> 02:07:35.868
The second one is just the reality of this presidency and the impact to the immigrant families of which is a huge component of our families and the gentrification which is mentioned by Assemblymember Wendy Carrillo.

02:07:36.488 --> 02:07:40.650
has hit very, very hard in this particular year where families are leaving.

02:07:41.171 --> 02:07:42.291
So this has been a challenge.

02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:44.112
How have we addressed that challenge?

02:07:44.352 --> 02:07:46.493
Where did all of these interests come from?

02:07:47.054 --> 02:07:53.097
We tried a different strategy this year and worked with a professional recruiting group, who you heard from, Mr. Pacheco.

02:07:53.437 --> 02:07:59.700
But the difference was in pairing off the professionals with our parents and our students.

02:08:00.261 --> 02:08:02.362
And that kind of pairing we had not done before.

02:08:02.782 --> 02:08:03.883
Why didn't you try this before?

02:08:04.263 --> 02:08:04.883
Well, we did now.

02:08:05.183 --> 02:08:06.985
And February is an important month.

02:08:07.565 --> 02:08:10.907
People in December and January are still kind of focused elsewhere.

02:08:11.067 --> 02:08:15.910
February is when you can really attract, in our neighborhood, attention for our school.

02:08:16.670 --> 02:08:22.774
And so we were at the right time with the right strategy, and we had a huge interest that we were able to attract.

02:08:23.214 --> 02:08:24.375
And I think it's demonstrated.

02:08:24.435 --> 02:08:28.577
So the point is that the budget at 350

02:08:31.118 --> 02:08:36.502
for all five years is recognizing we're still going to have to deal with the demographic and economic pressures on our community.

02:08:37.123 --> 02:08:40.305
But we believe we can attract at that level.

02:08:40.906 --> 02:08:45.310
And the fact that we were able to do that in these last six weeks is evidence of that.

02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:47.852
We didn't get 1,000 interest.

02:08:48.112 --> 02:08:49.713
That would have been like, wait, where's that coming from?

02:08:50.734 --> 02:08:53.976
And the actual number is 150 new student attraction.

02:08:54.597 --> 02:08:57.459
That puts us in a good sweet spot in terms of our budget.

02:08:57.519 --> 02:08:58.900
So now let me get to this story.

02:08:59.461 --> 02:09:00.642
There's actually a longer story.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:11.742
El Unified gave us a three-year charter, and there was a direct attack on the school in the third year, which we backed it away.

02:09:12.222 --> 02:09:15.843
Then they gave us a one-year extension, then they gave us a one-year extension.

02:09:16.623 --> 02:09:20.484
So that put us under a huge cloud in that whole first five-year period.

02:09:20.884 --> 02:09:31.246
And to be specific, the fifth year under El Unified, we had to take them to court in order to act appropriately on our renewal consideration because they were running out the clock.

02:09:32.132 --> 02:09:36.316
And the judge agreed, and the court, the judicial action worked in our favor.

02:09:37.237 --> 02:09:41.261
We went to the county, and we won at the county level.

02:09:42.182 --> 02:09:47.747
Fast forward, and again, where it's important, it was a no action vote at the county.

02:09:48.370 --> 02:09:49.391
It was a 3-3.

02:09:49.771 --> 02:09:50.652
They didn't decline us.

02:09:50.912 --> 02:09:51.773
They didn't renew us.

02:09:52.714 --> 02:09:55.836
So that kind of leads, hey, maybe there's some other political pressures happening here.

02:09:56.617 --> 02:09:57.998
Fast forward another five years.

02:09:58.519 --> 02:10:01.141
And here's a very simple number.

02:10:01.761 --> 02:10:05.324
45 schools were seeking renewal last fall.

02:10:05.344 --> 02:10:06.646
44 schools.

02:10:08.527 --> 02:10:10.391
got the recommendation from LA Unified.

02:10:10.892 --> 02:10:11.594
How can it be?

02:10:12.495 --> 02:10:18.728
Even since we're the top three school in terms of getting students to college, how can we be dead last 45th?

02:10:20.168 --> 02:10:24.029
Maybe there's something else going on there this last fall with LA Unified.

02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:33.071
For a whole nother explanation, I can talk about the SELPA issue and the fact that we were the only school that declared we were not going to join their SELPA.

02:10:33.691 --> 02:10:36.951
But that is a whole nother explanation.

02:10:36.991 --> 02:10:40.632
But my point is, people keep pointing to, hey, you've been around for 15 years.

02:10:40.972 --> 02:10:42.192
How come it's been so hard?

02:10:42.613 --> 02:10:45.233
Because it's been so hard where we are.

02:10:45.313 --> 02:10:48.634
We're in an area that is very, very hard against charter schools.

02:10:50.214 --> 02:11:08.652
I believe, given that this last month was able to show that we can attract students, we have the program that attracts our families, we have what these families want in terms of getting their kids to college, and so we have a square budget in terms of we're not trying to over enroll.

02:11:09.993 --> 02:11:11.074
Let me put a footnote there.

02:11:11.274 --> 02:11:12.395
How come you claim 600 students

02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:25.845
That was the claim from 2015, when we first submitted our charter to the county, because we were going to construct a new building and gain that facility.

02:11:25.905 --> 02:11:32.448
Now, because that construction fell through, and that was the partnership with City Terrace LLC, it was a partnership to build a new school.

02:11:33.368 --> 02:11:38.390
When the city was going to decline that project, then we got out of that project.

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:42.092
But we had presented to the county, we believe we're gonna have this capacity.

02:11:42.632 --> 02:11:47.714
In the current charter that we're finishing with the state, we didn't include that big number.

02:11:48.514 --> 02:11:51.055
And so I think that's looking way, way back.

02:11:51.795 --> 02:12:00.238
And this current petition, it has the words from the CDE, has a viable plan going forward.

02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:08.884
The short answer is we are attracting those students and those binders are evidence of that.

02:12:08.984 --> 02:12:24.695
We are not trying to do an outlandish number and not having a cloud over us and having the enrollment numbers that we have now and having addressed the condition that was put on us where we had to write off $1.6 million, we don't have that this time.

02:12:25.824 --> 02:12:38.472
So I believe we are in the right place to deliver and the data that this year is showing, the data that the CDE has been monitoring and helping us with shows that we are going to start on the right foot this time.

02:12:42.475 --> 02:12:51.501
Member Byrd, did you, speaking of conditions, did you want to speak to the comment you made earlier about what conditions you would be recommending?

02:12:51.521 --> 02:12:56.725
So I'm going to hand these out while I make a couple of comments on that so everybody has a chance to take a look at them.

02:12:58.426 --> 02:13:01.628
I just want to start with a couple things.

02:13:01.708 --> 02:13:11.755
First of all, I do appreciate the real deep dive into the numbers, but I think that it underscored what I previewed yesterday of how desperately we need a growth model.

02:13:12.615 --> 02:13:29.511
And particularly for a school like this one, you've heard lots of the challenges, different grade configurations, six to 12, which is a little bit unusual, and both a population that has been underserved, but is also a challenging population in the sense that it's fairly transitory.

02:13:30.151 --> 02:13:36.373
So I think when you look from year to year, it's very hard to tell whether those are the same students that you're seeing each year.

02:13:36.473 --> 02:13:38.114
And I appreciate you pointing that out.

02:13:38.694 --> 02:13:50.138
The other thing I want to say is that just to refresh people's memory about what the criteria are for our approval is that the primary consideration is supposed to be academic performance.

02:13:50.218 --> 02:13:52.459
And we've done a lot of delving into that.

02:13:52.999 --> 02:13:59.542
But we are also allowed to, and indeed I think are compelled to look at alternative measures.

02:14:00.062 --> 02:14:05.845
And with this school, I want to refresh our memory back to the beginning of Stephanie's presentation.

02:14:06.445 --> 02:14:10.367
If you look at her slides, and this is slide number nine on page five.

02:14:11.167 --> 02:14:25.294
that the school itself is a college preparatory school with the goal to ensure that all pupils complete A to G requirements, graduate, are equipped to be accepted into colleges and universities, and have the opportunity to develop into active citizens.

02:14:25.975 --> 02:14:36.380
And I think if you look at those measures, by those measures, which we spent a little bit of time on, and we spent a whole bunch of time on test scores, which I would suggest maybe we should have flipped it,

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:40.424
They are highly successful, and you heard that from their alums.

02:14:40.504 --> 02:14:45.388
So I really want you to hold that in your mind, if you will.

02:14:46.449 --> 02:14:50.533
And just a couple of other sort of overarching comments.

02:14:50.593 --> 02:14:55.318
As I mentioned, I think, at the beginning, the school has been in operation for 15 years.

02:14:56.599 --> 02:14:59.182
It has had rocky relationships.

02:14:59.242 --> 02:15:00.063
I agree with you, Matt.

02:15:00.663 --> 02:15:06.731
Being a non-LA person, I'll just say from Northern California, the politics in LA look really tough to me.

02:15:07.472 --> 02:15:12.118
And they look tough at board levels where they're making decisions, especially about charter schools.

02:15:12.218 --> 02:15:13.680
So I'll just put that aside.

02:15:15.723 --> 02:15:18.025
They do clearly have a college-going culture.

02:15:18.065 --> 02:15:19.927
They place a lot of emphasis on that.

02:15:19.967 --> 02:15:33.139
And from what you heard from the alums who were here and a little bit on our video and what we heard over and over again at ACCS, it's very successful with, again, a population who otherwise would not be going to college.

02:15:33.199 --> 02:15:36.282
So that's very compelling to me.

02:15:36.302 --> 02:15:40.206
And I'll just say, as probably the longest-serving charter person,

02:15:41.406 --> 02:15:51.590
going back to 1992, the fact that parents choose to send their children to this school that is a very safe and loving community is the most compelling factor for me.

02:15:52.351 --> 02:15:58.993
So with that, I would like to recommend that we approve the renewal of Avance with some conditions.

02:15:59.094 --> 02:16:06.937
And I think these conditions, and I have copies that I'd like to make sure that, especially Mr. Morales has and the department staff,

02:16:07.897 --> 02:16:12.522
recognize the challenges that they have, and I think the school has recognized these challenges.

02:16:13.143 --> 02:16:22.814
The first is that they contract with an independent education services provider to conduct a root cause analysis and develop an academic action plan.

02:16:23.574 --> 02:16:27.897
That's focused on identifying and approving the school's math and English performance.

02:16:28.558 --> 02:16:42.308
I'm sorry math performance and English learner progress The plan must be adopted by the board of direct the Avon say board of directors and provided to the department by August 1st of 2020 so that addresses the academic issues.

02:16:42.749 --> 02:16:49.734
I think they spoke to that they shared an academic plan in their presentation that I think is relatively consistent with this and

02:16:50.194 --> 02:17:14.716
Number two that they contract with an independent expert to develop a fiscal action plan to eliminate the need for the selling of receivables and to provide training and assistance to ensure effective internal control procedures As well as effective and reliable operations and financial reporting that plan also must be adopted by the advance a board of directors and provided to the department by October 1 of 2020

02:17:17.308 --> 02:17:24.132
Number three, Avance staff will provide quarterly updates to the department regarding development and implementation of these plans.

02:17:24.732 --> 02:17:35.377
And number four is if we choose to adopt this proposal that they revise their petition to address the issues identified by the department and attachment one.

02:17:35.677 --> 02:17:45.062
And these are kind of the standard ones having to do with governance, conflict of interest, and those kinds of things that are relatively new to the statute that need to be included.

02:17:45.782 --> 02:17:46.743
So that's my motion.

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:53.679
I think we do need a second.

02:17:53.739 --> 02:17:54.500
I'll second that.

02:17:54.741 --> 02:17:55.101
Thank you.

02:17:56.023 --> 02:17:57.706
Is there further discussion on the motion?

02:18:01.472 --> 02:18:03.576
We have member Pagalanon and member Rucker.

02:18:04.057 --> 02:18:05.199
Anybody on this side of the?

02:18:10.010 --> 02:18:16.921
I kind of wanted to ask just a little bit more.

02:18:16.941 --> 02:18:22.671
I don't think we really talked about the plan necessarily, the academic plan quite enough.

02:18:27.123 --> 02:18:33.730
I mean IXL, it's just from my perspective it seems like a lot of separate programs.

02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:42.399
I'm not quite understanding exactly the cohesive, I'm not seeing really the cohesive plan and I think that I mean it's good that it's a part of the

02:18:43.340 --> 02:18:56.060
conditions, I would just hope that moving forward, that if we're checking on those, that plan, that it's a cohesive plan and not kind of a piecemeal plan to help students.

02:18:56.863 --> 02:19:00.465
And are you wanting to hear more from the school about what they're doing?

02:19:00.545 --> 02:19:02.146
Is that what you were referring to?

02:19:03.106 --> 02:19:03.907
Can I just clarify?

02:19:03.967 --> 02:19:12.251
Like, will the conditions continuously check up on that and make sure that they're actually working?

02:19:12.271 --> 02:19:13.012
Because it just...

02:19:14.261 --> 02:19:25.332
So that's the intent, and I appreciate you asking the question, Brenna, that by contracting with an independent provider, too, and we give an example such as WestEd, but it could be any provider.

02:19:25.793 --> 02:19:29.216
The idea is a root cause analysis is looking across the system.

02:19:29.236 --> 02:19:38.926
It's what we heard about yesterday when we heard about the system of support to make sure all of the pieces are fitting, that it's not, to your point, just we're kind of throwing stuff against the wall to see what sticks.

02:19:39.486 --> 02:19:50.496
So the intent here is to have a coach, if you will, right alongside the school that can help them develop the plan and make sure it's implemented consistently.

02:19:50.516 --> 02:19:54.680
Is that responsive to your question?

02:19:54.700 --> 02:19:56.082
Okay, Member Rucker?

02:19:58.664 --> 02:20:03.889
Okay, so I want to begin by saying this school was

02:20:05.606 --> 02:20:10.771
mistakenly referred by the department for differentiated assistance.

02:20:11.411 --> 02:20:24.883
If they had remained on the list for differentiated assistance, what you wrote in condition one would be the work that they would be required to do if they were in differentiated assistance.

02:20:25.303 --> 02:20:33.270
And probably condition two might also occur if they were in differentiated assistance.

02:20:33.843 --> 02:20:49.138
And so the point that board member novel makes in their relationship with LAUSD and I agree with you that while the politics of LAUSD's school board and in the community itself are difficult.

02:20:49.578 --> 02:20:57.264
The fact is LAUSD, the school board and the community has been very supportive of charters.

02:20:57.324 --> 02:21:15.159
It has been very supportive of this charter in approving it initially and with what he explained extending and extending their charter until they got to the point where they denied it and then it was appealed up to the county who approved it and then chose to deny it and it's come up here.

02:21:16.189 --> 02:21:31.873
They had the opportunity with each of those denials to learn something from each of those agencies that chose to deny and take a look at their program and do the root cause analysis that should have helped arrest some of the decline

02:21:32.273 --> 02:21:34.014
that is evident in their program.

02:21:34.054 --> 02:21:49.918
And yes, to Board Member Sun's point, all the schools are declining, but all the schools didn't show a 20 point drop in English language arts, which is the state's best performing subject right now, as compared to them.

02:21:50.238 --> 02:21:52.619
The other schools had a 5 or 10 point drop.

02:21:53.019 --> 02:21:55.220
not a 20 point drop in their performance.

02:21:55.820 --> 02:22:12.986
I don't see where between the time they were working as an approved charter for LASD or during the time when they were working for an approved charter by the county that they did any kind of root cause analysis to figure out what was going on and to rest the evident decline

02:22:13.426 --> 02:22:14.547
in their programs.

02:22:15.048 --> 02:22:26.920
So, I'm concerned that these conditions give to this charter a preferential treatment to be treated like a school that's in differentiated assistance and they're not.

02:22:27.381 --> 02:22:31.224
So, I'm concerned about these two conditions.

02:22:32.145 --> 02:22:33.247
Judy Size, I'd like to clarify.

02:22:33.267 --> 02:22:36.430
I don't think these are conditions that would be part of differentiated assistance.

02:22:37.220 --> 02:22:40.181
Doing the root cause analysis is not something they would be asked to do?

02:22:40.201 --> 02:22:41.482
That's comprehensive support.

02:22:41.782 --> 02:22:42.062
Okay.

02:22:42.623 --> 02:22:44.843
And certainly not the fiscal, I don't believe, either.

02:22:44.863 --> 02:22:47.685
Okay.

02:22:49.345 --> 02:22:50.486
Thanks for clarifying that.

02:22:51.666 --> 02:22:52.727
Any further discussion?

02:22:56.857 --> 02:23:05.164
Again, when we start looking at these numbers, when you talk about the percentages going down, percentages sway quite more for smaller schools as well.

02:23:05.264 --> 02:23:11.889
So you have to know what the end for that 11th grade class is to see what that swing in percentage is.

02:23:11.949 --> 02:23:15.412
So that's yet another nuance to look at when we're looking at these numbers.

02:23:17.783 --> 02:23:29.745
I just would, on this numbers question, I think for me, the growth measures are much more persuasive because it says what the school contributed to the kids who were there, right?

02:23:30.145 --> 02:23:37.987
And we know that these are kids who are in and out for a variety of reasons that are reasons we're all concerned about in that population.

02:23:39.507 --> 02:23:42.668
So, I think we've got all the data on the table.

02:23:44.028 --> 02:23:47.530
I hope we all understand the data as well as we can.

02:23:47.550 --> 02:23:48.850
I'm in this context.

02:23:49.350 --> 02:23:50.110
We've got a motion.

02:23:50.150 --> 02:24:08.597
We've got a second Okay, sue under these they the school would have to pay pay for both of these Okay, and if the board doesn't approve their board is it their board does not approve then they would

02:24:11.781 --> 02:24:15.747
So can we remove must be adopted?

02:24:16.588 --> 02:24:18.451
In other words, we're telling them you have to do it.

02:24:18.972 --> 02:24:22.577
This leads me to believe they could say we can't afford it.

02:24:26.562 --> 02:24:34.309
Judy Size, I think the intent with that was to make sure that the board was also part of the plan and not just staff, right?

02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:48.563
But if the board doesn't adopt the plan or at some point the school does not meet some of these conditions like any other one of our charter schools, we would send them a letter of concern, you know, and amp that up, you know, and ultimately revocation.

02:24:49.713 --> 02:24:55.135
I guess the language is concerning to me because it says the plan must be adopted by them.

02:24:56.935 --> 02:24:59.336
I'm fearful that, I don't know that board.

02:25:00.176 --> 02:25:03.237
I know the financial situation is tough.

02:25:04.037 --> 02:25:04.857
What if they say no?

02:25:06.598 --> 02:25:07.878
Then they'd be in violation.

02:25:07.918 --> 02:25:11.259
Can we put in this recommendation, they're made aware.

02:25:12.526 --> 02:25:14.367
I think we wanted it to be adopted at the governing board.

02:25:14.407 --> 02:25:17.748
Another issue would be to involve the community at a publicly noticed meeting.

02:25:18.648 --> 02:25:21.269
If you guys want to change it, of course, that's at your discretion.

02:25:21.289 --> 02:25:27.632
I'm just trying to think of the intent was that the board and the leadership team are working together.

02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:28.992
I like the recommendations.

02:25:29.212 --> 02:25:30.993
I don't like the portion of the recommendation.

02:25:31.013 --> 02:25:33.594
We're depending on Avanci's board to help us do this.

02:25:36.058 --> 02:25:38.260
Let me just describe it a little bit different than Judy did.

02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:47.286
It's to ensure that their governance structure, their board of directors buys into this and gives direction to their leadership that this is what you have to do.

02:25:48.387 --> 02:25:51.129
It's not that... And that is all as a condition of approval.

02:25:51.169 --> 02:25:54.311
It starts out by saying as a condition of approval.

02:25:54.431 --> 02:26:02.497
So if the plan is not adopted by the board of directors and provided to CDE by August 1st, 2020, there is no approval.

02:26:04.286 --> 02:26:04.947
Does that help?

02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:11.712
Judy, you can clarify or Carolyn.

02:26:11.952 --> 02:26:14.734
This is similar to what we did a couple of years ago.

02:26:14.754 --> 02:26:16.415
I'm blanking on which year.

02:26:16.435 --> 02:26:17.876
I believe we did this with Hitech Hive.

02:26:20.839 --> 02:26:35.102
The issues we discussed, and we sort of mirrored it on that, was one we wanted, I think Member Byrd talked about, an outside provider so that can come in and help them look at issues a little bit differently, which is consistent with the system of support, as you know, to have sort of an outside provider.

02:26:35.182 --> 02:26:46.825
And this is consistent with High Tech High, to have an external provider work with the school leadership and the board so that they're all working in concert to try to improve the school.

02:26:48.072 --> 02:26:49.773
If I can add, it's a financial plan.

02:26:49.833 --> 02:26:51.473
This board has to adopt it.

02:26:52.073 --> 02:26:59.475
The board is ultimately responsible for the finances and the budget, so they can't just let the staff take care of it.

02:26:59.535 --> 02:27:00.515
The board needs to be aware.

02:27:00.535 --> 02:27:09.858
Yeah, that language at the last threw me off, but I appreciate you pointing out that what I was obviously missing is if they don't do it, it doesn't happen.

02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:17.180
All in favor of

02:27:21.474 --> 02:27:35.699
okay all in favor of the motion as made say aye aye any opposed any abstentions motion passes

02:27:46.115 --> 02:27:48.756
Or maybe seven minutes, we'll come back at 11.15.

02:27:49.256 --> 02:27:52.197
It might even be eight minutes, depends.

02:28:04.162 --> 02:28:06.643
Okay, I think we're gonna get.

02:28:10.211 --> 02:28:11.231
ready to begin.

02:28:11.251 --> 02:28:17.634
We'll ask for indulgence from the audience.

02:28:17.714 --> 02:28:26.016
The board members have their working lunches have arrived and people will be munching as we move into item 15.

02:28:27.797 --> 02:28:35.985
Agenda item 15 is a public hearing regarding the petition for the renewal of a charter school under the oversight of the State Board of Education.

02:28:36.566 --> 02:28:41.390
Consideration of one purpose school which was denied by the San Francisco Unified School District.

02:28:42.091 --> 02:28:48.417
The CDE proposes to recommend that the State Board holds a public hearing to deny the request to renew OPS.

02:28:49.858 --> 02:29:00.924
A transitional kindergarten through grade 5 charter school based on the CDE's findings pursuant to EC section 47605 and California Code of Regulations title 5 section 11967.5.

02:29:04.806 --> 02:29:08.068
This item will be presented by Stephanie Farland of CDE.

02:29:08.908 --> 02:29:10.989
Stephanie, please begin.

02:29:11.009 --> 02:29:11.689
Thank you.

02:29:14.272 --> 02:29:21.920
So, One Purpose is currently an SB authorized charter school with a term that expires on June 30th.

02:29:24.222 --> 02:29:30.188
They did submit their renewal petition to the authority that originally denied the charter, which was San Francisco Unified.

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:34.612
That board denied the petition on by a vote of seven to zero.

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:37.254
And then they came up to the state board.

02:29:38.499 --> 02:29:41.700
This was heard at the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:50.102
The ACCS moved CDE staff recommendation to deny the petition by a vote of seven to two.

02:29:57.204 --> 02:30:05.946
So basis for our recommendation for denial that they are not consistent with sound educational practice and they are unlikely to successfully implement the intended program.

02:30:08.325 --> 02:30:15.074
They also, as pretty standard, that they do not provide reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all the required elements.

02:30:15.254 --> 02:30:22.704
If you decide to approve this petition, we will need to change some of the necessary language in the petition.

02:30:25.757 --> 02:30:29.701
OPS was originally approved by the SBE in 2015.

02:30:30.541 --> 02:30:35.025
They are intending to serve 118 students in TK through grade 5.

02:30:35.846 --> 02:30:44.854
They currently are co-locating on a Prop 39 agreement with San Francisco Unified's Brett Hart Elementary School.

02:30:47.665 --> 02:30:58.793
They have a mission to build a strong foundation for pupils to succeed in school and beyond, thereby escaping the cycle of poverty through solid academic preparation and social emotional support.

02:31:00.875 --> 02:31:11.543
We selected five schools serving similar grade spans where pupils would otherwise have attended that are comparable in that they have similar enrollment and similar significant subgroups.

02:31:12.904 --> 02:31:24.769
We determined through the CAS data, which is all in your item, that the CAS data demonstrates that OPS does not perform at least equal to the schools where the pupils would otherwise be required to attend.

02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:30.032
They do not yet have dashboard colors.

02:31:30.612 --> 02:31:38.995
They just started serving grade three a couple of years ago, so they don't have enough years of data to provide a dashboard color for the academic indicators.

02:31:39.436 --> 02:31:41.236
They do have them for some of the other indicators.

02:31:44.992 --> 02:31:47.854
Here we can see, so we pulled up the CAS data.

02:31:47.874 --> 02:31:50.236
You won't see dashboard colors, but the CAS data is here.

02:31:50.256 --> 02:32:03.306
15% of their student populations meet or exceed standard in English Language Arts in 2017-18, and then they went down in 2018-19 to where it's just a little over 9%, 9.3% meet or exceed standards for English Language Arts.

02:32:13.864 --> 02:32:20.527
Mathematics, as you can see, very low percentages in terms of meeting or exceeding standards.

02:32:20.547 --> 02:32:22.327
6.25% in 2017-18, they were able to bring that up to 10%.

02:32:29.290 --> 02:32:30.411
in mathematics.

02:32:31.412 --> 02:32:35.356
The colors they do have on the dashboard are for the non-academic indicators.

02:32:36.737 --> 02:32:45.585
And for 2019, they have a chronic absenteeism rate of 44% and a suspension rate of 5%.

02:32:47.567 --> 02:32:52.451
They did improve their suspension rate a little bit, but they did go down in their absentee rate.

02:32:56.713 --> 02:33:00.536
English learner progress indicator, they are at a low performance level.

02:33:02.478 --> 02:33:13.286
But you can see that they have level four and level three are about 50% or so of their, 52% of their students.

02:33:17.090 --> 02:33:22.294
And then here's their progress indicator in terms of how many levels they've increased in their LP.

02:33:25.210 --> 02:33:27.392
I pulled out the chronic absenteeism.

02:33:27.412 --> 02:33:30.514
We're very concerned about their chronic absenteeism.

02:33:31.494 --> 02:33:35.877
As I said, they have increased from 17-18 to 18-19.

02:33:35.897 --> 02:33:46.163
And it tends to be... Hold on, I was gonna get to that.

02:33:49.065 --> 02:33:49.886
Yeah, so it has increased.

02:33:54.301 --> 02:34:00.943
Suspension rates, they have improved from last year, from 2017-18, they went from a red to an orange.

02:34:01.843 --> 02:34:11.686
However, they are still red for their African American population for suspension rates and still red for their socioeconomically disadvantaged for suspension rates.

02:34:12.166 --> 02:34:16.967
So they're having some issues in terms of suspending students at the school.

02:34:19.235 --> 02:34:23.598
We did look at alternative measures that OPS provided.

02:34:24.959 --> 02:34:37.868
Some of it, as we've said before, their family engagement indicators, climate, organizational outcomes, rely on assessments and data for which we lack the independent confirmation of for the reliability and fairness.

02:34:40.585 --> 02:34:43.889
The OPS review, OPS completed their own review.

02:34:43.909 --> 02:35:01.546
2018-19 CAS data wasn't available when they first applied for renewal, but their outcomes are better than the school that they co-locate with, but significantly worse than all the other schools in the area.

02:35:05.055 --> 02:35:12.840
And to that point, I think that they're aware that they're not meeting renewal standards, so they did submit to us.

02:35:14.019 --> 02:35:21.121
some conditions that they would be willing to follow if the board was wanting to approve them.

02:35:22.062 --> 02:35:30.704
We looked at those conditions, and part of those conditions were voluntary closure, which is not something the board can approve or even consider.

02:35:31.505 --> 02:35:33.845
So we really didn't take a look at the conditions.

02:35:35.706 --> 02:35:57.721
Too deeply because they didn't meet any of the standards of renewal So therefore we didn't condition consider the conditions and also that piece about voluntary closure was not something the board is able to do We would have to revoke if you wanted to close the school San Francisco did their own review and also found that their results were not comparable They are here today.

02:35:58.141 --> 02:35:59.882
So they are a district that traveled here.

02:35:59.902 --> 02:36:05.426
I'm really happy about that And they will speak to their review when they come up

02:36:07.492 --> 02:36:13.576
inability to implement They do have in terms of their projected budget.

02:36:13.616 --> 02:36:33.388
So their projected budget includes pupil enrollment for 118 students in 2021 Moving all the way up to 141 they have yet to make any pupil enrollment Goals for their school now, they're under a hundred students right now we have

02:36:37.133 --> 02:36:46.111
We have some doubts that they will be able to even make the 118, so their projected budget is viable if they make the 118.

02:36:49.935 --> 02:36:58.204
considering the area and considering some of the issues around the school and the fact that they've not been able to even make a hundred students, we have some doubts about that.

02:36:59.285 --> 02:37:02.909
They do have money though because a lot of their income outside of the state

02:37:07.693 --> 02:37:10.694
allocations that they receive are private donations.

02:37:11.474 --> 02:37:12.495
And they're pretty consistent.

02:37:14.235 --> 02:37:15.175
We're including them in here.

02:37:15.195 --> 02:37:18.176
They've been pretty consistent with their private donations over the years.

02:37:19.277 --> 02:37:26.159
There hasn't been a lot of lag time in terms of donations, so we've included those in the budget.

02:37:29.185 --> 02:37:34.151
Here's their numbers in terms of what they originally wanted to do when we approved them in 2015.

02:37:34.531 --> 02:37:37.314
They were hoping to be up at 312 students this year.

02:37:38.055 --> 02:37:39.857
And as I said, they're somewhere in the mid-90s.

02:37:43.384 --> 02:37:50.448
Past history under the State Board, they have been issued several letters of concerns for academic and operational noncompliance.

02:37:51.088 --> 02:37:54.690
And for one letter of concern was for low ending fund balance and enrollment.

02:37:56.250 --> 02:38:00.872
They have, when we issue a letter of concern, we do ask sort of conditions.

02:38:00.912 --> 02:38:02.893
We want you to do this, this, and this by this date.

02:38:02.993 --> 02:38:10.297
And they have complied with all of our letters of concerns in the past.

02:38:13.907 --> 02:38:24.673
We find that they do not provide a reasonably comprehensive description of the following required charter elements, educational program, governance structure, suspension and expulsion procedures, dispute resolution procedures.

02:38:25.233 --> 02:38:40.441
In terms of educational program, they were not clear on how they would identify students who are not achieving at or above expected levels, nor how they will respond to the needs of low-achieving and high-achieving pupils.

02:38:41.361 --> 02:38:47.563
The petition also does not state that reclassified fluent proficient pupils need to be monitored for four years after reclassification.

02:38:48.703 --> 02:38:56.785
Governance structure had some issues in terms of their bylaws and potential conflict of interest.

02:38:57.706 --> 02:39:02.047
Those things would need to be fixed if the school moves forward.

02:39:02.907 --> 02:39:04.587
Suspension and expulsion procedures.

02:39:06.508 --> 02:39:16.519
You cannot involuntarily remove a student for OPS unless the parent or guardian has been provided written notice of intent to remove the people.

02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:20.043
They do not state that in their suspension expulsion procedures.

02:39:20.063 --> 02:39:21.805
They needed to be more clear that they understood that.

02:39:23.507 --> 02:39:33.934
And the petition does not state that when an appeal relating to the placement of the pupil has been requested that the pupil shall remain in the interim alternative educational sending pending the decision of the hearing officer.

02:39:33.954 --> 02:39:41.339
So just some issues with the suspension expulsion procedures that we were not clear that they understood what they were supposed to do.

02:39:41.759 --> 02:39:48.624
Dispute resolution, this is pretty much the same dispute resolution language we saw for the last charter and that we see for every charter in terms of

02:39:50.565 --> 02:40:03.053
recognizing that the State Board can't be pre-bound to contractual obligations and in the matters of dispute, the SB will act in accordance to charter law.

02:40:04.333 --> 02:40:09.076
So we are recommending denial of the OPS petition for all of the stated reasons.

02:40:12.178 --> 02:40:17.181
And we ask that you deny the charter school on our recommendation.

02:40:19.619 --> 02:40:19.979
Thank you.

02:40:19.999 --> 02:40:21.000
1132 AM.

02:40:34.031 --> 02:40:35.552
First, we'll hear from the petitioners.

02:40:35.632 --> 02:40:37.133
The petitioners will have 10 minutes.

02:40:37.673 --> 02:40:40.855
Then, we will hear from the district that is opposing the renewal petition.

02:40:41.595 --> 02:40:43.356
They will also have a total of 10 minutes.

02:40:44.016 --> 02:40:52.041
After the presentations from both sides, there will be an opportunity for public comment from any individual who has not already presented for one minute each.

02:40:53.862 --> 02:40:56.303
So, we'll take the petitioner presentation.

02:41:13.888 --> 02:41:16.010
Good morning members of the Board of Education.

02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:17.611
My name is Ingrid Mesquita.

02:41:18.452 --> 02:41:21.515
I am a board member on One Purpose School.

02:41:22.215 --> 02:41:30.303
I'm also the director of the, my day job is actually I'm the director for the San Francisco Office of Early Care and Education.

02:41:31.355 --> 02:41:42.924
And I'm here as a board member to introduce you not only to our talented team, but there's also other board members here that are gonna speak to several parts of our presentation.

02:41:43.805 --> 02:41:57.635
We have our principal, Annie, who's here, a fellow board member, Joy Jackson, our enrollment and development person, Joy Steinberg, and in the audience, we also have our board chair, Pamela Mann.

02:41:59.256 --> 02:42:16.961
And as we speak today about the type of supports that we provide to students at One Purpose, I do want to make one thing in terms of emphasizing is that yes, we do look at academic rigor, but part of the One Purpose school is to also provide

02:42:17.781 --> 02:42:23.585
a well-rounded type of programming, which includes the development of children's social-emotional well-being.

02:42:24.085 --> 02:42:29.348
And these are part of the wraparound supports that One Purpose School does in a very effective manner.

02:42:31.187 --> 02:42:50.023
As part of our, as we have mentioned before, one of the things that we have been focusing on is not only academic, and for which you'll hear a little bit more, the school is situated in the Bayview neighborhood, which is in one of the neighborhoods that is

02:42:51.643 --> 02:42:57.385
I would say probably the one of the most highest need neighborhoods of the city of San Francisco.

02:42:58.325 --> 02:43:03.306
We're divided between South and East, I mean East and West.

02:43:03.326 --> 02:43:14.909
And all the neighborhoods in the Eastern side, very similar to other places in other urban areas, have not only been underserved, but also underfunded chronically for a number of years.

02:43:15.969 --> 02:43:28.158
And so what you see is not necessarily a manifestation of something that just happened overnight, but rather of years and years of really overtly racist policies.

02:43:28.398 --> 02:43:40.987
And so I hope that you take that in mind as we provide some of this data and also look at what we can do as board members to support the students at one purpose.

02:43:43.667 --> 02:44:02.018
So one of the things that we have done in years one and three, aside from the academic piece, is that we have also been under an enormous amount of stress with our founding member, or founding principal, Daniel.

02:44:03.018 --> 02:44:09.182
He ended up having to leave the school because of health reasons, and sadly he ended up passing away.

02:44:10.523 --> 02:44:21.389
when we replaced them with a principal who ended up also having serious health conditions and she also had to move on.

02:44:21.589 --> 02:44:37.379
So there's lots of work that has happened behind the scenes but there's also this other thing that's called human dynamics and relationships that also have an effect on not only on the student body but also on the staff as well.

02:44:45.063 --> 02:44:49.285
So, is that one over here?

02:44:49.705 --> 02:44:50.385
Okay, all right.

02:44:51.346 --> 02:45:13.536
One of the things that we also want to talk to you today is that given all of the work that we have done to stabilize One Purpose is that we also are asking you to give us the adequate time to be able to demonstrate not only our program but also our ability to be able to effectively do interventions that work

02:45:14.496 --> 02:45:27.005
So we've made a proposal to you, included in your packets, that we would adhere to voluntary conditions of approval that would allow us two years to meet the indicators aligned to the California School Dashboard.

02:45:27.845 --> 02:45:34.229
But we're also amenable to be able to adjust those conditions based on the conversation today.

02:45:34.249 --> 02:45:40.233
And we can speak to more about that through either our legal counsel or our board chair.

02:45:41.534 --> 02:45:52.228
If we do not meet those benchmarks in the two years that we're asking, as well as this current year, then we will voluntarily close the school, which is something that we do not want to do.

02:45:53.792 --> 02:46:08.619
However, this timeline would allow us to share a more complete data story as last year our enrollment was so small in the tested grades and that we did not have the subgroups in order to have those colors on the dashboard.

02:46:09.779 --> 02:46:21.024
To be able to talk a bit more about our program approach and also our community, I'm going to hand over the mic to Joy Jackson, another board member.

02:46:21.565 --> 02:46:21.905
Thank you.

02:46:26.274 --> 02:46:26.634
Thank you.

02:46:26.935 --> 02:46:40.628
So as Ingrid alluded to, Bayview has a rich history and does not tolerate savior complexes or charismatic leaders to come in with false promises.

02:46:41.669 --> 02:46:45.272
We definitely hold people to what they say.

02:46:45.833 --> 02:46:49.396
And so one purpose has really focused on

02:46:50.197 --> 02:47:15.372
Addressing the trauma that the community has faced over the years and has proven to be a true community partner Some of the the ways that we've incorporated this partnership is also building connections with other standing strong programs like some of the the preschools and the YMCA and the Boys and Girls Clubs but

02:47:17.533 --> 02:47:26.604
In terms of our community, 70% of our kids leave the community for other educational opportunities.

02:47:27.044 --> 02:47:33.051
And so our families are looking for and they deserve a viable option in their community.

02:47:37.139 --> 02:47:40.224
So here's a quick overview of One Purpose Schools enrollment history.

02:47:40.384 --> 02:47:47.755
As you can see in years two and three, we were fully enrolled and had a wait list at the beginning of each year and showed growth in each of those years.

02:47:48.216 --> 02:47:52.241
We averaged about 20 students per classroom and had wait lists at the beginning of the year.

02:47:52.742 --> 02:47:58.046
Then we found out in year three that our facilities offer for year four did not include any additional classrooms.

02:47:58.166 --> 02:48:06.332
So we made the decision to prioritize serving our current students over growth, which meant that we did not offer a transitional kindergarten class in our fourth year.

02:48:06.653 --> 02:48:14.699
And we also had to combine our two second grade classes into one third grade class, despite the fact that we had a wait list and could have filled two third grade classrooms.

02:48:15.499 --> 02:48:21.563
Additionally, year four's extenuating circumstances that Ingrid discussed are reflected in how we started the current year.

02:48:22.163 --> 02:48:26.886
Now moving forward, next year we are projecting an enrollment of 118 students.

02:48:26.926 --> 02:48:36.212
And I'm confident that we will reach this number because through a recent survey with our current families, 90% indicated they plan to re-enroll despite all the uncertainty of charter renewal.

02:48:36.632 --> 02:48:43.436
We have an additional 56 meaningfully interested students and families in enrolling next school year and anticipate additional applications to come in.

02:48:44.658 --> 02:48:45.860
as we get closer to next year.

02:48:46.220 --> 02:48:55.096
And additionally, San Francisco Unified School District and its preliminary facilities offer for next year did not challenge our enrollment projections and offered us facilities to accommodate the 118 students.

02:48:57.381 --> 02:49:07.024
Can I just say how excited I am that we have 90% of our families interested in re-enrolling considering our year four that was described and the fact that we're in charter renewal currently.

02:49:07.605 --> 02:49:13.867
We have really dug deep and pivoted in our vision and mission to make sure that we are meeting the needs of our community.

02:49:14.207 --> 02:49:20.309
We were able to reestablish a school-wide culture by hiring a culture and climate coach, focusing on PBIS systems.

02:49:20.569 --> 02:49:23.050
We've also hired experienced credentialed staff,

02:49:23.791 --> 02:49:26.915
And we are offering a salary 10% over the district average.

02:49:26.975 --> 02:49:30.680
And we have opened a wellness center that's supporting our scholars with social emotional needs.

02:49:31.281 --> 02:49:39.052
I am proud to share that during the October CDE oversight visit, improvements are observed and noted in regarding to the overall school-wide culture and climate.

02:49:39.773 --> 02:49:46.917
We have also focused on robust supports for ELA and math while we have navigated and analyzed our student data.

02:49:46.937 --> 02:49:51.940
We are providing six-week intervention cycles, a flood model, and we have a 10 to 1 student ratio.

02:49:52.420 --> 02:49:57.443
We've also hired an instructional coach that has really helped us pivot our instruction and take

02:49:58.623 --> 02:50:04.067
Our initial focus on project-based learning and teacher-created materials has now shifted and taken the backseat.

02:50:04.468 --> 02:50:11.413
So we have adopted new research-based curriculum and really put that in the driver's seat to ensure that our instructional outcomes are where they need to be.

02:50:14.036 --> 02:50:16.898
Research-based Common Core Aligned Curriculum is now our floor.

02:50:17.398 --> 02:50:22.761
We continue to invest in our teachers by developing their instructional practice because curriculum alone is not enough.

02:50:23.421 --> 02:50:36.028
By design, our teacher works calendar includes 20 paid days for professional development and this support along with the ability to provide strategic intensive coaching makes me confident that this development will be fruitful.

02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:41.301
One Purpose has also partnered with three partnership schools.

02:50:41.341 --> 02:50:50.845
We partner with Seneca Family of Agencies and we have provided three times the number of, we have tripled our number of students and families receiving mental health services.

02:50:51.325 --> 02:50:57.228
We also partner with the Boys and Girls Club and nearly 70% of our scholars are accessing free after school care.

02:50:57.788 --> 02:51:04.391
And we have partnered with the YMCA where 60% of our scholars are accessing our summer school programs.

02:51:05.171 --> 02:51:08.814
We provide a program unlike any other school in the Bayview.

02:51:09.654 --> 02:51:15.799
Our Bayview scholars and families need and deserve what we have to offer at One Purpose.

02:51:15.859 --> 02:51:22.944
We are here to ask that you use your vote today to ensure our Bayview students and families receive what they deserve by renewing our petition.

02:51:23.144 --> 02:51:23.485
Thank you.

02:51:46.067 --> 02:51:47.187
Good morning, board members.

02:51:47.487 --> 02:51:48.728
My name is Michael Davis.

02:51:48.928 --> 02:51:54.769
I'm the director for charter schools for San Francisco Unified School District and County Office of Education.

02:51:56.569 --> 02:52:06.391
As you heard from the CD presentation, this charter renewal was presented to the San Bernardino, San Bernardino.

02:52:06.811 --> 02:52:08.272
I was in San Bernardino yesterday.

02:52:10.834 --> 02:52:35.512
the San Francisco Board of Education for Renewal, the staff reviewed the petition and made the findings that the charter school did not perform as well or better than most of the schools that it compared to demographically and geographically.

02:52:36.353 --> 02:52:39.655
And also that the charter school's achievement

02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:46.883
progress over the last couple of years was negative and not positive.

02:52:47.103 --> 02:53:01.671
We recommended that the board make findings that the charter school did not meet the academic criteria for renewal and that the petitioners were demonstrably unlikely to succeed.

02:53:02.992 --> 02:53:05.133
I gave the detailed presentation which

02:53:07.631 --> 02:53:14.956
The CDE staff has also presented at the ACCS meeting and I did not bring it back for this meeting.

02:53:16.257 --> 02:53:20.760
Just a couple of other things in regard to declining enrollment.

02:53:22.001 --> 02:53:26.344
That has been demonstrated in the information provided by the district.

02:53:27.065 --> 02:53:29.386
by the charter school and by CDE staff.

02:53:30.507 --> 02:53:46.616
There was some discussion in the ACCS about the fact that the district school with which the charter school is located, Brett Hart Elementary School, was experiencing similar declines in enrollment.

02:53:47.916 --> 02:54:00.103
That school over the past four years went from 180 down to 164 last year, but in this current year it is back up to 206.

02:54:00.843 --> 02:54:06.026
So, it is not experiencing the same decline in enrollment.

02:54:07.462 --> 02:54:22.327
As far as the Prop 39 issues, as was stated over the term of the charter, the district has cooperated in meeting the legal requirements under Prop 39 for providing facilities.

02:54:23.427 --> 02:54:28.409
That has been difficult because of the co-location with the district school, which also

02:54:30.089 --> 02:54:32.470
strongly feels it has a right to grow its program.

02:54:36.353 --> 02:54:45.198
The school currently has 10 classrooms in the facility with our school.

02:54:45.338 --> 02:54:51.061
Those same 10 classrooms were offered under the preliminary offer for next year.

02:54:52.482 --> 02:54:55.664
In the meantime, as was stated, we did agree with the 118.

02:54:56.624 --> 02:54:58.506
We know that there are a little under 100 now.

02:54:59.755 --> 02:55:05.198
but felt it was reasonable for them to project that they could get to 118 next year.

02:55:06.359 --> 02:55:21.808
In the meantime, though, the school has very responsibly approached the Brett Hart School and said we need to plan for the transition and held an enrollment fair on February 26.

02:55:22.769 --> 02:55:27.471
That fair was participated in by Brett Hart Elementary and

02:55:29.025 --> 02:55:33.148
a couple of other charter schools in the area, and of course, One Purpose.

02:55:33.368 --> 02:55:43.336
And at that fair, 18 families actually switched and decided that they wanted to enroll at Brett Hart.

02:55:44.037 --> 02:55:48.140
And of course, our Educational Placement Center is willing to make that happen.

02:55:48.260 --> 02:55:55.445
So those are the details of what went on.

02:56:00.581 --> 02:56:06.225
We will now take public comment at one minute per person.

02:56:08.126 --> 02:56:09.628
We do have a number of speakers.

02:56:09.888 --> 02:56:15.812
I will call them in groups of five and we ask speakers maintain a six foot perimeter.

02:56:16.953 --> 02:56:25.719
Michael Juba, Pamela Mann, Joy Jackson Morgan, Sue Davenport, Trevor Skelton.

02:56:28.345 --> 02:56:31.165
We encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:56:31.286 --> 02:56:31.608
Thank you.

02:56:35.425 --> 02:56:35.885
Still morning.

02:56:35.905 --> 02:56:36.626
Good morning, everybody.

02:56:37.546 --> 02:56:40.288
My name is Michael Juba representing California Teachers Association.

02:56:40.308 --> 02:56:44.571
I'm going to reiterate probably what was in the presentation a few moments ago at the beginning.

02:56:47.572 --> 02:56:51.175
We, as CTA, oppose the renewal for the following reasons.

02:56:51.975 --> 02:57:04.463
OPS significantly underperforms as compared to other chosen comparable schools in academic achievement, the chronic absenteeism, suspensions, and the declining ELA and math scores.

02:57:06.729 --> 02:57:11.952
The second is they are under-enrolling, which was obvious a few moments ago.

02:57:13.513 --> 02:57:16.575
OPS has also shown a consistent history of not serving their students.

02:57:17.556 --> 02:57:23.579
In 2019 alone, there were teachers that were not in possession of a valid teacher credential.

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.221
as well as EL authorizations.

02:57:27.382 --> 02:57:37.947
They lacked an English language advisory committee, as well as school safety and emergency drills, and their pupil CUME folders and IEP files were not properly maintained.

02:57:38.307 --> 02:57:42.930
And so for those reasons, we recommend that you deny this petition.

02:57:42.970 --> 02:57:43.210
Thank you.

02:57:53.086 --> 02:57:53.526
Good morning.

02:57:53.806 --> 02:57:58.349
My name is Susan Davenport and I'm the Finance Chair of the Board of Directors of One Purpose School.

02:57:59.229 --> 02:58:04.992
One Purpose's funding is uniquely robust and has allowed us to profoundly benefit the students and families in the Bayview.

02:58:05.732 --> 02:58:07.813
We engage in extensive local fundraising.

02:58:08.054 --> 02:58:18.899
Our Board of Directors is committed to and has been successful in raising up to a million dollars annually to support state funding and provide the wraparound services and level of staffing required

02:58:19.399 --> 02:58:23.700
to truly serve the traditionally underserved community of the Bayview.

02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:26.900
We view this as an asset and not a liability.

02:58:28.001 --> 02:58:35.002
And it's why some of the most traumatized students in the Bayview come and enroll at OP.

02:58:35.522 --> 02:58:37.442
They want the services that we can provide.

02:58:38.342 --> 02:58:41.403
One Purpose has been extremely successful in its development efforts.

02:58:41.563 --> 02:58:46.084
We've been able to mobilize individuals and foundations to invest in the future success of Bayview.

02:58:47.004 --> 02:58:50.048
And it's as evidenced by the letters of support we've submitted.

02:58:50.288 --> 02:58:54.813
To date, we've raised over $4.4 million from nearly 575 donors.

02:58:54.873 --> 02:58:57.276
And last week, our Spring Benefit Dinner raised $340,000.

02:58:57.336 --> 02:58:57.576
Thank you.

02:59:07.381 --> 02:59:07.761
Good morning.

02:59:08.441 --> 02:59:17.165
My name is Trevor Skelton, and I'm a client finance manager at EdTech, One Purpose's back office service provider, supporting the school in its budgeting and financial management.

02:59:17.886 --> 02:59:26.910
EdTech has been working with OP since the school's inception, and in that time, the school has achieved a level of financial stability and health that is not common for small charters this young.

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:34.954
The school is a reserve of 18%, well above the 5% minimum as projected to maintain the fund balance percent in its multi-year projection.

02:59:35.794 --> 02:59:43.140
This reserve has provided a foundation to mitigate economic uncertainties and support strong monthly cash balances without any receivable sales.

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:46.322
An important lesson in OP's first five years was scale.

02:59:46.722 --> 02:59:56.810
One Purpose's new model now assumes a smaller scale than the original petition, with which we are confident in its ability to effectively deliver a quality education while maintaining a sound financial model.

02:59:57.510 --> 03:00:03.135
From my experience as a consultant, the school leaders and board of directors are highly engaged and effective partners.

03:00:04.246 --> 03:00:10.630
I urge you to vote to approve the renewal of One Purpose School and I look forward to answering any of your questions about the finances or budget.

03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:11.250
Thank you.

03:00:29.397 --> 03:00:32.879
Good morning, my name is Pamela Mann, I chair the board of One Purpose School.

03:00:33.979 --> 03:00:36.941
I wanted to highlight two things relating to prior comments.

03:00:37.141 --> 03:00:44.685
One, first I hope you will give us the opportunity to respond to comments made by SFUSD concerning enrollment and our enrollment fair.

03:00:45.225 --> 03:00:53.449
I would hope and expect that you would not hold it against One Purpose School, that we're looking out for both our students and our families and our teachers.

03:00:54.049 --> 03:00:56.590
in the context of charter renewal uncertainty.

03:00:57.550 --> 03:01:06.452
As far as we are aware, no student has applied for nor submitted an application to Brett Hart to be enrolled.

03:01:06.712 --> 03:01:20.036
We would, of course, encourage our students, as we think anyone would, to look into other opportunities, to look out for their best interests, and seek a proper education should one purpose charter renewal petition be denied.

03:01:20.416 --> 03:01:29.185
The second thing I just want to emphasize, and I hope you will ask us about this as well, is that in year three, we did undergo tremendous transitions.

03:01:29.726 --> 03:01:37.174
As mentioned, our founder and CEO, the visionary of One Purpose, left the school and subsequently passed away.

03:01:37.194 --> 03:01:38.676
Our founding principal,

03:01:39.416 --> 03:01:47.298
left under ordinary circumstances, but our subsequent principal did not work out and for health reasons had to pass the mantle on to someone else.

03:01:47.758 --> 03:02:01.541
Annie Shibley, who you heard speak here today, stepped up ably at the board, jumped in, is a working board, and we have all been more than willing to try and address prior educational inequities in the Bayview.

03:02:01.781 --> 03:02:02.161
Thank you.

03:02:09.594 --> 03:02:13.195
Hi, my name is Jahaziel, and I am a fourth grader at One Purpose.

03:02:13.795 --> 03:02:16.316
I started One Purpose in the first grade, and I love it here.

03:02:16.897 --> 03:02:23.399
Education is important to me because I know it will lead to a bright future if I choose to do it with One Purpose.

03:02:23.779 --> 03:02:26.820
I've learned a lot here at OP, and I owe it all to my teachers.

03:02:27.200 --> 03:02:35.083
They dedicate a lot of their time by making sure I get the education I need and preparing me for class projects we do.

03:02:35.543 --> 03:02:41.366
I know my teachers care about my future because they spend a lot of time working with me, especially in reading.

03:02:41.706 --> 03:02:46.608
I used to have trouble reading and pronouncing words, but now I'm one of the best readers in my class.

03:02:47.428 --> 03:02:50.570
Our school is small but has a big heart and that's why I'm here.

03:02:50.971 --> 03:02:52.212
To fight for what I believe in.

03:02:52.652 --> 03:02:54.073
And I believe in one purpose.

03:02:54.353 --> 03:02:57.095
Today has made me appreciate my school and their hard work.

03:02:57.515 --> 03:02:59.276
I may be young but I hope my voice counts.

03:02:59.697 --> 03:03:00.978
Please keep One Purpose open.

03:03:01.218 --> 03:03:01.498
Thank you.

03:03:08.988 --> 03:03:09.829
Tough act to follow.

03:03:10.409 --> 03:03:11.670
Again, my name is Janelle Rooley.

03:03:11.690 --> 03:03:12.211
I'm an attorney.

03:03:12.231 --> 03:03:16.214
I'm adding my support for One Purpose's renewal appeal.

03:03:16.794 --> 03:03:29.685
I did want to draw your attention to an extraordinary step taken by the petitioners, which was to set their own benchmarks for accountability and offering to voluntarily close, to close down the school if they did not meet those benchmarks.

03:03:30.186 --> 03:03:32.968
This is truly a remarkable situation.

03:03:33.328 --> 03:03:37.632
This is a charter school volunteering to close itself down if it doesn't perform.

03:03:38.012 --> 03:03:44.276
This would mean no notice of violation step for the state board, no notice of intent to revoke, no action to revoke.

03:03:44.856 --> 03:03:46.778
This kind of offer is very rare statewide.

03:03:46.798 --> 03:03:50.860
I can't actually recall an instance where it has been made at the state level.

03:03:51.341 --> 03:03:55.183
It speaks to one purpose's seriousness of purpose and their commitment to improvement.

03:03:55.643 --> 03:03:59.446
It's also recognition of the gravity of the circumstances that the school finds itself in.

03:04:00.106 --> 03:04:04.008
Given this extraordinary measure, we ask that you accept this offer and renew the charter.

03:04:04.869 --> 03:04:07.911
I did hear a statement from the CDE that this wasn't possible.

03:04:08.051 --> 03:04:13.874
I'm not sure of the legal foundation for that, but this type of agreement has been entered into statewide.

03:04:14.035 --> 03:04:14.295
Thank you.

03:04:26.616 --> 03:04:34.660
Seeing no other public comment, we will now close the public hearing for the item at 1156 a.m.

03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:36.862
and commence with board discussion and action.

03:04:37.522 --> 03:04:41.724
First, I'd like to ask Sue Burr as our SBE liaison if she has any initial comments.

03:04:42.145 --> 03:04:46.927
Then we'll ask board members if they have clarifying questions or comments as part of our board discussion.

03:04:47.207 --> 03:04:47.508
Thank you.

03:04:48.828 --> 03:04:50.790
So this is a very tough one for me.

03:04:50.810 --> 03:04:58.054
And first, I want to start with this issue about the school itself suggesting conditions.

03:04:58.234 --> 03:05:01.516
And maybe, Judy, you might want to respond to this.

03:05:02.437 --> 03:05:06.999
There's sort of two things that I'm not quite sure how they arrived at them.

03:05:07.079 --> 03:05:16.705
They would be different than our state-adopted criteria, if you will, for movement on dashboard and those kinds of things.

03:05:16.765 --> 03:05:17.806
So I don't know if we want to

03:05:18.106 --> 03:05:19.288
kind of go down that path.

03:05:20.089 --> 03:05:30.604
But beyond that, they're suggesting a time frame that I believe is not consistent with state law, that if we renew a charter, we are stuck with five years.

03:05:30.624 --> 03:05:33.048
I'm looking for Judy.

03:05:33.772 --> 03:05:46.564
And that our ability to do anything with the charter is restricted to revocation in the event they were not to meet the conditions that they set.

03:05:46.604 --> 03:05:47.965
So I just want to clarify that.

03:05:48.545 --> 03:05:52.229
I don't, the last speaker said something about this has been done on a statewide level.

03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:53.190
I don't know what that means.

03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:55.452
I'm not familiar with that, but anyway.

03:05:55.752 --> 03:05:56.913
Judy Sias, Chief Counsel.

03:05:57.814 --> 03:05:58.494
I'm not aware of

03:05:59.295 --> 03:06:03.701
anything statewide either since I've been here, not to say it hasn't been done before that.

03:06:03.921 --> 03:06:06.865
I'm not aware of anything, but Sue is correct.

03:06:08.547 --> 03:06:15.016
The school does not meet the renewal conditions, which I think they've acknowledged, and what they're basically asking for is an additional two years to try to get there.

03:06:16.057 --> 03:06:18.599
They say they'll voluntarily close if they don't get there.

03:06:19.119 --> 03:06:21.501
The issue is there's really no way to enforce that.

03:06:22.002 --> 03:06:32.471
Should two years from now there be another school leader, another board, or there's some disagreement over the data, the only way we as a board could enforce that would be to go through the revocation process.

03:06:35.980 --> 03:06:46.650
Just to clarify that point and so for those of you who are interested in the conditions that they suggested they were in our letters, so you can take a look at those.

03:06:48.051 --> 03:06:53.877
I think for me I come down to the sad decision that this school has had five years.

03:06:54.037 --> 03:06:56.179
They've struggled for five years.

03:06:56.199 --> 03:06:58.421
You've heard a lot about the enrollment and

03:06:59.141 --> 03:07:09.486
There are, and Mike did talk about this in more detail at the ACCS, there are a lot of other options actually in this area that are available to students.

03:07:10.606 --> 03:07:17.849
So I unfortunately come down on the side of the ACCS recommendation here that we deny the renewal for the school.

03:07:21.018 --> 03:07:21.498
Thank you.

03:07:23.400 --> 03:07:27.382
So, I think we can now turn to any other board discussion.

03:07:28.283 --> 03:07:28.903
Member Rucker?

03:07:30.444 --> 03:07:31.105
Member Strauss?

03:07:32.878 --> 03:07:50.406
So, I agree there's, whenever charter school appeals get to this level, with each successive meeting and appeal that the school representatives from both sides have, the emotions level up and become more intense.

03:07:51.066 --> 03:07:58.290
And the concerns about what is happening at the charter get a laser focus with each successive hearing.

03:07:59.751 --> 03:08:08.460
I am sitting here looking at this charter and thinking about the two charters that we are tasked with considering today.

03:08:09.702 --> 03:08:11.744
There are some stark differences.

03:08:12.425 --> 03:08:18.491
One charter has been in place for 15 years and this one has been having some problems for five years.

03:08:19.292 --> 03:08:35.788
What I see is different is this charter does recognize their struggle and is asking the board as part of their appeal for some assistance and seeking to negotiate some conditions to address their concerns.

03:08:38.110 --> 03:08:40.272
And we're not doing that with this charter.

03:08:41.078 --> 03:08:44.280
We did that with the previous charter and they didn't ask for it.

03:08:44.740 --> 03:08:48.823
They didn't even seem to recognize that they were having a problem and that they were struggling.

03:08:49.203 --> 03:08:54.467
But we bent over backwards to create a set of conditions for that school.

03:08:54.507 --> 03:09:10.578
And I voted for that primarily because the conditions that were established, even though it did treat that charter differently and created a special status for that charter, I believe those conditions will work and ultimately contribute to the success of that school.

03:09:11.258 --> 03:09:22.182
So while I generally, as you all know, oppose failing charters, I just can't help but wonder why this dais is not bending over backwards to do the same thing for this school.

03:09:25.963 --> 03:09:27.124
We can just go around, yeah.

03:09:27.384 --> 03:09:33.006
I don't know if we can return if Sue wants to speak to her analysis.

03:09:33.806 --> 03:09:34.066
Brenna?

03:09:34.086 --> 03:09:36.267
Do you want to go next?

03:09:37.113 --> 03:09:37.373
Okay.

03:09:38.194 --> 03:09:38.454
Ching?

03:09:39.776 --> 03:09:44.000
I actually just had some specific questions on some of the information that was provided.

03:09:46.262 --> 03:10:00.396
One for CDE staff and the other for chronic, for the charter regarding their chronic absenteeism rate and was that the result of all the changes and things like that and how you're tracking that?

03:10:03.037 --> 03:10:10.199
Actually, I have another question around the fundraising piece of it.

03:10:11.459 --> 03:10:14.780
The CDE question I had was around the oversight visit.

03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:29.384
The petitioners seemed to feel that the oversight visit was fairly positive and I was curious what CDE staff saw in the school, what was happening in the school.

03:10:31.496 --> 03:10:32.677
So that's for CDE staff.

03:10:32.717 --> 03:10:35.280
And then my other two questions was for the party.

03:10:36.241 --> 03:10:39.884
So our staff visits the school, obviously, every year.

03:10:41.226 --> 03:10:46.171
I have not seen the, we had the consultant here just a minute ago.

03:10:46.731 --> 03:10:50.195
But beyond that, for the five years of their existence,

03:10:51.756 --> 03:10:57.905
As I mentioned in the presentation, there have been many letters of concern.

03:10:58.006 --> 03:11:02.312
Some of those are around teacher credentialing, school safety, people records.

03:11:07.419 --> 03:11:11.501
ELD instruction lacking proper designated integrated ELD instruction of pupils.

03:11:12.561 --> 03:11:15.802
So we have had many concerns with them.

03:11:15.983 --> 03:11:29.288
Our consultants are very good about working with the school to try to support them in meeting our concerns and rectifying any of the deficiencies that they see.

03:11:30.689 --> 03:11:37.352
I am sure our consultant was positive because he always is when he goes to the charter schools and works with the staff.

03:11:38.152 --> 03:11:46.656
And so if they are making some progress this year, we don't have any of the results yet for what they're doing this year in terms of scores or student scores.

03:11:48.277 --> 03:11:54.705
But he very well could have been positive with them in terms of the progress they're making.

03:11:55.706 --> 03:12:00.672
I haven't seen any evidence of that, and I don't know he's here.

03:12:00.852 --> 03:12:06.879
Carrie, do you have any specific about the actual site visit?

03:12:08.709 --> 03:12:22.840
So as required by law, we take our responsibilities very seriously in the oversight unit and we conduct an annual site visit and we have a monitoring instrument that we use and we actually go out there and look to make sure that the

03:12:24.361 --> 03:12:36.083
the school is aligned to its petition that is in compliance with the MOU that it has with the State Board of Education and that it is in compliance with the monitoring instrument that we use going out.

03:12:36.524 --> 03:12:41.145
In addition to that, we do some classroom observations.

03:12:41.585 --> 03:12:44.285
We do talk with stakeholders at the school.

03:12:44.345 --> 03:12:47.766
We have a general set of questions and then kind of make a

03:12:49.367 --> 03:12:54.489
And then after that, we come back and we have some discussions around it, and then we put together a letter.

03:12:54.549 --> 03:13:00.152
And that's what, when you see in the actual item, you can see some of the letters of concerns that we've sent out in the past.

03:13:00.813 --> 03:13:16.501
So when we did our site visit in October of 2019, they had met the criteria that we look for when we go out on the site visit, and the letter that was sent out was not a letter of concern, but a letter that they were meeting the requirements and were compliant.

03:13:16.942 --> 03:13:17.666
as of October of 2019.

03:13:20.057 --> 03:13:22.079
Right, oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.

03:13:22.579 --> 03:13:25.982
So that all sounds great, and I think that's absolutely right.

03:13:26.783 --> 03:13:28.564
We should be doing that kind of visit.

03:13:29.005 --> 03:13:35.831
Does that visit provide any support for the recommendation?

03:13:35.891 --> 03:13:47.661
I know that we have specific criteria on the renewal piece of it, but it seems that the visit piece, if you're feeling the school has got a firm grasp now moving forward,

03:13:48.041 --> 03:13:52.585
that that would be a part of our review of the school.

03:13:53.786 --> 03:13:56.248
We do look at the past operation of the school.

03:13:56.288 --> 03:13:59.170
I mean, that's part of one of our criteria for renewal.

03:13:59.911 --> 03:14:06.597
And the school has, as you see looking at some of the letters of concern, the school has struggled in the past.

03:14:06.897 --> 03:14:08.518
They've had some academic concerns.

03:14:08.538 --> 03:14:10.360
They've had some operational concerns.

03:14:10.680 --> 03:14:33.143
they've had some concern we've had concerns with them on the implementation of programs we've had concerns with them on just the day-to-day operations of the school so our consultants have worked very hard with this school in order to build that relationship with the leadership of the school to give our recommendations we've been out there more than once we of course do our annual site visit but outside of that we've been down there

03:14:33.243 --> 03:14:41.171
many times to provide support and technical assistance and support to the school during the last couple of years.

03:14:41.892 --> 03:14:49.020
And I think there's a balance that we have to strike in terms of how much support we give the school and how much they should actually be doing on their own.

03:14:50.201 --> 03:14:52.764
And in terms of sort of balancing what

03:14:54.853 --> 03:15:07.658
what our thoughts are or what our observations were in October of this past year and whether that outweighs their chronic issues and outweighs their academic achievement levels, which are really low.

03:15:07.698 --> 03:15:12.719
And they acknowledge that they're not meeting the criteria set in law for renewal standards.

03:15:15.023 --> 03:15:16.844
Yeah, and that's what I was trying to get at.

03:15:16.964 --> 03:15:32.935
So the last review, which seems like it's more positive than in the past, was that the person who reviewed felt firm enough, confident enough, that the school was on a positive trajectory?

03:15:33.135 --> 03:15:41.160
Or is it okay, but probably feeling that, yeah, based on past trends in history and all that, even though they're doing a little better,

03:15:42.441 --> 03:15:42.701
Right.

03:15:42.781 --> 03:15:43.181
Not enough.

03:15:43.402 --> 03:15:59.910
And I think that, yeah, I think that that is more the case in terms of it's a one look shot in October and like, OK, so you've gotten some things into place, but it doesn't outweigh or doesn't even come up to what we actually need the school to be doing internally.

03:15:59.930 --> 03:16:00.990
OK, thank you.

03:16:01.010 --> 03:16:02.271
That's that's what I was trying to get at.

03:16:02.771 --> 03:16:09.216
And then can I just get the chronic absenteeism from the petitioners?

03:16:09.296 --> 03:16:12.278
And then I have a question around the fundraising.

03:16:14.611 --> 03:16:14.851
Hi.

03:16:15.612 --> 03:16:18.554
So we recognized our chronic absenteeism.

03:16:19.374 --> 03:16:23.437
As Ingrid shared before, year four was really, really challenging for us.

03:16:23.517 --> 03:16:25.198
At that point, I was the assistant principal.

03:16:26.259 --> 03:16:27.920
We had our principal step down.

03:16:28.020 --> 03:16:33.824
And as she had mentioned, our founder CEO stepped down for medical reasons and has recently passed away.

03:16:33.844 --> 03:16:43.210
And when our new principal had stepped in, and I was the assistant principal at that time, she actually stepped down because of a high-risk pregnancy.

03:16:44.202 --> 03:16:46.543
and I stepped into the principal role last year in November.

03:16:47.283 --> 03:16:55.985
I've been with One Purpose since we opened, but a lot of that change in leadership, as I'm sure you all know, is really, really complex, which impacted our absenteeism.

03:16:56.005 --> 03:17:10.709
So what we're doing this year moving forward is we had meetings with families leading into the year before we even started in regards to absenteeism and helping our families find ways to have their students come to school regularly and on time.

03:17:11.829 --> 03:17:15.111
and we've worked with individual families to create specific plans.

03:17:15.751 --> 03:17:26.155
We've also worked with our wraparound services team and so partnering with Seneca Family Ed agencies, our clinician, and our mental health counselors to support families attending school.

03:17:26.195 --> 03:17:32.397
We're having SARB meetings bi-weekly and continuing to send letters home and hold meetings and ways to support

03:17:32.817 --> 03:17:34.118
our families with absenteeism.

03:17:34.178 --> 03:17:42.064
We've also created a positive reinforcement system for individual students and school-wide, where students are earning rewards based on attendance as well.

03:17:43.785 --> 03:17:52.972
And just to give the board community context, Mike had mentioned Brett Hart also went in a decline too.

03:17:53.172 --> 03:17:56.655
Well, we are dealing with some community issues right there.

03:17:56.835 --> 03:18:00.718
Most of our students come from a particular housing site, which is Alice Griffith.

03:18:01.318 --> 03:18:03.662
which also underwent displacement.

03:18:03.722 --> 03:18:05.405
So we lost some families.

03:18:05.825 --> 03:18:09.551
As you can see, Brett Hart is gaining some families back because some of them are coming back.

03:18:09.891 --> 03:18:16.842
But during that school year, not only did One Purpose go through its transition, but the community went through a very traumatic

03:18:17.962 --> 03:18:22.645
transition to where people were displaced and then put into a new system.

03:18:22.725 --> 03:18:28.248
If you open up the newspaper today, you could see how that community is still grappling with that transition.

03:18:28.368 --> 03:18:35.771
So we as a community partner and trying to be a stabilizer in the community also had to deal with that as well.

03:18:35.851 --> 03:18:40.494
So we lost some stuff during the move and it happened in the middle of the school year.

03:18:41.420 --> 03:18:47.248
And we have seen more engagement this year than we have, specifically with our school events as well.

03:18:47.268 --> 03:18:53.077
And we have, at our most recent parent-teacher conference, 84% of our families attended.

03:18:57.020 --> 03:18:58.521
And I can answer the fundraising question.

03:18:58.601 --> 03:18:59.702
Okay, yeah, if he could please.

03:18:59.742 --> 03:19:08.567
I was curious of the nature and where the fundraising is coming from because your budget is solid because of that fundraising, but you can't rely on it.

03:19:09.427 --> 03:19:17.452
And so, and I understand that, you know, you're going to get increase, you have a plan to increase students, all that, but I'm curious where that funding is coming from.

03:19:17.892 --> 03:19:20.994
So the private funding that we receive is

03:19:22.114 --> 03:19:25.476
a lot of it is raised through connections that our board has.

03:19:25.576 --> 03:19:34.602
So we have a very thorough fundraising program that involves reaching out directly to people through direct mail.

03:19:35.142 --> 03:19:40.585
We have tours of the school where donors come, see the school, and make donations that way.

03:19:40.645 --> 03:19:42.967
We have a spring event.

03:19:43.047 --> 03:19:45.168
We had our spring event last week that raised $350,000.

03:19:48.470 --> 03:19:52.452
And then we also solicit funds through private foundations as well.

03:19:53.153 --> 03:19:56.274
So we have a robust fundraising network.

03:19:56.294 --> 03:19:57.075
So we have myself.

03:19:57.115 --> 03:20:01.377
We also have worked with a development consultant as well.

03:20:02.097 --> 03:20:06.600
And then we have board members working a lot on reaching out to their contacts as well.

03:20:06.940 --> 03:20:09.861
And we've really spread out our fundraising.

03:20:09.921 --> 03:20:13.163
So we're not solely reliant on one or two large funders.

03:20:13.243 --> 03:20:14.504
And if that funding drops out,

03:20:14.944 --> 03:20:18.628
then our fundraising budget drops significantly.

03:20:19.108 --> 03:20:22.011
On any given year, we have about 300 donors.

03:20:22.091 --> 03:20:24.573
So we've spread out the fundraising.

03:20:24.613 --> 03:20:36.484
So if a donor, if, say, a foundation changes their priorities and is no longer funding charter schools, for instance, and we're not receiving that funding anymore, we can make up for that in different areas because we have a diverse group of supporters.

03:20:40.595 --> 03:20:45.680
So first, I don't want to thank the community and parents that came today and the board.

03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:55.350
I mean, I really hear a strong commitment to the Bayview and to continue to provide a nurturing site, even though it's a very small group of students right now.

03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:59.374
And I think the structure of the wraparound services and the

03:20:59.914 --> 03:21:05.217
coaches and professional development, the thinking around that structure seems solid to me, and the service.

03:21:05.237 --> 03:21:15.224
When I look at the chronic absenteeism, which I share with most of us that that's a concern, I also see that Bret Hart was really high on that comparable list too, and that's the community.

03:21:15.284 --> 03:21:24.029
So I recognize that all the schools compared have read in their chronic absenteeism, so something that obviously is an area that they're addressing.

03:21:25.069 --> 03:21:30.072
It is a small number of kids.

03:21:32.553 --> 03:21:42.518
I counted at least three or four changes with the CEO on the several different principles, and we know that stability of leadership makes a really big difference.

03:21:42.558 --> 03:21:49.822
I appreciate the stepping up the assistant principal and the work that you are trying to do, but how hard that is when the founder lays the foundation

03:21:50.863 --> 03:21:56.148
the mission, everyone comes there and then he gets sick and is lost.

03:21:56.749 --> 03:22:03.877
I recognize that that is a predictor for lack of stability and it is too bad for the community and for the kids that were there.

03:22:05.438 --> 03:22:07.120
The other comment I wanted to make about

03:22:08.021 --> 03:22:16.509
You know, I think we've talked before as a board about sometimes we wish we could give a two-year renewal with conditions and not a five-year and I know that changes but not yet.

03:22:17.090 --> 03:22:26.939
And I wish we had a shorter, if we had that as an option, I think that would help because I think the commitment is there.

03:22:26.959 --> 03:22:30.343
I appreciate the board, the fundraising is amazing for such a small

03:22:30.903 --> 03:22:37.945
population that the community has and I know the Bayview really depends on strong supportive schools for their community.

03:22:39.166 --> 03:22:44.327
So those are just sort of the highlights of my comments on my notes that I made.

03:22:47.748 --> 03:22:51.069
Yeah, I have a question for Stephanie on the governance structure.

03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:56.731
You had mentioned there was a conflict of interest there.

03:22:58.072 --> 03:22:59.072
Couldn't you say more about that?

03:23:15.219 --> 03:23:17.160
Well, Stephanie, while you're doing that, I have a question.

03:23:18.721 --> 03:23:25.904
What I normally see as I read the letters of support is multiple letters of support.

03:23:26.184 --> 03:23:28.925
Am I correct in that there's only one letter of support?

03:23:38.029 --> 03:23:41.570
All the letters of support that we received are in your mailbox.

03:23:42.451 --> 03:23:43.011
That's what we have.

03:23:44.164 --> 03:23:50.270
Okay, so it just concerns me that I don't see a letter of support from the California Charter Schools Association.

03:23:52.472 --> 03:23:54.173
So I just want to point that out.

03:23:54.954 --> 03:23:55.454
I don't see that.

03:23:55.835 --> 03:24:01.700
But can I see, you had mentioned conflict of interest, and I just wanted to know a little bit more about that.

03:24:07.025 --> 03:24:10.010
some of the governance issues that that came about.

03:24:10.831 --> 03:24:14.958
And I'm just so you can follow along if you want to.

03:24:15.058 --> 03:24:16.901
I'm on an attachment one on page 25 and 26.

03:24:22.085 --> 03:24:29.456
So there were some issues with the fact that in part of their governance structure, there should be a CEO.

03:24:29.496 --> 03:24:31.719
They did not have a CEO for a long time.

03:24:31.759 --> 03:24:37.227
The principal was being the CEO of the corporation.

03:24:39.930 --> 03:24:53.523
And as the board appoints and removes corporate officers, fixes their compensation, it seemed like that could be a potential conflict of interest with the principal actually acting as a CEO in terms of being on the board and also staff of the school.

03:24:54.885 --> 03:25:01.391
Also, and then one thing I didn't mention before, and this is something that

03:25:02.832 --> 03:25:19.701
is big, you know that now all charter schools are required because of SB 126 to follow all of the Governance and Public Records Act and Political Reform Act and Conflict of Interest Act and they did not have that anywhere in their petition.

03:25:20.421 --> 03:25:25.064
So that was under the governance issue was another concern for us.

03:25:30.215 --> 03:25:35.677
First, I also want to thank all those that have come before us today, in particular Yahaisu.

03:25:36.638 --> 03:25:46.402
Your voice does count, and sometimes adults have to make tough decisions, but know that you're a very smart boy, and thank you for coming, and I'm sure you're going to do great things in life.

03:25:47.982 --> 03:25:51.124
I have an observation and then a question.

03:25:51.464 --> 03:25:55.045
My observation was also the fundraising and it was very impressive.

03:25:56.026 --> 03:26:05.189
But I also wonder how that could be the one consistent thing that didn't suffer when all the transitions were happening with the school, right?

03:26:05.209 --> 03:26:11.792
There was leadership transitions, there's low enrollment, at no point was the enrollment targets hit.

03:26:12.452 --> 03:26:24.103
but yet there has been consistent fundraising and I am wondering if maybe it would have benefited the school to redirect some of their attention to those areas where you knew you were falling a little short.

03:26:25.026 --> 03:26:27.268
My question is about the TK.

03:26:27.448 --> 03:26:31.312
And I heard that one year there was no TK enrollment.

03:26:31.492 --> 03:26:41.021
And I'm wondering if the original charter school identified TK as one of the grade levels, because I don't believe this school came before us for a material revision.

03:26:41.041 --> 03:26:44.504
So I'm wondering if TK was part of the original proposal.

03:26:49.246 --> 03:26:50.746
That would be for our charter folks.

03:26:51.107 --> 03:26:52.047
That's for CDE.

03:26:52.687 --> 03:26:53.387
That's for CDE.

03:26:54.128 --> 03:26:57.989
Was their original proposal, did it include TK?

03:26:59.029 --> 03:27:00.650
And I know, I'm sorry, I know you're frustrated.

03:27:00.730 --> 03:27:04.551
We'll get a chance to get back to the charter school, but this is for our own people.

03:27:05.651 --> 03:27:12.213
Yeah, the original charter that was approved in January of 2015, I believe it was, did include TK.

03:27:16.768 --> 03:27:26.916
So not implementing, not recruiting a TK class one year, would that not be a material revision that they would have had to come before the board to not enroll that grade level?

03:27:29.142 --> 03:27:30.623
That could be true, yes.

03:27:31.103 --> 03:27:38.848
I think the problem that they had ran into is that they were not given a Prop 39 agreement that would allow for an extra classroom for TK.

03:27:39.629 --> 03:27:48.895
And I do believe that with the past leadership in the charter schools division allowed them to do that for just the one year.

03:27:59.366 --> 03:28:06.609
I know the school is eager to clarify something, so is it okay if they come up and do that clarification?

03:28:16.425 --> 03:28:21.527
The CEO position was not filled when our CEO departed the school.

03:28:22.047 --> 03:28:32.511
We were in constant conversations with CDE staff about our lack of having a CEO because we understood and could read our bylaws and our charter, which indicated that we had to have a CEO.

03:28:35.339 --> 03:28:38.343
The CEO never served on the board of directors.

03:28:38.443 --> 03:28:40.946
That was never a part of our bylaws or the charter.

03:28:42.147 --> 03:28:49.436
When our principal took over the running of the school, our principal did not become the CEO of One Purpose.

03:28:51.189 --> 03:28:51.509
I was.

03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:57.071
As board chair, I essentially was in charge of the school.

03:28:57.211 --> 03:29:05.975
I don't believe there was a conflict of interest and the board certainly has always maintained the ability, though not the desire, to hire and fire Annie Shiblett.

03:29:07.594 --> 03:29:26.222
In terms of fundraising question that you asked about the constancy of our ability to fundraise, the Board is very proud of the fact that we stepped in more than a Board should ever step in with the running of an organization, non-profit or for-profit.

03:29:27.042 --> 03:29:33.244
We are very proud that we were able to participate and help the school through the difficult transitions.

03:29:34.164 --> 03:29:41.026
That did not preclude us from asking questions and trying to be involved in the program side.

03:29:45.808 --> 03:29:51.470
items that have documented the programs and the fundamental steps we have taken to try to turn the program around.

03:29:52.611 --> 03:29:54.012
One was not dependent on the other.

03:29:54.052 --> 03:29:55.392
There was enough time for both.

03:29:56.433 --> 03:29:59.574
Frankly, fundraising was easier than turning the program around.

03:30:14.967 --> 03:30:23.477
Just to clarify, is the plan to increase academic achievement just to increase research-based learning?

03:30:23.637 --> 03:30:25.679
Was that the only piece that was mentioned?

03:30:31.206 --> 03:30:34.828
So we have adopted new curriculum this year that was research-based.

03:30:34.848 --> 03:30:39.211
So originally, we were using project-based learning model with research-based curriculum.

03:30:39.231 --> 03:30:44.274
And we realized that our students weren't getting as much as they needed with project-based learning.

03:30:44.314 --> 03:30:47.976
And so now we're implementing our research-based curriculum that was adopted.

03:30:48.916 --> 03:30:50.938
This year, we're in the implementation model.

03:30:51.598 --> 03:30:56.401
And then we also have six weeks intervention cycles for ELA and math.

03:30:56.961 --> 03:30:58.483
for our scholars who are behind.

03:30:58.543 --> 03:31:13.236
And so what we have observed within our six weeks intervention cycle is that our first cycle, which I know this data is kind of irrelevant in the sense of the way that the vote is made, but 100% of our students made progress

03:31:15.638 --> 03:31:17.279
at the rate of their peers.

03:31:17.719 --> 03:31:27.142
And then within that intervention cycle, 47% of our scholars made three or more levels grow specifically in the area of reading, which is showing that they're making accelerated growth.

03:31:27.202 --> 03:31:30.723
And so we are continuing to initiate intervention cycles.

03:31:30.763 --> 03:31:35.805
We'll have four this year to continue to show increase in our student achievement.

03:31:35.825 --> 03:31:38.746
And so with that, we go through that process.

03:31:38.766 --> 03:31:42.467
We also have the coordination of services team, which is similar to an SST model.

03:31:43.448 --> 03:31:55.608
However, within that model, we do have our Seneca providers there as well, and so it's really a wraparound support team to ensure that we are moving forward with the correct protocols around special education as well.

03:31:57.581 --> 03:32:00.882
Since you're here, I'd like to add a couple more questions if that's okay.

03:32:02.523 --> 03:32:07.865
Another area of concern was the rate of suspension, particularly for black students.

03:32:07.925 --> 03:32:12.947
It was on the dashboard, even though there's a social-emotional learning component.

03:32:12.967 --> 03:32:15.288
I was wondering what's happening with respect to that.

03:32:15.908 --> 03:32:18.590
So I really believe in unconditional education.

03:32:18.670 --> 03:32:22.152
I'm a former Seneca employee, and I transitioned over to One Purpose.

03:32:22.732 --> 03:32:29.456
And so we are doing everything to ensure that our students are not being suspended in their accessing curriculum in school this year.

03:32:29.476 --> 03:32:32.038
And so our suspension has definitely decreased.

03:32:33.079 --> 03:32:40.123
And we have, with the Wellness Center, we've just observed, in general, a decrease in our discipline data.

03:32:42.024 --> 03:32:52.254
At the ACCS meeting we showed a specific slide, I don't have it here today, in regards to our improvement on office discipline referrals and it is reduced tremendously.

03:32:52.334 --> 03:32:56.739
I'm pretty sure it was about nine students a day were receiving office discipline referrals in the fall.

03:32:57.219 --> 03:33:01.781
of 2018 and then in the fall of 2019 we ended up at around two students a day.

03:33:02.161 --> 03:33:17.267
So our entire culture and climate of the school in general has shifted and I think just allowing students opportunity and space in the Wellness Center and also having staff there to provide social emotional learning supports has really really shifted our even the conversations around suspension.

03:33:23.660 --> 03:33:41.147
Not so much a question, I think a statement to what Member Rucker said at the get-go that when we are looking at these charters, we really need to look at not one over the other, but do our due diligence in each one of these charters.

03:33:41.327 --> 03:33:43.228
I have tried to do that in looking at this.

03:33:44.268 --> 03:33:59.707
And I think I'm conflicted on this particular one because I think the mission is strong and there's definitely dedication, commitment on the part of the board and the folks who are involved in the school.

03:34:01.008 --> 03:34:15.156
However, I think as Member Navo pointed out, looking beyond the numbers, I need to hear a compelling reason, a really compelling reason when the numbers don't look good as to why you should keep the school open.

03:34:15.936 --> 03:34:25.701
And I'm not feeling the sense of the community coming out and supporting the school or if you have so much fundraising and so much support on the

03:34:27.242 --> 03:34:28.363
Fundraising side of it.

03:34:28.684 --> 03:34:34.670
Why are we not seeing the belief in the mission and the support in letters and other other areas?

03:34:35.151 --> 03:34:40.736
So this one I think this is what differs this one for me versus the other.

03:34:52.176 --> 03:34:54.858
Seeing none, do I have a motion?

03:34:56.279 --> 03:35:00.322
I move the CDE recommendation to deny the renewal of one purpose school.

03:35:01.342 --> 03:35:02.963
Is there a second for that motion?

03:35:02.983 --> 03:35:05.965
I'll second.

03:35:06.966 --> 03:35:10.128
All right we have a motion a second is there any further discussion?

03:35:10.148 --> 03:35:15.972
All right all in favor of the motion as stated say aye.

03:35:16.893 --> 03:35:17.013
Aye.

03:35:17.593 --> 03:35:18.374
Any opposed?

03:35:20.009 --> 03:35:20.890
Any abstentions?

03:35:20.910 --> 03:35:23.671
I think we need to see a count.

03:35:24.671 --> 03:35:26.112
So please raise your hand.

03:35:26.192 --> 03:35:29.074
All in favor of the motion as stated, please raise your hand.

03:35:29.194 --> 03:35:32.595
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

03:35:33.376 --> 03:35:34.957
And I think that's it, because you don't vote.

03:35:35.097 --> 03:35:36.457
Okay.

03:35:36.958 --> 03:35:40.760
We have to have a minimum of six, so when it's quiet, we need to be sure.

03:35:42.120 --> 03:35:42.761
Thank you very much.

03:35:42.801 --> 03:35:47.263
We do appreciate all the people who came out and the work that you've done in that school.

03:35:53.700 --> 03:36:21.851

03:36:23.168 --> 03:36:24.949
Good afternoon, members of the board.

03:36:25.430 --> 03:36:28.252
I'm here on behalf of the California Emerging Technology Fund.

03:36:28.832 --> 03:36:34.196
That is a statewide nonprofit organization with the mission of closing the digital divide across California.

03:36:34.857 --> 03:36:51.509
I am in charge of our school to home initiative, which is a strategic initiative focused on supporting underserved middle schools with the integration of technology so that they could be very purposeful in not only closing the digital divide, but also the achievement gap

03:36:51.929 --> 03:37:03.994
We do this by providing a different levels of support, framework of support, consisting of 10 program components, ranging from leadership support, instructional support.

03:37:04.254 --> 03:37:06.174
There's a deep parent engagement.

03:37:06.575 --> 03:37:12.957
There's also various times to when we bring our partner schools together to share best practices.

03:37:13.557 --> 03:37:16.338
This past year, we had a very successful academy.

03:37:16.718 --> 03:37:18.159
We're very honored to have

03:37:18.639 --> 03:37:18.839
Ms.

03:37:18.879 --> 03:37:20.040
Rucker, come and join us.

03:37:20.360 --> 03:37:21.841
We had a great conversation.

03:37:22.221 --> 03:37:23.842
The schools were energized.

03:37:23.902 --> 03:37:25.823
They came out really focused.

03:37:25.863 --> 03:37:27.104
We had a good conversation.

03:37:27.644 --> 03:37:35.748
I'm here to share our program and hoping that we can start a relationship where we can share our tools and resources.

03:37:35.949 --> 03:37:37.429
We're helping the schools.

03:37:37.609 --> 03:37:41.612
We're making progress in the school, but we want to explore how we can

03:37:42.432 --> 03:37:49.981
collaborate so we can impact the numerous other schools that are struggling academically and being effective in their use of technology.

03:37:50.242 --> 03:37:51.203
Thank you very much.

03:37:52.845 --> 03:37:54.267
We do have a number of other speakers.

03:38:00.748 --> 03:38:02.330
Please state your name and affiliation.

03:38:02.490 --> 03:38:06.053
Good afternoon, Dale Marsden, Superintendent of San Bernardino City Unified School Districts.

03:38:06.093 --> 03:38:08.896
This will be my last time in this capacity speaking to the State Board of Eds.

03:38:08.956 --> 03:38:10.337
It's a pleasure to be here again.

03:38:10.738 --> 03:38:19.626
We brought some student board members with you and as you followed our trajectory the last eight years, we've had our students' performance in high school graduation rate was in the low 60s.

03:38:20.027 --> 03:38:22.709
We're now over 90% graduation rate, over 50%

03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:26.411
career pathways, double the number of students ready for college.

03:38:26.571 --> 03:38:40.295
Our pathways are built, I said on the workforce board, are built using predictive analytics and back mapping those to create 50 career pathways and our students are now involved not only in those pathways from elementary to middle to high school but also

03:38:40.855 --> 03:38:47.660
continuing on to Generation Go in full paid internships for our students in partnership with the Workforce Development Board.

03:38:48.340 --> 03:38:52.663
We've seen incredible outcomes for our students participating in this internship program.

03:38:53.263 --> 03:38:56.425
50% of the students are getting employed.

03:38:57.306 --> 03:39:02.049
Over 75 to 85% are going on to two and four year college experiences.

03:39:02.089 --> 03:39:04.110
We're very excited about the future for them.

03:39:04.130 --> 03:39:09.194
We're excited about the student voice component in our school district as you see our students here.

03:39:09.854 --> 03:39:10.775
We want to thank Ms.

03:39:10.815 --> 03:39:12.155
Ortiz-Licon and Ms.

03:39:12.175 --> 03:39:19.999
Sandoval for your support on the State Board of Ed, and such a pleasure to be before you and excited about the opportunities for our students.

03:39:20.039 --> 03:39:22.360
I'll let them speak and use the remainder of our time together.

03:39:23.817 --> 03:39:29.583
Hi I would just like to speak on behalf of our pathways.

03:39:29.623 --> 03:39:39.793
Just last week I was able to visit Cajon high school, Norton elementary school and Curtis middle school just to see what they are working on with our different pathways.

03:39:40.254 --> 03:39:44.558
An eye-opener for me was to see the elementary kids, their learning area and

03:39:44.898 --> 03:40:01.945
Perimeter they may not use that mathematical lingo, but they are learning that and so I figured that That basis is so extraordinary because in elementary I was not doing that and when they get to middle school in high school it'll be so easy for them to just hop along because they already have that basis of that knowledge and

03:40:02.886 --> 03:40:18.458
At Cajon, they have so many pathways from machining to craftsmanship, building boats, racing boats, and it's just crazy how much potential these kids have in that our district is allowing them to unleash that potential and just go and soar with their future careers and find a passion that they love.

03:40:18.978 --> 03:40:22.901
Thank you.

03:40:22.941 --> 03:40:23.782
My name's Vanessa.

03:40:24.683 --> 03:40:26.084
I go to Arroyo Valley High School.

03:40:34.145 --> 03:40:39.131
So personally, my high school has, I think, about maybe seven pathways.

03:40:39.211 --> 03:40:45.019
There is VAPA Academy, Visual and Performing Arts, CORE Academy, they emphasize helping the environment.

03:40:45.399 --> 03:40:47.961
There is business and logistics, there is national security.

03:40:48.421 --> 03:40:53.285
I'm in global leadership, so that is basically like 2.0 for AVID.

03:40:54.165 --> 03:40:58.929
And so the first two years is you do NYP, so it's just like the honors courses.

03:40:59.029 --> 03:41:01.510
And then you get to decide whether you do AP or IB.

03:41:02.331 --> 03:41:04.432
And it's been a really good experience for me.

03:41:04.513 --> 03:41:07.755
And personally, I have always tried to like

03:41:08.755 --> 03:41:20.400
keep it going, and I know there's a lot of students that struggle with their mental health, so I've always advocated a lot for kids to get the help with their mental health so that they can keep on track with all their schoolwork.

03:41:24.710 --> 03:41:26.171
Hello, my name is Eric Morales.

03:41:26.211 --> 03:41:40.961
I would like to express it is our great pleasure to have had the opportunity to speak before you all today and give you guys our gratitude for having been so supportive of the career pathways and the local control funding formula.

03:41:44.203 --> 03:41:50.090
I'd also like to emphasize the importance of programs like Generation Go for the students in our community.

03:41:51.712 --> 03:41:58.559
Lastly, I can proudly say on behalf of all the students in San Bernardino City Unified that you guys are doing an exquisite job and thank you guys for having us.

03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:07.460
Good afternoon.

03:42:07.500 --> 03:42:08.480
How do you follow that, right?

03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:10.821
So I'm Ginger Antoveros.

03:42:10.841 --> 03:42:15.101
I'm the Executive Director of Community Engagement for San Bernardino City Unified School District.

03:42:15.541 --> 03:42:20.742
And I just want to emphasize as well the value of the local control funding formula.

03:42:20.822 --> 03:42:35.725
Not only has it made incredible outcomes in our district, you've heard the outcomes from Dr. Marsden, really increasing our graduation rate, doubling our A to G college preparation rate, giving our kids really powerful opportunities to connect with the community.

03:42:36.385 --> 03:42:53.577
But it's also served as a catalyst to help our community come together in a program called Uplift San Bernardino, helping us through a collective impact model to really embrace the success that our kids can have locally so that they can stay and be part of transforming a community that right now is living in poverty.

03:42:54.037 --> 03:43:04.404
And so we really want to thank you for that investment and that trust in our local leadership and putting the investments where they're needed to change our own communities and the trajectory of our children's lives.

03:43:04.484 --> 03:43:06.025
So thank you for the work that you do.

03:43:06.967 --> 03:43:08.411
Thank you very much.

03:43:10.029 --> 03:43:17.335
Thank you guys for, yeah, I just wanna thank you guys for coming all the way and giving us such an uplifting end to our meeting.

03:43:17.496 --> 03:43:18.496
Thank you so much.

03:43:18.577 --> 03:43:22.880
So I just have to say, I have seen these pathways and schools in action in San Bernardino.

03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:34.310
I've been very fortunate to visit several times, and this is really, truly in action, an amazing turnaround, and I just wanna thank Superintendent Marsden and the team for coming, and what a nice ending to our two-day meeting.

03:43:34.651 --> 03:43:36.993
Just thank you for taking the time to come over and talk to us.

03:43:46.238 --> 03:43:47.520
I also want to thank you.

03:43:47.560 --> 03:43:48.761
There are three board members.

03:43:53.127 --> 03:44:00.897
We sit together along with the community college board of directors on the California joint workforce pathways advisory committee.

03:44:01.357 --> 03:44:24.329
We have heard from a lot of programs about the work that they are doing and I would be thrilled if we would have an opportunity to hear more about your success and hear more about your pathways program because we're beginning the work now of creating a statewide plan for CTE and I think a lot of what you all have done with your successes would inform that conversation.

03:44:24.369 --> 03:44:27.771
So I'm hoping that in some way we'll be able to see you

03:44:28.311 --> 03:44:29.191
at a future meeting.

03:44:29.211 --> 03:44:35.952
So congratulations first of all, you students represented your schools well and I appreciate getting that A grade.

03:44:36.792 --> 03:44:52.275
I also want to say just as it relates to the representative from the California Emerging Technologies Fund, I really would like to encourage board members if you have not had a chance to visit their program or to observe or listen to some of their participating partners.

03:44:52.675 --> 03:44:56.896
This is a program that's doing the work that we expect in the LCAP

03:44:57.256 --> 03:45:07.082
with creating partnerships, creating true stakeholder engagement, and moving from the school into homes to help engage parents in the support of their children.

03:45:07.422 --> 03:45:12.325
So again, this is another program I'm hoping we have the opportunity to hear and learn more about.

03:45:12.725 --> 03:45:19.870
I was very excited by the academy I had a chance to participate in and attend, and I hope that's something else we get to learn more about.

03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:23.572
So I'm very thankful that the board supported my ability to go to that.

03:45:24.053 --> 03:45:24.493
Perfect.

03:45:25.214 --> 03:45:32.982
So we want to close the meeting with a little bit more announcement about where the state is on the situation with COVID.

03:45:33.283 --> 03:45:44.535
There was just a press conference that the governor oversaw, one part of which does note that notwithstanding any other provision of state or local law,

03:45:45.095 --> 03:45:47.096
including the Bagley-Keene or the Brown Act.

03:45:47.596 --> 03:45:59.181
A local legislative body or state body is authorized to hold public meetings via teleconferencing and to make public meetings accessible telephonically or otherwise electronically to members of the public.

03:45:59.221 --> 03:46:00.141
That means us.

03:46:00.822 --> 03:46:04.203
So this may be the last meeting we have in person for a little while.

03:46:05.144 --> 03:46:13.067
So we will all give each other very fond elbow bumps as we leave because we may see each other on Zoom next time.

03:46:13.627 --> 03:46:22.653
And Lisa Costanza is back with us to give us other updates about the progress that's being made with respect to school issues and closings.

03:46:22.773 --> 03:46:23.013
Okay.

03:46:23.233 --> 03:46:34.620
I think the only other thing that I would highlight from the governor's press release today is that he did still continue to reiterate how essential schools are and how essential they are in the communities.

03:46:35.340 --> 03:46:50.612
And he did say if, a big if, if you are moving forward with a decision to close your school, how he really wanted the focus to be around the guidelines that came out on Saturday from the California Department of Public Health.

03:46:51.113 --> 03:46:58.999
And he continues to emphasize that and continues to emphasize the big if and what the implications are to the community.

03:46:59.519 --> 03:47:03.042
And that those decisions need to be made with the local public health department.

03:47:04.002 --> 03:47:07.065
So I think that's the biggest thing I wanted to emphasize.

03:47:07.125 --> 03:47:16.231
He also continued to refer to his guidance that he put out yesterday and exactly with what President Darling-Hammond just mentioned around Bagley-Keene.

03:47:16.711 --> 03:47:23.495
So we will continue to work with them and send out email guidances as we can and as we are ready.

03:47:24.316 --> 03:47:33.282
The one we're working on now is around distance learning and so we will be continuing to update that and have some information hopefully by tomorrow around that topic.

03:47:33.482 --> 03:47:42.155
I know that's a big topic for many school districts, distance learning and independent study options and how to access those.

03:47:42.736 --> 03:47:48.424
So that if schools cannot be physically open, they can be virtually open.

03:47:49.065 --> 03:47:49.445
Correct.

03:47:49.585 --> 03:48:03.295
And we're also talking about how the USDA waiver and providing meals would work along with distance learning and whether that's a pickup location when they come to pick up their meals.

03:48:03.555 --> 03:48:08.939
And it may be as simple as having a paper package available to some students who don't have access.

03:48:09.159 --> 03:48:14.103
So we're working through different scenarios and we'll have some additional guidance here in the next couple of days.

03:48:14.770 --> 03:48:15.171
Thank you.

03:48:15.231 --> 03:48:15.993
Stay tuned.

03:48:16.915 --> 03:48:24.712
I now adjourn the March 2020 meeting of the State Board, and we will see you some kind of way in May.

03:48:24.872 --> 03:48:25.233
Thank you.
