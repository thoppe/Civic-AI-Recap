WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.720
All right, good afternoon, everyone.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.520
Seeing that the board members are now present,

00:06.520 --> 00:10.360
Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish a quorum?

00:10.360 --> 00:11.440
Member Burr.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.160
Here.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.400
President Darling-Hammond.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.680
Here.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.960
Member Fatah.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.240
Here.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.960
Member Glover-Woods.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.360
Here.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.880
Member McQuillan.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.160
Here.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.520
Member Navo.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.080
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.920
Member Rodriguez.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.400
Here.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.520
Member Rucker.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.920
Here.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.520
Vice President Strauss.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.880
Here.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.440
Member Son.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.720
Here.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.320
You have a quorum.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.960
Okay, I hereby call the March 2021 meeting

00:46.960 --> 00:51.080
of the State Board of Education to order at 2.35 p.m.

00:51.080 --> 00:53.840
And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.680
Member Fatah, will you please lead us

00:55.720 --> 00:57.560
in the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:57.560 --> 00:58.400
Yes.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.280
Ready, begin.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.200
I pledge allegiance to the flag

01:07.200 --> 01:09.320
of the United States of America

01:09.320 --> 01:12.280
and to the Republic for which it stands,

01:12.280 --> 01:15.880
one nation, under God, indivisible,

01:15.880 --> 01:18.520
with liberty and justice for all.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.360
Thank you.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.200
Thank you.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.760
And congratulations, Member Fatah,

01:28.760 --> 01:31.240
on the college admissions that are rolling in.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.200
We're looking forward to the final decisions next meeting.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.520
Agenda one is our state board priorities item,

01:40.520 --> 01:44.320
and I will launch us with just a few remarks,

01:46.080 --> 01:48.600
welcoming you to our three-day board meeting.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.200
We haven't had one of those for a while.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.000
We have a lot of ground to cover in these coming days,

01:54.000 --> 01:56.440
so I'm gonna keep these remarks quite short.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.480
It is a milestone that we have recently passed,

02:01.480 --> 02:02.680
and we've turned a corner,

02:02.680 --> 02:04.600
and I think we're heading for a light

02:04.600 --> 02:06.360
at the end of the tunnel.

02:06.360 --> 02:11.360
It's been almost exactly one year since we were together

02:12.680 --> 02:15.280
and since normal personal instruction

02:15.280 --> 02:20.280
across the state ceased as educators, parents,

02:20.600 --> 02:22.920
and students pivoted to distance learning

02:22.920 --> 02:25.720
when we discovered COVID-19 in our state.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.680
And now we give a little bit of guitar music.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.680
I'll wait for that to...

02:38.640 --> 02:39.480
That was nice.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.480
And I think on that note, no pun intended,

02:46.600 --> 02:51.240
we'll just note that we are turning the corner,

02:51.240 --> 02:53.360
and we've learned a lot in this last year.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.880
Our public schools, as you know, have been heroic

02:55.880 --> 02:59.520
in getting meals and technology to students and families

02:59.520 --> 03:01.880
and learning how to teach digitally

03:01.880 --> 03:04.000
and finding ways to wrap around

03:04.000 --> 03:06.640
some of our most vulnerable students.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.480
And meanwhile, we have learned how to test for

03:09.480 --> 03:11.520
and treat this disease and how to vaccinate

03:11.520 --> 03:14.120
against its worst effects,

03:14.120 --> 03:16.240
and vaccinations are now taking place

03:16.240 --> 03:21.160
at a rapidly growing rate with priority for our educators.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.560
Thankfully, along with other essential workers

03:24.560 --> 03:28.440
for seniors, we are at a point where we can expect everyone

03:28.440 --> 03:30.760
to be vaccinated by summer,

03:30.760 --> 03:34.280
and we can celebrate the 4th of July with our families

03:34.280 --> 03:36.080
if we've done so.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.880
And we're seeing the momentum build across the state

03:38.880 --> 03:40.920
with more and more schools announcing plans

03:40.920 --> 03:43.880
for the safe return of students, teachers, and staff

03:43.880 --> 03:48.440
to the classrooms that many have so sorely missed.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.040
The governor announced today that 9,000 schools have opened

03:53.040 --> 03:54.400
or have planned reopening dates

03:54.400 --> 03:56.680
in the coming days and weeks,

03:56.680 --> 03:59.200
and these include the largest and smallest districts

03:59.200 --> 04:02.000
that represent students across the spectrum,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.640
including the students who struggle the most.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.440
But beyond just bringing students back,

04:07.440 --> 04:10.200
the governor and the legislature have made a bold commitment

04:10.200 --> 04:13.000
to ensuring that our schools have the resources

04:13.000 --> 04:15.640
to surround students with the social, emotional,

04:15.640 --> 04:18.400
mental health, and academic support that they need

04:19.400 --> 04:22.480
to thrive now and in a post-pandemic world.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.280
SB 86, which the governor signed on March 5th,

04:27.280 --> 04:31.640
provides $6.6 billion, including $2 billion

04:31.640 --> 04:33.480
to provide resources for schools

04:33.480 --> 04:36.240
to provide in-person instruction this spring,

04:36.240 --> 04:40.320
and $4.6 billion for expanded learning opportunities

04:40.320 --> 04:43.160
that will give schools the funding and the flexibility

04:43.160 --> 04:46.600
to add blocks of learning time throughout the school year

04:46.600 --> 04:48.160
and in the summer.

04:48.920 --> 04:51.960
And the expanded learning resources really offer the schools

04:51.960 --> 04:55.400
the freedom to operate outside the constraints

04:55.400 --> 04:57.640
of the traditional agrarian calendar,

04:57.640 --> 04:58.920
hopefully in partnership

04:58.920 --> 05:03.400
with community-based organizations, boys and girls clubs,

05:03.400 --> 05:07.600
YMCAs, camping organizations, and others this summer

05:07.600 --> 05:09.920
to provide an enriching, engaging,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.560
joyful set of learning opportunities

05:12.560 --> 05:16.000
that hopefully will reattach students to school,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.440
to each other and to their teachers,

05:18.440 --> 05:20.800
and that wrap around them with social and emotional

05:20.800 --> 05:22.560
and mental health supports,

05:22.560 --> 05:26.200
as well as effective academic support and tutoring

05:26.200 --> 05:27.760
to accelerate their learning.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.720
We're hopeful that this can launch us on a path

05:31.720 --> 05:34.960
to re-imagining schools so that they focus on the needs

05:34.960 --> 05:38.200
of the child rather than the clock or the calendar.

05:38.200 --> 05:43.200
And this work is really due to the amazing efforts

05:43.640 --> 05:46.160
of so many in our education community.

05:46.160 --> 05:48.800
In our deliberations over the course of this meeting,

05:48.800 --> 05:51.920
we can support this work with support for useful,

05:51.920 --> 05:55.560
informative assessments, additional funding and guidance

05:55.560 --> 05:57.960
for literacy development and support

05:57.960 --> 06:01.480
for a culturally responsive and sustaining curriculum.

06:01.480 --> 06:05.200
So in advance for the good and hard work,

06:05.200 --> 06:07.720
we will do this work this week

06:07.720 --> 06:10.360
and also thank our entire community of educators

06:10.360 --> 06:13.040
and families for their focus and tenacity

06:13.080 --> 06:15.240
throughout this year of regrouping and rethinking

06:15.240 --> 06:17.680
everything about our education system.

06:17.680 --> 06:20.520
And I look forward to the days ahead

06:20.520 --> 06:24.480
as we return to and reinvent our schools.

06:24.480 --> 06:29.480
And with that, we can launch into our agenda.

06:31.400 --> 06:36.000
There is one item on the agenda that has an addendum.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Item two, the Every Student Succeeds Act,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.080
Authorization to Pursue Flexibility

06:41.240 --> 06:42.280
on our Waiver of Assessment,

06:42.280 --> 06:44.800
Accountability and Reporting Requirements.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.920
There is one public hearing on the agenda,

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
which we will take up tomorrow afternoon.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.160
That is item eight, a petition for the renewal

06:53.160 --> 06:55.040
of a charter school under the oversight

06:55.040 --> 06:57.360
of the local educational agency

06:57.360 --> 06:59.400
designated by the State Board of Education

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
pursuant to California Education Code Section 47605K2E.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.640
And that is the consideration of the Ross Valley Charter,

07:08.640 --> 07:10.200
which was denied by the Ross Valley

07:10.240 --> 07:11.600
Elementary School District.

07:12.440 --> 07:16.680
The proposed regular consent items are items five and six.

07:16.680 --> 07:21.280
The proposed waiver consent items are W2 through W11.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.680
In terms of changes in the agenda,

07:24.680 --> 07:27.400
we will reopen item one on Thursday afternoon

07:27.400 --> 07:29.360
to take up action on the draft meetings

07:29.360 --> 07:33.640
from our February meeting and receive our liaison reports.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.440
In terms of public input,

07:36.440 --> 07:38.320
members of the public wishing to call in

07:38.360 --> 07:40.440
for public comment should view the live stream

07:40.440 --> 07:42.600
of the meeting to know at what time public comment

07:42.600 --> 07:45.040
will occur for each item.

07:45.040 --> 07:48.280
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number,

07:48.280 --> 07:51.240
entering a participant access code,

07:51.240 --> 07:53.840
and then following the operator's prompts.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.520
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.360
The operator will notify callers

07:59.360 --> 08:02.240
when it is their turn to provide public comment.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.400
We will also ask callers to please turn down

08:04.400 --> 08:06.840
the speaker volume of their computers

08:06.840 --> 08:08.760
if they are following the live webcast

08:08.760 --> 08:11.000
to avoid an echoing effect.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.120
Public comment will be limited to one minute

08:13.120 --> 08:14.800
for each speaker.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.840
Item 10 is the general public comment item

08:17.840 --> 08:19.280
during which members of the public

08:19.280 --> 08:21.240
may provide comment on matters

08:21.240 --> 08:25.240
that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.200
Board members, please mute your microphones

08:27.200 --> 08:28.600
when you're not speaking.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.440
Keep your cameras on at all times,

08:30.440 --> 08:32.600
except during the schedule breaks

08:32.600 --> 08:34.360
to ensure that we maintain a form

08:34.360 --> 08:36.600
throughout today's virtual meeting.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.920
If you do need to take a break,

08:38.920 --> 08:42.040
turn off your camera and put a notice in the chat

08:42.040 --> 08:44.320
so that we know who has left.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.400
Try to be mindful that we wanna keep a form at all times,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.320
so try to stagger any momentary breaks

08:50.320 --> 08:53.960
that you need to take during the course of the meeting.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.600
And then for each item on the agenda,

08:55.600 --> 08:57.960
there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand

08:57.960 --> 09:00.040
using the Zoom participant window

09:00.040 --> 09:03.240
if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.280
And with that, we're going to launch into item two,

09:06.280 --> 09:08.120
which is the Every Student Succeeds Act

09:08.120 --> 09:10.440
Authorization to Pursue Flexibility on

09:10.440 --> 09:13.080
or Waiver of Assessment Accountability

09:13.080 --> 09:15.040
and Reporting Requirements.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.000
This item, as I noted, does have an addendum,

09:18.000 --> 09:23.000
and the CDE is proposing that LEAs be allowed

09:24.120 --> 09:26.160
to use the most viable option for assessment

09:26.160 --> 09:27.920
in their local context,

09:27.920 --> 09:31.480
including the Smarter Balanced Summit of Assessments

09:31.480 --> 09:35.240
and Alternative Assessments for ELA and Mathematics

09:35.240 --> 09:38.680
or other diagnostic benchmark or interim assessments.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.600
And I will leave it to Rachel Maves and Mal Vang

09:42.600 --> 09:47.600
to discuss all the details as they present the item.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.720
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.000
Welcome, everyone.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.560
It's good to see you all.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.360
Superintendent Thurman, President Darlene Hammond,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.200
and Board members.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.880
I wanna just start today with a few framing remarks

10:03.880 --> 10:07.160
as we come into this conversation about assessments

10:07.160 --> 10:10.880
once again to help us situate ourselves in the context,

10:10.880 --> 10:13.480
and then we'll go into the item in our slides.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.400
And our hope is that this kind of walks

10:16.400 --> 10:18.280
through the logic process of the proposal

10:18.280 --> 10:20.120
that we're bringing before you today.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.360
First, I just want to acknowledge some things from the heart

10:24.360 --> 10:27.120
as a wise woman once told me.

10:27.120 --> 10:31.320
The pandemic has and continues to shake our world.

10:31.320 --> 10:34.800
Disrupting the ways in which we interact as humans,

10:34.800 --> 10:36.560
while at the same time,

10:36.560 --> 10:39.560
taking the lives of too many loved ones.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.840
In the shaking, it has become clear that the persistent gaps

10:43.840 --> 10:46.240
of inequitable access and opportunity

10:46.240 --> 10:50.400
in our educational systems have become chasms.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.480
While it may seem terribly out of place

10:52.480 --> 10:55.200
to talk about annual assessments right now,

10:55.200 --> 10:57.440
knowing the inequitable opportunities

10:57.440 --> 11:00.960
in our systems pre-COVID intensifies the need

11:00.960 --> 11:03.720
for us to assess and monitor student learning

11:03.720 --> 11:06.360
to ensure we are targeting instruction

11:06.360 --> 11:11.080
to best meet the needs of our most vulnerable students.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.840
In this context, it seems not only appropriate,

11:13.840 --> 11:15.600
but necessary.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.440
Over the course of several months,

11:17.440 --> 11:20.040
we have heard from a number of education leaders

11:20.040 --> 11:24.200
and teachers, the traumatic impact and emotional toll

11:24.200 --> 11:27.040
an entire year of distance learning has had on the lives

11:27.040 --> 11:30.720
of our young people, school staff, and communities.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.280
We also know that every student's experience

11:33.280 --> 11:36.280
has been unique and that different parts of our state

11:36.280 --> 11:39.400
have seen much greater impact than others.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.480
At the same time, advocacy groups and policymakers

11:42.480 --> 11:44.880
are asking for more information

11:44.880 --> 11:47.160
to understand the impacts of the pandemic

11:47.160 --> 11:49.280
on California students.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.840
And parents in California and across the nation

11:52.840 --> 11:55.840
have clearly expressed the need to understand

11:55.840 --> 11:57.720
where their child is meeting

11:57.760 --> 12:00.880
or not meeting grade level expectations.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.440
We have tried to balance all of the concerns

12:03.440 --> 12:06.400
clearly expressed by the field and stakeholders

12:06.400 --> 12:09.480
to develop an approach that recognizes the reality

12:09.480 --> 12:11.760
of education during the pandemic,

12:11.760 --> 12:14.720
the need for educators to have sufficient data

12:14.720 --> 12:17.880
to understand the learning gaps and disparities,

12:17.880 --> 12:20.840
and the desire for parents to have information

12:20.840 --> 12:22.920
regarding their child's learning.

12:22.920 --> 12:27.040
The necessary flexibilities do not come without a cost.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.520
What we gain in allowing LEAs to utilize

12:29.520 --> 12:31.400
their locally chosen assessments,

12:31.400 --> 12:35.200
we lose in the normal comparable test results we get

12:35.200 --> 12:38.720
when all students take the same high quality assessment.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.560
However, we believe it is the best option

12:42.560 --> 12:44.960
during truly imperfect times.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.120
With that, I'd like to turn the presentation

12:47.120 --> 12:50.160
over to Dr. Mao Vang, and she will begin

12:50.160 --> 12:51.720
to walk you through our item.

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
Thank you, Rachel.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.040
Good afternoon, Superintendent Thurmond,

13:05.040 --> 13:08.040
President Arlenham, and Board members.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.560
I am Mao Vang, Director of the Assessment Development

13:10.560 --> 13:12.120
and Administration Division

13:12.120 --> 13:14.840
at the California Department of Education.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.200
The item before you is both an action

13:17.200 --> 13:19.320
and an information item.

13:19.320 --> 13:24.320
And later in my presentation, Rachel Mays will rejoin me

13:25.200 --> 13:30.200
and then we also have present to assist with questions,

13:31.920 --> 13:33.720
Cindy Kazanis, who is the Director

13:33.720 --> 13:37.600
of the Accountability Measurement and Reporting Division,

13:37.600 --> 13:39.880
Jerry Winkler, Director of the Educational

13:39.880 --> 13:43.040
Data Management Division, and Mary Arcella,

13:43.040 --> 13:46.200
Executive Director of Educational Testing Service,

13:46.200 --> 13:48.800
and Tony Alpert, Executive Director

13:48.800 --> 13:51.680
of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

13:52.520 --> 13:57.520
And with that, in today's presentation,

13:58.040 --> 14:01.280
we will be covering the flexibilities offered

14:01.280 --> 14:04.120
from the U.S. Department of Education,

14:04.120 --> 14:07.200
a review of the California State Board of Education

14:07.200 --> 14:11.600
or SBE's actions taken on February 24th,

14:11.600 --> 14:16.600
our California's current context, stakeholder feedback,

14:16.800 --> 14:18.880
and the California Department of Education

14:18.880 --> 14:23.280
or CDE's recommendation to the State Board of Education.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.400
This is a little bit busy,

14:26.400 --> 14:31.400
but we'd like to recap our recommendation for you.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.360
The California Department of Education, CDE,

14:35.360 --> 14:38.480
recommends that the California State Board of Education,

14:38.480 --> 14:41.640
SBE, delegate authority to CDE

14:41.640 --> 14:44.720
and the SBE Executive Director

14:44.720 --> 14:46.880
to prepare a general waiver to be submitted

14:46.880 --> 14:49.000
to the U.S. Department of Education

14:51.080 --> 14:54.320
to the extent necessary to include the following,

14:54.320 --> 14:58.640
that the CDE is proposing that for the 2020-21 school year,

14:58.640 --> 15:02.480
local educational agencies or LEAs be allowed

15:02.480 --> 15:05.720
to use the most viable option for assessment

15:05.720 --> 15:07.800
in their local context,

15:07.800 --> 15:11.040
including the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

15:11.040 --> 15:14.480
and California Alternate Assessments or CAAs

15:15.040 --> 15:19.520
for English Language Arts or ELA and Mathematics

15:19.520 --> 15:24.320
or other diagnostic benchmark or interim assessments

15:24.320 --> 15:29.080
that are aligned with the California Common Core State

15:29.080 --> 15:32.480
standards for English Language Arts and Mathematics

15:32.480 --> 15:36.760
are viable to assess students in grades three through 11

15:36.760 --> 15:40.240
and grades three through eight, excuse me,

15:40.240 --> 15:44.160
and grade 11 are uniformly administered

15:44.240 --> 15:47.560
across a grade span school or district

15:47.560 --> 15:50.920
and provide results that can be reported to parents,

15:50.920 --> 15:54.760
guardians, educators about individual students

15:54.760 --> 15:57.200
and the public by school and by district

15:57.200 --> 15:59.680
that are disaggregated by student group.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.600
As a brief reminder,

16:04.600 --> 16:06.680
we will start today with a quick overview

16:06.680 --> 16:08.240
of the flexibilities offered

16:08.240 --> 16:10.120
by the U.S. Department of Education.

16:11.080 --> 16:16.000
So remember on February 22nd, 2021,

16:16.000 --> 16:18.640
two days before the State Board of Education's meeting

16:18.640 --> 16:23.640
in February, the Ed sent a letter to states indicating

16:24.480 --> 16:28.680
that they can request a waiver to take advantage

16:28.680 --> 16:31.880
of the full flexibilities offered by the Ed

16:31.880 --> 16:35.680
for the 2020-21 school year with accountability

16:35.680 --> 16:37.840
and school identification requirements

16:37.840 --> 16:42.360
in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or ESEA

16:42.360 --> 16:45.680
as amended in the Every Student Succeeds Act or ESSA.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.640
On March 8th, the Ed did release

16:49.640 --> 16:53.720
the accountability waiver template

16:53.720 --> 16:55.400
and states receiving this waiver

16:55.400 --> 16:57.200
would not be required to implement

16:57.200 --> 16:59.680
and report the results of their accountability system

16:59.680 --> 17:04.680
that includes calculating progress toward long-term goals

17:05.320 --> 17:08.560
and measurements of interim progress or indicators

17:08.560 --> 17:11.760
and using data from the 2020-21 school year

17:11.760 --> 17:14.840
to annually differentiate among its public schools

17:14.840 --> 17:15.840
in a meaningful way.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.560
Furthermore,

17:22.880 --> 17:26.840
in addition, the states that are granted the waiver

17:26.840 --> 17:29.240
would not be required to identify schools

17:29.240 --> 17:31.800
for comprehensive support and improvement,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.880
targeted support and improvement

17:33.880 --> 17:35.960
and additional targeted support and improvement

17:35.960 --> 17:39.400
based on data from the 2020-21 school year.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.720
And they would be required to continue to support

17:48.720 --> 17:53.320
to previously identify schools in the 2021-22 school year,

17:53.320 --> 17:57.160
resume school identification in fall 2022,

17:57.160 --> 18:00.520
and ensure transparency to parents and the public.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.480
So as a condition of receiving the waiver,

18:02.480 --> 18:05.080
the states will continue to publicly report

18:05.080 --> 18:09.200
the segregated chronic absenteeism data for 2020-21.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.400
So in addition to the flexibilities previously mentioned,

18:19.400 --> 18:22.400
the Ed letter did indicate that other measures,

18:23.360 --> 18:24.720
indicated other measures

18:24.720 --> 18:27.600
to implement assessment flexibility.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.600
These include administering a shortened version

18:31.600 --> 18:33.840
of its statewide assessments,

18:33.840 --> 18:36.240
offering remote administration where feasible,

18:37.080 --> 18:39.640
feasible and or extending the testing window

18:39.640 --> 18:41.720
to the greatest extent practicable.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.040
So as noted during our previous board meeting,

18:49.040 --> 18:52.480
California in a move to be proactive in meeting

18:55.160 --> 18:58.200
LEAs needs for additional flexibilities

18:58.200 --> 19:00.440
in the midst of this challenging year,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.440
the State Board of Education approved the use

19:02.440 --> 19:03.800
of the adjusted blueprints

19:03.800 --> 19:05.760
for the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

19:05.760 --> 19:08.320
for English Language Arts and Mathematics.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.200
The timing of the approval,

19:10.200 --> 19:14.000
which was in advance of the formal Ed guidance letter,

19:14.000 --> 19:18.120
was required to allow sufficient time for our development

19:18.120 --> 19:21.640
and for the development and implementation

19:21.640 --> 19:25.200
as well as administration of assessments.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.480
So with the SBE's approval in place,

19:27.480 --> 19:32.120
the CDE directed our State Assessment Contractor, ETS,

19:32.120 --> 19:34.000
to implement the adjusted forms

19:34.000 --> 19:35.920
in the California assessment system.

19:36.840 --> 19:41.840
The timeline of activities since November 2020 are as follow,

19:42.960 --> 19:44.840
follows that in November 2020,

19:44.840 --> 19:46.880
the State Board of Education approved

19:46.880 --> 19:50.560
the adjusted Smarter Balanced summative assessments

19:50.560 --> 19:53.000
for English Language Arts and Mathematics blueprints,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.240
so in November through December.

19:56.240 --> 20:00.040
ETS and its subcontractor, Cambian,

20:00.040 --> 20:03.000
removed the original ELA and mathematics forms

20:03.000 --> 20:05.640
from the California assessment system.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.840
And then in January through February,

20:07.840 --> 20:12.680
systems testing with adjusted forms were conducted.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.160
And then on February 22nd, 2021,

20:16.160 --> 20:18.800
the adjusted Smarter Balanced ELA

20:18.800 --> 20:22.960
and mathematics assessments were released to LEAs.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.880
There's been a number of questions.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.760
So I will just pause a little bit here

20:28.760 --> 20:31.800
and just do a quick overview of what we have so far

20:31.800 --> 20:34.560
in terms of testing at this point.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.960
As of today, we do have roughly 14,000

20:38.960 --> 20:42.600
of the Smarter Balanced ELA assessments

20:42.600 --> 20:44.960
in the process of being administered.

20:44.960 --> 20:47.120
There's 8,000 that have started

20:47.120 --> 20:50.200
the Smarter Balanced summative assessments for math.

20:51.160 --> 20:55.200
And then over 11,000 California science tests

20:55.200 --> 20:59.440
that started with over 9,000 completed.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.640
Roughly at this point in time,

21:02.640 --> 21:07.000
there's 294,000 English Language Arts

21:07.000 --> 21:11.160
and then 306,000 mathematics Smarter Balanced Interim

21:11.160 --> 21:14.200
comprehensive assessments administered at this point.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.720
And then from our analysis,

21:17.720 --> 21:21.080
we found that it is clear many districts

21:21.080 --> 21:22.800
are focusing on the administration

21:22.800 --> 21:27.800
of the summative ALPAC with about 42% completed,

21:27.960 --> 21:31.880
representing about over 420,000 English learners

21:31.880 --> 21:33.480
at this point.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.400
And this is approximately two times more

21:36.400 --> 21:40.040
than the number of summative ALPAC administer in 2019,

21:40.040 --> 21:43.400
which was the last year we had a full administration.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.160
And at that time, the ALPAC was still paper pencil test,

21:47.160 --> 21:48.680
the summative ALPAC.

21:48.680 --> 21:53.600
So just to address some questions briefly from the field

21:53.600 --> 21:56.880
to contrast the numbers in a normal year,

21:56.880 --> 22:01.880
like in 2019, our last year of full implementation.

22:02.200 --> 22:06.480
By March 15th, we have about roughly 43,000

22:06.480 --> 22:09.960
Smarter Balanced English Language Arts tests in process

22:09.960 --> 22:14.080
and about 19,000 in math a couple of years ago.

22:14.080 --> 22:17.880
And then over 26,000 California Science tests in progress

22:17.880 --> 22:21.520
and 24,000 completed about two years ago

22:21.520 --> 22:22.720
at this point in time.

22:25.320 --> 22:29.320
And then roughly 370,000 English Language Arts

22:29.320 --> 22:32.480
and 350,000 Mathematics Smarter Balanced Interim

22:32.480 --> 22:35.080
comprehensive assessments were administered

22:35.080 --> 22:38.120
at this time in 2019.

22:38.120 --> 22:41.720
So again, in 2019, the ALPAC was still a paper test

22:41.720 --> 22:45.040
and we estimated that approximately 182,000 students

22:45.040 --> 22:47.360
completed the summative ALPAC

22:47.360 --> 22:49.960
based on the number of student documents

22:49.960 --> 22:53.680
that our testing vendor received at that time.

22:53.680 --> 22:58.600
And then this represented about 18% of our 2019

22:58.600 --> 23:01.520
English learners eligible to take the summative ALPAC

23:01.520 --> 23:03.000
at that time.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.480
So the testing counts for English Language Arts

23:05.480 --> 23:08.400
and Mathematics are slightly lower at this moment

23:08.400 --> 23:10.000
compared to two years ago,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.400
while testing counts for the ALPAC are much higher.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.480
So I just wanted to bring a little recap

23:16.480 --> 23:18.840
so that people could kind of see where we are

23:18.840 --> 23:21.960
in testing at this point while I'm at this juncture.

23:23.640 --> 23:28.400
Then moving forward in terms of continuing on

23:28.400 --> 23:31.040
with the estimated testing times

23:31.040 --> 23:35.200
for our Smarter Balanced Adjusted Forms that were approved.

23:36.040 --> 23:40.120
As noted, we estimated that the adjusted forms

23:40.120 --> 23:43.280
will reduce testing time for English Language Arts

23:43.280 --> 23:46.280
and Mathematics by about one and a half to two hours,

23:46.280 --> 23:48.560
depending on the grade level.

23:48.560 --> 23:50.520
And then we focused on adjusting

23:50.520 --> 23:53.680
the English Language Arts and Mathematics summative tests

23:53.680 --> 23:58.400
because these tests impact the most students

23:58.400 --> 24:00.120
and are also the longest test

24:00.120 --> 24:03.240
compared to the other CASP assessments.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.320
So it's important to note

24:04.320 --> 24:06.880
that the students' tests are not timed.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.040
LEAs have the authority to allow students

24:10.040 --> 24:12.440
to take as much time as they need,

24:12.440 --> 24:16.560
which helps them to demonstrate what they can do

24:16.560 --> 24:18.880
if they could have as much time as they need.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.200
And then students, as they begin to take a test

24:22.200 --> 24:24.360
during a session on a particular day,

24:24.360 --> 24:28.080
they can pause the test and restart it

24:28.080 --> 24:30.360
right where they left off on a different day

24:30.360 --> 24:32.560
in a different session if needed.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.040
And these assessments are not necessary

24:36.040 --> 24:39.080
to complete in one sitting.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.160
So furthermore, the students,

24:41.160 --> 24:44.920
if a student should lose connectivity during a test session,

24:44.920 --> 24:47.400
the progress on their assessment will be saved

24:47.400 --> 24:52.120
and students continue where they left off at a later time.

24:52.120 --> 24:55.120
So trying to think about all these different supports

24:57.840 --> 25:01.840
in terms of helping students to complete assessments,

25:01.840 --> 25:04.080
that's how we came to the adjusted forms.

25:05.160 --> 25:09.160
And in preparation for this adjusted forms,

25:09.160 --> 25:14.160
in fall 2020, we were committed,

25:14.320 --> 25:16.160
the CDE was committed to ensuring

25:16.160 --> 25:17.640
that the flexible options

25:17.640 --> 25:20.120
of the assessment administration,

25:20.120 --> 25:24.280
when it became clear that most LEAs

25:24.280 --> 25:28.320
would not be able to provide

25:28.320 --> 25:30.920
in-person instruction for students.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.120
We were committed to, we heard overwhelmingly

25:34.120 --> 25:37.600
that the field need to

25:37.600 --> 25:42.080
and have us realize the importance

25:42.080 --> 25:43.560
of allowing additional time

25:43.560 --> 25:45.880
to administer the optional summative ALPAC

25:45.880 --> 25:48.040
for reclassification purposes.

25:48.920 --> 25:52.720
The flexible options allow for LEAs

25:52.720 --> 25:57.360
to administer the initial ALPAC starting last summer

25:57.360 --> 26:00.640
and then the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments

26:01.480 --> 26:04.760
where students were in-person or in remote.

26:04.760 --> 26:09.280
And the LEAs did have the option to,

26:11.160 --> 26:13.080
option of testing students in-person

26:13.080 --> 26:16.560
following their local health and safety guidelines

26:16.560 --> 26:20.600
and testing students remotely using our electronic,

26:20.600 --> 26:23.880
the electronics and devices and tools that they did use,

26:25.200 --> 26:28.240
that they are using for distance learning as well.

26:28.240 --> 26:33.240
So these fall administrations led to multiple opportunities

26:33.480 --> 26:37.240
for local educational agencies, the CDE and ETS

26:37.240 --> 26:40.840
to engage in a collaborative discussion

26:40.840 --> 26:43.440
regarding these assessment experience.

26:44.720 --> 26:47.160
So using the feedback from the field,

26:47.160 --> 26:51.360
we further refine and adjusted the processes

26:51.360 --> 26:54.080
in preparation for the spring administration window.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.560
So the feedback gave us a clear understanding

26:57.560 --> 27:00.720
that students must use the secure browser

27:00.720 --> 27:03.520
to take the assessments where,

27:03.520 --> 27:07.160
whether it is in-person or remotely administered,

27:07.160 --> 27:09.920
which provides the appropriate level of test security

27:09.920 --> 27:13.600
allowing us to maintain the assessments validity

27:13.600 --> 27:15.760
and reliability as much as possible.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.840
So this collaborative work resulted

27:18.840 --> 27:22.640
in adding integrated remote administration features

27:22.640 --> 27:25.640
directly into the test delivery system.

27:25.640 --> 27:29.960
The CDE engaged with LEAs and technology companies

27:29.960 --> 27:34.960
such as Google and Apple and Microsoft in development

27:35.800 --> 27:38.960
and testing of these embedded remote administration features

27:38.960 --> 27:42.360
to ensure a platform that is responsive

27:42.360 --> 27:43.800
to the needs of the students

27:43.800 --> 27:47.240
and the test administrators or examiners

27:47.240 --> 27:50.520
as we explore an entirely new process

27:50.520 --> 27:53.600
and landscape for the administration of assessments.

27:56.640 --> 28:01.000
This remote testing functionality

28:01.000 --> 28:03.560
or these remote testing functionalities

28:03.560 --> 28:08.080
include video monitoring, video calling and text messaging.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.920
So the test examiners and test administrators

28:12.920 --> 28:16.800
can view students testing in real time by video

28:16.800 --> 28:19.560
while also monitoring each student's progress

28:19.560 --> 28:21.240
through the tests.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.280
The video feed is similar to the grid of thumbnails

28:24.800 --> 28:27.960
of an online meeting application,

28:27.960 --> 28:29.800
like what we're doing now.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.560
And as in previous administrations,

28:32.560 --> 28:34.920
the test administrator and test examiners

28:34.920 --> 28:37.760
can pause a student's test at any time,

28:37.760 --> 28:39.960
whether they are conducting a remote

28:39.960 --> 28:41.880
or in-person administration.

28:42.960 --> 28:46.440
So the test administrators and examiners

28:46.440 --> 28:49.680
and the student can communicate directly with each other

28:49.680 --> 28:51.480
through the test delivery system

28:51.480 --> 28:56.120
by a one-to-one video call or text message.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.960
Again, test administrators and examiners

28:59.960 --> 29:02.920
can also send out a broadcast message

29:02.920 --> 29:04.920
to all students in the testing session.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.800
So videos showing these remote administration processes

29:09.800 --> 29:12.960
are available on the CASP ALPAC YouTube channel.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.440
And I just want to highlight that it's important to know

29:17.440 --> 29:20.600
that based on the current data for instructional modes,

29:20.600 --> 29:24.960
the majority of LEAs continue to be in distance learning.

29:24.960 --> 29:28.000
So although there are many returning,

29:29.240 --> 29:31.720
there's still the need for distance learning support.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.160
So the remote administration of assessments,

29:34.160 --> 29:37.440
whether we are doing summative, interim,

29:37.440 --> 29:41.320
or local assessments will need to continue to be an option.

29:42.400 --> 29:47.360
CDE and ETS will continue to provide real-time support

29:47.360 --> 29:49.480
for remote administration of the summative

29:49.480 --> 29:52.280
and interim assessments through email.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.760
They could email our California Technical Support Center

29:55.760 --> 30:00.760
at calcaltactacats.org

30:02.200 --> 30:07.200
or phone the 800 number at 800-955-2954

30:08.160 --> 30:13.160
and have live chats at the websites at caaspp.org

30:14.040 --> 30:19.040
and elpac.org, the CASP and ALPAC websites.

30:21.240 --> 30:22.920
So these remote administration

30:22.920 --> 30:26.160
or remote administration was provided

30:26.160 --> 30:28.640
for the optional summative ALPAC in the fall,

30:28.640 --> 30:30.480
as I had mentioned earlier,

30:30.480 --> 30:35.360
and the 2020-21 initial ALPAC in the fall.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.440
And we have a full report of the results

30:39.440 --> 30:41.720
of the psychometric analysis conducted

30:41.760 --> 30:43.760
with the summative ALPAC,

30:43.760 --> 30:47.280
and that is posted on our CDE ALPAC webpage

30:47.280 --> 30:50.280
under our technical documents section

30:50.280 --> 30:53.400
at the link provided in the SBE March item addendum.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.880
So at this point, on the following slides,

31:01.880 --> 31:04.440
I will be recapping the motions that were made

31:04.440 --> 31:07.480
by the SBE on February 24th,

31:07.480 --> 31:10.240
and we will quickly review the five motions.

31:11.200 --> 31:15.200
Here, just to recap, the motion one

31:15.200 --> 31:18.600
was that the SBE directed CDE

31:18.600 --> 31:21.960
to prepare a waiver consistent with the federal template

31:21.960 --> 31:24.240
regarding the flexibilities offered by Ed

31:24.240 --> 31:27.280
for accountability and school identification,

31:27.280 --> 31:30.160
which includes decoupling the accountability

31:30.160 --> 31:31.800
from this year's assessments

31:31.800 --> 31:33.200
and waiving the requirement

31:33.200 --> 31:37.120
that the academic achievement indicator, excuse me,

31:37.120 --> 31:38.640
be adjusted to account

31:38.640 --> 31:43.640
for a participation rate below 95% as applicable.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.920
Motion two was to extend the 2020-21

31:48.760 --> 31:52.040
test administration window for both the CASP and ALPAC

31:52.040 --> 31:55.880
to July 30, 2021 as applicable,

31:55.880 --> 31:58.000
and then motion three direct CDE

31:58.000 --> 31:59.520
to prepare a general waiver

31:59.520 --> 32:01.640
of the California Science Test

32:01.640 --> 32:03.800
for the 2020-21 school year.

32:04.680 --> 32:09.120
Motion four, create a policy means

32:09.120 --> 32:13.160
to provide assessment information for this year

32:13.160 --> 32:16.000
to parents, educators, and the public,

32:16.000 --> 32:19.280
and delegate authority to the State Board of Education

32:19.280 --> 32:23.320
Executive Director in collaboration with CDE staff

32:23.320 --> 32:26.480
to develop a waiver proposal to bring back to the board

32:26.480 --> 32:29.240
that focuses on a plan for assessments

32:29.240 --> 32:32.680
that provide data to parents, educators, and the public,

32:32.680 --> 32:36.400
which monitors the progress of students in ELA and math,

32:36.400 --> 32:39.600
and that will propose a means

32:39.600 --> 32:41.520
for uniform reporting of that data

32:41.520 --> 32:44.280
in both aggregated and disaggregated forms.

32:47.360 --> 32:48.680
Excuse me, sorry, I have.

32:53.720 --> 32:55.960
So I will review the motion,

32:57.480 --> 32:59.200
specifically in motion one,

32:59.960 --> 33:03.960
we have, again, as the,

33:05.160 --> 33:07.680
in terms of the flexibilities,

33:07.680 --> 33:11.800
motion one directed the CDE to prepare a waiver

33:11.800 --> 33:13.880
that is consistent with the template

33:13.880 --> 33:16.800
regarding the flexibilities offered by Ed

33:16.800 --> 33:19.400
for accountability and school identification,

33:19.400 --> 33:22.680
which includes the decoupling and accountability

33:22.680 --> 33:24.880
from this year's assessments,

33:24.880 --> 33:26.400
and waiving the requirement

33:26.400 --> 33:28.280
that the academic achievement indicator

33:28.280 --> 33:30.960
be adjusted to account for participation

33:30.960 --> 33:33.960
below 95% as applicable.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.800
So this action relieves states of the requirement

33:37.800 --> 33:41.800
to identify comprehensive support and improvement,

33:41.800 --> 33:43.320
targeted support and improvement,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.360
and additional targeted support and improvement schools,

33:46.360 --> 33:48.800
and removes the consequences associated

33:48.800 --> 33:51.720
with not meeting the 95% participation rate.

33:52.680 --> 33:56.720
So federal law requires 95% participation rate

33:56.720 --> 34:00.320
in both, participation in both assessment

34:00.320 --> 34:03.440
and accountability at the state, district,

34:03.440 --> 34:06.440
school, and student group levels.

34:06.440 --> 34:11.280
Accountability requirements tied to the 95% participation rate

34:11.280 --> 34:13.880
to the academic achievement indicator.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.800
The Ed waived the tie to the academic achievement indicator,

34:18.800 --> 34:23.800
but not the requirement to assess the 95% of students.

34:24.280 --> 34:28.280
Therefore, the 95% requirements still stands,

34:28.280 --> 34:33.000
but there is no penalty if LEAs are unable to meet it.

34:34.080 --> 34:37.600
So it's important, it is important regardless

34:37.600 --> 34:40.880
of the assessment use that each LEA strive

34:40.880 --> 34:44.120
to ensure each student has the opportunity

34:44.120 --> 34:47.160
to prepare and participate in assessments

34:47.160 --> 34:49.600
to inform teaching and learning.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.560
So the CDE is currently preparing

34:54.320 --> 34:56.280
the accountability waiver template, as I mentioned,

34:56.280 --> 35:00.760
that was released by Ed on March 8th, 2021.

35:00.760 --> 35:04.640
It will submit it to Ed in keeping with the SBE action

35:04.640 --> 35:06.880
at the February meeting.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.560
So to ensure continued alignment

35:10.560 --> 35:13.560
with the federal and state accountability systems,

35:13.560 --> 35:16.200
the next step will be to request legislative action

35:16.200 --> 35:20.480
to remove the state accountability requirements,

35:20.480 --> 35:22.120
and this would include a request

35:22.120 --> 35:25.840
to waive the requirement to produce data indicators

35:25.840 --> 35:28.240
on the California school dashboard,

35:28.240 --> 35:30.720
and pause identification of LEAs

35:30.720 --> 35:33.520
for differentiated assistance based on data

35:33.520 --> 35:37.320
from the 2020-21 school year.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.360
Motion two, the second motion extended

35:43.360 --> 35:46.520
the 2020-21 test administration window

35:46.520 --> 35:51.520
for both the CASP and LPAC to July 30, 2021 as applicable.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.440
So during the SBE meeting on February 24,

35:56.440 --> 35:58.440
the Board discussed three options

35:58.440 --> 36:00.200
regarding the assessment window.

36:01.520 --> 36:06.520
One option was no changes, keep the current regulations,

36:06.960 --> 36:10.120
which state and LEA's CASP assessment window

36:10.120 --> 36:13.760
will end on the last day of instruction,

36:13.760 --> 36:16.760
or July 15, whichever comes sooner,

36:16.760 --> 36:19.000
or for those administering the LPAC,

36:19.000 --> 36:20.400
it would be May 31.

36:21.960 --> 36:25.080
Option two was to extend the window to July 30

36:25.080 --> 36:26.480
for the CASP and LPAC,

36:27.520 --> 36:30.880
or option three was to end the testing windows

36:30.880 --> 36:33.000
per current assessment regulations

36:33.000 --> 36:37.640
and add a new fall summative CASP and LPAC testing window

36:39.320 --> 36:40.520
that could be made available

36:40.520 --> 36:43.600
from about August 15 through October 29.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.280
After careful deliberation,

36:47.280 --> 36:49.160
the Board chose to take action

36:49.160 --> 36:54.160
on extending assessment windows through July 30, 2021.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.080
So to meet this action,

36:56.080 --> 36:59.240
the CDE has prepared emergency regulations

36:59.240 --> 37:01.280
for both the CASP and the LPAC

37:01.280 --> 37:03.720
extending the testing windows,

37:03.720 --> 37:08.720
and this is item five in the March 2021 SBE agenda.

37:11.320 --> 37:14.400
If an LEA's last day of instruction is May,

37:14.400 --> 37:17.240
for example, or beginning in June,

37:18.240 --> 37:20.520
this option will potentially add additional six to eight

37:20.520 --> 37:23.520
weeks to the assessment window.

37:23.520 --> 37:27.600
While the expectation is not to bring students

37:27.600 --> 37:30.520
in over the summer solely to assess,

37:30.520 --> 37:33.480
it provides the opportunity for LEAs to assess students

37:33.480 --> 37:37.440
who are provided targeted instruction over the summer months

37:37.440 --> 37:42.200
in accordance with the California Assembly Bill 86.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.800
If feasible and appropriate,

37:43.800 --> 37:46.680
assessments could be administered during this time.

37:47.720 --> 37:51.200
As discussed during the Board meeting on the 24th,

37:51.200 --> 37:54.840
a decision regarding the extension of the assessment window

37:54.840 --> 37:56.560
needed to be made at that time

37:56.560 --> 38:00.120
to ensure that our contractors could develop

38:00.120 --> 38:04.200
and prepare the necessary infrastructure for administration.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.800
As such, the option for fall administration

38:07.800 --> 38:11.080
or a fall assessment window no longer exists.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.440
The third motion directed the CDE

38:16.440 --> 38:18.280
to prepare a general waiver

38:19.880 --> 38:24.760
of the California Science Test for the 2020-21 school year.

38:24.760 --> 38:29.760
The intent of this SBE motion passed on February 24, 2021

38:29.840 --> 38:33.720
was to waive all statewide science assessments.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.000
This is both the California Science Test

38:37.000 --> 38:40.320
and the California Alternate Assessment for Science.

38:41.360 --> 38:43.280
So with the approval of this motion,

38:43.280 --> 38:46.880
the SBE has directed the CDE to pursue a waiver

38:46.880 --> 38:51.880
to provide additional flexibility from testing to LEAs.

38:52.520 --> 38:53.960
As a reminder,

38:53.960 --> 38:57.560
the administration of statewide science assessments

38:57.560 --> 39:00.680
is required by state and federal laws.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.240
The CDE will prepare requests for waivers

39:03.240 --> 39:04.760
from both state and federal

39:04.760 --> 39:07.560
statewide science assessment requirements.

39:07.560 --> 39:12.560
The fourth and fifth motions are being combined.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.400
Motion four was for the CDE to create a policy means

39:20.400 --> 39:23.560
to provide assessment information this school year

39:23.560 --> 39:25.600
to parents, educators, and the public.

39:26.640 --> 39:28.760
Motion five delegated authority

39:28.760 --> 39:32.000
to the State Board of Education Executive Director

39:32.000 --> 39:34.080
in collaboration with the CDE staff

39:34.080 --> 39:37.440
to develop a waiver proposal to bring back to the board

39:38.280 --> 39:39.760
that focuses on a plan for assessment

39:39.760 --> 39:44.360
that provides data to parents, educators, and the public,

39:44.360 --> 39:46.560
which monitors the progress of students

39:46.560 --> 39:49.120
in English language arts and mathematics,

39:49.120 --> 39:52.400
and that will provide or propose a means

39:52.400 --> 39:54.840
for uniform reporting of that data

39:54.840 --> 39:57.480
in both aggregated and disaggregated forms.

39:58.360 --> 40:02.640
So the CDE is incorporating the response to motion four

40:02.640 --> 40:06.040
as part of the plan outlined in motion five.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.560
The focus of today's item and the recommendation

40:09.560 --> 40:11.240
are to meet the requests

40:11.240 --> 40:12.960
from the State Board of Education

40:12.960 --> 40:14.680
as outlined in this motion.

40:15.960 --> 40:19.040
And with that, I'm going to pause and turn it over

40:19.040 --> 40:22.360
to Rachel Maves, our Deputy Superintendent

40:22.360 --> 40:26.760
of Public Instruction of the Instruction

40:26.760 --> 40:29.000
and Measurement Branch, Rachel.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.640
Thank you, Dr. Vang.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.120
So before we jump into California's current context,

40:34.520 --> 40:36.880
I wanted to just create a little bit of the,

40:36.880 --> 40:38.400
an understanding of the why.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.160
As Dr. Vang laid out, ED provided us,

40:42.160 --> 40:44.960
and I think you heard it at the last board meeting,

40:44.960 --> 40:46.840
and then coming into this board meeting,

40:46.840 --> 40:49.760
some flexibilities that we as California

40:49.760 --> 40:51.520
had already taken advantage of.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.960
We shortened the blueprint,

40:52.960 --> 40:55.600
we provided remote administration,

40:55.600 --> 40:59.280
and we've taken action to extend the assessment we go.

40:59.280 --> 41:01.320
And then the board took it a step further even

41:01.320 --> 41:04.400
by allowing a waiver for a science assessment

41:04.400 --> 41:07.760
and then recognize the need that it still wasn't enough.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.480
There was still more that we were going to have to do.

41:10.480 --> 41:13.480
And as we come into California's current context

41:13.480 --> 41:15.800
and the feedback that we hear from stakeholders,

41:15.800 --> 41:19.400
I think that is something that you will hear very clearly

41:19.400 --> 41:23.200
that in all these efforts that we've made over and beyond,

41:23.200 --> 41:25.680
there's still more that we need to address.

41:25.680 --> 41:28.920
So we're gonna go into California's current context now.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.760
Next slide.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.160
Next slide.

41:37.280 --> 41:38.120
Next slide.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.560
Just a minute.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.400
It did this last time too.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.720
Perfect.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.760
So California, as many of you know,

42:00.800 --> 42:03.440
has the largest and most diverse student population

42:03.440 --> 42:04.800
in the United States.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.560
We have more than 6 million students

42:06.560 --> 42:09.280
that attend kindergarten through grade 12,

42:09.280 --> 42:11.920
and nearly half of these students speak a language

42:11.920 --> 42:14.120
other than English at home.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.560
More than 300,000 teachers work

42:16.560 --> 42:19.240
in approximately 10,000 schools.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.520
And over 1,000 districts with student populations

42:22.520 --> 42:27.000
ranging from four to 590,000 students.

42:27.040 --> 42:31.280
Roughly 4.2 million students are assessed annually.

42:32.520 --> 42:33.360
Next slide.

42:36.440 --> 42:37.920
What we'd like to discuss today

42:37.920 --> 42:39.600
and give you a little bit of a picture,

42:39.600 --> 42:42.080
not only is California a diverse state,

42:42.080 --> 42:44.760
but we are also in the midst of transitioning

42:44.760 --> 42:48.320
from full-time in-person instruction to hybrid

42:48.320 --> 42:51.160
to distance learning only and back and forth.

42:51.160 --> 42:54.480
On January 25th, we began asking districts,

42:54.480 --> 42:55.920
charter schools and private schools

42:55.920 --> 42:59.680
to submit their instructional status by school type.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.920
Consistent with health guidance,

43:00.920 --> 43:03.520
we are seeing more in-person instruction,

43:03.520 --> 43:06.000
full-time and hybrid at the elementary level

43:06.000 --> 43:08.040
than the middle or high school level.

43:08.040 --> 43:09.520
And we're gonna get into some maps here

43:09.520 --> 43:11.280
pretty quickly that show that.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.680
But I think it's important to note

43:12.680 --> 43:17.080
that during the novel coronavirus for 2019 pandemic,

43:17.080 --> 43:19.240
California LEAs have been balancing

43:19.240 --> 43:20.680
the learning needs of students

43:20.680 --> 43:23.440
and the challenges of planning for public safety

43:23.440 --> 43:26.400
while considering their local circumstances.

43:26.400 --> 43:29.280
LEAs have provided instruction through various models,

43:29.280 --> 43:31.120
including in-person instruction,

43:31.120 --> 43:33.240
distance learning and hybrid.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.400
However, a vast majority of students

43:35.400 --> 43:38.600
are not yet attending class in person,

43:38.600 --> 43:41.000
but we're moving in that direction.

43:41.000 --> 43:41.840
Next slide.

43:44.680 --> 43:48.480
What you see before you is the GIS mapping

43:48.480 --> 43:50.720
to display primary mode of instruction

43:50.720 --> 43:52.240
that allows the visualization

43:52.240 --> 43:55.160
of how instruction is being provided across the state.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.360
This is publicly accessible on the California ALL website

43:59.360 --> 44:00.800
for safe schools reopening.

44:01.920 --> 44:05.000
What you're seeing, the dark blue

44:05.000 --> 44:06.560
are the district boundaries

44:06.560 --> 44:10.000
that reflect schools that are in-person,

44:10.000 --> 44:11.440
or districts that are in-person

44:11.440 --> 44:12.800
within the district boundaries.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.600
Hybrid is light blue,

44:14.600 --> 44:17.360
and then yellow is distance learning only,

44:17.360 --> 44:20.720
and the white is no status available.

44:23.240 --> 44:24.160
Next slide, ma'am.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.680
On this side, you'll see that charter schools

44:28.680 --> 44:30.400
are shown by school location.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.320
Again, the dark blue reflects the in-person instruction,

44:33.320 --> 44:35.400
the light blue reflects hybrid,

44:35.400 --> 44:37.440
and the yellow presents distance learning.

44:39.000 --> 44:39.840
Next slide.

44:40.880 --> 44:44.960
On March 8th, we'll begin asking for planned reopening dates.

44:44.960 --> 44:47.440
We are seeing an increase in the number of districts

44:47.440 --> 44:50.120
with planned reopening dates in March and April,

44:50.120 --> 44:54.560
and expect 7,000 schools to be opened by the end of March.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.280
On March 22nd, we will begin collecting

44:57.280 --> 44:58.960
school-level information

44:58.960 --> 45:02.040
by student count pursuant of AB 86.

45:03.680 --> 45:04.520
Next slide.

45:05.640 --> 45:07.720
So in addition to the challenges faced

45:07.720 --> 45:11.120
as LEAs transition back to in-person instruction,

45:11.120 --> 45:13.560
many for the first time in over a year,

45:13.560 --> 45:15.120
for the first time in over a year,

45:15.120 --> 45:18.320
technology also continues to be a barrier.

45:18.320 --> 45:21.800
600,000 to 1 million students do not have access

45:21.800 --> 45:25.280
to quality high-speed internet connectivity at home.

45:25.280 --> 45:30.080
Even despite $2.1 billion of learning loss mitigation funds

45:30.080 --> 45:32.440
were spent on technology.

45:32.440 --> 45:35.640
And based on a recent survey about devices being used,

45:35.640 --> 45:40.640
student, by students, over 376,000 students

45:40.680 --> 45:43.280
are using unmanaged Chromebooks.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.280
This is significant because in a normal year,

45:46.280 --> 45:51.120
96% of all of our assessments happen on Google devices.

45:51.120 --> 45:54.440
Traditionally, students have used and shared devices

45:54.440 --> 45:58.120
that are wheeled around from classroom to classroom

45:58.120 --> 45:59.960
on carts for assessments.

45:59.960 --> 46:01.800
And this year, however, and I would say

46:01.800 --> 46:03.880
it's actually one of the bright spots

46:03.880 --> 46:05.000
that came out of COVID,

46:05.000 --> 46:06.320
the majority of students have,

46:06.320 --> 46:08.800
for the first time in California history,

46:08.800 --> 46:10.680
access to a device.

46:10.680 --> 46:14.200
This feat has been accomplished through the many efforts

46:14.680 --> 46:16.120
of the state of California,

46:16.120 --> 46:18.280
including those of our state superintendent

46:18.280 --> 46:21.840
in his relentless effort to close the digital divide.

46:21.840 --> 46:23.800
And over the course of the past few months,

46:23.800 --> 46:26.720
CDE has worked diligently with our testing vendor

46:26.720 --> 46:28.760
and with Google to secure options

46:28.760 --> 46:31.560
that would allow access to the secure browser

46:31.560 --> 46:33.120
and are in continued discussion

46:33.120 --> 46:35.800
about how we might mitigate these issues.

46:35.800 --> 46:39.040
But again, 376,000 students

46:39.040 --> 46:41.000
are using the unmanaged Chromebooks

46:41.000 --> 46:43.760
and do not have access to the secure browser

46:43.800 --> 46:45.200
without this fix.

46:45.200 --> 46:46.040
Next slide.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.920
So that creates a little bit of the context

46:49.920 --> 46:53.520
of what California is facing in the midst of the pandemic.

46:53.520 --> 46:56.600
We also continue to hear feedback from stakeholders.

46:56.600 --> 46:59.600
Meeting the needs of a state as diverse as California

46:59.600 --> 47:03.200
is complex and nuanced in a normal year.

47:03.200 --> 47:06.040
The previous slides provided us a high level overview

47:06.040 --> 47:08.160
of the current context of our state.

47:08.160 --> 47:10.760
The following slides incorporate the context

47:10.760 --> 47:12.920
from the voice of our stakeholders.

47:12.920 --> 47:13.760
Next slide.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.440
The discussion regarding assessments

47:17.440 --> 47:19.480
has been a dividing factor among groups,

47:19.480 --> 47:22.040
not just in California, but across the nation.

47:23.120 --> 47:25.720
Prior to our meeting on the 24th,

47:25.720 --> 47:28.880
there was a wide range of divergence perspectives

47:28.880 --> 47:30.840
about spring assessments.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.000
On one end, there was a clear cry to waive the requirement

47:34.000 --> 47:37.400
for all statewide assessments for the 2021 school year.

47:37.400 --> 47:39.160
And on the other side, an adamant need

47:39.160 --> 47:41.240
to ensure a clear understanding of the impact

47:41.240 --> 47:43.800
on student learning during the pandemic.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.520
In the last few weeks, there has been a coalescence

47:46.520 --> 47:48.840
around a few common themes.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.920
Recent letters provided the following input.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.120
Across the board, there is a strong interest

47:54.120 --> 47:57.880
in receiving valid data regarding how students have fared

47:57.880 --> 48:01.680
and to identify areas of learning loss or gaps.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.000
Some stakeholders want summative assessments

48:04.000 --> 48:06.920
to inform student learning and address learning loss.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.280
Yet it continues to surface,

48:09.280 --> 48:12.320
we continue to see the issues that are persistent

48:12.320 --> 48:14.440
with bandwidth, internet access,

48:14.440 --> 48:16.880
and inconsistent testing environments,

48:16.880 --> 48:19.960
complicated by efforts to transition students back

48:19.960 --> 48:21.320
to in-person instruction.

48:22.520 --> 48:24.560
Some stakeholders request the suspension

48:24.560 --> 48:26.480
of the requirement for this administration

48:26.480 --> 48:30.040
of the statewide annual standardized summative assessments,

48:30.040 --> 48:33.200
and then others are asking for an option for LEAs

48:33.200 --> 48:36.360
to use local and or interim assessments.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.800
This is where we're starting to coalesce.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.240
Everyone agrees, results should be provided

48:41.240 --> 48:42.560
to parents and guardians,

48:42.560 --> 48:44.560
as well as made publicly available

48:44.560 --> 48:46.680
to the school and LEA level.

48:46.680 --> 48:47.520
Next slide.

48:49.200 --> 48:54.200
Recently, CDE conducted a brief survey asking LEAs

48:55.640 --> 48:57.480
what assessments they had in place

48:57.480 --> 48:59.560
as outlined underneath SB 98.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.880
The survey revealed the following.

49:02.880 --> 49:06.880
We had 969 unique LEAs respond to the survey.

49:06.880 --> 49:10.600
It was administered on March 5th, 2021.

49:10.600 --> 49:14.640
And what we see is that approximately 77% of respondents

49:14.640 --> 49:17.240
indicated that they have used the following five

49:17.240 --> 49:20.360
local assessments during the 2021 school year.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.360
STAR assessments by Renaissance,

49:22.360 --> 49:24.560
iReady by Curriculum Associates,

49:24.560 --> 49:27.600
Measures of Academic Progress by NWEA,

49:27.600 --> 49:29.320
Fast Bridges by Illuminate,

49:29.320 --> 49:32.320
and Reading Inventory by Hoot Mifflin Harcourt.

49:32.320 --> 49:35.920
A little over 60% is comprised of the top three,

49:35.920 --> 49:38.600
STAR, iReady, and MAP.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.480
About 19% of the respondents indicated

49:41.480 --> 49:44.400
that they have used another local assessment.

49:44.400 --> 49:46.280
The majority of those who responded

49:46.280 --> 49:48.200
that they have used other local assessments

49:48.200 --> 49:49.480
indicated that they are using

49:49.480 --> 49:51.600
the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments

49:51.600 --> 49:54.320
or Locally Developed Assessments.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.160
Next slide.

49:57.800 --> 50:01.000
In order to fulfill the request outlined by the Board

50:01.000 --> 50:03.800
in Motion 5, taking into consideration

50:03.840 --> 50:06.080
California's current context,

50:06.080 --> 50:08.440
as well as the feedback provided by stakeholders

50:08.440 --> 50:11.920
across the state, CDE is proposing

50:11.920 --> 50:13.840
that for the 2021 school year,

50:13.840 --> 50:16.800
LEAs be allowed to use the most viable option

50:16.800 --> 50:19.680
for assessments in their local context,

50:19.680 --> 50:22.480
including the Smarter Balanced Semitive Assessments

50:22.480 --> 50:26.760
and CAAs, the alternate assessments for ELA and math,

50:26.760 --> 50:31.000
or other diagnostic benchmark or interim assessments

50:31.000 --> 50:33.320
that are aligned with the Common Core State Standards

50:33.320 --> 50:36.200
for ELA and math are available to assess students

50:36.200 --> 50:38.720
in grades three through eight and grade 11,

50:38.720 --> 50:40.160
are uniformly administered

50:40.160 --> 50:42.600
across a grade span school or district,

50:42.600 --> 50:44.400
and provide results that can be reported

50:44.400 --> 50:46.800
to parents, guardians, educators

50:46.800 --> 50:48.720
about individual students into the public

50:48.720 --> 50:50.320
by school and by district,

50:50.320 --> 50:52.320
and are disaggregated by student group.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.280
Next slide, Mel.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.440
While the proposal presented today

50:58.440 --> 51:00.440
is specific to ELA and math,

51:00.440 --> 51:03.560
we want to briefly discuss the other assessments.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.640
While California will pursue a general waiver for the CAS

51:06.640 --> 51:09.160
and the CAA for science,

51:09.160 --> 51:12.000
the science test will continue to be available

51:12.000 --> 51:15.280
for any LEA to use during the 2021 school year.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.240
It is voluntary and it is their choice,

51:17.240 --> 51:19.880
but we will continue to make that available.

51:19.880 --> 51:23.440
In addition, all English learners must be administered

51:23.440 --> 51:24.920
the summative LPAC according

51:24.920 --> 51:27.120
to the English Learner Fact Sheet Addendum Guidance

51:27.120 --> 51:31.840
that the ED provided on January 18th, 2021.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.960
The requirement for the summative has not

51:33.960 --> 51:36.000
and will not be waived.

51:36.000 --> 51:36.840
Next slide.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.560
We also wanted to highlight a few considerations

51:41.560 --> 51:43.880
that LEA should make as they're deciding

51:43.880 --> 51:46.160
which assessment is going to best suit their needs

51:46.160 --> 51:47.680
should the Board choose to move forward

51:47.680 --> 51:49.640
with this recommendation.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.080
While the CDE understands

51:51.080 --> 51:54.000
that summative test administration of any kind

51:54.000 --> 51:55.400
may be challenging,

51:55.400 --> 51:56.440
these points are again,

51:56.440 --> 51:59.200
ones that we want to bring to a high level.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.400
Providing the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

52:01.400 --> 52:04.200
for ELA and math to students in grade 11

52:04.200 --> 52:06.640
will support the California State University

52:06.640 --> 52:09.240
early assessment program requirements.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.320
It's important as high school districts

52:11.320 --> 52:15.000
and unified districts are making this consideration

52:15.000 --> 52:17.360
that they consider the 11th grade summative

52:17.360 --> 52:20.880
as the lead indicator for assessing school student readiness

52:20.880 --> 52:22.760
for CSU courses.

52:22.760 --> 52:26.520
Other indicators include GPA and course grades.

52:26.520 --> 52:27.720
And over the last few months,

52:27.720 --> 52:29.440
it has been noted there is an increase

52:29.440 --> 52:32.240
in the number of D's and F's students are receiving

52:32.240 --> 52:33.920
at times for behavior reasons

52:33.920 --> 52:36.240
that do not reflect student learning.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.720
To be clear, it is not a mandate

52:37.720 --> 52:39.960
to provide the summative to 11th grade students.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.520
That's not what we're proposing,

52:41.520 --> 52:42.920
but should be a consideration

52:42.920 --> 52:44.600
in the decision making process.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.120
Additionally, using the Smarter Balanced

52:48.120 --> 52:50.120
summative assessments for ELA and math

52:50.120 --> 52:51.840
will allow students to access

52:51.840 --> 52:54.040
the extensive universal tools,

52:54.040 --> 52:56.400
designated supports and accommodations,

52:56.400 --> 52:58.640
which they are familiar with as needed.

52:58.640 --> 53:01.600
Many of the accessibility resources available to students

53:01.600 --> 53:04.000
are built into assessment systems as tools,

53:04.000 --> 53:07.440
including Zoom, a universal tool that make text

53:07.440 --> 53:11.000
and graphics larger by selecting the Zoom in button.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.840
Masking, a designated support

53:12.840 --> 53:14.680
that involves blocking off content

53:14.680 --> 53:17.760
that is not of immediate need to the student

53:17.760 --> 53:19.920
so they're able to focus on a specific part

53:20.720 --> 53:22.480
of the test item, an American sign language

53:22.480 --> 53:24.120
and closed captioning.

53:24.120 --> 53:26.200
Again, not a mandate, but just things

53:26.200 --> 53:28.200
that should be taken into consideration

53:28.200 --> 53:32.520
that are available for the summative assessment.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.640
And then finally, the last consideration

53:34.640 --> 53:37.160
is that per state and federal statutes,

53:37.160 --> 53:40.800
LEAs will still be required to publicly report,

53:40.800 --> 53:45.800
disaggregated data disaggregated by student group

53:46.520 --> 53:49.680
in the School Accountability Report Card, or the SARC,

53:49.680 --> 53:53.520
and the Local Educational Agency Report Card, or LAR,

53:53.520 --> 53:56.160
the performance of students by assessment

53:56.160 --> 53:58.000
and the number and percentage of students

53:58.000 --> 53:59.440
tested and not tested.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.360
Finally, we just want to share with the Board

54:04.360 --> 54:08.000
some of our next steps should we move forward from today.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.040
CDE will and is committed to releasing CASP

54:11.040 --> 54:13.000
and LPAC summative assessment results

54:13.000 --> 54:14.640
when ready and appropriate

54:14.640 --> 54:16.720
when we are finished with assessments,

54:16.720 --> 54:19.400
provide guidance for public reporting to LEAs

54:20.120 --> 54:22.520
that did not administer the summative assessments,

54:22.520 --> 54:24.160
continue to support the field

54:24.160 --> 54:27.280
by providing office hours and coffee sessions.

54:27.280 --> 54:30.480
We have a meeting already scheduled for next week

54:30.480 --> 54:33.120
to give a debrief and overview of the assessments

54:33.120 --> 54:35.720
and the things discussed at the Board today,

54:35.720 --> 54:37.680
and then also to develop clarification

54:37.680 --> 54:39.160
through frequently asked questions

54:39.160 --> 54:40.880
that we will publicly post.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.640
Last slide, Mal.

54:44.240 --> 54:48.560
So finally, we come back to our revised recommendation.

54:48.920 --> 54:51.320
The California Department of Education recommends

54:51.320 --> 54:53.360
that the California State Board of Education

54:53.360 --> 54:58.360
delegate authority to CDE and or the SBE Executive Director

54:58.600 --> 55:00.840
to prepare a general waiver to be submitted

55:00.840 --> 55:04.200
to U.S. Department of Education to the extent necessary

55:04.200 --> 55:05.720
to include the following.

55:05.720 --> 55:10.320
The CDE again is proposing to meet all of the current context

55:10.320 --> 55:12.680
that we have not yet been able to do so far,

55:12.680 --> 55:14.680
that for the 2021 school year,

55:14.680 --> 55:17.400
LEAs be allowed to use the most viable option

55:17.400 --> 55:19.840
for assessment in their local context,

55:19.840 --> 55:22.240
including the Smarter Balanced summative assessments

55:22.240 --> 55:24.520
and CAAs for ELA and math,

55:24.520 --> 55:27.880
or other diagnostic benchmark or interim assessments

55:27.880 --> 55:30.040
that are again aligned with the California

55:30.040 --> 55:32.720
Common Core State Standards for ELA and math,

55:32.720 --> 55:34.400
are available to assess students

55:34.400 --> 55:36.960
in grades three through eight in grade 11,

55:36.960 --> 55:38.520
are uniformly administered

55:38.520 --> 55:40.920
across the grade span school or district,

55:40.920 --> 55:42.960
and provide results that can be reported

55:42.960 --> 55:47.240
to parents, guardians, educators about individual students

55:47.240 --> 55:49.520
and to the public by school and district

55:49.520 --> 55:52.200
and are disaggregated by student groups.

55:52.200 --> 55:53.720
At this point, I'll turn it back over

55:53.720 --> 55:57.200
to President Darlene Hammond for any clarifying questions.

56:02.720 --> 56:04.080
Thank you very much.

56:04.080 --> 56:09.080
I just wanna express a great appreciation to Rachel,

56:09.200 --> 56:11.320
to Mao, to all the members of the staff

56:11.320 --> 56:16.040
who have really dug in on the research,

56:16.040 --> 56:20.200
on the possibilities, conducting surveys,

56:20.200 --> 56:21.520
reaching out to the field,

56:21.520 --> 56:23.960
responding to stakeholder questions

56:23.960 --> 56:26.360
to get us to this moment of being able

56:26.360 --> 56:28.600
to consider these possibilities.

56:28.600 --> 56:31.200
I'm going to ask Member Sun

56:31.200 --> 56:32.720
as one of our assessment liaisons

56:32.720 --> 56:34.920
if she has initial comments,

56:34.920 --> 56:37.560
then we'll see if there are any clarifying questions

56:37.560 --> 56:42.080
before we turn to public comment.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.080
Yeah, just-

56:44.080 --> 56:45.240
Member Sun.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.080
Thank you.

56:46.080 --> 56:49.400
So yeah, to echo President Darlene Hammond's comments

56:49.400 --> 56:53.720
as well, just great thanks to both Rachel Maves

56:53.720 --> 56:56.840
and Mao Feng for all of their work and leadership in this.

56:56.840 --> 56:59.120
This is not easy, I know,

56:59.120 --> 57:01.680
and you've done a tremendous job,

57:01.680 --> 57:03.640
as President Darlene Hammond said,

57:03.640 --> 57:07.000
doing the research, trying to make this balanced

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
of the flexibility and also address some of the concerns

57:12.840 --> 57:15.520
around ensuring that we get data

57:15.520 --> 57:20.520
to look at any exacerbated inequities

57:22.200 --> 57:25.680
that we have experienced during this pandemic.

57:25.680 --> 57:30.680
So I don't have much else to add to this,

57:31.320 --> 57:32.600
look forward to the conversation

57:32.600 --> 57:34.480
with the rest of the Board.

57:34.480 --> 57:38.000
And again, just really appreciate the recommendations

57:38.000 --> 57:40.040
that we've landed here today

57:40.040 --> 57:42.240
to allow that flexibility for LEAs.

57:43.880 --> 57:45.000
That's great.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.480
And I'm going to see if,

57:46.480 --> 57:51.120
I think we probably ought to put up the public comment slide

57:51.120 --> 57:53.440
so people can begin to see the number

57:53.440 --> 57:55.680
as they queue up for public comment.

57:55.680 --> 57:58.120
I'm gonna see if there's any clarifying questions

57:58.120 --> 58:00.000
at this time, I see Member Strauss.

58:01.920 --> 58:04.080
And let's keep it to clarifying questions now

58:04.080 --> 58:07.320
because we'll have plenty of time for discussion later.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.720
So Vice President Strauss and Member Burr.

58:11.720 --> 58:15.800
My question, again, thank you so much for the presentation.

58:15.800 --> 58:18.240
Just my quick clarifying question,

58:18.240 --> 58:22.280
should this be approved today, Deputy Superintendent Mays,

58:22.280 --> 58:24.920
we would, I assume, submit then to ED,

58:24.920 --> 58:26.880
when do we expect to hear back

58:26.880 --> 58:28.640
that if the waiver would be approved

58:28.640 --> 58:31.840
and then when will districts know that it is okay

58:31.840 --> 58:33.800
to move ahead with our recommendation?

58:34.640 --> 58:37.240
That, I'm gonna have to get back to you on a timeline

58:37.240 --> 58:38.880
for that, Member Strauss.

58:38.880 --> 58:42.360
We've had multiple conversations now with ED

58:42.360 --> 58:46.080
and we're starting conversations with ledge staff.

58:46.080 --> 58:48.440
Everyone understands the urgency of this,

58:48.440 --> 58:51.440
and so we will be moving forward as quickly as possible.

58:53.680 --> 58:54.840
And Member Burr.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.720
Thank you.

58:56.720 --> 59:01.720
And I will associate myself with the comments on my call.

59:01.720 --> 59:04.120
I'll associate myself with the comments on my colleagues

59:04.120 --> 59:07.240
about my great appreciation to Rachel and your staff

59:07.240 --> 59:10.320
for listening carefully to our conversation

59:10.320 --> 59:12.000
at our previous meeting

59:12.000 --> 59:13.520
and really doing some hard work

59:13.520 --> 59:15.520
to get to this recommendation.

59:15.520 --> 59:18.080
My specific question is,

59:18.080 --> 59:22.440
of the five assessments that were identified by the LEAs,

59:22.440 --> 59:23.280
can you tell me,

59:23.280 --> 59:27.120
are those assessments given in the same grade levels

59:27.120 --> 59:29.120
as the Smarter Balanced assessments,

59:29.160 --> 59:32.720
or are they different and if so, how?

59:32.720 --> 59:33.560
Thank you.

59:38.440 --> 59:41.280
So I'll share what my understanding of that is

59:41.280 --> 59:44.520
and then, Mao, perhaps if you're available

59:44.520 --> 59:46.120
to jump in as well.

59:46.120 --> 59:48.000
But my understanding for those assessments

59:48.000 --> 59:51.000
is that they are available K through 12.

59:51.000 --> 59:53.520
Mao, is that your understanding as well?

59:54.360 --> 59:59.360
I think some specific ones may not have high school level,

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.720
but most of them are at least elementary

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.000
and middle school available.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.920
Yeah, they differ across assessments,

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.480
but most cover most grades.

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:13.320
Yes.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.520
Any other clarifying questions?

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.680
Okay, so we want to open up to public comment

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.680
and the public comment slide is up

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.120
and so we want to encourage any commenters

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.920
to state their name and affiliation for the record.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.920
Remember to turn down the speaker volume of your computers

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.680
if you're following the live feed.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:42.120
Speakers will be limited to one minute each.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.200
Are there any public comments?

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.640
Are there any public comments?

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.440
Yes, currently we have 22 on the line.

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.440
Callers, just a quick reminder, this is for item two only.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:01.440
Again, we are only taking calls for item two only.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.640
Caller, you are now live.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:07.480
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.320
Your time starts now.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.240
Good afternoon, I'm Dave Dabrowski,

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.720
the Assistant Superintendent of Education Services

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.680
for Harupa Unified School District in Riverside County.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.840
I speak today to support moving forward with this request

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.160
to waive the requirement for CASP summative testing

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.400
for the school year.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.360
As you know, many districts are engaged in the process

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.080
of returning to in-person instruction, which is wonderful,

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.080
but it's also a process that takes a huge amount

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.640
of energy, resources, and adaptation for districts,

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:35.640
teachers, students, and parents.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.680
This layers in more complexity to get in the way

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.200
of successfully implementing the CASP testing process.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.400
In addition, our district, like many others,

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.400
uses diagnostic assessments, which can be disaggregated

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.120
and reported to parents and the public

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.920
in lieu of CASP results.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:51.600
And while we recognize it's been difficult

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.480
to not be able to take our students' temperature

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.320
with a quality standardized assessment for the past year,

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.720
we also know that using a thermometer inaccurately

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.400
will yield inaccurate results and won't serve

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.120
the greater good for our students and families

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:06.120
in the way that our local diagnostic assessments would.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:06.940
Thank you.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.240
Thank you, caller.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.960
Next caller, please state your name

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.480
and affiliation for the record.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.160
Your time starts now.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.740
Yeah, good afternoon.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.800
This is Michael McCormick,

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.960
Superintendent of the Val Verde Unified School District.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.440
I would just echo the previous caller's comments.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.320
Michael Fullin says, you know, this is the time for us

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:31.840
to strengthen our internal accountability processes.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:33.520
We have those in place,

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.960
and I would strongly encourage the board

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.260
to allow us the option to use

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.120
our internal accountability measures,

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.280
which can be reported to students and parents,

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.560
and also reported by student groups.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.700
Thank you for today's opportunity to speak.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.800
Thank you, caller.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.560
Next caller, please state your name

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.140
and affiliation for the record.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.780
Your time starts now.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:00.900
Good afternoon.

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.160
Yes, you're live.

01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.760
Good afternoon.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.160
My name is Gloria Ulloa-Robriguez,

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.720
board member of the California Association

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.080
for Bilingual Education, Yolo Woodlands, chapter 76.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.840
Our chapter would like to express our concern

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.360
that English language learners

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.760
who have been under an immense level of stress

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.640
are being forced to take tests.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.040
With the many obstacles they have faced,

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.320
we question the validity and reliability

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.740
of tests taken under these conditions.

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.840
Online learning for these students has been inequitable

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.720
with the inconsistent access to digital device

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.520
or the internet, limited understanding of English,

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.000
and limited ability to work independently without support.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.360
English language learners should not have to miss

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.840
vital instruction they need because of standardized testing.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.280
We do not want them to have time taken away

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280
from instruction during the pandemic.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.800
Thank you.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.680
Thank you, caller.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.440
Next caller, please state your name

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.920
and affiliation for the record.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.560
Your time starts now.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:07.000
My name is Mercedes Levy,

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.760
and I'm the associate superintendent

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.080
in Oceanside Unified School District.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:15.080
We serve over 16,500 students, PK through grade 12,

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:17.360
including military-connected students and children

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:19.640
whose families work in agriculture.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.880
As we consider the best way to support our students,

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.600
it's essential that assessment plans

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.000
consume the need for action, accountability, and equity.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.560
Local assessments in our district

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.680
provide us with the opportunity

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.040
to assess students throughout the year.

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.880
This is especially important to our military

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.120
and migrant families whose children often move

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:38.240
from school to school within the same year.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.240
Our local assessments allow us to assess students

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.000
when they enroll, report to families about a child's needs

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.480
and develop an action plan within hours.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.200
Local assessments ensure accountability

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.200
by enabling us to report student progress

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.800
by student groups and for individual students.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:54.040
Local assessments allow us to effectively monitor

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.680
and adjust the instructional program to meet student needs.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.520
I urge you to accept the recommendation

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.800
to use local assessments to ensure action,

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.920
accountability, and equitable plans for students

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.320
rather than one-year tests.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.920
Thank you, caller.

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.720
Next caller, please state your name

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:10.240
and affiliation for the record.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.800
Your time starts now.

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.440
Okay, this is Samuel Erd.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.640
I am a 10-year-old special needs student in Fontana.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:22.600
I believe we do not need any more waivers

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.080
for testing at this point.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.080
Please do not create any more waivers

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.280
to reduce accountability for these assessments.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:32.520
By maintaining all these assessments as required,

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.080
we will learn the actual impact that COVID had on all students.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.680
Today, I ask to call from the State Board of Education

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.320
to protect special children.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.720
Please put no on any waivers.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.200
Please follow me at the YouTube movement,

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.160
everything successful in educational affiliation,

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.640
social education, social matters.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:49.920
Thank you for your time.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.880
Thank you, caller.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.680
Next caller, please state your name

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.240
and affiliation for the record.

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.000
Your time starts now.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960
Thank you.

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:03.200
This is Andrea Ball on behalf of the Orange County

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.720
Department of Education.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.000
I want to thank the CDE staff for all the outreach

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.040
in putting together this proposal.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.880
We signed on to the coalition letter

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.040
and do support allowing the use of local interim assessments

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.760
rather than requiring annual standardized summative assessments.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.600
Schools are bringing more students back to campuses.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.280
They're focused on that now.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.960
Across the diverse county,

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.440
across the diverse county,

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.080
there has been an impact on student mental health and stress.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.040
We think using local assessments to inform instruction

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.120
and improvement are much better use

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.440
of everyone's time and effort.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:41.120
Thank you so much.

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:42.360
Thank you, caller.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.040
Next caller, please state your name

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.600
and affiliation for the record.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.200
Your time starts now.

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.880
Good afternoon, Dr. Darla Hammond and board members.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.800
Diana Liu representing the Association

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.440
of California School Administrators.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.680
We'd like to thank the board

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.440
and the California Department of Education staff

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.280
for the thoughtful work

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.600
that has gone into the assessment flexibility request.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.120
I actually believe CDE's recommendation

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.160
with the safety and well-being of students first

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:10.200
while also ensuring student progress and data

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.080
can be evaluated towards the parents,

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:15.080
educators and the public by providing LEAs

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.520
the flexibility to use the most viable option

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.080
for assessments in their local context,

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.520
including local assessments.

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.720
Thank you.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:23.880
Thank you.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.520
Next caller, please state your name

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.000
and affiliation for the record.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.480
Your time starts now.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:32.960
Good afternoon.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.200
My name is Katie Summer, assistant superintendent

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.080
for UCI Unified School District.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.800
LEAs should be allowed to use the most viable option

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.840
for assessment in their local context,

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.960
including interim assessments.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.680
Our Common Core Aligned Interim Assessments

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.640
allow us to measure learning loss.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:51.160
We administer the assessments three to four times a year

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.480
and have prior year data

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.640
that will help us measure learning loss.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.560
In addition, we're able to create reports

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.440
for parents, students and the public.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.680
Additionally, our data can be disaggregated

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:02.280
by subgroup using our platform

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.280
and our student information systems.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.360
Again, please allow us the flexibility

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.240
to use our local interim assessments this year

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.640
in lieu of mandated federal

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.600
and state testing requirements.

01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.520
Furthermore, we strongly support the waiving

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.880
of the California Science Test.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:18.000
Both actions will help us maximize

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.360
in-person instructional time.

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.400
Thank you.

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:22.640
Thank you, caller.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.640
Next caller, please state your name

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.160
and affiliation for the record.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.440
Your time starts now.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.400
Good afternoon.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400
This is Carlos Machado

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.440
with California School Board Association.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.160
We too would like to thank the board and its staff

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.960
for all the work on this item.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:44.240
CSBA is also a signer onto the coalition letter

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:47.800
to request the use of local assessments

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:49.920
which also seeks a waiver of the state

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.760
federal testing requirements.

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.920
We think the proposal before you achieves that balance

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.400
and we appreciate your consideration of this item.

01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:00.320
Thank you.

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.480
Thank you.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.160
Next caller, please state your name

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.720
and affiliation for the record.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.040
Your time starts now.

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.080
Good afternoon, President Darlene Hammond and members.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.000
This is Eric Premack

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.880
with the Charter Schools Development Center.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.160
We'll also associate us with the comments,

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.480
thanking staff and the board

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.000
for your careful consideration.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.640
We're fine with the pending proposal in front of you.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.920
We do, however, hope that you'll urge

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.480
the Newsome administration and legislature

01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.600
to suspend the high-stakes test-based charter renewal laws

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.320
until we have at least a few years

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:38.920
of quote unquote normal assessment data under our belt.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:42.160
We also hope that you all extend the type of flexibility

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.320
you're contemplating here to the administration

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.400
of the so-called verified data sources

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.280
that charter schools are supposed to use

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.480
for renewal purposes,

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:56.480
including flexing the 95% participation expectation

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.280
and allowing for remote administration,

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:03.520
which the current rules do not allow.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.360
So we hope you'll consider all of that

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.480
as part of this package.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.320
Thank you.

01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.600
Thank you, caller.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.920
and affiliation for the record.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.640
Your time starts now.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.360
Good afternoon, President Verlin-Hammond

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.600
and members of the board.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.840
I'm Jennifer Hicks, Assistant Superintendent

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.080
of Educational Services

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.480
at the Plata County Office of Education

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.760
and the 2021 SISC Chair.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:31.160
I'm sharing these comments on behalf of SISC and CSFS.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:34.080
We support the CDE's recommendation to pursue a waiver

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.840
for the required administration

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.400
of the state standardized assessments

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.960
and allow LEAs to use the most viable option

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.400
for assessment in their local context,

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.200
whether that be the Smarter Balanced Submitted Assessments

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.640
or other diagnostic benchmarks

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.880
or interim assessments being used at the local level.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:54.080
These local assessments continue to be used

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.240
to identify learning loss and guidelines

01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.960
for learning acceleration.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.880
They provide a meaningful way for LEAs

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.960
to not only inform instruction and learning acceleration,

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.880
but also report student progress

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.400
to current stakeholders in the public.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.280
I also wanna thank the CDE staff

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.240
for their thoughtful recommendations

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.800
and ongoing engagement with the field.

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:15.320
Thank you so much.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.520
Thank you, caller.

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.080
Next caller, please state your name

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.560
and affiliation for the record.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.000
Your time starts now.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.160
Good afternoon.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.360
My name is Enrique Rocha

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.520
and I'm here representing

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:29.360
the San Diego Unified School District.

01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.120
And I'm calling to express support

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.000
for the flexibility to use local assessments

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.520
to fulfill state requirements.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:38.120
In San Diego Unified,

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.800
we are planning on the use of BAS for ALA and MAP

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.760
and also the district essential MAP indicators

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:47.000
for grade six through 12.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000
As we prepare for a return to in-person instruction,

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.200
this flexibility will be essential.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.400
Thank you.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:54.640
Thank you, caller.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.400
Next caller, please state your name

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.000
and affiliation for the record.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.800
Your time starts now.

01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.120
This is Beverly Eidman

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.600
on behalf of the ACSA Curriculum Instruction

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.520
and Accountability Council

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:11.280
and the King City Union School District.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.960
I also would like to implore the board

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.560
to consider the flexibility

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.720
that has been proposed by Rachel Mason's staff.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.200
Our local districts need the flexibility

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.160
to make this decision as we begin to transition

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:28.160
from distance learning to hybrid.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.800
When we are finally back in person,

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.360
we will have part of our population still

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.240
in the distance learning mode

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.040
in spite of having hotspots for every student.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.240
We're having connectivity issues for these students

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.240
and our local assessments have been very successful

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.560
and utilizing our iReady assessments

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.720
in an ongoing manner will allow us to really find,

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.640
to fine tune where we need to focus our instruction

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.760
in the summer and going into the fall.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:03.120
We believe that this is in the best interest of students

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.000
as we begin this transition to allow for

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.920
the potential emotional learning.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.080
Next caller, please state your name

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.520
and affiliation for the record.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.040
Your time starts now.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.480
Mary Ann Grosner, I'm a parent.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:23.400
The state has already taken steps towards flexibility.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.400
They shortened the Smarter Balanced Testing

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.320
for English and Math back in November 2020

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.800
and offer LEA's remote administration of CAHPS and LPAC.

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.880
As you are aware, case rates are dropping

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.400
and more and more of the community

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.440
has access to the vaccines.

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.160
We are looking at returning our kids back to school

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:43.160
full time in the very near term.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.040
Creating more flexibilities or waivers

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:47.640
seems like we're taking a step backwards.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:49.680
With more than six billion students attending

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.400
California K through 12 schools

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.520
and nearly half of whom speak a language

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.160
other than English at home,

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:57.800
providing education is so extremely important.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.320
Let's not create any more waivers

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.280
to reduce the accountability for these assessments.

01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.040
English language learners and all students deserve better.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.440
Thank you so much.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.680
Thank you, caller.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.920
and affiliation for the record.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.560
Your time starts now.

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:16.680
Good afternoon, my name is Crystal Diaz

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.040
from Californians Together

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.680
and the following is a message that we received

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.640
from a teacher in Los Angeles Unified School District

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.560
who wanted her words shared with the board

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.200
as she is currently teaching remotely.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.760
I truly hope that the board makes the right decision.

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.040
Right now I am grappling with having to administer

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.680
the ALPAC reading inventory, IAVs and tasks

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.560
all within the next two months.

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.000
When do we teach?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.200
Especially during this pandemic when many of our teachers

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.160
only see their students twice a week.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.560
It is unrealistic.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.080
Thank you.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.320
Thank you, caller.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.040
Next caller, please state your name

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.600
and affiliation for the record.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.160
Your time starts now.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.240
Hello, my name is, good afternoon.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.360
My name is Emily McGinnis,

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:00.600
Director of Data Analysis and Accountability

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.240
for Campbell Union School District.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.320
Like other LEAs, we have local measures

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.360
whose results can be communicated to families

01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:09.640
in the public, disaggregated by student groups

01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.440
and provide a consistent measure for reporting out

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.800
and acting upon student learning loss.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.600
I speak today in support of the waiver

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:20.000
as flexibility and use of local assessments allow LEAs

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.800
to focus on supporting our students'

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.680
socio-emotional well-being

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.880
as they return to in-person learning.

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:28.000
Now more than ever, flexibility and attention

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.760
to the current local context is essential.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:31.880
Thank you.

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:33.120
Thank you, caller.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.760
Next caller, please state your name

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.240
and affiliation for the record.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.880
Your time starts now.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.080
Hello, my name is David Arias,

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.240
father of three kids in special needs.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.280
I believe I don't need any more waivers

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.160
for testing at this point.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.200
Please don't create any more waivers

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.800
to reduce accountability for these assessments

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:59.520
by maintaining all assessments required.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.680
Today I ask the California State Board of Education

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.320
to protect special children.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.840
Please vote no for any waivers.

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.840
Thank you.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:10.080
Thank you, caller.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.800
Next caller, please state your name

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.280

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.800
Hello?

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:19.800
Yes, you're live.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.320
I'm live?

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:25.320
Yes, please go ahead with your time.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:26.120
I'm sorry.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120
I didn't have a number.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.280
Hi, this is Susan Nisman with Speak Up Parents,

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.320
United Parents in Los Angeles.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.040
And I want to thank the board and the staff for their work

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.920
in coming to some consensus and agreement on how best

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:50.520
to assess the learning loss as our children return

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:54.600
to school and looking at it as a teaching

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.000
tool for our teachers and educators and parents

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.200
in terms of understanding that the value

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:05.400
of these assessments is that they are made

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.040
they they're not they're not to be punitive

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:11.440
and they won't be used to limit student access

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.320
to grade level coursework and that all schools

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.560
and stakeholders understand that the logistics

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.600
are participating in the assessments

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:21.760
and that this must be communicated

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.800
so that it's understood that this is all information

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.600
that's being gathered for the purpose

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:29.600
of understanding what resources identifying

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.600
where these gaps come from.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600
Thank you.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.960
Thank you.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.680
Next caller please state your name

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.280
and affiliation for the record.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.560
Your time starts now.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.120
Hi, can you hear me?

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.480
Yes.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.240
Hi.

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.800
Good afternoon board president and members of the board.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.040
Leticia Garcia on behalf of the Riverside County

01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:55.200
Superintendent of Schools and the 23 School District

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.760
Superintendents of Riverside County.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.320
Our educational leaders joined a coalition

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.440
of education management and educators

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.680
to request the board to pursue a waiver

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.640
for the required state test for the current school year.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.080
We believe that staff's recommendation

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.680
address our concerns and allow LEAs the flexibility

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.320
to determine which is the most feasible option

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:20.280
for assessments based on their local context.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.040
Thank you very much for all this hard work.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.520
Thank you caller.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.240
Next caller please state your name

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.840

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.200
Your time starts now.

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.200
Hello, I'm Mrs.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.160
Loya. I'm a San Bernardino teacher.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.400
I don't agree with having waivers for testing.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:42.400
Assessing helps us know how much student has learned.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.960
Let's not create more waivers.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:46.280
We already reduced their learning time.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.760
Let's help our students stay away

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.360
protected from any waivers.

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.480
Thank you.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.680
Thank you.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.400
Next caller, please state your name

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.960
and affiliation for the record.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.280
Your time starts now.

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.480
Yeah, good afternoon to the board.

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.600
My name is Lisa Bennett.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.560
I'm a special education teacher in LA USD.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.400
The emotional struggles, pressure and demands

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.960
on our students during crisis distance learning

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.440
has been monumental.

01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:11.800
I have not been with my students

01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:14.080
in a physical space for one year now.

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.520
I have new students in my class

01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:17.400
that I've never met in person.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.240
The requirement for a statewide assessment

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:21.120
is absolutely the last thing students need

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.640
in their lives at this time.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.440
They are surviving a pandemic.

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.320
The data will not be valid or reliable,

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.400
nor will it guide my instruction.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.120
In addition, accommodations for students with disabilities

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.680
as written in the IEP are not feasible

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.400
in a remote environment.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.560
I would like our school district

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:38.480
to be able to use local assessments.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.040
Let's not continue to put unnecessary pressure

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:41.880
on our students.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.000
They've suffered enough.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.800
They've done the best they can under the circumstances.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.080
A test does not reflect all they have accomplished

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:50.760
during this year.

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:51.600
Nothing has been standardized

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:54.040
in how we've been educating our students this year,

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.720
so a test should not be standardized either.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.680
I urge you to use local recommendations.

01:19:58.680 --> 01:19:59.720
Thank you.

01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:00.720
Thank you.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.520
Next caller, please state your name

01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.040
and affiliation for the record.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.400
Your time starts now.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.080
Hello, Madam President and members of the board.

01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:13.320
This is Brian Revis calling on behalf

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.840
of the Education Trust West.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.120
We continue to believe that proceeding

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:21.880
with statewide summative assessments is the best option,

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:24.760
and that's primarily because we think that's the best way

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.280
to see what happened to student learning

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:31.600
during the pandemic and provide actionable data.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.200
If you proceeded with the summative assessments,

01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:36.080
some of the issues that have been laid out

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:38.440
in the staff report would be addressed,

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.280
including ensuring assessments are standards aligned,

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:45.920
that there are accommodations for English language learners,

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.760
and that there is uniform reporting.

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:53.280
At the same time, we see that you may be open

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.240
to local assessments.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.320
If you proceed with that option

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.080
or providing the flexibility for local assessments,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.360
we recommend that there be strong guidance issued

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.560
by the Department of Education,

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:09.560
and that would include providing a list

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:11.440
of approved assessments to ensure...

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.120
Thank you, your time has ended.

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:14.760
Thank you, caller.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.360
Next caller, please list your name

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.520
and affiliation for the record.

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.080
Your time starts now.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.080
Hello, this is Robert Mann.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.800
We're in calling from Children Now.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.120
We worked with the Ed Trust West

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.320
to write a coalition letter that included equity groups,

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.080
parent groups, and business groups.

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.920
So I'll associate my comments with the previous speaker.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.640
Wanted to build out a couple of things.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:46.640
One is, to the extent that you use a local assessment,

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.760
that you provide some quality guardrails,

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.160
particularly around accommodation and supports

01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:55.760
for English learners and special needs students.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.360
And in terms of reporting the data,

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.280
since most of the school districts

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.080
are likely to use a small list of tools,

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.600
we would suggest providing some standardized reporting

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:13.680
that would be reported out to the states

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.480
for the local education agency report cards.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.320
And finally, we systematically oppose the waiver for science.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.080
All the major issues that California faces right now,

01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.920
a pandemic, wildfire seasons that we've had...

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.480
Thank you, caller.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.680
They all depend upon...

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.440
Next caller, please state your name

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.960
and affiliation for the record.

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:37.400
Your time starts now.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.360
Caller, are you on the line?

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.040
Good afternoon, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz,

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.200
representing the California Association

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:55.040
for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.760
We support the use of local district assessments,

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.640
but requests that the motion include

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.920
referencing designated supports and accommodations

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:06.120
to be made available to students who are taking the CAS

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:08.840
for Mathematics and English Language Arts,

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.760
and that districts use these accessibility strategies

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.880
as they have implemented in the past

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.720
to the best of their abilities,

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.920
including providing bilingual versions

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.240
of the mathematics assessments.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:22.720
These designated supports and accommodations

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.680
increase equitable access to assessments by all students

01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.520
and allow students to show what they know and can do.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.600
Thank you.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.560
Thank you, caller.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.200
Next caller, please state your name

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.760
and affiliation for the record.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.520
Your time starts now.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.160
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.240
and board members.

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.880
This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.760
We support the approach recommended

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:50.360
by the department today in the addendum.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.240
We urge the board to be explicit about

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.200
and direct the department to communicate clearly

01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.320
to LEAs and the public that social, emotional supports

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:01.960
and expanded learning activities

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.760
should be prioritized over test prep,

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.120
and that the purpose of testing

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.440
is to provide actionable information to parents,

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.480
educators, and the public

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.960
so that they can program services and actions

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:16.800
in expanded learning session or the next year.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.600
The overriding need at this time

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.160
is for LEAs to assess and respond

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.360
to the needs of those of their students

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.160
that have been disproportionately affected

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.360
by the COVID-19 pandemic.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.840
Any waiver requests to the U.S. Department of Ed

01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:32.240
should be conditioned on assurances

01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:35.360
that this level of accountability will take place,

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.080
and we suggest for specific student groups

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.600
that are identified by local data.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:41.880
Thank you.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.240
Thank you, caller.

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.800
Next caller, please state your name

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.360
and affiliation for the record.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.840
Your time starts now.

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:52.720
Good afternoon, my name is Lucero Chavez

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.280
speaking on behalf of the Parent Institute

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:56.320
for Quality Education, or FECN,

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.600
a national family engagement organization

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.480
founded in San Diego.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.280
As students and some assessments are made,

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.720
we urge the board to keep our families in mind,

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.040
many of whom are still struggling

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.680
to mitigate their students' learning loss

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.600
due to the ongoing pandemic.

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.800
We urge the board to direct CDE to communicate clearly

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.720
to LEAs and our families that social, emotional support

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.440
and expanded learning activities

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.320
should be prioritized over test preparation,

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:21.920
and that the purpose of testing

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.000
is only to inform upcoming programming and services.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.120
We would like to highlight the need

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.000
for home language communication,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.960
one-to-one modes of communication,

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.480
specifically for eligible students and their families,

01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:34.440
and modes of communication that are accessible

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.280
and culturally responsible to families' needs.

01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.640
Thank you to board and staff for your work

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:41.280
on how to help our students and their families.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.520
Thank you, caller.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.120
Next caller, please state your name

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.720
and affiliation for the record.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.200
Your time starts now.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:53.160
Good afternoon, this is Maria Arias.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.320
I am the founder of the YouTube movement

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.560
Every Student Successful,

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.800
More Education, Less Mitigation,

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:00.600
and I'm here also to speak

01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.320
on behalf of special education community.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.520
I have three children with special needs,

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.600
and I believe that the LEAs or schools

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.800
do not need any more waivers for testing at this point.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:16.160
We really need to learn how the COVID-19 pandemic

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.520
has affected education,

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.480
and we need the assessment to be required as is

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.760
so we can learn what the actual impact was on all students.

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.880
So today, I ask the California State Board of Education

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:32.640
to protect all children,

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.560
including special education children.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:37.760
So please vote no on any waivers

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.160
and kindly support our special ed children

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.760
by following us on the YouTube movement.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.280
Thank you very much for your support.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.360
Have a great day.

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:47.480
Thank you, caller.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.120
Next caller, please state your name

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.720
and affiliation for the record.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.240
Your time starts now.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.160
Good afternoon, state board members.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.640
My name is Sheila Whitley,

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.320
and I'm representing the California Teachers Association.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.520
CTA strongly recommends that the state board adopt

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.800
the CDE's recommended action in the addendum

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.360
for item two with one caveat.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.320
CTA believes that the CDE and SBE

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.240
must clearly communicate to the field

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.120
that the SBAC would not be required

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.240
and that appropriate diagnostic benchmark

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.440
or interim assessments can and should be used

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.640
to provide data to parents, educators, and the public.

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:35.440
Over 60,000 teachers and community members

01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:38.080
have signed our petition to waive state tests

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:40.640
and to continue to plead their case

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.360
as the importance of spending more time

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:47.120
on the mental and emotional health of our students

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.560
and the academic needs that they have.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.040
CTA stands ready to support the efforts

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.600
of the CDE and SBE to fulfill the requirements

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.120
under the waiver proposal.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:58.960
Thank you, caller.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:27:59.800
Your time's ended.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.640
Thank you for the implementation

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:01.480
across the state.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.920
Next caller, please state your name

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.640
and affiliation for the record.

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.160
Your time starts now.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:13.080
Good afternoon, Lorraine Richards speaking as a parent.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.000
Please consider students being first

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.120
for valued instruction and not use them

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:19.080
for the sheer factor of getting data

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.440
that we already know what it will state.

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.480
The use of local assessments allows the LEA

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.160
to choose the tests that will work

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:29.160
for their population during these times

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.920
and what the population is most familiar with.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.440
If we have learned anything during these times

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.280
are what is possible.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:39.200
Therefore, make it possible to allow the professionals

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.600
to choose what the best fit is for their population.

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.440
Thank you.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.480
Thank you, caller.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.160
Next caller, please state your name

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.680
and affiliation for the record.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.520
Your time starts now.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.440
Everybody in my family, by the end of the month,

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.400
will have the time.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.680
Caller, you're live.

01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.280
Yeah, hopefully my sister can get it.

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.840
Me and my mom, we're looking.

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.840
Caller, you're live at the State Board of Education.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.120
Oh, hi.

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.160
My name is Janet Ilko.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.960
I am with the Health Sciences High Middle College

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:18.960
and I am calling in support of making sure

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.080
that all of our students,

01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.680
especially our English learners,

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.920
have the opportunity to show their growth in multiple ways.

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:29.120
The pandemic has been an extremely challenging time

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.080
for our students and our teachers

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.480
and I am very excited to see and listen today

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.320
that there will be options for our kids

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:39.840
that honor their diversity, their voice,

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.600
and what we care about.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.480
So thank you so much.

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:44.440
Thank you, caller.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.120
Next caller, please state your name

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.680
and affiliation for the record.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:49.320
Your time starts now.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.800
Hello, this is Emily Arias.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.920
I am a 14-year-old student in Fontana

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:58.160
and I believe that LEAs do not need any more waivers

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.680
for testing at this point.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.480
Police did not create any more waivers

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.880
to reduce accountability for these assessments.

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:08.240
By maintaining all the assessment as required,

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.240
we will learn the actual impact

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.360
that COVID had on all students.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:16.080
Today, I asked the California State Board of Education

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:18.200
to protect special children.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.480
Please vote no for any waivers.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.320
Thank you.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:24.000
Thank you, caller.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.800
Next caller, please state your name

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.400
and affiliation for the record.

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:29.040
Your time starts now.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.000
Hi, my name is Emily Arias.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.280
I'm a parent in San Diego Unified

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.720
and also a co-founder of Reopen SDUSD.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.480
I'm urging the board to vote no on any additional waivers.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.040
I can tell you, we hear from parents every day.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.000
They have no idea where their kids are at.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.520
They are desperate for information

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.720
and our district did local assessments in the fall.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:56.000
So what concerns me of localizing things

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.040
is that that is just not gonna make it out to parents

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.680
and they're not going to have anything comparable.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:05.040
In terms of them being online and the challenges with that,

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:07.280
I find it astounding that districts bring that up

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.640
as a reason not to test.

01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.960
For me, it's the exact reason why we should test

01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:13.920
because it's the perfect reflection

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:16.320
of what kids are dealing with right now

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:19.200
and we need to know, we must have this data

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.200
if we're going to be able to move forward

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.000
and solve these problems correctly.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.360
Thank you.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.560
Thank you, caller.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.320
Next caller, please state your name

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.800
and affiliation for the record.

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.480
Your time starts now.

01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:34.960
This is Dr. Mary McNeil,

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:38.440
Superintendent of the Needles Unified School District

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.960
on the California-Arizona-Nevada border.

01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.480
I'm requesting support for local options

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:45.360
for an assessment program this year.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.800
For many years, we've used the NWEA map assessment

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.240
in ELA and math as benchmarks in kindergarten to upgrade.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.000
We believe that this same assessment

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.440
would provide us with immediate information

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:00.240
we need to determine how to accelerate learning

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.800
following this year's instructional platform,

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.720
as well as provide realistic data

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.720
for both parents in district and our public.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.840
We want to assess and receive valid data now

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.840
to determine where students are

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.800
and how we can move forward.

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:17.080
We have cohorts of in-person instruction.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:20.360
We can work with parents to assess on-site and online

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.680
using our laptops and hotspots.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.240
We can develop reports for district, parents,

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.320
and the public, and we have the ability

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:29.480
to report individual and student groups

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:33.440
to best understand how to reach each and every student.

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:38.240
Thank you for your consideration of supporting local options.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:39.560
Thank you, caller.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.360
Next caller, please state your name

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:42.960
and affiliation for the record.

01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.520
Your time starts now.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.400
Yes, good afternoon, Dr. Darling Hammond,

01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:54.080
Superintendent Thurman, and members of the state board.

01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:55.480
My name is Nick Romley.

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.440
I'm calling on behalf of Dr. Mary Ann Dewan,

01:32:58.440 --> 01:32:59.920
County Superintendent of Schools

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:03.080
in the Santa Clara County Office of Education.

01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.560
Just quickly, Dr. Dewan would really like to thank

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.720
the board and CDE staff for all their hard work

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.800
and for their outreach to education stakeholders.

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:15.200
I would ask that the board approve CDE's recommendation

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:19.360
that for the 2020-21 school year, pardon me,

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.720
LEAs be able to use the most viable option

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:24.840
for the assessment in their local context.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.040
Thank you.

01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.280
Thank you, caller.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.040
Next caller, please state your name

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:30.680
and affiliation for the record.

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:32.440
Your time starts now.

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.200
Oh.

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.200
Hello.

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:40.640
Yes, caller, you're live.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.840
I'm sorry, I didn't know that I had requested this.

01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.000
I am a teacher and I'm also in public schools

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.200
for 17 years and I'm also an elected school board trustee.

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:57.200
And I am grateful to see CDC's recommendations

01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:01.040
and I am calling in support of those local options

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.400
for our students.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.000
Roughly 40% of our students are remaining virtual

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.680
and our third and fourth graders

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.600
have never seen the Smarter Balanced Assessment.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.920
Giving them Smarter Balanced Assessment

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.640
would be a huge and unfair burden for our learners,

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.520
cause threats, and take away

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:21.720
from our precious instructional minutes.

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.800
Allowing the local assessments

01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:26.800
that students and teachers are already familiar with

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.800
provides meaningful data and better options.

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.000
Thank you so much and sorry for my glitch at the beginning.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.160
Thank you, caller.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.440
This concludes public comment.

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.000
Thank you very much.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:52.880
Board members, this is our opportunity for discussion

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.160
and we could take the public comment slide down now

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.280
so we can see each other, which will be helpful.

01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:03.960
I'll be watching the raised hand function

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:07.040
in the participant queue and to kick us off,

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:09.680
I'm gonna start with Vice President Strauss.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.240
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:17.600
So again, I wanted to thank Deputy Superintendent Maves

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:20.720
and Dr. Mao Leng for the presentation

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.640
and really setting the context.

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.440
Just thinking about districts going forward,

01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.800
should we take action today?

01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:31.240
This is really directed to Deputy Superintendent Maves.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.560
I'm interested in what specific guidance

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.800
will be given to districts.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.880
I know you're thinking about it.

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.440
I'm just interested in when they'll get the guidance,

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.480
what kind of guidance they'll get

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.360
regarding reporting requirements

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:48.600
based on this potential waiver requirement

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.320
and particularly how to address the separate subgroups.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.720
So I know that's a lot,

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.040
but I know you've been thinking about it

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.640
and I appreciate any clarification.

01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:01.840
So you had a few questions in there.

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.680
Thank you, Member Strauss

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.000
and I'll try to see if I can hit all of them.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:10.600
The first one that I heard you ask was about communication.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.160
So I think that we have found actually a pretty good rhythm

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.200
in these office hours

01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:17.840
that we had started in the coffee sessions.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.440
They are a weekly meeting

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.440
that we continue to provide updates

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.200
and I think that it's created a regular routine and rhythm

01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:27.920
that we can utilize as we continue to discuss

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:30.240
and provide guidance to LEAs.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.680
So I think as far as communication goes,

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.800
we have a pretty good platform.

01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:37.960
We understand that there's going to need

01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.080
to be a lot of support in the field

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:42.480
as this continues to move forward.

01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:45.480
We will be sending out an email very shortly

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.120
after the board meeting to the field,

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.480
letting them know of what has decided at the board,

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:53.760
providing some supporting resources for that,

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.200
including registration links to our meeting next week

01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.720
on Wednesday to discuss some of the updates

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:02.680
and any guidance that we have between now and then.

01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:04.720
So we understand that

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.120
and we are putting some things in place

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.960
to make sure that we're increasing communication.

01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.640
The second thing that I heard you ask

01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.680
is about what specific guidance

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:17.280
we might be sharing with LEAs.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.440
I think outside of,

01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:21.320
and one of the things that I appreciate about Motion 5

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.200
that the board provided is that it already created

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.440
some pretty specific guard rails for us.

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.040
So I think there's pretty clear guidance

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.680
that whatever assessment they choose,

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.280
we've provided some considerations to be thinking about

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.760
with the 11th grade and the additional accommodations.

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:38.960
We've made it pretty clear

01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:41.200
that the expectation for reporting

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.720
is going to be through the SARC

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:45.160
and that they should be able to aggregate

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.760
and disaggregate that data.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:50.640
60% are using the iReady, MAP, and STAR,

01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.800
and those are K-12 assessments that are available

01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.560
and you can aggregate and disaggregate those

01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.360
by student group.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.560
So that piece, I feel like the motion

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.880
and what we're recommending today

01:38:03.880 --> 01:38:06.920
provides some pretty clear guide rails.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.080
There will be other things

01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:10.320
that we are going to have to discuss.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:13.000
Today was really about the policy discussion.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.240
We will have a multitude of ongoing discussions internally

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.400
to continue to decide how we support

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:22.200
the implementation of this moving forward.

01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:24.320
And I would be happy to bring back in May

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.560
or Dr. Mao Vang can bring back in May

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.560
an update with what we've done so far.

01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:31.880
Thanks so much.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.800
Member Rucker.

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:38.920
Thank you very much, Dr. Maves and Dr. Vang

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.960
for your very thorough presentation to the board

01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.840
about the many facets that this waiver

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.800
would have an impact on.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:51.960
I especially appreciate the time you took

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960
to talk to us about the status

01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:56.400
of the assessment activities going on

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.680
in the districts at this time.

01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.480
The purpose of behind what the federal government

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.160
is intending in issuing the opportunity

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:06.080
to apply for this waiver

01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:08.960
is to make sure that information is published

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.360
concerning the impact of the pandemic

01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.040
on the academic gains and the instructional program

01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.480
of our students.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.400
I clearly heard a lot of those concerns

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:22.720
and those very clear distinctions

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.760
about how many stakeholders,

01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.320
particularly our parents,

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.800
feel about the impacts of the pandemic

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.160
on what's happening with their child's school experience

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.200
over the past year or so.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:37.280
So it doesn't take rocket science

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.240
to understand those things,

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.120
but at the same time,

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.760
there is a desire to have some uniform way

01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.200
and some uniform set of data points

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:48.640
to further this discussion

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.080
and even validate some of the concerns or opinions.

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.720
So I really do appreciate not only what you did

01:39:55.680 --> 01:39:57.280
in sharing with us where we are at this point

01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.960
but the likely impacts and next steps

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.520
as we move forward in this discussion.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.960
The one question I do have about this particular waiver

01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:10.880
is not so much the timeline for the approval,

01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:13.360
but with each successive week,

01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:15.240
there are more and more districts

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.000
whose assessment window will open.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.880
So how would the approval of this waiver

01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:25.120
with the ideas and the options described

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:28.600
change the choices or the directions

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:31.080
that districts who have begun testing

01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:32.520
would have in front of them?

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.320
Well, right now we're moving forward

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.600
with assessments as we have been.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.400
And we've said that from the very beginning

01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.200
that until we had,

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:52.800
I mean, one, we didn't have board approval

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.880
before today either.

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:57.040
So we have some other boxes that we need to check.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.280
As soon as some of those boxes have been checked,

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280
this is the first step in moving that forward

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:05.400
with your decision as the State Board of Education,

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:08.840
then it allows us to bring very quickly

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:12.640
the general waiver if necessary to ED,

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.120
as well as the required information for the legislature

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:18.080
to hopefully make the same decision

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.560
and provide relief from the state requirements.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:23.440
So assuming all of those things happen moving forward,

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.760
then LEAs have the choices exactly outlined

01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.760
within the recommendation that we're making.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.240
They could choose to move forward

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.640
and continue to do the summative assessment

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:35.880
if they feel like that best meets their current context

01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.560
and their student needs.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.240
They could choose to use

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:41.880
another locally administered assessment

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.120
that they were required to have under SB 98

01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:47.600
to already in place to assess

01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.600
and monitor their students' progress.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.320
So those choices would be up to the local LEA

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.000
to decide based on their current context and need.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:58.920
Thank you for answering that question.

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.920
The reason why I asked the question in the way I did,

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.080
I heard very clearly from many stakeholders the concern

01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:07.720
that something would be lost

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.920
by the board approving an action

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.680
that basically cancel statewide testing.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.920
And that's not what this particular action

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:16.560
is intended to do.

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:19.120
It's intended to maximize the options

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:22.480
and the flexibilities that LEAs have

01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.800
for their testing and assessment regimen

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:26.400
that's currently in place

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.600
and to give them the local option to choose

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.640
the best pathway for them to proceed

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:35.280
to continue with doing an assessment

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.120
and then developing a report from that assessment.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:41.040
So that is the reason why I asked you that question.

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:43.800
I know that's probably seemed very pedantic

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.080
and I thank you for taking the time

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.880
to respond in the way that you did.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.360
I'm just glad I got it right.

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.200
Member Berth.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.120
Thank you.

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:04.080
So sort of to piggyback on what member Rucker said,

01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:07.720
I just wanna reinforce what it says in our item

01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.840
and clarify this that according to the stakeholder survey

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.080
that the department did,

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:18.080
approximately 77% of the LEA respondents

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:22.560
indicated they had used the following five local assessments

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:25.240
during the 2021 school year.

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.120
So I assume that means to date

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:29.000
they have been using these formative

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.160
or interim assessments.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.640
Rachael's shaking her head yes.

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.200
So I think that's important.

01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.960
And I do think that it confirms

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:39.240
what member Rucker was speaking to

01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.640
that local LEAs have decided what works best for them.

01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:44.800
My second question is,

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.040
and it's gonna sound like I'm kind of hung up on this

01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:50.400
because I am, relates to the grade levels

01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:54.640
because I understand that for purposes of a federal waiver,

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.360
we have to address the grade levels

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.320
that we're required to test in.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.280
And we wanna be clear that if LEAs choose those,

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.520
they're reporting in those grade levels.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:06.280
But I'm wondering because, and I'll just say

01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:08.000
my most important desire

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.320
is that parents have the maximum amount

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320
of information available.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.880
If LEAs are in fact using these local assessments

01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:17.960
across grade levels,

01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:22.000
will there be an expectation in your communications to them

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.200
that they also report those results

01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.080
to the extent they have them in grade levels

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:30.320
other than those that the feds require us to test in?

01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.160
That's a great question, member Burr.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.560
I think that when we look at the recommendation,

01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:43.400
grades three through eight and 11, as you noted,

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.240
are the ones that are required

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.880
underneath our federal requirements

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.240
and our state requirements.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.280
I do think that best practice is to communicate

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:53.840
that information at every grade level

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:56.320
that you have assessments available.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.600
But we can continue to have those conversations

01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.000
and then come back with an update

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.200
of what that guidance looks like at the May meeting.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:07.160
Thank you.

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:12.160
I do not see other board members asking for recognition,

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.640
which may mean that we are ready for a motion.

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:19.080
Do I have a motion?

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:24.880
I would move CDE's recommendation.

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:26.720
Thank you, member Sun.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.440
Do I have a second?

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.080
I second.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.760
Thank you very much.

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.960
Is there any further discussion of the motion?

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:38.600
Seeing no hands raised,

01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.880
Brooks will call a roll call vote, please.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.520
Member Burr.

01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:44.880
Aye.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.720
President Darling-Hammond.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:47.960
Aye.

01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.840
Member Fata.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:50.960
Aye.

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:51.960
Member Glover-Woods.

01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:54.280
Aye.

01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.520
Member McQuillan.

01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:59.120
Yes.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:45:59.960
Member Navo.

01:46:00.960 --> 01:46:02.400
Aye.

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.720
Member Patillo-Brownson.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.400
Yes.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400
Member Rodriguez.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:09.800
Aye.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.640
Member Rucker.

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.400
Yes.

01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.760
Vice President Strauss.

01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:16.840
Aye.

01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:17.680
Member Sun.

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:20.240
Aye.

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.840
The motion carries unanimously.

01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:29.480
Well, we have concluded more expeditiously

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.040
than we thought we might,

01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:33.600
but we have two long days ahead of us.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:37.240
So I wanna ask Brooks whether we could take

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.680
the closed session now to free us up a little bit more

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:43.520
in the next two days or whether we should adjourn.

01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:45.400
I believe we should adjourn as the folks

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.960
are anticipating the other times to be available.

01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.320
Yeah, well, we will continue to have

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.600
all those other times available,

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.960
but it's just us for closed session.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
However, given that we have been so timely today,

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.240
you get some time back,

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.480
and I want you to hold on to this momentum

01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:12.800
as we get ready to go through the next couple of days.

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.400
And member Rodriguez, did you want to make a comment?

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:16.720
I saw your hand go up.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.240
No, that was accidental.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.560
Okay, that was your dog, right?

01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:23.280
Jumping on your, all right.

01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:25.880
With that, I adjourn today's session.

01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.640
I'll see you at 421 p.m.

01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:29.800
and I will see you at 830 a.m. tomorrow morning.
