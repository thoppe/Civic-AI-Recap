00:51.680 --> 00:58.160
at 8.32 a.m. and I'd like to commence by saluting the flag. Member Fatah, will you please lead us

00:58.160 --> 01:09.120
in the Pledge of Allegiance? Definitely. Okay. Everyone stand. Awesome. Ready, begin. I pledge

01:09.200 --> 01:15.600
allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,

01:16.160 --> 01:22.160
one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Please be seated.

01:23.840 --> 01:30.960
Thank you very much. We'll now be adjourning into closed session and board members please

01:30.960 --> 01:35.840
disconnect from this link and go to the closed session Zoom link and during closed session,

01:35.840 --> 01:42.320
board will discuss and or take action on the following case, MFC. See you in closed session.

01:51.760 --> 01:55.680
Thank you very much. Seeing that the board members are all present,

01:55.680 --> 02:02.960
Brooks, will you please call the roll to establish a quorum? Member Sun. Present.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.480
Vice President Strauss. Here. Member Rucker.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.880
Member Rucker, you're on mute.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.320
I'm sorry, present. Thank you. Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Petillo-Brownson.

02:24.960 --> 02:35.440
Here. Member McQuillin. Here. Member Glover-Woods. Here. Member Fatah. Here.

02:35.440 --> 02:43.840
President Darlin-Hammond. Here. All right. We will now reconvene in open session and during the

02:43.840 --> 02:50.640
closed session, the board discussed and took action on the following case, MSC. Agenda one

02:50.640 --> 02:55.440
is our state board priorities item and I want to turn it over to State Superintendent Thurmond

02:55.440 --> 03:02.000
to provide his report. Thank you, President Darlin-Hammond. Good morning, board members.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.360
Good morning, everyone who is following our meeting. It is so exciting to say that this is

03:08.000 --> 03:13.520
our last meeting before the opening of school and that welcoming everyone back to school.

03:14.240 --> 03:21.280
Hard to imagine, but next week I'll have the opportunity to visit with students and staff

03:21.280 --> 03:27.280
in the Chula Vista Unified School District where they are going to be opening next Wednesday.

03:27.280 --> 03:33.440
And so if you didn't know, now you know the opening of school is upon us. We all know how

03:33.440 --> 03:40.800
difficult the last year and plus has been. I'm so grateful that we can now pivot to looking forward.

03:40.800 --> 03:46.960
And while there were many challenges behind us, we're more than our circumstances. While we still

03:46.960 --> 03:52.320
have questions about what we need to do going forward, it is clear there is a pathway for every

03:52.320 --> 03:57.920
one of our schools to be open for in-person instruction, to do so safely, to provide the

03:57.920 --> 04:02.960
rigor that our students need to support them going forward. We know that our students can

04:02.960 --> 04:08.320
recover from trauma. They can recover from learning gaps that have been exacerbated

04:08.960 --> 04:16.080
by the pandemic. And we are grateful that our state has provided the resources to really help

04:16.080 --> 04:23.760
accelerate those efforts. Our state budget has been robust in its focus on education

04:23.760 --> 04:30.320
in every way that you can imagine. Deep investments in early education, universal

04:30.320 --> 04:36.480
TK, universal meals, universal after school programs. You think about it, this budget

04:36.480 --> 04:42.080
envisions a way for us to reimagine education. To say that while this has been a difficult moment

04:42.080 --> 04:48.720
that we've all experienced together, that we can build it back better. That we can create an

04:48.720 --> 04:54.640
education system that recognizes that what we had before wasn't always good enough for all. And that

04:54.640 --> 05:01.200
we have an opportunity to do more and to do better for all of our students. I'm so excited about all

05:01.200 --> 05:05.440
these things. And I know that our President Darling-Hammond will talk about many of them.

05:05.440 --> 05:09.760
She's helped to really steward many of the investments that have landed in the budget.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.840
We've been excited to work closely with her, with the members of the legislature, the governor and

05:13.840 --> 05:18.880
the governor's staff. And I want to acknowledge everyone at the California Department of Education,

05:19.520 --> 05:24.960
State Board of Education, the Department of Public Health and Health and Human Services.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.480
All these things coming together to really help create the pathway for getting back to

05:30.480 --> 05:35.920
in-person instruction. And of course, our school leaders, our superintendents and administrators,

05:35.920 --> 05:40.560
our great teachers, many of whom have been teaching through the summer. And of course,

05:40.560 --> 05:46.960
our classified staff who've helped to deliver 500 million meals to our students during the pandemic.

05:46.960 --> 05:52.240
Our schools have been everything. And the budget that we're going to have to support our schools,

05:52.880 --> 05:57.760
both from the state level and from the federal level, really does envision all of the things

05:57.760 --> 06:04.000
that our schools need to recover and to dream big for how we go forward, including how we close

06:04.000 --> 06:11.280
the digital divide, investments that will help us to make the upgrades necessary to our infrastructure

06:11.280 --> 06:17.200
to have broadband all across our state. We know that internet connectivity needs to flow like

06:17.200 --> 06:23.600
electricity so that everyone has access, not just for distance learning when that is the case,

06:23.600 --> 06:28.560
but just to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow and so that our students are prepared.

06:28.560 --> 06:35.040
So many great things to tell you about. Do want to let you know that as we look to the future for

06:35.040 --> 06:42.160
CDE, we have some events coming up that we want to share. One being that we have been focused,

06:42.160 --> 06:47.680
like everyone, on how to increase the number of vaccines taken up by our young people,

06:47.680 --> 06:54.160
especially those who are ages 12 and older. We've been a part of many efforts. Dr. Darlingham and I

06:54.160 --> 07:02.000
are part of a number of media outreach efforts. Next week, we will be hosting a, on the 21st,

07:02.000 --> 07:08.480
we'll be hosting a teen outreach vaccine effort where young people will be talking to other young

07:08.480 --> 07:14.240
people to say why it's so important to get a vaccine. On that same day, I'm excited to let

07:14.240 --> 07:20.480
you know that we will be holding a meeting of the American Indian Education Oversight Committee,

07:20.480 --> 07:26.000
a committee that has been revived and will have probably two dozen participants talking about ways

07:26.000 --> 07:30.960
that California can support the experience of Native American students and what we teach as it

07:30.960 --> 07:37.760
relates to Native American studies and history. Finally, at the end of the month, on the 26th,

07:37.760 --> 07:42.880
the week of the 26th of July, we anticipate holding a webinar for many districts that still

07:42.880 --> 07:48.960
have questions about how to use their resources, how to get school open, and we'll be leading and

07:48.960 --> 07:54.000
centering the conversation with some best practices that aren't really new, but we know when we double

07:54.000 --> 08:00.400
down on them, they have the kind of investments that will help our students build skill, right?

08:00.400 --> 08:06.720
We can't replace lost time that someone, you know, missed out on in terms of having time in a seat,

08:06.880 --> 08:13.280
but we can build skill like literacy, focusing on the things that we've always talked about,

08:13.280 --> 08:19.120
building literacy by third grade, doing interventions for our older students. We know

08:19.120 --> 08:24.880
that when our students build skill around reading, around learning another language,

08:24.880 --> 08:30.720
around learning computer science, you know, we know that these are things that will help our students

08:30.720 --> 08:36.560
to not only recover but to excel as we move forward, and so these are the places that we

08:37.520 --> 08:42.800
intend to go. You know, I am unfortunately going to have to leave you in just a few minutes because

08:42.800 --> 08:51.600
today I have the honor of presenting a bill in the Senate, AB 520, a bill that is a bill focused on

08:52.160 --> 08:56.800
diversifying the teacher workforce. It's a bill that we're sponsoring at the Department of Education.

08:56.800 --> 09:02.320
It builds on the work of Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond. I've been borrowing her work for years,

09:03.840 --> 09:10.000
and this bill focuses on diversifying the teacher workforce and continues to emphasize a very

09:10.000 --> 09:15.360
specific way that we should also be looking to expand our efforts on expanding the number of

09:15.360 --> 09:22.240
male educators of color in our state. Research has shown us that diversifying the teacher workforce

09:22.240 --> 09:27.280
has a benefit for students of color and for all students, and we believe that this is one more

09:27.280 --> 09:33.520
component that will be a benefit to our students, but I'd be remiss if I didn't before I, you know,

09:33.520 --> 09:39.200
get ready to go say that I wanted to say thank you to some of the board members for their service.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.680
Matt Navo, thank you, and congratulations. Thank you for your service. We look forward to working

09:45.680 --> 09:53.600
with you in your new capacity as the chief leader at CCEE. We look forward to working with you there,

09:53.600 --> 09:59.280
and Zaid Fattah, I want to thank you for your incredible service. While we'll miss your direct

09:59.280 --> 10:04.400
input, we couldn't be more proud of what you've accomplished so far and all the great things that

10:04.400 --> 10:10.160
we know lie ahead of you, and Yale, I mean, no small feat, and congratulations to you. We hope

10:10.160 --> 10:14.640
that you'll stay in touch and just, you know, send the word every now and then so that we can hear

10:14.640 --> 10:19.600
from you, that we know that you're doing well, and if you want to just give input on any of the

10:19.600 --> 10:24.880
things that we're doing, like the new statewide youth advisory council that we will be formally

10:24.880 --> 10:30.080
launching in days and weeks, we won't put you to work, but you can just helicopter in sometime and

10:30.080 --> 10:35.680
just give us a thought that might be on your mind, and so again, thank you for your incredible

10:35.680 --> 10:40.480
service board members. Thank you all board members for what you do, and I'm happy to turn it back to

10:40.480 --> 10:46.160
you, President Darling-Hammond. Thank you so much, Superintendent Thurmond, and we're excited that

10:46.160 --> 10:51.440
you're going to introduce that bill. That's a really important part of the picture that creates

10:51.440 --> 10:57.920
the new normal in California, so thanks for all of the leadership that you've exhibited over these

10:57.920 --> 11:04.080
last months and on this next front. Good luck with that. Thank you. We'll see you soon. See you soon.

11:04.080 --> 11:10.960
And I will make additional remarks to augment what our superintendent has

11:10.960 --> 11:17.280
laid out. As you know, this month marks a major set of milestones in California public education

11:17.280 --> 11:22.800
with the passage of an incredible state budget. The offering of more summer school programs than

11:22.800 --> 11:30.080
ever before, nine out of ten districts in California have been offering some summer school,

11:30.080 --> 11:35.520
summer learning, summer enrichment programs, many of them to all students who are

11:36.480 --> 11:41.280
able to and interested in attending, and then of course the planning for the full return to school.

11:41.920 --> 11:48.240
On Friday, I was honored to join Governor Newsom at Shearer Elementary School in Napa

11:48.240 --> 11:55.600
for the signing of AB 130, which was the key component of the state's historic 123.9 billion

11:55.600 --> 12:04.160
dollar pre-K and K-12 education package. This is 20 billion dollars more, almost 30 percent more

12:04.160 --> 12:09.680
than we have spent on education in the past. Now, many of the investments are made over a

12:09.680 --> 12:18.240
five-year period, so the goal is not to sort of throw money at the wall, but to create infrastructure

12:18.240 --> 12:24.560
and to create new systems for education. It is the largest budget for education in the state's

12:24.560 --> 12:30.800
history. It's historic not only because of its size, because it focuses very intensely on equity

12:31.360 --> 12:37.200
and it has the potential to transform the education system in the state. It brings to life a whole

12:37.200 --> 12:44.240
child vision for California education, one that attends to the needs of children and families

12:44.240 --> 12:50.240
with a whole school, whole community approach that wraps around them with education supports.

12:50.880 --> 12:58.000
Elsewhere in the budget, which is again one of the largest budgets generally in California history,

12:58.000 --> 13:03.600
this is supplemented by support to eliminate homelessness, improve health care, close the

13:03.600 --> 13:10.000
digital divide, and support children's employment. All of us, of course, are critical to improving

13:10.000 --> 13:17.680
the lives and the learning of children. So we are really looking at this as not a return to the old

13:17.680 --> 13:24.640
normal, but the creation of a new normal. In addition to providing the highest level of per

13:24.640 --> 13:29.760
student funding in history, and I think we will be above the national average having been close to

13:29.760 --> 13:35.760
the bottom just a few years ago, we will have a greater concentration of funds on students in

13:35.760 --> 13:40.800
poverty, English learners, students in foster care, students experiencing homelessness.

13:41.440 --> 13:46.240
The budget also includes the first down payment on a four-year commitment to establish universal

13:46.240 --> 13:53.040
pre-kindergarten by gradually expanding TK to four-year-olds in the state. Kim, your smile is as

13:53.040 --> 14:01.920
big as a smile can be. And for all of us, it is a happy day. It will begin to close the opportunity

14:01.920 --> 14:08.000
and equity gap before children reach K-12 school. It will ultimately invest $2.7 billion.

14:09.760 --> 14:14.720
Adult-child ratios will be cut significantly to no more than one to 12.

14:15.520 --> 14:21.440
There's an increase of $1.1 billion to improve staff-to-student ratios at all schools,

14:21.440 --> 14:26.240
serving high concentrations of vulnerable students, including up to five additional

14:26.240 --> 14:32.800
counselors, nurses, teachers, or paraeducators at each school. Many of you know that California has

14:32.800 --> 14:40.000
by a long shot the highest ratio of students to staff of any state in the country by a very

14:40.000 --> 14:46.080
large margin. So this is the beginning of a process of really bringing those ratios much

14:46.080 --> 14:52.880
more in line. There's over $1.5 billion in ongoing and one-time increases to special education funding,

14:52.880 --> 14:59.360
including $260 million for early intervention for preschool-age children. Very important,

14:59.360 --> 15:06.880
because we know when we invest early on, the rates at which students can succeed in mainstream

15:06.880 --> 15:15.440
classrooms and actually often not need to be continued in a special education diagnosis

15:15.440 --> 15:21.760
are much higher. We've got almost $3 billion to eliminate our widespread teacher shortages,

15:21.760 --> 15:28.880
including building the early childhood workforce. This includes $850 million in grants to prepare

15:28.880 --> 15:34.080
teachers who commit to teaching in shortage areas through service scholarships and residencies,

15:34.640 --> 15:39.360
and $250 million to attract expert national board-certified teachers

15:39.360 --> 15:45.360
to teach and mentor in high-poverty schools. So we build a stable expert teaching force in the

15:45.360 --> 15:51.840
schools that now can experience often a continual churn of teachers. There's more than a billion

15:51.840 --> 15:56.480
dollars for professional development around learning acceleration in the content areas,

15:56.480 --> 16:02.480
social-emotional learning, restorative practices, multi-tiered systems of support, and more that

16:02.480 --> 16:08.480
will enrich our schools and the knowledge base of our staff and ultimately the lives of the

16:08.480 --> 16:16.000
children. $3 billion to convert more than 3,000 school sites serving students with the greatest

16:16.000 --> 16:23.120
needs. One-third of the state schools will be eligible to become full-service community schools

16:23.120 --> 16:29.040
with expanded learning time, family engagement, wraparound health, mental health, social services,

16:29.760 --> 16:35.760
focus on strong relationships, social-emotional learning, restorative practices, and this is

16:35.760 --> 16:42.160
intended to become a way of doing education in more and more schools throughout our state

16:42.160 --> 16:48.400
over time. This is something that Superintendent Thurmond campaigned on when he came into office,

16:48.400 --> 16:56.560
among many other things, as well as the governor, and really will provide, you know, kids in the

16:57.120 --> 17:03.200
situations where they have the greatest needs and who've been most impacted by the pandemic.

17:03.200 --> 17:09.120
The range of supports focused directly on them and their families and their needs rather than

17:09.120 --> 17:15.360
having to, you know, deal with bureaucracies and barriers to getting the supports that they need.

17:16.640 --> 17:22.080
$1.8 billion in ongoing funds for summer and after-school programs at all schools that serve

17:22.640 --> 17:28.400
concentrations of vulnerable students, and that'll grow to $5 million by 2025,

17:29.120 --> 17:36.080
and then funding for universal free nutrition as Superintendent Thurmond said, access to two free

17:36.080 --> 17:43.280
and healthy meals for children for all students. This really is the beginning of a renaissance in

17:43.280 --> 17:50.080
California education, which was once the leader in the nation during the 1970s before Proposition

17:50.080 --> 17:54.720
13 began the disinvestments that led to the repeated budget cuts that many of us

17:55.280 --> 18:00.800
experienced that left us near the bottom of the nation in funding and pupil-staff ratios

18:00.800 --> 18:07.920
and achievement. We were 48th and 49th in 8th grade reading and math by 2010. Governor Brown's

18:07.920 --> 18:13.280
investments in a more adequate and equitable finance system through LCFF began to turn things

18:13.280 --> 18:20.480
around in 2013. This board's actions to create a more child-centered and community-connected

18:20.480 --> 18:26.240
accountability system continued that course, and we have seen improvements on every dimension.

18:26.880 --> 18:33.120
We are moving up both in graduation rates and achievement, closing many achievement gaps,

18:33.120 --> 18:38.800
although not all of them fast enough, and we really see this budget as making a big difference

18:38.800 --> 18:44.480
there. And these next moves, if we hold the course, will catapult California, I believe,

18:44.480 --> 18:51.200
to its historic leadership role in the nation once again. Closer to today, we're about a month away

18:51.200 --> 18:54.640
from the start of the new school year, and as Superintendent Thurmond said, some people are

18:54.640 --> 19:01.200
already beginning, so children are coming back to school. As you know, to ensure that students have

19:01.200 --> 19:06.960
access to safe and full in-person instruction and as much instructional time as possible,

19:06.960 --> 19:14.240
the California Department of Public Health on Monday issued updated K-12 guidance in line with

19:14.240 --> 19:20.880
the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control. And we really see the surest path to

19:20.880 --> 19:27.520
safe, full in-person instruction at the outset of the school year, as well as minimizing missed

19:27.520 --> 19:34.640
school days for quarantine or illness is a strong emphasis on reliable prevention. And this includes

19:34.640 --> 19:41.120
continued work to achieve vaccination for all eligible individuals, universal masking in schools,

19:41.120 --> 19:46.080
at least at the start of the school year, which will allow all students access to full in-person

19:46.080 --> 19:55.520
learning without hybrid strategies and to get and keep them safely in school, and access to a robust

19:56.240 --> 20:01.760
testing program as an available safety layer. Now, you probably are aware that there have been

20:01.760 --> 20:06.960
questions about the decision to maintain masking in schools, and I think it's worth a moment to

20:06.960 --> 20:12.800
explain why it's so important that we do what is needed to ensure that every child can be in

20:12.800 --> 20:19.040
school every day and stay in school. You know that masking is the most fundamental and the

20:19.040 --> 20:24.080
most effective tool to prevent the spread of the virus, which is airborne and spreads between

20:24.080 --> 20:29.280
people in that way. The countries who have kept their schools and societies open throughout the

20:29.280 --> 20:36.080
pandemic have used masking as a core strategy. Recent evidence indicates that in-person instruction

20:36.080 --> 20:42.400
can occur safely without physical distancing requirements when other mitigation strategies

20:42.400 --> 20:47.360
like masking are fully implemented. And the most important thing, of course, is that we want to

20:47.360 --> 20:53.040
keep our children safe. Although we are making strong strides on vaccinations and we will continue

20:53.040 --> 20:59.360
to do so, only 52 percent of Californians are fully vaccinated. And more important for schools,

20:59.360 --> 21:06.480
only 37 percent of those aged 12 to 17 have completed their shots. And, of course, vaccines

21:06.480 --> 21:11.840
are not even available for younger children. So what we're seeing across the country is that while

21:11.840 --> 21:22.000
adult rates are going down of the virus cases, child rates have been going up. And we need to

21:22.000 --> 21:27.280
be sure that we're protecting all of our children. As you know also, the highly contagious Delta

21:27.280 --> 21:32.720
variant is taking hold in the country as more people move about with fewer precautions.

21:32.720 --> 21:37.440
In fact, there are many variants that are going through the alphabet to name the variants. So

21:37.440 --> 21:44.240
Delta is widely known about, Epsilon is increasing, but they're already up to Lambda in the alphabet

21:44.240 --> 21:50.720
in naming the variants that are coming through and expect to use the whole alphabet. In the last two

21:50.720 --> 21:55.040
weeks, daily case rates in the country have nearly doubled. So we're beginning to see that

21:55.040 --> 22:00.080
exponential curve that we have seen before. And you know that if it doubles in those two weeks,

22:00.080 --> 22:06.080
then it will double in the next several weeks unless there are things that change that pattern.

22:06.080 --> 22:10.160
In Missouri, they ran out of ventilators last week. So they're back to where they were

22:11.040 --> 22:18.800
at the start of a pandemic. We can anticipate some surge this summer. And while vaccinated

22:18.800 --> 22:23.760
people have strong protection, there are breakthrough cases and they can be transmitters

22:23.760 --> 22:29.680
to other non-vaccinated people, including children. So it's not surprising that many

22:29.680 --> 22:34.320
students, parents, and teachers have concerns about returning to classrooms. We need children

22:34.320 --> 22:41.280
back in classrooms and we need them to be safe. And that starts with masking, which is the most

22:41.280 --> 22:47.840
surefire way to be sure that everyone is safe in schools, at least until we get to the point where

22:47.840 --> 22:56.560
we have most people vaccinated and we have really put this pandemic to bed. We need this

22:56.560 --> 23:02.320
sensible approach. It also removes the danger of stigmatizing some students who, depending on the

23:02.320 --> 23:07.200
community they're in, might be stigmatized for wearing a mask or stigmatized for not wearing a

23:07.200 --> 23:13.600
mask. It relieves teachers and staff of the burden of trying to figure out who should be masked and

23:13.600 --> 23:20.400
who shouldn't and chase after them and enforce some differential masking rules, which would be a

23:20.400 --> 23:26.480
logistical nightmare. So the California Department of Public Health will continue to assess conditions

23:26.480 --> 23:31.440
on an ongoing basis. We'll determine no later than November 1st whether to update the mask

23:31.440 --> 23:37.040
requirements or recommendations. And it may be sooner than then. Indicators, conditions,

23:37.040 --> 23:43.040
and science review will include vaccination coverage status. And so to that point, if you

23:43.040 --> 23:49.040
or anyone you know is eligible for the vaccine and has not been vaccinated yet, please don't wait any

23:49.040 --> 23:56.400
longer. Do it. Encourage them to do it. Now is the time for us to make as much progress as possible

23:56.400 --> 24:05.600
for a safe school year as well as a safe California society. With all the great progress we've made in

24:05.600 --> 24:10.240
California, with the investments that are coming, with the vaccinations that are taking place,

24:10.240 --> 24:15.200
I think we can look forward to a joyful and well-supported school year. And finally,

24:15.200 --> 24:22.160
I'd like to close on another joyful note that made news last week. And I'm thrilled that the

24:22.160 --> 24:29.120
Education Commission of the States announced its 2021 recipient of the prestigious James B. Conant

24:29.120 --> 24:35.920
Award. And the winner is none other than our former board chair, Mike Kirst, which is why we

24:35.920 --> 24:43.520
see him with us on the screen. We're very excited. I am privileged and honored to call Mike a friend,

24:44.080 --> 24:50.000
a Stanford colleague, someone I've admired for years. A lot of my policy training was in

24:50.720 --> 24:57.520
long walks with Mike all over the campus as we talked about every area of policy there is to

24:57.520 --> 25:02.400
talk about. He has the distinction of being the state board's longest-serving president.

25:03.120 --> 25:08.400
I've had enormous shoes to fill following Mike's tenure on the board. But fortunately,

25:08.400 --> 25:15.440
he's been a valued advisor and counselor along the way. I know I can always turn to him. He is

25:15.440 --> 25:20.400
a caring leader who, along with many of the board's veteran members, helped shepherd in the big

25:20.400 --> 25:26.080
structural changes I mentioned earlier with respect to school finance, assessment, accountability,

25:26.720 --> 25:31.280
the improvements to public education made under Mike's leadership are the foundation

25:31.280 --> 25:36.560
from which we work to make further improvements today. Mike's work on the board, in addition to

25:36.560 --> 25:42.320
the thousands of Stanford students who personally benefited from Mike's mentorship in the area

25:42.880 --> 25:51.360
education policy, have really affected the state and the nation in many, many positive ways.

25:51.360 --> 25:55.360
And I would like to give Mike a virtual round of applause and turn it over to him.

25:56.080 --> 26:08.480
Well, thank you very much for having me and having me able to address the board. I was

26:08.480 --> 26:13.760
sort of looking forward to standing down below and looking up at you and the dais that

26:14.800 --> 26:22.080
will have to do it this way. I'm really enthusiastic about the progress you've made

26:22.880 --> 26:28.880
since 2019 January when I left. Linda's announcements were just overwhelming in

26:28.880 --> 26:36.400
terms of the scope of it. And we couldn't have done it with whatever I've done in California

26:36.400 --> 26:42.080
without the support of many people over the years. When I was asked to make some remarks,

26:42.080 --> 26:50.480
I thought, well, this is my 58th year in education policy. I'm just leaving my Stanford office

26:50.480 --> 26:55.920
because we're remodeling it. I've been in their same office for 50 years. And I thought I'd make

26:55.920 --> 27:03.280
a few observations because this award from the Education Commission of the States is really a

27:03.280 --> 27:12.960
lifetime award in terms of what people have done. So here are my observations after 58 years. And

27:12.960 --> 27:19.920
this is just a slice that I want to focus on of what I've learned in all these, in the evolution

27:19.920 --> 27:27.200
of this long career. I like this award from the standpoint that it really recognizes the transfer

27:27.760 --> 27:34.320
of education research and analysis in the public policy. And what I always wanted to do with my

27:34.320 --> 27:40.880
career was to be in and out of government. So I was in 20 years in government, but accounting the

27:40.880 --> 27:50.800
five years at the federal level and 16, I'm sorry, and then the other years in the state.

27:55.600 --> 28:03.440
I began really focusing on finance and governance. And that, of course, is exemplified by the local

28:03.440 --> 28:09.040
control funding law. I worked in Florida, and I would say that's one of the best things I've

28:09.040 --> 28:17.040
ever done in 1973-74. We did a total overhaul of the finance education program there. It still

28:17.040 --> 28:25.120
lasts in Florida. Oregon on finance. I worked in Texas where I was the chief finance consultant

28:25.120 --> 28:33.360
at Ross Perot and his overhaul. I have a lot of Ross Perot stories. And then worked in other

28:33.440 --> 28:40.480
states as well. I also did a lot of work on the politics of education, who controls our schools,

28:40.480 --> 28:47.120
building political coalitions. And at the end of that, and it was continued, of course, through

28:47.120 --> 28:54.080
to California and LCFF. And towards the middle of it, though, I began to realize the limits of

28:54.080 --> 29:01.520
finance and governance to include and to improve schools and to really improve the outcomes for

29:01.520 --> 29:08.640
children. So what I really learned is the importance, of course, of what we all know,

29:09.520 --> 29:16.480
of improving classroom instruction. A lot of what we do, including finance and governance,

29:16.480 --> 29:23.600
is a way to improve classroom instruction. But if nothing new is happening and better in classrooms,

29:24.800 --> 29:28.400
we're really not getting that far in terms of what we hope to do.

29:29.120 --> 29:36.800
A paper that was put out by the former head of the Garden Grove School District, Laura Schwamm,

29:36.800 --> 29:44.560
has the right title. We are never better than our teachers. So I began to focus in the beginning in

29:44.560 --> 29:51.280
my first years on the state board on curriculum and instruction. And all the important work you do

29:51.280 --> 29:58.320
and the curriculum frameworks, of course, the standards, the assessments, that has a powerful

29:58.320 --> 30:06.000
impact. Our accountability system, like the dashboard, has a powerful impact. But all of

30:06.000 --> 30:13.360
this may not change much when that classroom door closes. What's happening behind those classroom

30:13.360 --> 30:21.200
doors? How do you connect the capital in Sacramento to the classroom? And you can do that in your

30:21.200 --> 30:26.240
doing that in many ways now. For example, community schools is an excellent example.

30:27.040 --> 30:33.120
But that still will have to get at some point down to improving our math instruction.

30:34.160 --> 30:41.440
We're not going to see much progress in the way we are in math. So LCFF brought a number of

30:42.000 --> 30:50.640
things together in a coordinated and aligned and coherent way that began to change the

30:50.640 --> 30:56.080
classroom. But when you look at the studies, it's still, and you look, say, at mathematics,

30:56.080 --> 31:02.240
it still isn't profoundly changed. Most of what I'm seeing and reading about, Rand has done these

31:02.240 --> 31:08.880
studies as well, is that teachers add a few things, like me adding a few things to my syllabus

31:09.680 --> 31:14.880
from, and now I'm speaking about the Common Core and the implementation of Common Core math,

31:14.880 --> 31:23.200
for example. They add a few things to that. They think, well, I'm already teaching most of this.

31:24.320 --> 31:33.360
They do some changes in how they're delivering their teaching. But I think it's very hard to

31:33.360 --> 31:43.360
make a transformation of teaching. We have 350 to 375,000 teachers. How do you affect what they're

31:43.360 --> 31:52.240
doing without command and control? We can't do that. So I really think that one of the areas I

31:52.240 --> 32:00.000
want to salute that Linda mentioned in this list is the big money we're putting into teacher

32:00.000 --> 32:06.480
preparation, teacher professional development, recognizing outstanding teachers through the

32:06.560 --> 32:17.200
National Board, and generally supporting deeper work on our frameworks. I think those are really

32:17.200 --> 32:27.120
vital, and I continue to puzzle on how to do this in a massive way. I'm currently studying

32:27.120 --> 32:35.520
the details of how Ontario Canada did so much in terms of improving teaching through Ontario

32:35.520 --> 32:45.840
provincial activities. The state there, called the province, was just vital. And so I encourage you

32:45.840 --> 32:55.200
to continue what you're doing, think about the progress you're making, and that it's the last

32:55.200 --> 33:02.640
mile of implementation often. That's key. The very last mile, of course, that's teachers, classroom,

33:02.640 --> 33:09.360
instruction, the interaction with instructional materials, and how you can see whether you're

33:09.360 --> 33:19.280
making a difference there and how you're improving. So that's my brief history of 58 years, and I'll

33:19.280 --> 33:25.520
stop there and let you get on with your important meeting, and I'll go back to my pondering these

33:25.520 --> 33:27.040
problems I've been discussing.

33:33.520 --> 33:39.280
I was muted. Thank you so much. We are so pleased and proud that you're being recognized in this

33:39.280 --> 33:46.240
way, and you talked about the last mile. It's that foundation that was laid in this last

33:46.240 --> 33:53.520
administration that you led during Governor Brown's term of the funding system, the governance,

33:53.520 --> 33:58.800
the accountability system on which you can then build the teaching and learning that is needed.

33:58.800 --> 34:05.120
So I think we're tackling these things in the right order, as you know. One of the reasons I was

34:05.920 --> 34:13.200
pleased to accept this job was because it was building on such a wonderful legacy that the

34:13.200 --> 34:18.320
board had already created. I think we have a few people who may want to say things, and I'm going

34:18.320 --> 34:19.920
to call on member Strauss.

34:22.080 --> 34:27.760
Mike, it's so great to see you here with us at the board meeting. I agree, I think all of us would

34:27.760 --> 34:34.480
much rather have been in person to meet with you and to meet as a team, but I have to say and reflect

34:34.480 --> 34:42.560
on the wonderful eight years we shared together and how lucky I feel as a leader that we were able to

34:42.560 --> 34:49.920
be guided by your ponderings and your experiences and help to implement significant changes

34:51.120 --> 34:55.360
that are going to impact going forward for our kids, for our grandkids. And I just have to tell

34:55.360 --> 34:59.680
you how much I personally appreciated getting the opportunity to work with you, the friendship that

34:59.680 --> 35:05.840
we developed, and your thoughts. And I would say as I teach graduate classes, your writings and

35:05.840 --> 35:12.480
theories have continued to influence how I guide that work. So I hope that we will continue to stay

35:12.480 --> 35:18.400
in touch, and I'm so glad that you're here with us, and I can't think of anyone more deserving of

35:18.400 --> 35:22.800
the honor than this award by the Education Commission of the States. So thanks for being

35:22.800 --> 35:27.280
with us, and I just have to tell you again what an honor and a pleasure it's been to work with you.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.600
Thanks. Member Rodriguez, do you want to say a word?

35:32.480 --> 35:38.960
Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations, Dr. Kurtz. It made me really happy. My heart

35:38.960 --> 35:46.400
skipped a beat when I saw your name pop up in the Zoom, and this is a very well-deserved honor.

35:46.400 --> 35:52.480
And I want to thank you as well for all of your support and the influence you've had on me through

35:52.480 --> 35:59.520
your work. Congratulations again. Terrific. All right. Well, thank you so much. This is a

35:59.520 --> 36:05.680
wonderful way to start our meeting today, and I'm going to move along now to announcements.

36:07.600 --> 36:14.880
You know, we are sad, too. I see Ting leaning forward. Did you have a hand up or anything that

36:14.880 --> 36:21.120
I missed? No. Okay. No, that's my hand up. You did. Okay. All right. Member Rucker,

36:21.120 --> 36:28.000
it's not showing up on my thing. I think I need to move my medallion to the other side as

36:28.000 --> 36:34.640
Dr. Strauss had done. Dr. Kurtz, I wanted to also chime in and give my congratulations to you.

36:35.440 --> 36:41.360
I have known you for a long time, but I've gotten to know you personally in the work that we did

36:41.360 --> 36:48.960
and have done together on the state board under your leadership. I recall when I was first appointed

36:48.960 --> 36:55.840
that you had called me and talked to me personally about the work that I was hoping to accomplish

36:55.840 --> 37:02.480
and what my goals were. You have been a great but also humble leader, and your humility continues

37:02.480 --> 37:08.400
to show here. I cannot tell you how much the teachers and other people that I work with in

37:08.400 --> 37:14.480
the stakeholder community not only admire and respect your work, but also admire the way that

37:14.480 --> 37:21.520
you change the culture and climate for engagement for the state board with the education stakeholder

37:21.520 --> 37:28.800
community. And that work and that modeling for engagement continues. There's a messiness about

37:28.800 --> 37:36.560
education policy and the development of education policy and implementation that takes time, that

37:36.560 --> 37:43.440
takes patience, and that takes humility. And so I appreciate that not only have we done a lot of

37:43.440 --> 37:50.320
things, but it's been anchored in this ideal that you've come to define as the California way. If

37:50.320 --> 37:56.160
we don't do anything else, if we don't leave anything else behind in our mark on the world,

37:56.160 --> 38:01.680
I think probably the most important thing we've done as a state board under your leadership and

38:01.680 --> 38:09.200
continuing with Dr. Darling-Hammond's leadership is we have defined a policy, a practice,

38:09.200 --> 38:16.080
and a mode for engagement called the California way that everyone across the country looks at,

38:16.080 --> 38:22.160
wanders at, and tries to understand how to do it as well as you've been able to help us do it.

38:22.160 --> 38:28.000
So thank you so much not only for your leadership and humility, but thank you for the things that

38:28.000 --> 38:33.440
you have mentored me with and have taught me how to do and have helped me to understand and

38:33.440 --> 38:41.040
participate in. And congratulations on this very important award. And thank you. And Superintendent

38:41.040 --> 38:44.720
Thurmond would like to say a word. And we're glad you're still with us.

38:46.400 --> 38:52.480
They're going to call my name any moment in the Senate, but I'm grateful that I had a chance to

38:52.480 --> 38:58.240
hear those remarks. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. You know, to see the convergence

38:58.240 --> 39:05.600
of really we have two great minds who have led and are leading our state board and our educational

39:05.600 --> 39:11.840
work in the state, and Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond and Dr. Kirst. And to have the convergence of both

39:11.840 --> 39:17.920
of your styles, your messages, has been a special treat. It struck me that if you want to become

39:17.920 --> 39:25.360
State Board of Education president, be a Stanford professor and researcher. And I imagined what

39:25.360 --> 39:29.680
those conversations and those long walks must have been like and what they must have entailed.

39:30.640 --> 39:35.840
And so it's just a treat to hear really from our two great state board education leaders

39:36.560 --> 39:42.160
and to hear about your ponderings that you shared. Thank you for the highlight and the snapshot

39:42.160 --> 39:46.640
of your ponderings over 58 years. And we appreciate that you're still pondering

39:46.640 --> 39:51.200
and that you're willing to share. And so again, glad to just see the convergence

39:51.200 --> 39:55.520
of two incredible leaders at the same time. It was a treat. And I think it's just really a helpful

39:56.480 --> 40:02.480
way to frame the work that you started and that Dr. Darling-Hammond and many of us are continuing

40:02.480 --> 40:08.960
to lead. So thank you. Thank you so much. And you know, one of the things we find in the policy

40:08.960 --> 40:15.760
world is that continuity really matters. And so I think it's a benefit to the state that we are

40:15.840 --> 40:21.840
able to get on a path the California way, as Patricia said, and follow that path.

40:22.720 --> 40:30.320
So it's a wonderful, wonderful way to start our deliberations today. Mike, thank you so much for

40:30.320 --> 40:36.400
being with us. We know you're with us, even when you're not on the screen. And I will just tell

40:36.400 --> 40:43.200
you, if you ever want to take a really fast walk and have about a million ideas a minute,

40:43.200 --> 40:50.720
that's the walk you take. So we'll see you soon, I hope. I'll see you on the campus.

40:51.440 --> 41:00.480
And I'll move on now to announcements. We're now going to both be happy and sad about the departure

41:00.480 --> 41:07.680
of board member Navo from the stick board because he is going to become the executive director of

41:07.680 --> 41:17.040
CCE. And so that's a wonderful asset for us and as a partner and for the state.

41:17.840 --> 41:22.960
His contributions while on the state board included serving as the liaison to the CCE.

41:22.960 --> 41:26.720
So he just decided he'd slide on in when Tom announced his

41:29.920 --> 41:36.720
retirement. And he will be a wonderful leader in that context. He's been developing the state

41:36.720 --> 41:42.640
system of support, as well as facilities and territory transfer related board items.

41:42.640 --> 41:46.480
Matt has joined us in this morning to allow us the opportunity to wish him well,

41:47.200 --> 41:53.440
to share our excitement. And I want to open the floor to board members who would like to say

41:54.880 --> 41:59.680
their farewells and their welcomes to his new role, Member Strauss.

41:59.680 --> 42:08.560
So, Matt, I have to say it has been such an honor and a privilege to serve with you on the board.

42:08.560 --> 42:15.120
I always so appreciate your thoughtful considerations of the challenging situations

42:15.120 --> 42:21.680
we've had to address as a board and your experience as a practitioner and a leader

42:21.680 --> 42:29.200
really show and how you carry yourself. And I think CCE is so lucky that you wanted to help

42:29.200 --> 42:33.840
lead in this important work going forward. Because you have experience firsthand

42:34.480 --> 42:40.000
as a teacher, as a leader, as a superintendent, and as a support at West Ed. I just think they

42:40.000 --> 42:46.240
couldn't have gotten anyone stronger to help follow the work that's been laid. And I look

42:46.240 --> 42:52.640
forward to continuing to see you. I'll miss having our dinners and our chance to just talk about life

42:52.640 --> 42:59.040
beyond the board. And I just wish you only the best. And I still appreciate you taking time from

42:59.040 --> 43:07.120
your family vacation to join us this morning. Matt is three hours earlier in Hawaii right now,

43:07.120 --> 43:13.280
beaming in. So we appreciate that commitment and willingness to be with us. Member Rucker.

43:16.640 --> 43:22.000
Let me begin by saying you're in Hawaii. I have no sympathy for you on being three hours early

43:22.000 --> 43:29.120
enough on this call at 630 in the morning your time. Matt, I so appreciate the time that we had

43:29.920 --> 43:35.680
the opportunity to work together on the board. I really respect and admire not only the credentials

43:35.680 --> 43:41.840
and expertise and background that you brought to the board, but also I'm very excited about

43:41.840 --> 43:47.600
what your leadership with the collaborative will mean. And I'm going to be very careful saying that

43:47.600 --> 43:53.280
because often when we take time to praise the new guy coming in, you know, you're throwing shade at

43:53.280 --> 44:00.080
the guy going out. I also want to take time to thank Tom Anelino for his service because

44:00.080 --> 44:06.320
he started this. This is not that he picked a fight, but that he took up the fight to take a

44:06.320 --> 44:12.160
look at not only what the state's role can be in leading change and leading school improvement,

44:12.160 --> 44:18.240
but he also set the table for what the work of engagement with districts from the state level

44:18.240 --> 44:24.160
can look like. So I truly appreciate the work that he did to set up this model and to create

44:24.160 --> 44:30.720
the types of engagements and projects that have been started by the collaborative. You come at a

44:30.720 --> 44:37.840
time when we are transitioning from that from a phase of getting a ramping up and rolling out

44:37.840 --> 44:44.480
to a phase of really evaluating where we are and what the logical next steps and priorities need

44:44.480 --> 44:49.680
to be. And as Dr. Darling-Hammond has already talked about, we've looked at school leadership,

44:49.680 --> 44:55.840
we've looked at the work of reporting and making transparent to the public what's going on with

44:55.840 --> 45:02.640
schools, and now comes the hard work and those very hard conversations about not only just what

45:02.640 --> 45:08.320
does accountability look like, but what it means to actually hold ourselves accountable for the

45:08.320 --> 45:14.400
types of decisions that are being made. So you're stepping into a conversation that the collaborative

45:14.400 --> 45:20.000
is beginning to turn to and that the board is beginning to ask those very hard questions about,

45:20.000 --> 45:25.280
and I'm very excited to see you there. I've already asked to be on your to-do list to make

45:25.280 --> 45:29.920
an appointment with, so I'm looking forward to those conversations and the work you'll be doing.

45:30.880 --> 45:34.880
Terrific. Members Patat and then member Glover Woods.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.760
Matt, thank you so much first of all for your service on the board,

45:39.760 --> 45:44.960
but also thank you so much for always being willing and open to take a meeting with me

45:44.960 --> 45:51.280
and some other student leaders this past year, whether it be Casque or Jenup or Zach from San

45:51.280 --> 45:56.960
Diego. You're always so willing to lend an ear and so willing to give just such valuable and good

45:56.960 --> 46:02.080
advice when it came to a proposal that, you know, whether it be the proposals that we presented back

46:02.080 --> 46:07.840
in November or something that we were going to go present to a legislator or literally just anything,

46:07.840 --> 46:13.360
you were always just so willing to lend a hand, give an ear, and I'll always appreciate that. So

46:13.920 --> 46:18.480
we're going to miss you. I know that I'll miss you, but I'll definitely always keep your email

46:18.480 --> 46:25.280
and my contact and message you if I have anything. So thank you so much. Great. Member Glover Woods

46:25.280 --> 46:32.400
and then member Patio Brownson. Thank you, Matt. I just wanted to say again to you congratulations.

46:32.400 --> 46:40.400
It has been my honor to serve with you on the board over this past year. I will miss your very

46:40.400 --> 46:48.240
important and very pointful questions that you always ask and just really I'm excited for you

46:48.240 --> 46:54.400
in your new role. I'm extremely excited for the CCEE that will be working under your leadership.

46:54.960 --> 47:00.560
Great things to come and as member Strahl said, they couldn't have gotten a better person for

47:00.560 --> 47:06.080
the job. So congratulations to you. Terrific. Member Patio Brownson.

47:07.360 --> 47:13.840
I just want to say congratulations on your new role. We were sworn in together back when and I

47:13.840 --> 47:20.640
I will miss our conversations and also just the incredible perspective that you've always

47:20.640 --> 47:27.840
brought to the board of both always having a focus on how to constructively resolve

47:27.840 --> 47:34.480
the challenges that we're faced with, how to engage with the folks who come before the board

47:35.040 --> 47:44.800
with respect, with grades, and with the desire to figure out a way to help kids and the adults who

47:44.800 --> 47:52.560
actually are all in the ecosystem working together. So I'm delighted that you will be

47:52.560 --> 47:59.200
a partner in an agency not far off and hope that we'll still have occasion to see you here.

48:00.400 --> 48:06.560
That's great and I'll just say as I turn the mic over to Matt to make his comments that I first

48:07.200 --> 48:13.280
encountered Matt when I was doing some research on Sanger Unified School District where they had

48:13.280 --> 48:20.480
undertaken extraordinary over a series of superintendents, extraordinary improvements

48:20.480 --> 48:28.000
and gains, really reaching out to kids, putting in place literacy programs, terrific training for

48:28.000 --> 48:35.280
teachers around the needs of students with disabilities but also the needs of every student.

48:35.360 --> 48:44.320
So it became very much a sort of child-centered, teacher-supported and supporting strategy and so

48:44.320 --> 48:52.160
Matt has lived through the kind of system of support construction that CCEE is all about

48:52.160 --> 48:58.400
and so it's going to be terrific to have you there. I also just want to note as Member Rucker did that

48:58.400 --> 49:05.120
this is also part of a legacy beginning with Carl Combs tenure which really began the process

49:05.280 --> 49:10.480
Tom Romulino has done a wonderful job of expanding the system of support and really helping us

49:10.480 --> 49:15.760
conceptualize it. Matt I'm sure you will take it that next level in the way that Mike first talked

49:15.760 --> 49:21.840
about to really focus in on what do we need to do to support the kind of teaching and learning

49:21.840 --> 49:26.720
that is needed for every child in every district. So we're thrilled that you're going to be there

49:26.720 --> 49:32.800
and if you'd like to say a few words this is your time. Oh thank you so much and yes I am in Hawaii

49:32.800 --> 49:40.320
and internet is spotty and if I lose you I've let Brooks know to speak for me in terms of

49:40.320 --> 49:44.480
thanking everyone so much and Board Member Rucker you have such a way of

49:45.600 --> 49:49.920
capsulating what is ahead of us. I just appreciate so much your perspective and

49:51.120 --> 49:56.480
simply want to thank the Governor for the opportunity and all the Board Members and

49:56.480 --> 50:02.160
Board Chair, President Linda Darlingham for giving me the opportunity to serve. It's been an absolute

50:02.160 --> 50:09.120
joy and it seems like just yesterday Kim we were going through confirmation with it so it just seems

50:09.120 --> 50:16.880
so quick but I've learned an incredible amount of being here and understanding the perspective,

50:16.880 --> 50:22.880
the large perspective of such a complex system in California having been looking up at the

50:22.880 --> 50:29.920
system for quite some time and having an opportunity to serve at a place where I can see from the much

50:29.920 --> 50:36.160
larger view. It's such a complex but one of the most innovative educational systems in the country

50:36.160 --> 50:45.200
and it's just a joy to be not only a student of California educated by great educators in the state

50:46.160 --> 50:50.080
but also have the opportunity to serve. So I greatly appreciate it. I will miss

50:51.200 --> 50:56.240
being a part of this amazing group and I just want to thank the State Board staff and

50:57.120 --> 51:08.080
Karen staff, Walters and Brooks and the CDE and their staff and again the Governor

51:08.080 --> 51:12.720
giving me the opportunity. It was Governor Brown who had given me the opportunity to serve

51:13.440 --> 51:19.280
as a Governor appointee to ACSI back in 2013. That was my first opportunity to serve

51:20.080 --> 51:25.520
the Advisory Commission for Special Education and started to learn about the system

51:26.240 --> 51:30.960
statewide system of support and how it was designed and I hope to bring to CCE

51:32.000 --> 51:35.600
a perspective. I certainly will have no aspirations of being able to fill

51:36.720 --> 51:43.360
Carl or Tom's shoes in any way but hope to bring just a new perspective of ways to think about

51:43.360 --> 51:48.400
how to do this very complex work. So appreciate it very much. I know you have a very long day ahead

51:48.400 --> 51:55.120
of you but again thank you so much and I'm going to miss this group and thank you Board President

51:55.280 --> 51:59.120
Darlin Hammond for giving me the opportunity to say a few words. I appreciate it very much.

51:59.760 --> 52:04.000
It's wonderful to hear from you. You're now free to go to the beach

52:06.480 --> 52:11.920
and enjoy your time in Hawaii. We are so proud and so pleased that we'll have the opportunity

52:11.920 --> 52:20.320
to continue to work with you in this new role. Thank you. And now I'm going to announce that

52:20.320 --> 52:25.920
this is our last meeting with student board members, Dave Patah. He is the only student

52:25.920 --> 52:31.920
board member whose term endured through the COVID pandemic and participated through the remote state

52:31.920 --> 52:38.880
board meetings. So that was one more on the many challenges that you faced. You educated us in some

52:38.880 --> 52:45.040
very important ways about what student life during the pandemic was like. I can call to mind several

52:45.120 --> 52:51.920
very important conversations that informed us in ways that were very important in our decision

52:51.920 --> 52:58.160
making. He served as liaison to the annual SABE conference and all of his insights and commitments

52:58.160 --> 53:05.440
to the board's work have been deeply appreciated. Yale is lucky to have you. I will say that is both

53:05.440 --> 53:13.840
my alma mater and Brooks Allen who is our executive director. So we'll be glad to share

53:13.840 --> 53:22.480
insights from many years ago. And board members, please join me in saying a few words to Zade and

53:22.480 --> 53:28.880
then we'll ask Zade if he wants to respond. So board member Strauss, I saw your hand go up.

53:30.320 --> 53:37.760
So Zade, I have to say you've been an amazing board member for so many reasons. Really articulate

53:37.760 --> 53:44.960
about student perspectives. Very engaged in all of our issues that we work with at the board.

53:44.960 --> 53:50.240
But you've also done such an amazing job to increase student engagement at our state level.

53:50.240 --> 53:56.800
And I think that's resulted in instead of having 30 or 40 applications for a student board member,

53:56.800 --> 54:02.960
we get 75. And I think you've really helped students around the state see how important it

54:02.960 --> 54:09.600
is to have a voice. So your statewide activism has been so helpful. And I just would say it was

54:09.600 --> 54:15.440
a pleasure. Zade and I got to serve on a student panel for youth and government. And I got to see

54:15.440 --> 54:22.720
Zade engage beyond our board work with students and talk about our issues. I can't think of a better

54:22.720 --> 54:30.160
exemplary student representative of the voice of educational policy at the state. And I'm excited

54:30.160 --> 54:36.560
to follow your pathway. We know you have a great road ahead. You will come back to make amazing

54:37.600 --> 54:43.520
impact in the work you do. And it's been my honor to serve. I'm just sorry it's only been remote.

54:43.520 --> 54:49.920
But I feel like we all got to know you in this model as well. And I'm really excited about you.

54:49.920 --> 54:54.640
Thank you so much for your commitment to the students of California and the work we do.

54:54.640 --> 55:01.680
Thank you. Thank you, Member Strauss. Member Patil-Bronson and then Member Rucker.

55:05.920 --> 55:13.120
I just wanted to congratulate you as well and wish you well as you head off to a land of

55:13.120 --> 55:21.280
incredible cold and excitement that will expand your horizons in all sorts of ways. And thank you

55:21.280 --> 55:27.600
for your service. I also just want to echo Eileen's comments that the level of both

55:29.360 --> 55:36.720
increased welcome to students to come to actually raise the issues that are relevant and

55:36.720 --> 55:43.120
top of mind for students across the state I think has absolutely increased as a result of your

55:43.120 --> 55:51.680
outreach and work. And you've also just I think even in this all virtual format been able to

55:51.680 --> 55:57.760
actually lift up the student perspective in ways that have enriched our conversations time and

55:57.760 --> 56:07.280
time again. I also just have a memory of you very eloquently but very pointedly raising up some of

56:07.280 --> 56:12.640
the mental health concerns that students are experiencing through the COVID year and making

56:12.640 --> 56:21.760
sure that we were all attuned to what it's need in terms of all the full child wraparound services

56:22.480 --> 56:28.880
that our board chair was describing earlier in the budget as part of the preconditions for learning

56:30.080 --> 56:39.280
and for children and young adults to feel welcomed accepted and challenged in all the ways that

56:39.840 --> 56:43.280
school system should. So thank you so much and all the best of luck.

56:44.800 --> 56:50.000
Thank you. Member Rodriguez. Oh I'm sorry member Rucker and then member Rodriguez.

56:51.280 --> 56:58.480
Well Zade of course congratulations and all of the other compliments that have been heaped on

56:58.480 --> 57:04.960
your shoulders already by my colleagues on the board. I feel I have a different and unique

57:04.960 --> 57:11.120
relationship with you mostly because several of your teachers at your school are some of my

57:11.120 --> 57:17.840
closest friends and they talk about you not with just great pride but also with great respect

57:17.840 --> 57:23.840
because of the student that you are at your school. People in the public see you here at the board

57:23.840 --> 57:30.640
meeting and it's easy to forget with the level of sophistication and engagement that you have been

57:30.640 --> 57:36.880
as a leader on this board. It's easy to forget sometimes that you are a young man

57:36.880 --> 57:43.520
heading off to college in the fall and so at your school and around with your peers

57:43.520 --> 57:49.280
when you return from the board meetings and you go back to school you're just Zade and you are

57:49.280 --> 57:55.440
this young man and this good friend and this good colleague and mentor and peer with your friends

57:55.440 --> 58:01.280
that's not only exemplary as a student leader that we see here on the board but also in your

58:01.280 --> 58:07.040
school community you have been a very vital and important part. So I want to say thank you and

58:07.040 --> 58:12.480
congratulations and you will be missed by your board colleagues but you're also leaving a void

58:12.480 --> 58:18.720
and a vacuum in your high school and in your high school community for the friends and the peers and

58:18.720 --> 58:25.280
the support that you have offered and given at your school as well. So I'm very proud of you. I'm

58:25.280 --> 58:32.560
glad I get to know you and as you continue with your work you know don't lose that very special

58:32.560 --> 58:38.560
touch and that very special part of who you are that makes people very glad not only to be your

58:38.560 --> 58:44.000
friend but be in your circle and be able to rely on you for the advice and the leadership you have

58:44.000 --> 58:54.080
offered. Thank you and member Rodriguez. Thank you President Darlene Hammond. Zade both you and I have

58:54.080 --> 59:02.480
been through zoom meeting we started in zoom and it's you know I really wish that I could have had

59:02.480 --> 59:09.520
the opportunity to chat with you face to face. I have tremendous admiration for you and you've been

59:09.520 --> 59:15.200
an inspiration to my students even though they don't know you because you know like I have the

59:15.200 --> 59:22.400
the Zade chart and I tell them I inspire them to set the goals that that you communicated with us

59:22.480 --> 59:29.920
at your first meeting about you know how you wanted to serve on the state board and to engage

59:29.920 --> 59:36.960
you know to be civic minded and so I really want I'm grateful for this time that we spent together

59:36.960 --> 59:42.400
because I've learned a lot from you and you know I wish I would have had you as a student but

59:43.120 --> 59:48.080
when I'm looking at my students I'm thinking you know I'm preparing the next Zade hopefully

59:48.080 --> 59:55.200
so thank you. Awesome Zade do you want to say a few words? Yeah definitely I have so many thank

59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.000
yous to to give out firstly to all the board members but I've just had the opportunity to

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.200
sit alongside three things specifically. First thank you for always setting a good example of

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.880
what it means to be kind and cordial even when disagreeing with someone and working to fiercely

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.120
articulate kind of an opposing point. I think that's something that's so important in this day

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:24.080
and age and it was you guys just set such a perfect example of that when speaking. Second

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.640
thank you for always kind of valuing diversity of thought and opinions and for always kind of

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.200
throwing down the brakes whenever you heard a thoughtful comment that you hadn't considered

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.960
by a caller during public comment. That was also something that I really picked up on and really

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.400
grew to value as well. And third and finally thank you for always being so kind friendly

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.520
and inclusive to me be it at board meetings or when we found ourselves together on a panel

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:55.280
outside of the board meetings. And also just a quick thank you to all the state board CDE staff

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:02.800
and Brooks for always being there to lend a hand or open ear to me or to listen to an idea and

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.400
for agreeing to speak at events that I kind of come to you with haphazardly.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.280
And thank you to all the student organizations that I've just had the opportunity to work with

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:18.960
this year for being so hardworking, so relentless and so thoughtful when it came to changemaking

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:26.320
and for welcoming me into your inner circles. I've learned so much about myself and about

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.800
California education policy and about just other people just from being amongst you guys and so

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.840
that's something that'll definitely be taken with me to college all the things that I've learned.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.760
I'm definitely looking forward to training my successor Rana. You guys will love her,

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.120
she's awesome just from the conversations that we've had so far and I know that she'll definitely

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.960
be filling in my spot and be doing a great job next year. I joined this position kind of a little

01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:01.440
bit more quieter and I feel like I've kind of come into my own. Tomorrow I turn 18 so I came in as

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.760
a young man and I'll leave as a legal man I guess tomorrow so that's super nice.

01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:11.920
And overall I'm just going to miss everything about this position, everything about the people

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:17.440
that I've met, but I know that you'll always be there waiting for me and I'm excited for what's

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:24.800
in store in New Haven so I'll definitely keep in touch. Take your boots. Definitely.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:35.120
We're delighted that you're going to have such a wonderful opportunity and we will be ready to

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.920
welcome Rana. I'm glad you're already in touch with her. The new board member, student board

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:50.480
member who will be replacing Zade is Rana Bananka who is starting, she was appointed on May 28th,

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.760
she'll start on August 1st, her new term and I know we'll all look forward to welcoming her

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:03.360
at our September board meeting and Zade we hope you'll send us news of your first weeks at Yale

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:12.400
when you get there. And so I'm going to queue us up for our next agenda item but given that

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:18.160
we got an early start after I do that I'm going to give us a little 10-minute break to get a cup of

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:26.560
coffee before the next board item because it's a very long one. So but I'm going to sort of give

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:34.160
us a framework for the rest of the day. The following item has an addendum, item two,

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.280
California's draft state plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary Emergency

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:45.600
Relief Fund has an addendum. In terms of changes in the agenda we're going to reopen item one later

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:51.920
this afternoon before item 11 to reapprove the revised March 2020 minutes, take action on the

01:03:51.920 --> 01:04:00.320
May 2021 minutes and receive liaison reports. The proposed waiver consent items are W1 through 12,

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:06.640
the proposed regular consent items are items 7 through 10. In terms of public input members

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:11.840
with public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting to know

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.960
at what time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may be provided by dialing

01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:22.800
the phone number, entering a participant access code, and then following the operator's prompts.

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.480
Upon dialing in callers will be added to a caller queue. The operator will notify callers when it is

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.000
their turn to provide public comment. We'll also ask callers to please turn down the volume

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.760
of their computers, the speaker volume, if they're following the live webcast to avoid an echoing

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:46.400
effect. Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker per item. Item 11 is the

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.440
general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on matters that

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.760
are not specifically listed on the board's agenda. Board members please mute your microphones when

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:03.120
not speaking and keep your cameras on as much as possible to ensure that we maintain a forum

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:08.640
throughout today's virtual meeting. For each item on the agenda there will be an opportunity for you

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:13.680
to raise your hand using the zoom participant window if you'd like to ask the question or make

01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:21.280
a comment. Then you've been doing a great job at that already. With that it is now 9 54. We have a

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:27.600
long item coming up. I'm going to suggest that we take a break until 10 0 5, a cup of coffee so you

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:35.440
can be ready to dive in and then we'll carry that item through with us until lunch. Even 10 minutes

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.880
10 0 5 actually 11 minutes you get. So keep your

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.400
stay on. Don't leave the meeting but you can stop your video and mute yourself.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.560
Do we need to call the roll again? I believe we do.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.560
Seeing all board members present, Brooks can you call the roll?

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.280
Call the roll.

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:05.280
Member Sun. Present. Vice President Strauss.

01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:11.280
Present. Member Rucker. Present. Member Rodriguez.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:16.800
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:22.320
Present. Member McQuillan.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:25.680
Here. Member Glover-Woods.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.560
Here. Member Fatah.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.680
Here. President Darling-Hammond.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.480
Here. We have a quorum.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:43.440
Thank you very much. We're going to dive into item two which is California's state

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:49.360
draft state plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.600
This plan requires states to provide more detailed information than previous applications

01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:01.040
and under very tight timelines. CDE and state board staff have worked diligently

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.800
plan that looks both at what the state and schools did to address COVID-19 during the

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:12.000
past 16 months as well as how the state will support LEAs in the coming school year

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.760
as we move to safely opening schools and addressing student needs exacerbated by the pandemic.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:24.000
This includes two plans that LEAs must adopt related to the safe return to in-person instruction

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.920
and how they intend to spend their ESSER funds. The draft plan relies heavily on actions from

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:37.120
the governor and legislature related to the 2020 and 21 and 2021-22 state budgets.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.880
Stakeholder engagement is a critical element for the state and local plans.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:47.360
Following six months of negotiations, multiple budget hearings with testimony and public comment

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:53.440
as well as additional stakeholder engagement, the 2021-22 state budget was recently approved

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.440
and the draft APR ESSER state plan reflects the final state budget allocations and the

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:05.600
state's educational properties. In order for California to access the remaining 30 plus percent

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:11.840
of ESSER III funds, which is approximately five billion dollars, we must submit an approved plan

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:17.840
to the U.S. Department of Education. The CDE and state board staff recommend that we approve the

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.480
draft California state plan pending the state board executive director approval of final revisions

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.440
requested by the state board and correction of any type of graphical errors. This item does have

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:36.560
an addendum and it will be presented by Rachel Maves and Stephanie Pappas of the CDE. Rachel,

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:42.800
please begin. Thank you President Darlene Hammond. Good morning Vice President Strauss,

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:48.480
Superintendent Thurmond and members of the state board. I am Rachel Maves, deputy superintendent

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.120
of the instruction and measurement branch at CDE and today I have the pleasure of presenting

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:58.640
California state plan for elementary and secondary school emergency relief funds

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.960
as required under the American Rescue Plan Act. The effort was led by deputy superintendent Lisa

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:12.000
Constancio and her fierce team Stephanie Pappas and Ellie Gardner, Amy Tang Paterno and Dan Merwin.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:17.520
Deputy Superintendent Constancio was called to support the superintendent on another matter,

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:23.760
so you're left with me today. Thankfully her team as well as many other program staff are here and

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.280
available to support any questions you might have after the presentation. I would like to

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.640
offer a special thanks to education administrator Stephanie Pappas as you have truly led this charge

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.880
pushing this plan forward and have been key in its development as well as our state board staff

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:46.320
colleagues Deb Brown and Sarah Petrowski for your collaboration and support into the evenings

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.920
and over the weekends. I know we have a lot to discuss today but as we delve into our state's

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:57.280
plan I would be remiss not to spend a couple of minutes to also acknowledge and thank the

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:02.800
greater CDE team for their tremendous amount of work they have done over the course of this year

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:08.320
in addition to their regular duties their regular day-to-day duties under the leadership and vision

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:13.680
of state superintendent Thurman. When I started at CDE I had a tremendous amount of respect for

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.000
our organization and the past year has only served to deepen that feeling. Team over the

01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.880
course of the last year and a half you have not only continued to do the overwhelming amount of

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:30.560
daily work but you have layered on additional and often new initiatives to ensure the field

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:36.960
receive timely information and in the midst you produce some groundbreaking work that serves as a

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:43.600
bright beacon during an unbelievably complex time in education which is perhaps the cause of what

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:49.280
my teenager pointed out at the other day as the further grain of my eyebrows my hair now being

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:56.080
beyond repute. Team you have pushed out over 19 billion dollars of additional funds in the

01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.120
course of a year. You have helped support groundbreaking initiatives including the

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.640
transformative social emotional learning competencies through the mental health 2.0 group

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.400
and the digital learning integration and standards guidance led by SCOE. You shifted our entire

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.520
assessment system to offer flexibilities that required innovative ways to ensure access for

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:23.040
students and families. You have provided over 40 webinars specific to meeting the needs of our

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:28.400
current context in addition to the multiple webinars delivered for the everyday requirements.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:34.240
You develop multiple guidance documents and resources in over 20 different areas including

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.880
CDE stronger together a guidebook for the safe reopening of California's public schools,

01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.400
grading guidance for progress and distance learning, guidance on diagnostic informative

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.080
assessments, teaching multilingual learners online in the California context, guidance on

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.360
embracing and supporting multilingual learners during distance learning and so much more.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.720
Many of you have consistently worked extraordinarily long days jumped on zoom calls or responded to

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.960
email during your vacations and tackled one task after another with impossible deadlines. This

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:15.360
plan included. Thank you. Thank you for your perseverance, for your grace and for your

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:22.640
commitment to our students in California. In order for California to access the remaining 30 plus

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:29.520
percent of ESSER III funds approximately five billion dollars we must submit an approved

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.720
plan to the U.S. Department of Education. The state plan before you today briefly describes

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:40.400
not only what we have done to address COVID-19 during the past 16 months but also address how

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:46.000
we will support LEAs in the upcoming school years as we move to safely reopen all schools

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.000
and addressing student needs exacerbated by the pandemic. To begin with I think it is important

01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:00.240
to quickly review our background and context. As I mentioned above this year there was an influx of

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:06.800
an unprecedented amount of state and federal funding. The coronavirus aid relief and economic

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:14.720
security act allocated almost six billion dollars. The learning loss mitigation funds allocated almost

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:21.280
5.3 billion dollars and also required LEAs to develop a plan in coordination with stakeholder

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.880
feedback for the allocation of those funds. The coronavirus response and relief supplemental

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:36.080
appropriations act allocated over six billion dollars. AB 86 allocated 4.6 billion dollars for

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:43.520
in-person learning and expanded learning opportunities. The IPI allowed LEAs to either utilize an existing

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:49.360
plan or develop a new plan with union support and the expanded learning grant required a separate

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:56.480
plan that also included stakeholder feedback. And finally the elementary and secondary school relief

01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:03.680
S or 3 funds allocates over 13 billion dollars and requires again another plan for that includes

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.280
stakeholder feedback. Finally the increased concentration grant funding that we see in this

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:17.760
new bill allocates 1.1 billion dollars that will be included in a mid-year update in the 21-22 LCAP.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:25.760
The ARP act is the third federal relief package that contains significant funding for education.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:32.240
As I mentioned the previous two federal relief packages were the CARES act and CRRSA act and

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:38.560
combined they provide approximately 8.3 billion in relief funding specifically for K-12 schools.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:44.720
However the ARP act is the first to require a state plan for these relief funds and really is

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:52.240
the focus for our discussion today. As we delve deeper into the content of the plan it is important

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:59.280
to note that this was developed on a very tight timeline. On March 11th 2021 the American Rescue

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.600
Plan was signed into law. On April 21st the U.S. Department of Education released the ARP Esser

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:13.920
State Plan with the expectations that SEA submitted a plan approved by June 7th. On May 14th

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.640
Board President Darlene Hammond and State Superintendent Thurnman sent a letter to ED in

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:25.600
order to request an extension to the ARP Esser State Plan to August 2nd due to the California

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:32.560
State Board of Education approval requirements and the California budget process.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.080
The way in which California receives funds and then distributes federal funds is unique compared

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:47.280
to other states. In other states funds go directly to the SEA to then prioritize and redistribute to

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:53.840
LEAs. In California the funds go to the Department of Finance and are included in the overall budget

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:01.280
planning process to ensure alignment with state priorities. Because the ARP funds are incorporated

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:06.320
into the budget process the timeline for developing and presenting a plan to the State Board of

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:13.040
Education had to also follow the budget timeline. Following six months of negotiations, multiple

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:18.320
budget hearings with testimony and public comment, as well as additional stakeholder engagement,

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:27.040
the 21-22 state budget was enacted on Monday, July 12th, 2021. The posted ARP Esser State Plan

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:32.400
reflects the final state budget allocations and the subsequent state educational priorities.

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:40.720
California was allocated over 15 billion dollars in a third round of elementary and secondary school

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:47.840
emergency relief funding or ESSER III for short. Pursuant to the provisions of the ARP over 13.5

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:54.880
billion dollars of this allocation is sub-granted to LEAs based on each LEA share of funds received

01:16:54.880 --> 01:17:01.680
under Title I, Part A. A new requirement of the ARP Act and subsequent U.S. Department of Education

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:07.760
guidance is a requirement for both LEAs and states to complete plans for ESSER III funding.

01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:14.160
LEAs must complete a safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plan

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.680
as well as an expenditure plan for their use of ESSER III funding.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.440
The focus of today's presentation is the ARP Esser State Plan which included

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.520
includes an overview of the two LEA plans. Over the course of the last seven years

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.640
California has embarked on a process of intentionally integrating and streamlining

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:40.640
state and federal requirements where possible our California way. This includes identifying

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:46.640
overlaps between the LCAP and LCAP federal addendum and incorporating CSI requirements

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:52.480
into the LCAP. As we begin to review the plan requirements for ESSER III funds the same

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:58.560
intentionality was used to reduce redundancy. You will notice that where applicable we work

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:05.760
to integrate state and federal processes. In this next section we will quickly review the ARP

01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:13.280
ESSER III State Plan template. The template includes prompts that highlight comprehensive

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.360
planning by SEAs and LEAs for the effective use of ARP ESSER funds to reopen schools safely this

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:24.560
fall, support for sustained access to in-person instruction throughout the school year, and

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.000
addressing the academic social and emotional mental health needs of students. The plan includes

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:35.520
information gathered across multiple divisions throughout CDE and the California Department of

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:41.760
Health all in collaboration with SBE staff. It is representative of the priorities outlined in the

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:49.360
budget. The template requires an SEA to review the past year to describe actions and events that have

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:56.240
already taken place and reflect on what was learned. It also requires an SEA reflect on what

01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:02.640
was learned and describe how the SEA will support LEAs and utilize federal and state funds to improve

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:10.320
services and supports for students in the upcoming year. Very similar to the process California

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:18.000
developed with its LCAP. The development of this plan has been quite a task. The Department of

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:24.240
Finance and Legislature have contributed through the development of the budget. Multiple branches

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:29.600
and divisions across CDE have been involved in this process. The California Department of Health

01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:36.880
has helped inform this plan. State Board of Education staff as well as LEAs, member organizations,

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:43.920
advocates, families, and other partners. Because the plan reflects the priorities of the state

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:49.920
budget, it required CDE to review the stakeholder engagement that informed the budget process,

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.920
which is the foundation for the state plan. The Region 15 Comprehensive Center reviewed hundreds

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:01.600
of letters sent to the governor's office, state assembly, and state senate that identified the

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:07.040
budget priorities and policy positions of approximately a thousand organizations that work

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:12.720
with students and schools in California. This input and the letters received through various

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:18.000
means were both timely and relevant as they provided insight into local priorities and

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.640
recommendations on how the state should allocate resources available for schools. In addition to

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:30.480
the feedback provided through the budget process, CDE also hosted a Tuesdays at Two webinar to gather

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:36.560
input on the LEA expenditure plan template and a draft was additionally reviewed by the California

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:43.200
Practitioners Advisory Group. Over 200 letters were submitted from stakeholders regarding

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:49.920
California's 2021 budget were analyzed. These letters were submitted between January 2021

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.680
through June 2021 either by individual organizations or groups of organizations

01:20:55.680 --> 01:21:01.680
collectively ranging from just a few to nearly over 200 per letter. Although these letters

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:07.040
represent all together these letters represented the voices of over a thousand organizations.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:14.320
From this analysis over 100 stakeholders including 20 school districts and other LEAs,

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:21.280
over 75 nonprofits and others, and nearly 15 unions in 40 letters expressed support for

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:27.600
addressing mental health, trauma of students, families, and staff. Over 250 stakeholders

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:34.720
including 125 school districts and other LEAs, over 100 nonprofits and others, and over 10 unions

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:40.560
in more than 25 letters expressed support addressing the accelerated learning of students.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:47.760
Nearly 90 stakeholders including over 10 school districts and other LEAs, nearly 70 nonprofits

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:54.080
and others, and nearly 10 unions in 15 letters supported the safe return of all students for

01:21:54.080 --> 01:22:00.960
the 21-22 school year. CPAC also provided very helpful feedback during our meeting.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.480
They recommended adding clarifying language to the plan that stakeholder engagement is not a one-time

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:12.640
event. We tried to work diligently to call this out in the plan that as funding and context changes

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:18.800
California leaders will continue to engage with stakeholders on an ongoing basis. They requested

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:24.800
that we consider allowing LEAs to use existing plans for the safe return plan which is also a

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.600
flexibility that was included in the SAA plan as you will see later in this presentation.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:35.600
They also recommended providing more clarity around how the state budget process influences

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:43.120
the state plan to spend federal dollars. This is something that we've incorporated into the plan as

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:49.280
well as the presentation. Collaboration with COEs was also noted as a strength throughout the

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.960
pandemic. I cannot say enough how much we have appreciated and strongly value the support of

01:22:54.960 --> 01:23:00.240
our county office of education partners and work to incorporate those successes into the plan as

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:06.720
well. They also with a very keen eye noted the places we use language like learning loss

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:14.160
and remediation and requested we change that language to reflect more strengths-based assets.

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:22.640
Regarding the expenditure plan our Tuesdays at 2 which included specific feedback as well from the

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:29.680
equity coalition helped us to inform some changes to the plan. These include a revised revision of

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:35.120
the title template, the request to provide flexibility for LEAs to reference or include

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:40.320
input provided by community members during the development of existing plans to the extent that

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.160
the input is applicable to the requirements of the SR3 expenditure plan. They asked that we provide

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:53.120
flexibility for LEAs to include actions described in existing plans including the LCAP or the ELO

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.920
grant plan to the extent again that those actions address the requirements of SR3.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:04.960
They clarified within the template and instructions that the plan only addresses SR3 funds. They

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.320
requested a list of community members be included with whom LEAs were required to consult.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:16.320
They requested a summary of expenditure tables be removed to the beginning of the plan.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.120
We also included a requirement in fields in the template for LEAs to choose to utilize community

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:29.360
input and or action from other planning documents to provide the name of the plan referenced in the

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:36.080
LEA and a description of where that plan may be accessed by the public. We also clarified the

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:41.280
instructions that an LEA may reference or include input provided by community members during the

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:47.360
development of the existing plans including the LCAP or the ELO grant plan to the extent that the

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:53.440
input is applicable to the requirements of the SR3 expenditure plan. We clarified within the

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.480
instructions that when including actions from other places the LEA must describe how the actions

01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:04.320
included in the SR3 expenditure plan supplement the work described in the plan being referenced

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:10.480
and the SR3 funds included in the SR3 expenditure plan must be in addition to any funding for those

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.320
actions already included in the plan's reference by the LEA. Finally, we clarified within the

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:23.440
instructions that an LEA must include all of the LEA's apportionment of SR3 funds. This feedback

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:28.960
has been extraordinarily valuable and has served to make necessary changes to what we're bringing

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:35.120
before you today. The rest of the presentation includes an overview of the revised plan as

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:42.000
informed by stakeholder engagement to then gather your feedback. The ED provided state template

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:49.440
contains seven sections referred to as critical areas that must be addressed. These sections

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:54.960
include describing the state's current status and needs, safely reopening schools and sustaining

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:01.840
their safe operations, planning for the use and coordination of ARPS or funds, maximizing state

01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:07.440
level funds to support students, supporting LEAs and planning for meeting students needs,

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:11.040
supporting the educator workforce, and monitoring and measuring progress.

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:18.800
Each section of the template begins with framing from ED followed by an overview of the purpose

01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:25.360
and focus. In section A, ED recognizes the extraordinary efforts made by states, LEAs,

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.280
and educators to support students during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this section, SEAs will

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:36.000
describe the progress they have made, the priorities and student needs guiding their ARPS or funding

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.640
decisions, and their current and projected operating status. Each section also includes

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:48.480
areas of focus. There are five areas of focus as specified within the section A plan.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.520
First, the state must include the top two or three strategies that have been most effective

01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:01.200
in supporting the needs of students. The CDE and the SBE work closely with the governor's office

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:07.200
and the California Department of Health, CDPH, through the state schools for all team, along

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.320
with input from stakeholders to identify the most impactful practices from this year.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:18.800
Those practices include guidance, resources, and flexibility to support effective distance learning.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.640
A few highlights include significant funding to LEAs from the governor's office and legislature

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.240
to develop and implement initiatives that directly support academic achievement and mitigate learning

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.600
gaps. Investments and guidance including digital learning integration and standards guidance,

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:42.720
as well as flexibilities in the administration of assessments. Two, expanded access to devices,

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:48.640
broadband, and connectivity. An example of this includes California's efforts to address the

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:54.000
digital divide through the bridging the digital divide fund created by Governor Gavin Newsom,

01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.240
first partner Jennifer Sibyl Newsom, and SBE president and the state superintendent of public

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.920
instruction, Tony Thurman, that raised tens of millions of dollars in direct aid to communities

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.920
and school districts to address this issue. Three, support for the safe return to in-person

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:17.520
instruction. This was accomplished through various efforts including the state superintendent and CDE

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:24.800
in partnership with the SBE, CDPH, and others to put out guidance and develop resources for LEAs

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:30.560
on how to safely return to in-person instruction. The governor's office supported school staff by

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:37.280
giving them first access to personal protective equipment, COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 vaccines.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.280
For section A2, the state plan requires SEAs identify the overall priorities for the state.

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:52.000
These are the top three issues currently facing students and schools across California as a result

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.640
of COVID-19. Mental health trauma needs of students, families, and staff. Over 100

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:02.800
stakeholders expressed support for budget priorities focused on the mental health and

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:08.000
trauma needs of students, families, and staff. This priority was broadly supported by school

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:14.960
districts and LEAs, non-profits, community groups, and labor partners. Over 250 stakeholders

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:20.000
expressed support for accelerated learning priorities such as expanded learning time,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.520
high-dose tutoring, and summer enrichment. This priority had widespread support from LEAs,

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:31.680
non-profits, community groups, and labor partners. And finally, over 90 stakeholders from a variety

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.400
of groups representing school districts, LEAs, non-profits, and community members and labor

01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:41.360
partners expressed support for the safe return to full-time in-person instruction.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:49.280
Underserved students are identified in the plan as students from low-income families,

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:55.920
students of color, English learners, children with disabilities, students experiencing homelessness,

01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.880
children and youth in foster care, migratory students, youth involved in the criminal justice

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:09.680
system, LGBTQIA students, and another group disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.520
As the state reviewed needs for each student group based on stakeholder feedback, there are a number

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:21.600
of areas that overlapped across student groups including mental health supports, social emotional

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:27.440
supports and programs, targeted interventions to support accelerated learning, and access to

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:35.360
reliable technology including devices and broadband. Another prompt asked the state to describe how it

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:41.600
will support LEAs in identifying the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student

01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:47.360
learning and student well-being. The draft describes how stakeholder engagement is foundational to

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:53.920
how the state understands the impact of changes such as the pandemic. It then covers the local

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.680
control and accountability plan as a critical data collection tool as school districts engage their

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:06.080
communities to assess student needs, opportunity gaps, and areas for improvement. The plan also

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:11.360
notes that the CDE has continued to use the California school dashboard to understand the

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:18.240
needs of schools, of districts, schools, and student groups. Additionally, CDE produced resources

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:24.080
such as guidance on diagnostic informative assessments in August 2020 to guide districts

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:31.920
on collecting data to inform teaching and learning. This prompt required CDE to describe schools

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:37.520
operational status and mode of instruction. The data collection included whether schools were

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.920
open for in-person, hybrid, or distance learning only every second and fourth Monday of each month.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:52.720
At the end of January about 240 of approximately 1,100 school districts were offering some

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:58.000
in-person instruction and at least some of their schools. Over the course of the next few months

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:04.640
that number increased to nearly 930 districts reporting they were offering some in-person

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:12.080
instruction by mid-May. This prompt requires a description of the planned operational status

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:19.760
and mode of instruction of the state and its LEAs for summer 2021 and for the 21-22 school year.

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:26.240
LEAs are being asked through the CDPH bi-weekly survey to provide information on summer offerings

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:32.640
including if they are offering summer programs to all students or just a subset. Based on

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:39.840
information collected to date, LEAs representing 90 percent of all districts report that they

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:48.640
overwhelmingly plan to offer a summer program. Section B of the template asks the state education

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:55.040
agency to describe how LEAs will be supported in safely returning to in-person instruction

01:32:55.040 --> 01:33:01.920
and sustaining the safe operation of schools. This section includes two areas of focus,

01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:07.200
supports for LEAs and safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plan.

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:14.800
As part of this section the state is required to describe how it will support LEAs in implementing

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:19.840
the most current guidance from the Centers the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.120
California has been very forward-thinking in its response to the pandemic

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:30.160
and as such the state has already taken a number of actions to address CDC guidance.

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.560
A few notable highlights include the CDSBE and various state partners work together to allocate

01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:45.360
and coordinate the distribution of PPE hand sanitizer and touchless thermometers to all

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.880
California schools including private schools. We provided support for LEAs through technical

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:57.280
assistance, guidance, testing and resources and Governor Newsom in the California legislature

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:03.200
provided $6.6 billion in the state budget including $2 billion for in-person instruction

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:10.320
or IPI grants on March 5th, 2021 before the ARP Act was signed. As a condition of receiving

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:17.040
IPI grants, LEAs were required to offer in-person destruction as defined in AB 86

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.440
and funding can be used for things like COVID-19 testing, cleaning and disinfecting, PPE and more.

01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:31.840
As noted in the background and context, SR 3 requires LEAs to complete two plans,

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:37.120
the safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plan and the SR 3

01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:42.640
expenditure plan. The safe return to in-person instruction and continuity of services plan

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:48.160
includes four specific components, how the LEA will maintain the health and safety of students,

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:55.040
educators and other staff, how the LEA will ensure continuity of services, a description of the LEA's

01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.560
policy or practice that provided the public with an opportunity to provide comment and feedback

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:05.840
and how such feedback was incorporated into the development of the plan and various assurances

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:12.720
and contact information. LEAs are required to submit the safe return to in-person instruction

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:21.040
continuity of services plan to CDE within 30 days of accepting funds. I would just note that

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:30.160
the ARP Act allows an LEA who had a plan in place as of March 11th, 2021 and that is compliant with

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:37.360
the ARP statute to be grandfathered in for a period of up to six months. As such, the state

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:43.920
allows those LEAs to use the abbreviated template to verify they are currently in compliance.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:51.440
LEAs are required to review and if appropriate, revise their plans at least once every six months.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:58.480
The CDE will track the required revisions through LEA quarterly and annual reporting on use of funds.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:06.320
Similarly valued by California and evidenced in the various state plans including the learning

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:12.640
continuity plan, the expanded learning plan and safety plan and the local control and accountability

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:19.200
plan, ED also recognizes that seeking input from diverse stakeholders is essential to developing

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:25.600
plans for the use of ARP assur funds that are responsive to the needs of students, families

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:33.120
and educators. This section includes two focus areas including the ways in which the SEA gathered

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.800
stakeholder feedback as well as how the SEA has supported the coordination of federal funds.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:46.640
Over the course of this year, state agencies have engaged in regular meetings with various

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:53.040
organizations including districts, charter schools, county offices of education, advocacy groups,

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:58.800
community members and more to elicit feedback, build understanding of the needs of California

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:05.760
students and explore areas for partnership and collaboration. This slide represents the ways in

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:12.000
which feedback has been formally submitted but the more informal conversations and collaboration

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.280
over the course of this year have also been an invaluable foundation for the development of

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:24.560
California state priorities to meet student needs. As noted previously, California utilizes

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:30.320
a unique approach in the way it receives and disperses federal funds. Because funds go directly

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:36.000
to the Department of Finance and are then subject to the rigorous budget process, the letters sent

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:41.440
to the governor's office, state assembly and state senate were an essential stakeholder feedback

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:46.880
mechanism. The legislature and governor's office received feedback again from approximately a

01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:53.600
thousand organizations that work with students and schools in California. Additionally, CDE

01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.440
hosted other opportunities for feedback including webinars. The first webinar solicited input from

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:06.800
LEAs and the public at large and had 572 attendees, while the second webinar solicited input from

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.000
advocates representing the interests of students who are English learners and their families,

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:17.040
homeless students, foster youth, migratory students, students who are incarcerated and

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:23.040
other underserved students. A draft of the state plan was also presented to the CPAC

01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:30.080
on June 29th. It is important to note that all public comment received today will be considered

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:37.600
and where possible incorporated into the plan. Over the last, over the course of the last seven

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.680
years, California has acknowledged its vast diversity in LEAs and the student populations

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.320
they serve throughout the state. With the adoption of the local control funding formula,

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:59.360
our LEAs ranging in size from six students to 575,000 students had the freedom to, in consultation

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:06.240
with their local community, strategically allocate resources to best meet their unique needs.

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:12.240
While the federal funds provided guardrails for funding, each LEA is allowed the ability

01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:18.160
to address the most pressing needs for their local student body. There is a statewide webinar

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:25.280
and module that provides information to LEAs related to the blending and authorized use

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:33.040
of ARP S or three funds. In conversations with a district superintendent of colleague of mine,

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.840
and I think I mentioned this before, he noted that there have always been cracks within our

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.320
education system. Well, with the onset of a global pandemic, in some areas those cracks have now

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:52.080
become chasms. To this end, and in line with California's commitment to continuing to ensure

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:58.400
we are providing equitable opportunities for all students, ED also recognizes that states have an

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.800
extraordinary opportunity to address the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:11.040
on underserved students through the ARP Act's required state set-asides to address the academic

01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.840
impact of lost instruction time, provide summer learning and enrichment programs,

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:24.000
and provide comprehensive after-school programs. This section is comprised of four areas of focus,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:29.280
including academic impact of lost instructional time, evidence-based learning and enrichment

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:36.640
programs, evidence-based comprehensive after-school programs, and emergency needs. CDE and other

01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:43.360
state agencies, including SBE and the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, or CCEE,

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:50.640
continue to provide guidance to LEAs as they consider evidence-based interventions

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:55.680
that meet their local context to address students' needs. This includes webinars to

01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:00.720
address high-quality distance learning and after-school programs, research-based best

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:06.080
practices in distance learning, development of various guidance documents, including equitable

01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.760
grading practices, utilizing interim informative assessments, and the development of transformative

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:17.600
social-emotional learning competencies. Additionally, the state budget also focuses

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:22.800
on increasing the number of adults providing direct services to students and additional funds

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:28.480
for the California Community Schools Partnership Act, which will serve LEAs that demonstrate a

01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:34.000
need to expand access to integrated services, especially for students disproportionately

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:40.560
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of the last several years, again,

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:46.400
California has worked diligently to build and establish guidance and support high-quality

01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:54.000
expanded learning programs. In 2014, CDE adopted quality standards for expanded learning programs.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.440
These standards focused on fostering positive relationships between program participants and

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:05.680
staff, building positive relationships among program participants, offering a blend of academic

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:11.280
and developmental skill-building activities, ensuring high levels of student engagement,

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.520
maintaining an orientation toward mastery of knowledge and skills,

01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.480
and providing appropriate levels of structure as well as opportunities for autonomy and choice.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:29.840
With over 2,000 LEAs and 4.6 million students, the 6.2 million students, the budget and the CDE

01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:36.080
continue to promote the necessity of engaging with community-based organizations or municipal

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:44.480
agencies to operate high-quality programs. States were given the opportunity to reserve funds for

01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:50.080
emergency needs if applicable. The California state legislature and governor chose to utilize

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:57.120
funds to prioritize the most urgent immediate needs rather than reserve funds for future

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:04.800
emergency needs. In this section, ED recognizes that the safe return to in-person instruction

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.840
must be accompanied by a focus on meeting students' academic, social, emotional, and

01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.840
mental health needs and by addressing opportunity gaps that existed before and were exacerbated by

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:25.360
the pandemic. It includes two focus areas, which are the LEA plans for use of ARPS funds and LEA

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:33.760
consultation. I think it is important to note that LEAs recently completed two additional plans,

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:42.560
the expanded learning plan required by AB 86 and the local control and accountability plan.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:48.560
There is significant overlap in plan requirements as well as the process for completing these plans.

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:54.400
Over the course of the last few months, LEAs have been engaged in a collaborative process

01:43:54.400 --> 01:43:59.520
with stakeholders to better understand student needs and to collect feedback for strategic

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:06.400
resource allocation. The federal funds received through ESSER III do not comprise the core funding

01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:12.000
for LEAs but rather offer a way to provide additional support to needs that may have

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.240
already been identified. To reduce duplication of effort and promote coherent planning,

01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:23.840
LEAs will be provided with the flexibility to reference or include actions described

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.400
in existing plans to the extent that those actions address ARPS requirements which have

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:36.320
already been discussed with stakeholders. When referencing or including actions in other plans,

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:43.360
the LEA must specify the amount of ARPS funds that it intends to use to implement the actions

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:50.000
and these ARPS funds must be in addition to any funding for those actions already included in the

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.280
plans referenced by the LEAs. Any existing plans referenced by the LEA will be required to be

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:03.760
accessible and available to the public. While LEAs may connect the expenditure plan with other

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:10.720
existing plans, they must still include a description of the action in the expenditure plan.

01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:18.160
We just had a Tuesday at two yesterday with many of our LEAs and communicated this directly to them

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:26.800
as well. The interim final requirements for SER III state that the SEA establishes

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:33.520
the deadline by which LEAs must submit SER III expenditure plans and that the deadline must be

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:40.480
reasonable and should be within no later than 90 days of LEAs receiving their SER III allocation.

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:47.840
The September 30th deadline complies with this as it is approximately 90 days from the cutoff

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:53.440
for LEAs to submit assurances indicating they will comply with all program requirements.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.240
However, following discussion with the U.S. Department of Education, ED clarified that it

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:06.880
is guidance that the deadline should be 90 days after LEAs receive funds. Since the ED has now

01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.360
clarified the 90-day deadline is part of guidance rather than a requirement, CDE proposes the

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:20.240
deadline for the expenditure plan be pushed back until October 29th. The state views this as a

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:26.000
reasonable timeline given California's later budget process relative to when it received funds

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:34.000
and all the work LEAs have to do around COVID-19 thus far. While this additional time allows LEAs

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.600
the ability to further develop their plan for using SER III funds including consultation with

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:45.920
stakeholders, the extended deadline should not be viewed as a prohibition against spending funds

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.880
until the expenditure plan has been submitted. The purpose of SER III is to prevent, prepare for,

01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:58.880
and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and these funds enable LEAs to do so accordingly.

01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:06.000
LEAs are also required to describe their efforts to meaningfully consult with stakeholders within

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.720
their SER III expenditure plans. This includes community engagement, how the LEA promoted

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:19.600
community engagement, how the development of the plan was influenced by that input,

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:26.880
and efforts for meaningful consultation. This may sound very familiar. As mentioned above,

01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:33.440
the expanded learning plan completed by LEAs by June 1st, 2021 and the local control and

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:39.520
accountability plan that was due to county offices of education by July 1st have similar

01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:45.840
requirements. I will say as a former superintendent I appreciated when there was an intentional

01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:53.520
effort to align state and federal requirements which is why LEAs may reference or include

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:59.200
input provided by stakeholders and community members during the development of existing plans

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:07.920
as long as it is applicable to the use of ARPS or funds. The second to last section,

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:14.080
we're almost done, two more, requires that the state describe how educator workforce will be

01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:20.560
supported. This section includes two areas of focus, supporting and stabilizing the educator

01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:27.600
workforce and staffing to support student needs. The first portion of this section is focused on

01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:33.200
the extent to which there is an educator shortage, how the state will assist LEAs in identifying the

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:39.520
most urgent areas for shortages or potential shortages, and steps to fill anticipated gaps

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:46.240
for certified teachers. The draft plan clearly lays out that California has shortages in a wide

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:52.240
range of teaching and support staff positions, and in recognition of that shortage, California

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:58.560
has used both state and federal funding to retain educators. The state stabilized funding

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:05.200
levels for LEAs throughout the pandemic to ensure that changes in enrollment did not impact existing

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:11.600
programs and staffing levels. AB 86 provided funding for a learning recovery program for

01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:18.320
vulnerable student groups. It required LEAs use at least 10 percent of their LCFF entitlement to

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:24.880
hire paraprofessionals to provide supplemental instruction and support throughout the duration

01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:32.160
of the ELO program, with a priority for full-time paraprofessionals. Additionally, the state budget

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:39.200
for 2021 also allocates significant funds for workforce preparation, as well as staff retention

01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:47.040
and training. A few, and just a few examples, include 350 million one-time Proposition 98

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:53.200
general fund over five years to support teacher preparation residencies in designated shortage

01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:00.880
areas and other grow-your-own teacher credentialing programs. 125 million one-time proposition 98

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.960
general funds over five years for the classified school employee credentialing program to support

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:12.320
more than 5,000 classified school staff in becoming credentialed teachers, particularly

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:20.560
in designated shortage areas, and 1.5 billion one-time Proposition 98 general fund over five

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:26.400
years for the educator effectiveness block grant to provide local education agencies with training

01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.480
resources for classified, certificated, and administrative school staff in specified high

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:39.600
need topics, including accelerated learning, re-engaging students, restorative practices,

01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:46.880
and implicit bias training. Three billion was allocated to expand and strengthen community

01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:52.640
schools so they can become stable hubs that support a wide spectrum of student needs to

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:59.040
ensure students have the supports they need for learning, including integrated health,

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:04.400
mental health, and social services, alongside high-quality supportive instruction through

01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:09.840
expanded learning time, including tutoring. These funds are targeted at communities with

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:20.240
high levels of poverty. 1.1 billion of ongoing funding was established to increase the numbers

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:26.000
of adults providing direct services to students. The funding will increase the grants that are part

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.280
of the local control funding formula that provide additional funding to LEAs that have high

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:38.080
concentration, over 55% of low-income students, English learners, and foster youth. The LEAs

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:42.560
that receive the funds will be required to demonstrate how they increase the number of

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:49.840
school staff on their campuses, including teachers, counselors, nurses, paraprofessionals, and other

01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:58.400
staff. The final section of the plan requires states to detail how it is building capacity

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:04.960
at the SEA and LEA levels to ensure high-quality data collection and reporting. It also requires

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:10.080
the SEA to safeguard funds for their intended purpose. It is part of an effort to promote

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:18.160
and maintain transparency on how S or 3 funds are used. This section includes two focus areas,

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:22.240
capacity for data collecting and reporting, and monitoring and internal controls.

01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:29.360
The state will continue its capacity and building the capacity of its LEAs to collect data on

01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.120
reporting in the following ways. California publishes the California School Dashboard and a

01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:42.080
variety of additional reports annually to provide information to parents, schools, and the public

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:47.600
regarding the progress of California's districts and schools across a variety of indicators

01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:54.560
disaggregated by student group. Schools and LEA accountability report cards also play a role

01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:00.240
in collecting and data reporting. This data includes the following disaggregated by student

01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:05.200
groups where applicable. Assessment results, including assessments other than the California

01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:11.280
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, chronic absenteeism, suspension and expulsion,

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:16.800
student access to properly credentialed and assigned teachers, school staffing reports,

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:23.600
results of school climate surveys, and per pupil expenditure data. Data Quest, which is something

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.760
we don't talk about enough, is a fantastic resource which also serves as an invaluable tool to

01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:36.000
provide information to parents, schools, and the public. In addition to CDE's reporting,

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.400
California developed an aggregate level data collection known as the school reopening and

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:48.160
summer instruction status dashboard to inform parents and the public about the current

01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:54.560
instructional status of each LEA and the school plus data on summer instruction. The additional

01:53:54.560 --> 01:54:00.400
data collection and reporting structure will be in place through the 21-22 school year.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:06.640
Like the CDE process, LEAs have access to technical assistance related to collecting

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:14.480
and reporting this data via a helpline. The CDE provides both monitoring and internal

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:20.560
controls through a variety of measures, including extensive guidance related to the coronavirus

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:27.280
responses on numerous webpages that are continuously updated as a resource for both LEAs

01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:34.560
and the public. CDE has and will continue to provide technical assistance by offering

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:40.880
extensive virtual ESSER and GEER training and presentations on various platforms to a wide

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:47.600
variety of audiences. Additionally, LEAs make contact the education stimulus box for additional

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:55.200
information, questions, and support. To ensure transparency at the state level, the CDE created

01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.440
a reporting portal for LEAs to report quarterly on federal stimulus fund expenditures, including

01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:08.080
ESSER and GEER, and percentages spent on each of the allowable activities. The CDE staff

01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:16.000
check for accuracy and completeness of information. The reported information will assess CDE during

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:24.080
monitoring reviews of the LEAs and the use of CARES, CRRSA, and ARP funds. In addition,

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.280
the California School Accounting Manual provides accounting policies and procedures

01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:37.040
and implementation guidance for LEAs. The CDE audit team also selects LEAs each year

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:44.240
for a federal program monitoring review using a risk-based approach. The CDE will conduct

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:51.120
monitoring reviews of federal aid using CDE's monitoring tool, and staff will follow up on any

01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:58.960
findings and additional corrective action that is required of the LEA. In conclusion, the California

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:04.960
Department of Education and the State Board of Education staff recommend that the SBE approve

01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:10.960
the draft of California State Plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School

01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:17.840
Relief Fund submission to the ED pending the SBE Executive Director approval of final revisions

01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:24.400
requested by the SBE in correction of any typographical errors. This concludes my presentation,

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:27.040
and I will turn it back over to you, President Darlene Hammond.

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:40.240
Thank you very much for that thorough and clear presentation. We appreciate it. At this point,

01:56:40.240 --> 01:56:45.600
we'll open the phone line for the public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:51.200
comment on this item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:56.480
code provided on the slide that is shown now. While we are waiting for members of the public

01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:02.320
to call in, I want to ask Member Sun if she has any initial comments before me, then I will ask

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:09.360
board members if they have any clarifying questions before we go to public comment,

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:16.560
and then we'll save our substantive questions for board discussion. So with that, Member Sun.

01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.680
Thank you. Very well organized and detailed presentation indeed. Thank you so much,

01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:29.920
Deputy Superintendent Maves. So you mentioned at the very beginning of your presentation about the

01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:35.920
fierce team that put this plan together and absolutely agree that in such a short time,

01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:43.200
the requirement that this took this plan took multiple divisions within CDE and coordination

01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:47.440
of that and the coordination of even multiple agencies within the state.

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:54.240
And also getting the stakeholder feedback, including a special meeting with the CPAC

01:57:55.040 --> 01:58:01.680
so that you had their input into this plan as well. So a couple of things additionally to note

01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:09.520
and highlight from your presentation. I really appreciated that you provided the context for this

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:15.520
plan and the uses of the funds will be embedded within the California way,

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:24.000
within our LCFF framework, the dashboard and the LCAP. And so this provides that template or the

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:31.200
framework from which the LEAs will be able to utilize these funds and be part of their strategic

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:43.600
plan moving forward after the pandemic. I also want to that the plan also balances that local

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:51.200
control and the flexibility for LEAs to utilize those funds with the transparency of how those

01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:57.920
funds will be utilized. So all of those are highlighted and were questions that were raised

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:04.080
by stakeholders and by the CPAC. And I really appreciate that you and your team have

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:08.240
done such a great job in addressing those. Thanks.

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:19.280
It's really helpful in California that we are really trying to integrate our planning for this

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:27.120
substantial amount of money with the state budget, with the other initiatives that I

01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:36.160
described earlier so that we really have a way to take advantage of building a system with these

01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:42.000
funds. So I appreciate the way in which the department, the board and others have worked

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:48.000
together on this. And as you say, it was a lot of work. Appreciate all of the clarity in the

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:59.760
processes as well as the substance of the work. We are, as noted, we asked for an extension

01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:04.240
for California so that we could integrate this with the state budget process,

02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:13.440
allow the state board to act on it in a timely way. And of course, it's reasonable then for the locals

02:00:13.440 --> 02:00:21.840
to have at least a 90-day period after this to do the work so that they have funds, they can

02:00:21.840 --> 02:00:26.400
continue to use them, but to really be sure that they're thinking about the integration of those.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:33.680
So I'm pleased with where California has been in this process and how we've gotten to this place.

02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:40.720
And I think the department is leading us in a very productive, systematic and systemic direction,

02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:46.400
which I think is so important so that we're not just creating a Jackson Pollock,

02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.840
throw the paint at the wall kind of approach to the funding and the spending, but really

02:00:52.800 --> 02:01:01.040
developing a tapestry of programs and supports that will be effective and efficient also in

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.240
the use of the funds. So Eileen, do you have a clarifying question?

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:11.040
I do. And again, building on Member Sung and President Darling-Hammond's comments,

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:18.560
Deputy Superintendent Magues, what a thorough and clearly presented item. I do want to ask you to

02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:27.200
clarify the number of plans that a local district has to complete. So I appreciated what you said

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.360
that we're trying as a state policy to not overlap, but to make the system fit together.

02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:39.040
And you're building on the plans the districts have already prepared. So is there a way for you

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:45.760
to summarize as a result of all these different funds, what are plans that the local districts

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:55.440
have to complete? Sure. I would be happy to, Vice President Strauss. The first plan that an LEA had

02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:01.200
to complete was through the learning loss mitigation funds, which was the learning continuity plan.

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:11.040
The second plan was the in-person through AB 86 for the IPI grant, which was the safe return

02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:15.520
to schools plan. That one, they could either use an existing plan that they had in place

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:22.800
by March 11th, or they had to use an updated template. The expanded learning grant

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.880
also required a plan. And then we just completed the state local control and accountability plan.

02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:36.240
So now they're ideally, I think what we would see as they've done a number of

02:02:36.240 --> 02:02:40.960
stakeholder engagement around these plans that as we head into the expenditure plan,

02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:47.440
we're not siloing that we really are leveraging what we have as the California way and integrating

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:56.080
these pieces and looking at how they can build upon. Terrific. Thank you. And I know that

02:02:56.320 --> 02:03:02.720
effort is appreciated even while the situation continues to be complex

02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:08.800
for both our state agencies and our districts. Seeing no more clarifying questions, I'm going

02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:15.120
to move to public comment and then we'll do discussion after the comment. Are there any

02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:22.480
public comments? Yes, currently we have 18 people in the queue. Callers, just a quick reminder that

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:29.520
this is only for item two. If you're calling for another item, please wait until that item is called.

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.840
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.520
Good morning. I'm Ruth Barajas from Californians Together, and I'd like to talk about the negative

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:49.600
impact of the timing for the LEA's planning processes. The draft state plan references

02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:59.360
the LCAP is due July 1st, 2021, and the adoption of the 2021-22 state budget in June. And 4.6

02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.400
billion more for schools will be provided to provide targeted interventions with students

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:09.920
who've been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Extra funding is great,

02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:14.880
but as a former elementary school principal and district EL specialist, I'd like to state the

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:20.320
obvious. Plans are developed based on resources available. In all likelihood, these additional

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:24.240
billions of dollars were not reflected in the LCAP spending plans passed by the local governing

02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:29.760
boards on July 1st. There have been very limited input with the state ESSER plan on these funds,

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.720
especially considering that there was revision posted just 36 hours ago. So we urge the state

02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.560
board to please provide for written feedback on this new version of the plan prior to submission.

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:46.800
Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:04:46.800 --> 02:05:00.320
Your time starts now. Caller, you're live. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:09.600
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Good morning. My name is Dr. Barbara Flores,

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.240
and I am the current COVID president and school board member of the San Bernardino City Unified

02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:19.840
School District since 2008. I would like to bring attention to the following. In the draft state

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:26.400
plan, identified needs are listed by required subgroups. However, the descriptions of how the

02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:33.120
needs will be met with ESSER funds are not included in the plan. The federal template requires a

02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:37.040
description of programs and interventions by subgroups, which is currently not contained in

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:43.680
the draft. We urge the SBE to request the department as specific examples. For example,

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:48.720
for English language learners, we need to purchase by literacy digital platforms that are multi-sensory

02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:54.800
and multi-faceted, such as Footsteps to Brilliance or Mayan that provide a variety of digital books

02:05:54.800 --> 02:06:00.160
and foundational skills that students can have access to. Our focus needs to be on equity,

02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:06.160
access, and innovation programs to enrich and expand our ELs and teachers' pedagogical repertoire.

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:10.800
San Bernardino City Unified is doing just that, and we will use the money to expand the depth and

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:16.400
breadth of their use. Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:25.760
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Yes, good morning. This is Liz Guillen with

02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:33.040
Public Advocates of the LCFF Equity Coalition. We recognize and really appreciate the challenge of

02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:39.200
producing documents and revisions and a certified timeline that Deputy Superintendent Mays and her

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:45.280
colleagues at the department are responsible. First of all, we thank the department for allowing

02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:51.600
more time for LEAs and their communities and stakeholders to engage and plan intentionally

02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:58.080
and in a way that integrates and adds to existing plans. We're still in the process of reviewing the

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:04.560
very latest revisions. However, I do want to point out that on the educator workforce, the

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:12.800
definition around teachers, we still urge that the definition be changed so that it is technically

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.640
correct as opposed to calling for properly credentialed teachers, but to really look at

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:26.400
the definitions that we use here in California. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:34.960
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Good morning, President Darlene

02:07:34.960 --> 02:07:39.440
Hammond and members of the board. I'm Jennifer Hicks, Assistant Superintendent of Educational

02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:46.080
Services at the Placer County Office of Education and the 2021 CISC Care. I'm sharing these comments

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:52.560
on behalf of CISC and CSF. We support and appreciate the effort to promote coherent planning

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:58.240
for LEAs by allowing LEAs to leverage the work that they've done over the past several months

02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.520
with stakeholder engagement, with the identification of their local needs, and then the development of

02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:09.920
their actions and services. This approach really allows LEAs to strategically plan for how to best

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:15.520
use their SR funds while also supporting and building on their existing funding and initiatives.

02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:21.040
As revisions are being considered, we would also encourage highlighting the strong partnerships

02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:26.880
in collaboration with county offices of education and specific examples of how this strategic

02:08:26.880 --> 02:08:32.880
partnership will support the implementation of the plan and the critical work to safely reopen

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:40.320
schools as well as ensuring their continuing safe operation. Thank you. Your time's up. Thank you.

02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:46.160
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:58.160
Good morning. This is Robert Manoring with Children Now. I just wanted to comment most focused on

02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:07.520
the local, the LEA template, and wanted to first acknowledge that this budget is the most significant

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:14.560
investment in the state of Iowa. It's the largest investment in the state of Iowa. It's the largest

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:21.440
LEA template, and wanted to first acknowledge that this budget is the most significant investment

02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:28.720
that I've seen in my entire 20-plus year career. There's almost $50 billion of new resources,

02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:37.040
and this $13 billion pot needs to be put in that context. The template for the LEA

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:43.920
misses really an opportunity to integrate in a way. There are no outcomes that are required to be set

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:51.200
for how these funds will be used and what they will achieve. There isn't an explanation of how

02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:57.440
this $13 billion fits into the broader picture. There isn't an emphasis of how these efforts will

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:05.120
be sustained when these one-time funds go away. And finally, there isn't the focus on programs

02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:12.240
and interventions for targeted subgroups and how that differs from LCAP funding, which is a lot

02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.800
for school and district-wide purposes. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and

02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:28.000
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Jamie Mauhai with Head Start California.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.800
Head Start California represents the nearly 150 Head Start grantees in California, and annually

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:38.240
we serve over 100,000 kids and families. Our programs are based on the whole child, whole

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:42.000
school, and whole community approaches, so we are pleased that Dr. Darling-Hammond is committed

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:46.960
to ensuring this model continues through the universal pre-K expansion. We also wanted to

02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:53.120
thank Superintendent Thurman and his team at CDE for their support and funding for Head Start in

02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:58.320
response to pre-K and TK expansion. Unfortunately, we did not get the $50 million appropriation we

02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:02.000
asked for, but we were still called out in the budget with the pre-K planning grant, so we're

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:07.680
grateful for your help in securing that. We are hoping that California can ensure equitable support

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:12.880
for all Head Start programs by investing $50 million of the ARP and ESSER funds each year for

02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:17.840
the next two years to support Head Start and Early Head Start programs with flexibility at the program

02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:23.520
level to use this funding to address staffing shortages, increase outreach to serve more families,

02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.560
and help Head Start programs transition to Early Head Start as the transition to TK and pre-K moves

02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.400
forward in the state. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.880
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:45.440
Hi, this is Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools. For the last

02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:49.840
16 months, our school districts have worked hard to develop several state and federal plans and

02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:55.200
reports and establish local priorities, identified student needs, and detailed how they are going to

02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:00.800
spend their state and federal dollars, all of this with stakeholder input. In Riverside County,

02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:05.840
our districts developed their plans and reports in alignment with their LCAP, which also had

02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:11.360
stakeholder engagement. We saw our districts leverage partnerships to enhance their stakeholder

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.040
engagement process and use technology platforms to offer virtual forums, increasing both

02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:22.800
opportunities for input as well as number of participants. We believe the draft plan continues

02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:28.000
to offer school districts with the opportunity to further align and complement the extensive work

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:33.840
that has been done so far with stakeholder input and respectfully ask for the board's approval of

02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:39.760
the draft plan. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:48.640
record. Your time starts now. Hello, my name is Eric Bonickson. I'm the Superintendent of Placerville

02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:53.600
School District, a small school district in El Dorado County serving about 1,300 students.

02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:00.400
I fully support the plan that CDE has put forth. If we must do another plan, that plan needs to be

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:06.720
concise, succinct, and to the point. That type of plan will be understood and implemented. A long,

02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:13.040
drawn-out plan will not. As a small district administrator, you want me to spend my time

02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:18.320
working with students and teachers, not spending my time sitting in my office writing plans and

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:26.320
reports. A long plan does not mean a good plan. It is just a long plan. I strongly urge a yes vote

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:33.280
on CDE's proposal and welcome the state board and CED to work with small districts of California

02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:39.680
to reduce unnecessary work so that we can spend our time with our children. Thank you. Thank you.

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:45.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:52.720
Good morning. This is Dr. Katherine Reimer from the San Ardo Union Elementary School District.

02:13:52.720 --> 02:13:58.880
I'm a very small school district of about 120 students in South Monterey County. We do appreciate

02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.760
and support the work that CDE and the State Board of Education has put forth into the plan.

02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:11.040
I will say as a very small school superintendent principal, that is also completely modernizing my

02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:17.520
facilities at this time that the stress of writing the plans and the time that it takes for us to

02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:24.320
write the plans has become overwhelming in the past year. I have brought students back to campus

02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:29.520
and it's very imperative for me to be with my staff and students during this time and I would

02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:36.000
appreciate that you take that into consideration. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.600
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Hello? Yes. Caller, you're live. Good morning. My name is Lorraine Richards and I am a classroom

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.800
teacher representing the California Teachers Association. CTA appreciates the CDEs and

02:14:54.800 --> 02:15:00.400
State Board's efforts to develop the draft state plan and CTA is fully supportive of the three

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:05.440
priorities laid out in the draft state plan and have been advocating for them tirelessly since

02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:10.320
the start of the pandemic. We believe there is a need for intensive high quality tutoring and

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.480
robust academic support for students and we urge the CDE and State Board to provide guidance to

02:15:16.480 --> 02:15:23.440
the LEAs to ensure these resources are being used most effectively. With the extension to October 29th

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:29.520
stated today, we recommend that the CDE provide strong guidance to ensure that authentic stakeholder

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:35.200
engagement occurs and impacts the expenditure plans prior to their submission. Lastly, we believe

02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:40.560
that this is truly unique opportunity to leverage state and federal funds at a magnitude that has

02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.840
never been seen before. Thank you for your time. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your

02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:54.320
name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. I am Martha Hernandez, Executive

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:59.920
Director of Californians Together. I want to thank Rachel Maves for her excellent presentation

02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:05.600
and her team for their tremendous efforts on this item. We wish to highlight the issue of supplement

02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:11.040
versus supplant for the use of these additional funds. We urge that the directions to the LEA

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:16.960
expenditure plans be amended to request districts to describe how they are supplementing programs

02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.800
and services in their LCAP. Identified needs are listed by required subgroups, however,

02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:27.920
descriptions of how these needs will be met with the additional funds is not included in the plan.

02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:34.320
In the section maximizing state-level funds, there should be a link between the needs and the plan,

02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:39.760
services, and expenditures. We urge the board to request the department to update this section

02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:44.960
to meet the requirements of the federal template for these funds to require a description of

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:50.640
programs and interventions by subgroups which is currently not included in the state draft.

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:56.800
Thank you very much. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:05.040
Your time starts now. My name is Tim Taylor, executive director of the Small School District

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:11.120
Association representing 62 percent of the schools in California, and we fully support CDE's draft

02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:16.480
plan and commend staff and others that focus on doing their best to condense multiple plans and

02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:21.760
reduce the redundancy of work schools are being required to do. We are still in the middle of a

02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:26.560
pandemic and we have dozens of small schools that had to close because of the raging wildfires

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:31.920
and we need to make sure we focus on our students and their well-being. We welcome working with

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.440
other associations, CCE, CDE, and equity groups, and the state board to immediately address

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:42.160
efficiency of all plans. I also recommend we work with Secretary Cardone in Washington

02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:47.760
to change the redundant processes at USDE so he's fully aware of the stress they are putting on

02:17:47.760 --> 02:17:53.600
districts and state agencies. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and

02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:56.480
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:04.240
Hi, my name is Cecil Edwards. I'm the superintendent principal of Baker Valley Unified School District.

02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:09.840
We're a small K-12 district situated on I-15 between Barstow and Las Vegas and have about

02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:16.720
125 students. As a small district superintendent, I fully support the plan as it focuses on plans

02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:21.200
that we've already written this past year. That's a good start, but we still spend way too much time

02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:25.760
on plans and it's hurting our ability to run districts and support our students and families.

02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:30.560
Even the IRS provides less requirements to submit their taxes for people who make less money.

02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:35.440
Why am I submitting the same documents for 125 students as Los Angeles Unified School District

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:40.720
with 700,000 students and a staff to support those requirements? As the only administrator on site,

02:18:40.720 --> 02:18:45.760
adding additional reporting requirements takes me away from the students. As we come back this fall,

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:50.400
I want to spend time with students and staff not making or writing more reports. Thank you.

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:57.120
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:03.360
Good morning, President Darley-Hammond and the state board. My name is Dr. Marlene Batiste and

02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:07.360
I'm the director of state and legislative affairs for CABE and a director for the Oxford School

02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:11.360
District. I think it's important that the state board understand that districts wrote their LCAPs

02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:15.520
prior to ESSA funds and that the plan in place takes into account the way the districts will use

02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:19.760
their regular state funds to support their unduplicated student counts. We are now to use

02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:24.000
ESSA funds to do those things in our LCAPs. Those would be supplanting not supplementing.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.440
Our district has taken ESSA funds into consideration and made additional plans

02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:32.160
such as hiring literacy intervention teachers for all K-5s to support our unduplicated student

02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.320
counts for learning loss. This is above and beyond our current LCAP plan. If we are to use

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:40.560
ESSA funds appropriately and ensure that those students with the most need receive support,

02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:44.960
we need to require districts within the state plan to briefly explain how they will use these funds

02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.520
above and beyond our current LCAP plan with stakeholder input in order to hold ourselves

02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:55.680
and all LEAs accountable. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

02:19:55.680 --> 02:20:03.920
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Yes, board president and members,

02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:10.400
I'm Shelly Siegel Coleman from Californians Together and the LCFF Equity Coalition. Pages 38

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:16.880
through 45 address the federal template for maximizing state level funds to support students

02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:22.160
and to address the academic impact of loss instructional time, evidence-based summer

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:27.040
learning and enrichment programs, and evidence-based comprehensive after school programs.

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:32.480
For each of these areas, the plan must describe the programs and interventions and how they

02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:38.640
specifically address the disproportionate impact on student subgroups which are on pages 11 through

02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:45.520
13. English learners are targeted with identified state funds, but there's no indication of what

02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:53.280
these additional ESSER funds will do to supplement the state funds as is now required in the LEA

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:59.040
Expenditure Plan. The federal template requests specificity for addressing the subgroups. We

02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:04.880
urge the state board to direct the CDE and we thank them for all their work, but to revisit this

02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:10.640
section, identify specific... Thank you, caller. ...interventions for individual subgroups. Thank

02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:16.560
you, caller. Your time's up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:25.600
Your time starts now. Hello, Madam President. This is Brian Revis calling on behalf of the

02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:32.000
Education Trust West. We agree with many of our partners in the Equity Coalition in that we think

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:37.600
the state plan could use some refinement. Specifically, we'd like to see greater opportunities

02:21:37.600 --> 02:21:44.480
for engagement in a more specific direction around the use of data. We're concerned that in

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:49.680
parts of the plan it reads as sort of a record of things that were already going to happen

02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:55.840
had we not received the federal money. We'd like to see more done to make sure that new things are

02:21:55.840 --> 02:22:02.880
done to meet students' greatest needs and you can do that through things like making sure LEAs use

02:22:02.880 --> 02:22:08.880
assessment data from state or local assessments to identify students for assistance, or one of

02:22:08.880 --> 02:22:15.360
the recommendations from the LCFF Equity Coalition was for the CDE to update its findings on the

02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:21.520
status of the digital divide so that we know the size of that gap going forward. Thank you very much.

02:22:22.240 --> 02:22:28.480
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:35.040
My name is Stuart Packard. I've been the superintendent for 10 years in Buttonwillow Union

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:38.880
School District, a district that serves state preschool through eighth grade. We're located

02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.680
35 miles west of Bakersfield. I'm currently serving as president of the Small School District

02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:48.960
Association as well. We applaud the steps taken by CDE and its efforts to combine the current

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:53.760
plans with the USR funding. I have been working with folks at PACE out of Stanford University

02:22:53.760 --> 02:22:58.160
to discuss the excessive paperwork and plan requirements that already exist for all schools

02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:02.560
but are truly burdensome on small school districts. I encourage these efforts to go

02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:07.200
further and would like to suggest the use of infographics which we use and attach to our

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:13.040
already 100-page LCAP. Our school community members, which is comprised of 95 percent

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:18.320
SED and 67 percent EL and who we know by name want our school to provide a safe environment,

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:23.120
a strong learning environment, and a quality school facility. We signed up to work with

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:27.040
our communities, teach students, and coach teachers. I shared with the folks at PACE that

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:31.920
we have nearly 20 different plans that must be written. The work required on these documents

02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:36.080
takes us away from working with students and staff to improve our schools. Thank you again

02:23:36.080 --> 02:23:39.280
on trying to combine plans on behalf of the small school throughout the state.

02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:44.400
This concludes public comment for item number two.

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:48.720
Thank you very much.

02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:54.480
At this point, we can begin board discussion. Board members, please remember to raise your hand in

02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:02.480
the participant panel of Zoom if you have a question or comment. Are there questions or comments?

02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:15.280
Looks like Member Rucker and Member Glover-Woods. Member Rucker.

02:24:19.040 --> 02:24:27.600
First of all, I want to say thank you to the CDE staff for all of the work that they did

02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:35.440
to put this plan together. A comprehensive state plan is an interesting piece of work.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:42.560
There's a desire to be comprehensive, to cover all the bases, to cover all contingencies,

02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:50.400
and think about all the different permutations of ways that this work can be done. At the same

02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:57.520
time, there's a desire to make it concise and easy to read and consumable for all of the various

02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:02.640
types of stakeholders who are going to read this document and then figure out what to do.

02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:09.360
I want to thank you for the effort that you made to do that. I also want to thank all of the

02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:15.840
stakeholders who called in because you read the document and attempted to consume it and break

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:22.160
it down into its component parts. In doing that breaking down in its component parts,

02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:29.200
you figured out the places where it was broken or you could break it. I appreciate the comments

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:35.280
that you made about what more needs to be considered. That's where I want to start with.

02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:45.840
Dr. Mays, in speaking about this plan, she spoke to the idea about the goal of alignment

02:25:45.840 --> 02:25:52.000
among all of the multiple plans that LEAs are called upon to write. In response to

02:25:52.800 --> 02:26:00.080
Board Member Strauss' question, she identified at least five plans. Those are just five plans

02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:05.920
related to school planning. There are some other plans related to other activities

02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:12.720
that districts have to do like significant disproportionality or making plans for

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:19.200
textbook adoption. All of those are different plans. One of the things I think that was done well

02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:27.280
by the document was an attempt to get districts and others involved in doing this planning

02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:34.720
to take a look at what you are already doing so that the expression of work and intent

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:42.080
as it relates to the funds that are articulated in this plan are things that you add on.

02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:46.240
But that's where the stakeholders pointed out something that's very important.

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:54.240
There is this need to articulate what is being added on and I'll give a very explicit example

02:26:54.240 --> 02:27:01.120
without naming the LEA. As you all know, I do follow and try to read as many

02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:09.600
LCAP plans and now learning, comprehensive learning continuity plans as I can to understand

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:14.800
what districts are doing and one of the trends that's become very clear is that while districts

02:27:14.800 --> 02:27:21.840
are very clear and very articulate about explaining their intent and what they're doing and how they're

02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:29.760
doing it, what we still have not really given districts good models for is how to actually

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:38.320
create descriptions of how they're using program funding to meet specific identified needs

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:45.600
aligned to student subgroups. And this gets to an accountability requirement that we probably

02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:53.840
don't pay as much attention to as we should. All federal education funds have three types

02:27:53.840 --> 02:28:00.560
of funding accountability, maintenance of effort, supplement not supplant and comparability.

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:09.120
And so I heard in the conversation from almost all of the stakeholders in relation to what the

02:28:09.120 --> 02:28:15.440
plan should say to look at and prioritize the needs of student subgroups that the plan,

02:28:15.440 --> 02:28:22.960
the guiding plan here does not model how the funds can be used to supplement not to supplement not

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:29.440
supplant the funding that schools are already receiving and to supplement not supplant the plans

02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:36.400
that districts already have in place. And so that is a gap in the plan. If the stakeholders from

02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:42.240
multiple groups have read it and can't see it, then it's not, while it may be there, it's not as

02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:49.440
clear as it can be or as it should be. So I think that's important to take a look at and to pay

02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:54.560
attention to. But this plan is a good start. And that's what makes this important. It's not,

02:28:54.560 --> 02:29:00.000
it's a living document, something that can grow and improve. And one of the most important

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.520
anchors of our school planning process is continuous improvement. So with the board's

02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:11.520
action to approve this plan today, it doesn't mean that we're not charging the department staff

02:29:11.520 --> 02:29:18.880
to hear the input from stakeholders and to learn from the concerns that were raised and continue

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:25.680
to improve the plan. I also heard site administrators talk about sitting in their office

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:32.080
writing the plan. One of the most important and comprehensive anchoring elements of the state's

02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:38.720
plan is the focus on stakeholder engagement. So for site administrators who feel taxed by the

02:29:38.720 --> 02:29:47.680
burden of continuing to write plans, I'm concerned that I'm not hearing from them in expressing those

02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:56.160
concerns, the larger responsibility of engaging stakeholders in meaningful ways as this work

02:29:56.160 --> 02:30:03.040
continues and goes forward. Because this is an iterative process, something that's not a one-off,

02:30:03.040 --> 02:30:08.640
something that doesn't happen just to meet the deadline, as was pointed out about the July 1

02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:14.960
LCAP deadline, but something that we should be continuously looking at, continuously revising,

02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:21.040
and continuously asking, are the statements we wrote in this document really reflecting the

02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:27.360
priorities that we are aware of and have our priorities changed over time? Those are two

02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:34.000
continuous questions that we have to continuously live with, and so I'm concerned that there seems

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:39.760
to be expressed from what we heard among the stakeholders, this widening gap about what the

02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:46.960
work of school planning actually means. And so I wish Matt Novel wasn't in Hawaii right now,

02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:52.000
because this would be an instructive activity for him to listen in on, because these are the

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.080
types of bridging work that the collaborative is really going to have to take over and take charge

02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:05.360
of to help reinvigorate the model of not only collaborative engagement, but to make sure that

02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:10.800
all stakeholders have some consonance in the conversation they're having about doing this

02:31:10.800 --> 02:31:16.400
planning. So I think we need to pay attention to how these funds are being used to meet identified

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:24.400
needs. I think you may have frozen.

02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:35.120
African American students are the lowest performing subgroup in this school on all three of the

02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:42.640
statewide tests in every single grade level tested, and not once is that subgroup ever called out as

02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:49.360
a priority or ever identified for a specific type of support that the school district is receiving,

02:31:49.360 --> 02:31:56.560
even concentration grant funding to provide support for. We need to figure out how to have

02:31:56.560 --> 02:32:02.080
that conversation and make sure that change is going forward. Thank you so very much.

02:32:03.440 --> 02:32:10.000
Thank you, Member Rucker. I have Member Glover-Woods, Member Strauss, and Member Patil-Brownson

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:17.280
coming up, so Member Glover-Woods. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and I first just would

02:32:17.280 --> 02:32:25.280
like to say to the CDE staff as well as the SB staff just much gratitude for trying to coordinate

02:32:25.280 --> 02:32:32.960
and develop this plan in such a very short time frame. As Member Rucker says, this is a we're about

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:37.920
continuous improvement. That is one of the foundational pillars of the California way,

02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:43.440
I would say, and very appreciative of the comments that were shared today during public

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:49.920
comment on areas that we might be able to look at and continue to shore up. We're at a time where

02:32:49.920 --> 02:32:58.560
we're receiving an unprecedented amount of dollars to focus on student needs during what has been a

02:32:58.560 --> 02:33:05.200
very unprecedented time, and I think it's definitely a blessing to have those funds in place,

02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:10.160
and there's also the recognition that there have been a plethora of plans that have had to be

02:33:10.160 --> 02:33:16.080
developed at the local level over this last year. So the effort that has been made to try to

02:33:16.080 --> 02:33:24.480
coordinate content from those plans as well as the extension to the end of October to get more

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:31.520
stakeholder engagement and more stakeholder input I think will be very helpful at the local level.

02:33:32.240 --> 02:33:37.680
The reality is, and I might even just be saying something that is quite the obvious,

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:42.560
our students are coming back for in-person instruction. Some have already started and

02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:48.000
over the next few weeks will be there, and we do want with that happening for there to be enough

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:55.680
time for the stakeholder engagement, the feedback, and for LEA staff to be able to welcome our

02:33:55.680 --> 02:34:00.480
students back, ensure that the students and staff have the environment that they need,

02:34:00.480 --> 02:34:05.840
as well as meet the requirements that we've received from ED as well in their planning. So

02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:11.840
again, hopefully that extension until the end of October will allow for those things to coexist.

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:19.120
One last point that I'd like to just make and perhaps even get feedback on if there's feedback

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:25.760
to give is around what happens after plan submission. Again, there have been a plethora

02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:34.480
of plans that have had to be submitted, and that's a good first step, but after October 29th,

02:34:34.480 --> 02:34:41.600
once plans are submitted, I just strongly encourage for CDE staff and for all of us who

02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:48.240
are here to support the LEAs and the students in our state to really look at how do we best

02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:55.840
support the actual implementation from what is decided in these various plans, how we ensure

02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:02.720
that the implementation is actually going to make differences for all of the students in our state,

02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:07.280
as well as some very specific student groups that have been called out in public comment

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:13.040
and by previous board members. So I just encourage us to think beyond plan submission

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:20.320
and to really start to look at the impact of all of these dollars and how we will best sustain

02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:25.920
many of the things that will be started over this time period. Thank you very much.

02:35:30.880 --> 02:35:36.320
Such an important point for us to be thinking about, so thank you. Member Strauss and then

02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:42.480
member Paccio-Brownson. So I want to build on our board member comments,

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.360
particularly member Rucker and member Glover-Woods, and appreciate all the planning and

02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:53.600
implementation challenges going forward as schools reopen. So a couple of comments. First,

02:35:53.600 --> 02:35:58.880
I appreciate the priorities that are identified in the plan, particularly mental health and

02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:04.800
accelerated learning needs as students have a safe return to school, and I appreciate the

02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:10.880
identifying of promising practices. I am concerned that there's, first of all, this is more money

02:36:10.880 --> 02:36:15.760
than most of us have ever seen. We probably remember many more years of budget cutting

02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:20.880
rather than budget enhancement. But because this is money over the next three to five years,

02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:29.280
my fear is that people will just, as previous comment made, do lots of programs to try to see

02:36:29.280 --> 02:36:35.760
what sticks rather than be thoughtful in a coherent, organized, strategic approach.

02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:42.000
So, I mean, there's only so much capacity. People are exhausted from a really tough year.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:46.480
They've taken a week or two off, and now they're getting ready to come back. I want to be really,

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:53.280
I'm hoping that the guidance from CDE will encourage people to be very thoughtful on what they

02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:59.680
look at funding that they have several years to do this with some increased overall funding,

02:36:59.680 --> 02:37:04.800
but some one-time funding to try to make the biggest difference and to collect data

02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:10.000
to show evidence of progress. I think that's really important. And there's lots of data,

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:14.080
not just our state assessments, but local assessments, interviews with students,

02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:19.440
all kinds of ways we can find out how we're doing. But I guess my caution would be that

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:26.800
we give LEAs permission to take their time to do it right, getting students back in a very safe

02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:32.480
way, supporting teachers. They need mental support and collaborative support as well,

02:37:33.200 --> 02:37:39.440
and to be very thoughtful about what strategic interventions they do to enhance and accelerate

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.560
learning so that students can catch up and continue to progress and that there'll be a

02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:51.360
coherent approach. And I always remember Ted Sasser used to say, less is more. And I think we

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:57.200
need to give people permission to be thoughtful so that when the money, one-time money is gone,

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:03.760
and it's a huge amount of money, we have changed practice long-term for students and for leaders.

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:09.760
As Mike Kerr said, the first impact that will change achievement is students. The second impact

02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:14.560
is actually leaders' support. And so I think we need to be thoughtful and give districts

02:38:15.280 --> 02:38:23.280
the permission to take their time to continue to have coherent plans. That's my concern around

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:28.160
trying to make sure there's accountability for what they spend the money on. They collect data

02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:33.200
and evaluate it so that they have a thoughtful plan going forward that really does impact

02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.080
and change our system long-term. Thank you.

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:43.200
That's an important point. And I just want to reiterate that the state money that we

02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:50.640
talked about earlier, money of those are ongoing proposals or they're one-time for five years so

02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:58.320
that we can get a long trajectory. The federal money is at least a three-plus year trajectory

02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:04.960
until 2024 and into the beginning of 2025. There's even a note that extensions can be

02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:11.600
requested. So we should be thinking about, as you said, how this plays out over a period of time,

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:21.040
not rushing to spend it quickly if it's not coherent. Member Patil Branson.

02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:27.760
Thank you. I also just wanted to offer appreciation for the department's presentation,

02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:33.680
as well as all the stakeholders who have been, I think, bird dogging the website

02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:41.440
and eagerly awaiting all of the recent updates and keeping abreast of all of the changes.

02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:50.080
There's three points I just want to make. One is to concur with board member Rucker's

02:39:51.360 --> 02:40:00.480
comments about needing to sharpen the focus and sort of the commentary around how underserved

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.240
students' needs will actually be addressed. I think the presentation we just heard was really,

02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:15.120
I think, clear on the identification of needs for underserved students, but then less clear on how

02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:24.000
the particular additional services would be aligned to those needs. Also, the description for

02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:30.880
targeted services to address African-American students, I think, is also something that needs

02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:39.120
to be lifted up as both what works for African-American students, but the analogy that

02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:44.000
comes to mind is PolicyLink, a nonprofit organization that's talked a lot about the

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:51.360
analogy of curb cuts, curb cuts being for the disabled community, but then being something

02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:59.600
that offers incredible supports for a variety of different types of pedestrians, of people with

02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:06.400
strollers, of people who just need additional assistance, people on bikes, and thinking about

02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:12.640
all the creative ways that services that are targeted for African-American students also

02:41:12.640 --> 02:41:20.400
will have lots of spillover benefits for other students as well. On the stakeholder

02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:28.080
efficiencies, I think, that were described of reusing feedback that has been collected

02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:35.920
through the state budget process, I certainly am hearing LEA leadership talk about the sort of

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:43.760
pull it takes, the amount of sheer power it takes to undertake multiple bites at the Apple

02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:56.240
stakeholder convenings, listening sessions, and I am sympathetic, and I also think at the same time

02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:06.320
that there has to be a balancing, because purely using background from state budget processes that

02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:16.080
ran from January to June has the potential to miss, I think, what are important feedback loops

02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:24.320
from stakeholder groups that may have envisioned state budget process as a limitation of the art

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:29.840
of the possible. They may have different priorities that the state budget process has been adopted,

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:36.080
and some things have been baked in, and some have not, and assuming that what they listed

02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:43.200
as the highest priority in January or February to be the same highest priority based on what

02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:50.800
we know of the state budget that was adopted in June, I think is almost a point in time snapshot

02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:55.600
that doesn't really represent that people are going to have change in priorities, and even

02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:02.320
that priorities are going to change given the COVID year that we're having, and the Delta variant

02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:08.560
changes in terms of how people are thinking about what is highest priority as we approach

02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:17.040
the next school year. The last thing I wanted to lift up is the importance also of saying,

02:43:18.160 --> 02:43:24.480
having clear instructions to say what is an investment that is funded through the

02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:30.000
traditional state budget process and the LCAP process that was adopted previously versus what

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:42.320
is additional to the idea that it's supplemental to not supplant, but having greater clarity so that

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:47.760
LEAs can tell us what the difference is for the federal funding versus what is ongoing funding.

02:43:47.760 --> 02:44:00.720
At this point, I'm seeing Member Rodriguez and Member Sun in the list.

02:44:02.640 --> 02:44:08.640
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. So I'd like to echo everything that my

02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:15.840
fellow board members have said, and also, you know, President Darling-Hammond, when you were

02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:21.920
giving your report this morning, I thought, you know, we're like on the edge of this spontaneous

02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:29.440
unfolding of human potential in California, and, you know, thinking about what Member Strauss said

02:44:29.440 --> 02:44:37.680
about, you know, having the necessary time to think this through, I would also concur that,

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:44.480
you know, there's the time that's necessary to make sure that

02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:51.760
even if it's one-time money that it's spent in a way that adds to the system that we're creating,

02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:58.160
and so that the directions are clear, you know, clarifying the supplementing versus supplanting.

02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:04.160
I'm right there with everyone, and I also want to thank Member Rucker for her comments

02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:13.200
regarding the stakeholder engagement, how necessary that is to be out there talking to students,

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:19.680
to families, to community members, to teachers, and my fear is that when something is rushed,

02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:27.680
all of those voices do get left out, and then we're told what to do. I have been teaching,

02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:34.480
I've been in the classroom for 21 years, and, you know, when there's something that is in a

02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:40.880
hurry, you know, then teachers are told what to do, it creates a lot of stress, and it's passed

02:45:40.880 --> 02:45:44.560
down to the students, right, you know, and like, oh, we have to get through this because of funding.

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:51.920
So thank you for all of your comments, and thank you, CD staff, for this tremendous presentation

02:45:51.920 --> 02:46:00.640
this morning. Very clear. President Darlene Hammond, if I may just add one point of clarification

02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:05.920
because it's come up a few times, and I think that this might help ease some of the questions

02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:10.400
around supplementing versus supplant. I know typically with some of our title funding,

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:15.040
we have really strict rules around that, and the ESSER III funds are a little bit different.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:22.240
ED states that the ESSER funds do not contain a supplanting prohibition, and as a result,

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.480
ESSER funds may take the place of state or local funds for allowable activities. However,

02:46:28.480 --> 02:46:33.760
the program does contain a maintenance of effort requirement, which is designed to keep states from

02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:39.760
substantially reducing their support for K-12 education. So I just wanted to provide that

02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:46.400
quick caveat so that we could get some clarity around the supplementing versus supplanting.

02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:59.040
Thank you. Thank you. That's very helpful. Member Sun? Yeah, thank you. I appreciate that

02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:07.520
clarification, Dr. Maves. So I just wanted to say I really appreciate the comments and the points

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:16.240
that my fellow board members have raised with this. I know that the timeline for this particular plan,

02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:23.360
our California submission application for these funds, has been on a short timeline.

02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:30.960
But ultimately, as President Leonard Darden-Hammond pointed out, the LEAs have until 2024

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:38.960
to spend these funds. So just because we are submitting the plan and the LEAs shouldn't respond

02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.640
by the end of September does not mean that all the money needs to be expended.

02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:51.920
And so there could be a plan for a plan and then to have a more thoughtful process over the next

02:47:51.920 --> 02:48:00.240
couple of years to fully maximize the LEAs plans in a thoughtful way. So when we are ready, I will

02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:09.600
be ready to make the motion to support CDE's recommendation that we approve the draft California

02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:15.440
state plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief on submission

02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:22.320
to ED. I think we are ready for that motion. I see two hands up, but I think they're just

02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:28.000
left up by accident. Remember Patio Brownson and remember Rucker? No, I didn't leave my hand up by

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.960
accident. I put my hand up again. You wanted to talk again. Okay, so hold on to that motion.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:37.920
And we'll come right back to you because I know we want to make this motion and

02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:45.840
have this passed before lunchtime. So we stand between ourselves and lunch. Member Rucker.

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:53.040
Okay, so no pressure. You just told me I'm the one standing between everybody and lunch. So

02:48:53.040 --> 02:49:01.600
let me apologize now. I want to respond to or at least do a check down on what I just heard

02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:10.000
Dr. May say. The comment I made, and I probably was the one that may have created the confusion,

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:15.600
so let me begin by apologizing for that. But I want to make sure I heard her correctly.

02:49:16.640 --> 02:49:20.800
And I'm going to pare it back what I think I heard her say and I wrote it down quickly.

02:49:20.800 --> 02:49:25.360
I believe I heard her say that as it relates to these ESSER funds,

02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:32.400
that the maintenance of effort requirement, a provision that requires states to maintain spending

02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:40.160
at a certain level in order to assure that locals don't dramatically reduce funding for their schools

02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:45.440
or their school district within the school district from year to year, that is maintained

02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:52.800
in the ESSER requirement. But there is no supplement, not supplant language or

02:49:52.800 --> 02:50:00.400
accountability requirement as it relates to the ESSER funds. So districts can use this money

02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:09.520
for other programs or to create programs. I want to remind this board at the beginning of my tenure

02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:15.520
on the State Board of Education, the board was implementing the Quality Education Improvement

02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:23.040
Act program and there was no supplement, not supplant language in the enacting statute

02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:30.000
and in the regular. So as a result, in districts and LEAs that receive these QEIA funds,

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:37.680
what began happening is that districts often remove other funds from those school sites

02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:44.320
and then gave them the comparable amount of QEIA funds. So they met the maintenance of effort

02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:51.200
requirement, but those sites that should have been receiving additional support to provide

02:50:51.200 --> 02:50:59.280
targeted assistance for those students did not gain, did not actually gain additional funding

02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:05.840
to do that incremental support. So while I understand that there is a maintenance of

02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:11.760
effort requirement, what the problem that is missing, and this is how we look at the gap

02:51:11.760 --> 02:51:20.320
in what's not being addressed in the plan, there is no articulated, clear, and specific requirement

02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:26.960
that identifies or matches the challenge of the students who are identified as the priority

02:51:26.960 --> 02:51:33.280
with the funding to address those challenges. So we're still not matching supports and challenges

02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:41.280
without a supplement, not supplant requirement. So I understand the technical thing about supplement,

02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:47.680
not supplant, not being a fiscal accountability requirement, but I don't really see how we're

02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:54.560
going to do this work to match supports and challenges and prioritize the student subgroups

02:51:54.560 --> 02:52:00.080
that these funds are intended to benefit without a supplement, not supplant requirement

02:52:00.080 --> 02:52:05.920
in our state plan. That's all. I think I did that. We can still get to vote on the vote on this and

02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:10.960
get to that. So thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond, for that. Thank you for making that point.

02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:17.520
At this point, I do believe, oh, Member Patia Bronson, did you put your hand back up?

02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:24.640
Okay. Yes. Sorry, I just, I'm, procedurally, I'm just trying to understand because the motion,

02:52:25.360 --> 02:52:34.400
I think, that's in our board book says that we're voting on approval of the plan as written,

02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:42.320
but incorporating feedback from today's discussion as part of a stakeholder engagement

02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:46.400
session. Is that correct? Or am I misunderstanding it? And it's just-

02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:55.680
Maybe we should ask Dr. Mayes to put up the actual recommended motion at this point.

02:52:55.680 --> 02:53:06.960
All right. Maybe the shortcut to what I'm asking is, is there still, within the context of approving

02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:13.520
this motion, room to ask the department to sharpen some of the language around focusing on

02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:22.880
student subgroups and how the funding will be targeted to the needs identified for student

02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:28.480
subgroups. And Rachel, do you want to speak to that question as well?

02:53:31.200 --> 02:53:35.360
Sure. We can ask for certain things. I just want to be sure that that's-

02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:40.960
I think, I think that there are a couple of things to keep in mind in the way in which

02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:46.720
California approaches our budget and identifying some of these needs. There's a

02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:54.160
nexus between what we offer as a statewide approach and then what we require and ask

02:53:54.160 --> 02:54:02.000
and give latitude for LEAs to identify their unique needs and meet those at the local level.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:08.800
So the budget defines a lot of ways in which we plan on supporting our students,

02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:14.720
including community schools, support for mental health, diversifying the teacher workforce,

02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:19.840
getting more teachers into the classroom, paraprofessionals. Those are the ways in which

02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:24.640
we as a state are taking action to ensure that we're supporting these students.

02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:30.400
And then at the local LEA level, there's the ability to get more granular to define what those

02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:36.560
student needs are specific to that local context. And that's where you're going to see some of,

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:42.720
I would say, those more, again, granular or high quality practices that are going to be captured

02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:50.080
and enacted and implemented at that local level. So I think, again, part of our California way,

02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:55.280
as we've talked about it, is trying to give that balance to both of those pieces.

02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:05.760
So I'm sorry, Dr. Mayes, does that mean, because I concur and absolutely agree that this is

02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:12.480
local discretionary decision-making, but I think the request that a few of us have raised

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:18.880
is to ask that the LEAs describe what the nexus between their locally identified subgroup needs

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:24.000
are and the services that will address those locally identified needs.

02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:30.800
And you're proposing that be an addition to the plan?

02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:38.160
To just sharpen the language asking for greater specificity, but not prescribing in any way

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:45.760
what those report would be that the LEA would be deciding upon. But if they're identifying

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:54.320
X need, how they're identifying it with Y support. Linking needs and supports clearly in the plan.

02:55:57.680 --> 02:56:05.200
If I may, I think you were just about to reply, did I? Oh, okay, sorry. Yes, absolutely.

02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:12.800
But I think she's, are you there, Rachel? I apologize, yes. So I think we can look at that

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:19.600
a little bit further and take into account the ways in which we are doing some of that in the

02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:25.200
LCAP and in the Expenditure Plan, because I do think that that is the intention. When we look at

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:31.040
the LCAP template, it clearly asks what the needs are underneath the goals and then the

02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:36.160
are underneath the goals and then the subsequent actions. And that's included also in the

02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:42.720
Demonstration for Increased and Improved Services section. But we will also take a look at the

02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:51.360
Expenditure Plan and take that into consideration. So I think that we could include as part of the

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:57.040
Executive Director Approval of Final Revisions requested just a

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:07.280
clarification in the plan that that's important, that we are looking for that process of linking,

02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:12.720
identify needs and supports to be. And I, you know, in the many, many pages of the plan,

02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:17.440
I am sure that that is stated, but I think we're asking for a fine point on it.

02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:25.360
Yeah, and if I may, I think that was the whole, it was very important to me that we framed all of

02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:32.800
this within the California way in our context of our current funding and accountability system,

02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:38.800
because that is embedded in equity and the identification of subgroups. So it is the

02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:46.320
absolute expectation that these funds would support that process of identification at the local

02:57:46.320 --> 02:57:54.320
level utilizing data. And I think those areas have been addressed. If there are specific areas

02:57:54.320 --> 02:58:00.720
that need to be where the language might be sharpened, if you will, either in the LEA template

02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:07.520
or in the application itself, I do think that we could, that would be part of that.

02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:15.680
I hear us giving that piece of advice. And I think I'm sure it's being heard by our Executive

02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:21.440
Director and by the CDE staff. So I think with that on the table, we could go ahead and make the

02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:29.040
motion, the recommendation. All right. So I will then go ahead and make the recommendation

02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:35.200
that is on the screen there that the State Board recommend that SBE approve the California State

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:41.040
Plan for the American Rescue Plan Elementary Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund submission

02:58:41.040 --> 02:58:47.680
to ED pending the SBE Executive Director tool of final revisions requested by the SBE

02:58:47.680 --> 02:58:52.160
and correction of any typographical errors. And do I have a second?

02:58:52.160 --> 02:58:56.160
I'll second. Thank you very much. Any further discussion?

02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:05.120
I just have a question. So with the, it does say in the language of the motion,

02:59:05.120 --> 02:59:11.600
approval of final revisions requested by the SBE. So Board Member Patil Bronson did ask for

02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:17.360
the sharpening of language and, you know, the unit of, the theory of action places the unit of change

02:59:17.360 --> 02:59:24.800
in our LEA plan at the LEA level, but the theory of action in the federal template places the unit

02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:30.400
of change at the student level. So that's the kind of sharpening of language that Member Patil

02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:36.080
Bronson is particularly asking for to make sure the matching supports we're talking about

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:40.960
is not at the LEA level, but at the student level. So as long as we understand

02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:45.440
those are the kinds of revisions being requested, I'm fine with the motion.

02:59:46.160 --> 02:59:51.760
I think we've reiterated that. And I think our Executive Director and our

02:59:51.760 --> 03:00:04.480
Deputy Superintendent have that understanding. So with that, I think we need a roll call for the vote.

03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:07.040
Brooks, can you call the roll?

03:00:07.040 --> 03:00:09.040
Member Son. Aye.

03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:11.840

Member Patil. Yes.

03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:32.400
President Darlene Hammond. Yes.

03:00:33.040 --> 03:00:33.920
Passes unanimously.

03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:39.440
All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, Rachel and others who contributed to the item.

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:47.360
It is 12 o'clock. We are adjourned for 30 minutes for lunch. Please stay in the meeting,

03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:50.880
turn off your camera and your microphone, and we will see you at 1230.

03:01:00.240 --> 03:01:04.160
All right. Welcome back. Have everyone had a good lunch?

03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:10.000
And at this point, we need to reestablish a quorum. So Brooks, please call the roll.

03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:19.440
Linda Brooks is not available at the moment. Please hold. We'll call the roll.

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:26.800
Please call the roll, then. I'd be happy for you to do it.

03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:32.960
Thank you. You know what? I can do it. Do you have the list, Pam?

03:01:33.520 --> 03:01:39.680
I do have the list, and Brooks has just arrived from his mission.

03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:44.320
All right. I apologize. I had to step out first of all.

03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:48.800
All right. Member Sun. Here.

03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:51.680
Vice President Strauss. Here.

03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:52.880
Member Rucker.

03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:58.080
Member Rodriguez. Here.

03:01:58.640 --> 03:02:02.400
Member Patil O'Rounson. Here.

03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:04.720
Member McQuillan. Here.

03:02:05.360 --> 03:02:08.160
Member Glover Woods. Here.

03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:10.320
Member Fatah. Here.

03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:13.200
President Darling-Hammond. Here.

03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:16.960
We have a quorum. Wonderful.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:23.440
We are moving on to item three, and it is the California Assessment of Student Performance

03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:29.200
and Progress, the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, and the California

03:02:29.200 --> 03:02:34.400
High School Proficiency Examination. We're going to update on program activities.

03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:40.000
The CDE does not recommend any action as this information, this is an information only item,

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:45.360
and it will be presented by Mel Vang of the CDE. Mel, please begin.

03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:56.640
Thank you. I will share my screen.

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:22.640
Thank you.

03:03:24.080 --> 03:03:28.000
Thank you, President Thurmond, President Strauss, and for the Assessment, Development,

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:31.600
and Administration Division at the California Department of Education.

03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:36.320
So agenda item three, again, is an informational item on assessment updates.

03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:44.240
The item provides a summary of the developments and updates related to the California Assessment

03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:49.440
of Student Performance and Progress with an emphasis on the California Science Test,

03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:56.880
the California Alternate Assessment or CAA for Science, the English Language Proficiency

03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:03.120
Assessments for California or LPAC with a focus on the initial administration,

03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:07.520
the California High School Proficiency Examination or CHESB,

03:04:08.080 --> 03:04:11.600
and an overview of the outreach and professional development activities.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:25.440
Just reiterating that there is no recommendation, the CDE does not recommend

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:29.600
any actions for this item, and it is being presented for information only.

03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:33.680
I will begin with the CASP updates.

03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:44.800
As a reminder, the California Science Test is an assessment under CASP,

03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:52.720
and it is aligned with the California Next Generation Science Standards or our California

03:04:52.720 --> 03:04:58.800
NGSS. It is administered to all students in grades five, eight, and once in high school.

03:04:59.920 --> 03:05:04.800
I would like to just highlight a couple key events that support the development of the California

03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:13.440
Science Test. As of today, there is a virtual item writer workshop being held with California

03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:21.200
science educators from July 12th through July 14th, and this is our last day for that event.

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:29.120
So during this workshop, ETS, who is our contractor, trained the educators in writing

03:05:29.120 --> 03:05:36.720
a variety of new items using the three science domains, life sciences, physical sciences,

03:05:36.720 --> 03:05:45.440
and earth and space sciences. And the CDE also continued to consult and meet with our

03:05:45.440 --> 03:05:52.560
national science experts. Just want to highlight that in April of this year, a science summit

03:05:52.560 --> 03:06:02.000
meeting was held with our science experts, and the focus of that was to provide some updates and

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:08.720
impacts on the CASP or the California Science Test over the past year due to the COVID pandemic.

03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:14.640
And during that meeting, our national experts also provided updates to California on projects

03:06:14.640 --> 03:06:20.640
that they are involved in that could potentially be helpful and provide assistance to our science

03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:31.280
team. Next, I will cover a couple activities with the California Alternate Assessment

03:06:32.880 --> 03:06:38.720
for Science, which is an online assessment administered to students with the most significant

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:46.080
cognitive disabilities whose individualized education plan or a program or IEP indicates

03:06:46.080 --> 03:06:53.360
the use of an alternate assessment. So test examiners administer this assessment to students

03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:58.720
one-on-one, and eligible students take the California Alternate Assessment for Science

03:06:58.720 --> 03:07:06.080
in grades five, eight, and high school, just like the regular one. And this assessment consists of

03:07:06.080 --> 03:07:12.480
four embedded performance tasks administered to students as close to instruction as possible

03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:21.520
throughout the year. So with that, for the 2020-21 California Alternate Assessment for Science

03:07:21.520 --> 03:07:30.160
results, California will again report preliminary indicators. We will provide a percent correct and

03:07:30.160 --> 03:07:36.720
an indicator category. So these eligible students in grades five, eight, and high school

03:07:36.720 --> 03:07:41.600
who submitted all four performance or embedded performance tasks will receive preliminary

03:07:41.600 --> 03:07:47.680
indicators. And high school students who met the participation rule for the CAA for science in the

03:07:47.680 --> 03:07:53.760
2020-21 school year have satisfied the federal and state science testing requirement for high school.

03:07:54.640 --> 03:08:01.920
So local educational agencies will receive a downloadable student score extract file

03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:08.000
in the test operations management system, or what we call TOMS, containing these preliminary

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:12.480
indicators for students who took all four of the CAA for science performance tasks.

03:08:13.200 --> 03:08:19.920
The LEAs are encouraged to communicate the individual student preliminary indicator results

03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:25.440
to parents and guardians in a manner suited to their local context. And then the CDE provides

03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:32.960
tools on the preliminary indicator toolkit webpage to assist our local educational agencies

03:08:32.960 --> 03:08:38.160
in reporting preliminary indicator results to educators, parents, and guardians, or other

03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:46.640
stakeholders. Just to highlight a little bit that the California Department of Education will provide

03:08:46.640 --> 03:08:53.120
aggregate preliminary indicator data in the form of that research file in the fall on the

03:08:53.680 --> 03:09:01.680
CAA for science administration research files webpage. And for the CAA for science data,

03:09:02.480 --> 03:09:07.200
this year the preliminary indicators, they will not be sent to the California educator reporting

03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:13.280
system or on the public reporting website, as they are preliminary indicators. And there is no

03:09:13.280 --> 03:09:20.640
official CAA for science student score report generated. So as a reminder, the preliminary

03:09:20.640 --> 03:09:25.520
indicators are not precise enough to stand on their own, and that is why these results should

03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:35.520
not be used to compare students, schools, or districts. With that, another opportunity or

03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:41.520
activity that's happening with the California Alternate Assessment for Science is that there's

03:09:41.520 --> 03:09:48.800
a, our virtual standard study meeting will take place with California science educators as well

03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:58.720
as special education educators in August, from August 3rd through the 5th. And the CDE had planned

03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:06.160
to ask for approval of these recommended threshold scores in November 2021, but however you all know

03:10:06.160 --> 03:10:14.160
what happened that due to the pandemic and that the testing volumes for the 2020-21 administration

03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:21.360
are fairly low, it is not enough to collect sufficient impact data. So the CDE will postpone

03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:26.320
seeking approval of the state's Superintendent of Public Instruction's recommended threshold scores

03:10:26.320 --> 03:10:33.600
from the SBE by one year. And for the standard setting, ETS, our contractor, is implementing both

03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:40.080
the modified ANGOF and the extended ANGOF methods. The ANGOF method is really similar to the method

03:10:40.080 --> 03:10:46.320
that was used for the regular California science test or CAST, and it is widely used, it's a widely

03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:52.880
used approach for standard setting that relies on educator judgments and can be conducted using

03:10:52.880 --> 03:11:00.240
smaller volumes of test data. So included in the standard setting process are the educators taking

03:11:00.240 --> 03:11:06.240
part in making recommendations for the threshold scores that are to be presented to the SBE for

03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:15.280
approval in the future. With that, I'm going to jump to the California English Language Proficiency

03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:18.720
Assessments for California or ALPAC update.

03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:27.840
Just want to highlight the initial ALPAC administration window just opened on July 6th.

03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:35.440
We are continuously moving along in all these different assessments. As a reminder, the purpose

03:11:35.440 --> 03:11:44.080
of the initial ALPAC is to determine a student's English language proficiency if a language other

03:11:44.080 --> 03:11:50.240
than English was indicated on the home language survey. So this assessment transitioned, remember,

03:11:50.240 --> 03:11:56.880
from a paper pencil test to a computer-based assessment last August, and it will continue

03:11:56.880 --> 03:12:04.880
to be administered online except for the writing portion and for kindergarten through grade two.

03:12:06.080 --> 03:12:12.240
So the paper pencil test option that was provided throughout last year due to the pandemic will be

03:12:12.240 --> 03:12:19.040
available in this coming year, but only for students who have a need or express, or there

03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:26.640
is an accommodation written in their Individualized Education Program or Section 504 plan. So training

03:12:26.640 --> 03:12:33.120
has been available since April 12th through our training site called the Moodle Training Site,

03:12:33.920 --> 03:12:40.000
and educators who are testing students have been trained in through that process. So the

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:47.680
CDE continues to provide options to administer the initial ALPAC remotely to assist LEAs. As you all

03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:54.240
know, we're not totally safe out of the pandemic yet, so that those who are testing now have an

03:12:54.320 --> 03:13:00.560
option as they transition back to in-person instruction for the 2021-22 school year.

03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:11.680
Then moving along, I'd like to apprise you of our most recent administrations of the California

03:13:11.680 --> 03:13:18.240
High School Proficiency Examination, or CHESB. Sorry, there's many acronyms, but I'll try to

03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:26.960
explain. CHESB is a test for students who are 16 or older who need to verify their high school

03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:35.120
level skills in reading, writing, and math. And in some cases, students take the test and leave high

03:13:35.120 --> 03:13:43.520
school early to work or to attend college. And those who pass the test receive a Certificate

03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:48.960
of Proficiency, which is equivalent to a California high school diploma in California.

03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:58.240
So with that background, currently the California High School Proficiency Examination is a paper

03:13:58.240 --> 03:14:05.360
pencil test that needs to be administered in person. So it was not administered in October

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:11.600
or May due to health and safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:19.440
As you may recall, there were a number of students or test takers who came and expressed

03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:26.560
their concern about not having this test available as an option for them. So due to improving

03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:34.320
conditions, since that time, such as increased vaccinations and the return to LEAs, or many of

03:14:34.320 --> 03:14:39.920
the LEAs are returning to in-person instruction, it allowed for the administration of the CHESB

03:14:40.640 --> 03:14:48.160
in April and May. And students who had, for that group, we started with students who had previously

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:57.440
taken the CHESB in 2019 or in the summer of 2020 and had one or more subtests that they still have

03:14:57.440 --> 03:15:03.840
to test. And we contacted them first, or Sacramento County Office of Education is the contractor for

03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:10.560
this assessment. Students were contacted in the month of February and these students were offered

03:15:10.560 --> 03:15:17.680
the opportunity to test either at the Sacramento County Office of Education site or the LA County

03:15:17.680 --> 03:15:25.680
Office of Education for a two-week period in April. So registrations was then open for all students

03:15:25.680 --> 03:15:32.320
during the month of April and then for the May administration as well. And the administration

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:38.160
was also available in May at those same two locations. Remember, we couldn't offer many

03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:45.680
across the state. And for those two periods in both months, we were able to assess over

03:15:46.720 --> 03:15:54.560
1,000, but it was more like closer to 1,800 students who had the opportunity to test before

03:15:54.560 --> 03:16:01.120
the summer break. I just wanted to highlight here that it took a lot of effort to do this assessment.

03:16:01.120 --> 03:16:08.240
I want to thank the LA County Office of Education for opening their facilities for us to be able

03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:14.800
to offer an opportunity in Southern California. I want to thank SCOE, the Sacramento County Office

03:16:14.800 --> 03:16:22.720
of Education, our contractor for administering these tests. And also CDE sent a group of staff

03:16:22.720 --> 03:16:30.640
from our assessment office, mainly the CHESB office in our division, to go to Southern California and

03:16:30.640 --> 03:16:36.400
help administer these tests because it was very difficult to get test administrators as well. But

03:16:36.400 --> 03:16:42.000
we wanted to provide the opportunity as much as possible. So led by Don Kilmer, who is the

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:47.360
administrator of the office, they went to Southern California and support the testing effort.

03:16:50.240 --> 03:16:56.080
With that, I want to share some outreach and professional development activities that we've

03:16:56.080 --> 03:17:06.240
been doing recently or in the upcoming time regarding all these assessments or regarding

03:17:06.960 --> 03:17:13.680
summative, interim, or formative components of our state assessment system. A complete

03:17:13.680 --> 03:17:20.640
list of those opportunities is available in the outreach and professional development

03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:26.400
activities section of the July SBE item. I will just highlight some of them here.

03:17:28.880 --> 03:17:37.840
So starting in January, when there was a lot of need for communication with the LEAs, the CDE,

03:17:37.840 --> 03:17:44.080
along with our contractor, ETS, we provided weekly office hours and coffee sessions that provided

03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:49.840
virtual opportunities for LEA staff to ask questions and get answers about the spring

03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:59.520
administration and the options that we were offering. So these office hours centered around

03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:06.480
different topics such as LPAC or the California Educator Reporting System. And they really allowed

03:18:06.480 --> 03:18:13.120
LEA staff to share their local practices and experiences. And then the coffee sessions were

03:18:13.120 --> 03:18:17.920
an open forum for questions and answers. And we did this weekly until the end of May,

03:18:19.360 --> 03:18:26.640
which we changed to monthly in June and July. So the CDE has offered another set of training

03:18:26.640 --> 03:18:34.160
as the new LPAC coordinator training in June 2021. And this full day training was provided by County

03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:41.440
Office of Education partners in 11 locations across the state. And it was the LPAC coordinators who

03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:48.080
are new to their role and for coordinators who want a refresher. So the training included an

03:18:48.080 --> 03:18:56.080
explanation of the responsibilities and time responsibilities for coordinators and also

03:18:56.080 --> 03:19:02.720
timeframes along with procedures and practices to support managing test administration.

03:19:02.880 --> 03:19:09.840
And then in June 16th, ETS on behalf of CDE presented the CASP and LPAC post-tests webinar.

03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:15.600
And that included information about how assessments are scored, where the reports are located in the

03:19:15.600 --> 03:19:22.400
test operations management system, and how local educational agencies can access their reports.

03:19:23.360 --> 03:19:27.440
And then again in June, the Sacramento County Office of Education

03:19:28.240 --> 03:19:33.600
convened a, on behalf of the CDE, hosted three virtual site administrator convenings, which

03:19:33.600 --> 03:19:40.560
featured facilitated discussions with them to collect feedback on their recent experience with

03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:46.800
the state assessments. And in addition, CDE staff provided presentations on the various formative

03:19:46.800 --> 03:19:53.040
and interim assessment resources available from the state, as well as in other states.

03:19:53.040 --> 03:19:58.720
And then in addition, during May and June, the Sacramento County Office of Education on behalf

03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:05.440
of CDE conducted online interim assessment handscoring train-the-trainer workshops

03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:10.400
to support County Office of Education trainers across the state. And then in June,

03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:15.760
the Sacramento County Office of Education convened a, on behalf of the CDE,

03:20:16.080 --> 03:20:21.440
assessment handscoring train-the-trainer workshops to support County Office of Education

03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:27.920
trainers across the state to deliver handscoring training within their regions of the, their region

03:20:27.920 --> 03:20:35.040
of the state. So these, there were four workshops were offered and two focused on English language

03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:43.120
arts literacy and two focused on math. So the County Offices of Education were encouraged to

03:20:43.120 --> 03:20:51.600
participate as a team of either English language arts, mathematics, or assessment staff to attend

03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:58.240
this training to increase their capacity to conduct subsequent handscoring trainings for their

03:20:58.240 --> 03:21:06.880
teachers. Excuse me. And the workshops were really designed to build the capacity of County Office

03:21:06.960 --> 03:21:12.400
of Education trainers to engage educators with their region in understanding how

03:21:12.400 --> 03:21:17.760
calibrating during handscoring can pretty much help deepen understanding of content

03:21:17.760 --> 03:21:23.520
standards for ELA and math, strengthen the evaluation of student work, and promote the

03:21:23.520 --> 03:21:32.880
use of student results to inform teaching and learning. And then starting this month,

03:21:33.520 --> 03:21:40.240
the CDE is kicking off another professional development opportunity called the Interim Informative

03:21:40.240 --> 03:21:47.120
Assessment Training Series. This training is designed to assist LEA staff in understanding

03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:52.880
and using the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments as well as formative assessment process to support

03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:59.360
teaching and learning. This is a live online training series which consists of three modules

03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:06.320
and module one focuses on the purposes of different types of assessment including formative

03:22:06.320 --> 03:22:11.840
assessment and such resources as the tools for teachers and how they work together to support

03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:18.720
learning. And then there is a module two that focuses on how the Smarter Balanced Interim

03:22:18.720 --> 03:22:24.800
Assessments can be used for classroom application. And then module three focuses on using hand

03:22:25.280 --> 03:22:31.200
scoring to analyze interim assessment, written responses, and understanding expectations,

03:22:31.200 --> 03:22:37.280
and determine next steps to support learning. So each module in this live online training

03:22:37.280 --> 03:22:43.280
series will be offered multiple times between July and November of this year. And in addition,

03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:49.360
each module is designated to be independent of the other modules so that educators can customize

03:22:49.360 --> 03:22:56.480
their participation on the basis of the area or areas in which they want to further professional

03:22:56.480 --> 03:23:03.440
development. So any LEA staff interested in this training may find the opportunities listed in the

03:23:03.440 --> 03:23:11.840
training tab on the CASP.org website and also reach out to their county offices of education.

03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:20.800
So with that, I will sum it up. I am towards the end of the presentation. I want to remind you all

03:23:20.800 --> 03:23:29.360
that most of our updated tweets we are on Twitter and much of our outreach activities and resources

03:23:29.360 --> 03:23:38.720
and PD opportunities are also tweeted on Twitter using our assessment handle here at CDE Assessments.

03:23:39.520 --> 03:23:46.960
And then I will stop here to see if there are any questions. President Dolly Hammond.

03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:53.760
Okay, great. Well, I want to start by opening up the phone line for public comment,

03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:58.960
and then we'll come back to clarifying questions and then discussion. So thank you very much.

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:03.760
We're going to open up the phone line. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item

03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:10.560
may do so by calling the phone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is

03:24:10.560 --> 03:24:16.880
shown now. While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, Member Sun and I will offer our

03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:24.640
initial comments as liaisons and then we will see if there are any clarifying questions and then

03:24:24.640 --> 03:24:32.400
we'll go to public comment. So Member Sun. Yes, I didn't have anything too much to add just to

03:24:32.400 --> 03:24:38.960
thank Mao and her team for these updates. They're always very comprehensive and we always see that

03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:46.080
progress continues to be made. And just wanted to recognize the CDE staff that went down and

03:24:46.080 --> 03:24:50.560
actually helped with the administration of the CHVC. I think that's just wonderful that they did that.

03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:58.000
Yes, I do too. And I just want to do the same thing, which is, you know, the amount of outreach

03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:04.160
that this division does is really quite extraordinary in all kinds of ways around

03:25:04.160 --> 03:25:10.640
just about every assessment that we have. So I just want to recognize and thank the staff for

03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:17.360
the outreach for the very professional way that staff has handled assessment over this last year,

03:25:17.360 --> 03:25:25.280
which was so trying and challenging in so many ways. And, you know, they offered weekly office

03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:31.920
hours for districts and facilitated the variety of approaches that were plausible in different

03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:38.400
districts for assessment. And then I just want to also recognize the ways in which the team and Mao

03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:43.200
as the leader of that team is always looking ahead to find ways that we can improve and

03:25:44.240 --> 03:25:52.400
innovate and develop our capacity to support students and teachers in the learning teaching

03:25:52.400 --> 03:25:57.360
process with assessment. So there'll be more about that coming up in our meetings. But

03:25:57.360 --> 03:26:04.400
just to flag now that it really is much appreciated. Any clarifying questions before

03:26:04.400 --> 03:26:10.560
we go to public comment? All right. Let's see if there are any public comments.

03:26:12.320 --> 03:26:19.840
Currently, we have no callers in the queue. All right. Is there any board discussion?

03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:27.040
Again, this is just for information. Questions or discussion?

03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:37.520
All right. We are just dazzled. Well, wait, wait. Member Strauss, there's a hand going up.

03:26:38.560 --> 03:26:43.600
I just wanted to thank Mao and her team. And this is really helpful, even though there's no

03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:49.760
action to give us an update on what the activities are and recognizing the challenges of the spring

03:26:50.240 --> 03:26:55.920
I just want to reiterate what our former other board members said and thank the department for

03:26:55.920 --> 03:27:01.280
all the extensive outreach and support to the field in these really unprecedented times. So I

03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:06.240
just appreciated the update and the specifics. It's really helpful for all of us to know where

03:27:06.240 --> 03:27:11.520
we are in the process in a variety of ways we have assessment. So thank you for the continued work

03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:19.600
from the assessment division. And not seeing any other hands raised. I think we can move ahead

03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:26.000
to item four, which is the California assessment of student performance and progress and the English

03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:31.680
language proficiency assessments for California request for approval to proceed with the California

03:27:31.680 --> 03:27:38.880
assessment system request for qualifications stage four, which is negotiations. And the CDE

03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:44.240
recommends the state board approve the request to begin negotiations with the educational testing

03:27:44.240 --> 03:27:50.880
service for the California assessment system contract to cover five administrations of the

03:27:50.880 --> 03:28:00.400
CASP and the LPAC beginning July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2027. And the item will be presented

03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:12.480
by Malvang. Take it away, Mal. Thank you. I will do that. Let me share my new presentation.

03:28:13.440 --> 03:28:15.440
And go from there.

03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:32.480
So thank you, President Darling-Hammond. I will just proceed with this item. Item number four

03:28:32.480 --> 03:28:40.800
is the procurement update, which is an action item. So in this presentation, I will go over

03:28:41.200 --> 03:28:47.120
the recommendation, the background of the request for qualifications for stage procurement process,

03:28:47.120 --> 03:28:52.080
and share the results of stages one, two, and three with you, and highlight the stage four

03:28:52.080 --> 03:29:01.600
negotiations, the next step in this process. So the action before you is the following. The

03:29:01.600 --> 03:29:06.480
California Department of Education, or CDE, recommends that the California State Board of

03:29:06.480 --> 03:29:13.280
Education, or SBE, approve the request to begin negotiations with ETS, or Educational Testing

03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:19.600
Service, for the California assessment system contract to cover five administrations.

03:29:23.840 --> 03:29:24.640
I'm sorry, there was.

03:29:27.520 --> 03:29:29.440
I think Member Fiddle-Brown. Go ahead.

03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:41.760
Go ahead. Okay. So let me start where I was. So the California Department of Education,

03:29:41.760 --> 03:29:47.760
or CDE, recommends that the California State Board of Education, or SBE, approve the request

03:29:47.760 --> 03:29:53.840
to begin negotiations with Educational Testing Service, ETS, for the California assessment

03:29:53.840 --> 03:30:01.200
system contract to cover five administrations of the California Assessment of Student Performance

03:30:01.200 --> 03:30:07.920
and Progress, CAST, and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, or ALPAC,

03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:13.280
beginning July 1, 2022, through December 31, 2027.

03:30:13.280 --> 03:30:26.080
The CDE issued the California Assessment System Request for Qualifications, or RFQ, as a four-stage

03:30:26.080 --> 03:30:32.000
process to procure its next assessment contract for the CAST and the ALPAC. The four-stage

03:30:33.040 --> 03:30:38.880
approach here allows CDE to identify an assessment contractor with the proven capacity

03:30:38.960 --> 03:30:44.080
and expertise to successfully implement the California assessment system.

03:30:44.080 --> 03:30:51.760
And in attachment one of this item, it includes the consensus scoring for stages one, two, and three,

03:30:52.320 --> 03:31:00.080
and then an evaluation team comprised of local educational agency staff from different regions

03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:07.280
of the state, and staff from different divisions across CDE met after the submissions from each

03:31:07.280 --> 03:31:14.400
stage were received, and they evaluated those submissions. And the potential contractors who

03:31:14.400 --> 03:31:24.480
passed a stage were provided the criteria for the next stage. So in stage one, the qualifications

03:31:24.480 --> 03:31:32.960
round was released in April of 2020. I can't believe it's over a year now. The evaluation

03:31:32.960 --> 03:31:39.760
team met in June to evaluate the submissions, which provided the CDE assurance that the potential

03:31:39.760 --> 03:31:45.840
contractors have the capacity to support the California assessment system before we proceed.

03:31:46.480 --> 03:31:53.040
And we identified 10 key areas of qualification for potential contractors to assure us that they

03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:59.920
have the capacity and the expertise to implement our California assessment system. So two potential

03:31:59.920 --> 03:32:03.520
contractors successfully met the required qualifications,

03:32:04.400 --> 03:32:11.040
excuse me, including Educational Testing Service, or ETS, and the National Computer Systems, NCS,

03:32:11.040 --> 03:32:23.920
Pearson, Inc. With this in, let's say, so in stage one, these are the qualifications results.

03:32:24.880 --> 03:32:32.080
There were the 10 key areas of qualification were worth 100 points each. So for stage one,

03:32:32.080 --> 03:32:38.480
there was a total of 1000 points possible as displayed in attachment one, as well as in this

03:32:38.480 --> 03:32:45.440
table. The evaluation results of ETS and NCS Pearson, Inc. are in columns four and five.

03:32:46.480 --> 03:32:52.720
The 10 key areas are as follow. One, computer-based and adaptive assessments.

03:32:54.000 --> 03:33:01.280
Two, the system access through a single sign-on. Three, the test delivery.

03:33:02.240 --> 03:33:09.200
Four, scoring and reporting. Five, a secure browser, being able to use a secure browser.

03:33:09.920 --> 03:33:16.560
Six, reporting of test results. And then seven, item types and standards.

03:33:17.200 --> 03:33:25.040
Eight, item bank and test forms. And then nine, item development and review process.

03:33:28.640 --> 03:33:33.760
And then 10 is the universal tools, designated supports, and accommodations,

03:33:33.760 --> 03:33:42.480
which are accessibility resources that they're able to do. So the evaluation results for stage

03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:53.040
one were that ETS had 936 points out of 1000, and NCS Pearson, Inc. had 907 points out of 1000

03:33:53.040 --> 03:34:04.000
possible. So moving on to stage two, both contractors or potential contractors earned

03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:10.800
enough points to advance to stage two, which is the mandatory demonstrations stage.

03:34:11.760 --> 03:34:23.040
So the stage two was released in August 2020 to the two potential contractors who passed stage one.

03:34:24.560 --> 03:34:31.280
And for stage two, CDE identified five critical areas for the potential contractors to demonstrate

03:34:31.280 --> 03:34:38.320
their ability to meet the California assessment system needs. And the evaluation team met in

03:34:38.400 --> 03:34:44.960
November to evaluate the submissions received. And each mandatory demonstration was worth 200

03:34:44.960 --> 03:34:52.000
points. And this stage, which is the mandatory demonstration stage, was worth 1000 possible

03:34:52.000 --> 03:34:59.280
points as well. So the two potential contractors who successfully met the required qualifications

03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:06.160
from this round included the, again, Educational Testing Service or ETS and the National

03:35:06.400 --> 03:35:17.520
Computer Systems NCS Pearson, Inc. And here are the results of the mandatory demonstrations.

03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:27.120
The five areas are capacity and performance. The second one was the item types, item functioning,

03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:36.000
and rendering, and item banking. And then the third demonstration was accessibility resources.

03:35:37.280 --> 03:35:43.760
The fourth one was being able to capture scoring and reporting. And then also

03:35:44.400 --> 03:35:48.320
the fifth one was to demonstrate single sign-on capabilities.

03:35:57.120 --> 03:36:09.040
Oh, sorry. And then, so I just wanted to highlight that the evaluation results for stage two were

03:36:09.040 --> 03:36:23.280
that ETS had 953 consensus points out of 1000, and NCS Pearson, Inc. had 892 points out of 1000

03:36:23.280 --> 03:36:32.080
possible. Again, both made it to move on to stage three, which is the formal written submission

03:36:32.080 --> 03:36:42.080
stage. And in this stage, the criteria or requirements were released in February 2021

03:36:42.080 --> 03:36:48.080
to each of the potential contractors who passed stage two, and they both had about a three-month

03:36:48.080 --> 03:36:54.800
period to provide this submission. And in the formal written submission, potential contractors

03:36:54.800 --> 03:37:02.320
were required to submit a draft scope of work and a proposed budget. So the CDE received the formal

03:37:02.320 --> 03:37:08.960
written submissions from the two potential contractors, and the evaluation team met in

03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:15.120
May to evaluate both the draft scope of work and the proposed budget. And the outcome of the

03:37:15.120 --> 03:37:23.920
consensus scoring from stage three, along with the overall scores from stages one, two, and three

03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:29.920
provided us with the recommendation before you today. And I will cover these results

03:37:30.960 --> 03:37:36.480
in the following slides. And again, the results are also available in attachment one.

03:37:36.880 --> 03:37:44.000
So for the technical scoring results, the evaluation team first reviewed and scored the draft scope of

03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:53.280
work and staffing from each potential contractor. The scope of work is broken into nine separate

03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:59.440
tasks, and each task had points based on the nature of their importance to the assessment system,

03:38:00.240 --> 03:38:08.240
as well as staffing for a total of 3,000 points. Available in attachment one, this table also

03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:15.440
displays the task name along with the possible points, and columns four and five are ETS and

03:38:15.440 --> 03:38:25.040
NCS Pearson, Inc.'s results. So task one is the 3.1, it says 3.1, but three is the task section.

03:38:25.040 --> 03:38:34.160
So task one is comprehensive plan and schedule of deliverables. For the task two, it's program

03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:42.160
support and services where much of the training and professional learning occur. And then three is

03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:51.440
technology services to support the system. For task four is about test security. And then the

03:38:51.600 --> 03:39:03.280
task five is on accessibility and accommodations. And then task six is assessment development.

03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:12.560
Task seven is on test administration. And task eight is on scoring and analysis.

03:39:13.280 --> 03:39:20.000
And then task nine is on reporting results. And then staffing was also included in this

03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:27.200
scoring round. So the technical scoring results for stage three were that ETS

03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:38.960
had a total of 2,874 out of a possible 3,000, and NCS Pearson, Inc. had 2,512 points out of a

03:39:38.960 --> 03:39:50.000
possible 3,000 points. Then the next step was that the evaluation team reviewed the budget

03:39:50.000 --> 03:39:59.360
submission from each potential contractor. The number of points assigned for each task

03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:05.520
of the budget submission was a percentage of the overall available points. And for each task,

03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:12.560
the potential contractor with the lowest cost for the task received 100% of the points.

03:40:13.520 --> 03:40:19.520
And then potential contractors with higher costs received fewer points on a per rated basis.

03:40:20.320 --> 03:40:25.360
And I will go over this example so that we have a clear understanding of how this was done.

03:40:26.000 --> 03:40:33.360
The example that I'm going over is also available in attachment one. So for example, let's say task

03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:42.480
Y is worth 42 points. Potential contractor A submitted a bid of 1,000. And then potential

03:40:42.480 --> 03:40:50.880
contractor B submitted a bid of 1,500. And potential contractor C submitted a bid of 2,000.

03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:58.160
So in this scenario, potential contractor A received 100 points of the 42 points possible

03:40:58.240 --> 03:41:06.400
for the task. Potential contractor B whose bid is 66% higher than the lowest bid will receive

03:41:06.400 --> 03:41:15.200
28 points. And then potential contractor C whose bid is 100% higher than the lowest bid

03:41:15.200 --> 03:41:28.720
will receive only 21 points. So the stage three budget scoring results are displayed

03:41:30.000 --> 03:41:39.360
and applying that budget calculation evaluation process that I just described to each of the

03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:52.560
same tasks provides a total of 1,250 points overall for the budget scoring. So again,

03:41:52.560 --> 03:42:03.920
the tasks are the same as in the technical. And then the total here, which the budget scoring

03:42:03.920 --> 03:42:14.800
evaluation results for stage three were that ETS had 880 out of 1,250 possible points and NCS

03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:28.800
Pearson Inc. had 1,165 points out of a total of 1,250 points. So the next thing is to combine

03:42:29.760 --> 03:42:33.440
the overall technical score from stage one, two, and three.

03:42:37.760 --> 03:42:44.320
And this provides a possibility of 5,000 points total. So the overall technical score

03:42:46.000 --> 03:42:57.680
for ETS is 4,763 out of 5,000 possible points and NCS Pearson Inc. with 4,311 out of possible 5,000

03:42:57.680 --> 03:43:10.000
points. So the last step was ranking the potential contractor on the total of all points earned.

03:43:10.000 --> 03:43:16.400
And with the technical score worth 5,000 and the budget score worth 1,250, there was a possible

03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:30.720
6,250 points total. So ETS scored overall score is 5,651 out of 6,250 possible and NCS Pearson Inc.

03:43:31.440 --> 03:43:42.960
scored 5,476 out of 6,250 possible. So this puts ETS first and NCS Pearson Inc. second in the final

03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:48.400
ranking. And this is the process followed to bring this recommendation to you today.

03:43:52.640 --> 03:44:00.720
So if the CDE receives SBE approval today, the CDE will work with the SBE staff and the

03:44:00.720 --> 03:44:06.640
Department of Finance to begin negotiations for the next assessment contract and return to the

03:44:06.640 --> 03:44:10.720
SBE in November with a recommendation for approval.

03:44:14.400 --> 03:44:23.360
At this time, I've concluded my presentation and I will pause here to see if you have any questions.

03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:29.440
So I'll turn it back over to President Darlin-Hammond for next steps.

03:44:30.400 --> 03:44:36.000
Great. Thank you. We'll put up the slide for the public comments so we can get people in the queue.

03:44:36.960 --> 03:44:42.560
There we go. Thanks so much. We're going to open up the phone line for the public comment queue and

03:44:42.560 --> 03:44:47.760
members of the public who wish to provide a comment on this item can do so by calling the

03:44:47.760 --> 03:44:53.200
phone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now. While we're waiting

03:44:53.200 --> 03:44:57.440
for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Member Sun if she has any initial comments

03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:04.240
before me and then we'll see if there are any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

03:45:05.600 --> 03:45:14.080
So, Member Sun. Yes, thank you. I don't have any initial comment other than to reiterate that this

03:45:14.080 --> 03:45:21.200
was a year-long process and as you can see from the presentation, fairly technical, so there may

03:45:21.200 --> 03:45:28.800
be some questions around that. I will have a comment before we take final vote on this item,

03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:35.200
but at this point that's all I have. Thank you. Great. And I'll just add thanks for the care that

03:45:35.200 --> 03:45:43.280
was taken in the process. It was a very careful, well-designed, carefully managed process that

03:45:43.280 --> 03:45:49.840
got us to this point, so we appreciate that. And I understand that in the negotiations here is the

03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:55.280
opportunity for us to be clear about what we really value and what we really need in our

03:45:55.280 --> 03:46:01.520
assessment system, and I will add some comments about that when we get to the discussion part of

03:46:01.520 --> 03:46:07.920
the item. In the meantime, then we'll go ahead and find out if there are any public comments.

03:46:12.560 --> 03:46:16.640
Oh, is there a clarifying question? Yes. Okay, please go ahead, Member Ruck.

03:46:17.440 --> 03:46:21.920
Could you go back to the slide explaining the rankings for the budget?

03:46:24.240 --> 03:46:28.000
And Dr. Darling-Hammond, thank you for your comments because I actually had three questions,

03:46:28.000 --> 03:46:32.880
but your comment answered two of them, so I just want to, I do have a question about the budget

03:46:32.880 --> 03:46:38.400
question. Okay, great. Could you go back to that? Is it possible to go back to that slide?

03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:46.080
Yes. Is that okay for me to go back? Yeah, I think so. People are queuing up. They hopefully

03:46:46.080 --> 03:46:52.080
have written down the phone number. Okay, wonderful. Are you looking at this?

03:46:52.080 --> 03:47:00.080
Yeah, this is what I'm looking at. So in your explanation, the lower the bid, the better it is

03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:10.480
for each of the contractors. So the relative weight of this number, the 28 or the 21,

03:47:11.120 --> 03:47:17.120
is a good thing. Is that correct? That's right because we want the best for our state and we

03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:23.120
want the contractors to be mindful of how much. Okay, and then could you go to the second budget

03:47:23.120 --> 03:47:31.760
slide where you showed us the scores that Pearson and ETS received? So on the budget description,

03:47:32.640 --> 03:47:40.240
keep going. So on the budget description, as you go through these points and you did this rating

03:47:40.240 --> 03:47:46.560
and evaluation for each of the elements in their budget proposal, they got these scores.

03:47:46.560 --> 03:47:57.440
So on these scores, does this mean that on the formal written submission total for their budget,

03:47:58.240 --> 03:48:09.040
that the budget proposal for Pearson was qualitatively higher or lower than the

03:48:09.040 --> 03:48:13.840
proposal for ETS? I want to make sure I understand what that number means.

03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:22.640
Yes, that number means that the higher you get, the lower your costs. So if you look at it,

03:48:22.640 --> 03:48:32.720
so Pearson's budget scoring is lower, but this is, so really the budget scoring is all a calculation

03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:38.800
based on the sample. So as you can see, let's say for example, this test administration one,

03:48:39.520 --> 03:48:46.880
there was a total of 277 points and ETS, since they have the most, they were the low bid on

03:48:46.880 --> 03:48:54.880
that task and then it was rated. But if you could see, let's say for example, the reporting,

03:48:56.160 --> 03:49:03.200
Pearson had the low bid and they had all the points. Right, so yeah. Okay, so yeah,

03:49:03.200 --> 03:49:09.680
I was tracking this. So overall, as it relates to this section of the evaluation,

03:49:09.680 --> 03:49:17.360
overall in each of these areas that you evaluated, Pearson submitted a lower cost projection

03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:22.400
than ETS did. Is that correct? That is correct. Okay, I just wanted to make sure I understood

03:49:22.400 --> 03:49:27.520
that because as I was looking at the sum, the total when you got to the final slide and saw

03:49:27.520 --> 03:49:33.680
what was added up, I wanted to make sure I understood the relative weight or value

03:49:33.680 --> 03:49:37.760
of all three of the items that were added up to the total. Thank you very much for that.

03:49:38.640 --> 03:49:45.440
You're welcome. Thank you for asking. And if we could put the caller phone number card back up

03:49:46.560 --> 03:49:51.120
in case anyone else is trying, I believe there may be a caller in the queue. So

03:49:51.200 --> 03:49:58.320
do we have public comment? Yes, currently we have one person to speak for item number four.

03:49:59.440 --> 03:50:05.760
Callers, just a quick reminder, we don't want to miss anyone. So make sure that you call in promptly.

03:50:06.880 --> 03:50:13.280
Caller, you are the next and the only person in line. Please state your name and affiliation

03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:15.600
for the record. Your time starts now.

03:50:17.840 --> 03:50:23.840
Darlin Hamann and Vice President Strauss, esteemed members of the board and Superintendent Thurmond.

03:50:23.840 --> 03:50:29.920
This is Walt McDonald, President and CEO of ETS, a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to

03:50:29.920 --> 03:50:36.000
advance quality and equity in education for all. I am constantly moved by the passion ETS has for

03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:40.880
supporting learners and educators. It's that passion that has brought me here today to say

03:50:40.880 --> 03:50:46.000
that ETS and our subcontractors are thrilled about the possibility of continuing our serve

03:50:46.000 --> 03:50:51.040
to serve California. ETS has had the privilege of working with California for several years.

03:50:51.600 --> 03:50:55.600
Over that time, we've built strong partnerships with all stakeholders, creating a collaborative

03:50:55.600 --> 03:51:00.800
approach that has allowed the board and the CDE to bring the best solutions for California.

03:51:01.440 --> 03:51:06.720
ETS will fully support California from day one of the new contract, offering the stability and

03:51:06.720 --> 03:51:11.920
quality that is critical. As the state recovers from the pandemic, ETS is committed to creating

03:51:11.920 --> 03:51:16.320
innovations that will continue to improve the validity, reliability, and utility of the

03:51:16.320 --> 03:51:20.960
California assessments. It is our mission. So thank you very, very much.

03:51:22.080 --> 03:51:29.360
Thank you, caller. At this time, there are no more callers in the queue. This concludes public comment.

03:51:29.840 --> 03:51:38.320
Terrific. Thank you. And we're going to launch into discussion questions, substantive questions,

03:51:38.320 --> 03:51:45.120
or comments at this point. And I see member Rucker, your hand is up, I think, for perhaps

03:51:45.120 --> 03:51:51.120
a substantive comment. Yeah, I'll wait on my, I do want to be in the queue, but I will take my,

03:51:51.120 --> 03:51:54.960
I left my hand up so you, because I do want to be in the queue, but I don't want to be the first

03:51:55.360 --> 03:52:01.680
person since I asked some questions. Okay, but we'll see if anybody else raises their hand.

03:52:03.440 --> 03:52:07.920
Are there others who would like to engage in discussion at this point? Remember,

03:52:07.920 --> 03:52:14.880
Son, you had some thoughts you wanted to share. Yeah, so before I move the recommendation,

03:52:14.880 --> 03:52:21.600
I did want to just provide some comments around this next evolution, if you will,

03:52:21.600 --> 03:52:30.880
of California assessment. And I, the public speaker mentioned that providing that continuity,

03:52:30.880 --> 03:52:37.840
but I would also really like to emphasize the innovation portion of what we can do with our

03:52:37.840 --> 03:52:44.160
assessments and how we will evolve these assessments to the next level. We, I think we've

03:52:44.960 --> 03:52:51.440
done an excellent job thus far, and with this initial stage, getting new assessments up,

03:52:52.320 --> 03:53:01.680
but I would like us to be more visionary, if you will, in looking at that, that next stage.

03:53:01.680 --> 03:53:08.320
So in the stage four negotiations, if the board approves the recommendation,

03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:11.600
I would like to emphasize that those conversations occur.

03:53:11.920 --> 03:53:16.720
Thank you. And I'll just plus one to your comment, and then I'll come back to

03:53:17.200 --> 03:53:23.680
member Rucker, and anyone who raises their hand. I think that this is a moment in the country,

03:53:23.680 --> 03:53:28.720
and certainly in California, where there's a lot of interest in ensuring that assessments

03:53:28.720 --> 03:53:35.520
really are supportive of teaching and learning, give information in a timely way, potentially

03:53:35.520 --> 03:53:39.520
even during the school year, not waiting for everything at the end. We've heard a lot of

03:53:40.480 --> 03:53:48.880
comments from our constituents during this last year, desires for increasingly authentic approaches

03:53:48.880 --> 03:53:55.520
to assessments. So it's going to be an era of rethinking assessments that's beginning to be

03:53:55.520 --> 03:54:00.240
part of the national conversation and the conversation in many states. So we do want a

03:54:00.240 --> 03:54:08.480
partner network that is really ready to take on challenges of developing with us what the next

03:54:08.480 --> 03:54:13.920
generation of assessments will be in California. So that will be an important part of our next

03:54:13.920 --> 03:54:22.960
stage. Member Rucker. Thank you. As we were going through the evaluation metrics that were being

03:54:22.960 --> 03:54:30.800
used to evaluate each of the contractors, I was stuck not only by the quality and the depth of

03:54:30.800 --> 03:54:35.760
the metrics that were used in the multiple metrics, but also the types of questions

03:54:36.320 --> 03:54:45.040
that the contractors were asked to address in their proposal. The three areas that really

03:54:45.040 --> 03:54:51.200
came to my attention, and I will hold this, I would ask you to stick a pin in this.

03:54:51.840 --> 03:54:57.120
Each year when we go through the reporting at the beginning of the assessment window,

03:54:57.120 --> 03:55:04.480
I always ask the staff if they would share information about the use or access across the

03:55:04.480 --> 03:55:11.120
state on the accessibility tools or the inquiries that are made. This past year,

03:55:11.120 --> 03:55:17.760
because of the pandemic, obviously we didn't get that information. But the fact of the matter is,

03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:24.960
given what our population of students who are identified who have some type of requirement

03:55:24.960 --> 03:55:31.600
for accessibility or additional assessment support, what has been reported to this panel

03:55:31.600 --> 03:55:39.440
about accessibility tools really shows that there is a far lower use and access of those tools

03:55:39.440 --> 03:55:45.760
by students across the state than it should be. So one of the things I would really like to see

03:55:45.760 --> 03:55:52.880
addressed as part of the contract would be, and it could be that it's under reported or that

03:55:52.880 --> 03:55:58.800
districts don't monitor it well enough to make the report, or the data is just simply not collected

03:55:58.800 --> 03:56:05.280
in a way that we can assure we're getting the timely and accurate report. So I would like some

03:56:05.280 --> 03:56:11.760
attention paid to accessibility tools and how they are used, and I would really like to make sure that

03:56:11.760 --> 03:56:18.800
we receive information about the use of those tools, not only because we have African American

03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:24.080
students who are over identified to receive special education services, but then I want to know

03:56:24.160 --> 03:56:29.120
if those students are receiving those accessibility supports in the assessment system as well.

03:56:29.760 --> 03:56:35.600
The second thing I want to do that I think is important, and this was more as a result of what

03:56:35.600 --> 03:56:40.080
California did in choosing the assessment instruments they've used, but I think it's

03:56:40.080 --> 03:56:47.280
important to pose questions about what we want the assessment to tell us. Right now when we get the

03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:53.280
assessment data back about students, for example, in English language arts, we are posing four

03:56:53.280 --> 03:56:58.880
questions. How well do students understand stories and information that they read? How well do

03:56:58.880 --> 03:57:05.520
students communicate in writing? How well do students understand spoken information? I think

03:57:05.520 --> 03:57:12.160
it's important in looking at what we're at, what we are asking the assessment to do for us, that we

03:57:12.160 --> 03:57:18.720
start with the question, what are we asking the assessments to tell us? So have we moved far enough

03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:25.680
along in the assessment discussion and are we sophisticated enough to pose questions that will

03:57:25.680 --> 03:57:32.720
tell us more? I'm not sure if the contractor is ready to do that work, but they have certainly

03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:39.680
been doing a lot of work in California and they know we ask those questions. So I would like that

03:57:39.680 --> 03:57:47.120
even if they can't deliver on that as part of this contract right now, I would like that conversation

03:57:47.120 --> 03:57:59.280
to start. Thank you. Are there other comments, questions, further discussion before we make a

03:57:59.280 --> 03:58:14.880
motion? All right, we may be ready for a motion. Okay, I'll go ahead and move CDE's request to

03:58:14.880 --> 03:58:20.560
begin negotiations with ETS for the California assessment system contract to cover five

03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:29.840
administrations of the CASP and the LPAC beginning July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2027. Terrific,

03:58:29.840 --> 03:58:38.960
do I have a second? I will second. Thank you. Is there any further discussion?

03:58:38.960 --> 03:58:43.920
We will hold a roll call vote. Brooks, please call the roll.

03:58:45.120 --> 03:58:48.000
President Darling-Hammond. Yes.

03:58:48.800 --> 03:58:51.040
Number Fatah. Yes.

03:58:51.920 --> 03:58:54.720
Number Glover-Wood. Yes.

03:58:55.600 --> 03:58:58.560
Number McQuillan. Yes.

03:58:59.360 --> 03:59:02.160
Number Petillo-Brownson. Yes.

03:59:02.880 --> 03:59:05.280
Number Rodriguez. Yes.

03:59:06.000 --> 03:59:07.920
Number Rucker. Yes.

03:59:08.640 --> 03:59:10.960
Vice President Strauss. Yes.

03:59:11.680 --> 03:59:14.480
Number Sung. Aye.

03:59:15.440 --> 03:59:22.000
Motion passes unanimously. All right, well, you've earned a 10-minute break, so

03:59:23.600 --> 03:59:30.240
we're going to turn off our cameras and our microphones for 10 minutes and we'll see you

03:59:30.240 --> 03:59:42.240
back at about 1.40. Okay, welcome back. We have a quorum, so Brooks, will you please call the roll?

03:59:43.920 --> 03:59:46.560
Yes. President Darling-Hammond. Here.

03:59:47.120 --> 03:59:49.040
Number Fatah. Here.

03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:52.000
Number Glover-Wood. Here.

03:59:52.560 --> 03:59:54.720
Number McQuillan. Here.

03:59:55.440 --> 03:59:58.160
Number Petillo-Brownson. Here.

03:59:58.800 --> 03:59:59.680
Member Rodriguez.

04:00:03.840 --> 04:00:05.840
Member Rucker. Here.

04:00:06.400 --> 04:00:08.320
Member Strauss. Vice President Strauss.

04:00:11.920 --> 04:00:14.320
Thank you, and Member Sung. Here.

04:00:15.600 --> 04:00:17.920
We have a quorum. All right.

04:00:21.680 --> 04:00:27.200
Item five is next on the agenda. It is the School Accountability Report card.

04:00:28.160 --> 04:00:34.400
Approval of the template for the 2020-2021 School Accountability Report card. The CDE

04:00:34.400 --> 04:00:40.320
recommends that the State Board approve the SARC template for the 2020-21 school year,

04:00:40.320 --> 04:00:46.160
and the item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis of the department. Hey, Cindy, where are you?

04:00:48.480 --> 04:00:49.360
Good afternoon.

04:00:49.920 --> 04:00:50.560
Wherever you are.

04:00:52.800 --> 04:00:53.040
Yeah.

04:00:53.840 --> 04:00:57.520
All right. Excellent. Cindy Kazanis, the director of the Analysis,

04:00:57.520 --> 04:01:01.200
Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division. It's very nice to be with you.

04:01:01.840 --> 04:01:07.280
This item for the template for the School Accountability Report card is typically on

04:01:07.280 --> 04:01:14.000
consent, and so I'm very happy today to share some slides with you to talk about its purpose

04:01:14.000 --> 04:01:19.440
and some things that are new for this year. Some will be only for this year, and others will be

04:01:20.160 --> 04:01:27.200
for perpetuity. So as President Darling-Hammond just indicated, our recommendation is that you

04:01:27.200 --> 04:01:32.240
approve the School Accountability Report card template for the 2021 school year.

04:01:34.400 --> 04:01:37.040
This is a couple of things we'll be covering during the presentation.

04:01:37.840 --> 04:01:42.800
Specifically, the School Accountability Report card is very unusual in that it is

04:01:42.800 --> 04:01:50.400
a requirement that was under Proposition 98, which of course was passed over 30 years ago,

04:01:50.400 --> 04:01:55.280
and because it's a requirement under Proposition 98, in order to make changes to it, there are

04:01:55.280 --> 04:02:00.000
different vote thresholds in the legislature. So many of the things that you're going to see

04:02:00.000 --> 04:02:05.040
today come from not only the state requirements, but also education code requirements, which are

04:02:05.040 --> 04:02:10.880
mostly articulated in Education Code sections 33126 and 33126.1.

04:02:12.240 --> 04:02:18.640
The SARC is also the way that the state complies with the report card requirements under the Every

04:02:18.640 --> 04:02:23.280
Student Succeeds Act. I think that there sometimes is a misconception out there that the California

04:02:23.280 --> 04:02:29.760
school dashboard meets this purpose, and it does not. There are very specific things you have to

04:02:29.760 --> 04:02:35.040
put in your report card, which don't tend to be user-friendly, and so we still depend on the

04:02:35.040 --> 04:02:41.920
School Accountability Report card to meet those requirements. I wanted to spend a minute or two

04:02:41.920 --> 04:02:47.200
talking about our alignment with the Local Control Funding Formula. As I mentioned, because this is

04:02:47.760 --> 04:02:53.440
a requirement under Proposition 98, there are things that we can change and make suggestions

04:02:53.440 --> 04:02:58.560
to you all to change to the template, but there are others that would require an act of the

04:02:58.560 --> 04:03:07.760
legislature. So in order to do what was under our control for the SARC, immediately following

04:03:07.760 --> 04:03:14.400
the passage of the Local Control Funding Formula, taking you back to 2013-2014, the California

04:03:14.400 --> 04:03:20.320
Department of Education reorganized the SARC. We put tables that were aligned with LCFF metrics

04:03:20.320 --> 04:03:27.360
at the beginning and the non-LCFF tables at the end. These tables are also organized into sections

04:03:27.360 --> 04:03:31.360
that align with the state priorities. So if you were to look for Priority 1, you would see,

04:03:31.360 --> 04:03:37.200
you're going to see today that our teacher tables are up front as well as facilities and such

04:03:38.080 --> 04:03:44.720
like that. We wanted to make sure that we could do whatever was under our power to align the template

04:03:44.720 --> 04:03:50.720
and make it user-friendly for our local educational agencies to also leverage for the completion of

04:03:50.720 --> 04:03:55.760
the Local Control and Accountability Plan. Now keep in mind that the Local Control and Accountability

04:03:55.760 --> 04:04:01.920
Plan is a district plan and the SARC is a school plan, so they don't automatically align just by

04:04:01.920 --> 04:04:09.040
virtue of what they're designed for. I wanted to mention that back in 2016, under President

04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:16.160
Chris' leadership, he helped to get grant funding to the department to undertake what we called

04:04:16.160 --> 04:04:24.160
the Underbrush Project. And really that was led by Marsha Bedwell, who used to be our

04:04:24.800 --> 04:04:31.760
General Counsel, and she put together this amazing document literally five years ago that talked

04:04:31.760 --> 04:04:39.200
about a cross-border between where LCFF and things like the SARC and other pieces could be aligned

04:04:39.200 --> 04:04:45.120
moving forward. The department used that as a template to sponsor legislation in 2018,

04:04:45.120 --> 04:04:53.600
AB 3096, which was unsuccessful, to again further align these two documents and reduce the burden

04:04:53.600 --> 04:05:00.720
to the field. So we are enlightened to see letters that say that there is support for this moving

04:05:00.720 --> 04:05:05.840
forward and just wanted to mention that the department has done what we can within the

04:05:05.840 --> 04:05:14.560
constraints that are the SARC template. So first I'm going to go over just a couple of brief things

04:05:14.560 --> 04:05:20.240
that are updates to existing tables. We know that the SARC is also used as a comparison

04:05:21.040 --> 04:05:27.120
for our data reporting across states. And so two things that were some easy wins for us that we

04:05:27.120 --> 04:05:32.400
thought would be very relevant is to start including student groups where it was appropriate

04:05:32.400 --> 04:05:38.880
for tables. And so we've added for the graduation rate table and the expulsion and suspension table

04:05:38.880 --> 04:05:43.120
student group information. And of course that's not just limited to our race and ethnic groups,

04:05:43.120 --> 04:05:48.800
but also the expansive student groups that we collect, such as homeless, foster youth,

04:05:49.440 --> 04:05:57.520
English learners, and so on. Additionally, as a condition of the waiver for accountability

04:05:57.520 --> 04:06:01.200
from the U.S. Department of Education, the department is required to report out on

04:06:01.200 --> 04:06:06.560
chronic absenteeism. So we are adding these as new tables and you're seeing this information by

04:06:06.560 --> 04:06:15.040
student group as well. And then on to the meat of the presentation. We have spent the last year,

04:06:15.040 --> 04:06:22.960
year and a half working on this new set of data. Of course, you as a board adopted new definitions

04:06:23.840 --> 04:06:29.360
for our teacher requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act. And up until this year,

04:06:29.360 --> 04:06:34.400
we have not been able to report out on it because we didn't have the full set of data. And we are

04:06:34.400 --> 04:06:40.080
currently still working on that data to produce it publicly this year for the first time. So for the

04:06:40.080 --> 04:06:44.480
last several years, you've always seen teacher credentials and teacher misassignment and vacant

04:06:44.480 --> 04:06:51.280
teacher positions. This coming year, we are suggesting the addition of four tables. And

04:06:51.280 --> 04:06:58.320
the tables would include just a summary information for table six for teacher preparation and placement

04:06:58.320 --> 04:07:03.120
for table seven, teachers without credentials and misassignments. So we're breaking down table six

04:07:03.120 --> 04:07:08.800
and table seven and table eight. Of course, table eight is around our student, our teachers who are

04:07:08.800 --> 04:07:12.880
assigned but are out of field. And again, that's the definition that you all adopted back in

04:07:12.880 --> 04:07:20.800
November of 2019. And then finally, information around class assignments. We worked very closely

04:07:20.800 --> 04:07:27.840
with state board staff, very appreciative of everybody that was involved, including program

04:07:27.840 --> 04:07:33.520
staff. Of course, Barbara Murchison has since retired, but we do have somebody here to answer

04:07:33.520 --> 04:07:39.680
programmatic questions if needed, as well as an entire team around supporting this work,

04:07:39.680 --> 04:07:43.440
which again, we've spent quite a bit of time on. We're really excited to be able to release it for

04:07:43.440 --> 04:07:49.600
the first time this coming year. I would also state that we've heard really clearly, we heard

04:07:49.600 --> 04:07:54.480
at the last board meeting an interest in looking at the local assignment option, and we're working

04:07:54.480 --> 04:08:00.640
internally and with state board staff to see if we can make some updates to our definitions,

04:08:01.280 --> 04:08:08.240
potentially for the September board meeting. So in terms of the new tables around

04:08:09.040 --> 04:08:15.200
assessments, and I know that you all spent a lot of time this year talking about assessments

04:08:15.200 --> 04:08:19.280
and how to meet federal reporting requirements. Well, this is the mechanism in which you actually

04:08:19.280 --> 04:08:26.960
report out on that work. So we are suggesting for this year only adding two tables, table 17

04:08:26.960 --> 04:08:33.600
and table 18. And these tables are limited to districts and school sites where the California,

04:08:34.560 --> 04:08:39.920
the CASP assessment was not able to be administered, and so local assessment was

04:08:39.920 --> 04:08:46.640
administered in its place. And so under, again, the waiver that the department received and

04:08:46.640 --> 04:08:52.240
the work that we've continued to do on your local assessments or rather around assessments,

04:08:52.240 --> 04:08:57.520
we do have to report out on assessment data. And so the state is not able to collect this data, but

04:08:58.240 --> 04:09:01.760
at the school level, you will see this information reported out by each school

04:09:02.640 --> 04:09:08.160
that administered the local assessments. So these are the two tables that allow for that to occur.

04:09:11.360 --> 04:09:18.880
So specifically for this year only, we've added a if-then statement, it goes back to my days of

04:09:18.880 --> 04:09:25.520
being in logic class at university. So if the statewide summative assessment and the ELA

04:09:25.520 --> 04:09:30.480
mathematics were not a viable option, then LEAs were allowed to use a different local assessment

04:09:30.480 --> 04:09:36.160
under, again, the direction that the State Board of Education provided districts. They must meet

04:09:36.160 --> 04:09:42.160
the criteria around these pieces that they are aligned with the Common Core State Standards for

04:09:42.160 --> 04:09:45.840
English Language Arts and Mathematics. They had to be available to grades three through eight and

04:09:45.840 --> 04:09:52.320
eleven, and they needed to be uniformly administered across the grade, grade span, or school. And so

04:09:52.320 --> 04:09:57.920
what you see in the tables, and it's a little hard to tell because this is a Word document,

04:09:57.920 --> 04:10:01.760
and districts will be reporting out on this potentially through an electronic system,

04:10:02.320 --> 04:10:07.520
is these tables are expandable. So if you had a school that had one assessment in grade three

04:10:07.520 --> 04:10:12.080
and a different assessment in grades four and five, they can complete those tables individually

04:10:12.080 --> 04:10:20.240
for those grade spans. So for the science assessments, it was of course administered

04:10:20.240 --> 04:10:26.720
by local educational agencies this year, and if it was not viable to make that assessment,

04:10:26.720 --> 04:10:33.280
there were no other options available. And so for schools that did administer the CAST,

04:10:33.280 --> 04:10:39.600
we will pre-populate that information for districts in schools that decide to use the pre-populated

04:10:39.600 --> 04:10:50.160
templates. And then a piece that is not referenced in our write-up that we later found out after

04:10:50.160 --> 04:10:56.000
the agenda item has posted was that there is a requirement that was put in place through

04:10:56.000 --> 04:11:01.520
non-regulatory guidance from the U.S. Department of Education in September of 2019 that requires

04:11:01.520 --> 04:11:07.440
the reporting of assessment data disaggregated by Militarily Connected Student Group. And this

04:11:07.440 --> 04:11:13.760
actually came from Member Rucker, so I just wanted to acknowledge that she had reminded us that this

04:11:13.760 --> 04:11:18.000
was a requirement that we weren't able to of course comply with last year because we didn't

04:11:18.000 --> 04:11:24.720
have assessments to report out on. But for this year, for the SARC, we are suggesting that the

04:11:24.720 --> 04:11:30.720
tables be amended to add this information. And just to make sure we're all on the same page,

04:11:30.720 --> 04:11:34.240
what that means and how we're collecting it through CALPADS, which of course is our student

04:11:34.240 --> 04:11:41.360
mobile data system, it means that a student has at least one parent who's an Armed Forces member

04:11:41.360 --> 04:11:45.760
on active duty or serves on full-time National Guard duty.

04:11:48.720 --> 04:11:52.720
So with that, I'm happy to turn it over to President Lyndon Arlene Hammond.

04:11:55.280 --> 04:12:04.960
All right. Let me see if I'm on mute. So we want to get queued up for public comment on this item.

04:12:04.960 --> 04:12:12.000
And the phone number is in front of us with the participant access code. Members of the public

04:12:12.000 --> 04:12:16.880
wishing to provide comment on this item can do so by calling that phone number and using the code.

04:12:16.880 --> 04:12:21.920
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Vice President Strauss

04:12:22.320 --> 04:12:30.880
as Accountability Liaison if she has any initial comments. And then there are clarifying comments.

04:12:31.440 --> 04:12:35.840
We will take those from the board before we turn to public comment.

04:12:36.960 --> 04:12:44.720
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. So first, Cindy, I just want to thank you for the explanation

04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:50.320
and the history that you started the presentation with. I think people don't realize that we're

04:12:50.400 --> 04:12:56.480
sometimes tied to existing legislation. It's amazing it's 30 years old, because many of us

04:12:56.480 --> 04:13:00.720
remember when that all was implemented. So I just want to thank you for that explanation.

04:13:01.360 --> 04:13:08.160
I appreciate the continued effort by the CDE team to align with LCFF so that the whole system

04:13:08.160 --> 04:13:15.280
is aligned and appreciate the continued look at the underbrush project to try to deal with

04:13:15.280 --> 04:13:22.320
try to deal with things that are not as focused on our priorities. And so I just appreciate and

04:13:22.320 --> 04:13:28.880
reinforce the effort to continue that work. I appreciate, too, the extra the new tables that

04:13:28.880 --> 04:13:36.080
are going to be included. I know districts are looking at how they use their local assessment

04:13:36.080 --> 04:13:41.040
and how they report it back. I know I've had several questions from local districts on

04:13:41.040 --> 04:13:44.720
those that did local assessments. I appreciate your explanation on that.

04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:49.920
And adding the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate by subgroup and the

04:13:49.920 --> 04:13:55.440
chronic absenteeism by subgroup, I think, is quite helpful to the work that we are tracking

04:13:56.000 --> 04:14:03.440
with our data. And I am looking forward to the continued work on the teacher credentialing

04:14:03.440 --> 04:14:10.080
and misassignment issue. I know that's been very complicated when people have enough units

04:14:10.080 --> 04:14:17.600
and get local approval and then are considered misassigned. So I appreciate the continued work

04:14:17.600 --> 04:14:22.080
that the department's doing to try to clarify that. And I understand that will be coming back.

04:14:22.080 --> 04:14:28.000
So initially, I just appreciate the continued work to get this aligned and the guidance that

04:14:28.000 --> 04:14:33.120
the districts will need to complete this part of the SARC with their local reporting data

04:14:33.120 --> 04:14:36.000
based on assessment from the spring. Thank you very much.

04:14:36.000 --> 04:14:45.360
And I want to just record my enthusiasm for the teacher data joining the SARC in the ways

04:14:45.360 --> 04:14:50.160
that it will. As a clarifying question, I know we're going to come back to this in September.

04:14:51.040 --> 04:14:56.880
But Cindy, I wonder if you would like to just explain the ways in which you're trying to tease

04:14:56.880 --> 04:15:05.840
out the local assignment option. Sure. So we, of course, with this data set,

04:15:05.840 --> 04:15:12.320
I should start with this is a data set that we don't own ourselves. We have to, and we are

04:15:12.320 --> 04:15:16.160
required to work with our sister agency, which is the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.

04:15:16.880 --> 04:15:23.280
There was a data system planned over 10 years ago called Cal Tides that would have automated

04:15:23.280 --> 04:15:28.720
this process. And the former governor returned the funding to the federal government for that

04:15:28.720 --> 04:15:34.960
project. So we are in a state of manually transmitting data to the Commission on Teacher

04:15:34.960 --> 04:15:40.320
Credentialing once it's been collected from our student level data system. And the Commission on

04:15:40.320 --> 04:15:46.800
Teacher Credentialing this past year stood up a new tool to help with miss assignments called

04:15:46.800 --> 04:15:53.440
CalSAS. And with that tool, they are now giving us back information that we've never seen before.

04:15:53.440 --> 04:16:03.200
It's the detail in which for local assignment options, we are seeing courses that are also

04:16:03.200 --> 04:16:11.440
provided with the appropriate education code section. And so I think we've gone through five

04:16:11.440 --> 04:16:16.480
or six iterations of this data set. I think the six just came in last week. And so we are looking

04:16:17.040 --> 04:16:22.720
at the data. And I think it's important to note that we are together jointly working on definitions

04:16:22.720 --> 04:16:28.640
and business rules. And so some of these things you can work on ahead of time, but others you

04:16:28.640 --> 04:16:32.640
can't really work with until you actually have the data in your hands. And so we are

04:16:33.520 --> 04:16:38.640
going through an iterative process where we're trying to tease out credentials in which there

04:16:38.640 --> 04:16:45.200
may not be, rather courses in which there may not be a credential available to staff to become

04:16:45.200 --> 04:16:50.240
qualified for. And so that is an angle that we are looking at right now, again, with guidance

04:16:50.240 --> 04:16:56.160
and leadership with the State Board of Education staff. Terrific. Thank you. Appreciate that.

04:16:57.440 --> 04:17:02.560
Are there any other clarifying questions? I see Member Glover-Woods' hand up.

04:17:04.560 --> 04:17:10.560
Thank you. First, just wanted to reiterate all of the appreciation. The SARC is one of, again,

04:17:10.560 --> 04:17:15.040
continuous improvement. It just keeps getting better and better. And I'm quite excited about

04:17:15.040 --> 04:17:19.520
the tables. I did have a clarifying question, so I want to be sure that I'm reading things correctly.

04:17:20.080 --> 04:17:27.280
For tables 17 and 18, which are the tables for the local assessment test results,

04:17:28.560 --> 04:17:36.640
the acronym that's in the box is DPC. And on page three of attachment one, it says DPC is

04:17:37.520 --> 04:17:47.360
data provided by CDE. Is that accurate, or is that data that's going to be provided by the LEA

04:17:48.080 --> 04:17:57.600
and would then not be DPC, but maybe DPL? I'm sorry to throw that at you, Cindy. I'm sorry.

04:17:57.600 --> 04:18:03.600
I just wanted to be sure that I'm not assuming or misinterpreting where that data is going

04:18:03.600 --> 04:18:08.560
to be provided. Member Glover-Woods, you are the only person that has recognized that,

04:18:08.560 --> 04:18:13.520
or at least told us that you recognize also. Kudos to you. We missed that. That is a typo.

04:18:14.080 --> 04:18:18.560
Those data will, of course, be provided by local educational agencies. The department

04:18:18.560 --> 04:18:23.840
has no access to local assessment data. My apologies, and thank you for making us aware

04:18:23.840 --> 04:18:29.840
of that typo. No apologies needed at all. I just wanted to be sure. That was my assumption,

04:18:29.840 --> 04:18:32.880
but you know what they always say about assuming, so I just wanted to clarify,

04:18:32.880 --> 04:18:37.920
so thank you very much. Very good. And seeing no other hands up,

04:18:37.920 --> 04:18:41.440
I'm going to see if we have people waiting for a public comment.

04:18:42.400 --> 04:18:50.320
Yes, currently we have seven speakers for item five. Just a quick reminder, callers,

04:18:50.320 --> 04:18:54.400
if you would like to speak to this item, please go ahead and call and get in the queue.

04:18:55.200 --> 04:19:00.240
We want to make sure that we don't miss your call. Caller, first caller,

04:19:00.240 --> 04:19:04.720
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:19:06.800 --> 04:19:10.640
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and State Board members. Diana Wu, representing

04:19:10.640 --> 04:19:14.160
the Association of California School Administrators, acts to appreciate the

04:19:14.160 --> 04:19:18.720
State Board's and CD's proactive approach to removing certain courses that do not include

04:19:18.720 --> 04:19:22.640
associated teaching credentials, such as AVID, student government, and leadership from local

04:19:22.640 --> 04:19:27.440
assignment options. Furthermore, under ESSA out-of-field educators who teach students

04:19:28.160 --> 04:19:32.480
for four or more consecutive weeks to trigger a four-week letter notification to parents,

04:19:32.480 --> 04:19:38.080
acts to request CDE work with LEAs to develop a robust communication plan to help LEAs communicate

04:19:38.080 --> 04:19:43.520
this information clearly and effectively to parents. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next

04:19:43.520 --> 04:19:47.920
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:19:47.920 --> 04:19:56.160
SBE members, my name is Sheila Whitley and I am a classroom teacher representing the California

04:19:56.160 --> 04:20:03.760
Teachers Association. CTA appreciates the CDE's effort to update the SARC template for the 2021

04:20:03.760 --> 04:20:08.880
school year and understand the need for the updated SARC tables dealing with State Priority

04:20:08.880 --> 04:20:14.240
1 and the degrees which teachers are appropriately assigned and fully credentialed in the subject

04:20:14.240 --> 04:20:19.840
area for the pupils they are teaching. We also appreciate the stakeholder engagement conducted by

04:20:19.840 --> 04:20:26.720
CDE and SBE staff. We believe that no teacher should be assigned to teach outside their

04:20:26.720 --> 04:20:34.400
credential authorization and CTA should take any and all actions to protect misassigned teachers

04:20:34.400 --> 04:20:41.040
from being accountable for such misassignment. In closing, CTA looks forward to being a continuing

04:20:41.040 --> 04:20:48.240
partner with the CDE and SBE on any efforts to utilize data from the CDC to highlight Priority

04:20:48.240 --> 04:20:55.200
1 and specifically around future misassignments. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state

04:20:55.200 --> 04:21:03.200
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Good afternoon, Jessica Sacco

04:21:03.200 --> 04:21:08.240
on behalf of Children Now. I'd like to start off by thanking the department for their incredible

04:21:08.240 --> 04:21:12.800
effort and hard work that went into this year's revisions as well as the redesign of the SARC

04:21:12.800 --> 04:21:18.080
application and thank them for their work on stakeholder engagement, particularly around

04:21:18.640 --> 04:21:25.840
the teacher data tables that were included in this year's SARC. We're very excited to see them

04:21:25.840 --> 04:21:31.680
included. However, we would, I do have a few modifications that I would recommend including

04:21:31.680 --> 04:21:36.080
displaying teacher data and assignment in percentages in order to allow for more

04:21:36.640 --> 04:21:43.840
easy comparability as well as percentage information for district and statewide data

04:21:43.840 --> 04:21:51.600
so that comparisons can be made and more useful, followed by teasing out the data by student

04:21:51.600 --> 04:21:56.560
subgroup in order to facilitate and identify and correct any disparities that may exist.

04:21:57.200 --> 04:22:05.360
Relative to tables 14, 17, and 18, I would ask that table 14 actually include data from the 2018-19

04:22:05.360 --> 04:22:13.760
administration of the CASP as well as the state. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

04:22:13.760 --> 04:22:21.520
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Hello, my name is Micah Studer. I am the chair

04:22:21.520 --> 04:22:25.600
elect for the Student Programs and Services Steering Committee for the California County

04:22:25.600 --> 04:22:31.760
Superintendent's Educational Association. I'm calling to express concern about local assignment

04:22:31.760 --> 04:22:38.000
option deeming our alternative education teachers as out of field. Specifically, Ed Code 4045

04:22:38.000 --> 04:22:44.640
provides for our teachers to be assigned to teach multiple subjects so that we can appropriately

04:22:44.640 --> 04:22:49.280
staff and provide education for our most out-of-promise youth. We would appreciate CDEs and

04:22:49.280 --> 04:22:54.240
the board's reconsideration of this classification for our students, especially as publishing this

04:22:54.240 --> 04:22:59.520
information publicly may lead to some unfortunate ramifications in terms of staffing and our ability

04:22:59.520 --> 04:23:04.000
to recruit and retain highly qualified educators for our most out-of-promise youth. Thank you.

04:23:04.800 --> 04:23:10.800
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:23:14.160 --> 04:23:20.160
Hello, this is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates. I join my colleague Jessica Salka from Children

04:23:20.160 --> 04:23:26.720
Now on her comments around the hard work that went into the Sark revision, thanking the department

04:23:26.720 --> 04:23:34.880
and staff for that, as well as the hard work on the teacher data tables, the teacher info tables,

04:23:34.880 --> 04:23:40.240
yes. We come from the perspective of civil rights advocates, so we're concerned about

04:23:40.240 --> 04:23:46.240
equities for high-need students and transparency to parents and the public, and that's in service

04:23:46.240 --> 04:23:52.640
of sound policy and practice decisions so that every student has a fully prepared and properly

04:23:52.640 --> 04:23:59.520
assigned teacher. And because of that, we want to underscore the suggestions that Jessica made

04:23:59.520 --> 04:24:05.360
around displaying the teacher authorization and assignment data and percentages so that this

04:24:05.360 --> 04:24:10.640
information can be comparable. We also had suggestions about adding more information

04:24:11.200 --> 04:24:18.240
through a couple more columns for district-wide and statewide data and collection and display of

04:24:19.040 --> 04:24:22.720
this data by student subgroup. Thank you, caller. Your time's up.

04:24:23.760 --> 04:24:28.640
All right. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

04:24:28.640 --> 04:24:37.680
record. Your time starts now. Hello, Madam President. This is Brian Revis calling on behalf of

04:24:37.680 --> 04:24:43.840
the Education Trust West. I wanted to say that we agree with our equity partners, Ms. Salko and

04:24:43.840 --> 04:24:51.440
Ms. Guillen, from Children Now and public advocates around modifications to the tables

04:24:51.440 --> 04:24:57.280
regarding teacher data and transparency and assessment results. Please take a look at our

04:24:57.280 --> 04:25:05.280
letter of July 9th, our coalition letter, and I want to say on table 14, if I understand correctly,

04:25:06.000 --> 04:25:14.320
because of problems with comparability, most LEAs will fill in the table with

04:25:15.040 --> 04:25:21.840
NA and provide no results, and I think we would much rather see data presented

04:25:21.840 --> 04:25:27.200
that may be imperfect, and we think that there's a way to do it to provide adequate explanation

04:25:27.200 --> 04:25:33.200
around why they may not be comparable, but we're concerned about flying blind here during the

04:25:33.200 --> 04:25:39.440
pandemic, and we'd like to see the public have as much information or at least some information.

04:25:39.440 --> 04:25:41.680
Your time's up. Thank you. Thank you.

04:25:44.080 --> 04:25:47.200
Last caller, last call for speakers for this item.

04:25:48.640 --> 04:25:52.720
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:25:55.920 --> 04:26:00.320
Good afternoon. This is Bill Lucille with Ed Voice. Ed Voice supports the addition of tables

04:26:00.320 --> 04:26:05.200
six to nine in the SARK as a first step for including more transparent teacher quality

04:26:05.200 --> 04:26:10.000
at the site level. We also recommend further disaggregation of teacher assignment data by

04:26:10.000 --> 04:26:14.880
subgroup and percentages whenever possible and appropriate. Ed Voice would also like to see

04:26:14.880 --> 04:26:19.520
improvements in the assessment reporting, specifically table 14 of the proposed template

04:26:19.520 --> 04:26:24.080
compares CAS results from the last two years. However, the proposed example incorrectly suggests

04:26:24.080 --> 04:26:28.880
data is not available, thereby providing no information on potential learning loss to parents,

04:26:28.880 --> 04:26:33.120
community members, and other stakeholders. Districts administered the CASB and other

04:26:33.120 --> 04:26:37.040
standards aligned assessments this spring, and they have data for several years on how students

04:26:37.040 --> 04:26:41.440
and subgroups were formed. We urge the board to direct available standards aligned assessments

04:26:41.440 --> 04:26:46.880
data from 18 to 19 through 2021 to be included to better understand learning loss experienced

04:26:46.880 --> 04:26:53.360
at a school. Thank you. Thank you, caller. This concludes public comment for item five.

04:26:53.360 --> 04:27:06.400
Thank you very much. At this point, if we have comments or questions as part of board discussion,

04:27:06.400 --> 04:27:14.400
we can launch that process. I see member Rucker. Anyone else? Please raise your hand. Member

04:27:14.400 --> 04:27:20.880
Rucker, get us going. Thank you very much. I want to begin, Cindy, by thanking you for this work.

04:27:21.840 --> 04:27:29.440
This is an example of the really important role that stakeholder engagement has taken. We have

04:27:29.440 --> 04:27:36.880
been working on writing this definition and figuring out how to present the data about this

04:27:36.880 --> 04:27:45.280
definition in a comprehensible way ever since ESSA was signed into law by President Obama and that

04:27:45.280 --> 04:27:51.040
federal mandate came into existence. So I'm actually very proud that we've gotten to this

04:27:51.040 --> 04:27:57.440
point, even if it's taken multiple years, because it's very important not only to refine this

04:27:57.440 --> 04:28:04.320
definition, but to understand that once we start posting this data, which is simply a number,

04:28:04.880 --> 04:28:12.080
not an interpretation, and not a narrative explanation about ineffective or effective teaching,

04:28:12.080 --> 04:28:17.440
that it's going to be subject to a lot of interpretation. So with that, I want to thank

04:28:17.440 --> 04:28:25.280
all of the stakeholders who called in to add their suggestions about ways to continue to refine

04:28:25.280 --> 04:28:31.280
and add granularity to what is being reported in the school accountability report card.

04:28:31.840 --> 04:28:37.120
My favorite one line about the accountability report card is there's thousands of pieces of

04:28:37.120 --> 04:28:42.000
information we would like to see, but at the same time, we'd like it to fit on one page and be

04:28:42.000 --> 04:28:49.280
easy to read. So it's important for us to look at what it is we actually use the school accountability

04:28:49.280 --> 04:28:57.200
report card for, but also what is the exact state and legislative mandate that requires the work

04:28:57.920 --> 04:29:04.800
for what is reported in the school accountability report card. While it would be nice to create

04:29:04.800 --> 04:29:13.040
ways to compare statewide or school-wide data about teachers from school to school or from

04:29:13.040 --> 04:29:19.440
district to district, that's not something required in the mandate. And so if this is something we

04:29:19.440 --> 04:29:25.600
want to explore, the human capital, both at the district level and the state level, should be

04:29:25.600 --> 04:29:30.480
considered. It doesn't mean the ideas or the suggestions are not worthwhile, and I appreciate

04:29:30.480 --> 04:29:36.640
the stakeholders for making that suggestion, but that's going to take more time, and I think it's

04:29:36.640 --> 04:29:44.080
a worthwhile pursuit to consider as well as the time worth looking into. I also think it's important

04:29:44.080 --> 04:29:50.640
for us to start thinking about with this new level of granularity and this new definition,

04:29:50.640 --> 04:29:58.080
what are we getting from these reports that are going to inform decisions districts make.

04:29:58.080 --> 04:30:01.680
Let me be clear, especially as it relates to the local option

04:30:01.680 --> 04:30:06.560
comment that came from one stakeholder, and he really did make an important point.

04:30:07.760 --> 04:30:12.960
There's a lot of terms of art that swirl around about teacher credentialing, and one of them

04:30:12.960 --> 04:30:18.560
is multiple subject credentials. Multiple subject credentials have nothing to do with a grade or

04:30:18.560 --> 04:30:25.520
age span, but the way a particular teaching assignment looks, and so it might be worthwhile

04:30:25.520 --> 04:30:31.360
for the department to take a look at exactly what's being reported concerning alternative

04:30:31.360 --> 04:30:37.520
education teachers. If their alternative education program is a single group of students in a

04:30:37.520 --> 04:30:44.000
self-contained but alternative setting, there's nothing wrong with a multiple subject credential

04:30:44.000 --> 04:30:50.400
holder teaching that program, and they would meet the requirement of being an effective teacher based

04:30:50.400 --> 04:30:56.480
on the way that assignment looks. So I think we have to take another look, a more granular look,

04:30:56.480 --> 04:31:02.160
at some of those certifications, not just the name of the certification, but what the authorization

04:31:02.160 --> 04:31:08.800
actually means, so that we can make sure in examples like what we're given concerning the

04:31:08.800 --> 04:31:14.480
alternative education programs, we're actually representing what that teacher's assignment

04:31:14.480 --> 04:31:21.040
looks like, and not just the certification. But I'm so proud, Cindy, to see this work done,

04:31:21.040 --> 04:31:24.000
to see this work progress, and thank you so very much.

04:31:27.680 --> 04:31:35.280
I don't see other hands raised, so I'm going to take the prerogative of the chair to dive in on

04:31:36.080 --> 04:31:42.640
my favorite table. Cindy, you'll probably guess what it is. Table six, followed by seven and eight.

04:31:42.640 --> 04:31:48.320
I'm so excited to see those, and I want to go into my document here to ask a question.

04:31:50.320 --> 04:31:57.280
So my understanding of table six is that when you add up the lines there,

04:31:58.160 --> 04:32:04.160
fully credentialed intern without credentials and misassignments assigned out of field,

04:32:04.160 --> 04:32:08.240
and unknown, you would end up with 100%. Is that correct?

04:32:13.120 --> 04:32:16.880
I'm not able to hear you. Are you on mute? I'm not on mute. Can you hear me now?

04:32:17.920 --> 04:32:21.680
Yeah, I can hear you now. That is correct. It should equal 100%.

04:32:23.360 --> 04:32:28.640
And what will happen if, it sounds like what you're thinking to do is to divide the local

04:32:28.640 --> 04:32:35.680
assignment option folks into those that may continue to be called ineffective, and those that,

04:32:36.480 --> 04:32:43.040
you know, cannot have a credential because there isn't one for AVID or a leadership course or

04:32:43.040 --> 04:32:49.040
whatever. And where would you think to put them? Would they just be under properly assigned?

04:32:51.120 --> 04:32:56.320
Or is that still a question? We are working on through those conversations.

04:32:56.320 --> 04:33:04.320
Okay. We're still looking at the data, and I, you know, the data is in its first year

04:33:04.960 --> 04:33:09.120
of collection, and we know from first year of collection of data, that's a little messy.

04:33:09.120 --> 04:33:16.480
So we need to be sure that the credentials and the local assignment options follow the criteria

04:33:16.480 --> 04:33:23.680
that set forth an education code. And I don't know that we're quite there yet. So that's why

04:33:23.680 --> 04:33:29.840
I'm not, I'm not being very specific. I just want to say. It's okay. We're coming back to it. I just

04:33:29.920 --> 04:33:34.960
was curious. And so maybe we would even add a line that says local assignment option or something,

04:33:34.960 --> 04:33:42.080
but I'm ahead of you. So we'll talk about it in September. The other question I have,

04:33:42.080 --> 04:33:47.040
I thought that the comments from some of the stakeholders about just adding a column that

04:33:47.040 --> 04:33:55.840
allows for percentages as well as numbers and the sort of comparison to the state or district average

04:33:56.800 --> 04:34:03.040
might be an easy thing to do. Is that your view that that could be readily added?

04:34:04.320 --> 04:34:09.360
We can always convert numbers to percentages. I understand the interest there. We've talked

04:34:09.360 --> 04:34:15.200
about it with our team. I think, you know, the table could get very large. So the suggestion

04:34:15.200 --> 04:34:23.520
that we would make is for the rows, with the exception of the total, be simply in percentages

04:34:23.520 --> 04:34:28.720
and then have the total be the numbers. And so people can go back and figure out,

04:34:29.680 --> 04:34:35.840
you know, what the conversion of the percentage to a real number. But adding district and state

04:34:35.840 --> 04:34:42.400
level data, you know, once we're into the data set, we can definitely put those comparisons

04:34:42.400 --> 04:34:46.400
in place. We do have a little bit of time. Of course, you're adopting the template now.

04:34:46.400 --> 04:34:53.120
We will not release the data in the template until after Thanksgiving. So we do have quite

04:34:53.120 --> 04:34:58.000
a bit of time to work through this, at least for SARC purposes. Our intention is, of course,

04:34:58.000 --> 04:35:02.400
to get a public data set out much sooner on DataQuest. So I just want to put that out there.

04:35:02.400 --> 04:35:08.640
We've got some competing reporting things going on. But in terms of what you've asked for,

04:35:08.640 --> 04:35:13.360
yes, that is doable. And again, that would be our suggestion on how to make that addition.

04:35:14.320 --> 04:35:20.160
That'd be great. I think they'll make it usable for the folks who want to use it.

04:35:20.160 --> 04:35:25.920
The other suggestion that was made was to do reporting by student group. And I don't know

04:35:25.920 --> 04:35:33.440
what viability of that suggestion is. I would just mention, I think that that's

04:35:33.440 --> 04:35:37.920
really outside of what the statute is calling for. I think there are other places to include

04:35:37.920 --> 04:35:44.480
information such as student group and to member Rucker's point about, you know, this is simply a

04:35:44.480 --> 04:35:49.200
data point. I think there probably needs to be more support without the rollout of that.

04:35:50.160 --> 04:35:56.000
So here for me, I do have a hesitation in including that in the SARC, but it is definitely

04:35:56.000 --> 04:36:02.480
something we are eager to get out, especially on DataQuest. You really change the narrative when

04:36:02.480 --> 04:36:08.560
you add the student group information in there. But I think as far as meeting the needs and

04:36:08.560 --> 04:36:13.360
alignment with the criteria under ESSA, that is at this point, I mean, it would go above and beyond

04:36:13.360 --> 04:36:22.960
the statute. Okay. So noting that it would be more straightforward to provide percentages,

04:36:23.920 --> 04:36:31.040
as well as a number that you could also cross-hatch with, and district and state data,

04:36:31.040 --> 04:36:38.720
I'd like to suggest that that be part of what we propose for the template in response to the

04:36:38.720 --> 04:36:44.640
stakeholders and hold off on things that take us into more uncharted territory. And we'll look

04:36:44.640 --> 04:36:51.600
forward to hearing more about the local assignment options when we see you in September. Are there

04:36:51.600 --> 04:37:01.600
other questions or comments? Hearing none, I will just add one more comment, which is hooray. This

04:37:01.600 --> 04:37:07.840
is really terrific. And I'd like to see if there's a motion. I'll move approval.

04:37:09.120 --> 04:37:13.040
Thank you. Is there a second? I will second. Patricia Rocker will second.

04:37:13.600 --> 04:37:21.360
Thank you. Any further discussion? All right. We'll call the roll for votes. Member Son.

04:37:23.200 --> 04:37:33.680
Aye. Vice President Strauss. Aye. Member Rocker. Yes. Member Rodriguez. Yes. Member

04:37:33.680 --> 04:37:49.360
Petillo-Brownson. Yes. Member McQuillin. Member Glover-Woods. Yes. Member Fatah. Yes.

04:37:50.240 --> 04:38:01.200
President Darling-Hammond. Yes. Motion carries. Wonderful. We are making good time towards the

04:38:01.200 --> 04:38:07.360
goal of getting out by five. So that was both well presented and efficiently voted on.

04:38:08.320 --> 04:38:12.880
And what a great contribution to the data that will be available to people in our state.

04:38:13.600 --> 04:38:17.920
We're going to move on to item six, which is the proposed revisions of the local control funding

04:38:17.920 --> 04:38:24.160
formula, local indicator self-reflection tool for priority three. That's quite a mouthful.

04:38:24.800 --> 04:38:30.160
It has to do with family and parent and family engagement. That's our priority three.

04:38:30.800 --> 04:38:36.000
And the CDE recommends that we adopt the revisions to the local indicator self-reflection tool for

04:38:36.000 --> 04:38:47.920
priority three, proposed in attachment one. And I'll allow the State Department representatives

04:38:47.920 --> 04:38:53.520
to explain all of the aspects of what that means in terms of revising the instructions,

04:38:53.520 --> 04:38:59.600
the narrative prompt, requiring LEAs to provide an appropriate response within each field,

04:38:59.600 --> 04:39:04.400
and then updating the dashboard functionality. And this item will be presented by Lindsay

04:39:05.440 --> 04:39:11.760
Tornatore and Lisa Borrego of the California Department of Education. Lindsay, please begin.

04:39:17.120 --> 04:39:18.880
We can't hear you. I can't hear you.

04:39:18.880 --> 04:39:28.720
Sorry. Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strauss,

04:39:28.720 --> 04:39:32.560
Chief Deputy Gregson, and members of the board. My name is Lindsay Tornatore,

04:39:32.560 --> 04:39:36.720
and I am the Director of the Student Achievement and Support Division. And I am joined here today

04:39:36.720 --> 04:39:41.120
with my colleague, Lisa Borrego, the Director of the Family Engagement Division. You will be

04:39:41.120 --> 04:39:46.160
hearing from Lisa a little later on in this presentation, as she is here today to share

04:39:46.160 --> 04:39:51.280
an overview of the newly established Statewide Family Engagement Network and how they are

04:39:51.280 --> 04:39:56.240
partnering with the CDE to respond to the strengths, progress, and the focus areas for

04:39:56.240 --> 04:40:01.680
improvement identified in this item. As President Darling-Hammond stated, this item is an action

04:40:01.680 --> 04:40:07.520
item. The action that the CDE is requesting the State Board take is to adopt four key revisions.

04:40:08.320 --> 04:40:14.480
Two, the current version of the LCFF local indicator LEA self-reflection tool for priority

04:40:14.480 --> 04:40:19.760
three, parent and family engagement. There are four primary revisions that we are bringing to

04:40:19.760 --> 04:40:25.760
all of you for consideration today. All of these can be found on page two of this item. A summary

04:40:25.760 --> 04:40:31.040
of the recommended revisions is provided on this slide, which are to revise the instructions to

04:40:31.040 --> 04:40:37.040
clarify that the ratings and narrative responses must be based on an analysis of stakeholder input

04:40:37.040 --> 04:40:43.200
and local data, separate the current single narrative prompt into three separate narrative

04:40:43.200 --> 04:40:49.280
prompts, require LEAs to provide an appropriate response within each field in the dashboard,

04:40:49.840 --> 04:40:55.760
and update the dashboard business rules to avoid LEAs from inputting null signs or zeros,

04:40:55.760 --> 04:41:00.720
and to include the revisions to the self-reflection tool that are potentially adopted by the State

04:41:00.720 --> 04:41:06.320
Board today. I want to take a moment and highlight the fact that these proposed revisions do not

04:41:06.320 --> 04:41:12.160
create any new requirements for LEAs. Rather, the proposed revisions are intended to provide

04:41:12.160 --> 04:41:17.520
additional clarity for LEAs as to the process they are to use in reporting progress towards

04:41:17.520 --> 04:41:22.880
priority three and to ensure that LEAs address each aspect of the narrative prompts.

04:41:26.320 --> 04:41:31.120
The recommended revisions to the priority three LEA self-reflection tool were informed from the

04:41:31.120 --> 04:41:36.400
findings of a study that was conducted in partnership between the CDE, the Region 15

04:41:36.400 --> 04:41:42.080
Comprehensive Center, and the Regional Educational Laboratory West, both at West Ed. This study was

04:41:42.080 --> 04:41:47.280
conducted at the request of the State Board, made during its March 2019 meeting, when the current

04:41:47.280 --> 04:41:52.800
version of the LEA self-reflection tool for priority three was adopted. The request from

04:41:52.800 --> 04:41:57.120
the State Board was that the first year of implementation of the priority three local

04:41:57.120 --> 04:42:03.600
indicator self-reflection tool be conducted based on the data LEAs reported in the 2019 dashboard.

04:42:04.320 --> 04:42:08.720
The findings from the analysis of rating and narrative data, along with the full report,

04:42:08.720 --> 04:42:12.800
was shared as a June 2021 information memorandum.

04:42:15.840 --> 04:42:20.800
While the focus of this item is on the recommended revisions to the priority three self-reflection

04:42:20.800 --> 04:42:25.520
tool and based on data that was reported pre-pandemic, I would like for all of us to

04:42:25.520 --> 04:42:30.080
acknowledge the work that our LEAs are currently doing and have been doing related to continuous

04:42:30.080 --> 04:42:36.320
improvement and continuous capacity building of meaningful family engagement. It is because of

04:42:36.320 --> 04:42:40.960
our LEAs commitment to family engagement and continuous improvement work that we even have

04:42:40.960 --> 04:42:46.880
local indicator data to study and discuss. The priority three local indicator data reported by

04:42:46.880 --> 04:42:52.400
our LEAs already has and will continue to stimulate conversations around how to support

04:42:52.400 --> 04:42:56.800
and improve family engagement practices throughout the state for the benefit of our students and

04:42:56.800 --> 04:43:03.040
families. The content of this report was developed by the CDE under the leadership of our small but

04:43:03.040 --> 04:43:09.120
ever-mighty local agency system support office, or as we know them as LASSO. Special thanks to

04:43:09.120 --> 04:43:14.480
Lydia Venturia, Radine Girola, Joshua Strong, and our former LASSO leader Jeff Brashears

04:43:14.480 --> 04:43:20.400
for publishing such a thorough report. Also, this report would not have been possible without the

04:43:20.400 --> 04:43:25.600
support from the Region 15 Comprehensive Center and the Regional Educational Laboratory West.

04:43:26.320 --> 04:43:32.080
We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to our colleagues Margit Berg and Minchen Gidini for

04:43:32.080 --> 04:43:36.960
their guidance and commitment they offered to this report. Appreciations and shout outs to all of

04:43:36.960 --> 04:43:42.880
our colleagues at the Region 15 Comp Center and Rail West at Westud. So in the next three slides

04:43:43.600 --> 04:43:48.000
highlight some of the trends and themes that emerged out of this study and showcase that the

04:43:48.000 --> 04:43:54.320
vast majority of California's LEAs are engaging in high quality research-based practices that

04:43:54.320 --> 04:44:01.840
promote accessible, inclusive, and data-driven parent and family engagement. This study used

04:44:01.840 --> 04:44:09.040
a mixed methods approach. The quantitative analysis examined how 2,361 LEAs rated themselves

04:44:09.040 --> 04:44:14.400
on the implementation of the 12 research-based practices in family engagement on a five-point

04:44:14.400 --> 04:44:20.720
Likert scale. The qualitative analysis examined the narrative responses from a stratified sample

04:44:20.720 --> 04:44:27.200
of 198 LEAs to gain some insight into how they describe their strengths, focus areas for improvement,

04:44:27.200 --> 04:44:32.720
and how they referred to evidence and engaged stakeholders. The quantitative analysis yielded

04:44:32.720 --> 04:44:37.680
the finding that the most commonly reported rating across the 12 research-based practices

04:44:37.680 --> 04:44:44.240
identified in the tool was a rating of four full implementation out of possible five points of full

04:44:44.240 --> 04:44:50.000
implementation and sustainability. Similarly to the ratings, the majority of the LEAs from the

04:44:50.000 --> 04:44:55.120
stratified sample reflected on their strengths and progress when responding to the narrative prompts.

04:44:58.000 --> 04:45:03.600
The table on this slide provides some specific examples as reported by LEAs in the 2019

04:45:03.600 --> 04:45:08.960
dashboard related to their strengths and focus areas of improvement. This table is an abridged

04:45:08.960 --> 04:45:15.040
version of the data shared in the 2019 report which can be found in Appendix D of Attachment 2

04:45:15.040 --> 04:45:23.600
of the June 2021 memo. LEAs reported that engaging underrepresented families as an area of strength

04:45:23.600 --> 04:45:29.040
and progress noted that some of their efforts included cultural recognition and cultural

04:45:29.040 --> 04:45:33.680
celebrations, providing interpretation services and materials in multiple languages,

04:45:34.480 --> 04:45:38.160
removing barriers and providing transportation and child care during meetings,

04:45:38.800 --> 04:45:43.280
and supporting students experiencing homelessness, foster youth, students with disabilities,

04:45:43.280 --> 04:45:50.400
and other underrepresented students. And LEAs who reported that providing system-level support

04:45:50.400 --> 04:45:55.200
as an area of focus for improvement noted that some of their efforts and aspirations include

04:45:55.840 --> 04:46:00.480
to create a supportive collaborative system, structure, and environment for both educators

04:46:00.480 --> 04:46:05.280
and families, to use various communication methods to communicate with families and or

04:46:05.280 --> 04:46:10.160
to make information accessible and understandable to all families, and to provide training and

04:46:10.160 --> 04:46:17.520
support to administrators and staff to better engage families. Other themes that were identified

04:46:17.520 --> 04:46:22.160
among the LEA's narrative responses for how they reflected on their strengths, focus areas

04:46:22.160 --> 04:46:27.040
for improvement, and how LEAs referred to evidence and engaging their stakeholders include but are

04:46:27.040 --> 04:46:32.720
not limited to building trusting relationships, two-way communication with families. I will not

04:46:32.720 --> 04:46:38.160
read the whole slide but I will just summarize. And some focus areas for improvement themes

04:46:38.160 --> 04:46:42.400
provide professional development on cultural proficiency and best practices for working

04:46:42.400 --> 04:46:48.160
effectively with our underrepresented families. And as far as how LEAs refer to evidence and

04:46:48.160 --> 04:46:53.920
engage stakeholders themes, survey data or other forms of evidence to inform their responses to

04:46:53.920 --> 04:46:58.800
the narratives and or ratings, feedback loops, focus groups, interviews, surveys, et cetera,

04:46:58.800 --> 04:47:05.360
were most commonly seen throughout our analysis. And again, this table is only a small sampling of

04:47:05.360 --> 04:47:10.320
the data shared in the full analysis from this study, which can be found in attachment to

04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:17.600
Appendix D of the June 2021 information memo. And it is a good transition from discussing the

04:47:17.600 --> 04:47:23.120
themes of strengths, progress, and areas of focus for improvement that I now introduce my colleague

04:47:23.120 --> 04:47:28.320
Lisa Borrego, who will share the role that the newly established statewide family engagement

04:47:28.320 --> 04:47:33.680
network is playing in the continuous development of LEA's capacity to improve and expand their use

04:47:33.680 --> 04:47:38.800
of evidence and creative ways to engage their parents and families in their continuous improvement

04:47:38.800 --> 04:47:48.400
journeys. Thank you, Lindsay. Good afternoon. It is my pleasure to be here with you today to

04:47:48.400 --> 04:47:53.440
provide some information related to the statewide family engagement network. We first want to

04:47:53.440 --> 04:47:58.640
acknowledge and extend a heartfelt thank you to all of the families throughout California who work

04:47:58.640 --> 04:48:03.440
with their schools and their students every day. You make a difference in the lives of your children

04:48:03.440 --> 04:48:09.280
and in your school communities. We are eternally grateful. I'm excited to share a little

04:48:09.280 --> 04:48:14.160
information related to the family engagement network. The statewide family engagement network

04:48:14.160 --> 04:48:19.680
was established in January 2021 and is a partnership between the California Department of Education

04:48:19.680 --> 04:48:25.440
and the Parent Organization Network. We want to acknowledge the project director Adeseli Simeon

04:48:25.440 --> 04:48:31.040
for her leadership and contributions to this work. Participants currently represent a diverse

04:48:31.040 --> 04:48:35.600
group of stakeholders including advocacy groups, county offices of education,

04:48:35.600 --> 04:48:41.760
institutes of higher education, charter schools, LEA's and state agency partners. The meetings

04:48:41.760 --> 04:48:46.480
provide an opportunity for cross-agency collaboration along with opportunities to

04:48:46.480 --> 04:48:51.200
discuss capacity building and identification of best practices in family engagement.

04:48:53.760 --> 04:48:58.160
The following two slides provide some background on the three meetings that have been held since

04:48:58.160 --> 04:49:06.240
January 2021 along with items discussed at each meeting. Our first meeting was focused on providing

04:49:06.240 --> 04:49:12.320
input and feedback to the 2019 priority three data analysis that was mentioned by my colleague Ms.

04:49:12.320 --> 04:49:19.280
Tonotore related to the R15 CC and REL West report. In addition, we heard from the parent

04:49:19.280 --> 04:49:24.640
organization network who shared their findings of their report, family engagement in California,

04:49:24.640 --> 04:49:29.120
strengths, needs and trends from the 2019 priority three self-reflection tool

04:49:29.120 --> 04:49:34.240
which were based on a sample of LEA narratives. Input and feedback from the meeting helped to

04:49:34.240 --> 04:49:41.360
inform the recommendations proposed in this board item. The second meeting in March focused on the

04:49:41.360 --> 04:49:46.320
idea of developing a cross-agency network to support capacity building of family engagement

04:49:46.320 --> 04:49:51.600
in California. The parent organization network shared a landscape analysis of family engagement

04:49:51.600 --> 04:49:56.560
resources and supports organized by the three domains identified in the priority three

04:49:56.560 --> 04:50:01.680
self-reflection tool. Input was also gathered related to family engagement supports needed

04:50:01.680 --> 04:50:07.680
in preparation for reopening of schools. And the third meeting in June was about sharing best

04:50:07.680 --> 04:50:13.600
practices related to the three self-reflection tool domains, building relationships, partnership

04:50:13.600 --> 04:50:18.560
for student outcomes and engaging families in decision making. There were partnership

04:50:18.640 --> 04:50:24.800
presentations and resources shared. A topic area for the group continues to be how to engage with

04:50:24.800 --> 04:50:29.600
the field to increase broader support for family engagement and building capacity as we return to

04:50:29.600 --> 04:50:34.880
in-person learning. As demonstrated by the work that is going on with the family engagement

04:50:34.880 --> 04:50:40.400
network, the analysis of the 2019 priority three local indicator data has stimulated multiple

04:50:40.400 --> 04:50:45.600
conversations around how to support and improve family engagement throughout the state in today's

04:50:45.600 --> 04:50:48.560
current environment. Lindsay, I'll turn it back to you.

04:50:56.880 --> 04:51:01.920
Thank you, Lisa. So as you can see, the work of the FEN is a bright spot for our state,

04:51:01.920 --> 04:51:05.920
and we are excited for it to continue to grow and contribute to the capacity building of

04:51:05.920 --> 04:51:11.280
our LEAs as a shared responsibility and partnership among all of us. The current

04:51:11.280 --> 04:51:17.040
priority three LEA self-reflection tool, which was adopted in 2019, is included in this item

04:51:17.040 --> 04:51:22.080
as attachment two, and the proposed tool is included in this item as attachment three.

04:51:22.720 --> 04:51:32.800
The actual revisions that are being proposed to be made to the tool are to update the visual

04:51:32.800 --> 04:51:39.040
format to emphasize the practices and ensure that all LEAs rate themselves on a scale of one to five,

04:51:39.680 --> 04:51:44.320
break up the single narrative prompt box into three separate narrative boxes as opposed to

04:51:44.320 --> 04:51:50.000
one narrative box to address all three components of the current prompt, add the phrase based on

04:51:50.000 --> 04:51:54.880
the analysis of stakeholder input and local data to the beginning of each narrative prompt,

04:51:55.520 --> 04:52:00.880
and create dashboard business rules that will remove the ability for LEAs to enter a zero or

04:52:00.880 --> 04:52:06.880
null sign or leave narrative prompt boxes blank. Again, it is important to note that these four

04:52:06.880 --> 04:52:12.400
recommendations do not bring any substantial content changes to the tool. Rather, the

04:52:12.400 --> 04:52:17.600
recommended revisions provide additional clarity for LEAs related to the process they are to use

04:52:17.600 --> 04:52:23.360
in reporting their progress towards priority three. As shared in attachment three of this item,

04:52:23.360 --> 04:52:27.840
you can see that the recommended revisions are incorporated by way of formatting changes to the

04:52:27.840 --> 04:52:31.760
tool, and the other revisions will be addressed through dashboard functionality updates.

04:52:32.640 --> 04:52:36.880
If the board takes action to adopt the proposed revisions to the tool today,

04:52:36.880 --> 04:52:43.200
then this revised tool will be used in tandem with the development of the 22-23 LCAP,

04:52:43.200 --> 04:52:51.200
and will be reported in the dashboard in fall of 2022. The 2021 dashboard will open for 2021

04:52:51.200 --> 04:52:57.840
local indicator data reporting on August 13, 2021. The proposed revisions to the priority three

04:52:57.840 --> 04:53:02.960
self-reflection tool will not be applied to the 2021 local indicator reporting period.

04:53:06.960 --> 04:53:12.800
Back to the CDE recommendation, which is the CDE recommends the State Board of Education take action

04:53:12.800 --> 04:53:17.680
to revise the LCFF local indicator self-reflection tool for priority three,

04:53:17.680 --> 04:53:23.040
parent and family engagement, to include the four recommendations gleaned from the 2019 study.

04:53:23.040 --> 04:53:30.240
And with that, I will turn it back to President Darling-Hammond.

04:53:34.480 --> 04:53:42.720
Thank you for that very both well presented and engaging item. We want to put up the public

04:53:42.720 --> 04:53:50.160
comment slide, if you don't mind, so that we can get people queued up. Members of the public wishing

04:53:50.160 --> 04:53:55.280
to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the phone number and using the access

04:53:55.280 --> 04:54:00.400
code provided on this slide. And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in,

04:54:00.400 --> 04:54:05.440
I do want to ask Vice President Strauss as the accountability liaison if she has any initial

04:54:05.440 --> 04:54:14.160
comments. President Darling-Hammond, so let me just say I appreciate Lindsay and the presentation,

04:54:15.120 --> 04:54:20.720
discussion of the study. I think sometimes it's always good to go back and look at what we've

04:54:20.720 --> 04:54:28.960
done and hear voices from stakeholders help us get better. And what I believe is this is a true

04:54:28.960 --> 04:54:36.640
illustration of continuous improvement and progress. Again, as I look at districts and how

04:54:36.640 --> 04:54:42.880
they work with their stakeholders and engagement from 2013 when we first started this process

04:54:42.880 --> 04:54:48.560
to now, I think people have really developed and engaged in a far more sophisticated and

04:54:48.560 --> 04:54:55.920
inclusive way than we did overall at the beginning of LCFF. And so I think that this is a reflection

04:54:55.920 --> 04:55:03.440
of continuous improvement and the priority of family and parent engagement and how we measure

04:55:03.440 --> 04:55:10.320
that. I'm excited about the statewide family engagement network as a structured way to make

04:55:10.320 --> 04:55:16.560
sure we get a balance of voices. Araceli Simeon was a member of CPAC and really helpful in our

04:55:16.560 --> 04:55:23.680
process there. And I believe that this will help us to do a better job to make sure we're getting

04:55:23.680 --> 04:55:30.000
both hard and soft data to make sure we're informing the best practices. So thank you

04:55:30.000 --> 04:55:36.800
again for the presentation and I support the recommended changes. Thank you. Terrific. And

04:55:36.800 --> 04:55:42.560
Member Record, do you have a clarifying question? Your hand is up on my...

04:55:44.400 --> 04:55:50.960
Okay, very good. Then seeing no other clarifying questions, we'll go to public comment if we have

04:55:50.960 --> 04:55:59.200
any. Yes, we currently have three callers in the queue. Reminder, if you would like to speak to

04:55:59.200 --> 04:56:06.000
this item, please call in at this time. Caller number one, please state your name and affiliation

04:56:06.000 --> 04:56:15.280
for the record. Your time starts now. Yes, I'm hoping to speak to agenda item number seven.

04:56:15.280 --> 04:56:20.320
Am I at the wrong place in line here? Okay, you'll need to call back for item number seven.

04:56:20.320 --> 04:56:26.880
Thank you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

04:56:26.880 --> 04:56:29.760
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:56:29.760 --> 04:56:37.280
Good afternoon. My name is Aracely Zinion and I'm the Director of the Parent Organization Network.

04:56:37.840 --> 04:56:44.240
Last Friday, we submitted a letter in support of CDE's proposed revisions to the LCFS Priority 3

04:56:44.240 --> 04:56:49.440
self-reflection tool and to offer additional recommendations. When considering these

04:56:49.440 --> 04:56:55.840
recommendations, I urge you to refer to Dr. Mike Hurst-Fremar, pondering about the impact of

04:56:55.920 --> 04:57:00.960
LCFS in the classroom and the transformation of teaching and supporting professional development.

04:57:01.680 --> 04:57:07.360
Research on the self-reflection tool shows that the LCFS and Priority 3 are having an impact on

04:57:07.360 --> 04:57:12.400
family and community engagement, but the gains are greater in community engagement and felt

04:57:12.400 --> 04:57:18.960
more strongly at the district level. However, if we invest in strengthening family school

04:57:18.960 --> 04:57:24.320
and family teacher partnerships, we can get to improve outcomes for students and for schools.

04:57:24.320 --> 04:57:28.800
So I urge you to adopt the three recommendations in our letter, seeking to increase transparency

04:57:28.800 --> 04:57:33.600
on the engagement process for the self-reflection tool and to strengthen guidance and professional

04:57:33.600 --> 04:57:38.880
development to implement Priority 3. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

04:57:38.880 --> 04:57:42.800
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:57:45.360 --> 04:57:48.720
Good afternoon, President Hammond-Darling and State Board. I'm Dr. Marlene Batiste,

04:57:48.720 --> 04:57:53.200
Director of State and Legislative Affairs for CABE. We support the points raised in the LCFS

04:57:53.200 --> 04:57:57.680
equity coalition letter to strengthen the tool as follows. Add a prompt similar to that in the

04:57:57.680 --> 04:58:02.400
LCAP template and instructions for stakeholder engagement that requires LEAs to describe who

04:58:02.400 --> 04:58:07.200
participated in completing the Priority 3 self-reflection tool and how. Direct CD to engage

04:58:07.200 --> 04:58:13.040
stakeholders such as county offices of education, CCE, et cetera, develop guidance, for example,

04:58:13.040 --> 04:58:18.080
rubric, facilitation guides, and modified survey questions to support LEAs in carrying out Priority

04:58:18.080 --> 04:58:23.120
3 self-reflection tool to standardize the scale rating and to identify best approaches and develop

04:58:23.120 --> 04:58:27.680
initiatives to build staff capacity regarding family engagement and then integrate the component

04:58:27.680 --> 04:58:31.600
into the system of support. We finally include family engagement in the list of the professional

04:58:31.600 --> 04:58:36.160
development topics funded through the Educator Excellent Block Grant and other related funding

04:58:36.160 --> 04:58:40.880
sources or programs for educator professional development. Thank you so much. Thank you.

04:58:41.600 --> 04:58:46.320
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:58:48.880 --> 04:58:53.200
Good afternoon. Lucero Chavez on behalf of the Parent Institute for Quality Education

04:58:53.200 --> 04:58:57.680
or PRINQUE, the National Family Engagement Organization by Eastern California and part

04:58:57.680 --> 04:59:02.640
of the LCFS equity coalition. Speaking of coalition support, CDU's recommended changes

04:59:02.640 --> 04:59:07.680
to the local indicator self-reflection tool for Priority 3. We recommend further strengthening

04:59:07.680 --> 04:59:12.240
the tool to ensure that districts have what they need to improve their family engagement practices,

04:59:12.240 --> 04:59:17.120
such as adding a prompt similar to the LCAP template, directing CDE to engage stakeholders

04:59:17.120 --> 04:59:21.840
to develop guidance to support LEAs in carrying out the tool to standardize the scale ratings

04:59:21.840 --> 04:59:26.320
and build capacity regarding family engagement and include family engagement in the list of

04:59:26.320 --> 04:59:31.200
professional development topics funded through the Educator Excellent Block Grant and other

04:59:31.200 --> 04:59:36.080
related funding sources. In short, we urge the board to direct the CDE to dedicate more time

04:59:36.080 --> 04:59:40.960
and resources to develop guidance and coordinate efforts across CDU divisions and education

04:59:40.960 --> 04:59:46.240
agencies to develop research-based practices for family engagement. Thank you for your time

04:59:46.240 --> 04:59:52.080
and consideration. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:59:52.080 --> 04:59:59.760
Your time starts now. Hello, this is Elizabeth Guillen with Public Advocates. I would like to

04:59:59.760 --> 05:00:06.560
echo the comments of my colleagues in the equity coalition about strengthening the self-reflection

05:00:06.560 --> 05:00:12.480
tool. In short, we agree with our partners in the family engagement network, particularly

05:00:13.440 --> 05:00:19.920
in the parent organization network. LEAs that have greater knowledge of family engagement research

05:00:19.920 --> 05:00:25.120
tend to rate themselves lower on the scale because they recognize their weaknesses,

05:00:25.120 --> 05:00:32.320
while many LEAs rating themselves higher describe overly basic practices that are unlikely to result

05:00:32.320 --> 05:00:39.680
in truly effective family school partnerships that improve outcomes for students in schools.

05:00:39.680 --> 05:00:45.280
We think LEAs need more guidance to understand the tool and its utility for self-improvement.

05:00:45.920 --> 05:00:51.760
We urge the board to direct staff to make these small improvements to the self-reflection tool.

05:00:51.760 --> 05:00:58.640
Thank you. Thank you. This is last call for item number six. Next caller,

05:00:58.640 --> 05:01:02.720
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:01:02.720 --> 05:01:09.680
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strout,

05:01:09.680 --> 05:01:16.000
Deputy Superintendent Stephanie Gregson, Jessica Sacco calling on behalf of Children Now.

05:01:16.560 --> 05:01:22.320
I want to thank the CDE for bringing forward this item and simply align my comments with

05:01:22.320 --> 05:01:26.720
the previous four callers from the equity coalition and keep my comments brief. Thank you.

05:01:26.800 --> 05:01:34.960
Thank you. This concludes public comment for item number six. Thank you.

05:01:35.600 --> 05:01:42.800
All right. With that, let's see if there's any discussion from the board.

05:01:42.800 --> 05:01:50.160
Are there comments or questions from board members? Member Sun.

05:01:50.400 --> 05:01:58.240
Yes. Hi. Thank you for the excellent presentation. My internet dropped off,

05:01:58.240 --> 05:02:07.680
so I had to re-log in. I apologize. I missed a part of it. I wanted to just make a general

05:02:07.680 --> 05:02:16.720
observation around some of the specifics of this reflection tool, which I'm also seeing in the LCAP

05:02:16.800 --> 05:02:25.680
as well, is that I think in our efforts to try to guide and nudge LEAs to be more specific

05:02:26.320 --> 05:02:34.160
in their narratives, that we are actually doing something where we're making the

05:02:36.640 --> 05:02:45.280
responses much more choppy. There's these narratives that are in boxes now, and the questions

05:02:45.280 --> 05:02:50.400
tend to repeat themselves. They'll start with, for example, based on the analysis of stakeholder

05:02:50.400 --> 05:02:55.040
input and local data, briefly describe blah, blah, blah. Then the next question will start

05:02:55.040 --> 05:03:02.640
with the same one again. You have to really read to get at what each different question is. Then

05:03:02.640 --> 05:03:11.040
in the end, the LEA is providing very short-term answers or short answers to something that I

05:03:11.040 --> 05:03:18.560
think should be more comprehensive. I understand the reasons for it. I'll support the

05:03:18.560 --> 05:03:24.960
recommendation, but I just wanted to bring up that I feel like we're now getting to a point where we're

05:03:26.640 --> 05:03:33.600
sacrificing the larger storytelling of what's happening in these LEAs, which was the original

05:03:33.600 --> 05:03:42.560
intent of the LCAP and of these analysis tools for the sake of trying to get at details, and now

05:03:42.560 --> 05:03:52.080
we're actually getting really choppy. I just wanted to raise that concern. Any other questions or

05:03:52.080 --> 05:04:07.680
comments? Thank you. Very quickly, I want to echo what Member Sun just said and add that

05:04:10.080 --> 05:04:17.520
I would like to see a reflection that ends with how did this lead to student achievement? How did

05:04:17.520 --> 05:04:24.640
this lead to reducing dropouts? How did these particular actions, instead of just come to a

05:04:24.640 --> 05:04:33.280
meeting, sign in, you participated in decision-making, but was there a, and I didn't see that and perhaps

05:04:33.280 --> 05:04:39.120
maybe it's in here, but I would like to see a little bit more of that, more thought add to the story.

05:04:40.960 --> 05:04:43.920
Not thought, that was the wrong choice of words. There's a lot of thought in this.

05:04:44.480 --> 05:04:51.280
The more outcome from the meetings or the parent engagement.

05:04:54.080 --> 05:04:56.240
Any other comments or questions?

05:04:59.040 --> 05:05:07.680
Number Glover Woods. Thank you. I just wanted to say I appreciate the comments that were previously

05:05:07.680 --> 05:05:14.960
made. I thought the breakout of the narrative into three separate prompts actually was very helpful

05:05:15.600 --> 05:05:25.040
to be able to ensure that, again, we're able to hear the story from the LEAs, but that each of those

05:05:25.840 --> 05:05:31.840
areas of the narrative are very critical, and having them divided in the way that they were

05:05:32.480 --> 05:05:39.600
allows for a response to be given to each. I definitely see how it could be felt to be choppy

05:05:39.600 --> 05:05:46.480
as well, but from my perspective, I think really getting the information for each of those narrative

05:05:46.480 --> 05:05:54.400
prompts in each of the areas is most helpful to all stakeholders and anyone who might be looking

05:05:54.400 --> 05:06:02.240
at this reflection tool. Any other comments or questions?

05:06:06.880 --> 05:06:13.680
Seeing none, oh, is there somebody? No, well, I just wanted to add on that.

05:06:15.280 --> 05:06:20.240
Understanding that we want to try to get to some of these details, and it may help guide

05:06:20.720 --> 05:06:31.040
the thinking for LEAs. I would rather see us put effort more into the professional development,

05:06:31.040 --> 05:06:37.520
into the training of the responses rather than kind of changing the check boxes. I'm just afraid

05:06:37.520 --> 05:06:44.640
we're growing into a trend where these analysis tools are becoming more of a compliance checklist

05:06:45.280 --> 05:06:53.120
and rather than a broader reflection and a narrative that really cohesively

05:06:53.680 --> 05:06:55.920
discusses their thoughts and their plans.

05:07:00.240 --> 05:07:05.040
Okay, any other comments or questions?

05:07:05.440 --> 05:07:13.840
I'm sure the staff will reflect on these ideas, and we are in a moment where we need to

05:07:15.200 --> 05:07:22.640
move forward and approve where we are with this tool, so I need a motion if there is one.

05:07:24.160 --> 05:07:28.000
Oh, Member Strauss, I see that your hand went up. Did you want to make a motion or did you want to

05:07:28.000 --> 05:07:31.440
make a comment? Yeah, I'm glad to make a motion, but I just want to make a motion.

05:07:31.920 --> 05:07:35.920
Did you want to make a comment? Yeah, I'm glad to make a motion, but I just want to clarify what

05:07:35.920 --> 05:07:41.840
Member Sung said. So, Member Sung, are you saying that the part that's divided out into three

05:07:41.840 --> 05:07:48.160
separate pieces you would say is doing that choppiness? Is that what you're concerned about?

05:07:48.800 --> 05:07:55.360
Well, yeah, I'm just seeing that the same kind of strategy is in our current LCAP,

05:07:55.360 --> 05:08:03.360
and we're starting to go down the road of separating out these questions into blocks,

05:08:04.000 --> 05:08:10.320
and it just, again, I think just blocks the flow of the overall thought. So again,

05:08:10.320 --> 05:08:15.280
I will support the recommendation. I just wanted to raise this as an issue and for us as we are

05:08:15.280 --> 05:08:22.480
continuously looking at our templates to think about that. So, a global general comment,

05:08:22.480 --> 05:08:29.760
and I would just say I would support the thinking going forward that we don't end up with so many

05:08:29.760 --> 05:08:34.720
separate little boxes that it becomes just a bureaucratic rather than getting the result

05:08:34.720 --> 05:08:39.840
that we really want, which is a deeper thoughtful reflection connected to the data and the input.

05:08:40.480 --> 05:08:44.560
Yeah, that's exactly my point. Thank you. And I think it's related to the point that

05:08:44.560 --> 05:08:49.280
Member Rodriguez was making about to the extent that the narrative can also say,

05:08:50.000 --> 05:08:56.000
these are the things we did and here's how we think it supported some of our goals for students.

05:08:56.720 --> 05:09:02.400
That's also part of that desired narrative, and then the kind of thinking we want.

05:09:03.360 --> 05:09:10.480
Then my question is to Lindsay Tornatore. Is that something that going forward your division will

05:09:10.480 --> 05:09:16.960
take in consideration for additional modifications going forward? I know we need a recommendation on

05:09:16.960 --> 05:09:22.960
this today, but I don't want to lose the message that it's going to become so choppy and so many

05:09:22.960 --> 05:09:27.600
little different pieces that it won't get the result that we really hope for in the end.

05:09:29.040 --> 05:09:35.440
Yes, Member Strauss, absolutely. And thank you all members for your comments on this feedback

05:09:35.440 --> 05:09:40.800
and observations noted. Definitely we will take this into consideration both in how we message

05:09:40.800 --> 05:09:45.360
out to the field during our professional development, our collaborations with CESA and

05:09:45.360 --> 05:09:50.880
CISC LCAP collaboration calls, and also as we continue to get ready to bring some new revisions

05:09:50.880 --> 05:09:58.880
to the LCAP template to you at upcoming board meetings. Thank you, much appreciated. So with

05:09:58.880 --> 05:10:05.360
understanding that CDE will be continuing to look at this and in further recommendations will take

05:10:05.360 --> 05:10:12.400
our comments into consideration, I move approval of CDE's recommendation of the four actions

05:10:13.120 --> 05:10:17.760
to the revisions of the self-reflection tool for priority tree.

05:10:19.040 --> 05:10:24.480
I think I'll second that. I second. Oh, there's already a second. We have several seconds, but I

05:10:24.480 --> 05:10:30.400
heard Member Glover Woods first, I think. Thank you. Any other discussion of the item?

05:10:31.920 --> 05:10:34.880
All right, Brooks, let's do our roll call vote.

05:10:35.840 --> 05:10:46.000
President Darling-Hammond. Yes. Member Patel. Yes. Member Glover Woods. Yes. Member McQuillan.

05:10:47.520 --> 05:10:58.560
Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson. Yes. Member Rodriguez. Yes. Member Rucker. Yes. Vice President Strauss.

05:10:59.520 --> 05:11:11.600
Yes. Member Son. Yes. Motion carries now. Terrific. Thank you, Lindsay and Lisa. We have earned

05:11:11.600 --> 05:11:17.200
ourselves another 10-minute break. I'm going to ask that you put the public comment slide back up

05:11:18.240 --> 05:11:24.320
now because we can allow people to queue up for item number for the waiver items, which is

05:11:25.040 --> 05:11:30.880
coming next. And there's not a lot of time after we introduce this item for people to get in the

05:11:30.880 --> 05:11:36.800
queue. We don't want to lose anybody who may want to make a comment. So that slide is up there.

05:11:37.360 --> 05:11:41.360
People who want to comment on waiver items one through 12 can get themselves ready.

05:11:42.320 --> 05:11:52.160
In about 53, let's come back at by 3.05. Give you a couple of extra minutes and get that

05:11:52.720 --> 05:11:59.120
coffee for that mid-afternoon jolt. And we'll see you at 3.05. Don't leave the meeting. Just

05:11:59.120 --> 05:12:06.560
turn off your video and your microphone. All right. Welcome back. Board members, we need

05:12:06.560 --> 05:12:11.760
to reestablish a quorum. So Brooks is going to call the roll. President Darling-Hammond.

05:12:12.640 --> 05:12:19.440
Here. Member Patel. Here. Member Glover Woods. Here. Member McQuillan.

05:12:22.240 --> 05:12:31.840
Here. Member Petillo-Brownson. Here. Member Rodriguez. Here. Member Rucker. Here. Vice

05:12:31.840 --> 05:12:40.960
President Strauss. Here. Member Son. Here. Have a quorum. All right. We're going to take up our

05:12:40.960 --> 05:12:47.120
waiver consent calendar, which includes waiver items one through 12. We'll now open the phone

05:12:47.120 --> 05:12:51.920
line for the public comment queue, and members of the public wishing to provide comment can call

05:12:52.480 --> 05:12:58.320
the phone number and use the access code provided on the slide. And since we've had that up for a

05:12:58.320 --> 05:13:03.920
little while, we can find out if there is any public comment on those waiver items.

05:13:05.120 --> 05:13:12.320
Yes. We have three callers in the queue. Once again, please make sure that you are only calling

05:13:12.320 --> 05:13:17.360
in for waivers one through 12. If you're calling for another item, please call back

05:13:18.960 --> 05:13:24.720
for that particular item. First caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:13:24.720 --> 05:13:32.800
Your time starts now. SBE members, my name is Sheila Fletley, and I'm a classroom teacher

05:13:32.800 --> 05:13:38.720
representing the California Teachers Association. CTA would like to express our continued concern

05:13:38.720 --> 05:13:43.440
with the funding determination process for non-classroom-based charters that have been

05:13:43.440 --> 05:13:50.800
outlined in past letters to the SBE, especially given past statements made at the ACCS that the

05:13:50.800 --> 05:13:57.520
NCB funding determination process is pro forma. CTA believes that there must be heightened oversight

05:13:57.520 --> 05:14:04.480
and transparency regarding these charters. With the extended moratorium, we believe that CDE and

05:14:04.560 --> 05:14:11.600
SBE should be investigating whether NCBs are using funds appropriately

05:14:11.600 --> 05:14:18.480
and how the funding determination process can be overhauled. Specific to the NCB in this item,

05:14:19.200 --> 05:14:26.160
MAAC community charter, we're glad to see a rare funding request that complies with the existing

05:14:26.160 --> 05:14:33.360
rules around funding levels and does not ask for a waiver for 100% funding that is not warranted.

05:14:33.360 --> 05:14:40.640
Thank you. Thank you, caller. The last two callers dropped out, so there are no more callers in the

05:14:40.640 --> 05:14:52.480
queue. Public comment for waivers items 1 through 12 is now over. Okay, given that there's no other

05:14:52.480 --> 05:15:01.040
public comment, I'll ask for a motion on waivers 1 through 12. I will move approval of the 12 waiver

05:15:01.040 --> 05:15:09.200
items on consent. Thank you. A second? Seconded. Thank you. We'll now call a roll call vote.

05:15:09.200 --> 05:15:19.680
Brooks, please call the roll. Member Son. Aye. Vice President Strauss. Aye. Member Rucker. Aye.

05:15:20.320 --> 05:15:30.720
Member Rodriguez. Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson. Yes. Member McQuillan. Aye. Member Glover Woods.

05:15:32.000 --> 05:15:41.680
Yes. Member Fatah. Yes. President Darling-Hammond. Yes. Motion carries unanimously. Okay,

05:15:42.400 --> 05:15:48.480
now we're going to take up regular consent items 7 through 10 and we want to open the phone line

05:15:48.480 --> 05:15:55.440
again for queue for public comment on the consent items. If you can put the slide back up,

05:15:56.080 --> 05:16:00.240
members wishing to provide comment on regular consent items 7 through 10,

05:16:00.880 --> 05:16:05.920
they do so by calling the telephone number using the access code provided on the slide

05:16:05.920 --> 05:16:13.760
that is shown now. I want to remind callers that item 7 is only about the schedule

05:16:13.760 --> 05:16:19.200
for the development of the math frameworks, not about the content of the draft framework.

05:16:19.840 --> 05:16:24.080
Accordingly, comments on this item should be limited to those that directly address

05:16:24.960 --> 05:16:30.560
post schedule. If anyone wishes to provide comments on the content of the draft framework,

05:16:30.560 --> 05:16:35.680
there will be an opportunity to provide written comment during the public comment period this

05:16:35.680 --> 05:16:44.480
fall so the board can review and consider all feedback in detail. So with that, I will ask if

05:16:44.480 --> 05:16:53.280
we have any public comment on regular consent items 7 through 10. We do have one caller in the

05:16:53.280 --> 05:17:02.240
queue. Again, this is only for consent items 7 through 10. If you have general public comment,

05:17:02.240 --> 05:17:10.480
that will be taken up after these items. Callers, now 2, please state your name and affiliation for

05:17:10.480 --> 05:17:27.360
the record. Your time starts now. Caller, you're live. Caller ending in 9099, you're live.

05:17:30.640 --> 05:17:36.640
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:17:37.440 --> 05:17:44.240
Oh, hi. This is Susan Koloik. I'm a parent of a rising 8th grader in Palo Alto Unified.

05:17:44.800 --> 05:17:52.720
I made a public comment on the current mathematics framework and the revised framework needs to have

05:17:52.720 --> 05:17:58.000
the opportunity for public comment. Thank you for your effort on this. Thanks. Thank you, caller.

05:17:58.000 --> 05:18:04.240
And just a reminder, we are only taking public comment about the timeline itself. There will be

05:18:05.200 --> 05:18:12.800
an opportunity for written public comment during the public comment period, the 60-day period,

05:18:12.800 --> 05:18:21.040
which will follow the adjustment to the timeline. If you're on this call for waiver call or item 7

05:18:21.040 --> 05:18:28.320
through 10, please stay in the line. If you're calling in for public comment, please call back

05:18:28.320 --> 05:18:35.200
after this item. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

05:18:35.200 --> 05:18:44.000
now. My name is Lori Myers with Educators for Quality and Equality, and I'm calling on behalf of

05:18:44.000 --> 05:18:49.680
over 1,000 educators, parents, and voters. We appreciate that the CDE is taking time to implement

05:18:49.680 --> 05:18:55.440
the extensive new additions and revisions to the framework approved by the AQC at the last meeting.

05:18:55.440 --> 05:19:00.160
However, because of the scope of this new material and the controversy already surrounding

05:19:00.160 --> 05:19:04.480
the framework and its recommendations, we are deeply concerned that there is no opportunity

05:19:04.480 --> 05:19:10.480
for the IQC to review these substantive changes before the SBE votes to approve the framework

05:19:10.480 --> 05:19:17.440
in spring 2022. Over 500 public comments have been submitted asking the SBE to comply with Title 5

05:19:17.440 --> 05:19:24.320
California Code of Regulations section 9515 by approving a new timeline that includes the public

05:19:24.320 --> 05:19:29.920
IQC meeting so the IQC can review the significantly revised draft and public comments and make its

05:19:29.920 --> 05:19:36.160
recommendations to the SBE and to give the public a full 60-day review and comment period prior to

05:19:36.160 --> 05:19:42.560
this IQC meeting in fall 2021 or winter 22. The extensive changes to the framework that need an

05:19:42.560 --> 05:19:47.920
additional bunch to make and do the full IQC review and public comments. Thank you.

05:19:47.920 --> 05:19:54.480
Thank you. Your time is up. And just to remind everyone of President Darling-Hammond's comments,

05:19:54.480 --> 05:20:01.600
there will be a 60-day comment period for the math framework. Next caller,

05:20:01.600 --> 05:20:05.600
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:20:06.000 --> 05:20:11.440
Hi. Good afternoon. This is Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together. And Californians Together,

05:20:11.440 --> 05:20:16.560
along with many other partner organizations, including Education Trust West, have really

05:20:16.560 --> 05:20:22.480
appreciated the opportunity to work as a partner with the CFTC and IQC committees all along the way

05:20:23.200 --> 05:20:27.440
in the development of the mathematics framework. And we definitely appreciate the responses by

05:20:27.440 --> 05:20:32.720
members of the commission to include language from our different suggestions that address issues

05:20:32.720 --> 05:20:37.440
from our different suggestions that address issues of equity and language access.

05:20:37.440 --> 05:20:41.840
We support the extended time for development of the next draft of the framework and will continue

05:20:41.840 --> 05:20:47.440
to work to improve the chapter on instructional materials and also continue to provide comments

05:20:47.440 --> 05:20:54.080
along the way. Thank you again for your work on this important piece of guidance for educators

05:20:54.080 --> 05:20:58.480
and have a great rest of your meeting. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

05:20:58.480 --> 05:21:02.560
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:21:02.720 --> 05:21:11.600
My name is Bill Lucia from EdVoice. EdVoice is in support of delaying the formal public comment

05:21:11.600 --> 05:21:16.400
period on the revised framework. And we recommend that the board direct the superintendent and the

05:21:16.400 --> 05:21:22.080
executive director of the IQC to ensure all applicable provisions of Title V and the Ed

05:21:22.080 --> 05:21:27.120
Code are followed with respect to both academic grade level standards, content, and the process

05:21:27.120 --> 05:21:32.160
of adoption. In addition, as highlighted in our letter, students don't rise to low expectations.

05:21:32.720 --> 05:21:38.640
EdVoice is concerned about proposals that recommend all students remain in the same minimum

05:21:38.640 --> 05:21:44.000
competency math sequence through the 10th grade and mandating non-mathematic content be added to

05:21:44.000 --> 05:21:49.200
the content of pedagogy of math instruction. As we noted in our letter, frameworks become mandatory

05:21:49.200 --> 05:21:53.440
criteria for evaluation of state adopted materials and these proposals are not consistent with

05:21:53.440 --> 05:21:58.480
adopted grade level academic mathematics standards or consistent with current and confirmed research

05:21:58.480 --> 05:22:05.440
as required. Thank you. Thank you, callers. Just a quick reminder, this is only for

05:22:07.520 --> 05:22:13.920
our consent item seven through 10. The math framework item consists only of the timeline,

05:22:13.920 --> 05:22:19.440
not the content of the framework. Please limit your comments to the timeline only.

05:22:20.080 --> 05:22:24.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:22:24.720 --> 05:22:31.440
Good afternoon. My name is Kari Lofeng and I'm a board member with California Association for the

05:22:31.440 --> 05:22:36.160
Gifted and a district coordinator for gifted education services in a Northern California

05:22:36.160 --> 05:22:41.360
school district. California Association for the Gifted has been heartened and is grateful that

05:22:41.360 --> 05:22:46.400
the authors of the math framework have promised to make these significant revisions to the draft

05:22:46.400 --> 05:22:51.360
that was presented to the IQC in May and that they have asked for the additional time

05:22:52.240 --> 05:22:57.760
to get California to better support California's gifted students. Because these revisions are

05:22:57.760 --> 05:23:03.680
indeed promised to be so extensive, we respectfully ask that the document be viewed as a draft

05:23:03.680 --> 05:23:09.840
and not yet finalized for review by this esteemed body. Rather respectfully, we ask that the draft

05:23:09.840 --> 05:23:16.800
document be returned to the IQC for robust discussion, review, and public comment before

05:23:16.800 --> 05:23:22.720
being returned to the State Board of Education. Thank you caller. Next caller,

05:23:22.720 --> 05:23:26.400
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:23:28.960 --> 05:23:34.480
Yes, my name is Michael Malione and I'm a parent in Piedmont, California and I've been following

05:23:34.480 --> 05:23:41.440
this adoption timeline or the timeline for reviewing and given the delay five months

05:23:41.440 --> 05:23:46.000
and the amount of rewriting that was requested, it seems to me that this really falls into the

05:23:46.000 --> 05:23:51.920
category of another draft and so it should be handled as such. It should go to a 60-day public

05:23:51.920 --> 05:23:58.480
review before going to the IQC and then coming back for a final review and that would seem to

05:23:58.480 --> 05:24:03.920
be the appropriate timeline that should be followed in this case given the circumstances

05:24:03.920 --> 05:24:07.200
and given all the public comments that there were the last time around. Thank you.

05:24:08.000 --> 05:24:13.280
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

05:24:13.280 --> 05:24:26.160
starts now. David Margulies, parent in California and I am also calling,

05:24:28.160 --> 05:24:33.360
I'm calling to request that the SBE add an IQC meeting and a public comment period to the

05:24:33.360 --> 05:24:38.160
mass framework schedule. I personally do not understand for something as important as our

05:24:38.160 --> 05:24:43.680
kids' education why it is even being considered acceptable to deny this. The first draft sparked

05:24:43.680 --> 05:24:48.640
significant controversy as shown by all the newspaper publicity. There is even an open

05:24:48.640 --> 05:24:54.720
letter to the SBE and IQC signed by almost 500 California scientists and technology fields

05:24:54.720 --> 05:24:59.520
objecting to it. Therefore, shouldn't the IQC be at least allowed to have a meeting on this?

05:25:00.160 --> 05:25:04.000
For a large amount of parents, we did not even hear about what was happening in the framework

05:25:04.000 --> 05:25:08.720
until the newspaper started publicizing it and by then it was too late to public comment on the

05:25:08.720 --> 05:25:14.240
draft. So a large amount of parents were not able to. It is only fair that we get a chance to comment

05:25:14.240 --> 05:25:20.240
on the education of our kids. It seems devious to not allow the IQC to review and not allow public

05:25:20.240 --> 05:25:24.800
comment. In the introductory presentations for this meeting, there was quite a bit of mention

05:25:25.280 --> 05:25:30.560
about the California way. Well, hopefully the California way is not to bypass commissions

05:25:30.560 --> 05:25:36.080
and deny public comment. Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name

05:25:36.080 --> 05:25:44.960
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. My name is Dr. Julie Nyberg and I serve as

05:25:44.960 --> 05:25:49.280
Executive Director for the California Association for the Gifted. Thank you to the State Board of

05:25:49.280 --> 05:25:54.400
Education for supporting advanced learners in California. We would like to recommend the public

05:25:54.480 --> 05:26:02.160
have a 60-day review of the document in draft form followed by a review by the IQC to review

05:26:02.160 --> 05:26:07.360
the draft version of the math framework. The California Association for the Gifted would like

05:26:07.360 --> 05:26:11.760
to recommend that universal access to talent development and gifted services are provided at

05:26:11.760 --> 05:26:16.720
every school site and explicitly encouraged in the math framework to nurture great minds in a

05:26:16.720 --> 05:26:21.520
golden state. Failure of the California public education system provide access to an advanced

05:26:21.520 --> 05:26:27.040
mathematics curriculum that is reinforced by gifted and talented services, systemically enhances

05:26:27.040 --> 05:26:32.480
the excellence gap and reinforces disparities with students who are underrepresented, underserved,

05:26:32.480 --> 05:26:37.840
and are from varying cultural, racial, ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Data

05:26:37.840 --> 05:26:42.160
from the Office of Civil Rights has revealed that American Indian, Alaska Natives, Black, Latinx,

05:26:42.160 --> 05:26:46.960
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander students are under identified in California and therefore

05:26:46.960 --> 05:26:52.000
not receiving gifted and talented services which constitute intellectual needs in mathematics.

05:26:54.320 --> 05:26:58.880
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:27:02.560 --> 05:27:09.120
Yes, hi. My name is Kathy Jordan. I'm a parent of a student in public school

05:27:09.760 --> 05:27:15.200
and given that we may be denied an opportunity to give public comment later, although I also

05:27:15.200 --> 05:27:20.160
echo that we should have another opportunity of public comment. I wanted to ask that the

05:27:20.160 --> 05:27:26.640
California math framework be modified to accommodate students taking Algebra 1 in 8th grade and to aim

05:27:26.640 --> 05:27:33.360
for completion of calculus in 12th grade in that math sequence and progression. This math framework

05:27:33.360 --> 05:27:39.120
and its attempt to lower math standards conflicts with the goal and purpose of the California Math

05:27:39.120 --> 05:27:44.160
Placement Act. In attempting, its purpose and goal was attempting to help students of color

05:27:44.720 --> 05:27:51.520
and other students to reach and complete calculus by grade 12. This California math framework

05:27:51.520 --> 05:27:57.840
instead attempts to ensure that students of color and other students do not reach and complete

05:27:57.840 --> 05:28:05.760
calculus by the end of 12th grade. This seems as though it's seeking to treat everyone the same.

05:28:05.760 --> 05:28:13.840
Thank you caller. Your time is up. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

05:28:13.840 --> 05:28:22.560
for the record. Your time starts now. Good afternoon, Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children

05:28:22.560 --> 05:28:27.680
Now and the California STEM Network. I'm just calling in support of the extended revised timeline

05:28:27.680 --> 05:28:33.120
in order to allow the writers sufficient time to incorporate the edits requested by the IQC while

05:28:33.120 --> 05:28:37.680
continuing to maintain the document's fidelity to equitable math instruction for all students.

05:28:37.680 --> 05:28:44.000
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:28:50.080 --> 05:28:54.320
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:28:58.000 --> 05:29:03.680
Yes, my name is Krista Landgraf and I'm a teacher in the Chino Valley Unified School District.

05:29:04.640 --> 05:29:10.960
I'm calling to thank the writers for one for their continued commitment to a thorough rewrite of the

05:29:10.960 --> 05:29:17.840
California math framework and public comment and specifically I would like to see a public

05:29:17.840 --> 05:29:24.640
full 60-day draft review and comment period either this fall or the winter of 2022 and also

05:29:24.640 --> 05:29:31.200
an opportunity to schedule a public IQC meeting with members to review the revised draft and allow

05:29:31.200 --> 05:29:38.160
for public comment. Thank you. Thank you caller. This concludes the public comment period for

05:29:38.160 --> 05:29:49.760
consent item seven through ten. Thank you. Thank you very much. At this point we can take any

05:29:53.040 --> 05:29:56.240
further conversation from the board if there is any.

05:29:56.240 --> 05:30:07.280
All right, do I have a motion then? Linda, I did raise my hand. Oh sorry,

05:30:08.320 --> 05:30:17.360
it's not popping up. Thank you. No problem. I just wanted to thank everyone who has been involved

05:30:17.360 --> 05:30:23.440
both with the IQC on the board and has sent in comments today as well as emails concerning

05:30:23.440 --> 05:30:31.120
the revision on the mathematics framework and timeline. Today's item is only about the timeline

05:30:31.120 --> 05:30:38.480
not approving the content of the math framework itself. The revision of the mathematics framework

05:30:38.480 --> 05:30:43.760
as you all will recall was the first framework that this board approved after the adoption of

05:30:43.760 --> 05:30:49.600
the common core and the revision of that framework has been a multi-step process throughout that

05:30:49.600 --> 05:30:55.680
revision process. There were multiple opportunities for public input at educator focus groups,

05:30:55.680 --> 05:31:01.200
at the framework curriculum committee meetings, the instructional quality commission as well

05:31:01.200 --> 05:31:08.640
as state board meetings and during two different 60-day public review periods. So I did hear that

05:31:08.640 --> 05:31:16.320
there were concerns about following the opportunities for public comment. The revised timeline

05:31:16.320 --> 05:31:23.440
outlines some major steps in the framework revision process and it's important to note

05:31:23.440 --> 05:31:31.200
that during the IQC's last meeting in May, the panel made some very specific recommendations

05:31:31.200 --> 05:31:38.560
to revise the document based on the field review comments and that revision work is continuing now.

05:31:39.200 --> 05:31:45.680
Given that there will likely be enough time for another public check-in between now and next May

05:31:45.680 --> 05:31:52.400
when the board is expected to take action to approve the framework, I think it is appropriate

05:31:52.400 --> 05:32:00.000
to add a placeholder on the calendar for another opportunity for public comment and review and

05:32:00.000 --> 05:32:07.040
further discussion at an IQC meeting should it be needed and I would suggest putting that placeholder

05:32:07.040 --> 05:32:15.680
for an IQC meeting in early 2022 that can follow the next planned 60-day public comment period

05:32:15.680 --> 05:32:22.960
that's in the timeline that we will be approving with this item today and I would also suggest

05:32:22.960 --> 05:32:28.320
giving our executive director as part of the approval of this item the authority to call the

05:32:28.320 --> 05:32:36.240
meeting. So your proposal is first of all you've clarified that as we know there still will be

05:32:37.040 --> 05:32:44.400
another 60-day response to the draft so that is clear in any event and you're suggesting that

05:32:44.400 --> 05:32:51.200
we simply give the executive director the authority if there is a if it appears warranted to convene

05:32:51.200 --> 05:32:59.920
the IQC yes in the time period yes okay that sounds reasonable to me is there any objection

05:32:59.920 --> 05:33:10.480
to that approach that makes a lot of sense I am seeing no distension so with that I would like

05:33:10.480 --> 05:33:18.480
to see if we have a motion to approve the consent items does consent item seven through ten I will

05:33:18.480 --> 05:33:24.400
move to approve consent item seven through ten okay and do I have a second I'll second it

05:33:25.280 --> 05:33:30.000
all right we'll hold the roll call vote Brooks please call the roll number son

05:33:32.160 --> 05:33:43.360

please use the phone number on this slide and include the participant access code

05:34:43.600 --> 05:34:48.880
and while we're waiting for any members of the public to call in do I have a member motion from

05:34:48.880 --> 05:34:56.880
the board member to approve the revised March 11 12 2020 state board of education report action

05:34:56.880 --> 05:35:03.440
meeting minutes and the draft preliminary report of action minutes for the May 12 13 2021 meeting

05:35:04.400 --> 05:35:09.920
I move that we approve both sets of minutes as read okay thank you do I have a second

05:35:34.080 --> 05:35:37.200
and brooks will keep track of the raised hands

05:35:39.200 --> 05:35:44.480
oh I know that's that's that's if we have discussion sorry I was looking at this I was

05:35:44.480 --> 05:35:49.360
like why are we doing a roll call vote that way brooks please hold the roll call vote of course

05:35:49.360 --> 05:35:59.600
thank you uh president Darling Hammond yes member Patah yes member Glover Woods yes member McQuillin

05:36:01.040 --> 05:36:03.040

05:36:06.880 --> 05:36:17.680
yes sorry member Rodriguez yes member Rucker yes vice president Strauss yes member Sun

05:36:20.240 --> 05:36:25.040
okay so we're now going to go to the board member liaison reports and I want to invite members to

05:36:25.040 --> 05:36:33.200
report on liaison activities that are not related to any items on our March agenda please uh uh

05:36:34.240 --> 05:36:39.680
offer your comments um and we're going to go and reverse alphabetical word and begin with the

05:36:40.480 --> 05:36:46.640
one president Darling Hammond we lost audio there for just a second oh okay let me say it again we're

05:36:46.640 --> 05:36:54.080
going to do our liaison reports uh and we ask that you report on our liaison activities that are not

05:36:54.080 --> 05:37:02.320
related to items on our March agenda and we're going to do our liaison reports uh and we ask that

05:37:02.320 --> 05:37:07.680
you report on our liaison activities that are not related to items on our March agenda

05:37:07.680 --> 05:37:15.840
and begin by calling our members okay very good yeah I will be very short because a number of my

05:37:15.840 --> 05:37:22.320
liaisons were covered in items two three and four today the only quick report I have is that the

05:37:22.320 --> 05:37:31.600
California workforce pathways joint advisory committee is continues to work on its California

05:37:31.600 --> 05:37:40.240
plan for um career technical education and we meet in August and I'm sorry I didn't quite

05:37:40.240 --> 05:37:48.160
expect that August 6th will be our next meeting date and that's all I have perfect uh vice president

05:37:48.160 --> 05:37:55.760
Strauss um yes um I'm going to skip the IQC report because member Rucker did share an update

05:37:56.640 --> 05:38:03.120
member Rucker did share an update and I believe our materials review will be shared by liaisons

05:38:03.120 --> 05:38:08.320
I did want to share President Darling Hammond and I are both members of the quantitative reasoning

05:38:08.320 --> 05:38:14.240
steering committee as part of CSU looking at a fourth year of math requirement that would be

05:38:14.240 --> 05:38:19.840
quantitative reasoning and it has a lot to do with us thinking about students being prepared

05:38:20.400 --> 05:38:27.440
for mathematics and success after high school and so there is a research study being going going on

05:38:27.440 --> 05:38:33.920
based on data from lab from fall of 2020 and there'll be a report presented to the CSU

05:38:33.920 --> 05:38:42.240
trustees in March of 22 um expecting the proposed timeline would be 2026 and the entering class of

05:38:42.240 --> 05:38:48.320
fall of 27 I know that sounds really far away but things do progress and it takes you a while to

05:38:48.320 --> 05:38:54.320
take a look at coursework and teacher preparation meanwhile the chancellor's office at CSU are

05:38:54.320 --> 05:39:00.480
supporting course and teacher capacity to help students get the best first instruction in

05:39:00.480 --> 05:39:05.440
algebra and to reduce failure rates so there's a whole project that are dealing with math and

05:39:05.440 --> 05:39:11.440
science teacher initiatives there's an increase in in teacher preparation enrollment which looks

05:39:11.440 --> 05:39:16.640
exciting and so I just wanted to share that because we are talking about mathematics and

05:39:16.640 --> 05:39:22.320
I think thinking about K through higher ed is an important pathway to consider

05:39:23.280 --> 05:39:29.760
the concurrence commission met on june 5th that's the subject matter projects and they're talking

05:39:29.760 --> 05:39:34.960
about responding to the call for racial justice and looking at the role of leadership development

05:39:34.960 --> 05:39:40.080
and what the role of the california subject matter project is so a couple of updates that I

05:39:40.080 --> 05:39:45.840
think are really interesting based on the discussion with dr cursed earlier about teacher capacity

05:39:46.640 --> 05:39:52.640
there's a lot of summer institutes going on on new frameworks building capacity and looking at

05:39:52.640 --> 05:39:59.040
teacher pipeline there's also because it's online it actually has increased the access for rural

05:39:59.040 --> 05:40:04.640
educators to have access to statewide professional development which I think is really exciting going

05:40:04.640 --> 05:40:11.280
forward and they're building a community of teacher leaders both locally and statewide and

05:40:11.360 --> 05:40:17.520
looking at the teacher shortage issue so just understand that our subject matter projects

05:40:17.520 --> 05:40:23.440
are working hard and do support our work the advisory commission on special ed met on june

05:40:23.440 --> 05:40:29.360
16th looking at a study on governance and accountability and the budget impact one of

05:40:29.360 --> 05:40:34.720
the highlights if you're interested in looking back at the video there was an item after lunch

05:40:35.200 --> 05:40:39.280
on voices from the field where administrators and special ed

05:40:39.280 --> 05:40:43.760
sopas talked about strategies for reopening schools for all students and they shared some

05:40:43.760 --> 05:40:49.520
really nice lessons and looking at how assessment and professional development so right after lunch

05:40:49.520 --> 05:40:57.920
on the axi agenda um really helpful and um lastly the last week on june 24th and 5th the

05:40:57.920 --> 05:41:03.360
california collaborative but district reform talked about the issues of returning to school

05:41:03.360 --> 05:41:08.000
and I think important to think about is what the promising practices are like we talked about on

05:41:08.000 --> 05:41:13.520
the sr item earlier we heard voices of students and from teachers and how important it is to

05:41:13.520 --> 05:41:19.760
include teacher well-being as well as student well-being and how hard and exhausting the last

05:41:19.760 --> 05:41:24.560
year has been there was also a good discussion which expands what we've been talking about

05:41:24.560 --> 05:41:30.000
what is the evidence for equity and improvement and what are date what are data sources we can

05:41:30.000 --> 05:41:34.400
use so I think it's important that we think about that as we return to school

05:41:35.120 --> 05:41:40.880
and there's a lot of work with our our partners in really trying to collaborate and help

05:41:41.920 --> 05:41:46.960
making sure that funding is strategically used in a way that supports sustainability and growth

05:41:47.520 --> 05:41:55.360
that ends my report thank you terrific thank you member rucker thank you as board member

05:41:55.360 --> 05:42:00.720
sprout said we've already covered the iqc on multiple items today and board member son has

05:42:00.720 --> 05:42:08.000
briefly spoken about the joint advisory committee on june 25th of this year the department of

05:42:08.000 --> 05:42:16.960
education in comp in in collaboration with a number of really important sponsors put on the

05:42:16.960 --> 05:42:23.920
early math symposium the conference itself was an amazing success and I think a model of effective

05:42:23.920 --> 05:42:30.000
online engagement among the participants and among the stakeholders who work to put this plant

05:42:30.000 --> 05:42:34.960
this program together I'm always amazed at how both the participants and the presenters

05:42:34.960 --> 05:42:41.280
can use technology to stay connected and how people continue to adapt to work in an online

05:42:41.280 --> 05:42:47.920
environment and make the presentations interactive the presenters are presented in fact from so many

05:42:48.000 --> 05:42:54.720
different places from california tennessee chicago illinois new jersey and even italy

05:42:54.720 --> 05:43:00.160
the conference was telecast around the world and there were participants in the conference from

05:43:00.160 --> 05:43:05.520
every continent as I said in my opening remarks for the conference I've always had a professional

05:43:05.520 --> 05:43:11.680
fantasy of bringing the world into my classroom for the first time in my life and probably the

05:43:11.680 --> 05:43:17.200
only time I actually had the opportunity to speak to the world the recorded sessions for

05:43:17.200 --> 05:43:23.040
the 2021 early math symposium are available to anyone who wants to look at them on youtube

05:43:23.680 --> 05:43:28.560
I also want to report on my work with the military compact there is a new program being

05:43:28.560 --> 05:43:33.840
launched called the purple star school program it's a new project to recognize schools that

05:43:33.840 --> 05:43:39.520
show a major commitment to students and families connected to our nation's military military

05:43:39.520 --> 05:43:44.880
connected students move a lot the purple star program is designed to help students respond

05:43:44.880 --> 05:43:50.720
to educational and social emotional challenges that military connected children face during

05:43:50.720 --> 05:43:56.240
their transition to a new school and also to encourage schools to pay attention to what it

05:43:56.240 --> 05:44:01.360
means to help keep those students on track to matriculate through school schools that earn a

05:44:01.360 --> 05:44:07.760
reward will receive a special purple star recognition to display on site and schools

05:44:07.760 --> 05:44:12.800
that qualify this school year will be announced in april the month of the military child

05:44:13.360 --> 05:44:19.440
and and then finally i am continuing my work with the significant disproportionality work group

05:44:19.440 --> 05:44:25.040
each year california submits a compliance report to the federal office of special education

05:44:25.040 --> 05:44:32.320
programs osep we get straight a's on that report except in one area the over identification of

05:44:32.400 --> 05:44:38.560
students of color for participation in special education programs for quite some time department

05:44:38.560 --> 05:44:44.240
staff have been engaged through this work group with stakeholders from pro program cohorts around

05:44:44.240 --> 05:44:49.680
the state to develop and implement a state performance plan to address the disproportionate

05:44:49.680 --> 05:44:56.160
representation by race and ethnicity of students receiving special education services the arc of

05:44:56.160 --> 05:45:01.760
this work has resulted in a refined procedure to identify schools with significant

05:45:01.760 --> 05:45:08.320
disproportionality the state has more accurately reviewed lea work on delivering special education

05:45:08.320 --> 05:45:15.360
services and has now been able to identify with statistical confidence the lea's that must address

05:45:15.360 --> 05:45:21.120
over identifying students particularly african-american boys this highly technical work

05:45:21.120 --> 05:45:27.440
to identify schools with significant disproportionality now needs to shift to

05:45:27.440 --> 05:45:34.800
focus on how to address the problem so i'm looking forward to the july 28 2021 work group meeting

05:45:34.800 --> 05:45:40.240
where the discussion will turn to planning supervising supporting and developing technical

05:45:40.240 --> 05:45:52.640
assistance that's the end of my report okay member rodriguez yes thank you so i have three

05:45:52.640 --> 05:45:58.800
reports one related to the summer school for the arts ctc and then the adoption of the world

05:45:58.800 --> 05:46:06.880
languages and arts materials so the california summer school for the arts is currently in session

05:46:07.520 --> 05:46:14.480
i attended the welcoming ceremony on sunday and it was so exciting to see over

05:46:15.440 --> 05:46:24.720
500 people in a zoom all of them with their cameras open and the enthusiasm of the students

05:46:25.760 --> 05:46:32.560
411 students i believe was the last count who attended the online school for the arts

05:46:33.520 --> 05:46:39.440
and it's a it's a state program although there is a tuition that is

05:46:40.560 --> 05:46:44.720
you know that goes along with the application process but there's also a foundation that

05:46:44.720 --> 05:46:53.600
supports students who can't afford the four weeks you know in working with

05:46:54.400 --> 05:46:59.680
master teachers incredibly impressive teachers heard from some of the alumni

05:47:00.400 --> 05:47:07.360
and and i learned a new word poggers i didn't know that word i know a lot of slang from

05:47:07.360 --> 05:47:12.720
teaching high school and i kept seeing poggers poggers when they would get excited in the

05:47:12.720 --> 05:47:23.120
in the chat box so it was fun and one of the so you know the disciplines are animation dance film

05:47:23.120 --> 05:47:31.120
music theater visual arts and writing and the applications by discipline were higher in

05:47:32.080 --> 05:47:39.040
animation visual arts and then writing we also had applicants who were from

05:47:40.960 --> 05:47:46.000
and participants actually from other countries because this is a very attractive program because

05:47:46.080 --> 05:47:53.600
it prepares students who actually who want to work in these fields but this time around

05:47:54.160 --> 05:48:03.440
and maybe because it was it was uh you know done online we had um 787 applicants from california

05:48:03.440 --> 05:48:10.000
11 from texas seven from new york five from new jersey five from china seven from canada

05:48:10.560 --> 05:48:18.640
and five from the uk so one of the under the direction of matthew gallagher who's the new

05:48:18.640 --> 05:48:29.280
executive director and he's been he's fairly new he's really pushing for more diversity and more

05:48:29.280 --> 05:48:38.800
statewide representation and the opening ceremony really reflected that because we do have students

05:48:38.800 --> 05:48:48.560
who are underrepresented um black students uh american indian and hispanic latino are

05:48:48.560 --> 05:48:54.880
definitely misrepresent are underrepresented um you know if you look at the statewide demographics

05:48:54.880 --> 05:49:02.880
so that is uh a an objective of his to increase the participation statewide and also only about

05:49:02.960 --> 05:49:11.840
five or six counties are represented los angeles county being the um the largest one and i'm going

05:49:11.840 --> 05:49:23.760
to share a website uh with the public and with the board members and it's www css for three s's

05:49:25.600 --> 05:49:32.720
ava exhibitions.com and you can see some of the work that the current students are producing

05:49:33.120 --> 05:49:40.880
and some of the art professors it's again incredibly exciting i left the welcome ceremony

05:49:40.880 --> 05:49:50.000
just so inspired um to see the enthusiasm i've never seen a chat box that busy with like yeah

05:49:50.000 --> 05:49:56.080
you know and the students just being you know just uh so excited and happy to be there and we know

05:49:56.080 --> 05:50:02.720
how powerful the arts are for growth for other type of learning and and especially i think for

05:50:03.440 --> 05:50:11.360
processing a lot of the um what you know at least in in the opening ceremony processing a lot of

05:50:11.360 --> 05:50:18.720
what we've been through in the last year and a half so um i'll move on to ctc and uh the

05:50:18.720 --> 05:50:24.320
california classified school employee teacher credentialing program which is a state grant

05:50:24.320 --> 05:50:30.560
program that helped classified school employees earn a teaching credential has added about 800

05:50:30.560 --> 05:50:37.120
new teachers to the california classrooms over the last five years um according to the report

05:50:37.120 --> 05:50:47.120
given at the june um the june 16th and 17th ctc meeting uh in 2006 the state budget allotted 20

05:50:47.200 --> 05:50:57.840
million and 25 million dollars for the second round in 2017 for this program the 2021-22 state

05:50:57.840 --> 05:51:05.680
budget that the legislator approved this week includes 125 million for the program so it's one

05:51:05.680 --> 05:51:11.520
of the responses that california took to address the teacher shortage that has left many classrooms

05:51:11.520 --> 05:51:16.640
without fully credentialed educators the report that was shared at june ctc meeting

05:51:17.360 --> 05:51:24.000
was prepared for the ctc by shasta college and while it found that the program has met

05:51:24.560 --> 05:51:31.920
the objectives of the legislature legislators i'm sorry um there are a list of recommendations

05:51:33.120 --> 05:51:40.720
giving guidance as the program continues um there were some disparities when it came to

05:51:40.720 --> 05:51:45.840
school districts that uh the way they manage you know different school district manage different

05:51:45.840 --> 05:51:52.320
programs so it's recommended that there uh be a limit on the management costs to ensure that

05:51:52.320 --> 05:52:01.840
the teacher candidates across the state are given similar amounts um and then with the passage uh

05:52:01.840 --> 05:52:07.840
president darling hammon mentioned the uh 2021 state budget agreement and there's a lot in there

05:52:07.840 --> 05:52:14.800
for um teacher preparation so um some of the there's some testing flexibility

05:52:15.600 --> 05:52:21.200
and um this extends the previously adopted windows of time when candidates for a teaching

05:52:21.200 --> 05:52:28.160
or admin credential can defer certain required tests because access to the test was limited by

05:52:28.640 --> 05:52:32.560
19 um school site or testing center closures

05:52:34.480 --> 05:52:37.680
suspends the requirement to complete the california

05:52:39.280 --> 05:52:45.360
administrator performance assessment um the candidates must complete the requirement

05:52:45.360 --> 05:52:51.680
prior to earning a clear credential though so it doesn't it doesn't um you know cancel it it just

05:52:51.680 --> 05:52:58.960
gives extra time there's more flexibility suspends the requirement to complete the rica the reading

05:52:58.960 --> 05:53:05.840
instruction competence assessment prior to early earning a preliminary credential if the candidate

05:53:05.840 --> 05:53:14.720
is unable to meet it between march 19 2020 and december 31st 2021 the commission may extend the

05:53:14.720 --> 05:53:22.960
deadline to june 30th 2020 due to testing center closures or capacity um and that will be revisited

05:53:24.320 --> 05:53:31.280
suspends the requirement to complete the c best prior to enrollment in the teacher preparation

05:53:31.280 --> 05:53:39.360
program again the commission um may extend the deadline suspends the requirement to complete

05:53:39.440 --> 05:53:44.080
the c set right which are the california subject examination for teachers

05:53:45.520 --> 05:53:52.640
also within the same time frame there's a credential fee waiver 20 million in a one-time

05:53:52.640 --> 05:54:01.440
general fund to provide a credential fee waiver in 21 22 for individuals earning entering the k

um dyslexia grants to preparation programs um two million dollars in a one-time general fund

05:54:51.200 --> 05:54:57.760

and i will um move on to the arts education instructional materials adoption

and the world languages instructional materials adoption which are underway currently underway

05:56:12.720 --> 05:56:21.200
on monday the training was held um for both and it was incredibly well organized participants

05:56:21.200 --> 05:56:28.320
commented as much and it was you know to sum it up the day included uh the why right why are we here

05:56:29.440 --> 05:56:35.520
how how are we going to go through this process and it was just so well articulated in charts

05:56:36.160 --> 05:56:42.080
with like you know this is how we're going to do this with sample charts um and you know based on

05:56:42.080 --> 05:56:47.840
the discussions that are had and then uh and then the what if which was actually a lot of fun

05:56:47.840 --> 05:56:52.080
it was scenarios with like well what if this happens right you know and how are we going

05:56:52.080 --> 05:57:01.520
to handle that so um the arts team will meet july 19th so next week through the 23rd for eight to

05:57:01.520 --> 05:57:09.520
five uh 8 a.m to 5 p.m and world language will meet the following week uh july 26 through july

05:57:09.520 --> 05:57:20.000
30th uh from eight to five thank you that was a lot it was i have to ask what is poggers what

05:57:20.000 --> 05:57:28.080
does poggers actually mean so poggers is like yay very excited and it comes from pog and i had to

05:57:28.080 --> 05:57:31.680
look it up and i wanted to make sure it was something appropriate because i kept seeing in

05:57:31.680 --> 05:57:37.440
the chat what poggers poggers all right well now now we have a new word that we can use in our

05:57:37.440 --> 05:57:42.240
state board meetings yes uh member patio brownson

05:57:44.240 --> 05:57:50.800
um and i have to say as you said pog all i could think of was pineapple orange guava juice is that

05:57:52.800 --> 05:58:05.600
related but yes cheer okay um so i um i'm going to uh give a a brief recap of the july excuse me

05:58:05.600 --> 05:58:10.640
june 9th early childhood policy council meeting this was prior to the adoption of the state

05:58:10.640 --> 05:58:17.600
budget though the state budget certainly was a large topic of discussion um and our board chair

05:58:17.600 --> 05:58:24.240
our madam president has already described the biggest headline of the proposal for and now

05:58:24.240 --> 05:58:30.240
adopted law um around universal transitional kindergarten which is very exciting and expected

05:58:30.320 --> 05:58:38.720
to serve around 400 000 students across the state at full implementation also very exciting to see

05:58:38.720 --> 05:58:46.240
the teacher professional development and pipeline expansion investments alongside what i think

05:58:46.960 --> 05:58:54.400
is is really part of an ongoing emphasis on addressing equity in the early years really

05:58:54.400 --> 05:59:01.680
to prevent the achievement gap before it happens by expanding universal tk but also maintaining

05:59:02.800 --> 05:59:09.520
all of the seats for three-year-old california state preschool to ensure that low-income children

05:59:09.520 --> 05:59:14.880
in california have two years of preparation and come into kindergarten ready to go

05:59:15.600 --> 05:59:21.840
um at that same meeting there was also a presentation of polling data

05:59:23.040 --> 05:59:28.320
for parents of children across the state inclusive of five-year-olds in the k-12 system

05:59:29.520 --> 05:59:36.640
and what was striking really was that among single parents in particular more than a

05:59:36.640 --> 05:59:43.440
quarter of those parents were actually feeding the children less or skipping meals during the

05:59:43.440 --> 05:59:51.120
pandemic as they were dealing with economics uncertainty three quarters of parents in the same

05:59:51.120 --> 05:59:57.680
category were expressing worries about their children's social emotional cognitive educational

05:59:57.680 --> 06:00:05.840
development and again connecting back to the state budget process i think what our our board president

06:00:05.840 --> 06:00:12.080
outlined was a host of educational investments but also there were a number of wraparound investments

06:00:12.080 --> 06:00:19.040
that i think are equally exciting to think about in terms of child tax credit to actually enable

06:00:19.040 --> 06:00:26.160
more economic security and part of parents and families there was the inclusion of 0 to 5 for

06:00:26.160 --> 06:00:33.440
the first time called out explicitly mental health services act for mental health service provision

06:00:34.160 --> 06:00:41.680
all of which i think to this whole child vision that madam president had described earlier so all

06:00:41.680 --> 06:00:49.040
around still excited and just flagging and maybe what is obvious that so many of these investments

06:00:49.040 --> 06:00:56.000
really are first for not just california but for the nation and there is so much excitement and

06:00:56.000 --> 06:01:02.400
attention i think that california is getting from leading the way and explicitly leading the way

06:01:02.400 --> 06:01:08.480
for thinking about early learning as a tool to actually promote more equitable and fair outcomes

06:01:08.480 --> 06:01:09.680
for kids have always been

06:01:13.200 --> 06:01:13.840
poggers

06:01:17.840 --> 06:01:24.400
member navo oh he he is no longer here member mcquillin all right thank you

06:01:25.520 --> 06:01:31.840
i'm looking forward to the joint task force on the career technical education also on august 6th

06:01:31.840 --> 06:01:37.040
his next meeting a lot more to report

06:01:39.200 --> 06:01:44.160
the superintendent mentioned that over at the department of education the

06:01:44.160 --> 06:01:50.320
american indian oversight committee is being reestablished restarted again i'm excited to

06:01:50.320 --> 06:01:53.680
hear that and i've heard some of the appointees to that committee and

06:01:55.360 --> 06:01:59.680
really good people to sit on that committee i'm so glad it's starting back up again

06:02:00.640 --> 06:02:08.320
and i too am a very excited about all the new resources available to california students to

06:02:08.320 --> 06:02:15.360
support our students out of the pandemic and and to help with the learning loss i'm just excited

06:02:15.360 --> 06:02:23.440
about all the new resources it's a new day in education in california and looking forward to

06:02:23.440 --> 06:02:28.640
to that as long as we don't have this variant or the delta variant getting in our way and

06:02:28.640 --> 06:02:31.760
and i'm really concerned about that also

06:02:34.080 --> 06:02:39.040
that's all i have thank you all right thank you very much and it is exciting that the

06:02:40.720 --> 06:02:45.600
task force is being reestablished in the department i think that's another sign of progress

06:02:46.320 --> 06:02:54.720
another occasion for a member glover woods thank you member rodriguez did touch a bit on the world

06:02:54.720 --> 06:03:00.080
languages instructional materials deliberation that's coming up so i'm just going to add a

06:03:00.080 --> 06:03:06.800
little bit to that again just a reminder it is going to take place the week of july 26

06:03:07.440 --> 06:03:14.480
through the 30th and the team has been doing their individual review of materials over the

06:03:14.480 --> 06:03:22.880
last couple of months and on that week of deliberations we will be looking at a total of

06:03:23.440 --> 06:03:29.120
11 programs that have been submitted by four different publishers and there will be nine

06:03:29.120 --> 06:03:35.840
programs that will be looked at for spanish and two for french so we're quite excited and looking

06:03:35.840 --> 06:03:41.280
forward to the robust conversation that will take place at the end of the month and that

06:03:41.280 --> 06:03:49.600
concludes my report thank you thank you and member fatah yeah definitely so um this past month uh

06:03:49.600 --> 06:03:56.240
actually from i believe it was june 23rd to the 25th um don't quote me on that though i hosted the

06:03:56.240 --> 06:04:02.800
ed 100 academy for student leaders and so that had uh brought in 400 students who joined in for

06:04:02.800 --> 06:04:08.080
almost all three days and they got to hear from amazing speakers such as sal khan our very own

06:04:08.080 --> 06:04:13.680
brooks allen uh who who spoke um and and just a plethora of other speakers who talked about kind

06:04:13.680 --> 06:04:18.320
of different facets of um ways in which students can impact education so that was a lot of fun

06:04:19.120 --> 06:04:24.640
um i've also begun training our upcoming student board member rana i know that she's watching

06:04:24.640 --> 06:04:30.720
right now because i got a text just uh recently saying poggers so um it's great to see her already

06:04:30.720 --> 06:04:35.040
kind of taking initiative and getting ready for for her term and i look forward to working with

06:04:35.040 --> 06:04:43.040
her um and and yeah i i in other news i graduated so um always always nice uh but um yeah this has

06:04:43.040 --> 06:04:47.760
just been such an awesome opportunity uh and uh i look forward to training rana

06:04:48.640 --> 06:04:54.880
and that concludes my liaison report awesome awesome uh and i am last in the queue and i sort

06:04:54.880 --> 06:05:03.440
of gave my report at the beginning of the meeting um but i will simply uh just add in the context of

06:05:04.240 --> 06:05:11.600
the assessment liaisoning that um member sun and i did there are these very robust conversations

06:05:11.600 --> 06:05:18.880
going on about assessment innovations including in the smarter balanced consortium uh where the

06:05:18.880 --> 06:05:26.160
the set of states are looking together at a number of ways to continue to improve what is our core

06:05:26.160 --> 06:05:32.800
assessment in cask for english language arts and math and talking about ways to make it more

06:05:33.600 --> 06:05:40.000
supportive of the teaching learning process during the year uh and among the things that

06:05:40.000 --> 06:05:46.400
the smarter balanced consortium is uh is a whole considering is the movement of some of the

06:05:46.960 --> 06:05:53.920
performance task activity into the classroom during the school year so there will be

06:05:53.920 --> 06:06:00.000
ongoing conversations between and among the 15 states of territories that comprise smarter

06:06:00.000 --> 06:06:05.280
balanced california will be part of those conversations and will be coming to echo record

06:06:06.080 --> 06:06:14.240
information as that unfolds it's exciting to think about that as a part of the new normal that may

06:06:14.960 --> 06:06:21.040
emerge and with that we have concluded our liaison reports we'll take up item

06:06:21.680 --> 06:06:27.280
11 which is general public comment we're going to put that public comment slide back up there again

06:06:27.840 --> 06:06:34.240
the public comment is invited on any matter that is not included in the printed agenda and we will

06:06:34.240 --> 06:06:41.120
open up the phone line for public comment if you want to make a comment use the numbers shown on

06:06:41.120 --> 06:06:48.080
public comment slide in the access code that is there i'm going to wait about 60 seconds because

06:06:48.080 --> 06:06:59.760
it takes there's a lag in the process of viewers getting the recording of our meeting so we don't

06:06:59.760 --> 06:07:06.640
want to cause anyone to miss the opportunity for public comment so with that in mind we're going to

06:07:07.360 --> 06:07:16.480
take a few more seconds to allow people to call in and queue up before we call for public comment

06:07:17.280 --> 06:07:23.680
and i'll ask i think it might be pam who's on duty with the comments to let us know

06:07:23.840 --> 06:07:33.360
uh in the next minute or so if you do have anyone who has called it at this time we have no public

06:07:33.360 --> 06:07:43.840
speakers uh for uh or no no callers for public comment we'll give it another 30 seconds just

06:07:43.840 --> 06:07:51.600
because we don't want to cause anyone who really wants to speak to be able to do so given that leg

06:07:52.560 --> 06:08:00.000
so we'll do our wait time we do have one person uh caller please speak your name

06:08:00.000 --> 06:08:03.440
and affiliation for the record your time starts now

06:08:07.040 --> 06:08:13.120
uh sorry to throw in a public comment so late in the day and keep you from concluding your

06:08:13.120 --> 06:08:20.720
your work uh on this difficult long day i wanted to put one issue on as a possibility for a future

06:08:20.800 --> 06:08:27.520
agenda item and that's something called the lcap portal this is a this is a data collection tool

06:08:27.520 --> 06:08:33.200
that was funded the development of which was funded in last year's budget in june 2020

06:08:34.160 --> 06:08:42.800
unfortunately the entire 2021 school year was spent simply doing the contracting around this

06:08:42.800 --> 06:08:50.000
tool we really want to see this tool move forward there's 450 000 from last year's budget to do that

06:08:50.080 --> 06:08:55.920
and we think that really starting to figure out what this tool could be would be of benefit and

06:08:55.920 --> 06:09:01.200
aligned with a lot of other board priorities in particular the continuous improvement process

06:09:01.200 --> 06:09:06.960
of having just supporting districts learning from each other and lcff fiscal transparency we

06:09:06.960 --> 06:09:12.880
think it will be really helpful in both of those fronts and and merits and attention from the board

06:09:12.880 --> 06:09:16.800
to figure out what this thank you caller your time's your time's up

06:09:19.120 --> 06:09:21.520
