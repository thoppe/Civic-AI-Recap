WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.880
at eight thirty nine a.m. and I'd like to commence by saluting the flag member Lewis

00:23.880 --> 00:52.400
Will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:52.400 --> 01:02.760
Having now resumed our very first in-person session in the last two plus years I am going to adjourn into closed session.

01:03.800 --> 01:10.120
Nice to see you all. I ask that the members of the public please leave the board room and board members please turn off their microphones.

01:10.520 --> 01:18.600
And during closed session the board will discuss and or take action on the following case E.E. versus state and we'll see you back here in just a few moments.

01:22.400 --> 01:45.640
We're back. So we have just in closed session discussed and taken action on the following legal matter the E.E. versus state case and we are launching our May meeting now.

01:45.640 --> 01:53.640
The May revision as you know to the governor's budget was made available last week. I'll include some more details under my president's report.

01:54.160 --> 02:04.800
I want to thank everyone who is here for wearing their masks and being safe. We are in the middle of a little surge and so we really appreciate everyone's consideration there.

02:05.320 --> 02:14.560
There is a handout on the table in the lobby identifying the proposed items on the consent calendars the proposed waiver consent items are W 1 through 10.

02:15.160 --> 02:27.040
The proposed regular consent items are items 5 through 11. We will take up the waiver consent items just after our lunch break and the regular consent items later this afternoon after item 4.

02:28.040 --> 02:38.160
We will reopen item 1 SBE priorities later this afternoon to take action on the March 2022 minutes and take up the state board liaison reports.

02:39.160 --> 02:47.240
Members of the public who wish to phone in for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

02:47.760 --> 03:00.080
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number entering a participant access code and then following each of the operators prompts upon dialing in callers will be added to a caller queue.

03:00.680 --> 03:13.360
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

03:14.040 --> 03:21.040
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment in person should sign in using the binder at the table just outside the room.

03:21.560 --> 03:30.120
The binder is on the table with separate pages for each item number. This will help ensure that staff is able to track the in person speakers for a particular item.

03:30.720 --> 03:46.440
Public comment by phone or in person will be limited to one minute for each speaker. Item 12 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on any member matters that are not specifically listed on this meeting's board agenda.

03:47.440 --> 03:51.480
And item one is our state board projects and priorities item.

03:52.520 --> 03:59.960
I will give my report and then following that state superintendent Thurman will be here to give his.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.400
So here we are.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.120
May

04:04.120 --> 04:16.840
May is a happy time in education, not just because summer break is around the corner, but it's also when we celebrate the accomplishments of the year and there's much to celebrate.

04:17.440 --> 04:26.760
May kicked off California Teacher Appreciation Week and I would like to express my sincere gratitude for all the educators out there.

04:27.040 --> 04:34.440
Of course, a week is not enough time to fully appreciate teachers who should be recognized every week of the year for the important work that they do every day.

04:35.040 --> 04:44.560
Teachers are the profession on which all other professions depend and so we want to acknowledge and encourage our teachers to recharge and renew.

04:45.080 --> 04:54.760
In the weeks to follow this week is classified school employees appreciation week another joyful moment and should be celebrated year round and I want to give.

04:55.160 --> 05:03.120
A special shout out to all the people in our schools who make it possible for students to learn and grow in so many ways, thank you for all that you do.

05:03.800 --> 05:13.440
Over the next several weeks we'll see our wonderful senior students don robes and caps for graduation ceremonies so congratulations to the class of 2022.

05:14.360 --> 05:25.920
In future years when people discuss the character traits necessary for a good happy life traits like perseverance determination persistence resilience, they will point to this class.

05:26.440 --> 05:36.080
As a primary example of young people pushing through adversity to reach a goal, all of our grads are special and I want to wish good fortune to our student board member.

05:36.560 --> 05:47.360
Rana is taking her international baccalaureate exam this morning, and she will be with us to celebrate this afternoon and i'm sure she's going to feel like celebrating after that is over.

05:47.920 --> 05:57.280
Six California seniors were recognized by US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona last week among the 58th class of the US presidential scholars.

05:57.840 --> 06:03.520
These young people are recognized by the White House Commission on presidential scholars for their accomplishments and academics.

06:03.840 --> 06:16.440
The arts career technical fields and their demonstrated commitment to community service and leadership, the California scholars include reverse reverse Java who attends mission San Jose high school in Fremont.

06:17.200 --> 06:27.040
me a su Gino lock nada high school in locking out of Flintridge Catherine's bivouacos key at Menlo Atherton high school.

06:27.800 --> 06:36.840
In Atherton entered she at Palos Verdes Peninsula high school in rolling hills estates Vivian he at Palos Verdes Peninsula high school.

06:37.200 --> 06:47.840
In rolling hills estates and Madeline Elaine case, who is that viewpoint school in Calabasas congratulations we're very proud to have these great teens representing our state.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.520
And last month on earth day.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.280
Secretary cardona also recognized for California schools and a school district as recipients of the US Department of Education green ribbon school honors.

07:01.760 --> 07:11.240
And these schools are recognized for their work on sustainability healthy and safe school environments and hands on learning experiences that connect students to the world around them.

07:12.120 --> 07:20.680
To the world around them and we're making a lot of progress, as you know, in the state on green schools and we expect to make a lot more progress.

07:21.280 --> 07:32.960
We want to congratulate could tell a high school in Anaheim Swiss and Valley K eight school in Fairfield St Martin of tours Academy and La Mesa and Altamont Creek elementary school in livermore.

07:33.320 --> 07:39.280
Plus the merced union high school district in at water, which was honored as a district sustainability awardee.

07:40.280 --> 07:46.280
Continuing the good news governor news from relief to release his may budget revision on Friday.

07:46.840 --> 07:59.080
As a result of expanding state revenues California's projected budget surplus is nearly $100 billion more than the entire budget of every other state in the country, except New York and Texas.

07:59.920 --> 08:21.520
So new governor Newsom's provide revised proposal does make a significant additional investments in education provides unprecedented levels of investment in our schools, we at one time, we're one of the lowest spending states in the nation, and we are now well above the national average and continuing to move in the right direction.

08:21.600 --> 08:38.800
The governor's budget plan includes the highest level per pupil funding in our state's history strategies to stabilize and support schools in terms of attendance as they recover from the challenges of coven 19 funds to accelerate local efforts necessary to support those most affected by the pandemic.

08:39.360 --> 08:48.160
Adding more student learning time to the school day funding improvements for school and children nutrition expanding pre kindergarten programs.

08:48.160 --> 09:02.000
And moving forward, of course, on plans for universal TK the may revise includes ongoing and expanded investments to address the teacher shortage and the school counselor shortage, as well as initiatives to expand the pipeline for TK teachers.

09:02.800 --> 09:09.440
Our additional funds for further expanding the number of resource rich community schools, which we will hear about later today.

09:10.000 --> 09:24.560
We're all very excited for that item. We will be voting to approve the initial grantees for the planning grants, the implementation grants of whom there are more than we had anticipated and the new technical assistance center the enthusiasm from the field is palpable, and I really want to say the hard work of the state department of education staff to accomplish this has been extraordinary, some of them are with us right now, and we'll hear from them shortly.

09:24.560 --> 09:36.400
These are the right investments at the right time and they're crucial to implementation of the California for all kids plan, which is designed to empower families and parents with more options and more services.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.920
And to address inequities in educational opportunities and outcomes.

09:39.920 --> 09:54.480
We look forward to the legislature passing a final budget in June that prioritizes students and families in other important news on Monday, the 60 day field review period for the revised draft of the mathematics framework closed.

09:54.480 --> 10:09.040
I would like to thank everyone who took the time to send in comments and suggestions and thoughts CDE fielded more than 300 comments, many of them quite meaty and offering dozens and dozens of suggestions for line edits and other changes.

10:09.040 --> 10:17.440
With a 900 page document, it's not unusual to get hundreds of pages of requested edits and we will take them very seriously.

10:17.440 --> 10:24.320
The work now with CDA staff is to review, organize and evaluate the comments to develop a plan for revision.

10:24.320 --> 10:38.880
Once we have an understanding of the scope of the proposed changes, we will need to make a determination about when the framework is likely to come before the end of the year, and we will take that very seriously.

10:38.880 --> 10:52.880
I would like to thank everyone who took the time to send in comments and suggestions and thoughts CDE fielded more than 300 comments, many of them quite meaty and offering dozens and dozens of suggestions for line edits and other changes.

10:52.880 --> 11:02.000
I look forward to digging into the comments and understanding the insights from those who have taken the time to participate.

11:02.000 --> 11:08.240
That's exactly what the process is for, giving the public a voice and an opportunity to be heard.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.360
This is an important opportunity for the state and it's important that we get this framework right.

11:13.360 --> 11:22.320
The United States has declined for many years in its mathematics performance on PISA, which is the international assessment ranking well below the international average.

11:22.480 --> 11:29.520
And California has improved its standing in the last few years, but we still rank below the national average in the United States.

11:29.520 --> 11:41.200
The United States has been plagued by math teacher shortages for about a half a century, and many states and districts have struggled to find a curriculum approach that makes math come alive and become meaningful for most students,

11:41.200 --> 11:47.680
while encouraging and enabling a substantial number of students to be well prepared to enter STEM fields.

11:47.680 --> 11:57.840
This is especially critical in our state where we need to grow a diverse and highly capable STEM workforce, a workforce that is vital to the future of the state.

11:57.840 --> 12:07.120
So this framework process, while it will continue to take considerable time and effort, comes at an important moment when the first common core line framework,

12:07.120 --> 12:14.880
there was an immediate need to push out guidance to the field because the standards were so new and different teachers needed help in adjusting instruction.

12:14.880 --> 12:23.360
And while the speed of the effort was appreciated, we also heard from the field that the 2013 framework wasn't as helpful as some had hoped.

12:23.360 --> 12:28.400
And now we have the benefit of teachers who have been working with these standards for more than a decade.

12:28.400 --> 12:39.600
Many know and understand the standards well, and it gives us an opportunity to really dig into the best practices of the past 12 years and the years of data around common core aligned instruction.

12:39.680 --> 12:53.840
We will take the time needed to do the work well to ensure quality and opportunity, excellence and equity in mathematics instruction to give every student the opportunity to love mathematics and to excel in it.

12:53.840 --> 13:02.280
Finally, on a cautionary note, I do want to urge all of us to remain vigilant in our efforts to contain the spread of covid, which is still with us.

13:02.280 --> 13:15.200
Unfortunately, that covid case rates are up, rising with the B.A. to variant reported covid 19 cases among children number 93,511 in the U.S.

13:15.200 --> 13:20.600
last week, up more than 50 percent from the previous week in California.

13:20.600 --> 13:30.560
Our overall case rates have increased by nearly 400 percent since the beginning of April, from about 100 on average per day to nearly 400 per day.

13:30.560 --> 13:36.920
Hospitalizations are going up here and nationally, and death rates are following and beginning to rise once again.

13:36.920 --> 13:47.200
I have personally lost two family members to covid, and I know across our state, many families have been affected disproportionately in the African-American, Pacific Islander and Latin X communities.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.040
But all communities have felt this pain.

13:50.040 --> 13:56.880
Fear's board of these experiences have kept many students, including a disproportionate number of students with disabilities, out of school.

13:56.880 --> 14:04.000
And I know that families and educators are struggling to enact and sustain mitigation strategies at home and at school.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.720
This is a time when we need to double down on safety, especially as large events are occurring at the end of the school year, proms and graduation ceremonies and the like.

14:12.720 --> 14:20.840
There was an article in the newspaper recently about proms as a super spreader, a super spreader events in a couple of districts.

14:20.840 --> 14:31.240
I attended my son's graduation from UC Berkeley School of Public Policy on Monday, and I was thrilled that the hundreds of people in attendance, every single person was masked and cheering.

14:31.240 --> 14:36.720
And I thank everyone who is here for showing their concern for their own safety and that of others by wearing a mask.

14:36.760 --> 14:45.560
We'll need to watch the indicators and continue to focus on the mitigation strategies we know work, including continuing to encourage vaccinations across California.

14:45.560 --> 14:50.440
Only 36 percent of children ages five through 11 have completed the vaccine.

14:50.440 --> 15:00.360
And of all of us need to be aware of boosters so we can continue California's track record of saving lives relative to other large states and keeping children and adults safe.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.160
And there are so many boosters. I'm up to number four.

15:03.160 --> 15:06.280
I don't know how many keeping track.

15:06.280 --> 15:16.680
I'm happy that our colleagues in public health are working to address these issues by centering on equity, by prioritizing high need schools and state funded vaccine and testing programs.

15:16.680 --> 15:23.600
And on that note of cautious optimism, I'd like to pass the mic to State Superintendent Tony Thurman.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.800
Tony, it's great to see you.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.720
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

15:28.720 --> 15:35.080
Good morning to you and to the members of the board and to all who are here today in person for this meeting.

15:35.080 --> 15:46.720
It's great to be with you in person and to bring you greetings on behalf of all of the staff at the California Department of Education and on behalf of our students and our schools.

15:46.720 --> 15:52.840
As you provided your report, President Darling-Hammond, I thought about what this school year has been like.

15:52.840 --> 16:03.120
And I'm grateful to the 50 to 60 schools that have invited me and given me the opportunity to visit them as this school year began and it has school reopened.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.560
And I have to acknowledge Dr. Escobedo.

16:07.560 --> 16:19.680
I believe your district at the time when you were still leading Chula Vista was the very first school district that I visited in July, one of our earlier opening districts.

16:19.680 --> 16:33.040
And I can say that what I saw there and I've seen throughout that in spite of all the challenges that our nation in our world is experiencing, students continue to learn and they continue to thrive.

16:33.040 --> 16:42.000
There's no doubt that we have in this experience in these last two years experienced what I think are the toughest moments that we'll experience in our lifetime.

16:42.000 --> 16:52.600
And there's no doubt that there have been a spotlight has been put on the inequities that have existed in the educational system for a very long time.

16:52.600 --> 16:57.600
But we are resilient people and our students have demonstrated incredible resilience.

16:57.600 --> 17:04.360
Our educators have demonstrated ingenuity and creativity in the face of very difficult circumstances.

17:04.360 --> 17:13.640
Our families have been persistent and have juggled to be co-partners in education and caring for their kids and balancing work needs.

17:13.640 --> 17:26.960
And the state of California has put forward, I think, perhaps the greatest plan that we've ever seen as it relates to providing the kinds of resources that will allow California schools that I believe to first heal from the trauma of the pandemic,

17:26.960 --> 17:33.320
to make academic recovery and then to thrive as we prepare our students for tomorrow.

17:33.320 --> 17:41.920
We certainly have a lot of work to do, but California is well poised to build something better than what we had before.

17:41.920 --> 17:48.080
I do want to acknowledge the tragic events of the last week.

17:48.080 --> 17:55.080
You know, the continuing acts of hate that we've seen play out against the black community and places like Buffalo,

17:55.080 --> 18:04.440
the tragic events that we've seen here in California, you know, shootings in churches, you know, that we continue to see acts of hate that take place.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.800
And they're not all in California.

18:05.800 --> 18:16.880
Many are many of these acts of hate that we see happen in places outside of our state, but they do have an impact on our students in California.

18:16.880 --> 18:29.840
I'm grateful that on yesterday I had the opportunity to spend time with a great organization called Gender Nation that has provided gender affirming books for LGBTQ plus students.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.240
And it was a wonderful celebration.

18:32.240 --> 18:45.560
And I'm mindful that California students are experiencing higher rates of depression because of the kinds of statements being made in other states against our LGBTQ plus students and our trans students,

18:45.560 --> 18:51.680
that black students are experiencing depression in higher rates, that all students have experienced depression in higher rates.

18:51.680 --> 18:57.880
I can think of nothing more important than making sure we address the social emotional needs of our students.

18:57.880 --> 19:07.080
And so I'm grateful for today's presentation on community schools and what that three billion dollar investment means in the new proposed investment for community schools.

19:07.080 --> 19:19.320
We've had a great partnership with the state board staff and our board liaisons, Dr. Darlingham and Dr. Escobedo, working hand in hand on how to really steer this incredible initiative.

19:19.320 --> 19:24.600
And I'll say that I'll save the details for the presentation that will be coming up shortly.

19:24.600 --> 19:35.880
But this has to be our focus, supporting the social emotional needs of our students, giving our students the tools that they need to heal, giving them the tools that they need to make their academic recovery.

19:35.880 --> 19:52.160
Clearly, the state budget last year and the proposed budget this year make significant investments in professional development opportunities, expanded learning opportunities and so many other things that we think will help our students.

19:52.160 --> 20:02.740
And not to mention that last year's budget does provide for us more resources to address hate directly, because we know that education is a tool in addressing hate.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.120
Education can help to end hate.

20:05.120 --> 20:14.480
Sadly, many young people become co-opted by things that they hear and they are they find themselves making terrible, terrible choices.

20:14.480 --> 20:25.280
And I'm grateful that our state is implementing a 10 million dollar anti bias training program for educators in our state and that we continue to use education to end hate.

20:25.280 --> 20:29.160
Our students are thriving in spite of these challenges.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.760
They're doing what young people do.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.380
They're graduating.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.920
They're going to proms.

20:33.920 --> 20:35.960
They're making connections in the community.

20:35.960 --> 20:38.080
They're preparing for summer jobs.

20:38.080 --> 20:46.000
And we find ourselves continuing to do the important work of supporting our students and our educators and our families.

20:46.000 --> 20:51.820
Unfortunately, we have to do that still where we deal with issues like fire and and natural disaster.

20:51.820 --> 20:59.880
And I had the opportunity to visit those who were impacted by the fires in the gun and a girl on last week.

20:59.880 --> 21:09.120
And I want to give a big shout out to those who are working with our students and come up with some of the most creative ways to support our students.

21:09.120 --> 21:17.700
Well, while some students were not able to attend school, school was open every day for the students impacted by the fire.

21:17.700 --> 21:29.680
And I want to thank the folks at Wood Canyon Elementary in the Capistrano Unified School District for their work to support a relocation of these students so that students could have access to school every day.

21:29.940 --> 21:38.440
And I want to thank the emergency team at the California Department of Education and the Office of Emergency Services for working with our families.

21:38.440 --> 21:45.720
And it was an honor to visit and to be able to offer the family support who need relocation assistance,

21:45.720 --> 21:51.520
housing assistance, food, water and other supports that we were able to provide.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.640
Unfortunately, this is our new reality.

21:54.720 --> 22:00.520
If you think about it, last year, at least 20 of our counties experienced fire or a natural disaster.

22:00.520 --> 22:11.600
And so we've got to continue to address the impacts of climate change and to assist our families, our school families with preparedness for these opportunities.

22:11.600 --> 22:16.680
I think our state budget does a great deal to prepare our students for many of the things that they need.

22:16.680 --> 22:28.000
And I want to note that the midyear budget continues to place a great emphasis on recruitment of teachers and educators and a focus on more counselors.

22:28.000 --> 22:38.760
And many of you have heard us talk about a bill that we've been working on this year with Senator McGuire, SB 1229, that we think helps us recruit 10,000 more counselors.

22:38.760 --> 22:56.960
And I am grateful to the governor and to the state board staff and team for their work to to steer a proposal that would create an opportunity to provide grants for educators, future educators and for future counselors.

22:56.960 --> 23:09.440
And so we're grateful to see that in this proposed budget, as well as the four hundred million dollars in funding to support literacy strategies and and multilingual literacy strategies.

23:09.440 --> 23:17.680
We think that it's critical to as we bounce back from this moment, focus on building skill for our students.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.280
And we know that reading is a gateway skill.

23:20.280 --> 23:23.800
And when students learn to read, they can read to learn anything.

23:23.840 --> 23:40.480
And so I want to thank our state board president for her partnership and our task force on reading by third grade and the members of the state board staff and board members who have participated as we continue to make sure that our children learn to read by the year 2026.

23:40.480 --> 23:48.200
There are a number of initiatives and bills that we are sponsoring and supporting that we think will help to get us there.

23:48.200 --> 24:04.320
But nothing I can think of more important than the investment that is in the proposed budget of literacy coaches and specialists and programs to support multilingual learners and to support our school libraries to have the resources that they need to move forward.

24:04.320 --> 24:07.440
So we're excited about this budget as Dr.

24:07.440 --> 24:13.760
Darlingham and noted with these record surplus that is available.

24:13.760 --> 24:24.160
This budget proposes one hundred and twenty eight billion dollars for education and provides important resources, incredible resources.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.040
We know that our schools are asking for help.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.680
I think they're excited by this budget.

24:27.720 --> 24:35.480
They're incited by the increase in funding in the base that helps them continue to address the rising cost of education.

24:35.480 --> 24:39.240
I'm certain that they are excited about the discretionary block grant.

24:39.240 --> 24:45.560
I think that is an amazing provision that is available to support California schools.

24:45.560 --> 24:51.240
But we know that top of mind for our schools are things like offsetting declining enrollment.

24:51.280 --> 24:59.560
We've seen the decline in population over the years and schools have felt that and that decline has been exacerbated by the pandemic.

24:59.560 --> 25:03.960
So we have a lot of work to do addressing chronic absenteeism.

25:03.960 --> 25:10.720
You know, it was pointed out to me that there is an increase in chronic absenteeism for kindergarten students.

25:10.720 --> 25:21.360
And so we know that we have to center our work to address chronic absenteeism and of course, what we do to recruit and retain staff.

25:21.360 --> 25:37.680
Thanks to all of you who participated in our work on the task force on reading by third grade and for all of you who participated in our task force on promoting black student achievement so that we support our students who have been impacted in the deepest ways by the opportunity gap.

25:37.680 --> 25:42.760
We can provide a better opportunity for all of our students to remove barriers.

25:42.760 --> 25:56.600
And as I close, I'd like to call your attention to the slide that is in front of you that highlights just a handful of the resources that California is marshaling and moving forward to help our schools build this system, build something better than what we had before.

25:56.600 --> 26:12.320
And as I would say, transform California schools, as you can see, it centers around universal meals, being able to provide meals to every hungry child, regardless of their of their background, two meals a day, universal preschool.

26:12.320 --> 26:21.440
I'm certain that all of you like me, we've been talking about universal preschool for decades that California can make that a reality is just incredible.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.800
And a big shout out to the staff at the Department of Education who are working to help implement that.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.880
You'll hear more about community schools.

26:28.880 --> 26:36.000
These are more than just wraparound supports, but we need those wraparound supports and health and mental health and social services.

26:36.000 --> 26:50.120
And of course, what I would call transformative supports to help change school climate, to help us reduce suspensions, to help us end the school to prison pipeline so that we are educating, not incarcerating California kids.

26:50.120 --> 26:58.680
Professional development, more than one point two billion dollars in the Educator Effectiveness Grant, the anti bias grants that are referenced.

26:58.680 --> 27:06.880
The governor talked has created a mental health strategy over four billion dollars.

27:06.880 --> 27:15.440
That means that there's no wrong door to go through in accessing mental health at a time when we have the greatest needs, whether that's in your school or in your community.

27:15.480 --> 27:21.240
And of course, expanded learning opportunities because school is more than just what happens during the school hours.

27:21.240 --> 27:31.040
It programs before school and after school and during the summer that all told and all combined help us to build learning opportunities for California's kids.

27:31.040 --> 27:36.040
All of these together, we think are going to be part of the strategy to help our schools build back better.

27:36.040 --> 27:40.360
As Dr. Darling Hammond said, we must be mindful of the health challenges.

27:40.560 --> 27:47.360
We provided five billion rapid covid tests to California schools, and we've got to be mindful about health and safety as we go forward.

27:47.360 --> 27:54.400
But I'm grateful that California is leading with resources such as these to help us transform California schools and to build through,

27:54.400 --> 28:00.280
build back better and build beyond the challenges that all schools in our nation face.

28:00.280 --> 28:07.440
Madam President, this concludes my report and I submit myself to be available for any questions from you or members of the board.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.560
Thank you so much.

28:10.560 --> 28:18.320
We're going to move right along with item two, which is the California Community Schools Partnership Program,

28:18.320 --> 28:26.760
approval of cohort one, the planning and implementation grantees and the approval of the lead technical assistance center contract awardee.

28:26.760 --> 28:37.760
I suggested earlier that this has been at a rapid pace for a state agency to lift up, conceptualize and move forward a program like this.

28:37.760 --> 28:44.400
And we're very pleased that there will be resources reaching schools as early as this summer.

28:44.400 --> 28:52.320
The item has three recommendations for our approval, the approval of the round one planning grant awards,

28:52.320 --> 29:02.200
the approval of the implementation grant awards and then a third recommendation on the lead technical assistance center contract.

29:02.200 --> 29:11.440
It's a very important piece of the infrastructure moving forward that we have the technical assistance center.

29:11.440 --> 29:15.560
And again, thanks to the team for working so tirelessly to make it happen.

29:15.560 --> 29:24.640
The item will be presented by Superintendent Thurmond in addition to Steve Zimmer and Pete Callis and Brooklyn Williams of the State Department.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.600
Superintendent, please begin.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.520
Thank you, Madam President. We're excited to present this item today for board approval.

29:31.520 --> 29:43.480
In short, we will be talking about the recommendations for for planning grants, implementation grants and technical assistance, a technical assistance lead.

29:43.520 --> 29:49.040
Grateful to the staff at the Department of Education and the staff at the state board for the work on this.

29:49.040 --> 29:53.240
There has been outstanding cooperation and participation.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.760
There's been a high level of community participation.

29:56.760 --> 30:05.440
We've had conversations with districts and charter schools about what community schools means to help California schools in this moment.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.960
You'll hear from a number of our staff.

30:07.960 --> 30:14.600
First and foremost, Steve Zimmer, who has been working on the community school strategy pretty much since the beginning.

30:14.600 --> 30:20.080
He's formally come on board at the California Department of Education as one of our deputy superintendents.

30:20.080 --> 30:30.440
You'll also hear from Brooklyn Williams, who is a senior advisor here at the Department of Education and who has worked on community schools extensively in the community and the field.

30:30.440 --> 30:41.280
I would also acknowledge Abel Guian, who you all may hear from today, who has joined us as a deputy superintendent of operations and administration branch.

30:41.280 --> 30:47.160
Mr. Guian has been working on a number of programs to help the physical development of our schools.

30:47.160 --> 30:55.320
And I would note that, among other things, in the course of his career, he's helped to generate two billion dollars for school maintenance and construction,

30:55.360 --> 31:03.800
something that is also featured in this proposed budget and something of great interest to many of our schools.

31:03.800 --> 31:16.040
And so with that framing, I'll turn it over with the deputy superintendent, Steve Zimmer, to take us into the presentation.

31:16.040 --> 31:27.440
Members of the board, it is a true honor to share our progress towards actualizing the promise of community schools in California.

31:27.440 --> 31:41.520
I first want to thank Superintendent Thurman for his justice driven vision to create the California Community Schools Partnership Program as a school transformation initiative throughout our state,

31:41.520 --> 31:49.920
beginning in communities that have suffered the consequences of health, economic and educational disparities.

31:49.920 --> 32:01.640
I also want to thank, sincerely thank, the board president, the executive director of the state board, and the whole of the SBE staff,

32:01.640 --> 32:10.600
especially Rigel and Jessica, for their seamless partnership throughout this process.

32:10.640 --> 32:14.560
We're getting to meet each other in person for the first time today.

32:14.560 --> 32:18.840
I heard there was some curiosity about what I actually looked like in person.

32:18.840 --> 32:24.800
I encourage everybody to manage their expectations.

32:24.800 --> 32:36.280
I also want to give a huge thanks to our CDE team, Deanna Niebuhr, Lisa Reimers, and Pete Callis, who you'll hear from later today.

32:36.320 --> 32:43.280
They, together with the SBE staff, have stayed up countless nights and worked endless weekends,

32:43.280 --> 32:50.560
really giving their heart and soul to get us to the finish line and to what I believe is the right finish line.

32:50.560 --> 32:53.480
And finally, I want to thank each of you.

32:53.480 --> 33:02.000
The support of the state board has allowed us to begin to actualize an historic moment for community schools.

33:02.040 --> 33:09.360
As a school transformation program under a bold and justice-driven framework, which you approved in January,

33:09.360 --> 33:16.560
we believe this holds game-changing possibilities for students, their families, and our schools across the state.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.040
Thank you. Thank each of you.

33:20.040 --> 33:25.600
Board members, we come to you today to ask for your confirmation of our recommendations

33:25.640 --> 33:31.120
for the initial round of the California Community Schools Partnership Program Planning Grants,

33:31.120 --> 33:38.240
Implementation Grants, and the Lead Technical Assistance Contract.

33:38.240 --> 33:46.280
Today, you'll hear from myself, our division director, Pete Callis, and later, Brooklyn Williams,

33:46.280 --> 33:51.720
who is a senior advisor to the superintendent.

33:51.760 --> 33:55.480
As division director Callis will outline in a few moments,

33:55.480 --> 34:03.360
we seek your approval to allocate close to $80 million to schools, LEAs, and amazing partnership

34:03.360 --> 34:10.000
that we are coming to you to recommend to lead the critical technical assistance design for our state.

34:10.000 --> 34:16.440
As we discussed in the January board meeting, the California Community Schools Partnership Program

34:16.440 --> 34:21.520
seeks to transform relationships that support learning,

34:21.520 --> 34:29.760
which will in turn transform outcomes for our students, their families, and entire school communities.

34:29.760 --> 34:37.560
Further, we understand that this transformational model is rooted in and guided by an equity mission

34:37.560 --> 34:45.280
that recognizes the students, families, and communities who have been most marginalized and oppressed

34:45.280 --> 34:51.800
by intentional disparities, both in and within our educational system,

34:51.800 --> 34:58.040
be the first engaged by this initiative that seeks to address those inequities.

34:58.040 --> 35:03.240
I'm from LA, so I know better than to give away our best line in the trailer,

35:03.240 --> 35:12.680
but know that we in CDE are deeply humbled by the equity-driven prioritization of schools and communities

35:12.680 --> 35:19.280
where the need is greatest and assets have not been elevated for far too long.

35:19.280 --> 35:24.120
In order to understand the depth and reach of this moment, we'll look back at our process

35:24.120 --> 35:30.280
and the journey that we have been on since the legislature passed the California Community Schools Partnership Act

35:30.280 --> 35:36.720
and the resulting program was codified and funded as part of the Budget Act of 2021

35:36.720 --> 35:39.000
and the governor's budget of that same year.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.600
I will take us through a few slides that review this journey and then I'll hand it over to Pete Callis,

35:44.600 --> 35:50.560
who will discuss our RFA process and report our results.

35:50.560 --> 35:55.640
We're proud of these recommendations and hopeful that this board will concur

35:55.640 --> 36:02.440
and we are excited to move forward with the full launch of this program in the 2022-23 school year.

36:02.440 --> 36:07.480
These are the recommendations for SBE approval.

36:07.480 --> 36:12.480
CDE recommends that SBE approve the CCSP Round 1 planning grants.

36:12.480 --> 36:16.000
You have the attached list of approved applicants.

36:16.000 --> 36:22.240
CDE further recommends that the SBE confirm the CCSP Round 1 implementation grants.

36:22.240 --> 36:32.120
You also have the list of approved applicants and I'm proud to say the long list of individual school sites recommended for funding.

36:32.120 --> 36:38.920
In approving this implementation grant recommendation, CDE requests SBE authorize CDE to fund

36:38.920 --> 36:48.240
first round implementation grants to meet the statutory priority of funding schools with over 80% unduplicated students enrolled.

36:48.240 --> 36:59.040
And finally, CDE recommends that the SBE confirm CDE's lead technical assistance center contract award recommendation.

36:59.040 --> 37:11.280
A bit of an overview, in 2021, the legislature allocated over $3 billion for the CCSPP to establish new and expand existing community schools

37:11.280 --> 37:15.720
through the school year of ending in June 2028.

37:15.720 --> 37:21.760
It includes grants to LEAs and technical assistance centers.

37:21.760 --> 37:30.200
The CCSP requires the state board to approve an administration plan and application process for the program, which happened in November.

37:30.200 --> 37:36.880
All LEA grantees and technical assistance program and awardees and receive annual updates from the CDE.

37:36.880 --> 37:40.160
We're doing the second of that today.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.600
Reminder planning grants.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.600
This was 10% of the overall funding.

37:43.600 --> 37:48.520
There are two rounds, the first of which we will present for approval today.

37:48.520 --> 37:57.200
These will be for the 2021, 21, 22, 23 program year.

37:57.200 --> 38:09.040
These funds can be spent over a two year grant period, but LEAs only receive one time grant of $200,000 per qualifying LEA.

38:09.040 --> 38:16.000
And the planning grants must go to LEAs with no existing community schools.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.280
We have implementation grants.

38:17.320 --> 38:21.120
The process is up to 70% of the total funding, over $2 billion.

38:21.120 --> 38:28.680
There are multiple rounds going through 21, 22, through the 27, 28 program year.

38:28.680 --> 38:35.960
It is a five year grant period with annual grants up to $500,000 per school site.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.720
People go through this with you.

38:38.720 --> 38:46.520
LEAs, I'm sorry, implementation grants are for LEAs with existing community schools.

38:46.520 --> 38:55.640
Technical assistance centers were also allocated for funds for contracts with LEAs to create statute,

38:55.640 --> 39:01.560
instruct us to create a minimum of five regional technical assistance centers.

39:01.560 --> 39:12.400
In October, we provided this board with an informational memorandum with an introduction to our community schools model and an overview of the CCSPP.

39:12.400 --> 39:21.680
Then in November of 2021, the board approved the CCSPP proposed application process and administrative plan.

39:21.680 --> 39:24.120
Thank you again for that.

39:24.120 --> 39:36.720
Then in January of 2022, the board adapted the framework as the guiding document for the implementation of the CCSPP,

39:36.720 --> 39:48.760
approved also an amendment to our application and administration plan to establish a lead tech in the lead technical assistance center in the winter of 22

39:48.760 --> 39:56.640
and an RFA for regional technical assistance centers later in this calendar year.

39:56.680 --> 40:02.680
I do want to spend a moment talking again about the framework,

40:02.680 --> 40:08.880
which has been really received in the field and community as a guiding document.

40:08.880 --> 40:14.600
And thank you again for your embrace and support of this framework.

40:14.600 --> 40:25.800
The framework expanded what is the nationally accepted four pillars of community schools to include four key conditions for learning,

40:25.800 --> 40:31.280
four key cornerstone commitments, four key proven practices and four key roles.

40:31.280 --> 40:43.160
And I want to, particularly in light of the superintendent's powerful invocation of recent events in his introduction,

40:43.160 --> 40:51.640
I want to remind us of the four cornerstone commitments which you so embraced and approved in January.

40:51.640 --> 40:59.280
A commitment to an assets driven and strength based practice in our community schools,

40:59.280 --> 41:06.840
a commitment to racially just and restorative school climates in our community schools,

41:06.840 --> 41:14.520
a commitment to powerful, culturally proficient and relevant instruction in our community schools,

41:14.560 --> 41:21.960
and a commitment to shared decision making and participatory practices in our community schools.

41:21.960 --> 41:27.880
I thank you again for approving this guiding document for the field.

41:27.880 --> 41:35.480
We engaged in and shared with you both in November and January now share again.

41:35.480 --> 41:45.520
We engaged with extensive outreach that really informed both the framework and guided our entire RFA process.

41:45.520 --> 41:50.640
There were regional forums held in November and December throughout the state.

41:50.640 --> 41:57.880
Over 500 interest holders, students, families, school staff and community members attended the sessions.

41:57.920 --> 42:05.640
Yes, they included presentations, but they mostly included opportunities for attendees to offer their vision and their priorities.

42:05.640 --> 42:13.520
And I must say their experiences, their stories, their testimonies.

42:13.520 --> 42:18.280
And this really informed our process at every stage.

42:18.280 --> 42:20.800
We also offered what we called office hours.

42:20.800 --> 42:27.160
They became really meetings over January, February, March.

42:27.200 --> 42:31.680
It was probably more than 12, but at least 12 meetings with interest holder groups.

42:31.680 --> 42:42.520
And we held five largely attended webinars, extensive information sessions that I still feel like I'm recovering from sometimes

42:42.520 --> 42:48.280
with potential applicants for each of the RFAs.

42:48.280 --> 43:00.280
I'm going to now turn it over to Division Director Pete Callis, who will take you through the each of the grant awards that we're going to ask for your support with today.

43:00.280 --> 43:16.760
And bringing Pete Callis up here, I just I just want to extend to Pete, his entire team, our great thanks for the work that they've done that they have done night and day to get this across the finish line.

43:16.760 --> 43:28.520
He. Madam President, as Mr. Callis comes, I would also like to acknowledge him for his work and the work of the entire division on the community schools work.

43:28.520 --> 43:36.320
And Madam President, with your approval, I will be stepping out and Chief Deputy Nicely will join us on the dais.

43:36.320 --> 43:42.880
I've also been summoned to give testimony in Senate Education Budget Subcommittee one.

43:42.880 --> 43:46.800
And one of the topics will be on community schools and what's in the budget.

43:46.800 --> 43:51.680
So if the chief deputy superintendent will take over for me. Thank you.

44:12.880 --> 44:32.440
All right. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and board members.

44:32.440 --> 44:41.520
The Career College Transition Division team developed a streamlined needs based application process for the planning grants and implementation grants.

44:41.560 --> 44:49.320
The reading scoring team adhered to a multi-section rubric as we went through the scoring process for both of the grant programs.

44:49.320 --> 44:56.600
The Planning Grant RFA was released on March 1st. We had two hundred and three complete applications submitted.

44:56.600 --> 45:01.560
The total funding request was just over forty one and a half million dollars.

45:01.560 --> 45:10.480
The breakdown of the LEA's for the two hundred and three applications, there were 100 school districts, fifteen county offices of education,

45:10.480 --> 45:14.280
eighty seven charter schools and one joint powers authority.

45:23.200 --> 45:31.760
The results of the round one planning grant reading and scoring process included one hundred and ninety two LEA's recommended for planning grant awards.

45:31.760 --> 45:38.600
The total of the funding for the planning grant awards was thirty eight million two hundred thousand one hundred and twenty two dollars.

45:38.600 --> 45:46.080
This leaves us just over two hundred and fifty nine million dollars for round two planning grant applications.

45:46.080 --> 45:53.280
CDE will distribute planning grant award notifications so that the grantees can begin their community school planning in the twenty two,

45:53.280 --> 45:57.000
twenty three school year right before July one.

45:57.000 --> 46:04.120
Applicants that were not recommended for planning grant funding did not meet the minimum qualification guidelines that are in statute.

46:04.440 --> 46:12.240
We will continue to provide funding for the planning grant awards for the twenty three school year right before July one.

46:12.240 --> 46:20.160
Moving on to the implementation grants again, we utilize a streamlined needs based application process.

46:20.160 --> 46:29.680
The implementation grant RFA was released on March 11th, ten days after the Planning Grant RFA, we received ninety complete applications.

46:29.720 --> 46:39.080
The total of the funding for the planning grant applications was fifty nine school districts, eleven county offices of education and twenty charter schools.

46:42.680 --> 46:48.600
For implementation grant allocations, they're all based on student need and school site enrollment.

46:48.600 --> 46:58.920
It was broken down into four categories, small districts, small LEA's up to four hundred students and then small to medium four hundred and one to a thousand students,

46:58.960 --> 47:02.600
medium to large one thousand and one to two thousand students.

47:02.600 --> 47:07.640
And then we had the large category of two thousand and one plus students.

47:12.600 --> 47:23.400
The results of the round one implementation grant reading and scoring process included seventy six LEA's in twenty nine of our fifty eight counties across the state were

47:23.440 --> 47:28.880
recommended for implementation grant award supporting four hundred and fifty eight individual school sites.

47:28.880 --> 47:39.480
The total of the fund for funding for implementation grant awards is six hundred and eleven million dollars, six hundred and eleven million eighty seven thousand five hundred dollars,

47:39.480 --> 47:44.240
which is about two hundred and eleven million more than what we were planning on.

47:44.960 --> 47:54.360
CD will distribute the implementation grant award notification so these LEA's can get started right away on their planning and implementation work going forward right at the beginning of the twenty two,

47:54.360 --> 48:01.720
twenty three school year applicants that were not recommended for an implementation grant did not meet the statutory priorities.

48:03.080 --> 48:11.080
The statutory priority we are referring to is the grant making priority for schools serving an unduplicated pupil count of eighty percent or higher.

48:11.440 --> 48:24.320
The department made the decision to adhere to the statutory priority in the implementation grant round one to ensure that we retain sufficient funds for all planning grantees to receive implementation grants as required by statute.

48:24.880 --> 48:33.920
To be clear, a denial in the initial round of funding does not mean that LEA's would never receive funding for schools serving fewer than eighty percent high need students.

48:34.440 --> 48:38.840
We encourage LEA's to apply in subsequent rounds for implementation grants.

48:39.240 --> 48:47.080
There is approximately one point four million one point four billion dollars remaining in the for future implementation grants.

48:54.920 --> 49:02.800
As Mr. Zimmer mentioned earlier, there was an amendment to the program administration plan with the addition of a lead technical assistance center.

49:02.800 --> 49:32.760
The lead technical assistance center responsibilities will include to build content and overarching methodology for technical assistance, build a developmental implementation to articulate community school implementation for all of our sites that receive implementation grants along with planning grants, facilitate community of practice among the regional technical assistance centers, which will have the RFA out for those later this year, coordinate and maximize areas of expertise.

49:33.080 --> 49:41.600
Among the regional technical assistance centers, there will be a subsequent RFA for the regional tax following here in twenty twenty two.

49:46.160 --> 49:59.240
So in contrast to the RFA process for planning implementation grants, the lead technical assistance center RFA was extremely rigorous with many questions that delved into each applicant's extensive expertise.

50:00.080 --> 50:07.400
And experience in supporting community schools and school improvement. The entire scoring rubric was included in the posted RFA.

50:07.960 --> 50:18.080
The department released the lead technical assistance center RFA on March 30th CDE received for highly competitive applications for the lead tech.

50:19.040 --> 50:27.920
Total funding for the lead technical assistance center is twenty four million dollars over six years. The application submitted were from four county offices of education.

50:28.280 --> 50:36.720
The readers adhere to the posted rubric for the scoring of applications, which consisted of multiple sections and multiple prongs to each section.

50:37.560 --> 50:51.880
The department is very excited to announce the selection of Alameda County Office of Education as a lead technical assistance center for the California Community Schools Partnership Program grantees and the five regional technical assistance centers.

50:52.360 --> 51:01.800
They currently lead the Alameda County Community Exemplary Schools for School Success Consortium, which leverages the funding for the RFA.

51:01.840 --> 51:27.520
The department is very excited to announce the selection of the Alameda County Exemplary Schools for School Success Consortium, which leverages the 2020 CCSPP grant to serve nearly two thousand students at five high need schools this coupled with their demonstrated leadership and expanded learning and the statewide system of support positions them well to be up and running quickly to offer technical assistance to grantees alongside their outstanding partners.

51:28.000 --> 51:45.680
As you know, the statute gave priority to applicants for the technical assistance centers who partnered with Institutes of Higher Learning or nonprofit community based partners. Alameda County Office of Education's application included both the UCLA Center for Community Schooling.

51:46.680 --> 52:03.680
We'll co lead the effort with the Alameda County Office of Education. The center has over 15 years of experience supporting community schools and as a university initiative plays a unique role with their many community school partners offering stability, research capabilities, teaching and service activities.

52:03.960 --> 52:14.200
Their co leadership is a lead technical assistance center and ability to leverage their years of experience will help to inform the work of our planning and implementation grantees across the state.

52:16.680 --> 52:25.680
As the framework points out, there are a small number of proven practices that all California community schools should adopt and adapt to meet the needs of their schools.

52:26.680 --> 52:40.680
One of these is to align and integrate with education, justice and equity initiatives at the district and site level. So we're pleased that another partner organization for Alameda County Office of Education is Californians for Justice.

52:41.680 --> 52:50.680
Californians for Justice is a statewide grassroots organization with over 25 years of experience with building the power of youth and communities of color.

52:51.680 --> 53:00.680
The establishment of shared decision making structures, processes and protocols are essential to successful planning and implementation of community schools.

53:00.680 --> 53:11.680
So we're pleased to announce that Alameda County Office of Education has included the National Education Association as a partner with a decade of community school implementation nationwide.

53:12.680 --> 53:15.680
They're currently supporting over a thousand schools in 39 of our states.

53:16.680 --> 53:30.680
The department is excited to work with Alameda County Office of Education with assisting and offering technical assistance to both current and future CCSPP grantees on their journey into developing a highly successful community school system.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.680
Thank you and I'd like to pass the presentation back to Mr. Zimmer.

53:34.680 --> 53:50.680
Thank you so much, Pete. As I said before, we literally could not have done this without Pete and his division.

53:51.680 --> 53:59.680
These RFAs have been completed with expertise, commitment and care and we thank Pete and thank his division.

54:00.680 --> 54:07.680
Before I take us through next steps, board members, I would like to introduce the mayor's senior advisor, Brooklyn Williams.

54:08.680 --> 54:13.680
I came to know Brooklyn's work in the Bay Area, particularly around freedom schools.

54:14.680 --> 54:23.680
Brooklyn is going and thrilled that she's part of our team as the superintendent's senior advisor.

54:23.680 --> 54:29.680
She's going to share a little bit about her experience in implementing community schools.

54:39.680 --> 54:41.680
All right. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, board.

54:42.680 --> 54:45.680
Thank you for your service to the students, families and educators of California.

54:46.680 --> 54:50.680
My name is Brooklyn Williams and I am the new senior advisor to Superintendent Thurman.

54:51.680 --> 54:53.680
It is an honor to be with you this morning.

54:54.680 --> 55:03.680
I decided to join the California Department of Education because of my passion and belief in many of the initiatives Superintendent Thurman is focusing on.

55:04.680 --> 55:13.680
My lived experience working in schools over the last 25 years has taught me one of the most important of those initiatives is the advancement of community schools.

55:14.680 --> 55:20.680
Indeed, the community schools model is the glue that holds all school transformation strategies together.

55:21.680 --> 55:27.680
I helped build a community school from the ground up during my time working at a continuation school in Oakland during the early 2000s.

55:28.680 --> 55:31.680
At the time we didn't know we were building what became known as a community school.

55:32.680 --> 55:38.680
We were just trying to meet the needs of our students in order to keep them in school and on the path towards graduation.

55:38.680 --> 55:54.680
Our teachers, administrators and classified staff were trying to serve as social workers, case managers, housing navigators, mental health practitioners and a whole host of other roles that they didn't have the training or capacity to do consistently.

55:55.680 --> 56:06.680
We had recruited a talented team of teachers, but we could see that they were on the path to burnout while trying to play a multitude of roles for one of the most vulnerable student populations in our district.

56:06.680 --> 56:09.680
We needed reinforcements and we needed them badly.

56:11.680 --> 56:17.680
Meanwhile, our students often miss school to run around town trying to access important services.

56:18.680 --> 56:25.680
Many students were not able to access services due to transportation barriers or having family responsibilities and other competing responsibilities.

56:26.680 --> 56:39.680
For our students impacted by the criminal legal system, not attending counseling appointments or substance abuse prevention programs and other court ordered activities could mean violating their probation and returning to detention.

56:40.680 --> 56:45.680
We knew we had to do something to stop the unhealthy cycle of our staff and students that they were caught in.

56:46.680 --> 56:50.680
We started with engaging our students and launching a paid student leadership internship program.

56:51.680 --> 56:58.680
Our student leaders suggested we offer substance abuse intervention services on campus as well as conflict resolution.

56:59.680 --> 57:07.680
The student leaders learned de-escalation and peer mediation skills and we partnered with them to reduce conflicts and the potential for violence on and off our campus.

57:08.680 --> 57:20.680
After securing the first two services on campus, we went on to partner with community based organizations and public agencies who provided wellness services, case management, legal services and support for our gang impacted students.

57:21.680 --> 57:33.680
This was made much easier by the fact that our district launched a full service community school initiative and we were provided with the designated staff to help provide technical assistance and establish a coordinated services team.

57:34.680 --> 57:41.680
Due to our collaborative efforts, our school became a one stop shop for our students to get many of their needs met.

57:42.680 --> 57:50.680
As a result, we saw our attendance rates improve, our graduation rates go up, suspension rates go down and our staff turnover reduced.

57:51.680 --> 57:57.680
We transformed our school climate and culture by creating a school that focused on nurturing transformative relationships.

57:58.680 --> 58:06.680
School was no longer a transactional place where students came to try and earn their diploma in exchange for attending class and turning in assignments.

58:07.680 --> 58:10.680
But instead, school was a place where our students' whole humanity was seen.

58:11.680 --> 58:17.680
They felt safe and were able to heal and grow and most importantly learn.

58:18.680 --> 58:25.680
I experienced firsthand how community schools can literally save our students' lives and interrupt the school to prison pipeline.

58:26.680 --> 58:29.680
The saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child.

58:30.680 --> 58:39.680
Well, community schools embraces this truth and acknowledges that schools are the center of that village and we need to raise the whole child.

58:40.680 --> 58:52.680
I look forward to partnering with you, my CDE colleagues and districts throughout our state to advance community schools as we embark on this historic opportunity to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,

58:52.680 --> 59:01.680
systemic inequities, break unhealthy generational cycles and reimagine the future of learning for students and families in California.

59:02.680 --> 59:07.680
Thank you for allowing me the time to share my experience and I will now turn it back to Deputy Superintendent Steve Semer.

59:07.680 --> 59:24.680
Thank you so much, Brooklyn. Thank you for grounding us, for reminding us the potential and the power for what it means to transform relationships at a school site.

59:25.680 --> 59:28.680
It's not just about academic outcomes, as we know.

59:28.680 --> 59:40.680
And we thank you for the experience, the wisdom and the voices of our students and our families that you will continue to bring to us in this collaborative process.

59:41.680 --> 59:48.680
Board members, I want to take you through our next key steps as we move forward from today.

59:48.680 --> 59:54.680
And then myself and the team will be here to answer and address any questions that you might have.

59:55.680 --> 01:00:04.680
And I'm going to go through this and try not to be overwhelmed by what I'm going to share with you.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:27.680
After today's vote, our team will immediately turn our attention to the launching of our planning and implementation grant cohorts and ensuring that we have the technical assistance in place and to not only make sure that each awardee has a successful launch,

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:36.680
but their community school journey is supported at every step along the way to these transformed relationships and these transformed outcomes.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:50.680
So we are we are first going to, of course, you know, notify all of our officially notify all of our round one planning and implementation grant awardees.

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:59.680
We are going to execute contracts and distribute funds to the approved planning and planning and implementation grant awardees.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:08.680
We are going to convene webinars, which will serve as initial convenings for the planning and implementation grant cohorts.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:20.680
We will execute the contract for the lead technical assistance center awardee and build out the timeline for technical the technical assistance design.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:33.680
We will release the RFA for the regional technical assistance centers and complete that RFA competitive process on a timeline that allows for us to present recommended awardees to this board at your September meeting.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:45.680
And complete that RFA competitive process on a timeline that allows for us to present recommended awardees to this board at your September meeting.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:02:04.680
We will develop in consultation with the lead technical assistance center awardee and in collaboration with state board staff, an interim technical assistance strategy that will provide necessary guidance for successful program launch for our awardees.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:19.680
As well as building a bridge to the comprehensive technical assistance that will be developed by the lead technical assistance center and will be implemented through the regional technical assistance center design.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:26.680
All of these initial next steps will be completed or fully engaged by June 30.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:44.680
In addition, I want to share with you that we know as much as we are coming to you in some ways in celebration of this process, we know that we have a lot to learn.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:49.680
We know that we have a lot to reflect upon.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:59.680
And for those of us as Brooklyn, Brooklyn mentioned who have been doing community schools work way, way before we even knew that term.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.680
We know that we learn from every process.

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:13.680
We have to open our hearts and our minds to our own learning as we continue to develop.

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:29.680
And so we're going to dive deep and analyze the round one planning grant and implementation grant data to see what we have to celebrate and elevate, but also to identify community school deserts.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:45.680
What are the sections of our state where we did not receive applications and figure out how we are intentional about an outreach and engagement plan during the round two RFA processes.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:57.680
We, we know that we need to more deeply engage with our early childhood community.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:11.680
We, we know that we prioritize this for LEAs, but we know that there is an entire ecosystem in our early childhood community that extends well beyond LEAs.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:18.680
And we know that this is a place of growth and we know that this needs to be a place of focus as we move forward.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:31.680
We will also name and seat and launch the, the superintendent's statewide advisory board for the California Community Schools Partnership Program.

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:41.680
And we will name and seat and launch a, a youth council as well for, for the CCSPP.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:05:02.680
And last, we will, we will develop a comprehensive outreach plan for round two of the planning and implementation grants and connected to in your board packet, there should be a revised timeline, overall timeline for our program.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:23.680
I, I want to conclude again by thanking you, thanking the superintendent, the governor, the legislature, all the members of our, of our team and just to reference both the superintendent's opening remarks and the board president's opening remarks.

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.680
Our hearts are heavy this week.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:51.680
And we, we feel deeply pain and loss, both of the horrible incidents of violence and hate that were referenced, but also of the demarcation point of 1 million lives lost to COVID.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:59.680
And as the board president said, those of us who have lost folks personally in our family feel it very, very deeply.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:16.680
We also know that so many of our students, especially those in the schools that we are funding in this first round of implementation grants have felt the disproportional impacts of COVID devastating impacts.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:20.680
I don't think we fully have our heads wrapped around.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:38.680
We know in our hearts that this program is an important step towards the type of change in investment that will lead to not only healing, but transformation.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:49.680
We thank you for your consideration of these recommendations today. We thank you for your partnership. And I look forward to answering any and all questions that you have. Thank you. I'm present.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:07:00.680
Thank you very much. And we're going to ask for the public comment slide so we can queue up.

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:04.680
I think I have it on here. I'm a rookie.

01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.680
There we go.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.680
Thank you so much.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.680
And thanks for that wonderful presentation.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:20.680
Members of the public who wish to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:27.680
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask member Escobedo if he has any initial comments.

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:34.680
And then we will see if there are clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:44.680
Again, I want to commend, you know, CDE and SBE for just a Herculean effort in starting. We just started. It's a great beginning.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:50.680
You got to see the significant list and the planning as well as the implementation.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:56.680
I mean, the effects that we're going to have statewide is going to be incredible.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:07.680
And I hope we begin to also measure the incredible effects of this plan down the road because we have many challenges.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:15.680
We know about chronic absenteeism has, I believe, doubled in California and in many other states.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:19.680
I do believe we have, you know, how do we activate engagement?

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:29.680
How do we create that relevance, relevancy and connectiveness, you know, for our students in the schools that they go to is going to be very critical.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:37.680
And I know this this program, whether you're planning or implementing, is going to do that.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:54.680
And I look forward to the effects of this of this amazing opportunity for our state and amazing opportunity for our students and families and us to learn, you know,

01:08:54.680 --> 01:09:01.680
from from this whole grant process that will take in effect what the next eight years. Is that correct?

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:13.680
And again, what a great beginning, a real time for celebration and the timing as you could have been done last year, but the timing couldn't be better.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:18.680
I mean, couldn't be better. The need is there. Thank you.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:26.680
And I echo a member Escobedo's gratitude to the department. I think that there's a we're off to a very good start.

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:36.680
I'm gratified that the department intentionally streamlined the application for LEAs and weighted it towards the unique needs of each of the LEA student bodies.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:45.680
The legislature, the board, the department are aligned that this is an equity initiative and wherever LEAs are in their community schools implementation,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:52.680
they will be supported by robust technical assistance aligned to the community schools framework,

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:00.680
which is going to be a critical kind of linchpin in the process. I did want to ask one clarifying question.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.680
I want to see if there are any other clarifying questions from the board, then we'll go to public comments.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:18.680
So thank you very much, Steve. In terms of the regional technical assistance center process that will follow.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:24.680
Can you clarify when that is likely to come back to the to the board?

01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.680
It will. It will come back in September. Thank you very much for a recommendation.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:38.680
You are our expeditious process here. Are there any clarifying questions? If there are any discussion questions, we'll save those to later. Yes.

01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:47.680
Yes, thank you. It's a monumental process and very exciting for the whole state of California.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:57.680
One clarifying question is on the planning grants. If a I guess I could take up to two years with the planning phase.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:07.680
If if an LEA decides that it only takes one year, can they pull the trigger and apply for an implementation grant earlier in the process?

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:16.680
Absolutely. It's actually our anticipation that most will apply for the implementation grant after one year.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.680
It's it's just a two year window where they can spend spend that money. Thank you.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:30.680
Any other clarifying questions at this moment? I'm so used to looking on the Zoom screen for the little participant hands.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.680
They're like real hands going up. I don't know what to do with this.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:41.680
Member Rodriguez, then I'll come to member Roscoe Gonzalez and then I'll come around to the other side. Thank you.

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.680
So my my question is, will the dashboards at community schools be different?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:57.680
Will there be like different criteria that will be added, an indication when we look at that data of any changes?

01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.680
Well, that's a that's a great question. And it's not a question I have an answer to right right now.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:11.680
But I think it's something that that we do need to consider because as we spoke about both in in as it relates to community schools,

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.680
but also as it relates to some of our other key initiatives, social emotional learning, for example,

01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:27.680
looking at how we build in indicators into the dashboard is certainly something that I think that we need to prioritize and consider.

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:33.680
So I appreciate the question. I don't have an answer yet, but it's something that's certainly on our minds.

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:38.680
We'll find some way that there's some analytics that we can look at. I'm quite sure.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:42.680
I think the next person was member Roscoe Gonzalez.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.680
Did you also have your hand up?

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.680
You did. Yeah.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:54.680
OK, I just had a question about this is a great beginning also to activate engagement to reach students of diverse backgrounds.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:13:00.680
My question is, what is the plan for outreach the districts that qualify for the planning grant but didn't apply?

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:05.680
I heard you said that you had some things in process for that.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:24.680
You know, what I what I said and what I want to reiterate is we are concerned about that and we we need to we need to look deeper into why districts that qualified

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:30.680
LEAs that qualified did not participate in this process this spring.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:44.680
I can tell you anecdotally that we've heard from a lot of districts that said this was the hardest year that we've ever had and that we're we want to do this, but we just couldn't do one more thing this spring.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:49.680
And we want to kind of go through by kind of a more intentional process.

01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.680
So that's one of the things that we've heard.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:14:05.680
But I want to be cautious in kind of laying out a plan before we really look deep into, you know, kind of where those those deserts are where those gaps are.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:21.680
I think we may need to do we may need to have a very multifaceted outreach strategy because I think that the reasons why LEAs might not have applied in some parts of our state may be different than in other parts of the state.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:29.680
So we look forward to reporting back to you on that in September when we come with the Regional Technical Assistance Center grants.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:33.680
Thank you.

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680
Thank you.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:40.680
Member Lewis.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:46.680
Just back to the interim technical assistance that districts will be provided.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:15:00.680
Is that from would that be from Alameda County and does the two questions and does the June 30th deadline that you mentioned or timeframe for all of the assistance to be put in place?

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.680
Does that include the RFA for the regional techs?

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:14.680
It does. It does. We want to have that process launched before June 30th. That's our internal, you know, goal and timeline.

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:22.680
And I want just as I did with the previous question, we are going to gather ourselves after today's meeting.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:34.680
We know that there is going to be a gap in time between when we're going to have this contract executed, hopefully with the approval of the board today.

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:49.680
And that contract execution as I as I knew very well from my times in L.A. USD, but I've also learned in my few months here at CD, contract execution does not always match the school calendar.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.680
And so we know that we have we're going to have this gap period.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:22.680
And so what we intend to do is it's really to regather ourselves, our team, the state board staff team, also our partners from West Ed who have been providing technical assistance to the the initial grant that was that was offered in 2020 and develop a plan to to make sure that we have that baseline technical assistance in place to help with the the launching of both plans.

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:42.680
Of both planning grants and implementation grants. And as I said, I know this is kind of a general term, but the idea is to build a bridge to the comprehensive the comprehensive technical assistance to to address your question on the involvement of Alameda County.

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:49.680
I can't speak specifically to that as we're going as we're going to be executing a contract, hopefully after the approval today.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:17:03.680
But it's certainly my hope that that that that they would be involved, at least in a consult consultatory way, because we want whatever bridge we build to align with the technique, the comprehensive technical assistance they're going to be developing.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:05.680
I hope that begins to address the question.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:19.680
I do appreciate the the attention to that interim technical assistance before the regional support is on the ground because I know schools, everybody's excited about community schools and the value that they're going to bring.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:33.680
And I know if I'm at a school site and I've got a planning implementation grant I'm wanting to be off and running so I do appreciate the detail and the attention to providing that interim assistance until those regional techs are.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:39.680
Thank you. Thank you for remember this very much on our minds. Thank you.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:53.680
Right. I think we're going to, we have, I believe, one in person comment which we'll take first and then we'll go to public comment on the telephone line where we have quite a number of people lined up ready to call in, please.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:01.680
Make your way forward and back here.

01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:06.680
Make your way a little bit forward but not all the way to the front.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:13.680
And we encourage you to state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:20.680
No, I don't think the mic is turned up yet.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:25.680
Right. The first one through the tunnel always gets bloody Is that correct.

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.680
Good morning everybody. It's so nice to see you in person.

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.680
My name is Michael Juba, and I am a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers Association.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:51.680
CTA really does appreciate the impressive work that CD and SBE and helping to the state to arrive at this moment to help move nearly $3 billion investment from statute to reality has really been a tremendous undertaking to truly support this work.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:57.680
CTA believes that CD and SBE should limit the number of regional TACs to five.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:10.680
This is necessary to ensure the high quality TAs across the state, and to not dilute the funding and targeting approval for the July SBE meeting makes practical sense for them to be up and running in the fall.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:24.680
The RFA and the regional TACs must be explicit that all technical assistance must be grounded in the California Community Schools framework and specifically aligned with the four pillars in alignment with the lead TAC.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.680
Thank you for your time.

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:28.680
Thank you very much.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.680
And with that, I believe I can move to the line on the phone line.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.680
Is that right?

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.680
Yeah.

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:45.680
Okay, so for those who are calling in, we encourage you to please state your name and affiliation for the record.

I want to echo President Darling-Hammond,

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.680
and members Cabello's comments

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.680
about this being a Herculean effort accomplished by the state

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:41.680
to create in such a great amount of time

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.680
this transformative approach

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:46.680
known as the Community Schools Partnership Program.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.680
Our ask is for the State Board of Education

01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.680
and the State Board of Education

01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.680
and the State Board of Education

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.680
and the State Board of Education

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.680
and the State Board of Education

01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.680
and the State Board of Education

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.680
to produce development in the community schools partnership program.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:07.680
Our ask is for the State Board of Education

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.680
to provide clear accountability

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:11.680
and consistent technical assistance

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:13.680
strengthen this program.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:14.680
Thank you.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.680
Next caller, please state

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:18.680
your name and affiliation for the record.

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:25.680
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.600
My name is Rosario Hernandez and I am community liaison with True North Organizing Network

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.240
in Humboldt County and a member of the California Partnership for the Future Learning.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:37.400
The California Partnership is a statewide alliance of community organizing advocacy

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:42.080
groups led by Advancement Project California, Californians for Justice, Peco California

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.720
Education for Liberation and Advocates.

01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:48.320
With the support of community coalition, inner city struggle and over a dozen graduate research

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.960
and philanthropic partners, we center the voices leadership of black, indigenous and

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.120
brown students, families and communities of color across the state to advance a shared

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.160
vision of transformational, racially just, relationship centered community schools.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.920
The California Partnership supported families, students and educators to help this three

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.160
billion dollar community schools grant program.

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.920
We know that transformation happens when students, families, community and educators are authentic

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.920
partners.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.600
It takes all of us to create community schools.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.720
Today you'll be hearing from members of our network about how important this opportunity

01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:18.840
for school transformation is for us as students, families and community leaders.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:19.840
Thank you.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.300
Thank you.

Time starts now.

01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.440
Good morning.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.600
Erin Aftey with Public Advocates and the California Partnership for the Future of Learning.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:37.920
We'd like to thank CDE and the board for listening to youth, families and educators in the community

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.720
schools grant design and implementation.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:44.840
We see many of our community's recommendations reflected in the framework, grant RFAs and

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.400
the program's goals and requirements.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.960
We're also thrilled to see many of these provisions included and strengthened in the May revision

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:55.320
trailer bill, along with an additional one and a half billion dollar proposed investment

01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:00.200
to ensure that every eligible high need school in the state can become a racially just relationship

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.000
centered community school.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.480
We strongly believe that the state LEAs, schools and technical assistance centers must work

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.200
together to ensure that schools and districts authentically share power and decision making

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.880
with directly impacted students, families and educators and leverage the expertise of

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.880
their community partners in co-creating schools.

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:23.320
Doing so will transform our schools, close racialized achievement gaps and better serve

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:26.960
the social, emotional and behavioral health needs of our school communities.

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960
Thank you.

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:28.960
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.320
Good morning, everybody.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320
My name is Prida Romero.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:42.840
I am a youth organizer with ICUC in the eastern Cotilla Valley and a member of California

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.400
Partnership as well as part of the Pico California Education for Liberation.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:51.120
Community schools are transformative because they value and leverage the expertise of our

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.120
communities.

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.800
That is why we fully support the governor's proposed trailer bill language which restricts

01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.920
community school guarantees from using funds on committed disciplinary practices like police

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:04.040
and officers that harm students of color.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.760
We also advocate for mental health resources as kids navigate being reintegrated into in

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.880
person schooling and deal with unprecedented adversities.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:17.000
Transformation happens with students, families, communities and educators are authentic partners.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.600
It takes all of us to create rationally just relationship centered community schools.

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:25.960
We urge you to provide leadership to support districts and schools to live up to the framework

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:29.040
commitments and shared power and decision making.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:30.040
Thank you.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.040
Thank you.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.520
Good morning, board members.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:43.520
My name is Karn Tatang with California for Justice and the California Partnership for

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:44.520
the Future of Learning.

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.240
I want to thank you and the team at CDE for y'all's work on community schools and centering

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.200
the voices of students and families in the rollout of community schools.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:58.240
At CFJ and in the partnership, as we work towards this long-term vision of school transformation,

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:03.240
we believe that the people most impacted by an issue should be the ones creating the solutions

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.640
and the come to schools that means students and families.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:10.280
That's why it's so important that grantees have a plan to use an existing or create a

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.880
decision-making community school team that includes students, families, educators, and

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:16.880
community-based organizations.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:22.000
We're so excited to see that the governor agrees and included this in the proposed grant

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.760
priority criteria for future rounds of grants.

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:25.880
Thank y'all.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.880
Thank you.

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:27.880
Next caller.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.160
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.160
You have one minute.

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.160
Your time starts now.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:38.160
My name is Day Sun with the Advancement Project California and a member of the California

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160
Partnership.

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.280
We appreciate the SE and CDE's commitment to local transparency and accountability,

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.400
both integral to school transformation.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:50.280
LEAs should annually present their community schools plan, including data outcomes from

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:54.520
the prior year at the school and district level, such as the local advisory committees

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.120
and at school board meetings, to remain eligible for grant funding.

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.640
We're excited to see this annual public presentation included in the statute as a program requirement

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.160
and think it should apply to planning grant awardees.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.640
In LA Unified, we've seen the power of historically marginalized communities engaging the district

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.360
to ensure equity for $700 million allocated by the Student Equity Needs Index.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.920
When students and families are brought to the table with access to information around

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:23.480
dollars, actions, plans, and other key decisions facing schools, they can better dialogue and

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.520
share their expertise around the needed steps to better outcomes for low-income students

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.480
and students of color.

01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.920
Transformation happens when students, families, communities, and educators are authentic partners.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.760
It takes all of us to create racially just, relationship-centered community schools.

01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:38.760
Thank you.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.760
Thank you.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.160
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.160
You have one minute.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.160
Your time starts now.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600
Hi, good morning.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600
My name is Ed Olsevo.

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:54.600
I'm a youth organizer with Inland Congregations United for Change and a member of FICO California's

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.720
Education for Liberation.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.320
The community schools framework commitment to racially just and restorative school climate

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:04.320
can only be realized by rejecting school hardening and pushing out practices that criminalize

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:06.320
and marginalize students.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:10.320
As a former high school educator here in the Inland Empire, I have witnessed how heavily

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.320
policed schools serving students of color are.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:16.320
I've seen how our students are criminalized and unjustly pushed into the school discipline

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:20.320
pipeline because they're deemed a perceived threat by school security or even their teachers.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.320
It's imperative that our school districts begin to focus on replacing punitive discipline

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:28.320
with racially just and restorative practices into the pipeline.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.320
Transformation happens in students, families, community, and educators are authentic partners.

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.320
It takes all of us to create racially just, relationship-centered community schools.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.320
Thank you.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.320
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.320
Good morning, President Darning-Hammond and board members.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:53.320
My name is Maritza Benmudez, and I am a community organizer with Orange County Congregation

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.320
Community Organization and a parent leader at the Anaheim Union High School District

01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:01.320
and Anaheim Elementary School District in the city of Anaheim and a member of the California

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320
Partnership.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:06.320
I want to celebrate this moment and opportunity for my school's transformation as both of

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:09.320
the districts that my children attend receive community school grants.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.320
And I can proudly say that I was part of the grant writing process with Anaheim Union High

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.320
School District.

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:18.320
For my schools, receiving the community school grant will mean so many things, but most importantly

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:22.320
to me and my community, it will let us have a voice and an active seat at the table.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.320
Building authentic relationships between students, families, educators, and community partners

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:32.320
is key to the success of a transformational change that will benefit our community.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.320
I want to end by highlighting that transformation happens when students, families, communities,

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:40.320
and educators are authentic partners.

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:45.320
It takes all of us to create racially just relationship centers, community schools.

01:29:45.320 --> 01:29:48.320
And I also want to thank the Anaheim Union High School District for their leadership

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.320
and leading the way for the community schools model in our city.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320
Thank you very much.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.320
Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.320
My name is Maryam Abdi, and I'm a parent leader with the Pacific California Education

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.320
for Literation in Auckland and a member of the California Foundation.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.320
We are excited to see many of our community priorities from the regional core uplifted

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:20.320
in the community school framework and program requirements.

01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.320
Many of the early speaking parents I know share similar concerns about how to raise

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:29.320
our children so they can be close to their culture and at the same time be included in

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:30.320
the school community.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:35.320
When we participated in the forum last December, we shared that our school needs to be responsive

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320
to our needs.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.320
We want our children and all the students to have equitable access to quality teaching

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:42.320
and learning.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:47.320
And that's why we must value and leverage the expertise of our community and community

01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:52.320
organization to partner with diverse families, students, and educators.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:57.320
It takes all of us to create a relatively just relationship between some community schools.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320
Thank you.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.320
Thank you.

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.320
We'll need two minutes with a Spanish speaker with interpretation.

01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.320
Okay, no problem.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:12.320
Thank you.

My name is Celvia and I am a mom in the Sacramento School District and a member of the California

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.320
Partnership.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:24.320
For my school, receiving subsidies for this community school means that students and

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:31.320
families can receive mental health support to receive this support that they need so much.

01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:36.320
In my school, building authentic relationships between students, families, educators, and

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.320
community partners is the key to success.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:45.320
My name is Celvia and I'm a parent on Sacramento School District.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:48.320
I'm a member of the California Partnership for the schools.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.320
Receiving this community school grant will mean that students and families will be able

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.320
to receive the support that they need.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:57.320

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.320
This grant will mean that students and families will be able to receive more mental health

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.320
support.

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.320
They will be able to receive the support they so badly need.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:21.320
At my school, building authentic relationships between students, families, and educators

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:24.320
and community partners is the key to success.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:30.320
The schools must be designed with parents and students and the table to decide how the

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320
dollars are going to spend.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.320
This is a great opportunity.

01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:39.320
I want to see our needs represented and how the money will be spent.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:42.320
I'm very happy to celebrate the effort that we all made.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.320
Thank you.

Hi.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.320
We'll need two minutes for a monolingual speaker with interpretation and an additional

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.320
minute for the interpreter who's also an organizer to provide your testimony.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:03.320
Okay.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.320
Thank you.

My name is Alma Chavez.

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:53.180
I am a parent leader in Fullerton, California with OCO, Pico California Education for Liberation

and a member of the California Partnership.

01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:01.220
We fully support the language in the governor's proposed bill that restricts community schools

01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:07.700
grantees from using funds on punitive disciplinary practices such as police and resource officers

01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:09.740
who harm students of color.

01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:14.140
As a parent, I hope that our schools are a place of support and not a place of punishment

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:15.140
and trauma.

01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.220
Transformation happens when students, families, and community and educators are authentic

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.220
partners.

01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.060
It takes all of us to create racially judged relationships in our community schools.

01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:26.060
Thank you.

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:43.100
Orange County and a member of the California Partnership for the Future of Learning.

01:35:43.100 --> 01:35:47.660
The community school framework commitment to racially just and restorative school climates

01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:53.380
can only be realized by rejecting school harnany and push out practices that criminalize and

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.900
marginalize students, caregivers, and their communities.

01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.580
As an organizer, I have seen the racial disparities in our schools that hurt students, families,

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.900
and communities and we all now have an opportunity to transform and heal.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:11.020
So thank you so much for that and transformation happens when students, families, communities,

01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.420
and educators are authentic partners and it takes all of us to create racially just relationships

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:16.420
in our schools.

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:17.420
Thank you.

01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.420
Thank you.

01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:21.580
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:22.580
We have one minute.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.580
Your time starts now.

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:31.660
We'll need two minutes for a monolingual speaker with interpretation and then an additional

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:36.060
one minute for the interpreter who is also an organizer to provide testimony.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:37.860
Okay, no problem.

01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:38.860
Please proceed.

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:50.780
My name is Gabriela Silva, United Fathers, BAC in Salinas, in the County of Monterrey.

01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.900
I am an organizer and a mother leader.

01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:59.900
The experience with our community is to ensure that the districts will include the most impacted

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:03.620
families of ethnic languages and diverse minorities in the community.

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:08.260
We want transparency in the process without limiting parents and students to be part of

01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:14.540
the process and ensure that the pressure of you brings transparency and authentic involvement.

01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:18.860
For us it is very important that you listen to us for the future of our young people.

01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:24.060
The transformation happens when students, families, communities, and educators are authentic

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.740
partners for the success of all generations.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.740
Thank you.

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:36.060
My name is Gabriela Silva, United Fathers, BAC in Salinas, in Monterrey County.

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.020
I'm an organizer and a parent leader.

01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:44.140
Our experience of the community has been ensuring that districts include the entire community

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:49.740
in decisions, especially the most impacted families of diverse languages, ethnicities,

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.100
and races.

01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:55.940
We want transparency in the processes without limiting parents and students in being part

01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:56.940
of the process.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.900
We want to ensure that your pressure brings transparency and authentic involvement.

01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:08.940
For us and for the future of our young people, it is very important that they listen to us.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:13.780
Transformation happens when students, families, communities, and educators are authentic partners

01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:16.380
for the success of every generation.

01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:17.380
Thank you.

01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:18.820
Thank you.

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:21.500
Now I will give my testimony.

01:38:21.500 --> 01:38:26.340
My name is Katie Nunez-Adler, I'm a parent leader with PICO and the statewide coordinator

01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.740
for the California Partnership.

01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:34.660
We celebrate the process of continuous improvement embedded into the community schools program.

01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:39.580
Ensuring that school and district shared decision-making teams annually present their community schools

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:45.020
plans at the school site and district levels to remain eligible for grant funding is a

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.220
strong lever for school transformation.

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:52.340
In Oakland, high school teams have been required to do such presentations for the past seven

01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:53.340
years.

01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.780
Ninety-three percent of school teams reported that the process has been key to reflection,

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.260
learning, and school improvement.

01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:04.020
Since this practice began, the graduation rate for African-American boys has increased

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:08.860
by 12.2 percent and the A to G completion rate has increased by 14.1.

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:15.220
We're excited to see an annual public presentation of a plan included in statute as a requirement

01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:19.740
and think it should apply to districts receiving planning grants as well.

01:39:19.740 --> 01:39:25.140
Transformation happens when students, families, community, and educators are authentic partners.

01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.140
Thank you.

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.140
Thank you.

Your time starts now.

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:39.300
Caller with...

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:40.300
We need two minutes for...

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:44.420
We need two minutes for our Spanish speaker with interpretation.

01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:45.420
Okay.

01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.420
Please proceed.

01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:49.980
Good morning.

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:55.980
My name is Alma Laredo, parent leader and education organizer with VHC, Padres Unidos

01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:58.100
and Salinas, Monterey County.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:04.220
We organize parents and students throughout Monterey County and also we are members of

01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:06.620
California partnerships.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:12.900
Parent and student engagement are critical and important for us and we ask for your support

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:18.260
ensuring that local school districts include our voices and experiences in the process.

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:24.140
We want that exist dialogues within the community and creativity to get data and make sure this

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:26.940
includes parents, youth, and students.

01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:31.380
We don't want only surveys and information to check the box and just get the grant.

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:37.340
We need commitment, responsibility, and transparency, but also collaboration and the decision in

01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:38.340
the planning process.

01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.700
This will reflect equity, authenticity in the process.

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.540
The transformation happens when students, families, community, and educators are true

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:51.060
partners for success of future generations.

01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:52.060
Thank you.

01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:53.820
Thank you.

01:41:54.500 --> 01:41:56.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:57.140
You have one minute.

01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.140
Your time starts now.

01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:03.580
Good morning, President Darlin-Hammond and state board members.

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:08.580
This is Lucero Chavez on behalf of PIKI, the Parent Institute for Quality Education.

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:12.460
We are a national family engagement nonprofit based in California.

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.580
We want to thank CDE and the board for your commitment to uplifting equity in the community

01:42:16.580 --> 01:42:17.580
schools program.

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:23.060
The 18,000 families that we serve across California have shared with us just how much accessible,

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:27.900
holistic resources are needed in their communities to recover from the pandemic and to thrive

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:28.900
after.

01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:33.900
I'd also like to emphasize that PIKI and other CBOs are ready to partner and share our local

01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.700
and statewide expertise to develop best practices and tools to facilitate successful communities

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.580
of practice and capacity building.

01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.580
Thank you, and we look forward to working together to create a community school that

01:42:44.580 --> 01:42:48.100
reflects the needs of our families across the state.

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:49.100
Thank you.

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.100
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:52.100
You have one minute.

01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.140
Time starts now.

01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:00.140
Dr. Hayen Kimner with the California Community Schools Learning Exchange.

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.140
Good morning.

01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:05.140
We are thrilled to hear about the LEAs and the charters that have been awarded community

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:10.140
schools planning and implementation grants and are especially excited about the small

01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:15.140
and rural school district that recognize that this opportunity is not just about COVID relief

01:43:15.140 --> 01:43:21.140
or programmatic interventions, rather a successful and sustainable community strategy can

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:26.180
galvanize a regional partnership and systems approach that brings together the relationships

01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:31.180
and leadership within local communities, cross-sector and departmental county resources,

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:36.180
and informal and formal systems of early care and education and post-secondary education.

01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:41.180
These are the regional strengths and assets that are a valuable foundation for LEAs to

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:46.180
bring alignment and coherence to other major funding streams in the current budget, as

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:51.220
well as the anticipation of future investments, as outlined in the Governor's May Revise,

01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:56.220
including universal pre-K, expanded learning, mental health, teacher and school residencies,

01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:59.220
and much needed increases to school facilities funding.

01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:01.220
Thank you so much for your time.

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:02.220
Thank you.

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.220
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.220
You have one minute.

01:44:05.220 --> 01:44:06.220
Your time starts now.

01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:12.220
Good morning, State Board of Education members.

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:16.260
My name is Lorraine Richards, and I am a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers

01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:17.260
Association.

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:23.260
CTA would like to recommend that the next round of planning grants have a due date of

01:44:23.260 --> 01:44:25.260
early October 2022.

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:30.260
This will allow for authentic engagement and shared decision-making with students, families,

01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:35.260
educators, and communities, also allowing the creation of a steering committee.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:41.300
CTA also would like to recommend that round two of implementation grants should be due

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:47.300
in February 2023, allowing for current planning grantees to authentically implement the structures

01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:53.300
of shared decision-making and for the CDE to determine if the grantees are meeting their

01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:54.300
commitments.

01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:02.300
Lastly, CTA recommends that the superintendent's statewide advisory council be formed to play

01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:08.340
a role in guiding the CDE through this process and help to ensure that the commitments made

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.340
by the grantees are happening.

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:11.340
Thank you for your time.

01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.340
Thank you.

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.340
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.340
You have one minute.

01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:19.340
Your time starts now.

01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:26.340
My name is Gustavo Lopez with the Alliance for Boys and Men of Color.

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:30.340
Throughout the fall, more than 600 students, families, and educators came together through

01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:33.380
CDE-hosted forums to learn more about the community schools program.

01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:37.380
Community members call for racially just, religious and centered schools, where power

01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.380
and decision-making is shared with students, families, educators, and community, which

01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:45.380
is the foundation of a transformational education system built by and for all of us.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:49.380
Thank you for partnering and listening to the community and hosting these forums, and

01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:52.380
thank you for centering the recommendations and visions of students, families, and educators.

01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:56.380
Organizations from across the state came together to develop six core demands for community

01:45:56.420 --> 01:46:00.420
schools, and now it is essential that at this point, LEAs and districts are accountable

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:04.420
to these commitments, especially the commitment to police-free schools that promote restorative

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:06.420
schools and cultures.

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:10.420
It is essential that we move away from criminalizations and to connections.

01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:13.420
We're encouraged by the May revise, which prohibits funds for the community schools

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:17.420
program for punitive policies, and we encourage the state board to ensure LEAs and local

01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.420
districts adhere to this policy.

01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:20.420
Thank you.

01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:21.420
Thank you.

01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:24.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:46:24.420 --> 01:46:25.420
You have one minute.

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:26.460
Time starts now.

01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.460
Good morning.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.460
This is Julie Bush, superintendent of Maple School District.

01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:38.460
I would like you to please consider rural school districts' unique realities for community

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:39.460
school grants.

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:43.460
Maple School District is a small 287-student single school district between the two farming

01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.460
communities of Shafter and Wasco.

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:49.460
While millions of dollars were just awarded for community schools, Maple was eliminated

01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:50.460
for the funding list.

01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:51.460
Why?

01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.500
With a 55% unduplicated pupil count, Maple does not meet the eligibility requirement,

01:46:55.500 --> 01:47:00.500
even though it has priority as a school in a rural community and applied in a consortium

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:03.500
with other districts that do meet eligibility requirements.

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.500
For the last five years, Maple has been an anchor in the five-district community school

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:10.500
consortium, recipient of the highly competitive federal community school grant.

01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:15.500
Together, the districts have pulled resources to address shared priorities, each district

01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:18.500
that individually would not be able to do by themselves.

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:22.540
The efforts include hiring shared parent liaison community school coordinators, creating

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:26.540
preschool programs, establishing expanded learning programs, hiring a shared math coach,

01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:31.540
creating a collaborative attendance campaign to target chronic absenteeism, and providing

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:32.540
school social workers.

01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.540
Without Maple's funded participation in the consortium, the entire consortium efforts

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.540
will be impacted.

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.540
This funding criteria needs to be changed.

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:42.540
All students deserve the whole child approach in education.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:44.540
All students deserve mental health services.

01:47:44.540 --> 01:47:45.540
Thank you.

01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:46.580
Thank you.

Caller, you're live.

01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.580
You may start your comments now.

01:48:04.580 --> 01:48:05.580
Good morning, board members.

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:07.580
Janice Canellan, Children's Defense Fund California.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:12.580
Thank you for the new steps for community schools and collaborating around what became

01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:16.620
community schools policy with United Ways of California in budget language last year.

01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:21.620
Children's Defense Fund California emphasized ensuring safe school climates, eliminating

01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:26.620
racial inequity, and improving access to trauma-responsive mental health services.

01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:30.620
We are investing in ensuring coordination with community-based organizations and encourage

01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:35.620
grantees to co-lead efforts with local experts, and ask for CDE and the board to emphasize

01:48:35.620 --> 01:48:37.620
these co-led approaches and models.

01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.620
Thank you.

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620
Thank you.

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:41.620
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:48:41.660 --> 01:48:42.660
Your time starts now.

01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:50.660
Hello, this is Dr. Kendra Fair with California Community Schools Learning Exchange.

01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:53.660
On behalf of the Learning Exchange, we celebrate the LEAs that have been awarded community

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:55.660
schools and implementation grants.

01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:59.660
We urge the school board to remember for this historic investment to have lasting impact,

01:48:59.660 --> 01:49:03.660
we must actively support community schools as part of a system change strategy.

01:49:03.660 --> 01:49:08.660
Recipients must be supported not only in the development of powerful individual community

01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:11.700
schools, but of community school districts, systems.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.700
This moment rests on the expertise of decades of local implementation experience in

01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:19.700
California, including Oakland's community school district system, the Western County

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:23.700
Consortium's innovative partnership across small rural LEAs, charter and alternative

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:28.700
schools serving students for this opportunity, and county-led work in MTSS, PBIS, inclusion,

01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:30.700
and integrated systems of care.

01:49:30.700 --> 01:49:34.700
Ongoing support for community school grantees must reflect the plurality of experiences

01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:37.700
and expertise in community school implementation across the state.

01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.740
Thank you so much for your time.

01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.740
Thank you.

01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:42.740
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:43.740
You have one minute.

01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:44.740
Your time starts now.

01:49:47.740 --> 01:49:48.740
Hello, everyone.

01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:49.740
Good morning.

01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:50.740
My name is Lucero Soto.

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.740
I am a community organizer with Sacramento Act and a member of the California Partnership.

01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:59.740
I am excited about this historic opportunity because this creates a space for students

01:49:59.740 --> 01:50:03.740
and families and school communities to build together a better future.

01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:07.780
It takes all of us to create a racially just relationship-centered community school.

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:11.780
I hope this brings the people closest to the pain into decision-making.

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:16.780
School-side and district multi-stakeholder community school teams must have decision-making

01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:21.780
power and include directly impacted students and families that reflect the diversity of

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:23.780
their school community needs.

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:27.780
Community schools must be developed with the students and families who share power and

01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:32.780
decision-making with educators and community-based organizations to create schools that meet

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820
the needs of their unique community.

01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:38.820
I am excited to continue the great work and see it blossom in our local districts.

01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:40.820
Thank you for your time.

01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.820
Thank you.

01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:44.820
That concludes public comment for item number two.

01:50:55.820 --> 01:50:56.820
Shift to our discussion.

01:50:56.860 --> 01:50:57.860
I want to be sure.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:03.860
Is there anybody else in the in-person queue who's added themselves to the list?

01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:07.860
All right.

01:51:07.860 --> 01:51:08.860
We are good to go.

01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:10.860
So we're now open for discussion.

01:51:13.860 --> 01:51:15.860
Nice to hear all of the enthusiasm.

01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:18.860
Yes.

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:19.860
Member Patio-Branson.

01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:20.860
I'll start us off.

01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:22.860
I also just wanted to reflect.

01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:30.900
I just kind of remember we had the prior innovation of allowing folks to call in for public comment

01:51:30.900 --> 01:51:36.900
and it's just actually a lovely groundswell of bringing people in from around the state

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:41.900
who can't necessarily travel up to Sacramento and also just want to reflect appreciation

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.900
for all the people who joined us on the phone.

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:51.900
So I'll start by saying I am very excited about this motion and I think the amount of

01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:57.940
work that has been done in such a for the time scale of a state of 40 million for all

01:51:57.940 --> 01:51:58.940
of these gears.

01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:04.940
I guess it's the ocean liner analogy that's probably more appropriate of turning such

01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:09.940
a large ship to actually live into the community schools vision is incredibly exciting.

01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:15.940
And I'm just so acutely aware that our colleagues in other states are watching what we're doing

01:52:15.940 --> 01:52:16.940
here.

01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:24.980
I'm also so appreciative of Steve lifting up that we are we are taking many of the best

01:52:24.980 --> 01:52:33.980
elements in terms of sort of the four four principles framework from our national colleagues

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:39.980
and also uniquely lifting up what is most resonant and innovative and true to California

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:43.980
which is a very justice and equity based approach.

01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:53.020
I think I every year I always sort of dwell on the state yesterday which was the anniversary

01:52:53.020 --> 01:53:00.020
of Brown versus Board of Ed which is obviously a seminal sort of date in school histories

01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:05.020
but it's also I think really important to think about that it was a court decision about

01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:11.020
racial desegregation but it was also one very much about resource equity and fairness and

01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:18.060
what attendance services and opportunities kids have based on where they come from what

01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:25.060
their race is and what their ethnic background might be really this approach of bringing

01:53:25.060 --> 01:53:34.060
a full whole child whole student sort of set of services and really acknowledgments of

01:53:34.060 --> 01:53:40.060
who children are when they come into schools I think is just incredibly exciting important

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.100
and so proud of that California is leaning into this.

01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:50.100
I have a couple of questions and so I'll maybe ask Steve to rejoin us for conversation

01:53:52.100 --> 01:53:58.100
and having known who you were beforehand there's nothing disappointing for expectation

01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.100
management.

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:05.100
So the first question I guess is around early childhood engagement which was raised on the

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:12.140
slide if you can give us a preview of next steps and what the opportunities for round

01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:17.140
two might look like shall I do all the questions or do you want to one by one I have three

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.140
questions.

01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:26.140
I can start with early childhood because I think it's really important for us to elevate

01:54:26.180 --> 01:54:37.180
this and I appreciate thank you I appreciate your recognition of steering and turning the

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:46.180
ship and what that's taken over the past six months and as I said in my comments it really

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.180
is this team.

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:50.180
This line is now on hold.

01:54:56.180 --> 01:55:01.180
I have tried for years to have that musical accompaniment to my answers.

01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:06.180
Now I know I had to come to Sacramento to find it.

01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:17.180
It really is a testimony to the folks who are here with me today and some of whom are

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220
not.

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:33.220
But there were there were gaps and the timeline did not allow for us to engage the early ed

01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:44.220
community the way I think we would have liked to beyond LEA affiliated early ed programs.

01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:50.260
I would I would be less than honest if I would say that there is that there's a fully

01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:57.260
established plan of how to do this but but certainly the intention to reach out to our

01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:07.260
partners immediately you know upon you know us moving forward after today's vote to really

01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:16.300
determine in the in the mixed delivery system that you and I are so familiar with how do

01:56:16.300 --> 01:56:26.300
we how do we make sure that our our earliest learners are are going to be the beneficiaries

01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:35.300
of this this approach certainly as they enter transitional kindergarten but no matter where

01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:42.340
they are in that mixed delivery system and so that's a complex question but it's top

01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:53.340
of mind and we know and I'm grateful for the partnership of first five first five

01:56:53.340 --> 01:57:03.340
California and and a number of our other advocacy or organizations and consortiums across the

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:08.380
state who have said who kind of been I just want to say understanding of the timeline

01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:17.380
that we were on but but definitely ready and anxious to engage us on how and how we do

01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:25.380
this so what I can say is it is a priority and we are listening for the ways to to to

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.380
best to to to best engage.

01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:34.420
One one very quick piece I just when I was looking through the documents even from our

01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:41.420
January board item to now there were there was language that actually described early

01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:47.420
learning as part of either supplemental learning time sort of in line with either summer

01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:53.420
school or after school as well as whole child supports and it was previously there and it

01:57:53.460 --> 01:58:01.460
has fallen off the page so it some one part of it I think is just also what gets named

01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:06.460
gets remembered and addressed so as we think about round two I think making sure that the

01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:11.460
words do sort of repair reappear on the page I think will be sort of at least a starting

01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.460
point and then I'll I'll look forward to hearing more about sort of what the outreach

01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:16.460
plan looks like.

01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:20.460
I think the second question that is related is around data transparency and I think a

01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:27.500
number of the folks on the call raised this up about whether any analytics would be

01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:32.500
available in the future about both the applicant pool as well as those who were

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:39.500
awarded not just in terms of early ed as a one part of that but also in terms of I

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:45.500
think school type grade span unduplicated percentages and race and ethnicity.

01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:51.540
I think that last one obviously just matters a ton given that we we are lifting up the

01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:54.540
importance of the racial equity part of that and I don't know if that's forthcoming or

01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:58.540
if that's already been collected.

01:58:58.540 --> 01:59:01.540
I'll use the term in process.

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:12.540
Certainly we we are we're you know we are we're proud to be bringing a recommendation

01:59:12.580 --> 01:59:21.580
to you today that that has prioritized our schools with 80 percent or higher unduplicated

01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:24.580
counts of students.

01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:31.580
We have begun to as I as I outlined in the presentation we have begun the process of

01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:38.580
reflecting and diving deep in into the data of who applied who didn't apply who was

01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:45.620
awarded who was not awarded beyond just the unduplicated count.

01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:55.620
When I when I spoke of identifying community school deserts it's not just figuring out

01:59:55.620 --> 02:00:01.620
where they are geographically it's figuring out it's it's looking at them in their

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:06.620
totality and understanding where the where the where those gaps are.

02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:12.660
We've begun to see some trends but I want to be cautious on reporting on them before

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:18.660
we were able to look at the whole picture in terms of transparency around that.

02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:26.660
I I think that we've we've created or or we've set some good precedent to date in terms

02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:33.660
of our our open communication and and our transparency with the partners that we've

02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:40.700
learned from the what you see today in this RFA process and very specifically what what

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:50.700
you see where you saw and continue to see in this framework was informed by the voices

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:53.700
that we heard.

02:00:53.700 --> 02:01:02.700
Certainly some of us had a long time experience in some of the elements of community school

02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:09.740
and certainly integrated service delivery but this document and the RFA approvals that

02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:14.740
you have today go way beyond that and a lot of that is because of the open dialog and

02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:21.740
communication that that we had both with the field and with with community and advocacy

02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:26.740
organizations and we intend to keep that we intend to keep that moving forward.

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:34.780
I'll take your question a step further and say that we we also hope that data transparency

02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:42.780
of the awardees is going to be part and parcel of of what community school transformation

02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:51.780
means because if we are to share in truly sharing decision making we have to have equitable

02:01:51.820 --> 02:02:00.820
access to the information and the data that guides our decisions and so so so in in short

02:02:01.820 --> 02:02:08.820
the answer is is is we intend to have that transparency and we think that if we are to

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:14.820
implement in accordance with kind of the heart and soul of this movement that that's like

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:17.820
a threshold requirement.

02:02:17.860 --> 02:02:24.860
And I'm I'm sure many folks will follow up to find out exactly when and that will remember

02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:27.860
that you can lean into your mic and make sure it's on.

02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:29.860
They're not picking you up on the line.

02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.860
Sorry.

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:36.860
I'm just thanking Steve for for the comments and also expecting a timeline will become

02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:41.860
more apparent and the request that you share it with us as that becomes apparent.

02:02:41.860 --> 02:02:45.860
The last question I think and I should have prefaced this to say these are all friendly

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:46.900
questions.

02:02:46.900 --> 02:02:53.900
I am totally in favor of this package and on this this issue of what does it mean to

02:02:54.900 --> 02:03:01.900
lean into the last pillar around shared decision making shared power with community based

02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:07.900
organizations in some ways I feel like the community schools effort leans so much into

02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:13.900
the same lane as LCFF around being one of the largest democratic experiments really

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:21.940
of bringing local community voice into decision making and and also hearing from a large

02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:26.940
number of our community partners and folks from the California Partnership in particular

02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:31.940
asking for more clarity about what sort of assurances and structures will be built in

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:39.940
to ensure collaboration with the local regional the centralized TA as well as the regional

02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:40.940
leads.

02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:49.980
So I think that it has to be I mean let me say we're here we're here with a with a request

02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:57.980
we're here with a recommendation that we're very we're very proud of but this is going

02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:04.980
to be really hard work and and some of the hardest work is is around authentic shared

02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:12.020
sharing of power and and our RFA on the lead technical assistance center leaned into the

02:04:19.020 --> 02:04:26.020
framework in ways that I think made all applicants aware that as important as as the four pillars

02:04:26.060 --> 02:04:33.060
that lead the national movement are as important particularly in this moment as integrated

02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:42.060
service delivery and better service delivery better access to to services are that is not

02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:50.060
the totality of what defines the community schools movement in California and how we

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:57.100
codified that in in this framework and so we absolutely need to have those accountability

02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:07.100
mechanisms built in to every every stage of our process if you will I would be getting

02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:16.100
ahead of the the the lead technical assistance content to to propose exactly what I believe

02:05:16.140 --> 02:05:23.140
those should be at this moment but I believe they should be central to what we continue

02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:32.140
to report back to this board but I think even more importantly what happens on on the ground

02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:39.140
and in our schools and I guess I'd wrap by saying that this was the this was central

02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:47.140
to our our our thought process our execution process and in the tool that we have available

02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:56.980
to us so far which was which was this RFA and we what we can commit from our team is

02:05:56.980 --> 02:06:01.460
that they will can this will continue to be central to us in every in every tool that

02:06:01.460 --> 02:06:04.940
we have at our at our disposal so thank you for that for the question.

02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:13.980
Got all of that okay so I just want to see is there are there any I just want to be sure

02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:20.980
we were done with that set of questions great answers yes member Roscoe Gonzales.

02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:26.700
Well as I expressed earlier this is a great beginning to activate engagement and to reach

02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:31.260
students of diverse backgrounds this is a great opportunity for our state and our students

02:06:31.260 --> 02:06:35.420
as we know transformation truly does happen when we build bridges between families students

02:06:35.420 --> 02:06:40.820
and communities and I heard that quite a bit in our in our comments by straightening

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:44.740
these partnerships we truly begin to build a foundation for a community of learners and

02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:50.100
in our diverse environment that deeply supports our students with contrasting backgrounds

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:55.180
I was really motivated by what some of the public hearing comments were where they express

02:06:55.180 --> 02:07:01.460
in Spanish that they want to be socios on the vehicles which is just really authentic partnerships

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:07.540
within our communities and ours our schools so my question is what is the CDE's plan to

02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:12.460
ensure that the planning grant recipients deliver on their commitments prior to applying

02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:15.820
or receiving implementation grant funds for round two.

02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:30.100
It's a it's a it's a great question an important question we and and let me say that I we really

02:07:30.140 --> 02:07:40.860
we heard those comments today but also throughout this process this this desire to really be

02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:54.900
true and authentic partners partners not just participants right and so so we are we are

02:07:54.900 --> 02:08:02.980
in the process of developing what how we will change the second round implementation

02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:13.860
grant RFA from from the first from the first round we expect that the commitments that

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:22.300
were in this planning grant RFA were not just checking the boxes.

02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:34.260
The question was asked before the comments you know why do why how are we going to determine

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:42.940
why different LEAs may not have applied for for the planning grants.

02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:47.180
We haven't heard yet that folks didn't want to make those commitments that were in that

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:55.860
were in the RFA but those commitments that we put in the RFA were intentional and so

02:08:55.860 --> 02:09:04.100
as we look at the not just you know implementation grants for folks who who who had and have

02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:08.900
been participating in existing community schools but folks who are very intentionally going

02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:14.940
from planning grant to implementation grant that will be part of the the threshold.

02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:20.900
I don't know yet how we will measure that that is going to be a deep engagement with

02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:25.620
our lead technical assistance center and our our regional technical assistance centers

02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:35.140
as we as we begin to to to develop the RFA for planning grant recipients who are then

02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:39.900
going to move into the implementation phase but it is going to be a threshold issue to

02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:53.300
commitments that they've made around every piece of the community school process is set

02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:57.220
up for success in the implementation stage.

02:09:57.220 --> 02:10:07.420
Yeah and if I could just say you know the governor's budget includes some capacity for

02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:13.180
I think it's three additional positions and so I think you know those are all the plans that need

02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:17.460
to be put in place that we would have some capacity to actually do the follow-through

02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:24.220
and develop those measures and look at the analytics so I just wanted to make sure you

02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:29.500
knew that that we are working on some capacity to be able to actually make sure that these

02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:36.380
massive investments are are well used and that we can follow through and actually measure the

02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:41.060
outcomes and to be able to move forward so I just wanted to make sure that that was

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:46.340
understood that there is some funding to build CDs capacity around community schools.

02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:51.740
Member Glover-Woods and then member Escobedo.

02:10:51.740 --> 02:11:04.020
Thank you and first let me say just much appreciation for just the large effort and

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:11.900
work that has gone into the development and the initial launch of this very important

02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:17.540
program. I know you have worked tirelessly as has CD and SP staff and others and our

02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:24.140
education partners to has been said a little earlier get something moving that is very very

02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:30.140
large in a very expeditious way so thank you so much for that and as you mentioned a little

02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:35.940
earlier there's so much more work to be done I think I will echo the course that I've heard

02:11:35.940 --> 02:11:42.900
from my fellow board members which is implementation is key we have had a significant investment of

02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:51.260
fiscal resources and otherwise to have a program in place to really serve our students and families

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:57.220
and communities that have been historically underserved and California I'm sure is under

02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:02.500
the microscope to see what we will do with that and how it will impact students so again

02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:09.220
implementation is key so as we move forward with our processes I don't know that I necessarily

02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:15.900
have a question I think I have more of a comment on how essential the collaboration will be

02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:23.140
collaboration between our lead technical assistance centers those regional tax when

02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:30.100
they are identified as well as the county offices that are supporting the LA's and the LA's

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:38.540
themselves even more essential is what we heard echoed many times in the comments in the public

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:44.780
comments which is that authentic collaboration with parents and families and students and

02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:54.300
communities so I look forward to ongoing updates that are brought to the board letting us know

02:12:54.300 --> 02:13:01.060
not only the process aspects of what happens beyond the planning and the issuing of the

02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:09.220
implementation grants but most importantly the impact it has on students both their academic

02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:16.700
performance as well as their social emotional well-being this again is a wonderful opportunity

02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:22.780
to really change the tide in education in California for so many of our students and

02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:30.820
families and just looking forward to hearing more and the inclusion of early childhood and

02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:41.700
other areas as we move forward. I actually want to emphasize what Dr. Wood said and also my

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:47.860
colleagues we have planning grant only thirty nine million there's two hundred and sixty million out

02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:56.580
there so whatever we all can do to heighten the messaging on this amazing opportunity will be

02:13:56.580 --> 02:14:02.460
welcome because definitely round two will be coming up soon and and we definitely want more

02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:09.660
entities to be to be applying that and you know I heard implementation being critical those five

02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:17.700
regional centers getting them online and hopefully the other three who didn't make the the main

02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:23.380
person they would get to understand where they are in the in the process and that community getting

02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:28.700
those five regional centers is going to be very critical for implementation purposes.

02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:40.260
Member Olken and then maybe we can move towards a motion. Thank you. First I just want to thank

02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:46.300
you for the presentation and also thank those who gave public comment as somebody new to the

02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:52.940
board it's really great to hear both the professional work that's being done and the the

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:59.860
really good thinking across the state from those who are on the ground in our schools and working

02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:11.740
with our schools and you know I I feel like this this movement and this investment is such an

02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:17.020
incredible opportunity to for us to rethink what the role of school is and who the owners of

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:29.540
schools are and help sort of build into the fabric of public education the idea that first we center

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:38.020
equity and that it takes everyone in a school community to figure out how to do that well and

02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:46.580
so the I just really appreciate the way that this is working to move that forward and my

02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:55.380
question it's sort of along the lines of how do we move the ocean liner and and I think this

02:15:55.380 --> 02:16:02.060
probably the answer is you'll let us know but I was looking at the timeline that was in the packet

02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:12.540
and it's sort of year by year and but what I'm what I saw in the in the presentation was that

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:20.860
the between when the request went out and when awards were made was actually very fast and so

02:16:20.860 --> 02:16:28.420
I'm sort of puzzling the urgency you know and the fact that moving something big takes time so I'm

02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:39.300
wondering about the timeline for round two specifically time between when the announcement

02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:49.660
is made of the potential grant and when LEAs would be responding because this is so important

02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:58.780
those who are not in the know currently to be amongst those who participate but we miss things

02:16:58.780 --> 02:17:05.740
I can just speak as a school later leader we miss things because we're busy and we're trying to

02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:11.580
keep our own ships running so I'm just wondering about the timeline and how we balance urgency

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:21.660
and inclusivity well thank you for elevating that and that is the balance that we are that in this

02:17:21.660 --> 02:17:31.700
next round we seek to achieve I want to be very honest and transparent urgency and the

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:40.940
compressed timeline were our reality for this first round and there were some deficits to that

02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:50.540
reality we do believe that we didn't reach everyone and and we're not okay with that we

02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:58.740
know that we know why the the urgency was there and why the timeline was compressed given the

02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:05.500
opportunity to not work under such a compressed timeline it's our responsibility to find that

02:18:05.500 --> 02:18:16.700
balance and to and to find the right ways to get the message to where it is not being heard or

02:18:16.700 --> 02:18:28.380
or or received we are listening to what the best ways to do that to do that will be many of the

02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:36.940
partners who who we heard from in public comment were in in in active engagement with as well as

02:18:36.940 --> 02:18:46.540
partners that did not call in call in today and you're correct I don't have a full answer yet

02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:58.220
but I also want to say that I also believe very strongly in the first part of your comments which

02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:07.260
are you know we are really trying to change change what school means and how education is

02:19:07.260 --> 02:19:18.540
experienced and if that is to be true no one no one in this state can can be outside of of this

02:19:18.540 --> 02:19:25.980
process and absolutely as you've heard time and time again this is a this is an equity and justice

02:19:25.980 --> 02:19:32.700
driven process we are absolutely intentional in the vote that we ask you to take today in

02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:38.780
in funding literally only the schools that are 80 percent or higher unduplicated is

02:19:39.420 --> 02:19:49.020
is not accidental it's purposeful it is designed to um to have to to alter not only the direction

02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:59.420
of the ship but to where people look and so the first part makes the second part all the more

02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:07.580
important and and we are we are we are listening and not what I can assure you is is that we are

02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:16.540
not you know sitting in an office or in a in a remote setting as the case may be just kind of

02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:20.860
figuring this out and saying well this will be best for the field we are listening actively

02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:26.220
to determine what that balance should be thank you for the question okay

02:20:32.780 --> 02:20:40.380
I'd like to make a motion member Escobeda I would like to motion on the three recommendations for

02:20:40.380 --> 02:20:47.340
approval the first one is to recommend that we approve the round one planning grant award

02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:55.820
this the second is to confirm the round one implemented implementation grant award and third

02:20:57.500 --> 02:21:08.460
to pass the CDE's lead technical assistance center contract award I can did right any further

02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:14.220
discussion all right all in favor say aye and raise your hands

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:18.860
I just want to be sure we're

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:28.540
definitely certain and then are there any nays any abstentions nice to see you back

02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:31.580
Rana and we hope your international baccalaureate test went well

02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:41.660
well the motion passes and you have earned a break so we'll see you in about 11 minutes

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:49.580
it's 11 24 we'll see you at 11 35 where's my gavel

02:21:57.420 --> 02:21:58.540
this is the most fun

02:22:02.220 --> 02:22:12.220
good part of you back in place don't get to do that on the zoom okay I'm not I'm not seeing it yet

02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:18.140
now that I've got your attention we're waiting for the countdown

02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:24.860
and I'll just uh all right

02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:36.540
okay all right welcome back our next item is the what we call the mega assessment item

02:22:37.580 --> 02:22:43.980
we call it that for a reason because it usually has multiple parts so we may after the presentation

02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:50.780
depending on how we're doing time wise at that point we may break for lunch in mid item and then

02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:55.980
return and I will keep you posted it's likely that we would in that case have the public comment

02:22:56.620 --> 02:23:01.180
after lunch but we'll sort of see where we are time wise I don't want any

02:23:02.540 --> 02:23:05.980
decisions made when the board members are hangry so

02:23:09.580 --> 02:23:16.700
we will monitor this carefully and so we're about to look at item three which involves

02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:20.860
the california assessment of student performance and progress system and english language

02:23:20.860 --> 02:23:26.380
proficiency assessments for california the CDE is recommending that we approve the per

02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:33.980
pupil apportionment rates for the 2021-22 school year for the casp tests as provided in table one

02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:41.420
of attachment two and the per pupil apportionment rates for the 2021-22 school year for the LPAC

02:23:41.420 --> 02:23:49.340
tests as well in addition the state superintendent of public instruction proposed initial and

02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:56.620
summative alternate LPAC threshold scores are proposed and for approval to be effective

02:23:56.620 --> 02:24:03.580
beginning in the 2021-22 administration and this item will be presented by Tracy Albee and Julie

02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:09.580

um mentioned our presentation today will cover an overview of the california department of

02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:45.660
educations or cde's recommendations as for approval of the portion and rates and the

02:25:45.660 --> 02:25:51.340
alternate english language proficiency assessments for california or lpac threshold scores

02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:57.180
then we will go over some california assessment of student performance or progress

02:25:57.180 --> 02:26:04.860
and progress or casp and lpac updates during this update we will be joined by sheryl cotton

02:26:04.860 --> 02:26:10.860
our deputy superintendent of the instruction measurement and administration division

02:26:12.060 --> 02:26:19.660
as well as our chief deputy superintendent mary nicely will join us to give a status of the test

02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:26.780
administration currently as well as the calpats upgrades and impact to statewide testing so we

02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:36.540
get a few of us joining on this mega item and then furthermore we will cover the national

02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:43.740
international assessments update for you and then circle back finally to our cde's recommendations

02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:50.940
for your approval and action okay with that um

02:26:55.740 --> 02:27:01.260
again as stated the recommendations here the cde or the california department of education recommends

02:27:01.260 --> 02:27:08.940
that the state board of education approve the 2021-22 per pupil apportionment rates for the casp

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:15.820
tests as administered as part of the casp system as provided in the table one of attachment two

02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:22.940
of the item and then the 2021-22 per pupil apportionment rates for the lpac tests that

02:27:22.940 --> 02:27:28.940
are administered as provided in table two of attachment two of the item and then the proposed

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:35.580
state superintendent public instruction or sspi's initial and summative alternate lpac threshold

02:27:35.580 --> 02:27:42.140
scores beginning with the 2021-22 administration as shown in attachment four of this item

02:27:48.140 --> 02:27:52.700
and then now let's move to our first recommendation will be which will be presented

02:27:52.700 --> 02:27:58.220
by tracy albee and she is the administrator of our english language proficiency and spanish

02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:03.180
assessments office within our assessment development and administration division

02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:07.580
here you go tracy thank you dr bang

02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:15.660
thank you president darling hammon and board members again i'm tracy albee and in this section

02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:23.580
i will go over the 2021-22 proposed apportionment rates for the casp and the lpac

02:28:23.580 --> 02:28:33.500
so the cde recommends that the state board approve the following proposed per pupil rates

02:28:33.500 --> 02:28:41.100
for the tests administered as part of the casp system during the 2021-22 school year

02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:47.100
we start off with our smaller balance summative assessments for english language arts or literacy

02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:54.060
and our mathematics at a per pupil rate of four dollars california science test

02:28:54.700 --> 02:29:03.260
two dollars california spanish assessment five dollars california alternate assessments or caa's

02:29:03.260 --> 02:29:13.260
for ela and our math five dollars and the caa for science five dollars and grade two diagnostic

02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:19.980
assessments for ela or mathematics which are optional at two dollars and 52 cents and finally

02:29:19.980 --> 02:29:26.140
students that have not been tested due to medical emergency and parent and guardian exemptions

02:29:26.780 --> 02:29:31.820
these are the same rates that were approved by the state board of education

02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:36.220
in may of 2021 for the previous administration year

02:29:36.940 --> 02:29:44.300
next the cde recommends that the state board of education approve the following rates for tests

02:29:44.300 --> 02:29:53.580
administered as part of the lpac during the 2021-22 school year starting with the initial lpac

02:29:54.140 --> 02:30:01.980
kindergarten through grade two five dollars and 50 cents initial lpac grades three through 12

02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:12.380
grades three through 12 five dollars initial lpac rotating score validation process identified

02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:18.940
students in kindergarten through grade 12 an additional 50 cents per student the summative

02:30:18.940 --> 02:30:26.220
lpac kindergarten through grade two five dollars and 50 cents and the summative lpac grades three

02:30:26.220 --> 02:30:33.420
through 12 five dollars this year recommended apportionment rates for the lpac are the same

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:40.780
as the previous year with one exception the new assessment the alternate lpac operational field

02:30:40.780 --> 02:30:47.260
test has been added to the apportionment rates and is seen in that final row with the addition

02:30:47.260 --> 02:30:54.380
of the alternate lpac operational field test which is a one-on-one administration the cde

02:30:54.380 --> 02:31:00.620
recommends an apportionment rate of five dollars and 50 cents per pupil for kindergarten through

02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:08.460
grade 12 this is similar to the initial and summative k2 lpac administrations which are also

02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:15.420
one-on-one i will circle back to the cde's recommendations toward the end of the presentation

02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:21.900
but i am happy to answer any questions clarifying questions you may have now

02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:28.220
okay

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:38.940
i will move on now let's move on to the next recommendation for the alternate lpac proposed

02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:40.140
threshold scores

02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:50.140
also present to assist me with questions are the following colleagues from educational testing

02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:56.220
services or ets kelly bolton who is the interim director for assessment development

02:31:56.220 --> 02:32:04.300
and patty barron strategic advisor for standard setting so the background for the alternate lpac

02:32:05.180 --> 02:32:11.820
the test was developed to comply with the following requirements it is administered pursuant to the

02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:21.820
california education code sections 313 and 60810 it is aligned to the 2012 california

02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:31.580
english language development or eld standards via the eld connectors which are reduced in depth

02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:41.020
breadth and complexity for this specific population in 2019 the state board of education approved the

02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:51.260
alternate lpac general performance level descriptors or plds and the score reporting structure

02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:58.060
it is important to note that the work accomplished during the alternate lpac standard setting process

02:32:58.620 --> 02:33:05.740
was guided by these board approved plds and will be provided to the u.s department of education

02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:09.900
as part of the federal peer review of this new assessment

02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:20.220
the alternate lpac measures the english language proficiency of students with the most

02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:27.100
significant cognitive disabilities as determined by their individualized education team

02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:35.820
and whose primary language is a language other than english it is administered to students in

02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:41.980
kindergarten through grade 12 either upon first enrolling in a california public school

02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:49.820
or annually for those students identified as english learners each spring it is set

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:56.380
sorry it assesses the receptive listening and reading domains and the expressive speaking

02:33:56.380 --> 02:34:04.380
and writing domains through items that are given to or that using a student's preferred

02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:13.820
communication mode for example a student may point to gesture or use an augmentative and

02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:20.460
alternative communication device or ac device to respond to the items

02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:28.700
this slide outlines the work leading up to this request for approval of the alternate lpac proposed

02:34:28.700 --> 02:34:34.700
threshold scores the development of the alternate lpac began with the state board approval of the

02:34:34.700 --> 02:34:41.900
high level test design performance level descriptors and the reporting structure in 2019

02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:48.780
the state board of education then approved the alternate lpac test blueprints in 2019

02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:57.980
test blueprints in may 2020 which were the same for both the initial and the summative alternate

02:34:57.980 --> 02:35:06.140
lpac in 2021 a field test began in november and will come to the close at the end of this month

02:35:07.020 --> 02:35:13.580
during the field test window the standard setting workshop was conducted at the end of february

02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:20.300
beginning of march of this year all that work brings us to today's request for approval

02:35:20.300 --> 02:35:26.860
of the alternate lpac threshold scores once approval is received the initial alternate

02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:33.900
lpac will be administered for the first time beginning this july and the summative alternate

02:35:33.900 --> 02:35:39.020
lpac will be administered starting on february 1st 2023

02:35:43.180 --> 02:35:50.620
a detailed standard setting plan was approved by the cde and submitted to the state board of education

02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:57.420
as an informational memorandum last month the standard setting approach utilized a modified

02:35:57.420 --> 02:36:05.500
and extended angoff methods the modified angoff method is used for one point responses

02:36:06.460 --> 02:36:15.020
and the extended angoff method is used for two point responses with both methods panelists had

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:21.900
to consider the knowledge and skills that the threshold student has and the knowledge and

02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:30.780
skills needed to earn one point and two points both of these methods are widely accepted and

02:36:30.780 --> 02:36:36.940
adhere to the guidelines and best practices recommended in the standard setting literature

02:36:37.980 --> 02:36:44.940
later this fall a standard setting technical report will be posted which describes this

02:36:45.020 --> 02:36:52.300
process in detail the next loose sorry the next few slides provide an overview

02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:55.660
of the standard setting process that was used

02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:06.300
as described in attachment six of this item the panelists were comprised of 44

02:37:06.300 --> 02:37:15.980
diverse california educators who represented the three main regions of california central

02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:24.860
northern and southern they had varied ethnicities and included perspectives of classroom teachers

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:33.020
and local educational agency or lea or county employees they had experience in teaching

02:37:33.020 --> 02:37:41.820
students learning the skills assessed with the alternate lpac lastly nine of the 44 educators

02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:49.660
participated on more than one panel as this standard setting workshop occurred over two weeks

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:59.420
the first step in the standard setting process was to review the alternate lpac items

02:38:00.220 --> 02:38:06.860
the panelists then reviewed the performance level descriptors to define the knowledge and skills of

02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:14.620
each threshold student using these definitions the panelists made two rounds of judgments on

02:38:14.620 --> 02:38:22.940
the likelihood that students at the threshold would answer each item correctly with discussions

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:33.900
between each round here is a little graphic we love to share so the alternate lpac there are

02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:42.940
three performance levels level one is novice english learner level two is intermediate

02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:51.820
english learner and level three is fluent english proficient therefore two threshold

02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:59.820
scores are needed for each grade level or grade span the panelists were tasked with

02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:06.780
reviewing the performance level descriptors or plds and defined the knowledge and skills of that

02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:16.220
threshold student for levels two and levels three in other words what does performance look like

02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:27.420
for that student who is just into level two and just into level three that is the solid pink

02:39:27.420 --> 02:39:34.620
character for level two and the solid blue character for level three that are indicated

02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:42.940
on this slide these threshold student definitions are also referred to as the threshold plds

02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:50.540
these descriptions are an important tool that the educator panelists used to make their recommended

02:39:50.540 --> 02:40:04.140
threshold score judgments okay so the modified and extended angoff methods were implemented

02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:13.180
for one point and two point items the panelists made judgments on the likelihood that each of

02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:21.420
the two threshold students level two and level three would answer each one point item correctly

02:40:22.460 --> 02:40:29.340
and what score this threshold student would achieve on the two point items

02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:37.260
panelists made two rounds of judgments with discussion between round one and round two

02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:47.500
at the end of round two each select panelists from all six grade level groups also participated in a

02:40:47.500 --> 02:40:54.940
vertical articulation meeting which allowed the panelists across the grade levels and grade spans

02:40:54.940 --> 02:41:00.780
grade spans to confirm the alignment of these threshold definitions

02:41:02.460 --> 02:41:09.100
that was a simplified overview of the approach and does not fully convey the depth

02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:13.820
of the content and conversations that occurred at that meeting

02:41:14.620 --> 02:41:22.380
the panel judgments are presented in tables one and two of attachment five of this item

02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:32.380
after the cd's review of the panelists judgments the cde consulted with members of our lpac technical

02:41:32.380 --> 02:41:39.660
advisory group our assessment interest holder group and the state and federal program director

02:41:39.660 --> 02:41:47.340
these reviews resulted in minor adjustments to the panel's judgments and yielded the proposed

02:41:47.340 --> 02:41:54.220
state superintendent of public instructions recommendations provided in attachment for

02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.940
table one and table two

02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:07.980
the data for this slide is the data for the two point and two point items

02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:16.460
the data for this slide and the next includes all students who were administered the alternate lpac

02:42:16.460 --> 02:42:24.300
operational field test the slide includes the proposed threshold scores and impact data

02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:31.020
for the initial alternate lpac during the process of establishing threshold scores

02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:38.620
we use a temporary standard setting scale shown here in the far two right hand columns

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:47.260
for following the state board of education approval these thresholds will be applied

02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:55.020
to the reporting scales which are the values that will be presented on our student score reports

02:42:55.100 --> 02:43:01.980
the threshold scores were applied to all items in the field test item pool for both the initial

02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:11.260
alternate lpac and the summative alternate lpac test forms to maintain the fidelity of the with

02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:17.900
the work of the standard setting panel the state superintendent of public instructions recommended

02:43:17.980 --> 02:43:26.780
recommended thresholds are within two conditional standard errors of measurement of the panel's

02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:37.660
recommendations that is all adjustments are within the natural area variance around the panel's

02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:46.220
recommended thresholds and therefore reflect only slight modifications to of their judgments

02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:54.140
the initial alternate lpac will be administered to eligible students for the first time beginning

02:43:54.140 --> 02:44:05.820
july of 2022 as a reminder this is a snapshot using student performance on this year's operational

02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:13.660
field test the student performance when the initial alternate lpac is administered may differ from

02:44:13.980 --> 02:44:21.420
these percentages on the slide and may change over time given that the eligible initial students

02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:28.380
are a much smaller subset of the group that was administered the operational field test

02:44:33.020 --> 02:44:38.540
next are the state superintendent of public instructions recommended thresholds for the

02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:45.340
summative alternate lpac which are the same as those for the initial

02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:54.780
except that the grade 9 through 12 threshold for the initial alternate lpac were split into two

02:44:54.780 --> 02:45:03.980
grade spans 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 the thresholds were then applied to the students within those

02:45:03.980 --> 02:45:11.980
grades who took the alternate lpac field test and resulted in the values in the last two rows

02:45:11.980 --> 02:45:13.980
of this table on the slide

02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:26.140
okay upon the state board of education's approval of the alternate lpac threshold scores the cde

02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:32.540
will notify the superintendents and charter school administrators of the approved thresholds

02:45:32.540 --> 02:45:41.180
and student score reports the cde will then conduct a quality control process to evaluate

02:45:41.740 --> 02:45:48.700
the data and ensure that the information on the summative alternate lpac student score reports

02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:57.580
or ssrs is being reported accurately if all goes well the ssrs will be delivered to lea's to share

02:45:57.580 --> 02:46:06.060
with parents and guardians at the end of july this year lastly as was done for the general lpac

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:15.580
two separate threshold validation studies will be conducted in the 2020-22-23 academic year

02:46:15.580 --> 02:46:23.180
for the initial and summative alternate lpac more information on these studies will be provided

02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:27.020
to the state board of education when they become available

02:46:29.100 --> 02:46:34.620
and i am happy to answer any clarifying questions you may now have

02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:45.260
okay are there any clarifying questions yes member oaken um just these may be questions

02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:49.020
that you don't know the answer to but thank you for this by the way this is

02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:56.380
amazing work that's being done um i'm curious once this is implemented do we have a sense of

02:46:56.380 --> 02:47:01.180
how many students will be participating do we know that and then my second question is

02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:10.220
what were those students doing before um first of all um how many students do we have currently

02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:18.220
we have um that are taking the actual operational field test we have um just over 20 000 students

02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:28.140
that were registered to take and then for those that since we did not have an alternate english

02:47:28.140 --> 02:47:35.260
language proficiency assessment in place they would take a locally determined alternate assessment

02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:41.340
and they would use that information to determine services

02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:57.260
okay excellent i will turn it over to miss

02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:10.780
thank you tracy well we as i i mentioned earlier we will be in this section we will cover the

02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:16.780
casp and alpaca updates and i have sheryl here our chief deputy superintendent

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:34.540
good afternoon everyone it's 1202 uh again my name is sheryl cotton i am deputy superintendent

02:48:34.540 --> 02:48:37.980
of the instruction measurement and administration branch for cde

02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:45.740
and i will begin with casp and alpaca updates cas consists of smarter balance for english

02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:52.540
language arts and math mathematics tests the california science test or cast the california

02:48:52.540 --> 02:48:58.780
alternate assessment or caa for ela math and science and the california spanish assessment

02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:06.380
the alpaca consists of the initial alpaca summative alpaca and alternate alpaca operational

02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:13.020
field tests we just talked about next slide thank you we'd like to update you on the current status

02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:18.140
of testing administration and upcoming plans for state assessments the state assessment testing

02:49:18.140 --> 02:49:24.380
window runs from mid-january through mid-july lea select their testing window within the state

02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:30.860
window for their lea and their schools the selected testing window must end at the lea's

02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:35.580
last instructional day or by july 15 whichever comes first

02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:43.980
the every student succeeds act or essa requires all states to test at least 95 percent of all

02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:50.940
students and student groups in english language arts and literacy or ela in math and science

02:49:50.940 --> 02:49:56.860
it also requires states to factor the participation rate into their accountability systems which for

02:49:56.860 --> 02:50:04.460
california is the academic indicator as of monday may 16th the estimated statewide percentage of

02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:13.900
students who have completed cas testing are as follows smarter balanced ela 81 percent and math

02:50:13.900 --> 02:50:22.300
77 percent and 66 percent for cast are our california science assessment for the california

02:50:23.100 --> 02:50:30.540
alternate assessment i'm sorry for ela 61 percent for math 58 percent and for science 47 percent

02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:39.100
and for csa which is an optional test it's at 61 percent of those registered over 50,800 students

02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:45.180
are registered to take that test we're really excited about these numbers this shows a positive

02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:50.620
trend toward reaching the federal requirement of at least 95 percent of students tested across the

02:50:50.620 --> 02:50:55.900
of students tested across the state so it's looking really good next slide please

02:50:57.660 --> 02:51:03.660
the lpac summative testing window ends on may 31st and as a reminder the initial lpac remains

02:51:03.660 --> 02:51:10.700
open until june 30th 2022 100 percent of all eligible english learners must be administered

02:51:12.300 --> 02:51:19.740
either the summative lpac or the alternate lpac operational field test as of monday may 16th

02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:24.460
the estimated statewide percentage of students who have completed lpac testing are as follows

02:51:25.420 --> 02:51:34.780
initial lpac 98 percent summative lpac 75 percent and alternate lpac operational field test 77

02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:42.540
percent again more good news now i'll hand it over to chief deputy mary nicely to provide an update

02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:48.540
on calpads upgrades and statewide testing and highlight key issues and some of our solutions

02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:49.740
thank you

02:51:56.140 --> 02:51:58.460
oops which one am i talking into this one

02:52:01.100 --> 02:52:09.020
good afternoon right now i don't speak to you as chief deputy mary nicely i speak to you as the

02:52:09.020 --> 02:52:15.100
branch deputy of the information technology branch so if you and so you may be wondering why am i

02:52:15.100 --> 02:52:21.980
doing this um because i have responsibility for all of our our technical services division

02:52:21.980 --> 02:52:28.460
our calpads division under edmd and our accountability and measurement branch

02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:36.300
which are all responsible along with mal in ensuring that we have accurate data reporting

02:52:36.300 --> 02:52:43.420
on our dashboards and can report back to you are the assessments and and keep the lights on

02:52:43.980 --> 02:52:50.940
and so some of you may have heard about a an upgrade to the calpads system which is

02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:56.220
over a decade old and had been managing literally hundreds of millions of records

02:52:57.100 --> 02:53:02.940
our lea's have been clamoring for an upgrade for many many years because some of these updates

02:53:02.940 --> 02:53:10.780
could take more than 48 hours we are really proud to be able to say that we have sped that up to a

02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:20.220
by 20 times and so we are able to process instead of in 48 hours 14 minutes the types of records and

02:53:20.220 --> 02:53:25.420
we have gone over a million records a day being processed now so we're really excited to be able

02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:31.580
to do that of course there's always hiccups as a programmer myself there's always hiccups when

02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:36.620
you're rolling out a new system and some of those hiccups unfortunately took place during testing

02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:42.940
but we're really glad to be working very closely with ets our contractor to ensure that those

02:53:43.900 --> 02:53:48.860
problems are met we have put together a cross-departmental team that is working

02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:57.980
endlessly overnight to ensure that we are addressing all of the technical issues

02:53:57.980 --> 02:54:04.380
and bug fixes which could have taken up to three weeks previously and we are knocking out about 38

02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:10.460
issues on a bi-weekly basis to get those things out and we're working really closely with our

02:54:10.460 --> 02:54:17.500
education partners with access SSC sba and our small school districts association so that they

02:54:17.500 --> 02:54:23.340
can see the progress that we're making and whether they want them or not they're getting our bug fix

02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:27.900
lists every night so that they can address the needs and the questions that the superintendents

02:54:27.900 --> 02:54:34.300
are facing so some of the things that we continue to have taking place manually is the processing

02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:43.500
manually of the ets data twice a week into the system and we've had some issues over a couple

02:54:43.500 --> 02:54:52.220
of days which i think are being remedied now with just a capacity issue prior to covid schools would

02:54:52.220 --> 02:54:59.420
have to schedule in a lab to have kids come in and take a test now the silver lining of covid was

02:54:59.420 --> 02:55:05.580
one-to-one computing devices the downside of that is that now everyone can flip open their

02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:11.980
their laptop and their chromebook and start taking a test which i think hit some capacity

02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:18.700
issues with our test our contractor they have reached i think at the maximum was

02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:25.820
about close to 500 million or 500 000 on may 3rd and so they've been doing some

02:55:25.900 --> 02:55:33.100
load balancing capacity for that and can now take up to 2 million users concurrently so we continue

02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:41.340
to work with ets and communicate regularly with test coordinators and it departments to let them

02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:46.620
know where we are we've got alerts going out we've they've got web pages that are up with statuses

02:55:46.620 --> 02:55:51.020
so i just wanted to let you know at this point we're working this is a top priority of the

02:55:51.100 --> 02:55:56.700
department to ensure the smooth running of testing and as cheryl said we're excited to see that our

02:55:56.700 --> 02:56:02.620
numbers are actually higher than pre-covid for some of our testing and assessments at this point

02:56:02.620 --> 02:56:08.140
and we're keeping a close eye on any of those lea's that are having any kind of difficulty

02:56:08.140 --> 02:56:16.540
getting in and being able to reach those 95 thresholds right now we are looking at

02:56:17.420 --> 02:56:23.020
last week we already had our first wildfire in orange county so we're looking at that we are

02:56:23.020 --> 02:56:29.340
dealing with some issues with some cyber security on some of our other lea's and so we're working

02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:36.060
very closely to to manage those and keep an eye on those situations with our data so that is an

02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:40.860
update and if you want we'll put you on that mailing list so you can get those technical updates

02:56:40.860 --> 02:56:42.940
from us as well so thank you

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:56.620
thank you mary thank you cheryl for providing that update that's very helpful i know that we're in

02:56:56.620 --> 02:57:02.300
the thick of testing and it's always good to know that we're all coordinating and making sure that

02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:08.940
the local educational agency staff have what they need to continue with testing

02:57:10.060 --> 02:57:16.780
so we're going to provide another update with you in another little area

02:57:19.180 --> 02:57:24.780
in continuing with the updates we have an update on the smarter balanced

02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:33.180
demonstration of concept study so during the last two board meetings or so our division has

02:57:33.180 --> 02:57:37.980
been providing an overview and an update on the demonstration of concept study

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:45.420
and it is being conducted by smarter balance the assessment consortium in partnership with the

02:57:45.420 --> 02:57:53.900
teacher the new teacher center ntc and this is the first year that we're doing this one it's

02:57:53.900 --> 02:58:01.580
an initial look at how performance tasks can be effectively incorporated into classroom

02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:08.060
instruction and it begins to build a knowledge base about the possible use of embedded performance

02:58:08.060 --> 02:58:14.940
tasks as part of a large-scale assessment a summative assessment so specifically this

02:58:14.940 --> 02:58:23.100
study aims to answer basic questions like can the p performance task pt stands for performance task

02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:29.420
be administered flexibly during the school year aligned with the local contacts and can

02:58:29.420 --> 02:58:36.460
a support activity better prepare students for the cognitive demands of the performance task

02:58:37.260 --> 02:58:42.540
and what support and development do teachers need to gather and analyze critical information

02:58:42.540 --> 02:58:49.420
to inform improve and accelerate student learning so these are the basis for this study and these

02:58:49.420 --> 02:59:01.660
are some of the questions we're trying to ask and find out so um well we the performance task

02:59:01.660 --> 02:59:07.340
use for this year's study came from our english language arts and mathematics smarter balance

02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:15.020
interim assessments and we do have two i mentioned before the but i will say them again because they

02:59:15.100 --> 02:59:23.100
are wonderful local educational agencies that is participating and that is upper lake unified

02:59:23.100 --> 02:59:28.700
and valverde unified so you know on behalf if they're listening or watching on behalf of the

02:59:28.700 --> 02:59:34.140
cde we really like to extend our gratitude to these two local educational agencies for their

02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:40.460
participation and commitment to this study because they will help us learn and a total there was a

02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:45.740
total of 63 teachers from these two local educational agencies that participated

02:59:45.740 --> 02:59:52.940
they represented grades four five six and high school and since march teachers have

02:59:54.700 --> 03:00:00.940
attended the professional sessions learning sessions that were brought to them and then

03:00:00.940 --> 03:00:08.140
they also implemented a performance task support activity and they also administered and scored

03:00:08.140 --> 03:00:15.020
interim assessment performance tasks and planned instruction based on data that they gather from

03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:21.260
the student performance and during the professional learning sessions the participants did share

03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:27.740
information including their students responses from the classroom activities and feedback from

03:00:27.740 --> 03:00:37.420
teachers were also about regarding student progress as a part of the analysis for the study

03:00:38.140 --> 03:00:44.460
so the administrators from each of the local educational agencies also participated in these

03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:50.860
professional learning sessions so it wasn't just teachers there was support from the top as well

03:00:51.500 --> 03:00:58.540
and a preliminary report including the benefits and challenges of the embed of embedding performance

03:00:58.540 --> 03:01:08.460
tasks into classroom instruction will be available in june 2022 so next month in a few weeks the

03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:14.060
preliminary report will reflect initial findings and recommendations for future research into

03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:22.300
implementing a through-year approach and then a final report which will include the additional

03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:33.580
analyses is expected in late summer so continuing on the preliminary evaluation of feedback and work

03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:43.020
from the participating teachers suggests that in part the support activity that preceded the

03:01:43.020 --> 03:01:48.380
performance task did help teachers find strategies that they can use to support their students

03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:57.500
toward greater success on performance on the performance task however more guidance

03:01:57.500 --> 03:02:04.540
for teachers is needed on how to support students as they transition from the collaborative nature

03:02:04.540 --> 03:02:12.060
or structure of support of the support activity to the independent work of the actual performance

03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:19.740
task so the integration of the formative assessment process was seen throughout this study

03:02:20.300 --> 03:02:29.260
and used by teachers and they indicated that was useful to inform instruction so again

03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:33.500
further details about the findings and recommendations from the preliminary report

03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:39.820
will be presented we believe we could bring this to the state board at its july meeting to give you

03:02:39.820 --> 03:02:41.420
further update and more detail

03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:50.780
right so we're flying i know i'm right between lunch so i'm gonna zip through some of this

03:02:52.380 --> 03:02:58.620
okay so another little update for you because we do many exciting things in assessment it's not

03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:07.180
just it's not just testing we provide just an update about the 2022-23 california educator

03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:13.420
reporting system trainings so we have this california educator reporting system and we're

03:03:13.420 --> 03:03:18.540
going to provide these trainings throughout the year they're really two to three hours trainings

03:03:18.540 --> 03:03:24.060
because soon we're going to roll out the scores of all the students testing this spring into this

03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:30.380
educator reporting system so they'll be able to have it readily available to them so these

03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:35.420
separate sessions are designed for two audiences we'll have one for our assessment coordinators

03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:42.060
and administrators and then one for teachers and others who have similar staff roles so that they

03:03:42.060 --> 03:03:49.100
could best utilize the system and then we will record them we will make them available for

03:03:49.660 --> 03:03:58.060
them to go back and and utilize or view them and then registration is open now just a little

03:03:58.780 --> 03:04:07.500
plug in there the interim assessment formative assessment trainings the series is also happening

03:04:07.500 --> 03:04:14.460
these are really three hour online assessment training sessions for teachers and this summer

03:04:15.660 --> 03:04:20.300
we're inviting local educational agency staff to come to this

03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:29.820
and I'm sorry it's also in the fall as well and there's three modules module one module two module

03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:36.060
three module one engages or uses the formative assessment process and the tools for teachers

03:04:36.060 --> 03:04:44.940
website to support or boost instruction and then model module two gauges student progress with the

03:04:44.940 --> 03:04:50.860
smarter balance interim assessments and all the other various online systems that support

03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:57.420
the interim assessments then in module three uses hand scoring to analyze written responses

03:04:57.420 --> 03:05:03.260
using expect understanding expectations and determining instructional next steps

03:05:05.020 --> 03:05:11.900
for that module and then again they're going to be recorded and made available and we have that

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:18.220
registration open as well our science instructional resources so with the tools

03:05:18.220 --> 03:05:26.380
for teachers we're able to build as we've shared with you in our updates build additional science

03:05:26.380 --> 03:05:32.940
instructional resources for the for teachers and embed it into that same system tools for teachers

03:05:34.380 --> 03:05:41.340
so we've completed four workshops and 59 science instructional resources are available

03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:47.340
just want to let you know that this july we will conduct another in-person workshop in sacramento

03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:58.140
and we're going to plan on developing 15 additional resources so let me see and of course

03:05:58.940 --> 03:06:02.540
one of the highlights is that these there are

03:06:02.540 --> 03:06:11.980
our five experienced resource developers who are science leads and then you know the other

03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:17.900
15 educators will also will act as the developers of the resources so they're really built by

03:06:18.460 --> 03:06:25.820
california educators for california educators and of course our cde staff will also work as

03:06:25.820 --> 03:06:32.220
trainers and assist and coach the educators in their development process and they will receive

03:06:32.220 --> 03:06:38.940
that same peer review process that was used in the previous workshop so that the resources

03:06:38.940 --> 03:06:43.420
are vetted very well and they'll be available this fall that is gold

03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:52.220
again we continue to work with the smarter balance assessment consortium because we are part of the

03:06:52.220 --> 03:07:00.380
consortium and this summer there are two workshops held in july for members of our state network of

03:07:00.380 --> 03:07:13.340
educators what they call our snes or sneeze to develop over 150 ele okay that was mathematics

03:07:13.340 --> 03:07:19.180
instructional resources for the tools for teachers oh you you guys needed a little pick me up anyway

03:07:19.900 --> 03:07:27.260
so one exciting thing i want to share with you is that smarter balance is expanding development

03:07:27.260 --> 03:07:33.260
into including english language arts resources for kindergarten through grade two so that's a

03:07:33.260 --> 03:07:41.100
new thing we're doing and there are about 80 educators from about 23 23 of them are from

03:07:41.100 --> 03:07:46.140
california they're going to help with this development and then of course our staff will

03:07:46.140 --> 03:07:54.060
also be on the leadership team to help with the development as well and and that is exciting i

03:07:54.060 --> 03:08:01.580
think we're going to oregon for that so all right so i'm gonna stop talking because i think i always

03:08:01.580 --> 03:08:11.660
say too much um and i'm gonna hand it over to my very capable julie williams she is our consultant

03:08:11.660 --> 03:08:18.700
and single-handedly really um coordinate all of the national and international assessments for

03:08:19.260 --> 03:08:21.260
california would you like me to

03:08:24.940 --> 03:08:31.340
greetings president darling ham and esteemed board members and chief deputy nicely it is an

03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:37.420
honor to present this update to you today i'll try to keep it very brief uh seeing as the time

03:08:38.220 --> 03:08:46.540
uh yes thank you so um the national and international assessments in which california

03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:53.820
schools participate include the following the national assessment of educational progress or

03:08:53.820 --> 03:09:01.180
nape also known as the nation's report card the international computer and information

03:09:01.180 --> 03:09:08.700
literacy study which some call icils i just call it icils because that's easy okay the progress

03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:15.340
in international reading literacy study or pearls the program for international student assessment

03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:22.300
or pisa my favorite and the trends in international mathematics and science study or tims so

03:09:22.940 --> 03:09:27.740
i'm going to refer to them by their acronyms from here moving forward these assessments are all

03:09:27.740 --> 03:09:33.580
coordinated through the u.s department of education's national center for education

03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:40.940
statistics or the nces and the cd's assessment development and administration division

03:09:40.940 --> 03:09:49.420
or me and um they are all administered by field staff that contract with the ncs schools do not

03:09:49.420 --> 03:09:58.860
have to administrate these tests themselves at present okay this slide shows a brief overview

03:09:58.860 --> 03:10:08.700
of all these assessments that were conducted in 2021-22 in california schools so nape is the

03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:17.260
largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what u.s students know and can do

03:10:17.260 --> 03:10:28.060
in various subjects it was mandated by congress in 1969 for 2022 approximately 430 california

03:10:28.060 --> 03:10:34.860
schools out of 10 000 participated in nape representing the diversity of california and

03:10:34.860 --> 03:10:43.020
the nation about 50 students per school were randomly selected to take the nape in a single

03:10:43.020 --> 03:10:51.100
subject and over 20 000 california students took nape this year nape takes students about two hours

03:10:51.100 --> 03:10:58.780
to complete and all of these assessments as well as subject matter content a student is offered

03:10:58.780 --> 03:11:05.740
a short survey of their educational experiences and this provides rich contextual data

03:11:05.740 --> 03:11:11.820
that we can correlate with student scores so between january and march of this year

03:11:11.820 --> 03:11:19.020
nape conducted the following grade four and eight math and reading to be reported at the national

03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:26.460
state and large district level there are 30 large districts that participate in california

03:11:27.100 --> 03:11:34.540
it has slimmed down to just two districts los angeles and san diego unified fresno unified

03:11:34.540 --> 03:11:40.540
dropped out of that district level program this year these results allow us to compare

03:11:40.540 --> 03:11:47.660
achievement trends over time and between jurisdictions participation is required for

03:11:47.660 --> 03:11:55.820
schools in districts that accept title one funds grade eight civics and u.s history to be reported

03:11:55.820 --> 03:12:04.220
at the national level only and age nine long-term trend math and reading assessments to be reported

03:12:04.220 --> 03:12:11.180
at the national level only so nape 22 results will be released as the nation's report card

03:12:11.820 --> 03:12:20.700
by early 2023 i'm hearing late october 22 perhaps that will be determined by the national assessment

03:12:20.700 --> 03:12:29.100
governing board next we have the field test for isles so isles is an international assessment of

03:12:29.100 --> 03:12:35.260
grade eight computer and information literacy administered every five years since 2013

03:12:36.540 --> 03:12:44.300
isles 2023 will draw students from over 30 countries and results from this and all the

03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:50.940
other international assessments are used by researchers and policymakers to inform discussions

03:12:50.940 --> 03:12:57.260
of international competitiveness isles takes students about three and a half hours to complete

03:12:58.220 --> 03:13:05.260
in april last month isles conducted a field test to inform the development of the assessment

03:13:05.260 --> 03:13:13.740
and fewer than 10 california schools participated in this isles field test approximately 30 will be

03:13:13.740 --> 03:13:22.220
selected for isles 2023 pearls is an international assessment of grade four reading literacy that's

03:13:22.220 --> 03:13:31.660
administered every five years since 2001 the fall 2021 pearls administration drew students from over

03:13:31.660 --> 03:13:39.100
50 countries pearls take students about three hours to complete and the number of california

03:13:39.180 --> 03:13:47.900
schools participating in pearls 2021 was 14 results for that will be out probably early 2023

03:13:48.940 --> 03:13:55.740
a field test for pisa so pisa is an international assessment of 15 year olds

03:13:56.460 --> 03:14:03.100
that measures how well they apply their knowledge and skills in reading mathematics science and

03:14:03.100 --> 03:14:10.780
financial literacy it's administered every three years since 2000 with over 80 countries

03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:17.340
participating this assessment takes students about four hours including breaks to complete

03:14:18.300 --> 03:14:26.300
in late september 2021 pisa conducted a field test to inform the development of the assessment

03:14:26.380 --> 03:14:32.140
and fewer than 10 schools participated in that field test will have about 30

03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:41.500
for pisa 2022 coming up this fall a field test for tims tims an international math and science

03:14:41.500 --> 03:14:48.060
assessment administered in grades four and eight administered every four years since 1995 with over

03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:54.380
65 countries participating this assessment takes students about three hours including breaks to

03:14:54.380 --> 03:15:02.380
complete in spring 2022 tims conducted a field test to determine whether questions are biased

03:15:02.380 --> 03:15:08.940
because of national social or cultural differences and to confirm that field operations work as

03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:14.140
intended fewer than 10 california schools participated in the field test for tims

03:15:14.140 --> 03:15:24.860
next slide please follow us on twitter everybody okay and uh next slide please

03:15:26.780 --> 03:15:32.380
i am happy to answer any clarifying questions you may have now

03:15:33.900 --> 03:15:37.100

that the california state board of education approve the following the 2021-22 school year

03:16:35.100 --> 03:16:40.700
per pupil apportionment rates for the california assessment of student performance and progress

03:16:40.700 --> 03:16:47.020

this was easier than i thought it might be we could have maybe finished before lunch but

03:19:06.140 --> 03:19:11.820
here we are we've got any other uh discussion i do have one just kind of

03:19:12.620 --> 03:19:18.380
point of clarification it was interesting to hear that smarter balance is looking at the k2 space

03:19:19.020 --> 03:19:28.140
and i just want to be mindful of the fact that we are now with tk revising the preschool learning

03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:35.500
foundations and developing a seamless strategy up through grade three so we would definitely

03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:39.740
want to start to think about how those things are are coming together

03:19:42.300 --> 03:19:47.660
yes were you raising your hand i was not but you were okay

03:19:50.140 --> 03:19:52.860
i i really need i really need the zoom thing back

03:19:56.220 --> 03:19:59.900
member arusco gonzalez you have a question you guys are getting silly

03:20:02.380 --> 03:20:07.900
we're giddy because we had sugar now so we had the sugar yeah um i just want my comments just

03:20:08.380 --> 03:20:15.660
the smarter balance plans to host the 80 educators as a resource authors for workshops i personally

03:20:16.220 --> 03:20:21.740
was trained in 2013 from smarter balance and some of those resources that i use now

03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:28.780
are quite rigorous and a great opportunity i looked through your tools for teachers and saw

03:20:28.780 --> 03:20:36.060
a few exemplary performance tests that i thought were great for tool for teachers to to engage

03:20:36.060 --> 03:20:40.540
students into meaningful activities in their classroom and i think it's a great start so

03:20:41.260 --> 03:20:44.940
my comment is just a positive one that i think they're in the right direction when it comes

03:20:44.940 --> 03:20:49.820
to performance tasks and opportunities for teachers to get training and what i really

03:20:49.820 --> 03:20:54.780
appreciate is that we go into the direction of teacher-led workshops where teachers then

03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:59.500
go back to their school sites or their districts and then share some of this knowledge so thank you

03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:08.940
for that is there if there's no is there any other discussion or questions if there is oh

03:21:08.940 --> 03:21:15.500
okay member rodriguez um i just have a comment about the the tasks and the process with the

03:21:15.500 --> 03:21:21.420
teachers and i i really appreciate that i appreciate um especially i think the mind

03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:27.580
shift that needs to happen from teaching to the test to teaching how to think and how to process

03:21:27.580 --> 03:21:35.100
information which is you know a shift that is so necessary in our educational system these days

03:21:35.100 --> 03:21:41.340
so thank you for that all right we will hear more i think in potentially in july about the

03:21:41.900 --> 03:21:46.540
proof of concept also that's going on with the performance tests in the classroom so

03:21:47.180 --> 03:21:51.820
we'll look forward to that and if there's no other discussion i'd love to see if there's a motion

03:21:52.780 --> 03:21:59.260
to adopt the recommendations i motion that we adopt thank you very much is there a second

03:22:01.260 --> 03:22:04.540

of a request for determination of funding with reasonable wait did i that's it yeah

03:24:17.020 --> 03:24:21.420
the determination of funding with reasonable basis mitigating circumstances as required for

03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:27.580
non-classroom-based charter schools and cde recommends that the state board deny

03:24:28.300 --> 03:24:33.180
sierra foothill charters mitigating circumstances request and approve the determination of funding

03:24:33.180 --> 03:24:40.140
request at 70 funding for two years as provided in attachment one the item will be presented by

03:24:40.140 --> 03:24:50.460
stephanie farland and mccain ahuey of the cde please begin good afternoon president darling

03:24:50.460 --> 03:24:56.380
hammon vice president glover woods and members of the state board executive director alan

03:24:58.460 --> 03:25:02.700
we're happy to be in person today today we are

03:25:05.980 --> 03:25:10.060
going to talk a little bit about determination of funding funding requests for non-classroom-based

03:25:10.060 --> 03:25:19.660
schools and we have some new members so we're going to go over a little background and context

03:25:20.700 --> 03:25:27.660
for these items so prior to jumping into the details of the of this item some background on

03:25:27.660 --> 03:25:36.140
the statute surrounding determination of funding requests so pursuant to education code 4761 2.5

03:25:36.140 --> 03:25:42.060
d1 a charter school that has an approved charter may receive funding for its non-classroom-based

03:25:42.060 --> 03:25:47.900
instruction only if a determination for funding is made by the california state board of education

03:25:48.620 --> 03:25:53.020
a determination of funding is required in order for charter schools to receive funding for their

03:25:53.020 --> 03:26:01.260
non-classroom-based average daily ada average daily attendance if their classroom-based ada

03:26:01.260 --> 03:26:07.980
falls below or is anticipated to fall below 80 percent of its total ada so this is not something

03:26:07.980 --> 03:26:12.220
that all charter schools have to do it's just those charter schools whose non-classroom-based

03:26:12.220 --> 03:26:17.340
ada fall below the 80 threshold which we're going to describe in just a few minutes

03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:23.260
just to give some context uh for the new board members and for the board members who have been

03:26:23.260 --> 03:26:28.140
here for a while and don't add it up in their own minds over what's happened over the last five years

03:26:29.420 --> 03:26:37.980
the cde notes that from january 2017 to march 2022 the state board has heard 540

03:26:38.540 --> 03:26:44.860
determination of funding requests of those 540 funding determination requests 81

03:26:45.020 --> 03:26:49.980
40 funding determination requests 81 have included the consideration of mitigating

03:26:49.980 --> 03:26:55.500
circumstances which is the type of funding requests we're hearing today a funding request

03:26:55.500 --> 03:27:05.580
with mitigating circumstances and so for some context the board has approved 97 percent of

03:27:05.580 --> 03:27:14.060
funding determinations at the 100 level so really close to 100 this board has been

03:27:15.500 --> 03:27:22.380
has approved funding determination request at 100 97 percent of those that are mitigating

03:27:22.380 --> 03:27:30.140
circumstance funding requests have also been approved by the board so and and also just to

03:27:30.140 --> 03:27:35.100
add some context the state board has also denied a school's mitigating circumstances request

03:27:35.100 --> 03:27:42.540
based on its high reserves before so this is not an unusual or unique circumstance that we're

03:27:42.540 --> 03:27:48.460
bringing forth today so the process

03:27:51.100 --> 03:27:55.660
for the funding review and recommendation process so pursuant to california code of

03:27:55.660 --> 03:28:01.980
regulations title five section one one nine six three point four the cde reviews the determination

03:28:01.980 --> 03:28:08.380
of funding requests and develops a recommendation on the request and if necessary we will ask for

03:28:08.460 --> 03:28:17.260
additional information which you will hear in this presentation we did so in this case

03:28:18.140 --> 03:28:21.900
the cde presents its recommendation to the advisory commission on charter schools

03:28:22.460 --> 03:28:26.940
the accs considers the information presented it makes its own recommendation to the state

03:28:26.940 --> 03:28:34.940
board of ed both the cde and accs's recommendations are presented to the sbe and you will hear both

03:28:34.940 --> 03:28:41.660
today so as we move to describing the criteria and all of the details for the funding

03:28:41.660 --> 03:28:46.140
determination i'm going to pass it over to mckenna huey who oversees the funding

03:28:46.140 --> 03:28:48.860
determination request in the charter schools division

03:28:52.940 --> 03:28:57.420
good afternoon um my name is mckenna huey as stephanie farland just stated

03:28:57.900 --> 03:29:05.420
um so going into the criteria for determination of funding education code section four seven six

03:29:05.420 --> 03:29:11.180
three four point two a one specifies that the state board shall adopt regulations setting forth

03:29:11.180 --> 03:29:16.620
criteria for the determination of funding for non-costing based instruction and at a minimum

03:29:16.620 --> 03:29:22.060
the regulation shall specify that the non-costing based instruction is conducted for the instructional

03:29:22.060 --> 03:29:27.900
benefit of pupils and is substantially dedicated to that function in determining the amount of

03:29:27.900 --> 03:29:33.020
funding to be allocated to a charter school the state board shall consider the amount of the

03:29:33.020 --> 03:29:37.580
charter school's total budget that was expended on certificated employee salaries and benefits

03:29:38.380 --> 03:29:44.140
on school sites the teacher to people ratio in the school and any other factors that it deems

03:29:44.140 --> 03:29:44.780
appropriate

03:29:48.300 --> 03:29:55.900
pursuant to education code section four seven six three four point two a four for the 2003 2004

03:29:55.900 --> 03:30:00.860
fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter the amount of funding determined by the state board

03:30:00.860 --> 03:30:05.260
shall be not more than 70 percent of the unadjusted amount to which a charter school

03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:09.740
would otherwise be entitled unless the state board determines that a greater or lesser amount

03:30:09.740 --> 03:30:13.340
is appropriate based on the criteria specified on the previous slide

03:30:17.340 --> 03:30:22.300
so california code of regulations title five section one one nine six three point four a

03:30:22.300 --> 03:30:25.900
provides a criteria that shall guide the process of reviewing and developing a

03:30:25.900 --> 03:30:30.780
recommendation on determination of funding requests pursuant to this section a charter

03:30:30.780 --> 03:30:37.500
school requesting a determination of funding may qualify for either 185 70 or zero percent

03:30:38.300 --> 03:30:42.940
the following table outlines the criteria for the different levels of funding and to qualify

03:30:42.940 --> 03:30:47.900
for a proposed recommendation of 100 funding a non-classroom based charter school must meet

03:30:47.900 --> 03:30:53.180
the following criteria they must spend at least 40 percent of the school's public revenues on

03:30:53.180 --> 03:30:57.820
salaries and benefits for their certificated employees spend at least 80 percent of all

03:30:57.820 --> 03:31:03.420
revenues on instruction related services and maintain a people to teacher ratio of 25 to one

03:31:07.980 --> 03:31:13.340
california code of regulations title five section one one nine six three point four e permits the

03:31:13.340 --> 03:31:18.380
finding of a reasonable basis or mitigating circumstance by which to make a recommendation

03:31:18.380 --> 03:31:22.540
other than one that results from the specified expenditure criteria on the previous slide

03:31:23.340 --> 03:31:28.700
so specifically other information provided by the charter school on the funding determination form

03:31:28.700 --> 03:31:33.820
such as the charter school's contracts governing board members and reserves or documented data

03:31:33.820 --> 03:31:39.660
regarding individual circumstances of the charter school such as one-time expenses may be considered

03:31:44.060 --> 03:31:50.860
so this item oh sorry this item consists of a request for determination of funding with

03:31:50.860 --> 03:31:55.820
reasonable basis mitigating circumstances from sierra foothill charter which is a classroom

03:31:55.820 --> 03:32:00.620
based charter school now typically funding determination requests are not submitted by

03:32:00.620 --> 03:32:05.660
classroom based charter schools as their classroom based ada remains well above the 80 percent of

03:32:05.660 --> 03:32:11.500
their total ada however the cde does recommend that classroom based charter schools submit a

03:32:11.500 --> 03:32:16.620
funding determination request if they are near the 80 percent threshold or if they anticipate

03:32:16.620 --> 03:32:21.740
that their classroom based ada will fall below the 80 percent threshold to prevent interruptions to

03:32:21.740 --> 03:32:25.980
the school's funding should the school's classroom based ada decreased unexpectedly

03:32:26.940 --> 03:32:31.260
our funding determination has no positive or negative impact to a classroom based charter

03:32:31.260 --> 03:32:36.940
school's funding if it remains above the 80 percent classroom based ada threshold the purpose of the

03:32:36.940 --> 03:32:42.060
funding determination is really to just allow the charter school that has less than 80 percent

03:32:42.060 --> 03:32:46.380
classroom based ada to receive funding for its non-classroom based ada

03:32:47.260 --> 03:32:55.100
so a little bit of background as previously stated education code 47612.5 does state that a

03:32:55.100 --> 03:32:59.820
charter school that offers non-classroom based instruction may receive funding for that instruction

03:32:59.820 --> 03:33:05.420
only if it has an approved funding determination from the state board however senate bill 820

03:33:05.420 --> 03:33:13.500
section 75 modified this process for fiscal year 21-22 and exempted and exempted schools with the

03:33:13.500 --> 03:33:18.940
funding determination that expires on june 30th 2022 from the requirement to obtain an approved

03:33:18.940 --> 03:33:24.220
funding determination rather these existing charter schools automatically receive their current

03:33:24.220 --> 03:33:28.700
level of funding for two years upon their submission of a complete and timely funding

03:33:28.700 --> 03:33:33.900
determination request their funding determination requests do not require approval by the state

03:33:33.900 --> 03:33:39.580
board so this school that we're hearing today cr foothill charter does not have an active funding

03:33:39.580 --> 03:33:44.860
determination that expires on june 30th 2022 and is thus required to obtain an approved funding

03:33:44.860 --> 03:33:48.860
determination from the state board which is why we are presenting this item today

03:33:55.420 --> 03:34:02.380
so pursuant to a california code of regulations title 51963.4 a charter school requesting a

03:34:02.380 --> 03:34:06.780
determination of funding may qualify for either 70 85 or 80 percent of the funding

03:34:06.780 --> 03:34:14.060
may qualify for either 70 85 100 or 0 percent funding and again the criteria is outlined here

03:34:14.060 --> 03:34:19.980
on this table sierra foothill charter does not meet the expenditure requirements for a recommendation

03:34:19.980 --> 03:34:25.340
of 100 funding for its non-classroom based instruction per regulations the school

03:34:25.340 --> 03:34:31.980
qualifies for a 70 determination of funding as it reported spending 37.2 percent on

03:34:31.980 --> 03:34:37.500
certificated salaries and benefits and 74.9 percent on instruction and related services

03:34:41.900 --> 03:34:45.980
so because it did not meet the expenditure requirements sierra foothill charter did

03:34:45.980 --> 03:34:51.580
submit mitigating circumstances for consideration the school cited its receipt of approximately

03:34:51.580 --> 03:34:57.980
135 000 in s or three funding as a reason it did not meet the criteria for full funding

03:34:58.460 --> 03:35:03.260
without this one-time revenue the school would have met the requirements for 100 funding

03:35:06.860 --> 03:35:12.380
the cde does acknowledge that the s or funding that sierra foothill charter received was one time

03:35:12.380 --> 03:35:17.580
in nature and was a unique or exceptional expense and does constitute a mitigating circumstance

03:35:18.140 --> 03:35:24.540
however the cd notes that the school reported a total reserve of approximately 940 000 which

03:35:24.540 --> 03:35:30.380
makes up over 61 percent of the school's total expenditures additionally the cd notes that the

03:35:30.380 --> 03:35:39.340
school reported an average daily attendance of 122.26 for fiscal year 2021-22 pursuant to

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:46.780
california quota regulations reserves in excess of greater of 50 000 or five percent of total

03:35:46.780 --> 03:35:53.260
expenditures may be allowed for economic uncertainties or long-term expenditures such as capital projects

03:35:53.260 --> 03:35:58.220
if the excess reserves are satisfactorily explained when asked by the cde

03:35:58.220 --> 03:36:02.460
sierra foothill charter did not state any specific plans or their high reserves

03:36:08.700 --> 03:36:12.700
so sierra foothill charter failed to meet the regulatory expenditure requirements for a

03:36:12.700 --> 03:36:18.620
recommendation of 100 funding pursuant to regulations the school qualifies for 70

03:36:18.700 --> 03:36:22.860
funding for its non-cost and based instruction without the consideration of mitigating

03:36:22.860 --> 03:36:28.380
circumstances when considering requests for mitigating circumstances the cde takes into

03:36:28.380 --> 03:36:33.660
consideration not just the mitigating circumstances request but other information provided by the

03:36:33.660 --> 03:36:38.140
school on its funding determination form as well as information provided by the school and its

03:36:38.140 --> 03:36:43.820
follow-up communications with the cd pursuant to regulations which does state that the cd may ask

03:36:43.820 --> 03:36:47.820
a charter school to provide additional information in order to make possible a

03:36:47.820 --> 03:36:53.820
more detailed review or to develop a reasonable basis for a recommendation pursuant to regulations

03:36:53.820 --> 03:36:58.860
the cd considers other information provided by the charter school including its reserves

03:36:58.860 --> 03:37:02.700
when a school fails to meet the expenditure requirements for the recommendation for full

03:37:02.700 --> 03:37:08.220
funding unlike previously heard schools with large reserves sierra foothill charter did not

03:37:08.220 --> 03:37:13.740
articulate plans that would require additional funding above its existing robust reserve

03:37:14.620 --> 03:37:19.580
since this is since this request was presented to the accs at its april 12th meeting

03:37:19.580 --> 03:37:24.620
the cde has received no other communication from the school regarding its plan for its reserves

03:37:30.220 --> 03:37:34.380
as such the cd has determined that the information submitted by sierra foothill charter

03:37:34.380 --> 03:37:38.860
does not support its claim for mitigating circumstances while the school did obtain

03:37:38.860 --> 03:37:44.060
one-time revenue that impacted its expenditure percentages the school had a sizable reserve at

03:37:44.060 --> 03:37:48.140
its disposal that could have been sent spent on certificated salaries and benefits and

03:37:48.140 --> 03:37:53.260
instruction related services the cd does have concerns that sierra foothill charter spending

03:37:53.260 --> 03:37:57.340
patterns do not demonstrate that they are spending at adequate levels for the students that they serve

03:37:58.300 --> 03:38:01.500
i'm going to go ahead and turn it back to stephanie farland for our recommendation

03:38:05.260 --> 03:38:11.500
so as we stated earlier it is recommended that charter schools classroom-based charter schools

03:38:11.500 --> 03:38:19.020
who have who have a feeling a fear a projection that they might fall below that 80% threshold to

03:38:19.020 --> 03:38:24.220
submit a funding determination request sometimes we don't have to use them at all and in this case

03:38:25.020 --> 03:38:31.260
it's very likely that they won't have to use this one based on numbers that come in on their p2

03:38:31.740 --> 03:38:34.460
based on numbers that come in on their p2 so

03:38:37.340 --> 03:38:43.420
so moving forward i just wanted to reiterate that that they don't always use them the

03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:47.340
classroom-based charter schools we do it just in case so we don't want their funding to be

03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:52.380
interrupted or impacted negatively in any way but there's a very good there's a very good

03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:56.220
chance that this school will not even have to use this funding determination request

03:38:56.620 --> 03:39:01.500
um we are recommending the department is recommending today that the sbe deny

03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:04.700
sierra foothill charter is mitigating circumstances requests and approve their

03:39:04.700 --> 03:39:11.580
determination of funding at 70 for two years we do know that the school may submit a reconsideration

03:39:11.580 --> 03:39:17.340
request to seek a higher level of funding during the effective period of its funding determination

03:39:17.340 --> 03:39:23.740
pursuant to regulations so at any point in the next two years if indeed they do need to use it

03:39:24.380 --> 03:39:29.100
and they manage to meet the 80 threshold they certainly can come back for

03:39:30.380 --> 03:39:35.660
a reconsideration and we do have schools that do that here to the sb

03:39:39.420 --> 03:39:43.100
as stated earlier it did go to the advisory commission on charter schools

03:39:43.100 --> 03:39:49.180
at its april 12 2022 meeting the accs did not agree with the cv's recommendation instead moved

03:39:49.180 --> 03:39:54.060
to recommend that the sb approve sierra foothill charters mitigating circumstance request

03:39:54.060 --> 03:39:58.460
and approve their determination of funding request at 100 for two years that motion

03:39:58.460 --> 03:40:09.340
passed by a vote of six to one and that is our presentation so thank you thank you thank you

03:40:09.340 --> 03:40:14.780
so much stephanie and mckenna right now we're going to open the public uh the phone line for

03:40:14.780 --> 03:40:20.460
public comment and members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by

03:40:20.460 --> 03:40:26.140
calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now

03:40:26.940 --> 03:40:32.060
we will take in-person public comment on this item first so we ask members of the public who

03:40:32.060 --> 03:40:37.900
wish to provide comments to be ready to line up when your names are announced by sb staff

03:40:38.860 --> 03:40:47.020
uh while we're waiting um we will ask for uh some initial comments from member oaken

03:40:47.980 --> 03:40:52.540
on this item and i will make some comments as well before we go to public comment

03:40:57.500 --> 03:41:06.780
really i'm first okay um well um first of all thank you for your report and for the um

03:41:08.380 --> 03:41:15.820
for the explanation of sort of over the course of time what these determinations look like

03:41:15.820 --> 03:41:24.300
and um it's super helpful to get the history in the background um this was my first um advisory

03:41:24.300 --> 03:41:30.540
commission on charter schools meeting and so um it's really still trying to understand the players

03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:36.940
and um the rules and regulations um but i really appreciate the

03:41:39.420 --> 03:41:48.220
ongoing attempt to help me understand how this works um and um you know my understanding is

03:41:48.220 --> 03:41:55.660
it in in the time since this was first brought for a funding determination we haven't received

03:41:55.660 --> 03:42:03.340
any more information from the school is that is that correct that is that is correct and so um

03:42:06.940 --> 03:42:11.020
i'm gonna stop there for now um yeah i just um

03:42:14.220 --> 03:42:22.220
you know i i appreciate that in this time budgets are um complicated we don't always

03:42:22.220 --> 03:42:29.020
know how much funding we're going to receive when we have to pass our budgets um and that

03:42:29.020 --> 03:42:34.780
our first important rule is to try and get as much money as possible towards our students um and so i

03:42:34.780 --> 03:42:43.100
appreciate the continued efforts to understand what the mitigating circumstances and where how

03:42:43.100 --> 03:42:49.500
that money is going to be spent on kids in program um because at the at the heart of it that's what

03:42:49.500 --> 03:42:51.420
that's what we need to be doing so thank you

03:42:55.260 --> 03:43:01.020
and i'll just add my uh comments i also attended the accs meeting with member oaken

03:43:01.580 --> 03:43:08.220
and uh we'll say there was a robust conversation um as it relates to this particular item uh and

03:43:08.220 --> 03:43:15.180
again to underscore for my fellow board members that the funding determination request was made

03:43:15.740 --> 03:43:22.380
and cd did reach out for additional information as it relates to the reserves at that time and

03:43:23.180 --> 03:43:27.580
had not received information but i'm quite encouraged uh stephanie as you mentioned in

03:43:27.580 --> 03:43:34.860
your closing comment that they may not need the funding determination um at all but it's good to

03:43:35.660 --> 03:43:41.740
know that and i appreciate again the historical background that you provided on actions the

03:43:41.740 --> 03:43:48.540
board has taken in relation to these type of items uh so again a good conversation the

03:43:49.340 --> 03:43:54.060
information as of right now had not been received from the school for cde to

03:43:54.780 --> 03:44:00.300
make any further determinations if you will as it relates to their request

03:44:00.300 --> 03:44:17.180
um my question is since you met on april 12th um and the accs did not accept the cds

03:44:17.180 --> 03:44:22.300
recommendation my question is does the advisory commission um usually disregard the cds

03:44:22.300 --> 03:44:27.660
recommendation um i don't know if they disregarded it they just didn't agree

03:44:29.100 --> 03:44:35.980
but no i would say more often than not they they are in alignment but they certainly have their

03:44:35.980 --> 03:44:43.900
own opinions and and they come from various backgrounds and so um yeah they do not always

03:44:44.460 --> 03:44:50.220
agree with cd's recommendation okay just want to make sure i'm not familiar so thank you yeah

03:44:53.260 --> 03:44:59.580
any other uh it i'm sorry this is a procedural question is this i i got a little flummoxed

03:44:59.580 --> 03:45:03.340
because i wasn't sure if we were doing um public comment or clarifying questions

03:45:03.900 --> 03:45:09.420
well you do clarifying questions then we do public comment okay so i do have a clarifying question

03:45:10.060 --> 03:45:18.700
um which is um about um what um what you mentioned about not needing a potentially not

03:45:18.780 --> 03:45:24.860
needing a mitigating or a funding determination um can you explain that that's new information

03:45:25.420 --> 03:45:33.260
um i will try um yes i'm not in the funding division but um the way i understand it is that

03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:40.860
when they look at their p2 turn in their p2 numbers it could have changed um in terms of

03:45:40.860 --> 03:45:48.220
the funding the the ada could be back up above 80 percent so usually when these classroom-based

03:45:48.220 --> 03:45:53.180
schools uh submit a funding determination they're usually right on the fence

03:45:53.740 --> 03:45:58.780
um of thinking either we're going to dip below 80 or above or you know dip below 80 it's usually

03:45:58.780 --> 03:46:05.420
not by huge margins um and so by the time when they submit their funding determination to the

03:46:05.420 --> 03:46:15.180
time where they um submit their p2 uh ada figures it could change and so in this case um i don't

03:46:15.180 --> 03:46:21.100
have i don't i mean i can't confirm it but based on what i'm hearing is that they may not need to

03:46:21.100 --> 03:46:26.860
use it after all um because they're not no longer below the 80 threshold so they'll have to confirm

03:46:26.860 --> 03:46:33.020
that when in our sfsd division will confirm that when when um they release the the data that comes

03:46:33.020 --> 03:46:39.660
in for the p2s but it's um it's it's that that's why because it can change the ada changes from

03:46:39.660 --> 03:46:44.540
the time they submit their funding determination to the time that they confirm their p2 ada

03:46:45.260 --> 03:46:53.980
can i just ask a further question and um so um so the just to make sure i understand

03:46:56.220 --> 03:47:02.620
for a school that has both classroom-based and non-classroom-based um for a charter school that

03:47:02.620 --> 03:47:09.820
has both classroom-based and non-classroom-based instruction if the classroom-based instruction

03:47:10.380 --> 03:47:15.500
is more than 80 percent of their ada then they do not need a funding determination

03:47:15.500 --> 03:47:23.260
right 80 percent or more yes okay so and so this is i hope this is helpful for anyone else because

03:47:23.260 --> 03:47:32.620
it's making sense to me now and so um and so what may have changed is the ratio of their

03:47:32.620 --> 03:47:38.780
classroom-based program to their non-classroom-based program and then this funding determination would

03:47:38.780 --> 03:47:47.180
be moot because they would go with classroom-based apportionment yes funding got it okay thank you

03:47:47.740 --> 03:47:52.700
just add one other clarification we will nonetheless be voting on the original

03:47:52.700 --> 03:47:59.660
recommendation in case it is necessary and if there are no other clarifying questions

03:47:59.660 --> 03:48:05.260
we will go to public comment we have one in-person public comment i believe

03:48:05.900 --> 03:48:08.220
and then we'll go to on the phone public comment

03:48:17.340 --> 03:48:22.860
i think i got this microphone figured out i'm a pro now you could hire me before it good

03:48:22.860 --> 03:48:26.940
afternoon everybody i'm still michael juba representing the california teachers association

03:48:27.820 --> 03:48:32.220
cta would like to express our support for the cde's recommendation to deny

03:48:32.220 --> 03:48:37.980
sierra foothill charters mitigating circumstances request and approve the determination of funding

03:48:37.980 --> 03:48:43.900
requests at 70 percent funding for the next two years the cde as you heard clearly outlines in

03:48:43.900 --> 03:48:48.700
the item the rationale for this recommendation and they communicated with the charter to receive

03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:54.220
additional information as stated in the item there were many non-classroom-based charters that apply

03:48:54.220 --> 03:48:59.980
for funding determinations with large financial reserves and based on cde's due diligence in this

03:48:59.980 --> 03:49:05.580
matter it is clear that there is no basis to approve the mitigating circumstances and it is

03:49:05.580 --> 03:49:12.060
unclear why the commissioners of the accs would recommend overturning the cde's well

03:49:12.860 --> 03:49:19.020
reasoned recommendation so cta would recommend that the spe adopt the cde's recommendation on

03:49:19.020 --> 03:49:29.340
this item thank you we do we have one caller in the queue i will open the phone line now

03:49:30.780 --> 03:49:34.860
please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now you have one minute

03:49:37.820 --> 03:49:40.700
hello it's eric premack with the charter schools development center

03:49:41.740 --> 03:49:47.100
i'm not here to represent the school in question we actually don't know them very well and i'm very

03:49:47.100 --> 03:49:52.460
concerned that they may not understand the gravity of this because they're really a

03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:58.380
classroom-based school i'm here though because we're very concerned that cuts of this huge

03:49:58.380 --> 03:50:04.060
magnitude would send a signal to many other charter schools that they need to essentially

03:50:04.060 --> 03:50:10.620
dump a ton of money out of their budget and now in june 30 and that's a concern that i think the

03:50:10.620 --> 03:50:17.340
accs very much shared and very important to understand the gravity of the signaling that

03:50:17.340 --> 03:50:24.860
your votes on these items take and so for that reason we fully support the accs's recommendation

03:50:24.860 --> 03:50:30.540
notwithstanding our respect for the work that cde has done here thank you very much

03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:34.940
thank you okay that concludes public comment for item number four

03:50:36.060 --> 03:50:39.660
we'll turn to board discussion is there discussion of the item now

03:50:40.700 --> 03:50:49.740
yes thank you president darling hammon uh just wanted to uh bring forward a point i believe that

03:50:49.740 --> 03:50:55.100
was said during the presentation but to underscore for our our board members that

03:50:55.740 --> 03:51:04.460
in moving forward if the school does need to avail themselves of the funding determination

03:51:05.180 --> 03:51:14.220
and if the board were to approve or move to approve the cde recommendation the school does

03:51:14.220 --> 03:51:23.020
have the opportunity to come back and request the full funding 100 of the funding determination

03:51:23.020 --> 03:51:29.420
within that two-year period so just wanted to clarify that as we make a decision and

03:51:29.980 --> 03:51:35.660
however the board chooses to vote that the school does have the opportunity to come back if needed

03:51:36.140 --> 03:51:46.700
um is there other discussion yes member patio branson um just it's so striking that um the

03:51:46.700 --> 03:51:55.340
school did not reply to cde's uh opportunity to describe um other uses of the reserves and i think

03:51:55.340 --> 03:52:02.940
puts it in a pretty unique place um from the the types of determinations we've had to um

03:52:03.500 --> 03:52:09.100
make decisions on before um the only thing that i would just flag is um i just wonder if there's a

03:52:09.100 --> 03:52:15.580
way to um address the signaling issue um obviously that's not a board decision that's a communication

03:52:15.580 --> 03:52:24.460
issue um but that was raised by the call-in um person uh but otherwise i i think it's one of those

03:52:24.540 --> 03:52:34.780
but otherwise i i think it's one of those lack of of uh substantiation or response even i think

03:52:34.780 --> 03:52:42.220
just speaks volumes unfortunately and um that that sort of i think makes it pretty clear yeah

03:52:42.220 --> 03:52:52.540
and and they they didn't and and you know we we certainly we certainly don't um advocate getting

03:52:52.540 --> 03:52:57.500
rid of reserves for charter schools we know how important reserves are for charter schools um

03:52:58.140 --> 03:53:06.060
and i i take a little issue with the callers identifying it as dumping money out um you know

03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:11.260
that money is allocated to schools to use for students and teaching and learning so we would

03:53:11.260 --> 03:53:18.540
never advocate any charter school to dump money just to be able to get to 100 it certainly wasn't

03:53:18.540 --> 03:53:24.540
the case here we've had charters come up on these case on mitigating circumstance items before with

03:53:24.540 --> 03:53:30.220
large reserves and they had uses for those reserves that we took into consideration and approved

03:53:30.220 --> 03:53:37.500
them for 100 so it isn't a signal to the field that you can't have large reserves um it's a

03:53:37.500 --> 03:53:42.140
signal to the field that you should use lcff right the charter school non-classroom they should be

03:53:42.140 --> 03:53:46.780
using it appropriately um and if they find themselves in this circumstances mitigating

03:53:46.780 --> 03:53:52.620
circumstances we just need to have really just a reasonable reason as to why they have such high

03:53:52.620 --> 03:53:58.780
reserves um so yeah i i certainly wouldn't want that uh signal to go out to the field that the

03:53:58.780 --> 03:54:06.460
department or or the board doesn't believe in a strong reserve for for charter schools um and in

03:54:06.460 --> 03:54:13.420
this case uh you know we we didn't get and they didn't call in either so um i don't know if that

03:54:13.420 --> 03:54:19.740
just points to the fact that they think they'll probably not need it um but but yes there has

03:54:19.740 --> 03:54:26.780
there has been a lack of communication uh member escobedo and then member olken well i'd like to

03:54:26.780 --> 03:54:33.980
add that you know these funds obviously are needed to be used for student learning teaching and when

03:54:33.980 --> 03:54:42.780
i look at their own l cap and this is benchmarked from spring of 2021 43 percent of students aren't

03:54:42.780 --> 03:54:51.260
meeting standards 37 not meeting ela standards yet there's funds there to help students with

03:54:51.260 --> 03:55:01.020
tutoring to help students to perhaps some other modes of of of enhancing their learning or helping

03:55:01.020 --> 03:55:08.060
teachers enhance their practice as well i think the message is you know you have the resources

03:55:08.140 --> 03:55:14.620
use them for the purpose they're given to you and there is a need at that school

03:55:16.940 --> 03:55:18.060
thank you member olken

03:55:21.180 --> 03:55:26.220
this this was a a good learning experience for me in terms of um

03:55:28.700 --> 03:55:35.660
thinking about the way um funding really gets at our mission i guess you know it's they're so in

03:55:36.620 --> 03:55:46.060
so um deeply connected um and i would be remiss if i didn't say you know this is a time as a

03:55:46.060 --> 03:55:51.740
as a charter leader and i actually think for all public school leaders this has been a time where

03:55:51.740 --> 03:56:01.100
finances have been very unsure and we see districts across the state really struggling

03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:06.220
financially we see the instability that happens for teachers when that happens and the pink slips

03:56:06.220 --> 03:56:12.860
i mean it's a time i mean i'm really excited about the the budget news for next year because

03:56:12.860 --> 03:56:21.100
maybe we're turning a corner on it but i i think it is it's not surprising to me that schools would

03:56:21.100 --> 03:56:28.220
be trying to maintain some level of stability in these unstable times um that said i started by

03:56:28.220 --> 03:56:32.700
saying i think you know our budget is our is our mission statement or it's at least reflection of

03:56:32.700 --> 03:56:41.820
it and it it could be for um for seara foothill but because they haven't given us information

03:56:41.820 --> 03:56:48.300
about why they're um why they spent their money the way they did and we just are left guessing

03:56:49.580 --> 03:56:57.420
it it gives me pause and it was that information that i would need in order to um you know not

03:56:57.420 --> 03:57:04.940
in order to question the really great work of um the department of education um and we just

03:57:04.940 --> 03:57:12.700
didn't receive it and so i can't read tea leaves you know so anyway thank you any other discussion

03:57:12.700 --> 03:57:23.340
of the item all right uh do i have a motion i'll move the cds recommendation to deny seara foothill's

03:57:23.340 --> 03:57:32.620

decided to um commit to stanford so i'm really excited thank you um it's great to see everyone

04:01:13.500 --> 04:01:20.700
here in person finally um i really apologize for arriving late today i had my final ib test this

04:01:20.700 --> 04:01:28.700
morning um of course it was tons of fun as you all may guess um but i'm really happy to be here now

04:01:29.660 --> 04:01:35.340
um first of all i want to recognize teachers appreciation week which happened earlier this

04:01:35.340 --> 04:01:43.020
month um teachers are truly the foundation of our education system and i am so incredibly grateful

04:01:43.020 --> 04:01:49.580
for all of the teachers i've had not just this year but but throughout my educational career

04:01:49.580 --> 04:01:55.980
um they've always supported me they've always made sure that i understand even the difficult topics

04:01:57.100 --> 04:02:04.140
math um and and they even take time out of their days and that they're not even being paid and they

04:02:04.140 --> 04:02:09.900
you know support students and so um you know i just want to thank all of the teachers across our great

04:02:09.900 --> 04:02:16.140
state um for all that you guys do um continuing with the theme of shout outs i want to shout out

04:02:16.140 --> 04:02:22.780
niomi porter um who was recently appointed by governor newsome to be next year's student

04:02:22.780 --> 04:02:30.140
board member on this board uh she's an incredible student and a passionate change maker and so

04:02:30.140 --> 04:02:36.780
i'm really excited to start prepping her for the role over the summer um and then recently i was

04:02:36.780 --> 04:02:42.540
able to participate alongside students from across the state um in a webinar with the department

04:02:42.540 --> 04:02:48.220
of public health about the impact of coven 19 on schools and just thinking about ways that we can

04:02:48.220 --> 04:02:53.660
move forward um and there was a really great diversity of perspectives there which i really

04:02:53.660 --> 04:02:59.180
appreciated um and i felt like i could personally learn a lot from the just the various perspectives

04:02:59.180 --> 04:03:05.740
that i was able to hear in that webinar um so students emphasize the importance of expanding

04:03:05.740 --> 04:03:10.540
after-school access to tutoring to remedy the learning loss that happened last year

04:03:11.180 --> 04:03:15.420
the importance of listening to student perspectives when trying to make decisions

04:03:15.420 --> 04:03:20.940
about moving forward and students students also said that they felt like it would be beneficial

04:03:21.580 --> 04:03:28.540
to make sure that students continually understand the status of coven 19 because while there are

04:03:28.540 --> 04:03:32.300
some districts where all of the students pretty much are still wearing their masks and they're

04:03:32.300 --> 04:03:37.980
still being very safe there are also districts on the other hand which are kind of moving on

04:03:37.980 --> 04:03:43.740
and almost seems like they forget that cove it still exists and so i think it's just important

04:03:43.740 --> 04:03:50.140
to make sure that everyone stays informed and is aware um and then looking forward i'm excited to

04:03:50.140 --> 04:03:55.900
be speaking at a webinar this friday hosted by senator padilla where we'll be discussing the

04:03:55.900 --> 04:04:01.980
impact of covid on mental health which i'm sure you all know is is very broad and and there's

04:04:01.980 --> 04:04:06.380
definitely a lot to talk about there so i'm looking forward to that um and that concludes my board

04:04:06.380 --> 04:04:15.500
report thank you so much and congratulations we'll see you on campus member escapado

04:04:18.380 --> 04:04:19.740
yes wested

04:04:19.740 --> 04:04:21.580
uh

04:04:24.220 --> 04:04:31.100
a great meeting with wested and we'd like to invite my colleagues on i believe is june 9th

04:04:32.060 --> 04:04:39.820
they're they're having a um they're hosting a presentation by by heather mcgee who authored

04:04:39.820 --> 04:04:46.540
the some of us what racism costs everyone and how we can prosper together and it's

04:04:47.500 --> 04:04:54.700
actually very timing and she is an economist and she looks at racism through the eyes of

04:04:55.660 --> 04:05:05.820
the economic conditions in our in our state and how those lack of opportunities not only

04:05:06.540 --> 04:05:13.740
has affected the quality of life for people of color but mainstream america as well

04:05:14.700 --> 04:05:21.820
and the degradation of our society can all be connected to the lack of economic opportunities

04:05:21.820 --> 04:05:30.220
so i'll send you all you know that length it's only an hour um should be quite a unique

04:05:30.220 --> 04:05:38.140
perspective and on how to look at racism from a different lens also wested is looking at um

04:05:39.100 --> 04:05:49.260
the evolution of formative assessments and how um they can they're looking at um establishing

04:05:49.260 --> 04:05:58.620
a new way uh to inform teachers throughout the year and um working with states like new york

04:05:58.620 --> 04:06:07.020
and incorporating a different type of assessment and information system so more on that a little

04:06:07.020 --> 04:06:22.700
bit later thank you i had an opportunity to attend the april convening of the instruction

04:06:22.700 --> 04:06:27.420
quality commission it was the first time that that particular group of commissioners has been

04:06:27.420 --> 04:06:35.260
able to meet in person and uh was quite a jovial mood in the space i will definitely say that

04:06:35.260 --> 04:06:39.180
for the commissioner some who've only seen themselves through the screen to get together

04:06:39.180 --> 04:06:45.180
similar to us today at that particular meeting uh there were a couple of topics that were

04:06:45.180 --> 04:06:50.940
discussed that i'll highlight very briefly for all of you one was that they received an update

04:06:50.940 --> 04:06:58.780
on the comprehensive uh literacy state literacy plan and so information was provided on just kind

04:06:58.780 --> 04:07:04.620
of an overview of the work that had been done to date but also there was a sharing of the online

04:07:04.620 --> 04:07:10.540
literacy resource repository that is under development and will be accessible to educators

04:07:11.260 --> 04:07:17.580
another really exciting uh update if you will that took place at the iqc meeting was in regards to

04:07:18.380 --> 04:07:28.060
upcoming model curriculums and there are four very important areas that will begin to start the

04:07:28.140 --> 04:07:35.260
process of developing and they are native american studies vietnamese american refugee experience

04:07:35.820 --> 04:07:42.380
cambodian genocide among history and cultural studies so we will definitely keep you posted

04:07:43.500 --> 04:07:47.820
county offices and those who will be working together to help develop those model curriculums

04:07:47.820 --> 04:07:53.900
as well as others have been identified and will start to convene and again i will continue to

04:07:53.900 --> 04:08:00.220
keep the board updated and the last uh portion that they talked about was another update if you

04:08:00.220 --> 04:08:07.100
will on the california digital learning integration and standards guidance we were able to hear

04:08:08.060 --> 04:08:14.380
the resources that are available online as well as videos and things of that sort to help support

04:08:14.380 --> 04:08:19.660
educators in that digital learning space which we know is very important for some of our students

04:08:19.660 --> 04:08:23.660
as well and president darling ham and that concludes my report thank you

04:08:26.460 --> 04:08:27.180
member louis

04:08:30.700 --> 04:08:40.300
okay uh thank you the um committee that i sat in on was the waiver committee and it was a very uh

04:08:40.300 --> 04:08:46.620
enlightening meeting and i really learned uh from that meeting we actually went through the waivers

04:08:46.620 --> 04:08:53.980
and then i was given information regarding the articles that give us waiver authority and also

04:08:53.980 --> 04:09:01.500
the policies regarding some of the the waivers that were on our agenda so one meeting very

04:09:01.500 --> 04:09:07.420
informative i like the process of going through and discussing each of the waivers and and finding

04:09:07.420 --> 04:09:12.700
the merit as to whether they stay on consent or should be brought to the open group so i really

04:09:12.700 --> 04:09:17.580
appreciated the deep discussion and explanation behind those and look forward to working with

04:09:17.580 --> 04:09:24.700
that committee as well i believe my other one is the iqc but i missed the meeting

04:09:25.900 --> 04:09:31.660

member glover woods what you said is very true that there's a lot of buzz around california around

04:10:09.180 --> 04:10:15.660
the model curriculum especially american indian model curriculum there's a lot of tribes who are

04:10:15.660 --> 04:10:23.020
buzzing about that wanting to give input and very excited about that so looking forward to it that's

04:10:32.140 --> 04:10:37.260
to be here in person with you all um i i'm gonna have to stop saying i'm new soon because we're all

04:10:37.260 --> 04:10:46.380
new together today um my i am the i'm serving as a liaison to both the advisory commission on charter

04:10:46.700 --> 04:10:53.180
um my i am the i'm serving as a liaison to both the advisory commission on charter schools and

04:10:53.180 --> 04:10:59.260
the advisory commission on special education um in terms of the advisory commission on charter schools

04:10:59.980 --> 04:11:06.860
we already covered the main topic of that meeting today um and unfortunately i was not able to attend

04:11:07.740 --> 04:11:12.780
the meeting i don't think i had been actually assigned yet to the meeting on um the the

04:11:12.780 --> 04:11:19.980
advisory commission for special special education but i received the the materials um and they're

04:11:19.980 --> 04:11:28.860
really amazing um there was a one set of materials on and a report on the impact of universal um

04:11:29.820 --> 04:11:37.260
pre-k on special education and um what that might mean for being able to identify and support

04:11:37.260 --> 04:11:42.460
students at a younger age and then there was another set of materials on the importance of

04:11:42.460 --> 04:11:48.780
social emotional learning and support um so things that um are topics i think near and dear

04:11:48.780 --> 04:11:56.780
to all of us here thank you that concludes my report great um member roscoe gonzalez

04:11:59.260 --> 04:12:05.100
i know you mentioned that um mine was part of the mega item as a liaison assignment but i just want

04:12:05.100 --> 04:12:10.700
to have a comment about that about how important is the work that they're doing on demonstrating

04:12:10.700 --> 04:12:15.740
the proof of concept for the performance tasks um some of the things that we're doing in our

04:12:15.740 --> 04:12:21.660
district that is similar to what smart balance is doing is preparing those cfas which are pretty

04:12:21.660 --> 04:12:27.020
much a performance test and we've seen that by the collection of data that students are learning

04:12:27.020 --> 04:12:33.340
more deeply and being more engaged in their own learning by doing several tasks versus one you

04:12:33.340 --> 04:12:39.420
know common response um test or so i think that's really important work and i think some of the

04:12:39.420 --> 04:12:44.460
stuff that um i thought was really great was the science instructional resources for tools for

04:12:44.460 --> 04:12:50.780
teachers um the resources that are being provided for teachers to to look at and to curate for their

04:12:50.780 --> 04:12:57.100
own classrooms um is a great database and a great start for the students in california so i'm excited

04:12:57.100 --> 04:13:03.500
to see the work and the proof of concept in the fall in the fall or late summer correct okay so

04:13:03.500 --> 04:13:05.020
that's what i have to report thank you

04:13:08.220 --> 04:13:09.900
and uh member patiya branson

04:13:11.660 --> 04:13:15.740
hi um and i'm i'm not on my phone except for my notes

04:13:18.220 --> 04:13:25.260
so i had my first meeting um which was super exciting to um actually talk with the california

04:13:25.260 --> 04:13:33.660
state summer school for the arts um and um it's been a really um exciting sort of moment of change

04:13:33.660 --> 04:13:41.100
for them i think um so they went virtual um as so many um organizations did uh during the pandemic

04:13:41.100 --> 04:13:46.460
and they are back in action for this summer they'll be having about 500 students from across the state

04:13:47.260 --> 04:13:54.300
who will be joining them in a host of artistic uh pursuits um they also have been doing some

04:13:54.300 --> 04:14:01.020
really interesting work to lean into their mission of serving uh the the full diversity

04:14:01.020 --> 04:14:08.300
of california kids um and so they have uh changed some of their um rubric um in terms of looking at

04:14:08.300 --> 04:14:15.260
admissions um to encourage um both via recruitment as well as looking at the application process

04:14:16.140 --> 04:14:22.380
to encourage more first generation college going students and also to do greater outreach at title

04:14:22.380 --> 04:14:29.260
and schools um and what's exciting is in the a fairly short amount of time they have been able

04:14:29.260 --> 04:14:35.180
to actually see real results um and a greater geographic distribution a greater distribution

04:14:35.180 --> 04:14:42.700
of different uh fields of art and also socioeconomic and racial diversity um so it's i think a lovely

04:14:42.700 --> 04:14:47.180
success story and just want to lift up the leadership of matthew gallagher who's the

04:14:47.980 --> 04:14:54.940
sort of new uh ish ed there who has been leading a lot of really great work um i'll also

04:14:54.940 --> 04:15:01.500
flag that um i had the opportunity to meet the secretary of education cardona down in

04:15:01.500 --> 04:15:06.860
southern california as he was doing a tour uh and meeting with school board members and he was both

04:15:06.860 --> 04:15:13.660
fantastic representing our president's education agenda and certainly lifted up i think three key

04:15:13.740 --> 04:15:20.140
themes um that will sound very familiar given today's discussion uh one around the need for

04:15:20.140 --> 04:15:26.060
mental health which i think is absolutely a core part of the community schools offering and also

04:15:27.180 --> 04:15:32.300
i'm excited to know that rana will be representing california alongside senator pedia to raise up

04:15:32.300 --> 04:15:38.700
that issue um also the necessity of tutoring after school and summer programs to help with

04:15:38.700 --> 04:15:47.100
learning loss and learning acceleration and then lastly the need to address the teacher shortage

04:15:47.100 --> 04:15:52.700
and teacher retention efforts and what what was i think really heartening is those are all big

04:15:52.700 --> 04:16:00.140
challenges that california shares with a lot of other states and that california is already

04:16:00.140 --> 04:16:05.420
leaning quite heavily into all three of those areas in a way that i think speaks well of our

04:16:05.420 --> 04:16:12.780
leadership and how we are um addressing each of those um the last thing i'll just say um is

04:16:13.820 --> 04:16:18.300
this is actually more referencing last year's budget but sort of seeing the fun

04:16:19.900 --> 04:16:26.700
effects when i think state and local work together so in last year's budget uh the governor proposed

04:16:26.700 --> 04:16:34.940
in the legislature came together on child savings accounts which begin children and families on a

04:16:34.940 --> 04:16:40.220
journey of thinking about college savings and training for post college which is where we want

04:16:40.780 --> 04:16:47.020
we do our jobs right in k-12 then they go on to the next system and and do incredibly well and if

04:16:47.020 --> 04:16:53.900
they have a nest egg of savings there's great studies around the importance of how that shapes

04:16:53.900 --> 04:16:59.580
their notion of what they can do next there's also now a local effort there has been for many years

04:16:59.580 --> 04:17:05.820
in san francisco to have a similar child savings account um lusd just debuted um it's as well so

04:17:05.820 --> 04:17:11.900
that uh all first graders across the district will have additional contributions for child

04:17:11.900 --> 04:17:17.740
savings accounts and there's there's a healthy buzz a couple amongst a couple of other school

04:17:17.740 --> 04:17:23.980
districts so sometimes innovation starts at local and sort of floats up to state and sometimes it

04:17:23.980 --> 04:17:31.580
starts at state and floats in circles around the state um and that concludes my my report

04:17:31.580 --> 04:17:40.780
awesome thank you member rodriguez thank you president darling hammond um and fellow members

04:17:40.780 --> 04:17:49.500
in public so um i have some very good news about national board uh the national board incentive

04:17:49.580 --> 04:17:57.420
the professional teaching standards certificate incentive program year one numbers 1,818 teachers

04:17:57.420 --> 04:18:05.180
in high priority schools pursued national board certification this year compared to 341 teachers

04:18:05.740 --> 04:18:14.060
from high priority schools in 2021 so those were big numbers yes 1,955 national board certified

04:18:14.060 --> 04:18:19.020
teachers in high priority schools will receive the first five thousand dollar installment

04:18:20.860 --> 04:18:29.100
of the uh twenty five thousand dollar incentive reward and cd has done a phenomenal job with

04:18:29.100 --> 04:18:36.220
outreach partnering with professional networks and labor groups and administering the program

04:18:36.300 --> 04:18:42.620
to get these great results and i encourage any teacher in the classroom to

04:18:43.900 --> 04:18:48.620
pursue national board certification there's there's something very powerful about having

04:18:48.620 --> 04:18:55.820
a common language to reflect on one's teaching and to improve our practice to better serve our

04:18:55.820 --> 04:19:05.900
students um going on with the teacher shortage so i was invited to be on a pep committee and at

04:19:05.900 --> 04:19:13.340
first i thought i'd be chairing but it it stands for public education positions and yeah but i was

04:19:13.340 --> 04:19:20.700
still chairing um and it's actually through nasb the uh national association of school boards of

04:19:20.700 --> 04:19:29.420
education and so this particular committee um basically you know the work is presented to

04:19:30.300 --> 04:19:39.180
the the assembly and it's it'll be like what the resources of the staff and the organization will

04:19:39.180 --> 04:19:47.180
focus on uh for the coming year and so um i'm on the teacher shortage teacher preparation workforce

04:19:48.380 --> 04:19:55.420
team and we've been and and i think the reason why i ended up on that team is i was

04:19:55.420 --> 04:20:02.220
i kept citing uh lpi teacher shortage articles that i'd read and then all of a sudden

04:20:03.180 --> 04:20:11.660
i became i became the person and so uh anyway we're working very hard to present something in

04:20:11.660 --> 04:20:19.980
october and uh enthusiastic that you know we'll have yet another uh partner agency working working

04:20:19.980 --> 04:20:24.940
on this crisis and making sure that we're recruiting teachers and i'd also like to

04:20:24.940 --> 04:20:30.460
encourage career changers i'm a career changer i didn't go straight from college into teaching

04:20:30.460 --> 04:20:39.500
and i think that it's uh i know it's the best decision i ever made so um lastly ctc is looking

04:20:39.500 --> 04:20:47.740
for um school employees and we mentioned today that it's a school employee week for the teacher

04:20:47.740 --> 04:20:51.660
credentialing program that was started about four years ago and it's very successful

04:20:52.540 --> 04:20:56.860
and it's people that work within the school who can apply to become teachers and they're

04:20:56.860 --> 04:21:02.700
supported throughout the process so it's very powerful if you know somebody who you know works

04:21:02.700 --> 04:21:07.340
in the front office who's always like oh i want to go back to school and i want to be a teacher

04:21:07.340 --> 04:21:10.780
and they already have relationships with the students so this is a wonderful program

04:21:11.420 --> 04:21:18.860
they will be accepting applications until june 10th and lastly educator preparation student liaison

04:21:18.860 --> 04:21:25.020
for the ctc is also uh an open spot and they are looking for applicants if you know anybody

04:21:25.020 --> 04:21:31.100
who is in a teacher preparation program um they would they're the voice right you know the liaison

04:21:31.100 --> 04:21:38.140
that represents um that particular student population and the application is due before

04:21:38.140 --> 04:21:46.140
june 30th president that concludes my report oh wonderful well i'm going to offer just a couple

04:21:46.140 --> 04:21:52.780
of um examples of things that are of the ways california is being talked about in the policy

04:21:52.780 --> 04:21:59.660
arena sometimes i'm doing the talking sometimes other people are but but things that made me

04:21:59.660 --> 04:22:04.220
very proud to think about and i think they will make you proud too i was in a meeting of the

04:22:04.220 --> 04:22:10.060
collaborating states initiative of the castle organization the collaborative for academic social

04:22:10.060 --> 04:22:16.380
emotional learning and um california was identified as a state that has really taken a holistic

04:22:16.380 --> 04:22:21.340
approach to social emotional learning restorative practices so i was asked to sort of just help

04:22:21.340 --> 04:22:25.500
people understand the pieces of it and it was a really interesting reflection because

04:22:26.620 --> 04:22:31.260
starting some years ago when i first came to california in fact there was a zero tolerance

04:22:31.260 --> 04:22:38.780
law that required student exclusion from school for a set of offenses that you know you sort of

04:22:38.780 --> 04:22:46.060
had to suspend or expel for and that was changed you know that law was ultimately eliminated then

04:22:46.060 --> 04:22:52.140
there was legislation to eliminate willful defiance as a reason for suspension suspension

04:22:52.140 --> 04:23:00.540
was put into the accountability system for the federal accountability elements along with school

04:23:00.540 --> 04:23:06.700
climate part of our eight state priorities money was put into professional development

04:23:06.700 --> 04:23:12.060
for social emotional learning restorative practices the ctc enacted standards for both

04:23:12.060 --> 04:23:16.780
administrators and teachers requiring that social emotional learning and supports and

04:23:16.780 --> 04:23:23.100
restorative practices be part of what people learn to do the state undertook a multi-tiered

04:23:23.100 --> 04:23:28.700
system of support initiative and over with all of those things going on which is much more

04:23:28.700 --> 04:23:35.020
comprehensive than states usually approach these things as we've had a huge decline in suspension

04:23:35.020 --> 04:23:41.260
a corresponding increase in graduation rates and a big big improvement in school safety so it was

04:23:41.260 --> 04:23:46.780
just really nice to be able to think about the fact that over this last decade or so we've really

04:23:46.780 --> 04:23:53.660
tackled some of these you know concerns from multiple angles and then i'll just also let you

04:23:53.660 --> 04:23:59.020
know that we recently got word brooks knows this that california has been selected for the frank

04:23:59.020 --> 04:24:04.380
newman award that the education commission of the states gives out for state innovation

04:24:04.940 --> 04:24:11.980
and the comment about that was that no other state is really doing such large structural long-term

04:24:13.100 --> 04:24:21.260
reform as as california so leaving us on a high note like we began with you know may being the

04:24:21.260 --> 04:24:29.420
time for recognizing accomplishments i think the hard work that everyone in this body and our

04:24:29.420 --> 04:24:35.340
companion bodies in government is doing is is moving us forward so that's a good way to go into

04:24:35.340 --> 04:24:42.300
the summer right and so with that we're going to take up our last agenda item which is general

04:24:42.300 --> 04:24:47.900

thank you my name is beth kelly no affiliation i'm just a parent i just wanted to make a comment

04:25:45.340 --> 04:25:52.860
about the california math framework the draft one that's available and i'm really disappointed

04:25:52.860 --> 04:26:01.260
in it i think that it it kind of dumbs down math education and and unfortunately isn't based in

04:26:01.260 --> 04:26:09.100
best practices around math you know as a as a middle class person i can bypass the system by

04:26:09.100 --> 04:26:12.940
you know getting supplemental math outside of school but we really shouldn't have to do that

04:26:12.940 --> 04:26:22.060
no kid should have to do that and at a minimum i really urge you to make the framework more user

04:26:22.060 --> 04:26:27.020
friendly so that teachers can actually utilize what it is right now it's like over a thousand

04:26:27.020 --> 04:26:34.700
pages and and it's not useful and and also at a bare minimum it's important to get rid of

04:26:35.820 --> 04:26:40.540
the there are various misstatements about the research that is cited

04:26:41.340 --> 04:26:48.380
