WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
Good morning.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.560
This is the third day of our March 2021 board meeting.

00:08.560 --> 00:12.720
And seeing that board members are present, Brooks, can you please call the roll to establish

00:12.720 --> 00:13.720
a quorum?

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
Of course.

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
Good morning.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.720
Member Burr.

00:16.720 --> 00:17.720
Here.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.720
President Darling-Hammond.

00:18.720 --> 00:19.720
Here.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.720
Member Patah.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
Here.

00:21.720 --> 00:22.720
Member Glover-Wood.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.720
Here.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.720
Member Ritchie.

00:24.720 --> 00:25.720
Here.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.720
Here.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.720
Member Glover-Wood.

00:28.720 --> 00:29.720
Here.

00:29.720 --> 00:30.720
Member McQuillan.

00:30.720 --> 00:31.720
Morning.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.720
Here.

00:32.720 --> 00:33.720
Member Navo.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.720
Here.

00:34.720 --> 00:35.720
Member Petillo-Brownson.

00:35.720 --> 00:36.720
Here.

00:36.720 --> 00:37.720
Member Rodriguez.

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
Here.

00:38.720 --> 00:39.720
Member Rucker.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.720
Here.

00:40.720 --> 00:41.720
Vice President Strauss.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.720
Here.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.720
Member Son.

00:43.720 --> 00:44.720
Here.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.720
You have a quorum.

00:45.720 --> 00:46.720
Okay.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.720
And I'll start with the announcement that in closed session yesterday, the board discussed

00:51.720 --> 00:56.720
the following legal matter, CAPIM versus California Department of Education and State

00:56.720 --> 00:58.720
Board of Education.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.720
And we'll launch into our agenda.

01:01.720 --> 01:07.720
I want to begin by noting that today we'll be taking up an opportunity to take steps

01:07.720 --> 01:10.720
to address these issues.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.720
I want to begin by noting that today we'll be taking up an opportunity to take steps

01:16.720 --> 01:23.720
toward confronting and ultimately transforming racism in our society and in our state as

01:23.720 --> 01:26.720
we take up the ethnic studies model curriculum.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.720
This day has been a long time in coming.

01:29.720 --> 01:34.720
And we're reminded daily that the racial injustice it reveals is not only a legacy of the past

01:34.720 --> 01:36.720
but a clear and present danger.

01:36.720 --> 01:42.720
And as we have struggled for years with the ongoing spate of police shootings of unarmed

01:42.720 --> 01:49.720
black men and women, George Floyd, Mon Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and many more, they mourn this

01:49.720 --> 01:55.720
week for the shootings of eight men and women in Atlanta, six of them women of Asian descent.

01:55.720 --> 02:01.720
Not all of them had been named by the police as of yesterday, but today we say the names

02:01.720 --> 02:08.720
of Delana Yang, Chao Shi Tang, Dai Yong Feng, as well as Paul, Andre Michaels, and LCS

02:08.720 --> 02:12.720
Hernandez Ortiz, who remained in critical condition as of last night.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.720
And all of our prayers are with their families.

02:15.720 --> 02:26.720
I want to just take a moment to respect and reflect on the events of the week.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.720
And we know that this latest moment is built on a past that includes Chinese exclusion

02:32.720 --> 02:38.720
and Japanese internment, as well as xenophobia directed at South Asian, Middle Eastern, and

02:38.720 --> 02:41.720
Muslim communities at 9-11, racial slurs from U.S.

02:41.720 --> 02:46.720
government officials, which contributed to a major wave of anti-Asian violence in cities

02:46.720 --> 02:48.720
across the country.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.720
And as we will discuss today, hate speech and crimes, as well as other forms of discrimination

02:53.720 --> 02:59.720
directed at people because of their race, ethnicity, language, appearance, religion,

02:59.720 --> 03:05.720
country of origin, are a familiar part of our history and our contemporary reality.

03:05.720 --> 03:11.720
We must understand this history if we're finally to end it and usher in a new day in California

03:11.720 --> 03:13.720
and in the country.

03:13.720 --> 03:17.720
And with that goal in mind, I want to introduce our first item of today.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.720
Item 9 is the ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:21.720 --> 03:27.720
By way of announcement for public comment, members of the public who wish to dial in

03:27.720 --> 03:31.720
for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what time we will

03:31.720 --> 03:34.720
ask for public comment for each item on the agenda.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.720
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number and participant access code

03:39.720 --> 03:42.720
and then following each of the operator's prompts.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.720
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.720
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

03:50.720 --> 03:55.720
We will also ask for public calling and for public comment to please turn down the speaker

03:55.720 --> 04:00.720
volume of their computers if they're following the live feed to avoid an echoing effect.

04:00.720 --> 04:04.720
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

04:04.720 --> 04:07.720
And board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.720
Keep your cameras on except when you are taking a break to ensure that we can maintain a forum

04:13.720 --> 04:15.720
throughout today's virtual meeting.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.720
For each item on the agenda, there's an opportunity for you to raise your hand using the Zoom

04:19.720 --> 04:23.720
participant window if you'd like to make a question or a comment.

04:23.720 --> 04:32.720
And I'd like to ask our colleagues from CDE to be ready to present Item 9, the ethnic

04:32.720 --> 04:34.720
studies model curriculum.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.720
The item will be presented by Shanine Coates of the CDE, followed by State Superintendent

04:39.720 --> 04:44.720
of Public Instruction, Tony Thurman, who will make a few comments and introduce our lineup

04:44.720 --> 04:47.720
of guest speakers.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.720
Shanine, please begin.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.720
Thank you, President Linda Darling-Hammond, Vice President Strauss, and members of the board.

04:55.720 --> 05:02.720
It is truly an honor to be here today to present the recommendations for California's ethnic

05:02.720 --> 05:04.720
studies model curriculum.

05:04.720 --> 05:10.720
Although we are in a virtual space and all inhabiting different places, I would like to

05:10.720 --> 05:16.720
begin with a land acknowledgement to recognize that this land was and still is the land I'm

05:16.720 --> 05:22.720
on, the tribal land of the Nisenan people, as well as any tribes or peoples that may be

05:22.720 --> 05:23.720
unnamed.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.720
We recognize their rich history and their current presence and that we are guests of the

05:28.720 --> 05:31.720
land and that we benefit from the use of this land.

05:31.720 --> 05:37.720
By offering this land acknowledgement, we recognize that in our educational system, we

05:37.720 --> 05:43.720
need to celebrate and place high value on the pre-colonial ancestral knowledge, narratives,

05:43.720 --> 05:50.720
and communal experiences of Native peoples, including ensuring that the teaching of Native

05:50.720 --> 05:57.720
peoples in our classrooms is in present tense and a reflection of their voice.

05:57.720 --> 06:04.720
In 2016, when the legislature voted in favor of AB 2016 authored by Luis Alejo, we could

06:04.720 --> 06:10.720
have never predicted what we would have gone through as a country from then until today.

06:10.720 --> 06:16.720
Today, I am joined by our superintendent, chief deputy Dr. Gregson, guest speakers,

06:16.720 --> 06:19.720
and three members of the instructional quality commission.

06:19.720 --> 06:25.720
Together, we will explain how the model we will present fulfills the legislation and

06:25.720 --> 06:30.720
is a necessary step to continue the important conversation of ethnic studies course development

06:30.720 --> 06:34.720
in our great state and in our local educational agencies.

06:34.720 --> 06:39.720
The model curriculum focuses on the four foundational disciplines of ethnic studies while giving

06:39.720 --> 06:44.720
districts the flexibility to shape courses to meet their local needs and reflect California's

06:44.720 --> 06:45.720
diversity.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.720
The model is not a step-by-step blueprint, but it is written as a guide.

06:49.720 --> 06:53.720
The great value in the document is that it will be used to help local districts as they

06:53.720 --> 06:57.720
continue to develop their ethnic studies courses.

06:57.720 --> 07:02.720
Designed to be discussed in the context of community and used alongside other tools such

07:02.720 --> 07:06.720
as the history social science framework and the English language arts English language

07:06.720 --> 07:12.720
development framework, this document provides tools, resources, and information that can

07:12.720 --> 07:15.720
be used as another entry point in the conversation.

07:15.720 --> 07:21.720
It offers a space for historically marginalized voices to be raised and to honor those that

07:21.720 --> 07:26.720
have paved the way and for those who have never heard those voices to have the opportunity

07:26.720 --> 07:30.720
to hear the narratives of various experiences in our country.

07:30.720 --> 07:37.720
It offers space for a more complete history to be heard, known, and understood.

07:37.720 --> 07:43.720
For me personally, my parents and grandparents' story is part of that narrative.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.720
My grandfather and grandmother voted for the first time in their 70s after the Voting Rights

07:48.720 --> 07:53.720
Act of 1965 was passed and my mother attended segregated elementary schools and couldn't

07:53.720 --> 07:56.720
try on clothes in the store due to her race.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.720
I have witnessed the impact of systemic inequities within the educational system that have

08:01.720 --> 08:05.720
failed some of my family members and even allowed my high school counselor who could

08:05.720 --> 08:10.720
not see my value to feel comfortable telling me to not bother to apply for college because

08:10.720 --> 08:12.720
I would not be accepted.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.720
These experiences are not just examples of implicit bias.

08:16.720 --> 08:19.720
They are examples that highlight systemic racism.

08:19.720 --> 08:25.720
My narrative, your narrative, as well as the narratives that are included in this guide

08:25.720 --> 08:31.720
alongside the thousands of voices in the local context are the narratives of perseverance

08:31.720 --> 08:36.720
that can empower students, give them a sense of pride, and inspire them to be involved

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
in our democracy.

08:37.720 --> 08:42.720
That is why it is my pleasure to serve under our superintendent of public instruction,

08:42.720 --> 08:47.720
Tony Thurman, who has strengthened the conversation around ethnic studies and how we use

08:47.720 --> 08:52.720
education as a platform to end hate of all kinds.

08:52.720 --> 08:57.720
And at this time, I would like to turn it over to our chief deputy superintendent, Dr.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.720
Stephanie Gregson, for remarks.

08:59.720 --> 09:00.720
Thank you.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.720
Thank you, Shanine, and thank you for sharing your story.

09:04.720 --> 09:09.720
It is one that I have not heard before and I appreciate honoring and hearing your story.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.720
I'd also like to appreciate and acknowledge that this journey started in January of 2018

09:15.720 --> 09:19.720
for many members of our team here at the California Department of Education.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.720
And I would like to acknowledge those members of our team.

09:23.720 --> 09:28.720
There are too many to name individually, but I would like to appreciate and acknowledge

09:28.720 --> 09:33.720
Shanine Coates as the director of the curriculum frameworks and instructional resources division

09:33.720 --> 09:39.720
who has worked tirelessly since she began in her role on ethnic studies model curriculum.

09:39.720 --> 09:44.720
We so appreciate her work as executive director of the instructional quality commission as well.

09:44.720 --> 09:48.720
She has a team behind her in the curriculum frameworks and instructional resources division

09:48.720 --> 09:54.720
who has been working on this since January of 2018 when I was director of the curriculum

09:54.720 --> 09:56.720
frameworks and instructional resources division.

09:56.720 --> 10:02.720
And I would like to thank you and appreciate for your hard work during this past three years.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.720
This work crossed many divisions within the department.

10:06.720 --> 10:12.720
And so I would like to acknowledge and appreciate all who contributed to the work behind the

10:13.720 --> 10:16.720
scenes of ethnic studies model curriculum.

10:16.720 --> 10:23.720
It truly is a first for us here at the California Department of Education and it is a first for California.

10:23.720 --> 10:28.720
So thank you for all of the work that you have done to get us to this moment today.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.720
And with that, I would like to introduce our state superintendent of public instruction,

10:33.720 --> 10:39.720
Tony Thurman, who, as Shanine said, has helped amplify the conversation around ethnic studies,

10:39.720 --> 10:46.720
but also has empowered and amplified the voices of our students whose experiences are so incredibly

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
powerful.

10:47.720 --> 10:52.720
And so with that, I thank our superintendent for uplifting those student voices.

10:52.720 --> 10:59.720
And I hand this off to state superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurman.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.720
Thank you, Dr. Grickson.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.720
Good morning, Madam President, members of the board.

11:04.720 --> 11:10.720
It's an honor to be with you today on this important journey as we continue our discussion about the

11:10.720 --> 11:13.720
role of ethnic studies in California's education.

11:13.720 --> 11:19.720
I also want to thank Shanine Coates for her incredible leadership and stewardship of this enormous

11:19.720 --> 11:22.720
opportunity and with all that comes with it.

11:22.720 --> 11:27.720
Thank you, Shanine, and to your team and to all of the staff at the California Department of Education and

11:27.720 --> 11:33.720
all the staff at the State Board of Education, of course, the IQC and the state board members themselves

11:33.720 --> 11:35.720
for all of your work.

11:35.720 --> 11:42.720
I'd like to contextualize my thoughts really through the lens of what we've heard from our students.

11:42.720 --> 11:48.720
After the killing of George Floyd, we sought to provide support to our students for the trauma that the

11:48.720 --> 11:51.720
nation, that the world had witnessed.

11:51.720 --> 11:58.720
Our students said to us that they wanted to see representations of themselves.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.720
They asked us why they didn't learn about their own histories in school.

12:03.720 --> 12:11.720
We recognized then how important it was to us and to them that we introduce ethnic studies in a way that

12:11.720 --> 12:13.720
everyone can learn.

12:13.720 --> 12:20.720
At that moment, we created a mini series on ethnic studies to introduce what ethnic studies is to many

12:20.720 --> 12:23.720
students, thousands of students across the state.

12:23.720 --> 12:28.720
And so it is for those reasons that we are hopeful that we will be moving forward in a way that supports

12:28.720 --> 12:30.720
our students.

12:30.720 --> 12:35.720
We know that when students haven't seen representations of themselves, that now we have an

12:35.720 --> 12:41.720
opportunity before us to support the self-esteem of our students, that they can see their ancestors, that

12:41.720 --> 12:47.720
they can see the contributions of people of color and what they have done to make California a great

12:47.720 --> 12:49.720
state and to make this a great nation.

12:49.720 --> 12:55.720
We also recognize that learning those experiences of people of color and their contributions is a benefit

12:55.720 --> 12:57.720
to students of all backgrounds.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.720
And so that's why today's work is so important.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.720
I want to thank the many who have contributed.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.720
Obviously we have had lots of public comment and lots of interest.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.720
I want to thank the original advisory board members for their hard work.

13:11.720 --> 13:16.720
I want to thank our staff, multiple professors and others who have helped us.

13:16.720 --> 13:21.720
What you have before you and what you've been reviewing, we believe, are just excellent lesson plans,

13:21.720 --> 13:27.720
robust content, a focus on historic four disciplines that traditionally have been taught in

13:27.720 --> 13:29.720
ethnic studies.

13:29.720 --> 13:34.720
But yet we've added a bridge to interconnectivity for other groups that while they may not have

13:34.720 --> 13:40.720
historically been part of what has been traditionally taught in ethnic studies, represent other

13:40.720 --> 13:45.720
groups whose stories are worthy of being told, who have experienced oppression, who have

13:45.720 --> 13:47.720
contributions to share.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.720
And you will find all those lesson plans together.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.720
But we wanted to acknowledge this bridge of interconnectivity.

13:54.720 --> 13:58.720
We are proud of what we have to present to you.

13:58.720 --> 14:05.720
And we acknowledge that when you do something of this magnitude, it is not going to make, you know,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.720
it will not make everyone happy.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.720
But what we strive for is balance.

14:10.720 --> 14:16.720
What we strive for is how to put forward the message that can be helpful as a guide to all of our

14:16.720 --> 14:18.720
school districts.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.720
It is not intended to be perfect.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.720
I don't know that anything could be.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.720
But we're very proud of what we put forward for you.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.720
And we look forward to the process that will go forward around this implementation.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.720
As Shanine mentioned today, this is a guide for school districts.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.720
It is not a mandate.

14:35.720 --> 14:41.720
And ultimately, school districts will create their own versions of ethnic studies that are tailored

14:41.720 --> 14:45.720
uniquely to fit the needs of the communities that they serve.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.720
But this guide is an important launching point.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.720
And there are opportunities this year to talk about what implementation might look like as there are

14:53.720 --> 15:00.720
resources currently in trailer bill, currently proposed in the governor's budget from January that

15:00.720 --> 15:06.720
actually send resources to school districts for implementing ethnic studies in a way that is unique

15:06.720 --> 15:08.720
to the districts.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.720
And so we continue that conversation.

15:10.720 --> 15:16.720
As we continue today's conversation, I'd like to invite a few colleagues, partners, and friends who've

15:16.720 --> 15:25.720
helped us to get to this latest round of fine-tuning and edits that you have before you to share with us

15:25.720 --> 15:30.720
their experience and to help frame for us the importance of ethnic studies.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.720
I'd like to begin with, first, Assemblymember Luis Alejo.

15:34.720 --> 15:42.720
Assemblymember Alejo currently serves as a member of the Board of Supervisors in my home county, in

15:42.720 --> 15:44.720
Monterey County, where I was born.

15:44.720 --> 15:52.720
He is, as you heard from Director Cokes, the author of AB 2016, which created the opportunity to create

15:52.720 --> 15:54.720
the Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum Guide.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.720
Assemblymember Alejo, we welcome your remarks.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.720
Good morning and buenos dias.

15:58.720 --> 16:03.720
Thank you to the State Board of Education members and to my good friend, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond

16:03.720 --> 16:08.720
for allowing me to say some words on this historic day as you consider finalizing this High School

16:08.720 --> 16:13.720
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum created under my Legislation Assembly Bill 2016.

16:13.720 --> 16:18.720
There's no question that our students need and deserve an education that more truthfully and completely

16:18.720 --> 16:21.720
reflects the experiences and contributions of people of color.

16:21.720 --> 16:27.720
Today, 77% of students in our California's K-12 schools are students of color, and our students

16:27.720 --> 16:29.720
speak over 90 different languages in their homes.

16:29.720 --> 16:35.720
In a state with the most diverse student body anywhere in the nation, our students must see themselves

16:35.720 --> 16:39.720
reflected in their schools, their curriculum, and in the knowledge they learn.

16:39.720 --> 16:45.720
This year marks 19 years since I drafted the first bill on ethnic studies as an Assembly Fellow back

16:45.720 --> 16:48.720
in 2002 for then-Assemblymember Manny Diaz.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.720
Your decision to approve this First in the Nation Model Curriculum on Ethnic Studies will show other

16:53.720 --> 16:57.720
states what is possible and will inspire them to follow our lead.

16:57.720 --> 17:03.720
Since my curriculum legislation was approved in 2016, Indiana, Oregon, and most recently Connecticut

17:03.720 --> 17:09.720
have also passed landmark legislation to standardize and elevate ethnic studies in their high schools,

17:09.720 --> 17:12.720
so there is now movement across our nation.

17:12.720 --> 17:18.720
But in the wake of the racial unrest and the resurgence of hate and bigotry across our country,

17:18.720 --> 17:24.720
especially for the API American community who were victims of violence once again last Tuesday in Georgia,

17:24.720 --> 17:30.720
now more than ever, the need for a comprehensive and inclusive ethnic studies model curriculum cannot

17:30.720 --> 17:32.720
feel more urgent.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.720
Today we have the opportunity to use the power of education as a force for lasting change in the

17:36.720 --> 17:39.720
pursuit of racial and social justice.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.720
While keeping true to and expanding the curriculum of the four core traditional curriculums of

17:44.720 --> 17:50.720
ethnic studies, educators will also have more resources to explore additional identities whose

17:50.720 --> 17:53.720
experiences intersect here in California.

17:53.720 --> 17:58.720
I believe this curriculum will also be a catalyst for more high schools to offer ethnic studies,

17:58.720 --> 18:03.720
for a greater demand of ethnic studies-trained teachers, and for more grade-appropriate books and

18:03.720 --> 18:08.720
materials to be produced in ethnic studies, not to mention more professional development for our

18:08.720 --> 18:09.720
teachers.

18:09.720 --> 18:14.720
It will truly be transformative more than anything else in our high schools since ethnic studies was

18:14.720 --> 18:16.720
created 53 years ago.

18:16.720 --> 18:21.720
I want to remind everyone that this curriculum is voluntary and that school boards are already empowered

18:21.720 --> 18:26.720
to use the curriculum or not, to supplement their curriculum in their schools, and to provide for the

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
distinct needs of their students.

18:28.720 --> 18:35.720
And let's be clear, this curriculum was also intended as an introductory course for our high school

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
students.

18:36.720 --> 18:41.720
I understand that adopting a model curriculum today that is balanced, focused, and bold is an

18:41.720 --> 18:47.720
extraordinary task that may not please everyone by the end of today, but facing our history is an

18:47.720 --> 18:51.720
uncomfortable endeavor, and making landmark educational change is never easy.

18:51.720 --> 18:56.720
It is time to do what is right for 1.7 million high school students in California.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.720
This is long overdue, and I urge you to prove this model curriculum today.

18:59.720 --> 19:05.720
Let us send a strong message to the rest of the nation that California's public schools can be the

19:05.720 --> 19:07.720
change we want to see.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.720
Thank you, y muchas gracias, and back to you, Superintendent.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.720
Gracias.

19:12.720 --> 19:18.720
Thank you for guiding us in your original legislation and for getting us to this point.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.720
Thank you for your continued leadership.

19:21.720 --> 19:26.720
The next person that I want to introduce is Dolores Huerta.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.720
She needs no introduction.

19:29.720 --> 19:37.720
She is a civil rights icon in her work to support human rights and labor rights.

19:37.720 --> 19:44.720
She's also been a champion for bringing ethnic studies to the forefront throughout her career.

19:44.720 --> 19:52.720
She gave us the pleasure of having her as a guest on our miniseries to introduce ethnic studies to our

19:52.720 --> 19:53.720
students.

19:53.720 --> 20:01.720
I'm honored to call her a friend and mentor, and it is an honor to present to you Dolores Huerta to share some

20:01.720 --> 20:02.720
remarks.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.720
Thank you.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.720
Thank you, Superintendent Thurmond.

20:06.720 --> 20:13.720
You know, we cannot undo the horrific acts of the past against people of color that unfortunately still

20:13.720 --> 20:17.720
continue today as we saw this week in Georgia.

20:17.720 --> 20:25.720
But what we do have to do is take steps to start preventing these horrific acts against people of color.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.720
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

20:27.720 --> 20:36.720
said that racism is a sickness, and we have to become the healers to erase that ignorance.

20:36.720 --> 20:42.720
And the way that it is affecting our students, I cannot, Ms.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.720
Coates shared what happened to her when she was a student.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.720
And that was not very long ago.

20:47.720 --> 20:53.720
We work in 17 different school districts in the Dolores Huerta Foundation, working with students and with

20:53.720 --> 20:54.720
parents.

20:54.720 --> 21:00.720
And I cannot tell you how often I have heard that same story from students where teachers tell them that they

21:00.720 --> 21:03.720
are not qualified to go to college.

21:03.720 --> 21:10.720
I had one student tell me that her teacher told her that her brother would probably end up in prison so there

21:10.720 --> 21:13.720
was no need for him to continue to go to school.

21:13.720 --> 21:19.720
So we know it is not enough to say I am not a racist.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.720
What we have to do in today's world is we have to be anti-racist.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.720
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

21:26.720 --> 21:30.720
said racism is a sickness, and we have to become the healers.

21:30.720 --> 21:37.720
And there is no place that has the greatest responsibility than our educational system.

21:37.720 --> 21:46.720
And so we have to really bear down, we have to support this measure that yes, we have to have ethnic studies

21:46.720 --> 21:48.720
as a mandatory requirement.

21:48.720 --> 21:51.720
But we know that probably that will not even go far enough.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.720
It is a beginning.

21:53.720 --> 21:59.720
We have to start the ethnic studies program in our elementary schools.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.720
We know that children are not born racist.

22:03.720 --> 22:08.720
They learn racism from their culture, from the families that they grow up in.

22:08.720 --> 22:12.720
And so we are the ones that have to take the responsibility.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.720
Excuse me.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.720
You know, I live in Kern County.

22:16.720 --> 22:22.720
And Kern County, Bakersfield, California, I can say is one of the most conservative.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.720
And we have a lot of racism in our county.

22:25.720 --> 22:34.720
And even with our local high school, which we sued for the expulsion of over 2,000 black and brown students in one year.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.720
And yes, we got that expulsion down to 21 students.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.720
But they are still putting students in alternative schools.

22:41.720 --> 22:46.720
And the graduation rate for African-American students is dismal.

22:46.720 --> 22:49.720
So we know that the racism continues.

22:50.720 --> 22:58.720
Part of our lawsuit was we asked them to do a Latino Heritage Month, to do a Black History Month.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.720
It didn't happen. It didn't happen.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.720
This is before the pandemic.

23:02.720 --> 23:06.720
So the Board of Education, you have a huge responsibility.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.720
And we really have to bear down on these school districts.

23:09.720 --> 23:18.720
And we have to make them understand that the racism that is perpetuated in our school system is hurting black and brown students.

23:18.720 --> 23:24.720
I graduated from high school a long time ago, back in 1947.

23:24.720 --> 23:37.720
And it really pains me to think of the racism that I suffered as a Mexican-American student in my high school that is still happening today to many students of color.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.720
Ya basta. It's time to end it.

23:41.720 --> 23:49.720
And, you know, we have to use all of the power, all of the authority that we have to make sure that we can heal our society.

23:49.720 --> 23:57.720
We should not in any way prepare any more children to be neo-Nazis.

23:57.720 --> 24:05.720
When you have people that deny the Holocaust, that they pretend it never happened, and that people of color keep getting killed.

24:05.720 --> 24:16.720
And it's not just the mass shootings. It's that every day, the microaggressions and the macroaggressions that people of color feel.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.720
You know, we have a huge responsibility.

24:19.720 --> 24:26.720
I know that this Board is up to the task and that we can do everything that we can to dig down deep into our schools.

24:26.720 --> 24:35.720
I would love to see in our curriculums, for instance, that before 1848, a third of the United States was Mexico.

24:35.720 --> 24:52.720
So when we tell our Latino children, or they are told by the classmates, go back where you came from, we have to say, I have to say as a Mexican-American, my family was here before the United States was the United States of America.

24:52.720 --> 25:00.720
So, si se puede, we can make it happen, and it's time. It's time. Thank you so much.

25:00.720 --> 25:08.720
Thank you, Ms. Huerta. It's amazing. Thank you for bringing us. Si se puede. Thank you for all the work that you've done and that you continue to do.

25:08.720 --> 25:14.720
And as you have said, it is indeed time. Thank you for your incredible leadership. Thank you.

25:14.720 --> 25:19.720
Also a pleasure to introduce someone who is very well known to this Board.

25:19.720 --> 25:26.720
She's a former IQC member, and she is the first African-American woman to serve as California's Secretary of State.

25:26.720 --> 25:35.720
And other than my colleague, Dr. Shirley Weber. Dr. Shirley Weber and her role has really helped to center us in our focus on ethnic studies.

25:35.720 --> 25:46.720
It's something she knows quite a bit about as a 45-year educator, as someone who I think is a foremost educator on many subjects, and who is a distinguished professor of Africana studies.

25:46.720 --> 25:53.720
It is a pleasure and an honor to introduce a colleague and friend, Dr. Shirley Weber. Dr. Weber, we are looking forward to your remarks.

25:53.720 --> 26:10.720
Thank you very much, Superintendent Thurman. And I'm always honored when I'm in the presence of Dolores Huerta, because she is such an icon and an inspiration to all of us as she continues the battle to make sure that everyone has an opportunity in the state of California and across the nation.

26:10.720 --> 26:19.720
So it's always good to be with Dolores. You know, I am honored to be here today, and I want to thank your staff and those who have worked so hard on this particular issue.

26:19.720 --> 26:28.720
Little did I know when I was appointed to the IQC that I'd be walking in the middle of the storm, but I'm accustomed to that, having been in ethnic studies for so long.

26:28.720 --> 26:37.720
When I set the responsibility to serve, I had no idea that this would be one of the major or the major issue that we would be confronted with on the IQC.

26:37.720 --> 26:48.720
I want to thank your staff has been so diligent and patient with all of us, and the IQC experience for me as a member of the legislature was quite a unique and honored experience.

26:48.720 --> 26:58.720
And even though I've moved on now to the Secretary of State position, I still have ethnic studies in my soul and in my bone, and it will never leave because of the power of it.

26:58.720 --> 27:15.720
And the fact that it continues to inform us not only in where we are the legislature, but throughout our schools, but also at the Secretary of State and the responsibility of ensuring that our communities have the same opportunity in terms of voting rights and opportunities that are there.

27:15.720 --> 27:27.720
The movement for ethnic studies that lifts the voice of many marginalized individuals has often been met with resistance and has a long legacy of over 50 years.

27:27.720 --> 27:44.720
I would have thought when I came to San Diego State University in 1972, merely to help out with a project, that I would become the center of the storm and that it would begin a life journey to basically create ethnic opportunities and ethnic studies not only for African-Americans,

27:44.720 --> 27:51.720
but working with Chicano studies and Native American studies and Asian studies across the state and the nation.

27:51.720 --> 28:03.720
Even the establishment, as we know, the first ethnic studies department was born in struggle, born in difficulty that resulted in student protests and school shutdowns and host of other things that took place.

28:03.720 --> 28:11.720
But it was so important, this journey was so important for them, that many students risked their academic careers to establish ethnic studies.

28:11.720 --> 28:20.720
I had friends at various campuses in Northridge, in the Valley and other places who fought so hard for ethnic studies that they were expelled from the university.

28:20.720 --> 28:27.720
And maybe 20 years later, they were allowed to come back and to get their degree, but they believed so strongly in the power of ethnic studies.

28:27.720 --> 28:38.720
As a department chair for many, many years of the 40 years I was at San Diego State, it became real clear to me that this would be a battle, an effort to try to eliminate and not to downgrade ethnic studies.

28:38.720 --> 28:51.720
And so it's interesting and ironic to me now that as we have fought to maintain and to keep ethnic studies, when I came into the legislature and we authored our first resolution to basically make ethnic studies a requirement across the state,

28:51.720 --> 28:57.720
and working with Mr. Alejo and now with Mr. Medina, we have continued to fight the battle.

28:57.720 --> 29:09.720
And so it's always interesting that every now and then others want to join ethnic studies, which shocks me because I know 50 years ago, being in ethnic studies was not a face of power nor position, nor was it desirable.

29:09.720 --> 29:22.720
And those of us who put our careers into ethnic studies were often told that we were participating in a dying experience, that it would not live, and that it would ruin our academic careers if we continue to talk about ethnic studies.

29:22.720 --> 29:35.720
And yet many of us persisted to do so at the peril of the fear of losing our career, but more importantly, we were excited about the fact that we were establishing something that could possibly change the very nature of the state.

29:35.720 --> 29:51.720
You know, despite decades of resistance, it's interesting that the National Education Association Review of Ethnic Studies supports that those of us in the discipline have known all along what we have known is that a well-taught ethnic studies curriculum is beneficial to all students,

29:51.720 --> 30:03.720
regardless of race, that every student's life is enhanced by the knowledge of ethnic studies, about learning about the four major groups that they have interacted with, and it transforms and changes their lives.

30:03.720 --> 30:11.720
And I say that as a professor 40 years while I've taught students across the board, my first classes were almost all African Americans.

30:11.720 --> 30:21.720
And by the time I left the university, I could look into a classroom and not tell whether it was ethnic studies or not, because it was so diverse in terms of the number of students who were taking the class.

30:21.720 --> 30:36.720
And as I've interacted with my former students, I come to realize that they are different professionals, better professionals, whether they're black, white, and Native American, Asian, Hispanic, whatever it is, they are different professionals because they have a different level of respect for others.

30:36.720 --> 30:45.720
They have a tremendous and profound knowledge of themselves, and they walk with pride and dignity in the profession in which they exist.

30:45.720 --> 30:50.720
These benefits are overwhelming for our students, and therefore we must make sure that our students have it.

30:50.720 --> 30:59.720
You know, as I listened to the students and I sat on the couple of lectures with the superintendent, they were persistent and consistent.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.720
They were saying over and over, we want this information.

31:02.720 --> 31:07.720
We are concerned that we don't have this information, that this information will propel us forward.

31:07.720 --> 31:13.720
And I know when I was at the university, students would come to the university who had no knowledge of themselves at all.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.720
And then they would be angry in the course.

31:15.720 --> 31:21.720
They'd first be angry because there was so much information that they did not have and had never been exposed to.

31:21.720 --> 31:30.720
And then they would become inspired, inspired that they had a strong legacy that they had to live up to, that they were building on something greater than themselves.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.720
And they had respect for the ancestors and those who had come before them.

31:34.720 --> 31:39.720
So it was a transformation that I saw in every class with students as to who they are and where they are.

31:39.720 --> 31:46.720
And I stay in touch with these students across the nation, across the world, who are really very different kinds of professionals who make a difference.

31:46.720 --> 31:49.720
This model curriculum that we have is critical.

31:49.720 --> 31:55.720
It is very, very important because without it, there is very little structure to ethnic studies across the state.

31:55.720 --> 32:05.720
If we're going to have a discipline that we respect, one of the things we learned in developing ethnic studies when I was at San Diego State is that in the beginning we were just struggling to survive.

32:05.720 --> 32:17.720
And then once we had to survive, we had to develop some disciplines and guidelines that helped to develop the curriculum so that students could go from campus to campus or from university to university

32:17.720 --> 32:23.720
and discover that they had the core knowledge and the basic knowledge to basically survive in ethnic studies.

32:23.720 --> 32:35.720
This will give us the parameters of a discipline and it will help the instructors to know exactly what they need to be working on, what the outcome should be, and how they can basically discuss the session.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.720
It's interesting that this criticism will continue. I can guarantee you that.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.720
That it will continue, that the robust conversation will continue to go on.

32:44.720 --> 32:58.720
It has in ethnic studies, after over 50 years, we still have these robust conversations about what is in the discipline, what is not in the discipline, what's appropriate kind of material to use, and we will find that robust discussion.

32:58.720 --> 33:02.720
It will continue, but most importantly, we must understand that we must take this first step.

33:02.720 --> 33:08.720
That curriculum is not a static thing that doesn't grow, that doesn't expand, but you have to take the first step.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.720
And we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

33:12.720 --> 33:17.720
We will not find the perfect curriculum, but we have found a good curriculum, one that is strong.

33:17.720 --> 33:23.720
We have found some course outlines that will give us the kind of focus that we need, and we have to move forward.

33:23.720 --> 33:27.720
It is about time. It is about time that we finally take that step.

33:27.720 --> 33:34.720
We took the step at the Cal State University and this coming fall, all students will be required to take at least three units of ethnic studies.

33:34.720 --> 33:41.720
A requirement at the CSU that's a half a million students at Cal State University will be exposed to ethnic studies.

33:41.720 --> 33:54.720
They then should lay the foundation for our teachers and the training of our teachers so that they then too can begin to have the kind of support and resources they need to be excellent educators in our K-12 system.

33:54.720 --> 34:04.720
So I'm honored to be here with you today. I strongly urge you to move forward with this proposal that we do not dilly-dally and wait for anymore because we have done the work.

34:04.720 --> 34:15.720
You have done the work. You have basically developed a strong curriculum, and it is time for California to move forward with this curriculum on behalf of our students and those professionals who have invested in this.

34:15.720 --> 34:21.720
As I said, there will always be an opportunity for criticism. There will always be an opportunity for expansion.

34:21.720 --> 34:34.720
Nothing is perfect, but we must move forward to make sure that this moves forward with us and that we will at some point, hopefully this year, arrive at an understanding that ethnic studies is not only recommended, but ethnic studies will be required.

34:34.720 --> 34:37.720
Thanks so very much.

34:37.720 --> 34:52.720
Thank you, Secretary of State Weber. Your story is a powerful testimony to the importance of ethnic studies when you talk about your father coming to California to avoid the racist acts of the Ku Klux Klan and others.

34:52.720 --> 35:04.720
Your journey to become a legislator and Secretary of State, you know, the powerful stories you share with our students as part of our Black History Month and ethnic studies series, we're grateful.

35:04.720 --> 35:11.720
As you have said, as Dolores Huerta has said, it is time. Thank you, Secretary of State Weber. Thank you.

35:11.720 --> 35:19.720
Next, I'd like to introduce Assemblymember James Ramos. Assemblymember Ramos is the first person of Native American descent to serve in California legislature.

35:19.720 --> 35:33.720
Assemblymember Ramos has worked on many important pieces of legislation, but he has made at the forefront of his tenure of how do we create a stronger and robust Native American studies curriculum in California.

35:33.720 --> 35:57.720
He has contributed to this particular curriculum draft. He has served in our conversations with students in our mini series on ethnic studies, and he is continuing to work with us in the state on how we change the narrative about what we teach California students about Native American studies and Native American people so that it is correct and accurate and does no harm to our people.

35:57.720 --> 36:02.720
He's one of our newest members to the IQC. It's a pleasure to introduce Assemblymember James Ramos.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.720
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent for that introduction.

36:06.720 --> 36:19.720
I just want to start with acknowledging California's first people who have been in California since time immemorial and all of the ancestors that have come before me so that we could have this voice to speak on their behalf.

36:19.720 --> 36:32.720
This model curriculum, ethnic studies, is something that's needed for the first step to start to educate the state of California on all the different culture and diversity that's here in the state of California.

36:32.720 --> 36:47.720
When we talk about the mission systems, when the Spanish missionary period came, yet we don't have a sound document talking about the atrocities genocide that was inflicted upon the California Indian people.

36:47.720 --> 36:57.720
When the state of California has the largest number of tribes, when the Spanish missionary started their incursion here, we have to make sure that those voices are not forgotten about.

36:57.720 --> 37:07.720
And this ethnic study starts to pave the way to enjoy that relationship and to the advocacy to make sure that awareness is coming out.

37:07.720 --> 37:24.720
Also, when we talk about atrocities, atrocities in the history of the state of California, we cannot talk about the history of the state of California unless we're going to be able to talk about the atrocities and genocide that took place against California's first people.

37:24.720 --> 37:35.720
For my own tribe, in 1866, a militia was formed and paid by the state legislature to go into the San Bernardino Mountains to rid the mountains of all Indian people.

37:35.720 --> 37:41.720
And my clan, the Yojaveitam clan, was one that was pushed to almost extermination.

37:41.720 --> 37:47.720
Our clan dwindled down to less than 30 members, but we're still here.

37:47.720 --> 37:53.720
It's those types of stories, those types of history that needs to be told throughout the state of California.

37:53.720 --> 38:05.720
This certainly happened in the San Bernardino Mountains, but it also happened throughout the state of California, where many tribes have those same stories to share with educating the state of California.

38:05.720 --> 38:13.720
We also know that tribal governments many times out date many governments here in the state of California.

38:13.720 --> 38:28.720
So we also want to look at when we start to move forward in the governmental scheme, when we learn about the federal government, state government, local government, that we're also learning about tribal governments and the sovereignty that they have and why this is important.

38:28.720 --> 38:40.720
I was able to sit on the State Board of Education. I was appointed by Governor Brown in 2011, and there still is some members there that we sat with for that period of time.

38:40.720 --> 38:57.720
But myself and Jim Eshwanden and the board that's there, we appointed a special superintendent to the Round Valley School District, where the Native American population in that district was as high as 70%, yet the graduation rates were not there.

38:57.720 --> 39:03.720
People weren't even getting into the high school level. They were there at the junior high level.

39:03.720 --> 39:12.720
So we see that that educational attainment gap is still very real in the state of California, particularly to the California Indian people.

39:12.720 --> 39:28.720
And so why this is important because when the governor comes forward and issues an apology for atrocities and genocide inflicted upon the California people is through education that we start to be aware of what truly happened.

39:28.720 --> 39:45.720
And then that starts to build that individual to be able to overcome those obstacles, because now what we've been saying in Indian country is now validated throughout the system and education, therefore allowing people to achieve their educational dreams.

39:45.720 --> 39:50.720
These are things that are very much important. This is a first step in moving forward.

39:50.720 --> 40:10.720
And we also do have different pieces of bills and legislation that we're continuing to move forward to reaffirm the standards in the educational system to continue to teach on California's first people of the atrocities and also the contributions that makes the state what it is.

40:10.720 --> 40:20.720
One of the things that a lot of times people don't know about is the different music and the different stories that are individually to the different tribes in the state of California.

40:20.720 --> 40:32.720
And one song individually talks about how the world was dark and the moon says, well, I like the way for the people at night. And the sun said, well, I like the way for the people during the day.

40:32.720 --> 40:47.720
And the cottontail rabbit said, well, make a trail for the people at nighttime that will lead them to water. And the jack rabbit, the brush rabbit says, well, I'll make the way for the people during the day so they could find nourishment and the water that's there.

40:47.720 --> 41:04.720
I truly support ethnic studies in this model curriculum as the first step to addressing California's first people. And Mr. Superintendent, if I can leave you with a traditional Kuya bird song that talks about how the world was dark and names the moon and the sun.

41:04.720 --> 41:13.720
This is culture from the state of California that we're able now because of this curriculum to start to engage the students here in the state of California.

41:43.720 --> 42:07.720
Thank you.

42:07.720 --> 42:09.720
Thank you.

42:09.720 --> 42:26.720
That was almost incredible. Thank you that you would share traditional bird song with us, that you would share some of the origin of the music, that your advocacy for what we teach about California's first people be accurate and correct and true.

42:26.720 --> 42:41.720
That talk about some of the very difficult things that have really not been told truthfully in history, but also the important contributions of California's first people. We're grateful for your leadership and your friendship. Thank you again, Assemblymember Ramos.

42:41.720 --> 42:45.720
Thank you.

42:45.720 --> 43:00.720
We have a number of Assemblymembers on. Many of them have to be in committees and also have to report to the legislative floor. We appreciate you staying with us as long as you can, but we also recognize that legislative business has called you. Thank you again, Assemblymember Ramos.

43:00.720 --> 43:12.720
It's a pleasure now to introduce Dr. Karen Korematsu. Dr. Korematsu is the founder and leader of the Fred Korematsu Institute.

43:12.720 --> 43:32.720
It's named after her late father, the civil rights icon, Fred Korematsu, who was detained in an incarceration camp, in a Japanese incarceration camp, who later challenged the orders and really created a lifetime of work of civil rights and speaking up and speaking out.

43:32.720 --> 44:00.720
Dr. Korematsu has continued to do this wonderful institute with a focus on racial equity and racial justice. I want to thank Dr. Korematsu for her personal time and work in challenging us to do more, in challenging us to do better, to strengthen many parts of the curriculum, and in particular, many of the sections that speak to the experiences of Asian American and Pacific Islanders in California and in the nation.

44:00.720 --> 44:15.720
Thank you, Dr. Korematsu, for always speaking truth to power and speaking about how we need change in this country as it relates to racial justice. It is an honor to introduce, for some remarks, Dr. Karen Korematsu.

44:15.720 --> 44:29.720
Thank you, Superintendent Thurman, for that kind introduction. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and State Board of Education members. I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this morning.

44:29.720 --> 44:49.720
I'm a native Californian. I was born in Oakland and attended public schools in the East Bay. All during that time, I experienced racism and prejudice because of my Japanese ancestry. This occurred year after year, especially around the time of the anniversary of Pearl Harbor on December 7.

44:49.720 --> 45:05.720
My classmates would say, it was my fault for the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Go home. Go back to where you came from. You don't belong here. And it was a very difficult time, and I kept all that to myself.

45:05.720 --> 45:32.720
Made excuses not to ride the school bus. Just was waiting for the Christmas break because usually by the time the school started again, the students had forgotten. But the problem also was because the teachers did not really have the education about Japanese American culture, about the different cultures in this country.

45:32.720 --> 45:53.720
And so they were not able to change the minds of these students. In some ways, they perpetuated it by saying, oh, the Japanese were very bad people. They came over and killed over 2,000 servicemen in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

45:53.720 --> 46:18.720
And so that was the kind of education that I had. And unfortunately, it hasn't changed that much. And that's why the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is important. It's a starting point. It's not an end point. And we all need to remember that.

46:18.720 --> 46:38.720
This is a pivotal moment in our California education history. And we continue to face not only a global pandemic, but also an epidemic of prolonged racial, ethnic, and social injustice in our country. That's quite obvious.

46:38.720 --> 47:03.720
You know, the anti-Black and anti-Asian hate violence is on the rise. Each day, I'm reminded of the importance of what my father said, of standing up for what is right. And in honoring my father's legacy, Fred Korematsu, who resisted the incarceration during World War II and fought to uphold justice for marginalized groups throughout his life.

47:03.720 --> 47:19.720
This is not just a Japanese-American story or a West Coast story. It's an American story. And those are the kinds of stories that we want our students to learn, this generation and future generations.

47:19.720 --> 47:36.720
The fight for justice and racial equity and human rights begins with education. There is no place more important than the public education classroom for sharing the truths, histories, and voices of all peoples.

47:36.720 --> 47:59.720
You know, the work that we do at the Korematsu Institute is to bridge my father's story with varied topics in history, including civil rights heroes and movements of World War II, the Constitution, global human rights, and Asian-American history, and the intersectionality of ethnic studies.

47:59.720 --> 48:11.720
We make connections to present-day civil rights discrimination and political scapegoating, and as mass incarceration, the anti-immigrant sentiment and Islamophobia.

48:11.720 --> 48:34.720
Fundamental to our work is how we raise awareness by developing programs to promote civic education and supporting policy and legislation. We build partnerships and educate our communities on the importance of broadening the narrative to include historically marginalized groups, and we bring people together on issues of race and social justice.

48:34.720 --> 48:51.720
Ethnic studies promises a higher level of engagement for traditionally marginalized student groups, heightened awareness of civic and cultural engagement, and a broader acceptance for the experience of others.

48:51.720 --> 49:08.720
It's been a noble challenge, ambitious, and certainly not without its detractors. Still, the progress has been vigorous, including tremendous stakeholder input, multiple rounds and revisions, and significant debate, as we well know.

49:08.720 --> 49:32.720
Also, I want to thank Superintendent Thurman and his staff at CDE, who have really made an effort to be inclusive, to show diversity. I've been through countless Zoom meetings, I can tell you, in trying to work especially on the API lesson plans, which has been numerous.

49:32.720 --> 49:44.720
Because some people don't realize there are so many different Asian ethnicities, especially in the state of California, and certainly everyone's story wants to be told.

49:44.720 --> 50:06.720
But even, for example, for Japanese Americans, I could have said, okay, we want a lesson plan about Fred Korematsu. No, this is not what ethnic studies is about. This is about learning our different cultures, the history that we all bring to the state and to this country.

50:06.720 --> 50:26.720
Unless we are indigenous American Indians, we are immigrants, and immigration is an important story that we need to tell, that we have more shared struggles than we do differences.

50:26.720 --> 50:43.720
We are more alike than not. That's what ethnic studies brings to our education for this generation and future generations. And as I said, this is a starting point, not an end point.

50:43.720 --> 51:03.720
There is going to be a repository, as I think the board members know, of the four other lesson plans that can be added along the way. They certainly have to comply to the California state standards, which is going to be important.

51:03.720 --> 51:23.720
But this is a framework, and the essential part in helping to shape the formation of ideas and the robust content-rich curriculum and experiences of the Asian Pacific Islanders, I am so proud to have been a part of that.

51:23.720 --> 51:39.720
It hasn't been easy, and certainly, you know, I'm even hearing this morning a lot of pushback. But I can tell you, I am committed to also making sure that this curriculum evolves.

51:39.720 --> 51:55.720
And I want to also encourage the Board of Education members to be sure that there is a budget in there that will help with teacher development for ethnic studies.

51:55.720 --> 52:12.720
Teaching ethnic studies is a different approach to our education. And it's like, you know, not everyone, I can tell you, teachers are going to be mad at me, but not every teacher can write a good lesson plan.

52:12.720 --> 52:28.720
Well, not all teachers have the tools to teach about ethnic studies, because there is a diversity. That also, the humanity behind ethnic studies is one that we want to promote.

52:28.720 --> 52:40.720
You know, we want to promote also teaching respect. I never thought I would get to this age in my life where we would have to teach about respect and moral principles.

52:40.720 --> 52:53.720
These are kinds of lessons that we will come out of ethnic studies. I know we have a long ways to go, but you know, the path ahead will not be without controversy.

52:53.720 --> 53:10.720
The struggles against injustice need to be embedded in the lessons that become our common history. I strongly support the ethnic studies model curriculum, and I hope that the Board of Education will vote this through.

53:10.720 --> 53:25.720
That, as my father said, stand up for what is right. And, you know, prejudice is ignorance, and the most powerful weapon that we have is education.

53:25.720 --> 53:32.720
We have an opportunity, and now is the time to take action. Thank you.

53:32.720 --> 53:57.720
Thank you, Dr. Korematsu for your wonderful remarks to your leadership. For all of those Zoom meetings, you were correct, it was extensive, but you helped us to connect with other leaders who had stories to share, and thank you for stewarding many of the conversations that allowed us to really broaden and strengthen the Asian American and Pacific Islander content.

53:57.720 --> 54:12.720
And as you said, any curriculum must evolve, and it will continue to evolve, and there are proposed resources in the proposed state budget that would do, as you say, support teacher development.

54:12.720 --> 54:28.720
We all know that these are difficult topics sometimes to unpack, and it really requires training and support to be able to facilitate that. So thank you again for your leadership and your commitment to the ongoing evolution of this process. Thank you very much.

54:28.720 --> 54:43.720
Good morning, everyone. Good morning. I'm Dr. Darlene Hamming, and I'm State Board members. I'm Dr. Dan Lee, the Deputy Superintendent of Equity. I'm here to introduce our next speaker, which is Dr. Olefe Asante.

54:43.720 --> 54:55.720
He is the Professor and Chair of the Department of African American Studies at Temple University. He's a leading expert in African studies and also African American studies.

54:55.720 --> 55:15.720
He's published over 77 books and probably still counting at least 500 articles, and he's the president of the Olefe Asante Institute. And I would like to say Frank, so Dr. Asante, the floor is yours.

55:15.720 --> 55:37.720
Thank you very much, Dr. Lee, and I want to say to Madam President Darlene Hamming and to Superintendent Thurman, I am very delighted and happy to be here, and I give praises first to the ancestors of the First Nations people.

55:37.720 --> 55:54.720
Our meeting today has been so powerful already. I've learned so much from so many of the outstanding speakers, and I've been inspired already over again with the powerful presentations.

55:54.720 --> 56:23.720
And there's a confluence for me with this meeting, and that is that Secretary of Education, Superintendent of Education Thurman, and also the Secretary of State, Shirley Weber, both have crossed my path as students, either at UCLA or at Tilbury University.

56:23.720 --> 56:46.720
And I have heard quoted one of my recent students, Ibram Kendi, who wrote the book, How to Be an Anti-Racist. So I'm feeling quite happy today with this discussion and with the discourse that has gone on around this whole question of ethnic studies.

56:46.720 --> 57:08.720
And I do give a lot of credit to Shanine Coates and others on the panel who have been really profoundly focused on ensuring that we get this right. California is a leader, and California will be a leader in the nation.

57:08.720 --> 57:31.720
I am familiar with many parts of this country, and of course I travel the world, but in my judgment, there is no place on the earth more significant for ethnic studies to create the model for the rest of the world than California.

57:31.720 --> 57:47.720
And you have done it already with what you have achieved. This achievement, it will go down in history as a historic moment where we have taken into consideration a number of things.

57:47.720 --> 58:02.720
And I think that if we understand what we have done, we will see that we can advance it. And many people have said that the ethnic studies curriculum is not static, and that is true.

58:02.720 --> 58:17.720
But the nation is not static. It's dynamic. America today, the United States of America today is not what it was 100 years ago or 200 years ago, and it will not be the same 100 years from now.

58:17.720 --> 58:32.720
The nation is dynamic, but the nation was born with a number of strikes against the proper understanding of culture and ethnicity and relationships.

58:32.720 --> 58:45.720
It was born with the genocide of the native peoples. It was born with the enslavement of the Africans, the dispossession of the Mexicans, and the mistreatment of women.

58:45.720 --> 59:02.720
It was later developed with the exclusion acts against Asian people and the incarceration of Japanese people I went to school with at UCLA in the 1960s had come out of the concentration camps.

59:02.720 --> 59:23.720
So I understand that what we have done in California, particularly as we have developed this curriculum, what we have done is something that is unique in this country, but has to become the model for everyone else.

59:23.720 --> 59:32.720
It cannot remain the same. And here is the problem. I mean, we recognize that a number of people have spoken to it today.

59:32.720 --> 59:57.720
The problem in the American society, and we know this from the killing of the eight people and the six Asian women in Georgia, is that there still remains among many of our citizens in this country, this racial ladder, this perception of other people as less than.

59:57.720 --> 01:00:24.720
And this means that the ethnic studies curriculum is not just for those of us from particular ethnicities, but it has to be enlarged to take into consideration many of the white citizens in this country who have no understanding of the notion of humanity.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:39.720
Because basically, and one of the reasons I've always thought that interconnectivity was a better word, at least for me, that intersectionality is because one of the things that we have to understand, there's only one race in the world, and that's the human race.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:59.720
If you know that there's only one race, it's human race, I don't care who comes to me or who I meet, I see that person as a human being. And if you see that person as a human being, then there is no racial ladder with hierarchy and patriarchy.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:13.720
These are the things that create this need for people to talk about intersectionality. But if you talk about humans, there's a whole different thing. And you can talk about culture, because culture is different.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:28.720
But to talk about racial ladders and the perception that the police, for example, we often say the police, often they have a perception that African American males will bring trouble. Where do they get their perception from?

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:40.720
Who created that perception? Who created a notion that white people were superior to other people? African people didn't create that. Who created the idea that African people were lazy?

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:55.720
Which is, of course, no truer or falser than any other group of people. Why would you create that? Who created that? And who acts on the basis of those hierarchies?

01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:08.720
That's what we have to get rid of, the ranking, the racial ranking. If we can get rid of the racial ranking, and we get through that with the ethnic studies curriculum, we are approaching that.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:28.720
That's why many speakers have said it's an initiative. It's a first step. Because the ultimate step is to get to the point where people see that, and they won't see it unless we keep training and teaching that yes, you're not alone in the world.

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:42.720
You don't exist in the society by yourself. I was talking to a group of students last week, and I was telling them, we talk about the GPS system, and everybody looks to figure out how do I get from here to there.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:59.720
And I said, you don't know, you don't realize that Gladys West, who invented that system, was an African American woman. Because we only think in terms of the perceptions that have been given to us.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:19.720
And so I was very happy and pleased to have worked with the African American content area. And we have a very robust area. I mean, when you start thinking about this history, more than 100 different African ethnic groups were brought to this country.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:42.720
The African American community is in many ways a quintessential American community because we have we have people from many of them. If you look at people from the African American community, you have many different African groups that have come together.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:59.720
Africa is not a country, it's a continent. And there there are over 3000 languages spoken on that continent. And over 100 of them came with those languages and ethnicities were brought to America and during the slave trade.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:13.720
Millions of people crossing the Atlantic and then forming a community and creating a language and creating music out of that experience. It's a very profound experience.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:29.720
And when you think about it in the African American community, we have we have people who who represent almost all of the ethnicities in the country. Because in the African American community, there are you don't talk about purity of the ethnicity.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:43.720
We don't talk about where you get all because in all of our families in my family, I'm thinking particularly of my family. I have people from many several ethnic communities are in my family.

01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:56.720
They are African Americans. We accept African Americans that way. That's that's the future. The future of America is that we see people as humans and we accept people as humans.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:09.720
And when we do that, we will be profoundly rewarded with a community that is the model for the rest of the world. California, I am so happy that I went to UCLA.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:29.720
I'm so happy that my wife was was grew up in Pasadena. I'm just so proud to know Superintendent Thurman and Secretary Weber because and all the people that I have met and known about.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:43.720
Certainly, of course, Matthew's family. I know very well. I'm so happy to just be with all of you and appreciate it very much and and give honor to all the ancestors of Assemblyman Ramos.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:47.720
Take care. Thank you.

01:05:47.720 --> 01:06:05.720
Thank you, Dr. Asante. I don't dare say anything after that, just to let that land, but would take a moment of just thanks with all of your writing and all of your teaching that you would help us to fine tune and strengthen this draft and particular

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:24.720
the stories of the African American experience. We are grateful and just a moment of personal pride to be a graduate of Temple University. I also want to acknowledge that our distinguished board president, Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, is also a member of the Temple University family and Dr. Daniel Lee.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:33.720
And just want you to know that Temple Owls are everywhere. Thank you, Dr. Asante.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:43.720
Good morning, Board President Darling-Hammond, Superintendent Thurman and State Board members. I'm Dan Thigpen, Deputy Superintendent for Communications at the California Department of Education.

01:06:43.720 --> 01:07:00.720
As we've heard here today and in many instances for many of our powerful speakers, we're hearing about the power of the classroom and of ethnic studies to help advance equity and justice for all students and to amplify the voices that have often been ignored in public education.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:13.720
And as we've seen throughout this past year, we know that there are multiple lanes for education to have the power to end hate in all forms and bigotry and bias against so many communities.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:34.720
Our AAPI communities, we saw tragically earlier this week, anti-black violence, our LGBTQ communities, and our state superintendent has worked hard to engage all stakeholders and educators in areas where we can leverage and create paths in the classroom to help end hate of all forms.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:51.720
We've seen rising incidents of anti-Semitism and other forms of hate. And I'd like to introduce now, to talk a little bit about that, Tyler Gregory. He's the Executive Director of the Jewish Community Relations Council.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:08:07.720
Thank you so much, and thank you to Superintendent Thurman and the CDE staff, members of the SVE, the governor and his team, and our friends in the legislature like Senator Allen and Assemblymembers Gabriel Chu and Medina for your friendship with the California Jewish community throughout this process.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:15.720
I'm the descendant of Holocaust survivors, and it's my duty to ensure that this state and this country remains safe for the Jewish community.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:28.720
We come together just two months after a capital insurrection that saw sweatshirts emblazoned with six million is not enough in just two years after synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh and Poway near San Diego, which is my hometown.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:35.720
And the chilling chant heard in Charlottesville of Jews will not replace us still echo in all of our ears.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:50.720
While anti-Semitism extends far beyond America's borders and history, it is also quite often a symptom of other sicknesses in our country, like declining faith in our democracy, like white supremacy, like hyper polarization and division.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:09:07.720
With this in mind, we must walk and chew gum at the same time, combat anti-Semitism wherever it appears, while working with our neighbors to chip away at the deep rot beneath other forms of oppression like racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, homophobia, and transphobia.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:23.720
So as our Asian Pacific Islander neighbors reel from Tuesday's tragic Atlanta shooting, as our African American neighbors call for national reckoning after the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others worth naming, as our Latino neighbors are targeted and scapegoated by xenophobes.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:37.720
And as the stories and lands of indigenous peoples are erased, we recognize that the systemic injustices facing our neighboring communities of color and Jews of color often stem from the same root causes of rising anti-Semitism in our country.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:45.720
Education is an essential strategy in combating these injustices. To that end, I say that we need ethnic studies now.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:53.720
Ethnic studies gives marginalized communities the agency to define and share their own cultures, stories, histories, and traditions.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:09.720
As Jewish Americans, we relate to this urgent need. For too long in our classrooms, and I know from my own experiences in San Diego public schools, Jewish identity has been flattened and distorted to that of a white religious minority, taking little note of our global peoplehood, history, diversity, and oppression.

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:15.720
Not to mention erasing Jews of color and Jews from the Middle East and North Africa almost entirely.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:25.720
We appreciate, for example, that Holocaust education appears in social studies courses, but education about Jews must be so much more than what has happened to us.

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:36.720
For consideration today are the inclusions of two Jewish lesson plans that obliterate the notion that Jews are a monolithic group and the lift up segments of our community that have too often gone invisible.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:49.720
Our crucial inclusion presents our own chance to impart the richness of our people so that future generations hear the dog whistles of anti-Semitism and other forms of oppression that too often fall on deaf ears.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:11:06.720
The Department of Education has devised a curriculum that honors the four founding disciplines of ethnic studies and lifts up four additional communities with a deep history and commitment to our state with the inter-ethnic bridge building section for Jewish Americans, Arab Americans, Armenian Americans, and Sikh Americans.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.720
We know that we cannot rest after today's deliberations.

01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:32.720
My organization, the Jewish Community Relations Council, and our Jewish community partners will work tirelessly in partnership with the CDE and school districts across our state to ensure this curriculum is used inclusively in our classrooms to elevate the stories and experiences of people of color and ensure the teaching of Jewish and other lessons in the inter-ethnic bridge building section.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:37.720
Thank you for having me.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:48.720
Good morning again. My name is Dr. Daniel Lee. I'm the Deputy Superintendent of Equally with the California Department of Education, and I'm here to introduce our next speaker.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:12:10.720
Our next speaker is Maha El-Ghanati. She's the Founder and Chief Innovation Officer of the Islamic Network Group. She has authored handbooks on outreach to Muslim American communities and also training on cultural competency with Muslim and Arab Americans.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:19.720
You may also know or remember her from our Ed to End Hate webinar series where she presented on strategies to combat Islamophobia.

01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:35.720
But I want to also elevate one award today that she received. She received many of them, but the one that stood out for me today was she was presented with the Civil Rights Leadership Award from the California Association of Human Relations Organizations.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:41.720
So we're honored to have you and the floor is yours, Ms. El-Ghanati.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.720
Thank you so much, Dr. Lee. I really appreciate it.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:56.720
The wonderful introduction and I'm so honored to be among the group of speakers that I heard and I was in tears throughout listening to all of you.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:05.720
Let me begin by saying good morning and also by thanking State Superintendent Thurmond for the invitation to speak with you all today.

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:17.720
I am thrilled that finally, based on AB 2016, that we're seeing the first version of the ethnic studies model curriculum being voted on today.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:25.720
This comes after years of input by community groups of which some continue to seek additional changes.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:40.720
And I expect that the process will never be complete because the subject matter of ethnic studies is both deeply personal and directly impactful to marginalized groups, as we've all heard.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:14:00.720
Speaking as an Arab American and a Muslim American, I grew up in the 70s and 80s at a time when Arabs were taught about not in the context of the rich history of Arab Americans, but rather in the context of American foreign and domestic policy interests.

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:22.720
So in the 70s, Arabs were framed in the context of the oil embargo by the Saudis and the October War between Egypt, Syria and Israel, where Arabs in both cases were portrayed as enemies of the state working against the interests of the United States, which was and continues, of course, to be interest in oil.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:51.720
That image of the Arab as enemy continued to get worse and conflated with Islam and Muslims after every major conflict in the Middle East where the U.S. was involved from U.S. involvement in Iran, not an Arab country, by the way, which led to the hostage crisis in 1979 to our military involvement in Lebanon in the early 80s to the first Persian Gulf War in the early 90s.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:15:19.720
Our invasion of Iraq in the early 2000s, followed by the NCERS special registration program here in the United States for people of the Middle East, the war against ISIS in Iraq and so forth, where it got to the point that in the presidential elections in 2016, as many of you will recall, the candidates were literally competing with each other on who disparaged Muslims the most.

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:36.720
All of which continue to reinforce a completely distorted representation of Muslims slash Arabs today, both completely different communities, by the way, and these misrepresentations, of course, didn't begin in my lifetime.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:47.720
They began as early as the Crusades and really take concrete form during the colonial period and become incorporated in the creation of whiteness in the United States.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:57.720
So distorted narratives about Arabs and Muslims who are now racialized as non-whites have a very long history in the United States.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:14.720
So as an Arab, as a female in hijab, like myself, who is Muslim and not white, experiences the cumulative effects of multiple forms of discrimination, which for our children in schools is especially critical.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:26.720
And of course, for educators, much of this requires knowledge and lesson plans, as has been pointed out, and that are part of which are included in the model curriculum.

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:33.720
And so this is the kind of material that makes ethnic studies so important and so relevant.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.720
It's not just about marginalized groups.

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:41.720
It's really about understanding America from the perspective of the American people.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:52.720
Therefore, the California government attempting to do this is quite remarkable if you think about it and not without its challenges as we've all experienced.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:17:00.720
And so this current ethnic studies model curriculum is a very good start for the government and a work in progress.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:13.720
And it will be one of many useful documents that will be made available by the state, including documents by community groups that will guide teachers in their teaching of ethnic studies in the classroom.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:20.720
Our organization, Islamic Networks Group, is one of these community groups offering material for educators.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:29.720
We were very happy to contribute to CDE lesson plans relating to Islamophobia and its relationship to other forms of bigotry.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.720
In fact, two of our lesson plans were incorporated in the model curriculum, specifically on dominant narratives.

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:43.720
You can find the rest of our anti-racism lesson plans on our website at ing.org.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:57.720
We were also very happy to join the CDE's education to end hate, as Dr. Lee pointed out, by conducting a webinar on Islamophobia, which provided educators with tangible teaching tools.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:07.720
And again, at our website at ing.org, we have dozens of other lesson plans relating to Muslims in the context of religious and cultural pluralism.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:25.720
And we also provide educators with panels of live speakers and presenters on dozens of related topics where we go out with Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and people of various ethnic backgrounds to give these presentations.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:38.720
Finally, I want to end with my very sincere gratitude to State Superintendent Thurman and his entire team for working so hard and for being great allies to work with.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.720
I know how hard they've worked because I was there with them and the pressure that they were under in pulling it all together.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:59.720
I encourage the board to approve this version of the model curriculum as I do community groups to continue working with the CDE and each other on this incredibly important project of ethnic studies for the sake of our children.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:06.720
Thank you.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:17.720
Buenos dias, Madam President Darlene Hammond, Superintendent Thurman, and board members. My name is Jenny Carrion, and I am the Deputy Superintendent of Strategic Planning and Special Projects.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:29.720
I arrived to this country in third grade from Juarez Chihuahua to East Los Angeles, and I remember very vividly my ancestors' history and contributions never being taught in any of my classrooms.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:39.720
So today I'm very excited that I get to introduce one of my favorite authors, was once an LAUSD student and went on to be a member of Stanford University's history department.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:45.720
Dr. Albert Camarillo is a founding scholar of the field of Mexican American history and Chicano studies.

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:58.720
He was also instrumental with the Latinx studies portion of this curriculum, and we're fortunate that his invaluable knowledge on why diversity matters will now be taught in classrooms across the state, not just in universities.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.720
Dr. Camarillo.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.720
Thank you, Ms. Carrion, and thank you to Superintendent Thurman.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.720
Good morning to all board members.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:16.720
I'm going to share a few comments with you about the Ethics Studies Model Curriculum.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:36.720
And I followed the path of this both curricular project and political project for many years and most recently was invited by Superintendent Thurman and his staff to review parts of the document, especially the sections on the approaches to Latino studies and comparative studies in race and ethnicity.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:48.720
I recently reviewed the document with the edits by the Instructional Quality Commission, and I strongly endorse the revised and edited document.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:21:05.720
And this document, I know you are aware of this, reflects a huge commitment of time and energy and expertise by so many thoughtful educators and others to develop an outcome that is both substantive and informative.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:14.720
Now, this Ethics Studies Model Curriculum is an important reference guide for teachers, for school administrators, for staff and others.

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:32.720
Now, as Shanine mentioned in her opening comments, it is not a blueprint per se for the incorporation and implementation of Ethics Studies Curriculum, but it is a critically important roadmap and guidepost that is greatly needed in public education.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:47.720
Others have spoke to this, and appropriately so. The lessons of the past and the realities of the present day tell us that the time is now. It is now to adopt this Ethics Studies Model Curriculum.

01:21:47.720 --> 01:22:05.720
And as one of the founding historians of Chicano Studies and Latino Studies, it gives me enormous pride to see that our state, California, is on the threshold of including an Ethics Studies Curriculum for, and I want to underscore, all teachers, underscore all students.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:23.720
Now, I've seen firsthand the impact of a culturally relevant, culturally sustaining curriculum. Over the last dozen years, I helped, I worked with history and social science high school teachers in two charter schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:40.720
First, with the East Palo Alto Academy, and more recently with the Luis Valdez Leadership Academy in San Jose, to implement a curriculum required of all ninth graders in Chicano Studies, Mexican American Studies.

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:53.720
I have seen firsthand, in working with the teachers and working with the students, the transformative nature, the motivation that is gained by students engaging with Ethics Studies.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:23:10.720
And of course, at Stanford, for the last 45 years, I've taught Ethics Studies Related courses. I've seen there, too, that all students benefit tremendously from a foundation of knowledge about diversity in our society.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:28.720
And that's why I think it is so fundamentally important at this moment, at this time, at this moment of racial reckoning, once again, in our society, that we move forward in a creative and innovative way to bring this curriculum to our students.

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:53.720
And I will tell you upfront, I've been working, and Superintendent Thurmond and the staff know this as well, I've been working based upon the implementation of that pilot project in charter schools and Ethics Studies to move forward with the online comprehensive comparative studies and race and ethnicity curriculum for all California teachers and all California students.

01:23:53.720 --> 01:24:09.720
So that in one stop on the Internet, they can go to, in the next few years, a comprehensive online curriculum that will make Ethics Studies so available to all.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.720
So I thank you again for the chance to meet with you this morning, even if only for a few minutes.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.720
Good luck with your important work during this unprecedented period.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:38.720
Good morning, State Board members. Thank you for allowing me to be here today. My name is Mary Nicely, and I'm the Senior Policy Advisor to the Superintendent.

01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:53.720
As a Burmese-American, I am so proud to have been able to work with the API community to bring the community's voice into the ESMC. Thank you, Dr. Korematsu, for all of your guidance and the API School Board Members Association.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:25:00.720
Right now I have the honor to introduce Manufo Anawaik, a champion of the Pacific Islander community.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:15.720
Over a decade ago, Manufo founded Camp Unity in Daly City to have a summer camp where Pacific Islander Polynesian youth could learn about their heritage and feel seen in her in a community that saw them as others.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:24.720
Manufo is a trustee with the Jefferson Elementary School District in San Mateo County and co-chairs the Superintendent's Closing the Opportunity Gap Initiative.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:38.720
Thank you for your support in convening Pacific Islander educators and stakeholders for input and bringing the Pacific Islander voice to the ESMC. Welcome, Trustee Anawaik.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:53.720
Greetings, everyone. Tzalofa and Tzayel Manwea. I, too, would like to pay respect to our First Nation, and I'm deeply honored to be able to share this space with everyone on this meeting.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:26:12.720
I'm really emotional. I say to myself, who am I? Who am I to share this time to be able to offer and lend my voice with such esteemed leaders in this work?

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:25.720
I say that I am ethnic studies. That is who I am. That is who I am in my community. That is the voice that I will continue to lend in this work.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:46.720
I want to extend my gratitude to the honorable members of the Board of Education, to the IQC, and especially to State Superintendent, my brother, Tony Thurman, for ensuring that the Pacific Islander community had the opportunity to revisit the initial draft.

01:26:46.720 --> 01:27:00.720
When we saw that we didn't feel that it was a reflection of our community, he allowed us to go in together. It was important to him to ensure that this was an inclusive conversation.

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:17.720
And for me, ethnic studies is just an opportunity for us to formalize ethnic studies outside of the classrooms, because this continues to happen. We've seen all of the teachings happen in our homes, in our neighborhoods.

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:43.720
What ethnic studies allows us to do is to bring it into our learning circles. So my ask was to come to you today to share some of the successes that we have had in our Pacific Islander community in building into this model curriculum, but also to share what we continue to do and are tasked to do as community members and as community leaders.

01:27:43.720 --> 01:28:08.720
As a Pacific Islander woman being elected as a board trustee in a school district six years ago, it is a rarity. That is ethnic studies. To know that the first Samoan-American board trustee and public official was elected right here in California and still serves in San Rafael as a product of public education.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:24.720
As someone who went to UC Berkeley, who was allowed to play NFL, a dream that many Pacific Islander young men aspire to, and come back to his community in Marin County, San Rafael, and say, I want to serve. How can I do that?

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:48.720
I'm going to do that and secure a seat in education. He has served there for over 20 years. But what his story has allowed for me and many other Pacific Islanders, it has allowed for five other Pacific Islanders to run for similar seats in our communities and be successful at serving in those roles.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:29:16.720
That is ethnic studies. Today we are having a conversation of an opportunity and the urgency that we must embrace to support this model curriculum. But I would be remiss if I didn't share the stories of the contributors from my community that allowed for many of these things to happen and will continue to be able to contribute to this ever evolving work.

01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:31.720
As a team member of the Institute of Human and Social Development, we have served our early learning communities for over 35 years in San Mateo County, and we are the only Head Start provider in this region.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:49.720
It's amazing to see our young pre-K learners receiving doses of Pacific Islander culture in our classrooms and having educators that look like them, along with many of other ethnic communities that are reflective of our student population.

01:29:49.720 --> 01:30:07.720
Additionally, I love that our school district, which is an elementary K-8 school district, embraced ethnic studies early on, and we are not waiting for our students to get to high school. We are introducing ethnic studies curriculum in the fall.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:23.720
In San Mateo County, we have Big Lift, which supports literacy and continues to work towards closing the academic and achievement gap by ensuring our students become successful and confident readers by the end of the third grade.

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:46.720
This platform provides opportunities to immerse our students in Pacific literature, and I'm particularly proud of our Pacific Islander investors, from educators to community leaders to parents and to allies who took on the task to build out this curriculum.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:58.720
From our oceanic community, we have been able to contribute and add nuggets of wisdom that are authentic to our outlook and our history.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:26.720
I must mention, our Pacific Islander pathways are in place because of organizations such as Tofa Inc., who serve the greater Sacramento area, and we have to make note to San Francisco Unified School District under the leadership of Commissioner Fauna Molina, who have built out the Matua Advisory Council and the Fa'asa'amoa Initiative, which is the first in the nation.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:38.720
They have provided a template for many of us to embrace and follow. Pacific Islander community built Camp Unity 10 years ago as shared by Mary Nicely.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:48.720
We are at the forefront of building this initiative and ensuring that allies that need to be recognized are continued partners in this work.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:32:08.720
Samoan Solutions, and more recently, PiFest, which is a new initiative of Pacific Islanders encouraging fun, engineering, science, and technology with a twist of Pacific Islander culture and history that has been birthed right here in the home of Genentech in South San Francisco, California.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.720
A pipeline has been built by our Pacific Oceanic community.

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:21.720
AA degree is now offered in Pacific Islander studies at the City College of San Francisco, the first in the nation.

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:34.720
That pipeline has been extended to the San Francisco State University, and our partners at UC Berkeley, as well as De Anza and College of San Mateo are just a few who have embraced this work.

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:39.720
We did not wait for this initiative, but we embrace it open arms.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:46.720
And I want to close out with my deep gratitude. I am a mother of a special needs child.

01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:50.720
And I ran for office to make sure that she was seen.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:33:02.720
And when she saw Camp Unity identify with who she was, and that we were able to share this in our local school districts, something, something went off in her.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:10.720
She had her aha moment. Camp Unity does not just serve Pacific Islander students, and I have to share this.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:18.720
65% of our participants are either mixed race or non-Pacific Islander.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:38.720
They have stayed with us since the inception of the program to this very day, because them and their families understand the meaning of embracing and respecting other cultures and other histories, because what it does, it expands their cultural antenna and their human dignity and love for others.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:47.720
So I want to close out with a wonderful quote that represents my people in my community from Professor Epeli Hau'ofa.

01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:56.720
We should not be defined by the smallness of our islands, but in the greatness of our oceans.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:04.720
We are the sea. We are the ocean. Oceania is us. We are ethnic studies.

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:15.720
So today I stand with all of you and urge and encourage you to support and vote yes on the current model ethnic studies curriculum.

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:24.720
Thank you for this time. Again, I appreciate the opportunity that has been extended to me to share my voice and the voice of my people.

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:46.720
Thank you so much for your wonderful words, for that beautiful quote, for your advocacy in the community and early education and supporting youth development and your leadership in the Pacific Islander community.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:57.720
And for all the time you took to work with us, bringing leaders together from the Pacific Islander community to to fine tune and improve the lesson plans to make sure they were reflective and culturally competent.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:06.720
And an important addition and a wonderful addition to this draft. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you, Dr. Camarillo, for your words and your work.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:15.720
Thank you, Dr. Alganadi for your leadership and your work and your help with the lesson plans. Thank you, Mr. Gregory. And again, Dr. Asante.

01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:23.720
To the members of the board, Madam President and members of the board, this concludes our presentation.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:31.720
I just have to say I hope it was for you as it was for me. It was a very emotional moment and a powerful moment.

01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:49.720
You heard not all the voices that have been a part of this, but you heard from many of the voices who have been helping us steer and continue to amplify the importance of ethnic studies and to continue to build that robust content for our students and educators to have access to.

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:58.720
I'm grateful to all of our speakers. As has been said, this is an evolving process and we look forward to the next step of the journey.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:08.720
And so with that, we conclude this part of the presentation. I'll turn it back to Director Coates who will take us further from here. And of course, one final thanks to Director Coates and to Dr. Gregson.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:19.720
I think these are two people who have lived this curriculum draft since its inception. They probably know every section of it can cite any reference of it. We're grateful for them and all the staff who've worked on it.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.720
Back to you, Director Coates and back to the state board. Thank you.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:50.720
Thank you so much. I'm overwhelmed, really, by the community that is here today. So right now we're going to transition to the next portion of the presentation, which is the presentation of the ethnic studies model curriculum and the recommendations by the instructional quality commission.

01:36:50.720 --> 01:37:13.720
If you just give me one moment.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:40.720
I'm joined by commissioners and will be additionally introducing them as well. So the recommendation for the day is on the screen. The California Department of Education recommends that the State Board of Education adopt the ethnic studies model curriculum with line edits described in attachment to as well as additional recommendations as outlined on slide 55 of this presentation.

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:58.720
The CDE also recommends that the State Board of Education authorize CDE staff pending approval of the State Board of Education executive director to prepare revisions requested by the State Board of Education and correct any typographical errors and non-substantive clarifying edits.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:27.720
The State Board of Education item before you contains attachment one, which is a summary table of public comments, attachment two, which summarizes the CDE recommended edits to the third field review draft, which was recommended by the instructional quality commission, and the item also contains a link to the draft recommended by the IQC as well as a link to the draft as it would appear if the State Board of Education chose to accept the CDE recommended edits to the third field review draft.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:57.720
So as you know, the instructional quality commission is one of five of the State Board of Education's advisory boards. This 18 member board is responsible for advising the State Board of Education on matters related to curriculum and instruction. Its members are appointed by various parties, including the State Board of Education, the governor, the speaker of the assembly, and the Senate Rules Committee.

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:15.720
It also includes a state senator and a state assembly member, and the State Board has also elected to include a student member. This advisory body represents a diverse cross-section of California geographically, ethnically, and a wide range of expertise specific to California curriculum and instruction matters.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:42.720
Curriculum and instruction projects after receiving the advice of specific subject matter committees, such as the Model Curriculum Advisory Committee, or for example, when we work on frameworks, the Curriculum Frameworks and Evaluation Criteria Committees, are provided to the Instructional Quality Commission for further development and to ensure consistency with the State Board of Education guidelines and to be responsive to the needs of California students.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:59.720
Presenting alongside with me are three commissioners from the Instructional Quality Commission. David Pantai, IQC member, member of the History Social Science Committee, is a high school English teacher of 18 years and works with diverse urban use in various capacities in Sacramento.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:08.720
He is a proud product of public education and believes the classroom should be a safe, comfortable, and welcoming environment for all students.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:27.720
Additionally, IQC co-chair Dr. Costa Hernandez is currently serving as the executive director of the California Reading and Literature Project, part of the network of nine California subject matter projects. Dr. Costa Hernandez is an experienced educator with 30 years of leadership experience at the classroom, school, district, and state level.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:43.720
Through her career, she has been an advocate for underserved students and their families. And the IQC chair Dr. Manuel Reston, who also served as chair of the History Social Science Committee last year during the project's development and is a proud believer in the promise of public education.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:41:01.720
Dr. Reston has spent all 16 plus years of his career teaching marginalized populations in underserved high schools. He currently teaches United States history, American government, economics, and a hip hop studies course, infusing ethnic studies teaching all the while.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:23.720
He is a proud member of the Ed Trust West's Educator Advisory Council and earned his doctorate in educational leadership at UCLA. He is also a recipient of prestigious awards such as the Milken Educator Award by the Milken Family Foundation and the Ruby McKnight Educator Award by the Pasadena NAACP.

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:51.720
Today we will present the model curriculum in its four phases of development. Those phases include phase one from statute to the development of the first draft, phase two from the first public comment period to the posting of the second field review draft, phase three from the second public comment period to the posting of the third field review draft, and phase four from the third field review public comment period to our final recommendations today.

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:59.720
At this time, I'll turn it over to Commissioner Pantai to lead us into the discussion of the first phase of development.

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.720
Thank you, Director Coates. I'm honored and excited to be here.

01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:22.720
AB 2016 was enacted on January 1, 2017 as Educational Code 51226.7, which requires the Instructional Quality Commission to develop and the SBE to adopt, modify, or revise a model curriculum in ethnic studies.

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:35.720
The statute also requires that the model curriculum be written as a guide to allow school districts to adapt their courses to reflect the pupil demographics in their communities.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:47.720
The statute also requires that the model curriculum is written as a guide to allow school districts to adapt their courses to reflect the pupil demographics in their communities.

01:42:48.720 --> 01:43:05.720
It requires that the model curriculum includes examples of courses offered by local agencies that have been approved as meeting the A through G requirements of UC and CSU, including the course outlines to the extent possible.

01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:17.720
It was also the legislature's intent that LEAs submit courses, course outlines to the UC, CSU, A through G system so that the database could continue to be built.

01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:32.720
The original statute required action by March 2020, but we actually received a one-year extension of that time that we will discuss a bit later.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:40.720
But the statute required a minimum of 45 days of public comment period before the State Board approval.

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:46.720
As you know, the IQC has held three public comment periods and have accepted public comment throughout.

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:52.720
A vast number of people and organizations have contributed to shaping and forming this project.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.720
The project has received over 100,000 public comments in our frameworks.

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:01.720
The most we've received has been 20,000.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:11.720
This is a reflective of the level of engagement by a broad body of stakeholders and the desire and need to continue to address ethnic studies in California.

01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:18.720
I'll hand it over to Commissioner Rustin, who will walk us through some additional key points and framing.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:21.720
Thank you, Commissioner Pantai, and good morning, everybody.

01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:24.720
It's a true honor to be here in your presence.

01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.720
I've been an admirer of your work in education as individuals and as a collective for quite some time.

01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.720
So I'm really happy and really honored to be here with you this morning.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:42.720
Now, when the legislature enacted AB 2016, they found and declared in part that there are 92 languages other than English spoken throughout the state of California.

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.720
There's a growing body of research that shows the importance of culturally meaningful and relevant curriculum.

01:44:48.720 --> 01:44:54.720
They cited the National Education Association's publication, The Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies,

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.720
which stated that the inclusion of ethnic studies has positive impacts for students.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:12.720
They also declared that ethnic studies benefits students in observable ways, boosting academic engagement, increasing performance on standardized tests, improving graduation rates and developing a sense of self-efficacy and personal empowerment.

01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:20.720
They acknowledge that the state's educational standards should be guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness and universally high expectations,

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:25.720
and that the state is committed to its efforts to provide all students with excellent educational opportunities,

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:37.720
including its obligation to ensure its youth are college prepared and ready to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures.

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:40.720
And as a teacher who has incorporated ethnic studies myself,

01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:47.720
I've seen students engaged to a whole new level academically when using ethnic studies as our guide.

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:59.720
For example, students who I've had who have really struggled with in-class presentations when we did a youth participatory action research project and presented at a youth summit at a local university.

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:11.720
The same students that really struggled with a basic in-class presentation really came alive when presenting their own research when treated as intellectuals, which is what ethnic studies, of course, does with our students or for our students.

01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:22.720
Now we can see here that there are many districts that are teaching ethnic studies already, and some have it as a graduation requirement.

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:30.720
Based on the figures presented on this slide, we can see that statewide student enrollment in ethnic studies courses has steadily increased over the last four years.

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:37.720
This is a good indication that there is growing interest as well as a growing body of ethnic studies courses across the states.

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:47.720
According to DataQuest, when we compare enrollment from 2015 to 2018, we see enrollment in ethnic studies courses increased by around 60 percent.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:57.720
There was a 12 percent increase in enrollment between the 2017-18 school year and the 2018-19 school year alone.

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:07.720
Now, before we begin to talk more in depth about the model curriculum, it's important to give a clear look at the various other tools that California utilizes to discuss history.

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:10.720
Now, in California, we have a landscape for curriculum and instruction.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.720
There are three main components, the standards, the frameworks, and instructional materials.

01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:28.720
The standards are essentially the what for students and teachers, and they provide the language of student expectations for each grade or proficiency level, as well as where we want students to be at the end of the school year.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:31.720
End of their school career, I'm sorry.

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:34.720
Standards come about as the result of legislation.

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:42.720
A content-specific advisory committee comes together to develop standards, and they then turn their work over to the IQC for further development.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:48.720
Once standards are approved by the State Board, a content-specific group of educators draft the frameworks.

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:50.720
Frameworks are essentially the how.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:54.720
They serve as guidance documents to help educators implement the standards.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:48:01.720
A content-specific advisory committee for frameworks recommends its draft to the IQC, and their work concludes.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:06.720
The IQC then further develops the draft, including being responsive to public comments.

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:15.720
Now, once the State Board of Education approves a framework, publishers participate in the K-8 instructional materials adoptions.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:20.720
Instructional materials are a tool to help teachers provide standards-aligned instruction.

01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:30.720
Now, model curricula are supplemental to this established core area of curriculum and instruction, including the history social science framework.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:39.720
Now, speaking of that framework, in California, instruction in history social science is guided by the content standards and the 2016 history social science framework.

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:44.720
The 2016 framework emphasizes four major shifts in instruction.

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.720
One is discipline-specific inquiry.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:58.720
The framework encourages teachers to organize their instruction around questions of significance for students to explore, and after analyzing relevant evidence, developing their own interpretations.

01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:02.720
The frameworks also include expanded content.

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:16.720
Although California history social science standards haven't changed, the framework adds content on a variety of different topics, including, for example, to incorporate the latest historiography, like a more connected and less regional approach to world history.

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:30.720
The framework also emphasizes student literacy, the disciplinary demands of history, geography, economics, and government, aligned with the literacy expectations outlined in the Common Core and California's English language development standards.

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:36.720
And the 2016 framework offers strategies to integrate content and literacy instruction.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:47.720
The framework as well includes citizenship, although previous iterations of the frameworks also included significant attention to developing student understanding of our democratic system of governance.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:50:02.720
The 2016 version extends that work by offering concrete examples of how schools may not only teach our students how our government works, but it also goes one step further to support student participation in civic discourse and to promote public service.

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:11.720
With this framework, students in my US history class, for example, learn about major events of the 20th century, we recently completed completed our study of the 1920s.

01:50:11.720 --> 01:50:18.720
And the framework includes the question, why were the 1920s filled with political, social and economic extremes.

01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:32.720
And we explored this through a variety of investigations using documents ranging from newspaper clippings from the 20s to contemporary research about Chicana flappers in the 20s to poems and music written in the 20s.

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:47.720
So that sort of encapsulates encapsulates how we use inquiry and literacy to explore the past this model curriculum, which we're talking about today is anchored to the history social science framework and serves as a baseline to model the state board guidelines,

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:59.720
which includes the emphasis on student based inquiry, consistent with the instructional shifts in the history social science frameworks and promote the values of civic engagement and civic responsibility.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:12.720
If used to its fullest capacity, the model curriculum will be but a fraction of the ensuing rich dialogue and pro programmatic experiences provided by districts in partnership with their local communities to continue.

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:22.720
And in some places begin the journey of affirming, seeing and giving voice to the diversity of California.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:32.720
So to be clear, a model curriculum is a guidance document that provides support to teachers and administrators in developing courses and or instructional content in a specific topic area.

01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:51.720
It does not impose a mandate on schools and it is not a complete curriculum or or or set of instructional materials is intended to be a resource, and it is to be used in tandem with the history social science frameworks and ELA frameworks and other tools available to the local educational agency.

01:51:51.720 --> 01:52:05.720
So the model curriculum cites the 2016 State Board of Education adopted history social science frameworks for public schools kindergarten through grade 12, which defines ethnic studies as follows.

01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:17.720
Ethnic studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses many subject areas, including history, literature, economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science.

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:24.720
It emerged to both address content considered missing from traditional curriculum and to encourage critical engagement.

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:33.720
It goes on to say that as a field ethnic studies seeks to empower all students to engage socially and politically and to think critically about the world around them.

01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:45.720
It is important for ethnic studies courses to develop to document the experiences of people of color in order for students to construct counter narratives and develop a more complex understanding of the human experience.

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:53.720
Through these studies, students should develop respect for cultural diversity and see the advantages of inclusion.

01:52:53.720 --> 01:53:04.720
Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field ethnic studies courses may take several forms, however central to any ethnic studies course is a historic struggle of communities of color.

01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:21.720
Taking into account the intersectionality of identity, gender, class, sexuality, among others to challenge racism, discrimination and oppression and interrogate the systems that continue to perpetuate in equity and again that's from the 2016 framework.

01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:35.720
So this slide provides a high level overview of the process for developing the model curriculum, and we will continue to address each of these steps as we walk through the four phases of the project.

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:55.720
And here we see that phase one, some key milestones in phase one of the development of the model curriculum, which include the public input webinar, the appointment of the model curriculum advisory committee members, and approval of the State Board of Education guidelines, all the way through to the development and posting of the first draft of public comment.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:16.720
In January 9, 2018, the CDE held a public input webinar. This was open to participation by anyone and posted on the CDE website. 74 scholars, teachers and interested parties attended, including various ethnic studies experts throughout the field.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:27.720
And the purpose of the webinar was to receive input from ethnic studies educators statewide on the development of an ethnic studies model curriculum. Four questions were asked of the participants.

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:40.720
One, what kind of course outline should be included in the model curriculum? Two, what are the essential components of effective ethnic studies pedagogy? Three, what are some of the current challenges educators are encountering while teaching ethnic studies?

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:51.720
And four, how can the model curriculum best support districts, administrators, and teachers that offer or are considering offering ethnic studies courses at their schools?

01:54:51.720 --> 01:55:02.720
And participants attested to the efficacy and success of concept or thematic approaches to ethnic studies. They expressed that course outline should be grounded in challenging systems of oppression.

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:17.720
They expressed that validating and creating room for lived experiences was essential to teaching ethnic studies. They tied this discussion to socio-emotional development and pedagogy, a need for ethnic studies to be seen as engaging multiple disciplines.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:27.720
And then from there, the guidelines were developed based on feedback received not only during the public webinar, but also the requirements and the authorizing statute and the public comment.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:45.720
And they were considered by the instructional quality commission at its May 2018 meeting. The commission met thoughtfully regarding those guidelines and recommended them to the State Board of Education, who approved them at their meeting, their meeting on July 2018.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:58.720
The guidelines set the expectations for the development of the model curriculum, including for the model curriculum advisory's work and the board in creating the first draft of the model.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:05.720
At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Commissioner Costa-Hernandez to discuss those State Board of Education guidelines.

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:08.720
Good morning, everyone.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:13.720
It is a pleasure and an honor to be here today.

01:56:13.720 --> 01:56:29.720
Representing my colleagues at IQC, the State Board of Education guidelines developed based on the input from focus groups and further recommendations by the IQC were approved by the State Board at your July 2018 meeting.

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:43.720
They contain five parts, statutory guidelines, general principles, course outlines, audience and administrative and teacher support. I will provide a few highlights on each section.

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:57.720
You already, you're already familiar with the statutory guidelines, which require that the curriculum is a guide and the inclusion of UCA3D course outlines. So let's move on to the general principles.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:05.720
These general principles laid the foundation for deliberations and discussions in the IQC resulting in what you see today.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:15.720
The guiding principles align with the content and instructional shifts in the 2016 history social studies framework, as we discussed earlier.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:26.720
This is one reason why it was important for the IQC to ensure that there are concrete history social science connections throughout the model.

01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:40.720
The body also wanted to ensure that the curriculum aligned with public core state standards for English language arts and literacy in history social studies to provide students with skills that are applicable across the curriculum.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:51.720
Each lesson contains standards alignment with history social science as well as common core state standards in English language arts literacy.

01:57:51.720 --> 01:58:06.720
The guidelines called for self and collective empowerment and importantly the guidelines asked that the ES&C is written utilizing language that is inclusive and supportive of multiple users.

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:23.720
The SBE guidelines, your guidelines, wanted to ensure that students are provided with a deeper understanding of each other and themselves and how different groups have historically worked together to further equality and racial justice for all.

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:38.720
The inclusion of information on the ethnic studies movement, another guiding principle, works in tandem with the principle of empowerment by providing students with the foundation intent with the founding intent of ethnic studies.

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:58.720
Additionally, the ES&C was designed to promote critical thinking and rigorous analysis of history, systems of oppression, and the status quo and consider what the world will look like if equality, justice, and equity triumph over society's current ills.

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:15.720
The guidelines recognize the importance of a thematic approach to allow a space for educators to build in examples and case studies from diverse backgrounds for use in standalone or integrated courses.

01:59:15.720 --> 01:59:20.720
This is why the IQC recommended building out the thematic portion of the model.

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:36.720
This was accomplished through expanding and refining the themes in the first draft as well as a sample questions that teachers can use to link across ethnic groups and is reflected in the draft before you today.

01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:45.720
Beyond that, the outlines are there to engage a range of disciplines beyond traditional history and social sciences.

01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:51.720
This is why some of the course outlines are, for example, in AP English.

01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:57.720
The state board guidelines consider the audience for the document.

01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:08.720
They express the desire for sensitivity to the needs of students at various grade levels, specifically targeting grades 9 through 12 in the outline in the legislation.

02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:32.720
The guidelines stated that the pedagogy should be responsive, validate students' lived experience, and address social emotional development, which also created an inclusive space for all students, regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, or citizenship, helping students to learn from different perspectives.

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:41.720
The guidelines also address administrator and teacher support, including educators who do not have a background in ethnic studies.

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:54.720
The IQC had considerably conversation regarding the balance of the academic language of the discipline and the need to make the document easy for teachers who may not have a background in ethnic studies.

02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:02.720
The balance is reflected in the document that is presented to you today.

02:01:02.720 --> 02:01:20.720
This model also provide examples of instructional methods and pedagogical approaches and assist in and encourage collaborative teaching among colleagues across disciplines as a way of highlighting the interdisciplinarity of ethnic studies.

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:39.720
This is one of the reasons why the IQC chose to incorporate multiple frameworks and theories in order to offer various instructional and pedagogical approaches that local educational agencies will consider as they develop their own local ethnic studies courses.

02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:48.720
Further, the guidelines ask for resources to lesson plans and other resources.

02:01:48.720 --> 02:02:03.720
And as mentioned previously, the State Board of Education guidelines set the expectation for the work of the model curriculum, including the work of the model curriculum advisory committee members that were appointed to review drafts of the model curriculum and provide

02:02:03.720 --> 02:02:14.720
feedback. In August through October 2018, the CDE publicly requested applicants for the advisory committee to provide a review of the initial drafts of the model curriculum.

02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:25.720
In November 2018, the instructional quality commission recommended the committee members and in January 2019, the State Board of Education appointed the 20 committee members.

02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:33.720
The model curriculum advisory committee met over six days in February, March and April 2019 to develop the first draft of the model.

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:43.720
Similar to other projects, their work culminated at the final committee meeting in April 2019 when they recommended to move the draft to the instructional quality commission.

02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:52.720
We are appreciative of the work of the advisory committee and the culmination of their work brings phase one to an end.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:56.720
That leads us to phase two.

02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:06.720
Here are the key dates for phase two of the model curriculums development. In this segment, we will cover the posting and the first public comment review period.

02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:20.720
IQC action on the draft and the extension of time at our May 2019 meeting, the IQC reviewed the first draft and approved it for the posting for the 60 day public review period.

02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:36.720
The review period, which took place June 15th through August 15th, resulted in over 20,000 public comments during the field review and an additional 12,000 comments between the end of the field review and before the posting of the IQC's next meeting.

02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:43.720
Immediately surpassing the amount of public comment received for any other curriculum project.

02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:52.720
In September 2019 the IQC postponed its expected action in order to provide adequate time to fully address the public comment.

02:03:52.720 --> 02:04:05.720
We secured a one year extension to the project's timeline by the passage of assembly bill 114 signed by the governor.

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:23.720
And then the CDE took advantage of that time to review the public comment to convene expert panels on ethnic studies, conduct listening sessions, and worked with the comprehensive center to conduct focus groups with teachers, students, and excuse me, teachers and administrators, as well as students.

02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:33.720
And to learn more about the voice of teachers and practitioners, the region 15 comprehensive center assisted us by holding listening sessions about ethnic studies implementation.

02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:45.720
And here to present on the teacher focus groups are Deb Sigmund and Rose Owens West, and I will now turn it over to them to discuss more information on the focus groups.

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:56.720
One moment.

02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:06.720
Thank you, Director Coates and President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Strauss, Superintendent Thurman.

02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:14.720
We so appreciate being part of this really extraordinary effort and decision today.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:39.720
So I am Deb Sigmund. I serve as the co-director of the region 15 comprehensive center, and I am joined today by my colleague, Dr. Rose Owens West, who serves as our director of equity projects for West Ed.

02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:50.720
Let me see if I can share my screen.

02:05:50.720 --> 02:06:05.720
Having a little trouble here.

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:13.720
Dr. Owens West, might you be able to share the screen? I'm having some difficulty.

02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:23.720
Okay, thank you. I'll open the PowerPoint. Just one moment, please.

02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:29.720
Okay, I think I've got it, Rose.

02:06:29.720 --> 02:06:32.720
I apologize.

02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:46.720
So as Director Coates mentioned, we were asked to help the California Department of Education and the State Board of Education really reach out to practicing educators.

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:51.720
Just a little bit of background about what the region 15 comprehensive center is.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:57.720
We are one of 19 federally funded regional comprehensive centers.

02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:09.720
Our charge is to build capacity building and provide technical assistance to our state educational agency partners in an effort to improve education for all students.

02:07:09.720 --> 02:07:22.720
Here at West Ed, we operate the region 15 comprehensive center, and in addition to California, that region includes Arizona, Nevada, and Utah.

02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:38.720
Back in the, I believe it was the summer of 2019, the department and the State Board of Education reached out to us and really wanted to gain some feedback from practicing K-12 educators across the state.

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:54.720
As you've heard in the last presentation, critically important for if in fact the model curriculum would be used and be successful, it was important to hear from those educators who would actually be using the model curriculum.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:08:20.720
And so our charge was to convene some focus groups to get some feedback, some really deep, engaging feedback from both administrators and teachers who may have experience with teaching ethnic studies, as well as those folks who may not have, but would be certainly that would be part of their path.

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:27.720
If in fact the ESMC was put into practice.

02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:46.720
So as I said, our charge was to gather key ideas and feedback from the practicing educators, and it was really focused on what is needed and how can we inform the state policymakers to successfully implement K-12 ethnic studies.

02:08:46.720 --> 02:09:15.720
So in that effort, we designed our focus groups, as I said, to be very engaging and really not an hour conversation, but some lengthy conversation. And so actually each of our in-person groups, this was pre-pandemic, I think we conducted our last in-person group in January of 20, so shortly before we closed our schools and such.

02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:29.720
So we included practicing educators, both teachers and administrators, as I said, some implementing, some not, and administrators that might be responsible for implementing.

02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:50.720
We really encouraged interaction between the participants to, as I said, provide this deeper understanding of the local context and experiences. To get that deep engagement, we limited each of our groups to six participants and had facilitators for each of those discussion groups.

02:09:50.720 --> 02:10:01.720
Dr. Owens-West was one of our lead facilitators in this endeavor. And as I said, these went up to five hours to provide ample time.

02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:15.720
In addition to our in-person groups, we also worked with the California Teachers Association and the department to hold a virtual focus group in the spring.

02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:27.720
And the design, the questions, the protocols were built from the in-person, but obviously we had to modify slightly due to the nature of the virtual structure.

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:41.720
And again, all the participants were participating teachers, either currently implemented or would be responsible for implementing or interested in implementing an ethnic studies course.

02:10:41.720 --> 02:11:00.720
So this gives you a sense of how widespread and how representative the engagement was. As I said, we had four in-person sessions. We held those in Sacramento, Shasta County, Fresno County, and Los Angeles County.

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:12.720
As I said, we had one virtual session. Across all of these 19 counties were represented, 35 school districts were represented.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:24.720
And here's how it broke down. So we had across all five, we had 48 teachers, we had 17 administrators. You can see the counties that were represented.

02:11:24.720 --> 02:11:44.720
It's important for us to gather information from across the state to really get a sense from our educators about the local context and the challenges they might face and really what they wanted to share with the policymakers about how to make this successful.

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:58.720
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Owens-West. As I said, Dr. Owens-West was one of our lead facilitators for our focus groups. Dr. Owens-West.

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:08.720
Thank you. The discussion in the focus group focused on three key areas with related to successful implementation.

02:12:08.720 --> 02:12:22.720
Contextual learning, content knowledge, functional strategies that are needed for effective ethnic studies implementation. Next slide, please.

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:49.720
We provided the definition from the California History Social Science Framework in order for the focus group participants to have a common language to use during their discussions. Please take a moment to read the framework definition.

02:12:49.720 --> 02:13:05.720
Okay, in the focus groups, we heard broad agreement from participants about what is needed for effective implementation. We heard about what to teach in ethnic studies, including

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:26.720
academic relevance, as well as high quality curricula, how to teach ethnic studies, including academic rigor and effective strategies, and about professional learning, learning for ethnic studies teachers. And next we'll describe a little bit more detail about what we heard in these areas.

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:51.720
Next slide, please. So in the area of content, participants emphasize that K-12 content should be challenging for students. We heard that content should include the history of ethnic studies addressing its origins as a student-led movement in California and what ethnic studies is and is not.

02:13:51.720 --> 02:14:08.720
The content should have academic relevance, helping K-12 students to learn about their communities and histories, and it should address student identity, helping students to learn about themselves and student empowerment, encouraging their voice.

02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:21.720
We also heard that an essential focus of ethnic studies content is critical theory and critical framing, which involves critiquing social, political, and economic issues.

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:41.720
They noted that K-12 ethnic studies differs from post-secondary ethnic studies in that it adheres to the California history social science framework, is interdisciplinary across the social sciences, and must be age and developmentally appropriate.

02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:59.720
These K-12 educators emphasize that historical perspectives of marginalized groups are part of ethnic studies content. Further, we heard that ethnic studies content should promote equality, inclusion, equality, and justice.

02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:15.720
Participants emphasize local context for K-12 ethnic studies, stating that local communities provide both a focus for ethnic studies and resources for ethnic studies content. Next slide, please.

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:40.720
Regarding instruction in K-12 ethnic studies, participants indicated that content and instruction are closely aligned. The focus group participants indicated that strategies need to be incorporated that would promote academic rigor such as youth participatory action research projects that involve analysis, evaluation, and creativity.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:16:02.720
They also noted the importance of students engaging in discussions in Socratic seminars about challenging content. These teachers and administrators emphasize that instruction needed to be age and developmentally appropriate in order to meet the needs of K-12 students and can be taught at all grade levels.

02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:19.720
We heard for effective ethnic studies at K-12 levels, instruction should reinforce content, allowing students to engage in critical analysis around the topics of critical race theory, critical literacy, and critical media.

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:45.720
Interdisciplinary strategies, employing themes, drawing from multiple subjects was also important. And finally, addressing the social-emotional learning needs by providing appropriate instructional supports for students grounded in relationship building and building a sense of community among students in the classroom is paramount. Next slide, please.

02:16:45.720 --> 02:17:06.720
The focus group participants talked about the need for professional learning opportunities to help K-12 educators effectively deliver ethnic studies content and instruction. They also pointed out the need for time for teachers to collaborate, to develop curriculum, and to share resources.

02:17:06.720 --> 02:17:32.720
We heard that professional learning for K-12 ethnic studies educators should build their capacities to employ instructional strategies to specifically teach relevant ethnic studies content, such as engaging students in participatory action research, helping students stand their own biases, helping students discover their own voice.

02:17:32.720 --> 02:17:47.720
In addition, building educators' capacities to facilitate student discourse, allowing students to engage in difficult conversations and help students navigate those conversations.

02:17:47.720 --> 02:18:03.720
The focus group participants also discussed that professional learning should address how to effectively engage communities by drawing on them for resources and building local support for K-12 ethnic studies.

02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:05.720
Next slide.

02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:30.720
We asked the focus group participants what help needed and what could the state do to promote effective implementation of ethnic studies across K-12 grades. They told us that the state could help by lending clarity to what K-12 ethnic studies is, to provide guidance to districts and schools for implementation.

02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:42.720
Participants addressed the need for resources for teachers in different parts of the state and the role of the state in providing those resources for teachers.

02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:44.720
Next slide, please.

02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:55.720
Again, in summary, again, there was broad agreement among the participants across all focus groups.

02:18:55.720 --> 02:19:10.720
Generally, we heard that the things that are needed for effective implementation of K-12 ethnic studies are the same as those needed for effective implementation of any K-12 instructional program.

02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:25.720
Specifically, we heard that K-12 ethnic studies is important because of the diversity of the general population in California and the diversity of the school population in particular.

02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:33.720
And California history and K-12 curriculum should be inclusive, reflecting the state's diversity.

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:43.720
In K-12 ethnic studies, students are challenged and students relate to the ethnic studies content and can see themselves.

02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:51.720
Teachers need professional learning to know content and for effective instruction.

02:19:51.720 --> 02:20:01.720
And last, the state guides the K-12 curriculum and K-12 ethnic studies must be age and developmentally appropriate.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:12.720
Thank you.

02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:14.720
Thank you, Dr. Cotes.

02:20:42.720 --> 02:20:54.720
Dr. Cotes, I believe you're on mute.

02:20:54.720 --> 02:20:59.720
Well, there had to be one today, right?

02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:02.720
So thank you again to the comprehensive center.

02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.720
We appreciate your partnership.

02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:23.720
And I wanted to note that the focus group work and the comments and the feedback were all carefully reviewed and were reflected in the recommendations that went forth in the second draft that the instructional quality commission put forth for field review,

02:21:23.720 --> 02:21:37.720
including things such as including that ethnic studies is presented in a way that is rigorous and relevant, stressing the importance of inclusivity while acknowledging and challenging systems of power.

02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:44.720
They're highlighting the need to engage students in critical thinking while also empowering students to be civically engaged,

02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:53.720
citing the importance of professional learning and administrative support in developing successful programs and ethnic studies.

02:21:53.720 --> 02:21:59.720
And that in particular is one reason why the district implementation guidance chapter was developed.

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:09.720
The focus group participants also pointed out that ethnic studies in high school courses is not the same as it may be presented in higher education.

02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:19.720
And so we again appreciate the focus group report as it was instrumental in the shaping of subsequent drafts.

02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:32.720
I would also like to point out that during the extension of time, the superintendent began his web series to continue to engage ethnic studies experts, teachers, local educational agencies, and to lift student voice.

02:22:33.720 --> 02:22:50.720
He also engaged with numerous communities regarding ethnic studies and all of the information received during the extension of time, including the public comment, the public comment informed the recommendations that the IQC considered during its August 2020 meeting.

02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:55.720
And the superintendent has continued his commitment to ethnic studies.

02:22:55.720 --> 02:23:01.720
And you can see the additional webinars that have been held on this slide. And there are more to come.

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:13.720
At its August meeting, the IQC reviewed and approved recommendations to the draft.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:19.720
The IQC committed to anchoring ourselves in the legislation and the SBE principles.

02:23:19.720 --> 02:23:24.720
A few highlights of the changes that were approved for the second draft are as follows.

02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:33.720
One reflects the values and principles of the ethnic studies movement that started in California in the 1960s and continues today.

02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:42.720
Two reaffirms that ethnic studies is a discipline that allows students to explore the experiences of people of color in the United States.

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:56.720
Three builds out guidance for thematic instruction to help all students grapple with themes of identity, history, and movement systems of power and social movements and equity.

02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:06.720
Adds concrete connections to the HSS framework and last allows flexibility for schools to tailor a course to meet local needs.

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:12.720
These revisions reflect the original purpose of the legislation and the guidelines adopted by the state board.

02:24:12.720 --> 02:24:25.720
The goal of the model curriculum is to provide a guidance document for teachers and administrators, not to provide an exhaustive curriculum or instructional materials that cover every potential topic.

02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:36.720
The instructional quality commission voted to send the second field review draft for another public review period that took place during the month of September.

02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:39.720
This then leads us to phase three.

02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:50.720
In this phase of three, phase three, we have the second field review for public comment period and the November 2020 meeting, a short but mighty time span.

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:54.720
The second field review received over 13,000 comments.

02:24:54.720 --> 02:25:03.720
The IQC reviewed the public comments to the second field review draft at its November 17th through the 18th meeting.

02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:19.720
During that meeting, we thoughtfully deliberated on the public comment, which resulted in over 200 changes to the model curriculum and additional lesson plans, all of which were reviewed for alignment with the statute and state Board of Education guidelines.

02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:38.720
Ethnic Studies is a course that focuses on the experiences, struggles, scholarship and contributions of people of color whose historically marginalized populations are inextricably tied to our state and nation's history, but whose stories have largely gone untold in public school classrooms.

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:55.720
The IQC's recommendation to the draft Ethnic Studies model curriculum expanded resources that reflect California's diversity, promote critical thinking, and empower educators to lead courageous conversations that are relevant for students of all backgrounds.

02:25:55.720 --> 02:26:03.720
These changes were presented in the third field review draft, which the IQC recommended to the State Board of Education.

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:09.720
That meeting was designed to ensure consensus on the recommended changes.

02:26:09.720 --> 02:26:21.720
At the end of that meeting, with 16 yes and one abstain, the IQC voted to recommend the draft to the State Board of Education following the final 45 day public comment period.

02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:25.720
And this leads us to phase four.

02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:37.720
So after the November IQC meeting, the third field review draft was posted for a 45 day public comment period from December 7, 2020 to January 21, 2021.

02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:46.720
And then following the review period, the CDE compiled the feedback and subsequently posted its recommendations to that draft on March 5, 2021.

02:26:46.720 --> 02:26:50.720
And that brings us to today's State Board of Education meeting.

02:26:50.720 --> 02:27:03.720
And then last but certainly not least, one key date is March 31, 2021, the deadline for action on the model curriculum.

02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:14.720
So what's inside? So today, so this final portion of the presentation is to discuss the components of the model curriculum.

02:27:14.720 --> 02:27:30.720
And while I'm not discussing CDE recommendations in detail at this particular juncture on this slide, I did want to call attention to this particular recommendation to avoid any confusion regarding the chapter names.

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:49.720
So the contents of the chapters are here on this slide and CDE has suggested an ordering and name change to the chapters to ensure that we are using language that is inclusive, which is the intended purpose of the ethnic studies model curriculum.

02:27:49.720 --> 02:27:57.720
So at this time, I will turn it over to Commissioner Reston to begin the presentation of the chapters.

02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:06.720
Thank you. So the model curriculum begins with a preface that expresses the intent of the document referencing the original legislation of the state board's guidelines.

02:28:06.720 --> 02:28:29.720
It also sets forth the focus of the model curriculum, which is a focus on the four foundational disciplines of Asian-American, Native American, Chicano, Latinx, and African-American studies, while per the legislation affording local educational agencies the flexibility to adapt the curriculum to address the demographics and diversity of their classrooms.

02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:46.720
The preface is clear that this model curriculum should not be seen as exhaustive, but rather a guidance document to pair with the existing state board of education adopted content standards and curriculum frameworks, including the history social science content standards and the history social science framework.

02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:59.720
And the California Common Core State Standards in English Language Arts and Literacy and History Social Science and Science and Technical Subjects. Sorry, I butchered that title. It's a handful.

02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:07.720
And also the English Language Arts, English Language Development Framework, and as well as the California English Language Development Standards.

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:31.720
So the history social science framework in particular provides support for the implementation of ethnic studies, including a brief outline of a ninth grade elective course in the field and the document overall emphasizes key principles of ethnic studies, teaching and learning, such as diversity, inclusion, challenging systems of inequality and support for student civic engagement.

02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:48.720
Now chapter one begins with a discussion of why we teach ethnic studies. Ethnic studies, of course, affirms the identities and contributions of historically marginalized groups in our society and help students see themselves and each other as part of the narrative of the United States.

02:29:48.720 --> 02:30:04.720
In this way, the focus on the four foundational disciplines benefits the whole further ethnic studies is not meant to gloss over differences. It is designed to bring students and communities together by one addressing racialized experiences and ethnic differences as real and unique.

02:30:04.720 --> 02:30:15.720
And secondly, building greater understanding and communication across ethnic differences and finally revealing underlying commonalities that can bind individuals and groups together.

02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:31.720
Chapter one defines ethnic studies for K-12 using the definition of the 2016 history social science framework and provides the history of ethnic studies as described by members of the original movement and speaks to the benefits of ethnic studies, which we discussed earlier in this presentation.

02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:51.720
Chapter one further emphasizes the danger of a single story and emphasizes that each ethnic community has its own unique history struggles and contributions and that these are to be taught, understood and celebrated as ethnic studies focuses on United States culture and history from the perspective of marginalized groups.

02:30:51.720 --> 02:31:02.720
Teachers are guided to present topics from multiple viewpoints and represent diverse stories and opinions within groups, of course, staying within the realm of inclusion and humanizing discourse.

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:13.720
And the chapter also states that resources should represent a range of perspectives and that lessons are structured so that students examine materials and come to their own conclusions.

02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:25.720
The guiding values and principles, including in this chapter, were, of course, a matter of careful discussion, given that this is a resource and not a comprehensive day by day package of curriculum.

02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:41.720
The IQC ultimately recommended to keep the guiding values and principles and also reference them in the sample lessons so as to ensure that the ongoing development of ethnic studies courses, teaching and learning remain true to the foundational values of ethnic studies.

02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:53.720
And to assist with K-12 implementation of ethnic studies, eight outcomes were added that emphasize various aspects of inclusion, civic engagement and understanding of self and of others.

02:31:54.720 --> 02:32:04.720
Chapter two provides district implementation guidance. Much of this chapter was developed based on the listening and learning from the focus groups.

02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:13.720
As we know, ethnic studies courses will look different across our state because they are largely based on local development and community engagement.

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:27.720
Chapter two helps district think through implementation, including defining what ethnic studies means in their own districts based on their local context and considering plans for supporting instruction and course development.

02:32:27.720 --> 02:32:45.720
From the IQC perspective, this guidance for school and district leadership offer in chapter two is about highlighting the importance of alignment of purpose and strategy at all levels and creating the context for a successful implementation and possible expansion of ethnic studies.

02:32:46.720 --> 02:33:00.720
Chapter three includes content related to development and ethnic studies pedagogy, the purpose, identity, content and skills, methods and in-class community building.

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:18.720
It includes approaches to ethnic studies that include standalone courses in the four foundational disciplines, integrating ethnic studies into existing course, grade level considerations and thematic approaches to ethnic studies.

02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:28.720
It also includes an introduction to ethnic studies course outline, four themes, including four themes which have been affirmed in our discussion.

02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:39.720
They can also be used in standalone courses. Those are identity, history and movement, systems of power and social movements and equity.

02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:59.720
Finally, it includes lesson plans and unit plan templates. The content and resources in chapter three are designed to support all educators, but we believed at the IQC that it will be particularly helpful for those of us who do not have a background in ethnic studies.

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:19.720
Now, the newly named chapter four, which was the appendix, I'm sorry, was appendix A in the third field review draft, it contains sample lesson plans and we voted to expand this section of the document to include additional lesson plans that are more reflective of California's diversity.

02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:27.720
And it's important to note that these are just samples. There are windows view into what a lesson can look like in ethnic studies, but not what they must look like.

02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:41.720
Local educational agencies can build upon these lesson plans. The lesson plans do not represent a scope and sequence for any topic area and it's impossible for this model to include every possible iteration or option available.

02:34:41.720 --> 02:34:55.720
So these sample lessons can spark ideas for how an educator may wish to approach specific topic as their programs are developed and developed locally, of course, and in concert with the planning team and the local community.

02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:10.720
I myself being a history teacher, one lesson that I'm particularly drawn to is the one on Afrofuturism, which is an art form and practice that calls on artists to reimagine Black life beyond the status quo and to explore the infinite possibilities of the world of tomorrow.

02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:23.720
And I think this is this lesson in particular is a reminder that ethnic studies help students conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for post racist society, being that I teach at the alma mater of Octavia Butler.

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:37.720
This lesson is particularly close to home for me and the lesson asks for students to engage in Afrofuturism and reimagine their community's future, which actually pairs well with the youth participatory action research lesson plan.

02:35:37.720 --> 02:35:49.720
And that's something I've been doing for a few years now and in doing youth participatory action research that engages students in examining their own communities present through systematic investigation.

02:35:49.720 --> 02:36:01.720
And this provides young people with opportunities to study social problems affecting their lives and then determine civic actions to address these problems and usher in a brighter and more just future for everybody.

02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:24.720
Chapter five. So for this chapter as recommended by the IQC, it includes the six main sections that you see on this slide sample safe safe spaces and community building activities affirmations chance and energizers critical conversations

02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:33.720
resources resources for connecting ethnic studies to local demographics, California museums and historical sites and other model curricula.

02:36:33.720 --> 02:36:50.720
The sample lessons and resources and chapter five are helpful, especially to new teachers who may not have previous teaching in ethnic studies, and the lessons and units are all created to support teachers.

02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:58.720
Chapter six the course outlines are selections of what currently exists from the UC CSU A through G database.

02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:12.720
And we're developed by local educational agencies. This chapter includes a variety of UC A through G approved course outlines in general ethnic studies as well as the four foundational disciplines.

02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:27.720
This section encourages LEAs to continue to submit course outlines for the UC CSU A through G approval, so that those can also continue to expand and reflect California's diversity.

02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:41.720
Commissioners not just for your time today, but for your thoughtfulness throughout this project's development. So CDE followed the following guideposts when making revisions to the draft.

02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:52.720
You see them here on the slide. We accepted edits that corrected errors or inaccuracies, including grammar, clarified language without substantially changing the meaning.

02:37:52.720 --> 02:38:03.720
And we rejected edits that substantially reversed or changed this decision that was discussed and voted on by the instructional quality commission.

02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:23.720
And there we also we had some discussion and review. And so today there are just a limited number of changes to what the instructional quality commission recommended, again, utilizing these general guideposts for recommendations.

02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:41.720
And so our line edits are noted in Attachment 2 for you as indicated by this slide. And again, in our very high level overview of our edits, they were designed to clarify language, to add resources, to curate lessons, to align formatting, and to resolve accessibility issues.

02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:53.720
We also have these additional minor recommendations that are not listed in Attachment 2.

02:38:53.720 --> 02:39:19.720
Which brings us back to our recommendation to you today, which is recommending that you, the State Board of Education, adopt the ethnic studies model curriculum with line edits described in Attachment 2, as well as the additional recommendations as outlined on slide five, as well as authorizing CDE staff pending approval of the State Board of Education, excuse me, the State Board of Education's executive director to prepare revisions.

02:39:19.720 --> 02:39:28.720
Requested by this body and correcting typographical errors and non-substantive clarifying edits. Thank you. I now turn it over to you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:41.720
Thank you so much. Wow. I am going to recommend that before we go to public comment, we'll take a 30 minute break, allow people to get lunch and a break.

02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:52.720
But before we do that, I want to thank all the presenters that we heard from for their knowledge and commitment to this work and to their lifetime commitment to human and civil rights.

02:39:52.720 --> 02:40:01.720
I want to thank Dr. Manuel Rustin and all of the IQC members for their determination and stamina and guidance.

02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:08.720
And in particular, thanks for your reference to Afrofuturism and Octavia Butler, one of my all time favorite authors.

02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:23.720
I want to thank all the CDE staff for their unbelievably hard work from State Superintendent Tony Thurman to Deputy Superintendent Stephanie Gregson, and especially our IQC and curriculum frameworks director, Dr.

02:40:23.720 --> 02:40:33.720
Shemeane Coates, plus all the many staff who supported, wrote, cataloged comments and persevered through this process.

02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:44.720
I do want to note in response to one of the questions that came up this morning that the governor's budget does propose $5 million specifically for training and ethnic studies.

02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:59.720
Plus an allocation to the subject matter projects that do offer training and ethnic studies, plus a specific mention of ethnic studies and the 250 million professional development, a pot of money that has been proposed.

02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:10.720
So there is an express commitment to not only ensure that we get to a model curriculum, but that we really enable people to learn it.

02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:17.720
So it has been a journey. This has been an amazing start to our conversation.

02:41:17.720 --> 02:41:24.720
I do want us to come into public comment fresh and ready to listen and hear.

02:41:24.720 --> 02:41:46.720
So with that, it's about 1116, let's say at 1145, we will reconnoiter and we'll be ready for both hearing from our liaisons and launching our public comment and of course asking clarifying questions of the staff and the committee as needed.

02:41:46.720 --> 02:41:58.720
And with that, don't go far, don't turn off your, don't leave the meeting, just turn off your camera and your microphone.

02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:06.720
All right, thanks very much. We need to reestablish our quorum. So Brooks, can you please call the roll?

02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:08.720
Member Burr.

02:42:08.720 --> 02:42:10.720
President Darling-Hemmed.

02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:11.720
Here.

02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:13.720
Member Fatah.

02:42:13.720 --> 02:42:14.720
Here.

02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:16.720
Member Loverwoods.

02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:17.720
Here.

02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:19.720
Member McQuillan.

02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:20.720
Here.

02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:22.720
Member Navo.

02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:23.720
Here.

02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:25.720
Member Petillo-Brownson.

02:42:25.720 --> 02:42:26.720
Here.

02:42:26.720 --> 02:42:28.720
Member Rodriguez.

02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:29.720
Here.

02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:31.720
Member Rucker.

02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:32.720
Present.

02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:34.720
Vice President Strauss.

02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:35.720
Here.

02:42:35.720 --> 02:42:37.720
Member Sun.

02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:38.720
Here.

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:40.720
I have a quorum.

02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:50.720
All right. Thanks so much. We are going to open the phone line for the public comment queue and I would ask that we put up the public comment slide.

02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:59.720
Members of the public who will wish to provide comment can do so by calling the telephone number and entering the access code as noted on the slide.

02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:06.720
We ask as always that all callers be respectful and comments must be related to the item before the board.

02:43:06.720 --> 02:43:15.720
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask Member Glover-Woods, as our ethnic studies liaison, if she has any initial comments.

02:43:15.720 --> 02:43:25.720
And then I'll ask our IQC liaisons if they want to add to those comments before we proceed to public comment.

02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:28.720
So, Member Glover-Woods.

02:43:28.720 --> 02:43:32.720
Thank you, President Darling-Hemmed, and good afternoon to everyone.

02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.720
Just very appreciative of the comments and the presentations that we were able to hear this morning.

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:46.720
I'd like just to take a couple of moments to reiterate some very key pieces as we consider the draft that is before us today.

02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:55.720
First and foremost, again, an extension of gratitude to all those who have contributed to the draft that is being presented to us.

02:43:55.720 --> 02:44:06.720
We think about the thousands of Californians that have contributed their thoughts, their ideas via written or verbal feedback, inclusive of those who will be sharing with us today.

02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:09.720
Again, much appreciation to the IQC.

02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:14.720
We were able to hear from three of the phenomenal commissioners of the IQC today.

02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:26.720
And I do have to share with the board that, again, over 22 months, three field reviews and four revisions for this document.

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:43.720
And the IQC has listened intently and had some very focused conversations to ensure that the draft was presented to us was in alignment with the field of ethnic studies, as well as AB 2016 and the SPE guidelines.

02:44:43.720 --> 02:45:03.720
And again, an extension of gratitude to the California Department of Education, State Superintendent Tony Thurman, and most importantly, Director Coats, who has again spent countless hours to ensure that the document presented before us aligns to all of those important areas that I just shared.

02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:09.720
Just to reiterate, again, a few points that I think will be important for us to keep in mind.

02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:21.720
Even though this is considered the ethnic studies model curriculum, it's not a curriculum in the general sense that many educators and parents and communities think of a curriculum to be.

02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:30.720
This is a guidance document. We heard that reiterated multiple times this morning. This is a guidance document. It's not a document designed for students.

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:42.720
It's not designed to be a guide for local education agencies that would like to strengthen existing ethnic studies courses or to develop ethnic study courses themselves.

02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:50.720
It's a very strong resource. However, there is no mandate that this resource be used in that development.

02:45:50.720 --> 02:46:13.720
Another piece that I would like to reiterate is that the bridge that State Superintendent Thurman mentioned has been included with the sample lessons so that we are able to ensure that the draft has a sample of lessons that represent the diversity of our state.

02:46:13.720 --> 02:46:21.720
This is not all inclusive. A lot of effort has been made to include as many voices as possible in this particular document.

02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:34.720
Because AB 2016 requires that the ethnic studies model curriculum be written as a guide to allow school districts to adapt their courses to reflect the people demographics in their communities.

02:46:34.720 --> 02:46:49.720
And we know again that this is a first step in conversations that will take place at the local level as they make determinations on their ethnic studies courses, either the development or again extension or strengthening of existing ethnic study courses.

02:46:49.720 --> 02:46:57.720
As I conclude my comments, I would just again like to point out another area of the guideline.

02:46:57.720 --> 02:47:16.720
And the guideline says that the ethnic studies model curriculum shall promote critical thinking, rigorous analysis of history, systems of oppression, and the status quo in an effort to generate discussions on futurity and imagine new possibilities.

02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:31.720
And one thing that we know and this has been historical discussions about race and ethnicity and the lived experiences of people in our country and in our state have always been difficult conversations.

02:47:31.720 --> 02:47:38.720
There are varying thoughts and ideas, and that it has just been what is typical and what we know.

02:47:38.720 --> 02:48:00.720
What we also know is that discussions and conversations around how the systems, the policies, and the practices that we have and how they've impacted people within our country, those who have been marginalized, underserved, and the rest of the communities are very difficult as well.

02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:28.720
But what we want to be able to do, and this guide definitely provides an opportunity to do so, is allow for students to engage in that critical thinking, to engage in that rigorous analysis of those systems so that there can be a knowledge and understanding of the lived experiences, not of just themselves, but lived experiences of people where they may not have those same lived experiences.

02:48:28.720 --> 02:48:38.720
And this particular document provides a very strong resource in which to enter into those conversations in the ethnic studies classroom.

02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:59.720
Lastly, I will say, and President Darling-Hammond spoke to this right before our break, that we know this is, again, a first step of many steps that will take place at the local level, and that it's important that teachers who are teaching ethnic studies and who will teach ethnic studies are supported in being able to do so.

02:48:59.720 --> 02:49:12.720
So just as we allow for professional development in areas of mathematics and science and English language arts and the like, professional development for teachers who will be teaching ethnic studies is critical.

02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:23.720
And the governor has allocated funding in his budget, as well as the use of the effective educator block grant dollars can help to support in that regard.

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:47.720
So again, just want to provide some of those framing comments to the board as we are prepared to receive public comment, and as we engage in discourse around this very thoughtfully developed document that has, again, is reflective of the tens of thousands of comments, as well as the many months that have gone into the draft that we have before us today.

02:49:47.720 --> 02:49:55.720
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:49:55.720 --> 02:50:12.720
Thank you. And I'm going to see if Vice President Strauss and Member Rucker have any additional comments as our liaisons to the IQC.

02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:33.720
Yes, I'll make a few comments just to support Member Glover-Woods' comments and just thank everyone who's been part of the process, but particularly this morning for the Superintendent Sperman and his guests that set the context and for all the work that Director Coats and the team have done at CD and the State Board to get us this far.

02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:40.720
I mean, it's been a lot of work getting here, but I would just say and support Member Glover-Woods, there's a lot of work ahead.

02:50:40.720 --> 02:51:03.720
And so four years, four drafts, 100,000 comments, and I think it's a lot better. Nothing's perfect, but I think it's important to remember that this is a guidance document and that while it's not a mandate, it's our hope that districts will take a look at their current coursework, at future coursework, and use this as a resource.

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:13.720
I think this document that we see now is balanced. It's focused with a lot of resources and is inclusive, and that's really important.

02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:20.720
And all the edits are in alignment with the State Board guidelines and guidelines of maybe 2016.

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:25.720
I so appreciate the work of the Instructional Quality Commission that helped guide the process.

02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:38.720
You got to see some of our amazing leaders today on IQC, our new chair, Dr. Manuel Rustin and Dr. Deborah Costa-Hernandez, our vice chair, and David Ponti is a member.

02:51:38.720 --> 02:51:47.720
They are incredibly valuable and reflect our State Board Advisory Commission that really helps to guide all of our work and all of our frameworks.

02:51:47.720 --> 02:51:56.720
So let me just say as the former high school principal of a very large diverse high school, I so understand the importance and benefit of ethnic studies for all students.

02:51:56.720 --> 02:52:06.720
But also as a former assistant superintendent of educational services, I understand the process that districts will now have to engage in as they move forward with this.

02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:16.720
In order to write a course, they're going to have to have an advisory group, they're going to have to include teachers, they're going to have to get community input, they're going to have to look at the local context of their district.

02:52:16.720 --> 02:52:21.720
They're going to only have to look at informing their board and going through a board approval process.

02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:33.720
And then as Member Glover-Woods and our presenters from West Ed said, there's a huge amount of professional development that will need to be done to address content knowledge, professional learning support and instructional strategies.

02:52:33.720 --> 02:52:38.720
I'm so appreciative the governor's budget has professional development funds in it.

02:52:39.720 --> 02:52:47.720
And I know that we will count on county offices and our subject matter projects to continue to support professional training for that.

02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:51.720
But I do believe all students will benefit from this foundation of knowledge.

02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:59.720
And I think it's important that we acknowledge the most amazing, thorough, thoughtful process to get us to this point.

02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:04.720
So I look forward to hearing the public comments and the deliberation that will follow.

02:53:04.720 --> 02:53:05.720
Thank you.

02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:08.720
Thank you so much, Member Rucker.

02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:09.720
Thank you very much.

02:53:09.720 --> 02:53:21.720
I need to begin by saying that as a person of color sitting on this dais, this has been a very important, personal and passionate conversation that I've been privileged to be a part of.

02:53:21.720 --> 02:53:33.720
As a professional and as a person who has come through California public education, I know that I stand on the shoulders of Linda, Ruby, Ernest, James, Dolores, and Fred.

02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:43.720
Ethnic studies is a class for all students to learn about the struggles and contributions of Californians that many traditional history books probably overlook.

02:53:43.720 --> 02:53:56.720
You know, when I was in high school here in California, I learned about the colonies and the 13 colonies in Great Britain and the triangle trade between Africa, Great Britain and the colonies that was anchored by the slave trade.

02:53:56.720 --> 02:54:18.720
But it wasn't until I was a student at UC Davis in the Black Studies Department that I understood that the letters of Mark that were issued by the Crown in England to allow people we now call pirates to raid Spanish ships, turn those same individuals into criminals only because they began interfering with the slave trade that Britain so greatly depended on.

02:54:18.720 --> 02:54:33.720
I'm happy to know that this ethnic studies curriculum will be in place, and I was inspired by Dr. Webber to talk about the threat and the career and the sacrifice that many ethnic studies professors have made for a long time.

02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:50.720
Normally, during the April meeting, I would talk about a teacher who has inspired or honored me. It's important for me today to remember the contributions of the Black Studies Department at UC Davis, including one professor named Carl Mack.

02:54:50.720 --> 02:55:04.720
That's the partner when I started at UC Davis, I started at the program. There were 450 African American students who started with me as an undergraduate, and four years later, 65 of those African American students graduated with me.

02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:25.720
We were all bonded by the connection and support we received from those Black Studies professors, and that program was the smallest department on the campus, and we were just proud to see the word Black Studies on a building at the UC Davis campus that we were attending in the aftermath of the Bakke decision.

02:55:25.720 --> 02:55:43.720
That program was not supported by the university, and by the time I left that campus, it was gone. I suppose the bad news is it was gone. The good news is Carl Mack became the superintendent in the Del Paso Heights School District, and years later, he hired me, and I began my public school career.

02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:52.720
So if anybody ever wants to know where I came from, the next time you see him, you can blame him. But those are my stories and my personal stories.

02:55:52.720 --> 02:56:10.720
What I heard as the liaison for the History Social Science project, and as the curriculum framework was being developed, were all the personal stories that became very important to many different communities to represent, to be understood, and to be expanded into the History Social Science curriculum.

02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:25.720
That conversation continues here. What teachers need to know about supporting the learning of pupils of color, how to communicate core messages in powerful ways that are going to influence the beliefs of students about themselves.

02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:35.720
Teachers have to know how to do that, how to communicate to each child that he's valuable and important, and that he's capable in so many ways, and that he has potential.

02:56:35.720 --> 02:56:46.720
I have to know, if I'm that child's teacher, how to communicate that child. His impressive energy is an asset. His creative ways of thinking about issues is a talent to be nurtured.

02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:55.720
I have to know how to help this child understand and believe that he is loved. And with my help, there's so, so much more that students can accomplish.

02:56:55.720 --> 02:57:07.720
And that's the role and the passion that we hear in the conversations that we have received in the comments that we have already heard about the Ethnic Studies curriculum, and I know that we are about to hear.

02:57:07.720 --> 02:57:35.720
So I will stop making these. I will stop my comment here by simply saying I'm so pleased and so honored to have been able to work with the IQC and listen to the passion conversations and the impassioned work that the IQC members did to consider, listen to, nurture, and figure out ways to incorporate all of the concerns and ideas into a unique approach to implementing an Ethnic Studies curriculum.

02:57:37.720 --> 02:58:00.720
So thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and my members on the panel for allowing me to begin to give that statement, and I look forward to the conversation we will have after the public comment.

02:58:00.720 --> 02:58:23.720
Thank you so much. That's great framing. We're now going to open the phone line for the public comment queue. Members of the public wishing to provide comment may do so by entering the telephone number and the access code as noted on the PowerPoint slide, and I'll open the floor to public comment.

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:35.720
Yes, we now have 136 callers on the line. Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:58:40.720 --> 02:58:42.720
Caller, you're live.

02:58:46.720 --> 02:58:50.720
Caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:58:53.720 --> 02:59:20.720
My name is Molly Suze Oaken. I'm a parent and student of two students that were at Santa Fe High School and who have attended UCLA and UC Davis. While I appreciate all the work that's been done to revise the FMC, I would urge you to make certain needed further changes and to resist pressure to make the curriculum worse, as that would further systemic racism rather than uproot and eradicate it.

02:59:20.720 --> 02:59:32.720
First, please include the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition reflects the real life experiences of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration.

02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:56.720
The IHRA definition does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into and is experienced as anti-Semitism.

02:59:57.720 --> 03:00:04.720
Thank you. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:00:05.720 --> 03:00:26.720
Hello, my name is Lydia Person. I am a parent, an attorney, and I am married to a Jewish man. I oppose this curriculum. I'm going to give you my conclusions first. The Department of Education, teachers, school, politicians have created a hostile environment for many students by the critical race theory.

03:00:26.720 --> 03:00:46.720
You should anticipate civil rights lawsuits because this is a divisive agenda based on the color of skin. It's causing emotional distress in students as it teaches hate, blame, victimhood, animosity, guilt, and helplessness in children who cannot help how they were born or the color of their skin.

03:00:46.720 --> 03:01:08.720
You should anticipate massive exodus from public schools and anticipate a decrease in support for public schools, teachers, teachers unions as a result of this curriculum. This process was not balanced. We voted on Proposition 16. We rejected affirmative action and the Department of Education is ignoring the last election.

03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:15.720
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:01:16.720 --> 03:01:24.720
Caller, you're live.

03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:40.720
Hello, my name is Lisa Aberbach, a parent, a Californian and daughter of Holocaust survivors. While I appreciate all the work to revise the ESMC, I urge you to make further changes and resist pressure to make the curriculum worse.

03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:54.720
First, please include the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition reflects the real life experiences of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration.

03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:13.720
The IHRA definition does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into anti-Semitism.

03:02:13.720 --> 03:02:27.720
Lastly, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in Chapter 1 and repeat them throughout the curriculum, just like the language about values and outcomes. We need critical thinking, not one-sided political agendas and hate in our classrooms.

03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:36.720
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:50.720
Yes. Hi, my name is Eric and I'm a parent of a student in California system. While I appreciate all the work for the revised ESMC, I want you to make further changes and resist pressure to make the curriculum worse.

03:02:50.720 --> 03:03:05.720
First, I agree with the previous comments that the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and reject the pressure to remove it. The definition reflects the real life experiences of Jewish students, including my own, and it's being used by the Biden administration.

03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:28.720
The IHRA definition does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that the hate speech about Israel harms the Jews in California and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric often crosses the line, which it does with my students who have been made with hate in the schools because of that.

03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:39.720
Second, fix the numerous problems with the new Arab-American studies lesson. The lesson should not pressure students to do political activity or erase the unique story of Jews of the Middle East in color.

03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:50.720
Thank you, caller. Your time has expired. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:03:50.720 --> 03:04:04.720
Yes, my name is Deborah Barish. I'm a parent of two daughters in the California public school system. School system. I appreciate all the work that is done to revise the SMC. I urge you to make further changes.

03:04:04.720 --> 03:04:15.720
Please fix numerous problems with the new Arab-American studies lesson. The lesson should not pressure students to do political advocacy or erase the unique story of Jews in the Middle East.

03:04:15.720 --> 03:04:31.720
Second, please approve all changes requested by Jimena and move their lesson to the Asian-American studies section as part of South Asian community as they are. This section rightfully addresses Islamophobia but is missing Jimena's crucial lesson about anti-Semitism.

03:04:31.720 --> 03:04:46.720
Lastly, please acknowledge criticisms of Third World Liberation Front, including its promotion of anti-Semitism and celebration of brutal dictators like Lenin, Mao, and Ho Chi Minh. I urge you to make these revisions today for the sake of our students. Thank you.

03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:57.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:04:57.720 --> 03:05:01.720
Caller, you're live.

03:05:01.720 --> 03:05:09.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:05:09.720 --> 03:05:18.720
My name is Chloe Levion and I'm a student at UCLA. My parents escaped the Iranian Revolution to flee anti-Semitism to the safety of the United States.

03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:29.720
It was supposed to be different here. However, as a Jewish college student, I feared for my safety on campus. I constantly got harassed and now that harassment has shifted to social media threats.

03:05:29.720 --> 03:05:43.720
While I am grateful for the work that has been done to revise the ESMC, more changes are needed. Do not retract line edit 100. Instead, fix numerous problems with the new Arab-American studies lesson.

03:05:43.720 --> 03:05:58.720
The lesson should not pressure students to do political advocacy or erase the unique stories of Jews in the Middle East. Approve all changes requested by Jemena and move their lesson plan to the Asian-American studies section.

03:05:58.720 --> 03:06:05.720
That section rightfully addresses Islamophobia but is missing a crucial lesson about anti-Semitism. Thank you for your time.

03:06:05.720 --> 03:06:14.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:06:14.720 --> 03:06:24.720
My name is Scott Shane. I'm a grandparent of two school-age kids from the San Francisco Bay Area.

03:06:24.720 --> 03:06:38.720
While I appreciate all the work that has been done to revise the ESMC, I urge you to make further changes. First, please fix numerous problems with the new Arab-American studies lesson.

03:06:38.720 --> 03:06:45.720
The lesson should not pressure students to do political advocacy or erase the unique stories of Jews in the Middle East.

03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:52.720
Second, please approve all changes requested by Jemena and move their lessons to the Asian-American studies section.

03:06:52.720 --> 03:07:02.720
This section rightfully addresses Islamophobia but is missing Jemena's crucial lesson about anti-Semitism.

03:07:02.720 --> 03:07:15.720
Third, please acknowledge criticisms of the Third World Liberation Front, including its promotion of anti-Semitism and the celebration of brutal dictators like Lenin, Mao, and Ho Chi Minh.

03:07:15.720 --> 03:07:20.720
Lastly, please do not retract. Thank you, caller. Your time has expired.

03:07:20.720 --> 03:07:31.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:07:31.720 --> 03:07:34.720
Caller, you're live.

03:07:34.720 --> 03:07:42.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:49.720
My name is Jemena and I'm a student at San Diego State University. I'm a college student deeply concerned with the draft of this curriculum.

03:07:49.720 --> 03:07:57.720
As many of you have claimed, it is not aligned with the true values of ethnic studies. It is watered down to cater to the interests of right-wing groups.

03:07:57.720 --> 03:08:03.720
I am so disappointed with the empty promises and empty words spoken today given to us time and time again, but I will not lose hope.

03:08:03.720 --> 03:08:10.720
I demand that you reinsert the key terms critical to understanding these complex issues and stay true to the values and principles of ethnic studies.

03:08:10.720 --> 03:08:14.720
I demand you reconnect the racist and colonial framework affecting these groups.

03:08:14.720 --> 03:08:18.720
Take action to ensure that California's children grow up to be anti-racist and informed.

03:08:18.720 --> 03:08:29.720
Take action to ensure that California's children do not feel discriminated against, do not feel unheard, do not feel the pain and shame I once did of people called my mothers and terrorists as people misunderstood and hated us.

03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:34.720
Ensure California's Arab children don't feel erased and voiceless from this lacking Arab lesson plan.

03:08:34.720 --> 03:08:40.720
California teachers oppose this draft. Do not accept this draft. Do better and reject it. Thank you.

03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:47.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:08:47.720 --> 03:08:57.720
Hello, my name is Jaden and I am currently a junior in LAUSD. I trace my Jewish roots all the way back to Iran, which my parents fled after an increase in anti-Semitism.

03:08:57.720 --> 03:09:01.720
Time and time again, I have experienced hatred or biased comments for being a Mizrahi Jew.

03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:07.720
My hope is that the ESMT can help prevent this and act as a pathway to peace, however I am concerned.

03:09:07.720 --> 03:09:10.720
The ESMT process is favoring certain groups over others.

03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:21.720
Recently, there were many ethnic group studies added as subsections under Asian American studies and the Jewish community, specifically the Mizrahi community, was not, even though we also trace our ancestors back to Asia.

03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:26.720
Do not retract line edit 100 as it would take away a voice we really need to fight the hate.

03:09:26.720 --> 03:09:34.720
Right now, the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism is just in the appendix mentioned in Jemena's lesson plan, which covers Middle Eastern Jews like my family.

03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:42.720
It's important to push for this to be in the main section to help battle ignorance and hate. 68% of all California religious hate crimes target Jews.

03:09:42.720 --> 03:09:49.720
The solution is education. It's more than fair to include the Jemena lesson plan in the main curriculum to make a safer future for students like me.

03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:52.720
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, caller.

Hello, my name is Dior Acaba. I grew up in Sacramento Public Schools from K through 12.

03:10:04.720 --> 03:10:08.720
I am now an assistant professor in the College of Ethnic Studies at Texas State University.

03:10:08.720 --> 03:10:15.720
As an educator in the field of ethnic studies, I urge the State Board of Education not to pass this version of the ESMC.

03:10:15.720 --> 03:10:21.720
The edits do not reflect the full ethnic studies and it truly addresses systems of power and systems of oppression.

03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:25.720
This is not about appeasing the we cannot add in everyone in this draft.

03:10:25.720 --> 03:10:28.720
This is about addressing the deliberate watering down of the ESMC.

03:10:28.720 --> 03:10:37.720
This current draft does not align with all components, all of its components of the original ethnic studies concepts and principles.

03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:44.720
This draft also does not fully represent an Arab-American lesson plan inclusive of Palestine written by Arab-American studies experts and educators.

03:10:44.720 --> 03:10:47.720
This erasure is unacceptable in a document like this.

03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:52.720
In its current state, the ESMC document is not ready to serve teachers in teaching of full ethnic studies.

03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:57.720
I therefore urge the State Board of Education not to pass this version of the ESMC.

03:10:57.720 --> 03:10:59.720
Thank you. Thank you, caller.

03:10:59.720 --> 03:11:04.720

Hi, I'm Barbara Windham, a California parent.

03:11:09.720 --> 03:11:16.720
The critical ethnic studies approach has corrupted the ESMC, forcing a narrow ideological agenda rather than fostering student inquiry.

03:11:16.720 --> 03:11:25.720
Please remove the critical ethnic studies lens from the guiding values and principles and the subsequent chapters of the ESMC, replacing it with a balanced, constructive approach.

03:11:25.720 --> 03:11:30.720
This isn't a question of if ethnic studies should be taught, but how it should be taught.

03:11:30.720 --> 03:11:40.720
The critical approach in the ESMC fuels hostile racial divisions rather than finding common ground and judges students based on arbitrary skin color rather than their character.

03:11:40.720 --> 03:11:51.720
Fanning the flames of conflict and judgment among ethnic groups in an increasingly polarized country will have disastrous consequences for our children and for democracy.

03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:59.720
Ethnic studies could combat racism while increasing empathy and a sense of community if it was taught with a constructive approach like LAUSD.

03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:07.720
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies lens before approving the ESMC as recommended by Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:09.720
Thank you very much. Thank you, caller.

Hi, my name is Justin Belbin. I'm a proud Israeli American and former member of UCLA's Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Student Advisory Board.

03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:29.720
I want to share my appreciation for all voices that have elevated California's ethnic diversity for CBE.

03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:46.720
I also want to affirm solidarity with Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in disturbing times and emphasize that we must oppose binaries in critical ethnic studies of oppressor and oppressed that are too often weaponized against Asian Americans and Jewish Americans when white supremacy and terror hits our communities.

03:12:46.720 --> 03:12:48.720
This starts in the classroom.

03:12:48.720 --> 03:12:57.720
We must instead support an equitable curriculum and constructive ethnic studies focused on joint solidarity between all marginalized communities, not animosity between our communities.

03:12:57.720 --> 03:13:02.720
Asian and Jewish integration and ethnic studies is not an exception. It is essential.

03:13:02.720 --> 03:13:10.720
I affirm support for the inclusion of both Jewish lesson plans and Asian American studies as we are a Southwest Asian community in origin.

03:13:10.720 --> 03:13:14.720
Do not retract line edit 100. Thank you.

03:13:14.720 --> 03:13:20.720

Good afternoon. My name is Mandy Bees. I'm with the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center.

03:13:28.720 --> 03:13:37.720
I'm calling in to provide our support for the adoption of the latest ESMC and this important resource to uplift the diverse experiences of our students and their communities.

03:13:37.720 --> 03:13:51.720
Southeast Asian American youth in particular have unique experiences with intergenerational trauma in the school to prison to deportation pipeline caused by personal and refugee experiences with war, genocide and displacement.

03:13:51.720 --> 03:14:03.720
In addition to high rates of poverty and criminalization, Southeast Asian American youth report invisibility, bullying, the lack of culturally relevant support in schools and classrooms as key factors to the marginalization.

03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:12.720
So it's really critical to pass the model curriculum to take a step toward addressing these challenges and sharing visibility and inclusion for our communities. Thank you.

03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:18.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:14:23.720 --> 03:14:28.720
Hi, my name is Rachel Urbinski. I'm a mixed race Asian American student at UC Berkeley from Los Angeles.

03:14:28.720 --> 03:14:37.720
I support Take Care as suggested edits to the model curriculum and the Safe American Arab American Studies suggested edits for the ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:44.720
Note that resistance and figures from communities of color like Angela Davis and Yuri Kochiyama must be included in the model curriculum.

03:14:44.720 --> 03:14:54.720
Our resistance will never be as violent as white supremacy, so it's a myth that including these figures encourages violence when colonialism and imperialism are the most violent forces of them all.

03:14:54.720 --> 03:15:01.720
Imagine a lesson taught about the Atlanta murders flooded with questions from students about both sides, or this was just an attack on women, not Asian people.

03:15:01.720 --> 03:15:10.720
This is not open discussion. This is just harmful to Asian students. And exactly what will happen if the model curriculum allows any room for bigotry.

03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:20.720
I urge the board to revise the model curriculum to showcase all forms of resistance from communities of color and stand firm against structures of oppression the way that the original fathers intended.

03:15:21.720 --> 03:15:27.720
Once again, please incorporate care as in Safe American Studies suggested edits to the model curriculum. Thank you.

03:15:27.720 --> 03:15:32.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

Hello, my name is Ryan Simpkins. I'm a resident of Anaheim, California.

03:15:43.720 --> 03:15:56.720
And I've heard a lot said here over the last several hours. In fact, one of the, I believe the gentleman that wrote the bill, he's got a picture of La Raza in his background, which means the race.

03:15:56.720 --> 03:16:05.720
And so it's very important if we're going to speak about race that we do bring the Bible into the discussion.

03:16:05.720 --> 03:16:10.720
Before we took the Bible out of schools, we didn't have such issues. We didn't have school shootings.

03:16:10.720 --> 03:16:15.720
We didn't have mass shootings, probably because we had the Ten Commandments that the children learned.

03:16:15.720 --> 03:16:19.720
They learned how to pray, learned how to love one another.

03:16:19.720 --> 03:16:28.720
And so when you think thou shall not kill out of school, it's no wonder that we have mass shootings and we have so much division among the students.

03:16:28.720 --> 03:16:33.720
So I think that's really the key is getting back to the biblical standard.

03:16:33.720 --> 03:16:39.720
And the biblical standard teaches that there is one race and there is one God.

03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:44.720
And we're all God's creation. Your time is up.

03:16:44.720 --> 03:16:49.720

Hello, my name is Anna Maya and I am a junior at Benita Vista High School.

03:16:59.720 --> 03:17:05.720
As a Latin Jewish woman with Arabic and Turkish descent, I am well aware that my ancestry and culture is very diverse,

03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:09.720
although I have close to never seen myself represented within a school classroom.

03:17:09.720 --> 03:17:14.720
Too many times do I get odd looks when I tell my peers that I am part Arabic, Turkish, Latin and Jewish.

03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:19.720
They tell me it is impossible and that I do not look it, so I must be lying.

03:17:19.720 --> 03:17:24.720
Although I am grateful for the work that has been done to revise the curriculum, more changes are needed.

03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:30.720
I urge you to include the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and reject pressure to remove it.

03:17:30.720 --> 03:17:37.720
This definition reflects the lived experiences of Jewish students like me and is being used by the Biden administration.

03:17:37.720 --> 03:17:39.720
It does not prevent criticism of Israel.

03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:44.720
It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world.

03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:51.720
A definition of Islamophobia is mentioned in the Asian American section of the curriculum and has every single right to be there.

03:17:51.720 --> 03:17:55.720
Therefore, there is no reason why anti-Semitism isn't just as important to mention.

03:17:55.720 --> 03:18:02.720
I also urge you not to retract line 100 of the model curriculum in the Asian section of the curriculum.

03:18:02.720 --> 03:18:07.720

I'm Jody Fockelauer, a Jewish teacher educator.

03:18:12.720 --> 03:18:19.720
I totally support ethnic studies, but this sad mishmash is not ethnic studies. You have to vote no.

03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:26.720
The CDE and the Board of Ed have to stop letting pro-Israel lobbyists and legislators police ethnic studies,

03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:32.720
including Jewish American studies in the AAPI section, the erasure of Palestine,

03:18:32.720 --> 03:18:39.720
and the deference to the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, which does equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism,

03:18:39.720 --> 03:18:48.720
are clear examples of how much the CDE has let the Anti-Defamation League, the JCRC, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center control the ESMC.

03:18:48.720 --> 03:18:56.720
The increasing violence Jews face is not a result of BDS or naming Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib as leaders.

03:18:56.720 --> 03:18:59.720
It's rooted in the white supremacy on which the U.S. was built.

03:18:59.720 --> 03:19:03.720
For all students, including Ashkenazi Jewish and other white students,

03:19:03.720 --> 03:19:08.720
learning the truth about U.S. history doesn't create a hostile environment. It's liberating.

03:19:08.720 --> 03:19:13.720
Respect our youth enough to give them the tools to work together to make a better place.

03:19:13.720 --> 03:19:20.720

Hi, my name is Liz Lewis, and I'm a modern U.S. history major at UC Berkeley.

03:19:27.720 --> 03:19:34.720
I'm calling in support of critical ethnic studies and discussion of colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy, which the curriculum hardly emphasizes.

03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:37.720
I'm alarmed about what the curriculum does discuss, though.

03:19:37.720 --> 03:19:38.720
I'd like to read a quote.

03:19:38.720 --> 03:19:45.720
Hearing two buses near the Texas border stopped with Beto signs full of illegals, which had $100, and were headed to the polls.

03:19:45.720 --> 03:19:52.720
This was stated in 2018 by Larry Swacart, who is known for spreading misinformation and wrote a patriot's history of the United States.

03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:57.720
This text is included as an excerpt in the sample lesson plan 26 for indigenous studies.

03:19:57.720 --> 03:20:01.720
This is the same curriculum that many speakers this morning strongly endorse.

03:20:01.720 --> 03:20:10.720
As a black woman born and raised in California, I am disappointed that people like this are included in the curriculum, but figures like Angela Davis and Yoriko Chiami are not.

03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:19.720
I urge the IQC to review the CARE-Ed suggested edits made by a group of 400 scholars in the field that have been endorsed by the Matriarchs for the Third World Liberation Front.

03:20:19.720 --> 03:20:26.720
I'm disturbed about the comments today that I've used the word anti-Semitism to disrespect the BIPOC activists of the 20th century.

03:20:26.720 --> 03:20:27.720
Thank you, caller.

Hi, my name is Joyce Reynolds, and I am a California voter and parent.

03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:47.720
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies lens before approving the ESMC.

03:20:47.720 --> 03:20:59.720
I support ethnic studies and believe ethnic studies when taught constructively, as in the Los Angeles ethnic studies curriculum, can build empathy and understanding while combating racism.

03:20:59.720 --> 03:21:11.720
Unfortunately, the proposed ESMC is based on critical ethnic studies, which pits students against each other by defining them as victims or oppressors based on the color of their skin.

03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:18.720
Please use a constructive ethnic studies approach and reinstate the Los Angeles curriculum as a resource for teachers.

03:21:18.720 --> 03:21:27.720
In K-12 education, it is imperative that students are exposed to multiple perspectives, taught to think critically and form their own opinions.

03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:39.720
ESMC's guiding values and principles must be revised to reflect a diversity in viewpoint and open inquiry and discussion, not the current political indoctrination approach.

03:21:39.720 --> 03:21:40.720
Thank you, caller.

03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:43.720

Hi, my name is Amira Jaramakani.

03:21:49.720 --> 03:22:00.720
I'm president of the Arab American Studies Association, a professor of women's gender and sexuality studies at San Diego State University, and a parent of three children who attend California public schools.

03:22:00.720 --> 03:22:07.720
I wholeheartedly agree with Dolores Huerta, Shirley Weber, and others that it is time to introduce ethnic studies in K-12 curriculum.

03:22:07.720 --> 03:22:13.720
But this version, gutted of its anti-racist, decolonial, liberatory tenets, doesn't serve anyone.

03:22:13.720 --> 03:22:26.720
The model presented today shamefully censors lessons that mention Palestinian Americans, and this act of censoring represents the predominantly white right-wing interests that have helped shape this latest draft, while experts in the field are ignored.

03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:28.720
Ethnic studies has always had to fight.

03:22:28.720 --> 03:22:33.720
Indeed, Shirley Weber mentions that scholars used to be warned that it would sink their careers to be in it.

03:22:33.720 --> 03:22:44.720
Few scholars understand that experience better than critical Swana scholars who have been censored for decades for incorporating analysis of Palestine in relation to structural racism in U.S. imperialist legacies.

03:22:44.720 --> 03:22:46.720
Don't censor us now.

03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:50.720
Reinstate the model that ethnic studies scholars and educators originally...

Hello, my name is Iman and I'm a member of American Muslims for Palestine's Bay Area Chapter.

03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:39.720
I'm speaking today to ask the State Board of Education to vote no on the current ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:23:39.720 --> 03:23:49.720
The last draft of the curriculum was so deficient that the entire advisory committee and designated writers of the original ESMC requested that their names be removed from the document.

03:23:49.720 --> 03:24:04.720
The curriculum needs to be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color to reinsert Arab-American studies, including lessons on Palestine within Asian-American studies section of the ESMC with a pedagogy developed by Arab-American educators that's true to the discipline of ethnic studies.

03:24:04.720 --> 03:24:16.720
The decision to purge Arab-American studies from Asian-American studies marginalizes Arab-American history and Arab people and perpetuates the shameful history of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism in this country.

03:24:16.720 --> 03:24:24.720
All students of color deserve to see themselves in the school curriculum and understand their histories and have wisdom plans which are anti-racist, de-colonial, and liberatory.

03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:28.720
Please vote no and ensure that the curriculum is rewritten to include Arab-American studies.

03:24:28.720 --> 03:24:29.720
Thank you.

03:24:29.720 --> 03:24:30.720

Hi, my name is Sophia Arman and I am a scholar of Southwest Asian North African-American communities specializing in Armenian-American studies.

03:24:48.720 --> 03:24:56.720
The voices of Armenian-Americans have been erased from the ethnic studies model curriculum even though we've submitted over 9,000 comments in this process.

03:24:56.720 --> 03:24:58.720
We've been engaged for over two years.

03:24:58.720 --> 03:25:05.720
Armenian-American studies must be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies together with all West Asian-American studies.

03:25:05.720 --> 03:25:08.720
Item 09, attachment 2, must be rejected.

03:25:08.720 --> 03:25:12.720
It's actually offensive at this point because we've been engaged so much.

03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:14.720
This draft is not ready.

03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:21.720
You all need to consult ethnic studies scholars who specialize in studying West Asian communities as a racial group within the U.S.

03:25:21.720 --> 03:25:27.720
Part of the problem that keeps happening is that many of you are falling into the traps and tropes that our students face.

03:25:27.720 --> 03:25:30.720
And we have experts in the field who know how to do this.

03:25:30.720 --> 03:25:33.720
Reject item 09, attachment 2.

03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:34.720
This draft is not ready.

03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:36.720
You need to hear the calls of our communities.

03:25:36.720 --> 03:25:39.720
We will not be erased any longer.

03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:40.720
Thank you, caller.

03:25:40.720 --> 03:25:43.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:47.720
Your time starts now.

03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:50.720
Hi, my name is Samir.

03:25:50.720 --> 03:25:55.720
I'm a recent graduate at the University of California, Riverside and a member of the Palestinian youth movement.

03:25:55.720 --> 03:26:01.720
I'm calling this afternoon to encourage the board to vote no on the current ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:07.720
Growing up in the Gateway City's community of Manzabea, I was only Palestinian in most if not all settings.

03:26:07.720 --> 03:26:11.720
And I grew quickly accustomed to being the chief spokesperson to the community at large,

03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:18.720
defending it under assault from right-wing talking points and racist slurs without even knowing much about my own community.

03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:24.720
As a result of this, there was a disconnection from my community and a lack of awareness where I even came from for most of my life,

03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:30.720
only being revealed in snippets thrown about in dinner table conversations from the few living family members.

03:26:30.720 --> 03:26:37.720
Ethnic studies must be preserved and protected to give students the power to fight back against and assault their identities and their communities

03:26:37.720 --> 03:26:41.720
and empower them to go beyond the defensive posture I was used to growing up.

03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:47.720
We need an ethnic studies curriculum that is truly decolonial, anti-racist and liberatory

03:26:47.720 --> 03:26:52.720
and to not allow the true discipline of ethnic studies to be washed away by right-wing intros.

03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:53.720
Thank you.

03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:57.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:02.720
Your time starts now.

03:27:02.720 --> 03:27:05.720
Hi, my name is Cindy Shamban.

03:27:05.720 --> 03:27:14.720
I call on you to reject the current version of ESMC and make sure that ethnic study educators are the ones to rewrite it.

03:27:14.720 --> 03:27:22.720
Ethnic studies is oriented towards teaching the history of U.S. racism, colonial conquest and enslavement

03:27:22.720 --> 03:27:28.720
and its impacts on others who live in or have immigrated to the United States.

03:27:28.720 --> 03:27:34.720
As the original draft referenced Palestine and Israel's settler colonial policies,

03:27:34.720 --> 03:27:39.720
there has been a backlash from several Jewish Zionist organizations.

03:27:39.720 --> 03:27:44.720
It is highly unusual for the Jewish caucus of the California state legislature,

03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:51.720
pro-Israel interest groups such as ADL, JCRC and the Simon Wiesenthal Center

03:27:51.720 --> 03:27:55.720
to be involved in the shaping of the ethnic studies curriculum.

03:27:55.720 --> 03:28:02.720
One cost is the loss of the writers of the original draft who are experts in the field of ethnic studies.

03:28:02.720 --> 03:28:06.720
Another cost is the loss of the entire concept of ethnic studies.

03:28:06.720 --> 03:28:07.720
Thank you, caller.

03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:09.720
Your time's up. Thank you.

03:28:09.720 --> 03:28:12.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:28:12.720 --> 03:28:16.720
Your time starts now.

03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:18.720
My name is Ellen Broski.

03:28:18.720 --> 03:28:22.720
Vote no on this curriculum because it doesn't meet ethnic studies standards.

03:28:22.720 --> 03:28:29.720
Anti-racist Jews oppose the hijacking of the curriculum by anti-Palestinian Zionist organizations.

03:28:29.720 --> 03:28:32.720
An ethnic studies educator eloquently stated,

03:28:32.720 --> 03:28:36.720
these groups don't want students to learn about systems of power and oppression

03:28:36.720 --> 03:28:40.720
because they themselves feel threatened by the loss of their own power.

03:28:40.720 --> 03:28:44.720
Jewish studies does not belong in AAPI studies.

03:28:44.720 --> 03:28:48.720
Arab-American studies does belong because the study of colonialism

03:28:48.720 --> 03:28:55.720
and its impact on immigration to the United States is central to the principles and pedagogy of ethnic studies.

03:28:55.720 --> 03:29:00.720
Zionist organizations have worked overtime to censor ethnic studies educators

03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:08.720
who correctly included information on Israel's oppressive settler colonial policies toward Palestinians

03:29:08.720 --> 03:29:14.720
because the decolonial anti-racist curriculum challenges Zionism's racism

03:29:14.720 --> 03:29:17.720
and their power to control the narrative about Israel.

03:29:17.720 --> 03:29:18.720
Thank you.

03:29:18.720 --> 03:29:19.720
Thank you, caller.

03:29:19.720 --> 03:29:22.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:29:22.720 --> 03:29:26.720
Your time starts now.

03:29:26.720 --> 03:29:27.720
My name is Celine Kusini.

03:29:27.720 --> 03:29:29.720
I'm a member of the Palestinian youth movement.

03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:32.720
I'm calling today to urge the SBE to vote no on the current ESMC

03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:35.720
as it does not meet the standards of ES or the mandate of 2016.

03:29:35.720 --> 03:29:40.720
It is completely unacceptable for the CDE to allow predominantly white right-wing interest groups to define ethnic studies.

03:29:40.720 --> 03:29:44.720
Such groups should not be able to override the work of actual ethnic studies scholars

03:29:44.720 --> 03:29:47.720
in determining what should be incorporated into the ESMC.

03:29:47.720 --> 03:29:53.720
Ethnic studies emerged as a discipline in order to resist the history of US racism, colonial conquest, and enslavement.

03:29:53.720 --> 03:29:57.720
However, the CDE enlisted non-ethnic studies scholars and right-wing institutions

03:29:57.720 --> 03:30:00.720
and as a result has completely sanitized and watered down the curriculum

03:30:00.720 --> 03:30:03.720
to exclude an analysis and critique of racism and other systems of oppression.

03:30:04.720 --> 03:30:06.720
This draft is not ethnic studies.

03:30:06.720 --> 03:30:08.720
Multiculturalism is not ethnic studies.

03:30:08.720 --> 03:30:12.720
We demand a true ethnic studies curriculum that is anti-racist, anti-colonial, and liberatory.

03:30:12.720 --> 03:30:16.720
We demand the ESMC be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color

03:30:16.720 --> 03:30:21.720
to reinsert Arab-American lessons, including Palestine, within the Asian-American Studies section of the ESMC.

03:30:21.720 --> 03:30:26.720
Ethnic studies scholars agree that it is impossible to understand Arab-American issues without understanding Palestine.

03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:29.720
So then where would the exclusion of Palestine leave Arab youth?

03:30:29.720 --> 03:30:31.720
Thank you, caller.

03:30:31.720 --> 03:30:34.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:30:34.720 --> 03:30:36.720
Your time starts now.

03:30:39.720 --> 03:30:45.720
Hi, my name is Thomas Timsarian Dolan, and I'm a proud Armenian-American descendant of Armenian refugees in California

03:30:45.720 --> 03:30:48.720
and member of the next generation of ethnic studies scholars.

03:30:48.720 --> 03:30:53.720
The voices of Armenian-Americans are being erased from the ethnic studies model curriculum,

03:30:53.720 --> 03:30:57.720
even though we have submitted over 9,000 comments in this process.

03:30:57.720 --> 03:31:02.720
Armenian-American studies must be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies,

03:31:02.720 --> 03:31:05.720
together with all other West Asian-American studies.

03:31:05.720 --> 03:31:10.720
The status of the bridging section is unclear and must be clarified to the public and added in the main curriculum.

03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:16.720
The SBE and IQC must bring in ethnic studies scholars who specialize in studying West Asian communities

03:31:16.720 --> 03:31:20.720
and all West Asian-American communities as a racial group within the United States.

03:31:20.720 --> 03:31:23.720
We will not allow our histories and struggles to be ignored,

03:31:23.720 --> 03:31:26.720
especially in the state with our largest community in the U.S.

03:31:26.720 --> 03:31:30.720
This moment of crisis demands that we dramatically reimagine our collective liberation

03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:35.720
and sharpen our vision to see that the struggle is not only global, but it must be radically inclusive.

03:31:35.720 --> 03:31:37.720
Thank you.

03:31:37.720 --> 03:31:39.720
Thank you, caller.

03:31:39.720 --> 03:31:42.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:31:42.720 --> 03:31:44.720
Your time starts now.

03:31:49.720 --> 03:31:51.720
Caller, you're live.

03:31:51.720 --> 03:31:53.720
Oh, hello. Hello, my name is Liz Jackson.

03:31:53.720 --> 03:31:58.720
I'm a Jewish parent of two children in California, public schools and an attorney with Palestine Legal.

03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:02.720
I urge the State Board of Education to reject this curriculum and vote no.

03:32:02.720 --> 03:32:05.720
I want to speak specifically to the IHRA definition.

03:32:05.720 --> 03:32:08.720
It needs to be removed completely.

03:32:08.720 --> 03:32:17.720
It is a censorship tool by design that promotes ignorance and classifies essentially all criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic.

03:32:17.720 --> 03:32:22.720
The IHRA definition endangers Jews by distracting us from white supremacist hate,

03:32:22.720 --> 03:32:26.720
worse, it routinely is wielded as a censorship tool in our schools.

03:32:26.720 --> 03:32:33.720
My organization has fielded over 1,700 calls since 2012 of students and scholars and community members who have all been censored,

03:32:33.720 --> 03:32:38.720
harassed, falsely accused of anti-Semitism because of their advocacy for Palestinian rights,

03:32:38.720 --> 03:32:44.720
and they wield the IHRA definition as the tool to make these false accusations.

03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:51.720
So it is time for ethnic studies, but it is not a so-called good start to have a curriculum

03:32:51.720 --> 03:32:56.720
that excludes Arab-American studies and reifies censorship tools.

03:32:56.720 --> 03:33:00.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:33:00.720 --> 03:33:02.720
Your time starts now.

03:33:04.720 --> 03:33:06.720
My name is Haig Manassian.

03:33:06.720 --> 03:33:10.720
I'm an Armenian-American student concerned about our erasure in the curriculum.

03:33:11.720 --> 03:33:13.720
Throughout my education in the California school system,

03:33:13.720 --> 03:33:16.720
I was always so disappointed to never find my background represented,

03:33:16.720 --> 03:33:21.720
and personally I've had to deal with the racism on many occasions as a result of ignorance on who Armenians are.

03:33:21.720 --> 03:33:25.720
The voices of Armenian-Americans are being erased from the ethnic studies model curriculum,

03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:29.720
even though we've submitted thousands and thousands of comments in this process.

03:33:29.720 --> 03:33:32.720
Obviously, this is something our community is not okay with.

03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:37.720
Armenian-American studies must be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies

03:33:37.720 --> 03:33:40.720
together with all other West Asian-American studies.

03:33:40.720 --> 03:33:43.720
Item 9, attachment 2, must be rejected.

03:33:43.720 --> 03:33:47.720
We are not included even though we have been saying the same thing in all these comments for these two years.

03:33:47.720 --> 03:33:53.720
The SBE must bring in ethnic studies scholars who specialize in studying West Asia communities

03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:55.720
as a racial group within the United States.

03:33:55.720 --> 03:33:57.720
We will not be erased.

03:33:57.720 --> 03:33:59.720
Our histories and struggles are often ignored,

03:33:59.720 --> 03:34:04.720
but we won't allow them to be in the state with our largest community in the United States.

03:34:04.720 --> 03:34:06.720
Thank you.

03:34:07.720 --> 03:34:08.720
Thank you.

03:34:08.720 --> 03:34:11.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:13.720
Your time starts now.

03:34:15.720 --> 03:34:17.720
My name is Dr. Suzy Abadian.

03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:22.720
I'm an academic K-12 educator, Syrian-Armenian immigrant, a third generation refugee,

03:34:22.720 --> 03:34:26.720
an English language learner, and an elected member of the South Pasadena School Board.

03:34:26.720 --> 03:34:29.720
I'm here to represent the Armenian School Board Association

03:34:29.720 --> 03:34:32.720
comprised of elected school board members across California.

03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:37.720
We are and have been from the beginning strong supporters of a critical anti-racist

03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:40.720
and decolonial California ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:34:40.720 --> 03:34:45.720
But we are here today because we are concerned that Armenian-Americans are being erased from the model curriculum

03:34:45.720 --> 03:34:49.720
even though we have submitted over 9,000 comments in this process.

03:34:49.720 --> 03:34:54.720
Armenian-American studies must be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies

03:34:54.720 --> 03:34:57.720
together with all other West Asian-American studies.

03:34:57.720 --> 03:34:59.720
Item 9, attachment 2, must be rejected.

03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:04.720
The SB must bring in ethnic studies scholars to specialize in studying West Asian communities

03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:07.720
as a racial group within the United States.

03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:09.720
We cannot be erased any longer.

03:35:09.720 --> 03:35:14.720
Many Armenian-American students are immigrants, refugees, children of immigrants, and English language learners.

03:35:14.720 --> 03:35:18.720
They have been subjected to racialized and discriminatory practices.

03:35:19.720 --> 03:35:23.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:25.720
Your time starts now.

03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:32.720
Hi, my name is Larry Hendel and I'm a member of Jewish Voice for Peace.

03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:38.720
The current draft of the ESMC does not meet ethnic studies standards or the mandate of AB 2016.

03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:40.720
You should vote no.

03:35:40.720 --> 03:35:46.720
As a Jew, I'm particularly upset over the 18-month effort of pro-Israel, anti-Palestinian organizations

03:35:46.720 --> 03:35:52.720
such as the JCRC, ADL, and Wiesenthal Foundation to remove Arab-American studies from the curriculum.

03:35:52.720 --> 03:35:57.720
And I'm greatly disappointed in the CDE for rolling over in this regard.

03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:02.720
Arab-American studies must be strengthened and considered a bona fide part of Asian-American studies

03:36:02.720 --> 03:36:06.720
with its lesson plans prepared by Arab-American ethnic studies educators

03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:09.720
and the Palestinian narrative must be included.

03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:13.720
The latest idea of adding Jewish studies to Asian-American studies, frankly, is a joke

03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:17.720
and it is a racist trivialization of ethnic studies.

03:36:17.720 --> 03:36:22.720
Last, do not include the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in the ESMC.

03:36:22.720 --> 03:36:24.720
Thank you.

03:36:24.720 --> 03:36:25.720
Thank you, caller.

03:36:25.720 --> 03:36:28.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:36:28.720 --> 03:36:30.720
Your time starts now.

03:36:32.720 --> 03:36:34.720
My name is Larry Christian.

03:36:34.720 --> 03:36:40.720
I am president of Karama, a nonprofit in San Diego that focuses on issues of the Arab and Islamic world.

03:36:40.720 --> 03:36:43.720
This proposal capitulates to political pressure groups

03:36:43.720 --> 03:36:48.720
and in so doing offers a misleading narrative on Arabs and Arab-Americans.

03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:51.720
It is colonialism redux.

03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:57.720
Its refusal to address Arab-American identity while propounding the unprecedented proposition

03:36:57.720 --> 03:37:01.720
that Jewish-American studies are part of Asian-American studies

03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:04.720
is a modern-day rerun of the history of the Arab world

03:37:04.720 --> 03:37:07.720
from the Balfour Declaration to the League of Nations mandate

03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:10.720
to the present-day occupation of Palestine.

03:37:10.720 --> 03:37:15.720
It is bad historiography and is antithetical to the principles of ethnic studies.

03:37:15.720 --> 03:37:19.720
Adopting it would be an embarrassment for public education in California

03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:25.720
and a betrayal of the courageous students whose sacrifices led to the creation of modern ethnic studies.

03:37:25.720 --> 03:37:27.720
Don't do it.

03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:28.720
Thank you, caller.

Caller, we seem to have some technical difficulties.

03:37:36.720 --> 03:37:37.720
Please call back.

03:37:48.720 --> 03:37:49.720
Hello?

03:37:49.720 --> 03:37:51.720
Yes, caller, you're live.

03:37:51.720 --> 03:37:52.720
Am I live?

03:37:52.720 --> 03:37:53.720
Yes.

03:37:53.720 --> 03:37:54.720
Please go ahead.

03:37:54.720 --> 03:37:55.720
Oh, okay.

03:37:55.720 --> 03:38:01.720
I'm Ronna Spall, California educator of 35 years, parent and grandparent.

03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:06.720
This curriculum is based on critical race theory, which is discriminatory.

03:38:06.720 --> 03:38:12.720
Martin Luther King said a person should be judged on the content of his character,

03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:14.720
not on the color of his skin.

03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:20.720
According to Martin Luther King, the person should be judged on the content of his character,

03:38:20.720 --> 03:38:23.720
not on the color of his skin.

03:38:23.720 --> 03:38:29.720
According to the California Education Code, instructional material must not contain any matter

03:38:29.720 --> 03:38:35.720
reflecting on persons on the basis of race, and educators must promote harmonious relations

03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:41.720
in the classroom and not foster discriminatory bias on the basis of race.

03:38:41.720 --> 03:38:45.720
There are many white students coming from other countries.

03:38:45.720 --> 03:38:51.720
Should a poor white boy whose family emigrated from Russia and who lost family in the Holocaust

03:38:51.720 --> 03:38:54.720
be judged as having white privilege?

03:38:54.720 --> 03:39:00.720
I urge the board to adopt a constructive ethnic studies model rather than the critical

03:39:00.720 --> 03:39:05.720
ethnic studies model that is there currently.

03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:06.720
Thank you.

03:39:06.720 --> 03:39:07.720
Thank you, caller.

03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:10.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:12.720
Your time starts now.

03:39:15.720 --> 03:39:20.720
Hi, my name is Naz Hanid.

03:39:20.720 --> 03:39:21.720
Can you hear me?

03:39:21.720 --> 03:39:22.720
Yes, we can.

03:39:22.720 --> 03:39:23.720
Please go ahead.

03:39:23.720 --> 03:39:24.720
Okay.

03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:25.720
Thank you so much.

03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:26.720
My name is Naz Hanid.

03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:27.720
I'm calling from Irvine, California.

03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:33.720
I'm here to support the API School Board Members Association position that the SBE approved

03:39:33.720 --> 03:39:34.720
the ESFP today.

03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:38.720
While we understand that it is not perfect, we also know that history is living and there

03:39:38.720 --> 03:39:41.720
will be opportunities to incorporate changes when implementing locally.

03:39:41.720 --> 03:39:46.720
The AAPI community consists of about 50 ethnic groups with over 100 languages.

03:39:46.720 --> 03:39:51.720
Thus, the breadth of sample lessons in the AAPI section of Chapter 4 is critical for

03:39:51.720 --> 03:39:54.720
the relevance of the ESMC in local communities.

03:39:54.720 --> 03:39:59.720
With the rise in anti-Asian violence and xenophobia, now is the time to say yes to enabling our

03:39:59.720 --> 03:40:02.720
students to build bridges and connections through ethnic studies.

03:40:02.720 --> 03:40:06.720
I also highly encourage you to add lesson plans for the Pakistani American and Bangladeshi

03:40:06.720 --> 03:40:08.720
American ethnic studies communities.

03:40:08.720 --> 03:40:09.720
Thank you.

03:40:09.720 --> 03:40:10.720
Thank you.

03:40:10.720 --> 03:40:11.720
Thank you.

03:40:11.720 --> 03:40:14.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:40:14.720 --> 03:40:16.720
Your time starts now.

03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:20.720
We're a five-month plan and then we compare them.

03:40:20.720 --> 03:40:22.720
Caller, you're live.

03:40:22.720 --> 03:40:24.720
Please sort of give an explanation.

03:40:24.720 --> 03:40:25.720
Hello.

03:40:25.720 --> 03:40:26.720
Yes.

03:40:26.720 --> 03:40:28.720
There seems to be some background noise.

03:40:28.720 --> 03:40:29.720
Yes.

03:40:29.720 --> 03:40:36.720
My name is Cynthia Chan, API School Board Members Association president and also a board member

03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:40.720
of the Los Gatos Federal Rights Union High School District.

03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:45.720
Recently, our board has approved a one-semester ethnic course.

03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:48.720
It requires 10,000 students and teachers.

03:40:48.720 --> 03:40:54.720
This course is an introduction to the experience of ethnic communities that are rarely represented

03:40:54.720 --> 03:40:55.720
in textbooks.

03:40:55.720 --> 03:41:01.720
We also examine race, ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic and cultural groups in the United

03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:02.720
States.

03:41:03.720 --> 03:41:09.720
The course equips students with the critical lens to see the world and then face India

03:41:09.720 --> 03:41:16.720
by understanding system and power as a root American society and motivates students to

03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:20.720
actively engage in our democracy.

03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:25.720
For the same reason, I urge the State Board of Education approve ESMB today.

03:41:25.720 --> 03:41:26.720
Thank you.

03:41:26.720 --> 03:41:27.720
Thank you.

03:41:27.720 --> 03:41:31.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:41:31.720 --> 03:41:32.720
Your time starts now.

03:41:36.720 --> 03:41:37.720
Hi.

03:41:37.720 --> 03:41:38.720
My name is Kathy McKnight.

03:41:38.720 --> 03:41:41.720
I'm with Citizens for Parental Rights.

03:41:41.720 --> 03:41:48.720
The ESMB directly violates California's Constitution and the Education Code.

03:41:48.720 --> 03:41:52.720
Therefore, the board should not even consider approving this curriculum.

03:41:52.720 --> 03:41:57.720
Article 1, Section 31 of our Constitution says that the state shall not discriminate

03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:02.720
against or give preference to any individual or group on the basis of race, color or ethnicity.

03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:05.720
Ed Code Section 220 says the same.

03:42:05.720 --> 03:42:10.720
However, the curriculum portrays anyone with light skin as being part of an oppressor group.

03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:15.720
How does this promote harmonious relations as required by Ed Code 233.5?

03:42:15.720 --> 03:42:22.720
EC-51501 says the board cannot adopt instructional materials that reflect adversity on anyone

03:42:22.720 --> 03:42:25.720
based on race, ethnicity or religion.

03:42:25.720 --> 03:42:31.720
The ESMB discriminates and reflects adversely on a large number of students and their parents.

03:42:31.720 --> 03:42:38.720
Legally, the SBE cannot approve this curriculum and our state and our students don't need to be further divided.

03:42:38.720 --> 03:42:39.720
Thank you.

03:42:39.720 --> 03:42:40.720
Thank you.

03:42:40.720 --> 03:42:44.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:42:44.720 --> 03:42:46.720
Your time starts now.

03:42:50.720 --> 03:42:51.720
Hi.

03:42:51.720 --> 03:42:55.720
My name is Alice Tuluwa and I'm a Pacific Islander advocate living in Monterey, California.

03:42:55.720 --> 03:43:00.720
I'm urging the State Board of Education to not pass this version of the ESMC

03:43:00.720 --> 03:43:05.720
because it has not been fully inclusive of the contributions of Arab-American educators.

03:43:05.720 --> 03:43:09.720
While we're happy that our Pacific Islander lesson plan has gone into the ESMC,

03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:16.720
we're very, very concerned that our brothers and sisters in Arab-American studies have not been consulted by the CBE

03:43:16.720 --> 03:43:20.720
and any lesson plans inclusive of Palestine has been erased.

03:43:20.720 --> 03:43:24.720
The status quo today is that we yield power to dominant culture.

03:43:24.720 --> 03:43:29.720
The education system built upon that has promoted the society we're seeing today,

03:43:29.720 --> 03:43:33.720
one that is currently terrorized by white supremacist racism.

03:43:33.720 --> 03:43:39.720
The historical whitewashing of our education has contributed to the racism and systems of oppression

03:43:39.720 --> 03:43:42.720
that we're fighting to undo and walk back today.

03:43:42.720 --> 03:43:47.720
You must make sure this guidance document provides an accurate and proper guidance

03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:50.720
that includes all people in California.

03:43:50.720 --> 03:43:54.720
And that must include what Arab-American educators have contributed.

03:43:55.720 --> 03:43:59.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:43:59.720 --> 03:44:01.720
Your time starts now.

03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:05.720
Hi. My name is Nora Russo.

03:44:05.720 --> 03:44:07.720
I am an attorney in Los Gatos.

03:44:07.720 --> 03:44:13.720
I am the proud daughter of Holocaust survivors from Greece who survived the war in Greece

03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:16.720
and emigrated to the United States in the 50s.

03:44:16.720 --> 03:44:23.720
I would like the lesson, in the proposed lesson plan on Jewish Americans,

03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:30.720
I would like to add that Jewish Americans emigrated from Western Europe as well as Eastern Europe.

03:44:30.720 --> 03:44:35.720
I am sick of comments that suggest that any criticism of ethnic studies come from, quote,

03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:43.720
white right-wing activists or that Jews have tried to erase Arab Americans from the curriculum.

03:44:43.720 --> 03:44:45.720
That is not true.

03:44:45.720 --> 03:44:53.720
The lesson seven on redlining says nothing about the practice as employed against Jews.

03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:55.720
It's a lost opportunity.

03:44:55.720 --> 03:45:02.720
My husband's own family was restricted from where they could live in New Jersey in the 1960s.

03:45:02.720 --> 03:45:05.720
I urge that lesson to be amended.

03:45:05.720 --> 03:45:07.720
Finally, not all Arabs...

03:45:07.720 --> 03:45:09.720
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

03:45:09.720 --> 03:45:13.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:45:13.720 --> 03:45:15.720
Your time starts now.

03:45:18.720 --> 03:45:23.720
Hi. My name is Jasmine Amin and I am a Persian Jewish student at Beverly Hills High School.

03:45:23.720 --> 03:45:27.720
Unfortunately, antisemitism has always been a part of my life.

03:45:27.720 --> 03:45:32.720
From having someone break into my place of worship and vandalize it

03:45:32.720 --> 03:45:37.720
or having a random person spit on me because I was speaking Hebrew and call me a dirty Jew.

03:45:37.720 --> 03:45:43.720
While I am grateful for the work that has been done to revise the ESMC, more changes are needed.

03:45:43.720 --> 03:45:51.720
I ask that you please do not retract line 100 and include the full IHRA definition of antisemitism

03:45:51.720 --> 03:45:54.720
and reject pressure to remove it.

03:45:54.720 --> 03:46:02.720
This definition reflects the lived experiences of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration.

03:46:02.720 --> 03:46:04.720
It does not prevent criticism with Israel.

03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:11.720
It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world.

03:46:11.720 --> 03:46:14.720
I'm a strong believer in the power of education.

03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:18.720
Should children learn about the history of the Jewish people and the way both the Holocaust

03:46:18.720 --> 03:46:25.720
and antisemitism have impacted us as a whole, I believe there will be significantly less hate speech.

03:46:25.720 --> 03:46:27.720
Thank you, Paula. Your time is up.

03:46:27.720 --> 03:46:30.720
Next, Paula, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:46:30.720 --> 03:46:32.720
Your time starts now.

03:46:34.720 --> 03:46:38.720
Hello. My name is Leah Renson and I'm a California parent.

03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:43.720
The Critical Ethnic Studies approach has corrupted the ESMC, forcing a narrow ideological agenda

03:46:43.720 --> 03:46:45.720
rather than fostering student inquiry.

03:46:45.720 --> 03:46:49.720
Please remove the Critical Ethnic Studies lens from the guiding values and principles

03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:55.720
and the subsequent chapters in the ESMC, replacing it with a balanced, constructive approach.

03:46:55.720 --> 03:46:59.720
There is some evidence that well-designed Ethnic Studies curricula have positive academic

03:46:59.720 --> 03:47:01.720
and social outcomes for students.

03:47:01.720 --> 03:47:05.720
The curricula in these studies had nothing to do with Critical Race Theory

03:47:05.720 --> 03:47:09.720
or Critical Ethnic Studies ideology, which served to divide children

03:47:09.720 --> 03:47:13.720
rather than fostering understanding across differences.

03:47:13.720 --> 03:47:19.720
It is not necessary to sacrifice inquiry or impose a political ideology for Ethnic Studies

03:47:19.720 --> 03:47:21.720
to have a positive impact on all students.

03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:28.720
The only exploration allowed in the current ESMC is within the framework of Critical Ethnic Studies ideology,

03:47:28.720 --> 03:47:31.720
never questioning its dogmatic underpinnings.

03:47:31.720 --> 03:47:36.720
Please revise and remove the Critical Ethnic Studies lens from this model curriculum

03:47:36.720 --> 03:47:39.720
before approving the ESMC. Thank you.

03:47:39.720 --> 03:47:45.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:13.720
As the author of a highly regarded bullying report

03:48:13.720 --> 03:48:16.720
and a partner with the Islamophobia Study Center in Berkeley,

03:48:16.720 --> 03:48:20.720
as well as the representatives of almost one million people in California,

03:48:20.720 --> 03:48:25.720
I'm surprised and concerned that organizations like ours were not consulted by either the IQC

03:48:25.720 --> 03:48:30.720
or CDE when it came to revising the originally recommended model curriculum.

03:48:30.720 --> 03:48:34.720
I was also concerned that the experts that were responsible for the original proposed curriculum

03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:36.720
pulled their support for the revised model.

03:48:36.720 --> 03:48:40.720
As an alumnus of UC Berkeley's African American and African Diaspora Studies program,

03:48:40.720 --> 03:48:44.720
I worked with other scholars in the field of Ethnic Studies to determine ways to ensure

03:48:44.720 --> 03:48:49.720
our most vulnerable communities and their children can see themselves in their school curriculum.

03:48:49.720 --> 03:48:51.720
Many have said in response to Arab-American studies...

03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:53.720
Thank you, caller.

03:48:53.720 --> 03:48:58.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:49:00.720 --> 03:49:03.720
Hi, my name is Fatima. I'm a member of the Palestinian Youth Movement

03:49:03.720 --> 03:49:06.720
based in Southern California as well as a recent graduate of UC Irvine.

03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:10.720
I'm calling today to oppose the current model of the Ethnic Studies curriculum.

03:49:10.720 --> 03:49:15.720
The current model waters down the guiding values that Ethnic Studies has historically rooted itself

03:49:15.720 --> 03:49:20.720
in by discarding anti-colonial, anti-imperialist, and anti-racist frameworks

03:49:20.720 --> 03:49:24.720
in favor of bland multiculturalism that does not criticize power.

03:49:24.720 --> 03:49:29.720
Critical terms such as revolution, capitalism, right wing, and even ethnic studies

03:49:29.720 --> 03:49:31.720
have been removed from key sections.

03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:34.720
Arab history has been marginalized and dismissed, and Palestine,

03:49:34.720 --> 03:49:39.720
which plays a central role in Arab history, has been wiped off the geographic map.

03:49:39.720 --> 03:49:43.720
While systemic racism is mentioned, there are no lesson plans around it.

03:49:43.720 --> 03:49:48.720
The lack of critical analysis in the last draft is so great that the entire advisory committee

03:49:48.720 --> 03:49:54.720
and the designated writers of the original ESMCU requested that their names be removed from the document.

03:49:54.720 --> 03:49:59.720
It is also especially telling that the veterans of the original 1968 Third World Liberation Front

03:49:59.720 --> 03:50:03.720
and the Black Student Union strikes that led to Ethnic Studies as a discipline

03:50:03.720 --> 03:50:05.720
were spoken out in opposition.

03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:11.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:14.720
Can you hear me?

03:50:14.720 --> 03:50:17.720
Yes. Please proceed, caller.

03:50:17.720 --> 03:50:22.720
Okay. My name is Akhil Gopal. I'm a member of Jewish Voice for Peace LA.

03:50:22.720 --> 03:50:26.720
And I think it's extremely ironic that you spent the last couple hours

03:50:26.720 --> 03:50:31.720
patting yourselves on the back about inclusion when you're purposefully excluding Palestine.

03:50:31.720 --> 03:50:34.720
And then you've been patting yourselves on the back for speaking truth to power

03:50:34.720 --> 03:50:40.720
when you, the IQC, are that power and have been ignoring Palestinians speaking truth to you.

03:50:40.720 --> 03:50:44.720
This model curriculum is fundamentally not ethnic studies,

03:50:44.720 --> 03:50:49.720
which is about anti-racist, anti-colonial, and anti-capitalist education with youth.

03:50:49.720 --> 03:50:53.720
And what it is is actually colonial multicultural propaganda.

03:50:53.720 --> 03:50:57.720
So I immediately demand that you include Palestine and Arab-American studies

03:50:57.720 --> 03:51:00.720
in Asian and Muslim studies where it belongs.

03:51:00.720 --> 03:51:04.720
And then you restore the original guiding values of ethnic studies

03:51:04.720 --> 03:51:07.720
that actually made it the academic discipline it is today

03:51:07.720 --> 03:51:11.720
and reinsert the key terms and definitions of ethnic studies,

03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:13.720
including capitalism and ethnic studies,

03:51:13.720 --> 03:51:16.720
which you actually deleted in some places from the curriculum.

03:51:16.720 --> 03:51:20.720
So what's happening right now is actually a complete shame and a sham.

03:51:20.720 --> 03:51:22.720
And I don't know.

03:51:23.720 --> 03:51:26.720

03:51:43.720 --> 03:51:45.720
Hello.

03:51:45.720 --> 03:51:49.720
I'm Mary Campbell, African-American, grad at an HBCU,

03:51:49.720 --> 03:51:52.720
and parent of four children in California Public Schools.

03:51:52.720 --> 03:51:56.720
These comments illustrate what will be the results of this program

03:51:56.720 --> 03:52:00.720
or division, not unity, or empathy you must vote out today.

03:52:00.720 --> 03:52:04.720
Usually, we see trouble by emotion to create a program

03:52:04.720 --> 03:52:07.720
with a goal though at titled ethnic studies,

03:52:07.720 --> 03:52:10.720
which seems to focus more profoundly on the business education,

03:52:10.720 --> 03:52:14.720
prejudicial concepts, and indoctrination of cultural monasticism

03:52:14.720 --> 03:52:16.720
as represented by the comments.

03:52:16.720 --> 03:52:20.720
With Orwellian, we see ethnic studies like anti-racist

03:52:20.720 --> 03:52:23.720
and other modernly invented terminology actually need...

03:52:27.720 --> 03:52:29.720
Thank you, caller.

03:52:47.720 --> 03:52:49.720
Your time starts now.

03:52:52.720 --> 03:52:55.720
My name is Regina Waldman.

03:52:55.720 --> 03:52:58.720
I'm a Jewish woman from the Southwest Asia

03:52:58.720 --> 03:53:00.720
and the president of Jemena,

03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:03.720
Jews, indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa.

03:53:03.720 --> 03:53:08.720
Antisemitism in Libya forced my family to escape to the United States.

03:53:08.720 --> 03:53:11.720
I'm concerned that the lesson titled Antisemitism

03:53:11.720 --> 03:53:15.720
in Jewish Middle Eastern America is the supplemental bridge lesson,

03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:20.720
but the lesson on Islamophobia is placed in the Asian Studies section.

03:53:20.720 --> 03:53:27.720
Please do not retract line edit 100 from slide 55

03:53:27.720 --> 03:53:29.720
and show equity and fairness

03:53:29.720 --> 03:53:33.720
and move the Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern American lesson

03:53:34.720 --> 03:53:38.720
to pair with the Islamophobia lesson as equally important.

03:53:38.720 --> 03:53:42.720
Jews of the Middle East and North Africa are recognized as Asian

03:53:42.720 --> 03:53:45.720
and we belong in the Asian section.

03:53:45.720 --> 03:53:49.720
Please include our lesson in the Asian studies

03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:53.720
and please include the definition of IHRA.

03:53:53.720 --> 03:53:55.720
Thank you.

03:53:55.720 --> 03:53:57.720
Thank you, caller.

03:54:04.720 --> 03:54:06.720
Hi.

03:54:06.720 --> 03:54:08.720
My name is Raama Awad

03:54:08.720 --> 03:54:11.720
and I'm a community advocate with the Arab Community Center in San Diego.

03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:15.720
I work with a community base of Arab immigrants and refugees here in San Diego

03:54:15.720 --> 03:54:18.720
and we have thousands of Arab youth in the public schools here.

03:54:18.720 --> 03:54:22.720
I find the current version of the ethnic studies model curriculum deeply concerning

03:54:22.720 --> 03:54:25.720
because it does not include lessons that are reflective and inclusive

03:54:25.720 --> 03:54:27.720
of their lived experiences.

03:54:27.720 --> 03:54:31.720
Our students, all students, but especially our Arab youth and students of color,

03:54:31.720 --> 03:54:35.720
deserve a curriculum that sees them and equips them with the knowledge of racism

03:54:35.720 --> 03:54:38.720
and systems of oppression which affects their everyday lives.

03:54:38.720 --> 03:54:43.720
Claims that education on Palestine or racism or colonialism is divisive

03:54:43.720 --> 03:54:47.720
or, quote unquote, spreads hate speech, the denial of historical facts

03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:50.720
and the realities of minority communities in the US.

03:54:50.720 --> 03:54:54.720
That being said, I urge the State Board of Education to vote no

03:54:54.720 --> 03:54:56.720
on this current ethnic studies model curriculum

03:54:56.720 --> 03:54:59.720
and I urge for the rewriting of this curriculum so that it includes

03:54:59.720 --> 03:55:03.720
includes Arab-American studies within Asian-American studies

03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:06.720
and so that it aligns with the guiding principles of ethnic studies.

03:55:06.720 --> 03:55:07.720
Thank you.

03:55:07.720 --> 03:55:08.720
Thank you.

03:55:08.720 --> 03:55:12.720

Your time starts now.

03:55:16.720 --> 03:55:18.720
Hello, my name is Diana Derueva.

03:55:18.720 --> 03:55:22.720
I'm a first generation college graduate and proud alumnus of Latinx studies

03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:25.720
at San Francisco State's College of Ethnic Studies.

03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:28.720
I encourage the board to vote no on the current model curriculum

03:55:28.720 --> 03:55:32.720
because it does not, not because of the Zionist and white supremacist

03:55:32.720 --> 03:55:35.720
false narratives given by previous scholars, but because this curriculum

03:55:35.720 --> 03:55:39.720
has been defanged of its foundational liberatory and decolonial tenants

03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:43.720
by critical race theory and analysis of global racial capitalism.

03:55:43.720 --> 03:55:46.720
Particularly alarming is the erasure of Arab-American studies

03:55:46.720 --> 03:55:47.720
from the model curriculum.

03:55:47.720 --> 03:55:51.720
I cannot advocate for an ethnic studies curriculum that represents my ethnic community

03:55:51.720 --> 03:55:54.720
yet marginalizes the experiences and contributions of Arab

03:55:54.720 --> 03:55:56.720
and Muslim diasporic communities.

03:55:56.720 --> 03:56:00.720
Furthermore, all the Jewish folks that called in have proven the urgent need

03:56:00.720 --> 03:56:03.720
for the inclusion of Arab-American studies in the model curriculum.

03:56:03.720 --> 03:56:07.720
Anti-Zionism and critique of brutal Israeli occupation of Palestine

03:56:07.720 --> 03:56:11.720
is not anti-Semitism and their gross assertions illustrate the dire need

03:56:11.720 --> 03:56:14.720
to set the record straight for future generations of California students.

03:56:14.720 --> 03:56:19.720
I demand that the Zionist IHRA definition of anti-Semitism not be included

03:56:19.720 --> 03:56:20.720
Thank you, caller.

03:56:20.720 --> 03:56:24.720

Caller, you're live.

03:56:33.720 --> 03:56:34.720
Hello?

03:56:34.720 --> 03:56:36.720
Yes, you're live. Go ahead.

03:56:36.720 --> 03:56:37.720
Hi, my name is Yavar.

03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:41.720
I'm a member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Committee in the San Francisco Bay Area.

03:56:41.720 --> 03:56:46.720
And I'm calling to say that you must vote no and reject the current curriculum

03:56:46.720 --> 03:56:50.720
and rewrite the curriculum to include Arab-American studies and Asian-American studies.

03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:56.720
This is a watered-down conservative draft that panders to right-wing and Zionist organizations.

03:56:56.720 --> 03:57:00.720
And you're deleting Palestine and silencing Palestinian voices.

03:57:00.720 --> 03:57:04.720
So you'll be guilty of really taking the right-wing side,

03:57:04.720 --> 03:57:07.720
taking the Zionist side in this critical moment in history.

03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:10.720
And I think you all should take a hard look at yourselves

03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:15.720
when you use these words of inclusion instead of liberation

03:57:15.720 --> 03:57:18.720
and really understand that you guys are at a critical moment

03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:21.720
where you cannot continue to silence Palestinian voices.

03:57:21.720 --> 03:57:24.720
And I think Palestine is the major issue here.

03:57:24.720 --> 03:57:29.720
So that's what we want to see, is that you rewrite this draft to include Palestine.

03:57:29.720 --> 03:57:35.720
Yeah, and I keep hearing inclusion instead of liberation.

03:57:35.720 --> 03:57:38.720
You guys have defanged. Is a great word. You guys have defanged.

03:57:38.720 --> 03:57:44.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:51.720
Hello, my name is Pa Tran.

03:57:51.720 --> 03:57:54.720
I'm a California parent and an Asian-American.

03:57:54.720 --> 03:57:58.720
I have concern regarding the critical ethnic studies.

03:57:58.720 --> 03:58:02.720
Students should not be identified as victims or oppressed

03:58:02.720 --> 03:58:04.720
based on the color of their skin.

03:58:04.720 --> 03:58:07.720
All of us, including students, are born unique.

03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:11.720
When the students are being labeled,

03:58:11.720 --> 03:58:15.720
we deter their growth and make them not accountable for their actions.

03:58:15.720 --> 03:58:18.720
It also would cause division and vulnerability.

03:58:18.720 --> 03:58:21.720
Labeling students is equivalent to name-calling.

03:58:21.720 --> 03:58:25.720
Name-calling has not been used and should never be accepted in schools.

03:58:25.720 --> 03:58:31.720
Please remove the critical ethnic studies before approving the ESMT.

03:58:31.720 --> 03:58:34.720
I hope you all should do the right thing for our students.

03:58:34.720 --> 03:58:37.720
Remove critical ethnic studies. Thank you for your time.

03:58:37.720 --> 03:58:39.720
Thank you, caller.

03:58:39.720 --> 03:58:42.720

03:58:45.720 --> 03:58:50.720
Hello.

03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:52.720
Yes.

03:58:52.720 --> 03:58:55.720
Hi, my name is Skylar Clark and I'm a UC Berkeley student.

03:58:55.720 --> 03:58:58.720
I'm calling in support of the CARE-Ed suggested edits to the model curriculum

03:58:58.720 --> 03:59:01.720
in order to remain true to the core values of ethnic studies

03:59:01.720 --> 03:59:05.720
by openly discussing the legacies of racism and systems of oppression.

03:59:05.720 --> 03:59:09.720
I also wanted to respond to claims mentioning institutionalized racism as divisive

03:59:09.720 --> 03:59:12.720
or that it puts students as victims and oppressors.

03:59:12.720 --> 03:59:14.720
Acknowledging racism and its effects is not racist,

03:59:14.720 --> 03:59:16.720
and this claim is an attempt at erasure.

03:59:16.720 --> 03:59:19.720
Feeding white guilt or exaggerating BIPOC victim narratives

03:59:19.720 --> 03:59:21.720
is not the goal of ethnic studies.

03:59:21.720 --> 03:59:24.720
It helps white students situate our histories, understand white privilege,

03:59:24.720 --> 03:59:27.720
and also learn to become better allies with white BIPOC communities.

03:59:27.720 --> 03:59:29.720
White students might have uncomfortable moments,

03:59:29.720 --> 03:59:33.720
but discomfort encourages growth reflection and transformative academic engagement,

03:59:33.720 --> 03:59:36.720
and it also encourages BIPOC students to take ownership of their histories

03:59:36.720 --> 03:59:39.720
and become more empowered to actually be liberated by this curriculum.

03:59:39.720 --> 03:59:42.720
So please encourage and incorporate these edits

03:59:42.720 --> 03:59:45.720
in order to remain true to the values of critical ethnic studies.

03:59:45.720 --> 03:59:46.720
Thank you.

03:59:46.720 --> 03:59:47.720
Thank you, caller.

03:59:57.720 --> 04:00:01.720
Maloy Lele, first honor to the First Nations of California,

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:04.720
California Department of Education, and all present.

04:00:04.720 --> 04:00:06.720
My name is Tawfa Setefano,

04:00:06.720 --> 04:00:09.720
and I am a product of Hayward Unified School District.

04:00:09.720 --> 04:00:14.720
I urge that you do not pass the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model curriculum.

04:00:14.720 --> 04:00:19.720
It does not center Black, Indigenous, and Native narratives.

04:00:19.720 --> 04:00:21.720
The CDE's vision is, quote,

04:00:21.720 --> 04:00:27.720
all California students of the 21st century will attain the highest level of academic knowledge,

04:00:27.720 --> 04:00:31.720
applied learning, and performance skills, end quote.

04:00:31.720 --> 04:00:35.720
The highest level of academic knowledge requires curriculum

04:00:35.720 --> 04:00:38.720
that reflects our times.

04:00:38.720 --> 04:00:44.720
I urge to reinsert Arab-American lessons, including Palestine,

04:00:44.720 --> 04:00:49.720
with content and pedagogy developed by Arab-American educators.

04:00:49.720 --> 04:00:53.720
Applied learning requires schools to be the space for analysis

04:00:53.720 --> 04:00:57.720
and all critiques of all systems of oppression.

04:00:57.720 --> 04:01:00.720
I urge that all original guiding values...

04:01:00.720 --> 04:01:03.720
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

04:01:14.720 --> 04:01:21.720
Hello. My name is Gabrielle Dimmick, and I am a UC Berkeley graduate student... graduate.

04:01:21.720 --> 04:01:25.720
I would like to start by saying that Eli Wiesel, Holocaust survivor,

04:01:25.720 --> 04:01:29.720
says that it is memory that will save humanity.

04:01:29.720 --> 04:01:33.720
And this is essential when we're considering an ethnic studies curriculum.

04:01:33.720 --> 04:01:37.720
It's absolutely imperative to include the truth of history of colonialism,

04:01:37.720 --> 04:01:43.720
slavery, genocide of Native Americans, and continued erasure and abuse and white supremacy.

04:01:43.720 --> 04:01:47.720
To heal as a country, all students must learn all the truth.

04:01:47.720 --> 04:01:51.720
This empowers and is necessary to connect.

04:01:51.720 --> 04:01:56.720
I support CARE-Edge Edict, the model curriculum that promote critical ethnic studies

04:01:56.720 --> 04:02:01.720
and conversations that include the truth of the history of the United States.

04:02:01.720 --> 04:02:03.720
Thank you.

04:02:03.720 --> 04:02:08.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:02:12.720 --> 04:02:18.720
Hello. My name is Joanne Donsky. I'm a California parent and retired educator.

04:02:18.720 --> 04:02:24.720
I support ethnic studies, but the critical ethnic studies approach has corrupted the ESMC,

04:02:24.720 --> 04:02:32.720
forcing a narrow ideological agenda and predetermined answers rather than fostering student inquiry.

04:02:32.720 --> 04:02:40.720
Critical ethnic studies actually inverts traditional American ideals of individual merit, opportunity, and success.

04:02:40.720 --> 04:02:45.720
It interprets all social interactions through the lens of oppression.

04:02:45.720 --> 04:02:50.720
If America's traditional narratives are designed to encourage social mobility and prosperity,

04:02:50.720 --> 04:02:59.720
ESMC's proposed Marxist narratives are designed to encourage intergroup conflict and perpetual upheaval in existing institutions.

04:02:59.720 --> 04:03:07.720
That's clear in student assignments, such as graphing a manifesto of demands for the Third World Liberation Front.

04:03:07.720 --> 04:03:12.720
The ESMC is not in the interest of ordinary Californians of any ethnicity.

04:03:12.720 --> 04:03:16.720
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies lens.

04:03:16.720 --> 04:03:18.720
Thank you, caller.

04:03:18.720 --> 04:03:23.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:03:27.720 --> 04:03:34.720
Hello. My name is Samina Osman. I'm the government relations coordinator for the Council on American and Islamic Relations, the San Francisco leader office.

04:03:34.720 --> 04:03:37.720
I'm a mother of a high schooler and a middle schooler.

04:03:37.720 --> 04:03:42.720
And like many parents of children who face Islamophobia and xenophobia and bigotry,

04:03:42.720 --> 04:03:48.720
I was truly looking forward to my children learning about ethnic studies that would reflect their history and background.

04:03:48.720 --> 04:03:52.720
And because I recognize the transformative effect of ethnic studies.

04:03:52.720 --> 04:03:58.720
Unfortunately, the current draft is stripped from its original model that included Arab-American studies in Palestine.

04:03:58.720 --> 04:04:02.720
This removal marginalizes Arab history and Arab people.

04:04:02.720 --> 04:04:07.720
The current draft lacks analysis and critique of racism and other systems of oppression.

04:04:07.720 --> 04:04:12.720
I urge the State Board of Education to vote no on the current on the current model.

04:04:12.720 --> 04:04:18.720
It needs to be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color to reinsert Arab-American studies lessons,

04:04:18.720 --> 04:04:27.720
including Palestine within the Asian-American studies section of the ethnic studies model curriculum with the content developed by Arab-American educators.

04:04:27.720 --> 04:04:31.720
And I want to reinsert the key terms and definitions aligned.

04:04:31.720 --> 04:04:35.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:04:35.720 --> 04:04:40.720
Your time starts now.

04:04:40.720 --> 04:04:46.720
Hi, my name is Panina Eilberg-Schwarz, and I'm a white Jew, daughter of rabbis and member of If Not Now.

04:04:46.720 --> 04:04:48.720
Vote no on the current ESMC.

04:04:48.720 --> 04:04:53.720
It must be rewritten by educators of color to reinstate Arab-American lessons, including Palestine,

04:04:53.720 --> 04:04:57.720
within Asian-American studies and to restore the original principles of ethnic studies.

04:04:57.720 --> 04:04:59.720
The current revision totally erodes these principles.

04:04:59.720 --> 04:05:03.720
As a white Jew who grew up in California public schools, I heard my story often.

04:05:03.720 --> 04:05:05.720
It was not the same for fellow students of color.

04:05:05.720 --> 04:05:11.720
So the revision suggestion that Ashkenazi Jewish experience fits into Asian-American studies is deeply misguided.

04:05:11.720 --> 04:05:15.720
As Jews, we need to contend with the real anti-Semitism embedded in white nationalism.

04:05:15.720 --> 04:05:21.720
But we can't listen to the false definitions the curriculum suggests by referring to the supposed leadership of the ABL,

04:05:21.720 --> 04:05:24.720
a group that targets social justice movements and does not represent us,

04:05:24.720 --> 04:05:30.720
and the IHRA definition, which equates and does equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.

04:05:30.720 --> 04:05:36.720
This is so harmful to Palestinians and other students of color, including Jews of color, whom the curriculum should support.

04:05:36.720 --> 04:05:41.720
It's harmful to any student asking good questions about Israeli violations of Palestinians' human rights.

04:05:41.720 --> 04:05:44.720
These revisions only push a right-wing agenda and silence critique.

04:05:44.720 --> 04:05:45.720
Thank you.

04:05:45.720 --> 04:05:46.720
Vote no.

04:05:46.720 --> 04:05:49.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

04:05:57.720 --> 04:05:58.720
Hello.

04:05:58.720 --> 04:06:00.720
My name is Armin Sahakian.

04:06:00.720 --> 04:06:05.720
I represent the AAC Western Region, the largest nonpartisan Armenian-American grassroots organization.

04:06:05.720 --> 04:06:11.720
And as a sibling of also my brother and sister who are in California public schools,

04:06:11.720 --> 04:06:20.720
I'm calling to tell that I'm deeply concerned that the Armenian-American experience is being erased from the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:06:20.720 --> 04:06:24.720
Even though we've submitted thousands and thousands of comments in this process,

04:06:24.720 --> 04:06:29.720
the Armenian-American studies must be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies,

04:06:29.720 --> 04:06:32.720
together with all other West Asian-American studies.

04:06:32.720 --> 04:06:36.720
The status of the bridging section, now named Sample Lessons, is unclear,

04:06:36.720 --> 04:06:41.720
and it also must be clarified to the public and added in the main curriculum.

04:06:41.720 --> 04:06:48.720
The SB must bring in ethnic studies scholars who specialize in studying West Asian communities as a racial group within the United States.

04:06:49.720 --> 04:06:50.720
We cannot be erased.

04:06:50.720 --> 04:06:52.720
Our histories and struggles are often ignored,

04:06:52.720 --> 04:06:58.720
but we won't allow them to be interstated with the largest Armenian-American community in the United States.

04:06:58.720 --> 04:06:59.720
Thank you very much.

04:06:59.720 --> 04:07:00.720
Thank you.

04:07:00.720 --> 04:07:04.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

04:07:11.720 --> 04:07:12.720
Hello.

04:07:12.720 --> 04:07:16.720
My name is Leva Loci, and I'm a Pacific Islander ethnic studies educator that was fortunate to take ethnic studies in high school

04:07:16.720 --> 04:07:18.720
with the North Carolina Educational Partnerships in San Francisco.

04:07:18.720 --> 04:07:21.720
In these radical spaces, I learned more about ethnic studies,

04:07:21.720 --> 04:07:28.720
which in its origins addresses how Black, Indigenous, and communities of color experience white supremacy and hetero patriarchy on and from stolen lands.

04:07:28.720 --> 04:07:32.720
This is why I urge the State Board of Education not to pass this version of the ESMC.

04:07:32.720 --> 04:07:34.720
One, the full document is not ethnic studies.

04:07:34.720 --> 04:07:37.720
It needs to realign authentic ethnic studies, guiding values and principles,

04:07:37.720 --> 04:07:42.720
and include key terms that were removed, such as revolution, capitalism, and systems of oppression.

04:07:42.720 --> 04:07:49.720
Two, it does not include Arab-American lesson plans written by Arab scholars that engage content on Palestine, which should not be excluded.

04:07:49.720 --> 04:07:51.720
If we think about the terrorism that recently happened in Georgia,

04:07:51.720 --> 04:07:54.720
climate change, police brutality, and racialized experiences due to COVID,

04:07:54.720 --> 04:08:00.720
the context of a multicultural education is not going to provide the critique for our youth to address these issues.

04:08:00.720 --> 04:08:03.720
Please reconsider how you have privileged certain voices in this process

04:08:03.720 --> 04:08:07.720
and pass a real, liberatory, anti-racist ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:08:07.720 --> 04:08:08.720
Thank you, caller.

04:08:08.720 --> 04:08:12.720

04:08:16.720 --> 04:08:17.720
Hi.

04:08:17.720 --> 04:08:18.720
Can you hear me?

04:08:18.720 --> 04:08:20.720
Yes, please go ahead.

04:08:20.720 --> 04:08:26.720
My name is Tammy Kim, Vice Mayor for the City of Irvine and Managing Director of the Korean American Center.

04:08:26.720 --> 04:08:33.720
We've seen an alarming increase of anti-Asian violence, including the massacre of Asian women in Atlanta,

04:08:33.720 --> 04:08:37.720
and we continue to be viewed as perpetual foreigners.

04:08:37.720 --> 04:08:45.720
A solution to eradicating violence against Asian Americans and other peoples of color is the comprehensive ethnic studies.

04:08:45.720 --> 04:08:52.720
The AAPI curriculum provides the knowledge for students to begin to understand our diverse communities

04:08:52.720 --> 04:08:57.720
and our Asian American contributions to the fabric of this nation.

04:08:57.720 --> 04:09:05.720
It is critical to move forward with APISMA's position to approve the ethnic studies model curriculum today

04:09:05.720 --> 04:09:09.720
so that more districts can implement ethnic studies locally.

04:09:09.720 --> 04:09:17.720
Let's use this as an opportunity to empower our students by giving them the tools they need to build connections

04:09:17.720 --> 04:09:21.720
and to be catalysts of anti-racism and social justice.

04:09:21.720 --> 04:09:22.720
Thank you.

Hello, my name is Bejini Tulumian.

04:09:32.720 --> 04:09:35.720
I'm with the Armenian National Committee of America Western Region.

04:09:35.720 --> 04:09:39.720
Although thousands of our community members submitted their comments on this,

04:09:39.720 --> 04:09:43.720
Armenian Americans are still being erased from the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:09:43.720 --> 04:09:48.720
I urge you to reinsert Armenian American studies in the draft and to be included in the main curriculum

04:09:48.720 --> 04:09:52.720
under Asian American studies within the West Asian American category.

04:09:53.720 --> 04:09:59.720
I also urge that the CDE consult with ethnic studies scholars who specialize in Armenian American studies.

04:09:59.720 --> 04:10:03.720
Item 9, attachment 2, should also be rejected.

04:10:03.720 --> 04:10:08.720
The status of the bridging section, which is now named sample lessons, is unclear

04:10:08.720 --> 04:10:12.720
and should be clarified to the public and added in the main curriculum.

04:10:12.720 --> 04:10:17.720
Armenian American students deserve to see their histories reflected and uplifted in their classrooms,

04:10:17.720 --> 04:10:19.720
so I'd like to see a more inclusive vision.

04:10:19.720 --> 04:10:21.720
Thank you.

04:10:21.720 --> 04:10:23.720

Hi, my name is Nicole Katangai.

04:10:50.720 --> 04:10:52.720
I'm a student from UC Berkeley.

04:10:52.720 --> 04:10:56.720
I strongly support the CARE-Ed suggested edits for the ethnic studies model

04:10:56.720 --> 04:10:59.720
because we rarely learn about Asian stories of resistance,

04:10:59.720 --> 04:11:04.720
let alone how American colonialism and imperialism has prompted our migration patterns

04:11:04.720 --> 04:11:09.720
and the ongoing fight against deportation, discrimination, and other forms of anti-Asian violence.

04:11:09.720 --> 04:11:12.720
The only exposure I had to the history of my own people,

04:11:12.720 --> 04:11:15.720
of the American occupation and colonization of the Philippines,

04:11:15.720 --> 04:11:18.720
was exposure that I had sought out myself.

04:11:18.720 --> 04:11:21.720
We never discussed the impact of the model minority mess in school,

04:11:21.720 --> 04:11:24.720
which erases the struggles of the Asian community.

04:11:24.720 --> 04:11:27.720
If we want to give our students agency to actively work against racism,

04:11:27.720 --> 04:11:32.720
we need a critical ethnic studies curriculum that names and combats the origins of this racism

04:11:32.720 --> 04:11:36.720
that includes colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy.

04:11:36.720 --> 04:11:38.720
Thank you.

04:11:38.720 --> 04:11:39.720

04:12:03.720 --> 04:12:04.720
Yes.

04:12:04.720 --> 04:12:06.720
My name is Marcos Aguilar.

04:12:06.720 --> 04:12:09.720
I'm an indigenous educator in Los Angeles,

04:12:09.720 --> 04:12:12.720
and I'm a co-founder of an Awakalmack Rock World School,

04:12:12.720 --> 04:12:15.720
a community-based indigenous people's K-12 school in LA.

04:12:15.720 --> 04:12:19.720
I've advocated for and redefined ethnic studies since 1988,

04:12:19.720 --> 04:12:24.720
including through a two-week hunger strike to demand the creation of what is now the Chicana and Chicano

04:12:24.720 --> 04:12:27.720
Latina Latino Studies Department at UCLA.

04:12:27.720 --> 04:12:32.720
As a student activist, I was willing to sacrifice my life alongside dozens of other students

04:12:32.720 --> 04:12:37.720
because we knew that the lie of public education was that it could be more complete,

04:12:37.720 --> 04:12:40.720
more correct, and more advanced without us.

04:12:40.720 --> 04:12:44.720
And I've taught Native American and Chicano studies in public schools since 1994.

04:12:44.720 --> 04:12:48.720
I urge you to create ongoing protocols that respect the rights of indigenous peoples

04:12:48.720 --> 04:12:54.720
to free, prior, and informed consent regarding this model curriculum as drafted and as implemented.

04:12:54.720 --> 04:12:59.720
As an indigenous educator, I know that in its current form it will continue to perpetuate

04:12:59.720 --> 04:13:03.720
deculturalization and assimilation upon indigenous children and youth.

04:13:03.720 --> 04:13:09.720
I uplift American Indian Studies Center Director Dr. Shannon Speed's letter to you by way of context.

04:13:09.720 --> 04:13:11.720

My name is Nora Abloh, and I work with Arab youth throughout the San Francisco Bay Area,

04:13:27.720 --> 04:13:33.720
largely displaced by U.S. boards and who face anti-Arab racism in their schools by teachers and students alike.

04:13:33.720 --> 04:13:38.720
The State Board of Education must vote no on the current ESMC.

04:13:38.720 --> 04:13:43.720
Instead, the ESMC needs to be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color

04:13:43.720 --> 04:13:49.720
to re-insert Arab American lessons, including Palestine, within Asian American studies

04:13:49.720 --> 04:13:55.720
and restore the guiding values and principles of ethnic studies as a working class Palestinian

04:13:55.720 --> 04:13:58.720
whose family is displaced by racist Israeli policies.

04:13:58.720 --> 04:14:05.720
I am disappointed that pro-apartheid groups like the ADL and JCRC have been centered in this process

04:14:05.720 --> 04:14:07.720
while we have been sidelined.

04:14:07.720 --> 04:14:11.720
Arab Americans and Palestinian Americans deserve to be recognized.

04:14:11.720 --> 04:14:18.720
Vote no because this draft is not ready and re-center ethnic studies scholars and educators.

04:14:18.720 --> 04:14:19.720
Thank you.

04:14:19.720 --> 04:14:20.720

Yes, hi, my name is Stephanie Hansen.

04:14:31.720 --> 04:14:34.720
I'm a mother of three school-aged children in Orange County, California.

04:14:34.720 --> 04:14:39.720
I'm strongly opposed to adding this ethnic study framework and curriculum for K-12

04:14:39.720 --> 04:14:42.720
and including it as a high school graduation requirement.

04:14:42.720 --> 04:14:47.720
As educators, you're tasked with teaching our children how to learn and think for themselves,

04:14:47.720 --> 04:14:49.720
not guiding them what to think.

04:14:49.720 --> 04:14:54.720
You have no business teaching critical race theory, creating social justice environments in classrooms,

04:14:54.720 --> 04:14:57.720
and using biased, harmful material.

04:14:57.720 --> 04:15:00.720
The State Board of Education touts diversity and inclusion,

04:15:00.720 --> 04:15:03.720
yet is taking a path that fuels racial tension and discrimination,

04:15:03.720 --> 04:15:06.720
further dividing our children and this nation.

04:15:06.720 --> 04:15:11.720
This radical curriculum is inflammatory, traumatizing, indoctrinating, and dangerous.

04:15:11.720 --> 04:15:17.720
You are transforming California schools into factories for far-left-wing political activism

04:15:17.720 --> 04:15:21.720
and not even touching base with the religious aspects of this,

04:15:21.720 --> 04:15:25.720
children chanting to ancient gods, and it's beyond disturbing.

04:15:25.720 --> 04:15:28.720
I urge you all to reject this curriculum and vote no.

04:15:28.720 --> 04:15:29.720
Thank you.

04:15:29.720 --> 04:15:31.720
Thank you, caller.

04:15:31.720 --> 04:15:34.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:15:34.720 --> 04:15:39.720
Your time starts now.

04:15:39.720 --> 04:15:42.720
Just a moment.

04:15:42.720 --> 04:15:44.720
I've been waiting for an hour and a half.

04:15:44.720 --> 04:15:46.720
My name is Colleen Meyer.

04:15:46.720 --> 04:15:48.720
Your time starts now.

04:15:48.720 --> 04:15:49.720
Thank you so much.

04:15:49.720 --> 04:15:52.720
The religious element of the ethnic studies curriculum,

04:15:52.720 --> 04:15:55.720
which with direct appeals to Aztec gods,

04:15:55.720 --> 04:16:00.720
is almost certainly a violation of the First Amendment Establishment Clause.

04:16:00.720 --> 04:16:05.720
Public schools are prohibited from leading state-sanctioned Christian prayers.

04:16:05.720 --> 04:16:09.720
They must similarly be prohibited from leading state-sanctioned camps

04:16:09.720 --> 04:16:12.720
to the Aztec god of human sacrifice.

04:16:12.720 --> 04:16:13.720
My name is Colleen Meyer.

04:16:13.720 --> 04:16:17.720
I am on the board of South Coast Republican Women's Federated.

04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:21.720
I am a product of public schools all the way through UC

04:16:21.720 --> 04:16:25.720
with my bachelor's degree in ethnic studies in the year 2000.

04:16:25.720 --> 04:16:28.720
I support ethnic studies, but not in this form.

04:16:28.720 --> 04:16:31.720
You must remove the chanting to the Aztec gods.

04:16:31.720 --> 04:16:33.720
Thank you for your time.

04:16:33.720 --> 04:16:34.720
Thank you, caller.

04:16:34.720 --> 04:16:37.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:16:37.720 --> 04:16:41.720
Your time starts now.

04:16:41.720 --> 04:16:42.720
Hi.

04:16:42.720 --> 04:16:46.720
My name is Maryam, and I'm a South Asian immigrant student in California.

04:16:46.720 --> 04:16:48.720
Ethnic studies and talk constructively,

04:16:48.720 --> 04:16:50.720
as in the LAUS ethnic studies curriculum,

04:16:50.720 --> 04:16:54.720
can build empathy and understanding while combating racism, which is great.

04:16:54.720 --> 04:16:57.720
And understanding our dark history is important as well.

04:16:57.720 --> 04:17:00.720
But unfortunately, the proposed DSNC is based on critical ethnic studies,

04:17:00.720 --> 04:17:04.720
which pit students against each other by defining them as victims or oppressors

04:17:04.720 --> 04:17:06.720
based on the color of their skin.

04:17:06.720 --> 04:17:09.720
And I've seen firsthand how this ideology divides and tears people apart

04:17:09.720 --> 04:17:12.720
and establishes new hierarchies, no better than before.

04:17:12.720 --> 04:17:15.720
Don't push this version of the curriculum in the name of progress

04:17:15.720 --> 04:17:19.720
when it represents me and my community as victims and as being less than.

04:17:19.720 --> 04:17:22.720
To avoid this, please replace the critical approach

04:17:22.720 --> 04:17:25.720
with a constructive ethnic studies approach.

04:17:25.720 --> 04:17:28.720
And we instate the LAUS curriculum as a resource for users.

04:17:28.720 --> 04:17:31.720
I want ethnic studies curriculum that inspires students

04:17:31.720 --> 04:17:36.720
and doesn't make them feel guilty for things they have no responsibility for.

04:17:37.720 --> 04:17:40.720
Please don't corrupt the valuable teachings of ethnic studies

04:17:40.720 --> 04:17:44.720
and the pride it can give to all people of all colors in their heritage.

04:17:44.720 --> 04:17:46.720
Thank you, caller.

04:17:46.720 --> 04:17:49.720

04:17:56.720 --> 04:17:58.720
Caller, you're live.

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:18:04.720 --> 04:18:06.720
Your time starts now.

04:18:08.720 --> 04:18:09.720
Hi, my name is Remo.

04:18:09.720 --> 04:18:13.720
I'm a recent graduate of UCLA and a member of the Palestinian Youth Movement.

04:18:13.720 --> 04:18:15.720
I'm calling today to urge the board to vote no

04:18:15.720 --> 04:18:18.720
on the watered-down ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:18:18.720 --> 04:18:20.720
As a Palestinian growing up in the California public school system,

04:18:20.720 --> 04:18:23.720
I never learned anything about my ancestral homeland,

04:18:23.720 --> 04:18:26.720
except that the topic was too taboo to touch.

04:18:26.720 --> 04:18:29.720
I never learned anything about the roles that imperialism, capitalism,

04:18:29.720 --> 04:18:32.720
or Islamophobia played in producing the conditions for Palestinians

04:18:32.720 --> 04:18:34.720
around the world today.

04:18:34.720 --> 04:18:37.720
I'm disappointed that the current heavily sanitized iteration of ethnic studies

04:18:37.720 --> 04:18:41.720
does no more justice to the Arab-American students of tomorrow than it did for me,

04:18:41.720 --> 04:18:44.720
and I grew up without ethnic studies.

04:18:44.720 --> 04:18:47.720
We demand an ethnic studies curriculum that is true to the original guiding values

04:18:47.720 --> 04:18:51.720
and principles, which are anti-colonial, anti-racist, and liberatory.

04:18:51.720 --> 04:18:55.720
You must not let yourself be bullied by right-wing, pro-Israel interest groups

04:18:55.720 --> 04:18:58.720
who have poor critical thinking as they have admitted today.

04:18:58.720 --> 04:19:01.720
The curriculum needs to be rewritten to reinclude Arab-American lessons

04:19:01.720 --> 04:19:04.720
including Palestine within Asian-American studies.

04:19:04.720 --> 04:19:07.720
Please do better. Thank you.

04:19:07.720 --> 04:19:09.720
Thank you, caller.

04:19:09.720 --> 04:19:12.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

04:19:15.720 --> 04:19:18.720
Hi. My name is Jeremy Anne, a Filipino-American,

04:19:18.720 --> 04:19:21.720
former preschool teacher and member of Daily City for Black Lives.

04:19:21.720 --> 04:19:23.720
This draft is not ethnic studies.

04:19:23.720 --> 04:19:27.720
I urge the State Board of Education not to pass this version of ESMC.

04:19:27.720 --> 04:19:30.720
This draft does not fully represent an Arab-American lesson plan

04:19:30.720 --> 04:19:35.720
inclusive of Palestine written by Arab-American studies experts and educators.

04:19:35.720 --> 04:19:39.720
This erasure is unacceptable in a document like this.

04:19:39.720 --> 04:19:42.720
I also want to name the inequitable process that this has been,

04:19:42.720 --> 04:19:45.720
having people wait on a call for more than an hour and a half

04:19:45.720 --> 04:19:49.720
for public comment for three plus hours for presentations and your lunches,

04:19:49.720 --> 04:19:51.720
and charging per minute is unacceptable.

04:19:51.720 --> 04:19:53.720
We have jobs people to take care of,

04:19:53.720 --> 04:19:56.720
and it's infuriating that through all this we only have a minute.

04:19:56.720 --> 04:19:58.720
Shame on you.

04:19:58.720 --> 04:20:01.720
We have mass shootings not because Bibles aren't taught in schools.

04:20:01.720 --> 04:20:04.720
It's because white supremacist culture and violence is not enabled,

04:20:04.720 --> 04:20:07.720
but embedded in our system.

04:20:07.720 --> 04:20:09.720
Thank you, caller.

04:20:09.720 --> 04:20:12.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:20:12.720 --> 04:20:16.720
Your time starts now.

04:20:16.720 --> 04:20:18.720
Yes, hi. Hello.

04:20:18.720 --> 04:20:21.720
My name is Asai Asna, and I've been a Black woman my entire life,

04:20:21.720 --> 04:20:24.720
as well as a resident of Santa Clara County.

04:20:24.720 --> 04:20:27.720
Ethnic studies is supposed to be about making space for communities

04:20:27.720 --> 04:20:30.720
whose knowledge has been erased, ignored, and excluded,

04:20:30.720 --> 04:20:34.720
not being some quack ideology that is based on social vengeance

04:20:34.720 --> 04:20:37.720
disguised as social justice.

04:20:37.720 --> 04:20:41.720
It is not okay to pass something that represents my community as victims

04:20:41.720 --> 04:20:43.720
just to say you passed something.

04:20:43.720 --> 04:20:47.720
If you want to prevent representing people of color as lessens,

04:20:47.720 --> 04:20:50.720
then you need to remove the critical ethnic studies approach

04:20:50.720 --> 04:20:53.720
and replace it with a constructive approach.

04:20:53.720 --> 04:20:56.720
Our children, students, and community members deserve to have

04:20:56.720 --> 04:20:59.720
California's leaders stand up against this left-wing politicization

04:20:59.720 --> 04:21:02.720
of education.

04:21:02.720 --> 04:21:05.720
Under the current ESMC curriculum, racism is being normalized

04:21:05.720 --> 04:21:08.720
and our children are being indoctrinated.

04:21:08.720 --> 04:21:11.720
We're supposed to be making progress, not a return to the pre-civil rights era.

04:21:11.720 --> 04:21:14.720
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies lens

04:21:14.720 --> 04:21:17.720
before approving the ESMC. Thank you.

04:21:17.720 --> 04:21:20.720
Thank you, caller.

04:21:20.720 --> 04:21:23.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:21:23.720 --> 04:21:26.720
Your time starts now.

04:21:26.720 --> 04:21:29.720
Hello. My name is Rosa Kim.

04:21:29.720 --> 04:21:32.720
I'm a Korean-American educator and also a school board member

04:21:32.720 --> 04:21:35.720
for the Freeman Union High School District.

04:21:35.720 --> 04:21:38.720
We've seen an alarming increase in anti-Asian violence

04:21:38.720 --> 04:21:41.720
and xenophobia for the past year.

04:21:41.720 --> 04:21:44.720
I believe that one solution to eradicating violence against

04:21:44.720 --> 04:21:47.720
Asian Americans and other peoples of color

04:21:47.720 --> 04:21:50.720
is through comprehensive ethnic studies curriculum.

04:21:50.720 --> 04:21:53.720
It is critical that the State Board of Education approve

04:21:53.720 --> 04:21:56.720
the ESMC today so that more districts can implement

04:21:56.720 --> 04:21:59.720
ethnic studies locally.

04:21:59.720 --> 04:22:02.720
The more our students understand about marginalized groups,

04:22:02.720 --> 04:22:05.720
the more inclusive our community will be.

04:22:05.720 --> 04:22:08.720
Now is the time to empower our students

04:22:08.720 --> 04:22:11.720
by giving them the tools they need to build connection

04:22:11.720 --> 04:22:14.720
with our diverse community. Thank you.

04:22:14.720 --> 04:22:17.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name

04:22:17.720 --> 04:22:20.720
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:22:26.720 --> 04:22:29.720
Caller, you're live.

04:22:29.720 --> 04:22:32.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

04:22:32.720 --> 04:22:35.720
for the record. Your time starts now.

04:22:39.720 --> 04:22:42.720
Oh, hi. This is Jill Silverman,

04:22:42.720 --> 04:22:45.720
a San Francisco parent of two.

04:22:45.720 --> 04:22:48.720
While I strongly support ethnic studies, the current critical

04:22:48.720 --> 04:22:51.720
ethnic studies approach harms the model curriculum, forcing

04:22:51.720 --> 04:22:54.720
a narrow ideological agenda and predetermined answers

04:22:54.720 --> 04:22:57.720
rather than fostering student inquiry.

04:22:57.720 --> 04:23:00.720
Please replace the critical ethnic studies lens currently

04:23:00.720 --> 04:23:03.720
in the guiding values and principles and the subsequent

04:23:03.720 --> 04:23:06.720
chapters of the model curriculum and replace it with a balanced

04:23:06.720 --> 04:23:09.720
model curriculum.

04:23:09.720 --> 04:23:12.720
To be very clear, a constructive approach would include

04:23:12.720 --> 04:23:15.720
the inspirational stories of heroes like Fred Korematsu.

04:23:15.720 --> 04:23:18.720
It would promote racial justice and fight all forms of hatred.

04:23:18.720 --> 04:23:21.720
It would include the many brilliant contributions of Black,

04:23:21.720 --> 04:23:24.720
Asians, Latinx, and Native Americans.

04:23:24.720 --> 04:23:27.720
It would do this without setting students against one another.

04:23:27.720 --> 04:23:30.720
It would do this without promoting violence for one political

04:23:30.720 --> 04:23:33.720
viewpoint. Please revise and remove the critical

04:23:33.720 --> 04:23:36.720
ethnic studies lens from the model curriculum.

04:23:36.720 --> 04:23:39.720
Thank you so much for your consideration.

04:23:39.720 --> 04:23:42.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name

04:23:42.720 --> 04:23:45.720
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:23:48.720 --> 04:23:51.720
Hello?

04:23:51.720 --> 04:23:54.720
Yes, caller. You're live.

04:23:54.720 --> 04:23:57.720
It's David Mullins calling. I'm a resident of California.

04:23:57.720 --> 04:24:00.720
And I would want to ask why would California's

04:24:00.720 --> 04:24:03.720
government choose to replicate the same bias

04:24:03.720 --> 04:24:06.720
that marginalized groups have been subjected to

04:24:06.720 --> 04:24:09.720
for over 200 years in California?

04:24:09.720 --> 04:24:12.720
Redirecting hatred will not make that hatred go away.

04:24:12.720 --> 04:24:15.720
And the people who are calling in,

04:24:15.720 --> 04:24:18.720
whether they are pro-Arab or pro-Jewish

04:24:18.720 --> 04:24:21.720
or pro-Armenian, almost all of them

04:24:21.720 --> 04:24:24.720
are telling you the exact same thing.

04:24:24.720 --> 04:24:27.720
Do not adopt this version

04:24:27.720 --> 04:24:30.720
of the ethnic studies program.

04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:33.720
Last but not least, the only beneficiary

04:24:33.720 --> 04:24:36.720
of the current critical ethnic studies program

04:24:36.720 --> 04:24:39.720
will be the charter schools in California.

04:24:39.720 --> 04:24:42.720
And it's hard to understand why California's Department of Education

04:24:42.720 --> 04:24:45.720
would want to adopt a program

04:24:45.720 --> 04:24:48.720
that will further weaken California's

04:24:48.720 --> 04:24:51.720
public school system. Thank you.

04:24:51.720 --> 04:24:54.720
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name

04:24:54.720 --> 04:24:57.720
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:25:00.720 --> 04:25:03.720
My name is Lori Meyers, and I'm a California teacher.

04:25:03.720 --> 04:25:06.720
I agree with Shemeen Coates that we need to end hate,

04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:09.720
Karen Korematsu about teaching respect,

04:25:09.720 --> 04:25:12.720
and Dr. Asante that we should see people as human beings

04:25:12.720 --> 04:25:15.720
with no racial ladder. But this won't happen when the ESMC

04:25:15.720 --> 04:25:18.720
is based on critical race theory as a key framework in pedagogy.

04:25:18.720 --> 04:25:21.720
The ESMC does not present critical race theory

04:25:21.720 --> 04:25:24.720
as one tool to examine race. It's presented as the only tool.

04:25:24.720 --> 04:25:27.720
Listen to the originator of critical race theory,

04:25:27.720 --> 04:25:30.720
Garrett Bell, who says that whites continue,

04:25:30.720 --> 04:25:33.720
consciously or unconsciously, to do all in their power

04:25:33.720 --> 04:25:36.720
to ensure their dominion and maintain their control.

04:25:36.720 --> 04:25:39.720
Will this pedagogy end hate and teach respect?

04:25:39.720 --> 04:25:42.720
Does this pedagogy see people as humans with no racial ladder?

04:25:42.720 --> 04:25:45.720
No. As we see in real classrooms and more and more lawsuits,

04:25:45.720 --> 04:25:48.720
this pedagogy causes division and discrimination.

04:25:48.720 --> 04:25:51.720
Trustees, please review the HSS framework

04:25:51.720 --> 04:25:54.720
that says ethnic studies must help students

04:25:54.720 --> 04:25:57.720
to respect cultural diversity and see the advantages

04:25:57.720 --> 04:26:00.720
of inclusion, and then remove critical race theory

04:26:00.720 --> 04:26:03.720
as a key pedagogy from the ESMC.

04:26:03.720 --> 04:26:06.720
Our students and ethnic studies deserve better than this.

04:26:06.720 --> 04:26:09.720
Thank you.

04:26:09.720 --> 04:26:12.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:26:12.720 --> 04:26:15.720
Your time starts now.

04:26:15.720 --> 04:26:18.720
Hello. My name is Angela DeRamos,

04:26:18.720 --> 04:26:21.720
and I am representing the California Teachers Association.

04:26:21.720 --> 04:26:24.720
CPH strongly supports ethnic studies,

04:26:24.720 --> 04:26:27.720
but we have concerns with the document

04:26:27.720 --> 04:26:30.720
that's in front of the board today.

04:26:30.720 --> 04:26:33.720
The model curriculum needs to be one that teachers can use

04:26:33.720 --> 04:26:36.720
meaningfully, intentionally, and effectively.

04:26:36.720 --> 04:26:39.720
Our practitioners are concerned that there's insufficient guidance

04:26:39.720 --> 04:26:42.720
for educators to develop an ethnic studies curriculum,

04:26:42.720 --> 04:26:45.720
especially if they've never taught an ethnic studies course before.

04:26:45.720 --> 04:26:48.720
There are still many gaps in the document,

04:26:48.720 --> 04:26:51.720
including dilution of content,

04:26:51.720 --> 04:26:54.720
limited portrayals of events in history,

04:26:54.720 --> 04:26:57.720
inequitable representation of the four ethnic groups,

04:26:57.720 --> 04:27:00.720
and a lack of coherence for a TK through 12 curriculum.

04:27:00.720 --> 04:27:03.720
Based on the concerns outlined in our letter,

04:27:03.720 --> 04:27:06.720
TK is unable to support the approval

04:27:06.720 --> 04:27:09.720
of the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:27:09.720 --> 04:27:12.720
Thank you for your attention and your diligence to this.

04:27:12.720 --> 04:27:15.720
Thank you, caller.

04:27:15.720 --> 04:27:18.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:27:18.720 --> 04:27:21.720
Your time starts now.

04:27:21.720 --> 04:27:24.720
My name is Max.

04:27:24.720 --> 04:27:27.720
I'm an educator from Los Angeles.

04:27:27.720 --> 04:27:30.720
The ESMC covers the origin story of ethnic studies,

04:27:30.720 --> 04:27:33.720
the Third World Liberation Front, or TWLF.

04:27:33.720 --> 04:27:36.720
That movement fought for a just cause, including communities of color

04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:39.720
that are on the other side of the story the ESMC doesn't cover.

04:27:39.720 --> 04:27:42.720
The leadership of TWLF promoted anti-Semitism.

04:27:42.720 --> 04:27:45.720
They celebrated dictators like Mal and Lenin,

04:27:45.720 --> 04:27:48.720
whose actions killed tens of millions of people

04:27:48.720 --> 04:27:51.720
and led many more to flee to this country.

04:27:51.720 --> 04:27:54.720
My own family suffered for decades under the anti-Semitism of the Soviet Union,

04:27:54.720 --> 04:27:57.720
the regime that Lenin created.

04:27:57.720 --> 04:28:00.720
ESMC should not be blind to the story of my family

04:28:00.720 --> 04:28:03.720
and so many other Americans who suffered under similar regimes.

04:28:04.720 --> 04:28:07.720
Wherever the ESMC discusses TWLF,

04:28:07.720 --> 04:28:10.720
make sure to cover not only its contributions,

04:28:10.720 --> 04:28:13.720
but also its very real flaws.

04:28:13.720 --> 04:28:16.720
Movements can often do, have good ideas about some issues

04:28:16.720 --> 04:28:19.720
and bad ideas about others.

04:28:19.720 --> 04:28:22.720
Students deserve to learn about that complex reality.

04:28:22.720 --> 04:28:25.720
Thank you, caller.

04:28:25.720 --> 04:28:28.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:28:28.720 --> 04:28:31.720
Your time starts now.

04:28:31.720 --> 04:28:34.720
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:28:34.720 --> 04:28:37.720
Your time starts now.

04:28:37.720 --> 04:28:40.720
Hello, my name is David Roome.

04:28:40.720 --> 04:28:43.720
I'm a father of three girls from Irvine.

04:28:43.720 --> 04:28:46.720
And while I pre-shallow the work to revise the ESMC,

04:28:46.720 --> 04:28:49.720
I urge you to make further changes and resist pressure

04:28:49.720 --> 04:28:52.720
to make the curriculum worse.

04:28:52.720 --> 04:28:55.720
Please include the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism

04:28:55.720 --> 04:28:58.720
and reject the pressure to remove it.

04:28:58.720 --> 04:29:01.720
It does not prevent criticism of Israel.

04:29:01.720 --> 04:29:04.720
It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel

04:29:04.720 --> 04:29:07.720
harms Jews in California.

04:29:07.720 --> 04:29:10.720
Second, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in Chapter 1

04:29:10.720 --> 04:29:13.720
and repeat them throughout the curriculum just like the language

04:29:13.720 --> 04:29:16.720
about values and outcomes.

04:29:16.720 --> 04:29:19.720
Lastly, please do not retract line edit number 100.

04:29:19.720 --> 04:29:22.720
And one more thing,

04:29:22.720 --> 04:29:25.720
each group of people needs to be able to tell our own story.

04:29:26.720 --> 04:29:29.720
Please make the changes requested by Jimena

04:29:29.720 --> 04:29:32.720
and include the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism.

04:29:32.720 --> 04:29:35.720
Last, if we characterize people as oppressors

04:29:35.720 --> 04:29:38.720
and vilify them that way,

04:29:38.720 --> 04:29:41.720
it lays the foundation in children's minds for hate.

04:29:41.720 --> 04:29:44.720
And that can lead to tragedies like the Holocaust.

04:29:44.720 --> 04:29:47.720
Next caller, please state your name

04:29:47.720 --> 04:29:50.720
and affiliation for the record.

04:29:50.720 --> 04:29:53.720
Your time starts now.

04:29:53.720 --> 04:29:56.720
Hello, can you hear me?

04:29:56.720 --> 04:29:59.720
Yes, please proceed.

04:29:59.720 --> 04:30:02.720
Hi, my name is Arshia Mousti.

04:30:02.720 --> 04:30:05.720
I am an educator and family,

04:30:05.720 --> 04:30:08.720
extended family in California.

04:30:08.720 --> 04:30:11.720
I'm here to support the API School Board Members Association's

04:30:11.720 --> 04:30:14.720
position that the SBA approved

04:30:14.720 --> 04:30:17.720
the ESMC today.

04:30:17.720 --> 04:30:20.720
While we understand that it is not perfect,

04:30:20.720 --> 04:30:23.720
we also know that history is living

04:30:23.720 --> 04:30:26.720
and there will be opportunities to incorporate changes

04:30:26.720 --> 04:30:29.720
when implementing locally.

04:30:29.720 --> 04:30:32.720
The API community consists of

04:30:32.720 --> 04:30:35.720
about 50 essay groups

04:30:35.720 --> 04:30:38.720
with over 100 languages.

04:30:38.720 --> 04:30:41.720
Thus, the breadth of sample lessons in the

04:30:41.720 --> 04:30:44.720
API section of Chapter 4 is critical

04:30:44.720 --> 04:30:47.720
for the relevance of ESMC

04:30:47.720 --> 04:30:50.720
in local communities.

04:30:50.720 --> 04:30:53.720
With the rise in anti-Asian violence and xenophobia,

04:30:53.720 --> 04:30:56.720
now is the time to say yes

04:30:56.720 --> 04:30:59.720
to enabling our tools to build bridges

04:30:59.720 --> 04:31:02.720
and connections.

04:31:02.720 --> 04:31:05.720
Thank you, caller.

04:31:05.720 --> 04:31:08.720

My name is Charles Tovman,

04:31:29.720 --> 04:31:32.720
and I am a California grandparent and voter.

04:31:32.720 --> 04:31:35.720
Please remove the critical ethnic studies lens

04:31:35.720 --> 04:31:38.720
from the Guiding Values and Principles

04:31:38.720 --> 04:31:44.560
values and principles and the subsequent chapters of the ESMC, replacing it with

04:31:44.560 --> 04:31:50.080
a balanced, constructive approach. We have two choices. We can divide and tear

04:31:50.080 --> 04:31:55.680
down, or we can unify and build up. We can use critical ethnic studies and

04:31:55.680 --> 04:32:00.080
define each other as victims or oppressors, or we can apply constructive

04:32:00.080 --> 04:32:05.160
ethnic studies and highlight role models from the core ethnic groups, inspiring

04:32:05.160 --> 04:32:11.000
students, and fostering pride in their heritage. Let's educate, not indoctrinate.

04:32:11.000 --> 04:32:16.280
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies lens before

04:32:16.280 --> 04:32:21.760
approving the ESMC. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your

04:32:21.760 --> 04:32:26.760
name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:32:26.760 --> 04:32:32.280
Hi, my name is Aaron Reed and I am the government and legislative affairs manager for Care

04:32:32.280 --> 04:32:36.840
California, the largest Muslim advocacy organization in the nation, and I'm

04:32:36.840 --> 04:32:41.480
calling to urgently request that the State Board of Education not approve

04:32:41.480 --> 04:32:48.120
this version of the ethnic studies model curriculum. The reality is that this is

04:32:48.120 --> 04:32:52.640
simply not an ethnic studies curriculum, and that has been illustrated by the

04:32:52.640 --> 04:32:55.640
ethnic studies experts who the California Department of Education have

04:32:55.640 --> 04:33:00.200
brought together and initially asked to create this draft, who later then

04:33:00.200 --> 04:33:05.480
requested that their names be removed and continue to have that request. Since

04:33:05.480 --> 04:33:09.000
this is not ethnic studies and since it goes out of its way to exclude folks like

04:33:09.000 --> 04:33:12.400
Palestinian Americans who make up one of the larger populations of Arab

04:33:12.400 --> 04:33:16.080
Americans in California, it doesn't actually meet its mandate or its

04:33:16.080 --> 04:33:19.640
intentions that have been illustrated earlier during the speeches previous, and

04:33:19.640 --> 04:33:23.040
so it's for those reasons, outside of the many others that have been illustrated by

04:33:23.040 --> 04:33:28.000
my various colleagues here today, that you do not pass this forward as it simply

04:33:28.000 --> 04:33:32.020
excludes folks and doesn't meet its mandate and is not ethnic studies as

04:33:32.020 --> 04:33:36.000
illustrated by the very experts. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

04:33:36.000 --> 04:33:43.200
record. Your time starts now. My name is Joe Berra with the Promise Institute for

04:33:43.200 --> 04:33:47.400
Human Rights at UCLA School of Law. I work with local land-based tribes in the

04:33:47.400 --> 04:33:51.760
large Native American and indigenous population of LA. California Assembly

04:33:51.760 --> 04:33:55.320
Joint Resolution 42 endorsed the principles of the United Nations

04:33:55.320 --> 04:33:59.280
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This board must embrace those

04:33:59.280 --> 04:34:03.160
principles, including the free, prior, and informed consent of Native American

04:34:03.160 --> 04:34:06.920
and indigenous peoples. Many Native people I work with have critiqued the

04:34:06.920 --> 04:34:10.400
lack of tribal consultation in this process, and I endorsed the new

04:34:10.400 --> 04:34:15.200
provision explicitly mandating tribal consultation. The current ESMC has

04:34:15.200 --> 04:34:18.360
succumbed to pressure to eliminate a Native perspective in the model

04:34:18.360 --> 04:34:22.560
curriculum, which is troubling and harmful to Native peoples. If the board

04:34:22.560 --> 04:34:26.520
moves forward, at a minimum it must adopt recommendations put forward by

04:34:26.520 --> 04:34:29.720
the Native community, such as the inclusion of a complete list of

04:34:29.720 --> 04:34:33.760
California tribes, amendments to the references to the model curriculum on

04:34:33.760 --> 04:34:37.520
human rights and genocide, and inclusion of a full lesson given the historical

04:34:37.520 --> 04:34:41.560
context to the Native American genocide. This would begin full incorporation of

04:34:41.560 --> 04:34:45.480
the Native perspective through tribal consultation prior to any implementation.

04:34:45.480 --> 04:34:49.960
To do less would advocate this body. Next caller, please state your name and

04:34:49.960 --> 04:34:54.800
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:34:58.800 --> 04:35:08.760
Yes, caller, you're live. I'm Warren Smith, Santa Rosa, can you hear me? Yes, please proceed.

04:35:08.760 --> 04:35:15.360
Okay, the resistance to openness in the projected ethnic study curriculum as

04:35:15.360 --> 04:35:21.080
evidenced by the government's initial veto highlights the one-sided resistance

04:35:21.080 --> 04:35:26.920
by the pro-Dionist camp. The plea for Holocaust observance and the dangers of

04:35:26.920 --> 04:35:32.560
anti-Semitism cannot be isolated from the actual history of the creation of

04:35:32.560 --> 04:35:37.280
Israel. Ethnic studies should weigh the celebration of Israel's Independence

04:35:37.280 --> 04:35:43.080
Day against the Palestinian NAFTA. It should include the preceding events of

04:35:43.080 --> 04:35:49.960
the 1800s to 20th century, highlighting Western intervention in the Middle East, the beginnings of the

04:35:49.960 --> 04:35:59.960
Zionist movement, and full exposure of the Arab nations in subsequent UN decisions to lead Israel's creation. Thank you.

Caller, you're live. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:36:20.320 --> 04:36:28.400
Your time starts now. My name is Dr. Sinau Sinatovo, a product of the

04:36:28.400 --> 04:36:33.120
California public school system from grade K all the way to 20, and I am an

04:36:33.160 --> 04:36:38.040
educator right now at the College of San Mateo. As an educator in the field of

04:36:38.040 --> 04:36:42.680
Pacific Islander studies, I urge the State Board of Education not to pass

04:36:42.680 --> 04:36:47.520
this version of ESMC. This is not about appeasing the we cannot add everyone

04:36:47.520 --> 04:36:51.400
right now or this is the beginning and this draft. This is about addressing the

04:36:51.400 --> 04:36:56.520
deliberate watering down of the ESMC. This current draft does not align with

04:36:56.520 --> 04:37:00.320
all components of original ethnic studies concepts and principles which

04:37:00.320 --> 04:37:03.560
are founded in naming and critiquing structures of oppression such as

04:37:03.560 --> 04:37:08.600
capitalism and white supremacy. This draft does not fully represent an Arab

04:37:08.600 --> 04:37:13.480
American lesson plan inclusive of Palestine written by Arab American

04:37:13.480 --> 04:37:17.600
studies expert and educators. This erasure is unacceptable in a document

04:37:17.600 --> 04:37:21.840
like this. In this current state, this ESMC document is not ready to serve

04:37:21.840 --> 04:37:26.400
teachers in teaching a full ethnic studies curriculum. I therefore urge the

04:37:26.400 --> 04:37:32.640
State Board of Education to not pass. Thank you, Paula. Please state your name

04:37:32.640 --> 04:37:35.600

04:37:42.200 --> 04:37:46.080
Asian and Korean Americans in California. As a Korean American, ethnic

04:37:46.080 --> 04:37:50.040
studies is very important only if it's taught without political propaganda and

04:37:50.040 --> 04:37:55.240
without provoking students. The critical ethnic studies must be revised further

04:37:55.240 --> 04:37:59.240
because it still forces a narrow ideological agenda and predetermined

04:37:59.240 --> 04:38:03.800
answers rather than fostering students inquiry. Multiculturalism is not ethnic

04:38:03.800 --> 04:38:08.360
study. Teaching to honor Aztec God and human sacrifices are certainly not ethnic

04:38:08.360 --> 04:38:12.280
study. So please remove the critical ethnic study lenses from the guiding

04:38:12.280 --> 04:38:17.280
values of principles and the subsequent chapters of the ESMC replacing it with

04:38:17.280 --> 04:38:21.200
the balanced constructive approach. I'd like to see an ethnic studies curriculum

04:38:21.200 --> 04:38:25.960
that inspires students, not evoke feelings of guilt or helplessness or anger

04:38:25.960 --> 04:38:31.880
toward each other. The ESMC should foster inquiry, not indoctrinate, fight

04:38:31.880 --> 04:38:36.720
racism, not define people by the skin color, unite and inspire students, not

04:38:36.720 --> 04:38:41.200
divide them, and should never evoke guilt, anger, and helplessness. Thank you, Paula.

04:38:41.200 --> 04:38:45.680
Please revise and remove the critical ethnic studies. Next, Paula, please state your name and

04:38:45.680 --> 04:38:48.560
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:38:52.200 --> 04:38:54.200

04:39:03.200 --> 04:39:09.200
Hi, this is Angie Fah. I've got a PhD in ethnic studies. I'm a former school board member.

04:39:09.200 --> 04:39:14.200
We need to be clear to school districts across California that ethnic studies

04:39:14.200 --> 04:39:19.200
acknowledges differences by race and the experience of Native American, African

04:39:19.200 --> 04:39:24.200
American, Asian Pacific American, and Latin American communities, the four core

04:39:24.200 --> 04:39:29.200
groups. When students have school lessons that acknowledge racial differences that

04:39:29.200 --> 04:39:34.200
they have experienced, it has a profoundly positive impact on increasing student

04:39:34.200 --> 04:39:39.200
success. The staff edits that say that Jewish American studies is part of

04:39:39.200 --> 04:39:44.200
Asian American studies is not fair to either Jewish American studies or

04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:50.200
Asian American studies. The lesson plans that are not about groups dealing with

04:39:50.200 --> 04:39:56.200
racial differences belong somewhere else in the California curriculum. The Fox News

04:39:56.200 --> 04:40:02.200
article does not belong as part of the ethnic studies curriculum. Thank you so much

04:40:02.200 --> 04:40:08.200
for all your valuable work and making sure that the four core groups are the central

04:40:08.200 --> 04:40:13.200
piece of ethnic studies. Thank you. Thank you, Paula. Next caller, please state your

04:40:13.200 --> 04:40:17.200

04:40:43.200 --> 04:40:49.840
My name is Victoria, I'm a former teacher from Columbia who moved to California as a young adult.

04:40:49.840 --> 04:40:56.000
Approving this narrow ideological agenda because it is a starting point is wrong.

04:40:56.000 --> 04:40:59.920
The pushback is not against ethnic studies per se.

04:40:59.920 --> 04:41:04.800
The pushback is against the critical ethnic studies approach being used,

04:41:04.800 --> 04:41:09.040
especially since there is another more positive approach.

04:41:09.200 --> 04:41:14.720
I ask that you remove the critical ethnic studies lens from the guiding values and principles

04:41:14.720 --> 04:41:21.360
and the subsequent chapters of the ESMC replacing it with a balanced constructive approach.

04:41:21.360 --> 04:41:24.480
We should not leave the nation in teaching violence.

04:41:25.360 --> 04:41:31.200
We have given copious feedback to all drafts regarding the critical ethnic studies approach

04:41:31.200 --> 04:41:33.040
which has gone unheeded.

04:41:33.040 --> 04:41:37.840
A critical ethnic studies approach narrows the focus of ethnic studies to the victim

04:41:37.840 --> 04:41:43.120
oppressor narrative while ignoring essential contributions of the core ethnic groups,

04:41:43.120 --> 04:41:47.760
both political and non-political, that would inspire students and foster...

04:41:47.760 --> 04:41:49.680

Hi.

04:42:12.720 --> 04:42:13.760
Yes, you're live.

04:42:13.760 --> 04:42:14.480
Please proceed.

04:42:15.520 --> 04:42:16.560
Is that me?

04:42:16.560 --> 04:42:17.280
Yes, it's you.

04:42:18.240 --> 04:42:19.360
Okay, great.

04:42:19.360 --> 04:42:21.360
Hi, my name is Marge Sussman.

04:42:21.360 --> 04:42:26.560
I'm a member of Jewish Voice for Peace and I'm here to urge you to vote no on this version

04:42:26.560 --> 04:42:29.200
of the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:42:29.200 --> 04:42:31.440
It is not ethnic studies.

04:42:31.440 --> 04:42:35.280
One of ethnic studies core values is decolonization.

04:42:35.280 --> 04:42:39.840
This calls for teaching about the role of colonial conquest in the U.S.

04:42:39.840 --> 04:42:46.320
and in other parts of the world and how that's impacted indigenous people previously enslaved

04:42:46.320 --> 04:42:49.120
Africans and later immigrants to the U.S.

04:42:49.760 --> 04:42:55.920
Every Arab country has been affected by European colonialism as well as by harmful U.S.

04:42:55.920 --> 04:42:56.880
policies.

04:42:56.880 --> 04:43:02.560
This is why Arab American studies, including Palestine, belongs in the ethnic studies

04:43:02.640 --> 04:43:05.520
curriculum within Asian American studies.

04:43:05.520 --> 04:43:12.160
As a U.S.-born white Jew, I don't support Jewish American studies within ethnic studies

04:43:12.160 --> 04:43:17.840
and can't even imagine how the people who created this current curriculum rationalize

04:43:17.840 --> 04:43:21.680
including Jewish American studies within Asian American studies.

04:43:22.400 --> 04:43:23.840
The IHRA-

04:43:23.840 --> 04:43:24.720
Thank you, caller.

04:43:25.280 --> 04:43:26.160
Your time's up.

04:43:26.960 --> 04:43:30.240
Next, caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:43:30.240 --> 04:43:31.600
Your time starts now.

04:43:32.560 --> 04:43:38.320
My name is Claire Diane and I've worked as a specialist in education for more than 12

04:43:38.320 --> 04:43:39.920
years and I'm a mother.

04:43:39.920 --> 04:43:44.080
My ancestors have been in the Middle East in between expulsions and slavery for over

04:43:44.080 --> 04:43:45.600
50 generations.

04:43:45.600 --> 04:43:50.800
My family came to this country to flee persecution only to be met with the murder of my great

04:43:50.800 --> 04:43:53.040
grandfather in a hate crime.

04:43:53.040 --> 04:43:58.000
Since then in California, my children and myself have experienced anti-Semitism directly

04:43:58.000 --> 04:44:00.720
and via social media, causing great harm.

04:44:00.800 --> 04:44:06.240
California's hate crimes toward Jews stand at about 68% of all religious-based hate,

04:44:06.240 --> 04:44:10.320
so it would make sense to include anti-Semitism in Jews under the core groups.

04:44:10.320 --> 04:44:16.160
I encourage you to reinstate the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism into Jimena's lesson plan.

04:44:16.160 --> 04:44:19.840
I'm not interested in erasing Arab Americans from the ESMC.

04:44:19.840 --> 04:44:22.080
I'm not interested in erasing anybody.

04:44:22.800 --> 04:44:26.400
Now there's a second lesson plan for the Arab community most currently.

04:44:26.400 --> 04:44:31.440
Have you noticed how many folks have spoken to exclude anti-Semitism in Jews?

04:44:31.440 --> 04:44:37.280
This is exactly a reason why anti-Semitism and Jews must be included.

04:44:37.280 --> 04:44:38.480
Hate is hate.

04:44:38.480 --> 04:44:41.360
Hate is our common and education.

Hello, my name is Sarah Levin and I'm the executive director of Jimena.

04:44:54.320 --> 04:44:59.840
Jimena exists to protect the heritage and the rights of the one million Mizrahi Jewish refugees

04:44:59.840 --> 04:45:04.960
from the Middle East and North Africa and their descendants, 200,000 of whom live here in California.

04:45:05.520 --> 04:45:10.320
Given that Middle Eastern Jewish communities comprise one of the largest southwestern Asian

04:45:10.320 --> 04:45:15.360
communities in California and continue to be targets of rising anti-Semitism,

04:45:15.360 --> 04:45:19.440
it is perplexing that Islamophobia is defined and addressed throughout the

04:45:19.440 --> 04:45:24.320
Asian-American study section of the curriculum, but anti-Semitism is not.

04:45:24.320 --> 04:45:28.640
Along with 15,000 members of the Jewish community, I request that the lesson plan

04:45:28.640 --> 04:45:33.280
anti-Semitism and Jewish Middle Eastern Americans be moved to the Asian-American

04:45:33.280 --> 04:45:35.120
study section of the curriculum.

04:45:35.120 --> 04:45:39.760
I implore the state board to treat our Jewish communities equally to other communities from

04:45:39.760 --> 04:45:41.120
southwest Asia.

04:45:41.120 --> 04:45:46.640
It is in this vein that I am asking you not to retract line edit 100 from slide

04:45:46.640 --> 04:45:48.880
55 that was presented to you today.

04:45:48.880 --> 04:45:49.360
Thank you.

04:45:52.880 --> 04:45:54.080
Thank you, caller.

04:46:02.800 --> 04:46:08.160
Hello, my name is Christian Shin and I am a Korean American college student in California

04:46:08.160 --> 04:46:10.880
and a product of the California public school system.

04:46:11.600 --> 04:46:17.920
We have seen an alarm increase of anti-Asian violence and xenophobia because, as Asian

04:46:17.920 --> 04:46:21.040
Americans, we are viewed as perpetual foreigners.

04:46:21.040 --> 04:46:26.080
A solution to eradicating violence against Asian Americans and other people of color

04:46:26.080 --> 04:46:28.720
is through comprehensive ethnic studies.

04:46:28.720 --> 04:46:33.520
The AAPI curriculum provides the knowledge for students to begin to understand our

04:46:33.520 --> 04:46:39.120
diverse AAPI community and our contributions to the fabric of this nation.

04:46:39.120 --> 04:46:44.000
It is critical that the state board of education move forward with the AAPI school

04:46:44.000 --> 04:46:50.800
board members association's position to approve the ESMC today so that more districts

04:46:50.800 --> 04:46:53.200
can implement ethnic studies locally.

04:46:53.200 --> 04:46:58.000
Let's use this opportunity to empower our students by giving the tools they need to

04:46:58.000 --> 04:47:01.760
build connections and be a catalyst for inclusion and social justice.

04:47:02.960 --> 04:47:04.240

Hello.

04:47:12.160 --> 04:47:16.000
My name is Jamal Kanj, a parent from San Diego.

04:47:17.440 --> 04:47:24.880
From my experience, systematic racism is the result of cultural dehumanization

04:47:25.600 --> 04:47:27.360
and programmed ignorance.

04:47:27.360 --> 04:47:33.680
By approving a model curriculum, Persian the Arab lessons plan, including Palestine,

04:47:33.680 --> 04:47:40.240
the board unwittingly perpetuates the anti-Arab Islamophobia and ignorance.

04:47:40.240 --> 04:47:47.600
Why a parochial special interest groups targeted the removal of a plan prepared by bona fide

04:47:47.600 --> 04:47:52.240
educators from the ESMC draft.

04:47:52.240 --> 04:47:58.240
The powerful and will connected must not define educational priorities for our children.

04:47:58.880 --> 04:48:04.720
Formalizing the marginalization of the Arab American story would indulge our sons and

04:48:04.720 --> 04:48:12.160
daughters knowingly or unknowingly in the bigotry that breeds Islamophobia and anti-Semitism.

04:48:12.160 --> 04:48:14.400
I urge the board not to promote.

04:48:15.040 --> 04:48:16.000
Thank you, caller.

04:48:16.000 --> 04:48:16.880

Hi, this is John Windham, a California parent.

04:48:30.800 --> 04:48:35.120
The critical ethnic studies approach has essentially corrupted this curriculum.

04:48:35.120 --> 04:48:40.240
It forces preset answers rather than having students research and think for themselves.

04:48:40.880 --> 04:48:45.440
And it picks certain narratives to highlight while ignoring those that don't match its

04:48:45.440 --> 04:48:46.960
predetermined conclusions.

04:48:47.760 --> 04:48:52.640
The critical ethnic studies approach should be removed from the guiding values and principles

04:48:52.720 --> 04:48:54.320
and from the balance of the curriculum.

04:48:55.280 --> 04:48:59.840
Students should be exposed to multiple perspectives taught to think critically and form their

04:48:59.840 --> 04:49:03.200
own opinions based on the diversity of facts and opinions.

04:49:03.920 --> 04:49:09.520
Please ensure a more constructive and balanced approach to ethnic studies in California public

04:49:09.520 --> 04:49:10.480
schools.

04:49:10.480 --> 04:49:15.760
Leave the critical approach to college electives rather than forcing it onto our high school

04:49:15.760 --> 04:49:16.480
students.

04:49:16.480 --> 04:49:16.880
Thank you.

04:49:17.680 --> 04:49:18.160

04:49:42.240 --> 04:49:43.600
Yes, please go ahead.

04:49:43.600 --> 04:49:44.640
Hi, great.

04:49:44.640 --> 04:49:45.600
Hi, I'm Dara.

04:49:45.600 --> 04:49:47.680
I am a California resident.

04:49:47.760 --> 04:49:49.760
I am a mother-to-be.

04:49:49.760 --> 04:49:57.040
I am a wife of an Israeli immigrant who comes from Mizrahi heritage, which is of Yemen.

04:49:57.040 --> 04:50:02.880
I'm also a daughter and a sister, and I am my own person.

04:50:02.880 --> 04:50:10.080
I came through K through 12 in public school in California in the Bay Area, and I have

04:50:10.080 --> 04:50:16.640
always wanted to send my children to public school as I find the diversity to be very

04:50:16.640 --> 04:50:20.320
enriching and very important for a child's education.

04:50:20.320 --> 04:50:25.680
Unfortunately, if anti-Semitism is present in our public schools, I'm afraid I will have

04:50:25.680 --> 04:50:30.160
to take a second job to shield my children from what could be very dangerous.

04:50:30.160 --> 04:50:38.960
I'm hearing on this call talks of Zionism and pro-whiteness of these pro-Israel groups,

04:50:38.960 --> 04:50:42.000
which is so offensive given the Jewish experience.

04:50:42.720 --> 04:50:44.480
This draft of the EMC thinks...

04:50:44.480 --> 04:50:45.280
Thank you, caller.

Yes, you're live.

04:50:59.440 --> 04:51:00.320
Please go ahead.

04:51:00.320 --> 04:51:04.880
Hi, my name is Natalie R. Batman, and I'm a junior at Mountain View High School here

04:51:04.880 --> 04:51:05.840
in the Bay Area.

04:51:05.840 --> 04:51:10.000
I'm a daughter of Soviet Jews, and I spent my whole childhood hearing stories from my

04:51:10.000 --> 04:51:14.800
parents about the rampant anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, anti-Semitism that was no

04:51:14.800 --> 04:51:19.760
doubt encouraged by school curriculums and by teachers who propagated the same Marxist

04:51:19.760 --> 04:51:22.800
ideals that persist in the ethnic studies model curriculum.

04:51:22.800 --> 04:51:29.040
While I'm grateful for the work that has been done to revive the EMC, more changes are needed.

04:51:29.040 --> 04:51:33.440
I urge you to please reject demands that you remove language that encourages critical

04:51:33.440 --> 04:51:36.800
thinking instead of one-sided political agendas in the curriculum.

04:51:36.800 --> 04:51:41.200
It is crucial to include guidelines that will help prevent hatred and bias in our schools

04:51:41.200 --> 04:51:43.840
and repeat them multiple times throughout the curriculum.

04:51:43.840 --> 04:51:48.720
Critical thinking and objectivity are the only things capable of keeping hate and anti-Semitism

04:51:48.720 --> 04:51:49.840
out of our schools.

04:51:49.840 --> 04:51:53.440
Please don't let my parents' experiences become my own.

04:51:53.440 --> 04:51:53.940
Thank you.

04:51:54.640 --> 04:51:55.920
Thank you, caller.

04:51:55.920 --> 04:51:59.520
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:51:59.520 --> 04:52:00.800
Your time starts now.

04:52:04.080 --> 04:52:04.580
Hello?

04:52:05.060 --> 04:52:09.780
My name is Laurie Fong, a Chinese American teacher representing the API California School

04:52:09.780 --> 04:52:11.220
Board Members Association.

04:52:11.220 --> 04:52:16.260
I was a high school principal, a teacher, and am now a school board president in Santa Rosa.

04:52:16.260 --> 04:52:20.740
It's imperative now that SBA pass the SMC.

04:52:21.300 --> 04:52:25.620
As a student graded in California and as a teacher, I'm embarrassed and saddened that

04:52:25.620 --> 04:52:27.220
I did not learn nor teach this.

04:52:28.260 --> 04:52:32.420
It is necessary to have a strong resource for teachers to use to enrich the curriculum

04:52:32.420 --> 04:52:36.500
that our written fairs pass, ones that do not represent all of our current students.

04:52:36.500 --> 04:52:40.900
The recent anti-Asian violence is the one manifestation of keeping ethnic groups the

04:52:40.900 --> 04:52:47.060
other and allowing even promoting siloed experience and zero understanding of each other's histories

04:52:47.060 --> 04:52:48.340
and lived experiences.

04:52:49.140 --> 04:52:54.420
As Ms. Huerta, Ms. Weber, and Ms. Korematsu pointed out, this monocurriculum is due, it

04:52:54.420 --> 04:52:59.540
is time, it is necessary, and it's a step in the right direction for California schools.

04:52:59.620 --> 04:53:04.580
Please adopt it now to empower school districts and teachers to be agents of inclusivity.

04:53:05.140 --> 04:53:08.180
It's not perfect, it's a start, we must start.

04:53:08.180 --> 04:53:09.060
Thank you.

04:53:09.060 --> 04:53:10.260
Thank you, caller.

04:53:10.260 --> 04:53:14.500
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:53:14.500 --> 04:53:16.100
Your time starts now.

04:53:21.300 --> 04:53:22.420
Caller, your line.

04:53:22.420 --> 04:53:23.220
My name is Lennon.

04:53:23.780 --> 04:53:24.500
My name is Lennon.

04:53:24.500 --> 04:53:26.340
I'm a member of the Palestinian Youth Movement.

04:53:26.420 --> 04:53:30.980
I call on you to vote no on the current curriculum and to reinsert Arab-American lessons, including

04:53:30.980 --> 04:53:36.260
Palestine, in the Asian-American Studies section of the ESMC, both content and pedagogy developed

04:53:36.260 --> 04:53:40.500
by Arab-American educators and which is true to the discipline of ethnic studies.

04:53:40.500 --> 04:53:45.140
Palestinian and Arab-Americans like me experience anti-Arab racism and homophobia and the current

04:53:45.140 --> 04:53:49.620
whitewashed racist and offensive curriculum will only continue to harm Arab-American students.

04:53:50.180 --> 04:53:55.700
The CBE's decision to purge Arab-American studies from the Asian-American studies runs

04:53:55.700 --> 04:53:59.380
against decades-long tradition in Asian-American studies and ethnic studies

04:53:59.380 --> 04:54:02.740
and is shaped and supported, as shaped and supported by experts in the field.

04:54:02.740 --> 04:54:05.540
These actions marginalize Arab history and Arab people.

04:54:05.540 --> 04:54:09.380
They ignore the fact that Palestine is an intrinsic part of Arab-American history.

04:54:09.380 --> 04:54:14.260
I call on you again to reinsert Arab-American lessons, including Palestine, within the ESMC

04:54:14.260 --> 04:54:18.660
and I also call on you to include Armenian-American history in the main curriculum.

04:54:18.660 --> 04:54:19.060
Thank you.

04:54:20.420 --> 04:54:20.980
Thank you.

04:54:21.700 --> 04:54:25.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:54:25.140 --> 04:54:26.820
Your time starts now.

04:54:32.500 --> 04:54:34.180
Hello, can you hear me?

04:54:34.180 --> 04:54:35.780
Yes, please go ahead, caller.

04:54:37.140 --> 04:54:41.300
Hi, I'm Rebecca Hitchcock, a former San Mateo Social City School Board member and I'm calling

04:54:41.300 --> 04:54:45.780
today as an early education professional, lifetime supporter of building a better tomorrow

04:54:45.780 --> 04:54:50.100
by educating our children today and to support the Asian-American and Pacific Islander School

04:54:50.100 --> 04:54:54.820
Board Members Association's position that CBE approved the ethnic studies model curriculum today.

04:54:55.220 --> 04:54:59.700
It's essential that children learn about the richness and diversity of the AAPI community,

04:54:59.700 --> 04:55:02.740
which consists of over 100 languages and 50 ethnic groups.

04:55:02.740 --> 04:55:05.620
California's curriculum needs to be representative of our communities,

04:55:05.620 --> 04:55:10.740
thus the breadth of sample lessons of Chapter 4 in the AAPI section is critical for the relevance

04:55:10.740 --> 04:55:12.020
of the ESMC.

04:55:12.020 --> 04:55:16.420
The longer we wait to approve and adopt an ESMC, the longer we wait to heal.

04:55:16.420 --> 04:55:20.500
While we know it's not perfect, we also know that history is living and there will be opportunities

04:55:20.500 --> 04:55:23.700
to incorporate changes when being locally implemented.

04:55:23.780 --> 04:55:28.660
Let's step in the right direction by adopting now, making these imperative resources available

04:55:28.660 --> 04:55:33.460
to our educators, empowering them to be agents of inclusivity so more school districts can

04:55:33.460 --> 04:55:37.540
implement ethnic studies and move California school districts and our culture towards a

04:55:37.540 --> 04:55:39.620
more inclusive and respectful society.

04:55:39.620 --> 04:55:42.980
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:55:42.980 --> 04:55:44.340
Your time starts now.

04:55:50.020 --> 04:55:51.060
Caller, you're live.

04:55:53.780 --> 04:55:57.060
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:55:57.060 --> 04:55:58.340
Your time starts now.

04:56:00.900 --> 04:56:05.860
Hi, my name is Christina Smelter and I'm a mixed-race Asian American resident from San

04:56:05.860 --> 04:56:08.820
Luis Obispo, California and a student at UC Berkeley.

04:56:09.460 --> 04:56:14.180
I wholeheartedly support the adoption of the ethnic studies model curriculum, but the

04:56:14.180 --> 04:56:15.860
current draft is insufficient.

04:56:15.860 --> 04:56:17.780
I instead support the CARE Addedits.

04:56:18.660 --> 04:56:24.340
The goal of critical ethnic studies curriculum is not to be decisive, divisive, but transformative

04:56:24.340 --> 04:56:27.940
through exposure to narratives and knowledge which are normally suppressed.

04:56:28.660 --> 04:56:34.660
Engaging issues such as white supremacy or systemic racism is only divisive if you choose

04:56:34.660 --> 04:56:38.260
not to recognize the legacies of oppression which are being discussed.

04:56:39.060 --> 04:56:43.540
The goal of critical ethnic studies is not to place students into fixed social roles.

04:56:44.100 --> 04:56:45.620
In fact, it's quite the opposite.

04:56:46.340 --> 04:56:51.060
The very word critical already implies that students are expected to think about how their

04:56:51.060 --> 04:56:56.900
identities situate themselves in society today, that they can change from what their ancestors

04:56:56.900 --> 04:57:02.180
roles in society were in order to build community and dismantle oppressive systems.

04:57:03.140 --> 04:57:04.020
Thank you, caller.

04:57:04.660 --> 04:57:08.100
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:57:08.100 --> 04:57:09.620
Your time starts now.

04:57:09.620 --> 04:57:13.380
Hi.

04:57:13.380 --> 04:57:14.980
My name is Joshua Washington.

04:57:14.980 --> 04:57:18.020
I'm the executive director of the Institute for Black Solidarity with Israel.

04:57:18.900 --> 04:57:22.580
It is mind-boggling to me that there are many on this call who are calling for the original

04:57:22.580 --> 04:57:28.580
ESMC draft to be reinstated as it is a gross misrepresentation of history, including much

04:57:28.580 --> 04:57:33.380
of the Arab studies portion that misconstrues historical truth and omits the centuries-long

04:57:33.380 --> 04:57:35.300
Arab slave trade of Africans.

04:57:35.380 --> 04:57:40.260
The Black American part of the curriculum also dismisses Dr. King as weak and docile

04:57:40.260 --> 04:57:44.580
and erases others like him, including Thurgood Marshall by arresting the rules of parks.

04:57:44.580 --> 04:57:48.180
This is by design of critical race theory and critical ethnic studies.

04:57:48.740 --> 04:57:52.340
Furthermore, it is angry to hear how many on this call are equating ahistorical

04:57:52.340 --> 04:57:55.060
teachings about Jews and Israel to Palestinian human rights.

04:57:55.060 --> 04:58:00.180
It isn't human rights to malign, demonize, and erase the indigenousness of the Jewish people.

04:58:00.180 --> 04:58:03.300
That is not ethnic studies, and it has nothing to do with human rights.

04:58:03.380 --> 04:58:07.540
The first draft needs to stay dead, and its current draft needs to be completely revamped

04:58:07.540 --> 04:58:10.900
to reflect much more of our diversity of thought.

04:58:10.900 --> 04:58:15.940
Lastly, the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism is not a sensitive tool, no more than the

04:58:15.940 --> 04:58:17.700
civil rights tool as a censorship tool.

04:58:21.540 --> 04:58:24.980
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:58:24.980 --> 04:58:26.340
Your time starts now.

04:58:29.940 --> 04:58:30.440
Hello.

04:58:30.440 --> 04:58:33.800
Yes, caller.

04:58:33.800 --> 04:58:34.440
You're live.

04:58:34.440 --> 04:58:35.240
Please go ahead.

04:58:36.520 --> 04:58:37.020
Hello.

04:58:37.640 --> 04:58:40.920
My name is Linda Liebus, and I am a California voter.

04:58:41.560 --> 04:58:46.760
The critical ethnic studies approach has transformed the ESMC.

04:58:47.560 --> 04:58:54.600
It favors a narrow ideological agenda and predetermined answers rather than fostering

04:58:54.600 --> 04:58:55.800
the student's inquiry.

04:58:56.680 --> 04:59:02.120
The ESMC should foster inquiry, not indoctrinate.

04:59:02.120 --> 04:59:09.400
It should fight racism, not define people by skin color, unite and inspire students,

04:59:10.120 --> 04:59:13.960
not divide them, and evoke guilt and helplessness.

04:59:15.000 --> 04:59:23.400
Please take out the critical ethnic studies lens from the guiding values and principles

04:59:23.960 --> 04:59:30.760
and the subsequent chapters of the ESMC and replace them with a balanced,

04:59:30.760 --> 04:59:35.800
constructive approach, which we all agree we need and want.

04:59:35.800 --> 04:59:36.300
Thank you.

04:59:36.920 --> 04:59:38.200
Thank you, caller.

04:59:38.200 --> 04:59:41.480
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:59:41.480 --> 04:59:42.920
Your time starts now.

04:59:47.320 --> 04:59:48.680
Hi, everyone.

04:59:48.680 --> 04:59:51.160
Thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today.

04:59:51.160 --> 04:59:52.200
My name is Gabby.

04:59:52.200 --> 04:59:55.960
I'm a Moroccan Jew and a current student at a university in California.

04:59:55.960 --> 04:59:59.000
I also have a younger sibling in a California high school.

04:59:59.000 --> 05:00:02.440
While I'm grateful for the work that has been done to provide the ESMC,

05:00:02.440 --> 05:00:03.960
more changes are needed.

05:00:03.960 --> 05:00:07.080
Please include the full IRA definition of anti-feminism

05:00:07.080 --> 05:00:09.000
and reject pressure to remove it.

05:00:09.000 --> 05:00:12.120
This definition reflects the lived experiences of Jewish students

05:00:12.120 --> 05:00:14.520
and being used by divided administrations.

05:00:14.520 --> 05:00:16.440
It does not prevent criticism of Israel.

05:00:16.440 --> 05:00:20.040
It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California

05:00:20.040 --> 05:00:21.400
and around the world.

05:00:21.400 --> 05:00:24.600
Also, please do not retract line edit number 100.

05:00:24.600 --> 05:00:27.720
I ask that you make important changes to ensure our experiences

05:00:27.720 --> 05:00:29.880
are represented in the ESMC.

05:00:29.880 --> 05:00:33.000
Please ensure curriculum that my sister and her fellow students

05:00:33.000 --> 05:00:36.280
can learn from and that these Americans in California residents

05:00:36.280 --> 05:00:37.400
can all be proud of.

05:00:37.400 --> 05:00:37.900
Thank you.

05:00:38.680 --> 05:00:39.960
Thank you, caller.

05:00:39.960 --> 05:00:43.320
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:00:43.320 --> 05:00:44.680
Your time starts now.

05:00:48.840 --> 05:00:49.340
Hello.

05:00:50.220 --> 05:00:53.500
My name is Alon Abbey, and I'm a first generation of Iranian refugees

05:00:53.500 --> 05:00:54.540
in California.

05:00:54.540 --> 05:00:57.180
To paint people of Jewish descent as a privileged white class,

05:00:57.180 --> 05:00:59.820
although they are on the receiving end of the most ethnic hate crimes,

05:00:59.820 --> 05:01:00.620
is a joke.

05:01:00.620 --> 05:01:03.260
When Jews demand that they be represented by the widely accepted

05:01:03.260 --> 05:01:06.700
IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, who are we to deny them?

05:01:06.700 --> 05:01:10.060
And yes, singling out the sole Jewish state is a representation

05:01:10.060 --> 05:01:11.660
of centuries-long racism.

05:01:11.660 --> 05:01:13.900
As a first generation American of Iranian immigrants,

05:01:13.900 --> 05:01:16.060
I fight for the rights of our Jewish, Asian, Arab,

05:01:16.060 --> 05:01:17.820
and Armenian brothers and sisters.

05:01:17.900 --> 05:01:20.460
While in middle school in California, my parents and I study two units,

05:01:20.460 --> 05:01:21.980
which is four chapters on Islam.

05:01:21.980 --> 05:01:24.620
This includes two projects and two essays on learning Muslim praise

05:01:24.620 --> 05:01:25.260
and history.

05:01:25.260 --> 05:01:26.940
We learned of no other religions.

05:01:26.940 --> 05:01:30.540
The act as though Arab history is being unrepresented in this model is untrue,

05:01:30.540 --> 05:01:33.180
and many anti-Semitic callers are painting a false dichotomy

05:01:33.180 --> 05:01:35.740
between the inclusion of Jews and the representation of Arabs.

05:01:35.740 --> 05:01:38.460
These two populations are not mutually exclusive.

05:01:38.460 --> 05:01:41.100
Similarly, by painting the governments of the PA and Hamas,

05:01:41.100 --> 05:01:43.900
which killed gay, subject-X women and glorified martyrs,

05:01:43.900 --> 05:01:46.780
is this pain for you for the sole purpose of killing Jews.

05:01:46.780 --> 05:01:50.540
As quote unquote liberators, you're working with Jews

05:01:50.540 --> 05:01:53.660
and radicalizing an entire generation while ignoring the plight of Uighurs,

05:01:53.660 --> 05:01:55.100
Jews, and Middle Eastern North Africans.

05:01:55.100 --> 05:01:56.060
Thank you, caller.

Your time starts now.

05:02:07.500 --> 05:02:08.540
Caller, you're live.

05:02:08.620 --> 05:02:11.820
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:02:11.820 --> 05:02:13.340
Your time starts now.

05:02:15.900 --> 05:02:17.340
Hello, can you all hear me?

05:02:17.340 --> 05:02:18.780
Yes, please proceed.

05:02:20.300 --> 05:02:21.100
Hello, everyone.

05:02:21.100 --> 05:02:26.380
My name is Yasmin Abed, and I'm an ethnic studies graduate in the

05:02:26.380 --> 05:02:31.420
Abkhazian Campaigns coordinator with the Arab Resource Center in San Diego,

05:02:31.420 --> 05:02:34.540
where we work with thousands of Arab families and youth.

05:02:35.260 --> 05:02:41.420
I'm calling in strong opposition of the current model ethnic studies curriculum.

05:02:41.420 --> 05:02:45.580
Ethnic studies was the only space on campus I was heard and seen as a

05:02:45.580 --> 05:02:48.540
Palestinian student, but let's be real here.

05:02:48.540 --> 05:02:51.020
The most recent draft is not ethnic studies.

05:02:51.020 --> 05:02:54.860
It's a whitewashed version of ethnic studies that's made to ensure

05:02:54.860 --> 05:02:57.980
Zionists don't get uncomfortable by the bloody history of Zionism.

05:02:58.540 --> 05:03:02.380
Actual ethnic studies curriculum centers folks of color and talks about

05:03:02.380 --> 05:03:07.180
capitalism, enslavement, and settler colonialism as tools of oppression.

05:03:07.180 --> 05:03:09.420
Those are key terminologies to ethnic studies.

05:03:09.420 --> 05:03:10.700
They're not optional.

05:03:10.700 --> 05:03:16.140
Please make sure to reinsert these terminologies, and we demand that you

05:03:17.980 --> 05:03:22.220
vote no on the current proposal and reinsert Arab-American lessons,

05:03:22.220 --> 05:03:25.020
including Palestine, within the Asian-American Studies section.

05:03:25.020 --> 05:03:25.660
Thank you, caller.

05:03:25.660 --> 05:03:26.300
Good times now.

05:03:26.300 --> 05:03:27.100
Ethnic studies model curriculum.

05:03:27.900 --> 05:03:28.300
Thank you.

05:03:28.300 --> 05:03:33.260
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:03:33.260 --> 05:03:34.620
Your time starts now.

05:03:39.100 --> 05:03:40.780
Hello, my name is Zach Blumenstein.

05:03:40.780 --> 05:03:42.780
I'm a law student at Berkeley School of Law.

05:03:43.500 --> 05:03:47.660
I am yet another Jewish American here to say that the JCRC

05:03:47.660 --> 05:03:50.220
and the Simon Weizenbaum Center do not speak for me.

05:03:50.860 --> 05:03:54.300
I strongly urge the board to vote no on this curriculum.

05:03:54.300 --> 05:03:59.660
This ethnic studies curriculum has made a mockery of the original mandate in AB 2016,

05:03:59.660 --> 05:04:03.260
seeing as the entire advisory committee requested their names to be removed.

05:04:04.140 --> 05:04:08.860
Ethnic studies and its various foundations involves resistance to U.S. colonial conquest

05:04:08.860 --> 05:04:10.860
and the legacy of slavery.

05:04:10.860 --> 05:04:14.540
Yet this curriculum seeks to erase those very narratives,

05:04:14.540 --> 05:04:18.780
most notably by erasing the struggles of Arab-Americans and Palestinians.

05:04:19.420 --> 05:04:23.340
A lot of people here have expressed concern about the Atlanta shooting.

05:04:23.340 --> 05:04:27.820
But what does this even-handed diversity rhetoric do?

05:04:27.820 --> 05:04:30.780
It means that we can have a Black secretary of defense

05:04:30.780 --> 05:04:33.100
calling for increased belligerence against China

05:04:33.100 --> 05:04:35.980
and a Jewish secretary of state saying the same.

05:04:35.980 --> 05:04:40.380
We need to understand the struggles of Asian-Americans against U.S. imperialism

05:04:40.380 --> 05:04:42.700
and the role that it plays in growing white supremacy.

05:04:44.540 --> 05:04:48.300
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:04:48.300 --> 05:04:49.740
Your time starts now.

05:04:53.340 --> 05:04:54.860
My name is Anahid Oshagan.

05:04:54.860 --> 05:04:56.860
I am a first-generation Armenian-American,

05:04:56.860 --> 05:04:58.940
great-granddaughter of Armenian genocide survivors,

05:04:58.940 --> 05:05:00.700
product of the public school system,

05:05:00.700 --> 05:05:03.900
attorney and mother of four children, including two middle schoolers.

05:05:03.900 --> 05:05:07.820
I'm also a board member of the Armenian National Committee of America Western Region.

05:05:07.820 --> 05:05:12.540
I'm grateful for all the work done by the CDE to include ethnic studies in the model curriculum.

05:05:12.540 --> 05:05:16.780
As a former public school student, I did not learn Armenian history.

05:05:16.780 --> 05:05:18.540
I want to ensure this changes.

05:05:18.540 --> 05:05:21.660
While the ethnic studies curriculum is critical and empowering to some,

05:05:21.660 --> 05:05:25.100
it continues to ignore and marginalize Armenian history and falls short.

05:05:25.100 --> 05:05:29.820
The Armenian-Americans are being embraced from the ethnic studies model curriculum,

05:05:29.820 --> 05:05:33.420
even though we have submitted thousands and thousands of comments to the CDE.

05:05:33.420 --> 05:05:36.780
Armenian-American studies must be reinserted in the draft

05:05:36.780 --> 05:05:40.300
and be included in the main curriculum under Asian-American studies

05:05:40.300 --> 05:05:42.780
with the West Asian-American category.

05:05:43.420 --> 05:05:47.740
The status of the bridging section is unclear and must be clarified

05:05:47.740 --> 05:05:50.620
for the public and added in the main curriculum.

05:05:50.620 --> 05:05:56.700
The CDE must consult ethnic studies scholars who specialize in Armenian-American studies.

05:05:56.700 --> 05:05:57.660
Your time is up.

05:05:59.100 --> 05:06:02.860

Yes, can you hear me?

05:06:09.660 --> 05:06:10.860
Yes, please proceed.

05:06:11.980 --> 05:06:14.140
Yes, hi, my name is Michael Ehrenberg.

05:06:14.140 --> 05:06:21.500
I'm a businessman and someone who advocates for equal rights again towards all people.

05:06:21.500 --> 05:06:23.980
As a Jewish guy living here in Southern California

05:06:24.860 --> 05:06:30.220
and the son of a Holocaust survivor surviving the Nazi death camps,

05:06:30.860 --> 05:06:35.980
I stand for all people to be educated by facts.

05:06:35.980 --> 05:06:39.340
And I think that the critical ethnic studies program as it stands now

05:06:39.980 --> 05:06:47.100
actually creates division and pits ethnic groups against each other.

05:06:47.820 --> 05:06:51.660
I was delighted, of course, to learn that the California Education Code,

05:06:51.660 --> 05:06:58.860
the State Board of Education had started to rewrite some of these statements.

05:06:59.820 --> 05:07:06.140
And I also believe that no discrimination should be tolerated based on religion or nationality.

05:07:06.220 --> 05:07:10.060
I implore you to also include California's Middle Eastern,

05:07:10.060 --> 05:07:13.020
Mizoraki Jewish communities to the Southwest Asian communities.

05:07:15.580 --> 05:07:19.100

05:07:24.220 --> 05:07:26.140
Hello, my name is Lada Kiswani.

05:07:26.140 --> 05:07:29.900
I am the executive director of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center.

05:07:29.900 --> 05:07:34.380
I urge you all to not adopt this curriculum and follow the lead of

05:07:34.380 --> 05:07:40.220
legal organizations and experts in affirming that this draft does not meet the mandate of AB 2016.

05:07:40.220 --> 05:07:44.060
It is not an ethnic studies curriculum and is not written by experts.

05:07:44.060 --> 05:07:50.380
Today, CDE has put on a production to mask over the mass opposition to this curriculum.

05:07:50.380 --> 05:07:55.820
Shame on all of those who have enabled racist anti-Arab tropes to dominate the discussion

05:07:55.820 --> 05:07:59.260
in order to justify redefining ethnic studies.

05:07:59.260 --> 05:08:03.740
If 77% of California students are in fact students of color,

05:08:03.740 --> 05:08:08.940
why continue to center whiteness and allow white right-wing interest groups to shape this curriculum?

05:08:08.940 --> 05:08:12.460
This is an insult to the legacy of 1968 strike veterans.

05:08:12.460 --> 05:08:18.220
That is why they oppose this curriculum, as do experts like Cornel West and Angela Davis.

05:08:18.220 --> 05:08:23.980
You have erased us and displaced us, absolutely relegated us to an appendix,

05:08:23.980 --> 05:08:26.460
and then whitewashed the entire curriculum.

05:08:26.540 --> 05:08:30.060
You've allowed those times up.

05:08:30.060 --> 05:08:35.740
Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:08:51.580 --> 05:08:55.980
Hi, my name is Bella Yadagar and I'm a sophomore at Brentwood School in Los Angeles,

05:08:55.980 --> 05:09:00.540
California. I strongly support a curriculum that represents the experiences of different

05:09:00.540 --> 05:09:03.420
communities and I'm grateful for the work that has been done here.

05:09:03.420 --> 05:09:07.260
But I'm here to share more concerns about some of the problems that still remain.

05:09:07.260 --> 05:09:12.700
Number one, I ask you to please move Jemena's lesson plan about anti-semitism to the AAPI

05:09:12.700 --> 05:09:16.060
study section and approve all changes requested by Jemena.

05:09:16.620 --> 05:09:19.820
Second, please do not retract line edit number 100.

05:09:20.380 --> 05:09:25.020
Third, please add the IHRI definition of anti-semitism to the curriculum.

05:09:25.020 --> 05:09:29.500
Anti-semitism is a real and harmful part of daily life for Jewish students and this

05:09:29.500 --> 05:09:34.380
needs to be put to an end. As a first generation American, my parents and grandparents faced

05:09:34.380 --> 05:09:39.260
persecution in Iran and were forced to flee from the country due to their religious beliefs.

05:09:39.260 --> 05:09:43.900
They experienced anti-semitism in the classroom and in daily life and were forced to live with

05:09:43.900 --> 05:09:48.460
these horrific experiences of being called pigs and dirty Jews from a young age.

05:09:48.460 --> 05:09:52.540
I think we've seen enough people today putting down the Jewish community and this is hate we

05:09:52.540 --> 05:09:56.460
need to add, which is why we need the IHRI definition. Thank you, Colleen. Your time's up.

05:09:57.180 --> 05:10:02.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:10:07.180 --> 05:10:12.300
Hello. My name is Nadia and I'm a member of the Palestinian youth movement.

05:10:12.300 --> 05:10:19.260
I'm calling for the SBE to vote no on the current SMSC. It is completely unacceptable for the CDE

05:10:19.260 --> 05:10:23.820
to allow predominantly white right-wing interest groups to define ethnic studies and you've heard

05:10:23.820 --> 05:10:28.380
this time and again on this phone call. I've been on the entire time and waited a long time

05:10:28.380 --> 05:10:33.340
to get these comments as have so many who I know are dropping off because they don't have the time

05:10:33.340 --> 05:10:39.180
to sit and wait for you to call on them nor can they pay the fines or the cost in order to sit

05:10:39.180 --> 05:10:44.380
here minute by minute. This is not accessible whatsoever. Ethnic studies emerge as a discipline

05:10:44.380 --> 05:10:48.780
in order to resist the history of U.S. racism, colonial conquest, and enslavement and to send

05:10:48.940 --> 05:10:54.860
BIPOC communities who have been most impacted. The CDE enlisted non-ethnic study scholars and

05:10:54.860 --> 05:10:59.100
succumbed to pressure from right-wing institutions and as a result have completely sanitized the

05:10:59.100 --> 05:11:04.220
curriculum to exclude any analysis and critique of racism and other systems of oppression.

05:11:04.220 --> 05:11:09.500
For shame, we demand a true ethnic studies curriculum that's anti-racist, anti-colonial,

05:11:09.500 --> 05:11:11.020
and liberatory. Thank you, Colleen. Your time's up.

05:11:12.140 --> 05:11:16.540
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

Hello, can you hear me? Please proceed.

05:11:24.300 --> 05:11:28.940
Hi, my name is Sarah, a community advocate to Advancing Justice Asian Law Caucus and a mentor

05:11:28.940 --> 05:11:34.540
at the Arab Resource Center in San Diego. The current version of the ESMC is not ethnic studies.

05:11:34.540 --> 05:11:38.620
There is a lack of analysis and critique of racism and other systems of oppression.

05:11:38.620 --> 05:11:43.340
How is ensuring that the historical truth of this country such as racism, white supremacy,

05:11:43.340 --> 05:11:47.740
divisive? Our students need to understand the historical reality of our communities.

05:11:47.740 --> 05:11:52.460
This is why I asked the State of Board of Education to vote no on the current ESMC

05:11:52.460 --> 05:11:57.580
and instead have it rewritten by ethnic studies educators and reinsert Arab American lessons,

05:11:57.580 --> 05:12:02.460
including on Palestine, restore the original guiding values, and reinsert key terms and

05:12:02.460 --> 05:12:05.980
definitions aligned with ethnic studies scholarship. Thank you and have a good day.

05:12:06.620 --> 05:12:11.020

Hi, can you hear me? Yes, please proceed.

05:13:08.780 --> 05:13:15.500
Hi, my name is Elena Junowabi. I'm the Administrator for CARE San Diego. Please vote no on this draft.

05:13:15.500 --> 05:13:21.020
I can tell you from the numerous calls I've received from work, people call me in for various

05:13:21.020 --> 05:13:26.140
reasons such as Islamophobia, xenophobia, racism, hate, and violence. All of them are

05:13:26.140 --> 05:13:31.340
correlated to one thing. Their identities have been eliminated. Our narratives have been hijacked

05:13:31.340 --> 05:13:35.500
and our dignities have been trampled by right-wing white supremacy like the ones you have heard in

05:13:35.500 --> 05:13:42.780
support of this draft. I urge you to please reinsert the Arab-American lessons in Palestine

05:13:42.780 --> 05:13:48.380
within the Asian-American Studies sections of this ethnic studies model curriculum with content and

05:13:48.380 --> 05:13:54.220
pedagogy developed by Arab-American educators and true to the discipline of ethnic studies.

05:13:54.220 --> 05:13:59.580
I really, really thank you all for giving me your time and I do encourage you to please reread

05:13:59.580 --> 05:14:04.220
everything that we have worked on and support our communities. Don't trample our identities,

05:14:04.220 --> 05:14:09.340
our dignities, or hijack our narratives. This is very important to us because we are exposed to

05:14:09.340 --> 05:14:15.180
violence and so much hate. You have no idea. The AAPI are one of the people who experienced this.

05:14:16.060 --> 05:14:20.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:14:23.500 --> 05:14:29.660
Hi, I'm Mariah and I'm an Apokazi Latina student at CCSS for Critical Pacifica Studies.

05:14:29.660 --> 05:14:34.540
Please vote no on this draft. What is being offered disregards the fundamental orientation

05:14:34.540 --> 05:14:39.740
of ethnic studies. It lacks the analysis, critique of racism, and other systems of oppression

05:14:39.740 --> 05:14:44.780
and it does not fully represent an Arab-American lesson plan inclusive of Palestine written by

05:14:44.780 --> 05:14:49.900
Arab-American educators. Throughout this meeting, I'm hearing this framework is meant to serve our

05:14:49.900 --> 05:14:54.220
educators as a blueprint on how to run the curriculum. However, this draft is providing

05:14:54.220 --> 05:15:00.220
directions on how to sanitize and protect white supremacy and I'm hearing that this curriculum

05:15:00.220 --> 05:15:05.180
is not appropriate because it will encourage hate. For this education to be valuable and unifying

05:15:05.180 --> 05:15:10.060
courses need the critical studies lens to engage all students in constructive learning and invoke

05:15:10.060 --> 05:15:14.860
healing from the atrocities that have inspired. White supremacist culture and white violence is

05:15:14.860 --> 05:15:21.100
not only embedded but especially deliberately enforced when you lead historically oppressed

05:15:21.100 --> 05:15:25.900
people out of your curriculum. This education needs to be honest and completely truthful

05:15:25.900 --> 05:15:31.500
of lived experiences. Thank you for following your time's up. Next caller, please state your

name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:15:37.660 --> 05:15:44.700
Hello. Yes, please proceed. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Please proceed.

05:15:44.700 --> 05:15:50.860
Oh, hi. Sorry. My name is Jennifer Holden. I'm a parent from Marin County, a proud Zionist,

05:15:50.860 --> 05:15:54.860
and a daughter and granddaughter of North African Jews. While I appreciate all the work

05:15:54.860 --> 05:16:00.220
to revise the ESMC, I urge that you make further changes and resist pressure to make the curriculum

05:16:00.220 --> 05:16:06.940
worse. First, please include the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and reject pressure

05:16:06.940 --> 05:16:11.820
to remove it. This definition reflects the real life experiences of Jewish students and is being

05:16:11.820 --> 05:16:18.780
used by the Biden administration. The IHRA definition does not prevent criticism of Israel.

05:16:18.780 --> 05:16:23.020
It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the

05:16:23.020 --> 05:16:27.820
world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show that the vast majority of Jews agree

05:16:27.820 --> 05:16:33.980
that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into antisemitism. On a more personal note,

05:16:33.980 --> 05:16:38.620
my family was forced out of their Arab and Muslim majority home and no other Arab or Muslim majority

05:16:38.620 --> 05:16:43.260
country would welcome them because they were Jews. Israel is a welcome home to Jews of color like

05:16:43.260 --> 05:16:49.500
mine. Second, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in chapter. Thank you so much.

05:16:49.500 --> 05:16:55.820
Your time's up. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:16:55.820 --> 05:17:03.820
Your time starts now. Hello, my name is Jonathan and I am a parent of two. I had my own facts to

05:17:03.820 --> 05:17:07.500
bring today, but I think the previous callers brought me more than enough evidence. As you have

05:17:07.500 --> 05:17:12.460
heard multiple times, many people are advocating for the IHRA definition of antisemitism to be

05:17:12.460 --> 05:17:18.540
included in the main section of the ESMC, a section present in the Gemena Mizrahi section.

05:17:18.540 --> 05:17:24.060
I have heard people calling us Jews, white, powerful, controlling, right-wing. This is absurd.

05:17:24.060 --> 05:17:29.500
This is the ignorance that leads to antisemitism, grouping Jews under stereotypes. This is why we

05:17:29.500 --> 05:17:33.740
are pushing for this to get approved. Gemena is Jews from the Middle East. I can show you my skin.

05:17:33.740 --> 05:17:38.540
There is no white. We are pro-Israel because we are Jews, not because of the color of our skin,

05:17:38.540 --> 05:17:42.380
not for our controls. But personally, I support Palestine. I want a resolution,

05:17:42.380 --> 05:17:47.340
but for this to happen, we need both Palestinian and Israel perspectives, not just one. Zionism

05:17:47.340 --> 05:17:51.980
is not anti-Palestine, as some say, but instead just promotes the idea of a home for Jews.

05:17:51.980 --> 05:17:56.940
An apartheid in Israel is not possible. There are Arabs in the Israeli government. Once the other

05:17:56.940 --> 05:18:01.100
side realized there would be more equality of perspective, they now want to cancel this draft.

05:18:01.100 --> 05:18:05.420
Critical thinking. That means equality of perspectives. Please, no stereotypes.

05:18:05.580 --> 05:18:11.340
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

05:18:11.340 --> 05:18:19.500
record. Your time starts now. Caller, are you on the line?

05:18:20.940 --> 05:18:26.060
Hi. My name is May. I'm a civil rights activist and educator, a mother of three children currently

05:18:26.060 --> 05:18:31.580
in the California public school system, a product of the school system myself. I'm a woman of color,

05:18:31.660 --> 05:18:37.420
a minority, a refugee, and yes, a Jew. Over 60% of your constituents, your students,

05:18:37.420 --> 05:18:42.540
are non-Arab, with the majority being Mizrahi refugee Jews of Middle East and North Africa.

05:18:43.260 --> 05:18:50.940
Over 200,000 of them live in our state. Jews are only 2% of the population. You are subject to over

05:18:50.940 --> 05:18:57.900
68% of all ethno-religious hate crimes, making us the number one targets of ethno-religious crimes.

05:18:58.460 --> 05:19:02.300
We make up one of your largest percentage of your constituents, yet we were given

05:19:02.860 --> 05:19:09.420
zero representation within the main body of your curriculum and were left to be once more

05:19:09.420 --> 05:19:16.060
marginalized and left in the margins in the back in the attendance section. How is that fair? How

05:19:16.060 --> 05:19:23.180
is that just when every day Jews are in pain and cannot walk outside without being persecuted?

05:19:23.180 --> 05:19:27.100
Jewish students cannot go to school and they have to hide their identity.

05:19:28.460 --> 05:19:33.180
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:19:37.500 --> 05:19:41.660
Hi, this is Clayton Reines. I'm from Mission VAO. I got three kids in school.

05:19:42.460 --> 05:19:48.540
I am a product of the California school system as well. So it was brought to my attention some of

05:19:48.540 --> 05:19:56.060
the critical race theory parts of this program that are the most troubling and really it ties

05:19:56.060 --> 05:20:00.700
back to the origins of critical race theory and I challenge the board members to really think about

05:20:00.700 --> 05:20:05.900
how they interpret really the civil rights movement of the 60s which has been invoked

05:20:05.900 --> 05:20:10.460
by other people speaking here as well. So in looking at the work from Derrick Bell,

05:20:10.460 --> 05:20:16.140
Alan Freeman and Kimberly Crenshaw who really did Mapping the Margins, it really culminated

05:20:16.140 --> 05:20:20.060
in Richard Delgado's work Critical Race Theory and Introduction. It says and I quote,

05:20:20.060 --> 05:20:24.460
unlike traditional civil rights, CRT questions the very foundations of the liberal order,

05:20:24.460 --> 05:20:29.660
including equality theory, legal reasoning, enlightenment, rationalism, and the neutral

05:20:29.660 --> 05:20:35.980
principles of constitutional law. My challenge to you is do you really reject the liberal order,

05:20:35.980 --> 05:20:40.940
the foundations of the liberal order? Do we reject equality? Are we rejecting...

05:20:40.940 --> 05:20:42.940
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

05:20:43.580 --> 05:20:44.460
Thank you.

05:20:44.460 --> 05:20:49.980
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:20:52.860 --> 05:20:58.220
I'm Luna Martinez, a Berkeley Law graduate and attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights.

05:20:58.220 --> 05:21:02.460
I want to urge the board to resist the conservative forces pushing aggressively for

05:21:02.460 --> 05:21:07.020
the current curriculum. People today have called the curriculum a good start, but I ask the board

05:21:07.020 --> 05:21:11.660
to consider, good for whom? Not for the adult American voices and histories the curriculum

05:21:11.660 --> 05:21:16.700
erases, not for Palestinian students targeted by the same groups pushing this curriculum,

05:21:16.700 --> 05:21:21.100
not for Muslim students already facing state repression who won't see themselves reflected

05:21:21.100 --> 05:21:26.380
in the study materials. No, the curriculum is only good for the right-wing actors that benefit

05:21:26.380 --> 05:21:31.340
from silencing these vulnerable voices, and it contradicts the principles and mandate of

05:21:31.340 --> 05:21:37.980
ethnic studies under AB 2016. I urge the board to resist pressures to carry water for reactionary

05:21:37.980 --> 05:21:43.660
groups like the ADL whose agendas stand at odds with the anti-racist, decolonial, and

05:21:43.660 --> 05:21:48.860
libertarian mission of ethnic studies. For these reasons, the board must reject the curriculum.

05:21:48.860 --> 05:21:54.220
Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:21:54.220 --> 05:21:55.900
Your time starts now.

05:21:55.900 --> 05:22:12.620
Hello? Yes, you're live, caller.

05:22:13.420 --> 05:22:21.180
Oh, hi. Yes, I am Dr. Roberto Hernandez. I am the current chair-elect for the National

05:22:21.180 --> 05:22:27.340
Association for Chicano and Chicano Studies, and while I respect the work of Assemblyman Alejo

05:22:28.220 --> 05:22:34.860
that got us here, I actually worked on the very first iteration of AB 100 that preceded

05:22:35.420 --> 05:22:41.740
the model curriculum. Nevertheless, I'm here to urge you to vote against it. This current

05:22:41.740 --> 05:22:47.180
version does a disservice to ethnic studies. There is no critical ethnic studies and constructive

05:22:47.180 --> 05:22:52.460
ethnic studies. There's only ethnic studies, as created by ethnic studies scholars over the

05:22:52.460 --> 05:22:58.700
last 50 years, and a celebratory multiculturalism that is what we're hearing touted as this

05:22:59.420 --> 05:23:04.060
constructive ethnic studies. Moreover, it's important to note that ethnic studies is not

05:23:04.060 --> 05:23:09.100
about the history of groups. It's about processes of racialization and domination.

05:23:09.740 --> 05:23:14.380
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:23:17.660 --> 05:23:23.180
I'm Denny Asnis, retired public school teacher of 20 years, member of Queers for Palestine,

05:23:23.180 --> 05:23:28.460
and a Jewish anti-Zionist, urging you to vote no on this current version of ethnic studies.

05:23:28.460 --> 05:23:34.140
It is not a liberatory ethnic studies curriculum. As queers, we know the importance of fighting the

05:23:34.140 --> 05:23:39.420
attempt to silence our voices and our support for intersectional liberation. Arab-American

05:23:39.420 --> 05:23:45.340
lessons, including Palestine, must be reinstated into Asian-American studies. As an educator,

05:23:45.580 --> 05:23:50.380
I know that all our students would benefit from a critical analysis of racism as they seek ways

05:23:50.380 --> 05:23:56.380
to affect systemic change. Equating anti-Semitism and hate speech with criticism of Israel and

05:23:56.380 --> 05:24:02.300
support for Palestine is bad pedagogy and undermines the original intent of ethnic studies.

05:24:02.300 --> 05:24:07.580
Vote no on this ethnic studies. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

Hello, my name is Louise Lipsy. I am a grandparent of several grandchildren here in California

05:24:37.740 --> 05:24:43.660
school system. I am extremely concerned about the growing anti-Semitism that is occurring in all

05:24:43.660 --> 05:24:51.500
the schools in the state. And I really call upon you to please include the full IHRA definition

05:24:51.500 --> 05:24:59.020
anti-Semitism. And please approve all the changes that Jimena have made. And do not retract, please.

05:24:59.020 --> 05:25:05.740
Line edit 100. I urge you to make these changes. Appreciate all the work you've done. But please,

05:25:05.820 --> 05:25:11.900
let us not create more divisionist and more hatred and more anti-Semitism. Let's work

05:25:11.900 --> 05:25:19.420
constructively to have critical thinking and positive ethnic studies that promotes positive

05:25:19.420 --> 05:25:25.580
feelings among students and does not create more hate and is not creating more anti-Semitism

05:25:25.580 --> 05:25:31.500
in the school system. We've had too much already and it's time to move forward and eliminate this

05:25:31.500 --> 05:25:36.540
and go forward and more include the matter that will include all.

05:25:36.540 --> 05:25:41.580
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:25:45.420 --> 05:25:51.820
Hello. Yes, please proceed. My name is Higa'a Anaya. I'm a Palestinian Muslim Arab American

05:25:51.820 --> 05:25:57.340
student. I'm a youth leader at AROC. To speak to the speaker from ING, you said this isn't about

05:25:57.340 --> 05:26:01.900
marginalized groups. It's about all American perspectives. From my understanding as a student,

05:26:01.900 --> 05:26:06.940
one of the main purposes of ethnic studies is to avoid using a racist, colonialist American

05:26:06.940 --> 05:26:12.220
perspective. For more than 10 years that I have attended school in America, every history lesson

05:26:12.220 --> 05:26:19.020
or description of ethnicity was an American perspective, one that described us Muslims and

05:26:19.020 --> 05:26:23.980
Arabs as a darker future people. The American perspective will always be one of stereotypes

05:26:23.980 --> 05:26:30.220
and uses a white savior complex. To the board, the American studies of the American Arab American

05:26:30.220 --> 05:26:35.500
studies of the curriculum should center Arabs, our perspectives, our narratives, and our histories

05:26:35.500 --> 05:26:41.020
of resistance. Also, please include Palestine. Ethnic studies centers those who have been pushed

05:26:41.020 --> 05:26:48.380
aside like Palestinians. It makes that intentional choice to center those voices because if you don't,

05:26:48.380 --> 05:26:53.580
then you won't. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and

Caller, you're live. Hello, this is Amy. Yes, please go ahead.

05:27:10.460 --> 05:27:17.660
Oh, hi. My name is Amy Ku and I'm the API director for CSBA, Northern VP for Episma.

05:27:17.660 --> 05:27:23.100
I urge you to adopt the ESMC today. While we understand that it is not perfect, there will

05:27:23.100 --> 05:27:28.780
be opportunities to incorporate changes when implementing locally. The AAPI community consists

05:27:28.780 --> 05:27:34.860
of about 50 ethnic groups with over 100 languages. Thus, the breadth of AAPI sample lessons is

05:27:34.860 --> 05:27:40.060
critical for the ESMC's relevance in local communities. I'm a fourth generation San

05:27:40.060 --> 05:27:45.180
Franciscan and my first memory of racial bullying was at the age of five when a group of kids

05:27:45.180 --> 05:27:50.460
circled me in a swimming pool and sang Chungking Chinaman like it was springing around the posy.

05:27:50.460 --> 05:27:55.100
I fear for the safety of my elderly parents when they walk the streets of San Francisco

05:27:55.100 --> 05:27:59.500
and my in-laws, Vietnamese refugees who live in Sunnyvale, asked whether they should get

05:27:59.500 --> 05:28:04.860
pepper spray for protection. With the rise in anti-Asian violence and xenophobia,

05:28:04.860 --> 05:28:10.140
now is the time to say yes to enabling our students to build bridges and connections

05:28:10.140 --> 05:28:15.340
through ethnic studies. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:28:15.340 --> 05:28:16.780

05:28:20.300 --> 05:28:28.940
Hello. Yes, please. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes. My name is Myeong Kim. Hello. My name is Myeong Kim,

05:28:28.940 --> 05:28:33.900
Dasong Korean School Principal in Sunnyvale, California. I have a 30-year teaching experience

05:28:33.900 --> 05:28:39.180
and two children and two grandchildren. Ethnic studies is very important for the students to

05:28:39.180 --> 05:28:44.700
understand systems and power at the root of American society and to motivate them to actively

05:28:44.700 --> 05:28:50.540
engage in our democracy. I'd like to support the API School Board Members Association's position

05:28:50.540 --> 05:28:57.420
that the SBE approved the ESMC today. The AAPI community consists of about 50 ethnic groups

05:28:57.420 --> 05:29:03.820
with over 100 languages. Thus, the breadth of sample lessons in the API section of Chapter 4

05:29:03.820 --> 05:29:10.620
is critical for the relevance of the ESMC in local communities. With the rise in anti-Asian

05:29:10.620 --> 05:29:16.540
violence and xenophobia, now is the time to prove enabling our students to build bridges and

05:29:16.540 --> 05:29:22.940
connections through the ethnic studies. Thank you very much. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

is Daniela Schwartz. I am a Jewish-Mexican-American and a product of the California school system.

05:29:44.780 --> 05:29:55.020
I would like to request that the school board please accept the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism

05:29:55.020 --> 05:30:02.540
and please implement all of the suggestions taken, requested by the Jimena organization

05:30:03.100 --> 05:30:09.980
as a Jewish-Mexican-American whose ancestors fled genocide and persecution

05:30:09.980 --> 05:30:14.940
both from Europe and from Northern Africa. I request that you please include these

05:30:17.820 --> 05:30:28.300
edits into the curriculum and please allow everyone to be inclusive. I'd also like to add

05:30:28.300 --> 05:30:34.540
that over 50 percent of the population that exists in Israel today are refugees from Northern

05:30:34.540 --> 05:30:41.820
African and Arab countries. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:30:41.820 --> 05:30:48.860
Your time starts now. Hi. My name is Amy. I'm a resident of California and the comments over

05:30:48.860 --> 05:30:53.580
the past two hours seem to be a bit of evidence as to how much division ethnic studies create,

05:30:53.580 --> 05:30:57.500
but having a more robust history as mentioned by few speakers is great.

05:30:57.500 --> 05:31:01.980
The ESMC is not that and I respectfully ask that you reject it. The ESMC is loaded with

05:31:01.980 --> 05:31:07.580
Marxist ideology already sowing deep division among peoples and generally maligned people

05:31:07.580 --> 05:31:12.620
of European UK descent, European UK cultures and Christianity. This does not heal societies

05:31:12.620 --> 05:31:17.180
or build community. As previous members of the public have stated, the ESMC also includes chants

05:31:17.180 --> 05:31:22.460
that appeal to various gods including an Aztec god of human sacrifice and cannibalism. If prayer is

05:31:22.460 --> 05:31:26.860
no longer allowed in public schools, how is this okay? This would train Christian and Jewish

05:31:26.860 --> 05:31:31.660
children to violate the first commandment and commit a horrible offense against Almighty God.

05:31:32.220 --> 05:31:36.700
And our previous speaker this morning equated conservatism with racism and white supremacy.

05:31:36.700 --> 05:31:42.220
However, a conservative or someone of European descent or a Christian does not make someone a

05:31:42.220 --> 05:31:47.260
racist or a white supremacist. Conservatives identify with many different races and cultures

05:31:47.260 --> 05:31:51.180
as you Christian. Thank you for your time and please reject the ESMC. Thank you caller.

Hi, my name is Ernie Nishi. I'm an ABC School Board member,

05:32:01.660 --> 05:32:06.300
Toonant Canyon Distance Station member and everything else. I'm here to support the API

05:32:06.300 --> 05:32:12.060
School Board Association position that SBE approved as ESPM now. We can't hold back. Every delay

05:32:12.060 --> 05:32:16.060
means another generation will witness more intolerance, more cases for kids, more treating

05:32:16.060 --> 05:32:20.940
African Americans as others, and more Asian hate. My mom was a victim of this. She was

05:32:20.940 --> 05:32:25.980
incarcerated for no reason because she was the other person. My daughter is never going to get

05:32:25.980 --> 05:32:31.820
to see this tuition because frankly she's going to graduate out. We can't let this delay anymore.

05:32:31.820 --> 05:32:40.620
More delaying, more hurt. We need to start. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller,

05:33:39.420 --> 05:33:44.380
Hi, I'm Lili, the executive director of APT. We wrote a letter asking for state

05:33:44.380 --> 05:33:48.860
leadership to stand up to the typical power dynamics of influence to ensure the authenticity

05:33:48.860 --> 05:33:54.300
of ethnic studies to combat systemic racism and to create a system of continuous improvement.

05:33:54.300 --> 05:33:58.220
Two days ago eight people six of whom were Asian Americans were murdered in three different

05:33:58.220 --> 05:34:03.900
locations in Atlanta. On June 17, 2015 nine African Americans were murdered in Charleston.

05:34:03.900 --> 05:34:09.580
On October 27, 2018 11 Jews were murdered in Pittsburgh. The common thread is that all these

05:34:09.580 --> 05:34:13.660
murders were conducted by white men acting on white supremacy. We need to acknowledge and

05:34:13.660 --> 05:34:18.300
critique these realities based on race. The marginalization of people of color in our

05:34:18.300 --> 05:34:23.660
education curricula trained most Americans to not see people of color as equals. Our education

05:34:23.660 --> 05:34:28.700
system owes the debt to students and people of color to be seen heard and valued. Ethnic studies

05:34:28.700 --> 05:34:32.460
are supposed to elevate the narratives of the marginalized to combat the legacies of racial

05:34:32.460 --> 05:34:37.660
injustice. When the current ESMC dilutes the naming of systemic racism, white supremacy,

05:34:37.660 --> 05:34:42.860
and exclusion of people of color it continues to advance whitewash narratives while failing

05:34:43.420 --> 05:34:48.620
Thank you. Point your time's up next caller please state your name and affiliation for the

Hi. Can you hear me? Yes, please proceed. I'm Hiba, an educator in SoCal. Use an alias

05:35:21.900 --> 05:35:25.980
because this space is not safe. Anyone who speaks critically of Israeli colonialism and

05:35:25.980 --> 05:35:30.100
its institutions, according to the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, are witch-hunted and are

05:35:30.100 --> 05:35:33.820
targeted on the blackmail website Canary. The current draft contributes to an already

05:35:33.820 --> 05:35:37.740
dangerous education environment for BIPOC and Palestinian students. As an indigenous

05:35:37.740 --> 05:35:41.980
Palestinian Semite, the European supremacy movement co-opts in the Semitica identity

05:35:41.980 --> 05:35:45.660
policy. Like the Mizrahi, continue the cleansing of my community through this new corrupted

05:35:45.660 --> 05:35:49.940
curriculum, erasing indigenous Levantine Semites and fueling identity politics in support of

05:35:49.940 --> 05:35:53.580
genocidal Israeli apartheid. And even the Armenians from the curriculum is a form of

05:35:53.580 --> 05:35:58.100
Zionism from the region carried out in this new corrupt draft of the curriculum that pro-Israel

05:35:58.100 --> 05:36:03.020
groups perpetuate. State decision makers should not fall into the chaos of internal identity

05:36:03.020 --> 05:36:08.180
politics of the pro-ethnic cleansing Zionist community that's hiding behind multiculturalism

05:36:08.180 --> 05:36:12.660
while they scramble to rescue Israel's reputation as it comes under investigation for war crimes.

05:36:12.660 --> 05:36:16.740
This is all connected and all very scary. That is not the role of the state. Support

05:36:16.740 --> 05:36:21.500
the original draft of ethnic studies. We instate everyone else to follow up on this.

05:36:21.500 --> 05:36:27.140
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Callers, we still have a number

05:36:27.140 --> 05:36:35.900
of people online. Once again, if you've already spoken, please disconnect from the phone line.

05:36:35.900 --> 05:36:43.180
Next caller. Hi, yes. Yes, go ahead. I'm a mother of three in the public school system

05:36:43.180 --> 05:36:53.220
and it is as a daughter of a, a granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor and two parents, Israeli

05:36:53.220 --> 05:37:04.060
parents. One, my father was born in Palestine. I find that this ethnic studies is very, doesn't

05:37:04.060 --> 05:37:12.780
tell their side on the personal aspect. And it's, I'd also really like to have the definition

05:37:12.780 --> 05:37:23.740
of anti-Semitism that was adopted by included. And I feel that every nation has a voice and

05:37:23.740 --> 05:37:29.820
that narrative is not there when you don't have the ability to have critical thinking.

05:37:30.300 --> 05:37:38.300
And that is where it comes to indoctrination as opposed to education. So if we can please make

05:37:38.300 --> 05:37:45.260
sure that those voices are heard. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

05:37:45.260 --> 05:37:59.420
record. Your time starts now. Hello, is that me? That's you. You're next. All right. I want to

05:37:59.420 --> 05:38:05.020
say that the ethnic studies model curriculum needs to be rejected. It's formed a critical

05:38:05.020 --> 05:38:11.900
race theory and it's Marxist, then this tactic that that's separating out and demonize a race

05:38:11.900 --> 05:38:18.620
to assign the oppressor role to is completely divisive. And there are many state and federal

05:38:18.620 --> 05:38:26.700
laws that are being violated with this curriculum. And we're not going to stand for this. You're

05:38:26.700 --> 05:38:31.020
going to have so many lawsuits. It's never going to even get off the ground. So I think you need

05:38:31.020 --> 05:38:40.060
to stop wasting California's tax money and time with this radical indoctrination attempt. Thank you.

05:38:42.140 --> 05:38:47.180
Thank you so much, speaker. Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:39:30.780 --> 05:39:35.340
As a parent of an African American child, I do not want my child

05:39:35.340 --> 05:39:40.940
being taught that he is a victim. Any psychologist will tell you labeling will frame that child's

05:39:40.940 --> 05:39:45.180
future. Likewise, white children should not be taught that they're evil because of the

05:39:45.180 --> 05:39:51.900
color of their skin. That is racism. Clearly, this will foment racism, create further divisiveness,

05:39:51.900 --> 05:39:56.700
and create a generation of individuals who hate themselves and harbor grievances

05:39:56.700 --> 05:40:00.860
towards others. Reject it outright. Thank you.

05:40:03.260 --> 05:40:08.380
Thank you so much for the call. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:40:08.380 --> 05:40:09.740
Your time starts now.

05:40:10.140 --> 05:40:16.300
I'm Paul Kuyofsky. The model curriculum is still infected with critical race theory,

05:40:16.300 --> 05:40:21.020
the belief that every person, interaction, and institution must be viewed through the

05:40:21.020 --> 05:40:29.420
prism of race. Teaching this neo-racism is harmful for many reasons. Here's one. In 1967,

05:40:29.420 --> 05:40:35.100
3% of U.S. marriages were interracial marriages. 50 years later, the percentage of interracial

05:40:35.740 --> 05:40:43.100
marriages had risen to 17%. In California, almost 25%. These millions of mixed-race couples have

05:40:43.100 --> 05:40:49.340
had millions of mixed-race children. Many of them are in California's schools. Thus California's

05:40:49.340 --> 05:40:55.100
children increasingly know other multiracial children or are themselves multiracial. But just

05:40:55.100 --> 05:41:00.940
when this is liberating them from the constricting racial boxes of the past, critical race theory

05:41:00.940 --> 05:41:06.060
past. Critical race theory would drag our children back into those mental cages.

05:41:06.860 --> 05:41:09.900
Please don't inflict critical race theory on our children.

05:41:11.020 --> 05:41:16.620
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

05:41:16.620 --> 05:41:27.740
starts now. Hello? Yes, please go ahead. Hello? Yes. My name is Laura Messian and I'm a teacher.

05:41:28.300 --> 05:41:34.140
I'm also the descendant of Turkish and Persian Jewish refugees. My brother-in-law was present

05:41:34.140 --> 05:41:39.420
when the Poway synagogue was attacked and he could have been murdered simply for being a Jew,

05:41:39.420 --> 05:41:45.660
murdered by a white supremacist. So please move both the Middle Eastern Jewish American lesson

05:41:45.660 --> 05:41:51.100
and the Armenian American lesson into the main Asian studies unit. Please place the analysis

05:41:51.100 --> 05:41:57.580
of anti-Semitism along with Islamophobia. This is equitable and inclusive. Covering one and not

05:41:57.580 --> 05:42:03.020
the other shows bias as Jews and other Middle Eastern people have been and continue to be

05:42:03.020 --> 05:42:09.900
excluded, marginalized, silenced, stereotyped, and scapegoated. Specifically in a time of rising hate

05:42:09.900 --> 05:42:15.980
crimes directed specifically at American Jews, we cannot afford to sideline anti-Semitism which

05:42:15.980 --> 05:42:22.220
affects all Jews simply because of one's opposition to Israeli policies or because one

05:42:22.220 --> 05:42:31.260
erroneously considers some Jews white. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

05:42:31.260 --> 05:42:41.820

05:42:41.820 --> 05:42:46.860
My name is Erica and I'm a City College of San Francisco student and daughter of the Namor refugees.

05:42:46.860 --> 05:42:50.860
I'm in full agreement with all the previous speakers that are denouncing white supremacy

05:42:50.860 --> 05:42:56.380
and I'm here in solidarity with the Arab American students asking that the State Board of Education

05:42:56.380 --> 05:43:01.660
must vote no on the current ESMC. Instead we are asking for them to re-insert Arab American

05:43:01.660 --> 05:43:05.740
lessons including Palestine within the Asian American studies section curriculum, restore

05:43:05.740 --> 05:43:09.740
their original guiding values and principles that make ethnic studies the academic discipline it is

05:43:09.740 --> 05:43:14.540
today, and re-insert the key terms and definitions of ethnic studies, scholarship, and pedagogy.

05:43:15.100 --> 05:43:19.180
The anti-Asian sentiment and need for being anti-racist has been centerfold currently.

05:43:19.180 --> 05:43:23.740
We address violence, vote upon our communities, upon histories, and critical analysis through

05:43:23.740 --> 05:43:29.260
education, especially public education. Can you imagine what creating a forward picture of

05:43:29.260 --> 05:43:34.700
ethnic studies is on curriculum? Being the entry point for our youth can do to influence not just

05:43:34.700 --> 05:43:39.180
how someone thinks, but how they act. Please think about the current events that unfolded.

05:43:39.900 --> 05:43:45.020
The violence has to end and I fully believe as a student, as someone that's spoken as a kid about

05:43:47.020 --> 05:43:52.060
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:44:04.860 --> 05:44:13.580
Wonderful. I just wanted to ask all of you kind people who have done. Hello. Yes. Caller, if you

05:44:13.580 --> 05:44:18.780
have a secondary device with the meeting, please turn down the volume. We're getting a lot of

05:44:18.780 --> 05:44:27.180
feedback. Okay. Give me 10 seconds to take care of that. Okay. Is this better? Yes. Thank you.

05:44:27.180 --> 05:44:35.020
Your time starts now. Okay. Thank you so much. I really wanted to ask all of you who are in

05:44:35.020 --> 05:44:42.620
positions of power, and this is a very powerful position that you're holding to really consider

05:44:42.620 --> 05:44:52.060
your legacy. Do you want to perpetuate more hate or do you want to create more unity? I hope you

05:44:52.060 --> 05:44:58.620
will do everything in your power only to bring about good for the state of California

05:44:59.660 --> 05:45:06.940
and love and appreciation for one human being to another. The best way to do that, I think,

05:45:07.580 --> 05:45:20.940
is to foster unity and not divisiveness. Please, please do put the anti-Semitism alongside

05:45:20.940 --> 05:45:31.340
Islamophobia. That's where it deserves to be. And please also eliminate all anti-Israel sentiments

05:45:31.340 --> 05:45:37.820
in this curriculum. Thank you so very much. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

05:46:08.140 --> 05:46:12.220
at Bonita Vista High School in San Diego, California. Although I'm grateful for the

05:46:12.220 --> 05:46:16.860
work that has been done to revise the curriculum from its original draft, more changes are needed.

05:46:16.860 --> 05:46:22.460
I urge you to include the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism and reject pressure to remove it.

05:46:22.460 --> 05:46:27.100
This definition reflects lived experiences of Jewish students like myself and is being used

05:46:27.100 --> 05:46:32.300
by the Biden administration. It does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that

05:46:32.300 --> 05:46:37.660
hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world. The definition of Islamophobia

05:46:37.660 --> 05:46:42.140
is mentioned in the Asian American section of the curriculum and has every single right to be there.

05:46:42.140 --> 05:46:48.780
Therefore, there is no reason why anti-Semitism isn't just as important to mention. I also urge

05:46:48.780 --> 05:46:54.140
you to not retract the line edit 100 of the model curriculum. Keep the Jews at the Asian

05:46:54.140 --> 05:46:59.660
section of the curriculum. Please make this change, these changes, for the sake of California

05:46:59.660 --> 05:47:06.220
students. Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

Hi, my name is Allison Bell. I'm calling on behalf of Viet Rise in Orange County. As a community

05:47:30.780 --> 05:47:34.940
organization of Vietnamese refugees, child refugees, and immigrants, we stand in solidarity

05:47:34.940 --> 05:47:41.100
with Palestine and unequivocally calling you to vote no on the current ESMC. We're calling

05:47:41.100 --> 05:47:46.940
you to vote no because ESMC needs to be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color to, one,

05:47:46.940 --> 05:47:51.340
reinsert Arab American lessons, including Palestine, within the Asian American studies

05:47:51.340 --> 05:47:56.620
section of the ethnic studies model curriculum with content and pedagogy developed by Arab

05:47:56.620 --> 05:48:01.980
American educators and true to the discipline of ethnic studies. Palestine is an intrinsic

05:48:01.980 --> 05:48:06.220
part of Arab American history and has been central to the international perspective at

05:48:06.220 --> 05:48:11.820
the root of ethnic studies as a discipline from its roots in the late 1960s. Second, restore the

05:48:11.820 --> 05:48:17.100
original guiding values and principles that make ethnic studies the academic discipline it is today.

05:48:17.100 --> 05:48:21.980
And third, reinsert the key terms and definitions aligned with ethnic study scholarship and

05:48:21.980 --> 05:48:27.420
pedagogy and correct erroneous information about ethnic studies. Ethnic studies is necessary to

05:48:27.420 --> 05:48:35.740
fight against white supremacy and institutionalized erasure. Next caller, please state your name and

Day of Rides in Orange County, California. I'm calling to urge you to vote no on the current

05:49:03.900 --> 05:49:08.140
curriculum and for it to be rewritten by ethnic studies educators of color. With the rise in

05:49:08.140 --> 05:49:11.980
anti-Asian violence surging through our communities, one of the biggest reasons why this violence

05:49:11.980 --> 05:49:15.740
continues to happen is the erasure, lack of education, and true histories of our communities

05:49:15.740 --> 05:49:20.220
of color. This current draft perpetuates an incorrect and dangerous version of history,

05:49:20.220 --> 05:49:23.900
so enough to run further violence would be complicit in the history and the erasure and

05:49:23.900 --> 05:49:28.060
violent attacks in our communities. It is a thermophobic, it has marginalized Arab history

05:49:28.060 --> 05:49:32.220
and Arab people, and it is anti-Black. On behalf of my organization, I'm demanding that the ethnic

05:49:32.220 --> 05:49:37.180
studies curriculum be rewritten to insert Arab American lessons, including Palestine, within the

05:49:37.180 --> 05:49:41.260
Asian American Studies section of the curriculum. I call on you to restore the original guiding

05:49:41.260 --> 05:49:45.500
values and principles that make ethnic studies academic discipline needed today, and I call on

05:49:45.500 --> 05:49:49.340
you to reinsert the key terms and definitions aligned with ethnic studies, scholarship, and

05:49:49.340 --> 05:49:53.340
pedagogy. Anything less would be an attack on our communities, and I urge you to vote no.

05:49:54.780 --> 05:50:01.180
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:50:04.060 --> 05:50:08.860
Hello, can you hear me? Yes, please proceed. My name is Mahmoud Erekat, and I'm an Arab

05:50:08.860 --> 05:50:12.620
resources and organizing youth leader. I'm a senior at Westmore High School, and as a Palestinian,

05:50:12.620 --> 05:50:16.380
I believe in dignity and liberation of all oppressed people. This curriculum goes against

05:50:16.380 --> 05:50:19.900
all of that. The curriculum doesn't center the experience of youth of color. It completely

05:50:19.900 --> 05:50:24.220
erases Arab and Palestinian history. The critical edge of ethnic studies has been sanitized by

05:50:24.220 --> 05:50:29.420
removing critical ethnic studies, such as revolution, right-wing, capitalism, and even

05:50:29.420 --> 05:50:34.380
ethnic studies from key sections. Palestine is an interesting part of Arab American history,

05:50:34.380 --> 05:50:38.220
and has been central to the international perspectives at the rule of ethnic studies

05:50:38.220 --> 05:50:43.260
as a discipline from its roots in the late 1960s. The actions of the CDE marginalize Arab history

05:50:43.260 --> 05:50:47.180
and Arab people. The actions mirror the racist policies of the Trump administration and the

05:50:47.180 --> 05:50:57.420
shameful history of anti-air racism. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

05:50:57.420 --> 05:51:01.820
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:51:07.820 --> 05:51:12.620

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:51:27.020 --> 05:51:28.060
Yes, go ahead, please.

05:51:31.580 --> 05:51:37.340
Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay. Just go ahead. All right. My name is Yasmin,

05:51:37.340 --> 05:51:45.900
and I'm a teacher and a parent from Irvine. The AAPI community consists of about 15 ethnic groups

05:51:45.900 --> 05:51:50.380
with over 100 languages. That's the breadth of the sample lessons in the AAPI

05:51:50.940 --> 05:51:58.780
section of Chapter 4. It's critical for the relevance of the ESMMC in local communities.

05:51:58.780 --> 05:52:04.220
With the rise in anti-Asian violence and xenophobia, now is the time to say yes to enabling

05:52:04.220 --> 05:52:09.100
our students to build bridges and connections through ethnic studies. I highly encourage you

05:52:09.100 --> 05:52:14.620
to add lesson plans from Pakistani American and Bangladeshi American ethnic studies.

05:52:16.780 --> 05:52:25.020
Into the main curriculum under the Asian studies. I feel that all ethnic groups should be included.

05:52:25.740 --> 05:52:32.940
Otherwise, it's not a complete one. Thank you for listening. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

05:52:32.940 --> 05:52:37.100

05:52:37.100 --> 05:52:49.340
Once again, callers, if you are on the line, this is the public comment line. Please hang

05:52:49.340 --> 05:52:55.420
up and listen to the webcast if you just would like to listen to the meeting. Next caller,

05:52:55.420 --> 05:52:59.580
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:52:59.580 --> 05:53:07.420
My name is Sally Tamayo Lee. I organize San Francisco students rising and I'm a student

05:53:07.420 --> 05:53:11.980
at the College of San Francisco. I'm a proud Asian American product of public schools

05:53:13.020 --> 05:53:16.700
in California and my aunt fought for and implemented the College of Ethnic Studies

05:53:16.700 --> 05:53:23.100
at SS State in 1969. We see what happens when history is not taught from the standpoint of

05:53:23.100 --> 05:53:28.540
the systematically oppressed. We get something like the attacks on the D.C. Capitol on January

05:53:28.540 --> 05:53:33.500
6th. While I personally see that day as a funeral for white supremacy, I know it derives from

05:53:33.500 --> 05:53:38.380
generations and generations of people in America told a very different narrative, a lie in their

05:53:38.380 --> 05:53:43.900
schools about the history of genocide, imperialism, and slavery and who was responsible for those

05:53:43.900 --> 05:53:49.660
atrocities and that oppression. Maintain ethnic studies as a pedagogy of the oppressed. Vote no

05:53:49.660 --> 05:53:55.020
on this version of ESMC. I'm also in a thread with a hundred other people on this call. We're

05:53:55.020 --> 05:53:59.500
tightening ourselves and know you're cutting us off, so please stop that. It's deeply disrespectful

05:53:59.500 --> 05:54:07.980
to the democratic process. Thank you, caller. Again, callers, we appreciate your patience. There

05:54:07.980 --> 05:54:15.020
have been many people wanting to comment, so thank you. Next caller, please state your name

05:54:15.020 --> 05:54:24.140
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. My name is Tony Ubaldi. I'm president of

05:54:24.140 --> 05:54:30.460
Vallejo's Unified School District. I urge the State Board of Education to approve ethnic study

05:54:30.460 --> 05:54:36.860
model curriculum today to benefit all students in California. Ethnic Studies course is designed to

05:54:36.860 --> 05:54:42.300
give high school students an introduction to the experiences of ethnic communities that are rarely

05:54:42.300 --> 05:54:48.060
represented in the textbooks. It is also a compelling way to examine race, ethnicity,

05:54:48.060 --> 05:54:53.340
nationality, social economics, and cultural groups in the United States. The course equips

05:54:53.340 --> 05:54:58.860
students with critical lens to see the world and their place in it by understanding systems and

05:54:58.860 --> 05:55:04.460
power at the root of American society and has goals to motivate students to actively engage

05:55:04.460 --> 05:55:09.740
in their democracy. To the Ethnic Studies course, students are supported to discover and use their

05:55:09.740 --> 05:55:15.500
own power for the benefit of not only themselves, but also that of their community and society at

05:55:15.500 --> 05:55:21.020
large. I urge the State Board of Education to approve the ethnic studies model curriculum today.

05:55:21.660 --> 05:55:27.180
Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:55:56.460 --> 05:56:02.540
Hi there. My name is Polly Olavi and I'm a student residing at California and UCLA,

05:56:02.540 --> 05:56:07.980
and I just want to say no to the Ethnic Studies curriculum because it creates the complete

05:56:07.980 --> 05:56:13.740
erasure of Jewish identity with a lack of representation. I just want to say that it

05:56:13.740 --> 05:56:18.860
should be going under Asian studies next to our Arab brothers and sisters. I feel as though there

05:56:18.860 --> 05:56:27.900
is a lack of just word on Judaism and Israel and the indigenous roots of our people, and we're

05:56:27.900 --> 05:56:35.260
extremely scared on campuses right now because the main consensus is anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism

05:56:35.260 --> 05:56:40.780
has become the norm, and I just want to say that it's making me scared. It's making other students

05:56:40.780 --> 05:56:46.300
scared, and it's as early as middle school that people are being taught these values that are

05:56:46.300 --> 05:56:52.540
just anti-Semitic and anti-Israel, which subsequently creates anti-Semitic rhetoric on

05:56:52.540 --> 05:56:58.460
campuses. Just disguised as progressivism. Please do something about this. Please, as a Jewish

05:56:58.460 --> 05:57:03.260
student and a colored person, I have no space. Thank you, caller. Your time starts now.

05:57:04.620 --> 05:57:10.220
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your

05:57:10.220 --> 05:57:18.140
time starts now. My name is Fayaz, and I serve as the Policy and Advocacy Manager at CARE LA.

05:57:18.860 --> 05:57:25.340
I am calling for the board to reject the current ESDSMC because of the erasure of Palestine and

05:57:25.340 --> 05:57:31.100
Arab-American studies. I urge the CDE and Palestine and the Arab-American studies within the Asian

05:57:31.100 --> 05:57:37.260
American curriculum plan. I also urge that the curriculum be created by ethnic studies experts.

05:57:37.260 --> 05:57:44.220
Once again, I urge the board to vote no on the current ESSD. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

05:57:44.220 --> 05:57:48.060
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:57:52.940 --> 05:57:57.740

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:58:14.540 --> 05:58:19.340
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:58:19.340 --> 05:58:29.580
Hi, my name is Lisa, and I'm a student at UCLA. I'm calling for the board to vote no on the ethnic

05:58:29.580 --> 05:58:34.620
studies curriculum. Jews are a minority and antisemitic acts continue to rise. My Jewish

05:58:34.620 --> 05:58:40.700
ancestors and history should be included as well. First, please include the full IHRA definition

05:58:40.700 --> 05:58:50.380
of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. Second, the IHRA definition does not prevent

05:58:50.380 --> 05:58:55.340
criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California

05:58:55.340 --> 05:59:00.780
and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast majority of Jews

05:59:00.780 --> 05:59:07.900
agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into antisemitism. Lastly, please keep

05:59:07.900 --> 05:59:12.700
all the guidelines for critical thinking in chapter one and repeat them throughout the curriculum,

05:59:12.700 --> 05:59:19.100
just like the language about values and outcomes. We need critical thinking not just one side to call

05:59:19.100 --> 05:59:25.180
political agendas. Please make these revisions today for the sake of our students. Thank you.

05:59:25.180 --> 05:59:29.740
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:59:29.740 --> 05:59:31.180
Your time starts now.

05:59:31.180 --> 05:59:39.740
Hi, my name is Ilan Abiy and I'm a Persian American and I'm standing up for the rights of our ethnic

05:59:39.740 --> 05:59:47.980
people to be valued as an ethnic ancestral minority who took place in Judea. Erasing this only warps

05:59:47.980 --> 05:59:56.060
the truth. Jews are subject to higher than normal ethnic racism and by targeting this and trying to

05:59:56.060 --> 06:00:02.700
make a false dichotomy between Arabs and Jews is hurtful to peace. So we need to wake up and

06:00:02.700 --> 06:00:08.220
solve the truth. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

06:00:08.220 --> 06:00:15.820
for the record. Your time starts now. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, please proceed.

06:00:17.020 --> 06:00:21.660
My name is Farida Erekat and I'm a former student at UC Irvine and a member of the Palestinian

06:00:21.660 --> 06:00:26.780
youth movement. We must vote no on the current ESMC curriculum which constitutes the censorship

06:00:26.780 --> 06:00:30.700
and whitewashing of the history of Arab Americans which is reflected in part by the erasure of

06:00:30.700 --> 06:00:34.620
Palestine from the curriculum within the Asian American study section of the ethnic studies

06:00:34.620 --> 06:00:38.540
model curriculum. Removal of terms such as capitalism and revolution reflects the clear

06:00:38.540 --> 06:00:43.020
desire to ignore the systems of power and control rooted in white supremacy and colonialism that are

06:00:43.020 --> 06:00:47.660
inherent in our society. The swattered down version of ethnic studies effectively silences

06:00:47.660 --> 06:00:50.540
students of color and deprives them of their rights to learn and actively engage with their

06:00:50.540 --> 06:00:54.780
histories which reinforces the status quo of white dominance. The argument that critical race

06:00:54.780 --> 06:00:59.740
theory creates a bifausal environment for white students urges us to ignore infrastructural racism

06:00:59.740 --> 06:01:03.580
and power imbalances at the expense of students of color in order to preserve these inequities,

06:01:03.580 --> 06:01:07.980
ignore the reality that history is already biased in favor of these oppressive structures.

06:01:07.980 --> 06:01:12.780
In crafting the curriculum, the SDE must under the voice of Arab American educators by utilizing

06:01:12.780 --> 06:01:19.020
content pedagogy developed by them. Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name

06:01:19.020 --> 06:01:29.740
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now. Hello. Do you hear me? Yes, please proceed.

06:01:30.300 --> 06:01:37.100
Okay. My name is Alan Fisher. I live in San Mateo County. My two sons now in their 30s are graduates

06:01:37.100 --> 06:01:43.260
of California high schools. I have carefully read the latest draft of the ESMC. I commended

06:01:43.260 --> 06:01:48.140
substantial improvement over the initial version but I am concerned that its goals still reflect

06:01:48.940 --> 06:01:55.340
underlying ideology of critical race theory and critical ethnic studies. I value an ethnic studies

06:01:55.340 --> 06:01:59.900
curriculum that exposes students from various backgrounds to the histories and personal stories

06:01:59.900 --> 06:02:05.580
of their peers to enhance mutual understanding in our diverse state and as chapter one states,

06:02:05.580 --> 06:02:11.100
to help build bridges of intergroup understanding. However, the chapter goes on to list six goals

06:02:11.100 --> 06:02:16.060
that are heavy on jargon and go beyond teaching concepts to the promotion of race-centered

06:02:16.060 --> 06:02:22.060
activism in a way that magnifies differences among groups. I understand the impatience to

06:02:22.060 --> 06:02:26.540
finally approve a curriculum but getting this right is more important than getting it today.

06:02:26.540 --> 06:02:31.740
Please replace the ideological agenda of critical ethnic studies with a more balanced approach.

06:02:31.740 --> 06:02:36.460
Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:02:36.460 --> 06:02:40.860
Hi, can you hear me?

06:02:42.860 --> 06:02:48.540
Hello. Yes, next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

06:02:48.540 --> 06:02:55.980
now. Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear me? Hi, my name is Arshia Mousti. I'm an educator.

06:02:56.940 --> 06:03:04.060
I thank, I really thank the school board members for doing what they're doing. The AAPI community

06:03:04.060 --> 06:03:11.020
consists of more than 50 ethnic groups with over 100 languages. Thus, the breadth of sample lessons

06:03:11.020 --> 06:03:18.940
in the AAPI section of chapter four is critical for the relevance of ESMC in local communities.

06:03:19.660 --> 06:03:25.100
I highly encourage you to add lesson plans for Pakistani American and Bangladeshi American

06:03:25.100 --> 06:03:33.820
ethnic studies. We need to be all inclusive to do justice to this program. Thank you very much.

06:03:34.780 --> 06:03:39.580
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:03:45.180 --> 06:03:51.340
Hi, can you hear me okay? Yes, please proceed. Thank you. Hello, my name is Marianne Mejia Leoni.

06:03:51.340 --> 06:03:57.260
I'm a first generation Hispanic American, a mother of a child in California, also previously a teacher,

06:03:57.260 --> 06:04:01.980
now work for a corporation. I would like to strike this down and please vote no. I believe this is

06:04:01.980 --> 06:04:07.100
a sham. It's very shameful. It's clear indoctrination. This is a, this has a Marxist

06:04:07.100 --> 06:04:12.300
narrative to it, moving our country closer to a communist country. So again, I would request

06:04:12.300 --> 06:04:17.820
that you please vote no. Do not adopt this. Thank you for your time. Thank you, speaker.

06:04:17.820 --> 06:04:22.700
Next speaker, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:04:22.700 --> 06:04:32.700
Hi there. My name is Kate Chavez and I'm a Hispanic Jew. I attended an LAUSD school and I'm a proud

06:04:32.700 --> 06:04:37.340
first generation product of the California State University system. First, I'd like to say thank

06:04:37.340 --> 06:04:43.660
you for positive steps. However, there are still shortcomings. Please include the full IHRA definition

06:04:43.660 --> 06:04:50.140
of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition reflects the real life experiences

06:04:50.220 --> 06:04:55.020
of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration. The IHRA definition does not prevent

06:04:55.020 --> 06:05:00.220
criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California

06:05:00.220 --> 06:05:05.500
and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast majority of Jews

06:05:05.500 --> 06:05:11.340
agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into antisemitism. Second, please keep

06:05:11.340 --> 06:05:16.060
all the guidelines for critical thinking in chapter one and repeat them throughout the curriculum,

06:05:16.060 --> 06:05:22.860
just like the language about values and outcomes. Lastly, please do not retract line edit number 100.

06:05:22.860 --> 06:05:27.980
Please make sure these revisions happen today for the sake of all of our students. Thank you so much.

06:05:28.940 --> 06:05:34.060
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

06:05:34.060 --> 06:05:40.860
starts now. Hi, my name is Fanny Wellman and I'm a parent of two Jewish students enrolled in California

06:05:40.860 --> 06:05:46.220
high schools in San Diego. I'm very grateful for all the work that you have done, but there are still

06:05:46.220 --> 06:05:52.460
more changes that need to be made. I urge you to include the full IHRA definition of antisemitism

06:05:52.460 --> 06:05:57.740
and reject pressures to remove it. This definition reflects the lived experiences of Jewish students

06:05:57.740 --> 06:06:02.300
and is being used by the Biden administration. It does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply

06:06:02.300 --> 06:06:06.460
acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world.

06:06:06.940 --> 06:06:10.300
A definition of islamophobia is mentioned in the Asian American section

06:06:11.020 --> 06:06:15.820
of the curriculum and has every right to be there. Therefore, there's no reason why antisemitism

06:06:15.820 --> 06:06:20.860
isn't just as important to mention. I also urge you not to retract line edit number 100 of the

06:06:20.860 --> 06:06:36.060
model curriculum. Please make these changes for the sake of California students. Thank you.

06:06:36.460 --> 06:06:50.700
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:06:55.420 --> 06:07:00.140
Hi, my name is Carla Schiff. I'm a Jewish queer educator for over 30 years.

06:07:00.860 --> 06:07:04.700
I, along with thousands of community members, demand that you vote no on this current

06:07:04.700 --> 06:07:10.220
watered down version of the curriculum. This version bears no resemblance to ethnic studies.

06:07:10.220 --> 06:07:14.860
It is like a body that has been operated on by a doctor and returned with its heart cut out.

06:07:15.900 --> 06:07:20.620
The removal of key ethnic study guidelines and of key vocabulary such as racism

06:07:20.620 --> 06:07:25.980
and the inclusion of a definition of antisemitism as criticism of Israel underscores how right wing

06:07:25.980 --> 06:07:32.140
Zionist organizations took control of a public process cutting out ethnic studies experts and

06:07:32.140 --> 06:07:37.100
communities of color. A pedagogy of hope presented by Powell Ferry would give two

06:07:37.100 --> 06:07:41.100
to those facing racism and colonialism to find a path to liberation.

06:07:43.820 --> 06:07:48.300
Thank you. Arab American studies with Palestine is an essential part of a

06:07:48.300 --> 06:07:51.340
resistance narrative to colonial injustice and violence.

06:07:55.500 --> 06:08:00.860
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

06:08:00.860 --> 06:08:12.220
starts now. Hi, my name is Jennifer Carlin and I am a senior in a California public high school

06:08:12.220 --> 06:08:16.940
and I urge for the ethnic studies model curriculum to protect Jewish students and do better

06:08:16.940 --> 06:08:21.660
to address the history and persecution that the Jewish people have faced to prevent it from

06:08:21.660 --> 06:08:26.220
happening on a daily basis. As I have a friend in the California public school system who was

06:08:26.220 --> 06:08:30.620
called antisemitic swears in 2021 and the administration did nothing about it.

06:08:31.580 --> 06:08:36.060
How can we prevent bigoted antisemitic attacks like this if we do not first acknowledge it in

06:08:36.060 --> 06:08:40.940
the classroom and teach it? Antisemitism can only be stopped if we address it in its totality.

06:08:41.500 --> 06:08:46.700
Therefore, include the full IHRE definition of antisemitism and approve all changes requested

06:08:46.700 --> 06:08:52.780
by Jimena to include the lesson plan in the Asian American student study section and do not retract

06:08:52.780 --> 06:08:57.660
line edit 100. Protect Jewish students and all ethnic minorities and do not let history,

06:08:57.660 --> 06:09:01.980
the history of my people repeat itself. For the sake of California students, I urge you to do this.

06:09:01.980 --> 06:09:07.420
Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:09:07.420 --> 06:09:16.700
Your time starts now. Hi, good morning. I am Kiyom Nishoki, a first year student at UC Santa Barbara.

06:09:17.500 --> 06:09:22.780
My parents were both immigrants who left Iran about 32 years ago under strict religious

06:09:22.780 --> 06:09:28.940
persecution and the same thing happened to my grandfather at Linky Rock. I have seen antisemitism

06:09:28.940 --> 06:09:35.420
come across my path and so many of my friends and family have. All I ask is that this curriculum

06:09:36.060 --> 06:09:42.140
makes all students feel inclusive and feel like they belong to the world and California

06:09:42.620 --> 06:09:48.860
and that all ethnicities are being understood and heard. With that, I ask that you approve all

06:09:48.860 --> 06:09:55.340
changes requested by Jimena and move their lesson plan to the Asian American study section. That

06:09:55.340 --> 06:10:00.940
section rightfully addresses the law of homophobia, but sadly, it doesn't give you the crucial lesson

06:10:00.940 --> 06:10:07.100
about antisemitism. Additionally, I ask that you do not retract the line edit to number 100.

06:10:08.060 --> 06:10:13.580
And lastly, I ask you to include the full IHRA definition of antisemitism.

06:10:16.700 --> 06:10:21.820
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

06:10:24.940 --> 06:10:29.900
Hi, my name is Shirin Yadigar. I'm a mother of four children in the LA Unified School District.

06:10:29.900 --> 06:10:34.540
Quite frankly, I'm appalled to hear all the antisemitic rhetoric I've been hearing all afternoon.

06:10:34.540 --> 06:10:40.540
I cannot believe my ears. I'm calling today, first, please include the full IHRA definition

06:10:40.540 --> 06:10:45.900
of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. This pressure is unwarranted. This definition

06:10:45.900 --> 06:10:51.180
reflects the real life experiences of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration.

06:10:51.820 --> 06:10:57.900
The IHRA definition does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech

06:10:57.900 --> 06:11:03.020
about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today,

06:11:03.020 --> 06:11:07.980
polls show the vast majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes causes the line

06:11:07.980 --> 06:11:13.180
into antisemitism. Second, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in Chapter 1

06:11:13.180 --> 06:11:17.340
and repeat them throughout the curriculum, just like the language about values and outcomes.

06:11:17.340 --> 06:11:22.780
We need critical thinking, not one-sided political agendas and hate in our classrooms. Lastly,

06:11:22.780 --> 06:11:27.500
please do not retract line edit number 100. Please make sure that these are the same.

06:11:28.140 --> 06:11:34.140

My name is Malina Farajuni. I'm a student from Woodland Hills, California. I'm a child of immigrants

06:11:53.900 --> 06:11:58.380
from Iran. While I appreciate all the work to revise the ESMC, I urge you to make further

06:11:58.380 --> 06:12:03.580
changes and resist pressure to make the curriculum worse. First, please include the full IHRA

06:12:03.580 --> 06:12:08.700
definition of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition reflects the real life

06:12:08.700 --> 06:12:14.220
experiences of Jews students and is being used by the Biden administration. The IHRA definition

06:12:14.220 --> 06:12:18.700
does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms

06:12:18.700 --> 06:12:23.420
Jews in California and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today, polls show the vast

06:12:23.420 --> 06:12:27.980
majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the line into antisemitism.

06:12:28.540 --> 06:12:32.700
Second, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in chapter 1 and repeat them

06:12:32.700 --> 06:12:36.940
throughout the curriculum, just like the language about values and outcomes. We need critical

06:12:36.940 --> 06:12:42.060
thinking, not one-sided political agendas and hate in our classrooms. Lastly, please do not retract

06:12:42.060 --> 06:12:48.300
line edit number 100. Please make these revisions today for the sake of our students. Thank you.

Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

starts now. Hello, my name is Elena Maya and I'm a parent of two Jewish students involved in

06:13:01.740 --> 06:13:05.820
California High School in San Diego. Although I am grateful for the work that has been done to

06:13:05.820 --> 06:13:11.020
revise the curriculum form, its original draft, more changes are needed. I urge you to include

06:13:11.020 --> 06:13:16.780
the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition

06:13:16.780 --> 06:13:21.660
reflects the lived experiences of Jewish students like me and is being used by the Biden

06:13:21.660 --> 06:13:25.500
administration. It does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that the hate

06:13:25.500 --> 06:13:30.540
speech about Israel harms Jews in California and around the world. A definition of Islamophobia

06:13:30.540 --> 06:13:35.180
is mentioned in the Asian-American section of the curriculum and has every single right to be there.

06:13:35.820 --> 06:13:40.620
Therefore, there is no reason why antisemitism isn't just as important to mention. I also urge

06:13:40.620 --> 06:13:46.380
you not to retract line edit number 100 of the model curriculum. Keep Jews, the Asian section

06:13:46.380 --> 06:13:51.020
of the curriculum. Please make this change, these changes for the sake of California students.

06:13:51.020 --> 06:13:56.540
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now. Hello, my name is Lada Kiswani and I'm a faculty member in the College

06:14:06.300 --> 06:14:11.340
of Ethnic Studies. I would just like to say that this is an insult to all the legacy of the 1968

06:14:11.340 --> 06:14:16.300
strike veterans. That is why they oppose this curriculum as do all writers of the original

06:14:16.300 --> 06:14:22.060
Ethnic Studies model curriculum and experts like Cornel West and Angela Davis. As Arabs, as people

06:14:22.060 --> 06:14:27.340
of color, you've erased us, displaced us, relegated us to an appendix and whitewashed the entire

06:14:27.340 --> 06:14:32.060
curriculum. You've allowed those who have historically benefited from racial hierarchies

06:14:32.060 --> 06:14:37.660
to define a discipline intended on eradicating racism. I hope none of your children have to

06:14:37.740 --> 06:14:43.180
experience what we as Arab youth, as Arab communities have witnessed today, including

06:14:43.180 --> 06:14:48.300
people of color. They are way too smart for this nonsense and deserve better. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Sarah Tanagasa and I'm a Pacific Studies, Ethnic Studies educator in San

06:15:00.540 --> 06:15:04.300
Francisco. Unfortunately, due to language removal and the drift from Ethnic Studies

06:15:04.380 --> 06:15:09.260
guiding principles, this current document in its entirety is not Ethnic Studies. To remove critiques

06:15:09.260 --> 06:15:13.740
of systems of oppression, including capitalism, and to silence Palestinian histories and content

06:15:13.740 --> 06:15:18.300
among other changes that are reflected in this draft, demonstrate a lack of commitment to Ethnic

06:15:18.300 --> 06:15:23.100
Studies as a field, its history, its power, its possibilities. There is growing evidence that

06:15:23.100 --> 06:15:31.420
Ethnic Studies courses have positive impacts on student outcomes. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

Hi, my name is Kayla Globerson and I am the project manager for the San Diego Jewish Teen

06:15:42.140 --> 06:15:47.980
Initiative. While I appreciate all the work to revise the ESMC, I urge you to make further

06:15:47.980 --> 06:15:53.900
changes and resist pressure to make the curriculum worse. First, please include the full IHRA

06:15:53.900 --> 06:15:59.500
definition of antisemitism and reject pressure to remove it. This definition reflects the real life

06:15:59.500 --> 06:16:05.740
experiences of Jewish students and is being used by the Biden administration. The IHRA definition

06:16:05.740 --> 06:16:12.060
does not prevent criticism of Israel. It simply acknowledges that hate speech about Israel harms

06:16:12.060 --> 06:16:16.460
Jews in California and around the world. Regardless of what you may hear today,

06:16:16.460 --> 06:16:21.500
polls show that the vast majority of Jews agree that anti-Israel rhetoric sometimes crosses the

06:16:21.500 --> 06:16:26.780
line into antisemitism. Second, please keep all the guidelines for critical thinking in Chapter 1

Hi, my name is Mohammed Erta. I'm a junior at Bahala High School and a contributing writer at Arab

06:16:57.340 --> 06:17:02.700
America Organization. As a Palestinian, I believe in dignity and liberation of all oppressed people.

06:17:02.700 --> 06:17:07.180
This curriculum goes against all of that. The curriculum doesn't center the experience of

06:17:07.180 --> 06:17:12.220
youth of color. It completely erases Arab and Palestinian history. The critical edge of ethnic

06:17:12.220 --> 06:17:17.740
studies has been sanitized by removing critical ethnic studies in terms like revolution, right-wing,

06:17:17.740 --> 06:17:22.060
capitalism, and even ethnic studies from key sections. Palestine is an important part of

06:17:22.060 --> 06:17:26.140
Arab American history and has been central to the international perspective at the rule of

06:17:26.140 --> 06:17:31.180
ethnic studies as a distinct from truth in the late 1960s. The actions of C.D.E. marginalized

06:17:31.180 --> 06:17:35.740
Arab history and Arab people. The actions mirror the racist policies of the Trump administration

06:17:35.740 --> 06:17:41.580
and the shameful history of anti-Arab racism. Thank you. Thank you, caller. Next caller,

06:18:03.420 --> 06:18:16.220
Hi. I just wanted to comment about this whole curriculum and everything. California K through

06:18:16.220 --> 06:18:26.300
12 schools are failing in academics also. I know the ethnics is important, but this seems like

06:18:26.300 --> 06:18:33.980
very bad timing to force this on the American people. American and California parents especially

06:18:33.980 --> 06:18:41.260
are waking up to what is going on. So just to let you know that and we don't need our kids to be

06:18:41.260 --> 06:18:50.540
taught how racist our country is or is not. It's not the role of the school system. Thank you.

Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

This concludes public comment.

06:19:11.900 --> 06:19:17.740
Thank you so much. Before we launch into board discussion, I think we need to take a little bit

06:19:17.740 --> 06:19:27.820
of a break, get ourselves refreshed so that we can engage with all of our brain. It is 325.

06:19:28.380 --> 06:19:35.740
Let's take 15 minutes and come back at 340 and we'll start our board discussion at that time.

06:19:41.420 --> 06:19:49.100
340. Yes, let's take a 15 minute break. See you at 340.

06:19:56.300 --> 06:20:03.660
All right. We are back and I want to thank all the stakeholders who took time to call in today.

06:20:04.380 --> 06:20:11.580
We've heard many, many views about the curriculum. Most of the comments.

06:20:12.940 --> 06:20:16.060
I'm so sorry to interrupt, but I believe we need to reestablish the quorum.

06:20:16.940 --> 06:20:24.540
Oh, thank you. Let's reestablish our quorum. Thank you. Member Burr. Here. President Darling-Hammond.

06:20:24.540 --> 06:20:33.420
Here. Member Patel. Here. Member Glover-Woods. Here. Member McQuillan.

Here. Member Rucker. Here. Vice President Strauss. Here. Member Son. Here. Member Quong.

06:20:54.940 --> 06:21:04.220
Terrific. I was about to say that we've heard many questions and comments about the curriculum,

06:21:04.780 --> 06:21:10.140
many of which were considered by the IQC and by the CDE staff, and I'm sure they would be

06:21:10.940 --> 06:21:18.300
pleased to answer questions that you may have about specifics that were raised in the comments.

06:21:18.940 --> 06:21:28.620
I've heard a number of people say don't pass the Ethnic Studies curriculum yet, but I will remind

06:21:29.500 --> 06:21:36.140
everyone on the board that we have a statutory expectation that the curriculum will be adopted

06:21:36.140 --> 06:21:43.900
in whatever form it is to be adopted by March 31st, so there is a time frame that I wanted

06:21:43.900 --> 06:21:49.740
everyone to be sure you are aware of. I also would just like to start us off with a couple

06:21:49.740 --> 06:21:55.580
of comments. You know, the passion that we hear about this topic illustrates why Ethnic Studies

06:21:55.580 --> 06:22:01.980
is so important. Much of what we hear is the quest by each person and group for a sense of

06:22:01.980 --> 06:22:08.380
belonging and acknowledgement and affirmation of personhood and of the struggles each has been

06:22:08.380 --> 06:22:14.460
through. Belonging is the most fundamental human need, and that is part of what Ethnic Studies

06:22:14.460 --> 06:22:20.940
offers. It's a way to acknowledge the experiences of individuals within their cultural context

06:22:20.940 --> 06:22:27.500
and to embrace, rather than fearing or punishing, diversity. At the same time,

06:22:28.380 --> 06:22:35.020
Ethnic Studies demands that we understand the forces that stand in the way of our shared humanity

06:22:35.020 --> 06:22:40.540
so that we can address them. We need the more complete study of our history that Ethnic Studies

06:22:40.540 --> 06:22:46.140
provides and the intention to inequality that it stimulates. And this is where the issues we've

06:22:46.140 --> 06:22:53.820
been hearing about regarding critical race theory come in. This is a concept that is often

06:22:53.820 --> 06:23:00.140
misunderstood as creating divisions among groups or setting people against one another.

06:23:00.780 --> 06:23:06.540
That is not the point or the goal of critical race theory, which as I reread the document,

06:23:06.540 --> 06:23:12.060
I realized was never defined in the document. And so I'm going to offer a definition.

06:23:13.420 --> 06:23:18.940
Critical race theory emerged from critical legal studies that have examined how racism has been

06:23:18.940 --> 06:23:26.380
embedded in our laws and policies. It refers to critical thinking about race, not to criticism

06:23:26.380 --> 06:23:33.020
of specific individuals based on their race. An article published by the American Bar Association

06:23:33.020 --> 06:23:39.340
this year defines critical race theory as a practice of interrogating race and racism in

06:23:39.340 --> 06:23:46.220
society. Critical race theory recognizes that race is not biologically real, but is socially

06:23:46.220 --> 06:23:52.860
constructed and socially significant. It acknowledges that racism is embedded within systems

06:23:52.860 --> 06:23:58.860
and institutions that replicate racial inequality, codified in law, embedded in

06:23:58.860 --> 06:24:06.140
structures and woven into public policy. Because there is so much misunderstanding of the concept,

06:24:06.140 --> 06:24:12.060
I will ask that this definition be added as a footnote to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum

06:24:12.060 --> 06:24:17.580
text at the first place where it is mentioned, so that at least we'll have a common understanding

06:24:17.580 --> 06:24:25.020
of what is meant by criticality. If we use this analytic lens, we can see how inequalities we

06:24:25.020 --> 06:24:30.780
still struggle with in our own field of education have been constructed and we can take steps to

06:24:30.780 --> 06:24:37.420
address them. For example, even after the horrific institution of slavery was ended,

06:24:37.420 --> 06:24:42.620
which affected both African Americans and Native Americans in California, the legacy of

06:24:42.700 --> 06:24:48.460
discrimination persisted in Jim Crow laws and school segregation that affected all people of

06:24:48.460 --> 06:24:53.660
color across many states, including our own. While we all know about the Brown versus Board

06:24:53.660 --> 06:25:00.620
of Education lawsuit, Mendez versus Westminster was brought here in California in the 1940s,

06:25:00.620 --> 06:25:05.980
when Sylvia Mendez was turned away from a California public school that identified itself

06:25:05.980 --> 06:25:11.100
as serving whites only. Represented by Thurgood Marshall, who later litigated

06:25:11.100 --> 06:25:16.940
Brown versus Board of Education, the lawsuit addressed legalized segregation in four Los

06:25:16.940 --> 06:25:23.020
Angeles school districts in 1947. But even when schools were officially desegregated,

06:25:23.020 --> 06:25:28.860
de facto segregation continued, reinforced by segregated housing and lending practices,

06:25:28.860 --> 06:25:34.780
also encoded into law and policy, the setting of school district boundaries, and the unequal

06:25:34.780 --> 06:25:39.740
funding system that spent more money on the education of students and wealthier districts

06:25:39.740 --> 06:25:46.460
than on those serving concentrations of students of color. And despite decades of equity litigation

06:25:46.460 --> 06:25:53.260
in which some of us on this board participated, it was not until 2013 that Governor Brown proposed

06:25:53.260 --> 06:25:58.780
in the legislature enacted a more equitable funding formula that begins to redress these

06:25:58.780 --> 06:26:05.500
disparities across school district that are so tightly tied to race. And still to this day,

06:26:05.500 --> 06:26:11.180
California schools are the most segregated in the country with respect to Latinx students,

06:26:11.180 --> 06:26:15.180
and the second most segregated with respect to African American students.

06:26:15.740 --> 06:26:22.540
The 17% of schools that are more than 90% low income in this state are on average also more

06:26:22.540 --> 06:26:29.340
than 95% African American and Latinx. And in these schools, the remaining students are almost

06:26:29.340 --> 06:26:35.180
always Native American and Pacific Islander students. These schools also have four to five

06:26:35.180 --> 06:26:41.100
times as many uncertified teachers as schools that serve few students of color. They are among the

06:26:41.100 --> 06:26:47.020
schools that were most likely to lack computers and connectivity when the pandemic hit. They've

06:26:47.020 --> 06:26:52.620
also been among the schools for many years with the least access to A through G courses, high

06:26:52.620 --> 06:26:58.860
status STEM opportunities, including computer science and quality facilities. And while we

06:26:58.860 --> 06:27:03.900
hear concern every year when test score data come out showing disparities, a critical look

06:27:03.900 --> 06:27:10.700
at law and policy shows how these differentials have been embedded in housing, zoning, and school

06:27:10.700 --> 06:27:17.980
assignment policies that have exacerbated segregation while funding formulas, grant allocation rules,

06:27:17.980 --> 06:27:22.940
and the ways in which we recruit, pay, and treat teachers have distributed resources in ways that

06:27:22.940 --> 06:27:29.340
take advantage of this segregation to maintain inequality. The same inequalities have been rooted

06:27:29.340 --> 06:27:34.220
in school systems that have allocated different curriculum opportunities to different students.

06:27:34.780 --> 06:27:40.380
Since I'm sad to say, Stanford professors Elwood Cumberley and Louis Turman, an early

06:27:40.380 --> 06:27:46.940
eugenicist and IQ test developer, declared that different races had different levels of intelligence

06:27:46.940 --> 06:27:51.500
that should be handled by creating different opportunities to learn that are now codified

06:27:51.500 --> 06:27:57.580
in tracking policies with which I've struggled for my own children who often found themselves

06:27:57.580 --> 06:28:02.700
to be the only black students in honors classes after they've been initially denied entrance to

06:28:02.700 --> 06:28:07.180
them. And I expect to continue the struggle with my grandchildren when they get to school.

06:28:07.900 --> 06:28:13.820
So critical race theory allows us to look for the root causes of these stubborn inequalities

06:28:13.820 --> 06:28:19.500
and address them so that we can finally make progress toward the inclusive equitable society

06:28:19.500 --> 06:28:27.740
we desire. It is not a means to demonize any individual person or race, but a way to find

06:28:27.740 --> 06:28:33.900
the roots of inequality and correct them. 70 years ago in the height of the McCarthy era,

06:28:33.900 --> 06:28:39.980
W.B. Du Bois wrote, of all the civil rights for which the world has struggled and fought for 5,000

06:28:39.980 --> 06:28:47.100
years, the right to learn is undoubtedly the most fundamental. The freedom to learn has been bought

06:28:47.100 --> 06:28:52.220
by bitter sacrifice. And whatever we may think of the curtailment of other civil rights,

06:28:52.220 --> 06:28:57.420
we should fight to the last ditch to keep open the right to learn. And that is what this

06:28:57.420 --> 06:29:03.660
conversation is about. How do we ensure the right to learn for all of our children in ways that

06:29:03.660 --> 06:29:11.340
move us increasingly towards the inclusive diverse society that is a California for all

06:29:12.140 --> 06:29:19.900
and that moves us beyond the places where that promise has been denied.

06:29:20.860 --> 06:29:27.900
With that, I do want to open up board conversation on this topic. I know that our

06:29:27.900 --> 06:29:35.420
members of the CDE staff and of the IQC leadership are still here with us if there are specific

06:29:35.420 --> 06:29:41.980
questions as well as commentary. And looking in the participant queue,

06:29:41.980 --> 06:29:49.100
I see that member Rucker is ready to launch the conversation followed by member Sun.

06:29:53.980 --> 06:30:01.900
You are on mute, Patricia. First of all, Dr. Darling-Hammond, I wanted to thank you

06:30:02.540 --> 06:30:09.020
for taking the time to make the opening statement that you just made, because I also noted the

06:30:09.020 --> 06:30:15.660
number of times, not only today, but in previous conversations, both with the IQC and here at the

06:30:15.660 --> 06:30:22.780
board, that we have heard this critique about the role and the definition of critical race theory

06:30:22.780 --> 06:30:30.060
or how it was being interpreted in the draft curriculum. So I'm glad to see your suggestion

06:30:30.060 --> 06:30:36.460
about crafting this definition into the content. However, I think that it's more important

06:30:36.460 --> 06:30:43.900
not to just have it in the content as a footnote. It may be important for that content to be added

06:30:43.900 --> 06:30:49.500
as a direct part of the main content itself, either as an introduction or in the opening

06:30:49.500 --> 06:30:55.020
chapter or in the opening explanation about the intent of this where it's appropriate.

06:30:55.020 --> 06:31:01.500
I think a footnote becomes just that, a footnote, and it doesn't help us to refine or resolve

06:31:01.500 --> 06:31:08.700
this very critical dispute. I also think it's important to recognize that as we go forward on

06:31:08.700 --> 06:31:14.780
this, you know, in my family, we have this saying that iron sharpens iron, just as one man sharpens

06:31:14.780 --> 06:31:21.340
another. I think that that's what this conversation has done, and that's what this conversation is

06:31:21.340 --> 06:31:27.260
about. And in many ways, the conversations and the dialogue and the discussion and the testimony

06:31:27.260 --> 06:31:33.820
we've heard is an explicit example of how critical race theory works as a conversation, because it

06:31:33.820 --> 06:31:40.380
does these things and allows people to have these conversations to agree, not just to agree to

06:31:40.380 --> 06:31:48.620
disagree, but to really take a look at what their stance is, why it's there, and how to resolve those

06:31:48.700 --> 06:31:54.540
conversations and concerns. So I think it's very important for us to have this discussion.

06:31:54.540 --> 06:32:00.700
It's very important to look at this document as a living document, to understand our intent,

06:32:00.700 --> 06:32:08.540
and to move forward with the effort to create this opportunity and this very important policy.

06:32:11.420 --> 06:32:12.540
Thank you. Member Sun.

06:32:12.540 --> 06:32:19.420
Thank you. I just wanted to comment that I was very inspired by the distinguished guests at the

06:32:20.380 --> 06:32:26.700
very outset of this item who spoke. They very passionately and articulately

06:32:28.780 --> 06:32:35.340
told us the urgency or provide the urgency, the urgent need, the intent, and the purpose of the

06:32:35.340 --> 06:32:43.420
effort here. So while the legislation requires us to adopt a, quote, ethnic studies model curriculum,

06:32:44.060 --> 06:32:50.380
any teacher or educator will tell you that this document isn't a curriculum per se.

06:32:50.380 --> 06:32:58.540
That's right. It's a collection of sample lesson plans upon which local agencies, schools, and

06:32:58.540 --> 06:33:07.660
districts can develop their ethnic studies courses or not. So I do feel comfortable

06:33:07.660 --> 06:33:15.980
supporting the staff's recommendation on this item, and also I would agree with President

06:33:15.980 --> 06:33:22.940
Darling-Hammond's suggestion of adding that footnote on the critical race theory definition.

06:33:23.740 --> 06:33:30.140
Thank you. I'm going to ask the staff to put that on paper if we want to see it at some point as we

06:33:30.140 --> 06:33:39.100
get closer to a vote. Member Glover-Woods. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. And

06:33:39.900 --> 06:33:45.660
as I stated a little earlier, any time we have conversations about the lived experiences of

06:33:45.660 --> 06:33:51.660
people of this country and in our state, and how we've been impacted by policies and systems,

06:33:51.660 --> 06:33:59.980
and practices, those are difficult conversations to be had, but they are important conversations

06:33:59.980 --> 06:34:09.820
that must take place. And the guidelines do ask and request and demand that students have

06:34:09.820 --> 06:34:17.100
opportunity to engage in that rigorous analysis of those systems and of those systems of oppression.

06:34:17.660 --> 06:34:25.100
So I also applaud and thank you for bringing forward the definition so that it could be

06:34:25.100 --> 06:34:31.900
clearly understood what it is and what it is not. One other piece I do want to add, and I think we

06:34:31.900 --> 06:34:38.620
would be remiss if we don't continue to emphasize this, is that the ethnic studies model curriculum

06:34:39.420 --> 06:34:47.260
is a first step in conversations that should be engaged in at the local levels.

06:34:47.260 --> 06:34:55.980
We've heard very passionate comments, not just in today's, but in all past IQC meetings,

06:34:55.980 --> 06:35:02.220
on where there are some desires and some needs. And I would encourage those conversations to

06:35:02.220 --> 06:35:10.060
continue at the local level so that as courses are developed, they are representative of the

06:35:10.060 --> 06:35:17.420
demographic communities in which those LEAs do serve. And again, this is the first step.

06:35:18.060 --> 06:35:25.100
There is a lot more to be done, but I think we need to continue to move forward in this very

06:35:25.100 --> 06:35:28.780
important work. Thank you. Member Navo.

06:35:30.860 --> 06:35:35.740
Just a couple of comments and a question for Shanine. First of all, Shanine, I'd like to

06:35:35.740 --> 06:35:43.260
thank you and the CD staff for an intense and laborious work on this ethnic model curriculum

06:35:43.260 --> 06:35:50.780
because it's been a labor of love on your behalf and that behalf of your team. And I know that

06:35:50.860 --> 06:35:56.700
there's been many hours put into this and I appreciate that. I also want to recognize

06:35:56.700 --> 06:36:01.500
and appreciate all our callers. And what was very clear is that we all have strong beliefs

06:36:01.500 --> 06:36:06.380
and convictions about ethnic studies, what it should be and what it should not be. And such

06:36:06.380 --> 06:36:10.940
is the dilemma for California when we're trying to design and provide a balanced reflective model

06:36:10.940 --> 06:36:17.580
curriculum that meets the needs of all people in the California. That being said, it is a model

06:36:17.580 --> 06:36:23.980
of which I appreciate Dr. Korematsu's comment at the beginning of our session today where she

06:36:23.980 --> 06:36:30.380
commented that this is a model that will continue to evolve. And I appreciate Superintendent's

06:36:30.380 --> 06:36:35.020
statement about the magnitude of this project and board member Glover Woods about the time and

06:36:35.020 --> 06:36:40.220
energy that's been put into it. And so I see this as a conversation that will evolve over time

06:36:41.260 --> 06:36:45.820
and that I also believe we could continue to work on this project for many, many years to come

06:36:46.460 --> 06:36:50.700
and never come to complete consensus and agreement in the state of California about what ethnic

06:36:50.700 --> 06:36:59.100
studies should be. With that, I'm going to support this. Shanine, the question I have for you is

06:36:59.100 --> 06:37:05.420
around the critical thinking. And I heard that come up in several calls that there's a belief

06:37:05.420 --> 06:37:11.740
that critical thinking element is only highlighted in chapter one. So with respect to that question,

06:37:11.740 --> 06:37:18.060
could you expand on that just a bit? Sure. So in terms of critical thinking, it's actually

06:37:19.100 --> 06:37:28.620
woven throughout. So I'll give a couple of examples. We have in chapter three is where

06:37:28.620 --> 06:37:38.780
we introduce the four themes, sample themes. And within that, we have various questions.

06:37:38.780 --> 06:37:46.220
They're open-ended questions designed for student inquiry and, again, critical thinking.

06:37:46.860 --> 06:37:54.860
Throughout the draft, we also have some concrete connections back to the history social science

06:37:54.860 --> 06:38:00.540
framework, again, including open-ended questions and the ability of students to, for example,

06:38:01.260 --> 06:38:11.340
look at primary resources, primary sources, as well as to connect the narratives of a variety

06:38:11.340 --> 06:38:17.020
of ethnic groups and identities. And then additionally, each of the lesson plans that

06:38:17.020 --> 06:38:24.380
are in chapter four connect directly to the history social science framework shifts, as well

06:38:24.380 --> 06:38:32.220
as the English language development standards. And again, the lessons are developed and shaped

06:38:32.220 --> 06:38:41.340
in a way to promote critical thinking as well. So it is laced throughout, essentially,

06:38:42.380 --> 06:38:49.820
the document is what I hear you saying. So I appreciate that. Member McQuillan.

06:38:50.780 --> 06:38:58.940
Yes, thank you. It's been a long day. I just want to thank the staff also for their dedication to

06:38:58.940 --> 06:39:07.500
this item. It's been more than meaningful to be a part of it and give input to this particular item.

06:39:08.060 --> 06:39:13.580
I'm one of the newer members on the board, and I just have to say that it's been very meaningful.

06:39:14.540 --> 06:39:21.340
And the opportunity that this ethnic studies guideline provides for our students throughout

06:39:21.340 --> 06:39:28.700
California to understand each other. And many of these students will be our voting members and our

06:39:29.580 --> 06:39:35.820
adults very soon out in the community. And we want a better understanding in our community of each

06:39:35.820 --> 06:39:42.780
other and of the different people throughout the world. So I want to thank Director Coates for her

06:39:42.780 --> 06:39:49.420
work on this. And what helps me on this item is it is a guide. It's not mandatory.

06:39:51.420 --> 06:39:59.580
LEAs and each region can develop their own program that reflects their community. I like that part of

06:39:59.580 --> 06:40:06.460
it and can add to it. We have very diverse communities throughout California, and we need

06:40:07.260 --> 06:40:13.420
those programs on ethnic studies to reflect the communities that they're in. So I really like that

06:40:13.420 --> 06:40:22.220
part. And my heart goes out to all the callers. I wish they had more than one minute to share out,

06:40:22.220 --> 06:40:27.020
but of course we would have been here all night long if that was true. So I appreciate all the

06:40:27.020 --> 06:40:33.900
patients and all the callers who were frustrated with the one minute timeline. So again, thank you.

06:40:33.900 --> 06:40:38.860
Thank you to all the staff. I'd just like to add a thank you to you,

06:40:39.580 --> 06:40:44.860
Member McQuillin, for participating in the educational series of seminars that were

06:40:46.620 --> 06:40:53.020
developed to help people understand the history and roots of ethnic studies. So

06:40:53.740 --> 06:40:59.100
we appreciate you representing us in that really important part of the process.

06:40:59.900 --> 06:41:01.180
Vice President Strauss.

06:41:02.860 --> 06:41:05.820
So I just want to follow up on the comments that were made.

06:41:07.100 --> 06:41:13.660
Throughout this entire process, we've had thoughtful written comments, amazing public comments,

06:41:14.220 --> 06:41:20.700
lots of units and lessons being submitted, lots of groups helping us to look at a variety of

06:41:20.700 --> 06:41:25.660
resources. And I think we're a lot better off than we were when we first started this process

06:41:25.660 --> 06:41:31.980
many years ago. But we know, as Member McQuillin and everyone has said, that this now moves to the

06:41:31.980 --> 06:41:38.860
local level for really how to address ethnic studies at the local level with the local context.

06:41:38.860 --> 06:41:44.780
And I think it's so clear from all of our keynote speakers that we had this morning about how

06:41:44.780 --> 06:41:50.460
important it is to understand the context of each group and the challenges of each group. We heard

06:41:50.460 --> 06:41:55.420
it passionately in our speakers today with lots of emotion, worried for their kids, worried for

06:41:55.420 --> 06:42:01.660
their community. And we have a responsibility to support the educators who will be charged to

06:42:01.660 --> 06:42:07.580
deliver this curriculum. So I appreciate that Governor Newsom has a proposal for investment

06:42:07.580 --> 06:42:14.140
in teacher capacity training, professional development, and continued work to help provide

06:42:14.140 --> 06:42:19.900
resources and support and really how you engage in these really challenging conversations in

06:42:19.900 --> 06:42:25.740
classrooms and schools. So I think it really is representative of our diverse state and the

06:42:25.740 --> 06:42:32.220
challenges of our student population that we as public school educators and leaders provide the

06:42:32.220 --> 06:42:38.700
resources, the guidance, and the flexibility for local districts to address the challenges that

06:42:38.700 --> 06:42:45.980
they see as they help craft coursework that will support their students. So I just want to thank

06:42:45.980 --> 06:42:51.500
the CDE team particularly and the state board staff that supported all the vetting of the

06:42:51.500 --> 06:42:58.860
100,000 comments of all the lessons and resources. We know we have a lot more work to do, but I feel

06:42:58.860 --> 06:43:05.900
like we've heard a lot of voices and can ensure that we are committed to continuing the work

06:43:05.900 --> 06:43:12.060
forward to provide the right support so students get thoughtful dialogue and deeper critical

06:43:12.060 --> 06:43:18.380
understanding in their classrooms as high school students. Thank you. Thank you. And I will note

06:43:19.260 --> 06:43:24.060
before I call the next couple of folks that the department has put together a resource

06:43:25.660 --> 06:43:32.220
website that will allow folks to get access not only to more lessons that have been submitted,

06:43:32.220 --> 06:43:37.980
but also to places that do this kind of work routinely, teaching tolerance,

06:43:38.620 --> 06:43:46.060
facing history in ourselves, and other curriculum sources that will help the process that you

06:43:46.060 --> 06:43:53.580
described, Eileen, in local communities. Member Patio Bronson and then I think I saw Member Fatah

06:43:54.780 --> 06:44:00.060
with his hand up. Did you still want it up? Okay. Member Patio Bronson.

06:44:01.580 --> 06:44:07.900
I also wanted to join in the chorus of thanks to the civil rights heroes who joined us at the top

06:44:08.380 --> 06:44:11.660
I feel like whenever we get to see Dolores Huerta it is a good day

06:44:13.900 --> 06:44:19.020
and to also just recognize how fortunate we are in California in some ways to have

06:44:19.900 --> 06:44:26.220
some of the leadership that we do that is homegrown and able to help us chart a path

06:44:27.020 --> 06:44:31.340
that really I think in many ways is treading a path not just for California but for the rest

06:44:31.340 --> 06:44:37.340
of the nation. The number of states that are looking to us to actually launch this and launch

06:44:37.340 --> 06:44:43.100
it well I think is significant and that's a responsibility that California has always I think

06:44:44.220 --> 06:44:51.660
stood up to that moment and actually met that moment. Also tremendous thank you to the staff,

06:44:52.220 --> 06:44:58.300
to the many committee members who volunteered countless hours, to contributors from our own

06:44:58.300 --> 06:45:04.140
California community but also from across the country who also clearly were taking an interest

06:45:04.140 --> 06:45:13.420
in contributing and to the many folks who clearly not only had a labor of love but also of patience

06:45:13.420 --> 06:45:21.660
to join us for public comment today and in past iterations I was definitely struck by the numbers

06:45:21.660 --> 06:45:30.460
that were described earlier of what the path of this document has been of four years, four drafts

06:45:30.460 --> 06:45:36.380
and a hundred thousand comments. It has been a democratic process small d democratic process

06:45:38.060 --> 06:45:43.660
that definitely I think indicates both the importance of of this work but also really

06:45:43.660 --> 06:45:52.940
the tenderness and closeness to person that this work actually brings up. I also just very much

06:45:52.940 --> 06:45:58.540
want to align myself with the comments that our board president offered at the beginning around

06:45:58.540 --> 06:46:04.220
the importance of actually helping people understand what critical race theory is and is not

06:46:05.180 --> 06:46:11.660
and how much it anchors first and foremost in a notion of critical thinking which is something

06:46:11.660 --> 06:46:18.620
that we should be aspiring for our kids to do in every subject matter not uniquely or pigeonhole

06:46:18.620 --> 06:46:25.260
in critical race theory. It is very much I think the process of interrogating assumptions and also

06:46:25.980 --> 06:46:33.580
of ensuring that the the history of our present and of our past that we're telling ourselves

06:46:33.580 --> 06:46:43.660
is not so surface and uncritical that we both erase and make invisible just you know immense

06:46:43.660 --> 06:46:47.420
parts of our civil society who have contributed to making our present day.

06:46:47.980 --> 06:46:55.740
The last thing I just wanted to comment on that is just that this work has been described as

06:46:55.740 --> 06:47:04.620
as being aimed at dividing us and I think it's really important to be very transparent that

06:47:04.620 --> 06:47:10.940
addressing structures of systemic inequality is ultimately about uniting us and putting us in

06:47:11.020 --> 06:47:16.620
better connection to one another rather than actually trying in any way to distance us.

06:47:18.940 --> 06:47:24.300
The last thing I'll just harken back to is at the beginning of the meeting I think Secretary

06:47:24.300 --> 06:47:31.020
of State Weber very appropriately commented that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good.

06:47:31.660 --> 06:47:36.140
I think this is a good document to begin with and California has to start this journey

06:47:36.700 --> 06:47:45.500
and I have every hope aspiration and expectation that successive versions of this will be better.

06:47:46.380 --> 06:47:51.500
They have to be better because we will have lived experience at how how the rubber meets the road

06:47:52.460 --> 06:47:58.540
and how locals will implement this and how it will come back in subsequent iterations

06:47:58.540 --> 06:48:04.540
and I look forward to this being a journey of progress rather than assuming that everything

06:48:04.540 --> 06:48:10.540
is bottled in a frozen moment and that we'll we have no aspiration to be better in the future.

06:48:12.860 --> 06:48:16.620
Thank you. Member Fata and then member Rodriguez.

06:48:17.420 --> 06:48:22.300
Thank you President Darling-Cammond. I just wanted to first and foremost thank Shanine and the team,

06:48:22.860 --> 06:48:28.620
the IQC and Superintendent Thurman's office for really setting the stage of today's discussion.

06:48:28.620 --> 06:48:31.580
I think it's one that's really been a long time coming and one that we all

06:48:32.540 --> 06:48:37.580
really were excited about coming into this board meeting and I also wanted to extend a great thank

06:48:37.580 --> 06:48:42.620
you for all the public comments we heard from extremely and incredibly passionate young people

06:48:43.180 --> 06:48:49.740
and peers who really stepped up and wanted to see change in their education system from all the

06:48:49.740 --> 06:48:55.260
way back last year when we first saw this ethnic studies model curriculum brought before us and

06:48:55.340 --> 06:49:01.900
just really quickly to echo what board member Patio Bronson just said and what we heard earlier

06:49:01.900 --> 06:49:07.340
from Secretary of State Dr. Shirley Weber. I think that this really sets the stage for today's

06:49:07.340 --> 06:49:13.340
ethnic studies model curriculum. As Voltaire once said we ought not let the perfect be the enemy of

06:49:13.340 --> 06:49:18.380
the good and I believe that today's ethnic studies model curriculum truly is good and I believe that

06:49:18.380 --> 06:49:23.420
when LEAs adopt it it will be great and that's something that I truly look forward to. I also

06:49:23.420 --> 06:49:28.060
believe that it's time for us to move forward in approving this item because every moment in which

06:49:28.060 --> 06:49:32.540
we sit here and discuss it is a moment in which we are not providing students with the option or

06:49:32.540 --> 06:49:37.020
even the opportunity to be introduced to ethnic studies through this model curriculum through

06:49:37.020 --> 06:49:42.220
their LEAs and it's something that we've been just tirelessly working on to develop over the past

06:49:43.740 --> 06:49:48.940
the numbers of years and I think that the spirit of today's proposal is to provide just a collection

06:49:48.940 --> 06:49:53.980
of ideas and samples that we hope will get the conversation started at a local level about ethnic

06:49:53.980 --> 06:49:58.700
studies racism and the lack of acknowledgement we collectively as a state have had for the

06:49:58.700 --> 06:50:04.460
generations of marginalized individuals who have contributed so greatly to shaping the society we

06:50:04.460 --> 06:50:09.820
live in today and so I stand for us taking this incredibly important first step and I stand for

06:50:09.820 --> 06:50:13.820
the fact that we are not mandating this for school districts but are rather guiding school districts

06:50:13.820 --> 06:50:24.620
and in that way I stand by this. Thanks. Member Rodriguez. Yes, thank you so much

06:50:25.500 --> 06:50:31.260
fellow members for all of your comments. I echo everything that's been said and feel tremendous

06:50:31.260 --> 06:50:39.340
gratitude to Dr. Coates and the IQC team for all of the work that you've done and of course

06:50:39.340 --> 06:50:49.580
he hasn't barked all day and now he's going to bark and I want to also acknowledge the callers

06:50:49.580 --> 06:50:57.100
because as you were speaking I our shared humanity was just really I was really touched by

06:50:57.100 --> 06:51:01.500
everything that you were saying because I know what it's like to be excluded and I know what

06:51:01.500 --> 06:51:12.940
it feels like to want to just voice like please let's all be a part of this and so I heard you

06:51:12.940 --> 06:51:20.940
and I also really support the comments that have been made about moving forward

06:51:22.220 --> 06:51:28.700
and I want to say that this morning as we were listening to the incredible team that came forward

06:51:28.700 --> 06:51:38.220
to talk about this ethnic studies curriculum and how their support of it I was reminded of

06:51:38.220 --> 06:51:46.860
a great friend of mine and mentor Jimmy Cannon who was a jazz musician and jazz teacher in Hope,

06:51:46.860 --> 06:51:54.700
Arkansas and Jimmy moved out to where I live to become a band teacher and a lot of students

06:51:55.340 --> 06:52:00.300
didn't want to be in his class because he was black and this is in the 70s here in California

06:52:01.260 --> 06:52:06.940
and so Jimmy in addition to being a great friend of mine was also an amazing teacher who built

06:52:06.940 --> 06:52:14.060
the great Spartan band that was recognized all over the world actually and the day before the

06:52:14.060 --> 06:52:18.700
Friday before I was going to become a teacher I asked him I said Jimmy do you have any advice

06:52:18.700 --> 06:52:24.860
for me and he said every child has something beautiful inside of them a good teacher can see

06:52:24.860 --> 06:52:31.180
it a great teacher can show it to them and as I was hearing the speakers this morning I thought

06:52:32.220 --> 06:52:37.580
this ethnic studies is the mirror it's the mirror with which is teachers we're going to show our

06:52:37.580 --> 06:52:43.500
students all of the beauty all of the cultural beauty that they have the humanity and create a

06:52:43.500 --> 06:52:47.660
place for them to speak to each other and to listen to each other so thank you so much.

06:52:53.820 --> 06:52:57.420
Thank you. Member Burr

06:53:01.340 --> 06:53:08.620
you are on mute sorry. Thank you President Darling-Hammond I just I didn't want to

06:53:09.340 --> 06:53:15.420
leave out my wishes of appreciation and gratitude for all of the work done by

06:53:16.460 --> 06:53:22.700
Shanine and her team the IQC our partners at Westwood all of our state board staff

06:53:23.660 --> 06:53:29.580
as I said to Vice President Strauss this has been an incredibly heavy lift and I just want you all

06:53:29.580 --> 06:53:37.580
to know how much we appreciate your diligence your persistence over these last several years actually

06:53:37.580 --> 06:53:41.900
that it took us to get here the other thing I just wanted to reinforce this notion that

06:53:42.620 --> 06:53:48.060
this is not mandatory I know we've heard some of that in the public comments I've seen some

06:53:48.060 --> 06:53:54.540
of it in some of the press reports which are as we all know are not accurate but it's certainly

06:53:54.540 --> 06:54:00.620
much needed as everyone has already said I don't need to reinforce that or repeat that I also

06:54:00.620 --> 06:54:05.740
wanted to just make sure that we nested this in a lot of the other work that's been done by Shanine

06:54:05.740 --> 06:54:12.220
and her team and the IQC and that's the adoption of the history social studies framework the

06:54:12.220 --> 06:54:18.380
ethnic studies model curriculum does not exist in isolation but it is a supplement to what I

06:54:18.380 --> 06:54:24.380
think is a really robust history social science curriculum framework that's also available to

06:54:24.380 --> 06:54:31.500
districts to use so I will just close by saying both how proud I am and how humble I am to be

06:54:31.500 --> 06:54:37.340
part of a deliberative body like this that spends the amount of time necessary and

06:54:37.340 --> 06:54:43.900
dedicates the amount of resources needed to create a model curriculum that is the first in the nation

06:54:44.700 --> 06:54:45.500
thank you very much

06:54:48.060 --> 06:54:54.460
all right I think we've heard from everyone and uh member Rodriguez your hand is still up but I'm

06:54:54.460 --> 06:55:00.380
assuming that that's just because it didn't come down okay very good well I think at this point

06:55:00.380 --> 06:55:07.420
we can entertain a motion um do we have a motion I'd like to make the motion if possible

06:55:07.980 --> 06:55:16.380
member Glover Woods please do I move that we adopt the ethnic studies model curriculum

06:55:16.380 --> 06:55:23.100
draft um with the recommendation from the CDE with the line edits and also recommend

06:55:23.740 --> 06:55:32.220
that the state board authorize the CDE staff with the approval of the SBE executive director to

06:55:32.220 --> 06:55:38.380
prepare revisions correct typographical errors and non-substantive clarifying edits

06:55:40.540 --> 06:55:50.540
sorry do we want to include Linda's um yeah thank you so much yes and with the inclusion of the

06:55:50.540 --> 06:55:56.220
definition of critical race theory as was shared um at the beginning of our conversation

06:55:57.180 --> 06:56:02.940
I will second that thank you very much and I know member Fattah had his hand up to uh

06:56:02.940 --> 06:56:11.340

07:02:22.700 --> 07:02:28.940
anymore just wanted a quick report that the california workforce pathways joint advisory

07:02:28.940 --> 07:02:36.620
committee we did have a meeting set for tomorrow which i'm very relieved to say that it has been

07:02:36.620 --> 07:02:43.500
cancelled and our next meeting will be in may cde has had some staff changes and we expect to

07:02:43.500 --> 07:02:53.340
continue our work on the california plan for career technical education terrific vice president

07:02:53.340 --> 07:03:00.140
strouse um yes so um i have uh some activities to report first of all for iqc both member rucker

07:03:00.140 --> 07:03:07.500

07:03:07.580 --> 07:03:13.020
danej popovich who's a principal in arcadia unified and we elected a new chair who you saw

07:03:13.020 --> 07:03:18.220
today dr manuel rustin and our new vice chair dr deborah costa hernandez so you got to see them

07:03:18.220 --> 07:03:23.980
today um you'll hear some more in a minute um the california subject matter project has a

07:03:23.980 --> 07:03:28.540
concurrence commission which are all the leaders of the subject matter projects and they met

07:03:29.500 --> 07:03:36.060
on january 27th to talk about professional learning um and we recommend we uh welcomed

07:03:36.060 --> 07:03:42.060
iqc commissioner christina andre as the representative from iqc to the concurrence

07:03:42.060 --> 07:03:48.220
commission the concurrence commission talked about maintaining expanding capacity to provide

07:03:48.220 --> 07:03:54.380
quality services right now and i just want to share one particular excitement that actually

07:03:54.380 --> 07:04:00.460
started yesterday the subject matter project and the california state leadership academy csla

07:04:01.420 --> 07:04:08.860
so it started um yesterday on how leaders can foster equitable access to inquiry-based

07:04:08.860 --> 07:04:14.540
instruction so it'll have six synchronous workshops and three asynchronous presentations

07:04:14.540 --> 07:04:21.420
with individual coaching very very exciting um as well um and then they're also working

07:04:21.420 --> 07:04:25.900
the subject matter projects with sacramento county office on the distance learning project which

07:04:25.900 --> 07:04:33.580
you'll hear at our may meeting the um on february 8th um the teens in government in westchester

07:04:34.140 --> 07:04:40.220
had a panel finding common ground dr deborah duardo who was the la county superintendent

07:04:40.220 --> 07:04:46.380
myself and zade fatah our board student board member were on this panel i just would say you've

07:04:46.380 --> 07:04:53.020
heard how articulate zade is he represented us so well and i hope he'll share a few in his comments

07:04:53.020 --> 07:05:00.060
about that panel we were very very fortunate to have his voice um at the state level the special

07:05:00.060 --> 07:05:06.540
ed advisory commission axi met on february 17th to the 18th um looking at their commitment to

07:05:06.540 --> 07:05:13.500
have a coherent approach to assistance to laa's we heard that some in the plan that was presented

07:05:13.500 --> 07:05:19.660
as part of our agenda and um wested did a really wonderful presentation on special ed funding and

07:05:19.660 --> 07:05:25.740
findings in california all the different levels of the system and economies of scale very thoughtful

07:05:26.380 --> 07:05:33.740
and really focused on differentiated funding and looking responsive to the particular populations

07:05:33.740 --> 07:05:39.340
our cpag our california practitioners advisory group met on february 19th we didn't have an

07:05:39.340 --> 07:05:45.500
accountability item this meeting based on the three-day meeting but you will hear in may about

07:05:45.580 --> 07:05:51.740
the growth model we had tremendous support it's five years of work that the cde's been doing

07:05:51.740 --> 07:05:56.780
and we are one of the last two states to adopt the growth model it's really strong there's a

07:05:56.780 --> 07:06:03.180
broad level support and you'll hear more about that in may and finally on march 4th and 5th the

07:06:03.180 --> 07:06:08.700
california collaborative on district reform had a two-day meeting with state policy and district

07:06:08.700 --> 07:06:14.300
leaders on how to accelerate learning to promote equity and the challenges in the midst of the

07:06:14.300 --> 07:06:20.380
pandemic so very thoughtful oh actually i had one more i'm sorry um the quantitative reasoning

07:06:20.380 --> 07:06:24.860
steering committee which is part of csu and looking at the fourth year math requirement

07:06:24.860 --> 07:06:30.780
which can be met by a quantitative reasoning class as a senior or a computer science class is

07:06:30.780 --> 07:06:35.900
going to have an independent research to look at this process to see if it would be helpful to

07:06:35.900 --> 07:06:41.660
student is it helpful we discussed the shortage of math teachers and staffing as a challenge

07:06:41.660 --> 07:06:47.420
csu is committed to doubling their output of math science teachers um understanding the

07:06:47.420 --> 07:06:53.180
challenge to meet this the csu trustees is committed to this although they haven't changed

07:06:53.180 --> 07:06:58.620
the title five regulations yet and one exciting thing is to know that there's a mathematical

07:06:58.620 --> 07:07:07.660
reasoning with connection mrwc a fourth year math course taught online by 162 certified teachers

07:07:07.660 --> 07:07:14.380
and 72 schools that we believe will be helpful and it's a collaboration with higher ed and k-12

07:07:14.380 --> 07:07:18.940
so very exciting to hear about this i'm sure you'll hear more as we deal with the math adoption

07:07:18.940 --> 07:07:25.180
going forward and that concludes my liaison report thank you thank you member rucker

07:07:26.220 --> 07:07:32.460
thank you very much i want to begin by just talking talking about the african-american

07:07:32.460 --> 07:07:38.220
advisory committee i want to take advantage of the context of the conversation we had today

07:07:38.220 --> 07:07:42.700
to remind this board that we once had an african-american advisory committee

07:07:42.700 --> 07:07:47.980
i believe we urgently need to find a way to resurrect that panel from laws to implement

07:07:47.980 --> 07:07:52.940
the williams settlement to the bill that created the ethnic studies curriculum that we approved

07:07:52.940 --> 07:08:01.180
today and even now with ab 1361 a bill addressing preschool and child care suspension and expulsion

07:08:01.180 --> 07:08:07.020
california legislature has examined multiple facets concerning the issues of equity race and

07:08:07.020 --> 07:08:12.460
the controversies of the disparate impact and unintended outcomes of public policies

07:08:12.460 --> 07:08:19.420
and that affect communities of color in this state so as this work continues to unfold we've

07:08:19.420 --> 07:08:24.140
made a commitment to the department to the community and to the schools that are going

07:08:24.140 --> 07:08:29.660
to be implementing this ethnic studies curriculum i think we need this is an opportunity to again

07:08:29.660 --> 07:08:36.220
emphasize that there's a need for this advisory panel and it has never been more important than

07:08:36.220 --> 07:08:42.860
the conversation today has demonstrated concerning the math framework i'm happy to announce mathematics

07:08:42.860 --> 07:08:49.580
framework out and out for a 60-day public comment period that was one of the actions from the last

07:08:49.580 --> 07:08:56.860
iqc meeting 2021 provision includes current research based on new learning and mathematics

07:08:56.860 --> 07:09:03.500
such as data science and categories of investigation the revision details effective strategies such as

07:09:03.500 --> 07:09:09.020
the integration of standards for mathematical practice understanding and learning the math

07:09:09.020 --> 07:09:15.340
progressions identifying pathways for studying and thriving in mathematics i believe the research

07:09:15.340 --> 07:09:21.660
cited and the framing language around it will help our local educators as they learn to improve

07:09:21.740 --> 07:09:26.940
math outcomes for all students and especially those that have historically struggled to

07:09:26.940 --> 07:09:32.700
successfully access math content and skills grounding in this work and research and best

07:09:32.700 --> 07:09:38.780
practices is very important the educators who do choose this framework and i do want to remind you

07:09:38.780 --> 07:09:44.860
the framework is not mandatory the use of it is voluntary educators who do choose to use this

07:09:44.860 --> 07:09:50.700
framework to guide the development of their courses and pedagogy will rely on this information when

07:09:50.700 --> 07:09:58.220
weighing options around issues such as the middle school courses and the high school pathways i also

07:09:58.220 --> 07:10:07.900
want to remind my colleagues that the early math conference has been set for june friday june 25th

07:10:07.900 --> 07:10:14.220
i know my colleague eileen strouse participated in the conference last year and i'm looking forward

07:10:14.220 --> 07:10:19.500
to supporting the department staff in the for the state board and the department staff and as they

07:10:19.500 --> 07:10:25.340
do the work to put this conference together this year i don't want to steal their thunder by

07:10:25.340 --> 07:10:33.420
previewing some of the presenters but probably in may i actually will but i'm also the liaison

07:10:33.420 --> 07:10:38.780
for the california state council for the interstate compact on educational opportunity

07:10:38.780 --> 07:10:45.260
for military children we've had several meetings this year and since our last board meeting since

07:10:45.340 --> 07:10:52.140
january 2021 the california compact has conducted multiple trainings and increased

07:10:52.140 --> 07:10:57.420
outreach to stakeholders and increased their transparency in the work that they do to support

07:10:58.220 --> 07:11:04.460
children who are military dependents and attending our public schools the national director in fact

07:11:04.460 --> 07:11:12.140
has commended california as recently as march 12th stating that california has led the nation

07:11:12.140 --> 07:11:18.940
in creating model practices and in creating plans that other state councils can use to observe the

07:11:18.940 --> 07:11:25.660
way california is bolstering and supporting their work one of those examples is the way that we're

07:11:25.660 --> 07:11:31.580
conducting training on an ongoing and consistent basis to support the contacts and the agents

07:11:31.580 --> 07:11:37.580
in the program who work with the schools and the military families who are transferring into our

07:11:37.580 --> 07:11:43.260
state or leaving our state they have conducted trainings on compliance committee at matters

07:11:43.260 --> 07:11:50.060
a town hall on the pandemic and its impact on schools and they've also conducted two very

07:11:50.060 --> 07:11:55.820
specific trainings for liaison officers to help them understand what the how their work and

07:11:55.820 --> 07:12:01.180
interagency activities with the schools can look there are a number of links that are already

07:12:01.180 --> 07:12:06.700
available on the wet compact website so i invite you all if you're interested to see that work to

07:12:06.700 --> 07:12:13.020
visit their website and then finally i'm going to report briefly on my involvement with the national

07:12:13.020 --> 07:12:19.660
association of state boards of education they have a whole child study group on february 19th the

07:12:19.660 --> 07:12:25.500
study group met to focus on teacher preparation it was an opportunity for members across the

07:12:25.500 --> 07:12:31.740
state to reflect on opportunities to partner with state education agencies and educator preparation

07:12:31.740 --> 07:12:37.980
programs to revise their licensure standards we discussed state actions to address the impacts

07:12:37.980 --> 07:12:44.620
of covid 19 on teacher preparation programs last march when our schools closed a lot of people just

07:12:44.620 --> 07:12:50.700
assumed that we would return and that didn't happen so while we understand the problems

07:12:50.700 --> 07:12:57.580
that created across the board for k-12 education and for businesses and employers there were over

07:12:57.580 --> 07:13:04.460
80 000 candidates in california who were enrolled in teacher preparation programs that's a workforce

07:13:04.460 --> 07:13:09.820
in many states and approximately 26 000 of those candidates were in their final year of their

07:13:09.820 --> 07:13:17.180
preparation we were asked to california when i say we were asked to speak briefly about the letter

07:13:17.180 --> 07:13:22.860
that had been prepared jointly by the department the state board of education and the commission

07:13:22.860 --> 07:13:28.300
on teacher credentialing which offered guidance to the field particularly teacher preparation

07:13:28.300 --> 07:13:35.420
programs and the districts where we send to student teachers to address these massive concerns

07:13:35.980 --> 07:13:42.300
and so we focused on the key points of effective practices how to keep the pipeline moving and how

07:13:42.300 --> 07:13:48.940
to concert encourage pre-service programs to find effective and creative ways to place student

07:13:48.940 --> 07:13:54.700
teachers in situations where they can learn and get the most out of their placement now it's a

07:13:54.700 --> 07:14:01.980
good thing that board member ting son announced that our meeting for the workforce pathways is

07:14:01.980 --> 07:14:07.900
cancelled tomorrow because tomorrow the nasby study group will be meeting the focus of that

07:14:07.900 --> 07:14:13.180
meeting is on service learning in california service learning is a teaching and learning

07:14:13.180 --> 07:14:18.860
strategy today elementary middle and high school student schools across california

07:14:18.860 --> 07:14:24.300
do participate in service learning with the support of state federal and district funding

07:14:24.300 --> 07:14:30.700
it is worth noting that the cal serve initiative which was originally signed into law in california

07:14:30.700 --> 07:14:36.860
is no longer monitored or supported here in the department so it will be very interesting

07:14:36.860 --> 07:14:41.740
to hear a national perspective on service learning activities and i'm looking forward to being able

07:14:41.740 --> 07:14:49.020
to report about that at the next board meeting that concludes my report thank you member rodriguez

07:14:49.820 --> 07:14:56.940
yes thank you and thank you member rucker for mentioning the teacher preparation because

07:14:56.940 --> 07:15:03.260
i'll expand a little bit on what you just said so as you know the commission on teacher credit

07:15:03.260 --> 07:15:07.340
sorry i didn't mean to steal your thunder i'm sorry oh no it's okay it was a good segue

07:15:08.140 --> 07:15:14.460
um the commission on teacher credentialing works arduously to ensure that all california students

07:15:14.460 --> 07:15:20.140
have the best prepared teachers february's meeting was no exception here are some highlights

07:15:20.700 --> 07:15:27.420
a concern exists that current teacher candidates haven't benefited from in-person teaching and have

07:15:27.420 --> 07:15:34.300
experienced gaps in their in their preparation in order to be classroom ready so to address this

07:15:34.300 --> 07:15:41.500
issue ctc staff convened a collaborative group in june of 2020 comprised of commission staff

07:15:42.780 --> 07:15:49.820
a commissioner representatives from major stakeholder groups such as teacher prep programs

07:15:49.820 --> 07:15:58.060
induction program leaders xa and cta to develop guidelines to address the issues that new teachers

07:15:58.860 --> 07:16:05.420
will be facing which are beyond the scope of the ctc so the recommendations made by this group

07:16:05.420 --> 07:16:10.220
were presented at the meeting they noted that to address the critical needs brought on by the

07:16:10.220 --> 07:16:18.380
pandemic and to ensure the success of all teacher candidates it will take all stakeholders to make

07:16:18.380 --> 07:16:25.420
a concerted effort to support the candidates along every step of the process specific guidelines

07:16:25.420 --> 07:16:32.220
were recommended for preliminary programs induction programs employers site administrators human

07:16:32.220 --> 07:16:38.940
resource personnel mentors and other veteran teachers and the commission the role of the

07:16:38.940 --> 07:16:45.420
site administrators and the induction coaches will be crucial in this process and it's you know

07:16:45.420 --> 07:16:50.860
very detailed the report that was presented and you're welcome to take a look at it i won't go

07:16:50.860 --> 07:16:58.620
into it here additionally governor gavin newson has proposed one-time funds to help support

07:16:58.620 --> 07:17:03.100
teacher recruitment with the proposed expansion of the teacher residency

07:17:03.100 --> 07:17:10.620
that president darling hammon mentioned i believe it was yesterday or the day before

07:17:10.620 --> 07:17:17.740
classified school employee credentialing program as well his proposal includes ctc

07:17:17.740 --> 07:17:23.340
administered grants for teacher residency programs which support locally sponsored one year

07:17:23.340 --> 07:17:31.020
intensive mentored clinical teacher prep programs dedicated to preparing and retaining teachers in

07:17:31.020 --> 07:17:38.860
high need subject areas in high need communities in the realm of child development ctc has been

07:17:38.860 --> 07:17:43.900
working with the field to implement the provisions of the preschool development grant renewal on a

07:17:43.900 --> 07:17:49.740
statewide basis the governor has established a coalition to develop a master plan for early

07:17:49.740 --> 07:17:55.740
childhood education currently the master plan has identified four policy goals that set high

07:17:55.740 --> 07:18:03.660
standards create cohesion fill gaps and foster sustainability the master plan provides a detailed

07:18:03.660 --> 07:18:10.540
roadmap of implementation steps and agencies responsible throughout the ece system for each

07:18:10.540 --> 07:18:18.300
of these objectives objectives commission staff will be moving the following work in the area vc

07:18:18.300 --> 07:18:26.940
during 2021 lastly there was a robust discussion about the bilingual authorization it lasted two

07:18:26.940 --> 07:18:32.540
days it was actually tabled for the following day that's how robust it was and while commissioners

07:18:32.540 --> 07:18:38.300
didn't vote they did direct staff commission staff to continue the work with the bilingual

07:18:38.300 --> 07:18:44.940
panel to address clinical practice requirements for current credential holders and this is a segue

07:18:44.940 --> 07:18:51.020
into as i'm also the english learner liaison to the board and i wanted to share some very

07:18:51.020 --> 07:18:57.020
exciting work happening to strengthen educators ability to support english learners through the

07:18:57.020 --> 07:19:04.460
statewide system of support the regional el specialist they've worked to curate resources

07:19:04.460 --> 07:19:11.500
for the field on an integrated and designated eld these resources they're a hub for educators

07:19:12.220 --> 07:19:17.020
as they navigate eld supports in a distance learning environment and there are also seven

07:19:17.020 --> 07:19:23.420
geographic lead agencies which offer generalized continuous improvement supports to the county

07:19:23.420 --> 07:19:31.580
offices of education within their region and lastly the arts education instructional materials

07:19:32.300 --> 07:19:38.220
um adoption virtual review training will take place the week of monday april 12th

07:19:38.220 --> 07:19:45.100
through 16th and i plan to make a few of those meetings hopefully all of them so thank you

07:19:45.100 --> 07:19:53.420
that concludes my report terrific thank you member patil bronson so i i just want to actually start

07:19:53.420 --> 07:19:59.260
by reflecting how delighted i am to hear board member rodriguez name the early care and learning

07:19:59.260 --> 07:20:03.660
master plan that's so exciting to hear someone else on the board talking about it here

07:20:03.660 --> 07:20:10.220
actually i think there's been three mentions so i'm just over the moon um so actually i'll start

07:20:10.220 --> 07:20:17.500
there um and i'll the um early childhood policy council has also met to dig into the master plan

07:20:17.500 --> 07:20:23.900
and again um the components i think that have the most overlap and connective tissue really with the

07:20:23.900 --> 07:20:28.380
state board's work obviously are the components that deal with school districts county offices

07:20:28.380 --> 07:20:34.860
of ed and transitional kindergarten one of the major tenants of the master plan that was

07:20:34.860 --> 07:20:42.380
announced in december was a universal pre-k program and to eventually have a targeted

07:20:42.380 --> 07:20:47.980
preschool program also for three-year-olds it starts with this idea of expanding access

07:20:47.980 --> 07:20:55.580
to all four-year-olds and starting to expand access in the highest need high poverty elementary

07:20:55.660 --> 07:21:02.940
schools as dictated by lcff so bringing again these systems that have really historically

07:21:02.940 --> 07:21:08.860
been more in parallel and actually starting to interweave both systems of targeting priority

07:21:09.420 --> 07:21:14.300
and also cohesion around how professional development and teacher training works

07:21:15.420 --> 07:21:21.340
also notably in in the governor's budget that was announced in in january there are proposals

07:21:21.340 --> 07:21:27.980
also to support expansion of transitional kindergarten and also workforce development grants

07:21:27.980 --> 07:21:36.380
both of which align very much with the earlier comments the last thing i'll just note on that

07:21:36.380 --> 07:21:43.660
is that subsequent to the early learning early childhood policy council's meeting on that

07:21:43.660 --> 07:21:49.420
where there was a discussion of both the master plan as well as the budget that was proposed in

07:21:49.420 --> 07:21:55.420
the beginnings of discussions with the legislature also we have now had the federal relief package

07:21:55.420 --> 07:22:02.300
passed which will drive about 3.8 billion dollars to california's early childhood system

07:22:03.420 --> 07:22:10.460
in addition to all of the funding that will go to traditional k-12 functions and leas as well as

07:22:10.460 --> 07:22:16.540
all of the pandemic relief required for contact tracing and testing and everything else related

07:22:16.540 --> 07:22:24.220
to health notably that 3.8 billion has quite a bit to offset both challenges to the child care

07:22:24.220 --> 07:22:30.460
industry but also includes child care development the child care development block grant from the

07:22:30.460 --> 07:22:36.860
federal government which becomes available for school districts early ed programs and

07:22:37.420 --> 07:22:45.900
also has a segue to the tk side of the world i will also add on to board member rucker's

07:22:45.900 --> 07:22:51.580
presentation about the whole child policy study group and and say what she was too modest to say

07:22:51.580 --> 07:22:58.220
which was it was a really lovely moment also both to hear board member rucker's presentation but

07:22:58.220 --> 07:23:03.980
also really to hear the degree to which other states are watching what california's model has

07:23:03.980 --> 07:23:10.780
been we're heartened to actually see some of the leadership and ongoing support for partnerships

07:23:10.860 --> 07:23:19.020
for teacher training programs and also a desire to see their states actually follow the same

07:23:20.300 --> 07:23:27.900
the last thing i'll end with is just to support to voice support for the proposal that board

07:23:27.900 --> 07:23:32.940
member rucker suggested of reinvigorating an african-american achievement committee

07:23:32.940 --> 07:23:39.420
i feel like there's been a number of board items in this board agenda that have

07:23:40.380 --> 07:23:44.460
touched on some of the gaps that we are seeing across multiple issue areas

07:23:45.180 --> 07:23:50.940
certainly in the ethnic studies conversation but also in the literacy conversations around how do

07:23:50.940 --> 07:24:03.340
we do better and how do we concert our focus to do so thanks and i was so engaged with the

07:24:03.340 --> 07:24:08.220
the conversation i forgot to look at my list remember navo you are up next

07:24:09.260 --> 07:24:17.660
no worries so i will build on much of what was part of day two which was the supporting

07:24:17.660 --> 07:24:23.500
inclusive practices project that you heard about and it was such a joy to hear such a robust

07:24:23.500 --> 07:24:27.740
conversation around students with disabilities so i'll highlight a couple of resources and

07:24:27.820 --> 07:24:31.900
professional learning opportunities that are priorities right now for the cce

07:24:33.500 --> 07:24:38.460
they have just recently highlighted five resources around supporting inclusive practices

07:24:39.340 --> 07:24:45.980
for educators two of which i'll highlight one is the disability collective came out with resources

07:24:45.980 --> 07:24:51.100
that focus on literacy and inclusive environments early learning and positive behavioral intervention

07:24:51.100 --> 07:24:57.420
supports you also heard a little bit on day two about captain and marin county selpa created a

07:24:57.420 --> 07:25:03.340
back-to-school padlet to support students with autism which is available both english and spanish

07:25:03.340 --> 07:25:09.580
and the padlet includes guidance documents that are curated around evidence-based strategies for

07:25:09.580 --> 07:25:17.580
families and educators which i think is just a tremendous a tremendous effort that was made by

07:25:17.580 --> 07:25:23.260
the marin county selpa and captain to get that those resources out a couple of professional

07:25:23.260 --> 07:25:29.740
learning that i'll highlight cc is now packaging every friday resources to support lea's as they

07:25:29.740 --> 07:25:36.460
re-engage students for in-person instruction those resources you'll find on the website

07:25:36.460 --> 07:25:41.260
and also the they have a new partnership with the american federation of teachers

07:25:41.260 --> 07:25:48.220
under share my lessons.com where they have 25 i believe new items that were posted to support

07:25:48.220 --> 07:25:55.580
educators as in around various topics they also have free professional learning that is important

07:25:55.580 --> 07:26:02.060
to note coming in the next couple of weeks you have assessment for learning in extraordinary times

07:26:02.060 --> 07:26:09.180
as a topic supporting student interactions with complex techs hybrid and online classrooms and

07:26:09.180 --> 07:26:15.180
what educators and school leaders can do now to accelerate learning and lastly at our last board

07:26:15.180 --> 07:26:22.140
meeting on on february 4th we thanked sandra lion superintendent of palm springs who has served

07:26:22.140 --> 07:26:27.180
graciously the students of california and the state of california for over 30 years she will be

07:26:27.180 --> 07:26:34.220
retiring from her position and so that'll vacate a position on our board we will be looking for

07:26:34.220 --> 07:26:40.460
replacements i also want to commend cde and cce for their continued collaboration

07:26:41.180 --> 07:26:45.740
uh for the students of california and coordination of resources thank you

07:26:47.740 --> 07:26:50.140
terrific uh member

07:26:55.340 --> 07:27:02.220
thank you i don't have a lot to report on i'm i'm happy the ct joint

07:27:02.220 --> 07:27:05.980
workforce task force is not happening tomorrow also that's good news

07:27:06.780 --> 07:27:15.340
um the past couple of months in in giving input to the ethnic studies curriculum i've learned that

07:27:15.340 --> 07:27:22.140
uh there's a couple of new proposals coming down the coming down the line um it was so good to see

07:27:22.140 --> 07:27:29.820
assemblyman ramos this morning one of those is coming from his office to add additional curriculum

07:27:30.220 --> 07:27:36.780
to various grade levels on american indian history and culture that's being proposed that's coming

07:27:36.780 --> 07:27:44.700
down and then the second one is on school attendance we know our american indian student

07:27:44.700 --> 07:27:54.300
population has a quite a history of missing school and high percents of absenteeism but there's a

07:27:54.300 --> 07:28:01.100
proposal coming out from assemblyman i think it's deal assemblywoman from the first district

07:28:01.820 --> 07:28:08.220
on school attendance where it's kind of an oversight in the ed code where american indian

07:28:08.220 --> 07:28:14.620
students are not given an excused absence for attending ceremonies or cultural events

07:28:15.580 --> 07:28:22.060
this new legislation will uh try to you know correct that that uh oversight

07:28:23.580 --> 07:28:28.300
it's new it's got a ways to go yet also so a couple of new things

07:28:30.220 --> 07:28:36.620
and that's all i have to say thank you thank you so much um member blogger woods

07:28:38.060 --> 07:28:42.460
thank you president darling hammon um i don't think i need to give any report on the ethnic

07:28:42.460 --> 07:28:47.740
studies model curriculum i think we're all caught up to speed on that one i just wanted to share

07:28:47.740 --> 07:28:53.260
in relation to the world languages instructional materials adoption and that work continues to be

07:28:53.260 --> 07:28:59.980
underway the last week in april will be the reviewer trainer training and it will be held

07:28:59.980 --> 07:29:05.580
virtually so that work is progressing as well and i'll have more for you our next meeting thank you

07:29:06.380 --> 07:29:13.100
terrific thank you member fatah yeah thank you president darling cam and um i think i'll start

07:29:13.100 --> 07:29:16.540
at the top based off of what board member strouse was talking about a little bit earlier

07:29:17.100 --> 07:29:23.100
i participated with board member strouse um at the uh uh i guess i think it was called finding

07:29:23.100 --> 07:29:28.220
common ground panel um it was with the westchester family ymca's team and government leaders

07:29:28.220 --> 07:29:34.140
um la county office of education superintendent deborah duardo um eileen and myself and there we

07:29:34.140 --> 07:29:38.220
discussed everything from school reopening to student leadership and the importance of risk

07:29:38.220 --> 07:29:45.180
taking and um just trying things for student leaders um another thing to i guess report on is

07:29:45.180 --> 07:29:51.180
that i've accepted the position of hosting the 2021 ed 100 academy for student leaders which is a

07:29:51.180 --> 07:29:57.180
three-day virtual conference held from june 21st to 23rd and it's bringing together 400 plus

07:29:57.180 --> 07:30:02.460
california students education policy leaders and ed tech entrepreneurs um so i'm super excited

07:30:02.460 --> 07:30:07.420
about that because it will really help put california students in the same room with

07:30:07.420 --> 07:30:12.940
california experts and education leaders who really have a deep experience in context and

07:30:12.940 --> 07:30:20.380
can kind of serve these students and give them an interesting perspective to learn from also on

07:30:20.380 --> 07:30:26.620
monday i'll be at the nasby 2021 legislative conference for the national association of

07:30:26.620 --> 07:30:31.820
state boards of education speaking on their panel voices from the field perspectives from

07:30:31.820 --> 07:30:37.580
teachers students and families on education in the pandemic and then just in other news my school

07:30:37.580 --> 07:30:42.460
and school district recently returned back to campus yesterday which is incredibly exciting

07:30:42.460 --> 07:30:49.340
we're currently in the hybrid model and i also recently my school district also approved and

07:30:49.340 --> 07:30:54.300
began the process for having a student member sit on our board of trustees next year which is

07:30:54.300 --> 07:31:00.460
something that i petitioned for during my junior year so super exciting and with that that concludes

07:31:01.260 --> 07:31:11.980
my report thank you i will keep my report short um during the period of time from november until

07:31:12.940 --> 07:31:18.860
just this last month i have um you know worked on the president biden's transition team

07:31:19.500 --> 07:31:26.780
and um to make um member patiya brunson happy again uh the plans for federal investment

07:31:26.780 --> 07:31:34.220
in early childhood education dovetail nicely with the master plan in california to get to universal

07:31:34.220 --> 07:31:39.980
pre-k for three and four-year-olds as well as substantial investments as you already noted in

07:31:40.540 --> 07:31:49.500
child care and early early learning um the one of the happy moments for me in the last couple of

07:31:49.500 --> 07:31:55.260
weeks was when the american rescue act was indeed passed because it was something we worked on quite

07:31:55.260 --> 07:32:02.780
a lot in the transition and that will be sending about 15 billion dollars to california for not

07:32:02.780 --> 07:32:10.620
only you know ppe and ventilation support and other things that enable reopening schools but

07:32:10.620 --> 07:32:16.380
for educator stabilization we have severe and growing shortages in california as do other

07:32:16.380 --> 07:32:24.700
parts of the country member rodriguez mentioned the you know way in which there was disruption in

07:32:24.700 --> 07:32:32.620
the teacher pipeline coming out of last year and into this year so that will provide resources for

07:32:33.740 --> 07:32:42.060
things like recruitment and retention of teachers or residences among other things that have become

07:32:42.060 --> 07:32:49.820
a an important part of california's approach it will provide opportunities for learning recovery

07:32:49.820 --> 07:32:55.020
and acceleration and i think one of the interesting things for our state will be figuring out

07:32:55.020 --> 07:33:03.900
how to use the summer to create joyful active engaging reattaching experiences for students

07:33:05.100 --> 07:33:13.580
and then on into the fall so that we can accelerate learning and then finally there's

07:33:13.580 --> 07:33:19.340
a lot of resources for social emotional supports mental health supports and community schools which

07:33:19.340 --> 07:33:26.780
may reinforce the efforts we're making in california to create sort of a integrated

07:33:27.740 --> 07:33:32.540
set of wraparound services that really enable kids to have all that they need

07:33:32.540 --> 07:33:39.740
to be ready to learn each day so i look forward to you know our efforts here to figure out how

07:33:39.740 --> 07:33:45.820
to take advantage of those investments that can make a huge difference i think in our educational

07:33:45.820 --> 07:33:51.500
system and member burr you get the last word clean up hitter

07:33:53.740 --> 07:34:00.060
quick things one i just want to reinforce what my colleague and co liaison on accountability said

07:34:00.060 --> 07:34:05.420
vice president strouse we did have a robust discussion with staff about accountability

07:34:05.420 --> 07:34:11.260
and the growth model and decided it probably was a good time to talk about it this meeting but it

07:34:11.260 --> 07:34:15.900
will be up in may and just wanted to commend to everyone's attention a very thorough

07:34:16.620 --> 07:34:21.500
memo that's posted on our website it's a february memo about the growth model so

07:34:21.500 --> 07:34:27.020
encourage you to take a look at that before our may meeting and refresh your memory about where

07:34:27.020 --> 07:34:32.940
we are over the last several years and just to close with as the historian of the group

07:34:32.940 --> 07:34:39.020
and in my former role as executive director of the state board did oversee the work of the

07:34:39.100 --> 07:34:44.540
african-american advisory committee they did complete their work and they actually issued

07:34:44.540 --> 07:34:50.940
a set of recommendations which were quite helpful we turned those recommendations over to then

07:34:50.940 --> 07:34:56.700
superintendent torlakson and the department of education for implementation so just a little

07:34:56.700 --> 07:35:03.260
heads up stephanie it might be helpful to at least dig those out because i think again i think there

07:35:03.260 --> 07:35:07.980
were some very helpful things there and see what happened with those and that might be a good

07:35:08.060 --> 07:35:17.340
frame board for a next iteration of work thank you terrific thank you and now we're going to

07:35:17.340 --> 07:35:23.820

07:36:37.980 --> 07:36:42.380
stakeholder groups that are meeting to discuss issues that are important to students with

07:36:42.380 --> 07:36:47.020
exceptional needs yet these students are not included to increase outcomes to students with

07:36:47.020 --> 07:36:52.140
exceptional needs student feedback must be included in decision making for ida students

07:36:52.140 --> 07:36:57.180
acceptable needs are part of the iep team to the best of their ability the state should recognize

07:36:57.180 --> 07:37:01.660
the voice of students with exceptional needs in the decisions about the decisions being made about

07:37:01.660 --> 07:37:07.340
