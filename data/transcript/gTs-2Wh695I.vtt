WEBVTT

00:00.131 --> 00:00.893
Thanks for watching!

00:37.540 --> 00:38.000
do do

01:16.278 --> 01:16.498
Bye!

01:59.321 --> 01:59.641
do do

02:28.120 --> 02:28.600
do do

04:32.383 --> 04:32.723
Bye!

06:11.394 --> 06:11.754
do do

06:25.805 --> 06:31.827
State board will reconvene and we'll take up item one, which is the assessment item.

06:32.967 --> 06:42.230
And I have several different items here, so we'll have multiple presenters for various parts of this item.

06:44.510 --> 06:47.251
So Michelle Center will start.

06:50.972 --> 06:51.492
Good morning.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.213
Good morning.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.303
Michelle Senner, Director of the Assessment Division here at the Department.

07:00.224 --> 07:04.486
What I provided to you was both an information item as well as an action item.

07:05.687 --> 07:13.312
And as has become my approach, I, of course, have a team to help me with my items.

07:13.392 --> 07:18.396
So, this morning, Karek Ashley will present to you on the CASP results.

07:19.196 --> 07:27.701
And then myself, as well as Kenji Hakuta, will be presenting to you on part of the action, which is the Spanish assessment.

07:28.221 --> 07:33.925
And then I will also present to you on the other action part of this item, which is the California alternate assessment.

07:34.625 --> 07:43.650
There are many other topics that are for your information in this item, but I will only be presenting on those three topics you just heard me outline.

07:43.770 --> 07:47.632
So if you have questions afterwards on anything else in the item, I'm open to that.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.533
But let's start with with Carrick.

07:57.457 --> 08:00.198
Good morning, Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent.

08:09.599 --> 08:15.202
So hopefully you've all received a handout of the slides from this morning.

08:16.102 --> 08:17.783
We're going to go over the CASP results.

08:18.743 --> 08:24.046
We did provide a handout since I know the screen is a little low down for some to see.

08:24.066 --> 08:24.527
There we go.

08:27.403 --> 08:29.484
So we did talk a little bit about this yesterday.

08:30.885 --> 08:39.250
Since we did the press release at the end of August, we haven't had a board meeting since then to actually talk about it as a group, so this is our opportunity.

08:41.611 --> 08:45.934
The 3.2 million kids again took the test, a second year of successful implementation.

08:46.354 --> 08:54.199
I think you heard from the superintendent's report yesterday that a very small number of students opted out of the test, so the support for Common Core

08:55.199 --> 08:57.380
across the state is still strong.

08:57.820 --> 09:09.545
The state of the state when it comes to Smarter Balance is strong and the results also indicate very good progress across the board.

09:10.386 --> 09:21.971
Every grade level, every student subgroup, race and ethnicity, folks across the board in English language arts and math, gains were made by all.

09:22.651 --> 09:28.533
So an overview here shows where we were in the orange from the 2015 results.

09:29.273 --> 09:32.614
The green tells you the additional growth that was made.

09:33.194 --> 09:35.394
On the left side, the bars for English language arts.

09:35.454 --> 09:44.777
On the right is math, and you can see an increase of five percentage points in English language arts and four in mathematics.

09:46.144 --> 09:55.753
So we should probably stop right now and say that this was part of the discussion yesterday, that this is only one lens of the way that we look at this data, and in some ways it doesn't tell the whole picture.

09:56.053 --> 10:04.601
It only tells the picture of those who met or went above the standard, which is what these charts recognize.

10:05.181 --> 10:07.223
One of the reasons for that is that

10:09.024 --> 10:20.275
We are required by the federal government to report the data in this way of the four levels and how many are at or above what is considered standard, in the past what they called proficient.

10:21.075 --> 10:27.241
All states report the data this way, and this is what the news media tends to pick up on.

10:28.382 --> 10:29.283
particular metric.

10:30.024 --> 10:46.384
So one of the things that we again we talked about yesterday was trying to change the conversation a little to move beyond just this metric of those bubble kids if you will that went over level three and or level three and or four.

10:47.685 --> 10:54.052
to talk about how did all kids across the state do, kids in level one, kids in level two.

10:54.253 --> 11:05.926
If nothing else, at a very minimum, we should be looking at kids that cross lines, thresholds in all four levels, but even better, looking at each and every student and seeing how they did.

11:07.591 --> 11:10.232
Our problem is our resources.

11:10.612 --> 11:26.679
Our staff is busy doing everything that is required by the federal government to try to meet our responsibilities by the end of August to get this data up and available to the public before the start of the school year.

11:28.055 --> 11:34.240
So there is very little time to do any real data analysis beyond this.

11:34.940 --> 11:48.970
So I guess part of my presentation this morning is sort of a call, if you will, because we need to partner with someone out there, some good-hearted university, because we don't have money to give them.

11:50.331 --> 11:56.474
that might be willing to take a look at this data and to be able to look at perhaps scale scores.

11:56.514 --> 12:04.878
I know Linda Darling-Hammond in the Learning Policy Institute did that a little bit and was emailing back and forth with her last week.

12:05.178 --> 12:13.362
And her quick analysis, she wouldn't call it thorough, but her quick analysis showed that kids in different grade levels were closing gaps.

12:14.303 --> 12:16.424
And that's the sort of thing we need to look at.

12:17.384 --> 12:29.251
But we really do need a partner to do that because, quite frankly, aside from Smarter Balanced, our assessment division is working on six different assessments and different stages of development at this time.

12:29.791 --> 12:36.515
So there just isn't the time and the resources for us to look really in depth at an analysis of the data.

12:36.835 --> 12:40.917
But what we do have shows very good results.

12:44.301 --> 12:45.882
Here it is by grade level.

12:46.163 --> 12:54.490
You can see for English Language Arts, you can see, again, every grade level in English Language Arts made some growth, at least looking at this lens of the data.

12:54.510 --> 12:57.653
I want to call out grade six, especially.

12:57.693 --> 13:04.458
They made a six point gain in, again, kids that were at or above standards.

13:04.939 --> 13:06.921
I can tell you, well, let's look at math.

13:07.621 --> 13:12.005
Math also, though math overall doesn't do as well as English Language Arts,

13:13.027 --> 13:16.088
Overall, again, growth across all of the grade levels.

13:16.389 --> 13:22.871
Grade 3, in this instance, made, again, six points of growth for grade 3.

13:24.632 --> 13:32.516
I can tell you, just to put it in context, that I am very pleased with these results, and we are going to look at some other results here in a minute.

13:34.036 --> 13:38.697
I will say, if you were to look at other Smarter Balanced States, not all of them have released their data yet.

13:39.878 --> 13:44.719
Probably about almost half of the Smarter Balanced States have released their data.

13:46.459 --> 13:56.822
Smarter Balanced States are seeing gains across the board in other states, though I will say that not as high a gain as we are finding here in California.

13:57.628 --> 14:12.822
So if you kind of put this in context with our accountability system that we're trying to look at status and change, our status, not as high as some of our neighboring states, smarter balanced states like Oregon and Washington, started higher than us.

14:13.323 --> 14:14.544
But if you were to look at the change,

14:15.003 --> 14:19.829
Our change is higher than those states.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.073
So good news in that respect.

14:23.373 --> 14:27.078
I would not necessarily expect five and six point gains every year.

14:28.079 --> 14:34.507
I do think it's reasonable to expect gains each year, and that certainly is our goal.

14:35.748 --> 14:51.845
gains probably closer in the area of one to two to three percentage points, which is what we saw in states like Oregon and Washington, are probably more reasonable expectations than some of these that really, really jumped like five and six points.

14:54.167 --> 15:01.891
So looking at gender is one example here in English language arts and math.

15:02.251 --> 15:06.433
Some good gains, especially by female students in English language arts.

15:08.874 --> 15:11.916
in looking at some of the race and ethnicity groups.

15:12.696 --> 15:22.861
You can see especially Hispanic students growing by five percentage points, with a reminder that that Hispanic subgroup contains a lot of English learners within it.

15:23.782 --> 15:31.626
So even with all of those English learners within that subgroup, making a five-point gain in English language arts is actually remarkable.

15:34.454 --> 15:55.680
And then some of our, again, some of the other student groups, especially, I think we ought to be pleased with the growth of economically disadvantaged students here by making a four-point gain across the board, which, again, also includes students with disabilities and English learners within that economically disadvantaged subgroup.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.741
So as we mentioned yesterday,

16:00.321 --> 16:05.622
We do need to look at the data for more analysis, especially when it comes to an English learner subgroup.

16:06.883 --> 16:14.364
I think we need to change our focus or the way that we look at English learner data differently than some other groups.

16:14.904 --> 16:26.027
There's a reason why, even with the new federal law, there is a specific metric to show and to look at kids learning English along the way.

16:27.968 --> 16:33.273
That is the only subgroup that has that kind of special accountability measure for them.

16:33.874 --> 16:42.181
I think we need to put our emphasis more than we have in the past on how our kids are doing in learning English.

16:42.241 --> 16:47.786
Learning English is going to be the key for them to then perform in Smarter Balance.

16:48.847 --> 16:52.748
As we mentioned yesterday, the English learners subgroup is a changing subgroup.

16:53.268 --> 17:05.232
So if you had 100 students, as Member Rucker said yesterday, if you had 100 students, say, in the African American subgroup, and let's say 100 of them scored in levels three and four,

17:06.932 --> 17:14.017
The next year, you're starting with those same 100 students minus who are the kids transferred out, but you're starting with those 100 kids.

17:14.297 --> 17:17.279
So to move five percentage points, you need now 105 kids in that group.

17:20.137 --> 17:30.592
In the English subgroup, if you were to have 100 kids in that English learner subgroup, those 100 kids that scored in levels 3 and 4 really ought to be reclassified.

17:31.032 --> 17:35.078
When they take the test the next year, they won't be in that subgroup.

17:35.579 --> 17:36.660
You're basically starting

17:37.441 --> 17:38.981
Theoretically, it's not true.

17:39.362 --> 17:50.665
Theoretically, at zero, so to gain five points, they'd have to have 105 kids in that subgroup to make a 5% point gain.

17:51.025 --> 18:01.028
So we just need to be careful that in comparing these gains, we have to look at English learners a little different than we do the other subgroups.

18:03.744 --> 18:06.726
So, we do want to look at closing the achievement gaps.

18:07.487 --> 18:09.669
This is not the best metric to do that.

18:10.669 --> 18:16.654
This is one metric, one way of looking at the data, but this is not the best metric to see if we're closing gaps.

18:18.235 --> 18:27.862
So, again, a little call for help out there that we might be able to partner with someone to give us a little bit of more background on that.

18:27.982 --> 18:32.926
So, before we move on, back to Michelle Senter, any questions about overall data?

18:40.842 --> 18:56.485
First of all, I always look forward to this report every fall and to hear with great interest what the data is going to tell us, not only about the implementation of Smarter Balanced and, again, giving clear evidence to the efficiencies and the good work of the Department.

18:56.505 --> 18:59.106
I want to really make sure I begin by complimenting

19:00.046 --> 19:17.914
Not only the good work to do the implementation in the field, but the work that the clear partnership with Smarter Balanced and ETS is showing in getting this implemented and doing that, but also the time that it takes to put this report together in a consumable and understandable way.

19:18.454 --> 19:20.295
But this is where my question is.

19:20.835 --> 19:39.701
Our charge as a state education agency is to address the achievement gap and to create a plan for not only intervention, oversight, and monitoring, but for collaborating now with our school districts to help them understand how to address the achievement gap.

19:40.601 --> 20:04.996
What this report points out, and I appreciate your candor in talking about the capacity of the department, if we are unable to do the kind of data analysis that helps us figure out if the gaps are closing or where the gaps are changing, then what we are doing is more faith-based education reform than data-driven education reform.

20:06.377 --> 20:19.492
And so in saying that, I think it is important for us to figure out not just how to collaborate with a university or some think tank or the experts that are clearly in the field.

20:20.013 --> 20:24.478
Some of them are clearly in this room and some of them we even contract with.

20:24.918 --> 20:53.124
but we might need to think about what it is we are asking of the people we currently contract with and is our contract, I'm sorry, reformed English teacher, are the contracts we're writing actually taking advantage of the expertise that our contractors clearly have to do a data analysis at a level of granularity that will give us this information beyond just simply collating the data and reporting it back.

20:54.403 --> 21:07.180
So I agree with you, we should have universities and other programs involved in this because they would probably be more neutral and probably have to be able to look at the data and do the analysis at arm's distance.

21:07.921 --> 21:09.584
But we have an obligation

21:10.024 --> 21:18.953
to be able to figure out how to report and explain to the school community that spent all that time with us yesterday, this is what they were asking for.

21:19.473 --> 21:27.701
So, it's not sufficient for us to sit here and say, it's not that we don't know how to do it, we don't have the capacity.

21:28.081 --> 21:31.643
It is not sufficient for us to sit here and say that.

21:31.743 --> 21:38.327
So we had a member of the legislature here yesterday who was talking about her idea for the accountability system.

21:38.787 --> 21:47.652
Maybe the conversation needs to be with the legislature to talk about how we build the state's capacity to do the work that you've just outlined.

21:47.732 --> 21:53.515
So I'm very glad that we see this conversation today because here's the other dimension that's going to happen.

21:53.935 --> 21:57.237
Having adopted this accountability rubric yesterday,

21:57.737 --> 22:03.966
When at some point in time, your division is going to have to start giving us data about that rubric.

22:04.347 --> 22:13.961
If you don't currently have the capacity to do the reporting beyond the six tests you're already monitoring, how are you going to develop the capacity

22:14.341 --> 22:21.425
to prepare a report for the board about the information the rubric is telling us about the performance of schools in the state.

22:21.845 --> 22:27.388
So I want to congratulate you first of all for the work you're doing, for the reporting that's going on.

22:27.769 --> 22:34.152
I think you have a fantastic crew of folks with the expertise to do this work and I congratulate you on that.

22:34.613 --> 22:39.996
But I also think we have very strong partnerships and the ability because of

22:41.076 --> 23:05.798
uh the size of this state and the market that this the market share this state represents to actually throw some weight around in the in the assessment community to say we need you to do a different type of reporting and consider how to use the capacity of your organization to do that because as long as we fail to figure out how to do this the monitoring on the achievement gap

23:06.338 --> 23:13.985
We will not be doing real data-driven reform and really making data-driven decisions that this board is charged to do.

23:14.485 --> 23:27.237
So I'm hoping I said that in a way that wasn't a criticism of your staff and the department, but more a concern about the opportunities we're missing in the way we're currently contracting with our vendors.

23:28.718 --> 23:29.719
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

23:29.739 --> 23:35.163
I couldn't agree with you any more, Pat, in terms of that observation.

23:35.203 --> 23:56.781
And to let you know, besides looking for outside sources of help and research, we have been working for the last six months with the Latino caucus and the legislature, the African-American caucus, the API caucus, on creating an office of education equity or a team of education equity where we'd have our own internal staff with secure funding over

23:57.461 --> 24:04.906
number of years that would really look, really focus in on the achievement gap and really focus in on the opportunity gap.

24:04.986 --> 24:15.773
And you look at these results and, you know, are glad that we're seeing this kind of progress, but you talk to different folks in the field and they have different reasons for why

24:16.793 --> 24:21.474
why the numbers went up, why they went up more in English language arts than in mathematics.

24:21.534 --> 24:37.457
And they range from greater familiarity with the equipment, with the testing system, with the keyboard and other computer skills, with the material, with the new standards material and instruction, to the professional development.

24:37.477 --> 24:41.238
The state, at our request, a collective request of the state board,

24:42.138 --> 24:54.246
My office, the education community, we got a billion and a half in professional development money and it was very well invested right down to the school site sharing of best practices and countless webinars and seminars.

24:54.927 --> 24:58.109
That was obviously a major contributor and we need to do more of that.

24:58.409 --> 25:07.655
And I know the collaborative is looking at its role in that regard, but the enormity of reaching 10,000 schools and dealing with all the complexities

25:08.696 --> 25:28.512
I think also we're past, and hopefully with the passage of Prop 55, past the chaos that existed during the recession years, where we had layoffs by the tens of thousands, we had bumping, we had school teams that had been built by administrators and principals that were sort of dismantled in the crisis.

25:28.953 --> 25:31.275
So that stability, I think, has changed in bringing back

25:31.855 --> 25:47.468
Things that attract students to stay in school from smaller class sizes, arts, music, drama, career tech, I think are making, are strides forward in tackling absenteeism and suspension and expulsion.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.431
And those students are staying in school and learning and

25:50.931 --> 25:53.172
not dropping out, and they're doing better, I think, on the test.

25:53.192 --> 25:57.933
But how do you sort out among all those factors, I think they all contribute in some way.

25:58.954 --> 26:02.455
So I'll look forward to, you know, Carrick and Michelle responding further.

26:03.155 --> 26:08.557
I also wanted, though, to comment on Carrick's focus on English learners.

26:09.337 --> 26:12.858
And again, we had some discussion yesterday, and we'll have continuing discussions.

26:12.918 --> 26:14.279
It's one of our main missions is to

26:14.879 --> 26:16.100
help English learners succeed?

26:16.120 --> 26:23.403
And how much should we rely on reclassification as sort of a main indicator of whether English learners are successful?

26:23.443 --> 26:29.326
What about two, three years down the road after reclass or after getting off the long-term English learner list?

26:29.346 --> 26:42.152
So I think we have a challenge to work out here as a board, my department, your staff working together to figure out the strategies that will help us lift all English learners and close that gap.

26:43.647 --> 26:44.528
Thank you, Superintendent.

26:45.429 --> 26:49.814
And then let me respond to Member Rucker's comments.

26:51.295 --> 26:55.459
So first, there are a couple of things at play here.

26:55.740 --> 27:00.625
One is to try to figure out what are we going to do about the gap closure.

27:02.328 --> 27:05.712
The other thing is the capacity to actually identify it well.

27:06.753 --> 27:10.337
So the superintendent and I, during a press conference, went to San Leandro High School.

27:11.658 --> 27:23.591
And while the state made a gain of five percentage points in English language arts and four in math, their high school students, African-Americans, made 10 percentage points.

27:24.271 --> 27:25.551
And Hispanics made eight.

27:26.291 --> 27:35.793
So we need to find out what's happening at some of the schools where they're having great success, which is not really an assessment data issue.

27:36.153 --> 27:44.155
It's probably a curriculum, instruction, professional development issue, and then be able to share what some of those best practices are.

27:45.415 --> 27:49.976
And maybe that's something, if this equity office were to come about, they could focus on.

27:51.497 --> 27:52.418
Thank you for your comments.

27:53.119 --> 27:58.705
I think what is key there, because you said it two or three times, is the current contract.

27:59.586 --> 28:03.149
Smarter Balance and ETS have been great partners in this.

28:03.770 --> 28:11.318
It is not Smarter Balance's responsibility to identify what California is going to do to identify those gaps, but they have been

28:11.658 --> 28:25.346
providing great support to all of the states to look at their options, and as he mentioned yesterday, finding out what is it that the state wants to get out of the data that they have, which we'll have that conversation.

28:26.656 --> 28:34.141
I can suppose, I can guess, that looking at gaps would be part of what we would want to see out of a system.

28:34.581 --> 28:40.905
And if that's the case, then we need to focus on a metric that will allow us to do that more or better.

28:42.486 --> 28:55.857
ETS has also done some, you know, they do small data analysis for us without extra cost, and they did that for us, for English learners, in a quick analysis.

28:56.238 --> 29:04.665
So they, but again, we need to look at the contract and see what do we want to do moving forward, because you're right, it's not in the current contract.

29:04.885 --> 29:07.967
But I do know that Michelle has some things that she

29:08.928 --> 29:15.050
can tell you about the work with ETS, so I think I'll go ahead and turn it over to her.

29:15.070 --> 29:30.313
So, just to follow up on what Carrick just mentioned, we also recognized, as Carrick mentioned in his presentation, that this isn't necessarily the best way to show the progress, particularly for the English learner subgroup.

29:30.814 --> 29:32.174
So, we have been working with ETS.

29:33.234 --> 29:49.784
looked at one approach and they were able to do a data run for us that focused on scale scores and it also focused on longitudinal, which this data that you see before here is not really a longitudinal data, right?

29:49.804 --> 29:51.805
It's a snapshot last year, snapshot this year.

29:52.986 --> 30:04.638
So, one of the approaches that we are investigating is what happens when you actually take that subgroup that was there last year and is still there this year, and look at their progress over that one-year period.

30:05.198 --> 30:06.660
So, that's one approach we're looking at.

30:06.700 --> 30:12.666
So, I didn't want to leave you with the impression that this is what we can do and we're done,

30:13.587 --> 30:19.711
We are still investigating other options and additional ways to display the data.

30:19.771 --> 30:33.241
I don't know that we're looking to replace the way that we currently display it, but we think that there are other ways to look at it that answer different questions than the questions that can be answered with the way it's displayed currently.

30:33.261 --> 30:36.683
Board Member Holliday.

30:39.542 --> 30:49.972
I do think this is an excellent report, and it shows that we've hit the ground running, and we're doing pretty well, and we don't know why there's a nice gain.

30:50.532 --> 31:00.882
But in San Leandro, when there was a 10-point gain for African-Americans, I believe you said, what was the white student gain?

31:01.122 --> 31:01.703
Was it also 10?

31:03.404 --> 31:14.088
And I don't mean to put you on the spot, but as Felicia said yesterday, she and I can keep moving around the tables together, but she's never going to catch up with me if we just move one seat at a time.

31:14.949 --> 31:25.233
So I really do think that this is the heart and soul of what this board is about currently and will be for any number of years, closing the achievement gap and really understanding that.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.634
I didn't expect that data today.

31:27.654 --> 31:30.435
I didn't expect that, but I certainly agree with Member Rucker.

31:31.335 --> 31:47.193
This is the goal, this is our challenge, and so finding out what is the best method to calculate that, to help us understand that, and to single out those districts and schools that are achieving it and being able to learn from that.

31:47.673 --> 31:51.458
We do need to move that way, so anything we all can do to help.

31:52.879 --> 31:54.380
Can I answer the San Leandro question?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.380
It's about 6%, I think, for Caucasian.

31:57.901 --> 31:58.481
So there was a 6, 6.5%.

31:58.601 --> 32:07.544
So there was a closure, and a lot of it they attribute to career tech education, hands-on, small schools within the big high school.

32:09.167 --> 32:33.267
Yeah, one thing on this point I've never seen is, you know, there's got to be some kind of mathematical way of saying if you're going to close the achievement gap and assuming that the high end will make some gains as well, what increase is needed

32:36.474 --> 32:38.835
in Smarter Balanced to do that?

32:39.116 --> 32:48.681
I mean, okay, we know it's faster than X, because if we all do 5%, it's going, you know, you're not closing any gaps.

32:50.342 --> 32:51.603
So what would it take

32:52.463 --> 32:55.565
to make, you know, some significant progress?

32:55.765 --> 32:58.046
What percent of gains?

32:58.166 --> 33:01.248
I don't know how to figure this out, but I've never seen this.

33:01.328 --> 33:04.129
So what should I be looking for?

33:04.209 --> 33:12.494
What should I be shooting for, given that there's a relationship between the top and the bottom in gap analysis?

33:13.374 --> 33:18.337
So I don't know what that is, and it would benefit from a simulation.

33:18.417 --> 33:19.938
It's a simulation, in effect.

33:20.578 --> 33:28.382
a projection simulation as to what it would take would help me in visualizing this.

33:30.903 --> 33:34.465
I don't know, can you do that or is that, that seems to me possible?

33:35.146 --> 33:39.768
What it sounds like you're describing is the work that needs to be done to develop the growth model.

33:41.609 --> 33:47.012
Yeah, maybe, yes, but you, I think you can do this without a growth model.

33:48.853 --> 33:49.173
You know,

33:51.192 --> 33:58.901
I mean, I don't know, but it seems to me one could calculate it from now without having some fancy growth model that we're going to have.

33:58.981 --> 34:07.070
But maybe that, it just strikes me that one could sit down and calculate this roughly without fitting it into a model.

34:07.551 --> 34:09.493
You know, a model may be

34:10.622 --> 34:11.303
A target.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.808
I'm just trying to look at it visually to understand.

34:15.609 --> 34:18.513
The model might say what you need to do each year or something.

34:18.573 --> 34:24.321
I'm just trying to get a handle on it without... Maybe you have to have a growth model.

34:24.441 --> 34:25.102
I don't know.

34:25.502 --> 34:34.950
I think the model can get you different growth targets for those different subgroups, which I think gets to your wanting to close the gap.

34:35.610 --> 34:44.317
So I'm happy there's many more people in the room that are smarter than I am on these topics, and we're happy to continue those conversations and present additional information.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.659
I just don't know enough about growth models.

34:46.679 --> 34:47.260
Yeah, go ahead.

34:48.164 --> 34:54.586
I just, I feel like we really, as a state, should take a lead in this type of area.

34:54.686 --> 35:15.072
And if we're talking about providing LEAs and schools on the LCFF rubric with information that they can, that is actionable, then this is the type of data that we should provide for them, especially for small schools or small districts that may not have the data capacity, but, and to be able to display this and it would be public and transparent and all of that.

35:15.752 --> 35:19.636
I think it's more than just, it'd be great if we could figure it out at some point.

35:19.656 --> 35:25.882
I think we really do need to be very proactive in taking leadership role in figuring how we do this.

35:25.902 --> 35:28.665
Right.

35:30.126 --> 35:30.847
Board Member Rucker.

35:31.780 --> 35:47.173
As it relates to that kind of conversation, back when the Department was giving waivers to states to create these growth models, there were a lot of projects that came from different states that looked at different ways of doing it.

35:48.835 --> 35:53.779
What President Kirst is asking about is this kind of trajectory growth model.

35:54.799 --> 36:05.706
the state of Colorado, they didn't apply for this waiver, but they created kind of a hybrid growth model that's still available to other states as an open source application.

36:06.066 --> 36:22.516
And what they do is they do actually use the data that is provided from the statewide assessment, and it identifies in ways how clusters, subgroups, and even individual students, what their performance needs to be to catch up if they're performing below proficiency,

36:22.916 --> 36:29.424
to keep up if they are meeting or exceeding those standards, or even to move up, to catch up, keep up, and move up.

36:29.764 --> 36:41.998
So the type of question that Dr. Kurtz is asking about is actually doable, but it goes back to the question that Carrick asked this board yesterday, what do you want the growth model to do?

36:43.219 --> 36:49.701
If that is something we want the growth model to do, then that is the direction that we have to give you.

36:49.721 --> 36:58.224
Do we want a regression model that would work to help us be able to figure out how to incorporate the grade 11 scores and connect them to the grade 8 scores?

36:58.604 --> 37:08.393
Do we want a model that actually works at a level of granularity to help us understand the subgroup of English learners so that we can break out those different students that move out?

37:08.834 --> 37:11.216
Different growth models work in different ways.

37:11.656 --> 37:15.220
And maybe there's a hybrid that'll let us do all four of those functions.

37:15.640 --> 37:17.202
I'm not sure if that's out there.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.385
But there are growth models that will perform.

37:20.825 --> 37:31.910
to do the things that we are asking about, but we have to decide not just what data we're trying to figure out, but what we're asking the growth model to do.

37:32.430 --> 37:40.113
Now, and I want to say, and again, to give this compliment to Tony, Smarter Balanced knows how to do those things.

37:40.173 --> 37:49.237
They have done that with a level of granularity when they did the field data, when they did the first field test reports, because they did impact data and they looked at

37:50.655 --> 37:58.519
not only what the differences were among the states and the performance of subgroups on the field test, but they had impact data for individual states.

37:58.899 --> 38:08.684
So some of their conversation about what they will do in looking at the scale scores and looking at where those cut points are is going to be informed by that baseline data.

38:08.764 --> 38:17.188
Now, the differences between the other states and California, unlike other states, California tested the entire spread.

38:17.248 --> 38:19.329
We tested grades three through eight and grade 11.

38:20.069 --> 38:36.379
So we have a more diverse set of information in that state-level impact data that can inform some of the analysis that Smarter is going to do in looking at those scores and making some of those determinations about how to make those changes.

38:36.739 --> 38:39.421
So again, as I said, their expertise is there.

38:39.861 --> 38:42.322
It's something that we haven't asked them to do.

38:42.402 --> 38:44.544
Our contract doesn't task them to do.

38:44.904 --> 38:48.486
But it is information they have that they know how to use.

38:48.826 --> 38:51.767
and they understand what they're looking at when they're reading it.

38:52.107 --> 39:00.851
So it is doable, it is possible, but it goes back to the question Carrot gave us yesterday, what do we want to ask the growth model to do?

39:00.871 --> 39:10.375
I move on to the next topic.

39:10.836 --> 39:15.417
Okay, so can we proceed to the next item?

39:15.438 --> 39:16.418
This is a multi-item.

39:22.435 --> 39:30.857
So the first part of the action presented in this item today addresses the California Alternate Assessment, or the CAA, for English Language Arts.

39:33.558 --> 39:33.998
It is on.

39:36.718 --> 39:37.379
Can you hear me now?

39:48.241 --> 39:50.682
So the CAA, I'll just speak louder.

39:51.752 --> 40:01.316
Okay, the CAA is an alternate assessment administered in grades three through eight and 11 to students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

40:01.697 --> 40:04.838
That's less than 1% of the student population in California.

40:05.678 --> 40:19.345
The CAAs, like all of California's assessments, are built on the assumption that students are receiving the appropriate grade level curriculum, instruction, accommodations, and access to technology they require.

40:20.265 --> 40:27.788
The action before you today seeks approval of the superintendent's recommendations for the threshold scores for the CAA.

40:28.649 --> 40:33.811
Threshold scores are the entry and exit points between the respective achievement levels.

40:34.631 --> 40:37.853
They describe three levels of achievement for the CAA.

40:39.505 --> 40:47.037
The approval of the threshold scores today, the action of this board, is necessary in order to provide results for the 2015-16 CAA.

40:50.771 --> 41:11.507
While this may be the last board action prior to reporting the 2015-16 scores, each assessment year presents us with new opportunities for not only improving delivery of the assessments, but for our schools to improve their instructing of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in their grade level standards.

41:12.307 --> 41:19.452
The assessment division and the special education division will continue to work in coordinated and collaborative effort to support the field.

41:20.513 --> 41:27.876
As you may know, development of standardized assessments for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities is no simple task.

41:28.856 --> 41:40.501
Therefore, we will continue to support and listen to the field in how we can improve both the testing experience as well as assisting educators in identifying the most appropriate accessibility supports.

41:41.662 --> 41:49.985
Additionally, it would be reasonable for us to take another look at these threshold scores after we have a few years of data.

41:54.775 --> 42:04.715
Please also note an overview of the actions that were previously taken by this board and details of the standard setting process were provided in August information memorandum.

42:11.809 --> 42:16.512
To arrive at these recommended thresholds, we convened a standard setting panel in August of 2016.

42:17.133 --> 42:21.115
It included 68 California educators.

42:22.216 --> 42:27.280
They had an average of 20 years of experience working with the student population.

42:28.140 --> 42:35.965
These dedicated educators worked for four days utilizing the board's approved grade and content specific performance level descriptors.

42:37.167 --> 42:46.726
As a reminder, these descriptors that were approved by the board earlier this year outline what students at each achievement level know and can do as measured by the CAA.

42:50.868 --> 43:00.313
The standard setting panel's recommended thresholds are products of professional judgment through the use of the bookmark method, which is one of the most widely used standard setting procedures.

43:00.993 --> 43:10.878
The superintendent's recommendations took into consideration fidelity to the panel's judgments, as well as looking for consistency of achievement across all the grade levels tested.

43:13.888 --> 43:20.821
The superintendent's recommendations are located in tables one and two of the addendum and they have related 2015-16 student data in those tables.

43:24.059 --> 43:31.160
While reviewing those recommended threshold scores, I would like to remind you of the board-approved policy descriptors for each of the three levels.

43:31.981 --> 43:49.644
Level 3, documented in the table, are students demonstrating an understanding of the core subject matter in the content area and are actively working with adapted grade-level content that focuses on the essential knowledge and skills and may need occasional prompts and assistance to complete tasks.

43:50.544 --> 44:08.629
Level 2 students demonstrate a foundational understanding of core subject matter in the content area when provided with frequent prompts and support and are actively working with adapted grade-level content that focuses on the essential knowledge and skills and may frequently need support to complete these tasks.

44:09.650 --> 44:20.033
Level 1 students demonstrate a limited understanding of adapted grade-level content that focuses on much of the basic knowledge and skills even with extensive supports.

44:21.554 --> 44:28.743
The 2015-16 data provided includes the percentage at or above for each of these achievement levels by each grade.

44:30.064 --> 44:38.614
Also note that students who participated in the assessment but could not orient or did not respond to the test are included in the level 1 percentage.

44:39.721 --> 44:46.305
You'll also note that when we actually do the reporting, we'll not be using the scales that you see in these tables.

44:46.945 --> 44:53.069
Once we have the board action, we'll establish a reporting scale implementing the board approved threshold scores.

44:56.971 --> 45:04.715
I don't know if you want to take questions on this or if I should present the next action also and take questions for all at the end.

45:06.776 --> 45:07.897
What would the next item be?

45:09.002 --> 45:14.533
Spanish no I we want to take questions on this and stop here so board member

45:15.854 --> 45:19.537
So, Michelle, thank you for just laying this out really clearly.

45:20.137 --> 45:25.362
I want to talk a bit about the standard setting, knowing that it's the first time we've done this.

45:25.842 --> 45:27.984
And you talked about revisiting in a couple years.

45:28.544 --> 45:37.571
Do you think that we should, I mean, your recommendation that then the committee that we should wait a few years to revisit it or take a look and see, do you believe that's the right?

45:37.691 --> 45:42.055
And then the other question I had was, did we get any guidance at all from our

45:42.815 --> 45:46.839
in NCSIC, or was this completely independent from what we did before?

45:47.880 --> 45:49.282
This was independent.

45:49.542 --> 45:59.171
The Department has conducted, along with its partners, ETS, many standard-setting workshops in the past, so this is not a new process for us at all.

46:00.592 --> 46:06.037
We actually have in the audience Patty Barron from ETS, who

46:07.259 --> 46:15.626
She probably can't count the number of standard setting workshops she has facilitated, so she is here with us if you have any questions on that.

46:15.967 --> 46:28.618
So, it isn't that we have doubt in the threshold scores that we're putting before you today, but it is best practice, as we're developing a new assessment, to take a look at that after we have a few years of data.

46:31.941 --> 46:44.405
the Common Core State Standards, while they have been around now for many years, this student population probably is not yet receiving that adapted content.

46:44.965 --> 46:49.106
And so I think that is another reason why we should take a look at these again in a few years.

46:51.347 --> 47:01.430
Also, it's a much smaller in size as well as far as that standard setting as well, so that could also lead to part of that.

47:02.870 --> 47:12.115
OK, to split the items, I'd like to take public comment on this item, because I know there's some concerns about the difficulty of these items.

47:12.856 --> 47:17.138
So one minute if there are any people that want to speak just on this item.

47:21.201 --> 47:21.861
Oh, two minutes.

47:21.881 --> 47:23.682
We have five people on the list.

47:24.443 --> 47:25.783
Yeah, just on this item.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.324
No, not the Spanish item.

47:27.684 --> 47:30.186
So special ed.

47:34.316 --> 47:36.777
You want to speak on special ed, I think.

47:39.998 --> 47:41.618
You can speak later on Spanish.

47:41.879 --> 47:42.559
I want to give people.

47:43.199 --> 47:44.119
OK, come forward.

47:44.319 --> 47:49.521
OK, I'll actually speak later on the 2016 results.

47:49.581 --> 47:50.581
I wanted to speak on both.

47:51.122 --> 47:51.962
OK, that's fine.

47:52.002 --> 47:53.882
But let's stick with the Spanish item here.

47:55.943 --> 47:57.263
I'm sorry, EL item.

47:57.804 --> 48:01.925
There's a handout coming around.

48:08.711 --> 48:09.311
I'll begin.

48:10.252 --> 48:11.112
My name is Doug McRae.

48:11.132 --> 48:13.434
I'm a retired test specialist from NRA.

48:15.255 --> 48:32.447
The handout on the green paper coming around outlines information from the spring 2016 administration of CAA that's needed to evaluate the validity and the credibility of the threshold recommendations and I am addendum posted August 31.

48:35.249 --> 48:38.890
The item addenda had no supporting data for the recommendations.

48:39.631 --> 48:52.395
Without the data specified on this green handout, it's impossible for the public or the board to vet the recommended threshold scores.

48:53.215 --> 48:59.377
Without that data, an action to delay approval until such data are available would be appropriate.

49:00.490 --> 49:14.715
If the data are not consistent with the recommendations, the appropriate action, frankly, would be to delay approval of CAA threshold scores until spring 2017, when supporting data are available.

49:16.315 --> 49:22.277
I attempted to get some clarification with the Department earlier this week by email.

49:23.559 --> 49:25.280
and they were not able to share any of the data.

49:25.320 --> 49:38.412
There was one piece of data that did come out in the presentation this morning, and that is that the students who were not able to orient to the test are included in things.

49:40.157 --> 49:47.024
In the pilot test a year ago, or 2015, 37% of the students in this population were not able to orient to the test.

49:47.665 --> 49:49.988
Only 63% oriented to the test.

49:50.688 --> 49:51.709
NICSEC had roughly 15%.

49:54.172 --> 49:58.036
If the test is not aimed at the full population,

49:59.317 --> 50:03.840
You're not getting a very good range of coverage of the test.

50:04.340 --> 50:09.282
Typically, test publishers like to have 95 to 98% coverage of the range.

50:10.403 --> 50:11.363
63% does not come close.

50:11.823 --> 50:16.246
We still do not know how many students did not orient to the test.

50:17.166 --> 50:20.589
The other data on that handout are also needed.

50:21.069 --> 50:31.738
The last one, comparison to the NICSEC, would be very useful to do inasmuch as the CAA effort is more or less modeled over the NICSEC thing.

50:32.099 --> 50:35.161
So I would ask the Department to delay.

50:38.143 --> 50:48.067
delay approval of this until the data is available to vet it, and possibly some of the Special Education Advisory Committee, for instance, have an opportunity to vet it.

50:49.007 --> 50:49.347
Thank you.

50:53.288 --> 50:56.149
This is on the alternative assessment only.

50:57.910 --> 50:58.550
Special Ed.

50:59.730 --> 51:00.711
Sorry, Mr. President.

51:00.751 --> 51:05.072
Then general comments about the assessing item should wait?

51:05.272 --> 51:05.773
Should wait.

51:05.953 --> 51:06.273
Okay.

51:06.393 --> 51:07.013
Sorry, I'll wait.

51:09.412 --> 51:13.177
OK, so that's all the public comment.

51:14.339 --> 51:20.528
Special Ed, ready.

51:22.951 --> 51:26.553
Good morning, President Kirst, Superintendent Torlakson, members of the board.

51:26.953 --> 51:27.874
My name is Gina Plate.

51:27.974 --> 51:33.356
I chair the Advisory Commission on Special Ed, and I'm also an advisor at the California Charter Schools Association.

51:34.157 --> 51:38.359
I just want to speak as it relates to the alternate assessment.

51:38.439 --> 51:41.801
I want to share that we have had ongoing dialogue with the division.

51:42.721 --> 51:51.869
And you'll remember from previous discussions that assessing this population with such unique learning needs is no easy task.

51:52.449 --> 51:53.290
It's complicated.

51:53.310 --> 52:00.035
And you'll remember that I came to a previous board meeting to applaud the way that the division was thinking about assessing

52:00.876 --> 52:06.578
this population going forward as they are rolling out the alternate assessment for science.

52:08.098 --> 52:19.962
The evolution in this discussion shows the desire on the department to create a strong link between curriculum and assessment, which is what we at the Advisory Commission have been asking for.

52:21.102 --> 52:26.185
So, we really need this population to have an individualized way to capture what they know.

52:27.126 --> 52:37.772
The cut scores, though, and the threshold scores really do need to realistically represent what this population has mastered as it relates to the standards.

52:39.372 --> 52:47.634
We look forward to the continued dialogue with the division and appreciate Michelle's Center and her staff for continuing to engage us.

52:48.235 --> 52:55.537
This is an evolution and we appreciate being involved and look forward to that ongoing discussion.

52:57.817 --> 52:58.137
Thank you.

52:58.157 --> 53:00.918
Board Member Rucker.

53:02.205 --> 53:28.679
Okay, so I just want to say, having had the opportunity to actually observe a standard setting activity, that the suggestion or the concern that maybe we're not being transparent in providing the evidence or the data that's related to where this recommendation came from, I think that there's, I want to offer some comment to my colleagues on the board about that.

53:29.199 --> 53:51.380
The people who sit in the room for the standard setting study the actual items on the assessment, they study the standards those items are supposed to be aligned to, and they actually take a look at and have a conversation about what they believe the item is supposed to be telling us about the performance of those students.

53:51.980 --> 54:01.427
and the data that is being requested about the performance of those items, those members in those rooms see that information.

54:01.887 --> 54:11.654
And so they are studying a lot of data, not only about the item itself, not only about the performance of the item, but they are seeing all of this data

54:12.054 --> 54:19.600
that is being requested concerning what supports the underlying recommendation for these threshold scores.

54:20.061 --> 54:22.743
Not only did they see them, but they argued about them.

54:22.843 --> 54:24.504
And they argued about what they mean.

54:24.544 --> 54:27.927
They argued about the differences in their interpretation.

54:28.227 --> 54:37.615
And they came to some agreements, not compromise, but clear agreements about what it's supposed to mean and what setting those threshold scores mean.

54:38.135 --> 54:51.285
And so there was vetting not only once by the grade level and even among the subject area, there was an effort afterwards when the work was done to have a secondary group also do that similar type of review.

54:51.865 --> 54:59.351
So the kind of transparency that's being asked for actually would compromise the process.

54:59.811 --> 55:05.754
because there is a lot of very confidential information, particularly about the assessment items themselves.

55:06.214 --> 55:19.421
But the work that was done among the stakeholders who participated in that standard setting addresses the concerns that have been raised about the evidence upon which the threshold scores are being recommended.

55:19.901 --> 55:25.966
Now, as to Michelle's recommendation to the board that we revisit it, classroom teachers do this all the time.

55:26.307 --> 55:33.893
If I gave a test and 100% of my students got an A on the test, I need to think about if the test I gave was too easy.

55:34.634 --> 55:42.540
Or if I give a test and 100% of my students fail the test, I need to think about whether or not the test I gave was too difficult.

55:42.961 --> 55:44.222
So it is normal

55:44.542 --> 55:57.155
to continually assess and evaluate whether or not how you are giving the assessment, but also how you are choosing to do the grading and the reporting on the performance of that assessment.

55:57.515 --> 56:02.080
It is a realistic and common sense idea to revisit

56:02.620 --> 56:04.962
Did the test do what we said it was going to do?

56:05.343 --> 56:14.371
And are we providing real performance ratings that tell us realistically about what the test is doing for that student population?

56:14.431 --> 56:22.159
So I think inside of the standard setting process, which cannot because of what it is the participants look at,

56:22.759 --> 56:33.889
It cannot be transparent to the public, but inside of that process, all the data that stakeholders want to know is available and was reviewed.

56:34.029 --> 56:35.611
It actually was reviewed.

56:38.273 --> 56:44.299
Do you have any comment on the concern that this test is too difficult for the students?

56:48.829 --> 56:52.772
The test measures adapted Common Core State Standards.

56:53.652 --> 56:54.233
Adaptive?

56:54.573 --> 56:57.155
They are adapted Common Core State Standards.

56:57.736 --> 57:08.244
That is probably difficult for some students and I think it's also challenging because we don't yet have the curriculum that goes along with that yet.

57:09.025 --> 57:11.107
So over time, I'm hoping,

57:11.947 --> 57:22.210
And I'm so excited that Kristen Wright is your new division director over the special education division, because I know that we can work collaboratively together on that specific point.

57:22.910 --> 57:26.151
So will it be this difficult a few years from now?

57:26.391 --> 57:26.871
I don't know.

57:27.311 --> 57:28.371
I think we should hope not.

57:29.411 --> 57:39.314
I would like to comment, though, on the comment that there was, I can't remember the percentage, 30-something percent of students that could not orient to the test.

57:40.635 --> 57:48.182
There were approximately 14 to 19 percent, depending on the grade level, of students that could not orient to this test.

57:48.763 --> 57:53.628
So that is nowhere near the percentage that was mentioned earlier.

57:53.648 --> 57:57.052
Okay, further comments on this?

57:58.193 --> 57:59.014
Board Member Sandoval.

57:59.915 --> 58:00.676
Thank you for the report.

58:00.696 --> 58:09.545
I thought it was very clear and I felt that in addition to the materials that we had prior to the meeting, your presentation today answered some of the questions that I had.

58:10.166 --> 58:16.032
I just want to recognize that this is a process and it's ongoing and we're learning as we go.

58:16.052 --> 58:21.797
I think that there is more coordination and alignment.

58:23.659 --> 58:35.802
The promise that the development holds for the alternate assessment for science with embedded performance tasks that inform instruction, there's more learning that's going to happen through that.

58:35.962 --> 58:43.023
So I appreciate the work that's being done and the communication with the various stakeholders around this.

58:43.083 --> 58:43.603
So thank you.

58:43.823 --> 58:44.143
Thank you.

58:46.744 --> 58:47.664
I'll move the item.

58:50.359 --> 59:06.993
all right any further comment from the board hearing none all those in favor what yes sorry yes just on this the threshold on special ed yes just on special this is just special ed oh it's it is

59:11.806 --> 59:20.688
I'm sorry, move, yes, the recommendation regarding the achievement levels for special ed.

59:20.868 --> 59:32.170
Yeah, for the alternate assessments with the understanding that we will be revisiting these cut scores, these thresholds after a couple of administrations, okay?

59:34.811 --> 59:36.731
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hands.

59:38.112 --> 59:39.872
Okay, now we're on to the other item.

59:45.376 --> 59:48.599
Now on to the second action within this item.

59:49.220 --> 59:58.169
We are seeking approval from the State Board on the proposed high-level test design for the California Spanish Assessment, also referred to as the CSA.

59:58.749 --> 01:00:02.893
This new test will eventually replace the standards-based test in Spanish.

01:00:03.954 --> 01:00:07.877
I think it is important to first talk about why we are asking for your action today.

01:00:08.557 --> 01:00:15.021
We are here because the California Education Code says we are to identify a purpose for this test prior to its development.

01:00:15.761 --> 01:00:26.308
Based on the law, we also must consult with stakeholders, including English language experts, to determine the purpose of the primary language assessment and then move forward with development.

01:00:26.628 --> 01:00:32.592
The initial step in the process involved developing a high-level test design, which we are sharing with you today.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:44.890
Intent language of AB 484 focused on assisting educators in improving instruction and providing students with every opportunity to learn.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:49.733
This legislative intent is different than what we've ever done before in California.

01:00:50.613 --> 01:01:01.660
We're now focused on having a more comprehensive assessment system with a primary purpose of improving teaching and learning rather than developing assessments that are built solely for the purpose of accountability.

01:01:04.164 --> 01:01:12.726
To this end, we've put together a design team to work through the process of developing this high-level test design, which is attached to the board item.

01:01:13.926 --> 01:01:30.429
The design team includes nationally recognized experts in linguistics, Dr. Kenji Hakuta and Dr. Guadalupe Valdez, along with ETS, our contractor, who has experts in assessment development, psychometricians, and research scientists on the team.

01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:39.604
Based on the design team expertise and input, we are recommending the following test purposes.

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:47.411
Measure a student's competency in Spanish language arts and provide student level data in Spanish competency.

01:01:48.392 --> 01:01:55.698
Provide a measure to evaluate rather than penalize the implementation of Spanish language arts programs at the local level.

01:01:56.378 --> 01:02:01.683
And provide a high school measure suitable to be used in part for the state seal of biliteracy.

01:02:04.673 --> 01:02:10.256
We are privileged to have Dr. Kenji Hakuta with us today to share key aspects of the high-level test design.

01:02:10.896 --> 01:02:20.342
Dr. Hakuta is the professor of education at Stanford University, where he teaches courses in language development, bilingual education, research methods, and statistics.

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:28.546
His research is in the area of psycholinguistics, bilingualism, language shift, and the acquisition of English in immigrant students.

01:02:29.127 --> 01:02:33.449
He is actively involved in supporting the work of school districts and states around the country,

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:36.150
And we have been fortunate to have him on our design team.

01:02:44.611 --> 01:02:44.951
Welcome.

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:45.711
Hello.

01:02:48.412 --> 01:02:56.094
I'm pleased to be here, and I'm sorry that my good friend and colleague from Stanford, Mike Kirst, has just stepped out.

01:02:56.114 --> 01:03:02.295
I want to show him that I actually own a tie, and I have the ability to put it on, so I hope the record reflects that.

01:03:04.776 --> 01:03:11.083
It's a real pleasure to serve in this advisory capacity for this important project.

01:03:11.103 --> 01:03:18.911
I was just asked to speak to the high-level purposes for this assessment.

01:03:22.274 --> 01:03:45.255
the privilege of working with lots of school districts around California, both large and small, and having observed sort of the language diversity situation in California over many years, and think that this test really fulfills many of the needs that are out there in the field.

01:03:47.696 --> 01:03:59.541
One of the benefits is really recognizing the value of bilingualism and biliteracy, which I think the state is really a real leader for the nation.

01:04:00.346 --> 01:04:16.477
around sort of the recognizing language issues that especially Spanish-speaking students in California bring to this, not as a deficit to be overcome, but rather as an asset.

01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:23.903
And so I think just the pure recognition of having a high quality assessment that really measures this,

01:04:29.306 --> 01:04:30.727
is really of great value.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:42.914
The second point I want to make is that language development in any language really, what we really aspire to is to have literacy in the language.

01:04:43.435 --> 01:04:53.721
And so really the ability to develop literacy at a deep level in Spanish and having an assessment to measure that is important.

01:04:55.801 --> 01:05:04.143
Again, assessment, not for accountability purposes, but to inform instructional practices, I think is really important.

01:05:05.063 --> 01:05:20.727
Many students come to this country from Spanish-speaking countries and just understanding what they're bringing with them in terms of literacy in the native language itself will be highly

01:05:22.047 --> 01:05:26.728
helpful in informing the kind of programming that the students need.

01:05:28.629 --> 01:05:37.511
And also, I think that being able to look at these results in combination with the ELA assessment.

01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:40.312
So I think it's important to recognize that this is not

01:05:40.912 --> 01:05:46.460
a substitute for, in any way, the English language arts assessment.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:57.434
But to really think about this as truly looking at assessment or proficiency in both languages is really

01:05:59.037 --> 01:06:01.219
recognizing the value of bilingualism.

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:07.663
So again, this is not a translation of English language arts assessment into Spanish.

01:06:07.743 --> 01:06:17.910
It really is recognizing what value Spanish has is important, and that's reflected in the aspirations of the seal of biliteracy.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:26.616
The seal of biliteracy, which California again pioneered, is being used all over the nation now in many, many states.

01:06:27.376 --> 01:06:35.302
I think it really recognizes the true value of bilingualism among students.

01:06:36.522 --> 01:06:57.792
And then finally, I think that part of the value is the flexibility that's afforded to local districts around the LCAP, that this could be easily included in those plans as a way of monitoring progress towards biliteracy.

01:06:57.892 --> 01:07:01.474
So I think, you know, many of us think of the seal of biliteracy as sort of

01:07:02.014 --> 01:07:08.018
equivalent to what you would do at the end of the process, you know, similar to the high school graduation and so forth.

01:07:08.558 --> 01:07:24.928
But having an assessment that sort of takes a much broader sweep at the developmental progression at the lower grades and being able to assure that students are really progressing towards those goals of biliteracy, I think, is also important.

01:07:25.529 --> 01:07:29.491
So, thank you for allowing me to share some of these points.

01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:30.972
I think, Michelle, that's

01:07:31.741 --> 01:07:39.225
Yes, a question for you from Board Member Rucker, and we're honored that you wore a tie today.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:42.487
It's the first time I've ever seen you in one.

01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:43.087
I know.

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:45.709
I want to make sure that you know.

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:47.550
Yes, it's memorable.

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:49.471
And what color is it?

01:07:49.551 --> 01:07:50.671
What color is that tie?

01:07:51.952 --> 01:07:54.393
It's a Stanford color, but I'm wearing a blue shirt.

01:07:56.094 --> 01:07:59.799
Okay, so first giving honor to my board president, Dr. Kirst.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:09.252
I've always been starstruck from the first time I met Mike, but let me just say I'm starstruck sitting here getting a chance to talk to you and listen to this presentation.

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.835
So thank you for being here today.

01:08:11.355 --> 01:08:15.158
I do have a question for you on the biliteracy and bilingualism.

01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:24.586
Not only is California was a leader in creating the state's ill of biliteracy, California also did something else that was unique to the rest of the country.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:32.132
We actually created a certification for tribal elders to teach Native American languages to students

01:08:32.652 --> 01:08:33.654
in our schools.

01:08:34.115 --> 01:08:45.612
And so what I'm kind of, what is kind of left out of the conversation though currently on bilingualism and biliteracy are students who are the speakers of those languages as well.

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:48.497
How can we recognize that work

01:08:48.897 --> 01:08:53.763
and that teaching in those schools and in those classrooms in this conversation as well.

01:08:53.783 --> 01:09:05.856
So those students also have the opportunity to earn the state seal because I'm not really sure we have figured that out quite, or if we're reporting that, I'm not really aware that that data is available.

01:09:05.896 --> 01:09:09.240
So I'm hoping that some of that can be incorporated in the conversation too.

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:10.596
Thank you.

01:09:11.056 --> 01:09:38.251
I think it's, I'll step out of the assessment piece and mention, and I'd like to kind of recognize that the space around native Indian languages and how that's recognized publicly is really, it goes way beyond looking at

01:09:40.894 --> 01:09:51.526
It really requires a view of literacy that has to do with sort of the identity and history.

01:09:51.706 --> 01:09:55.550
And I mean, it just goes very, very deep into our

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:58.573
our kind of cultural heritage.

01:09:58.733 --> 01:10:02.856
And I think it enters into a very different space, I think.

01:10:04.137 --> 01:10:21.110
And I think it's, some of it has to do with the need to revive those languages, not just to, you know, because many of these languages have very, very few speakers left of it, or it's within certain domains.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:33.205
And so I recognize the importance of that, but I think also that it's really a space that almost has to be looked at from a bigger, broader historical and cultural lens.

01:10:33.413 --> 01:10:44.403
Yeah and so I know I could tell by the body language among the staff that there is some work that's being done in this and some recognition but I want to make sure because this is something that we are doing in California.

01:10:44.963 --> 01:10:59.737
ESSA in its reauthorization created in the section concerning Native American and Alaska Native education also encourages this level of flexibility but I want to be sure by the way we define by literacy and the way that students can earn

01:11:00.217 --> 01:11:01.218
that state seal.

01:11:01.519 --> 01:11:12.430
I think we have to figure out ways to make sure we're being inclusive of that since we have, we did this back in I believe 2007-2008 under the previous governor's administration.

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:22.261
This was actually signed into law so I'm hoping that this is an opportunity for us as we go forward on this level on this particular policy area to make sure we're paying attention to this as well.

01:11:22.554 --> 01:11:22.894
Thank you.

01:11:23.434 --> 01:11:30.938
If you did a word search through ESSA for bilingual, there's only one instance in which it appears, and that's under the Indian languages part, yes.

01:11:31.838 --> 01:11:35.340
Board member, who's next?

01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:38.101
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:38.962
Oh no, please come back.

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:43.936
An honor to finally meet you.

01:11:43.996 --> 01:11:48.079
I've heard about your work with my former boss, Elia Pompa, for years.

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:49.700
So it's great to meet you.

01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:55.583
I'm also a little starstruck, as I was with Dr. Kurz, because I cited him widely in the past.

01:11:56.104 --> 01:11:57.144
I have a question.

01:11:57.284 --> 01:12:05.469
You mentioned that you wouldn't recommend, I don't know if I heard this right, for accountability purposes, the assessment.

01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:06.390
Is that what I heard?

01:12:09.905 --> 01:12:17.048
I think you would have to think about that in the context of what you mean by accountability or how you want to shape the accountability system.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:24.871
If it's NCLB style accountability translated into ESSA, that's a different kind of conversation.

01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:33.855
And it's certainly not the intent of this to sort of fulfill something like that.

01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:48.831
And I think accountability in the sense of are we making progress towards and can we make improvements in our programs that support Spanish language and literacy development.

01:12:49.592 --> 01:12:52.413
this could certainly be a very useful tool.

01:12:52.473 --> 01:12:57.095
And that's why I was putting that in the context of the local accountability plans, for example.

01:12:57.535 --> 01:13:11.461
If that is truly a goal to support state-sealed biliteracy and you want to see whether students are progressing towards it, it could certainly be very helpful in that.

01:13:11.601 --> 01:13:12.822
And there's truly a lack of

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:39.883
instruments out there to accomplish this and that's personally the reason I'm the most excited about this because that's going to provide the incentive for systems to really put resources into the early grades for Spanish language development and hopefully for other languages as well by setting an example.

01:13:40.598 --> 01:13:40.818
Right.

01:13:40.878 --> 01:13:48.100
Because I know that we're waiting for the final regs on assessments, but there is something on primary language assessments in ESSA.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:54.502
And I was wondering how that would look if it was to be embedded into the accountability system.

01:13:54.582 --> 01:14:02.244
Like there are students who are newly arrived ELs that would be exempt for a year from the SBAC.

01:14:02.424 --> 01:14:04.265
So could this be one of the assessments?

01:14:05.146 --> 01:14:09.349
I know that for local purposes, for instance, my son's in a dual-language program.

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:14.855
I would like to know, is he really acquiring Spanish with a high level of proficiency?

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:19.058
Right now, he's still at the Yo Sepo stage instead of Yo Se.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.424
You know, so he definitely does a lot of the Chicano vernacular.

01:14:24.325 --> 01:14:30.874
But I am wondering, in general, how this could be incorporated, if it can be incorporated into an accountability system.

01:14:31.194 --> 01:14:32.236
Should it be incorporated?

01:14:32.316 --> 01:14:35.300
So those thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

01:14:36.345 --> 01:14:51.594
Yeah, I would say, you know, the larger context there too is, I mean, the technical issues around state plans and peer review and so forth, the technical requirements and so forth.

01:14:51.674 --> 01:14:56.016
And I don't think that this is, that's part of the consideration here.

01:14:56.957 --> 01:15:04.481
And that's, you know, again, I think outside the scope of the development of this, I believe it's more,

01:15:06.042 --> 01:15:10.625
more you guys' job to figure out how things like this could be used.

01:15:10.645 --> 01:15:16.008
Okay, any other board member comments on this item?

01:15:16.989 --> 01:15:19.430
Do we have public comment on the item?

01:15:20.411 --> 01:15:22.832
Do you want me to give you any more information on the test?

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:24.013
Okay, continue then.

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.775
Kenji just wowed you so much.

01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:31.098
I know, next time I need action, I'm just bringing Kenji.

01:15:32.802 --> 01:15:37.646
No matter what the topic, Kenji.

01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:39.107
Next time, yeah.

01:15:40.868 --> 01:15:41.489
So thank you.

01:15:41.789 --> 01:15:42.450
Thank you, Kenji.

01:15:43.510 --> 01:15:47.353
I want to talk about who would take this test, the target population.

01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:52.397
So consistent with Ed Code, the design team identified the following target population.

01:15:52.938 --> 01:15:55.660
Students receiving Spanish instruction in California.

01:15:56.281 --> 01:16:01.765
Any student seeking to assess their Spanish-specific reading, writing, and listening skills.

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:12.031
So this would be students who are recently arrived as well as those students that are seeking the seal of biliteracy or a pathway to the seal of biliteracy.

01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:23.058
And just want to point out that there are multiple pathways to that seal and this is not in any way to mean that this would would eliminate the other pathways to getting that seal in California.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:29.702
So there were key assumptions that were developed by the design team and let me

01:16:31.243 --> 01:16:32.424
as well as with the department.

01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:38.727
The first assumption is that this test would be aligned with the Common Core Standards for English Language Arts in Español.

01:16:39.527 --> 01:16:44.770
This is a translation of the Common Core ELA standards with linguistic augmentation.

01:16:44.890 --> 01:16:50.392
So it is not simply a translation of our Common Core Standards.

01:16:50.732 --> 01:16:55.875
So that would include things like an example I have here, since I do not speak Spanish,

01:16:56.515 --> 01:16:59.578
is masculine and feminine articles for nouns.

01:16:59.898 --> 01:17:02.400
That would be addressed in those particular standards.

01:17:03.261 --> 01:17:07.025
Another assumption is that it will assess reading, writing, and listening.

01:17:07.365 --> 01:17:22.158
Speaking is not currently a part of the assessment design, given the current difficulties with assessing speaking on these types of standardized assessments, but we'll continue to monitor the research in that area over the course of time.

01:17:23.007 --> 01:17:27.529
Like other CASP assessments, the CSA will be a computer-based assessment.

01:17:28.330 --> 01:17:32.332
We are proposing that it will be administered in grades 3 through 8 in high school.

01:17:33.092 --> 01:17:45.019
Additionally, a focus will be on providing accessibility supports for students with disabilities similar to those that are provided for other CASP assessments, but that are appropriate given the construct that's being measured on this test.

01:17:47.062 --> 01:17:49.043
This test is an optional assessment.

01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:55.205
It will be developed to be fair, valid for the purposes that are outlined before you today, and reliable.

01:17:55.886 --> 01:17:59.707
The proposed design does not utilize human scoring for this assessment.

01:18:02.389 --> 01:18:04.429
This is the timeline for development.

01:18:04.569 --> 01:18:10.552
It is very aggressive, you will see, and one of the six assessments that are currently under development.

01:18:15.243 --> 01:18:19.727
you will see it gets to spring 2019 as the operational test.

01:18:20.207 --> 01:18:33.837
One of the reasons we're able to do that is California did own quite a few reading passages that were used in our other tests, so we're able to reevaluate those passages to see if they're aligned with the Common Core Espanol and if we're able to use those passages.

01:18:33.897 --> 01:18:41.163
So that's one reason we're able to be a little more efficient with this assessment and the timing that you see before you.

01:18:43.574 --> 01:18:56.578
So in conclusion, I'm asking that you approve the proposed high-level test design for the California Spanish assessment, thus allowing for the development activities to continue as proposed in the timeline here.

01:18:58.539 --> 01:18:58.879
All right.

01:18:59.879 --> 01:19:00.860
No further comment.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.041
Public comment then on this assessment item only.

01:19:04.101 --> 01:19:08.942
Then we'll have public comment on the general presentation of assessment.

01:19:09.482 --> 01:19:11.603
So any public comment on the English

01:19:12.842 --> 01:19:14.169
and Spanish assessment.

01:19:25.782 --> 01:19:32.745
Good morning, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz, and I'm here representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

01:19:33.565 --> 01:19:47.130
We are pleased with the work that's been done so far on the CSA and are also very pleased to see that CDE is working with two well-respected experts in the field of

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:54.355
Linguistics and also recognized as experts with regards to English learners, Drs.

01:19:54.395 --> 01:19:58.317
Hakuta and Valdez, we're pleased to see that the department is working with them.

01:19:59.398 --> 01:20:02.480
We support continuing the work on the CSA.

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:10.965
We think it's very important, especially in light of the increased number of dual language programs that are being established statewide.

01:20:11.886 --> 01:20:26.312
We also look forward to a continued conversation about the role of the CSA in the accountability system, and with all due respect to Dr. Hakuta Kenji, we believe that there is a role of the CSA in the accountability system.

01:20:26.852 --> 01:20:28.833
It will require additional discussion,

01:20:29.793 --> 01:20:47.017
and it will require additional work, but we believe that now is the time to really take a look at what is the best policy with regards to assessing English learners, especially English learners who are not yet English proficient when they're only being tested with English assessments.

01:20:47.457 --> 01:20:51.998
English assessments may not necessarily provide the most accurate, valid,

01:20:52.498 --> 01:20:57.041
a reliable measure of what they can actually do academically.

01:20:57.502 --> 01:21:11.091
So we look forward to continuing this conversation with CDE staff, NSBE staff, and we believe that this is a good opportunity to really begin discussing the whole policy assessment issue with regards to English learners.

01:21:11.352 --> 01:21:11.692
Thank you.

01:21:13.533 --> 01:21:17.956
Okay, hearing that, so I'd like a motion on this assessment.

01:21:19.257 --> 01:21:20.278
One more speaker, sorry.

01:21:26.311 --> 01:21:27.671
Good morning, surprise.

01:21:29.072 --> 01:21:30.152
Karen Cadero Kaplan.

01:21:30.732 --> 01:21:34.534
Okay, I was like, what title should I use today?

01:21:34.874 --> 01:21:42.536
I'm San Diego State University professor and I'm also representing CABE as I'm on their board as a Director of Legislative Affairs.

01:21:43.297 --> 01:21:48.163
And I just wanted to, I'm just glad I had the opportunity to be here today to speak in support of this.

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:57.434
It's exciting to, you know, working with the folks you are, with Kenji and Guadalupe Valdez, it's really exciting to see how that's informing.

01:21:57.834 --> 01:22:02.019
So we do support the work of CDE and continuing the development of the CSA.

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:12.047
I do want to say right now, part of the work I'm involved in is the preparation of bilingual teachers, and we have a shortage of bilingual teachers.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:24.337
And in order to address that need, we have to ensure that students in these biliteracy dual language programs, the seal of biliteracy is really important in that how do we document their achievement in those two languages?

01:22:24.797 --> 01:22:27.279
And if the demand for the teachers is there, it starts in K-12.

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:51.450
So the question that you posed around how would this look in accountability, I think that is a larger discussion because what we're seeing right now, I just came from CTC and it's really exciting that as they're looking at how we need to open the pipeline, they made the decision today to not have the CSET waiver, I mean to re-implement the CSET waiver programs for elementary programs, right?

01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:59.036
So that's part of a movement towards looking at, you know, how accountability works with what makes sense for programs and growth.

01:22:59.456 --> 01:23:13.047
So I think as we look, as you look towards this with accountability, we need to consider the deeper discussions and what's the intersections with EL assessments, with Spanish language assessments, and then to the point of other languages, how would that look going forward?

01:23:13.067 --> 01:23:16.650
So I think this is a historic moment and supporting this is really important.

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:16.950
Thank you.

01:23:20.508 --> 01:23:23.892
Seeing no other public comment, I'd like a motion then on this assessment.

01:23:26.696 --> 01:23:27.096
Go ahead.

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.307
I move approval of the Spanish language assessment process.

01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:42.150
Would you like to do it?

01:23:42.570 --> 01:23:43.391
No, that's not how you do it.

01:23:43.711 --> 01:23:49.413
I move approval of a Spanish language development test, the design and process.

01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:53.195
Did I get it, Judy?

01:23:53.235 --> 01:23:54.636
You want to say it, then I'll move approval.

01:23:59.058 --> 01:24:04.040
Okay, I move CDE's recommendation regarding the high-level test design for the California Spanish assessment.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.400
I second that.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.582
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hands.

01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:17.729
Okay, and I think now we will take public comment on the general assessment of CASP.

01:24:33.687 --> 01:24:33.987
Thank you.

01:24:34.007 --> 01:24:34.708
Good morning again.

01:24:34.888 --> 01:24:37.329
I'm Doug McRae, a retired test publisher from Monterey.

01:24:38.169 --> 01:24:42.011
I submitted two handouts to your electronic folder last week.

01:24:42.532 --> 01:24:52.657
First, an August 9th set of comments on the California Peer Review submission to the Feds, as well as the Smarter Balanced Peer Review submission to the Feds.

01:24:52.857 --> 01:24:55.418
That was an 11-page document.

01:24:56.279 --> 01:25:02.462
The front page mentions the opportunity to learn issues that I've talked to you many times about.

01:25:02.962 --> 01:25:18.016
But it also, on the Smarter Balanced peer review, quote, revealed, as they say, the technical report revealed some gaps in item coverage at the low end of the performance spectrum and means

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:30.728
Fundamentally, that hurts the precision and accuracy of scores for low-scoring students, particularly English learners and low-wealth and students with disabilities.

01:25:31.208 --> 01:25:39.416
But more so, it compromises the ability of the tool to measure achievement gaps at this point until that flaw is corrected.

01:25:41.057 --> 01:25:49.481
So, in addition to the Department capacity, the actual measure has a problem with respect to measuring performance gaps.

01:25:49.942 --> 01:25:54.444
The second handout had to do with the August 24th release of the 2016 results, and on that

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:04.310
I included comparisons to other states.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:10.855
One point I'd make on that is the extreme difference in grade 11 English language arts versus math.

01:26:11.716 --> 01:26:24.105
I think it is due to unfortunate standard setting, performance setting, revisions made by the chiefs at the tail end of the panel process that lead to that thing.

01:26:24.225 --> 01:26:28.409
I don't think there is that big a difference between English language arts and math at grade level.

01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:37.031
Also, finally, the state-by-state comparisons for 13, there's a 14th state that's out.

01:26:37.612 --> 01:26:51.296
There is some experience in there with respect to using other metrics, scale scores, for gain, growth, improvement, growth, whatever, that type of measurement, but lessons to be learned from other states.

01:26:51.796 --> 01:26:52.076
Thank you.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:02.822
Good morning, I'm Sheila Whitley and I'm here representing the California Teachers Association.

01:27:03.942 --> 01:27:13.368
We've made so many needed changes for education in the last few years and our board and our staff at CDE is certainly to be commended for all of these efforts.

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:22.915
We've talked about some of them this morning, the Seal of Biliteracy, it's a wonderful way to recognize our students that have developed some skills that are much needed in California.

01:27:23.815 --> 01:27:30.678
But as an educator, I am concerned that the report does not provide useful information for district sites and teachers.

01:27:32.338 --> 01:27:35.779
Basically, board member Rucker has talked about some of this.

01:27:35.859 --> 01:27:50.625
The data analysis that was done without some of this being usable data being available to sites, to teachers, it's very difficult for us to address the achievement gap of our most needy kids.

01:27:50.945 --> 01:27:53.306
We're working on all of these with our LCAP data.

01:27:57.609 --> 01:28:08.197
Really, the purpose of giving some kind of test is to help inform instruction and to help us do better to meet the needs of our kids.

01:28:08.237 --> 01:28:13.801
We really need to know what we're doing well and what we need to focus on to do better in the classroom.

01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:17.383
We ask you to defer this and to work with staff.

01:28:19.565 --> 01:28:26.673
and the other experts to help us figure out a way to provide this data in a useful, meaningful way for educators.

01:28:27.074 --> 01:28:27.795
Thank you very much.

01:28:34.505 --> 01:28:40.467
Mr. President, members of the board, I'm Brian Rivas on behalf of the Education Trust West.

01:28:41.408 --> 01:28:47.630
We really appreciated your discussion this morning about gaps and modeling and data analysis.

01:28:47.810 --> 01:28:59.655
I would just ask that you consider one of the things that you could do in the spirit of closing gaps is articulate formally that it is your expectation that LEAs close gaps.

01:28:59.675 --> 01:29:01.656
I think that would be a powerful incentive.

01:29:02.736 --> 01:29:09.482
I wanted to lift up a general topic with regard to testing and assessment, and that is performance tasks.

01:29:10.242 --> 01:29:15.887
We think that it's important for all students to demonstrate not only what they know, but also what they're able to do.

01:29:15.907 --> 01:29:24.654
I think you're thinking along those lines already, but from an equity point of view, we want to highlight that it's particularly important for English learners.

01:29:25.174 --> 01:29:29.375
to be able to demonstrate mastery of content across all subject areas.

01:29:29.575 --> 01:29:36.037
So we'd ask that you please keep that in mind going forward as you think about things like the NGSS assessments.

01:29:36.397 --> 01:29:36.617
Thanks.

01:29:38.777 --> 01:29:41.078
Okay, that completes that item.

01:29:41.398 --> 01:29:44.319
And so now we're on to the next item.

01:29:46.119 --> 01:29:46.339
Pardon?

01:29:47.665 --> 01:29:48.906
No.

01:29:50.007 --> 01:29:51.028
Yeah, item five.

01:29:51.649 --> 01:29:54.731
And so these are the consolidated applications.

01:29:56.132 --> 01:29:59.495
And we're going to take these in two batches.

01:29:59.895 --> 01:30:04.799
One where Eileen and Ting must recuse themselves.

01:30:11.484 --> 01:30:13.726
And this is action

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:21.607
They're recusing themselves.

01:30:22.407 --> 01:30:29.189
Okay, this motion one I'm asking for is on five consolidated applications.

01:30:31.589 --> 01:30:31.910
Pardon?

01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.151
Okay, well let me just announce them.

01:30:35.171 --> 01:30:37.811
110 Arcadia, 931 Monrovia, 975 Natomas,

01:30:45.443 --> 01:30:49.305
1268 San Marino, 1339 Soledad.

01:30:50.186 --> 01:30:52.407
So you may proceed.

01:30:52.607 --> 01:30:55.588
That's what we're talking about in this particular motion.

01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:57.509
Yes, my name is Jerry Winkler.

01:30:57.529 --> 01:31:02.252
I'm the Director for the Educational Data Management Division here at the CDE.

01:31:03.412 --> 01:31:06.054
I have the privilege of reporting that we are

01:31:07.222 --> 01:31:17.167
approving, or we're recommending for approval, 1,570 of the LEAs that have submitted consolidated applications.

01:31:18.328 --> 01:31:20.248
They're all on regular approval.

01:31:20.269 --> 01:31:21.709
We're recommending them for regular approval.

01:31:21.729 --> 01:31:26.291
We don't have any that are on conditional approval.

01:31:26.372 --> 01:31:30.934
So it's a rather easy board item, and quick.

01:31:34.952 --> 01:31:43.397
Okay, so are there, we're ready then for a motion on, is there any public comment on this?

01:31:44.538 --> 01:31:47.860
No, okay, we're ready for a motion on the five that I read.

01:31:49.421 --> 01:31:50.701
I'll move approval.

01:31:50.721 --> 01:31:55.244
All right, all those in favor, raise your hands.

01:31:56.185 --> 01:31:59.927
Okay, so our board members may come back and now

01:32:01.167 --> 01:32:03.309
Yeah, we need action two.

01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:11.775
And board member Ortiz-Lacon is recusing herself from motion two.

01:32:16.539 --> 01:32:29.809
So motion two is to approve the remaining 216, 217 CONAPs except the five that we already approved in motion one.

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:34.602
So do you want to make any comment on these or no?

01:32:34.802 --> 01:32:35.162
OK.

01:32:36.363 --> 01:32:38.103
Any public comment on this motion?

01:32:38.243 --> 01:32:38.464
No.

01:32:39.164 --> 01:32:40.585
Do we have a motion of approval?

01:32:46.067 --> 01:32:46.907
All right.

01:32:47.408 --> 01:32:50.369
Seeing no further discussion, all in favor, raise your hands.

01:32:51.710 --> 01:32:56.632
OK, now we have the regular consent items.

01:32:58.459 --> 01:33:00.240
And we can get Felusa for those.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:00.500
Yeah.

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:00.681
Okay.

01:33:00.721 --> 01:33:02.442
You want to take a break now?

01:33:02.482 --> 01:33:02.682
Yes.

01:33:44.263 --> 01:33:47.605
1, 2, 3, 4.

01:33:46.104 --> 01:33:47.605
We have a quorum, yeah, okay.

01:33:48.125 --> 01:33:53.427
So we could take a, we could approve the consent calendar.

01:33:54.508 --> 01:33:55.308
I move the consent.

01:33:56.108 --> 01:33:59.690
Those are, and on proposed consent are items 6 through 11.

01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:03.832
Is there any public comment on the consent calendar?

01:34:05.512 --> 01:34:05.852
Pardon?

01:34:06.313 --> 01:34:06.813
I'll second.

01:34:08.652 --> 01:34:10.613
So we have a motion and it's been seconded.

01:34:11.973 --> 01:34:13.874
All right, no public comment on that.

01:34:14.994 --> 01:34:18.256
All right, let's raise your hands if you approve the consent items.

01:34:21.997 --> 01:34:36.723
In that regard, and then I want to, before we take a break, call up Kristen Wright so that I could present her with our State Board of Education Certificate of Appreciation and Commendation.

01:34:37.398 --> 01:34:39.660
Please come forward for your certificate.

01:34:41.741 --> 01:34:48.546
There you go.

01:34:48.666 --> 01:34:49.627
Congratulations.

01:34:49.827 --> 01:34:51.568
We'll see you later.

01:35:05.074 --> 01:35:07.655
All right, let's take a 10-minute break till 10 after 10.

01:35:38.013 --> 01:35:38.114
you

01:36:06.316 --> 01:36:08.277
1, 2, 6, 8, through 17.

01:36:08.337 --> 01:36:08.898
None?

01:36:08.918 --> 01:36:10.819
I move the consent.

01:36:10.839 --> 01:36:11.279
I second.

01:36:14.981 --> 01:36:15.221
Okay.

01:36:15.261 --> 01:36:16.422
Any comments on the motion?

01:36:17.642 --> 01:36:18.463
All those in favor?

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:23.506
Okay.

01:36:25.026 --> 01:36:28.769
Now we are on individual waivers.

01:36:28.869 --> 01:36:31.350
So item waiver number three.

01:36:41.431 --> 01:36:44.153
Good morning Board Member Strauss and Superintendent Torlakson.

01:36:44.193 --> 01:36:49.298
My name is Chris Druin and I'm once again the Associate Director of the Special Education Division.

01:36:51.460 --> 01:37:00.108
Item 3 is a request by the Cypress Elementary School District for a caseload waiver for an RSP program.

01:37:00.768 --> 01:37:08.035
This item was originally brought to us for July and we pulled it and rescheduled for September

01:37:09.155 --> 01:37:15.461
Due to some concerns about the timing of the waiver, the waiver took place in the 14-15 school year.

01:37:15.481 --> 01:37:20.665
The caseload exceeded in 14-15, but we did not receive it until the 15-16 school year.

01:37:24.228 --> 01:37:31.051
We understand that there was a snafu in the District Administrative Office.

01:37:31.291 --> 01:37:48.819
Apparently there was a personnel change in the Special Education Director, and that person thought that the Human Resources Department filed waivers, and the Human Resources Department thought that the Special Education Director filed the waiver.

01:37:51.020 --> 01:38:01.809
They called us and asked if they could still file the waiver, and we looked at the rules around the timing, and it apparently qualifies under the rules for timing, so we said that they could.

01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:17.362
We also, in going through discussions with board staff and our own staff and the CDE, identified some things that were of concern that we ought to look into

01:38:18.623 --> 01:38:21.627
related to comments made by the teacher in this case.

01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:34.062
While the teacher did not voice any opposition to the waiver, she did indicate that she did have some concern about the reporting of the numbers in the caseload.

01:38:35.564 --> 01:38:43.269
And so we went back to the district and it gave us some time to go question the district about the caseloads for that 14-15 school year.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:52.375
They were able to provide us with a report that indicated that confirmed the caseload exceeded 28 by one student and for 29.

01:38:54.236 --> 01:39:11.123
We also got information about that teacher's KSOAD for 15-16, and the KSOAD was 27 for that year, so the KSOAD did remain below the required amount.

01:39:13.542 --> 01:39:23.468
They also provided us with documentation that the aid hours had already been provided, given that there was a 14-15 waiver.

01:39:23.549 --> 01:39:26.771
So we are recommending approval with conditions.

01:39:27.731 --> 01:39:34.015
The standard one that we include in these has to do with assurance that they provide the aid time that's recommended.

01:39:34.596 --> 01:39:39.659
And they actually, as I said, have increased the aid time from 3.75 to 5.75 hours.

01:39:43.142 --> 01:39:44.927
recommending approval with that condition.

01:39:47.054 --> 01:39:49.642
So do we have any comments from board members?

01:39:49.943 --> 01:39:50.484
Member Sandoval?

01:39:51.175 --> 01:40:00.599
Yeah, I looked at this one very carefully, and I appreciate you addressing the questions that I had about this particular case.

01:40:00.739 --> 01:40:11.384
And I think that it is unfortunate that it took a whole year to get the proper approvals, and it doesn't make it okay to let time lapse because there are changes.

01:40:11.564 --> 01:40:13.545
It's everyone's responsibility to make sure

01:40:14.085 --> 01:40:16.507
that things are filed in a timely manner.

01:40:17.267 --> 01:40:22.211
But there are no documented previous complaints in this particular case.

01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:23.172
Not that we're aware of.

01:40:23.212 --> 01:40:28.175
This is a waiver that's the only waiver they filed that we have in our records.

01:40:28.356 --> 01:40:28.616
Right.

01:40:28.876 --> 01:40:33.559
And they are below the minimum or the maximum caseload.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.301
And they did provide the eight hours.

01:40:35.881 --> 01:40:39.544
So with that information, I would move approval of the CDE's recommendation.

01:40:41.374 --> 01:40:42.137
Any other comments?

01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:43.962
Do we have a second?

01:40:45.627 --> 01:40:47.292
Oh, are there speakers for this item?

01:40:53.871 --> 01:40:54.331
Good morning.

01:40:55.212 --> 01:40:57.774
Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association.

01:40:57.955 --> 01:41:03.139
And the main comments on this is similar to what was stated in that it's extremely late.

01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:10.185
And I know it was expressed due to a processing error, or the technical term snafu was used.

01:41:10.786 --> 01:41:14.089
But I think just no further explanation is really needed.

01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:15.850
But it's extremely, extremely late.

01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:17.412
So therefore, CTA is opposed to it.

01:41:17.592 --> 01:41:17.832
Thank you.

01:41:21.041 --> 01:41:22.241
Any more comments on the waiver?

01:41:23.282 --> 01:41:23.822
And Barrecker?

01:41:25.383 --> 01:41:31.945
So we look at these caseload waivers for this particular program all the time.

01:41:32.825 --> 01:41:50.112
And while it is important that the waiver does need to be approved, I think we need to take a look at what seems to be a norm for what happens in these programs that create the conditions either by salutary neglect

01:41:50.552 --> 01:41:56.577
or poor planning, poor monitoring, poor oversight that make these kind of waivers important.

01:41:57.057 --> 01:42:14.691
And so it concerns me that in my entire tenure on the board, we regularly have to look at these kind of caseload waivers that happen not because of some emergency or some unanticipated activity in the program, but simply because of salutary neglect.

01:42:15.251 --> 01:42:25.080
So I think it is incumbent on us to think about what is happening to the quality of the services that are being provided to these students when incidents like this occur.

01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:40.313
Because even though the waiver is being granted, there is no accountability on the LEA to make sure that this doesn't continue happening or to understand the circumstances that led to this so that it doesn't happen again.

01:42:40.713 --> 01:42:42.335
Because it's not a surprise.

01:42:42.955 --> 01:42:48.977
when you suddenly discover that you have more students in your program than the caseload should allow.

01:42:49.237 --> 01:42:57.280
That's something they do know or they do have a way of figuring out and understanding long before the need for the waiver occurs.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.062
And so while at this level, at the 5,000 foot level, it's incumbent upon our responsibility

01:43:03.562 --> 01:43:04.962
to approve the waiver.

01:43:05.402 --> 01:43:31.108
I think we do need to start thinking about the fact that waivers like this create in districts a lack of responsibility or obligation to consider the quality of the program they're providing to the students, to consider what they are doing to the teachers who are tasked to provide this service, and to the teaching assistants who have to provide the additional support, and whether or not in the long term

01:43:31.508 --> 01:43:46.721
that actually wears down not only the workforce but also in some ways detracts from the work we've already had a conversation on earlier about what contributes to closing the achievement gap for students who fall into this particular subgroup.

01:43:47.161 --> 01:43:56.529
So we do need to think about what it means when districts continue to do this and continue to need this particular waiver because they are not doing the work they should do

01:43:56.989 --> 01:44:03.921
to improve their workforce, to add to their workforce, and to take the steps to assure the waiver is not necessary.

01:44:04.659 --> 01:44:08.382
We can't fix that by a failing, by denying the waiver.

01:44:08.822 --> 01:44:14.966
And we also, I think we need to recognize we haven't solved the problem by approving the waiver either.

01:44:15.346 --> 01:44:34.519
So I think, I'm hoping, and I've had this conversation with staff and I've asked them to have some conversations with these LEAs, particularly those who are the repeat offenders who continue to come back and ask for these waivers because they're clearly not doing the work they should be doing to prevent the circumstance from occurring.

01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:37.201
Thank you.

01:44:37.561 --> 01:44:38.762
Are there any other board comments?

01:44:41.745 --> 01:44:43.666
And we have a motion and we have the second?

01:44:44.747 --> 01:44:47.309
Okay.

01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:49.811
So all those in favor of the motion?

01:44:53.314 --> 01:44:53.594
Okay.

01:44:53.874 --> 01:44:54.535
Motion passes.

01:44:55.155 --> 01:44:55.495
Thank you.

01:44:55.535 --> 01:44:56.556
We're on to waiver four.

01:44:59.839 --> 01:45:02.461
I'm going to take off on your comments because we're at Poway.

01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.442
Yeah, no, you just set me up perfectly again.

01:45:08.462 --> 01:45:09.563
It was great, thanks.

01:45:12.686 --> 01:45:17.490
Pali Unified School District has an illustrious history of requesting RSP waivers.

01:45:17.610 --> 01:45:22.775
They requested four waivers in 15-16, five waivers in 16-17, and two of those are today.

01:45:31.904 --> 01:45:34.026
Most of those waivers are in different caseloads.

01:45:34.786 --> 01:45:40.272
So there's only one that's a repeat in one school, but they are different RSP teachers.

01:45:40.852 --> 01:45:49.301
So they don't violate, necessarily, any of the particular requirements that are in the waiver guidelines.

01:45:50.442 --> 01:45:54.846
But they have a history over a couple of years.

01:45:59.226 --> 01:46:03.990
There were a number of questions that we looked into and that were raised.

01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:09.215
One, the teacher in one of these was identified as being on probation.

01:46:09.715 --> 01:46:12.598
That's been a concern of this board previously.

01:46:12.958 --> 01:46:14.579
That teacher is not on probation.

01:46:14.619 --> 01:46:16.541
The teacher's been teaching in the district since 1998.

01:46:17.021 --> 01:46:18.202
So we've verified that.

01:46:23.089 --> 01:46:40.844
The teacher made comments about anticipating going over in the subsequent year, and she was thinking that she might be over as much as 32 students.

01:46:42.205 --> 01:46:50.912
The district indicated in their response that they have overstaffed the schools this year, and I have more information about that in the next thing.

01:46:53.153 --> 01:46:57.595
There was also a question about the term monitor only.

01:46:58.635 --> 01:47:08.938
It appeared when they made the waiver application that they were sort of, in some way, almost excusing the overage by saying, well, some of these kids don't need as much service.

01:47:09.898 --> 01:47:10.939
I understand.

01:47:11.699 --> 01:47:14.040
So we questioned what monitor only meant.

01:47:16.081 --> 01:47:24.390
They don't really have a good definition, and neither of the teachers that we contacted used that term when we questioned it.

01:47:24.871 --> 01:47:29.456
They don't know that they have monitor-only students, if that's the case.

01:47:32.739 --> 01:47:36.223
You may recall that in July, we added an additional

01:47:38.944 --> 01:47:54.444
condition, and that condition was that the district report to us on their efforts to recruit and hire teachers, and we have some information from them.

01:47:56.106 --> 01:48:01.171
One of our staff contacted Poway to get information about their efforts to recruit and hire RSPs.

01:48:02.192 --> 01:48:09.700
They provided documentation about their recruitment efforts over the summer that predated the requirement from this board.

01:48:11.181 --> 01:48:26.842
They have done a number of things in terms of job fairs, developing professional assistance programs, developing a program for mentored teachers, for new teachers, and also added an internship program to try to kind of grow their own, as it were.

01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:36.306
As a result, they report that currently all positions are filled with the exception of one 40 percent RSP position.

01:48:36.346 --> 01:48:42.127
They indicated that they are interviewing candidates, and they are confident that they will shortly be at 100 percent capacity.

01:48:42.167 --> 01:48:44.568
This is as of the end of last week.

01:48:45.728 --> 01:48:48.711
We are not happy that that's enough information.

01:48:48.751 --> 01:49:00.139
We have asked them to provide us with a listing of all of the positions at all of the schools and indicate the caseloads as of this time, because as Member Rucker pointed out, they could be at 28 today and

01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:05.244
be on the verge of going over.

01:49:06.665 --> 01:49:15.573
So they have documented the provision of additional aid time and they have begun to complete the other recommendation.

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:23.839
We added the same recommendation again.

01:49:27.924 --> 01:49:34.252
After your comments, I think that may be the same recommendation, which is to

01:49:35.033 --> 01:49:38.776
document your recruitment and hiring efforts may not go far enough.

01:49:39.577 --> 01:49:46.722
So we had crafted a proposal, again, that in case that came up in the discussion that we might offer to you.

01:49:47.582 --> 01:49:53.147
And so we thought that the district, something like this might work better in this case.

01:49:53.167 --> 01:50:02.734
And that would be the district must report monthly to the Special Education Division of the California Department of Education on the caseload of each RSP teacher in the district.

01:50:03.334 --> 01:50:10.878
and actions they're taking to secure additional staff to support RSP teachers who are at risk for exceeding the maximum caseload.

01:50:10.918 --> 01:50:15.400
And in parentheses it says, those teachers who have reached the maximum caseload of 28 students.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.282
So that might be something that would be helpful.

01:50:19.562 --> 01:50:24.627
I think that it through the if you don't mind, I think that at risk point is a good idea.

01:50:25.008 --> 01:50:35.878
Because again, it's not a surprise when districts know that their caseload for their RSP programs are going to change because they know how many students are in the queue and under review in their student studies team process.

01:50:36.179 --> 01:50:40.183
They know what the recommendations or the request from the student study teams are.

01:50:40.563 --> 01:50:54.447
And even though we don't consider resources in making the decisions and evaluating students in student study, it is the district's responsibility to know whether or not they have the resources to meet what is being requested.

01:50:54.727 --> 01:51:03.110
So they know if their programs are at risk of being over those caseloads because they know what's going on in their student study team process.

01:51:03.130 --> 01:51:06.431
So it's a very clear idea in understanding what risk means.

01:51:06.451 --> 01:51:07.911
So we're not asking them to link

01:51:08.251 --> 01:51:13.094
the decisions they make in their student study team process to whether or not the resources are available.

01:51:13.134 --> 01:51:25.080
We're asking them to be aware, knowing that they have students who could be placed in those programs, whether or not those programs have the resources available and they have addressed how they're going to do this if there is a gap.

01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:27.161
So I think that that is an excellent idea.

01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:29.762
Member Sandoval.

01:51:31.763 --> 01:51:36.165
Yeah, when I was reading the rationale in the waiver request about

01:51:38.044 --> 01:51:48.588
It said that, or whoever wrote the waiver request said that many students are on monitor status and it seemed to minimize the impact, right?

01:51:49.648 --> 01:51:52.369
So what does many mean?

01:51:52.529 --> 01:51:55.710
How many students are we talking about?

01:52:00.084 --> 01:52:10.367
Would you clarify, first of all, just to follow up, you did a lot of research with the district, so could you clarify, do you know how many students are just on watch, probably watching consults, what that is?

01:52:10.967 --> 01:52:16.449
So those were words that we got in the printed waiver.

01:52:16.929 --> 01:52:23.531
When we called up subsequently to investigate that, as you asked this question before,

01:52:25.112 --> 01:52:29.496
There was no answer because it isn't a real thing, I don't think.

01:52:29.736 --> 01:52:32.058
The teachers didn't know what it meant.

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.299
They don't use that term.

01:52:33.359 --> 01:52:36.322
So we could not get a number for you.

01:52:36.702 --> 01:52:47.292
So that concerns me because even with the addition of the condition that you just mentioned, monthly reporting, I'm concerned about the accuracy of the reporting.

01:52:52.282 --> 01:52:53.944
So, I don't know if, I mean, I appreciate.

01:52:54.324 --> 01:53:02.791
So, Member Sandoval, do you think the conditions that the department's recommending will address your concern, or would you like to modify what the recommendation is?

01:53:02.831 --> 01:53:13.020
Well, it's a question because if you ask for monthly reporting, but if we're not confident that we're getting accurate information, then what good is a report every month?

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:34.893
It occurs to me, and I don't know whether it's appropriate for me to engage like this, but I'm not always appropriate, so I'll just do it anyway, is that I think that should they make another waiver request, then we would need to perhaps go look at what they're doing and look at documentation on site.

01:53:35.693 --> 01:53:48.266
We have, by the way, received a waiver request in a district that we are doing just that before we bring it to the board because it is so egregious that we are not comfortable even just making phone calls.

01:53:48.286 --> 01:53:49.387
We're going to go look at records.

01:53:49.407 --> 01:53:51.749
We're taking a team in and sort of swooping.

01:53:51.769 --> 01:53:56.895
I mean, because the caseload caseloads are reportedly exceeding 36.

01:53:56.955 --> 01:53:57.075
Oh, wow.

01:53:58.717 --> 01:54:00.320
So it's, it's not, it's bad.

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:11.680
So we're, but in this particular case, respectfully, I would suggest that should they make another waiver request, then, you know, it's a new game.

01:54:12.663 --> 01:54:30.918
So I just would like to add is that the students I believe that they're saying is monitoring is typically before a student is exited from the IEP, they often do full mainstreaming and they put them on what a district calls watch and consult so that they haven't lost the ability to pull them back in if they need extra special ed support.

01:54:30.978 --> 01:54:38.084
So when you're checking on that, I think that's the kind of thing in addition to the monthly recruiting report that you're asking for,

01:54:38.884 --> 01:54:50.088
Because that's the idea that the teacher is available and the aid is available to support, but the student is fully mainstreamed and they're not ready to fully exit them from the program.

01:54:50.128 --> 01:54:55.429
And that may be what they're talking about as far as the teacher's not working directly with the student.

01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:59.751
But monitoring still is time on that caseload.

01:55:00.331 --> 01:55:02.492
And so it still needs to be considered.

01:55:02.532 --> 01:55:18.857
I mean, we approved a waiver where the RSP teachers agreed that they were going to, instead of doing their paperwork during their contract time, that they were going to be doing that on unpaid time to make sure that they were maximizing their access to students during their contract day.

01:55:19.357 --> 01:55:22.138
So, and I had concerns about approving something like that.

01:55:22.178 --> 01:55:23.119
That's just crazy.

01:55:23.459 --> 01:55:27.360
But even for students who are on whatever this term monitoring means,

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.700
It's time.

01:55:29.041 --> 01:55:35.463
It's instructional time that's taken away from students that are on that RSP teacher's load who need the instruction.

01:55:35.783 --> 01:55:37.483
So how much time is that?

01:55:37.823 --> 01:55:39.304
How often is that done?

01:55:39.604 --> 01:55:42.485
And how many students are simply being monitored?

01:55:42.505 --> 01:55:51.528
But more importantly, since the RSP teachers didn't know that there are students on their caseload that they were simply monitoring, I suspect that's not what's happening.

01:55:52.208 --> 01:56:05.125
So could you read what you're proposing the terms of the conditions would be from the department and then we'll see if the board wants to accept that or recommend any modifications or deny.

01:56:06.593 --> 01:56:07.593
I would be delighted to.

01:56:08.333 --> 01:56:09.894
Can I make one comment before I do that?

01:56:09.914 --> 01:56:10.154
Yes, please.

01:56:10.794 --> 01:56:30.559
I think that the way to look at the issue of monitoring both your comment and Member Rucker's comment is to pull the IEPs and look at what is written in the IEPs and to look at IEPs that go back more than one year, which we do through some of our monitoring processes to see if, in fact, it is a watch and consult kind of notion that they are exiting and making progress.

01:56:31.059 --> 01:56:33.461
or whether it is some other thing.

01:56:34.142 --> 01:56:43.248
But we can't really, I mean, without looking at the actual IEP note, many IEPs now are electronic and we can secure them without making a visit.

01:56:43.388 --> 01:56:49.193
So I just wanted to, that's what a monitoring might look like in that issue.

01:56:49.593 --> 01:56:53.176
So here's the wording that we kind of cobbled together.

01:56:54.116 --> 01:57:00.061
The district must report monthly to the Special Education Division of the California Department of Education

01:57:00.761 --> 01:57:12.949
on the caseload of each RSP teacher in the district and actions they are taking to secure additional staff to support RSP teachers who are at risk for exceeding the maximum caseload.

01:57:12.969 --> 01:57:17.972
And then in parentheses it says, those teachers who have reached the maximum caseload of 28 students.

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:21.914
Okay, any more board comments on this?

01:57:24.155 --> 01:57:25.416
Okay, do I have a motion?

01:57:25.436 --> 01:57:26.677
Do we have public comments?

01:57:31.468 --> 01:57:32.068
Do we have a motion?

01:57:37.489 --> 01:57:41.270
I move that we deny the CDE's recommendation to approve this waiver.

01:57:46.871 --> 01:57:52.312
Would you clarify, legal counsel, if we deny the waiver what does that mean?

01:57:55.152 --> 01:57:58.773
This is a retroactive waiver so they have exceeded the caseload.

01:58:00.282 --> 01:58:04.164
If you deny the waiver, I believe that means they get an audit finding, possibly?

01:58:04.824 --> 01:58:06.465
We would need to find them non-compliant.

01:58:07.125 --> 01:58:08.746
And then give them a corrective action.

01:58:10.307 --> 01:58:12.688
And the corrective action could be something very similar to this.

01:58:14.769 --> 01:58:18.571
So what's the impact for the district, just to clarify, Judy?

01:58:19.871 --> 01:58:21.612
Well, if the waiver's denied,

01:58:22.554 --> 01:58:31.323
and they've already committed to act, so it's likely that they'll get a finding from the Special Ed Division that they're out of compliance with the RSP Title V regulations.

01:58:31.983 --> 01:58:37.129
And what the Special Ed Division usually does in that instance is set the district up on a monitoring plan.

01:58:37.969 --> 01:58:40.852
Which is similar to what he's described with the monthly reports.

01:58:41.433 --> 01:58:42.834
Is there any financial consequences?

01:58:43.775 --> 01:58:44.556
Not that I'm aware of.

01:58:44.958 --> 01:58:54.401
And remember, denying a waiver, part of the reason why we would deny a waiver is we are saying it's not in the best interest of the students being served in the program.

01:58:54.941 --> 01:59:02.003
So I understand Member Sandoval's concern about denying the waiver, especially in the case of this LEA.

01:59:02.623 --> 01:59:18.540
because even if they have 17 RSP teachers, if they file 17 different waivers for each RSP teacher that they've exceeded the caseload for, that is a system of salutary neglect and not monitoring

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:25.225
the program supports and resources that should be provided to these teachers and to those students.

01:59:25.685 --> 01:59:43.099
And so what I'm hearing, and Member Sandoval don't let me put words in your mouth, is that there is a concern with this LEA, not with all of the RSP program waivers we've seen in general, there is a concern with this LEA that in continuing to ask for waivers, more than one,

01:59:43.619 --> 01:59:50.841
And in one case, a repeated waiver that they are not acting in the best interest of the students being served in this program.

01:59:51.221 --> 01:59:54.903
And that would be a reason for recommending that denial.

01:59:55.303 --> 01:59:58.904
The denial, whether we approve the waiver with the conditions

01:59:59.424 --> 02:00:08.567
or we deny it, the same outcome would occur because this LEA would be under an additional level of monitoring.

02:00:08.907 --> 02:00:14.329
An additional level of monitoring if we approve the waiver with the conditions the staff is recommending,

02:00:15.249 --> 02:00:16.449
or an audit finding.

02:00:17.169 --> 02:00:26.311
The more formal process of denying the waiver, putting an audit finding on them, and then increasing the monitoring and auditing that the department is doing.

02:00:26.671 --> 02:00:38.333
Either way, the LEA will be placed under an additional level of scrutiny to try to help them to correct what has clearly become a problem that they do not understand how to address.

02:00:43.214 --> 02:00:56.332
So okay, I understand that the outcome would be the same, but denying it sends a strong message that you're a repeated offender and we now are not okay with continuing to just give you waivers without a consequence, correct?

02:00:56.632 --> 02:00:59.476
So it's still the same outcome, but it's just the message that we're sending.

02:01:00.942 --> 02:01:01.162
Is that?

02:01:01.242 --> 02:01:02.223
I am seconding the motion.

02:01:02.243 --> 02:01:02.403
Okay.

02:01:02.463 --> 02:01:06.927
So now we have a motion and a second for denial of this waiver.

02:01:07.027 --> 02:01:09.749
Do we have any more any more board comments on the motion?

02:01:09.769 --> 02:01:13.272
Do we have any public comments on the motion?

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:14.033
No.

02:01:14.873 --> 02:01:15.274
Okay.

02:01:15.594 --> 02:01:19.357
All those in favor of the motion to deny this waiver?

02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:23.821
The motion passes.

02:01:25.287 --> 02:01:47.647
So I ask that if there are specific kinds of follow-ups that you would like as a board for us to do with this district other than what I've described here, could you convey them to us so that as we come back to address other waivers that we can update you on the things that have been done in this case?

02:01:48.001 --> 02:01:52.165
So I just go back to Member Sandoval who lays on the special ed as well.

02:01:53.026 --> 02:01:56.850
Is there anything beyond the conditions that you would like to ask the department?

02:01:57.271 --> 02:02:02.537
The one question that I have again is who is on watch and exit?

02:02:03.478 --> 02:02:05.420
I still haven't heard a number.

02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:07.902
They should know who their students are.

02:02:08.743 --> 02:02:11.886
We're in that status and the rsp teachers should know the same thing.

02:02:12.066 --> 02:02:15.570
Oh, yes, they should Agreed, okay.

02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:18.032
So, um, did you want to make a comment superintendent?

02:02:18.052 --> 02:02:20.014
Okay Okay.

02:02:20.775 --> 02:02:21.616
All right.

02:02:21.636 --> 02:02:27.522
So we are now on to waiver five This is from union elementary school district

02:02:28.015 --> 02:02:30.317
So this is the Union Elementary School District.

02:02:30.377 --> 02:02:33.659
They have a history of submitting waivers.

02:02:33.699 --> 02:02:42.966
They had one waiver in 14-15, three waivers in 15-16, and now we bring you two for 16-17.

02:02:43.907 --> 02:02:54.395
The district has requested in the past two at the same school, but with different teachers.

02:02:58.433 --> 02:02:59.654
Is this a rural district?

02:03:01.115 --> 02:03:05.059
I think it's San Jose.

02:03:09.406 --> 02:03:11.126
I'm not aware of any rural parts of the city.

02:03:11.146 --> 02:03:21.828
Okay, so any other, so I guess I would ask you, is there any other clarifying details that would help the board inform their discussion beyond just the specifics of the last three years of waivers?

02:03:21.888 --> 02:03:23.649
I think there's two things that should be noted.

02:03:24.389 --> 02:03:26.489
Member Sandoval asked a question about fifth graders.

02:03:26.989 --> 02:03:34.731
There's a thing about them indicating that in the future years that the caseloads would, on the natural, be reduced.

02:03:35.571 --> 02:03:40.093
because of fifth graders moving from those caseloads at the end of the school year.

02:03:42.154 --> 02:03:43.334
Pardon me, Member Rucker.

02:03:45.455 --> 02:03:46.576
Did you want to make a comment?

02:03:47.156 --> 02:03:47.736
Okay, go ahead.

02:03:47.816 --> 02:03:50.417
I'm not defending it, I'm just stating it.

02:03:51.458 --> 02:03:57.480
We did ask about the number of students who actually did matriculate and how those caseloads are looking now.

02:03:58.421 --> 02:04:03.183
After the matriculation, the caseload in one of the elementary schools went down to 20.

02:04:04.704 --> 02:04:07.226
and in the other it dropped to 24.

02:04:07.546 --> 02:04:09.768
So that's just information.

02:04:10.068 --> 02:04:11.930
That doesn't mean that it's the right thing to do.

02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:16.914
I don't want to be confused with that, but we did inquire about that.

02:04:16.934 --> 02:04:24.281
There was also an issue about the union opposing being contacted after the caseload is increased.

02:04:24.801 --> 02:04:35.110
They feel that as other local union representatives that they ought to be consulted before the caseloads are raised, not afterward, as you've indicated before.

02:04:35.590 --> 02:04:38.533
And the conditions that you've specified for this particular district?

02:04:39.254 --> 02:04:45.719
We actually, I think on this one, put the conditions for hiring and reporting to us.

02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.521
OK, Member Rucker.

02:04:48.317 --> 02:04:50.618
Okay, so I want to go back to this matriculating.

02:04:50.638 --> 02:04:55.860
There's a difference between students matriculating and students actually exiting the program.

02:04:56.241 --> 02:05:00.843
So if they are matriculating, that means they're going to somebody else's caseload.

02:05:01.243 --> 02:05:08.386
So they're solving their problem because the students are moving from their program to somebody else's program.

02:05:08.846 --> 02:05:14.348
they have an obligation to work with the program they're sending those students to as well.

02:05:14.448 --> 02:05:27.174
So all they're doing is solving their problem by transferring one problem from column A to column B. That doesn't really sound like really logical forward thinking or even responsible thinking.

02:05:27.634 --> 02:05:43.658
But then the second question is, unless fifth grade is the only grade they teach at that school, there are other students who are moving up through and matriculating through those grades who will probably come up through the fifth grade and may replace those students who are leaving.

02:05:43.698 --> 02:05:53.441
So they're still not thinking about what else their caseload looks like or who else could be matriculating into the program from their earlier grades.

02:05:55.141 --> 02:06:03.785
I find that it's kind of like what Member Lincoln said about moving the chairs around until she can sit next to Board Member Holliday.

02:06:04.045 --> 02:06:10.928
I have sat next to Board Member Holliday during board meetings, and it is a thrill that the rest of us should have an opportunity to have.

02:06:11.808 --> 02:06:24.773
So in this case, I don't think they're actually doing not only some prescriptive thinking but some preventive thinking about how to address the workload of their students that will remain.

02:06:25.213 --> 02:06:28.634
So I'm even surprised they put something like that in writing.

02:06:28.874 --> 02:06:29.134
Wow.

02:06:29.494 --> 02:06:30.114
Member Williams.

02:06:33.416 --> 02:06:36.997
Member Sandoval, is both waivers and special ed liaison?

02:06:38.837 --> 02:06:40.358
You're the waivers and you're special ed?

02:06:41.539 --> 02:06:46.304
Do you have a, what is your recommendation regarding this?

02:06:47.965 --> 02:06:50.328
I had one question, I was just waiting for the comments.

02:06:50.608 --> 02:06:51.248
Okay, go ahead.

02:06:51.469 --> 02:07:03.680
I just had a question about the discrepancy between the waiver application saying that the representative, the association representative had approved it.

02:07:04.401 --> 02:07:10.424
But no, I thought it was a denial because they were consulted after it was signed.

02:07:10.444 --> 02:07:18.568
So the paperwork that was submitted to the department says the union representative approved it.

02:07:19.608 --> 02:07:26.612
We have, as a matter of course, as a result of our interaction with y'all, made calls to everybody who's consulted there.

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:30.694
We learned that they didn't oppose the waiver,

02:07:32.375 --> 02:07:35.339
But they do not like the process that's being used.

02:07:35.359 --> 02:07:36.841
They oppose that process.

02:07:37.302 --> 02:07:46.294
They would like to be consulted, as you all have had discussion about previously, would like to have a process where they are consulted before the caseloads are raised.

02:07:48.897 --> 02:07:53.281
So members Sandoval, do you have any more comments or clarification?

02:07:55.203 --> 02:07:59.326
Okay, do we have any more board comments?

02:08:00.087 --> 02:08:01.348
Any public comments on this?

02:08:02.289 --> 02:08:02.989
Do we have a motion?

02:08:04.651 --> 02:08:06.072
Hold on, we have a public comment.

02:08:06.392 --> 02:08:07.974
Hi Jesse, come on forward.

02:08:14.063 --> 02:08:15.903
Jesse Aguilar with the California Teachers Association.

02:08:16.524 --> 02:08:19.184
The California Teachers Association opposes approval of this waiver.

02:08:19.844 --> 02:08:23.265
We do not believe that high class sizes or caseloads are good for kids.

02:08:23.505 --> 02:08:32.566
We believe that the individual attention that students need in order to be successful in school is sacrificed when class sizes or caseloads are increased.

02:08:33.367 --> 02:08:40.428
In this particular item, the local teachers association was not notified until after the teachers had been contacted and had agreed to the increase.

02:08:41.409 --> 02:08:44.151
strongly opposes this waiver and urges the State Board to deny.

02:08:44.431 --> 02:08:44.712
Thank you.

02:08:45.092 --> 02:08:45.452
Thank you.

02:08:47.995 --> 02:08:48.695
Any other comments?

02:08:50.617 --> 02:08:51.818
Do we have a motion?

02:08:56.222 --> 02:09:00.626
I move approval of the CDE's recommendation with the conditions.

02:09:01.707 --> 02:09:02.388
Do we have a second?

02:09:04.597 --> 02:09:05.078
I'll second.

02:09:06.179 --> 02:09:07.320
Any comments on the motion?

02:09:08.782 --> 02:09:11.805
All those in favor of approval with conditions on this waiver?

02:09:16.991 --> 02:09:22.777
Yes so we have one oh you're on okay it's approved it's approved okay thank you.

02:09:22.937 --> 02:09:23.237
Thank you.

02:09:24.238 --> 02:09:26.421
Okay so we are on now to waiver seven.

02:09:42.605 --> 02:09:43.286
Good morning.

02:09:43.386 --> 02:09:44.086
Good morning, Cindy.

02:09:44.787 --> 02:09:47.969
Vice President Strauss, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

02:09:47.989 --> 02:09:53.133
I am Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

02:09:53.173 --> 02:09:56.656
So this is a funding determination related waiver.

02:09:57.016 --> 02:10:05.522
I'll provide you a little bit of background on funding determination because the waiver kind of is a first part process.

02:10:05.542 --> 02:10:11.347
You'll see these three LEAs again because the funding determination is really what they're trying to get to.

02:10:11.867 --> 02:10:18.649
So the three districts in this case requested a waiver for the charter schools that are listed on the attachment one.

02:10:18.789 --> 02:10:22.509
Charter schools can't request a waiver on their own, so the districts did that on their behalf.

02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:31.611
And what the waiver would do would waive portions of the California Regulatory Code, so Title V of California Code of Regulations.

02:10:32.091 --> 02:10:38.373
And it's because these charter schools were delinquent in filing their funding determination requests, so that's what the waiver would do.

02:10:38.473 --> 02:10:39.253
It would allow them.

02:10:39.933 --> 02:10:44.016
to just start that process of filing the funding determination.

02:10:44.056 --> 02:10:49.739
It would allow the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools to hear the funding determination and make a recommendation.

02:10:49.860 --> 02:10:54.663
And then that funding determination would be brought back to the State Board for approval.

02:10:55.023 --> 02:10:57.404
So I'd like to note the waiver doesn't generate money.

02:10:57.624 --> 02:10:59.386
It doesn't do anything with apportionment.

02:10:59.466 --> 02:11:00.927
It's the funding determination.

02:11:01.747 --> 02:11:11.571
Yes, that will bring to you probably November, maybe January, depending on when they file the request and when the advisory commission can hear it.

02:11:11.751 --> 02:11:17.914
So these three would allow them to get a funding determination or request one for the year in question.

02:11:18.374 --> 02:11:31.307
For one of the schools, Yosemite Wawona Elementary Charter, they are actually asking for two years, but it's actually less than two years because they've requested August 18, 2014 through June 30, 2016.

02:11:32.628 --> 02:11:39.856
And then the other two schools, Vantage Point Charter and eCademy Charter at Crane are requesting a funding determination.

02:11:40.556 --> 02:11:43.238
for this year, so the waiver would be for the current year.

02:11:43.358 --> 02:11:52.585
And I know that doesn't sound like it's late, but the way the funding determination timelines work, the schools would have had to come in the year before.

02:11:52.806 --> 02:11:54.027
Yeah, it's just kind of different.

02:11:54.067 --> 02:12:00.792
So all three of them ended up filing late, so they're here before you, just to get their foot in the door.

02:12:01.432 --> 02:12:23.057
Now, if you don't approve the waiver, that means that their funding determination cannot be heard, so they would get zeroed out for their average daily attendance, that's what the funding determination does, for the year in question, which means they wouldn't get any LCFF money for that year, anything that's ADA-driven, lottery, state special ed funds, anything that's

02:12:23.917 --> 02:12:26.641
driven by attendance would be considered zeroed out.

02:12:26.762 --> 02:12:31.349
So that's the sort of the penalty for the schools by not getting the waiver.

02:12:33.131 --> 02:12:35.194
Do we have other, member Holiday?

02:12:38.042 --> 02:12:42.285
I will move to recommend the CDE's recommendation.

02:12:42.986 --> 02:12:50.331
These are very small schools and we do need to hear the funding determination, understand what their problems were.

02:12:50.592 --> 02:12:54.214
And so what this waiver does is allow us to hear it in November.

02:12:54.495 --> 02:12:57.517
So I would make that motion if there's no speaker.

02:12:58.456 --> 02:12:59.838
Okay, Member Williams.

02:13:00.819 --> 02:13:14.497
Well, I'll second the motion, but it also allows Member Holiday and I to hear it at ACCS where we can pre-hear it and ask more questions than there might be time for at the board meeting as well.

02:13:14.978 --> 02:13:15.458
Member Rucker.

02:13:16.059 --> 02:13:24.586
You know, a lot of times, especially with the timeline waivers for these funding determinations, it is about the relationship between the charter school and the LEA.

02:13:24.626 --> 02:13:27.968
That's the authorizer who has to file on behalf of the school.

02:13:28.008 --> 02:13:38.236
So I can understand on a year-to-year basis why the schools or the charters need to make the request for the waiver on the timeline.

02:13:38.636 --> 02:13:50.047
So for the two school sites that are making the request for the single year and it seems like they're not late, I understand why they are late because of the timeline when they should have made the request.

02:13:50.487 --> 02:13:57.093
But for the school site that's asking for the two full years, I don't understand how that happened.

02:13:57.418 --> 02:14:01.881
So this one, this is just the way the funding determination kind of works, the process.

02:14:01.921 --> 02:14:04.343
So the school's first year of operation was 2014-15.

02:14:04.403 --> 02:14:12.768
That's the year they need it, but the advisory commission can only grant a funding determination for a minimum of two years.

02:14:13.268 --> 02:14:16.531
So unfortunately, they have to ask for two years, but they don't need the second year.

02:14:16.591 --> 02:14:20.193
Right, so I asked that question on purpose so that that could be explained.

02:14:20.453 --> 02:14:21.574
Yes, I asked that question.

02:14:21.854 --> 02:14:33.623
So it didn't seem like we were bending over backwards to create an exceptional exception, but it's the circumstance not creating something different.

02:14:33.663 --> 02:14:36.665
So yeah, I asked the question for that reason.

02:14:36.706 --> 02:14:40.348
That's a little piece of the narrative that was not quite made plain.

02:14:40.749 --> 02:14:43.030
So are there any other board comments or clarifications?

02:14:43.851 --> 02:14:46.173
So any comments from public?

02:14:53.083 --> 02:14:55.324
Good morning, my name's Angela DeRamos.

02:14:55.364 --> 02:14:57.726
I'm here for the California Teachers Association.

02:14:58.426 --> 02:15:04.170
I'm also a classroom teacher and just listening to all the discussion over the last two days, this is a complicated process.

02:15:04.590 --> 02:15:07.071
I think of it a lot like rocket science.

02:15:07.752 --> 02:15:14.656
Well, in my classroom I think of it like herding cats, but for our purposes and launching a school especially, it is really complicated.

02:15:15.316 --> 02:15:21.680
And as rocket scientists and as me as the pilot, I'm relying on my administration and the people who are laying the groundwork

02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:27.564
to be on the launching pad, the ground crew, to get everything in order, ready to go.

02:15:27.584 --> 02:15:28.946
I need fuel.

02:15:29.386 --> 02:15:30.567
I need my conditions.

02:15:30.587 --> 02:15:36.151
I need my trajectory set on time in an orderly manner, or else we have a failure to launch.

02:15:36.832 --> 02:15:38.413
And what we have here is a failure to launch.

02:15:38.933 --> 02:15:40.915
And for that reason, we recommend to oppose.

02:15:43.150 --> 02:15:44.171
Oppose the waiver?

02:15:44.532 --> 02:15:44.772
Yeah.

02:15:45.933 --> 02:15:47.814
Because it's not on a timely manner.

02:15:48.695 --> 02:16:00.886
And we need, if the funding sources and all the requests need to be done, and they know it in advance, and we're expected to teach these children, then these things need to be done in a timely manner.

02:16:01.227 --> 02:16:02.448
And they had an adequate warning.

02:16:02.808 --> 02:16:07.412
Ignorance is not an excuse, especially in something as important as education.

02:16:08.073 --> 02:16:08.413
Thank you.

02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:18.162
Good morning, I'm Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

02:16:18.782 --> 02:16:23.865
I did want to just note that the issues in these waivers are regulatory issues.

02:16:23.925 --> 02:16:33.531
The timelines are very restrictive in the regulations, as well as the consequences of not meeting these timelines, which is essentially a zero funding for the entire school.

02:16:34.392 --> 02:16:42.317
They seem a little bit out of whack with the situation where schools may or may not miss a timeline for whatever reason.

02:16:42.357 --> 02:16:43.757
This is an administrative process.

02:16:45.399 --> 02:16:49.201
one that focuses on the educational program of the school or the charter itself.

02:16:50.342 --> 02:17:08.696
We have over the years strongly supported taking a crack at these regulations so that these issues don't even have to come before you because they are fairly simple and maybe creating some flexibility in the regulations around these timelines so that these situations aren't always in front of you.

02:17:09.616 --> 02:17:19.781
would probably save schools and the department and you a lot of time and effort and still meet the intent of this law, which is to monitor the funding of these schools in a reasonable way.

02:17:20.141 --> 02:17:31.306
But definitely support the opportunity to look at these regulations and look at ways that maybe they could be a little more streamlined and a little more effective.

02:17:32.086 --> 02:17:32.326
Thank you.

02:17:37.412 --> 02:17:38.533
Eric Remack, Charter Center.

02:17:38.693 --> 02:17:40.614
I'll say ditto to his remarks.

02:17:41.215 --> 02:17:48.260
None of these three are members of our organizations, but my understanding is two of the three are what you might call dependent district-run charters.

02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:59.888
And what we often find is that with the district-run charters, they've got so many other things going on that they tend to lose sight of this irregular process that occurs once every x many years.

02:18:00.649 --> 02:18:06.335
And the third one, I think, is a five-student school that serves primarily Park Service employees in Yosemite.

02:18:06.995 --> 02:18:11.300
And you can imagine what it would be like to be an administrator of a school with five kids in it.

02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:13.002
So thank you.

02:18:13.582 --> 02:18:13.923
Thank you.

02:18:14.643 --> 02:18:15.304
Member Holliday?

02:18:16.145 --> 02:18:17.767
So I move the CDE recommendation.

02:18:18.533 --> 02:18:19.133
Member Williams.

02:18:19.934 --> 02:18:20.254
Second.

02:18:21.334 --> 02:18:29.558
Just to clarify, if we approve this, Member Holiday, it will go to ACCS for full vetting of the approval.

02:18:30.378 --> 02:18:30.619
Okay.

02:18:30.959 --> 02:18:32.279
Do we have any comments on the motion?

02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:33.720
Okay.

02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:35.521
All those in favor of the motion to approve?

02:18:37.462 --> 02:18:38.482
Passes unanimously.

02:18:38.962 --> 02:18:39.343
Thank you.

02:18:40.343 --> 02:18:44.345
I believe that ends our waiver items and now we move to public hearing.

02:18:49.321 --> 02:18:50.963
So we are moving to item 12.

02:18:52.705 --> 02:18:55.348
Good morning, Larry Shirey, School Fiscal Services Division.

02:18:56.109 --> 02:19:03.437
This item involves a request to transfer two parcels from the Santa Clara Unified School District in Santa Clara County to the Cupertino

02:19:04.495 --> 02:19:09.779
Elementary and Fremont Union High School District and the County Committee's disapproval of that request.

02:19:10.859 --> 02:19:15.423
I think I want to start off by just describing the situation first.

02:19:15.963 --> 02:19:24.469
If you're following along on your laptops and the item, page two of the attachment one of the item has a map that looks like this.

02:19:25.149 --> 02:19:33.835
I don't have it on, but it's a page from the County Assessor's book that shows the glory at a circle.

02:19:34.535 --> 02:19:45.724
a little circle of 45 homes, and it shows the boundary between the districts that drops down and cuts two of those homes out of the Cupertino and Fremont school districts.

02:19:47.105 --> 02:19:53.290
If you go to the next two pages, you'll see a map from the County Office of Education and a map from the U.S.

02:19:53.390 --> 02:20:02.658
Census Bureau, which shows a different boundary and shows that these properties are in the Cupertino and Fremont school districts.

02:20:03.338 --> 02:20:10.064
What this means is that these two homes, for local educational purposes and for federal U.S.

02:20:10.104 --> 02:20:17.330
Census purposes, have been considered to be part of the Cupertino and Fremont School District for at least 40 years now.

02:20:18.651 --> 02:20:22.314
Kids who've lived in those homes have attended Cupertino and Fremont.

02:20:23.975 --> 02:20:26.417
And everybody thought that that's the district it belonged to.

02:20:26.457 --> 02:20:33.242
It wasn't until one of the homes went up for sale recently that they found that it wasn't in Cupertino and Fremont.

02:20:34.042 --> 02:20:46.191
So the owners of these properties petitioned the County Committee on School District Organization to transfer into the Cupertino and Fremont to formalize what's been going on for 40 years.

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:55.657
And their reasons were, this is a fairly discreet neighborhood, and we think we should be part of the neighborhood for all reasons.

02:20:55.837 --> 02:21:01.920
And you know, we've been doing, and we have been part for 40 years, so this is not something that we're really changing.

02:21:03.781 --> 02:21:14.567
The county superintendent, I should say that the Santa Clara Unified supports this, supported that transfer, but it was opposed by Fremont and Cupertino primarily because

02:21:15.202 --> 02:21:25.310
Both Cupertino and Fremont are high-achieving districts, and they have constant pressure from parents who live outside the district wanting their kids to attend schools in the district.

02:21:25.330 --> 02:21:30.995
So they see a lot of inter-district transfers and territory transfer requests, and they have for a long time.

02:21:31.755 --> 02:21:43.641
The County Superintendent, in his recommendation to the County Committee, agreed that the conditions that needed to be met for this transfer were substantially met and that found some compelling reasons to transfer the territory.

02:21:43.661 --> 02:21:50.304
We've already discussed those, the issue of the discrete neighborhood and the issue that's been going on for a long time.

02:21:51.444 --> 02:22:09.579
However, the county committee decided to disapprove it, and their reasons for disapproving it were, one, they didn't believe the two parcels were sufficiently geographically isolated from Santa Clara Unified, and they really couldn't come to any agreement about whether or not property values were affected by this transfer.

02:22:09.879 --> 02:22:11.620
It was a 4-4 vote.

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:17.425
As you know, when you're going, affluent school districts can have some effect on property values.

02:22:18.186 --> 02:22:27.048
We are agreeing with the county superintendent and we're asking you to reverse the county committee's action to disapprove the territory transfer.

02:22:28.048 --> 02:22:35.389
We're also saying, recommending that there's no reason to expand the election area from these two properties.

02:22:35.409 --> 02:22:41.650
The default election area would be just the two properties, but we don't see a reason why anybody else needs to vote on it.

02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:46.671
But if that's the case, if you take our two recommendations to reverse the county committee's action,

02:22:47.311 --> 02:22:50.873
to retain the two properties as the voting area.

02:22:51.234 --> 02:22:58.758
No election will be held because for election purposes, the property or the territory is considered uninhabited.

02:22:59.439 --> 02:23:15.068
So your taking of our recommendation, which is to reverse the County Committee action, keep the election area as the two properties in question, will result in the territory transfer being finalized.

02:23:16.755 --> 02:23:17.335
Member Williams.

02:23:19.376 --> 02:23:22.038
So there have been children in those homes?

02:23:22.658 --> 02:23:28.921
There, I think there's one child right now but there have over the last 40 years there have been children in those homes.

02:23:29.041 --> 02:23:32.082
That went to the Cupertino School District and Fremont?

02:23:32.382 --> 02:23:32.823
And Fremont.

02:23:33.383 --> 02:23:34.123
Graduated.

02:23:34.604 --> 02:23:43.708
But Fremont, I'm just asking for clarification here, Fremont and Cupertino both said that they wanted to deny allowing them to continue?

02:23:44.298 --> 02:23:45.719
They feel true.

02:23:45.999 --> 02:23:48.740
I mean, there's no one attending the districts right now.

02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:52.721
In the past, they have attended Cupertino and Fremont.

02:23:52.801 --> 02:23:58.764
Currently, there are no students in these two properties that attend Cupertino or Fremont.

02:23:58.824 --> 02:24:03.005
So where does the student in the one student that is in one of those homes go?

02:24:03.205 --> 02:24:06.287
I believe he is going to a private school right now.

02:24:06.647 --> 02:24:09.468
The parent is here if you want clarification of that.

02:24:10.245 --> 02:24:25.343
Okay, but for the last 40 years, whoever, if there were students there, they've gone to Cupertino and Fremont, but Cupertino and Fremont's reaction now is don't want to let them continue doing that because we have too many others that are always asking us to come in.

02:24:25.823 --> 02:24:26.063
Right.

02:24:26.343 --> 02:24:30.544
In the past, they thought that those territory, those homes were in their district.

02:24:31.105 --> 02:24:42.668
Now that they discovered that they actually aren't, they are concerned because of the past history of getting a lot of requests to transfer into the districts or inter-district transfers into the district.

02:24:42.988 --> 02:24:49.550
They think that approval of these properties would set a precedent for the county committee approving future requests.

02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:57.733
But just one more clarification, the kind of request they typically get is let my kid come in from out of district.

02:24:58.234 --> 02:25:02.115
It's not let my home be considered a part of the Cupertino district.

02:25:02.555 --> 02:25:03.796
That's what makes this different.

02:25:04.612 --> 02:25:04.832
Right.

02:25:04.932 --> 02:25:12.737
And the Cupertino District as a basic aid district, they have said that they would take the students from these homes on interdistrict transfer.

02:25:13.217 --> 02:25:16.039
Fremont Union High School District hasn't agreed to that.

02:25:16.660 --> 02:25:24.965
But for the most part, both Fremont and Cupertino, as do most basic aid districts, they pretty much turned down all interdistrict transfers.

02:25:25.065 --> 02:25:26.185
And it's just two homes?

02:25:26.606 --> 02:25:27.326
It's just two homes.

02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:28.760
Okay.

02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:29.600
Yeah.

02:25:30.041 --> 02:25:30.321
Okay.

02:25:30.681 --> 02:25:32.121
Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:25:33.562 --> 02:25:34.542
This was fascinating.

02:25:34.682 --> 02:25:36.643
Kind of took me back to my urban planning days.

02:25:37.123 --> 02:25:38.083
My masters I never used.

02:25:39.184 --> 02:25:48.067
But my question is, one, I don't think this realtor will ever be hired again in this community because he made such a discovery that created all this.

02:25:48.747 --> 02:25:52.549
If we were to reverse the decision, what can happen?

02:25:52.569 --> 02:25:54.069
Can they appeal?

02:25:55.029 --> 02:25:55.250
Is there?

02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:55.870
Were it?

02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.850
You're it.

02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:59.631
It will just be filed with the State Board of Equalization.

02:25:59.691 --> 02:26:03.312
Information will be sent back to the assessor's office and the registrar.

02:26:03.412 --> 02:26:04.032
It's a done deal.

02:26:04.672 --> 02:26:08.493
And the district's concern is that others will try to follow suit.

02:26:08.833 --> 02:26:21.896
But because this is a contiguous community with an identity and it meets some of the specs or some of the requirements, it would be really difficult for others to try to petition in a similar way, correct?

02:26:22.222 --> 02:26:25.105
Well, yeah, it's not difficult to petition.

02:26:25.666 --> 02:26:26.587
But to be approved.

02:26:26.787 --> 02:26:27.128
Right.

02:26:27.308 --> 02:26:31.893
And, you know, the county committee has just a little quick background.

02:26:32.294 --> 02:26:34.897
Santa Clara County Committee has probably dealt with

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:48.984
I don't even know what the county is, but over the past 20 years, this board has heard 24 appeals of its decisions regarding attempts to transfer into districts that are considered very affluent in Santa Clara County.

02:26:49.304 --> 02:26:53.946
Palo Alto, Cupertino, Los Altos, Saratoga, Los Gatos.

02:26:54.006 --> 02:26:56.126
Those districts get a lot of these requests.

02:26:56.426 --> 02:27:02.668
In fact, I've got three more for you next year of county, in those districts that you'll hear.

02:27:03.449 --> 02:27:04.649
County committee turning it down.

02:27:05.169 --> 02:27:08.050
So, our point is that the county committee's dealt with a lot of these.

02:27:08.651 --> 02:27:12.452
They turned down almost all of them and most of them get appealed up here.

02:27:12.833 --> 02:27:17.875
They do approve a handful for valid reasons like we think they should have done here.

02:27:20.096 --> 02:27:27.299
So, in terms of us supporting the idea that this would set a precedent, we disagree with that for two reasons.

02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:32.522
One is this is very narrow set of circumstances.

02:27:33.553 --> 02:27:35.815
that is not going to be a general precedent elsewhere.

02:27:36.356 --> 02:27:45.145
Also, the county committee in the past has not shown an inclination to use its prior approvals as a precedent to approve them.

02:27:45.265 --> 02:27:47.047
They disapprove most of the ones that come to them.

02:27:50.751 --> 02:28:10.149
All right, so I just want to be clear on understanding why the county committee for these two homes that have previously had students attending the school districts without an inter-district transfer, and they're the only two homes on Glorietta Circle that are not in the district,

02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:18.435
I'm lost on the rationale on why they said no, because this is important to me.

02:28:18.655 --> 02:28:26.201
And this board has a long history of supporting the local decisions of the local leadership.

02:28:26.242 --> 02:28:34.308
So it strikes me that the two school districts that would receive these homes are saying that they don't want it, but I'm confused.

02:28:34.966 --> 02:28:36.127
Yeah, that's partly my fault.

02:28:37.647 --> 02:28:47.472
I was at Santa Clara County Office of Education up until about 2000, so I was working with the Santa Clara County Committee on territory transfers and dealing with these issues.

02:28:48.213 --> 02:28:56.037
And, you know, we had a huge, huge concern, county committee as well as districts, about what we've just been talking about, this

02:28:58.007 --> 02:29:04.623
numerous, numerous requests to transfer territory into Los Gatos or Saratoga, Cupertino, Los Altos.

02:29:05.573 --> 02:29:11.755
And the county committee needed to come up with a way to handle those issues.

02:29:11.976 --> 02:29:21.179
So they did a whole area-wide study, and what they came up with is that, you know, the county committee has nine conditions that it has to look at.

02:29:21.199 --> 02:29:25.141
The condition in question here is a community identity question.

02:29:26.261 --> 02:29:33.144
There are a lot of factors that this board has established through regulation that the local folks need to look at when

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:37.928
uh, ruling on that county, that community identity issue.

02:29:38.348 --> 02:29:40.150
One of them is geographic isolation.

02:29:41.011 --> 02:29:54.045
So what we had worked out with the county committee 20 years ago is that, you know, it's very, very difficult for small territory transfers not to substantially meet all the, all the required legal conditions.

02:29:54.285 --> 02:29:54.986
They're going to be met.

02:29:56.167 --> 02:30:00.249
but it's not a rubber stamp to approve the territory transfer.

02:30:00.709 --> 02:30:04.691
The county committee has to find a reason to transfer the territory.

02:30:05.331 --> 02:30:17.977
We also, back 20 years ago, gave the county committee a reason not to approve territory transfers, which was, you know, if it's not sufficiently geographically isolated, then you can use that to deny a territory transfer.

02:30:18.497 --> 02:30:20.918
For whatever reason, the county, in my opinion,

02:30:21.578 --> 02:30:36.495
For whatever reason, over the 20 years, the county committee has morphed that geographic isolation into the community identity condition, which is a condition established by the legislature and as regulated by state board.

02:30:36.956 --> 02:30:41.942
So in our mind, in our opinion, they are misusing that condition.

02:30:42.512 --> 02:30:50.841
We called this out before, last year when we had a territory transfer, and we'll call it out again three times, I would imagine, next year when we have these appeals.

02:30:51.562 --> 02:31:00.992
So, the county committee's concern, fed by the district's concerns of establishing a precedent, not wanting anything to come into their district,

02:31:02.133 --> 02:31:07.396
They disapprove these things based primarily on this geographic isolation condition.

02:31:08.337 --> 02:31:21.605
And in this case, they also looked at property values and they split 4-4 on that because again, their concern and the district's concerns are if you transfer the territory into Fremont, Cupertino could increase the property values.

02:31:22.386 --> 02:31:29.691
And the condition is you can't, in code is that the territory transfer cannot primarily be for that reason.

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:34.043
In this case, we don't see how it can primarily be for that reason.

02:31:34.543 --> 02:31:39.486
They have been considered part of the Cupertino-Freemont School District for 40 years.

02:31:39.987 --> 02:31:42.308
Property values would have gone along with that line.

02:31:42.689 --> 02:31:48.873
The only thing that may occur now is that people find out that the properties aren't in the district, property values will drop.

02:31:49.353 --> 02:31:52.115
If you transfer, then it just comes back to what it's always been.

02:31:52.676 --> 02:31:59.641
So we don't see that as being even increasing property values, let alone transferring the property for that purpose.

02:32:01.322 --> 02:32:17.956
I actually appreciate the clarification because I read through the document and I you know the night before we started the board meeting on a Tuesday and I got up again and I read through this item even though it wasn't going to be on Thursday's agenda because I was just lost on

02:32:18.696 --> 02:32:22.559
how the County Commission went on a different path around this.

02:32:22.579 --> 02:32:26.062
So explaining that in the way you did is very helpful.

02:32:26.142 --> 02:32:34.068
And it brings back to mind when I was in elementary school, my friends and I used to sit around and discuss, how is it possible that it could rain on one side of the street?

02:32:34.468 --> 02:32:40.133
And this is a conversation about how is it possible for rain to happen on the other side of the fence?

02:32:40.593 --> 02:32:45.196
So I actually understand now how this actually occurred.

02:32:45.236 --> 02:32:51.841
And I do agree with the explanation you've given about where the fault or the gap is in their logic.

02:32:51.861 --> 02:32:54.283
So no, I actually do appreciate that.

02:32:54.323 --> 02:32:59.927
And if I could take myself back to being in fifth grade, I could now answer that philosophical question to my friend.

02:33:00.207 --> 02:33:01.328
Member Holliday, thank you.

02:33:02.024 --> 02:33:11.931
Yes, I am the liaison to this and If you did not see the letter that is in your box, please take a look at the letter Why don't you clarify said that so that people know I'm sorry.

02:33:12.572 --> 02:33:21.478
It's a no no just so the public Michael curse president and it comes from the secretary-designee to the Santa Clara County Committee and

02:33:22.339 --> 02:33:26.483
and reorganization.

02:33:26.743 --> 02:33:35.071
And they express lack of opposition to the CDE recommendation.

02:33:35.831 --> 02:33:44.279
So my recommendation though would be that we open the public hearing because we do have speakers for that.

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:46.581
And then we can continue the conversation after that.

02:33:47.222 --> 02:33:49.083
Okay, any more, Mr. Shirey?

02:33:49.524 --> 02:33:58.450
Okay, so now the public hearing is now open and we have, I believe, is it 10 minutes?

02:33:59.250 --> 02:34:04.093
For those in support of the CDE recommendation.

02:34:04.113 --> 02:34:10.398
Hi, I'm Charlie Peters and this is my neighbor.

02:34:10.418 --> 02:34:13.180
Hi, I'm Ranjit Monkekar.

02:34:15.361 --> 02:34:18.542
We appreciate the time that you're taking to consider our appeal.

02:34:20.342 --> 02:34:21.402
We're open to any questions.

02:34:23.423 --> 02:34:24.663
Did you want to make any other comments?

02:34:26.043 --> 02:34:30.865
In general, we support everything that's there in the document, and we're here if you had any more questions.

02:34:31.325 --> 02:34:32.445
We thought we'd come here in person.

02:34:32.525 --> 02:34:35.426
So you two are the homeowners of the two houses in question?

02:34:35.906 --> 02:34:36.486
Forty years.

02:34:37.026 --> 02:34:37.426
Three years.

02:34:37.946 --> 02:34:38.046
Okay.

02:34:38.506 --> 02:34:39.967
So you're the one that discovered it?

02:34:39.987 --> 02:34:41.187
The three-year one?

02:34:41.327 --> 02:34:41.547
Okay.

02:34:44.153 --> 02:34:47.096
And the 40 are your kids went to the school?

02:34:48.117 --> 02:34:51.079
Okay.

02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:56.524
I like the team shirt, so.

02:34:58.466 --> 02:35:06.273
I realize that I'm the most underdressed guy in this room, and I didn't wear slacks, so I'm sorry.

02:35:06.593 --> 02:35:08.415
Okay, member Linko, did you want to ask a question?

02:35:11.138 --> 02:35:11.878
Homeowners.

02:35:12.519 --> 02:35:17.322
The strange thing is, if you look at the map, it's not a circle.

02:35:17.342 --> 02:35:18.483
It's more of a horseshoe.

02:35:19.083 --> 02:35:21.045
And we're right at the end of the horseshoe.

02:35:22.105 --> 02:35:22.626
OK, that's all.

02:35:24.989 --> 02:35:27.711
But we appreciated you coming forward and clarifying.

02:35:27.731 --> 02:35:28.131
Is there any more?

02:35:28.551 --> 02:35:29.191
Member Williams?

02:35:29.411 --> 02:35:30.912
I just want to make a comment.

02:35:31.633 --> 02:35:38.276
My kids with I now live in San Diego, but I raised my children through the Cupertino School District and Limbrook High School.

02:35:38.356 --> 02:35:47.461
So as I look at the map and I think about the issue, I'm frankly just a little bit appalled that Cupertino and Fremont are recommending against it.

02:35:48.662 --> 02:35:52.544
You know, it doesn't make any sense on any level.

02:35:55.208 --> 02:35:57.710
Okay are there any more in support?

02:35:57.730 --> 02:36:02.034
All right and do you all have any more to say because you have 10 minutes so okay.

02:36:02.515 --> 02:36:09.080
All right then okay then I declare the no no now I have 10 minutes for the opposition.

02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:11.062
You two may sit down.

02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:15.266
Do we have anybody here to speak against this?

02:36:17.839 --> 02:36:18.719
I'm hearing none.

02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:21.160
I now close the public hearing.

02:36:21.781 --> 02:36:22.081
Okay.

02:36:22.821 --> 02:36:24.122
So now, Member Holliday.

02:36:24.142 --> 02:36:43.850
So once again, my sincere thanks to Larry and his team because in our conversations and in the liaison calls, it's so obvious and so clear that Larry has tremendous knowledge about these sorts of situations, tremendous years of experience, looks at all these things carefully, unbiasedly,

02:36:44.390 --> 02:36:47.351
Tries to understand and give us his best judgment.

02:36:47.431 --> 02:37:05.397
And in this case, I think he certainly has done that Also, we do not have a history of denying the local Decision we have a history of supporting the local decision in so many cases I think this was just a slip and and I think we need to just move beyond it.

02:37:05.437 --> 02:37:09.598
So I would move that the staff recommendation I would second

02:37:10.245 --> 02:37:13.867
Okay, do we have any other board comments on the motion?

02:37:14.607 --> 02:37:16.408
Do we have any public comments on the motion?

02:37:16.628 --> 02:37:16.828
No?

02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:20.270
Okay, all those in favor of supporting staff recommendation?

02:37:22.111 --> 02:37:23.151
Okay, passes.

02:37:23.592 --> 02:37:23.992
Thank you.

02:37:24.632 --> 02:37:25.813
Congratulations, gentlemen.

02:37:26.413 --> 02:37:27.133
Thank you for coming.

02:37:31.435 --> 02:37:36.218
Okay, we are on to item 13, and this is also going to be a hearing.

02:37:37.038 --> 02:37:38.739
Cindy Chan, please come forward.

02:37:41.314 --> 02:37:47.136
Hey, good morning again, Cindy Chan, Director of the Charter Schools Division at the California Department of Education.

02:37:47.816 --> 02:38:05.921
So International Studies Language Academy, which I will refer to as ISLA in my presentation, is a current state board of education authorized charter school and is requesting a material revision to its charter from opening in the current year, 2016-17, to delay it to open in the 2017-18 school year, so for one year.

02:38:10.422 --> 02:38:17.708
ESLA was scheduled to open by September 30th, 2016 in the Glendale Unified School District boundaries.

02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:25.655
However, due to difficulties it has had in securing facilities, ESLA is requesting to delay opening for one year.

02:38:25.675 --> 02:38:36.023
ESLA submitted its material revision request on June 15th, and the CD has reviewed the revised petition and all of the documents that were submitted.

02:38:37.225 --> 02:38:47.534
And the CD is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve with one condition and two technical amendments the request for material revision to the ESSA petition.

02:38:48.355 --> 02:38:58.204
The recommended condition is that ESSA must adhere to the terms and conditions as noted in attachment six of the item, State Board of Education standard conditions on opening and operation.

02:38:59.249 --> 02:39:13.328
So typically a material revision request would first go to the advisory commission on charter schools and they would hear the information and form a recommendation and then you would receive two recommendations, one from the CDE, one from the advisory commission.

02:39:13.949 --> 02:39:16.893
But the August ACCS meeting was canceled due to

02:39:17.293 --> 02:39:18.194
a lack of a quorum.

02:39:19.035 --> 02:39:25.080
And there is a September 30, 2016 due date or deadline that the school is facing.

02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:28.743
When they were approved in May, that was the condition.

02:39:28.783 --> 02:39:30.845
They had to open in the current year by that date.

02:39:31.205 --> 02:39:36.870
So we had to bring the mature vision request to this meeting in order to meet that deadline.

02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:39.532
And that's why there's no ACCS recommendation in this case.

02:39:40.453 --> 02:39:44.055
So give me a little bit of background about the charter school, just sort of refresh your memory.

02:39:44.075 --> 02:39:50.558
ESLA was originally denied by Glendale Unified School District and the Los Angeles County Board of Education on appeal.

02:39:51.278 --> 02:40:05.105
ESLA appealed to the state and was approved by the state board at its May 2016 meeting for a five-year term to serve up to 1,056 pupils by its fifth year in transitional kindergarten through grade eight.

02:40:06.085 --> 02:40:21.015
ESA will implement a dual immersion program for TK through grade five in four targeted languages, German, Spanish, Italian, and French, and an immersion and acquisition language program for grade six through grade eight, offering the four languages.

02:40:21.976 --> 02:40:32.883
If you recall, if you recall at that May meeting, there was some discussion, I think it was a little bit of confusion as to specifically what languages were going to be offered for each grade level serve.

02:40:32.923 --> 02:40:35.565
The petition wasn't that specific enough.

02:40:36.326 --> 02:40:46.885
So as part of the material revision, ESA revised that part of the petition to reflect its anticipated enrollment by grade level and what languages would be offered for each grade level.

02:40:48.362 --> 02:40:54.045
The CD finds that the ESA material revision petition meets the standards and criteria requirements.

02:40:54.145 --> 02:40:56.647
And I know I quote that a lot, that's from the statute.

02:40:56.687 --> 02:41:05.892
And what that means is that the same requirements that we use, which are very rigorous, that are used for an establishment of a new charter, which is an appeal that's usually here,

02:41:06.432 --> 02:41:09.554
Those same criteria and standards apply to a material revision.

02:41:09.594 --> 02:41:16.219
So we look at the petition, we look at a new budget, we look at all the supplementary documents that the school submits.

02:41:16.999 --> 02:41:23.744
And this also includes whether the petition provides a reasonably comprehensive description of the multiple required elements.

02:41:23.844 --> 02:41:28.427
In this case, we find that it does with the two technical amendments that we are proposing.

02:41:29.347 --> 02:41:35.592
Additionally, the financial plan submitted by ISLA was reviewed and appears to be sustainable and fiscally viable.

02:41:36.492 --> 02:41:48.017
So again, as a condition of ESLA's original approval, the charter school is required to open by September 30th of this month, unless the state board deletes or extends that deadline.

02:41:50.138 --> 02:41:53.639
Keep in mind, the delay in opening does not extend the charter term.

02:41:53.679 --> 02:41:55.660
So the charter was approved for five years.

02:41:56.660 --> 02:41:58.221
That remains intact.

02:41:58.281 --> 02:42:01.642
So they're only going to be able to operate through June 30th, 2021.

02:42:03.383 --> 02:42:09.570
The current year would serve as a planning year for this school, so that would just shorten the amount of years of operation from five to four.

02:42:10.911 --> 02:42:20.020
So as you begin your deliberation, I would emphasize that the action before you, as a reminder, is to approve or deny the material revision request.

02:42:20.701 --> 02:42:24.865
And that's primarily to allow the charter school to delay opening for one year.

02:42:25.626 --> 02:42:29.308
Your action today is not to approve or deny the charter school.

02:42:29.788 --> 02:42:31.529
That was already considered back in May.

02:42:32.189 --> 02:42:36.391
That was deliberated on and the result was that the school was approved.

02:42:36.631 --> 02:42:39.732
And so now that school is under the oversight of the state board.

02:42:40.413 --> 02:42:46.175
However, this is a little complicated because most material revisions don't have a result as this one.

02:42:46.836 --> 02:42:51.838
I would note that denial of the material revision request would effectively terminate the charter.

02:42:52.598 --> 02:42:58.421
as ESLA would be unable to open by September 30th and that was a condition of its original approval.

02:42:58.461 --> 02:43:03.643
So that is something to keep in mind as you're listening to the presentation and any questions you have.

02:43:04.383 --> 02:43:21.491
So to quickly summarize, the CD recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing and thereafter approve the request to revise the ESLA petition to extend opening for a year from the current year to 2017-18 with the CD's recommended condition and two proposed technical amendments.

02:43:22.391 --> 02:43:27.657
Representatives from ISLA and the Glendale Unified School District I believe are here to address the board.

02:43:28.518 --> 02:43:29.700
Okay, thank you Cindy.

02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.465
Do we have any liaison comments or should we before we go to the public hearing?

02:43:35.124 --> 02:43:50.234
Just quickly, Member Holliday and I both agreed and felt comfortable with having this charter come with this material amendment now, even though it was unable to go to the ACCS because the ACCS was on vacation.

02:43:50.994 --> 02:43:51.835
We couldn't get a quorum.

02:43:52.275 --> 02:43:59.840
So we feel comfortable with it coming now and with what we think needs to happen with it.

02:44:00.717 --> 02:44:06.505
So our technical assistance, sir, this is this is from our earlier item.

02:44:06.586 --> 02:44:11.252
So do you want to prepare it so that we can see the correct presentation?

02:44:13.335 --> 02:44:13.716
That's right.

02:44:33.666 --> 02:44:34.006
Thank you.

02:44:34.848 --> 02:44:39.433
So we'll now declare the public hearing open and the petitioners have 10 minutes.

02:44:40.615 --> 02:44:41.316
So welcome back.

02:44:45.796 --> 02:44:46.257
Good morning.

02:44:46.277 --> 02:44:48.759
Hello, everyone, members of the Board.

02:44:48.959 --> 02:44:53.404
I'm very excited to see Superintendent Torkelson here.

02:44:53.464 --> 02:44:54.706
Is that better?

02:44:56.347 --> 02:44:57.408
Because it's a treat for me.

02:44:58.329 --> 02:44:59.471
So I'm Gillian Bonacci.

02:44:59.491 --> 02:45:01.413
I'm one of the co-lead petitioners for ISLA.

02:45:01.853 --> 02:45:05.697
And if you recall, we were here in May and we received our authorization.

02:45:09.021 --> 02:45:25.474
What has happened in the meantime is that we have secured a facility in Glendale and we're requesting this material revision because in the analysis of the property we determined that we won't have enough time to build it out properly for a September opening.

02:45:26.634 --> 02:45:34.361
That is the only change that is in this material revision except for the CDE required technical amendments and conditions from May.

02:45:34.441 --> 02:45:36.802
So this is the only thing.

02:45:37.803 --> 02:45:48.189
So we did secure the facility this summer and we came to realize in June that the city of Glendale was going to require a CUP for that particular location.

02:45:49.410 --> 02:45:54.533
We intend to file a CUP request as soon as we get the decision from this body.

02:45:55.313 --> 02:45:59.936
We understand that the process could take four to six months, which includes the appellate time frame if needed.

02:46:00.896 --> 02:46:06.018
We've retained a land use attorney, an expediter in Glendale to assist us with the process.

02:46:06.058 --> 02:46:13.560
So we believe that the CUP process would take us to about February if it goes to full length, February of 2017.

02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:25.203
So concurrently with filing the CUP, we would, our architects, they've already done an initial review of the property and the surrounding area and they haven't discovered any obvious

02:46:25.983 --> 02:46:32.730
you know, underground gas tanks or things that would prevent a school from being located in that area.

02:46:33.831 --> 02:46:42.120
We'll begin our phase one environmental study and as soon as, you know, as soon as we file the COP, we'll start working on our plan.

02:46:43.381 --> 02:46:49.026
The architects will work closely with the city planning department to identify and rectify any possible issues along the way.

02:46:49.046 --> 02:46:56.493
And we've already identified traffic and noise engineers to do the traffic and noise studies for that area.

02:46:58.454 --> 02:47:08.663
Also, while we're gonna be going through the CUP process, we will start with the mechanical drawings and the process of working with the city planner and the architects will be happening concurrently.

02:47:09.444 --> 02:47:18.251
So, as soon as the CUP is granted, which we would hope will be February of 2017 or sooner, then we will begin our tenant improvements.

02:47:19.092 --> 02:47:24.416
The architects estimate the build-out timeframe to be three to four months, and that would get us to June 2017.

02:47:25.197 --> 02:47:26.918
So, we feel very comfortable with the timeline.

02:47:28.019 --> 02:47:31.160
added padding for an appellate timeframe.

02:47:33.782 --> 02:47:44.326
Our architects have given us very initial approval of, they think the building looks good, it's a fairly new building, so they don't feel like there's any large structural things that would have to happen.

02:47:45.807 --> 02:47:49.949
We feel like this is a very positive path that we're following.

02:47:51.649 --> 02:48:02.613
In the meantime, as soon as we get the answer from this board, we will restart our recruiting and our outreach efforts that we had paused back in June.

02:48:03.593 --> 02:48:13.937
We will contact all of this year's applicants to gauge their interest for next year, although, frankly, they've been contacting us, so we know that a good number of them are still interested.

02:48:15.017 --> 02:48:26.142
We intend to use Facebook marketing, some door-to-door advertisements, which now that we have the facility, we have the neighborhood, that was something that had held us up previously.

02:48:27.183 --> 02:48:39.749
Outreach to preschools, churches, language academies, the YMCA, cultural institutions, consulates, various engaged parents like to have house parties, invite their friends to get the word out.

02:48:40.709 --> 02:48:42.431
farmers markets, street fairs, you name it.

02:48:42.691 --> 02:48:48.415
A lot of these things were not available to us back in May because of the lateness of our authorization.

02:48:48.495 --> 02:48:49.956
So now we have a full year.

02:48:50.596 --> 02:48:54.999
And we have a lot of very activated parents, very motivated.

02:48:55.039 --> 02:48:59.802
They really want to come to work and help us bring in students.

02:49:00.603 --> 02:49:06.767
We've kept our job postings up on EdJoin and we've continued to receive new applicants for teachers and for a principal.

02:49:07.687 --> 02:49:09.849
So we'll continue through that vein as well.

02:49:10.950 --> 02:49:19.595
Our contingency is that we will continue to search Glendale for alternative properties just in case something should be discovered that would make this property unsuitable for us.

02:49:20.636 --> 02:49:27.220
And then we will file Prop 39 requests just because of the timing, because it's due at the end of October.

02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:29.581
But we'll do that concurrent with the CUP process.

02:49:32.203 --> 02:49:35.065
Do you have any more as part of your presentation?

02:49:37.583 --> 02:49:41.127
Okay, do we want to ask questions now?

02:49:41.147 --> 02:49:50.458
We want to wait for the, okay, maybe we'll have, we'll wait for, okay, so now we'll have all those, but I think I have to close this part, right?

02:49:50.658 --> 02:49:54.823
No, okay, so, okay, opposition for the material revision.

02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:08.762
Good morning State Board of Education, Superintendent Torlakson and staff.

02:50:09.403 --> 02:50:14.106
My name is Wilfred Robertson and I am the proud superintendent of the Glendale Unified School District.

02:50:15.187 --> 02:50:33.796
I'm here because this issue and matter is very serious to us, a matter of capacity and our analysis that we would like to raise before the State Board of Education to truly interrogate the capacity of the charter to serve students.

02:50:33.916 --> 02:50:35.037
I'm here as a steward

02:50:35.977 --> 02:50:40.481
of the well-being of students and their success, just as the State Board of Education is.

02:50:41.161 --> 02:50:50.368
And there are serious concerns about the ability of this charter to serve students as described.

02:50:51.589 --> 02:50:54.471
I am not an opponent of charters.

02:50:54.651 --> 02:50:57.954
In fact, while in Davis, we opened one, a very successful one.

02:50:57.994 --> 02:51:01.316
And I know the State Board is about supporting successful charters.

02:51:01.717 --> 02:51:02.517
This is not one.

02:51:04.298 --> 02:51:07.720
and because there are serious capacity issues.

02:51:09.321 --> 02:51:14.443
As we described, when our team came before you, we stated that this would happen.

02:51:15.144 --> 02:51:21.107
And so, the revision is back here because the capacity to open was not there on the facility.

02:51:21.997 --> 02:51:28.562
I know Glendale very well and I know the real estate and the property as described is currently a Korean market.

02:51:29.302 --> 02:51:33.085
And I do know that that lease is not open up until June of 2017.

02:51:35.707 --> 02:51:36.467
Hear what I'm saying?

02:51:36.727 --> 02:51:38.208
Could you clarify what you just said?

02:51:38.329 --> 02:51:40.670
It's currently a Korean market.

02:51:41.371 --> 02:51:42.812
It is currently a Korean market.

02:51:43.112 --> 02:51:51.678
There will be serious revisions to make that property habitable to serve students in an environment that is conducive for learning.

02:51:52.822 --> 02:52:00.627
Other capacity issues that we're concerned about is the fact that this is a dual language program.

02:52:00.827 --> 02:52:17.217
And when a program fails, if a charter fails, and this one has all the implications of not being able to succeed because of fiscal, as well as the description of students, the number of students that they anticipate

02:52:17.617 --> 02:52:27.642
being able to serve and to start a dual language immersion program with four languages over six grade spans is ludicrous.

02:52:27.662 --> 02:52:40.568
I hate to use such a strong term, but pedagogically, if you look at what Glendale has done in serving students with dual languages, we really have the model on this.

02:52:42.169 --> 02:52:44.130
And we know what it took for us to open.

02:52:44.952 --> 02:52:48.766
We didn't open with that many languages, with that many grade levels.

02:52:50.495 --> 02:52:53.397
And we have the fiscal capacity to do it.

02:52:54.137 --> 02:52:55.038
We had teachers.

02:52:55.478 --> 02:52:57.700
It is tough to recruit teachers for this.

02:52:58.100 --> 02:52:59.020
We deal with that.

02:52:59.641 --> 02:53:00.541
And we pay better.

02:53:02.763 --> 02:53:05.164
So we have serious concerns about this.

02:53:05.364 --> 02:53:09.047
I look at this, and this is about the students that we are stewards over.

02:53:09.167 --> 02:53:10.848
It is not about anti-charter.

02:53:11.248 --> 02:53:14.350
It is about how do we best serve students.

02:53:17.095 --> 02:53:23.721
It is, as doctors take the Hippocratic oath, stating that they would do no harm.

02:53:24.201 --> 02:53:30.888
When students in the dual language program are not able to continue

02:53:31.880 --> 02:53:36.823
they lose different from students that are in an English-only program.

02:53:37.243 --> 02:53:47.108
That's why I'm asking that the State Board of Education truly interrogate your staff as well as this particular charter revision.

02:53:47.749 --> 02:53:58.815
Because if it fails, it is not students coming back to our public schools from an English-only program, but the language loss and the malpractice

02:54:00.385 --> 02:54:02.246
is going to show up even greater.

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:07.747
So now, as we stated, we knew that this was going to happen.

02:54:07.907 --> 02:54:12.209
We have concerns about the ability to secure the property.

02:54:12.269 --> 02:54:19.431
We've done our homework and research and know what it will take to take a permit through the city of Glendale.

02:54:19.791 --> 02:54:21.611
And it's more like four or five months.

02:54:21.651 --> 02:54:23.472
But the property is currently being used.

02:54:24.192 --> 02:54:46.589
So if the State Board of Education approves this material revision, we expect that the ISLA will be back at this podium many times this year asking for additional revisions when they realize they cannot enroll their stated number of students, when they realize they can't find a viable location in Glendale, and when they realize that it is not feasible to open a charter

02:54:47.896 --> 02:54:54.661
with dual language grades K through five, not this many number of grades.

02:54:55.161 --> 02:55:06.689
So I'm asking that the State Board of Education seriously interrogate this charter and its capacity to serve the students that we have swore to serve.

02:55:07.370 --> 02:55:07.650
Thank you.

02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:18.095
Hi, I'm Cheryl Plotkin, and I am interim chief business officer and financial officer for Glendale.

02:55:18.656 --> 02:55:23.997
And I was asked on coming in to look at the budget that was put together for ISLA.

02:55:24.978 --> 02:55:26.378
And this is my credentials.

02:55:26.458 --> 02:55:30.599
I am a CPA, I'm a former auditor, and I've been 13 years as CBO.

02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:35.441
I looked at it and said, if this were a school district, you would never approve it.

02:55:35.761 --> 02:55:38.902
And the thing I was looking at most was their cash flow statement.

02:55:39.682 --> 02:55:43.485
First, I analyzed their revenues, which I said are overstated.

02:55:44.006 --> 02:55:47.689
First of all, they're saying they're going to have 55% free and reduced lunch.

02:55:48.289 --> 02:55:50.231
They modeled themselves after Franklin.

02:55:50.591 --> 02:55:54.835
Franklin only has 35% unduplicated students.

02:55:55.095 --> 02:55:58.077
They only have 20% free and reduced lunch.

02:55:58.998 --> 02:56:04.723
This is not a type of school that is going to get 55% unduplicated students.

02:56:05.483 --> 02:56:06.684
Without that, they lose $560,000.

02:56:09.264 --> 02:56:12.687
They also would not have Title I. That is another $97,000.

02:56:12.807 --> 02:56:18.191
In their budget, they put lottery, which they wouldn't receive for another year.

02:56:18.211 --> 02:56:22.855
That's another $76,000 that comes out of the revenue they're showing on their budget.

02:56:24.916 --> 02:56:28.459
In their budget, they're saying they're going to have 438 students.

02:56:28.479 --> 02:56:29.600
However, in a public meeting they held,

02:56:32.301 --> 02:56:38.246
They already are talking about going down to the 328, which is the allowable 20 percent.

02:56:38.646 --> 02:56:41.088
So they are already looking at getting less students.

02:56:41.949 --> 02:56:44.791
I don't know what that would cost them in the way of money.

02:56:45.111 --> 02:56:48.093
Obviously, they would lose LCFF money.

02:56:48.574 --> 02:56:51.516
But they might have offsetting teachers' reductions.

02:56:51.936 --> 02:56:53.798
But if you are offering four languages,

02:56:54.278 --> 02:57:03.984
and all those classes, you would either have to reduce the number of grades you're serving or the number of languages you're serving in order to go to less students.

02:57:07.449 --> 02:57:08.770
I looked at their cash flow.

02:57:09.130 --> 02:57:12.471
In their narrative, they said that they would only need to borrow $650,000.

02:57:12.511 --> 02:57:19.254
But if you just look at their cash flow statement, they say they have to borrow $766,000 in the first year, $697,000 in the second year.

02:57:25.896 --> 02:57:28.198
and $409,000 in the third year.

02:57:28.638 --> 02:57:40.466
But if you add the revenue that is overstated and very hopeful, it's almost $1.5 million that this school would have to borrow in order to function for a year.

02:57:42.007 --> 02:57:53.395
This is a school with no track record, limited banking by a company that isn't even in California except for, I think, one other charter, no assets, no collateral,

02:57:54.779 --> 02:57:57.561
And I don't see where they're ever going to get the line of credit.

02:57:58.182 --> 02:58:07.729
I would say to you that if you want to have a technical correction to this, and that is they would have to show you where their line of credit is coming from before they can open this charter.

02:58:08.470 --> 02:58:17.277
Also, to let you know that that piece of property they're talking about still shows as being for lease if you go on the website for the broker.

02:58:20.520 --> 02:58:20.800
Thank you.

02:58:24.972 --> 02:58:25.813
Okay.

02:58:25.833 --> 02:58:30.356
If no more I will close the public hearing and now open it up for board discussion.

02:58:30.796 --> 02:58:31.316
Member Rucker.

02:58:32.497 --> 02:58:34.658
Okay, liaisons first.

02:58:34.678 --> 02:58:35.439
Do you mind if I?

02:58:35.459 --> 02:58:37.160
Okay.

02:58:38.941 --> 02:58:44.425
I think what Cindy indicated to us early on is a very important point for us to remember.

02:58:44.465 --> 02:58:46.046
This is not double jeopardy.

02:58:46.966 --> 02:58:50.227
We're not trying somebody a second time.

02:58:50.847 --> 02:59:03.469
We have already approved this charter, but we are now looking at this material revision, not the value of the charter, not that as a whole, but this change in terms of the delay in opening.

02:59:04.230 --> 02:59:08.331
However, when we do that, it does change things about the petition.

02:59:08.431 --> 02:59:09.731
It changes the budget.

02:59:09.791 --> 02:59:10.331
It changes

02:59:11.031 --> 02:59:17.500
A number of people that changes, you know, any number of things can be changed by a delay in opening material revision.

02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:21.445
So those are things that we really should look at and be very careful about.

02:59:24.657 --> 02:59:44.426
not the original discussion we had in May about this charter school, and if we can keep those things separate I think we will be doing what we're asked to do for this one, so I just wanted to say that again, remind people of that again, and leave it up to you of course now for other comments.

02:59:44.466 --> 02:59:47.187
Do you Member Williams as the other liaison want to make a comment on this?

02:59:49.185 --> 03:00:00.909
I would just add to that in terms of it wasn't a surprise to me either that they would need probably to have a material amendment related to facilities.

03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:09.912
Whenever a charter petition denial process happens and takes a long time and they wind up to us in May,

03:00:11.052 --> 03:00:22.601
then it's not uncommon for them not to have been able to secure a facility until they had for certain authorization and then it takes a while to make that happen.

03:00:22.641 --> 03:00:33.068
This isn't the first one that we've had where we have, where this has been brought to us for the sole reason of facilities and needing to get the facility in place.

03:00:34.149 --> 03:00:34.529
Thank you.

03:00:36.090 --> 03:00:36.651
Member Rucker?

03:00:38.892 --> 03:00:39.393
Member Rucker?

03:00:40.208 --> 03:00:41.689
And Ting, did you have your hand up?

03:00:41.789 --> 03:00:42.010
Okay.

03:00:43.071 --> 03:00:44.512
Okay, so I agree.

03:00:45.313 --> 03:00:57.363
Again, I'm always happy to serve in the company of some really smart people on this board because Board Member Holliday said part of what I wanted to speak to and he actually said it better than I did.

03:00:57.783 --> 03:01:03.568
This is not a hearing to re-litigate the board's decision to approve this charter.

03:01:04.329 --> 03:01:20.392
But it is a hearing to consider what is the sustained effect of extending the opening date on this charter because of the problems that they did have with securing a facility and then doing the work to open the facility.

03:01:20.412 --> 03:01:27.834
So the board member, Holiday, did bring up some questions I did have concerning other parts of the charter petition itself.

03:01:28.837 --> 03:01:31.619
that have an impact on this delayed opening.

03:01:32.099 --> 03:01:41.205
And so I'm going to try to be very careful asking these questions because I do not want to relitigate the issues concerning the charter.

03:01:42.026 --> 03:01:56.696
I am concerned that the budget may be different because there are some cost considerations that were not anticipated by the charter operators because they now have to wait this additional year.

03:01:57.256 --> 03:02:10.347
you know, the cost for doing whatever the refab is or whatever it is they have to do to get the building ready and get their certificate and get their permit and do all the work that they have to do.

03:02:11.347 --> 03:02:16.251
Their budget didn't include the work with an attorney to go through all of these things.

03:02:16.331 --> 03:02:20.795
And is that going to have a material impact on what their revenue looks like?

03:02:21.215 --> 03:02:28.078
So that wasn't considered or addressed or identified by the charter.

03:02:28.118 --> 03:02:30.699
So I have a concern about that impact.

03:02:31.079 --> 03:02:36.141
I have a concern because of where the neighborhood is, whether or not they will be able to meet

03:02:36.681 --> 03:02:45.508
their anticipated student enrollment because of where the facility is and if that's going to change the type of students who end up being enrolled there.

03:02:45.528 --> 03:02:58.358
And as a result, if they have a budget that anticipates a particular number of students who are part of that unduplicated population, is there really going to be this issue that the district identified?

03:02:58.738 --> 03:03:01.040
But now that's not relitigating whether or not

03:03:01.420 --> 03:03:03.902
They have a viable program or a viable budget.

03:03:04.302 --> 03:03:12.527
I think that there are some things that probably have not been considered or contemplated that's going to have a different impact on this charter.

03:03:13.168 --> 03:03:15.569
That said, I was confused.

03:03:15.810 --> 03:03:18.291
I'm not surprised that they haven't signed a lease.

03:03:18.351 --> 03:03:26.657
So yeah, I'm sure if we do go on the website and we look at that building, we will see that it's still being listed as for lease.

03:03:26.937 --> 03:03:30.960
They probably haven't signed a lease yet because they can't obligate themselves

03:03:31.480 --> 03:03:39.864
to a building that they haven't been approved to lease or you know to make that financial obligation if this is not going to be approved.

03:03:40.264 --> 03:03:47.308
So that part doesn't bother me but I am concerned that even giving them the additional planning year

03:03:47.788 --> 03:03:59.660
There may be some other unintended revenue issues that are not in front of us that are probably going to be of concern that are going to create another problem for them at some point down the road.

03:04:00.341 --> 03:04:05.627
I am impressed that they have taken the time to look at what the timeline will be for working with the city

03:04:06.227 --> 03:04:08.048
and for doing the work with their architects.

03:04:08.148 --> 03:04:16.033
But there are some other cost pressures in that work that wasn't anticipated and I don't believe that have been considered.

03:04:16.493 --> 03:04:23.177
So approving this may create more problems than it actually solves.

03:04:23.637 --> 03:04:31.822
But that is a concern that wasn't addressed by either the district or it wasn't properly addressed or identified by the district.

03:04:31.842 --> 03:04:34.183
The district has the, they had the,

03:04:34.683 --> 03:04:48.935
presence of mind to identify that there are some issues with their budget and with their finances, but it's on the charter operators to figure those things out and to explain to us how those were addressed, how are they going to address them, and that they recognize those issues.

03:04:48.995 --> 03:04:49.936
They didn't do that.

03:04:51.077 --> 03:05:03.125
I don't know if they didn't do that because it is something they are not aware of, or they don't know right now what those issues will be, but I do think that there are going to be some concerns that are currently not anticipated.

03:05:03.665 --> 03:05:09.930
Again, I am trying to very carefully raise those concerns because I do not want to relitigate

03:05:10.350 --> 03:05:25.760
the quality or the efficacy of the charter application, I just, I think that we do need to be aware there are some other cost pressures that will, that right now are unanticipated by what this delay will actually mean.

03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:34.766
And I'm hoping, I see Board Member Ting's son shaking her head yes, so I'm hoping I'm not missing the target on explaining what my concern is.

03:05:35.306 --> 03:05:42.408
Cindy, could you come back up and address from the department perspective the comments about these financial issues?

03:05:42.428 --> 03:05:43.369
Would you clarify?

03:05:46.690 --> 03:05:58.213
We start with the budget that's submitted with the material revision and some of the issues that the district pointed out, what we do is we look at their budget and then we make our own adjustments to that.

03:05:58.293 --> 03:06:01.074
So we look at their assumptions but then

03:06:05.725 --> 03:06:09.408
Did they submit a different budget from the one that we saw in May?

03:06:10.028 --> 03:06:10.829
I just want to clarify.

03:06:10.849 --> 03:06:11.889
Because everything shifts.

03:06:12.049 --> 03:06:13.971
This is a different budget.

03:06:14.071 --> 03:06:14.291
All right.

03:06:14.791 --> 03:06:15.231
Thank you.

03:06:15.371 --> 03:06:20.815
And then our adjustments actually, I mean, they understated LCFF revenues, so that actually increased.

03:06:21.375 --> 03:06:22.476
their revenues.

03:06:22.556 --> 03:06:24.516
And then we removed some things.

03:06:24.616 --> 03:06:27.918
We reduced lottery because of timing, some of the things the district said.

03:06:27.938 --> 03:06:41.384
We increased expenditures because they may have provided assumptions, but we are a little more conservative sometimes in what we look at based on historical budgets we've looked at for state board schools, and so we've made those adjustments.

03:06:42.464 --> 03:06:58.561
The facility is a little unknown because at the time there was really, there's no lease agreement, so it's really difficult to know what that would cost, but they have built lease costs within the budget, but it is year one, which means it begins in 2017-18, but they had made a statement that they anticipated

03:07:03.346 --> 03:07:08.991
that the potential landlord would include all tenant improvement and related costs into the price of the lease.

03:07:09.091 --> 03:07:14.595
So at that point, the first year lease costs look like it could be reasonable without any sort of agreement.

03:07:15.015 --> 03:07:18.638
The first year costs, though, those are the ones we had, there were no assumptions for that.

03:07:18.698 --> 03:07:26.845
So anything in the planning phase that hasn't been built in to the budget, there is some wiggle room for them, but I don't know what those costs would be.

03:07:28.240 --> 03:07:30.944
Okay, Member Ortiz-Lacombe, and then Member Sang after that.

03:07:32.886 --> 03:07:41.077
When I was reviewing this item, the charter wasn't ringing a bell, and that's because I think I missed all, like a day marathon of charters on May 12th.

03:07:41.197 --> 03:07:41.858
I left that day.

03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:55.268
Yeah, and so one of the things that I think is standard across all charter schools, it's so difficult to find a facility in most of these build-out communities, and this is going to be a recurring theme that we see.

03:07:56.829 --> 03:08:02.813
You know, going through the process of working with the city and trying to get the conditional use permits, also a nightmare.

03:08:03.233 --> 03:08:05.035
So I am very sympathetic to that.

03:08:05.895 --> 03:08:12.299
When I was looking at the new languages that have been identified, and again, I don't have background because I wasn't here,

03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:25.545
It does seem aggressive to teach four different languages within that grade span identified, to find teachers that are qualified to teach those four different languages.

03:08:25.845 --> 03:08:39.051
I've had the privilege of traveling to different schools across the country that offer more than one language, and it is extremely difficult to find the teachers, to find the parents that are willing to enroll their kids in some of the

03:08:40.271 --> 03:08:42.893
languages like German and French.

03:08:43.874 --> 03:08:50.618
So that for me, I understand the district's concern because if something should happen to the charter, God willing, nothing will.

03:08:51.058 --> 03:08:57.543
But if something should happen, then you do have students that may come back to the district with some language gaps.

03:08:58.223 --> 03:09:06.009
However, again, I wasn't here during the initial hearing, so I wasn't previewed to the entire conversation.

03:09:06.530 --> 03:09:17.539
And for that reason, I'm just going to sit back and just express that I understand the concerns around the facilities and I do wish you luck in finding your new site and making sure that you secure it.

03:09:17.850 --> 03:09:24.274
And remember, we had a very lengthy hearing and testimony, and we debated those very issues and discussed them.

03:09:24.314 --> 03:09:26.915
So just so you know, they did come out during the hearing as well.

03:09:27.336 --> 03:09:32.999
And there were some clarifying steps and strategies that were shared by the petitioners at the time.

03:09:34.180 --> 03:09:34.780
OK, Member Sun.

03:09:35.367 --> 03:09:35.747
Thank you.

03:09:35.907 --> 03:09:45.910
So I was nodding to Member Rucker's comments because absolutely with the delay that there would be some additional and unanticipated costs, et cetera.

03:09:47.190 --> 03:09:54.652
However, on the other hand, I feel that by having this delay, it also provides the school more time to recruit.

03:09:55.232 --> 03:10:00.014
I remember in that discussion that because of the wide variety of languages that

03:10:01.034 --> 03:10:15.190
school wanted to provide in this dual immersion model that we were a little bit not sure if all of those languages would have had the classes and the numbers that they needed.

03:10:16.111 --> 03:10:21.514
It could in some ways help balance out by having that additional time in that.

03:10:21.574 --> 03:10:33.341
And I don't know if the petitioners want to address that or if the department has already looked at some of those factors, but I don't think that's necessarily all bad as far as impact eventually on the program.

03:10:34.970 --> 03:10:36.733
going to go to public comment.

03:10:37.173 --> 03:10:38.054
I think it's a good thing.

03:10:38.755 --> 03:10:44.303
I think charter schools do need a lot of time to get ready before the door opens and the child walks in.

03:10:44.323 --> 03:10:51.473
I have seen any number of charters who have tried to rush that process and it has not turned out to be in the best interest of the children.

03:10:51.853 --> 03:11:07.096
So I'm really happy about delaying the opening of the starter school as a means for allowing the staff and the teachers and the parents and the kids and the building to get ready for next September or August and opening the door for the kids.

03:11:07.316 --> 03:11:08.056
I think it's a good thing.

03:11:08.436 --> 03:11:12.657
Okay so we're gonna go to public comment now and then we'll come back for any other board comments.

03:11:13.277 --> 03:11:17.678
So this time we have any public comment on this request?

03:11:21.829 --> 03:11:23.193
So your microphone's not on?

03:11:25.299 --> 03:11:25.901
Okay, go ahead.

03:11:47.692 --> 03:11:52.541
So do we have it specified one minute per comment?

03:11:53.703 --> 03:11:53.923
Okay.

03:11:54.664 --> 03:11:55.526
Mr. Aguilar, go ahead.

03:11:56.252 --> 03:11:58.574
Jesse Aguilar with the California Teachers Association.

03:11:59.395 --> 03:12:01.376
This charter is not very far along in the process.

03:12:01.856 --> 03:12:07.961
We believe that more due diligence should have been exercised and the charter should have been further along in the process before asking for the specific date.

03:12:08.561 --> 03:12:10.703
The process should not be used as a placeholder.

03:12:11.243 --> 03:12:16.628
If a school is going to build parent expectations on when it will open, there should be a concerted effort to open on that date.

03:12:16.988 --> 03:12:20.771
Therefore, CTA opposes the material revision and urges the state board to disapprove.

03:12:20.951 --> 03:12:21.191
Thank you.

03:12:26.138 --> 03:12:30.680
Good afternoon, Dr. Armina Garperian, President of the Glenelg Unified School District Board of Education.

03:12:31.380 --> 03:12:36.463
We are here today to ask you to deny Isla Charter School's request for material revision.

03:12:36.663 --> 03:12:39.724
GUSC has a long history of supporting parent choice programs.

03:12:40.304 --> 03:12:46.187
However, we do not believe that the Isla offers a quality program that will benefit our students.

03:12:46.687 --> 03:12:49.149
Numerous material concerns led both GUSD and L.A.

03:12:49.189 --> 03:12:51.731
County to deny ISLA's original charter petition.

03:12:52.331 --> 03:12:58.295
The fact that ISLA is already requesting a material revision to their charter further proves that these concerns were valid.

03:12:59.055 --> 03:13:03.619
GUSD operates one of the largest, strongest dual immersion programs in the state of California.

03:13:03.859 --> 03:13:09.963
Our program has been recognized by LACO, CABE, and California's Together, and is being recognized this October by the L.A.

03:13:10.003 --> 03:13:11.164
County Board of Supervisors.

03:13:11.844 --> 03:13:23.590
We understand what it takes to operate a high-quality dual immersion program, and we are confident when we say that the program ISLA is proposing does not have the capacity to be successful.

03:13:24.310 --> 03:13:27.412
ISLA has already had a delay opening their school for one year.

03:13:27.672 --> 03:13:33.555
We do not believe that they have a plan that can be put into action without many more significant material changes.

03:13:33.675 --> 03:13:33.995
Thank you.

03:13:40.002 --> 03:13:40.963
My name is Jennifer Freeman.

03:13:40.983 --> 03:13:51.486
I'm also a member of the Glendale Unified School District School Board and I am a parent of three children enrolled in Franklin's dual immersion program and actually now one at the middle school level at Roosevelt Middle School.

03:13:52.106 --> 03:13:57.688
One of ISLA's contentions was that we are not offering K-12 pathways for dual immersion in the district.

03:13:58.109 --> 03:14:04.651
We have currently three middle schools that are offering the program and one high school that is moving into the program, so this frankly is just not true.

03:14:05.611 --> 03:14:09.374
The enrollment issue is not one we, again, we offer schools of choice.

03:14:09.514 --> 03:14:11.155
We have been responsive to our community.

03:14:11.696 --> 03:14:16.900
We are doing it well, and I think doing it better than, frankly, ESLA is going to be available to.

03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:19.842
So I am asking that you deny the request for material revision.

03:14:20.362 --> 03:14:23.703
I'm confident that there is not strong enough interest in our Glendale community.

03:14:23.883 --> 03:14:29.966
We do not have a community that desires this charter and we want to really see it go away because it does not meet our community needs.

03:14:30.186 --> 03:14:32.627
It is not something that we believe is going to work for children.

03:14:33.167 --> 03:14:38.449
We're here in the best interest of our kids and we want to see them do well and not have to pick up the pieces from a failed charter.

03:14:38.649 --> 03:14:38.929
Thank you.

03:14:45.031 --> 03:14:47.072
This is my sixth year as principal of Franklin.

03:14:47.153 --> 03:14:48.153
Could you introduce your name, please?

03:14:48.173 --> 03:14:48.534
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:14:48.574 --> 03:14:49.354
I'm Vicky Atikian.

03:14:50.995 --> 03:14:52.476
This is my sixth year as principal of Franklin.

03:14:52.516 --> 03:14:57.160
Prior to being principal, I was an administrator at the district office providing support for dual language programs.

03:14:57.540 --> 03:15:01.603
I have firsthand knowledge of what it takes to create and maintain successful dual language programs.

03:15:02.283 --> 03:15:09.325
It takes extensive knowledge and experience in language acquisition, hiring qualified teachers, development of curriculum and assessments, and effective professional development.

03:15:09.825 --> 03:15:14.667
These lead job posting for the principal does not reference experience with dual immersion programs or methodologies.

03:15:15.007 --> 03:15:18.868
It requires only one year of any administrative experience and none at the elementary level.

03:15:19.508 --> 03:15:21.449
Also, the principal position does not start until May 2017.

03:15:21.509 --> 03:15:27.731
This is too late for teacher recruitment and hiring, for student recruitment, and for the purchase of instructional materials.

03:15:28.311 --> 03:15:38.959
The ESLIP petitioners do not seem to have the qualifications and understanding necessary to open and sustain an educationally sound dual immersion program across levels and languages, especially within this short timeline.

03:15:39.399 --> 03:15:39.740
Thank you.

03:15:43.643 --> 03:15:48.166
I'm Tali Narsanyan, the president of the Glendale Teachers Association, representing the phenomenal teachers of Glendale.

03:15:48.646 --> 03:15:50.548
I'd like to yield my time to Donald Cohen, please.

03:15:54.275 --> 03:15:54.756
Good afternoon.

03:15:54.776 --> 03:16:01.347
I am Alicia Harris, teacher at Crescent Valley High School in Glendale Unified and the vice president of the Glendale Teachers Association.

03:16:01.728 --> 03:16:03.491
I too yield my time to Donald Cohen.

03:16:05.514 --> 03:16:05.895
That's me.

03:16:07.702 --> 03:16:09.883
I'm Donald Kahn, the Executive Director of In the Public Interest.

03:16:09.923 --> 03:16:12.043
We're a nonprofit research and policy group.

03:16:12.444 --> 03:16:20.646
So I want to talk a little bit about, and I'm handing out a memo, about the process a little bit about this, because we have a little bit of a different view on material revisions and the issue there.

03:16:20.686 --> 03:16:26.388
So we look back at the approvals, the applications that came to the State Board since 2002.

03:16:26.888 --> 03:16:32.250
And I'm going to give you my conclusions, and I'm going to go through the numbers, and then hopefully I'll do that within a couple of minutes.

03:16:32.910 --> 03:16:36.071
So first, we found that we believe the State Board is approving

03:16:38.452 --> 03:16:46.694
a good number, maybe a too good a number, of local charter petitions that have been rejected by school districts in which they are going to operate.

03:16:46.834 --> 03:16:48.935
That raises issues of local control and capacity.

03:16:49.755 --> 03:16:55.656
Second, a significant number of the charter schools approved by the State Board have either been closed or not yet open.

03:16:56.337 --> 03:16:57.277
I'll give you the numbers in a bit.

03:16:57.957 --> 03:17:08.727
Third, the Board is considering a large number of material revisions that suggest potential issues that could and should have been addressed in the original proposal.

03:17:08.868 --> 03:17:18.757
Fourth, we think this indicates the potential for the need for a review of staffing capacity, not that staff is doing a bad job, but staff's capacity and the adequacy of staff to

03:17:20.219 --> 03:17:25.506
to evaluate, to monitor schools and evaluate and monitor on the ground.

03:17:26.767 --> 03:17:27.809
So let me give you a few numbers.

03:17:28.370 --> 03:17:36.441
So since 2002, the state board has approved 74% of all charter petitions that have been appealed to the board following the rejections.

03:17:37.541 --> 03:17:38.141
That's first.

03:17:39.662 --> 03:17:49.365
Second is of those 43 that the State Board has approved on appeal, 15 of those were subsequently closed or have not yet opened.

03:17:49.425 --> 03:17:50.485
That's a substantial number.

03:17:52.326 --> 03:18:01.349
Next, we found that 20 of the 43 schools that were approved have had come back for material revisions, some more than once.

03:18:02.049 --> 03:18:07.992
And again, within those, two have had their charters revoked, three never opened, and two are pending and not yet opened.

03:18:08.552 --> 03:18:17.157
So in general, we think the process of regular material revisions speaks to the rigor of the process from the get-go.

03:18:17.637 --> 03:18:23.400
This creates distortions, it creates disruptions for the local community and for kids that you've heard about.

03:18:23.760 --> 03:18:29.783
So in general, I think there are actions you can take to look at the process in more depth within state statute.

03:18:30.464 --> 03:18:45.163
In specific, I think given the concern about occupancy and when the Korean market will leave occupancy, the question is whether this will be another material revision in the first of many.

03:18:45.624 --> 03:18:45.864
Thank you.

03:18:52.265 --> 03:18:53.126
Almost good afternoon.

03:18:53.746 --> 03:18:59.070
I'm Kelly King assistant superintendent for educational services for Glendale Unified School District.

03:18:59.651 --> 03:19:05.015
Over 3000 of our students are enrolled in one of Glendale's dual immersion programs TK through 12.

03:19:05.916 --> 03:19:11.800
And we know well and research supports that it's critical for students to remain in that dual immersion program through sixth grade.

03:19:12.761 --> 03:19:21.888
CABE two way CABE and those are the letters I presented with you have grave concerns about ISLA and the dual immersion program it's proposing.

03:19:23.369 --> 03:19:26.631
The delay continues to fuel those concerns.

03:19:27.271 --> 03:19:33.175
There's very little instruction in those early years in English as it depends on those five years before language skills transfer.

03:19:33.936 --> 03:19:51.428
I've given you a letter from Dr. Catherine Lindholm Leary that also supports the concerns that if this fails and if continued material revisions continues to delay or it opens without being fully realized that there's detriment to the kids.

03:19:52.228 --> 03:20:00.900
We're asking that you deny the East Slip request for material revision and ask them to submit a more reasonable and reasoned petition for approval at the local level.

03:20:01.380 --> 03:20:03.263
Our kids deserve a high quality program.

03:20:03.463 --> 03:20:03.803
Thank you.

03:20:07.040 --> 03:20:12.646
Cheryl Plotkin, I just want to clean up on a couple of items from what we found out.

03:20:12.966 --> 03:20:18.912
One is we've been told by the grocery store that they are not moving out until June, in which they're moving to a new facility.

03:20:19.632 --> 03:20:26.159
And two, one of the things they relied on to come up with the number of students they were going to have was our waiting list.

03:20:26.539 --> 03:20:34.868
Where our waiting list for Franklin is 21 students from Glendale and 153 from outside the district.

03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:42.036
Our concern about this is not the Glendale students, but it is our concern for all students in general.

03:20:46.320 --> 03:20:48.081
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

03:20:48.241 --> 03:20:55.803
We're very concerned about this process of requiring schools to come up for material revisions for a delay.

03:20:56.783 --> 03:21:01.425
The start date of a school is not an item within the scope of a charter.

03:21:01.925 --> 03:21:03.625
You guys have been requiring that.

03:21:03.946 --> 03:21:05.146
It goes beyond the law.

03:21:05.786 --> 03:21:09.387
And worse yet, it creates an enormous practical barrier.

03:21:09.887 --> 03:21:12.047
Good commercial properties come on the market.

03:21:12.387 --> 03:21:15.128
They're often snapped up within hours, if not days.

03:21:15.628 --> 03:21:24.389
Requiring a school to go through a months-long process to get a material revision takes them out of the marketplace when they need to be in, and it's just crippling.

03:21:24.749 --> 03:21:29.990
In our view, this requirement is an abusive helicopter authorizer practice.

03:21:30.050 --> 03:21:34.671
You have plenty of other tools to deal with the practical issues of making sure the facility

03:21:35.191 --> 03:21:39.233
is safe and sound, but you need to stop doing this, please.

03:21:39.253 --> 03:21:47.178
I have no problem with approving this revision for today, but going forward, I would urge you to rethink this requirement.

03:21:47.258 --> 03:21:47.598
Thank you.

03:21:52.881 --> 03:21:55.803
Good afternoon, Colin Miller with the California Charter Schools Association.

03:21:58.144 --> 03:22:05.714
I want to note that I do agree with Eric on his comments that this really does go beyond a material vision of the charter itself.

03:22:05.774 --> 03:22:07.877
We're not here to talk about the educational program.

03:22:08.177 --> 03:22:12.183
We're not here talking about how the program or governance or operation of the school will be structured.

03:22:12.583 --> 03:22:18.747
The budget and the facilities issues are in statute very separate from the charter itself.

03:22:18.807 --> 03:22:21.928
And so this really doesn't constitute a material revision to that charter.

03:22:22.289 --> 03:22:28.072
So we would encourage you to look at more administrative processes so that these things can happen on a more timely basis.

03:22:28.092 --> 03:22:33.335
So the school isn't delayed, in this case, at least two months from actually even being able to move forward on this issue.

03:22:34.176 --> 03:22:37.278
We do strongly support the school in this issue.

03:22:37.899 --> 03:22:43.844
We do know, of course, that as time goes by, budgets and assumptions do change.

03:22:44.385 --> 03:22:48.989
Budgets are dynamic documents, and they will always be changing, even in the best of circumstances.

03:22:49.469 --> 03:22:58.678
We do believe the school has at least acknowledged many of these assumptions and many of the contingencies that may be necessary in this case, and they're very capable to move forward.

03:22:58.778 --> 03:22:59.038
Thank you.

03:23:00.996 --> 03:23:03.098
So that ends the public comments.

03:23:03.138 --> 03:23:04.939
So do we have continued board comments?

03:23:07.681 --> 03:23:08.662
Member Littleton was gone.

03:23:11.144 --> 03:23:14.506
I'm not going to be specific about this charter since I wasn't here.

03:23:14.586 --> 03:23:20.691
But in general, this is the second time that I hear there were being helicopter stay aboard of it.

03:23:20.871 --> 03:23:24.374
Is that what would you respond to that, Judy?

03:23:25.964 --> 03:23:28.205
I think the testimony itself is the best response.

03:23:28.246 --> 03:23:29.126
We heard from the school.

03:23:29.186 --> 03:23:30.087
We heard from the district.

03:23:30.547 --> 03:23:38.312
We heard from Cindy about all of the changes that are resulting from this delay in opening the budget, employee contracts, recruitment.

03:23:38.733 --> 03:23:47.799
I think from a parent's perspective who thought they would have a school to attend this year and now they don't, I think it's hard to say that that's not a material change.

03:23:48.819 --> 03:23:53.602
And we've heard of the domino effect, employee contracts, all of the other things that are affected because of this.

03:23:54.383 --> 03:23:55.704
I think the testimony itself sort of

03:23:56.124 --> 03:23:57.625
proved why it was a material change.

03:23:58.825 --> 03:23:59.526
Member Holiday.

03:24:00.786 --> 03:24:06.810
So I'm really sorry that there's so much animosity toward the charter school in the local district.

03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:10.491
I don't ever like to have a divisive situation.

03:24:10.511 --> 03:24:14.353
I'm sorry that it is this way in this case.

03:24:14.513 --> 03:24:16.795
I hope that it will improve over time.

03:24:17.595 --> 03:24:25.099
I also believe that all of us on the board were a bit concerned in May about

03:24:26.966 --> 03:24:34.329
The short amount of time ISIL had to pull everything together, I feel more comfortable now that they're taking more time to do this.

03:24:34.889 --> 03:24:38.830
I trust the CDE and their evaluation of the financial situation.

03:24:39.230 --> 03:24:40.851
I hope recruiting will come along well.

03:24:41.271 --> 03:24:47.854
I hope that the ties to the community will be mended, and I hope the Korean market works out.

03:24:48.674 --> 03:24:52.316
Lots of hope, and I understand that that's an issue, that's a concern.

03:24:53.877 --> 03:24:57.999
but I would go ahead and move the CDE recommendation.

03:24:58.019 --> 03:25:01.281
I'll second.

03:25:01.301 --> 03:25:01.521
Okay.

03:25:01.541 --> 03:25:04.063
Do you have any board member comments on the motion?

03:25:06.024 --> 03:25:15.550
I should probably know this, but on the opening date, do we require that petitions to the state board is actually put in the petition itself?

03:25:16.291 --> 03:25:19.673
Or is that a... Yes.

03:25:19.813 --> 03:25:20.033
Cindy?

03:25:23.146 --> 03:25:24.646
It's not in the petition itself?

03:25:26.607 --> 03:25:32.948
Could you come forward, Cindy, so we can hear?

03:25:32.968 --> 03:25:39.870
The opening date isn't added to the charter petition, but there's this separate attachment on the item that's in every item that comes before you.

03:25:41.991 --> 03:25:43.391
The parent's sign has the date.

03:25:44.611 --> 03:25:45.472
Oh, you mean originally?

03:25:46.232 --> 03:25:46.672
Yeah, maybe.

03:25:49.524 --> 03:25:59.429
I don't want to hold up the vote, but I think the comments around the material revision, a material revision should be a material revision of the charter itself.

03:25:59.849 --> 03:26:05.872
So if we're not asking them to put the opening date in the charter, is it technically a material revision?

03:26:05.892 --> 03:26:07.693
Isn't it no later than September 30th of 2017?

03:26:07.853 --> 03:26:10.094
Isn't that what we're doing?

03:26:10.114 --> 03:26:11.175
We're just moving it one year.

03:26:12.676 --> 03:26:13.196
Member Williams?

03:26:15.186 --> 03:26:22.472
I believe that what Member Sun is raising is the same thing that were raised by Eric and Colin.

03:26:24.053 --> 03:26:36.943
Is it, who do not feel like the date that a charter school opens, if that changes, that requires coming back to the board for a material revision?

03:26:37.764 --> 03:26:50.747
and that's what was being raised by them and I think that Member Sun is raising that as well in terms of if is it in the charter itself and that's why we're requiring it and it should it be in the charter or is it more of an administrative thing.

03:26:51.587 --> 03:26:51.827
Right.

03:26:51.907 --> 03:27:00.638
And again, I'm not going to hold up the vote on this, but it is something that I think technically looking at, I believe we need to know when the charter is going to open.

03:27:00.718 --> 03:27:02.821
And that is definitely a part of the process.

03:27:03.461 --> 03:27:08.828
Mine is more on the technical aspect of what is considered material revision of the charter, which is the process.

03:27:08.868 --> 03:27:16.955
So it isn't in the petition, but remember, the material revisions by law are required to follow the same standards and criteria that I always state.

03:27:17.315 --> 03:27:24.781
Those standards and criteria is everything you look at in an initial approval of a charter that includes the budget, includes every document that we have to look at.

03:27:24.821 --> 03:27:30.867
So it kind of puts that back into that same sort of place that we would on an establishment.

03:27:31.187 --> 03:27:34.510
So we treat it the same other than we don't look at signatures.

03:27:34.570 --> 03:27:37.132
There's a couple things we don't look at because they're not applicable.

03:27:38.378 --> 03:27:41.780
I'm happy to continue some conversations with liaisons on this.

03:27:41.920 --> 03:27:42.621
Member Rucker.

03:27:42.701 --> 03:27:44.542
It's not the issue before.

03:27:45.242 --> 03:27:55.728
So when the board took action to approve this charter, the idea was that the school was going to open in this school year.

03:27:56.730 --> 03:28:00.131
And so it's not going to be open this school year.

03:28:00.471 --> 03:28:07.234
Now, I don't think that they would, okay, Cindy, I'm saying this on purpose to be illustrative.

03:28:07.774 --> 03:28:12.116
So originally the charter intended to open on September 30th.

03:28:14.304 --> 03:28:19.749
They were going to end up having to open on October 1st instead of September 30th.

03:28:20.169 --> 03:28:29.297
I somehow don't think that truly meets the definition of a seriously material revision in their charter.

03:28:29.757 --> 03:28:34.262
But this charter, when it was approved, was supposed to open this school year.

03:28:34.783 --> 03:28:47.217
The fact that they are not going to be able to open this school year and will open in a successive school year is something that this board, as the authorizer, should know.

03:28:48.077 --> 03:28:52.661
How is this board, as the authorizer, supposed to know that?

03:28:52.821 --> 03:28:53.961
That's the first question.

03:28:54.462 --> 03:29:04.549
And then the second question is what is the impact on the charter itself in making that kind of significant delay in opening?

03:29:04.609 --> 03:29:13.515
So what Cindy has explained is because of that significant delay in opening, not a day or two or a week or two,

03:29:15.489 --> 03:29:29.094
the department in exercising their due diligence has to review if there are other fiscal or program issues that will be impacted in what the charter submitted in changing this delay.

03:29:29.715 --> 03:29:32.876
So that's not a helicopter process.

03:29:33.256 --> 03:29:40.559
That really is exercising the due diligence of this board in choosing to approve this charter.

03:29:41.079 --> 03:29:46.950
So that's the reason why when I began my initial comment, I said I do not want to re-litigate.

03:29:48.246 --> 03:30:00.856
the issues that were raised about the charter itself, the staff made the point that there are very few substantive impacts by allowing this charter the one-year delay.

03:30:00.997 --> 03:30:11.846
So relitigating some of those things, while it's important to all the stakeholders that came, and I agree with and I have concerns about all the comments they raised,

03:30:12.426 --> 03:30:22.562
The comment I had was, I'm not sure that all of the issues, and there are some assumptions, as Cindy pointed out, that we currently don't know.

03:30:23.103 --> 03:30:27.670
And because of those assumptions that we currently don't know, I feel uninformed.

03:30:28.211 --> 03:30:43.622
But my feeling of being uninformed about those assumptions has nothing to do with my reservations that the district has raised or even my own personal concerns that were raised by other stakeholders who testified at the hearing when this was approved by the board.

03:30:44.162 --> 03:30:48.044
It's solely looking at and understanding what is the substantive impact.

03:30:48.444 --> 03:30:53.586
So I'm not sensitive to the criticism of being a helicopter board in this regard.

03:30:53.606 --> 03:31:00.990
I mean, we're either a helicopter board or we're just so charter friendly we'll approve, you know, a charter school that gets convened on a popsicle stick.

03:31:01.750 --> 03:31:04.631
It depends on which side of the charter concern you are.

03:31:04.651 --> 03:31:11.615
We're either a very great charter-friendly board, or we're so antagonistic that we hyper-litigate everything.

03:31:11.675 --> 03:31:14.496
So it just depends on which side of the continuum you are.

03:31:14.536 --> 03:31:15.997
So I'm not sensitive to that.

03:31:16.597 --> 03:31:24.581
I think that the staff has done a good job of trying to explain what assumptions they are aware of, what things they are not aware of.

03:31:25.081 --> 03:31:38.788
And so based on what they have explained, then it's up to this board to decide, do you have enough information to decide it's worthwhile to approve this extension, given the fact that the staff has already told you there are some things they don't know?

03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:40.230
Thank you, Member Rucker.

03:31:40.290 --> 03:31:41.050
Member Holiday?

03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:51.357
This continues to happen with all of the charter school issues that come before this board, whether it's funding determination or whether it's appeals or whether it's renewals.

03:31:51.717 --> 03:32:00.183
The fact is that in each of these cases, we get sidetracked with a larger discussion about

03:32:02.345 --> 03:32:04.668
definitions and about process and all the rest.

03:32:05.068 --> 03:32:13.978
So I would certainly welcome the opportunity to talk with staff and others about this issue about material revision moving forward.

03:32:14.019 --> 03:32:16.161
But on the table today, right now, it's

03:32:17.122 --> 03:32:23.413
this question and so once again I move the CDE recommendation and I and we've got a second.

03:32:23.673 --> 03:32:30.625
So okay all those in support the CDE recommendation let's take a vote.

03:32:36.178 --> 03:32:36.498
Six.

03:32:37.479 --> 03:32:37.779
Six.

03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:38.960
I'm not voting.

03:32:39.500 --> 03:32:39.801
Six.

03:32:40.421 --> 03:32:41.302
Motion passes.

03:32:42.062 --> 03:32:42.362
No wait.

03:32:43.743 --> 03:32:44.964
You abstain and.

03:32:45.524 --> 03:32:46.585
I'm abstaining also.

03:32:48.246 --> 03:32:48.947
Two abstentions.

03:32:48.987 --> 03:32:51.208
So we have six yes and two abstention.

03:32:51.528 --> 03:32:52.649
So the motion passes.

03:32:53.850 --> 03:32:54.130
OK.

03:32:55.151 --> 03:32:55.471
Thank you.

03:32:56.031 --> 03:32:57.853
So that ends our public hearings.

03:33:01.095 --> 03:33:03.817
And now we're open to general public comments.

03:33:03.857 --> 03:33:04.297
Do we have any?

03:33:07.995 --> 03:33:11.621
Lorraine Richards, Jesse Aguilar, and Angela DeRosa.

03:33:17.331 --> 03:33:20.116
Would those that have signed up for public comment please come forward.

03:33:31.236 --> 03:33:31.897
Good afternoon.

03:33:31.957 --> 03:33:40.866
The individual that I'm introducing, I'm waiting to come in from the other overflow room, but my name is Lorraine Richards, California Teacher Association.

03:33:40.926 --> 03:33:50.375
I have the pleasure of introducing a colleague that is going to be in addition to the CTA liaison for the teachers in that.

03:33:50.436 --> 03:33:51.617
You've seen her come up and that's

03:33:53.946 --> 03:33:56.707
Hi, I'm Angela de Ramos.

03:33:56.867 --> 03:33:59.409
I just want to thank you for giving me this opportunity.

03:33:59.869 --> 03:34:05.992
I've been a 21-year veteran of the classroom, and I just see this as one more trajectory in being an advocate for children.

03:34:06.492 --> 03:34:06.812
Thank you.

03:34:08.433 --> 03:34:08.733
Welcome.

03:34:11.655 --> 03:34:13.816
Jessie, you were signed up for public comment?

03:34:15.156 --> 03:34:16.157
Any more public comments?

03:34:17.933 --> 03:34:24.061
That closes the public comment and I believe I can now close the board state board meeting for September.

03:34:24.241 --> 03:34:24.902
Thank you very much.
