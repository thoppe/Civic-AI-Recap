WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
All right.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.160
Good morning, everyone.

00:09.160 --> 00:14.720
Seeing that we have a large set of board members present, Brooks, will you please call the

00:14.720 --> 00:18.960
roll to establish our quorum?

00:18.960 --> 00:21.080
Member Burr.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
President Darling-Hammond.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Here.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.080
Member Fattah.

00:24.080 --> 00:25.080
Here.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.080
Member Glover-Woods.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.080
Here.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
Member McQuillan.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
Here.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.080
Member Navo.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
Here.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.080
Member Patil-Brownson.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.080
Here.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.080
Member Rodriguez.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.080
Here.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Member Rucker.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.080
Here.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
Vice President Strauss.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
Here.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.080
Member Son.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
Here.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.080
We have a quorum.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.080
Terrific.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.080
Thank you very much.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
I hereby declare that we have a quorum.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
Thank you.

00:47.080 --> 01:02.560
I hereby call the February 2021 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at

01:02.560 --> 01:03.560
8.32 a.m.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.320
I'd like to commence by saluting the flag.

01:07.320 --> 01:13.240
Member Fattah, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:13.240 --> 01:17.040
Of course.

01:17.040 --> 01:25.320
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:25.320 --> 01:33.120
which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
Thank you so much.

01:34.120 --> 01:43.760
And at this point, I want to end the oath to Eileen Strauss and when...

01:43.760 --> 01:44.760
Sue is here.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.760
Sue is here?

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
Yes.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.480
Oh, there you are.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.480
Very good.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.480
And to members to Berk.

01:53.480 --> 01:54.480
Excellent.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.240
This is perfect timing.

01:57.240 --> 02:05.160
So I'd like to ask you both to please raise your right hand and repeat after me, I and

02:05.160 --> 02:08.560
then Eileen, do you say your name, and Sue?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.640
Do solemnly swear.

02:10.640 --> 02:11.640
I do.

02:11.640 --> 02:12.640
Do solemnly swear.

02:12.640 --> 02:13.640
I do.

02:13.640 --> 02:14.640
Do solemnly swear.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
I do.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.440
That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,

02:19.440 --> 02:20.440
foreign and domestic.

02:20.440 --> 02:26.440
That I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,

02:26.440 --> 02:29.440
foreign and domestic.

02:29.440 --> 02:33.640
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
and the Constitution of the State of California.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.640
That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and

02:41.640 --> 02:43.640
the Constitution of California.

02:43.640 --> 02:49.640
That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

02:49.640 --> 02:55.640
That I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion.

02:55.640 --> 03:00.640
And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

03:00.640 --> 03:06.640
And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties upon which I am about to enter.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.640
Thank you, Eileen.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.640
Thank you, Sue.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.640
We know that you will do all of those things because you've been doing them for us for

03:12.640 --> 03:18.640
so many years and we are thrilled that you will be able to spend another year guiding

03:18.640 --> 03:21.640
this State Board of Education.

03:21.640 --> 03:25.640
And so now I'm going to give our general announcements.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.640
The following item on the agenda has an addendum on item two, the Every Student Deceased Act

03:30.640 --> 03:35.640
Authorization to Pursue Flexibility on or on Waiver of Assessment Accountability and

03:35.640 --> 03:39.640
School Identification and Federal Funding Flexibility Requirements.

03:39.640 --> 03:45.640
Members of the public can call in for public comment to view the live stream of the meeting

03:45.640 --> 03:48.640
to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

03:48.640 --> 03:53.640
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access

03:53.640 --> 03:57.640
code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.640
We will post that number and the code at each moment where comments are invited.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.640
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.640
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

04:11.640 --> 04:16.640
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they're

04:16.640 --> 04:21.640
following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.640
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

04:26.640 --> 04:31.640
And item three is the general public comment item during which members of the public may

04:31.640 --> 04:36.640
provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the Board's agenda.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.640
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking.

04:40.640 --> 04:46.640
Keep your cameras on at all times except during the scheduled breaks.

04:46.640 --> 04:51.640
And ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's virtual meeting.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
For each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand

04:55.640 --> 05:03.640
using the Zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment.

05:03.640 --> 05:13.640
And at this point, item one is the State Board priorities item.

05:13.640 --> 05:25.640
And I am going to make a few comments just about kind of where we are in the process of things.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.640
I've got to manage my technology here for a second.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.640
So give me a moment, please.

05:43.640 --> 05:49.640
So I just want to launch us into this meeting by thanking.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.640
I'm hearing an echo.

05:51.640 --> 05:57.640
If people could mute their lines in case that's causing the echo, that'd be great.

05:57.640 --> 06:02.640
I want to, of course, start by acknowledging where we are in the school year in California,

06:02.640 --> 06:10.640
thanking all of the educators throughout our state and all of the nutrition support staff

06:10.640 --> 06:16.640
and custodians and bus drivers and everyone else who has been engaged in trying to figure out

06:16.640 --> 06:19.640
how to manage our way through this pandemic.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.640
We've had an extraordinary year.

06:21.640 --> 06:26.640
We've had all kinds of outreach from schools to communities,

06:26.640 --> 06:33.640
everything from meals to making sure that households have connectivity

06:33.640 --> 06:39.640
and students have devices inventing ways to engage in distance learning where that is necessary

06:39.640 --> 06:48.640
and working hard as we are doing now to try to get more and more districts back for in-person instruction.

06:48.640 --> 06:56.640
Even as we've kind of negotiated this multiple spikes in the pandemic that have influenced

06:56.640 --> 07:03.640
our ability to offer instruction in the ways we would normally want to do it.

07:03.640 --> 07:12.640
There are efforts underway now, of course, with billions of dollars being appropriated by both

07:12.640 --> 07:19.640
the legislature and through federal funding for schools that has recently arrived to implement

07:19.640 --> 07:28.640
safety measures, including funding for personal protective equipment, safety supplies, ventilation.

07:28.640 --> 07:36.640
Over 1,000 schools in 41 counties are implementing school-centered COVID-19 testing now

07:36.640 --> 07:39.640
with the state Valencia branch laboratory.

07:39.640 --> 07:45.640
The state testing capacity and supported schools is the most robust in the nation

07:45.640 --> 07:53.640
and continues apace with growth in access and successful piloting of school-based

07:53.640 --> 08:00.640
real-time testing in districts up and down the state, urban, suburban, and rural districts.

08:00.640 --> 08:06.640
We have new transparency and accountability measures, including data reporting directives

08:06.640 --> 08:12.640
and corresponding maps that empower families and school staff to know about their school reopening status.

08:12.640 --> 08:20.640
Over 300 school districts have received direct technical assistance from the state safe schools team.

08:20.640 --> 08:26.640
And that engagement from that team with dozens of districts has been in response to reports received

08:26.640 --> 08:29.640
from thousands of parents and school staff.

08:29.640 --> 08:35.640
We've launched the Safe Schools for All hub as a one-stop shop for school leaders, staff, and families.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.640
The hub includes playbooks and guidance and everything from privacy issues related to testing

08:40.640 --> 08:45.640
to establishing safe and stable groups in high school settings.

08:45.640 --> 08:55.640
We are hopeful that we will be seeing much more substantial school reopenings.

08:55.640 --> 09:00.640
Of course, vaccinations are increasing all across the state as well.

09:00.640 --> 09:07.640
But with all of that, with all of these efforts, it is still the case that 95 percent of our students

09:07.640 --> 09:12.640
are in districts that are in the purple tier of infection rates.

09:12.640 --> 09:21.640
That about 80 percent of students are still in remote learning in some fashion.

09:21.640 --> 09:31.640
And that we have a very intense and long road to go to reopen schools fully in the state of California.

09:31.640 --> 09:40.640
So it is in the context of that set of both initiatives and variables that we contend with

09:40.640 --> 09:50.640
that we will be taking up the question about how to understand and act on our students' learning and progress

09:50.640 --> 10:00.640
Of course, our districts have been developing and have used instructional continuity plans

10:00.640 --> 10:08.640
to work toward a way to be sure that all kids are engaged in learning

10:08.640 --> 10:17.640
where to the greatest extent possible using online capacity where that is necessary

10:17.640 --> 10:26.640
and using formative and summative assessments to support and monitor their progress.

10:26.640 --> 10:31.640
So we are proud of all of the extraordinary efforts that have gone on in the state.

10:31.640 --> 10:37.640
We want to tackle today the question of how to both continue our progress,

10:37.640 --> 10:43.640
meet the needs of students, those who have experienced significant trauma,

10:44.640 --> 10:51.640
those who are in need of accelerated learning opportunities both during the school year and into the summer

10:51.640 --> 10:53.640
and into the next school year.

10:53.640 --> 10:59.640
And I look forward to working with the board, with the members of the public

10:59.640 --> 11:05.640
who have been sharing their thoughts and views with us about the path forward

11:05.640 --> 11:09.640
as we work through the issues that we face today,

11:09.640 --> 11:15.640
which are about both our own plans and the ways in which we will communicate with the federal government

11:15.640 --> 11:21.640
about the requirements that are in law in the Every Student Succeeds Act.

11:21.640 --> 11:29.640
With that, I want to take up action on the draft minutes of our January 2021 meeting.

11:29.640 --> 11:36.640
And we will also open the phone line for the public comment queue while we're doing that.

11:37.640 --> 11:45.640
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the number shown on the public comment slide.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.640
And we'll see if that slide is coming up.

11:49.640 --> 11:53.640
While we are waiting for any members of the public to call in,

11:53.640 --> 12:00.640
do I have a motion from a board member to approve the January 13th, 14th, 2021 State Board of Education

12:00.640 --> 12:03.640
draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.640
I move approval.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.640
Thank you very much.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.640
Do I have a second?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.640
Thank you very much.

12:11.640 --> 12:20.640
So with that, we don't have the slide up yet for public comments.

12:20.640 --> 12:24.640
I want to ask whoever is in charge of that to get the slide up for public comments

12:24.640 --> 12:28.640
so that when we turn to that, people will have been able to dial in.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.640
We're working on that right now.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.640
Thank you very much.

12:35.640 --> 12:44.640
And so meanwhile, we'll call a roll call vote on the approval of the minutes.

12:49.640 --> 12:50.640
That's great.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.640
There's the public comment slide.

12:52.640 --> 12:57.640
And Brooks, will you please call the roll for the vote on the minutes?

12:58.640 --> 12:59.640
Member Burr.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.640
Here.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.640
Yes.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.640
Both.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
President Darling-Han.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
Yes.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.640
Member Patah.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.640
Yes.

13:10.640 --> 13:11.640
Member Glover-Woods.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.640
Yes.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Member McQuillan.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.640
Yes.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
Member Navo.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Yes.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.640
Member Patil-Brownson.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.640
Yes.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.640
Member Rodriguez.

13:24.640 --> 13:25.640
Yes.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.640
Member Rucker.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.640
Yes.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
Vice President Strauss.

13:29.640 --> 13:30.640
Yes.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.640
Member Son.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
Yes.

13:33.640 --> 13:34.640
Passes unanimously.

13:36.640 --> 13:37.640
All right.

13:39.640 --> 13:44.640
Item two is the Every Student Succeed Act Authorization to Pursue Flexibility on or

13:44.640 --> 13:48.640
a waiver of assessment accountability and school identification and federal funding

13:48.640 --> 13:50.640
flexibility requirements.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.640
And this item does have an addendum.

13:53.640 --> 13:58.640
The CDE recommendation is to request the State Board of Education to take action as

13:58.640 --> 14:00.640
deemed necessary and appropriate.

14:01.640 --> 14:06.640
And I think Chief Deputy Superintendent Gregson will provide some opening comments,

14:06.640 --> 14:11.640
which will be followed by Deputy Superintendent Maves and Assessment Director Vang.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
Yes.

14:14.640 --> 14:17.640
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.640
I'm Stephanie Gregson, Chief Deputy Superintendent of Public Instruction.

14:21.640 --> 14:27.640
As President Darling-Hammond said, in many ways this past year has no credit changing

14:27.640 --> 14:28.640
for us all.

14:29.640 --> 14:35.640
And as we turn the discussion to assessment, there will be many points to discuss on all

14:35.640 --> 14:39.640
the different aspects of the assessment in this unique year.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.640
And as the discussion progresses, we ask that you keep students at the forefront of your

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
conversation.

14:46.640 --> 14:50.640
Our students are resilient, strong and courageous.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.640
They have experienced a year like no other.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.640
We would love to pursue a general waiver.

14:57.640 --> 15:02.640
And at the same time, we understand the importance of collecting data to measure the impact of

15:02.640 --> 15:03.640
distance learning.

15:03.640 --> 15:08.640
We also know the most valuable metrics we can use to understand a student's academic

15:08.640 --> 15:13.640
process will always remain the ones that are collected by educators and schools on a

15:13.640 --> 15:19.640
regular, ongoing basis in classrooms, even virtual, where individual relationships with

15:19.640 --> 15:23.640
students are fostered and supports are provided in real time.

15:24.640 --> 15:30.640
We recommend the State Board take action on providing full flexibility and choices for our

15:30.640 --> 15:36.640
local education agencies, including looking at extending timelines and approving submitting

15:36.640 --> 15:38.640
a waiver for the participation rate.

15:39.640 --> 15:44.640
The pandemic has afforded us the opportunity to reflect on our systems in many ways,

15:44.640 --> 15:47.640
specifically how we measure student learning.

15:47.640 --> 15:52.640
This is an opportunity for us to take steps on an assessment approach that represents a

15:52.640 --> 15:58.640
system that lifts up, educates and cares for every student.

15:58.640 --> 16:03.640
Our presentations today will provide the necessary background and context information to

16:03.640 --> 16:05.640
help inform your discussion.

16:05.640 --> 16:10.640
And so now I'd like to hand off to Dr. Mao Vang, Director of the Assessment Development

16:10.640 --> 16:12.640
and Administration Division.

16:12.640 --> 16:13.640
Dr. Vang.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.640
Thank you, Dr. Grayson.

16:18.640 --> 16:22.640
I will begin by sharing my presentation.

16:26.640 --> 16:27.640
First.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.640
Thank you.

17:05.640 --> 17:06.640
Okay.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.640
I believe you can see the slide now.

17:11.640 --> 17:18.640
Thank you, Dr. Grayson, Deputy Grayson, President Darlin-Hammond and board members.

17:18.640 --> 17:23.640
Again, I am Mao Vang, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.640
The item before you is both an action and information item.

17:27.640 --> 17:34.640
Later in my presentation, I will be joined with with joined by Rachel Maves, our Deputy

17:34.640 --> 17:39.640
Superintendent of Public Instruction of the Instruction and Measurement Branch at the

17:39.640 --> 17:43.640
University at the California Department of Education.

17:43.640 --> 17:49.640
And in addition, we have Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Assessment Measurement Accountability

17:49.640 --> 17:51.640
and Reporting Division.

17:51.640 --> 17:56.640
Jerry Winkler, Director of the Educational Data Management Division.

17:56.640 --> 18:02.640
And our other guests of Marianne Arcella, who is an Executive Director at ETS, our

18:02.640 --> 18:04.640
testing contractor.

18:04.640 --> 18:10.640
And Tony Alper, Executive Director of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

18:10.640 --> 18:13.640
They will be available to assist with questions.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.640
So this presentation will include the following topics.

18:21.640 --> 18:27.640
Federal and state requirements, preparations that we have made for spring testing and

18:27.640 --> 18:32.640
stakeholder feedback we've gathered along the way, and flexibilities offered by the

18:32.640 --> 18:34.640
U.S. Department of Education.

18:38.640 --> 18:47.640
Since this letter is so new, I will begin with a quick overview, as President Darlin-Hammond

18:47.640 --> 18:53.640
alluded to earlier, but I will just do a quick overview of the flexibilities offer

18:53.640 --> 18:55.640
from the U.S. Department of Education.

18:55.640 --> 19:01.640
So on February 22nd, two days ago, the U.S. Department of Education did send a letter

19:01.640 --> 19:07.640
to states indicating that they can request a waiver to take advantage of the flexibilities

19:07.640 --> 19:14.640
offer by the U.S. Department of Education for the 2020-21 school year of the accountability

19:14.640 --> 19:21.640
and school identification requirements in the Every Student's Elementary and Secondary

19:21.640 --> 19:28.640
Education Act, or ESEA, as amended in the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.

19:28.640 --> 19:35.640
States receiving this waiver would not be required to implement and report the results

19:35.640 --> 19:37.640
of its accountability system.

19:37.640 --> 19:42.640
That includes calculating progress toward long-term goals and measurements of interim

19:42.640 --> 19:49.640
progress or indicators, and annually, meaningfully differentiate among its public schools using

19:49.640 --> 19:53.640
the data from the 2020-2021 school year.

19:58.640 --> 20:04.640
In addition, the states that are granted the waiver would also not be required to identify

20:04.640 --> 20:10.640
schools for comprehensive support and improvement, targeted support and improvement, and additional

20:10.640 --> 20:17.640
targeted support and improvement based on data from the 2020-2021 school year.

20:17.640 --> 20:24.640
It would be required to continue to support previously identified schools in the 2020-21

20:24.640 --> 20:31.640
and 22 school year, resume school identification in the fall of 2022, and ensure transparency

20:31.640 --> 20:37.640
to parents and the public as a condition of receiving the waiver.

20:38.640 --> 20:45.640
States will continue to publicly report disaggregated chronic absenteeism data for the 2020-21 school year.

20:51.640 --> 20:56.640
Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Education is recommending that states implement assessment

20:56.640 --> 21:03.640
flexibility, including administering a shortened version of its statewide assessments, offering

21:03.640 --> 21:10.640
remote administration where feasible, and or extending the testing window to the greatest extent practicable.

21:15.640 --> 21:22.640
Of the flexibilities that the U.S. Department of Education has recommended regarding assessments,

21:22.640 --> 21:25.640
California has already taken the following steps.

21:25.640 --> 21:30.640
First, administering a shortened version of the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments

21:30.640 --> 21:36.640
for English Language Arts, Literacy, or ELA, and Mathematics, which the State Board of Education

21:36.640 --> 21:42.640
approved for the implementation at their November 2020 meeting.

21:42.640 --> 21:49.640
And the second component offering remote administration, which is already available to California

21:49.640 --> 21:56.640
local educational agencies for all of the California assessment of student performance

21:57.640 --> 22:04.640
and progress, or CASP, and the ALPAC, which is the English Language Efficiency Assessments

22:04.640 --> 22:06.640
for California.

22:08.640 --> 22:13.640
So on the following slides, I will cover the federal and state requirements.

22:20.640 --> 22:31.640
So, summative assessments overall are a necessary component of a comprehensive assessment system.

22:31.640 --> 22:36.640
And the results that are provided, they provide important academic data at the state level

22:36.640 --> 22:45.640
for decision making regarding reporting policies and programs, as well as identifying professional development needs.

22:46.640 --> 22:55.640
So the primary purpose of statewide summative testing overall is to provide data on student

22:55.640 --> 23:00.640
learning in schools and local educational agencies to inform their continuous improvement

23:00.640 --> 23:03.640
efforts, as well as create actionable change.

23:03.640 --> 23:10.640
ESSA requires states to administer annual summative assessments as a condition of an

23:10.640 --> 23:15.640
approved federal ESSA plan and the receipt of federal ESSA funds.

23:15.640 --> 23:21.640
So under federal ESSA, the Every Student Succeeds Act, states must administer annual statewide

23:21.640 --> 23:27.640
assessments in reading language arts and mathematics to all students in grades three through eight

23:27.640 --> 23:34.640
and once in high school, as well as in science, at least once in grades three through five,

23:34.640 --> 23:39.640
once in six through nine, and once in 10 through 12.

23:40.640 --> 23:47.640
So state and federal law require that local educational agencies administer a state test

23:47.640 --> 23:55.640
of English language proficiency to eligible students in kindergarten through grade 12.

24:00.640 --> 24:08.640
ESSA also requires that a state annually and meaningfully differentiate all public schools

24:09.640 --> 24:14.640
and the requirements to identify schools for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement

24:14.640 --> 24:20.640
and additional targeted support and improvement based on data from the current school year.

24:28.640 --> 24:34.640
And then furthermore, ESSA also requires additional report card provisions related to certain

24:34.640 --> 24:40.640
assessment and accountability in sections 111H based on data from the current school year.

24:48.640 --> 24:54.640
Following up with state requirements, so to meet federal and state requirements, we have,

24:54.640 --> 24:59.640
in terms of our assessments, we have the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress,

25:00.640 --> 25:12.640
as defined in California Education Code, section 60601 through 60649, which include the following.

25:12.640 --> 25:18.640
We have the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments and the California Alternate Assessments for

25:18.640 --> 25:24.640
English Language Arts and Mathematics in grades three through eight and 11, and the California

25:24.640 --> 25:31.640
Science Test and the California Alternate Assessments for Science in grades five and eight

25:31.640 --> 25:38.640
and once in high school. All first time grade 12 students who have not yet taken a science

25:38.640 --> 25:44.640
assessment in high school are required to take the CAST or the California Science Test or the

25:44.640 --> 25:50.640
California Alternate Assessment for Science for those eligible students.

25:50.640 --> 25:56.640
And then we also offer the California Spanish Assessment for Spanish Reading Language Arts

25:56.640 --> 26:04.640
as an optional test. Furthermore, the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California

26:04.640 --> 26:13.640
or LPAC, as defined in Education Code, sections 313 and 60810, include the initial LPAC,

26:13.640 --> 26:16.640
the summative LPAC, and the alternate LPAC.

26:21.640 --> 26:29.640
Which is still in development. And on this slide, we have state requirements regarding the

26:29.640 --> 26:37.640
California School Dashboard that's pursuant to Education Code, section 52064.5.

26:37.640 --> 26:48.640
And with that, we need to adopt, with the adoption and reporting of performance on state and local

26:48.640 --> 26:55.640
indicators on the California School Dashboard for each local educational agency and performance criteria

26:55.640 --> 27:01.640
for those local educational agencies for assistance and intervention.

27:01.640 --> 27:19.640
So this, for the 2020-21 initial and summative assessments testing windows, this displays the initial

27:19.640 --> 27:27.640
and summative assessment timelines that we have. The statewide testing windows here are how we typically

27:27.640 --> 27:35.640
launch our assessment programs. And one change this year is the California, the CASP,

27:35.640 --> 27:41.640
Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments for ELA and Mathematics. So in order to change to the

27:41.640 --> 27:46.640
adjusted blueprints approved by the State Board of Education during the November meeting,

27:46.640 --> 27:51.640
these assessments did not launch until February 22nd, two days ago.

27:51.640 --> 27:58.640
As provided in this table, our assessment system operates year round with pretty much minimal

27:58.640 --> 28:04.640
down times. So local educational agencies select their own testing window within the available

28:04.640 --> 28:12.640
statewide testing window. Although California has been preparing, adjusting, and learning how to

28:12.640 --> 28:18.640
administer assessments during the pandemic, we know that there are varying circumstances across the

28:18.640 --> 28:24.640
state, and really for some, it will be very difficult to administer assessments if it is not safe to

28:24.640 --> 28:31.640
do so at all in person. So at this time, I just want to share a little information with you about,

28:31.640 --> 28:40.640
there are about 79 local educational agencies that have opened up their CASP testing windows, and all

28:40.640 --> 28:47.640
LEAs can administer the summative out pack. So I'm pleased to report that students are taking the

28:47.640 --> 28:53.640
tests. The following tests have been started. There's been two Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments

28:53.640 --> 29:02.640
for Mathematics started, two CASP or Science Assessments, four California Alternate Assessments for

29:02.640 --> 29:10.640
English Language Arts and Mathematics, and 207 California Alternate Assessments for Science

29:10.640 --> 29:20.640
performance tasks started, and over 451,000 summative out pack assessments have started.

29:20.640 --> 29:30.640
So since the summative out pack just opened on the 1st, people are, on February 1st, they are moving

29:30.640 --> 29:36.640
forward with that one. So there are no tests started yet for the Smarter Balanced Summative ELA or

29:36.640 --> 29:44.640
English Language Arts Literacy or the California Spanish Assessment. So this is a reflection of the

29:44.640 --> 29:50.640
tremendous amount of work and preparation on the part of the local educational agencies, our test site

29:50.640 --> 29:57.640
coordinators, our LEA coordinators, and staff that they continue to and by every means possible

29:57.640 --> 30:06.640
to support California students and their learning. So I will highlight some key events, some events

30:06.640 --> 30:15.640
that brought us to where we are today. Just to quickly reflect back that in March 2020, California

30:15.640 --> 30:21.640
requested and received approval from the U.S. Department of Education to waive the testing

30:21.640 --> 30:29.640
requirement, along with reporting and accountability as well, but I'll focus on that in this slide.

30:29.640 --> 30:39.640
Also in June 2020, Senate Bill 98 was passed that provided funds for an extension of the 2019-2020

30:39.640 --> 30:45.640
summative out pack as an optional test for the purpose of reclassification and COVID-related

30:45.640 --> 30:53.640
activities. Along with that, it required local educational agencies and schools to provide valid

30:53.640 --> 30:59.640
and reliable data for their improvement plans and the public to inform student progress.

30:59.640 --> 31:05.640
It prohibits the California Department of Education from publishing state and local indicators on the

31:05.640 --> 31:11.640
2020 California School Dashboard and required CDE or California Department of Education to

31:11.640 --> 31:19.640
report in CALPADS valid and reliable data collected in the 2019-2020 school year that would have been

31:19.640 --> 31:33.640
included in the 2020 dashboard. Coinciding with these activities was the approval of SB 820 that

31:33.640 --> 31:39.640
extended the initial out pack testing window of 30 calendar days from enrollment by an additional

31:39.640 --> 31:47.640
45 calendar days. So during this time, local educational agencies rallied and ensured that 90% of

31:47.640 --> 31:55.640
eligible students were assessed, 60% doing so remotely. So San Diego Unified School District served

31:55.640 --> 32:03.640
as a model, example assessing 97% of their students through 100% remote administration.

32:03.640 --> 32:11.640
In October 2020, the U.S. Department of Education advised states that assessment waivers will not be

32:11.640 --> 32:19.640
considered for spring 2020 test administration at that time, including until today. So to address

32:19.640 --> 32:25.640
and lessen the test and burden on local educational agencies, in November, our California State Board

32:25.640 --> 32:31.640
of Education did approve the adjusted blueprints for the Smarter Balanced summative assessments in

32:31.640 --> 32:41.640
English language arts, literacy, and mathematics. So in order to be responsive to the field and to

32:41.640 --> 32:49.640
ensure that safe assessment options when in person was not available and continued to provide LEAs with

32:49.640 --> 32:55.640
flexible options within our control in December 2020 through January, the following spring

32:55.640 --> 33:01.640
administration considerations were made. We have in person and remote computer based

33:01.640 --> 33:11.640
English language arts assessments, mathematics, science, and summative out pack. And for in person

33:11.640 --> 33:17.640
administration only for the California alternate assessments for English language arts,

33:17.640 --> 33:23.640
mathematics, science and continue the locally determined English language proficiency assessments

33:23.640 --> 33:31.640
as we made the decision to postpone the alternate out pack operational field tests until the 2021-22 school

33:31.640 --> 33:41.640
year. And that leads us to two days ago when we received the guidance from the U.S. Department of

33:41.640 --> 33:49.640
Education on the following of topics of accountability and school identification, transparency,

33:49.640 --> 33:59.640
and public reporting, along with the assessment flexibilities. And with that, I will turn it over to

33:59.640 --> 34:07.640
Rachel Maves to continue presenting. Rachel? Thank you, Mal. I appreciate that introduction. Part of our

34:07.640 --> 34:15.640
hope during that time was one, to situate assessments correctly within the comprehensive assessment

34:15.640 --> 34:21.640
package that you see within districts and understanding the necessity of those pieces, but then also to

34:21.640 --> 34:27.640
level set with what our state and federal requirements are as we consider the flexibilities that are being

34:27.640 --> 34:33.640
offered. So I have the distinct pleasure and thank you, Mal, for giving me the space to share this part

34:33.640 --> 34:41.640
of discussing some of the preparations for spring assessments. This year has presented and I would argue

34:41.640 --> 34:49.640
that spring assessments are the best way to present unfathomable challenges. Yet in the midst of

34:49.640 --> 34:55.640
contexts that often feel chaotic, we continue to see some bright spots. Engaging with the field with

34:55.640 --> 35:01.640
our state's dedicated and committed testing coordinators, CalPADS directors, assessment directors,

35:01.640 --> 35:07.640
teachers and administrators in iterative improvement processes to ensure to the best of our ability

35:07.640 --> 35:13.640
has been an unbelievable bright spot. On the following slides, I will cover a summary of some of these

35:13.640 --> 35:23.640
preparations. Next slide. Mal or Alex, next slide.

35:23.640 --> 35:35.640
Get in there, sorry. Sometimes when I'm not presenting, it sticks.

35:41.640 --> 35:49.640
So first we're going to look at the implementation of the adjusted blueprints. Testing time has been a key concern

35:49.640 --> 35:55.640
for all stakeholders. In November of 2020, the State Board of Education approved the use of adjusted blueprints

35:55.640 --> 36:01.640
for the Smarter Balanced summative ELA and math tests. The timing of the approval, which was in advance

36:01.640 --> 36:07.640
of the formal ED guidance, was required to allow sufficient time for development and administration.

36:07.640 --> 36:15.640
With the SBE approval in place, the CDE directed the state assessment contractor, ETS, to implement the

36:15.640 --> 36:21.640
adjusted blueprint in the California assessment system. Mal, could you go to the next slide, please?

36:21.640 --> 36:27.640
We estimate that the adjusted blueprints will reduce testing time in ELA and mathematics by

36:27.640 --> 36:33.640
one and a half to two hours, depending on the grade. We focused on adjusting the ELA and

36:33.640 --> 36:39.640
mathematics summative tests because these tests impacted the most students and also are the longer tests

36:39.640 --> 36:45.640
for the other CASP assessments. Mal, could you go to the next slide, please?

36:45.640 --> 36:51.640
The other non-Smarter Balanced blueprints have not changed, as many of them are already much shorter.

36:51.640 --> 36:57.640
The CAAs for ELA and math, CSA, and CASP are one to two hours long.

36:57.640 --> 37:03.640
The CAA for science is an online assessment administered to students with the most significant cognitive

37:03.640 --> 37:09.640
disabilities, whose individualized education program indicates the use of an

37:09.640 --> 37:15.640
alternate assessment. Test examiners administer the assessment to students one on one.

37:15.640 --> 37:21.640
Eligible students take the CAA for science in grades five and eight in one time in high school.

37:21.640 --> 37:27.640
Next slide. The CAA for science consists of four embedded PTs

37:27.640 --> 37:32.640
administered to students as close to instruction as possible throughout the school.

37:32.640 --> 37:37.640
The table displays the estimated testing times for summative LPAC.

37:37.640 --> 37:42.640
Again, this assessment is already much shorter in terms of estimated total testing time.

37:42.640 --> 37:48.640
Summative LPAC is less than two hours for the lower grades and up to three hours for the upper grades.

37:48.640 --> 37:56.640
Mal, next slide. In fall of 2020, CDE committed to ensuring flexible options for

37:56.640 --> 38:02.640
assessment administration when it became clear some LEAs would be unable to provide

38:02.640 --> 38:08.640
in-person instruction for students. We heard overwhelmingly from the field the importance

38:08.640 --> 38:14.640
and the need to allow additional time to administer the optional summative LPAC for reclassification

38:14.640 --> 38:20.640
purposes. Additionally, the flexible options allowed LEAs to administer the LPAC initial

38:20.640 --> 38:26.640
and smarter balanced interim assessments whether students were in person or remote.

38:26.640 --> 38:32.640
LEAs had the option of testing students in person following their local health and safety guidelines

38:32.640 --> 38:38.640
or testing students remotely using the electronic devices and tools they used for distance learning.

38:38.640 --> 38:44.640
Next slide. These fall administrations led to multiple opportunities to LEAs, CDE,

38:44.640 --> 38:50.640
and ETS to engage in collaborative discussions regarding the assessment experience.

38:50.640 --> 38:56.640
Using the feedback from the field, we further refined and adjusted our processes in preparation

38:56.640 --> 39:02.640
for the spring assessment window. This included integrating a remote administration feature

39:02.640 --> 39:08.640
directly into the ETS delivery system, having a clear understanding that students must use

39:08.640 --> 39:14.640
the secure browser to take the assessments whether it is in person or remotely administered, which provides

39:14.640 --> 39:20.640
the appropriate level of test security that will allow us to maintain the assessment's validity and

39:20.640 --> 39:26.640
reliability. And it also prompted active engagement with LEAs and with technology companies

39:26.640 --> 39:32.640
such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft in the development and testing of the embedded remote

39:32.640 --> 39:38.640
administration features. The remote testing functionality includes video monitoring,

39:38.640 --> 39:44.640
video calling, and messaging. Somebody will have to give you a live demonstration because it's pretty neat

39:44.640 --> 39:50.640
what we've been able to develop. Test administrators or test examiners can view students testing

39:50.640 --> 39:56.640
in real time by video while also monitoring each student's progress through the tests.

39:56.640 --> 40:02.640
The video feed is similar to the grid or thumbnail view of an outline meeting application.

40:02.640 --> 40:08.640
As in previous administrations, the test administrator can pause a student's test at any time,

40:08.640 --> 40:14.640
whether they are conducting a remote or in-person administration. The test administrator and the student

40:14.640 --> 40:20.640
can communicate directly with each other through the test delivery system by a one-to-one video call

40:20.640 --> 40:26.640
or text message. The test administrator can also send out a broadcast message to all students

40:26.640 --> 40:32.640
in the testing system. Videos showing the remote administration process are available

40:32.640 --> 40:38.640
at CASP slash LPAC YouTube channel.

40:38.640 --> 40:42.640
Next slide.

40:42.640 --> 40:48.640
So over the course of this time, the CDE held monthly assessment stakeholder meetings to continue

40:48.640 --> 40:54.640
to gather feedback from our stakeholder groups. ETS joined CDE in presentations at the regional

40:54.640 --> 41:00.640
assessment network meetings, which included statewide meetings in January, 13 regional meetings

41:00.640 --> 41:06.640
January through February, and five training sessions. We received feedback directly from

41:06.640 --> 41:12.640
stakeholders, including the California Information Technology and Education Association, Association of

41:12.640 --> 41:18.640
California School Administrators, the California Parent Teacher Association, California Bilingual

41:18.640 --> 41:24.640
Educators Association, Californians Together, and the California Small Schools Association.

41:24.640 --> 41:30.640
During our discussions with stakeholders and regional assessment network members, we shared information about

41:30.640 --> 41:36.640
the proposed plans and asked them to share their members' experiences with the fall administration,

41:36.640 --> 41:42.640
and their suggestions for improving the spring plans. Earlier this year, we asked LEAs to provide input

41:42.640 --> 41:48.640
on their technology readiness and their preferences for testing window options.

41:48.640 --> 41:54.640
The technology readiness survey was targeted to LEA technology managers and LEA testing coordinators.

41:54.640 --> 42:00.640
We asked about the types and the number of devices that their students use for distance learning and for taking the

42:00.640 --> 42:04.640
test, as well as their instructional plans for the remainder of the school year.

42:04.640 --> 42:10.640
We distributed the survey in January and received 510 responses for the survey.

42:10.640 --> 42:16.640
Respondents indicated that the majority of their students, 80%, are using devices

42:16.640 --> 42:22.640
provided by the LEA. Most, 71%, planned to continue their

42:22.640 --> 42:26.640
current instructional approach for the remainder of the school year. Approximately

42:26.640 --> 42:30.640
two-thirds indicated are currently in distance learning. In February, we asked LEA

42:30.640 --> 42:36.640
superintendents and test coordinators to respond to a survey on testing window options.

42:36.640 --> 42:42.640
I'll talk about the results of that survey later on. Next slide.

42:50.640 --> 42:54.640
Next slide.

42:54.640 --> 42:58.640
In our discussions, we placed the input on the spring plans into two categories,

42:58.640 --> 43:02.640
the process and testing. With regard to process,

43:02.640 --> 43:06.640
they asked, have an easier process to notify parents and guardians,

43:06.640 --> 43:10.640
add more communications and support for students, parents and guardians,

43:10.640 --> 43:14.640
and educators, reduce or eliminate handling

43:14.640 --> 43:18.640
of paper test materials, and keep remote administration features

43:18.640 --> 43:22.640
like existing instructional tools. With regard to testing,

43:22.640 --> 43:26.640
they recommended, waive testing or make it optional,

43:26.640 --> 43:30.640
as an example, eliminate accountability and participation requirements,

43:30.640 --> 43:34.640
resolve equity concerns for students to receive instruction, attendance,

43:34.640 --> 43:38.640
engagement, and technology as examples. Next slide.

43:38.640 --> 43:42.640
We also used our learnings from the fall

43:42.640 --> 43:46.640
administration to improve our training and communications for the spring

43:46.640 --> 43:50.640
2021 administration. We simplified the parent-guardian notification

43:50.640 --> 43:54.640
process that was noted on the previous slide. We used feedback

43:54.640 --> 43:58.640
from parents, guardians, educators, and administrators to simplify the communication

43:58.640 --> 44:02.640
tools and processes for notifying parents about the test administration.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.640
We developed a solution for the summative LPAT K-2 writing

44:06.640 --> 44:10.640
as it requires students to show their writing skills on paper or physical

44:10.640 --> 44:14.640
format. We worked with test examiners and assessment design experts

44:14.640 --> 44:18.640
to allow students to show their work while reducing the test security concerns

44:18.640 --> 44:22.640
of having parents and students manage the paper test materials.

44:22.640 --> 44:26.640
We developed additional training materials and created a spring

44:26.640 --> 44:30.640
administration web pages. I'll show you some of the additional training materials

44:30.640 --> 44:34.640
in the upcoming slides. Next slide, please.

44:34.640 --> 44:38.640
Communication

44:38.640 --> 44:42.640
has been a key component of our iterative processes.

44:42.640 --> 44:46.640
It was important to provide as much information as possible

44:46.640 --> 44:50.640
to LEAs, educators, parents, students, and stakeholders

44:50.640 --> 44:54.640
so that they too could make informed decisions at the

44:54.640 --> 44:58.640
local level. Building on the communications and training opportunities

44:58.640 --> 45:02.640
from the fall administration, ETS, our assessment contractor

45:02.640 --> 45:06.640
held a series of pretest workshops to ready the LEA testing coordinators

45:06.640 --> 45:10.640
for the spring 2021 administration.

45:10.640 --> 45:14.640
Prior to each workshop, the LEA testing coordinators completed

45:14.640 --> 45:18.640
prerequisite online courses to learn about LPAC, CASP,

45:18.640 --> 45:22.640
and the California assessment system. Participants then completed

45:22.640 --> 45:26.640
three pretest workshop sessions. We offered three pretest

45:26.640 --> 45:30.640
workshop sessions in December and three pretest workshop sessions in January.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.640
Participants could choose sessions from January and December

45:34.640 --> 45:38.640
that best met their schedules. Each workshop was tailored

45:38.640 --> 45:42.640
to provide the most up-to-date information on the test operations management

45:42.640 --> 45:46.640
system, components of CASP and LPAC, and managing

45:46.640 --> 45:50.640
testing and reporting. We held question and answer sessions

45:50.640 --> 45:54.640
in January as a follow-up to the pretest workshop information.

45:54.640 --> 45:58.640
About 4,300 participants attended these

45:58.640 --> 46:02.640
pretest workshops. In early January, we released a

46:02.640 --> 46:06.640
CDE assessment update webinar. The assessment update included

46:06.640 --> 46:10.640
updates and decisions since the December pretest. It was also video

46:10.640 --> 46:14.640
recorded and released on January 11th. Furthermore, ETS

46:14.640 --> 46:18.640
and CDE scheduled weekly office hours and coffee sessions to provide

46:18.640 --> 46:22.640
two-way communication between CDE and LEA staff, which I'll explain

46:22.640 --> 46:26.640
in more detail later. ETS continued to provide support and training

46:26.640 --> 46:30.640
at local regional assessment network meetings. The county offices

46:30.640 --> 46:34.640
of education RAND members represent a

46:34.640 --> 46:38.640
subcommittee of the Curriculum and Instruction Steering Committee of the California County

46:38.640 --> 46:42.640
Superintendents Educational Services Association.

46:42.640 --> 46:46.640
The purpose of RAND is to develop knowledge and

46:46.640 --> 46:50.640
understanding about California's assessment and accountability systems by facilitating

46:50.640 --> 46:54.640
communication between the California Department of Education and county

46:54.640 --> 46:58.640
offices, which represent the schools, districts, and county

46:58.640 --> 47:02.640
offices in the region. Next slide, now.

47:02.640 --> 47:06.640
In response to input from stakeholders and LEAs, we launched

47:06.640 --> 47:10.640
a spring administration website specifically for educators.

47:10.640 --> 47:14.640
The site includes all admit spring administration information in a centrally

47:14.640 --> 47:18.640
located place and is geared specifically for

47:18.640 --> 47:22.640
educators. The site includes detailed browser and technology requirements,

47:22.640 --> 47:26.640
training videos, quick reference guides, parent and guardian

47:26.640 --> 47:30.640
notification letters that we have made available in eight languages, and

47:30.640 --> 47:34.640
all of our question and answers from all office hours and coffee sessions.

47:34.640 --> 47:38.640
Next slide.

47:38.640 --> 47:42.640
In addition, we also developed a site for parents, guardians, and students.

47:42.640 --> 47:46.640
This site includes, again, testing information flyer that's available

47:46.640 --> 47:50.640
in eight languages, instructions for the

47:50.640 --> 47:54.640
secure browser, videos and quick reference guides in English and Spanish,

47:54.640 --> 47:58.640
and questions and answers that we've received from parents

47:58.640 --> 48:02.640
and guardians. This continues to be a work in progress.

48:02.640 --> 48:06.640
Over the coming weeks and months, we are committed to continuing

48:06.640 --> 48:10.640
to develop clear guidance and supports as it continues

48:10.640 --> 48:14.640
to be clear that parents, guardians, and students have a strong desire to know and understand

48:14.640 --> 48:18.640
this year's academic progress. Next slide.

48:18.640 --> 48:22.640
Here you will see the link tree

48:22.640 --> 48:26.640
list of resources. Again, this is a very quick place to

48:26.640 --> 48:30.640
access any of the resources that we have available in the

48:30.640 --> 48:34.640
multiple pages. Next slide.

48:34.640 --> 48:38.640
CDE supported by ETS

48:38.640 --> 48:42.640
launched weekly office hours and coffee sessions. The office hours

48:42.640 --> 48:46.640
were developed in response to the field's request for increased two-way communication.

48:46.640 --> 48:50.640
Every Thursday for the past month and a half, myself,

48:50.640 --> 48:54.640
Dr. Vane, and additional CDE and ETS staff

48:54.640 --> 48:58.640
provide updates, bring in guest speakers to share best practices and

48:58.640 --> 49:02.640
resources, and open up a live question and answer session for

49:02.640 --> 49:06.640
LEA staff to provide feedback and ask questions.

49:06.640 --> 49:10.640
Guest speakers included various LEAs that not only shared their learning

49:10.640 --> 49:14.640
experience from the fall LPAC administration,

49:14.640 --> 49:18.640
but freely shared their resources as well. Ed Trust West

49:18.640 --> 49:22.640
and California PTA provided suggestions and best practices

49:22.640 --> 49:26.640
in regards to communication with parents and community members.

49:26.640 --> 49:30.640
On average, each session engages about

49:30.640 --> 49:34.640
300 to 350 participants. Next slide, please.

49:34.640 --> 49:38.640
In order to

49:38.640 --> 49:42.640
provide additional data to districts, the SBE approved

49:42.640 --> 49:46.640
the Lexile and Quantile Hub to integrate through our test operations

49:46.640 --> 49:50.640
management system. Lexiles measure a student's reading

49:50.640 --> 49:54.640
levels and quantiles measure a student's mathematical levels. Additionally,

49:54.640 --> 49:58.640
LEAs have access to free premium access resources

49:58.640 --> 50:02.640
for California educators and have the opportunity to use the hub

50:02.640 --> 50:06.640
with locally available assessments and products that report

50:06.640 --> 50:10.640
Lexile and Quantile measures. I share all this information

50:10.640 --> 50:14.640
with you for a few reasons. First, I think it is

50:14.640 --> 50:18.640
vitally important to share with you our state board

50:18.640 --> 50:22.640
the commitment of our team at CDE to the field and the students

50:22.640 --> 50:26.640
of California. While I have only been in this position for nine months,

50:26.640 --> 50:30.640
I continue to be inspired by and grow

50:30.640 --> 50:34.640
in admiration for the large group of talented individuals

50:34.640 --> 50:38.640
that work quietly behind the scenes to serve our students

50:38.640 --> 50:42.640
under the vision, direction, and guidance of our state superintendent.

50:42.640 --> 50:46.640
Second, the support from our partners at

50:46.640 --> 50:50.640
SBAC and ETS has allowed us to continue to explore

50:50.640 --> 50:54.640
innovative options to support the field and students

50:54.640 --> 50:58.640
in an unprecedented year. And finally,

50:58.640 --> 51:02.640
to express a deep sense of gratitude to the field

51:02.640 --> 51:06.640
for your partnership, your candor, and your perseverance.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.640
Everything that I shared is a collaboration of the effort

51:10.640 --> 51:14.640
of your feedback. With that, next slide now,

51:14.640 --> 51:18.640
having explored the preparation for the spring assessment,

51:18.640 --> 51:22.640
we will now discuss the feedback we have received regarding spring

51:22.640 --> 51:26.640
assessments from stakeholders. Next slide.

51:26.640 --> 51:30.640
The CDE has received written correspondence from LEAs

51:30.640 --> 51:34.640
and stakeholder groups. The majority of feedback received

51:34.640 --> 51:38.640
reveals overwhelming support of submitting a waiver for relief of

51:38.640 --> 51:42.640
assessment requirements, citing varying degrees of student access

51:42.640 --> 51:46.640
to technology and the internet across the state, varying degrees

51:46.640 --> 51:50.640
of home testing environments for students, complying with

51:50.640 --> 51:54.640
the requirement that a secure browser must be used is difficult to implement.

51:54.640 --> 51:58.640
Some parents and guardians do not allow their children to have the camera

51:58.640 --> 52:02.640
on during the testing session. Next slide now.

52:02.640 --> 52:06.640
There's support for postponing for a fall administration

52:06.640 --> 52:10.640
rather than canceling the summative assessments if it came to that.

52:10.640 --> 52:14.640
Concerns over extended testing window as well as testing

52:14.640 --> 52:18.640
in fall 2021. Each option would further

52:18.640 --> 52:22.640
reduce time with students for extended learning.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.640
We've heard requests to submit for a waiver of assessment requirements,

52:26.640 --> 52:30.640
and we've heard concerns over the validity of assessment results.

52:30.640 --> 52:34.640
Next slide, please. We've also heard requests

52:34.640 --> 52:38.640
to more quickly make the data available should we move forward

52:38.640 --> 52:42.640
with assessments. We've heard that assessment data are greatly needed

52:42.640 --> 52:46.640
to best meet the needs of students, and we've also heard that

52:46.640 --> 52:50.640
the majority of parents nationwide and locally support moving forward

52:50.640 --> 52:54.640
with assessments. Our local conversations and the summary

52:54.640 --> 52:58.640
of the feedback mirrors what we are hearing nationally as well.

52:58.640 --> 53:02.640
Next slide now. In December,

53:02.640 --> 53:06.640
CCSSO did a survey of states to get a sense of what their plans are for

53:06.640 --> 53:10.640
this spring. CCSSO heard back from 39

53:10.640 --> 53:14.640
states. They found that most states are planning to do some form

53:14.640 --> 53:18.640
of the state's summative assessments. With that, states are exploring

53:18.640 --> 53:22.640
different approaches, including things like 19 states reporting

53:22.640 --> 53:26.640
they plan to extend their testing window, 8 states reporting they plan

53:26.640 --> 53:30.640
to shorten assessments. For those states that have students who are remote,

53:30.640 --> 53:34.640
about half of the states, 23, intend to try to bring students

53:34.640 --> 53:38.640
to a school site to take the summative assessment. Next slide, please.

53:38.640 --> 53:42.640
For English learners and students with disabilities, that number is

53:42.640 --> 53:46.640
even higher, with 31 states indicating they will try to bring students to a

53:46.640 --> 53:50.640
school site for the assessment. A handful of states, five at least

53:50.640 --> 53:54.640
at this time, that were exploring the option of remote administration

53:54.640 --> 53:58.640
of the summative assessment. Most states that responded, at least

53:58.640 --> 54:02.640
29, will be pursuing the addendum that we previously brought to

54:02.640 --> 54:06.640
the board that was offered by USED, seeking some relief from

54:06.640 --> 54:10.640
the accountability requirements. That was the addendum we had

54:10.640 --> 54:14.640
already brought to the board and approved, relieving us from the identification

54:14.640 --> 54:18.640
of CSI. As of February 19th, we believe

54:18.640 --> 54:22.640
that seven states have submitted a waiver to USED to waive

54:22.640 --> 54:26.640
assessment requirements. This was prior to the guidance being

54:26.640 --> 54:30.640
released on the 22nd. Next slide.

54:30.640 --> 54:34.640
In order to provide flexibility in the midst of

54:34.640 --> 54:38.640
these unprecedented times, the CDE proposes the following

54:38.640 --> 54:42.640
flexibilities offered by the US Department of Education.

54:42.640 --> 54:46.640
Now we're going to move into what was outlined within the guidance

54:46.640 --> 54:50.640
released from the US Department of Education on Monday.

54:50.640 --> 54:54.640
The first flexibility is underneath the accountability

54:54.640 --> 54:58.640
and school identification and transparency of public reporting.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.640
We wanted to highlight here, because this has been a question repeatedly,

55:02.640 --> 55:06.640
that this pertains specifically to

55:06.640 --> 55:10.640
and includes the 95% participation requirement.

55:10.640 --> 55:14.640
The ED is offering a waiver to the accountability tie to the academic

55:14.640 --> 55:18.640
indicator, but not the requirement to assess 95% of the

55:18.640 --> 55:22.640
students. In essence, the 95%

55:22.640 --> 55:26.640
participation requirement still stands, but there's no penalty if the

55:26.640 --> 55:30.640
95% participation requirement is not met. We have also

55:30.640 --> 55:34.640
received in the letter that ED will follow up with an optional state accountability

55:34.640 --> 55:38.640
waiver template, similar to what you saw before, that would outline what we've

55:38.640 --> 55:42.640
discussed today as a way for us to check the box and submit

55:42.640 --> 55:46.640
back to ED of our intentions. Next slide.

55:46.640 --> 55:50.640
Additionally, we have

55:50.640 --> 55:54.640
flexibility to implement

55:54.640 --> 55:58.640
flexibilities for assessments. The first is administering a shortened version

55:58.640 --> 56:02.640
of the Smarter Balanced summative assessments for ELA and math.

56:02.640 --> 56:06.640
The second one is offering remote administration, and the third is considering

56:06.640 --> 56:10.640
to extend the CASP and LPAC test administration

56:10.640 --> 56:14.640
windows beyond the test windows as outlined in our current regulations.

56:14.640 --> 56:18.640
Next slide. At the

56:18.640 --> 56:22.640
November 2020 board meeting, the SBE approved the implementation

56:22.640 --> 56:26.640
of administering a shortened version of the Smarter Balanced ELA and math

56:26.640 --> 56:30.640
assessments. We were ahead of the game. These shortened

56:30.640 --> 56:34.640
versions became available to LEAs on February 22,

56:34.640 --> 56:38.640
2021. Next slide, please.

56:38.640 --> 56:42.640
Additionally, California has made remote administrations available

56:42.640 --> 56:46.640
to California LEAs for all CASP and LPAC assessments, which we

56:46.640 --> 56:50.640
were able to field test and learn from, as I shared previously,

56:50.640 --> 56:54.640
with the LPAC initial and the optional LPAC summative.

56:54.640 --> 56:58.640
Next slide, please. So that brings us to the

56:58.640 --> 57:02.640
two possibilities we would like to discuss today regarding the extension

57:02.640 --> 57:06.640
of the testing window. What we are exploring is first

57:06.640 --> 57:10.640
to extend the window to July 30th for CASP and LPAC.

57:10.640 --> 57:14.640
Our current regulations state that an

57:14.640 --> 57:18.640
LEA must administer the assessment by their last day

57:18.640 --> 57:22.640
of instruction or July 15th, whichever comes sooner.

57:22.640 --> 57:26.640
This would, in essence, allow every LEA

57:26.640 --> 57:30.640
to extend their window to July 30th.

57:30.640 --> 57:34.640
Or, not an and, or

57:34.640 --> 57:38.640
the other potential possibility for

57:38.640 --> 57:42.640
extending the testing window would be to end the testing window

57:42.640 --> 57:46.640
per current assessment regulations, so by the last day of instruction

57:46.640 --> 57:50.640
or July 15th, whichever comes sooner, and

57:50.640 --> 57:54.640
add a new fall summative CASP and LPAC testing window

57:54.640 --> 57:58.640
that could be made available roughly around

57:58.640 --> 58:02.640
August 15th through October 29th or October 31st.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.640
Next slide, please.

58:06.640 --> 58:10.640
We'd like to share some of what we're exploring as pros

58:10.640 --> 58:14.640
and cons to each of these options regarding

58:14.640 --> 58:18.640
the window to extend the window to July 30th.

58:18.640 --> 58:22.640
This offers additional opportunities for instruction through

58:22.640 --> 58:26.640
summer extended year and expanded learning for those students that participate.

58:26.640 --> 58:30.640
It provides flexibility for schools and additional time to

58:30.640 --> 58:34.640
communicate with families and stakeholders. There would be no

58:34.640 --> 58:38.640
delay for student level results. It allows for

58:38.640 --> 58:42.640
more adults to be vaccinated, potentially increasing the opportunity for

58:42.640 --> 58:46.640
in-person assessments, and there's no added cost to

58:46.640 --> 58:50.640
extending the window from July to July 30th from 2021.

58:50.640 --> 58:54.640
Next slide.

58:54.640 --> 58:58.640
Some of the cons or the consequences that we are

58:58.640 --> 59:02.640
exploring is one, that the window extends beyond the

59:02.640 --> 59:06.640
traditional year. This is something that we've heard from many stakeholders

59:06.640 --> 59:10.640
that schools may not be able to provide students with transportation

59:10.640 --> 59:14.640
and the infrastructure to support in-person assessments in the summer,

59:14.640 --> 59:18.640
especially if they are not attending extended year or expanded learning.

59:18.640 --> 59:22.640
We've heard often high levels of COVID fatigue.

59:22.640 --> 59:26.640
People are tired. And it would also provide a delay

59:26.640 --> 59:30.640
in the aggregated reporting to LEA, state, and

59:30.640 --> 59:34.640
federal levels. There is also potential impact on

59:34.640 --> 59:38.640
CALPADS and LEA student information systems,

59:38.640 --> 59:42.640
although this would be minimal. For example,

59:42.640 --> 59:46.640
if an LEA typically ends their school year

59:46.640 --> 59:50.640
on June 15th,

59:50.640 --> 59:54.640
they would have to hold enrolling over their

59:54.640 --> 59:58.640
enrollment data to the next year until they have finished assessments.

59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.640
Their SIS would not be able to roll over their data

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.640
until July 30th. Additionally, the same

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:10.640
for CALPADS, we would have to hold enrolling over our data

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.640
until July 30th. And then once that hits, then we could roll over

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:18.640
our data, which potentially may delay our reporting

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.640
of end-of-year data. Next slide.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.640
So some pros for the

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.640
adding a fall administration window. Again, this offers additional

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.640
opportunities for instruction through summer extended year or

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.640
expanded learning. The possibility to assess students afterwards

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.640
if they partake of that opportunity.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.640
It provides flexibilities for schools and, again, additional time to communicate

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.640
with families and stakeholders. It allows significantly more

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:54.640
time for adults to be vaccinated, potentially increasing the

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.640
opportunity again for in-person assessments. Next slide.

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.640
Some of the cons for

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.640
this or the consequences for this option. There would be a

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.640
significant delay in aggregate reporting to LEA, state, and

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.640
federal levels. We would not be able to

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.640
close our CALPADS information

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.640
for fall until the assessment window is complete.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.640
It has an impact on CALPAD LEA student information

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:30.640
systems. One example of this is over the past few months, CDE

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.640
has been working to update the post process, which allows data

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.640
to be pushed into the cloud at a much faster rate. This

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.640
work would have to be postponed. Also, the standard CALPADS

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.640
data collections would be delayed, which includes course completion,

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.640
enrollment, disciplinary incidents. It would

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.640
delay our graduation report requirements and then data

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.640
used to calculate the adjusted cohort graduation rate. It would

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.640
also impact enrollment counts, FRPM,

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:06.640
special education, et cetera. Additionally,

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.640
I just want to make it clear as with many things this year,

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:14.640
we would be attempting a fall assessment window at a very large scale

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.640
rather than that has never been done before in California with very little time to

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.640
adjust. Not insurmountable, but it is a risk. As many of you

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.640
know, CALPADS is a dated system that has been stitched together

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.640
over the course of a decade to meet our ever evolving data needs,

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.640
which is fantastic and it needs an upgrade.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.640
There is uncertainty about the impact that this may have

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.640
in our system. There are lingering questions about tracking students

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.640
that transition from a grade that would also include transitioning into

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.640
another school. As an example, an eighth grader moving to ninth grade.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.640
They would in essence be moving from potentially their middle school

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.640
into a high school. They would be tested as a ninth grader

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.640
with an eighth grade assessment, but we would have to link back

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:06.640
that eighth grade assessment to their previous school.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.640
Finally, it is important to note that LEAs would have to submit and update

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.640
their student information systems with the most current data immediately

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.640
in the fall to ensure CALPADS information is correct for ETS

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:22.640
to use and contrast from the previous year's data.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.640
Typically, LEAs have until December to certify their fall one data.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.640
Again, not an insurmountable change, but it would require

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.640
a lot of technical assistance for this process.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:38.640
I think the final con to point out is that there would be an additional cost

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.640
to add a new fall administration window. Roughly estimated

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.640
it would be about close to $74 million.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:50.640
Next slide.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.640
Finally,

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:58.640
I want to just note that while ED is allowing flexibilities

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:02.640
in extending the assessment window, we have also heard from stakeholder

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.640
groups and LEAs a desire to leave the window as it is.

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:10.640
There is general expression among some to assess this year

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.640
and move forward with a clean, fresh slate in the fall.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.640
And that brings us to the testing window extension

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.640
survey of the LEA assessment coordinators that we recently conducted.

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:26.640
In February, we asked LEA superintendents and testing coordinators

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.640
to rank order their preference for testing window options, assuming

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.640
we would need to move forward with assessments. The three testing window

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.640
options included no changes to the current testing

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.640
windows, extend both the CALP and the summative LPAC testing

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:46.640
windows to July 30th, or provide an additional

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:50.640
testing window in fall for both CALP and LPAC.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.640
We also asked what benchmark assessments

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.640
they had that could be administered to all students in the same

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.640
grade level, not district-wide, but in the same grade level.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:06.640
Next slide.

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.640
As of Friday, February 19th, 2021,

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.640
and I have to just say a thank you to the field, 1200

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:18.640
people submitted out of the 2000 unique LEAs, 61 percent

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.640
in a two-day turnaround. So thank you for your participation

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.640
and being willing to provide us with this extremely important feedback.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.640
For LEAs with multiple submissions, the responses from

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.640
the LEA superintendent were included in the preliminary results.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.640
Next slide.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.640
This slide represents a summary of the rankings. Approximately

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.640
33 percent selected no change to the testing window

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:50.640
as their first choice. 21 percent selected

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.640
the July 30th extension as their first choice, and 47

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.640
selected a fall administration as their first choice.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:02.640
If you look at the weighted average, so factoring

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.640
in the combination of the first, second, and third choices,

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:10.640
or the average rank, you will see pretty

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.640
clearly that across the board it was a pretty close vote.

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:18.640
Next slide.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:22.640
24 of the 25 largest LEAs

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.640
responded to the survey. The largest LEAs include 8

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.640
of our core districts. The largest LEAs, as you can see, were evenly

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:34.640
split in their preference of testing window options. 10 selected

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.640
no change as their first choice, and 10 selected the fall

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.640
administration as their first choice. The core districts were also

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.640
evenly split with three selecting no change and three

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.640
selecting the fall administration. One core district declined to rank their first

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:54.640
choice. Next slide, please.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.640
1235

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.640
LEAs indicated that they had at least one

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.640
benchmark assessment that they could administer across grade levels

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.640
to their students. The most frequently listed benchmark assessments

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.640
available to the LEAs in order of the most mentions

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:18.640
include 559 for STAR,

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.640
337 for iReady, 304 for NWEA,

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.640
173 for Dibbles, and 131 for

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.640
Renaissance. Next slide, please.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.640
With that, I come to our recommendation. The

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.640
California Department of Education requests the California State Board of Education

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:42.640
to take action as deemed necessary and appropriate.

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:46.640
And with that, I conclude my presentation and hand it

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:50.640
back to you, President Darlene Hammond.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.640
Thank you so much. I just want to start by

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.640
thanking the staff of the Department of

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.640
Education. This is such a highly professional,

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.640
highly competent, highly committed team that has not only

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:10.640
done all the work of preparing us as

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.640
we normally do for assessments and for improvements

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:18.640
in those assessments, but this extraordinary work of surveys,

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.640
outreach to the field, outreach to the stakeholders,

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:26.640
giving us as much information as we could possibly have

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.640
to make good decisions in this moment. So just we're

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.640
deeply, deeply in your debt. We appreciate it

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:38.640
very, very, very much. I want to note

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.640
that there was a delay with posting the addendum earlier this morning.

01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:46.640
And so I want to just announce to the public that it has been posted on the SBE

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.640
website. If you went to look for it earlier and didn't find it, it is

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.640
there now. And at this point,

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.640
we want to

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.640
post the public comment slide once again

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.640
so that those who want to call in can get in a queue

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.640
to offer their comments.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.640
We can take only

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.640
clarifying questions from the board members if there are about

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.640
specific things that you need

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.640
to understand in order to take in the public comment.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.640
I want to be sure that we retain our discussion until after the public comment,

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:34.640
but are there any clarifying questions from members of the board?

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.640
I see Member Burr and

01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.640
Member Strauss with their hands up. Member Burr?

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:50.640
I just have two clarifying questions.

01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.640
When we took action in November

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.640
to shorten the smarter balance test,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.640
my recollection is that only related to the English language arts

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.640
and mathematics. And did we take any action to shorten the

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.640
science test? That's my first question. And then the second

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.640
question I think relates to something I believe Rachel talked about,

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.640
which was test turnaround time, meaning when the results are

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.640
available to LEAs. And if you could let me know

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.640
what that test turnaround time is under a shortened administration

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:30.640
construct, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.640
Sue, I'll answer your first question

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.640
that you are correct. In the November meeting

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.640
we approved an adjusted blueprint for the ELA

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.640
and math assessment. We explored

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.640
the possibility of other assessments, but they were already much shorter than the

01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.640
ELA and math, that it didn't seem

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:58.640
one, that there would be a huge need to do that, and two, a question

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.640
if we shortened it much more, how much that might compromise the validity and

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.640
reliability. So we only did an adjusted blueprint for the

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.640
ELA and math. As far as the

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.640
turnaround for assessments, I would like to hand that over

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.640
to our ETS contractor, Marianne.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.640
Marianne, would you be able to provide a little bit of information about

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:26.640
how a shortened test

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:30.640
administration may impact the data coming back?

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.640
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond,

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.640
Vice President Strauss, the team members of board, Deputy Superintendent

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.640
Gregson. My name is Marianne Arcilla, Executive Director

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:46.640
at ETS, the state's testing contractor. With

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:50.640
regard to the question, one of the things that definitely

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.640
we are very committed to

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.640
is making sure that the assessments are fair and valid

01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.640
and reliable. And so

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.640
we are, as part of the work that we're doing for the

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:10.640
spring administration, is to conduct analysis

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.640
with the data, especially the early data, as they come in to determine

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:18.640
how well the assessments are measuring

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.640
and how reliable,

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:26.640
especially as it pertains to

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.640
remote administration versus in-person administration, where we

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:34.640
can compare those. And that is information that we'll share with

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.640
the CDE as well as with Smarter Balanced and

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.640
the technical advisory group

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.640
so that we can vet to the data and then make recommendations

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.640
as to the impact of the shortened form.

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:54.640
Thank you. I have a number of hands up.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.640
I have neglected to ask our liaison, Ting Sun,

01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:02.640
if she would like to make any framing comments. Then I'll come back to

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.640
the queue of clarifying questions. And I do want to just

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:10.640
ask people to be mindful that we are asking clarifying questions

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:14.640
at this point so we don't delay getting to public comment too long.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.640
Member Sun. Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.640
So, yeah, and I want to wholeheartedly echo your words

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.640
for

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.640
Deputy Superintendent Maves and the work that Director Vang has done.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.640
The staff work has been amazing on this in a very short time and turn

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.640
around. And I also appreciate the context and background

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.640
that you, President Darling-Hammond,

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.640
and Chief Deputy Gregson, provided to provide us a context

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:50.640
for this conversation here. And, of course, we've also

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.640
received a number of public comments and letters,

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.640
many of which are asking us not to administer

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:02.640
assessments at all for this year

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.640
because of the focus and need to

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.640
focus their attention on the reopening of schools and re-engaging

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.640
our students and getting our students physically back onto campuses,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.640
which I completely understand and absolutely support.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.640
And yet I think it would be irresponsible

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:26.640
of us as a state not to have an assessment.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.640
And certainly with the federal guidelines, you know, that's

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.640
not necessarily a choice we will have. However,

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:38.640
we do need to be, look at

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:42.640
this purposefully. I mean, for one, we want to take the

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.640
we have to have assessments. You look at the example of

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.640
a middle schooler who's in seventh grade right now. The last time

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.640
we took pulse of where that student was academically at the state

01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:58.640
level was when that student was in fifth grade.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.640
So we've missed sixth grade and if we don't

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.640
out seventh grade and then if we don't test until 2022,

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.640
then the student would not be tested until eighth grade,

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.640
which means that we've missed out on the entire school

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.640
entire middle school years for that student. So I think it is

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.640
of utmost importance and it would be irresponsible for us

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.640
as a state not to get some sort of an

01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.640
assessment of pulse and data on where our students are.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:34.640
So then that leads us to how

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.640
purposeful we will be in looking at the administration.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:42.640
And for what purpose are we doing these assessments?

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.640
And as Deputy Director Mao said that

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.640
we do assessments because we want to collect data on

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.640
where our students are academically. And we

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:58.640
want to do assessment for actionable change.

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:02.640
So for me, that means

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.640
that what we want to ensure, the success,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.640
collecting data and using it for actionable change,

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:14.640
then we need to look at the timing for the most

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.640
success. And I do think that the most successes

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:22.640
will be when we would have the majority of students back onto campus

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.640
again. I know that, and for me,

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.640
I was looking at the fall and I know there's technical

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.640
difficulties and also a huge expense. But I will say

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.640
I'm also very encouraged by the number of reopening plans that

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:42.640
we're seeing across the state. And if we are able to get

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.640
a vast majority of our students back on campuses

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:50.640
in the spring, then I think a spring administration

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.640
may be feasible and ensure the success of both collection

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.640
of data and to be able for us to assess actionable

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.640
change. My biggest concern is for the students who have

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.640
dropped out of our system during this time of distance learning. Our

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:10.640
English language students, our immigrant students, our special

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.640
education students, those are the ones who have suffered the most through

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:18.640
this distance learning time. And for us to be able to collect

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.640
data for actionable change for those students most at

01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.640
risk, we want to administer at a time where we can

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.640
best collect the data from these students. And if they're not in the

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:34.640
system for us to even test, then I don't think we'll

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.640
be successful. So thank you for that time allowing

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:42.640
my comments. Thank you. I'm going to move now to

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.640
Member Strauss, then Member Rodriguez, and

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:50.640
Member Mnavo, Member Glover Woods,

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:54.640
and again keep these two clarifying questions.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.640
Thank you, Member Strauss. I have a couple of clarifying questions

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.640
and I have three. So the first is

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640
to be clear that if we were to go and recommend

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:10.640
a fall administration and the cost at

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.640
$74 million, I just want to clarify, I believe that would take legislative and

01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:18.640
governor approval for budget allocation. I just want to clarify that. The second

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.640
thing is I believe that there's a

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.640
recommendation that LPAC be done in person. I just want to

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.640
clarify that recommendation for English learners to get the best valid

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.640
results because that would affect what we do with the testing window

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.640
or whether we look at a second administration for them.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:42.640
And then the third one is all the

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.640
flexibilities I believe that Mao and Rachel presented

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.640
are there other flexibilities? I believe the federal

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.640
guidance says that you can explore

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.640
additional flexibilities based on the context of your state.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.640
And I think we're obviously a huge state, very diverse.

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640
Majority are still remote a year later

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:10.640
in contrast to smaller states that may have opened or don't have

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:14.640
the kind of COVID spread that we've had. So just the

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:18.640
clarification of the $74 million, the LPAC in person, and the additional

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:22.640
flexibilities the federal government's allowing under their guidance.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.640
I think those are all coming to you, Rachel and Mao.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640
We're ready, thank you.

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.640
So for the first one regarding the

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.640
fall administration and the $74 million and your question about

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.640
approval from the state. And I apologize, I should have made that clear

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:46.640
at the very beginning. What we are bringing forward to you

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.640
today would relieve our federal requirements. It's not just the $74

01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:54.640
million, it would be everything that we bring before you that would also have

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.640
to be approved through a legislative vote or an executive order.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:02.640
Because we also have our own state accountability and assessment requirements.

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.640
So pending the board's decision here, whatever you

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:10.640
vote to move forward and approve, it would waive the federal requirements

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.640
and then we would move forward with presenting this to the legislature or

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:18.640
the governor's office and then they would decide to either vote or provide an

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.640
executive order to continue the decoupling.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.640
To the second question, the LPAC recommended in person.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:30.640
I think from the very beginning we have been very clear

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.640
on all the assessments. First and foremost, if you can

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.640
safely, it should be done in person

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.640
for all of the assessments. And if for some reason you're unable

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.640
to do that, we've provided an additional option and that stands for the LPAC

01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:50.640
in all assessments. The only one that we would say you absolutely

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:54.640
cannot assess remotely is our alternate assessments.

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.640
In part because the alternate assessments require within our regulations

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.640
that only a test coordinator be the, or

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.640
a test administrator be the one to provide support with the administration

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.640
of the test, that often requires manipulatives and other tools outside

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.640
of just the assessment. Parents cannot do that at home.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.640
So that one is the only one we were unable to provide a flexible option for.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:22.640
To your third question, Eileen,

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:26.640
regarding additional flexibilities, yes,

01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:30.640
the letter did outline and the state board may direct the CDE

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:34.640
and or the executive director of the state board to

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.640
explore additional options as needed based on our

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.640
state's context.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.640
All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.640
Let's see. Member Rodriguez, you are up next. Thank you.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.640
And thank you so much for the amazing, thorough presentation and all of the

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.640
work that you've, the thoughtful work that you've put into this.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.640
So you answered one of my questions. Thank you, Member Strauss.

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.640
And the other is, I teach at a high school,

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.640
and so I was just wondering if

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:14.640
we went with a fall assessment, would the,

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.640
it's the 11th graders who take the CASP, 10th graders who take science,

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:22.640
would the seniors this year's

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:26.640
11th graders take the CASP and would

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.640
they be juniors taking science, if you could just clarify that?

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.640
Yes, that would be correct. And that would be correct for

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:38.640
all students. As they come into their, the grade

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:42.640
at which they are in in the fall, they would take the assessment for their previous

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:46.640
grade.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.640
All right. Then I guess we'll go to, is that,

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.640
did you get everything answered that you wanted to, Member Rodriguez? Yes, thank you so much.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.640
Member Navo? Just want to echo

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.640
my fellow board members in commending the department on your

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.640
preparation and the information you shared, Mal and Rachel, very impressive

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:14.640
and thank you. Were the, when you did the surveys with

01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:18.640
the field and they had the choices

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.640
that were in front of them, my question is, were

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.640
they also shared the pros and cons of those potential

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:30.640
choices? So did they understand that by asking for an extension of a fall,

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.640
which seems to be much more complicated and much more expensive,

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.640
were they aware of that?

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:42.640
That's a great question, Member Navo.

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.640
No, we did not outline that in the survey, the, what the

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:50.640
repercussions of that potentially might be. We have shared in some of our stakeholder

01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:54.640
meetings some of the pros and cons, but it was not outlined in the survey.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.640
And it is extensive and complicated.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:02.640
I'm not sure you would have been able to give all of the detail adequately.

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.640
Thank you. Member Glover Woods?

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:10.640
Good morning and again I echo

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:14.640
comments from my fellow board members on just the extensive preparation

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.640
for today's presentation as well as all of the work that has been done

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:22.640
to communicate and work with the field on this very

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:26.640
important topic. My question for clarification

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.640
is in relation to the impact on CalPADS and

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:34.640
the student information system. I just wanted to

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.640
get clarification regarding the impact

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.640
of extending the administration window

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.640
or adding a fall administration.

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.640
Is the impact to CalPADS and student

01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.640
information the same?

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:58.640
So I am going

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.640
to defer this question to

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.640
Jerry Winkler, our Director for the Education

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.640
Data Management Division, just to make sure that

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.640
I don't miss something. Jerry, are you available to answer that question?

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:18.640
Yes, and thank you for that question.

01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:22.640
We believe that the impact of CalPADS

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:26.640
for the July extension would be far less than the

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:30.640
impact for the fall administration. Far less.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:34.640
Yeah.

01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:38.640
If I could add a point of color, I think in one conversation we had with

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:42.640
staff, there was a potential crash and burn metaphor

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.640
that was put forward as a fear for moving to

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:50.640
the data system if we move to the fall.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.640
So I appreciate getting the

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.640
data on that. Member Rodriguez, your hand is

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:02.640
still up, but I'm assuming maybe it's just left up by mistake. Okay, great.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.640
I have just one more clarifying question before we

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.640
move to public comment, and

01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:14.640
I think that what we may want to do, by the way, is just take a five-minute

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.640
bio break for getting a cup of coffee and getting back

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.640
before we hear public comment so we don't have to disrupt the commenting.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.640
But I did want to ask about the possibilities

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.640
as we're looking at all the ways in which we can make testing more feasible,

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:34.640
shorten the extent of the assessments, etc.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.640
I understand from

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.640
the folks at the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium that there is

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:46.640
consideration being given to allowing

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.640
a way to move performance tasks out of the

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:54.640
very long sit-down test into classroom administration.

01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:58.640
And I just want to ask whether that's a possible

01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:02.640
option we might be able to provide to school districts

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.640
that were interested in that way of managing

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:10.640
the assessments.

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.640
Thank you for that question, Linda. I'll hand that over and invite

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:20.640
Tony Alpert, the executive director of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium,

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:24.640
to provide you an answer to that question.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.640
Tony, would you like to join?

01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.640
Hi, Tony. Hello. And for the record,

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.640
my name is Tony Alpert, executive director for Smarter Balanced.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:40.640
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, for the question. Yes, we are

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.640
interested in investigating that option and

01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.640
looking for opportunities for innovation

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.640
and to collaborate with the Department of Education and with

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.640
the State Board on how to make the logistics of the

01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.640
assessment easier and opportunities to find ways to

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.640
enhance the validity. Thank you. I also

01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:08.640
just want to note, since we have you on the camera for a moment, how much we appreciate

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:12.640
the ways in which the Smarter Balanced Consortium has been so responsive

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.640
to looking at ways to shorten the test, to find remote

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.640
testing options where they can work, and to helping

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.640
everyone both do the best job we can and to do it in the most

01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.640
efficient way possible. So lots of work has gone on there

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:32.640
as well. We appreciate it. President Darling-Hammond, could I

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.640
just really quickly go back to Member Navo's question

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.640
regarding whether or not districts or LEAs

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:44.640
understood the different impacts

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:48.640
of the options. We didn't provide it with the summary, but I did

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.640
also, and I didn't want to fail to note this, we were able to meet

01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.640
with about ten districts and their

01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:00.640
assessment coordinators, CALPADS coordinators, and

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:04.640
representatives from the curriculum and instruction side of the House last Friday

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:08.640
and went over all of these with them as well, and they provided pretty significant and

01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:12.640
I think helpful feedback for the discussion today. So I just wanted to acknowledge

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:16.640
the feedback that they provided and the time that they were able to spend with us

01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:20.640
in sharing some of their thoughts as well. Terrific. Thank you.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.640
Lots of people in the boat rowing together to try to get to solutions to these naughty

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.640
problems, and we really do appreciate it. I want to give us a five-minute

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.640
bio break because we're going to have quite extensive public comment, I believe.

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.640
So it is 10.01, and at 10.06, if you could

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.640
try to be back, grab a cup of coffee and be comfortable. We'll see

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.640
you then. Turn off your video and

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:48.640
microphone, but do not leave the room. Alright? Thank you.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.640
Welcome back.

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.640
Thank you.

01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.640
Thank you for the break.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.640
Yeah, I know, I think we were all feeling

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:10.640
a momentary need. I don't want to miss any of the public comments, so

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.640
we will be able to

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.640
hopefully all be there for all of that.

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.640
If you do need to take a break

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.640
later, just send a note in the chat

01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:30.640
that you're going to be right back and turn off your camera.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:34.640
And microphone if you need a couple of minutes for any kind of a break.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.640
We're going to try to forge ahead now.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.640
We're scheduled to try to complete by noon.

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.640
I'm going to ask

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:50.640
Brooks to please call the

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.640
roll and reestablish the quorum.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:58.640
Okay. Member Burr. Here.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.640
President Darlene Hammond. Here. Member Fatah.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.640
Here. Member Glover Woods. Here.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:10.640
Member McQuillan. Here. Member

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:14.640
Navo. Here. Member Patil Brownson.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:18.640
Here. Member Rodriguez.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.640
Here. Member Rucker.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:26.640
Vice President Strauss.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:30.640
Here. Member Son. Here.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.640
We have a quorum. Alright, thank you very much.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.640
At this point, I think we are going to open the phone line for public

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.640
comments. Are there any public comments?

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:46.640
Yes, we do have currently 40

01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:50.640
people in public comment. Callers, good

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.640
morning. This is for item number two.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:58.640
First caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:02.640
time starts now.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:06.640
Good morning. I'm Deb Cuban, Superintendent for Ukiah Unified

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.640
School District located in rural Northern California. I'm excited

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:14.640
to share that Ukiah Unified just reopened to in-person instruction last week

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:18.640
for preschool through grade 12 after 11 long months of distance

01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.640
learning. Instructional minutes in person with students are

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.640
coveted and limited. It has been challenging to keep students connected

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.640
with school and excited about learning during distance learning.

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.640
Now that we are seeing students back on campus, we must preserve

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.640
our in-person time with them to help re-engage them with school

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:42.640
and with each other. Time spent assessing students beyond a

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:46.640
district's interim assessments will only add to the learning loss

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.640
they have experienced and the social-emotional toll this pandemic

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.640
has taken. We must prioritize our in-person time with our students

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:58.640
to address their needs. Statewide testing will take many hours of instruction

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.640
away from our students who have already lost so much during this pandemic.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.640
I respectfully urge the State Board of Education to pursue a blanket

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.640
waiver for standardized testing for the 2021 school year. Thank you so much.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:14.640
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and

01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.640
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:22.640
Good morning. My name is Katherine Strzok

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.640
and I am the data and assessment coordinator for the Memo Park City School District.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.640
I would like to advocate that California pursues a waiver to suspend

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:34.640
state testing for the 2020-2021 school year.

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.640
We have a solid benchmark assessment system in place at

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.640
every grade level and we've been administering them each trimester to identify

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.640
student instructional needs, plan instruction and intervention,

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:50.640
as well as report out to our community the impact that the pandemic

01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:54.640
and distance hybrid instruction has had on student learning.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:58.640
Our schools have been open with in-person hybrid instruction

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:02.640
since September with in-person instruction every other week

01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:06.640
and at home asynchronous learning the alternating weeks.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.640
While we value the data provided by state assessments, we are very aware

01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:14.640
of the limited and precious in-person instructional time we have with

01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:18.640
our students. We're concerned about the amount of time and energy to both

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.640
prepare teachers and students as well as administer the CASP assessment this

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.640
spring. Time. Students. Thank you,

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.640
caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:40.640
Good morning Board President, Dr.

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:44.640
Am I live? Yes, you're live. I apologize. Please

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:48.640
go ahead. I'm so sorry. Good morning Board President,

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.640
Dr. Darlene Hammond, Board Members and Superintendent Thurman. My name is

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:56.640
Dr. Gina Potter and I'm the Superintendent for the San Ysidro School District

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.640
and the Chair of Access Legislative Policy Committee. I respectfully

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:04.640
urge the State Board to pursue a blanket waiver for standardized

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.640
tests. Given the vast majority of schools in California are providing

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.640
distance learning, there are significant challenges with online standardized

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.640
testing such as lack of equitable student access

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.640
to the internet and computers, lack of home technology support to

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.640
students, lack of in-person teacher supervision to proctor the exam

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:28.640
and issues with the academic integrity of the exam.

01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:32.640
As an educational leader, I support the importance of standardized

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:36.640
assessments. However, the pandemic has caused significant trauma

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:40.640
for students, families and staff. Testing during this crisis

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.640
will exacerbate the fragile balance California is

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:48.640
seeking to prioritize the safe reopening of schools.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:52.640
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.640
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:00.640
Good morning President Darlene Hammond

01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:04.640
and members. Eric Cremack on behalf of Charter Schools Development Center

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:08.640
and our hundreds of charter school members. We're generally supportive of granting

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.640
flexibility here and we appreciate the efforts of CDE staff and the contractors

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:16.640
to address the many logistical and practical issues, but we're

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:20.640
also deeply concerned about the lack of information or even discussion

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:24.640
as to the impact of these changes on the high stakes new renewal laws

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.640
that govern charter schools. We believe that these issues

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.640
need to be addressed concurrently and immediately.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:36.640
Not only with respect to the CAST test, but also with regard to the

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:40.640
list of 11-odd alternative assessments that you approved

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:44.640
earlier this year, as well as the impact on any delay

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.640
and implementation of the federal intervention laws on charter

01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.640
renewal. And we hope that you will address all of those so that we can all avoid

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.640
a tidal wave of hotly contested appeals coming your way.

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.640
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state

01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:04.640
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.640
Good morning President Darlene Hammond and members of the board. My name is Dave Dabrowski and I'm the

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.640
Assistant Superintendent of Education Services in Harupa Unified School District

01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.640
in Riverside County. I'm calling to urge you to continue forward in the process of pursuing

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:24.640
a waiver for standardized testing requirements for this year. We remain

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:28.640
purple tier today and in my district like most others in my county we're engaged in remote

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:32.640
instruction. The administration of the testing is problematic and will only serve

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:36.640
to exacerbate the inequities highlighted during the pandemic. Our students

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.640
come from a wide variety of backgrounds and many will experience a difficult at best

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:44.640
testing environment and as such the data we receive is going to be inaccurate.

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.640
Our focus really needs to be on diagnostic and formative assessments that will serve our

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:52.640
teachers in determining the best path forward for student success as we move towards

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.640
reopening schools. Not on a remotely administered high-stakes test that will take

01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.640
instructional time and focus away from the important work ahead regardless of whether that

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:04.640
happens in spring, summer or fall. Thank you.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.640
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:12.640
the record. Your time starts now.

01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.640
Yes. Good morning President Darlene Hammond and fellow board members.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.640
My name is Rico Tamayo and I'm President of the Early Childhood TK-12

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:24.640
Council for CFT and I'm here representing 85,000

01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:28.640
CFT members. Now that the U.S. Department of Ed's released a letter allowing

01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:32.640
waiver flexibilities we ask that you consider submitting a wide

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:36.640
waiver to allow our focus to be on safe schools and much needed

01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:40.640
mental and emotional health for our students. At this time summative assessments

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.640
will not provide any useful information from our students especially

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:48.640
when schools are dealing with different rates of COVID and we're seeing

01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:52.640
high COVID rates correlated with the same economic and social

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:56.640
disadvantages that our tests always show. We do recommend however

01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.640
that you allow LEAs to be able to utilize local assessments

01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:04.640
instead of state summative assessments and furthermore we ask the board

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.640
to obtain a waiver for the 2021 school year and not extend

01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:12.640
testing to the fall. Thank you for your consideration.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.640
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:20.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.640
Hello, good morning. My name is

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.640
Daryl Camp and I'm the Superintendent of the San Lorenzo Unified School

01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:32.640
District. On behalf of our board I share with you a resolution that

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.640
was passed last Saturday opposing state standardized testing

01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.640
for the 2021 school year and we

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:44.640
request a blanket waiver as it pertains to all statewide testing.

01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.640
The reasons are simple for us. When we

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:52.640
did our assessments the cons of testing far outweighed

01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:56.640
the pros of testing. Once again the board had a lot

01:39:56.640 --> 01:40:00.640
of questions about the utility and the validity associated with testing

01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:04.640
and had extreme concerns about the anxiety that's placed on our

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:08.640
students and staff during this COVID-19 time.

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.640
Once again we thank you for your time and effort and thank you again President

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:16.640
Darlyn Hammond and members of the State Board of Education Superintendent Thurmond.

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:20.640
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next caller, please state

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:24.640
your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.640
Caller, you're live. Can you hear me?

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.640
Next caller, please state your name

01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:42.640
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:50.640
Good morning President Darlyn Hammond and board members. My name is Enrique

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:54.640
Rocha and I'm representing the San Diego Unified School District

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:58.640
and I would just, I'm calling to ask for a waiver

01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:02.640
to suspend testing for the 2021 school year for all assessments

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.640
and that would include the summit of LPAC. Thank you.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:10.640
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.640
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:20.640
Good morning Board of Education. My name is Mercedes Leveon

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.640
and I'm the Associate Superintendent of Educational Support Services for Oceanside

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:28.640
Unified School District. We serve over 16,500

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.640
students including military connected students. We urge you

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.640
to focus on a blanket waiver for standardized testing.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.640
We are eager to return to in-person instruction and we'll be doing

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.640
so on the 15th of March due to the California Department of Public Health

01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:48.640
guidance for physical distancing. Our students will have limited time with their teachers

01:41:48.640 --> 01:41:52.640
and we would want that time to be focused on building their connections

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.640
and addressing the trauma that they've already experienced during this pandemic rather

01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.640
than on standardized testing. We have a robust local

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.640
assessment system that we will continue to use and monitor so that we can

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:08.640
provide targeted services for our students. Thank you.

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:12.640
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for

01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:16.640
the record. Your time starts now.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:20.640
Good morning. My name is Katie Sommer, Assistant Superintendent

01:42:20.640 --> 01:42:24.640
for Ukiah Unified School District. In our rural areas we

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:28.640
struggle with technology issues that will extend the time CASP

01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:32.640
assessments will take and will deem many of the results unusable due to

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.640
time limit requirements. These challenges include internet access

01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:40.640
as many of our students have hot spots that are not always stable in rural

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.640
areas. In addition, the new system requirements for CASP have

01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:48.640
made many of our Chromebooks unusable for these assessments.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.640
This too creates logistical challenges that will extend the time it is going

01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:56.640
to take for the CASP assessments. The training of staff to be able

01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:00.640
to give the assessments in person and remotely will take up precious time

01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:04.640
instead of focusing on improving instruction and reopening

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.640
secondary schools. It will also take additional instructional time

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:12.640
to train students on the platform, especially for students who will be taking it remotely.

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.640
We only have 12 weeks left of school

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.640
to focus on instruction and we have our own district-wide

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.640
interim assessments in ELA and math that can be used to address and

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:28.640
finish learning. Thus, I respectfully urge the State Board of Education

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.640
to pursue a blanket waiver for standardized testing. Thank you for

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.640
your time. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:40.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:48.640
Good morning, State Board members.

01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:52.640
My name is Marcos Aguilar and I'm a member of the Indigenous Resurgence Education

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.640
Network across the country and here locally in the co-head of school at

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.640
Anahuacamecuk World School, the county of Los Angeles' only community-based

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:04.640
Indigenous Peoples K-12 school. I urge that the State Board of Education

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.640
Superintendent of Instruction in California pursue a blanket waiver of all

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.640
federal mandates for student testing in 2021 as well as the waiving of

01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:16.640
additional state mandates. Our students, staff, and parents have maintained

01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:20.640
a committed and disciplined approach to living through this pandemic and maintaining

01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:24.640
a strong learning community through online platforms that we've had

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.640
through great difficulty negotiated and presented with our community.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:32.640
But adding state testing does not help us get back to school.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:36.640
The irreconcilable problems abound with high-stake standardized testing in general,

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.640
particularly regarding validity, reliability, fairness, and bias,

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.640
and with the way these tools are used against schools like ours

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:48.640
as a charter school. These and other inequities have been exacerbated

01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:52.640
during the pandemic. The state should determine instead how historic rates

01:44:52.640 --> 01:44:56.640
of high rates of child hunger, housing insecurity, and a lack of

01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:00.640
access. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:04.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.640
Hello?

01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:12.640
Yes, caller. You may proceed.

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:16.640
Hello? Yes, caller. Can you

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:20.640
hear me? Hello?

01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.640
starts now.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:32.640
Good morning, board members.

01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:36.640
I'm Carlos Machado with the California School Boards Association.

01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.640
CSBA supports seeking a waiver of standardized testing requirements

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.640
this year. We appreciate the department's outreach efforts to stakeholders

01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:48.640
to identify modifications in an effort to address concerns outlined in the presentation.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:52.640
However, the waiver represents the best option

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.640
to help reduce the significant burdens that the assessments will place on

01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.640
students, their families, and on teachers as districts and schools focus on reopening

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.640
and accelerating learning opportunities. For this reason,

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:08.640
we ask the board to pursue the blanket waiver option afforded by the Department of Education.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:12.640
Thank you. Thank you, caller.

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:16.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:20.640
now.

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.640
Good morning, Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.640
Diana Vu representing the Association of California School Administrators

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.640
respectfully requesting the State Board of Education pursue a blanket waiver for

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.640
standardized testing. Even without statewide assessments, our districts can and will

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:40.640
use other tools that are available to gauge student learning

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.640
and needs. We believe that it is paramount that we prioritize students right now and use this

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.640
valuable time to accelerate learning and support students and staff, social, emotional,

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:52.640
and mental health. Thank you. Thank you, caller.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:56.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

01:46:56.640 --> 01:47:00.640
now.

01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:04.640
Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:08.640
to comment. I'm Viviana Musting, California Policy Analyst at

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:12.640
the U.S., previously known as the National Council of La Raza, where the nation's

01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:16.640
largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization. And we strongly

01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:20.640
believe that administering annual assessments for the 2020-2021

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:24.640
academic year, ideally in spring, is critical to have

01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:28.640
a more accurate read on where Latino and English learner students

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:32.640
stand on their path to success. And in light of the U.S. Department of

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.640
Education, dear colleague, writer on assessments,

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.640
we recommend that the Board, one,

01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:44.640
provide LEAs the necessary flexibilities needed to safely

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.640
administer annual assessments, two, ensure appropriate accommodations are offered

01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.640
for students with disabilities and English learners as required under federal law

01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.640
for statewide assessments, three, exercise transparency in reporting

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.640
data on student learning for parents, educators, and the public, and lastly,

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:04.640
use assessments to inform systemic decisions from an equity lens,

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.640
including how the state will charge your resources and investments to support

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.640
students of the greatest needs. Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:16.640
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:20.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.640
Hello. Good morning, State Board and

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:28.640
community that are online today. My name is Tracy Noriega, Assistant

01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.640
Superintendent of Educational Services serving the students of San Lorenzo

01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.640
Unified School District with Superintendent Dr. Daryl Camp, who spoke earlier.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:40.640
We are in Alameda County, which is still in the purple tier, and our district

01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:44.640
is still in distance learning. Last Saturday, February 21st, our amazing

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.640
Board trustees passed Resolution No. 3682, opposing state

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:52.640
standardized testing. I pulled out two lines to read for all of you.

01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:56.640
Whereas the process of remote testing from student homes will most likely

01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:00.640
increase the current heightened levels of anxiety that both students and parents

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:04.640
and guardians will have to experience. Whereas SLZUSD is committed

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:08.640
to supporting the social emotional well-being of our students and believes

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.640
actions need to be taken to mitigate any negative impact of state testing.

01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:16.640
With that, we are requesting the state pass a blanket waiver for standardized

01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:20.640
tests. I hope as a state we can be committed to supporting our students' social

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:24.640
emotional well-being as well. Thank you for your time and consideration.

01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:28.640
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:36.640
Hi, I'm Jennifer Hicks, Assistant Superintendent

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.640
of Educational Services at Foster County Office of Education

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.640
and the 2021 SIS Chair. I'm sharing these comments on behalf

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:48.640
of SIS and CSESA. While we're thankful that the recent letter

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:52.640
from the U.S. Department of Ed provides waiver options for accountability, this does

01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:56.640
not provide the relief that schools and parents need. The flexibilities

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.640
offered for consideration are limiting and will negatively impact

01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.640
critical, valuable instructional and learning time, whether it's the spring

01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:08.640
or later in the fall. The data we will receive will not be

01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:12.640
useful nor timely to inform learning acceleration plans. Instead,

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:16.640
local formative assessment plans are far more critical in terms of quickly

01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:20.640
assessing student progress, identifying needs, and addressing inequities.

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:24.640
We ask that the Board first request an accountability waiver and

01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:28.640
second, actively explore and pursue the maximum additional flexibilities

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:32.640
including a blanket waiver based on our state-specific circumstances

01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.640
and individual needs. We would welcome the opportunity to be

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:40.640
part of this conversation about what this might look like. Thank you.

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:44.640
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.640
record. Your time starts now.

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.640
Hi, this is Stacey Stansberry. Good morning. I'm the Director of Curriculum and

01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:56.640
Instruction for the Taft Union High School District. I would like the Board to consider

01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.640
the detriment versus benefit for our students' perspective and apply

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:04.640
for the blanket waiver for standardized tests. Our students test once in high school

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:08.640
and these test scores will follow them to college. This year we're asking the students

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.640
to test in a different environment and many will need to test remotely due to pandemic

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.640
health concerns and our county being in deep purple tier. This means that some of our

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.640
students will be trying to use hot spots in rural areas or find a quiet location in a home

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:24.640
with young siblings and family interruptions outside of anyone's control.

01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:28.640
This along with the intimidation of being on camera while testing and having to work through

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:32.640
technical issues remotely is less than an ideal setting for our students to accurately

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:36.640
show us what they have learned. This standardized test will not be standardized due to the numerous

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:40.640
variables during testing. Testing data and trend comparisons from this year will not

01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.640
be accurate or usable by the school or state. While our students have been resilient,

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:48.640
flexible and flexible, please consider the mental health and stress the students have

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:52.640
experienced during testing. And what they have been through this year, testing in this way

01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.640
or when we first return to school in the fall is not in the best interest of our students

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:00.640
and is one more thing that they will have to endure this year. Thank you for your time.

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:08.640
Your time starts now.

01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:12.640
My name is Bill Lucia of Ed Voice.

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:16.640
Ed Voice supports moving forward with the Uniform Statewide

01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:20.640
shortened assessments with extra testing time, extended testing

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:24.640
window to July or August at the latest and flexibility on participation

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.640
rates so focus can be on logistics and turning around results as soon as possible.

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.640
Waiting to the fall means getting results late, fall or winter.

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:36.640
Such a delay from time of instruction is inconsistent with generally

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.640
accepted assessment practice and delays needed extra help for students.

01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:44.640
With an eye on equity of opportunity, it's important to have comparable data on learning

01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:48.640
loss and achievement gaps amplified by the pandemic is impracticable.

01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.640
This data is needed to best invest in students with accelerated learning opportunities

01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.640
this summer and immediately in the next school year. Thank you.

01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:00.640
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:04.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:08.640
Good morning. My name is Michael Jubba

01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:12.640
speaking on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:16.640
CTA believes that the SBE should look back at the last time the

01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:20.640
USDOE provided guidance on assessment waivers that did not make

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.640
sense for California. In 2013, Dr. Kirst,

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:28.640
Superintendent Torlakson and Governor Brown pushed back on the USDOE

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.640
and ultimately made the right decision for the students,

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:36.640
parents and educators of California. Over 46,000

01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:40.640
teachers have signed our petition to waive state tests.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:44.640
CTA believes that the concerns outlined in our letter

01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:48.640
regarding the feasibility of administration, the usability of the data

01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.640
and the cruelty of putting our students, families and educators through a

01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:56.640
high-stake summative assessment make the choice clear and

01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:00.640
appropriate. In closing, the SBE should aggressively

01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:04.640
pursue a blanket assessment waiver for the 2020-2021

01:54:04.640 --> 01:54:08.640
school year. Thank you.

01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:12.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

Your time starts now.

01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:24.640
Hi, my name is Jeff Frost. I'm representing

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.640
the Long Beach Unified School District, San Jose Unified

01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.640
School District, the Central Valley Education Coalition

01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:36.640
and all of the superintendents in Orange County.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:40.640
I am contacting you regarding

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.640
the blanket waiver and to

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:48.640
urge you to consider that as the most

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.640
reasonable option given the level of stress

01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.640
and lack of accommodations for special ed and

01:54:56.640 --> 01:55:00.640
EL students in a remote environment for testing.

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:04.640
Thank you very much. Thank you caller. Next

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.640
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:12.640
starts now.

01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:16.640
Hi, my name is Joanna French and I'm Senior Manager

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.640
of Research and Policy at Innovate Public Schools. We work with over a thousand

01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:24.640
parents statewide who are low-income parents of color, parents of English learners

01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:28.640
and parents of students with special needs. The most important thing we can do for our students

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:32.640
right now is to understand student progress and the extent of learning loss

01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.640
so we can target resources to those students who need them most. We believe

01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.640
we need spring assessments in order to do this even if the window is extended

01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:44.640
to July 30th. Given the survey presented this morning

01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.640
that showed alliés across the state are split evenly in ranking the three

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:52.640
options and the Ed Trust West poll that 55% of parents are

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:56.640
in favor of resuming assessments this spring, we recommend the State Board

01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:00.640
of Education vote to move forward with the spring assessments rather than waiting.

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:04.640
Thank you. Thank you caller. Next

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:08.640
caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:12.640
now.

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.640
Good morning President Darling-Hammond and members of the State Board. My name is Holly Eads

01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:20.640
and I'm the Superintendent of the Orchid Union School District which is located in Santa Barbara County.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:24.640
I'm calling you today to urge the State Board to pursue a blanket assessment

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.640
waiver for standardized tests from the U.S. Department of Education for this school year.

01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:32.640
The social-emotional effect of the pandemic is devastating for a number of our

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.640
students. We remain concerned that requiring them to perform on a standardized

01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:40.640
test will place unnecessary stress on students when our primary concern

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.640
is for their safety including their mental health. As a district

01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.640
we rely heavily on data to guide our instruction and to inform our practice.

01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:52.640
Data is only as good as its validity and reliability, neither of which

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:56.640
can be assured when you have students participating in a variety of settings and variables

01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.640
we cannot control. The fact is students in distance learning will not have the

01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:04.640
same level of support as students that are in person. We have local measures

01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:08.640
we continue to rely on to monitor student performance. Many of these are criterion and

01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:12.640
norm referenced assessments such as NWEA, Acadian or Dibbles and

01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.640
the PSAP. Thank you for your time in doing what's right for the 6.3 million

01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.640
students in California. Thank you caller. Next caller,

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:24.640
please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:28.640
now.

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:36.640
Caller.

01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:40.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your

01:57:40.640 --> 01:57:44.640
time starts now.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:48.640
Good morning President Darling-Hammond and board members.

01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:52.640
This is Liz Guillen with Public Advocates. If the

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.640
past spring administration is waived, the federal waiver request

01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.640
itself should condition the waiver on LEAs

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.640
administering a diagnostic assessment of some kind in the spring.

01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:08.640
This has to provide information about students learning their status

01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:12.640
and needs. These assessments should be publicly available

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:16.640
by site and LEA and they should be actionable for decisions

01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:20.640
about services and resource allocations for

01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:24.640
extended learning in the summer and for the LCAP

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:28.640
for 2021 and 22. LEAs should also

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:32.640
be required to use their local data to identify particular

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:36.640
student groups whose needs they should focus on in extended learning

01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:40.640
and LCAP. For example, kindergarten and first grade

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:44.640
students who did not enroll in TK or kindergarten for 2020 and

01:58:44.640 --> 01:58:48.640
21. Students who either received either Fs or incompletes

01:58:48.640 --> 01:58:52.640
or no past grades. Lastly,

01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:56.640
all right, thank you.

01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.640
Caller, you're live. Next caller, please state your name

01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:16.640
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:22.640
Caller, you're live.

01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:26.640
Can you hear me?

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:30.640
Good morning, I'm Cheryl Jordan, Superintendent of

01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:34.640
Milpitas Unified representing the Santa Clara County Superintendents Association.

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:38.640
Santa Clara County has persistently been in the purple tier

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:42.640
for COVID-19 and currently only 15% of our districts

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:46.640
have some grade levels on campus for in-person learning. While the

01:59:46.640 --> 01:59:50.640
majority of our districts are providing in-person learning support, it is not

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:54.640
enough to assure equitable access to testing conditions for students.

01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:58.640
The CDE team has worked diligently to provide a shortened testing system

01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.640
with suggestions for in-person and online testing.

02:00:02.640 --> 02:00:06.640
The requirements for students to have cameras on with speakers is one example

02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:10.640
for equitable testing environments. However, we have parents who will not allow their

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:14.640
children to be watched by a camera and will opt out. In California,

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:18.640
there is a backlog of digital devices on order that have needed requirements

02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:22.640
for the secure testing browser. MUSD is one example.

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.640
We have had 2,500 Chromebooks on order since the fall and only

02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:30.640
have received 158. We urge you to request

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:34.640
a blanket waiver for standardized testing in California.

02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:38.640
The investment of time and resources is better spent redesigning

02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:42.640
our education system.

02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:46.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:50.640
Your time starts now.

02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:54.640
Good morning. Sarah Batches with the California Association of Schools

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:58.640
Association of School Business Officials. We requested the State

02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:02.640
Board and CDE pursue the waiver for the required

02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.640
administration of the state standardized testing for the 2020-21 school year.

02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.640
Our organization is committed to supporting our students and staff and so we're

02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:14.640
eager to bring them back and focus on what we need to do to ensure their safety.

02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:18.640
And as we continue to navigate the merit of considerations and decisions

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:22.640
that go into this work, we must reiterate the importance of prioritizing instructional

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:26.640
time. Thank you so much. Thank you, caller.

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:34.640
starts now.

02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:38.640
Good morning. My name is Brian Hoppe, Director of Instructional

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:42.640
Support representing Rural and Unified School District. I respectfully

02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.640
urge a blanket waiver for standardized testing this year.

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.640
The CDE says the purpose of CASP is to promote high quality teaching and learning

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:54.640
through the use of a variety of assessment approaches.

02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:58.640
The test administration in this environment will face uneven application.

02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.640
The data will not be reliable and our stakeholders will not trust the data.

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:06.640
Without trust, what is the purpose of this data?

02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.640
The CDE's presentation said it would be irresponsible to not test at this time

02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:14.640
because we need a state level pulse on students.

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:18.640
This assumes LEAs are not already collecting and using local, formative,

02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:22.640
actionable data. We continue to use local benchmarks

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:26.640
and formative assessments to guide instruction, form summer

02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:30.640
learning opportunities, and provide small group intervention.

02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:34.640
A state standardized assessment with significant challenges to validity

02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:38.640
and reliability would not provide this kind of information to LEAs and

02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:42.640
parents, much less an accurate statewide snapshot of student progress.

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.640
We request the CDE to allow us to focus on what is

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.640
most important.

02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:02:54.640 --> 02:02:58.640
Hello, this is Robert

02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:02.640
Manwearing from Children Now. We co-authored with

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:06.640
colleagues in the equity community, the school reform community, parent groups

02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.640
and business groups a letter that would oppose a

02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:14.640
blanket waiver. We believe that now is an important time

02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:18.640
especially given the lack of testing last spring for parents to know

02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.640
how their students are doing relative to other students in the state.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:26.640
While many districts do administer other

02:03:26.640 --> 02:03:30.640
interim assessments, those results are rarely shared with parents

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:34.640
to inform them about their child's progress, especially relative to

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:38.640
the state standard benchmarks. In terms of the options in front of

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:42.640
you, we would prefer either option one or two, administering

02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:46.640
the test either this spring or through an extended window rather than the fall

02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.640
and would support the accountability waiver as

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:54.640
well as the waiver of the 95% test.

02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:58.640
Finally, we would suggest that there really is a strong need for a

02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:02.640
communication plan with parents, especially if assessments are going to be administered

02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:06.640
in a distance learning setting so that they can be supportive

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.640
of their children as they take these assessments. Thank you.

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:04:14.640 --> 02:04:18.640
Your time starts now.

02:04:18.640 --> 02:04:22.640
Hi, my name is Anne Runge and I am an employee of San Diego

02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:26.640
Unified School District. Having administered the initial and

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.640
optional summative LPAC last fall and being required to prep

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:34.640
and train to administer the operational field test for the alternate,

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:38.640
the collusion of these three assessments was overwhelming and should

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.640
be looked at as lessons learned. I would like it noted that many

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:46.640
of our sites are currently administering the summative LPAC and a waiver is

02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:50.640
unfair at this point for that LPAC. Looking forward to this year,

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:54.640
I'm completely opposed to the extending testing window for this year.

02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:58.640
With the postponement of the operational field test until this fall and

02:04:58.640 --> 02:05:02.640
the initial, it will only cause a collision of testing

02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.640
during the fall season, which will create undue stress for both staff

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:10.640
and students. The extension into summer will create hardships on

02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:14.640
school districts to have children present themselves in person. Therefore,

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:18.640
I implore this board not to vote for an extension of the summative LPAC.

02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:22.640
Thank you for your time. Thank you.

02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:26.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.640
starts now.

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:34.640
Good morning President Darling-Hammond and members of the board.

02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:38.640
Angelina Gutierrez representing the LA County Office of Education.

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:42.640
I just want to echo the comments of my colleagues and respectfully urge the board and CDE

02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:46.640
to pursue a blanket waiver for the required administration of the state standardized

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:50.640
test for the 2020-21 school year. The statewide assessment is not

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.640
necessary in our current climate to properly measure the progress

02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:58.640
of our students have made this year and the data to be collected from any assessments

02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:02.640
will be unreliable in comparison to other testing years. We strongly support

02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:06.640
and need flexibility to allow our LEAs the discretion in selecting

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:10.640
and administering local assessments they need to reliably evaluate

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:14.640
student learning, progress, needs and gaps. Thank you.

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:18.640
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the

02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:22.640
record. Your time starts now.

02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:26.640
Good afternoon. Kristen Power with the Alliance for Children's Rights.

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:30.640
I wanted to be sure that the board and the California

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:34.640
Department of Education clarify to local education agencies and the public

02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:38.640
that any waiver of state assessments does not include assessments

02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:42.640
administered to students for the purposes of determining what, if any, services and

02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:46.640
supports are needed to provide the child with a free, appropriate public education.

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:50.640
In other words, individual education program IEP

02:06:50.640 --> 02:06:54.640
assessments required under the IDEA.

02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:58.640
These IEP assessments should cover all areas related to a student's suspected need or

02:06:58.640 --> 02:07:02.640
disability and we would encourage the board and

02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:06.640
Department of Education to clarify that this waiver, if

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:10.640
enacted, does not include those assessments. Thank you. Thank you.

02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:14.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:18.640
Your time starts now.

02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:22.640
Lorraine Richards speaking as a parent.

02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:26.640
Good morning. I'm a parent asking for testing to not continue remotely.

02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:30.640
I decided to ask my eighth grade son last night, what do you think about doing state

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.640
testing at home? He quickly came back with an odd expression

02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:38.640
to accompany. Home is not an environment for instruction and now testing.

02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:42.640
The test will be used for potential placement in next year's classes.

02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:46.640
That's not fair. It is stressful. Interruptions that cannot be controlled

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:50.640
like my dog barking and the kids playing outside next door or my sister in the kitchen.

02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:54.640
I, the parent, feel that there is limited time for

02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:58.640
instruction. I support the current instruction that is currently going on

02:07:58.640 --> 02:08:02.640
and how the time is being utilized. Teachers are using real time

02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:06.640
assessment to monitor progress. The preparation and setup for online at home

02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:10.640
testing would truly be a waste of time. The valuable time for instruction would be

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:14.640
robbed from students for the sake of adhering to the federal government's requirements.

02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:18.640
The bottom line, not time for testing for the home.

02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:22.640
California is better than this when it comes to students coming first. Thank you.

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:26.640
Thank you. Next call or please state your name and affiliation

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:30.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:34.640
Hi, this is Angela. I'm speaking as an

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:38.640
individual and I'm speaking on behalf of my fifth grade students

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:42.640
because I'm a fifth grade teacher. As an educator, there's so many other

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:46.640
assessments that would be useful and relevant. The data

02:08:46.640 --> 02:08:50.640
from this is going to be useless. It's the conditions.

02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:54.640
I can already anticipate my kids are going to have struggle getting on

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.640
logging in and navigating. But the

02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:02.640
data is not going to help me as an educator at all. And moreover, even in

02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:06.640
regular times, testing is sort of

02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:10.640
lady inducing for the kids. So I kind of consider this torture for my students

02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:14.640
and I really hope that we can do whatever we can to mitigate

02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:18.640
the impact on students.

02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:22.640
They're not going to feel great about doing this test and if we're really

02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:26.640
looking out for our kids, we'll do everything we can to protect them. Thank you.

02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:30.640
Thank you. Next call or please state your name and affiliation

02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:34.640
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:38.640
Can you hear me?

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.640
Yes, please go ahead.

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.640
Thank you. Good morning. My name is Christina Ballentine, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Assessment and

02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.640
LA Test Coordinator in Sunnyvale School District located in the Bay Area.

02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:54.640
Thank you Board for your ability to be warm demanders as defined by Zaretta Hammond.

02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:58.640
On behalf of the students in Sunnyvale, I encourage you to pursue a blanket assessment waiver for standardized

02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.640
tests. During the pandemic, we have been laser focused on ensuring that our students

02:10:02.640 --> 02:10:06.640
have continued to learn and grow social emotionally, physically, and academically.

02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:10.640
We have robust, valid, and reliable local measures to measure student academic progress

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:14.640
and have been utilizing these diagnostic tools in order to create recovery plans for our students

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:18.640
in collaboration with our parents. We are currently preparing for a hybrid reopening

02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.640
as county infection rates drop. This spring we would value using the time for instruction rather

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:26.640
than administering the state assessments. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that our

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:30.640
assessments do not measure how our students have grown in resilience, maturity, and capacity

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.640
for empathy and self-care during the pandemic. Thank you for your consideration and thoughtful

02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:38.640
decision making that positively impacts the students of California.

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:42.640
Thank you caller. Next caller, please state your name and

02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:46.640
affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.640
Hello, this is Lee. Good morning President Dunningham

02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:58.640
and members of the state board. This is Lee Angela Reed on behalf of

02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:02.640
Dr. Mary Ann Dewan, the county superintendent of schools of Santa Clara County.

02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:06.640
Superintendent Dewan appreciates the board's

02:11:06.640 --> 02:11:10.640
discussion of this item and the efforts from the federal

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:14.640
government to provide some guidance and flexibility. However,

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:18.640
she would ask that we continue to press forward for as much

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:22.640
flexibility as possible for our districts and

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:26.640
schools and to ask the board to continue advocating for

02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:30.640
a blanket waiver from the federal department of ed.

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:34.640
Thank you and thank you for your time. Thank you caller.

02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:38.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:42.640
Your time starts now.

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:46.640
Hi, my name is Stacy Salicca. I'm a LAUSC parent

02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:50.640
and stakeholder in public education. I'm

02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:54.640
calling to ask the board to apply for

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.640
a blanket assessment waiver for California at this time.

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.640
I'm a little bit concerned because there seems to be someone missing

02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:06.640
in this dialogue, which is the 6.3 million voices,

02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:10.640
the children. The choices on your survey did not

02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:14.640
give the option for a blanket waiver, therefore you had such

02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:18.640
an equal split within the LEI in asking

02:12:18.640 --> 02:12:22.640
what they would rather choose for the state

02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:26.640
assessment. And also to look at the local level, the local income

02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.640
interim testing has been very robust, especially

02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.640
in the LAUSC school system and children

02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:38.640
have been tested more now than ever before. Let's think of our

02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:42.640
children, the children's mental health. They should be first and foremost on this

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:46.640
and not be discussing the time and the money as parents

02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.640
and stakeholders that it would cost to do something that would only

02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:54.640
increase the anxiety and stress on these children that have

02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.640
had to deal with this pandemic for the last.

02:12:58.640 --> 02:13:02.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts

02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:06.640

02:13:06.640 --> 02:13:10.640
Caller, are

02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.640
you available?

02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:18.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.640
Your time starts now.

02:13:22.640 --> 02:13:26.640
Hi there, can you hear me?

02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.640
Yes, thank you caller. Perfect. Hi, my name is Kevin Schomer.

02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:34.640
I'm calling you on behalf of the Compton Unified School District as well as the California Association

02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:38.640
of Black School Educators. I'd like to urge the state board to embrace a blanket

02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:42.640
waiver for standardized testing in the 2021 school year. We believe that due to

02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:46.640
the learning conditions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, conducting

02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:50.640
standardized state tests will simply not be fair to students nor will they provide

02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:54.640
any meaningful data associated with student achievement outcomes. We believe that any

02:13:54.640 --> 02:13:58.640
tests administered under current circumstances will have little if any validity

02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:02.640
and we believe that a student's time will be better served by continuing to focus on learning and not

02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:06.640
anxiety inducing assessments. We're concerned about the impact on equity

02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:10.640
in student mental health. I look forward to pursuing a robust testing regime when students are

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:14.640
safely back in the classroom and can focus on learning next year. Thank you.

02:14:14.640 --> 02:14:18.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:22.640
Your time starts now.

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:26.640
Hello, this is Mary Perry from the California State

02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:30.640
PTA and we believe that testing

02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.640
provides important information and parents need to understand

02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:38.640
how their children's academic status compares to others in the

02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:42.640
state. That said, the concerns about testing this

02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.640
spring are valid as well. For that reason, we believe

02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:50.640
that the postponement of testing and or the extension of the testing window

02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.640
until the vast majority of students are back in school

02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.640
is the appropriate middle ground, perhaps

02:14:58.640 --> 02:15:02.640
with further adjustments to testing format if that's a reasonable

02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:06.640
alternative. Thank you. Thank you.

02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:10.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:15:10.640 --> 02:15:14.640
Your time starts now.

02:15:14.640 --> 02:15:18.640
Madam President and members, this is Brian

02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:22.640
Revis calling in on behalf of the Education Trust West.

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:26.640
Our view of federal guidance on this matter is

02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:30.640
that blanket waivers will not be granted. And the reason

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.640
for that is the federal government has indicated we need to be able

02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:38.640
to see the full impact of the pandemic and we agree

02:15:38.640 --> 02:15:42.640
with that. We think we need data to guide the recovery

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.640
and the recovery will be more effective for low-income

02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:50.640
students and students of color if we have data that

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:54.640
can guide the allocation of resources. We're asking

02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:58.640
that you proceed with the current testing window because we think the results

02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:02.640
should be available as soon as possible. And I also want to lift

02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:06.640
up that in our polling of parents, parents have

02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:10.640
repeatedly indicated they want to know how is my son or daughter doing

02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:14.640
and should I be advocating for expanded learning

02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:18.640
opportunities. We also think it's important to provide testing for

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:22.640
those purposes and we agree with the

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.640
desire to seek a waiver from accountability. We think that's appropriate

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:30.640
in the current circumstance. Thank you. Thank you.

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:34.640
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.640
Your time starts now.

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:42.640
Good morning State Board of Education. My name is Stephanie Gambrell

02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.640
and I'm the assessment coordinator for Alder Grove Charter School in Eureka, California.

02:16:46.640 --> 02:16:50.640
I implore you to put a blanket waiver for statewide assessments

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:54.640
or at the very least provide flexibility when it comes to accountability.

02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.640
As you've heard from the majority of the school and district leaders you've called in today,

02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:02.640
the survey included a choice for a waiver. I have no doubt this would have been an overwhelming preference.

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:06.640
Furthermore, the requirement that alternate assessments be administered in person

02:17:06.640 --> 02:17:10.640
unfairly targets students who are often more at risk for health complications than other

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:14.640
students. In our small LEA where we'll be continuing distance learning

02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:18.640
until the fall, the two students that had to take the alternate assessments are both highly compromised

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:22.640
and will be opting out if required to assess this year. The impact this will have on our

02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:26.640
participation rate is devastating and places an unreasonable amount of pressure on our

02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:30.640
small school, not to mention the stress this will have on students during an already

02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:34.640
challenging year. Thank you.

02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:38.640
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.640
Your time starts now.

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.640
Good morning. Marcia Zaragoza Diaz representing

02:17:46.640 --> 02:17:50.640
the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:54.640
We believe the option extending the window to July

02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:58.640
30th for the CASP is the best option at this time in light of the situation

02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:02.640
that we're all in. However, we are requesting the board to extend

02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:06.640
the LPAC window to the fall. The LPAC is different from

02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.640
the CASP in that it is given in all grades. Younger children are tested

02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:14.640
where a larger percentage of our EL students are enrolled and an oral

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:18.640
component of the test is included. Many EL students minimally

02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:22.640
participated or didn't participate in distance learning affecting

02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:26.640
the numbers of tested. Additionally, there were

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:30.640
significant problems of connectivity and the lack of secure browsers.

02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:34.640
By extending the LPAC window to the fall, we believe larger numbers of

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.640
EL students will be given the LPAC and LEAs

02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:42.640
will be better prepared to administer the LPAC. Thank you.

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:46.640
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for

02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.640
the record. Your time starts now.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:54.640
Hello? Yes, please proceed. Can you hear me? Yes,

02:18:54.640 --> 02:18:58.640
please proceed with your comment. My name is Susan Misman

02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:02.640
with Speak Up United Parents with over 4,000 parent members

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:06.640
in Los Angeles. We strongly support

02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:10.640
collecting data for actionable change, which I believe

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:14.640
one of your board members talked about recently. And that response

02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:18.640
is needed sooner than later to begin to recover effectively

02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:22.640
and address learning loss and closing the widened gap.

02:19:22.640 --> 02:19:26.640
More like a continental divide right now, which continues to grow.

02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:30.640
We are California. We can do this hybrid in class

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:34.640
remotely, emphasizing we support a waiver on

02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:38.640
the accountability element. Assessments should be used

02:19:38.640 --> 02:19:42.640
at this point in time are critical for our parents and our

02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.640
communities to understand what tools

02:19:46.640 --> 02:19:50.640
are needed for student progress and how to best target resources

02:19:50.640 --> 02:19:54.640
and programs who need it now, not tied to accountability

02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:58.640
but for the purposes of recovering. And waiting until

02:19:58.640 --> 02:20:02.640
fall is far too long. Thank you very much. Thank you.

02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:38.640
Hi, my name is Minnie Ferguson. I am a member

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:42.640
of the Indigenous Resurgence Education Network and co-head

02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:46.640
of Anahuacalmecoc World School, the only

02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:50.640
indigenous state school, K-12 in Los Angeles. I urge

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:54.640
the State Board of Education superintendent to pursue a blanket waiver of

02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:58.640
all federal mandates for students testing in 2021, as well

02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:02.640
as a waiver of additional state mandates due to the impact of the pandemic.

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:06.640
Our school is located in what became a national epicenter

02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:10.640
of the latest surge in the pandemic. The state should also determine how

02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:14.640
historical rates of child hunger, housing insecurity, and a lack of access

02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:18.640
to health care have impacted children and students in the most fundamental

02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:22.640
ways. We have actively assessed our students internally and have

02:22:22.640 --> 02:22:26.640
ways of knowing how our students are doing and have worked with our

02:22:26.640 --> 02:22:30.640
families immensely to be able to give them

02:22:30.640 --> 02:22:34.640
feedback throughout the year so that they are involved and they're able

02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:38.640
to work with us on addressing the needs and areas of growth.

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:42.640
We feel all professionals are capable of doing this, all schools are capable of doing this,

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:46.640
and the state of California can continue with its training

02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.640
and all the tools that it's been providing us to start administering the IABs,

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:54.640
which could be a way in which teachers can use them in the classrooms

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:58.640
and greatly support students.

02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:02.640

Okay, that caller dropped.

02:23:30.640 --> 02:23:35.840
Caller dropped, last caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.840
Your time starts now.

02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:41.960
Good morning, my name is Maria Arias.

02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:45.160
I am a parent of three special needs children.

02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:50.160
I would like today to speak on behalf of the special education children and community.

02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:56.760
Please do not vote or allow any waivers to come into effect, as it is our special needs

02:23:57.280 --> 02:24:00.280
children have been hurt through distance learning.

02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:05.280
Many not receiving services as is detailed in their IEPs.

02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:10.280
Today, I ask for the California State Board of Education to please protect special needs

02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:13.280
children and protect their rights, their faith.

02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:18.280
In an effort to advocate for special needs children, our family created a YouTube movement,

02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:23.280
every student successful, more education, less litigation, a special education children

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.280
matter.

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:27.800
Thank you for the opportunity to provide public comment today.

02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:28.800
Have a great day.

02:24:28.800 --> 02:24:29.800
Thank you, caller.

02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:31.800
This concludes public comment.

02:24:31.800 --> 02:24:32.800
Thank you.

02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:35.800
Thank you so much.

02:24:35.800 --> 02:24:40.800
We really very much appreciate the testimony today.

02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:44.800
And we know that this is a difficult issue, an emotional issue.

02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:49.800
These are difficult circumstances and we have less than perfect choices.

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:56.320
And that supporting schools and caring for students and our staff and supporting learning

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:59.320
has to be our most important priority.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.320
Clearly we need to value the time for learning, reduce and prioritize the time that's needed

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:10.320
for assessment so that results can be useful and where traditional summative assessments

02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:16.320
cannot be administered safely and reasonably, we'll need to identify other ways that student

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:21.840
learning and progress data can be provided to students and parents and educators.

02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:28.840
We are going to open the table for discussion among board members.

02:25:29.840 --> 02:25:32.840
And I see that member Rucker has a hand raised.

02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:37.840
If others would please identify yourself if you want to speak, I will keep track.

02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:39.840
Thank you very much.

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:41.840
I hope you can hear me.

02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:42.840
We can.

02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.360
I want to first begin by thanking the public and the diversity of stakeholders who called

02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:49.360
in.

02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:54.560
In all of my time on the state board, I have been impressed, informed and influenced by

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:59.560
your assertions and the statements and advice you have offered to the board.

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:04.240
I'm so thankful that you take the steps that are required for you to participate in this

02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:08.600
virtual meeting to be engaged as you have been today.

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:13.360
There's so much to discuss about this item and the action we're asked to contemplate.

02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:18.360
So knowing that we at some point will move to considering a motion, I do want to ask

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:24.360
my colleagues on the board to consider dividing or splitting the recommendations into more

02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.360
than one motion.

02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.360
I held the questions that I wanted to ask about some of the recommendations because

02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:37.360
I wanted to hear the feedback from the public comment and be informed by that.

02:26:38.120 --> 02:26:43.120
So I wanted to be able to ask more about those pros and cons so that I'm not sitting here

02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:48.120
rambling forever in a day, which I wouldn't be allowed to do anyway, thank you.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:52.120
Let me begin my comments by saying that I'm frankly confused.

02:26:52.120 --> 02:26:59.120
The fact of the matter is whatever assessments are going to be used will be reported publicly

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:04.120
by all schools and districts with the goal of providing actionable data to inform school

02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:05.120
change.

02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:11.880
The fact is the state has decided that testing must proceed and a blanket waiver is off the table.

02:27:11.880 --> 02:27:18.880
But the fact also is we can do better and we can do more with the options that are actually

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:19.880
in front of us.

02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:25.880
Dr. Gregson urged the board at the beginning of this meeting to think about what is in

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:27.880
the students.

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:34.640
So the national assessment of educational progress, the test that is the foundational

02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:39.640
element of the nation's public school report card has been canceled for this year.

02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:45.640
The U.S. Department of Education in fact requested that NAEP testing be canceled this spring

02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:50.640
and the vendor complied and the reason that the department gave for canceling the NAEP

02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:53.640
assessment was because of the pandemic.

02:27:54.400 --> 02:28:00.400
But the burden for the annual testing of every single student from grades three through eight

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.400
will not be disrupted.

02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:08.400
The staff did a great job of laying out the options as well as the burdens for implementing

02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:14.400
this requirement, all to collect data for actionable change.

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.400
So I'm confused.

02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:21.400
If we want to understand the impact of the coronavirus on American students, it's the

02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:23.400
NAEP test that should go forward.

02:28:24.160 --> 02:28:28.160
The NAEP assessment has been administered to scientific samples of students since the

02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:29.160
late 1960s.

02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:33.160
Since 1992, it's even provided state by state comparisons.

02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:39.160
It disaggregates scores by race, gender, income, English language status, disability status,

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.160
and other criteria.

02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:45.160
It measures achievement gaps among white students, black students, Hispanic students, and Asian

02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.160
students.

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:51.160
It supplies the same valuable information for a score of urban districts that volunteer

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:52.160
to be tested.

02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:55.920
And there are no stakes attached to the NAEP results.

02:28:55.920 --> 02:29:01.920
In short, if we're looking for actionable data to inform what's going on in schools

02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:07.920
and to understand the impact of the pandemic on students, NAEP would have been the ideal

02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:10.920
gauge for measuring that impact.

02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:16.920
Further, it meets all the requirements that were outlined in the federal guidance that

02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:21.920
the feds are willing to give states to assure that their state assessments go forward.

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:28.680
What we heard from district leadership today is that the state tests should be canceled.

02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.680
The state tests should be canceled because, and they've given multiple reasons, students

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:38.680
are going to opt out, the scores from this test will be meaningless, the mandated test

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:43.680
will tell teachers nothing worth knowing since teachers are already doing a battery of local

02:29:43.680 --> 02:29:48.680
assessments that gives them more immediate, actionable information about the progress

02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:54.440
that students are making, not only on, not only weekly, but over time.

02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:59.440
They do not tell teachers information that can be used to make actionable decisions about

02:29:59.440 --> 02:30:01.440
school change.

02:30:01.440 --> 02:30:06.440
The results of these tests, despite the waiver information, will still have high stakes.

02:30:06.440 --> 02:30:11.440
Otherwise, why are we still posting them in the student report, in the school report cards?

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.440
I'm just saying.

02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:20.200
So, how are the options that are in front of us, that were proposed by the staff with

02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:26.200
a complete analysis, complete and thoughtful analysis about what we can do, how are all

02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:30.200
those options truly in the best needs of the students?

02:30:30.200 --> 02:30:35.200
The proposals I saw solve our problem as a state education agency.

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:43.200
The proposal I saw solves our problem in acquiring a waiver and figuring out some ways to flexibly

02:30:43.960 --> 02:30:44.960
support the schools.

02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:49.960
But does it actually solve the problems we heard from the district leaders and the parents

02:30:49.960 --> 02:30:55.960
who spoke about what it is they need to know about their students and be able to support

02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:56.960
them?

02:30:56.960 --> 02:31:00.960
The polling results that were reported in the presentation from the department doesn't

02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:06.960
seem to align with the comments we heard from district leadership who testified today.

02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:10.960
Every time I see a national poll on cultural attitudes and norms, I'm always surprised

02:31:11.720 --> 02:31:15.720
by the conclusions because I'm clearly certain they didn't ask me.

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:20.720
But based on the fact that every district leader we heard a statement from today, there

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:25.720
is no agreement or consensus among education leaders about the recommendations proposed

02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:27.720
for the board's consideration.

02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:32.720
And I'm absolutely positive that I heard clear agreement that the testing should be canceled

02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:33.720
altogether.

02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:39.720
I lost count at 25 for the number of times I heard a reference to the blanket waiver.

02:31:40.480 --> 02:31:44.480
If the state board wants to decide that a blanket waiver is not in the best interest

02:31:44.480 --> 02:31:50.480
of students for the purpose of informing schools and the public, what other flexibilities

02:31:50.480 --> 02:31:54.480
can be considered that really would do, would really satisfy those needs?

02:31:55.480 --> 02:32:00.480
Nothing in the recommendations we heard, in my opinion, addresses how to assure that

02:32:00.480 --> 02:32:06.480
districts will not simply find themselves needing to bring students back to the campus

02:32:07.240 --> 02:32:13.240
for the full purpose of testing students in order to meet the waiver we will ask for.

02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:19.240
Currently, inside the open assessment window we have, 52 of 58 counties are still in purple

02:32:19.240 --> 02:32:20.240
status.

02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:26.240
What forecast do we have to know that that status will change to allow more districts

02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:32.240
to be able to provide the assessment support that were enumerated by district leaderships

02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:34.240
in today's testimony?

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:39.000
The current state recommendation mitigates impact identified by many stakeholders concerning

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:45.000
military dependents, students in alternative programs and charter schools, students in

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:49.000
schools with 12 weeks or less of instruction remaining, schools whose assessment window

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
will soon close.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Charter schools pointed out that current state statutes enumerate 11 alternative academic

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.000
assessments for charters to use.

02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:07.760
I read in the plain language of the guidance letter that other assessments can be considered.

02:33:07.760 --> 02:33:14.760
Since we already have a statutory option for charters to use to report their information,

02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:19.260
their academic performance and progress as students, why couldn't we consider asking

02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:22.760
the feds to allow us to allow all schools to consider using it?

02:33:22.760 --> 02:33:26.760
It's the same assessment, it can be reported in a uniform way.

02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:31.760
Apparently, we've decided that they are valid and reliable for the purpose of doing the

02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:36.520
student reporting and in order to support not only the concerns that were raised by

02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:41.520
the charter community but by the school leaders in general who spoke today, why don't we

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:47.520
look at something at a different level of activity, engagement and burden that could

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:53.520
be more readily used and implemented by districts and in a way that addresses some of the burdensome

02:33:53.520 --> 02:33:55.520
concerns that were given.

02:33:55.520 --> 02:33:58.520
So I am confused and I'm just saying.

02:33:58.520 --> 02:34:00.520
Thank you very much.

02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:04.520
Thank you, member Rucker.

02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:08.520
I am not seeing other hands yet at the moment.

02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:10.520
Member Navo, member Burr.

02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:12.520
So member Navo next and then member Burr.

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:22.520
I just want to thank board member Patricia for her comments because I really...

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.520
Rucker.

02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:26.520
Rucker.

02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:30.520
I'm trying to think about what I'm going to say, Patricia, at the same time acknowledging

02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:35.280
no, I appreciate that, board member Rucker.

02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:39.280
I appreciate your comments and I think that there's something to be said about thinking

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.280
about other options.

02:34:41.280 --> 02:34:47.280
That being said, I do have a question about the CA for Rachel or Mao and what are the

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:53.280
implications in terms of testing should we return or flexibilities therein for students

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.280
with disabilities?

02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:02.040
Because if I remember correctly, the last conversation we had at the state level, that

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:08.040
particular assessment was required to be in person or highly encouraged to be in person

02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:14.040
and if you couldn't, then they were basically saying it would be problematic.

02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:20.040
So, member Navo, can I just paraphrase back to what I heard you say to make sure that

02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:22.040
I understood your question?

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:30.800
So, you're asking what or are there additional flexibilities for the alternate assessments

02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:32.800
that potentially we could explore?

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:34.800
Is that correct?

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:36.800
Yes.

02:35:36.800 --> 02:35:38.800
What exists and what could be explored?

02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:40.800
Okay.

02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:44.800
So, I think that there's just a couple things that I want to clarify.

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.800
When we're talking about the alternate assessments versus the assessments that are

02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:57.560
requested for identification of students with disabilities for parents, they're two very

02:35:57.560 --> 02:35:59.560
different assessments.

02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:03.560
One falls under IDEA and one falls underneath our federal requirements for assessment.

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:09.560
So, the one that we're talking about is the alternate assessments.

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:13.560
That one is we would only be able to provide in person.

02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:19.560
There are no other possible flexibilities outside for a remote administration option

02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:24.320
for that assessment for the same reasons that I had mentioned previously.

02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:31.320
That the assessment requires manipulatives and additional tools to be able to administer

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:35.320
the assessment and our regulations state that that must be done by a test coordinator

02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:39.320
and at home it would have to be done by a parent.

02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:41.320
Okay.

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:43.320
That's helpful.

02:36:43.320 --> 02:36:45.320
And science as well?

02:36:46.080 --> 02:36:48.080
No.

02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.080
Science, we would be able to provide a remote administration option.

02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:58.080
I just want to clarify, did you mean the California alternate assessment for science as well?

02:36:58.080 --> 02:37:00.080
Yes.

02:37:00.080 --> 02:37:02.080
Yeah.

02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:04.080
That would also be in the alternates group category.

02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:08.080
So, it would be the same as the ELA and math alternates as well.

02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:10.080
Okay.

02:37:10.080 --> 02:37:12.080
Thank you.

02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:14.080
I just wanted to clarify.

02:37:14.840 --> 02:37:16.840
Okay.

02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:18.840
Member Burr and then I see Member Sun and Member Glover-Woods.

02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:22.840
Thank you.

02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:27.840
So, I just experienced what I think many of our callers were concerned about which was

02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:29.840
I completely lost power.

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.840
And so, it was without the computer and without the benefit of your discussion for about the

02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:36.840
last 15 minutes.

02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:42.840
And without the benefit of my Zoom background which went down when I lost power.

02:37:43.600 --> 02:37:45.600
So, anyway, I apologize.

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:49.600
So, President Darling-Hammond, can I just clarify, are you asking for our general comments

02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:53.600
about the discussion or just asking for additional questions?

02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.600
At this point, we're open for board discussion.

02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:57.600
Okay.

02:37:57.600 --> 02:38:04.600
So, I will say I did have the benefit of hearing the tail end I think of Board Member Rucker's

02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:12.600
comments which I found very enlightening especially the comment about the cancellation of NAEP.

02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:17.360
And I do think that if the cancellation of NAEP is any indicator about what the federal

02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:23.360
government thinks about regular testing, if you will, then I would take our guidance from

02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.360
that.

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:30.360
A couple of things that really struck me in the comments from our public commenters and

02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:32.360
I think I got all of them.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.360
I was counting them all.

02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.360
I got to 38.

02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:38.360
So, I may have missed a couple.

02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:43.120
One of the comments to me was administering a test does not help with reopening schools.

02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:49.120
And I feel like our number one challenge right now is to try to get the vast majority of

02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:51.120
our schools open.

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.120
And all of us in our various roles know what those challenges have been and continue to

02:38:56.120 --> 02:38:58.120
be.

02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:02.120
At least in Sacramento, I don't think we're going to see many of our largest districts

02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.120
open until April if we're lucky.

02:39:06.880 --> 02:39:11.880
Many of the commenters talked about how much instructional time, meaning in-person instructional

02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:18.880
time, would be available and it just seems to me so limited as to make a summative assessment

02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:21.880
very difficult for any purpose.

02:39:21.880 --> 02:39:26.880
And I want to go back to a couple of opening comments I think both Mao and Rachel made

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:31.880
about what the purpose of the test is and one of them that was repeated a number of

02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:35.880
times is to allow for actionable change.

02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:41.640
Which was the reason I asked my original question about what would the response time be in terms

02:39:41.640 --> 02:39:43.640
of getting results back.

02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:45.640
Honestly, I'd never heard an answer to that question.

02:39:45.640 --> 02:39:48.640
I'd love to hear it, to know what that would be.

02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:54.640
Because if the purpose of giving the assessment is not to provide information back for our

02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:59.640
teachers, to allow them to adjust their instruction accordingly, then I think we're on a bit of

02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:05.640
a fool's errand here with trying to impose something that is not really helpful to our

02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:07.400
school personnel.

02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.400
And I'll just close again with my opening that all of the technical issues that were

02:40:12.400 --> 02:40:17.400
raised by a number of our comments about not having a secure browser, who knows what the

02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:24.400
home environment is like when kids are trying to take tests, I do think are really insurmountable.

02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:26.400
I said I was closed but I just have one other thing.

02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:32.400
Having lived through our conversation with the federal government in 2013, I am not in

02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:38.160
any way suggesting that's the kind of conversation we would try to have with this Department

02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:42.160
of Education, who I think really does want to be helpful.

02:40:42.160 --> 02:40:48.160
So I would suggest that our conversation with them needs to be framed in our context, leading

02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:54.160
with the percent of the students who are not even in in-person instruction have not been,

02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:57.160
are various challenges with the digital divide.

02:40:57.160 --> 02:41:02.160
The way I read the letter was they were inviting us to have that conversation about what

02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:04.920
additional flexibilities that we might need.

02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:12.920
And so for me, I would advocate for the absolute maximum flexibility consistent with many of

02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:13.920
our public commenters.

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:14.920
Thank you.

02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:15.920
Thank you very much.

02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:22.920
And Member Beru, you asked an important question that I'd just like to pause and let Rachel

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:29.920
respond to with respect to the turnaround time from our traditional state summative

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:30.920
assessments.

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:37.680
So to that question, Member Beru, my understanding, and Mary Ann, please feel free to jump in

02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:44.680
if you'd like to add any additional information, is that the student score reports would be

02:41:44.680 --> 02:41:49.680
available about four weeks after assessments are provided.

02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:55.680
And if I might add, so when a student completes all components of whatever tests they're

02:41:56.440 --> 02:42:03.440
taking for their grade level, we release the results electronically to the LEA.

02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:08.440
And that would flow, that would go all throughout the assessment.

02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:14.440
There is a period of time before we start releasing the student score reports where

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.440
we conduct an analysis and a quality control process.

02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:24.440
And once we have a sign off on that from the CDE, then all the student score reports just

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:28.200
start flowing.

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.200
Thank you.

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200
Can I just say, let's think about that a little bit.

02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:36.200
If we don't have instruction or people giving, no one's given a test, if I understand it,

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:41.200
from what Rachel and Maucin, and I don't know if it's just coincidence that the blueprints

02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.200
allowed for tests to start on the 22nd, but it's an interesting coincidence.

02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:53.200
So if people really don't start administering the assessments until they get back in person,

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:58.200
that's April, and then you've got four weeks in theory before results get back.

02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:04.200
Again, I just want us to think about the practical implications and the burdens that we would

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:09.200
potentially be placing on our LEAs in trying to push this through.

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:10.200
Thank you.

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:13.200
Thank you very much.

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:17.200
Member Sutton.

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:18.200
Thank you.

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:24.200
I'm intrigued by the comments from Member Rucker.

02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:30.200
I do wonder, have we thought outside the box enough on this issue?

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:37.200
And all the technical difficulties of administering the test, the validity of the data, I completely

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:40.200
agree and support.

02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:48.200
And yet I don't know, I don't think that we can wait until 2022 of spring to do an assessment.

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:58.200
And so I wonder if we might be able to ask for maximum flexibility and for us to be away

02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:04.200
from the federal requirements for this year, but then as California, think about a way

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:10.200
that we can assess sometime in the fall when students are back in.

02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:14.200
Because I don't think that we can wait until spring of 2022.

02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:18.200
We need to have some type of state assessment.

02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:25.200
And yes, I completely understand that districts and schools are doing their own interim assessments.

02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.200
And I think that's wonderful.

02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:30.200
And I appreciate the efforts in doing that.

02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:33.200
But I do think we need to have a statewide assessment.

02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.200
Even the example that was given about the charter schools are using that.

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:41.200
But that's after a scrub of a statewide assessment.

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.200
So there's some comparability there.

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:50.200
So I wonder if there's a way that we might be able to do, irrespective of the state,

02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:52.200
for us to do something in the fall.

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:57.200
Because I also think that we need to have data for districts and LEAs to start looking

02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:00.200
at their LCAPs the following year.

02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:05.200
So just kind of, again, kind of thinking out of the box.

02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:12.200
And it feels like stretching the fall administration all the way to the fall for this year,

02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:18.200
a lot of it is because we're still trying to extend this school year into the next one.

02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:25.200
What if we just close the school year and begin the next school year with some type of initial assessment?

02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:27.200
Just going that out.

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:30.200
Thank you.

02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:32.200
I've forgotten my order of cue.

02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:35.200
Does anybody remember who I had mentioned next?

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:36.200
Was it Glover Woods?

02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:37.200
Member Glover Woods?

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:38.200
I thought so.

02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.200
Thank you.

02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:45.200
And then just to note, I see Member Strauss, Member Patio-Browns, and Member Fatah with their hands up.

02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:47.200
So I haven't forgotten about you.

02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:49.200
Member Glover Woods.

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:51.200
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:57.200
As has been already stated, this is a very complex issue.

02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:59.200
A lot of decisions to be made.

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:08.200
And just to kind of underscore again, two of the competing issues, if you will, is around the administration.

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:17.200
And we understand the intent of assessments and how essential assessments are in letting us know how students are learning and how they have been learning.

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:26.200
But I think we must also recognize the impact in many of the issues, even with a varied amount of administration options.

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:36.200
So when we think about how that impacts the accuracy of the results that would be received, we need to definitely keep that in mind.

02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:44.200
Because whether it is done remotely, and I don't have to echo the comment from Member Burr.

02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:51.200
And already what we know about the issues around some of the remote options for many of the students in our state.

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:57.200
Many of our districts and schools are not able to bring students back in person.

02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:59.200
It's still not quite safe to do so.

02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:01.200
And even extending into the summer.

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:11.200
So there's just a lot of complexity on how any of these administration options will impact the accuracy of the results for students that are.

02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:22.200
We also have to consider that there is a need to have data on how students have been able to learn during this past year.

02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:25.200
Parents need to know how their children are doing.

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:36.200
Children want to know how they are doing as well as communities to know how this is impacting many students from many different student groups.

02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:54.200
So one of the things I propose, I believe it's kind of been said before, is a consideration on how to leverage some of the local assessment options that LEAs have already had to commit to in their learning continuity and attendance plan.

02:47:54.200 --> 02:48:01.200
How might those local assessments be leveraged and communicated publicly?

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:03.200
Communicated to parents?

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:10.200
To give again the indication for what I believe we're all saying is the importance of having the assessments.

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:23.200
But also keeping it within the context that students are already familiar with as they've been taking many of these interim assessments and formative assessments throughout the school year.

02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:32.200
Yet again, not having that data be hidden, if you will, where parents are unaware and where the community at large is not aware.

02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:48.200
So I'm wondering as we explore flexibilities with the U.S. Department of Education if we may be able to explore that flexibility in lieu of administering a state assessment, again with all of the complexities that are there.

02:48:48.200 --> 02:49:03.200
One last part I'd like to add, and I will stop talking, President Darling-Hammond, is how whatever decision we make will impact charter schools and the requirements that they now have for their renewals.

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:13.200
And again, if there is not a state assessment that is given, what does that mean for many of the pieces that they are going to be held accountable for?

02:49:13.200 --> 02:49:30.200
And if we do look and feel that it's necessary to explore the flexibility of local assessments, would we suggest and advocate that those local assessments only be looked at for those tested grade levels?

02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:47.200
Or the state assessment? Or is there great benefit? Since I believe in almost all locations in our state, those local assessments are being done for students through all grade levels to have that as part of the consideration.

02:49:47.200 --> 02:50:03.200
So we really get a true picture of what all students in the state of California who have been engaged in instruction this year, how they are learning so that we're able to make some determinations on how to best meet their needs as we go into the new year.

02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:30.200
I'm going to, before I call on Member Strauss, who's next in my list, simply respond on this question of the assessments, the diagnostic and interim assessments that have been used, that it was heartening to see that virtually every district that responded to the survey that the department put out for the various questions that they asked said that they were giving those assessments.

02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:49.200
We had required that in the instructional continuity plans, and we had published the list of assessments in the late summer, I believe it was, that have already been state approved by this board as measuring the state standards in English language arts and mathematics.

02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:55.200
We did not do that in science, but we did do that in English language.

02:50:55.200 --> 02:51:03.200
So just to augment the point that you are making.

02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:07.200
Member Strauss is next in the queue.

02:51:07.200 --> 02:51:11.200
I just wonder, I see Judy Sias has her hand up. Should she go before me?

02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:14.200
Yes, she should.

02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:16.200
I didn't know you are.

02:51:16.200 --> 02:51:24.200
Hello, Judy Sias with the State Board of Education. I wanted to respond to Member Glover-Wood's question about the impact on charter schools.

02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:37.200
As we know, AB 1505 set some renewal criteria that are based on dashboard results and looking at the last two out of three years and various indicators of the dashboard.

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:42.200
But that's in legislation, so that is not something that's within the purview of the board.

02:51:42.200 --> 02:51:45.200
So that would take some sort of legislative fix.

02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:52.200
The verified data is within the purview of the board, the list that you all adopted back in November.

02:51:52.200 --> 02:52:00.200
But again, I think at this point we'd have to see the broader legislative change before we get down to the verified data issue.

02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:04.200
Because the verified data piece is for schools in the middle and low track.

02:52:04.200 --> 02:52:11.200
So we'd have to see how middle and low track could be adjusted by the legislature before revisiting the verified data piece.

02:52:11.200 --> 02:52:12.200
Thank you.

02:52:12.200 --> 02:52:16.200
Thank you very much. Appreciate that. That's an important question.

02:52:16.200 --> 02:52:21.200
I think Member Strauss is the next and then Member Petio-Bronson and then Member Fatah.

02:52:21.200 --> 02:52:30.200
So again, I want to thank President Darling-Hammond and Deputy Superintendent and Chief Deputy Gregson for the framing of today.

02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:39.200
And just to say that I can't imagine any more steps CDE could have done to try to address all the requirements as the situation was evolving.

02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:44.200
I thought the comments that we heard from the public were incredibly articulate and thoughtful,

02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:51.200
both in the need for data to inform instruction, but also the struggles of remote assessment.

02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:55.200
So I just would go back for some key areas for me that are really important,

02:52:55.200 --> 02:53:02.200
which is and I think that the federal guidance says kids should not be brought back just to take the test.

02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:06.200
And I do believe there's benefit of assessment in person.

02:53:06.200 --> 02:53:20.200
So while students are remote, I actually think the complications, the equity challenges, bandwidth, family settings, the browser, all those issues, I think is not going to give us valid and reliable data.

02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:23.200
It's going to be one more hoop and incredibly frustrating.

02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:29.200
So I would just encourage us to look at the maximum flexibilities while students are in remote.

02:53:29.200 --> 02:53:35.200
Obviously, our priority is to get kids back. And I know we are starting to get more and more students back.

02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:44.200
I do think there's some research or some recommendations that say students should be back three or four weeks before they take a standardized assessment.

02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:48.200
President Darling-Hammond may know, but I don't think we should bring them back.

02:53:48.200 --> 02:53:57.200
I mean, we've all talked about the need for social emotional connection, community, the separation anxiety, kids leaving home, parents separation anxiety.

02:53:57.200 --> 02:54:04.200
I've been working with or talking about needing to create a whole camp to get kids back in again after being out of school a year.

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:08.200
It's a year since we were together in Sacramento.

02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:13.200
And so I think we need to remember that we need time to do that before we do assessment.

02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:27.200
I support continued shorting shortening of the exams when possible, including the comment of thinking about taking the performance assessment into a classroom activity so that the state online assessment is shorter.

02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:39.200
I do. I think we need to look at LPAC being in person and I would support the recommendation that if we cannot assess LPAC in person, we extend that window.

02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:48.200
I know that there's budget requirements for the legislature and governor to support, but I think for English learners, that assessment in person is essential.

02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:51.200
And I want to be sensitive to that issue.

02:54:51.200 --> 02:55:12.200
The other concern I have is if it costs $74 million to do a fall assessment, I guess as a former school leader and district leader, I could see that 74 million supporting students in a very strong, focused way that might make a bigger difference and impact than a single assessment.

02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:15.200
And so I worry about that.

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:26.200
And so I want to look at our flexibilities within this school year and then begin the next school year, hopefully back in person and a fresh start for kids and re-engaging.

02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:31.200
I also want to reflect the issue of local data.

02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:40.200
We required in the learning continuity plan that districts use local data to inform instruction. That was required in SB 98.

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:55.200
And I think districts have done that and I think that we need to make sure that that local assessment data is being shared with parents very clearly and then also being used to inform instructional strategies and support for students.

02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:00.200
I was working with principals this week and looking at videos of classrooms.

02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:08.200
Teachers know which kids are struggling. They know which kids have not turned their camera on, which kids have been absent, which kids are not doing assignments.

02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:12.200
We need to make sure that that is transferred into support for students.

02:56:12.200 --> 02:56:20.200
So again, I support the use of data, but not only state data, local data to inform practice.

02:56:20.200 --> 02:56:33.200
And I just remember when we were doing online AP testing last spring, you might remember those horrible stories of a student finishing the AP exam and then not being able to upload it and not getting credit for doing the AP exam.

02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:45.200
But why would we do that when students have worked so hard? I think students have worked hard. Teachers and leaders, they're killing themselves to do the most creative teaching in this really challenging situation.

02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:51.200
So we need to look at what this is for to inform instruction and to see what kids know.

02:56:51.200 --> 02:56:59.200
And I just think while we're in remote setting, we need to really realize that we wouldn't be getting the valid and reliable data that we need.

02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:04.200
So, again, I would support as much flexibility as possible.

02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:13.200
And again, I'd like to, again, hear from the rest of my colleagues who I know share some of these concerns and have others that they would like to add to the conversation.

02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:18.200
Thank you. All right. Member Patio Brownson.

02:57:18.200 --> 02:57:25.200
I also want to just start by saying thank you to the staff members. This has been a two day turnaround.

02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:36.200
It's really quite incredible, actually, how quickly you all have come together to put this, I think, very cogent analysis in front of us and offer appreciation for that.

02:57:36.200 --> 02:57:51.200
I also want to concur with my fellow board members who have raised up the importance of making sure that we have data that is publicly available to both educators as well as parents and community members.

02:57:51.200 --> 02:58:11.200
And sort of the conversation around not having state level data until spring of 2022 really seems like too big a sacrifice and certainly one that doesn't seem to be on the table given ongoing conversations with the federal government.

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:32.200
I think the other aspect around the data that is going to be made available that is, I think, a unique sort of feature of our California system is that LCFF depends on parent and community awareness of data and making sure that we can actually continue to partner with parents

02:58:32.200 --> 02:58:42.200
and community as active participants in driving what LCAPs look like and driving what local options are responsive to in terms of community need.

02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:58.200
That depends on a notion of local parents and local community members having access to the data about disparities, about how their children are doing in their local communities in a way that I think really underscores why we need data

02:58:58.200 --> 02:59:11.200
and can't afford to wait. I do very much also agree, though, that we need as much flexibility as we can seek under the federal guidance.

02:59:11.200 --> 02:59:20.200
I have three very particular and discreet questions just about how implementation and what the space for innovation might look like.

02:59:20.200 --> 02:59:29.200
The first is what happens to the reliability of the data if we go below 95 percent, and that's sort of more on the technical question side.

02:59:29.200 --> 02:59:42.200
The second is around what sort of flexibility we can pursue or provide to local districts around who actually proctors the exams.

02:59:42.200 --> 02:59:53.200
I am very much, I think, impacted by hearing parents and teachers and school district leaders talk about precious instructional time, right?

02:59:53.200 --> 03:00:05.200
So many kids have been out of school and the remaining time in this school year, those are scarce and precious resources that we want to make sure that we use well.

03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:23.200
And so whether there is the potential for subs to proctor the exam so we don't lose the instructional time, whether it's potential for other school district staff and administrators or other instructional leaders to come in and provide the testing time,

03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:49.200
especially as we think about some of the offerings that have been made in terms of the state budget to extend the school year, to have summer learning time, to also extend into the July timeframe for testing so that our kids get the benefit of as much instructional exposure and time with teachers on instruction as possible and that we also pursue maximum flexibility in terms of what proctoring looks like.

03:00:50.200 --> 03:00:58.200
The last question or sort of concern that I just wanted to surface is around whether it's possible to bifurcate the timelines.

03:00:58.200 --> 03:01:12.200
It seems like there is a fairly decent split between proponents of a timeline for SBACs happening in the summer versus next fall.

03:01:12.200 --> 03:01:31.200
But I was very much influenced by the public comment around LPAC administration in the fall and wondering if there is a possibility of having a discrete timeline that does not actually determine both in the same one-shot board motion.

03:01:31.200 --> 03:01:39.200
Thank you very much. And I see that Rachel is on screen and ready to answer some of those questions.

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:59.200
Yes, thank you, President Darlene Hammond. So for the 95% question of what happens if we fall below the 95% to the validity and reliability of the assessment, I'm going to turn that over to Tony Alpert, the executive director of SBAC and Mary Ann, to share their initial thoughts.

03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:04.200
Tony?

03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:12.200
Thank you. So the validity and reliability is an important question.

03:02:12.200 --> 03:02:25.200
Smarter Balanced staff and members took a hard look at how we can reduce the length of the assessment and still retain the validity and reliability.

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:39.200
So at an individual student level, the test is reliable, will be reliable and valid, assuming it's administered consistent with the test administration manual.

03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:54.200
In the aggregate, it will be more reliable and consistently valid, assuming that there's a representative sample of students that participate.

03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:06.200
So to the extent that some students are systematically omitted or overly included, then that's going to affect the interpretation of the results.

03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:18.200
So they may have to be qualified in some way, but that's an analysis that needs to take place when the data come in. And I think Mary Ann can talk a little bit more about that.

03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:35.200
And to support or add a little bit more information as to what Tony mentioned, and I mentioned earlier, we do plan to do a thorough analysis of the process data to generate it from the summative assessments.

03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:42.200
And we'll use that to evaluate whether there are potential threats to the score validity.

03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:55.200
And more specifically, one of the things we are focusing on will be determining whether students experience technology challenges or if students received improper assistance during the assessment.

03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:11.200
And we'll take that analysis and use it to determine, make recommendations on the validity of the data.

03:04:11.200 --> 03:04:35.200
I'd just like to add a point on this question. I think it is because there are challenges across the country and the administration of assessments this year that there's been a strong consensus and the department's recommendations reflect the decoupling of the aggregate average assessment data from accountability.

03:04:35.200 --> 03:04:48.200
Because it's the averages that will vary, not the individual students results, unless there are problems in administration based on who can take the assessment.

03:04:48.200 --> 03:05:12.200
But there are ways to evaluate who does respond, and we actually in the government's letter to us, a need to report non-response by subpopulation characteristics of students as well, so that there's a way to evaluate what kind of information we're getting about which students.

03:05:12.200 --> 03:05:20.200
And we will need to be very analytical about that, as will every state.

03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:23.200
Were there other questions, Rachel, that you were going to answer?

03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:36.200
Yeah, we have two other ones. The second question was, who can proctor the exam? And Mao, would you like to, Dr. Vang, would you like to share the regulations around proctoring?

03:05:36.200 --> 03:06:03.200
Yes. Other than what Rachel has mentioned earlier in terms of the alternate assessments, having the test examiner be someone who the student knows and works with on a regular basis, in our CASP and LPAC regulations, the definition is that if you're an employee of the district and you have been trained and signed the test security

03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:13.200
affidavit, you may be a proctor for both assessments.

03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:39.200
And then the final question, I believe, Member Patio-Bronson, was in regards to the possibility of bifurcating timelines. And what I'm understanding you to ask, and please correct me if I'm wrong, is that can we explore the possibility, for example, of only extending the LPAC into the fall and having the rest of the assessments be completed in the spring?

03:06:39.200 --> 03:07:03.200
Okay, then yes, at the board's direction, we could explore that as a possibility. My understanding from ETS is that that would be significantly less cost, possibly somewhere between 15 to 20 million just for the summative LPAC to have an extension with a spring administration and then also with the possibility of a fall administration.

03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:09.200
Thank you. Member Fatah, you are up next.

03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:27.200
Thank you, President Darling-Cammond. And I just wanted to echo the, I guess, the equity challenges and I think the reliability of data. I think it's just going to be too frustrating for LEAs just to offer a student perspective on test security and the usage of these secure browsers.

03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:41.200
Just from my personal experience and the experience of numerous students, it's incredibly difficult to utilize secure browsers at home because computers tend to, first of all, not respond well to opening it up to their firewall.

03:07:41.200 --> 03:07:59.200
And also different computers require different ways of installing the secure browser. So, for example, someone might have a MacBook Pro and might need to take certain steps to be able to implement the, I guess, program to be able to take the test.

03:07:59.200 --> 03:08:15.200
And then someone might have a Chromebook, someone might have like a Razer laptop. And so all of these different laptops and kind of the necessities to install the secure browsers, I think going to create an incredible headache for LEAs to kind of decipher how to be able to, you know, administer testing.

03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:34.200
Just from my experience, I just can vividly recall at the beginning of this school year in my economics class, we had a similar situation where we practically spent the first 45 minutes of our first exam trying to figure out how everyone could take an exam via a secure browser.

03:08:34.200 --> 03:08:59.200
And at the end of the 45 minutes, my teacher just said, okay, we'll defer the test till another day. And we came in, we took it on an unsecured location. And so I think that just the headache that is going to arise for LEAs is just going to continue to, I guess, put everyone in this position that, first of all, detracts from learning and second of all, doesn't provide us with the reliable and the viable data that we want.

03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:20.200
At school, these are typically preloaded onto computers. And so when we hopefully do return to in-person, it will, you know, be there for us to be able to take the test. And I can just imagine the impact that this will have on taking away from the learning time because, you know, someone will, a student will show up to take the test one day.

03:09:20.200 --> 03:09:35.200
And then while they're kind of there, you know, in the moment ready to take the test, they'll find out, oh, you know, I don't know how to upload this to my firewall. And everyone else would have started the test and that student will have to return to class having already had their day interrupted.

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:44.200
And they will have to return again to be able to take the test. And so I think that it just takes away incredibly from the learning experience and opportunities from students.

03:09:44.200 --> 03:10:04.200
And then another point that I wanted to bring up was regarding a question that board member Rodriguez asked a little bit early on in today's discussion, which was regarding if we went to the fall assessment, the option that would require $74 million, would next year's seniors need to take the casp?

03:10:04.200 --> 03:10:19.200
To which point I believe Rachel responded with yes. And so I think my question kind of goes back to the overarching point that we're trying to decide on, which is making data actionable.

03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:33.200
And to which point, I think when we're assessing seniors and we're assessing students who are in their senior year of high school, and we get the data back in December or November, I don't think that the data becomes as actionable.

03:10:33.200 --> 03:10:43.200
When they only have six months of high school left, I think it's a lot more actionable if we were to take a different approach to testing and we're not to do it in the fall.

03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:55.200
And I think that the $74 million cost, just echoing what board members said earlier, can have a lot bigger of an impact than a single assessment and will be a lot more actionable if we take a different approach.

03:10:55.200 --> 03:10:59.200
And so for those reasons, I guess that's what I have to say.

03:11:00.200 --> 03:11:05.200
Thank you. It's wonderful to have an expert in our midst. We appreciate it.

03:11:05.200 --> 03:11:12.200
Member Rodriguez, and then member Patia Bronson, did you raise your hand again? Or is it just still up? Okay.

03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:16.200
So member Rodriguez, you may have the last word before we ask for a motion.

03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:21.200
Okay, that's a lot of pressure.

03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:34.200
You know, I think member Strauss and I are sort of like telepathically communicating because everything that you said, you know, you basically cut my comment short.

03:11:34.200 --> 03:11:48.200
And so I completely agree with you and I appreciate all of the comments that have already been stated and the tech problems with the testing that member Fatah just talked about.

03:11:48.200 --> 03:11:52.200
You know, we've been there with the AP testing and it has been very difficult.

03:11:52.200 --> 03:12:06.200
But that said, I want to, in 2001, right, the day before 9-11, we opened a school in East Palo Alto.

03:12:06.200 --> 03:12:14.200
And when we were, the teachers were getting ready to talk to the students about 9-11 and try to explain to them the following day.

03:12:14.200 --> 03:12:19.200
You know, and I was like facilitating a group conversation on terrorism.

03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:24.200
A student looked up at me and said, I don't care about what happened in New York.

03:12:24.200 --> 03:12:30.200
And I was just like, and she said, somebody just was killed in front of my house yesterday.

03:12:30.200 --> 03:12:36.200
And then I thought, yes, why that's like so far away.

03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:38.200
And this is happening in her home.

03:12:38.200 --> 03:12:48.200
And I was reminded of this yesterday when one of my students told me that she's lost four family members in the last month to COVID.

03:12:48.200 --> 03:12:51.200
And this is very real what our students are going through.

03:12:51.200 --> 03:12:58.200
And they're going through a post of traumatic stress, right, which will be post.

03:12:58.200 --> 03:13:01.200
But they're in the middle of like surviving.

03:13:02.200 --> 03:13:07.200
My students are scared about their parents, making sure that their parents stay alive.

03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:09.200
They have a lot of pressures right now.

03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:21.200
And I think that testing under these circumstances, you know, where they're at home taking an exam would just exacerbate the stress.

03:13:21.200 --> 03:13:30.200
A lot of my high school students are actually making sure that their little siblings tune into their Zoom classes and they're watching them.

03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:40.200
And they tell me I'm going to turn my camera off because I have, you know, my siblings are in the background and they're very conscientious when they lose their technology.

03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:43.200
They get super stressed out and send me a remind message.

03:13:43.200 --> 03:13:47.200
Like, I'm sorry, you know, just like member Bird did right now, right?

03:13:47.200 --> 03:13:52.200
You know, the stress like I'm letting somebody down is how they feel.

03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:54.200
And I just I don't want to add to their stress.

03:13:54.200 --> 03:14:20.200
And I and I fear that that having them test under these circumstances right now would, you know, and I'm all in favor of collecting data with, you know, what we have on school, what we've committed to at the at our school sites and producing it in a way that we can we can know where our students are and where we need to get them right.

03:14:20.200 --> 03:14:32.200
And where where where we may have some gaps and, you know, help them help them achieve and be able to fill those gaps.

03:14:32.200 --> 03:14:34.200
So I will close with that. Thank you.

03:14:34.200 --> 03:14:36.200
Thank you very much.

03:14:36.200 --> 03:14:39.200
And I see member Strauss's hand is raised.

03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:42.200
I'm hoping you might be ready to make a motion.

03:14:42.200 --> 03:14:43.200
I am.

03:14:43.200 --> 03:14:55.200
So what I'd like to do really is to summarize first some main themes that we've heard today that I've been taking notes on from both the presentation and the comments from board members.

03:14:55.200 --> 03:15:04.200
And then after that, I've asked staff to type up some recommended motions and appreciate what member Patio Bronson said is there's five separate motions.

03:15:04.200 --> 03:15:06.200
So you'll be able to see those as well.

03:15:06.200 --> 03:15:17.200
So for some areas of consensus that I think we're hearing, which is that California should pursue a waiver of accountability provisions and the 95 percent participation rate.

03:15:17.200 --> 03:15:21.200
The purpose of assessments is to gather data to guide teaching and learning and improving instructions.

03:15:21.200 --> 03:15:23.200
That's the first thing.

03:15:23.200 --> 03:15:33.200
No student should be required to come to school on just solely for the purpose of in-person testing and as per the federal guidance that was released on Monday the 22nd.

03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:39.200
And it's preferred that students take the annual summative assessment in person to ensure that the results are valid and reliable.

03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:52.200
And as the U.S. Department of Education acknowledges, some schools and some school districts may face circumstances in which they are not able to safely administer statewide summative assessments in person.

03:15:52.200 --> 03:16:07.200
So while the districts are beginning to come back for in-person instruction and we're working intently as a state to facilitate that occurring, some districts may not be back for in-person instruction until close to the end of the school year or even later.

03:16:07.200 --> 03:16:27.200
And even as districts are able to get back to school in person, there are some complex issues that they're working on ranging from managing new routines required by mitigation strategies to supporting students who are experiencing trauma in their lives and also seeking to understand and address the learning gaps.

03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:38.200
So we need to prioritize the use of time for assessments, focusing first on ELA and math and ensuring that English language learners can be assessed in the LPAC.

03:16:38.200 --> 03:16:42.200
The board has already approved a shortened assessment for math and English language arts.

03:16:42.200 --> 03:16:53.200
So we'd like CDE to explore with the test contractor other options to shorten the assessment, such as providing the option to locally administer the performance tasks in the classroom,

03:16:53.200 --> 03:16:59.200
which have really shortened testing time further for districts that might want to or need to pursue that option.

03:16:59.200 --> 03:17:14.200
We should also take up the U.S. Department of Education's offer to work with us to meet our needs and conditions as they have recognized that individual states like California may need additional assessment flexibility based on state specific circumstances,

03:17:15.200 --> 03:17:22.200
such as substantial majority of students who've engaged in remote learning throughout the entire 2021 school year.

03:17:22.200 --> 03:17:28.200
So because of some of these options are going to require approval by the legislature and or the governor.

03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:36.200
The goal is for the board to provide decision rules and options and to delegate authority to staff so we can move expeditiously.

03:17:36.200 --> 03:17:38.200
So with that, that's my background.

03:17:38.200 --> 03:17:52.200
I have five separate motions and I'm going to ask staff to share so you can see these have been tweaked based on the comments that we've heard and I think address the issues that we want to address each motion separately.

03:17:52.200 --> 03:18:00.200
There'll be five separate motions and then I will read it once you can see it.

03:18:00.200 --> 03:18:16.200
So motion one is to direct everybody see that I hope to direct CD to prepare a waiver consistent with the federal template regarding flexibilities offered by ED for accountability and school identification,

03:18:16.200 --> 03:18:30.200
which includes decoupling accountability from this year's assessments and waiving the requirement that the academic achievement indicator to be adjusted to account for a petition participation rate below 95%.

03:18:30.200 --> 03:18:32.200
So that's motion one.

03:18:32.200 --> 03:18:36.200
I present early him and I'll read all five and then we'll take them up individually.

03:18:36.200 --> 03:18:38.200
That's OK.

03:18:39.200 --> 03:19:00.200
Motion two is to extend the 2021 test administration window for both the CASP and LPAC from July 15 to July 30 if it proves necessary and add a second fall test administration window for the 2021 school year for the LPAC from August 15 to October 30.

03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:06.200
But that'll be contingent on the authorization of resources provided by the legislature and the governor.

03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:26.200
Motion three direct CD to prepare a general waiver of the California science test for 2021 school year, recognizing that students have mostly been remote and not in school, working on our new science standards with aligned materials and how hard it's been to teach science remotely.

03:19:26.200 --> 03:19:41.200
Motion four direct CD to pursue the option for districts that would like to do so of locally administering the CASP math and ELA performance tests in the classroom so they can reduce the testing time for the 2021 school year.

03:19:41.200 --> 03:20:10.200
And finally, motion five, delegate the authority to the SBE executive director in collaboration with CD staff to develop guidelines to ensure the use of data from state approved assessments measuring California standards to provide valid and reliable information to parents about their children's progress and to inform instructional decisions and targeting of resources to support student learning in local education agencies.

03:20:10.200 --> 03:20:20.200
This is important where pupils have not been in person instructional settings long enough to appropriately assess them using the state summative assessments.

03:20:20.200 --> 03:20:29.200
So those are the five separate motions. I'll turn it back to President Darling-Hammond for clarification on each and maybe we take them up one at a time.

03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:41.200
Wow, so that's a that's quite a mouthful. I'm sure people need to adjust all that for a moment. May I ask a couple of questions about intent in some of these?

03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:54.200
Just so that everyone will have a shared understanding of what your idea is and then I see that there's a number of Rutgers hands is up and there'll be some other hands that come up, I'm sure.

03:20:54.200 --> 03:21:15.200
With respect to the it seems to me that an underlying assumption behind this is that while some districts might be able to do some remote testing that we should not be relying on that as a primary way to do assessment.

03:21:15.200 --> 03:21:29.200
Is that am I correct in that assumption? Yeah, that's correct that we would assume that students come back to school and have several weeks before being given an assessment in person that that would then be valid and reliable.

03:21:29.200 --> 03:21:39.200
So motion five addresses if students are not able to have a valid an assessment situation, then this is the backup for those LEAs that aren't able to.

03:21:39.200 --> 03:21:49.200
Then I'm assuming that the diagnostic and benchmark assessments that districts have been using that were mapped to our standards that we approved are the ones that you're thinking about there.

03:21:49.200 --> 03:22:05.200
The number five is for the local continuity learning continuity plan that districts already had approved by their county office that they would use that data providing parents support and information if they are unable to provide a valid and reliable in person assessment.

03:22:05.200 --> 03:22:19.200
Just to make a comment, I did hear other board members saying how important it is for whatever data we're making available to be publicly available beyond the parents, so that may be another piece of that question.

03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:39.200
And you asked earlier, who was it that said that kids should be back in school for three or four weeks before assessment? And I didn't answer them, but Scott Marion is the head of the Center for Assessment, and he they make that recommendation, so that's where that came from.

03:22:39.200 --> 03:22:58.200
Another question I have just for clarification on the science test. Is it your assumption that because we don't have a shorter version of that or a backup version of that, that that's why you would make that motion?

03:22:58.200 --> 03:23:15.200
That's a really hard motion. I'm one of the liaisons for NGSS and the science implementation, and we worked so hard since 2014 to get our new standards and implementation, but districts didn't even fully purchase their aligned science materials before the shutdown happened.

03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:30.200
And teachers have worked really struggled to try to provide science in a limited instructional minutes, and so it seems like that one might be worth just delaying a year to get a real valid experience once students are back in class.

03:23:30.200 --> 03:23:45.200
And I assume, so thank you. I just, I'm sure that other people will ask questions about other ones that they need to understand more fully. So in terms of who I have here on the screen, I have member Rucker and then member Navo and then member Burr.

03:23:45.200 --> 03:24:05.200
Okay, so I mean, first of all, I want to thank you for working, paying attention to the conversation that happened and especially listening to my request for us to try to divide these motions to take them up one at a time.

03:24:05.200 --> 03:24:20.200
I would also like to request, if possible, that the board members receive an email of these motions so that I can actually have them to hold onto and read as we go through and do the voting. So I have a few questions, starting with...

03:24:20.200 --> 03:24:30.200
Can I just ask quickly before you launch into the other questions, is that possible to do? I think I'm probably asking the staff.

03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:33.200
Yes, Linda, we'll make sure it gets done right now.

03:24:33.200 --> 03:24:35.200
Okay, thank you. Go ahead, member Rucker.

03:24:35.200 --> 03:24:59.200
Okay, so starting with the link between motion one and motion five. So motion one is contemplating using the state assessments in the CASP to be consistent with the application that we would be submitting for the federal template. Is that correct?

03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:10.200
My comment, member Rucker, is to deal with the 95% issue. That's what that's for.

03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:31.200
Okay, but that's not my question. My question is, are the tests that you're talking about that would be reported that states would be, the districts would be allowed to ignore the 95% participation rate? Are the tests the students would be participating and taking the tests that are in the CASP?

03:25:31.200 --> 03:25:32.200
Yes.

03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:36.200
Okay, so go ahead. Go ahead, Dr. Dunham.

03:25:36.200 --> 03:25:44.200
I think I just learned that Rachel may have a comment on one of these questions. Is that right?

03:25:44.200 --> 03:25:51.200
I can, President Darling-Hammond, I can save my comment. It's just a clarifying piece for motion two and I can wait until we get to that place.

03:25:51.200 --> 03:25:54.200
Thank you very much. Go ahead, member Rucker.

03:25:54.200 --> 03:26:10.200
Okay, so then as it relates to the linkage between motion one and motion five, the guidance letter says whatever statewide assessment we give, that information has to be posted as well.

03:26:10.200 --> 03:26:20.200
So it seems to me you're giving some duplicate reporting responsibilities as it relates to the purpose of this waiver to states.

03:26:20.200 --> 03:26:37.200
They are all, districts are already supposed to be collecting the information related to these local assessments and using that to inform how they frame, revise or update their LCAP or the learning continuity plan.

03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:45.200
So I'm not sure where the reporting as it's related to what you discussed in item five, where that actually is going.

03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:54.200
Are you only reporting it for the local purposes or is this reporting in any way related to the waiver itself for motion number five?

03:26:54.200 --> 03:27:08.200
So as part of your question, member Rucker, whether the use of those assessments for providing data to parents would also be reported to at the district or state level?

03:27:08.200 --> 03:27:10.200
That's what I'm asking, yes.

03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:14.200
Okay. I just want to be sure I understood the question.

03:27:14.200 --> 03:27:19.200
Yeah, that's what I'm asking. And thank you for asking it, putting it in a better way. I appreciate that.

03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:24.200
I'm not caring when I tell you I'm a little confused.

03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:25.200
Yeah.

03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:34.200
So I'll answer and then I think President Darley-Amedore, Dr. Mays might be able to answer.

03:27:34.200 --> 03:27:43.200
But the intent on number five is if you're not able to give the state assessment in person in a reasonable way to get valid information,

03:27:43.200 --> 03:27:49.200
then you revert to the assessments that you've already gotten approved in your learning continuity plan.

03:27:49.200 --> 03:28:00.200
Now, those I don't believe would be reported, but they would be reported to parents on how students were doing, but not in the state data system.

03:28:00.200 --> 03:28:06.200
So I'm going to restate. I mean, I'm going to rephrase what I think I heard you say.

03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:12.200
So this is so with this collection of five waivers, the link between waiver one and waiver two is this.

03:28:12.200 --> 03:28:23.200
You're creating some flexibility for districts that are say the 52 of the 58 districts that are in purple and currently closed and cannot give in-person assessments.

03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:33.200
You're giving them an option to use something other than the statewide assessments to collect information about the performance of students on English language arts and mathematics.

03:28:33.200 --> 03:28:35.200
Is that correct?

03:28:35.200 --> 03:28:43.200
If they are unable to return in person in enough time to administer prior to July.

03:28:43.200 --> 03:28:56.200
OK, so but if but for the districts that do return for in-person assessments, in-person instruction in time to give this within the window that we're contemplating extending,

03:28:56.200 --> 03:29:03.200
they would give the state assessments, the CASP assessments. Is that correct?

03:29:03.200 --> 03:29:10.200
Is that correct? That is correct. So that would mean if I voted yes on motion one and yes on motion five,

03:29:10.200 --> 03:29:16.200
there is a possibility that we can have districts as a result of this testing window this year,

03:29:16.200 --> 03:29:24.200
giving two different types of assessments to their students to address the waiver that we've asked the feds to approve.

03:29:24.200 --> 03:29:29.200
Is that is that correct? I don't understand that.

03:29:29.200 --> 03:29:34.200
No, no, it's my understanding under this proposal.

03:29:34.200 --> 03:29:44.200
And again, President Darley Hammond can clarify or executive director can is that if students are back in person in enough time to give a reliable test,

03:29:44.200 --> 03:29:51.200
that's what they give if they aren't able to return in enough time to give the valid and reliable tests,

03:29:51.200 --> 03:29:57.200
then they use the local the data that was already approved in their local learning continuity plan.

03:29:57.200 --> 03:30:06.200
So they if they gave the assessment during the spring window all the way to July, they wouldn't they that would be what they would be reporting.

03:30:06.200 --> 03:30:12.200
And again, I would ask staff to follow up on member records clarification question.

03:30:12.200 --> 03:30:19.200
Yes, that's why I'm confused. Yeah. So I'll stop and see if somebody else can ask the question better,

03:30:19.200 --> 03:30:29.200
because it seems to me, for example, if and if I have anybody on this listening to this who's from the districts I'm about to name,

03:30:29.200 --> 03:30:38.200
please don't get mad with me. So if Elk Grove Unified School District has returned fully to in-person instruction,

03:30:38.200 --> 03:30:49.200
motion one would require them to give the CAF, the SBAC assessment. Is that correct? Is that correct, Board Member Strauss?

03:30:49.200 --> 03:30:59.200
That is what the motion states. OK. But if they're dealing with the 90 reducing the participation rate below 95 percent,

03:30:59.200 --> 03:31:06.200
that's what the intent of motion one is. OK, so that's my that's where I'm confused.

03:31:06.200 --> 03:31:15.200
So I live in Placer County. So if the district where I live in Placer County is not able to return the full time in-person instruction,

03:31:15.200 --> 03:31:25.200
they would have this flexibility on how they administer the state assessment that a district like Elk Grove would not have,

03:31:25.200 --> 03:31:32.200
because they're going to be using the state assessment and they will not be able to use it in the way that Elk Grove will.

03:31:32.200 --> 03:31:39.200
That's why I'm confused. It seems like these two different motions are creating two different sets of permissions for districts.

03:31:39.200 --> 03:31:44.200
I'm not sure that's what we're trying to do. That's why I'm confused.

03:31:44.200 --> 03:31:55.200
I don't know all the details of what is possible in this context, but I know that Rachel was waiting to give some clarification on at least one point.

03:31:55.200 --> 03:32:00.200
So I would suggest that we should get that clarification.

03:32:00.200 --> 03:32:05.200
I think I mean, Eileen, you can clarify the intent.

03:32:05.200 --> 03:32:16.200
The intent is, as I read it, was that in the law, there's a requirement to get information every year to parents about their children and their progress.

03:32:16.200 --> 03:32:22.200
And if it's not possible to give that information from the state summative test,

03:32:22.200 --> 03:32:30.200
because the conditions for giving that test are not appropriate for the context of that,

03:32:30.200 --> 03:32:41.200
the use of other assessment data would be to meet that aspect of the law is what would be recommended.

03:32:41.200 --> 03:32:48.200
Am I on track with that, Eileen? And then there's the question of whether you reported beyond that.

03:32:48.200 --> 03:32:56.200
And I think that's a separate question that we need to take up, you know, after we get the first question straight.

03:32:56.200 --> 03:33:00.200
President Darlene Hammond, can I clarify one piece of that?

03:33:00.200 --> 03:33:09.200
So in the letter, it makes it pretty clear that it has not waived the requirement to report out your data in the SARC.

03:33:09.200 --> 03:33:17.200
So regardless if you use a local assessment or you use the summative,

03:33:17.200 --> 03:33:24.200
that requirement still stands that you would report that information within the SARC and also to parents.

03:33:24.200 --> 03:33:35.200
The second piece that I just wanted to clarify quickly for Motion 2, and I apologize if I didn't make this clear earlier,

03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:50.200
we cannot offer for the assessments to go through July 30th for the LPAC and for the and offer a fall administration window as well.

03:33:50.200 --> 03:34:00.200
There's not enough time for our contractor to be able to turn over the assessment information with a new year of data,

03:34:00.200 --> 03:34:11.200
because remember, they have to close out the school year from 2021 and then have another school year with new student information from 21-22.

03:34:11.200 --> 03:34:18.200
So to go from July 30th and then only have potentially a 15-day window isn't enough time.

03:34:18.200 --> 03:34:23.200
So it can't be an and both. It has to be an either or.

03:34:23.200 --> 03:34:27.200
Okay, that's an important point for us to clarify.

03:34:27.200 --> 03:34:30.200
So then that clarifies the information I was asking for.

03:34:30.200 --> 03:34:38.200
So as it relates to Motion 1 and Motion 5, what I would like to ask is why can't we, for both motions,

03:34:38.200 --> 03:34:49.200
allow the ask the feds to give us the flexibility to use the local assessments that all districts already have to use as part of their LPAC?

03:34:49.200 --> 03:34:53.200
Because because those are considered those have been adopted by the board.

03:34:53.200 --> 03:34:55.200
Those are valid and reliable.

03:34:55.200 --> 03:35:04.200
All districts, including charter schools, use those alternative assessments and those local assessments regularly now and can administer them,

03:35:04.200 --> 03:35:08.200
whether we are using them virtually or for in-person instruction.

03:35:08.200 --> 03:35:20.200
And it seems like those assessments as a class of assessments would solve the burden issues and the timeline and delivery issues, both for Motion 1 and Motion 5.

03:35:20.200 --> 03:35:28.200
So that's a very deep question, which I want to put a pin in and come back around to.

03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:31.200
I just want to ask that question. Thank you very much.

03:35:31.200 --> 03:35:36.200
Because it would imply having no statewide data.

03:35:36.200 --> 03:35:39.200
So that that would be the question about that.

03:35:39.200 --> 03:35:43.200
So I'm going to move I think next we have.

03:35:43.200 --> 03:35:46.200
Did I call who was going to come next? I can't recall.

03:35:46.200 --> 03:35:48.200
I don't think so. All right.

03:35:48.200 --> 03:35:51.200
I'm just going to go across my list here.

03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:58.200
Member Patio Bronson, Member Sun, Member Navo, Member Burr, and then Member Glover-Woods.

03:35:58.200 --> 03:36:04.200
I have a couple of questions just about how this would work mechanically.

03:36:04.200 --> 03:36:17.200
Because there are CADA or T-CADA 12 districts that may open for elementary and have in-person instruction.

03:36:17.200 --> 03:36:28.200
But I think it's an eventuality or at least a possibility that some of those same districts may not open for upper grade, middle school and high school in person.

03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:31.200
I'm very much hoping that we get there anyway.

03:36:31.200 --> 03:36:43.200
But just trying to figure out how would that essentially give rise to the situation that Board Member Rucker was describing where elementary students might be required to do the CASP,

03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:48.200
but their junior high or middle school and high school students might not.

03:36:48.200 --> 03:37:06.200
I also wanted to pick up on the thread that Board President Darling-Hammond described of parent facing data as distinct from public facing data and whether there's state level data that would not just be available to parents who I think are absolutely a critical audience.

03:37:06.200 --> 03:37:23.200
But also whether the data that is made available to parents is something that they would have to actually hunt around for in the SARC to find or whether it would go directly to parents as is the case with SBAC data.

03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:49.200
Also on the state level question, and this is maybe more of a descriptive question, for the existing validated data sources that the SBE has already approved previously around sort of data collection that's short of CASP data,

03:37:49.200 --> 03:38:07.200
would there be an effort under Motion 5 for there to be some almost preferred data sources that are more consistently used across LEAs so that you could actually see trend and differentiation between LEAs?

03:38:07.200 --> 03:38:32.200
I think a lot of the audience that we think about is sometimes local and sometimes it is our state legislative partners who want to know if across the board school districts are seeing big gaps or whether it's just one district using one data source that looks pretty good so that you can have some comparability across districts.

03:38:32.200 --> 03:38:48.200
And then the last question on Motion 5, I'm just assuming but would love to have it named explicitly that the data that would be provided at the district or LEA level would be disaggregated data.

03:38:48.200 --> 03:39:04.200
So you can see racial trends and socioeconomic trends so that once we get to the stage of thinking about learning acceleration into 2022 that we know where to be laser focused and targeted.

03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:07.200
That was a lot of questions.

03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:26.200
I'm going to just make one comment that if Rachel or others want to or Eileen wants to clarify anything in her motion, which is that we have recently received the aggregated reports from the core districts that used a number of those assessments.

03:39:26.200 --> 03:39:41.200
Some of you may have seen one version of the study that PACE did using those data, but other reports have come in since then that have been able to show the aggregated data at the district level because it's in their student data set.

03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:56.200
Presumably every student is identified with the score that they received, so it's conceivable and would seem to me likely that you could report that certainly at the district level in a disaggregated way.

03:39:56.200 --> 03:40:01.200
And they were able to report across districts because they had assembled that data set.

03:40:01.200 --> 03:40:17.200
I'm not sure whether that would be routinely possible because that was available only because of the core consortium, but reporting in a disaggregated way at the district level should be possible when you have a district wide test.

03:40:17.200 --> 03:40:37.200
They were able to report that by grade level, by socioeconomically disadvantaged, by race and ethnicity, by language background, and that is something that is routine in a data set where you would locate test scores with student records.

03:40:37.200 --> 03:40:43.200
Just to clarify that one piece that I understood.

03:40:43.200 --> 03:40:48.200
Rachel, did you want to add anything to any of those questions?

03:40:48.200 --> 03:40:53.200
No, I don't think so, not at this time.

03:40:53.200 --> 03:41:03.200
I'm going to go to, is that okay, Member Pichero-Bronson? That's what we've got it right now. I think we'll have to go to Member Sun.

03:41:03.200 --> 03:41:04.200
Thank you.

03:41:04.200 --> 03:41:28.200
So, yeah, just I'm pursuing a bit the trend that Member Rucker was going down with Motion 1 and 5 and the potential bifurcation of schools that open earlier, being required to take the full CASP and then allowing districts that open later to use the local assessments.

03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:45.200
I just, I think we set up a situation where we're desensitizing in some ways schools from opening earlier because then they would have to be under this onus of taking the full CASP or the CASP exam, and I just don't think that is how we want to set this up.

03:41:45.200 --> 03:42:02.200
So I think we have to face that if we are, that we're either going to have state data or we're going to have local data, and I don't think we can try to separate the two or try to bifurcate this.

03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:08.200
I don't think it would set up a system that is fair and equitable across.

03:42:08.200 --> 03:42:22.200
So I'm really, I'm frustrated, not with anyone, just the situation that we are in, and I do find it unacceptable not to have statewide data until 2022.

03:42:22.200 --> 03:42:50.200
So I'm not quite sure I can go through each of these motions and there are aspects of it that I would go for, but I feel we haven't had enough time to explore all the options and what some of the technical aspects would be for administering or having some kind of a statewide assessment pulse before spring of 2022.

03:42:50.200 --> 03:42:56.200
If we were to waive spring of 21.

03:42:56.200 --> 03:43:05.200
Yeah, thank you. I don't know if anyone wants to respond to that or we'll just we'll get we'll keep all the comments going and then we'll come back around to them.

03:43:05.200 --> 03:43:12.200
Amber Burr.

03:43:12.200 --> 03:43:14.200
Wrong button, I apologize.

03:43:14.200 --> 03:43:19.200
So I'm probably as confused as I hear other people being.

03:43:19.200 --> 03:43:26.200
And so I, I guess I'm going to I'm going to try that let's kick the can down the road approach.

03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:30.200
We have another meeting in three weeks.

03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:44.200
We just got the federal guidance, two days ago and as everyone has said and I neglected to say the department staff and the board staff have done a Herculean effort in pulling together what they have in two days.

03:43:44.200 --> 03:43:51.200
But I think is comments that have been shared by all of my colleagues indicate.

03:43:51.200 --> 03:43:58.200
This is an unbelievably complex problem. It's very hard to unravel everything.

03:43:58.200 --> 03:44:06.200
I think it's very hard to come up with a solution on the fly, which is what we're trying to do.

03:44:06.200 --> 03:44:19.200
I don't I think you know from my comments, I'm not supportive of having a test administration, a state level test administration, given all of the issues that many of us have already identified.

03:44:19.200 --> 03:44:22.200
And so I can't support some of these motions for that reason.

03:44:22.200 --> 03:44:25.200
Number two, motion two, for example.

03:44:25.200 --> 03:44:32.200
Honestly, I think motion five is written in such a way as to be almost incomprehensible.

03:44:32.200 --> 03:44:35.200
It doesn't clearly state what I heard.

03:44:35.200 --> 03:44:42.200
Board member Strauss and I know in her heart she believes that kids need to be back in person in order to administer the test.

03:44:42.200 --> 03:44:48.200
But that just doesn't work with these other ones where they're kind of interrelated to me.

03:44:48.200 --> 03:44:59.200
So I guess I would like to offer for consideration had given the staff some time to go back and take a deep breath and go, OK, we've heard what everyone had to say.

03:44:59.200 --> 03:45:08.200
We understand what the input is primarily from the field and from our our stake, other stakeholder groups.

03:45:08.200 --> 03:45:13.200
And let us think about this for a week or two. I think that there's no rush.

03:45:13.200 --> 03:45:27.200
I was really worried about the rush, but if we just open essentially the testing window on Monday, I don't know that waiting a couple of weeks when 90 percent of our kids are not even back in person is going to make that much different.

03:45:27.200 --> 03:45:32.200
So I just like to put that out there as an option for us to consider.

03:45:32.200 --> 03:45:37.200
Thank you. Member Navo.

03:45:37.200 --> 03:45:43.200
And I'm sorry, I'm going to have to to jump in from here and jump back on, but I I wanted to get some thoughts down.

03:45:43.200 --> 03:45:53.200
So with regarding the motion, what I I agree with a board member Burr, you know, I really feel at this point that there's a.

03:45:53.200 --> 03:46:00.200
If we're listening to our constituents, we've got to have a motion somewhere in there for a blanket waiver to state testing.

03:46:00.200 --> 03:46:13.200
And I feel like it's maybe a little bit more simple for me and certainly not necessarily correct, but it seems like we have to give the field some kind of direction.

03:46:13.200 --> 03:46:20.200
So it's either pursue a motion to pursue a blanket waiver from testing.

03:46:20.200 --> 03:46:30.200
That's one option, a motion to pursue full flexibilities around testing administration with an extended window of some sort to at least July 30th.

03:46:30.200 --> 03:46:40.200
I think if locals understand the complexities and the cost associated with doing a fall administration, I think their opinions might be different.

03:46:40.200 --> 03:46:49.200
And to the extent that either one of those come together, we anchor to we're going to take our ass back.

03:46:49.200 --> 03:46:59.200
And we do the best we can as a state to complicate it with bifurcated systems, some using local measures, some using state measures.

03:46:59.200 --> 03:47:02.200
I think, yeah, we do create a lot more problems.

03:47:02.200 --> 03:47:07.200
So if I was sitting in a local seat and I'm listening to the conversation, I'm listening to three options I have.

03:47:07.200 --> 03:47:13.200
I have one, a motion for a blanket waiver that the feds are highly likely to not approve.

03:47:13.200 --> 03:47:23.200
Two, a motion for full extended flexibilities with the best I can do as an extended waiver to July 31st for testing if they don't approve the blanket waiver.

03:47:23.200 --> 03:47:28.200
And three, we all anchor in and take the ass back.

03:47:28.200 --> 03:47:33.200
And with whatever other motions of flexibility we need.

03:47:33.200 --> 03:47:48.200
But I really feel like at this point that in the best interest of students in the state of California, at this at this point in juncture in time where we sit, that I can't help but feel that it's not in their best interest to test them.

03:47:48.200 --> 03:47:53.200
It's in other people's best interest to test them because we need data.

03:47:53.200 --> 03:48:03.200
But what they're focused on and what families are focused on and what certainly most educators would be focused on is the reentry and recovery of students as they reenter school.

03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:07.200
So for me, I lean heavily with board member Burr.

03:48:07.200 --> 03:48:13.200
And unless I missed it, board member Strauss, I didn't see a motion for an option for the blanket waiver.

03:48:13.200 --> 03:48:15.200
And I'd like to at least consider that.

03:48:15.200 --> 03:48:21.200
And with that, board member Linda Darlin-Hammond, I'm going to have to jump and jump back on unfortunately.

03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:26.200
Okay, we'll ask you more questions when you jump back on.

03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:29.200
Member Glover-Woods.

03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:36.200
I just thank member Novo as he's jumped off for really articulating what I was thinking as well.

03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:46.200
I do have a concern based on the conversations that we've had with just the ambiguity and who would give a state assessment and who would use local assessments.

03:48:46.200 --> 03:48:56.200
I think we open up just a can of worms for a lot of confusion and trouble in a time that's already confusing.

03:48:56.200 --> 03:49:04.200
What we've heard overwhelmingly is the desire for the pursuit of a blanket waiver.

03:49:04.200 --> 03:49:12.200
As member Novo I think again very eloquently said, it would seem that it's almost a tiered approach.

03:49:12.200 --> 03:49:15.200
Approach and submit a blanket waiver.

03:49:15.200 --> 03:49:30.200
If that is denied, then look at the other option that is available, which if it is denied, it looks like the only other option would be to administer either extend the testing window or administer in the fall.

03:49:30.200 --> 03:49:43.200
And based on the comments and based upon the information that's been prepared by CDE staff, it seems that the extension of the testing window would be better than trying to do a fall administration.

03:49:43.200 --> 03:49:57.200
While I appreciate again the complexity of the decisions that need to be made, thus the complexity of the motions we have before us, I think it creates a lot of confusion.

03:49:57.200 --> 03:50:01.200
And I would be concerned if we're not able to simplify and be more direct.

03:50:01.200 --> 03:50:16.200
If we are indeed going to take up any of the motions today, that we're going to create more confusion in the field and we're going to move away from the original intent of this conversation, which is what to do best for students.

03:50:16.200 --> 03:50:21.200
Can I just inquire?

03:50:21.200 --> 03:50:25.200
Well, I'll come back about the point that you're making.

03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:36.200
I think a question I would have if we were to be asking for a blanket waiver at this point and waiting for the response is, first of all, the department has signaled that they're not inviting those waivers.

03:50:36.200 --> 03:50:39.200
So there's not likely to be a positive response.

03:50:39.200 --> 03:50:48.200
Would we jeopardize districts even further in the timeline that they've asked us to get clarity on for them?

03:50:48.200 --> 03:51:02.200
So I think there's a really important point about the ambiguity of number five, but there's other ambiguity created by a solution that takes us too much further down the road time wise.

03:51:02.200 --> 03:51:05.200
Member Patio-Bronson?

03:51:05.200 --> 03:51:07.200
Sorry, I know.

03:51:07.200 --> 03:51:09.200
Still off.

03:51:09.200 --> 03:51:14.200
Member Rucker?

03:51:14.200 --> 03:51:16.200
Yes.

03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:33.200
Let me just say again, I think that I agree, I absolutely agree with Board President Darling-Hammond that the plain language of the letter states that the feds are not inviting blanket waivers.

03:51:33.200 --> 03:51:53.200
But the language in the waiver in the letter also says that they do not want to see states creating a proposal that will simply bring students back to school for the purpose of taking the test, that they will consider in the waiver request the conditions that exist in the state.

03:51:53.200 --> 03:52:02.200
In California, 52 of 58 county office counties in our state are in the purple.

03:52:02.200 --> 03:52:22.200
So rather than just simply saying we need a complete waiver, we should state that we need the flexibility to waive the assessment requirement in those counties where it is clearly not recommended that schools should reopen solely for the purpose of bringing students back to school.

03:52:22.200 --> 03:52:33.200
That falls far short of a blanket waiver, but it gives us the ability to maximize the kind of flexibility we can ask for.

03:52:33.200 --> 03:53:02.200
None of these motions contemplate that as a consideration, and I do believe the feds will look seriously at that for us because the architecture of designating those colors, designating those safety conditions, and doing the scenario evaluations for those levels and that status, that was scientifically and publicly done to affect all public entities, not just schools.

03:53:02.200 --> 03:53:06.200
So I think that that is something that the feds should be asked to consider.

03:53:06.200 --> 03:53:10.200
I think that that will solve some of the flexibility issues we have.

03:53:10.200 --> 03:53:27.200
It will still fall within the confines of addressing definitely the 95% participation rate waiver, but I think we need to contemplate how to maximize given flexibility in the local context because there are just going to be some schools that can't do this.

03:53:27.200 --> 03:53:37.200
And the letter and the plain language of the letter clearly says we can make a case and frame what our state conditions are.

03:53:37.200 --> 03:53:41.200
These motions currently do not do that.

03:53:41.200 --> 03:53:43.200
So thank you, Member Rucker.

03:53:43.200 --> 03:53:56.200
I actually think that that's probably the intention of number five, which is confusing now, and you've suggested proposing some just objective standards for where that flexibility would be.

03:53:56.200 --> 03:54:01.200
And I think that's a useful idea for us to take up.

03:54:01.200 --> 03:54:06.200
I think I just heard a voice, so I want to be sure if somebody was trying to get in.

03:54:06.200 --> 03:54:08.200
It's Rachel.

03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:16.200
Can I just offer maybe three thoughts, two for consideration, that may be helpful for the discussion.

03:54:16.200 --> 03:54:25.200
One is just for consideration, a blanket waiver, if we submit one, would take months for us to find out if it was approved or not.

03:54:25.200 --> 03:54:31.200
So I think the timing of that we would need to consider.

03:54:31.200 --> 03:54:36.200
And to your point, it's been made pretty clear that a blanket waiver would not be approved.

03:54:36.200 --> 03:54:38.200
So that's one piece for consideration.

03:54:38.200 --> 03:54:49.200
I think the second piece for consideration, and I think it was Member Navo that I heard say this, the idea of administering the summatives and everyone just do the best that you can.

03:54:49.200 --> 03:54:58.200
That's where the majority of the states that we are hearing are moving forward, understanding the context and that everyone is just going to do the best that they can.

03:54:58.200 --> 03:55:00.200
So for what that's worth.

03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:15.200
The final thing that I thought as I'm listening to the conversation, it sounds like the majority of the angst or the questions are coming up around the ELA and the math assessments.

03:55:15.200 --> 03:55:23.200
So I'm wondering if it's possible for us to identify if there's some commonality or agreement in some of the other areas.

03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:36.200
So for example, when you look at motion one, it really is just express expressly decoupling any sort of accountability from assessments, regardless of what assessments we give.

03:55:36.200 --> 03:55:44.200
So I think that there might be some from everything I've heard, at least a desire to move in that direction.

03:55:44.200 --> 03:55:50.200
And that doesn't necessarily require that we define what that looks like yet.

03:55:50.200 --> 03:55:54.200
The second piece is for the science waiver that's been proposed.

03:55:54.200 --> 03:55:59.200
And I think that that might be something that that you could look at having a motion for.

03:55:59.200 --> 03:56:04.200
And then the third piece would be specifically for the LPAC.

03:56:04.200 --> 03:56:14.200
Is that something that you want to potentially explore providing a fall administration option to or going to July 30th?

03:56:14.200 --> 03:56:24.200
So for what it's worth, I just thought from everything that I'm hearing, maybe we could be able to find some some commonality within those areas.

03:56:24.200 --> 03:56:37.200
If we parse it that way, what the remaining then major question is, is whether we adopt the approach that, as you said, many states are taking, which is, you know, just do the best you can.

03:56:37.200 --> 03:56:50.200
And for states, I know I talked to the Texas commissioner yesterday, you know, they're they're also ruling out remote assessment because of all the problems we've heard about.

03:56:50.200 --> 03:57:01.200
And they're just saying when you're in person, do the best you can to give the assessment where it's possible to give it and to the students who are available to take it.

03:57:01.200 --> 03:57:04.200
So that's one strategy.

03:57:04.200 --> 03:57:22.200
Another strategy is to have some flexibility around objective measure, as member Rucker was suggesting that has to do with availability for in-person education and assessment.

03:57:22.200 --> 03:57:36.200
The third possibility would be to ask for the diagnostic assessments to be used across the board, and we would be essentially saying we would not have statewide data.

03:57:36.200 --> 03:57:44.200
So I think those are really, as far as I can tell, the buckets into which the others fall.

03:57:44.200 --> 03:57:53.200
And maybe what we should do is take a break for about 15 minutes, let us figure out how to frame up the, you know, the options.

03:57:53.200 --> 03:58:06.200
Rachel, that was extremely helpful to sort of identify where I think we may have some easy things to check off and then look at those other buckets.

03:58:06.200 --> 03:58:09.200
And we could make the judgment.

03:58:09.200 --> 03:58:16.200
I think the fourth option, as member Burr said, is to wait until the March meeting that is three plus weeks away.

03:58:16.200 --> 03:58:21.200
I do think that the field wants some direction and needs some direction.

03:58:21.200 --> 03:58:27.200
But, you know, we can decide whether that's a viable option as well.

03:58:27.200 --> 03:58:29.200
So why don't we take 15 minutes?

03:58:29.200 --> 03:58:33.200
It's 1235 or maybe even 20 minutes.

03:58:33.200 --> 03:58:34.200
Let's give ourselves 20 minutes.

03:58:34.200 --> 03:58:48.200
You might even be able to grab a half of the sandwich and come back and we'll figure out which options we can take up today and what we need to plot until later.

03:58:48.200 --> 03:58:50.200
Don't leave the room.

03:58:50.200 --> 03:58:58.200
Just turn off your camera.

03:58:58.200 --> 03:59:02.200
To reestablish the quorum.

03:59:02.200 --> 03:59:07.200
Of course, member Burr.

03:59:07.200 --> 03:59:09.200
President Darling-Hammond.

03:59:09.200 --> 03:59:10.200
Here.

03:59:10.200 --> 03:59:12.200
Member Fatah.

03:59:12.200 --> 03:59:13.200
Here.

03:59:13.200 --> 03:59:15.200
Member Glover-Woods.

03:59:15.200 --> 03:59:16.200
Here.

03:59:16.200 --> 03:59:18.200
Member McQuillan.

03:59:18.200 --> 03:59:19.200
Here.

03:59:19.200 --> 03:59:21.200
Member Navo.

03:59:21.200 --> 03:59:22.200
Here.

03:59:22.200 --> 03:59:24.200
Member Patil-Brownson.

03:59:24.200 --> 03:59:25.200
Here.

03:59:25.200 --> 03:59:26.200
Member Rodriguez.

03:59:26.200 --> 03:59:27.200
Here.

03:59:27.200 --> 03:59:29.200
Member Rucker.

03:59:29.200 --> 03:59:30.200
Here.

03:59:30.200 --> 03:59:32.200
President Strauss.

03:59:32.200 --> 03:59:33.200
Here.

03:59:33.200 --> 03:59:34.200
Member Son.

03:59:34.200 --> 03:59:35.200
Here.

03:59:35.200 --> 03:59:36.200
Member Burr.

03:59:36.200 --> 03:59:37.200
Here.

03:59:37.200 --> 03:59:41.200
Everyone's present and accounted for.

03:59:41.200 --> 03:59:43.200
Okay.

03:59:43.200 --> 03:59:59.200
I would like to see if Rachel would be willing to review, since we had some board members who are out for a moment, the three things that you felt we should move forward on immediately or could potentially,

03:59:59.200 --> 04:00:04.200
and then I'll redefine the buckets that are left, and then we'll proceed with the conversation.

04:00:04.200 --> 04:00:05.200
Okay.

04:00:05.200 --> 04:00:06.200
That sounds great.

04:00:06.200 --> 04:00:18.200
So from the conversation, as I had shared before, it sounded like most of the discussion that needed further exploration was around the math and ELA CASP assessment.

04:00:18.200 --> 04:00:30.200
So the motion number one is specific to decoupling accountability from assessments, regardless of which direction you choose to go in with the assessments piece.

04:00:30.200 --> 04:00:37.200
The first one is truly just about relief from the accountability requirements at the federal level.

04:00:37.200 --> 04:00:44.200
The second option, we could put the CASP aside for right now and focus on the LPAC.

04:00:44.200 --> 04:00:48.200
Do you want to provide an extended window for the LPAC?

04:00:48.200 --> 04:01:02.200
And if so, through July 30th or an optional additional window into the fall, pending, of course, approval from the legislature for additional funding for that window.

04:01:02.200 --> 04:01:09.200
And then the third motion that I see presented is around the waiver for the science assessment.

04:01:12.200 --> 04:01:14.200
And then thank you very much.

04:01:14.200 --> 04:01:16.200
Very helpful organizers.

04:01:16.200 --> 04:01:24.200
And then it seems like the other options that have been placed on the table are whether to pursue a blanket waiver.

04:01:24.200 --> 04:01:26.200
And what would that mean?

04:01:26.200 --> 04:01:40.200
Whether to adopt the strategy that many states are taking, which is do the best you can when you're back in person and, you know, assess those students that you can with the statewide summative test.

04:01:40.200 --> 04:01:48.200
And they're just no data for other students or no particular strategy for other students.

04:01:48.200 --> 04:02:12.200
The third is, I think, what this set of motions was intending, which was to ask folks who are able to move forward to give the state assessments and then to have some potentially a decision rule, as Member Rucker suggested, for where we need to request flexibilities.

04:02:13.200 --> 04:02:27.200
And then the fourth idea was maybe we punt some of this till March, and I think we have to sort out what, to be fair to the field, can be punted and what, you know, they need some indications on to be able to move forward.

04:02:27.200 --> 04:02:46.200
So what I'd like to do is deal with the first three of those that Rachel outlined initially and see if we can get some of the low-hanging fruit off the table, if you will, and then come back to discussion of the other choices that we have.

04:02:46.200 --> 04:02:56.200
So the first of those is Motion 1. So why don't we see if we have someone ready to make, and maybe Eileen, you'd like to do this.

04:02:56.200 --> 04:02:58.200
Okay.

04:02:58.200 --> 04:03:01.200
We've got a new thing coming up here.

04:03:01.200 --> 04:03:03.200
I think it's just highlighted.

04:03:03.200 --> 04:03:05.200
Okay.

04:03:06.200 --> 04:03:08.200
So thank you for doing that.

04:03:08.200 --> 04:03:31.200
So Motion 1, direct the CD to prepare a waiver consistent with the federal template regarding flexibilities offered by ED for accountability and school identification, which includes decoupling accountability from this year's assessments and waiving the requirement that the academic achievement indicator be adjusted to account for participation below 95%.

04:03:31.200 --> 04:03:34.200
So I move approval of Motion 1.

04:03:34.200 --> 04:03:36.200
I will second.

04:03:36.200 --> 04:03:40.200
Thank you very much. Is there further discussion of that motion?

04:03:40.200 --> 04:03:43.200
Hearing no further discussion?

04:03:43.200 --> 04:03:45.200
Yes, Member Burr, sorry.

04:03:45.200 --> 04:03:46.200
Sorry.

04:03:46.200 --> 04:03:56.200
Well, I'm just confused about whether the last part of that motion about waiving the requirement related to the academic achievement indicator.

04:03:56.200 --> 04:04:00.200
I think that's related to whether or not we give the statewide assessment.

04:04:00.200 --> 04:04:03.200
Is that accurate? Isn't that what the academic indicator is?

04:04:09.200 --> 04:04:17.200
The academic achievement indicator in normal times does assume that the assessment you're giving is the statewide summative test.

04:04:18.200 --> 04:04:30.200
So, I mean, I understand that this seems like it's the easy one because we want to get, you know, we don't think the accountability requirements should be in place because of all the challenges we've been talking about.

04:04:30.200 --> 04:04:38.200
But I just don't know if by adopting this motion, it presumes some action that we're going to take on the statewide assessment.

04:04:38.200 --> 04:04:44.200
So that's just my only concern about that one.

04:04:44.200 --> 04:04:47.200
We could go ahead.

04:04:47.200 --> 04:05:04.200
Can we just simply say in waiving the requirement to account for participation at the rate below 95 percent, waiving the requirement for participation rate of 95 percent?

04:05:04.200 --> 04:05:14.200
Because it does sound like having that academic achievement indicators just kind of odd when the 95 percent participation is a part of the federal law.

04:05:14.200 --> 04:05:17.200
Maybe I could provide a clarification.

04:05:17.200 --> 04:05:26.200
Just to be clear, what's being invited is this language is specific to what's being invited.

04:05:26.200 --> 04:05:27.200
I see.

04:05:27.200 --> 04:05:29.200
Okay. I just want to clarify that.

04:05:29.200 --> 04:05:35.200
President Darling-Hammond, could I just make a clarification to the 95 percent piece as well?

04:05:35.200 --> 04:05:41.200
So there are two places in statute where the 95 percent rule is discussed.

04:05:41.200 --> 04:05:45.200
One is the requirement for the 95 percent participation rate.

04:05:45.200 --> 04:05:52.200
And then the other is the linking of the 95 percent participation rate to the academic indicator.

04:05:52.200 --> 04:06:06.200
What the waiver presented, the letter presented from the Department of Education was the waiver, the decoupling of the 95 percent participation rate to the academic indicator.

04:06:06.200 --> 04:06:12.200
The requirement just in general for the 95 percent participation is still in place.

04:06:12.200 --> 04:06:16.200
There's just no consequence to it.

04:06:16.200 --> 04:06:20.200
Is that clarified sufficiently?

04:06:20.200 --> 04:06:23.200
Maybe not, but that's what it is.

04:06:23.200 --> 04:06:27.200
Member Byrd, did you want to have us stop?

04:06:27.200 --> 04:06:43.200
So, I mean, I think what you're suggesting is you'd want to be sure that if we did a vote on this, we'd decouple it from if there were the use of the state summative assessments that this would pertain.

04:06:43.200 --> 04:06:55.200
But I will just say that, and I saw Ting's reaction, that Rachel's clarification in some ways makes this even more of a conundrum.

04:06:55.200 --> 04:07:03.200
Because how on earth are we going to get a 95 percent participation rate if we decide to give the state test?

04:07:03.200 --> 04:07:04.200
I mean, I don't.

04:07:04.200 --> 04:07:05.200
Well, no.

04:07:05.200 --> 04:07:06.200
Did I misunderstand?

04:07:06.200 --> 04:07:16.200
Yeah, let me just try another way of articulating and also punt it back to Rachel for a further explanation.

04:07:16.200 --> 04:07:21.200
The 95 participation rate is still in the law.

04:07:21.200 --> 04:07:28.200
The way in which it has had meaning for states is because it was coupled with accountability requirements.

04:07:28.200 --> 04:07:31.200
This would decouple it from the accountability requirements.

04:07:31.200 --> 04:07:36.200
It does not remove it from the law, so to speak.

04:07:36.200 --> 04:07:41.200
Rachel, do you want to try another explanation?

04:07:41.200 --> 04:07:43.200
No, what you said is accurate.

04:07:43.200 --> 04:08:00.200
And I think to your point, Member Byrd, whether you give the summative or we use a different assessment, I think there's question around meeting that standard.

04:08:00.200 --> 04:08:12.200
And discussions I've heard in some places, the goal of having the state summative plus the option for alternatives where necessary in a flexible way

04:08:12.200 --> 04:08:23.200
is in part intended to help people get to a higher participation rate in assessments so that more parents and more students will have access to assessment data.

04:08:23.200 --> 04:08:40.200
But there is not going to be an accountability link to the 95% participation rate if one asks for this flexibility that's offered in the waiver.

04:08:40.200 --> 04:08:42.200
Member Rucker?

04:08:42.200 --> 04:08:51.200
My question was similarly related to Board Member Byrd's question concerning the academic achievement indicator.

04:08:51.200 --> 04:09:06.200
I'm not sure that there is a way to wordsmith this motion to address the guidance to the staff to make the application as it relates to the first waiver enumerated in the guidance letter.

04:09:06.200 --> 04:09:24.200
I think that there is a, because this does decouple the assessment itself from the accountability reporting requirements, the most important function that this motion serves is to give the staff the guidance that we intend to apply for that flexibility.

04:09:24.200 --> 04:09:39.200
The second piece about the assessment itself is part of that additional consideration for our circumstances, the circumstances unique to our state that we're going to have to explore in a separate and distinct waiver.

04:09:39.200 --> 04:10:01.200
So while I am very clear that this is related to the assessments identified that the state uses for its academic indicator, I believe we're going to have a second, different conversation in a separate waiver to talk about that assessment and how we're going to try to address this in the most practical way.

04:10:01.200 --> 04:10:06.200
Can we add the two words to this motion as applicable?

04:10:06.200 --> 04:10:09.200
As applicable, I think would be a good way to do it, yes.

04:10:09.200 --> 04:10:16.200
And then we will make the determination about the applicability shortly.

04:10:16.200 --> 04:10:23.200
With those clarifications, any further discussion of this motion?

04:10:23.200 --> 04:10:28.200
We need a roll call vote. Brooks, can you call the roll?

04:10:28.200 --> 04:10:33.200
Of course. So on the motion as amended, Member Byrd.

04:10:33.200 --> 04:10:34.200
Aye.

04:10:34.200 --> 04:10:36.200
President Darlin Hammond.

04:10:36.200 --> 04:10:37.200
Aye.

04:10:37.200 --> 04:10:39.200
Number Patel.

04:10:39.200 --> 04:10:40.200
Aye.

04:10:40.200 --> 04:10:42.200
Member Glover Woods.

04:10:42.200 --> 04:10:43.200
Aye.

04:10:43.200 --> 04:10:45.200
Number McQuillan.

04:10:45.200 --> 04:10:46.200
Yes.

04:10:46.200 --> 04:10:48.200
Member Navo.

04:10:48.200 --> 04:10:49.200
Aye.

04:10:49.200 --> 04:10:51.200
Number Patio Brownson.

04:10:51.200 --> 04:10:52.200
Yes.

04:10:52.200 --> 04:10:54.200
Member Rodriguez.

04:10:54.200 --> 04:10:55.200
Yes.

04:10:55.200 --> 04:10:57.200
Member Rucker.

04:10:57.200 --> 04:10:58.200
Yes.

04:10:58.200 --> 04:11:00.200
Vice President Strauss.

04:11:00.200 --> 04:11:01.200
Yes.

04:11:01.200 --> 04:11:02.200
Member Son.

04:11:02.200 --> 04:11:03.200
Aye.

04:11:03.200 --> 04:11:04.200
Okay.

04:11:04.200 --> 04:11:05.200
Okay.

04:11:05.200 --> 04:11:13.200
President Darlin Hammond, could I just add one piece as a reminder as well to this?

04:11:13.200 --> 04:11:21.200
And I'll probably continue to say this throughout the day just so that we have some clarification

04:11:21.200 --> 04:11:24.200
and remember to keep this in the forefront of our minds.

04:11:24.200 --> 04:11:27.200
The motion that just passed relieves us from the federal requirements.

04:11:27.200 --> 04:11:30.200
It does not relieve us from the state requirements.

04:11:30.200 --> 04:11:34.200
So for all of these things, I just want there to be a reminder that we are still held to

04:11:34.200 --> 04:11:42.200
the state requirements and it will require a vote from the legislature.

04:11:42.200 --> 04:11:44.200
Yes.

04:11:44.200 --> 04:11:49.200
I don't know if I'm freezing or if Rachel is freezing, so I'm going to move to another

04:11:49.200 --> 04:11:54.200
place to see if we get better Wi-Fi.

04:11:54.200 --> 04:11:57.200
President Darlin Hammond, I don't think it's on your end.

04:11:57.200 --> 04:11:59.200
No, it was Rachel that froze.

04:11:59.200 --> 04:12:00.200
It's Rachel.

04:12:00.200 --> 04:12:01.200
Okay.

04:12:01.200 --> 04:12:03.200
So there she's back.

04:12:03.200 --> 04:12:04.200
She's moving again.

04:12:04.200 --> 04:12:05.200
She's speaking again.

04:12:05.200 --> 04:12:06.200
Okay.

04:12:06.200 --> 04:12:07.200
Oh, no.

04:12:07.200 --> 04:12:08.200
Did you all hear me?

04:12:08.200 --> 04:12:09.200
We did.

04:12:09.200 --> 04:12:10.200
We did.

04:12:10.200 --> 04:12:11.200
Okay.

04:12:11.200 --> 04:12:12.200
I apologize.

04:12:12.200 --> 04:12:14.200
All of these things require state legislative approval as well.

04:12:14.200 --> 04:12:16.200
So thank you for reminding us of that.

04:12:16.200 --> 04:12:20.200
We'll try to hold that in our mind.

04:12:20.200 --> 04:12:25.200
I actually think that motion two is not as simple as it might be because we would have

04:12:25.200 --> 04:12:30.200
to make a judgment about whether we want to extend the administration window for the

04:12:30.200 --> 04:12:37.200
CASP or for the LPAC, if we're just restricted to the LPAC, to July 30th or to the fall

04:12:37.200 --> 04:12:39.200
because we can't have both.

04:12:39.200 --> 04:12:46.200
And so I'm not sure that we know the answer to that yet.

04:12:47.200 --> 04:12:57.200
And it might be one of those things that we can make a motion that we want to extend the

04:12:57.200 --> 04:13:05.200
LPAC window and come back in March and say how far we think we can extend it once we

04:13:05.200 --> 04:13:06.200
have more input.

04:13:06.200 --> 04:13:12.200
But I would welcome, Rachel, your thoughts about that in terms of whether you feel we

04:13:12.200 --> 04:13:17.200
have enough input from the field to know what kind of extension would be preferable

04:13:17.200 --> 04:13:18.200
for the LPAC.

04:13:18.200 --> 04:13:23.200
Well, I think similar and unfortunate to other situations that we've been in with the

04:13:23.200 --> 04:13:30.200
pandemic, in order for us to move any of the assessments to the fall and to provide a fall

04:13:30.200 --> 04:13:34.200
administration option, we would have to make that decision today.

04:13:34.200 --> 04:13:40.200
In order for ETS to prepare an entirely new fall administration window, they would have

04:13:40.200 --> 04:13:43.200
to start work on that immediately.

04:13:43.200 --> 04:13:49.200
And again, I apologize for the timeliness of this, but that is one that we would have

04:13:49.200 --> 04:13:51.200
to consider right away.

04:13:51.200 --> 04:13:56.200
I remember, I take your word and I appreciate all the complexity here.

04:13:56.200 --> 04:14:03.200
I do remember last year we had to make that judgment later just because the schools closed

04:14:03.200 --> 04:14:07.200
in March and then we made that judgment.

04:14:07.200 --> 04:14:13.200
But maybe between us we know enough to know which would be the more desirable window.

04:14:13.200 --> 04:14:20.200
Well, and just as a clarification for last year as well, we offered that solely for reclassification

04:14:20.200 --> 04:14:21.200
purposes.

04:14:21.200 --> 04:14:26.200
It wasn't open to all of our English learners throughout the state.

04:14:26.200 --> 04:14:27.200
That's right.

04:14:27.200 --> 04:14:36.200
So I personally don't feel like I have a way to make the judgment about what would be

04:14:36.200 --> 04:14:43.200
more usable and useful to districts in that regard.

04:14:43.200 --> 04:14:46.200
But member Glover Woods has an idea.

04:14:46.200 --> 04:14:48.200
Oh, I don't know if it's an idea.

04:14:48.200 --> 04:14:55.200
It's more of a question in relation to the LPAT fall administration and the funding that

04:14:55.200 --> 04:14:57.200
would be needed for that.

04:14:57.200 --> 04:15:02.200
Was I correct in understanding earlier in the meeting that that request for funding

04:15:02.200 --> 04:15:05.200
is something that would need to go to the legislature?

04:15:05.200 --> 04:15:11.200
And if so, is that a decision that we would recommend today in light of not having a lot

04:15:11.200 --> 04:15:16.200
of information around that?

04:15:16.200 --> 04:15:21.200
Rachel, do you, I mean, the answer is yes, we would have to go to the legislature for

04:15:21.200 --> 04:15:22.200
the funding.

04:15:22.200 --> 04:15:25.200
Do you want to add any other thoughts?

04:15:25.200 --> 04:15:28.200
I see member Strauss has her hand up also.

04:15:28.200 --> 04:15:33.200
I would just, I would agree with that, Linda, President Darling-Hammond.

04:15:33.200 --> 04:15:39.200
I would concur that we would have to have approval from the legislature for the funds

04:15:39.200 --> 04:15:44.200
as well as the administration opening up the administration window.

04:15:44.200 --> 04:15:49.200
It might be that the safest thing is to simply recommend extension through the 30th so that

04:15:49.200 --> 04:15:52.200
we know that people can use it.

04:15:52.200 --> 04:15:55.200
But member Strauss, do you have a thought?

04:15:55.200 --> 04:16:04.200
Well, so I feel like the priority would be to LPAC extension and extending to the 30th,

04:16:04.200 --> 04:16:06.200
really, it's only two weeks.

04:16:06.200 --> 04:16:08.200
So I'm just wondering.

04:16:08.200 --> 04:16:14.200
It's actually a longer extension for the LPAC because the LPAC otherwise closes in May,

04:16:14.200 --> 04:16:16.200
I think May 31st.

04:16:17.200 --> 04:16:22.200
And so if we went to July 30th for the LPAC, it would be a longer extension.

04:16:22.200 --> 04:16:31.200
So I just wonder if there's a way to make the motion on the LPAC pending legislative

04:16:31.200 --> 04:16:39.200
and governor approvals so that that one, it sounds like we cannot delay if in fact we

04:16:39.200 --> 04:16:41.200
want a fall window.

04:16:42.200 --> 04:16:46.200
And that's what I heard Rachel say.

04:16:46.200 --> 04:16:50.200
And I guess I just want it to be in person and I don't know that everyone's going to

04:16:50.200 --> 04:16:52.200
be back in time.

04:16:52.200 --> 04:16:53.200
So I feel like we need to extend.

04:16:53.200 --> 04:16:58.200
So I guess the question is, is it better to extend it into July and make that as a motion

04:16:58.200 --> 04:17:00.200
and then come back in March or May?

04:17:00.200 --> 04:17:01.200
No, you can't say.

04:17:01.200 --> 04:17:05.200
Rachel said we have to extend for fall now if we want it.

04:17:05.200 --> 04:17:11.200
So I guess that would be my proposal, President Darling-Hammond, that we separate out just

04:17:11.200 --> 04:17:13.200
the extension of the LPAC window.

04:17:13.200 --> 04:17:15.200
Member Burr?

04:17:17.200 --> 04:17:20.200
So I am so confused today.

04:17:20.200 --> 04:17:27.200
We can't, I sort of understand why you want it to be urgent for ETS, but if it's contingent

04:17:27.200 --> 04:17:32.200
upon the authorization of resources provided by the legislature and the governor, I'm pretty

04:17:32.200 --> 04:17:36.200
sure they're not going to do that before our March meeting.

04:17:36.200 --> 04:17:42.200
So if we're trying to figure out, do we, to be more comprehensive, if you will, that we

04:17:42.200 --> 04:17:48.200
both extend the window and we provide, or we provide for a fall window, I think it's

04:17:48.200 --> 04:17:53.200
worth trying to buy some time to figure out how that happens and what makes the most sense.

04:17:53.200 --> 04:17:59.200
And my other point of confusion is whether or not this extension is related to a federal

04:17:59.200 --> 04:18:04.200
waiver, or this is something that we think is a good thing to do just for purposes of

04:18:04.200 --> 04:18:08.200
test administration and for services to English learners.

04:18:08.200 --> 04:18:16.200
You know, it is mentioned in the federal letter, but I think that it is actually a state decision.

04:18:16.200 --> 04:18:23.200
We do not need federal approval or permission to extend that window as far as I know.

04:18:23.200 --> 04:18:27.200
But I'm going to punt that back to Rachel to clarify.

04:18:28.200 --> 04:18:35.200
For this piece, I'll ask Dr. Bang if she would be able to provide some clarification as far

04:18:35.200 --> 04:18:38.200
as what the requirements are for the extension of the LPAC.

04:18:41.200 --> 04:18:51.200
So if there is a, if we want to extend it, we are taking emergency regulations to the

04:18:51.200 --> 04:19:01.200
March board meeting so that we can extend it, extend through our emergency regs process.

04:19:01.200 --> 04:19:07.200
And that may, we were anticipating there may be some interest in that.

04:19:07.200 --> 04:19:10.200
And that is why we worked through that process.

04:19:10.200 --> 04:19:14.200
So through our emergency regs, we could extend it.

04:19:15.200 --> 04:19:22.200
The mention of this in the federal letter was because English learner assessments are typically

04:19:22.200 --> 04:19:27.200
on an earlier time frame than other assessments, which is true in our state as well.

04:19:27.200 --> 04:19:33.200
And people across the country were beginning to bring English learners back for assessments

04:19:33.200 --> 04:19:36.200
when schools were not safe to be open in person.

04:19:36.200 --> 04:19:41.200
And there was actually some litigation brought by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights

04:19:41.200 --> 04:19:47.200
against about eight of the states saying don't bring English learners back in the pandemic

04:19:47.200 --> 04:19:52.200
to, you know, when the schools aren't safe to be open for testing because of that earlier window.

04:19:52.200 --> 04:19:59.200
So there's encouragement in the letter to extend the window for English learners where it is earlier than others,

04:19:59.200 --> 04:20:02.200
which it was also for California.

04:20:02.200 --> 04:20:07.200
We were, you know, to finish that by May 31st as opposed to by July 15th,

04:20:07.200 --> 04:20:14.200
which is for the close of school, whichever comes sooner, which is our other date for assessment closures.

04:20:14.200 --> 04:20:23.200
So one way to be sure that we are signaling, taking more time to get to English learners would be to simply extend the date now

04:20:23.200 --> 04:20:31.200
through July 30th, which adds two full months to what districts would otherwise be thinking they needed to do.

04:20:31.200 --> 04:20:36.200
Because anything else we do is contingent on the legislature, it's contingent on emergency regulations,

04:20:36.200 --> 04:20:43.200
and we might make a decision today to do something that was impossible to do and we will not have extended the timeline

04:20:43.200 --> 04:20:48.200
meanwhile to meet the need that was originally identified.

04:20:48.200 --> 04:20:52.200
Brooks is raising his hand.

04:20:52.200 --> 04:20:56.200
Yeah, I believe General Counsel Sias has some feedback as well.

04:20:57.200 --> 04:21:06.200
Yes, so if we wanted to, we do not need a federal waiver to extend the testing window for LPAC this year.

04:21:06.200 --> 04:21:12.200
As Mal said, we would need to change regulations and we could do that at the March meeting.

04:21:12.200 --> 04:21:19.200
However, if we wanted to do a fall testing window for LPAC, we would need a federal waiver.

04:21:19.200 --> 04:21:25.200
Plus, we would need state law change because we would not be administering the LPAC in this current school year.

04:21:25.200 --> 04:21:36.200
The other problem we would have is that just as we heard for fall testing, otherwise students will have changed schools.

04:21:36.200 --> 04:21:43.200
Sometimes they will have changed districts because they've gone from an elementary district to a high school district.

04:21:43.200 --> 04:21:48.200
You know, there are all the record keeping problems associated with that.

04:21:48.200 --> 04:21:56.200
So the intention of it is a very good intention and we did it as Rachel reminded us for reclassification this year,

04:21:56.200 --> 04:22:06.200
but it is a complicated thing to do and if people don't know whether it will be approved in time to shift their plans,

04:22:06.200 --> 04:22:21.200
they may still feel the urgency of testing English learners earlier than they would otherwise have to plan for if we were to extend at least through July 30th,

04:22:21.200 --> 04:22:27.200
which to me seems like maybe the safer thing to do.

04:22:27.200 --> 04:22:40.200
Leaving it alone does leave people in the situation where they feel they need to bring kids in in some cases for testing

04:22:40.200 --> 04:22:44.200
because we've seen the problems of remote testing of English learners in some districts already.

04:22:44.200 --> 04:22:47.200
Member Navo, did you want to weigh in?

04:22:47.200 --> 04:22:51.200
Oh, I was and then I decided I wasn't and so now I will.

04:22:51.200 --> 04:22:53.200
Why you should? Yeah, go ahead.

04:22:53.200 --> 04:23:02.200
I was just wondering why there wasn't any reason we just couldn't make it make both of those July 30th, 2021 and and leave the rest out.

04:23:02.200 --> 04:23:06.200
And should the extent that we need to revisit this in March, we can.

04:23:06.200 --> 04:23:13.200
But for now, giving the field some direction that at least minimally speaking, you have until July 30th to finish your LPAC,

04:23:13.200 --> 04:23:24.200
which seems to be the least complicated and requires the least a number of hoops to jump through as a state.

04:23:24.200 --> 04:23:36.200
Yeah, and just to clarify, we can't the contractor can't boot up again for a fall administration easily if we've gone to July 30th.

04:23:36.200 --> 04:23:49.200
But it is the thing that probably sends the most clear signal to the field in the moment to begin to reduce some of the ambiguity that that people are experiencing.

04:23:49.200 --> 04:23:54.200
Matt, would you like to make a motion on that?

04:23:54.200 --> 04:24:00.200
Sure, to the extent that there's there's no other conversation, I would make the motion.

04:24:00.200 --> 04:24:03.200
We could take more conversation after we have a motion.

04:24:03.200 --> 04:24:12.200
Sure, that we extend the 2020-21 test administration window for both CASP and LPAC to July 30th, 2021.

04:24:12.200 --> 04:24:18.200
While you were gone, there was more conversation about CASP.

04:24:18.200 --> 04:24:25.200
I guess we could also add the word whether we would be some people want to revisit the question about CASP.

04:24:25.200 --> 04:24:28.200
So we could say as appropriate.

04:24:28.200 --> 04:24:30.200
Yes.

04:24:30.200 --> 04:24:33.200
As applicable.

04:24:33.200 --> 04:24:36.200
Yes, that makes sense to me.

04:24:36.200 --> 04:24:37.200
We have a motion.

04:24:37.200 --> 04:24:39.200
Do we have a second?

04:24:39.200 --> 04:24:41.200
I'll second.

04:24:41.200 --> 04:24:42.200
All right.

04:24:42.200 --> 04:24:45.200
Is there further discussion of the motion?

04:24:45.200 --> 04:24:46.200
All right.

04:24:46.200 --> 04:24:48.200
Brooks, can you call the roll?

04:24:48.200 --> 04:24:50.200
Member Burr.

04:24:50.200 --> 04:24:52.200
No.

04:24:53.200 --> 04:24:55.200
President Darling-Hammond.

04:24:55.200 --> 04:24:56.200
Yes.

04:24:56.200 --> 04:24:58.200
Member Fatah.

04:24:58.200 --> 04:24:59.200
Yes.

04:24:59.200 --> 04:25:05.200
Member Glover-Woods.

04:25:05.200 --> 04:25:07.200
No.

04:25:07.200 --> 04:25:09.200
Member McQuillan.

04:25:09.200 --> 04:25:11.200
Yes.

04:25:11.200 --> 04:25:14.200
Member Navo.

04:25:14.200 --> 04:25:15.200
Yes.

04:25:15.200 --> 04:25:18.200
Member Patil-Brownson.

04:25:18.200 --> 04:25:19.200
Yes.

04:25:19.200 --> 04:25:21.200
Member Rodriguez.

04:25:21.200 --> 04:25:22.200
Yes.

04:25:22.200 --> 04:25:26.200
Member Rucker.

04:25:26.200 --> 04:25:29.200
Not voting.

04:25:29.200 --> 04:25:31.200
Vice President Strauss.

04:25:31.200 --> 04:25:32.200
Yes.

04:25:32.200 --> 04:25:35.200
Member Son.

04:25:35.200 --> 04:25:38.200
I wish we had just addressed only the LPAC.

04:25:38.200 --> 04:25:39.200
I'm sorry.

04:25:39.200 --> 04:25:42.200
Because the CASP is what's keeping me.

04:25:42.200 --> 04:25:43.200
It was added as applicable.

04:25:43.200 --> 04:25:46.200
So if we're not going to have the CASP, it won't be applicable.

04:25:46.200 --> 04:25:47.200
Okay.

04:25:47.200 --> 04:25:50.200
Then yes.

04:25:50.200 --> 04:25:53.200
The motion carries.

04:25:53.200 --> 04:25:54.200
Okay.

04:25:54.200 --> 04:25:56.200
Just trying to work our way through.

04:25:56.200 --> 04:25:58.200
And then we'll come to the big buckets.

04:25:58.200 --> 04:26:01.200
The third one was motion three.

04:26:01.200 --> 04:26:06.200
Direct CDE to prepare a general waiver of the California science test.

04:26:06.200 --> 04:26:14.200
For the school year, per the rationale that Member Strauss provided earlier.

04:26:14.200 --> 04:26:17.200
Is there further discussion of that motion?

04:26:17.200 --> 04:26:20.200
Or do I have a motion to use?

04:26:20.200 --> 04:26:24.200
Member Strauss, do you want to remove that?

04:26:24.200 --> 04:26:27.200
Re-hyphen move that?

04:26:27.200 --> 04:26:29.200
So motion three.

04:26:29.200 --> 04:26:34.200
Direct CDE to prepare a general waiver of the California science test for the 2021 school year.

04:26:34.200 --> 04:26:36.200
I second.

04:26:36.200 --> 04:26:38.200
All right.

04:26:38.200 --> 04:26:40.200
So we have a motion and a second.

04:26:40.200 --> 04:26:42.200
Is there further discussion of that motion?

04:26:42.200 --> 04:26:44.200
All right.

04:26:44.200 --> 04:26:45.200
We'll call the roll.

04:26:45.200 --> 04:26:47.200
Member Burr.

04:26:47.200 --> 04:26:48.200
Aye.

04:26:48.200 --> 04:26:50.200
President Darling-Hammond.

04:26:50.200 --> 04:26:51.200
Aye.

04:26:51.200 --> 04:26:53.200
Member Fatah.

04:26:53.200 --> 04:26:54.200
Aye.

04:26:54.200 --> 04:26:56.200
Member Glover-Woods.

04:26:56.200 --> 04:26:57.200
Yes.

04:26:57.200 --> 04:26:59.200
Member McQuillan.

04:26:59.200 --> 04:27:00.200
Yes.

04:27:00.200 --> 04:27:02.200
Member Navo.

04:27:02.200 --> 04:27:03.200
Aye.

04:27:03.200 --> 04:27:05.200
Member Patil-Brownson.

04:27:05.200 --> 04:27:06.200
Yes.

04:27:06.200 --> 04:27:08.200
Member Rodriguez.

04:27:08.200 --> 04:27:09.200
Yes.

04:27:09.200 --> 04:27:11.200
Member Rucker.

04:27:11.200 --> 04:27:12.200
Yes.

04:27:12.200 --> 04:27:14.200
Vice President Strauss.

04:27:14.200 --> 04:27:15.200
Yes.

04:27:15.200 --> 04:27:17.200
Member Son.

04:27:17.200 --> 04:27:18.200
Aye.

04:27:18.200 --> 04:27:20.200
Motion carries unanimously.

04:27:20.200 --> 04:27:22.200
Okay.

04:27:22.200 --> 04:27:24.200
So now we get to the fun part.

04:27:24.200 --> 04:27:26.200
We've all been waiting for.

04:27:26.200 --> 04:27:35.200
Which is I think what we sorted out were the various possible ways that one could address the remainder of the testing question.

04:27:35.200 --> 04:27:39.200
One is to request a blanket waiver.

04:27:39.200 --> 04:27:47.200
One is to do the best you can to ask people to use the state summative assessments that remain after the science is removed.

04:27:47.200 --> 04:27:50.200
Do the best you can when you're back in person.

04:27:50.200 --> 04:28:01.200
And those students who, you know, have already put a parameter saying you need to be back in person, need to be back in person for a number of weeks for kids to be back.

04:28:01.200 --> 04:28:07.200
And then to do as much assessment as is practicable in that period of time.

04:28:07.200 --> 04:28:12.200
And there will just be something less than a 95% participation rate likely.

04:28:12.200 --> 04:28:16.200
That's the strategy that Rachel described other states using.

04:28:16.200 --> 04:28:20.200
And it is consonant with what I've heard in some places.

04:28:20.200 --> 04:28:28.200
A third is to have the state assessment with a decision rule for flexibilities.

04:28:28.200 --> 04:28:48.200
For, as member Rucker said, if there's some objective criterion that one would use to then look at other ways to provide data where in-person instruction is not happening and safe and appropriate for the use of the state summative tests.

04:28:48.200 --> 04:28:53.200
And then the fourth would be to try to see whether we can come back to this question in March.

04:28:54.200 --> 04:29:08.200
And I think that is based on whether we feel the field needs some additional indications today to be able to figure out how to proceed.

04:29:08.200 --> 04:29:21.200
Let me pause there and say under the blanket waiver, that would also, I think, cover the question that some people have raised about just letting everyone use whatever it is that they've got.

04:29:21.200 --> 04:29:30.200
I mean, that's essentially one of the ways that one could write for a different kind of waiver.

04:29:30.200 --> 04:29:38.200
So first, let me see if anybody sees any other possibilities that I have not named.

04:29:38.200 --> 04:29:46.200
So that we can then take them in an orderly way and just think through the different components.

04:29:47.200 --> 04:29:55.200
And I will say that there were a few states that had asked for blanket waivers.

04:29:55.200 --> 04:30:06.200
Most of them are now reconsidering within the parameters of the guidance that's come out, but there may be others who do that.

04:30:06.200 --> 04:30:15.200
There is at least one state that wrote a waiver that would require local assessments.

04:30:15.200 --> 04:30:17.200
So that's that bucket.

04:30:17.200 --> 04:30:26.200
Most states are in the category of do the best you can when you're back in person, and some are doing the version of we're going to offer the statewide assessment.

04:30:26.200 --> 04:30:34.200
We're also going to work with districts that cannot give that assessment to be sure that there is some assessment data that is made available.

04:30:34.200 --> 04:30:43.200
So all of these represent realities in the field in one way or another, some of them much more common than others.

04:30:44.200 --> 04:30:50.200
I think the first thing I want to ask, though, of our staff is because I think we need to we've not talked about this.

04:30:50.200 --> 04:31:02.200
If we were to ask for a blanket waiver, what are the penalties that we would be facing if, as is presumed, it would be likely denied?

04:31:03.200 --> 04:31:13.200
So my understanding is that in statute, the requirement for assessments is tied to our federal funding.

04:31:13.200 --> 04:31:22.200
So that that is a possibility that the that could choose to withhold any or all of our federal funds.

04:31:22.200 --> 04:31:27.200
We've got a hand up from Member Burr.

04:31:27.200 --> 04:31:38.200
I just want to clarify what the penalty my understanding is that the first step that the feds would take would be to try to limit our administrative funds,

04:31:38.200 --> 04:31:46.200
meaning the funds that go primarily to the Department of Education for for their work, not that that's miniscule,

04:31:46.200 --> 04:31:55.200
but it's not. But they typically have not in the past, even though sometimes they try to threaten it, take away money from kids.

04:31:55.200 --> 04:31:58.200
They don't take away the money that goes directly to LEAs.

04:31:58.200 --> 04:32:01.200
But anyway, I just wanted to clarify that.

04:32:01.200 --> 04:32:04.200
Yeah, I'd be happy to clarify that, Member Burr.

04:32:04.200 --> 04:32:06.200
And this is my understanding.

04:32:06.200 --> 04:32:08.200
I believe you may have participated in this.

04:32:08.200 --> 04:32:11.200
So if if you have a different understanding, let me know.

04:32:12.200 --> 04:32:19.200
But my understanding was that first there was the the statement that they would withhold our federal funds,

04:32:19.200 --> 04:32:22.200
targeting specifically Title One during that time.

04:32:22.200 --> 04:32:29.200
And then through multiple negotiations and discussions, it was brought down to just our administrative funds.

04:32:29.200 --> 04:32:32.200
And they did end up withholding some of that.

04:32:32.200 --> 04:32:36.200
They withheld funds from two states, California and Idaho.

04:32:36.200 --> 04:32:41.200
In the past, I think by law, they could withhold all of our federal funds.

04:32:41.200 --> 04:32:47.200
I think it became a negotiation or something at some point in time.

04:32:47.200 --> 04:32:49.200
Member Rucker.

04:32:49.200 --> 04:32:53.200
So I was going to also weigh in on that same discussion.

04:32:53.200 --> 04:33:01.200
I think that in looking at and talking about this, I don't think we need to speak to this in absentia.

04:33:01.200 --> 04:33:07.200
In looking at and talking about this, I don't think we need to speak to this in absolute terms.

04:33:07.200 --> 04:33:15.200
While the waiver contemplates a way for us to do the assessment in a way that would collect statewide data.

04:33:15.200 --> 04:33:28.200
Let me suggest that we parse that requirement to say we have a way to ensure that statewide there will be a uniform type of data collection from all of the districts.

04:33:28.200 --> 04:33:33.200
But it doesn't it won't necessarily be based on the use of a statewide assessment.

04:33:33.200 --> 04:33:45.200
So if we are uniformly requiring all districts to collect and publicly report information about the progress of students on academic growth on English language arts and math.

04:33:45.200 --> 04:33:47.200
But they're using local assessments.

04:33:47.200 --> 04:33:56.200
We are still requiring a statewide data collection and we are requiring that be done in a uniform and timely way.

04:33:57.200 --> 04:34:00.200
We're just not going to use the state assessment to do it.

04:34:00.200 --> 04:34:17.200
It relieves us of the burden of trying to figure out how to administer a state assessment and allows us to give districts the local flexibility in the context of what's going on in the health pandemic issue to use the local assessment and local assessment practices.

04:34:17.200 --> 04:34:19.200
That's all that they are already doing.

04:34:20.200 --> 04:34:24.200
The letter does give us that flexibility to make that case.

04:34:24.200 --> 04:34:28.200
And that would be the recommendation I would suggest we look at.

04:34:28.200 --> 04:34:35.200
And in your version, Member Rucker, it doesn't give us the flexibility up front.

04:34:35.200 --> 04:34:40.200
It gives us, as you said, the opportunity to make the case in case.

04:34:40.200 --> 04:34:45.200
But they're clear in cases where there are unusual circumstances.

04:34:45.200 --> 04:34:46.200
Right.

04:34:46.200 --> 04:34:52.200
And we're not making up the, the unusual circumstances are not something that we as the state board have made up.

04:34:52.200 --> 04:35:03.200
This is work that's already been undertaken by multiple stakeholder policy groups in the health community to set a uniform standard for defining these conditions.

04:35:03.200 --> 04:35:07.200
So it's not even going to be conditions that change from location to location.

04:35:07.200 --> 04:35:12.200
It's a uniform set of criteria that's already in place.

04:35:12.200 --> 04:35:33.200
And in your version of this, Member Rucker, would the state be offering the statewide assessment for those who found that to be the best way to proceed and accepting other just other assessments where they can meet the standards that you laid out from other districts?

04:35:33.200 --> 04:35:46.200
I think that I am open to suggesting that, but I think that might be a difficulty for the feds because what they will see is two different types of blocks of assessment data.

04:35:46.200 --> 04:35:51.200
There were different blocks of assessment data for used.

04:35:51.200 --> 04:36:02.200
I think if I think if the feds want to make is that we're making publicly accessible information about the about the progress that students are making.

04:36:02.200 --> 04:36:06.200
And we're saying we're going to do this in a uniform way across the state.

04:36:06.200 --> 04:36:17.200
I think we're still meeting the intent of preparing a statewide report because districts would be reporting the same kind of data in a uniform way that we define for them.

04:36:17.200 --> 04:36:25.200
If they haven't already chosen something that allows for that and administered it, there would need to be a default.

04:36:26.200 --> 04:36:35.200
Well, I don't see how they wouldn't have done that since it's a requirement for both for the LCAP and the learning continuity plans that already requires it.

04:36:35.200 --> 04:36:43.200
And I know charter schools are already doing it because we identified those 11 assessments that they can use for that purpose.

04:36:43.200 --> 04:36:53.200
So I would be surprised to know based on the requirement to approve the learning continuity plans last fall that there wouldn't be a district that doesn't already have that.

04:36:53.200 --> 04:36:59.200
I'm just suggesting that we don't know for sure and we don't know what they will allow in terms of reporting fully.

04:36:59.200 --> 04:37:03.200
So you might need a default in that in that version.

04:37:03.200 --> 04:37:10.200
I'm going to go to member Glover Woods and then we'll discuss some of the others member Glover Woods.

04:37:10.200 --> 04:37:15.200
Thank you. I just had a question regarding the timeline.

04:37:15.200 --> 04:37:40.200
If we were to pursue a waiver of any sort, be it blanket or similar to what member Rucker suggested, could you remind me again, Rachel, what is kind of the expected timeline that we would receive a response from ED on whether that waiver is allowed or accepted or approved?

04:37:41.200 --> 04:37:49.200
From my my understanding from previous practice when we've submitted things like this is that it takes quite some time.

04:37:49.200 --> 04:37:52.200
OK, so in.

04:37:52.200 --> 04:37:56.200
In light of that, we'll say quite some time.

04:37:56.200 --> 04:38:16.200
Would that then mean if the waiver is not approved, then we are still required to either administer the state assessment or make a choice not to administer the state assessment and take the consequences that would come from not adhering to that.

04:38:16.200 --> 04:38:22.200
And I will let Judy Sice jump in on this, too, if I'm incorrect.

04:38:22.200 --> 04:38:34.200
But my understanding is that until we have an approved waiver, we would need to continue to move forward to meet the obligations laid out under ESSA.

04:38:34.200 --> 04:38:36.200
OK, that helps.

04:38:36.200 --> 04:38:40.200
So we would be obligated to continue to be assessing.

04:38:40.200 --> 04:38:41.200
OK, thank you.

04:38:41.200 --> 04:38:42.200
That helped to clarify.

04:38:42.200 --> 04:38:47.200
Thank you.

04:38:47.200 --> 04:38:54.200
I'm looking to see if there's another another hand up.

04:38:54.200 --> 04:39:02.200
I don't have the federal letter in front of me, which I wanted to get, but there's a I'm going to try to get that.

04:39:02.200 --> 04:39:22.200
There's a statement about the fact that these additional flexibilities that member Rucker was referring to are in addition to not necessarily in lieu of the flexibilities around giving the state summative assessment.

04:39:22.200 --> 04:39:42.200
So I thought originally, member Rucker, what you were proposing was that for places that are not able to give the state summative assessment, that there would be an objective criteria that then leads to the pursuit of those flexibilities.

04:39:42.200 --> 04:39:45.200
OK, so I'm reading directly from the letter itself.

04:39:45.200 --> 04:39:46.200
Thank you.

04:39:47.200 --> 04:39:53.200
The paragraph I'm looking at is at the bottom of page two of three.

04:39:53.200 --> 04:39:56.200
So forgive me for reading this aloud to everyone.

04:39:56.200 --> 04:40:17.200
It says the intent of these flexibilities and the accountability waivers described above is to focus on assessments to provide information to parents, educators and the public about student performance and to help target resources and support.

04:40:17.200 --> 04:40:24.200
And I'm going to read that again to focus on assessments to provide information to parents.

04:40:24.200 --> 04:40:29.200
For that reason, we are not inviting blanket waivers of assessments.

04:40:29.200 --> 04:40:40.200
We also recognize that individual states may need additional assessment flexibility based on the specific circumstances.

04:40:40.200 --> 04:40:46.200
And these are the two propositions across or within the state.

04:40:46.200 --> 04:41:00.200
And we will work with states to address their individual needs and conditions while ensuring the maximum available statewide data to inform the targeting of resources and supports.

04:41:00.200 --> 04:41:18.200
So if their primary interest is to focus on assessments to inform, to provide information to parents, educators and the public about student performance, that doesn't necessarily mean we are only limited to the CASP or in addition to the CASP.

04:41:18.200 --> 04:41:24.200
It says the assessments that will do that perform a specific service on providing information.

04:41:24.200 --> 04:41:27.200
And it says within or across the state.

04:41:27.200 --> 04:41:38.200
So I think that one way to consider the options is, you know, on the one hand, a blanket waiver would say there's no assessment obligation whatsoever.

04:41:38.200 --> 04:41:42.200
On the other hand, one would say there is an assessment obligation.

04:41:42.200 --> 04:41:54.200
We need to figure out what that assessment obligation is that might include the CASP, might include other assessments that are more available and readily used.

04:41:54.200 --> 04:41:57.200
So maybe we need to start with that.

04:41:57.200 --> 04:42:07.200
I mostly heard members of the board speaking to how do we enact the assessment obligation rather than avoid any assessment obligation.

04:42:07.200 --> 04:42:20.200
But if we can see whether we have a majority on one side or the other of that, then we could burrow in to the question of how would we pursue the flexibilities in assessments.

04:42:20.200 --> 04:42:25.200
If, in fact, that's what we're agreed we want to do.

04:42:25.200 --> 04:42:33.200
So the question really is one of maybe I can just ask for a sort of a show of hands.

04:42:33.200 --> 04:42:46.200
How many people would like to see assessments of some sort occur such that parents and the public have data?

04:42:46.200 --> 04:42:51.200
And then we can work out what's plausible and reasonable.

04:42:51.200 --> 04:42:55.200
Excuse me, President Darling-Hammond.

04:42:55.200 --> 04:42:57.200
I don't think we can do a straw poll.

04:42:57.200 --> 04:43:01.200
So please, we need to call the question and do a roll call.

04:43:01.200 --> 04:43:02.200
Okay. All right.

04:43:02.200 --> 04:43:07.200
So I did get a glimpse of it.

04:43:07.200 --> 04:43:11.200
We'll do a little motion.

04:43:11.200 --> 04:43:13.200
Shall I just try to state it?

04:43:13.200 --> 04:43:16.200
Or can somebody else formulate it now?

04:43:16.200 --> 04:43:18.200
It's being typed on the...

04:43:18.200 --> 04:43:25.200
Oh, okay.

04:43:25.200 --> 04:43:28.200
I didn't hear what it was to type.

04:43:28.200 --> 04:43:34.200
I'll try to state it again and I guess I'll move it.

04:43:34.200 --> 04:43:54.200
That California create a means, a policy means to provide assessment information this school year to parents and the public.

04:43:54.200 --> 04:44:03.200
The specifics of which we will then further deliberate.

04:44:03.200 --> 04:44:17.200
I don't know if you have to put that last part that was because then we know whether we're talking about a waiver that asks for certain kinds of flexibilities of assessment or a waiver that asks for no assessment.

04:44:17.200 --> 04:44:25.200
So at least we can boil ourselves down to one of those buckets.

04:44:25.200 --> 04:44:28.200
So that's the intention.

04:44:28.200 --> 04:44:33.200
Judy, were you going to say something?

04:44:33.200 --> 04:44:37.200
Okay. Do I have a second on that motion?

04:44:37.200 --> 04:44:44.200
Can I ask that we also include disaggregated information?

04:44:44.200 --> 04:44:48.200
Well, if we end up in that bucket, then we can figure out what that bucket is.

04:44:48.200 --> 04:44:50.200
But first we have to figure out if we're in that bucket.

04:44:50.200 --> 04:44:52.200
All right.

04:44:52.200 --> 04:44:53.200
I take your point.

04:44:53.200 --> 04:44:54.200
Member Burr?

04:44:54.200 --> 04:44:57.200
Yeah, I just wanted to clarify.

04:44:57.200 --> 04:45:01.200
I think it would be important for us to be clear about what our context is.

04:45:01.200 --> 04:45:06.200
And I think Board Member Rucker has been talking about this and others may have while I was off.

04:45:06.200 --> 04:45:08.200
So I apologize if I missed it.

04:45:08.200 --> 04:45:21.200
We in the state, as I understand it, early on in the pandemic beginning last fall said or last spring, you don't have to do an LCAP because we know that's a big burden, but you have to do a learning continuity plan.

04:45:21.200 --> 04:45:31.200
And in that learning continuity plan, every LEA has to identify what assessments they're using locally to make sure they know how their students are doing.

04:45:31.200 --> 04:45:36.200
I just hope our conversation is kind of nested in what we've already required.

04:45:36.200 --> 04:45:48.200
And I like you, Linda, I'm not 100 percent sure or even 50 percent sure that all LEAs complied with that, although we have a mechanism by which the counties were supposed to approve it, et cetera.

04:45:48.200 --> 04:46:03.200
So for me, I'd like to do more digging around that and have more information to say what's really out there and what is available and what's available to make and what would we want and how would that be reported to the public?

04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:06.200
Because I agree with you, we're all, I agree with your intent.

04:46:06.200 --> 04:46:11.200
I guess what I want to make sure is we're nesting it in what we've already asked LEAs to do.

04:46:11.200 --> 04:46:14.200
Exactly. Well, that's why I framed it that way.

04:46:14.200 --> 04:46:19.200
We do know there's a lot of assessment data that has been collected.

04:46:19.200 --> 04:46:23.200
We do know there are some people who are already giving the state tests.

04:46:23.200 --> 04:46:29.200
We do know that there are lots of barriers for everyone to do that.

04:46:29.200 --> 04:46:31.200
And we've got, you know, to figure out.

04:46:31.200 --> 04:46:36.200
But that would that would then shape the next conversation.

04:46:36.200 --> 04:46:38.200
So any further discussion?

04:46:38.200 --> 04:46:51.200
So the purpose of this motion is to really take the temperature of the board to see if they're willing to look at an alternative to trying to focus on just the statewide reporting and look at an optional mean.

04:46:51.200 --> 04:46:54.200
That's basically the intent of this motion.

04:46:54.200 --> 04:47:01.200
Right. It's to figure out whether we're having a conversation about what are the flexibilities and assessments.

04:47:01.200 --> 04:47:03.200
I will second the motion.

04:47:03.200 --> 04:47:04.200
Thank you.

04:47:04.200 --> 04:47:07.200
Any further discussion of the motion?

04:47:07.200 --> 04:47:09.200
All in favor? No, we get a roll call vote.

04:47:09.200 --> 04:47:11.200
Brooks?

04:47:11.200 --> 04:47:14.200
Yes. Member Burr?

04:47:14.200 --> 04:47:16.200
Aye.

04:47:16.200 --> 04:47:18.200
President Darling-Hammond?

04:47:18.200 --> 04:47:19.200
Aye.

04:47:19.200 --> 04:47:20.200
Member Fatah?

04:47:20.200 --> 04:47:21.200
Aye.

04:47:21.200 --> 04:47:23.200
Member Glover-Woods?

04:47:23.200 --> 04:47:24.200
Yes.

04:47:24.200 --> 04:47:26.200
Member McQuillan?

04:47:26.200 --> 04:47:27.200
Yes.

04:47:27.200 --> 04:47:28.200
Member Navo?

04:47:28.200 --> 04:47:29.200
Aye.

04:47:29.200 --> 04:47:31.200
Member Patil-Brownson?

04:47:31.200 --> 04:47:32.200
Yes.

04:47:32.200 --> 04:47:34.200
Member Rodriguez?

04:47:34.200 --> 04:47:35.200
Yes.

04:47:35.200 --> 04:47:36.200
Member Rucker?

04:47:36.200 --> 04:47:37.200
Yes.

04:47:37.200 --> 04:47:39.200
Vice President Strauss?

04:47:39.200 --> 04:47:40.200
Yes.

04:47:40.200 --> 04:47:41.200
Member Son?

04:47:41.200 --> 04:47:42.200
Aye.

04:47:42.200 --> 04:47:46.200
Motion carries unanimously.

04:47:46.200 --> 04:47:52.200
Okay. So now we know what bucket we're in, what lake we're swimming in.

04:47:52.200 --> 04:48:05.200
And then I think the question that we have been trying to figure our way through is the question of is there a role for state assessments in this framework?

04:48:05.200 --> 04:48:07.200
Is there a state summit of assessments?

04:48:07.200 --> 04:48:22.200
Is there a role for local, locally selected according to our continuity, instructional continuity plans or other because assessments in some localities go beyond what they might have put in that report.

04:48:22.200 --> 04:48:27.200
You know, so we don't want to necessarily limit the possible options.

04:48:27.200 --> 04:48:52.200
That would be a useful and fair way of ensuring that the progress of students is being assessed against our state standards, reported to at minimum parents and educators and potentially to the public at some level of aggregation.

04:48:52.200 --> 04:49:08.200
Potentially, to Member Son's point, also disaggregated by subgroups, which I think wherever people are doing blanket assessments is possible to do because they have identifiers in the state student database.

04:49:08.200 --> 04:49:12.200
So that's the bucket we're going to work on now.

04:49:12.200 --> 04:49:14.200
And Member Rucker, you want to kick us off?

04:49:14.200 --> 04:49:15.200
Sure.

04:49:16.200 --> 04:49:32.200
When we started this whole conversation this morning, you know, I remarked and observed on the fact that the NAEP assessment itself was canceled altogether by the U.S. Department of Education and they have never changed their mind on doing that.

04:49:32.200 --> 04:49:45.200
The NAEP assessment actually creates the kind of state-right reporting and the type of disaggregated data that we are struggling with trying to figure out how to address under the requirements of this waiver.

04:49:45.200 --> 04:50:00.200
And so while the feds have relieved themselves of the burden of trying to figure out how to do virtual and remote assessments in the pandemic, the burden remains here on the state to try to figure out the same thing.

04:50:00.200 --> 04:50:07.200
And it is a burden for us because at this exact moment, 52 of 58 counties are in that purple designation.

04:50:07.200 --> 04:50:09.200
That's not my designation.

04:50:09.200 --> 04:50:17.200
Now, you know, there are moments when I have these fantasies that if I were in charge of the world and then I have to pause and enjoy that and then keep moving on.

04:50:17.200 --> 04:50:27.200
But this was a uniform set of criteria that was made to evaluate the circumstances that the pandemic has created.

04:50:27.200 --> 04:50:44.200
So the first piece of this as it relates to looking at how to make this case in this waiver is to explain that how the circumstances are different and how they have been established and created looking at the impact of the pandemic.

04:50:44.200 --> 04:50:47.200
So that's the first piece of making this case.

04:50:47.200 --> 04:50:52.200
The second piece is clearly spelled out in the letter as I don't want to read it to you again.

04:50:52.200 --> 04:51:05.200
But if the focus is to look at the types of assessments that will provide information to parents, educators and public districts have been given that flexibility in those learning.

04:51:05.200 --> 04:51:19.200
My assumption at the time when the bill that created the learning continuity plans was established was it was a mandate and that county offices had the responsibility to ensure that would be in place.

04:51:19.200 --> 04:51:32.200
In place if not in place creating this waiver and doing this proposal would would would require us to make sure we know what districts have or have not done this.

04:51:32.200 --> 04:51:40.200
But we are giving them to districts and passing on to the responsibility to understand versus there's a requirement to do assessing.

04:51:40.200 --> 04:51:45.200
There's a requirement to understand the status and the progress of that that their students are making.

04:51:45.200 --> 04:51:54.200
There's a requirement to report it publicly and there will be a requirement for the state to be able to have access to the assessment information they choose.

04:51:54.200 --> 04:52:12.200
What that assessment information can be could simply be those local assessments that are already identified in those learning continuity plans or those assessments are identified by charter schools because we have already identified valid and reliable alternative assessments to be used.

04:52:12.200 --> 04:52:21.200
It could be the dyslexia assessments that the state has identified for teachers and grades kindergarten through second grade to look at reading language arts progress.

04:52:21.200 --> 04:52:26.200
But the fact of the matter is we've done that work identified as a state board.

04:52:26.200 --> 04:52:35.200
What are the valid and reliable can be used and it doesn't have assessment provided by the state off the table.

04:52:35.200 --> 04:52:42.200
Because you already know there are 79 LEAs where that work has is already underway.

04:52:42.200 --> 04:52:53.200
So this gives us not only the broadest flexibility to work in our local context, but also the broadest flexibility for local districts to make the decision.

04:52:53.200 --> 04:53:00.200
What is the best assessment program for them to use going forward if we can make the case for this waiver?

04:53:05.200 --> 04:53:10.200
Others?

04:53:10.200 --> 04:53:15.200
Member Byrd did your hand go up and down?

04:53:15.200 --> 04:53:21.200
I had it up and I was slow in taking it down.

04:53:21.200 --> 04:53:23.200
I'll take the opportunity.

04:53:23.200 --> 04:53:26.200
I guess I do.

04:53:26.200 --> 04:53:31.200
I certainly am in favor of trying to use the local assessments as much as possible.

04:53:31.200 --> 04:53:49.200
But I'm also willing to consider the idea of I think what we talked about sort of decision rules of if schools if we set as specific conditions that schools have to be back in place under our health guidelines, not that they're bringing people back just to test.

04:53:49.200 --> 04:53:53.200
They have provided instruction for some minimal amount of time.

04:53:53.200 --> 04:53:58.200
I think I heard you say the expert advice was four weeks.

04:53:58.200 --> 04:54:19.200
And if the assessments, if the state assessment can be made in such a way that it is comparable across all school settings, because I think what we heard before was when we were talking about a different approach was that there would be some districts that are back, are giving, then others that are not.

04:54:19.200 --> 04:54:26.200
And I think it makes the information kind of meaningless if you can't really compare it and aggregate it, if that's what we're really trying to do.

04:54:26.200 --> 04:54:31.200
So I think if we think carefully, and again, I'm not sure we're ready to do that on the fly.

04:54:31.200 --> 04:54:35.200
So I'm like ticking them off in my head and we might need some more time.

04:54:35.200 --> 04:54:38.200
But I think it is it's it's worth considering.

04:54:38.200 --> 04:54:41.200
And again, I just want to restate.

04:54:41.200 --> 04:54:44.200
I don't want to get in a fight with the feds in 2013.

04:54:44.200 --> 04:54:46.200
I really wanted to fight with the feds.

04:54:46.200 --> 04:54:48.200
I do not.

04:54:48.200 --> 04:54:49.200
But I do.

04:54:49.200 --> 04:54:56.200
So I think we can put our best foot forward and to the the the language that member Rutgers repeated a couple of times.

04:54:56.200 --> 04:55:02.200
I do think they're inviting that they're inviting us to say, here are our unique settings.

04:55:02.200 --> 04:55:05.200
And here's what's happened in our state.

04:55:05.200 --> 04:55:08.200
We understand what your intent is and we share your intent.

04:55:08.200 --> 04:55:14.200
We want to make sure that we know how our children are doing and how we best can improve.

04:55:14.200 --> 04:55:19.200
But the circumstances are such that they haven't been in 100 years, literally.

04:55:19.200 --> 04:55:22.200
And we're trying to we're trying to survive that.

04:55:22.200 --> 04:55:27.200
And we're trying to make sure that the LEAs are doing the best they can on behalf of their kids.

04:55:27.200 --> 04:55:33.200
So it's not a case of put this in their face and say, too bad, we don't like what you came up with.

04:55:33.200 --> 04:55:36.200
It's we understand you're giving us the opportunity.

04:55:37.200 --> 04:55:46.200
And I just I wanted to ask you, Linda, because I I saw an Oregon document weeks ago about sort of an approach they were taking.

04:55:46.200 --> 04:55:54.200
And I thought that was their approach of saying, we understand even this was before the guidance, we understand what you want and we want the same thing.

04:55:54.200 --> 04:55:58.200
But given our local circumstances, here's what we can do.

04:55:58.200 --> 04:56:02.200
Here's a strategic piece with respect to our state assessment.

04:56:02.200 --> 04:56:05.200
And here's what we can do with respect to local assessments.

04:56:05.200 --> 04:56:08.200
And that's kind of what I'm hoping we can get to.

04:56:08.200 --> 04:56:17.200
So we're responsive to what our LEAs told us loud and clear, in my view, in letters and in their oral testimony.

04:56:17.200 --> 04:56:24.200
But we're also responsible for providing data to everybody to let them know where we are.

04:56:24.200 --> 04:56:31.200
But in a responsible way that that recognizes the individual circumstances.

04:56:31.200 --> 04:56:37.200
Yeah. And I think that what Oregon did propose to do is very similar to what we're talking about.

04:56:37.200 --> 04:56:53.200
That is, well, what we have been in various ways talking about, which is to use the state assessment where it's usable and useful and then to have alternatives such that every student is assessed and parents are informed.

04:56:53.200 --> 04:56:59.200
The question about aggregation is, you know, one of the questions.

04:56:59.200 --> 04:57:09.200
If we want to be able to aggregate all of those data in some unit dimensional way across the state, that's not possible to do.

04:57:09.200 --> 04:57:14.200
You can do some equating of tests and things, you know, like SAT and ACT.

04:57:14.200 --> 04:57:20.200
But if the main goal is to be able to aggregate the statewide summative assessment is the is the way, you know,

04:57:20.200 --> 04:57:25.200
statewide assessment is the only way to be able to aggregate meaningfully across the state.

04:57:25.200 --> 04:57:28.200
But we know that that's not going to be available for everyone.

04:57:28.200 --> 04:57:32.200
I need to point out, I need to point out that's not what this letter says.

04:57:32.200 --> 04:57:34.200
I'm not saying it does.

04:57:34.200 --> 04:57:39.200
I'm just trying to there were other questions about aggregation that came up.

04:57:39.200 --> 04:57:43.200
And so I'm just trying to answer those questions that.

04:57:43.200 --> 04:57:57.200
But, you know, the the assessments that districts had to choose in the fall are aggregable, at least to the district level.

04:57:57.200 --> 04:58:06.200
And in some cases, they're aggregable across districts because we had a limited number that people could choose and many people chose the same ones.

04:58:06.200 --> 04:58:15.200
So, again, depending on, you know, all of the purposes one has for assessment, which include primarily guiding teaching and learning for individual children

04:58:15.200 --> 04:58:23.200
and making sure that we are helping on what they know and helping them learn the next thing and informing parents and teachers to support that.

04:58:23.200 --> 04:58:32.200
But then above that, the questions of aggregation and disaggregation leads you to different parameters for what we want to consider.

04:58:32.200 --> 04:58:38.200
So I just wanted to have that set of ideas in on the table.

04:58:38.200 --> 04:58:41.200
Member Sun and then member Navo.

04:58:41.200 --> 04:58:42.200
Thank you.

04:58:42.200 --> 04:58:49.200
So spring off of what member Rucker and member Burr had say had already said.

04:58:49.200 --> 04:59:03.200
So, you know, I I buy into what member Rucker has the dotted line she has drawn between the intent of the federal letter and some of the wording within the federal letter.

04:59:03.200 --> 04:59:16.200
And I think we could make a good case if we are to replace, if you will, or in lieu of the statewide assessment for the local assessments that are already being given out.

04:59:16.200 --> 04:59:30.200
Then I think we would need to make a strong case for how these local assessments can as much as possible meet the the state assessments.

04:59:30.200 --> 04:59:37.200
And we did this work, yes, with verified data for charter schools and setting those very clear parameters.

04:59:38.200 --> 04:59:45.200
I'm not sure that currently those those assessments are being given under those same requirements that we're requiring of charters right now.

04:59:45.200 --> 04:59:48.200
So that would be something we need to put in place.

04:59:48.200 --> 05:00:04.200
And and to member Burr's point, I don't think we really kind of thought through all of that and that this will require an additional conversation to make sure that the data is the assessments are given to a broad number of students,

05:00:04.200 --> 05:00:16.200
including our special ed students and our Yale students, that they're that they are consistently given according to what the testing requirements are for those assessments.

05:00:16.200 --> 05:00:23.200
You know, all those things that we're saying charter schools have to follow, we really need to be we need to make put that in place.

05:00:23.200 --> 05:00:27.200
Yeah, Rachel, I have a question. I may be thinking about this too simply.

05:00:27.200 --> 05:00:31.200
I meant to go back to Rachel, so I'm glad you're directing Rachel.

05:00:31.200 --> 05:00:36.200
Roll in any of the other questions you were prepared to answer when you answer member Navo's question.

05:00:36.200 --> 05:00:40.200
I can I can wait, Rachel, if you want to respond.

05:00:40.200 --> 05:00:44.200
I was just going to provide a little bit of clarification.

05:00:45.200 --> 05:00:47.200
That might be helpful to the conversation.

05:00:47.200 --> 05:00:56.200
And I think it goes along with what you're bringing up members on the the first clarification is just that county offices were not required to approve the learning continuity plans.

05:00:56.200 --> 05:00:59.200
They are required to approve LCAPS.

05:00:59.200 --> 05:01:05.200
But for this year underneath SB 98, all they were they were required to receive them.

05:01:05.200 --> 05:01:10.200
They couldn't provide feedback if they would like, but there was no requirement to do so.

05:01:10.200 --> 05:01:13.200
So just that piece of clarification.

05:01:13.200 --> 05:01:20.200
The other piece that I think is important to keep in mind with that was that there was no requirement to do so.

05:01:20.200 --> 05:01:25.200
But there was no requirement to do so. So just that piece of clarification.

05:01:25.200 --> 05:01:38.200
The other piece that I think is important to keep in mind with that while the learning continuity plan did ask for data and how districts or LEAs plan to monitor progress,

05:01:38.200 --> 05:01:49.200
it did not require that they use anything that had been previously state adopted, was valid and reliable, aligned to California content standards.

05:01:49.200 --> 05:01:55.200
It wasn't required that it be across a district or school site or even within a grade level.

05:01:55.200 --> 05:02:03.200
So I think those are just important pieces to for clarification as you're talking through the learning continuity plan requirements.

05:02:03.200 --> 05:02:05.200
Thank you for that.

05:02:07.200 --> 05:02:12.200
OK, member Navo, do you want to ask your question or just a couple of clarifying questions?

05:02:13.200 --> 05:02:21.200
I'm not familiar, obviously, with the federal waiver process, Rachel, so maybe I'm thinking about it too simplicity, too simple.

05:02:21.200 --> 05:02:33.200
If we apply for a waiver from federal assessments and it's approved, then we would lose funding, correct?

05:02:33.200 --> 05:02:38.200
We don't lose funding just because we're asking for it, only if it's approved.

05:02:38.200 --> 05:02:40.200
If it's disapproved.

05:02:40.200 --> 05:02:43.200
Right, right, right.

05:02:43.200 --> 05:02:49.200
My assumption is that if it is denied and then we are unable to meet the requirements of the law.

05:02:49.200 --> 05:02:58.200
OK, so in the in the request, is it unreasonable to make two considerations?

05:02:58.200 --> 05:03:08.200
One, attending to the thoughts and points that my fellow board members have already made regarding the complexities of the state of California

05:03:08.200 --> 05:03:16.200
in relationship to the reality that most of our kids have been out of school for quite considerably longer than many other states.

05:03:16.200 --> 05:03:21.200
And we're quite larger, generally speaking, than any other state.

05:03:21.200 --> 05:03:29.200
And so there's unique circumstances related to California that complicate our ability to get students back on campus.

05:03:29.200 --> 05:03:36.200
And so could we make the consideration that, yes, we would like a waiver from the federal obligation of assessments?

05:03:36.200 --> 05:03:39.200
We have a plan B for local assessments.

05:03:39.200 --> 05:03:45.200
It's probably imperfect, but it's it we do have a system.

05:03:45.200 --> 05:03:59.200
And the second consideration is if that is not an option, then we have we will adhere to the state assessment with the request for federal flexibilities.

05:03:59.200 --> 05:04:08.200
So couldn't is it unreasonable, I guess, to to put two options in the waiver for the feds to consider?

05:04:08.200 --> 05:04:13.200
Because what I'm thinking about, if I'm a local and I'm listening to this conversation.

05:04:13.200 --> 05:04:21.200
And and we go for a request for a waiver, I have to bank that we get the waiver, not knowing what the other outcome is.

05:04:21.200 --> 05:04:26.200
But if I know what the rules are, if I know, OK, we're going to apply for a waiver.

05:04:26.200 --> 05:04:29.200
We are probably likely not going to get it.

05:04:29.200 --> 05:04:34.200
And the other rule of the game is I can I can start my testing now or I can push it off.

05:04:34.200 --> 05:04:38.200
But the end of the line for testing is July 30th.

05:04:38.200 --> 05:04:43.200
Then I as a as a local educational agency can make the decision.

05:04:43.200 --> 05:04:52.200
I either hope that we get the waiver and I hedge my bets longer waiting for students to get back on campus or I start now.

05:04:52.200 --> 05:04:56.200
But those that have started know that they're going to their test will be validated.

05:04:56.200 --> 05:05:06.200
Those that have not started have an option to start with the idea that if they wait too long, they're going to put themselves up against the wall.

05:05:06.200 --> 05:05:09.200
Because what I heard you say was we don't know when we'll get this.

05:05:09.200 --> 05:05:11.200
We don't know when we'll get an answer from them.

05:05:11.200 --> 05:05:14.200
It's considerably long.

05:05:15.200 --> 05:05:26.200
And I would just note that there's the the general treatment of a blanket waiver request, which can take a very long time.

05:05:26.200 --> 05:05:34.200
And the language in this letter, which I think suggests that they're going to try to work much more iteratively with states in this moment.

05:05:34.200 --> 05:05:36.200
But there would still be some delay.

05:05:36.200 --> 05:05:42.200
We don't I don't think it would necessarily be the same delay that we would have if we put in for a general waiver.

05:05:42.200 --> 05:05:45.200
Oh, gosh. OK. OK. Well, that makes that that's a little bit better.

05:05:45.200 --> 05:05:52.200
I just think that I guess I'm struggling with with the idea that we have to just say it's a or B.

05:05:52.200 --> 05:05:58.200
Can we say we'd like we would prefer a and if not, we'll we would like B.

05:05:58.200 --> 05:06:07.200
The only thing I would clarify, Matt, and again, I would invite Judy to share if I'm incorrect, because I'm not a lawyer.

05:06:07.200 --> 05:06:16.200
As I had shared before, until we have an approval of the waiver, we would need to continue to move forward under what the law requires.

05:06:16.200 --> 05:06:34.200
One thing we might consider doing is asking our state board executive director and CDE leadership staff to within some parameters that we articulate to come up with what the content of those flexibilities might be.

05:06:34.200 --> 05:06:39.200
We've begun to, you know, think through what some of those might be.

05:06:39.200 --> 05:06:59.200
And then to take member Burr's suggestion, come back in either on March 17th at our next board meeting or at a meeting that is called earlier than that to lay out what those flexibilities would be or what those strategies for assessment would be in the interim.

05:06:59.200 --> 05:07:14.200
I just said member Navo, if districts are in a position and want to just continue to do the assessments that are available to them, that's something they can do rather than banking on what's going to come out at the other end.

05:07:14.200 --> 05:07:17.200
Member Glover Woods is next.

05:07:17.200 --> 05:07:19.200
Thank you.

05:07:19.200 --> 05:07:24.200
I have to share I'm concerned about time.

05:07:24.200 --> 05:07:42.200
Only because as we consider options and flexibilities or wait for feedback on what those flexibilities are in the field, they need to be able to make decisions and I know some of that's already been said.

05:07:42.200 --> 05:08:05.200
If I'm understanding our conversation correctly, it seems that what is kind of being proposed is if you want to move forward with administering the statewide assessment and it's safe to be able to do so in an in-person setting, go forward and do that.

05:08:05.200 --> 05:08:15.200
If you have a situation where that's not safe to do, you would not administer the statewide assessment.

05:08:15.200 --> 05:08:25.200
However, you should use local data in order to be able to communicate to parents and educators and whatnot.

05:08:25.200 --> 05:08:30.200
That's kind of what I'm hearing and I guess I'll kind of echo a statement that's been made a few times in the meeting.

05:08:30.200 --> 05:08:37.200
I'm starting to get a little confused on where we are and I know there's a lot of work being done to try to simplify it.

05:08:37.200 --> 05:08:42.200
So let me try to ask my question more direct.

05:08:42.200 --> 05:09:05.200
If we were to consider allowing those LEAs that want to administer the statewide assessment and it's safe for them to be able to do so, are we able to allow for those who are unable to do it and it's not ever safe to do so, to use local assessments?

05:09:05.200 --> 05:09:07.200
So that's my first question.

05:09:07.200 --> 05:09:23.200
And then my second question would be, if that was an option, does it still require that assessment to be written into the waiver or do we need to get permission to even do that?

05:09:23.200 --> 05:09:25.200
I don't think we need permission to do that.

05:09:25.200 --> 05:09:35.200
I'm moving to where I have better Wi-Fi because I think maybe my Wi-Fi is the problem right now.

05:09:35.200 --> 05:09:40.200
But we would need to figure out what our waiver is, you know, ultimately.

05:09:40.200 --> 05:09:45.200
I think the way you stated it is potentially accurate.

05:09:45.200 --> 05:09:51.200
One of the things that the department has volunteered to do is to work with us on what those flexibilities might be.

05:09:51.200 --> 05:09:59.200
So we could say today that we're going to figure out those flexibilities within the parameters.

05:09:59.200 --> 05:10:03.200
Does somebody have a guitar on?

05:10:03.200 --> 05:10:11.200
It's muted.

05:10:11.200 --> 05:10:15.200
Linda, if you just pause a minute, it appears there's a problem with the phone works here.

05:10:15.200 --> 05:10:16.200
They're trying to fix it.

05:10:16.200 --> 05:10:20.200
Meanwhile, everyone can enjoy this peaceful musical interlude during this discussion.

05:10:20.200 --> 05:10:23.200
It signals that we're finding harmony.

05:10:23.200 --> 05:10:26.200
Exactly.

05:10:26.200 --> 05:10:27.200
We're almost there.

05:10:27.200 --> 05:10:32.200
We just have to get in tune. We'll be fine.

05:10:32.200 --> 05:10:42.200
This could have been much worse, you know, in terms of the music that is selected.

05:10:42.200 --> 05:10:45.200
OK, we're assured they're working on it. It should be any minute.

05:10:45.200 --> 05:11:07.200
OK, I like it.

05:11:07.200 --> 05:11:26.200
Somebody felt that we needed to chill out, and they're helping us do that.

05:11:26.200 --> 05:11:35.200
I won't try to talk through it, but I will just say I see hands from Member Glover-Woods, Member Strauss, and Member Becker,

05:11:35.200 --> 05:11:40.200
which we'll get to in a moment.

05:11:40.200 --> 05:11:43.200
That was a nice interlude.

05:11:43.200 --> 05:11:51.200
So I was just responding to say, yes, I think that, frankly, the way you framed it, Member Glover-Woods, is potentially accurate for one path,

05:11:51.200 --> 05:11:59.200
which would be to say we're going to work out, and I would recommend that we consider asking the staff of CDE

05:11:59.200 --> 05:12:10.200
and our State Board Executive Director to work out an approach within parameters that we would set.

05:12:10.200 --> 05:12:18.200
They've been invited by the Department of Education to, as the letter states, to work through flexibilities, and they could begin that process.

05:12:18.200 --> 05:12:29.200
And then we could bring it back as quickly as possible, but no later than March 17th, for a vote on something that's very much more defined,

05:12:29.200 --> 05:12:42.200
but that would ensure that we have an expectation for assessment and the reporting of results to parents and educators, et cetera.

05:12:42.200 --> 05:12:49.200
I think that does, in the next couple of weeks, that would mean that people who wanted to proceed with the state assessments could do so.

05:12:49.200 --> 05:12:59.200
In terms of locally selected assessments, they're usually not local assessments per se, they're usually national tests that have been locally selected.

05:12:59.200 --> 05:13:09.200
People are already using them and already have data, so it doesn't create a new requirement to do something in the next two weeks.

05:13:10.200 --> 05:13:22.200
It appears from the data we've gotten from the survey that most districts are already using those assessments,

05:13:22.200 --> 05:13:28.200
so it doesn't necessarily propose a new obligation on them in the short run.

05:13:28.200 --> 05:13:37.200
But that would give us a chance to also get clearer about what data are available, get clearer about the context for giving the statewide assessments,

05:13:37.200 --> 05:13:42.200
which some people may choose to take the options to shorten them further, et cetera.

05:13:42.200 --> 05:13:49.200
Get the parameters, the criteria in a place where we can vote on it.

05:13:49.200 --> 05:13:51.200
Member Strauss, you're next in line.

05:13:51.200 --> 05:13:57.200
So I want to follow up on what Member Glover-Woods said and what you, President Darling-Hammond, said.

05:13:57.200 --> 05:14:08.200
I would like to be able to give direction to LEAs today, which says the State Board does not expect you to administer state assessments in a remote setting,

05:14:08.200 --> 05:14:17.200
that we understand that students need to be back in school in a safe way for three to four weeks before the assessment would be given.

05:14:17.200 --> 05:14:22.200
So that would tell people who haven't opened yet, like you don't have to start assessing.

05:14:22.200 --> 05:14:36.200
The second thing could also be we expect LEAs to continue with the guidance that they completed in their learning continuity plan to administer local assessments and provide feedback.

05:14:36.200 --> 05:14:46.200
So we at least tell people you're supposed to keep doing those learning continuity assessments and we don't want you to administer in a remote setting.

05:14:46.200 --> 05:14:48.200
We want you back in school first.

05:14:48.200 --> 05:14:57.200
So that would at least tell people because I think districts were trying to figure out how to do it remotely because we have so many not back yet.

05:14:57.200 --> 05:15:07.200
So I'm just wondering if that's a tweener that we could, while we're working on the other options to say we want students back before the state assessment is given in person.

05:15:07.200 --> 05:15:20.200
I think that just to be clear, the other assessments that people can use and have used are often also delivered online.

05:15:20.200 --> 05:15:31.200
They typically do not require secure browsers, which we heard vividly illustrated by Member Fattah in terms of what the challenges are with that.

05:15:31.200 --> 05:15:38.200
They are not high stakes and so they often don't take as much time.

05:15:38.200 --> 05:15:44.200
They don't have quite always the bandwidth issues, but they could still have issues.

05:15:44.200 --> 05:16:00.200
So I don't know that we can assume that people can just, you know, if they're having challenges giving those, they may also have to wait on some of that until there is more bandwidth.

05:16:00.200 --> 05:16:25.200
But I think the point that you're making that we expect people not to do that, you know, assess kids in ways that are untenable or unsafe is the good point to be making and that we do expect that in this school year districts will find ways to assess all students.

05:16:25.200 --> 05:16:39.200
And that those who can move ahead with assessments that they are doing or with the state assessments that are now coming online as of this week are welcome to do so, but are not required to do so till it is safe and tenable.

05:16:39.200 --> 05:16:45.200
Does that capture the intent of your thinking?

05:16:45.200 --> 05:17:04.200
Yeah, I think just to reinforce that we understand that it is something about the same thing that the federal guidance letter said that the student that we, I guess the main message should not be brought back to school in person just for the purpose of testing.

05:17:04.200 --> 05:17:15.200
And that remote assessment is that we expect state assessments to be given once students are back in a safe environment for several weeks before it is administered.

05:17:15.200 --> 05:17:24.200
I think that's fine. I think there are some places that have been able to do remote administration of different things successfully.

05:17:24.200 --> 05:17:40.200
I don't think we want to cut off the opportunity for people who are successfully doing that, but we certainly don't want to put other districts and schools in a situation where they're unable to make assessment a thoughtful, well supported process.

05:17:40.200 --> 05:17:50.200
And if it's in person after kids have been back long enough to have adjusted and had, you know, all of the other social emotional supports that they need to be attaching back to school.

05:17:50.200 --> 05:18:03.200
I think we've got member Rucker. Is there any other member who wants to be recognized so that we can be sure we can move forward and wrap this up?

05:18:04.200 --> 05:18:24.200
Okay. So to the point that I believe we're beginning to come to some consonants on, you know, when in reading my first reaction when I read the guidance letter on Monday afternoon was, you know, this voice, my mother's voice in the back of my head.

05:18:24.200 --> 05:18:39.200
You know, the last thing I want to do is hurt you, but it's still on my list. And so the state is the feds are trying to give states a way to figure out how to deal with what is a very difficult set of circumstances.

05:18:39.200 --> 05:18:50.200
And so I think there's a need in contemplating the way we phrase this motion to separate intent from action or activity.

05:18:50.200 --> 05:19:10.200
The motion that we need to try to craft right now in giving guidance to the CDE staff is to craft our intent to help to help us develop a proposal that clearly states our intent to make sure we create assessment practices.

05:19:10.200 --> 05:19:24.200
Assessment practices as a response to the waiver guidance that will assure public reporting of student assessments with about progress on English language arts and mathematics.

05:19:24.200 --> 05:19:32.200
So that public reporting is done in a uniform way and based on uniform activities and local options.

05:19:32.200 --> 05:19:56.200
So that's the intent. The activities as specified and looked at more particular with greater particularity by board member Glover Woods and even board member Burr about whether we're talking about state assessments or collection of locally approved assessments or even as the staff has pointed out whether or not districts are even using them.

05:19:56.200 --> 05:20:04.200
Those are the activities that we would craft in our own guidance to the districts if this waiver is approved.

05:20:04.200 --> 05:20:14.200
So the particularity of what we're trying to do with the district with the state and the feds to express our intent to address that flexibility they're saying we can have is one thing.

05:20:14.200 --> 05:20:27.200
And then as board member Strauss said what we turn around and say to the state the districts in our state is something else because what districts are still going to hear is that you're still going to need to do assessments.

05:20:27.200 --> 05:20:38.200
There is still an accountability activity called reporting that you still need to do. But what the important part is it doesn't have high stakes.

05:20:38.200 --> 05:20:52.200
That's going to be the outcome of this waiver if we get it. We're still going to be doing assessing. We're still going to be doing reporting but we have decoupled the stakes that comes with the high stakes assessment.

05:20:52.200 --> 05:21:04.200
So with the collection of motions that we've made in trying to craft this proposal those are the three big takeaways that need to be clearly communicated with districts.

05:21:04.200 --> 05:21:12.200
And again when I finally read that letter what the districts are going to see is well if the shoe fits it's ugly because we're still going to have to test.

05:21:12.200 --> 05:21:21.200
But that's what the three big takeaways in the packet of what we're trying to cobble together for this waiver should be able to to create.

05:21:21.200 --> 05:21:29.200
Please don't ask me to try to put that in a motion because otherwise I'll just say we want to assess we want to report and take away the high stakes.

05:21:29.200 --> 05:21:34.200
And that's my motion. So if somebody wants to accept it that way I'm happy to offer it.

05:21:35.200 --> 05:21:41.200
But President Darling-Hammond is probably far better at explaining those three points for our motion.

05:21:41.200 --> 05:21:48.200
Do you want to clarify again what you see as three points? I'm not sure I got exactly the three right bullets.

05:21:48.200 --> 05:22:16.200
Okay. So with all of the motions that we have put together our goal is to cobble together a proposal in and to give the CDE staff guidance to cobble together a waiver proposal that focuses on creating an option for assessment that focuses on providing data to the public about the progress of students.

05:22:16.200 --> 05:22:34.200
On on assessments in English language arts and mathematics we have already passed a motion to de link the high stakes in accountability and high stakes testing by de linking the record reporting requirement or the labeling of school.

05:22:34.200 --> 05:22:47.200
So we're going to still test but we have removed the high stakes and then we're going to look at how to do the reporting what kind of assessments we report and how the reporting is done.

05:22:47.200 --> 05:22:52.200
That is the third piece that we would ask for flexibility to be able to do.

05:22:52.200 --> 05:23:07.200
So we're moving away from statewide aggregate reporting because that is not what the letter clearly requires to requiring state right reporting in a uniform way based on the guidance we'd be allowed to create.

05:23:07.200 --> 05:23:17.200
So those would be the three parts. And we I don't know that we need a motion with that second part because we already passed those motions from accountability.

05:23:17.200 --> 05:23:46.200
Right now what I hear you saying is that we would move to ask the state board staff and the CDE staff to develop a proposal or maybe a set of proposals that will provide assessment ensure that we can provide assessment data to parents of the public in ELA and math and that will propose a means for aggregated reporting of those data.

05:23:47.200 --> 05:23:55.200
Yeah. Uniform reporting but it doesn't necessarily mean that we're aggregating it as a state wide.

05:23:55.200 --> 05:24:00.200
I get that. I think they've heard that part but I'm just trying to get a clean motion here.

05:24:00.200 --> 05:24:06.200
Yeah. Yeah. But aggregate is a is a specific term of art. So we aggregate. Yeah.

05:24:06.200 --> 05:24:19.200
Aggregate. Well I think what we earlier heard is we want to be we want a proposal about how the data could be aggregated and how it could be disaggregated by student group.

05:24:19.200 --> 05:24:33.200
So we don't need to sit here today and figure out exactly what that is. We will ask the staff to come back to us with that as quickly as possible and no later than March 17.

05:24:33.200 --> 05:24:44.200
Is that so I'm seeing something go up on the screen. My eyes are not good enough to track all of this.

05:24:44.200 --> 05:24:59.200
We're about to have a written version of this.

05:24:59.200 --> 05:25:04.200
Does that work.

05:25:04.200 --> 05:25:12.200
And that will propose a means for yes aggregated uniform is fine.

05:25:12.200 --> 05:25:21.200
Agra uniform reporting of that data in both aggregated and disaggregated form just to get both of those terms in there.

05:25:21.200 --> 05:25:27.200
And we'll see what the proposal can be once we've got the additional data.

05:25:27.200 --> 05:25:34.200
And at some point after this they'll send us a copy of that motion. So we have a printed copy of what we voted on.

05:25:34.200 --> 05:25:37.200
Yes of course.

05:25:37.200 --> 05:25:41.200
I'm just reading again.

05:25:41.200 --> 05:25:50.200
Rather than an option for assessment could we say that focuses on a plan for assessments.

05:25:50.200 --> 05:26:07.200
Plan for assessment that provides data for set for assessments I guess assessments plural that provide data to parents educators in the public about the progress of students and ELA and math.

05:26:07.200 --> 05:26:14.200
And that will propose a mean for uniform reporting of that data in both aggregated and disaggregated.

05:26:14.200 --> 05:26:22.200
I feel like doing a mic drop.

05:26:22.200 --> 05:26:29.200
I will see if somebody wants to make Patricia Patricia. Do you want to make that motion.

05:26:29.200 --> 05:26:35.200
I will move that I will move what's on the screen rather than read it back again and mess it up.

05:26:35.200 --> 05:26:44.200
All right. We're going to still have discussion. So I saw member Glover Woods I saw your hand go up and down. I'll still come back around for discussion. Is there a second on the motion.

05:26:44.200 --> 05:26:46.200
I will second.

05:26:46.200 --> 05:26:54.200
Thank you. And then is there discussion of the motion. Member Glover Woods and then I think member Rodriguez did you have your hand up.

05:26:54.200 --> 05:27:01.200
You know I was just it was about the motion the wordsmithing but I'm okay. Thank you.

05:27:01.200 --> 05:27:04.200
Member Glover Woods and then member Burr.

05:27:04.200 --> 05:27:29.200
So I just want to be sure that in this motion by the use of the term assessments meaning plural that we are that we are communicating that there is kind of best say this that we're communicating that LEAs may or may not have to administer the

05:27:29.200 --> 05:27:33.200
the SBAC.

05:27:33.200 --> 05:27:41.200
I'm just missing a little clarity. I realize it's important for it to be kind of vague into how the proposal may be developed.

05:27:41.200 --> 05:27:46.200
But again I'm wondering.

05:27:46.200 --> 05:28:00.200
The intention of the conversation has been to say what do we do in situations where there's not a path to safely and appropriately administering the SBAC.

05:28:00.200 --> 05:28:05.200
I do want to have a noun verb agreement there. It should be assessments that provide.

05:28:05.200 --> 05:28:11.200
Take off that as my old English teacher.

05:28:11.200 --> 05:28:13.200
Thank you.

05:28:13.200 --> 05:28:22.200
Member Burr before I go to member member Glover Woods and did you get questions to ask you look like you might.

05:28:22.200 --> 05:28:32.200
I believe I have because again as I'm reading it. I believe I am. I just want to be sure that clearly.

05:28:32.200 --> 05:28:44.200
That we're clearly communicating that what we're looking at our options if it's if we're unable if the LEA is unable to administer the SBAC.

05:28:44.200 --> 05:28:46.200
That's what's being looked at.

05:28:46.200 --> 05:28:49.200
Remember Burr and then member Rodriguez.

05:28:49.200 --> 05:28:55.200
Yeah, just a process question. I'm sorry I lost connection there again for a while.

05:28:55.200 --> 05:29:04.200
Is the idea here that the staff will bring back a waiver proposal that will then vote on from March or this.

05:29:04.200 --> 05:29:05.200
Yes.

05:29:05.200 --> 05:29:06.200
Is that.

05:29:06.200 --> 05:29:07.200
Yes.

05:29:07.200 --> 05:29:08.200
Okay. Thank you.

05:29:08.200 --> 05:29:11.200
We actually referenced you while you were gone.

05:29:11.200 --> 05:29:12.200
Your proposal.

05:29:12.200 --> 05:29:19.200
And what I suggest is that we would do that as soon as possible but no later than March 17.

05:29:19.200 --> 05:29:28.200
So that there's you know if we you know get all the right information sooner we can call another meeting for that purpose.

05:29:28.200 --> 05:29:30.200
But if that we will go by the next coordinate.

05:29:30.200 --> 05:29:32.200
Remember Rodriguez.

05:29:32.200 --> 05:29:37.200
So I will I will add my wordsmithing suggestion.

05:29:37.200 --> 05:29:47.200
I'm just wondering if we can say monitor student progress if we can add that in there because it's you know it's like it's for the public.

05:29:47.200 --> 05:29:59.200
But as educators we want to monitor to make sure that we can prevent downward spirals for students so that we can intervene.

05:29:59.200 --> 05:30:04.200
So it's an important word for me as an educator to have monitor in there.

05:30:04.200 --> 05:30:09.200
Why don't we just say that monitors instead of will monitor.

05:30:09.200 --> 05:30:15.200
It doesn't necessarily need to be future tense and maybe that monitors the progress.

05:30:15.200 --> 05:30:16.200
Thank you.

05:30:16.200 --> 05:30:17.200
All right.

05:30:17.200 --> 05:30:22.200
I feel like we need the guitar music back while we vote.

05:30:22.200 --> 05:30:31.200
I think it needs to be noted that a number of friendly amendments have been made since the motion was originally introduced.

05:30:31.200 --> 05:30:33.200
Would you like to remove it?

05:30:33.200 --> 05:30:35.200
Would you like to re hyphen move it?

05:30:35.200 --> 05:30:36.200
Yes.

05:30:36.200 --> 05:30:37.200
I will move it again.

05:30:37.200 --> 05:31:02.200
I will move to accept the friendly amendments that the board delegate authority to the State Board of Education or executive director in collaboration with Department of Education staff to develop a waiver proposal to bring back to the board that focuses on a plan for assessments that provide data to parents educators and the public.

05:31:02.200 --> 05:31:09.200
And my English teacher says which monitors the progress of students in English language arts and mathematics.

05:31:09.200 --> 05:31:18.200
And that will propose a mean for uniform a means for uniform reporting of that data in both aggregated and disaggregated forms.

05:31:18.200 --> 05:31:28.200
I friendly amendments in all the English teachers who are helping here and I will re second the motion.

05:31:28.200 --> 05:31:29.200
Thank you very much.

05:31:29.200 --> 05:31:30.200
Thank you very much.

05:31:30.200 --> 05:31:33.200
Is there any further discussion of the motion?

05:31:33.200 --> 05:31:38.200
Member Rodriguez is your hand up for a reason or it's just OK.

05:31:38.200 --> 05:31:39.200
All right.

05:31:39.200 --> 05:31:41.200
With that, we will call the roll.

05:31:41.200 --> 05:31:44.200
Can you call the roll for a vote?

05:31:44.200 --> 05:31:46.200
Member Burr.

05:31:46.200 --> 05:31:47.200
Aye.

05:31:47.200 --> 05:31:49.200
President Darlin Hammond.

05:31:49.200 --> 05:31:50.200
Aye.

05:31:50.200 --> 05:31:51.200
Member Fattah.

05:31:51.200 --> 05:31:52.200
Aye.

05:31:52.200 --> 05:31:54.200
Member Glover Woods.

05:31:54.200 --> 05:31:56.200
Yes.

05:31:56.200 --> 05:31:58.200
Member McQuillin.

05:31:58.200 --> 05:31:59.200
Aye.

05:31:59.200 --> 05:32:01.200
Member Navo.

05:32:01.200 --> 05:32:02.200
Aye.

05:32:02.200 --> 05:32:04.200
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:32:04.200 --> 05:32:05.200
Yes.

05:32:05.200 --> 05:32:07.200
Member Rodriguez.

05:32:07.200 --> 05:32:08.200
Yes.

05:32:08.200 --> 05:32:10.200
Member Rucker.

05:32:10.200 --> 05:32:11.200
Yes.

05:32:11.200 --> 05:32:13.200
Vice President Strauss.

05:32:13.200 --> 05:32:14.200
Yes.

05:32:14.200 --> 05:32:15.200
Member Sun.

05:32:15.200 --> 05:32:17.200
Aye.

05:32:17.200 --> 05:32:20.200
Motion passes unanimously.

05:32:20.200 --> 05:32:23.200
We did it.

05:32:23.200 --> 05:32:27.200
And Brooks, you're going to email motion five to all of us, right?

05:32:27.200 --> 05:32:28.200
All right.

05:32:28.200 --> 05:32:29.200
Thank you all.

05:32:29.200 --> 05:32:33.200
I think we actually need to open up the floor for public comment.

05:32:33.200 --> 05:32:36.200
Did we cover everything?

05:32:36.200 --> 05:32:37.200
Sorry?

05:32:37.200 --> 05:32:40.200
Did we cover everything we needed to cover?

05:32:40.200 --> 05:32:41.200
We did.

05:32:41.200 --> 05:32:44.200
We've covered everything we need to cover on this item.

05:32:44.200 --> 05:32:49.200
We do need to open up for general public comment.

05:32:49.200 --> 05:32:56.200
Why don't I let you take a five-minute break while we get the public comment thing, or would you like to just keep going on?

05:32:56.200 --> 05:32:57.200
Let's just keep going.

05:32:57.200 --> 05:33:00.200
All right.

05:33:00.200 --> 05:33:09.200
So we'll take up agenda item three, general public comment, which is invited on any matter that was not included in the printed agenda.

05:33:09.200 --> 05:33:12.200
We'll open the phone line for the public comment queue.

05:33:12.200 --> 05:33:19.200
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the number shown on the public comment slide.

05:33:19.200 --> 05:33:23.200
And are there any public comments?

05:33:24.200 --> 05:33:27.200
Yes, we do have one person for public comment.

05:33:27.200 --> 05:33:35.200
Just a reminder, this is for item three, anything that was not on the agenda.

05:33:35.200 --> 05:33:38.200
We have two people in the queue.

05:33:38.200 --> 05:33:42.200
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:33:42.200 --> 05:33:47.200
Your time starts now.

05:33:47.200 --> 05:33:49.200
My name is Dina Seelig.

05:33:49.200 --> 05:33:55.200
I'm a former San Francisco Unified High School ethnic lit teacher with a UCLA master's in education.

05:33:55.200 --> 05:34:02.200
I supplemented with primary sources to reveal America's true history through lenses of ethnic discrimination and race.

05:34:02.200 --> 05:34:12.200
If my diverse students were to be stereotypically categorized as the critical race theory does, their authentic voices would be hindered.

05:34:12.200 --> 05:34:16.200
All races and cultures are valuable to society through their contributions.

05:34:16.200 --> 05:34:20.200
The ESMC must not indoctrinate and alienate ethnic groups.

05:34:20.200 --> 05:34:25.200
Even CASEL's revised Transform for Social Emotional Learning uses the CRT framework.

05:34:25.200 --> 05:34:29.200
Students learn to critically examine the root causes of inequity.

05:34:29.200 --> 05:34:36.200
Upper income white adolescents are encouraged to take responsibility for social inequities while exhibiting racial guilt.

05:34:36.200 --> 05:34:44.200
This inhibits inclusive school communities and contradicts the SEL's goal of establishing a trusting environment and collaborative relationships.

05:34:44.200 --> 05:34:52.200
Teachers required to take CRT training will also encounter discriminatory, age-inappropriate tenants and resources.

05:34:52.200 --> 05:34:59.200
Let's build bridges through shared struggles without the oppressor.

05:34:59.200 --> 05:35:03.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:35:03.200 --> 05:35:07.200
Your time starts now.

05:35:07.200 --> 05:35:10.200
My name is Joe Nalvin.

05:35:10.200 --> 05:35:14.200
I teach cultural anthropology at the University of San Diego.

05:35:14.200 --> 05:35:23.200
I affirm what the previous caller said and would add that in terms of teaching about different cultures,

05:35:23.200 --> 05:35:30.200
which is what we're doing here in California, that we need an approach that promotes multiple perspectives.

05:35:30.200 --> 05:35:39.200
Critical race theory actually works against the very goal that's stated in the high school social sciences framework

05:35:39.200 --> 05:35:45.200
that requires representation of multiple points of view or perspectives.

05:35:45.200 --> 05:35:54.200
So we need to revisit that with something that's more positive and open to the variety of students and backgrounds that we have here in California.

05:35:54.200 --> 05:35:56.200
Thank you very much.

05:35:56.200 --> 05:35:57.200
Thank you, caller.

05:35:57.200 --> 05:36:01.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:36:01.200 --> 05:36:05.200
Your time starts now.

05:36:05.200 --> 05:36:07.200
Hi, my name is Lori Myers.

05:36:07.200 --> 05:36:13.200
I'm a California teacher who supports ethnic studies courses that address racism and teach our country's true history.

05:36:13.200 --> 05:36:19.200
According to the California Constitution, I cannot discriminate in my classroom based on my students' race,

05:36:19.200 --> 05:36:25.200
yet that is what the ethnic studies model curriculum tells me to do with its key pedagogy, critical race theory.

05:36:25.200 --> 05:36:31.200
Critical race theory is a pedagogy that divides students into groups based on race and then labels them because of their skin color.

05:36:31.200 --> 05:36:35.200
I know this because I've seen how it plays out in real classrooms.

05:36:35.200 --> 05:36:43.200
A perfect example are the racial privilege deconstructions that students as young as third grade are doing in school, like at Meyerholz and Cupertino.

05:36:43.200 --> 05:36:47.200
Another example is the model curriculum sample lesson 28.

05:36:47.200 --> 05:36:54.200
It differentiates based on race, telling teachers to ask white students, quote, what kind of white person they would have been,

05:36:54.200 --> 05:36:59.200
and ask non-white students a completely different question just because of skin color.

05:36:59.200 --> 05:37:06.200
Even if this lesson is removed, it was a CRT pedagogy that allowed it to be included by the IQC in the first place.

05:37:06.200 --> 05:37:10.200
Lawsuits have been filed across the country about critical race theory in schools.

05:37:10.200 --> 05:37:16.200
Please use Educators for Excellence in Ethnic Studies comments as a guide to removing literacy from the ESMC.

05:37:16.200 --> 05:37:19.200
Thank you for all you're doing for our students.

05:37:21.200 --> 05:37:26.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:37:29.200 --> 05:37:33.200
Hi, my name is Justin Feldman. I am a UCLA graduate.

05:37:33.200 --> 05:37:39.200
I wanted to for my support for the Jimena Ethnic Studies lesson plan,

05:37:39.200 --> 05:37:56.200
and I wanted to advocate that it be included inside of the Asian American Studies section because Jews of all backgrounds as an ethnic and religious identity are part of the Middle East, which is in the fabric of Asia.

05:37:56.200 --> 05:37:57.200
Thank you very much.

05:37:57.200 --> 05:37:58.200
Thank you.

05:37:58.200 --> 05:38:04.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:38:08.200 --> 05:38:21.200
My name is Hideko Mukai, and I am a student who is advocating for the many students that are relying on the California High School Proficiency Exam being administered this spring to all students in order to move forward with their academic plans.

05:38:21.200 --> 05:38:26.200
We ask that the California Department of Education makes administering the exam...

05:38:26.200 --> 05:38:35.200
Caller, I'm so sorry. That had to deal with the last item. We're only dealing with items that were not on the agenda.

05:38:35.200 --> 05:38:42.200
Once again, we have now 13 people in the queue.

05:38:42.200 --> 05:38:49.200
Please remember that this public comment are for items not on the agenda.

05:38:49.200 --> 05:38:54.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:38:57.200 --> 05:39:02.200
Good afternoon. My name is Barbara Shapira, a California parent.

05:39:02.200 --> 05:39:08.200
Please replace critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach to the ethnic studies model curriculum.

05:39:08.200 --> 05:39:18.200
I look to this board to lead so that an ethnic studies model curriculum promotes listening to each of our shared ethnic minority and immigrant group experiences.

05:39:18.200 --> 05:39:32.200
The current version still has an ideological agenda, which includes anti-capitalism, pro-militancy, and support for communist governments and opposes self-determination for Jews in Israel

05:39:32.200 --> 05:39:38.200
and berates nonviolent U.S. civil rights leaders as docile.

05:39:38.200 --> 05:39:44.200
Critical ethnic studies leads to brainstorming, close-mindedness, and bullying of those with different opinions.

05:39:44.200 --> 05:39:54.200
In contrast, a constructive ethnic studies leads to analysis of multiple perspectives, informed decision-making, and respectful dialogue.

05:39:55.200 --> 05:40:00.200
Please implement the changes recommended by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

05:40:00.200 --> 05:40:05.200
California students need this approach. Thank you so much for your consideration.

05:40:05.200 --> 05:40:14.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:40:14.200 --> 05:40:18.200
My name is Leah Rensen. I'm a California parent.

05:40:18.200 --> 05:40:25.200
I'm asking you to please replace the critical ethnic studies approach with a constructive ethnic studies approach in the ESMC.

05:40:25.200 --> 05:40:28.200
Critical ethnic studies promotes violent content.

05:40:28.200 --> 05:40:40.200
Lessons currently include Mumia Abu Jamal, who often used Mel's quote, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, and he was convicted of first-degree murder of a police officer.

05:40:40.200 --> 05:40:46.200
Yuri Kochiyama, who was a self-stated admirer of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and the Shining Path.

05:40:46.200 --> 05:40:56.200
Oscar Lopez Rivera, a militant leader of the FALN, which carried out more than 130 U.S. bombings and many other examples.

05:40:56.200 --> 05:41:09.200
The assignments require students to become these people, speaking in the voice of the individual to the whole class, forcing students to advocate to their peers the violent or offensive positions from the figures I just mentioned.

05:41:09.200 --> 05:41:12.200
This doesn't belong in K-12 classrooms.

05:41:12.200 --> 05:41:19.200
There are better nonviolent alternatives to model reform, such as Bryan Stevenson, Deanna Van Buren, and Norm Mineta.

05:41:19.200 --> 05:41:21.200
Please implement the changes.

05:41:21.200 --> 05:41:23.200
Thank you, caller.

05:41:23.200 --> 05:41:27.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:41:27.200 --> 05:41:32.200
Your time starts now.

05:41:32.200 --> 05:41:34.200
My name is Victoria Sanpere.

05:41:34.200 --> 05:41:40.200
Please replace the critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:41:40.200 --> 05:41:49.200
Despite the feedback provided to two previous drafts, I continue to see a curriculum that encourages people of color to see themselves as victims.

05:41:49.200 --> 05:41:51.200
This approach is shameful.

05:41:51.200 --> 05:41:57.200
It is hurtful to see the vibrant, positive Latino community characterized as victims.

05:41:57.200 --> 05:42:06.200
The curriculum perpetuates erroneous stereotypes rather than encouraging students to learn about one another as we truly are.

05:42:06.200 --> 05:42:17.200
Please modify the curriculum to stop teaching victimhood, divisiveness, oppression, violence, and the Marxist narrative that is found throughout the curriculum as presented.

05:42:17.200 --> 05:42:30.200
Empower students by replacing the critical ethnic studies curriculum with a constructive ethnic studies approach by making the revision submitted by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

05:42:30.200 --> 05:42:32.200
Our students deserve better.

05:42:32.200 --> 05:42:35.200
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment.

05:42:35.200 --> 05:42:36.200
Thank you, caller.

05:42:36.200 --> 05:42:40.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:42:40.200 --> 05:42:44.200
Your time starts now.

05:42:44.200 --> 05:42:48.200
My name is Noah Shukotinsky, and I'm a former student of California School System.

05:42:48.200 --> 05:42:52.200
Please replace the critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:42:52.200 --> 05:42:58.200
Growing up, I was raised on the stories of my gran and papa who fled racial violence in Jim Crow, Mississippi, to California.

05:42:58.200 --> 05:43:03.200
Despite pervasive racial discrimination, white supremacy, and terrorism, they achieved greatness.

05:43:03.200 --> 05:43:11.200
My papa was a self-employed businessman owning his own garage as a mechanic, and my gran was a self-employed businesswoman who owned her home-based business.

05:43:11.200 --> 05:43:14.200
Both were pillars of their community who sent all of their seven children to college.

05:43:14.200 --> 05:43:21.200
Knowing the roots that I come from is inspirational and gives me the resilience I need to overcome my own obstacles as a black Jewish man in the U.S.

05:43:21.200 --> 05:43:28.200
The framework currently present in the critical ethnic studies ESMC ignores and degrades this legacy of black independence and autonomy,

05:43:28.200 --> 05:43:33.200
which will re-traumatize an entire generation of young black minds by forcing victimhood upon us.

05:43:33.200 --> 05:43:40.200
Most disturbingly, this approach does everything ethnic studies is supposed to fight against by censoring the whites and their actions rather than focusing on the contributions of ethnic groups.

05:43:40.200 --> 05:43:46.200
Please implement the changes recommended by Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

05:44:08.200 --> 05:44:14.200
Hi, my name is Brandy Schupitinski. Please replace critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:44:14.200 --> 05:44:18.200
I'm a social worker who earned my MSW from the University of Southern California,

05:44:18.200 --> 05:44:23.200
working with victims and survivors of sexual abuse and family violence for most of my professional life.

05:44:23.200 --> 05:44:27.200
I've also had the opportunity to work with inner city high school students.

05:44:27.200 --> 05:44:32.200
As a black social worker, it means the world to me to have been able to work as a professional with students from my own community.

05:44:32.200 --> 05:44:39.200
The ESMC is attempting to erase all that my foremothers and forefathers fought for, ignoring their blood, sweat and tears.

05:44:39.200 --> 05:44:44.200
They did not fight for equity and justice so that their descendants would be categorized as helpless victims.

05:44:44.200 --> 05:44:48.200
That's what the ESMC does. That is what critical race theory does.

05:44:48.200 --> 05:44:52.200
And not only centers whiteness with all of the talk about white privilege and white supremacy,

05:44:52.200 --> 05:44:56.200
it uplifts it, displacing everyone and everything else.

05:44:56.200 --> 05:45:01.200
Ethnic studies is supposed to be about making space for communities whose knowledge has been erased, ignored and excluded,

05:45:01.200 --> 05:45:06.200
not some quack ideology that is based on social vengeance disguised as social justice.

05:45:06.200 --> 05:45:13.200
The erasure of black icons from the ESMC in order to force a political narrative masquerading its curriculum is insulting to the black community.

05:45:13.200 --> 05:45:18.200
Please implement the changes recommended by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

05:45:18.200 --> 05:45:26.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:45:26.200 --> 05:45:31.200
I'm Jeff Carnell. I'm a California parent and educator.

05:45:31.200 --> 05:45:37.200
I would like you to replace the critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:45:37.200 --> 05:45:43.200
The ESMC draft uses a critical ethnic studies approach, which imposes a narrow political ideology,

05:45:43.200 --> 05:45:52.200
promotes a militant anti-Western agenda, polarizes students, divides them into victims and oppressors, and assumes predetermined answers.

05:45:52.200 --> 05:45:57.200
In contrast, constructive ethnic studies focuses on civic responsibility,

05:45:57.200 --> 05:46:03.200
builds inter-ethnic group understanding, exposes students to multiple political perspectives,

05:46:03.200 --> 05:46:08.200
and encourages them to develop opinions based on inquiry. Both approaches address racism,

05:46:08.200 --> 05:46:17.200
but constructive ethnic studies leads to critical analysis of multiple perspectives, informed decision-making and respectful dialogue of opinions.

05:46:17.200 --> 05:46:25.200
Critical ethnic studies leads to doctrine regurgitation, close-mindedness and bullying of those with different opinions.

05:46:25.200 --> 05:46:33.200
Please implement the changes recommended by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. Replace critical ethnic studies approach.

05:46:33.200 --> 05:46:44.200
Thank you, caller. Your time is up. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:46:44.200 --> 05:46:50.200
Hi. My name is Bella Yadigar, and I'm a sophomore at Brentwood School in Los Angeles, California.

05:46:50.200 --> 05:46:57.200
I strongly support a curriculum that represents the experiences of the Black, Latinx, Asian, and Native American communities.

05:46:57.200 --> 05:47:05.200
I'm grateful for the work that has been done so far to revise this curriculum, but I'm here to share my concerns about some problems that still remain.

05:47:05.200 --> 05:47:14.200
I believe that we need to define anti-Semitism in the ESMC in a way that covers all forms of this hatred and reflects the real-life experiences of Jewish students and communities.

05:47:14.200 --> 05:47:22.200
As a first-generation American, my parents and grandparents faced persecution in Iran and were forced to flee from their country due to their religious beliefs.

05:47:22.200 --> 05:47:28.200
They experienced anti-Semitism in the classroom and daily life and were forced to live through these horrific experiences.

05:47:28.200 --> 05:47:33.200
This could have been prevented if the other students had a proper education on anti-Semitism.

05:47:33.200 --> 05:47:43.200
This is why we need to add the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism, which helps to educate about modern-day anti-Semitism and put an end to bias starting at a young age.

05:47:43.200 --> 05:47:54.200
Also, as a Middle Eastern Jew, I worry about the discrimination we will continue to face here in California if the curriculum does not include my community in more depth due to the lack of education about our grand struggles.

05:47:54.200 --> 05:47:56.200
Thank you, caller. Thank you.

05:47:56.200 --> 05:47:57.200
Thank you.

05:47:57.200 --> 05:48:04.200
Also, I have just received notification that we are entertaining comments about the Chesapeake's exam.

05:48:04.200 --> 05:48:13.200
If you have a public comment regarding that particular exam, please feel free to call back on our call line.

05:48:13.200 --> 05:48:22.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:48:22.200 --> 05:48:25.200
Good afternoon. My name is Sherry Lewis.

05:48:25.200 --> 05:48:31.200
I've been an educator for many decades, most recently with the Los Angeles Unified School District, LAUSD.

05:48:31.200 --> 05:48:38.200
As an educator, I am very concerned about the use of critical race theory in the ethnic studies model curriculum.

05:48:38.200 --> 05:48:46.200
Critical race theory divides students into groups, often based on such superficial characteristics as skin color.

05:48:46.200 --> 05:48:54.200
As a teacher in LAUSD, I've encountered many different groups of students, including immigrant students from Mongolia, Egypt, Venezuela, and Israel.

05:48:54.200 --> 05:48:59.200
So I know the importance of encouraging and promoting multiple perspectives.

05:48:59.200 --> 05:49:05.200
Critical race theory is extremely flawed because it is one sided and does not provide a balanced approach.

05:49:05.200 --> 05:49:10.200
Furthermore, this theory is simplistic and seems to resemble propaganda more than education.

05:49:11.200 --> 05:49:20.200
If this theory is used in the model curriculum, it should be only one of multiple perspectives on ethnic studies, not the only perspective.

05:49:20.200 --> 05:49:23.200
Thank you for listening. Thank you, caller.

05:49:23.200 --> 05:49:30.200
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:49:30.200 --> 05:49:36.200
I'm Joanne Donsky, a California educator and parent.

05:49:36.200 --> 05:49:42.200
Please replace critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:49:42.200 --> 05:49:50.200
Studies show that student benefits occur from ethnic studies courses without a critical ethnic studies approach.

05:49:50.200 --> 05:49:57.200
The ESMC cites Christine Sleater's report, The Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies.

05:49:57.200 --> 05:50:03.200
Many of the case studies were about reading literature featuring people of color and written by nonwhite authors.

05:50:03.200 --> 05:50:10.200
These studies had nothing to do with colonialism, critical race theory, or critical political ideology.

05:50:10.200 --> 05:50:25.200
It is not necessary to impose narrow critical ethnic studies dogma or sacrifice inquiry to achieve the engagement benefit that we all desire for California's BIPOC students.

05:50:25.200 --> 05:50:31.200
Please make the changes recommended by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. Thank you.

05:50:31.200 --> 05:50:40.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:50:40.200 --> 05:50:50.200
Hello, my name is Claire Chedicle and I'm an occupational therapist who has worked in psychiatry and education as well for over 10 years with a K through 12 group,

05:50:50.200 --> 05:50:55.200
mainstream students with special needs, learning differences and physical disabilities.

05:50:55.200 --> 05:51:00.200
Many abused, neglected, adopted for whom race and ethnicity may be unknown.

05:51:00.200 --> 05:51:05.200
I'm concerned about the CRT component of the ESMC impact on the population.

05:51:05.200 --> 05:51:18.200
The idea that these students of all hues, whom experience oppression as disabled people, will be vulnerable and be put in a place to self-disclose about their privilege based on their skin color alone.

05:51:18.200 --> 05:51:25.200
The ESMC tells teachers to be attentive to trauma-informed educational practices and to have school counselors available.

05:51:25.200 --> 05:51:32.200
To potentially induce trauma via a curriculum would appear a risky endeavor and not appropriate for pedagogically sound.

05:51:32.200 --> 05:51:39.200
As educators and specialists, we are appalled to not call time to our students and have legal and Ed code obligations to protect them.

05:51:39.200 --> 05:51:47.200
Please use Educators for Excellence in Ethnic Studies submission to the SBE as a guide for removing CRT elements. Thank you, caller.

05:51:48.200 --> 05:51:57.200
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:51:57.200 --> 05:52:04.200
Hi, I'm Barb Windham, a California parent. Please replace critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in ESMC.

05:52:04.200 --> 05:52:12.200
We all want ethnic studies to combat racism by helping students understand others and be empowered by studying leaders that look like they do.

05:52:12.200 --> 05:52:19.200
But the critical ethnic studies approach in ESMC doesn't lead there. Instead, it imposes a narrow political agenda on students.

05:52:19.200 --> 05:52:26.200
It focuses on critiquing empire building and imperialism rather than on understanding an ethnic group's obstacles and contributions.

05:52:26.200 --> 05:52:34.200
It uses narrow ideological filters to choose examples and role models. It assumes answers rather than inviting analysis.

05:52:34.200 --> 05:52:42.200
The only exploration allowed is within the framework of critical ethnic studies ideology, never questioning its dogmatic underpinnings.

05:52:42.200 --> 05:52:47.200
If we want to promote inquiry in the classroom, we can't force feed predetermined answers.

05:52:47.200 --> 05:52:54.200
Please implement the changes recommended by Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies to replace the critical ethnic studies approach,

05:52:54.200 --> 05:53:01.200
remove ideological indoctrination, and revise the lessons to promote inquiry, not flog on conclusions. Thank you so much.

05:53:02.200 --> 05:53:08.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:53:10.200 --> 05:53:18.200
Hi, my name is Aryaki Singh and I'm a sophomore in high school. I have made plans among many of my fellow student body to take the Chespi this year.

05:53:18.200 --> 05:53:30.200
Unfortunately, because of COVID, everything is getting held back. But I come to you asking if it would be possible to hold the Chespi before summer or sooner and have a set date soon so we may know what we should plan for.

05:53:30.200 --> 05:53:40.200
Our futures and higher education plans are at risk. Many tests such as AP exams, GED exams, and other high school equivalency tests are taking place.

05:53:40.200 --> 05:53:54.200
The Chespi is the last option for some of my peers. It would be greatly appreciated if we had testing dates and more specific and promising times for the Chespi 2021 and even more helpful if the Chespi were to take place before or in the summer.

05:53:56.200 --> 05:53:58.200
Thank you for your time.

05:53:58.200 --> 05:54:07.200
Thank you and thank you for calling back. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:54:11.200 --> 05:54:22.200
Hi, my name is Jill Silverman. As a San Francisco parent of two, I'm asking you to replace the critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ethnic studies model curriculum.

05:54:22.200 --> 05:54:34.200
This is because the critical ethnic studies approach of the current draft undermines the potential for a robust curriculum which would empower students of color while building empathy and understanding among all students.

05:54:34.200 --> 05:54:49.200
Instead, the current draft defines and divides students by race, creating a hierarchy of victimhood. White students are made to feel guilty and students of color are encouraged to focus on their victimhood, thus creating a hostile and disempowering educational environment.

05:54:49.200 --> 05:55:03.200
A constructive approach would build understanding and uplift all students. To get it right and have its full impact, please adopt the revisions recommended by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. Thank you for your work and consideration.

05:55:03.200 --> 05:55:10.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:55:10.200 --> 05:55:20.200
I'm Maddie Carmel, a California parent, grandparent, and educator. She's replaced critical ethnic studies with a constructive approach in the ESMC.

05:55:20.200 --> 05:55:27.200
Three out of six guiding principles urge students to critique empire building and colonialist beliefs.

05:55:27.200 --> 05:55:36.200
These principles shift the focus from ethnic studies to foreign policy and from countering racism in all its causes to a focus on colonialism.

05:55:36.200 --> 05:55:49.200
Surprisingly, despite AB 2016's stated goal, there is no guiding principle to inspire student appreciation for the contributions of ethnic groups or any guiding value about empathy.

05:55:49.200 --> 05:56:01.200
Revise the guiding principles to remove the critical ethnic studies dogma and add focus on the history, struggles, and accomplishments of ethnic groups with an emphasis on empathy rather than victimhood.

05:56:01.200 --> 05:56:11.200
Please implement the changes recommended by Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. Thank you for your consideration and all your work you're doing on this.

05:56:11.200 --> 05:56:21.200
Thank you, caller. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

05:56:21.200 --> 05:56:34.200
My name is Hireka Mukai and I'm a student who is advocating for the many students that are relying on the California High School Proficiency Exam being administered this spring to all students in order to move forward with their academic plans.

05:56:34.200 --> 05:56:42.200
We ask that the California Department of Education makes administering the exam in the spring and communicating with the Chesapeake office a priority.

05:56:42.200 --> 05:56:52.200
Many students I've been in contact with and myself rely on the exam being administered this spring in order to go to community college this year. Delaying the exam would cause many problems for so many students.

05:56:52.200 --> 05:56:58.200
The Chesapeake office has yet to give any clear, direct information on when the next test will be administered.

05:56:58.200 --> 05:57:03.200
However, they have said to some students that they will only allow new testers to take it during the late summer.

05:57:03.200 --> 05:57:06.200
This could jeopardize many students' academic career plans.

05:57:07.200 --> 05:57:14.200
We are urging you to prioritize administering a spring exam for all students. Thank you.

05:57:14.200 --> 05:57:21.200
Thank you. And thank you, caller, for calling back on the topic. This concludes public comment for item three.

05:57:21.200 --> 05:57:31.200
Great. Thank you very much to all of the callers and commenters and to the board for all of the good work today.

05:57:31.200 --> 05:57:38.200
And I hereby adjourn our February 2021 State Board of Education meeting at 2 50 p.m.

05:57:38.200 --> 05:57:44.200
Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you all at our March 2021 meeting or before.

05:57:46.200 --> 05:57:50.200
See you soon. Bye, everyone. Thanks.
