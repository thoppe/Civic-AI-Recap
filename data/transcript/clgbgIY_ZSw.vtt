WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.273
This meeting is being recorded.

00:03.293 --> 00:06.516
OK, then.

00:08.757 --> 00:09.738
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:10.238 --> 00:13.020
Welcome to this meeting of the Preservation Board.

00:13.581 --> 00:17.063
I'm going to call a roll and determine who is here.

00:19.605 --> 00:20.406
I am present.

00:20.646 --> 00:21.947
Commissioner Robinson, are you here?

00:21.967 --> 00:22.027
Yes.

00:25.049 --> 00:26.370
Commissioner Hamilton, are you here?

00:26.410 --> 00:27.711
Commissioner Killeen, are you here?

00:27.731 --> 00:28.492
Present.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.056
Richardson, Commissioner Allen, are you here?

00:33.437 --> 00:33.797
Present.

00:35.037 --> 00:36.317
Commissioner Hamacher, are you here?

00:37.537 --> 00:37.777
Yes.

00:39.078 --> 00:40.158
Alderman Coder, are you here?

00:40.978 --> 00:41.678
Yes, sir, here.

00:42.818 --> 00:43.279
Okay.

00:45.499 --> 00:48.700
Let's make Commissioner Richardson and Commissioner Hamilton disappear.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.460
Commissioners.

00:56.713 --> 01:02.735
Have you had a chance to read the minutes from the January 23rd meeting, anyone?

01:03.795 --> 01:05.956
And if so, is there a motion to approve them?

01:07.377 --> 01:11.198
I move to approve the minutes from the January, what's the date?

01:11.398 --> 01:11.538
23rd.

01:11.958 --> 01:14.819
January 23rd, 2023 preservation board meeting.

01:15.399 --> 01:15.880
Thank you, sir.

01:15.900 --> 01:16.500
Is there a second?

01:19.141 --> 01:19.641
I second.

01:20.801 --> 01:21.922
Motion is accepted.

01:22.402 --> 01:23.162
Any discussion?

01:23.342 --> 01:23.902
Hearing none.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.903
All those in favor of adopting the minutes

01:28.123 --> 01:32.684
of approving minutes for January 23rd, 2023, signify by saying aye.

01:33.564 --> 01:33.984
Aye.

01:34.564 --> 01:34.684
Aye.

01:35.965 --> 01:36.425
Opposed?

01:38.085 --> 01:38.565
Abstain?

01:39.085 --> 01:41.726
Okay, those will be approved minutes.

01:42.046 --> 01:49.428
Commissioners, take a look down through today's agenda and tell me if there is any item here from which you need to recuse yourself.

01:51.128 --> 01:52.848
Item B from Mike Tulane, please.

01:53.648 --> 01:54.209
Okay.

01:55.389 --> 01:55.869
Anybody else?

01:58.766 --> 01:59.246
Good enough.

01:59.446 --> 02:01.046
Okay, looking down through the order here.

02:01.066 --> 02:02.547
Is this order satisfactory to everybody?

02:06.007 --> 02:08.708
Okay, then this will be the order.

02:09.748 --> 02:11.409
I'm going to call the roll.

02:11.429 --> 02:17.490
And voting today will be Robinson, Killeen, Allen, Hamilcar, Coder.

02:20.150 --> 02:21.351
Chair will vote last.

02:22.031 --> 02:24.771
We'll generally vote only to break a tie.

02:26.952 --> 02:28.432
Meg, have you got some announcements to make?

02:29.465 --> 02:32.166
Yes, I just want to remind everybody that the meeting is being recorded.

02:33.087 --> 02:38.889
Also, if you would like to speak on an agenda item, please put your full name and the address of the agenda item in the chat.

02:38.969 --> 02:41.810
Those chats will only come to the host and co-host, not to everyone.

02:41.830 --> 02:48.473
We will then call on you, and we will give the chair your name at the appointed time, and you will be called on at that time.

02:49.233 --> 02:53.415
We ask that everyone in the room stay muted unless you're speaking.

02:54.713 --> 02:57.755
And also that you use your first and your last name.

02:57.815 --> 03:00.836
I noticed there are a few people with only their first names here in the room.

03:00.916 --> 03:03.657
Please go in and add your last name so that we know who is here.

03:03.677 --> 03:06.999
Thank you.

03:07.039 --> 03:11.741
Barb Burkett, have you any advice or instructions to give to commissioners?

03:13.302 --> 03:14.782
Only advice I've heard before.

03:14.822 --> 03:18.804
When it's time for you to vote, please make sure you turn your cameras on.

03:19.424 --> 03:22.466
And if you have any technical difficulty, please make

03:23.567 --> 03:27.950
the Cultural Resources Director aware of it, and that will do.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.671
Excellent.

03:29.771 --> 03:30.672
Thank you both very much.

03:31.977 --> 03:54.162
Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna hear appeals of the director's denials first, and I would like to remind both staff and those who wish to testify, including the appellants, that I'm going to ask you to state your name, your zip code, and I will ask you to affirm that you are telling the truth, or tell me that you're not gonna be telling the truth.

03:55.662 --> 03:56.702
We're building a record.

03:56.722 --> 04:00.003
This is like administrative law.

04:01.095 --> 04:05.996
We begin agenda item A3326 South 18th Street.

04:07.717 --> 04:08.197
Okay.

04:08.657 --> 04:16.659
I want to say that I'm reading from a tablet here because once again, the director did not give me a printed version of this agenda.

04:19.239 --> 04:22.300
We will try and rectify that in the future, Mr. Calo.

04:22.540 --> 04:24.981
If Mr. Calo asks for such a thing, then he will get it.

04:25.501 --> 04:27.881
Bob, you are now the new director.

04:28.521 --> 04:29.802
Hey.

04:29.842 --> 04:30.702
It's a whole new world, guys.

04:31.283 --> 04:35.885
Okay, so start out Bob Bettis with staff will tell the truth.

04:36.186 --> 04:37.646
I live in St.

04:37.666 --> 04:38.127
Louis at 63139.

04:38.447 --> 04:41.809
So there's my zip code for you.

04:41.849 --> 04:53.375
I need to enter in the enabling ordinance 64689 as amended by 69423, the Benton Park ordinance 67175, my presentation, step report and a PowerPoint.

04:54.575 --> 04:54.775
Good.

04:55.476 --> 04:55.756
Okay.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.437
Can you guys see the PowerPoint?

04:58.137 --> 04:58.497
Not yet.

04:58.517 --> 04:58.597
Okay.

05:07.850 --> 05:08.771
One second, I apologize.

05:15.414 --> 05:16.095
Now we can.

05:16.515 --> 05:17.595
Yay, okay, great.

05:17.936 --> 05:21.798
Okay, this item was heard briefly last month.

05:22.218 --> 05:30.983
The applicant, staff, and the neighborhood had asked for a deferment so the applicant could meet with the Benton Park Neighborhood Group to discuss this project.

05:31.903 --> 05:34.865
From what I gather, that did not occur, though, unfortunately.

05:35.512 --> 05:38.013
I'm just going to go through the report real quick.

05:38.533 --> 05:40.594
And then Benton Park is present.

05:40.634 --> 05:43.595
They have also sent you a letter so you know their stance on the project.

05:45.835 --> 05:46.036
OK.

05:46.196 --> 05:51.197
This is an appeal at 3326 South 18th Street in the Benton Park Local Historic District.

05:52.138 --> 05:53.578
This is the property in question.

05:53.998 --> 05:59.920
And while we're looking at it, the retaining walls you see in front of you are also the items in question.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.221
It's this two-tiered wall system.

06:02.581 --> 06:05.162
So all four of those little walls are what's part of the appeal.

06:06.673 --> 06:07.914
Some quick context for you.

06:07.994 --> 06:12.575
It's kind of on the Eastern edge of Benton park, just North of Cherokee street.

06:16.077 --> 06:17.317
Here's some street level context.

06:17.617 --> 06:27.601
It's a good time to point out that the entire length of South 18th street on that East side, um, has, uh, uh, Versa lock retaining walls already in place.

06:27.761 --> 06:32.283
Those were all put in place prior to Benton park becoming a local historic district.

06:32.873 --> 06:36.435
So they were not reviewed, obviously because they predate the code.

06:36.576 --> 06:40.578
So they are a non-compliant feature, but they predate the code.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.981
Here's another shot of the subject property.

06:45.001 --> 06:47.363
I'd like to note something on this picture as well.

06:47.563 --> 06:51.566
You'll see a brick wall just kind of behind this chain link fence.

06:52.106 --> 06:57.490
That brick wall went through our office for approval back in 2013.

06:58.671 --> 07:01.913
So the previous owner went through the board, I'm sorry, went through staff

07:02.557 --> 07:05.019
to get that wall, which is compliant, approved.

07:05.079 --> 07:08.543
It was built, I believe, just all brick with a cast cap.

07:08.583 --> 07:10.805
So that's a compliant wall that was built previously.

07:10.825 --> 07:14.008
And here's a shot of that wall.

07:14.268 --> 07:19.873
And again, you can also see the unfinished first lock wall to the left that's in question today.

07:21.795 --> 07:24.698
On the left is the previous appearance.

07:25.359 --> 07:27.761
It's a very steep slope, but there's no way of getting around that.

07:28.620 --> 07:36.205
So obviously there was some need to fix that slope, but what was constructed was done without permits and does not meet code.

07:37.966 --> 07:41.188
So what Benton Park Code says, we've all been through retaining walls before.

07:41.208 --> 07:49.572
If you're going to do a retaining wall, it needs to be based on a model example, have a natural stone coarsed veneer that is based on the example, or a brick veneer.

07:50.173 --> 07:52.774
Obviously what you see before you is none of that.

07:52.834 --> 07:54.275
It's a versalock retaining wall.

07:54.715 --> 07:56.336
So what happened,

07:58.581 --> 08:11.973
Current owner is flipping the property, and he came through before with some other work on the rear of the property, including also some flat work, and also just the steps at the top that were entering the building.

08:12.474 --> 08:16.237
So everything else, the retaining walls were not part of that original permit.

08:17.578 --> 08:21.402
He can explain to you as to why he constructed those, but again, that's what's in question.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.684
So I'm not missing anything else.

08:26.693 --> 08:32.478
Uh, again, you, you were sent a letter, um, the Bend park, uh, neighborhood group did not hear from the applicants since the last meeting.

08:32.899 --> 08:38.624
So they are at this point in time stating that they are going to support the director's denial of the application.

08:39.165 --> 08:44.169
Um, if the application, um, I believe they're going to meet again sometime in early March.

08:44.530 --> 08:47.833
So if the applicant can get before them again, he's going to ask for a deferral.

08:47.853 --> 08:49.314
I believe today the applicant is.

08:50.319 --> 08:57.724
But anyway, staff recommends that the board uphold the director's denial as the install wall does not meet the Benton Park local historic standards for canning walls.

08:58.084 --> 08:58.605
Any questions?

08:59.185 --> 09:00.626
Commissioners, questions for Bob?

09:02.728 --> 09:03.548
Just one question.

09:03.868 --> 09:08.792
Bob, would that brick wall be eligible to be considered a model example?

09:10.073 --> 09:10.553
No, sir.

09:10.673 --> 09:12.714
It has to be an actual period wall.

09:12.874 --> 09:13.995
So it needs to be based on something.

09:14.015 --> 09:17.217
But there are canning walls within the district that has that.

09:18.562 --> 09:24.327
It's definitely a good idea that that would be something they could do to put a veneer on that wall because there's plenty in the neighborhood that would meet that criteria.

09:25.048 --> 09:25.348
Thank you.

09:25.948 --> 09:26.248
Thank you.

09:26.829 --> 09:28.731
Do you mean put a veneer over the front of the wall?

09:29.291 --> 09:30.472
Bill, wait a second, please.

09:31.373 --> 09:31.573
Okay.

09:33.054 --> 09:34.555
Commissioners, further questions for Bob?

09:34.575 --> 09:40.520
Okay, Bob, out of curiosity, is there anybody here to speak besides the appellant?

09:42.041 --> 09:43.723
Again, Tim Mulligan, I believe, is here.

09:43.743 --> 09:44.784
Anybody else signed up to speak yet?

09:46.926 --> 09:50.109
OK, let me look and check on my chat one sec as we're getting conflicting chats.

09:50.129 --> 09:51.450
So please bear with me one sec.

09:52.410 --> 10:14.328
I think it looks nice.

10:15.017 --> 10:16.697
Bill, OK, please mute, Bill, please.

10:17.538 --> 10:24.299
OK, so Tim Mulligan is here to speak on the item for South 18th Street.

10:24.339 --> 10:32.241
I want to reiterate to everybody who's in the room, if you want to speak, would you please actually send your request to the send request here?

10:32.261 --> 10:34.681
Send and speak here, please.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.982
There's one of the windows you'll see on there.

10:40.662 --> 10:41.022
One sec.

10:41.483 --> 10:43.523
It says sign up to speak here, please send

10:44.195 --> 10:46.957
your chat to that window, that'd be great.

10:49.418 --> 10:52.040
Okay, yeah, so we have Mr. Mulligan is here to speak, sir.

10:57.363 --> 10:59.784
That's good to know in case we are asked to defer this.

11:00.024 --> 11:03.466
I don't want to drag citizens to a meeting and then defer the item.

11:04.287 --> 11:05.407
Okay, is the appellant present?

11:06.348 --> 11:07.749
Yes, Mr. McCracken is here.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.229
Bill McCracken.

11:10.110 --> 11:10.390
Yes.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.492
Mr. McCracken, could you put your full name

11:15.650 --> 11:16.850
My name's William McCracken.

11:17.170 --> 11:18.331
I can't get back to the screen.

11:18.391 --> 11:19.771
I'm having a little difficulty working.

11:19.831 --> 11:23.671
It's the first Zoom meeting I've ever been to, and I'm a little confused.

11:23.691 --> 11:24.852
Do you see where your mouse is?

11:27.732 --> 11:28.432
I'm on a phone.

11:29.593 --> 11:30.653
As I say, I'm on a phone.

11:31.393 --> 11:31.993
There you go.

11:32.113 --> 11:32.473
Perfect.

11:33.393 --> 11:33.713
Good work.

11:33.733 --> 11:36.714
I don't know what to do.

11:36.934 --> 11:37.434
There you go.

11:38.594 --> 11:41.235
Mr. McCracken, is your testimony going to be the truth?

11:42.575 --> 11:42.835
Oh, yeah.

11:43.395 --> 11:43.555
Yes.

11:45.812 --> 11:46.012
Good.

11:46.152 --> 11:46.893
What do you want us to do?

11:46.913 --> 11:54.077
I would like you to defer this so I can meet with the people from the Bend Park Neighborhood Committee.

11:54.117 --> 11:57.659
I missed it last week or two weeks ago because I was sick.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.225
I'd like to meet with them and see what they think because that should be my proper steps in getting this done.

12:09.085 --> 12:12.007
I was hoping I could do that before you-all made a decision on it.

12:13.544 --> 12:17.586
Tim Mulligan, it looks like you're the only person here to speak on this issue.

12:17.826 --> 12:19.067
How do you feel about a deferment?

12:21.008 --> 12:28.771
That would be a great opportunity to hear from the owner and see what we can come up with.

12:30.672 --> 12:30.992
OK.

12:31.192 --> 12:33.514
Commissioners, how do you all feel about it?

12:35.094 --> 12:35.735
OK to defer?

12:38.616 --> 12:39.056
That's fine.

12:40.357 --> 12:40.457
OK.

12:43.072 --> 12:48.853
Commissioners, there's a motion on the floor to defer this matter.

12:49.414 --> 12:51.754
And I assume that one of the this fines is a second.

12:52.274 --> 12:55.015
All those in favor of deferring this signify by saying aye.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.175
Aye.

12:56.975 --> 12:57.415
Opposed?

12:58.036 --> 12:58.156
Aye.

12:59.116 --> 12:59.276
Aye.

13:00.076 --> 13:00.396
OK.

13:01.096 --> 13:02.357
Many, many ayes.

13:02.737 --> 13:03.797
The motion carries.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.077
And we will defer this.

13:05.497 --> 13:07.498
And we'll report on a future agenda.

13:08.398 --> 13:08.718
OK.

13:08.798 --> 13:09.298
Well, thank you.

13:09.338 --> 13:10.639
And I'll make sure to hit the next meeting.

13:12.039 --> 13:12.319
Thank you.

13:19.112 --> 13:20.373
There we go.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.254
Okay.

13:22.575 --> 13:23.076
Commissioners.

13:24.837 --> 13:26.219
Very exciting start to the meeting.

13:26.579 --> 13:30.302
Let's call agenda item B to North Taylor Avenue.

13:32.564 --> 13:32.925
Okay.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.626
Again, Bob bet us with staff.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.367
I'll tell the truth.

13:35.427 --> 13:36.207
I still live at 63139.

13:36.388 --> 13:36.788
Mr. Callow.

13:36.848 --> 13:41.092
I'm going to enter in a new ordinance 64689 as amended by 69423.

13:45.120 --> 13:53.064
Central West End Ordinance, which is 5678 as amended by 69423, my presentation, PowerPoint, and staff report.

13:53.084 --> 14:00.807
Okay, so we have, this is the property in question, it's at 462 North Taylor and Central West End.

14:01.887 --> 14:12.332
The proposal that came in to install two fabric awnings, one on the alley side, on the south side, and one on the east side, which faces onto the parking lot.

14:12.876 --> 14:14.098
This is the property in question.

14:14.538 --> 14:17.842
This is the North Taylor side facing east.

14:18.663 --> 14:19.584
It's kind of an odd building.

14:19.604 --> 14:21.666
It's set back far off of Olive.

14:21.926 --> 14:24.189
So you see it's back here, set far back.

14:24.589 --> 14:29.655
There is a brick wall that fronts along Olive that kind of screens the view from the street.

14:33.973 --> 14:43.939
This is a, I'm looking kind of northeast and a bird's-eye view, northwest bird's-eye view, and the two green dots on my little map here show the proposed locations of the awnings.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.781
Here's some street-level context.

14:48.681 --> 14:55.305
On the photograph on the top here, the awnings are going to go in this general area here, and then we're looking south.

14:56.165 --> 14:57.706
On Taylor, building questions to the left.

15:00.448 --> 15:01.268
This is on Olive.

15:01.932 --> 15:07.075
At right, you can see the wall, the building is set far off the street, looking west on Olive.

15:08.176 --> 15:15.380
Okay, so what the Central West End Code says for awnings is that awnings must fit within the masonry opening which they intend to cover.

15:15.460 --> 15:22.084
So staff takes that literally in that it needs to fit within the masonry opening of a window or a door or a storefront.

15:23.125 --> 15:28.068
The proposed awnings in this case are just two different kinds of awning setups.

15:28.821 --> 15:31.622
They're both trying to keep water out of two basement entrances.

15:32.483 --> 15:33.163
You can see that here.

15:34.083 --> 15:44.147
My sad little mock-up I did for you shows the awning on the south side actually covers two windows, but it projects over that well that goes down to the basement.

15:46.288 --> 15:55.492
And then on the east facade, the awning actually sits below the sills of the window, but still covers that longer stretch of stairwell that goes down.

15:57.185 --> 16:01.787
Neither awning meet the code because they don't fit that definition within the Mesa opening.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.128
So again, these are a few more shots.

16:05.148 --> 16:07.069
This is the alley view looking back at the property.

16:07.229 --> 16:10.390
And then it's kind of important to show the one on Olive Street.

16:10.830 --> 16:15.632
You would barely see the one from Olive based on the large wall that faces the street.

16:17.953 --> 16:22.655
This was the submittal from the applicant showing the swatch of green fabric.

16:23.995 --> 16:24.596
And we're back here.

16:24.976 --> 16:25.296
So again,

16:26.543 --> 16:31.107
What the code says is it's within the opening, so staff denied the application.

16:31.147 --> 16:39.395
We did speak with the applicant early on, as well as the awning company, and they felt that this was their best solution to keep the water out.

16:39.455 --> 16:44.299
So there really wasn't any other items or ways to do this explore.

16:44.339 --> 16:49.624
They thought this was the best way to proceed, and they know the process they've been through before, so they chose to appeal our denial.

16:50.598 --> 16:56.281
So given that, staff recommends that the board upholds director's denial of the installation of the two awnings.

16:57.282 --> 17:01.064
You should have gotten a letter today from Central West End, from us.

17:01.724 --> 17:06.367
I do believe that they conditionally support the applicant's request.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.468
They wish for a color change.

17:08.868 --> 17:11.670
Mr. Dwyer is here to speak on the item from the neighborhood.

17:11.870 --> 17:12.510
So any questions?

17:13.751 --> 17:15.912
Any questions for Bob, commissioners?

17:19.551 --> 17:22.632
Bob, to your knowledge, were there ever awnings over those openings?

17:23.673 --> 17:26.174
I would guess no, but I don't want to say that specifically.

17:26.194 --> 17:26.974
I would just guess no.

17:27.134 --> 17:28.414
I have no definitive answer for that.

17:29.275 --> 17:33.656
Did you look down in that stairwell hole and see if there's a drain down there?

17:34.677 --> 17:36.297
Well, I did not.

17:36.317 --> 17:37.798
Okay.

17:38.138 --> 17:38.478
Did not.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.881
It seems to be a problem that's been about 85 years in the making.

17:46.061 --> 17:46.401
True.

17:47.061 --> 17:47.582
That's true.

17:49.102 --> 17:50.943
And Mr. Wolfgram is also the applicant.

17:50.983 --> 17:53.944
Maybe he can shed some light on the actual specifics on their problems.

17:54.444 --> 17:55.264
OK, that's cool.

17:56.425 --> 18:00.326
Do we have people signed up to speak for this one besides the appellant?

18:00.366 --> 18:01.587
Jim Dwyer is here also.

18:02.467 --> 18:02.747
Perfect.

18:02.787 --> 18:04.068
We're just double checking.

18:04.088 --> 18:05.208
We're double checking here real quick.

18:07.509 --> 18:08.630
No, just Mr. Dwyer.

18:09.450 --> 18:09.670
Great.

18:10.270 --> 18:11.771
OK, let's hear from the appellant, please.

18:14.612 --> 18:15.292
Good afternoon.

18:15.392 --> 18:16.593
Thank you for having me.

18:16.613 --> 18:17.373
Can you hear me OK?

18:18.174 --> 18:27.941
Yes, we can tell us your zip code 63108 and Mr welcome is your testimony going to be the truth, yes, sir okay proceed.

18:28.781 --> 18:38.308
Great um we've had some intrusion of water through the years, but the last August rain the Tuesday Thursday rain that.

18:39.629 --> 18:47.434
affected many of us in this area was by far the worst that we've experienced, and so we have a kind of multi phased approach to trying to.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.227
remediate the water.

18:49.447 --> 18:58.534
And I truly believe that this is the new normal in buildings have to harden their assets against global warming.

18:58.894 --> 19:01.476
And so that's the purpose for this.

19:02.177 --> 19:05.800
And there are drains at the bottom of each stairwell.

19:06.260 --> 19:13.566
We've also consulted outside contractors to see if they could install a sump pump or something that would also

19:14.701 --> 19:33.192
help us alleviate when there's so much water rainfall coming down that we get intrusion of water and in the alley stairwell, there's not room for some pump in the, in the parking lot side they thought maybe they could but

19:34.144 --> 19:37.087
Just to answer the previous question, there are drains listed in each.

19:37.627 --> 19:44.954
And I know Jim Dwyer on behalf of his committee have recommended a color change, and that's certainly no problem whatsoever.

19:46.936 --> 19:57.165
So, I mean, there are other things that we're doing as well, but we feel that this is the best solution to ameliorate the flooding problems that we've had in the past.

19:58.767 --> 19:59.988
And I will mention,

20:00.899 --> 20:09.905
Before this August rain, we had those drains snaked in July, and we have them on a routine maintenance to keep them open.

20:09.986 --> 20:13.668
So they were fully open during that intrusion.

20:15.189 --> 20:18.452
You know, Klan Dwyer has its own tartan.

20:18.672 --> 20:22.555
And I suspect that Mr. Dwyer is going to be asking you to change to those colors.

20:23.215 --> 20:25.397
But we'll see when he speaks.

20:27.858 --> 20:28.959
Commissioner's question.

20:29.079 --> 20:40.648
I think just to repeat what's already been said, that they're not visible from either the olive side and the other ones in the alley.

20:40.668 --> 20:47.293
I think you'll be able to see them, but they're not on the two main exposures of the building.

20:48.854 --> 20:55.559
You probably had me at global warming, but I'm going to agree with Mr. Dwyer on the Kelly Green here.

20:57.128 --> 20:58.668
Commissioner's questions for the appellant.

21:02.489 --> 21:04.350
Okay, thank you very much, sir, Mr dryer.

21:05.490 --> 21:06.511
Yes, Mr Chairman.

21:08.671 --> 21:14.353
I am James Dwyer I reside in 63108 and I affirm that I will tell the truth.

21:14.953 --> 21:15.233
Thank you.

21:17.254 --> 21:44.835
The CWE Planning and Development Committee has reviewed the proposal to install two canvas awnings at the reference address and recognizes that the proposed installation is non-compliant with the relevant provisions of the CWE Historic District Standards requiring that, quote, all awnings shall fit within the openings to which they are affixed, and that, therefore, the Cultural Resources Office must deny the application.

21:46.468 --> 22:11.532
Following due consideration, the committee has determined that given the intended purpose of the awnings, that is to address the prospect of stormwater overwhelming exterior area drains and flooding the basement, as well as the proposed locations of the awnings on secondary elevations, alley and parking lot, an exception to the rule is warranted in this instance.

22:12.677 --> 22:27.223
However, the committee recommends that the proposed color of the awnings, green, be reconsidered and that a neutral shade of beige or gray be specified to blend into the color of the building and minimize the visual impact of the canvas.

22:28.243 --> 22:32.324
Subject to that condition, the committee recommends favorable action on the appeal.

22:33.145 --> 22:33.525
Thank you.

22:34.345 --> 22:35.005
Thank you, sir.

22:36.986 --> 22:37.807
Anybody else, Bob?

22:38.507 --> 22:38.867
No, sir.

22:40.771 --> 22:43.452
Okay, Commissioners, that concludes testimony on this appeal.

22:44.993 --> 22:46.553
Do I hear a motion?

22:46.833 --> 23:00.439
Commissioner Robinson.

23:00.459 --> 23:09.282
I move that we overturn the Director's denial

23:12.228 --> 23:32.269
and to prove the awning with the stipulation that the color be a beige or light gray to blend with the existing facade.

23:33.274 --> 23:33.534
Great.

23:33.634 --> 23:36.156
Does your motion note that this is a variance?

23:37.197 --> 23:37.657
Yes.

23:38.177 --> 23:38.458
Okay.

23:38.518 --> 23:41.159
Due to structural conditions and placement?

23:42.240 --> 23:42.460
Yes.

23:43.041 --> 23:43.401
Okay.

23:44.061 --> 23:44.602
Is there a second?

23:44.622 --> 23:47.284
I'll second.

23:47.904 --> 23:48.865
Motion made and seconded.

23:48.925 --> 23:49.765
Is there any discussion?

23:53.768 --> 23:54.008
Okay.

23:54.028 --> 23:55.489
Commissioners, I'm going to call a roll.

23:55.549 --> 23:57.991
Commissioner Robinson, do you vote yes or no on your own motion?

23:59.072 --> 23:59.212
Yes.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.862
Commissioner Colleen, nope.

24:03.902 --> 24:06.063
Commissioner Allen, do you vote yes or no on your motion?

24:06.644 --> 24:06.864
Yes.

24:06.884 --> 24:11.426
Commissioner Hamacher, do you vote yes or no on your motion?

24:12.446 --> 24:12.727
Yes.

24:16.128 --> 24:18.269
Alderman Coder, do you vote yes or no on your motion?

24:18.969 --> 24:19.270
Yes.

24:21.130 --> 24:22.751
Chair abstains on this motion.

24:23.352 --> 24:25.953
That is Commissioner's four yeses.

24:27.285 --> 24:32.508
One abstention and one recusal, the appeal is upheld.

24:34.069 --> 24:35.030
Thank you all.

24:35.050 --> 24:37.111
Thank you for your consideration.

24:40.753 --> 24:41.894
Okay, moving through this.

24:42.755 --> 24:45.296
Commissioners, agenda item C is 4555 Pershing Place.

25:02.056 --> 25:05.778
All right, I am Andrea Gagan with the Cultural Resources Office, and I swear to tell the truth.

25:11.080 --> 25:13.621
This is 4555 Pershing Place.

25:13.641 --> 25:22.704
I need to enter into the record the agenda item, the presentation, the PowerPoint.

25:24.065 --> 25:26.886
The Central West End Ordinance 56768 is amended by 69423.

25:31.638 --> 25:35.960
The Naval Union Ordinance 64689 as amended by 64925.

25:37.681 --> 25:49.147
Three letters for neighbors, one from the Board of PPIA, one from the Central West End Planning and Development Committee, and one from Alderman Gross.

25:50.968 --> 25:54.750
And those are all in support of the appeal.

25:55.250 --> 25:56.510
And will your testimony be the truth?

25:57.251 --> 25:57.411
Yes.

25:58.560 --> 26:03.621
This is the location at the corner of Walton and Pershing Place.

26:06.922 --> 26:12.463
And this is the existing rear elevation and the rear porch in question.

26:12.863 --> 26:20.264
The applicant has applied for interior and exterior alterations on a single family home, including the removal of a rear porch and new rear addition.

26:21.244 --> 26:24.785
Given that the existing porch is in the same footprint shown on the 1909 Sanborn map,

26:26.884 --> 26:33.746
and that no documentation has been provided to dispute the originality of the porch, staff presumes the porch to be original to the house.

26:33.826 --> 26:41.108
Now, I believe the applicant has some photos now that they're going to show, but we hadn't received them before today.

26:42.448 --> 26:45.889
The Cultural Resources Office denied the permit application as the St.

26:45.909 --> 26:50.390
Louis standards do not allow for the removal of a historic porch that is visible from the street.

26:51.330 --> 26:54.791
The owner has appealed, and the matter is now being brought before the Preservation Board.

26:57.016 --> 27:02.057
As I said, this is the existing rear porch and a view from Walton.

27:03.498 --> 27:14.301
Proposed addition would require the removal of the historic rear porch and the historic district standards require that original or historic porches be preserved through in-kind maintenance and repair.

27:19.122 --> 27:25.924
Here is just the side elevations showing the proposed addition in a rear elevation which

27:26.747 --> 27:41.756
shows a section drawing of the patio area that they're adding, and then an elevation of the rear of the addition.

27:44.318 --> 27:49.301
The majority of the work on the permit application complies with the Central West End Historic District standards.

27:49.341 --> 27:52.843
The removal of the visible porch at the rear of the building does not comply.

27:52.863 --> 27:56.325
Although the addition itself would be compliant,

27:56.874 --> 28:01.516
with the standards may not be completed without the removal of the rear porch.

28:02.577 --> 28:07.219
So the Cultural Resources Office recommends the Preservation Board uphold the director's denial as a proposal.

28:07.439 --> 28:14.082
Removal of the rear porch and construction of a rear addition does not comply with the Southwestern Historic District Standards.

28:18.464 --> 28:26.328
Just to clarify, you're asking us to consider removal of the porch, not the quality of the addition.

28:27.148 --> 28:27.488
Correct.

28:29.129 --> 28:34.852
And looking at your screen there, how many people have signed up to speak besides the appellant?

28:34.872 --> 28:39.334
Let's see.

28:39.474 --> 28:41.135
OK, just one.

28:41.155 --> 28:51.701
Actually, there's two other than the, because that's not the, oh, I guess, yeah, that's just one other than the owner, I believe.

28:52.541 --> 28:53.242
Although, I don't know.

28:55.031 --> 28:57.091
the alderman, so I don't speak.

28:57.632 --> 28:58.692
Okay, what's your final answer?

28:58.752 --> 28:59.872
Just one person?

29:01.092 --> 29:03.033
One other than the applicant, yeah.

29:03.913 --> 29:04.533
Great, thank you.

29:05.693 --> 29:06.713
Let's hear from the appellant.

29:07.253 --> 29:08.314
I'm sorry to interrupt.

29:08.714 --> 29:19.976
Mr. Chairman, I apologize, but I did enter into a single entry in the chat that I hoped to speak on both the previous matter and this one.

29:20.899 --> 29:26.783
I, I assumed that Miss Gagan was addressing you in your role as the informal alderman.

29:29.565 --> 29:31.107
And I was going to call on you anyway.

29:31.827 --> 29:33.188
Yeah, it went to the wrong chat.

29:33.268 --> 29:35.250
I think that was problem.

29:35.810 --> 29:36.230
Good enough.

29:36.811 --> 29:38.212
We'll remember you when the time comes.

29:38.692 --> 29:39.633
Let's hear from the appellant.

29:45.566 --> 29:46.146
Hi, everybody.

29:46.427 --> 29:48.008
Zach Foster here.

29:48.028 --> 29:49.809
This is my wife, Janie Foster.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.531
Zip code 63108.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.073
And we swear to tell the truth.

29:55.594 --> 29:55.854
Perfect.

29:55.874 --> 29:56.774
That's good till midnight.

29:58.536 --> 30:01.018
Really enjoying the comedy show, Mr. Callow.

30:01.058 --> 30:03.179
So thank you for that.

30:03.239 --> 30:04.300
Completely unintended.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.942
Proceed, please.

30:06.962 --> 30:07.823
What do you want us to do?

30:08.510 --> 30:08.951
Yeah, great.

30:09.051 --> 30:10.733
Really appreciate the time, everyone.

30:11.835 --> 30:16.581
We moved into 4555 Pershing Place in 2014.

30:16.642 --> 30:18.965
We now have two young girls.

30:20.046 --> 30:24.453
We've been working diligently on our own and with a team to

30:25.454 --> 30:30.878
the standards of the house to get it in a place for the next 100 years.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.078
This is our forever home.

30:32.118 --> 30:35.341
This is where we want to be.

30:35.561 --> 30:51.413
We've scoured every source possible, including Missouri Historical Society, to try to find additional documentation that proves one way or the other the condition and state of our current porch, the north-facing porch.

30:52.645 --> 30:56.566
We have the 1909 drawings as noted before.

30:56.586 --> 31:03.328
In lieu of additional documentation, we've turned to physical evidence within the house.

31:04.128 --> 31:09.330
I'll hand it over to my wife to fill in some of the details there.

31:09.350 --> 31:14.391
On the next slide, if it's possible to go there.

31:16.857 --> 31:31.751
Beneath the porch you can see again this is just sort of some sleuthing and evidence gathering that we've done on our own because the only thing that we've been able to uncover is that 1909 kind of pencil outline drawing of the home.

31:33.072 --> 31:35.615
There is clearly a bricked in

31:38.012 --> 31:45.216
opening that was once there, whether it was a window or a coal chute of some sort, we do not know.

31:45.857 --> 31:55.042
But based on the outside and the way the port sits down there, it would have obscured the original intention of that opening.

31:55.722 --> 32:00.685
You can see it from the inside, too, for your viewing pleasure.

32:01.706 --> 32:05.308
There's one other bit of evidence that unfortunately is not in this

32:06.969 --> 32:24.743
presentation, if you don't mind us adding it in there, there are some pockmarks on the side of the home that show that perhaps this porch had a different sizing shape that maybe is more in line with that 1909

32:27.425 --> 32:31.050
drawing that is sort of what we're going off of here.

32:31.530 --> 32:40.821
There's also a door up on the second floor that suggests that there was some sort of usage from that second floor.

32:40.841 --> 32:45.406
The current porch as it stands would not support weight on the roof.

32:45.426 --> 32:46.227
So,

32:48.371 --> 32:58.299
We've done everything that we can to try to preserve and understand the history of this part of the house.

32:58.899 --> 33:16.593
We've also turned to neighbors for precedent with this sort of things, rear porches that set behind fences, and both neighbors directly of Caddy Corner Trust on the corner of Lenox and Walton recently

33:17.434 --> 33:19.502
removed a dilapidated porch.

33:21.078 --> 33:33.787
in favor of an updated one that is quite sizable, includes a kitchen expansion within it, and it's enclosed with windows, similar to what we're presenting.

33:34.667 --> 33:50.618
And then also our neighbor directly east of us, you can see in one of the earlier photos, there's ghost lines of the porch that was removed just in 2020 in favor of a modern deck that goes across the whole side of the house.

33:52.539 --> 33:54.400
So that is what we have.

33:55.401 --> 34:01.345
Our intention, as my husband said, our intention is to maintain the integrity of our home.

34:01.565 --> 34:02.305
We love our home.

34:02.365 --> 34:03.446
We love our neighborhood.

34:04.307 --> 34:12.912
We are deeply invested in the Central West End, and we have great respect for the homes that were built there in the early 1900s.

34:15.474 --> 34:28.806
and we are preserving the front of the home to what we hope is a T, and we are hoping to push this home into a place where it can stand for families the next 100 years.

34:33.610 --> 34:36.953
Did you happen to notice if the Sandbergs have a pool?

34:39.515 --> 34:40.336
That they have a pool?

34:40.857 --> 34:41.117
Do they?

34:41.826 --> 34:42.526
Yeah.

34:42.706 --> 34:43.567
John and Celeste.

34:43.607 --> 34:43.807
Yeah.

34:44.087 --> 34:44.327
Yes.

34:45.507 --> 34:46.968
And they have not invited me over.

34:48.228 --> 34:48.789
How dare they?

34:49.089 --> 34:50.049
I can't speak to that.

34:50.069 --> 34:53.130
I have been to that pool.

34:53.190 --> 34:53.911
It's very nice.

34:54.531 --> 34:57.032
I will be making some notes on this subject.

34:57.652 --> 35:00.893
And also extraneous to this conversation.

35:01.113 --> 35:02.494
Commissioner's questions for the appellant.

35:04.690 --> 35:05.671
I have one question.

35:05.731 --> 35:07.912
I'm looking at the photograph here.

35:08.052 --> 35:10.053
Thank you, these help.

35:11.333 --> 35:17.557
And that wood evident on the right hand photograph doesn't look very old to me.

35:18.217 --> 35:23.520
Do you think any of the materials on this porch are original at this point?

35:24.873 --> 35:30.836
So we replaced the stairs on the porch because they were rotting.

35:30.856 --> 35:53.228
And in the process of replacing the stairs, the contractor who did the work, he found that there were quite a few new pieces that had been put on the porch, around the porch, newer uprights to support the porch.

35:55.930 --> 35:59.792
I'm sorry that we do not have a picture of these pockmarks.

35:59.872 --> 36:02.594
We are trying to find ghost lines and such like that.

36:04.195 --> 36:14.901
These are substantial pockmarks that run parallel to the current porch just east of the porch as seen from the rear of the house.

36:15.301 --> 36:22.485
That suggests it had a different footprint originally than what is there now.

36:25.201 --> 36:25.561
Thank you.

36:25.622 --> 36:41.452
I mean, I'll say I did examine the 1909 map, and if you map that onto your house, the original porch would have extended to the midline, and the current porch does not, so those drawings are all to scale, so I don't know.

36:41.852 --> 36:43.233
Just a little of my own investigation.

36:43.293 --> 36:43.513
Thanks.

36:44.054 --> 36:44.534
Yeah, thank you.

36:44.554 --> 36:45.635
If there's any further questions?

36:48.877 --> 36:49.197
Okay.

36:50.898 --> 36:51.799
Alderman Grass, are you here?

36:56.149 --> 36:58.170
I am you want to speak first or last.

36:59.490 --> 37:13.116
I don't care, I you know I sent a letter in that I think has most my comments, I think sums it up, you know I was really just I think that the exception should be made here, you know the the porches in the back and doesn't contribute much I think to the.

37:13.616 --> 37:20.659
To the House, I think this addition is pretty important to the residents on to keep them here, I really just popped in, though, to say that.

37:21.087 --> 37:27.989
you know, I wrote that letter, I didn't even really realize that there was kind of this question of whether or not the porch was even original.

37:28.449 --> 37:39.613
And, you know, kind of hearing some of it, you know, I feel like, you know, there's a big enough question of fact about whether or not this porch is even original to begin with.

37:39.793 --> 37:43.534
But even if it is, I'd certainly still be in favor of the exception.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.274
Great.

37:45.774 --> 37:46.275
Thank you, sir.

37:46.675 --> 37:47.695
Mr. Dreier, are you still here?

37:49.896 --> 37:50.596
Yes, I am.

37:51.892 --> 37:53.053
Okay, you're still under oath.

37:53.993 --> 37:55.954
Good, then I will proceed.

37:55.974 --> 38:15.566
Mr. Chairman and members of the board, the issue on appeal today, that is whether to permit the demolition of an existing rear porch to allow construction of a new two-story addition is a matter on which there are conflicting views among members of the CWE planning and development committee.

38:16.607 --> 38:20.509
I will note here that had we known what we just learned about

38:21.124 --> 38:30.949
the additional information that was not available until today, perhaps the dynamics of that conversation among committee members might have changed.

38:30.989 --> 38:48.219
But nevertheless, based on what we knew at the time, we agreed that the proposed demolition would violate the applicable provisions of the Central West End Historic District Standards, and that it is not the practice of the committee to endorse proposals that conflict with the standards.

38:50.131 --> 38:55.574
We also recognize that there are rare occasions on which exceptions may warrant consideration.

38:56.835 --> 39:09.383
When such exceptions have occurred, they've been justified based on a subjective evaluation of the relative merits of that which is proposed versus the perceived consequences of the demolition.

39:10.644 --> 39:13.626
Such was the case when in March of 2022,

39:15.711 --> 39:35.189
The committee offered a favorable recommendation regarding the proposed demolition of the residential structure at 4952-54 McPherson Avenue to accommodate new construction related to the adaptive reuse of the adjacent Reliance Automotive property.

39:36.630 --> 39:37.411
In this instance,

39:37.935 --> 39:56.618
It is agreed that the design of the proposed addition would warrant a favorable recommendation from the committee, were it not for the demolition, and that the existing porch, while highly visible, is located on the rear elevation and is arguably not a defining feature of the house.

39:58.058 --> 40:05.280
Following considerable deliberation, the committee has concluded that it will not oppose the proposed demolition.

40:06.240 --> 40:06.600
Thank you.

40:08.919 --> 40:09.619
Thank you very much.

40:11.741 --> 40:14.763
Commissioners, that concludes the testimony we have on this matter.

40:17.444 --> 40:18.765
Commissioner Killeen, have you got a motion?

40:20.126 --> 40:20.906
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

40:21.087 --> 40:29.292
I move that the Preservation Board override the director's denial of this and let the porch demolition occur.

40:30.532 --> 40:37.777
And that demolition would be pending a building permit for the new structure before it is allowed.

40:39.019 --> 40:39.620
Is there a second?

40:40.260 --> 40:40.620
Second.

40:42.142 --> 40:42.662
Discussion?

40:44.684 --> 40:51.430
Commissioners, it is my belief that that is not an original porch, and that we don't need a variance for this.

40:51.450 --> 40:57.816
We're not proposing to demolish a original porch, but rather a replacement porch.

40:58.776 --> 40:59.957
Totally agree, Mr. Chairman.

41:01.359 --> 41:02.159
Any further discussion?

41:04.441 --> 41:06.043
OK, commissioners, I'm going to call a roll.

41:07.836 --> 41:10.478
On this motion, Commissioner Robinson, do you vote yes or no?

41:11.779 --> 41:11.979
Yes.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.423
On your motion, Commissioner Killeen, do you vote yes or no?

41:17.783 --> 41:18.143
Yes.

41:20.585 --> 41:22.906
On this motion, Commissioner Allen, do you vote yes or no?

41:23.747 --> 41:24.007
Yes.

41:25.268 --> 41:27.609
On this motion, Commissioner Hamacher, do you vote yes or no?

41:28.670 --> 41:28.970
Yes.

41:30.251 --> 41:32.953
On this motion, Alderman Coder, do you vote yes or no?

41:33.593 --> 41:33.854
Yes.

41:35.034 --> 41:40.236
The chair abstains on this, counts five yeses and one abstention.

41:40.656 --> 41:42.496
The appeal is upheld.

41:44.017 --> 41:44.777
Thank you all.

41:45.457 --> 41:46.218
Thank you, commissioners.

41:47.058 --> 41:52.000
If you see John and Celeste, you might mention that Calla wants to know where the heck his invitation is.

41:52.500 --> 41:52.860
Got it.

41:53.100 --> 41:55.041
If you have a dog, that's favorable.

41:55.161 --> 41:57.081
They let our dog in before they let us in.

41:58.382 --> 41:59.562
Yep, that sounds like them.

41:59.802 --> 42:00.062
Yeah.

42:00.442 --> 42:01.283
Thank you all very much.

42:02.083 --> 42:02.283
Sure.

42:03.874 --> 42:09.795
Okay, commissioners, let's move on to agenda item D, which is 5806 Westminster Place.

42:12.576 --> 42:25.278
Okay, I'm actually going to merge 5806 and 5808 Westminster.

42:25.298 --> 42:27.539
One is an appeal and the other is a new application.

42:34.612 --> 42:38.775
but they are on neighboring parcels and basically the same building.

42:40.337 --> 42:41.798
The same applicant and owner.

42:42.919 --> 42:44.820
For a second there, Barb, can we do this?

42:48.623 --> 42:52.646
My only concern would be for clarity on appeal.

42:53.006 --> 43:01.433
I'm thinking that this is one structure that's proposed for two address flats, is that correct?

43:02.199 --> 43:06.121
No, it's two separate buildings, but there's separate lots.

43:06.161 --> 43:07.161
They're just next to each other.

43:07.802 --> 43:15.586
And the review one of one kind of depends on the other because of the visibility of the sides.

43:16.886 --> 43:22.569
Um, so I mean, you do the first one and sort of interject when it's appropriate.

43:22.589 --> 43:29.072
And then when you get to the second one, um, you can state that some of it is substantially the same as what we've heard.

43:29.732 --> 43:30.793
Does that sound reasonable?

43:32.544 --> 43:33.164
Yeah, I guess.

43:33.785 --> 43:37.447
I was just going to do ask for two separate things at the end, but that's fine.

43:40.630 --> 43:55.141
So the proposal is to construct a detached, oh actually let me go ahead and enter the agenda item, the PowerPoint, the presentation, and the enabling ordinance 648689 is

44:04.585 --> 44:12.367
sorry, in the state of Oliver, Catlin Tract, Parkview, Historic District Standards, Ordinance 57688, as amended by 70821.

44:12.408 --> 44:13.588
And my testimony will be the truth.

44:13.928 --> 44:16.469
All right, so this is a lot that is two partials.

44:33.248 --> 44:35.409
The one closest to construction is 5806.

44:35.449 --> 44:44.811
This just kind of shows the location, which is close to Laurel and Westminster.

44:47.472 --> 44:52.413
This is the site plan on the left for 5806 Westminster.

44:52.433 --> 44:59.235
The lot is slightly narrower than the one next to it.

45:02.061 --> 45:05.603
This is a proposed treescape, which shows the two buildings.

45:07.824 --> 45:15.028
The one on the left is the 5806, which is the one we're dealing with right now.

45:17.549 --> 45:24.033
And this is the reference building in the Skinkinapoliver Historic District.

45:24.273 --> 45:30.576
You don't have to have a model example, but they did base it on one of the neighboring buildings.

45:31.483 --> 45:35.424
so that it will be compatible with the neighborhood.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.766
And then this is just the front elevation.

45:41.106 --> 45:46.908
And they are changing the second-story door to, right now it's like a half-glass door.

45:47.048 --> 45:50.670
They're changing it to a three-quarter full light, as we had asked.

45:53.591 --> 45:55.211
And these are the side elevations.

45:59.090 --> 46:10.013
For this, one of the, actually this building is totally within the historic district standards as far as the returns on the sides.

46:12.014 --> 46:20.376
They, speaking of Oliver, requires the width of the, between the buildings plus two feet.

46:21.756 --> 46:27.018
None of the buildings are more than 10 feet apart and the extensions are 13 feet.

46:28.122 --> 46:29.203
feet 8 inches.

46:32.145 --> 46:33.886
And this is just the rear elevation.

46:38.169 --> 46:54.020
And this is context to the east, which our new construction that were built quite a few years ago at this point, and then context west on the street, and then the context across Westminster.

46:58.655 --> 47:06.538
buildings substantially comply with the Skinker, Bolliger, Catlin, Track, Parkview Local Historic District Standards.

47:07.418 --> 47:20.722
And for 5806 Westminster, the Cultural Resources Office recommends the Preservation Board overturn the Director's Administrative Denial with a stipulation that final plans and exterior materials be reviewed and approved by the Cultural Resources Office.

47:21.322 --> 47:23.523
Quick question, why was it administratively denied?

47:24.660 --> 47:39.712
Just due to time constraints, because they originally, they had only applied for one building, and that would require them to do a full brick or an upgrade on the side elevation as far as the material.

47:41.453 --> 47:47.818
So we were waiting on them to apply for the second building so that we could review it all at the same time.

47:49.682 --> 47:52.584
So do they have building permits for both applications?

47:52.604 --> 47:53.525
Yes, now they've applied.

47:53.545 --> 47:55.026
Yes, they have an application for both now.

47:57.288 --> 47:57.928
OK.

48:00.650 --> 48:04.854
Tell me, is there anybody here to speak for or against this besides the appellant?

48:06.795 --> 48:08.636
I don't believe so.

48:08.656 --> 48:14.261
I don't think anybody signed up, although I thought that the

48:18.897 --> 48:20.218
Applicant is here, though.

48:20.238 --> 48:23.761
It's Ramon Sarmento.

48:23.781 --> 48:26.343
OK.

48:27.724 --> 48:35.590
Commissioners, the testimony that we just heard is that this project complies and substantially complies with all of the requirements.

48:36.371 --> 48:37.612
Do we need to hear from the appellant?

48:37.632 --> 48:41.575
I don't think so.

48:41.615 --> 48:42.396
OK.

48:43.617 --> 48:46.139
Commissioner Allen, have you got a motion for agenda item D?

48:49.229 --> 49:07.201
Yes, agenda item D. So I move that the Preservation Board overturn the Director's Administrative Denial of the current design with stipulation that final plans and exterior materials be reviewed and approved by the Cultural Resources Office.

49:07.781 --> 49:08.422
Is there a second?

49:08.442 --> 49:10.523
Second.

49:11.204 --> 49:11.904
Any discussion?

49:12.725 --> 49:14.266
Hearing none, I'll call a roll.

49:14.326 --> 49:16.127
Commissioner Robinson, do you vote yes or no?

49:17.308 --> 49:17.468
Yes.

49:18.578 --> 49:20.259
Commissioner Colleen, do you vote yes or no?

49:20.279 --> 49:20.339
Yes.

49:20.700 --> 49:24.662
Commissioner Allen, do you vote yes or no?

49:24.682 --> 49:25.303
Yes.

49:25.883 --> 49:27.585
Commissioner Hamacher, do you vote yes or no?

49:28.365 --> 49:28.665
Yes.

49:29.806 --> 49:31.367
Alderman Coder, do you vote yes or no?

49:31.928 --> 49:32.268
Yes.

49:33.289 --> 49:34.630
Chair abstains on this matter.

49:34.810 --> 49:37.452
I count one, two, three, four, five yeses.

49:38.312 --> 49:40.414
The appeal is upheld.

49:43.114 --> 49:51.162
Commissioner Allen, while I have you, have you got a motion on agenda item E?

49:51.242 --> 49:53.804
Can I just move that we adopt the previous rule?

49:54.325 --> 49:55.106
Or do I have to make a motion?

49:55.346 --> 49:55.786
No, you can.

49:55.806 --> 49:58.289
All right, I move that we adopt the previous rule.

49:58.309 --> 50:01.572
Do we need a motion first, Chairman?

50:03.394 --> 50:04.955
Yeah, would you make a motion to?

50:07.310 --> 50:21.673
PB, David Ensign — Herndon, COB?s iPhone 2?s iPhone 3?s iPhone 4?s iPhone 5?s iPhone 6?s iPhone 7?s iPhone 8?s iPhone 9?s iPhone 10?s iPhone 11?s iPhone 12?s iPhone 13?s iPhone 14?s iPhone 15?s iPhone 16?s iPhone 17?s iPhone 18?s iPhone 19?s iPhone 20?s iPhone 21?s iPhone 22?s iPhone 23?s iPhone 24?s iPhone 25?s iPhone 26?s iPhone 27?s iPhone 28?s iPhone 29?s iPhone 30?s iPhone 31?s iPhone 32?s iPhone 33?s iPhone 33?s iPhone 34?s iPhone 35?s iPhone 36?s iPhone 37?s

50:40.854 --> 50:41.395
Hey, I'm back.

50:41.895 --> 50:45.439
We're back to director best Well, I don't.

50:45.839 --> 50:47.121
Let's not do that to myself.

50:47.321 --> 50:48.502
Like, Mike is a great job.

50:48.562 --> 50:52.106
Let's jinx that shall we.

50:52.406 --> 50:52.646
Okay.

50:55.710 --> 50:56.090
Okay.

50:57.572 --> 51:03.398
I'm gonna go ahead and enter in all this stuff just for the sake of consistency, you know, it's a new application.

51:05.199 --> 51:18.982
64689, as amended by 69423, a Benton Park ordinance, 67175, presentation, PowerPoint, step report, and I still do live at 63139 in beautiful Clifton Heights.

51:19.482 --> 51:26.523
Okay, to make the record clear, are we hearing F and G together?

51:27.103 --> 51:28.243
Yeah, I was gonna say that next.

51:28.383 --> 51:31.464
Just for clarity's sake, yeah, they're both new applications, they're not separate,

51:32.391 --> 51:37.975
They're identical designs, they're side-by-side, two different parcels, but I figured, yeah, just do it at the same time, that's okay.

51:38.995 --> 51:39.976
Same applicant.

51:40.916 --> 51:42.737
This is a preliminary review, is that okay with you?

51:44.058 --> 51:45.199
No, it's a new application.

51:46.380 --> 51:49.721
Sorry, it is a new application, not an administrative appeal.

51:50.422 --> 51:53.123
So it's one project, yes.

51:53.224 --> 51:58.927
Yeah, one project by one developer, but two different buildings on two different parcels, two applications.

52:04.326 --> 52:15.891
The complexity of trying to separate that out as you prepare it, but the board did a good job of addressing both agenda items separately in the last instance, so it's kind of similar.

52:15.911 --> 52:21.734
Except in the other case, one was an appeal and one was a new application.

52:22.535 --> 52:23.055
Correct.

52:26.336 --> 52:28.858
I hate it when somebody agrees with me and I still don't win.

52:28.878 --> 52:29.758
Yeah.

52:31.462 --> 52:34.683
Okay, we'll just do two motions, but Bob, do one presentation.

52:35.864 --> 52:36.264
Sounds good.

52:36.804 --> 52:39.225
Okay, so this is the site in question.

52:40.726 --> 52:46.868
3315 and 3317 Lemp in the Benton Park Local Historic District.

52:46.888 --> 52:52.150
Yeah, the property used to contain a large, I believe it was a two-story, three-story, three-family building.

52:52.170 --> 52:55.432
It was a large building that was demolished, I believe, in like 2015, 16.

53:00.214 --> 53:01.054
Here's the location.

53:02.428 --> 53:04.730
just south of the park.

53:06.871 --> 53:08.773
Here's some street-level context for you.

53:08.793 --> 53:13.997
Obviously, the empty lot on the left picture on the slide is the location.

53:14.377 --> 53:21.202
Across the street are really some great new infill that we have had over the past few years in Benton Park.

53:21.262 --> 53:25.905
So this block has a lot of new construction on it, so it's a lot of diverse

53:27.760 --> 53:38.589
context architecturally, you have a one-story commercial to one side and you have three stories, so it's the block has various heights, setbacks, ages of buildings, styles of buildings, so it's a really kind of a really cool diverse block.

53:40.330 --> 53:45.454
This is looking south along that and it kind of continues that theme of new construction and various heights of buildings and setbacks.

53:47.612 --> 53:53.697
Here is a streetscape showing the two new buildings in context with the adjacent buildings.

53:53.717 --> 53:58.962
You can see that, for the most part, the fenestration will align with the properties to the north.

54:00.063 --> 54:03.145
Obviously, we have some lower-scale stuff to the south.

54:06.608 --> 54:13.674
This is the proposed front elevation, and the model example is seen on the right on Illinois.

54:15.945 --> 54:16.925
These are the elevations.

54:17.005 --> 54:20.407
All the elevations are uniform on all four sides.

54:20.427 --> 54:22.848
They'll be the same on each unit.

54:22.908 --> 54:25.169
And then you have the rear elevation, same as both.

54:28.731 --> 54:30.031
So some context.

54:30.051 --> 54:31.092
I'm going to back up a little bit.

54:33.653 --> 54:36.294
I appear to have neglected to add a site plan.

54:36.314 --> 54:38.695
That is on me, so I sincerely apologize for that.

54:39.495 --> 54:41.456
But I will say that the buildings do align.

54:42.509 --> 54:44.571
with the property to the south.

54:44.691 --> 54:46.052
But again, the block is varied.

54:46.812 --> 54:51.216
So the Preservation Board actually has seen this design from this developer before.

54:52.357 --> 55:00.003
Back in 2019, the Preservation Board approved this very design for a property over on Illinois.

55:00.604 --> 55:04.487
So at that time, staff recommended approval, as we're going to today.

55:04.507 --> 55:10.011
I want you to know that essentially everything on the front facade is what you saw in 2019.

55:11.847 --> 55:13.448
There really is no deviation.

55:14.189 --> 55:17.992
The brick returns to an appropriate distance on the sides.

55:18.412 --> 55:21.435
There's like six-ish feet, barely, on the south side.

55:22.035 --> 55:24.897
And then on the north side, I think about eight feet.

55:25.117 --> 55:28.500
Returns are going to go back about 12 feet on the sides on H1.

55:28.800 --> 55:32.683
So, again, you've seen it before, and we, at that time, we did recommend approval.

55:33.184 --> 55:39.729
So just going through the code really quickly, complies with setback, alignment.

55:39.869 --> 55:41.370
We feel the mass is appropriate.

55:42.262 --> 55:44.444
The scale of the buildings are also appropriate.

55:45.145 --> 55:52.171
Proportion wise, we feel that it meets the model example in terms of fenestration as brick to opening ratio complies.

55:53.592 --> 55:55.774
The front elevation will be a red brick.

55:56.035 --> 55:58.677
Foundation will be a painted concrete gray.

55:58.697 --> 56:02.640
So everything else does comply for the most part.

56:02.660 --> 56:05.543
There are some minor deviations just for the

56:08.387 --> 56:19.218
level of detail for some of the proportions, but overall, it does comply and staff is recommending approval of the designs as submitted to be consistent with what we approved previously.

56:20.899 --> 56:25.283
You were sent a letter this afternoon from Benton Park.

56:26.124 --> 56:28.166
Mr. Mulligan is here to speak on the item again.

56:28.186 --> 56:32.110
So if you have any questions, again, staff recommends that the board

56:32.845 --> 56:43.557
approve the new applications subject to the conditions that final details, drawings, and other materials, exterior materials, and colors for the house be reviewed and approved by CRO.

56:44.918 --> 56:46.119
Question about windows, Bob.

56:46.840 --> 56:47.421
Yes, sir.

56:48.842 --> 56:52.506
Are we going to allow them to tint the windows or are they going to be clear?

56:53.387 --> 56:54.248
They should be clear.

56:56.139 --> 57:02.904
Those pictures you guys just showed of the new projects across the street, they're all tinted, which is against the guidelines.

57:02.964 --> 57:03.724
I just looked it up.

57:03.965 --> 57:09.689
Section 203L31 says no tinted glass, and there it is.

57:10.129 --> 57:16.814
And the new one going up at the corner of Salina Street and Crittenden also, I mean, they just put the windows in, they're all tinted.

57:17.095 --> 57:21.798
So I don't know how we can stop these folks from putting in tinted windows.

57:21.878 --> 57:25.241
I can't imagine you guys are allowing that, but it's happening all over Benton Park.

57:26.522 --> 57:27.463
Yeah, well, we will look into that.

57:27.483 --> 57:28.964
Thank you.

57:32.887 --> 57:33.928
Further questions for Bob?

57:36.510 --> 57:37.731
OK, let's hear from the applicant.

57:38.091 --> 57:40.833
Wait, Bob, who besides Tim is here to speak?

57:40.853 --> 57:48.659
So we have just the applicant, and Tim Mulligan is here from Benton Park.

57:49.159 --> 57:49.480
Perfect.

57:49.580 --> 57:50.460
Let's have the applicant up.

57:50.621 --> 57:51.741
We probably have some questions.

57:52.762 --> 57:54.424
Sure.

57:54.804 --> 57:55.765
Orlando Askins.

57:56.724 --> 57:58.224
Um, forgive me.

57:58.264 --> 57:59.465
I forgot what I was supposed to say.

57:59.625 --> 58:00.965
Um, other than I will tell the truth.

58:01.525 --> 58:01.725
Okay.

58:02.025 --> 58:09.867
Um, actually, I'm not even going to square you in on a new application, but we probably have some questions for you commissioners.

58:13.567 --> 58:15.528
No questions.

58:16.288 --> 58:16.668
Okay.

58:17.048 --> 58:21.489
Mr. Askins, have you read the conditions proposed by the cultural resources office?

58:25.140 --> 58:26.481
I've read the recommendations.

58:27.541 --> 58:28.022
Do you agree?

58:28.042 --> 58:28.962
I do.

58:29.622 --> 58:30.823
Are you going to tint those windows?

58:32.044 --> 58:33.124
I don't know where that's coming from.

58:33.164 --> 58:34.385
I've never tinted a window before.

58:35.105 --> 58:35.585
OK, then.

58:36.006 --> 58:37.967
You made at least one commissioner happy.

58:39.447 --> 58:39.668
Good.

58:40.188 --> 58:40.788
Happy to do so.

58:41.429 --> 58:43.430
How many other ones do I have to make happy?

58:43.450 --> 58:43.790
Let's see.

58:43.850 --> 58:44.290
Five, six?

58:46.251 --> 58:47.532
We'll see how it goes.

58:48.452 --> 58:49.673
Stand by, Mr. Atkins.

58:49.713 --> 58:51.794
Mr. Mulligan, do you want to say something?

58:54.898 --> 59:00.801
Uh, yes, I, we would request that this be deferred until we have time to meet with the applicant.

59:01.321 --> 59:07.524
Uh, this, uh, we were made aware of this after the February 8th.

59:08.204 --> 59:13.387
Committee meeting that we had and that this was, I'm not sure why it was.

59:13.407 --> 59:20.790
Uh, uh, put on the agenda so quickly, uh, but we are not, um,

59:21.991 --> 59:29.234
Delighted with the way a previous project of Mr. Askins turned out on Illinois Avenue.

59:30.455 --> 59:39.839
Furthermore, the window patterns in the model to what has been built and what is proposed really don't line up.

59:40.299 --> 59:42.760
I mean, those are all divided windows.

59:44.561 --> 59:48.502
And I think one of the other things that we noticed was missing would be

59:50.945 --> 59:54.807
window that's at the basement level on the front of the house.

59:56.187 --> 01:00:08.152
The house that's on the 3317 shows the vinyl siding returning whatever the appropriate distance is, 8 feet or 10 feet.

01:00:08.292 --> 01:00:13.414
But that is a one-story building to the south of that.

01:00:14.115 --> 01:00:16.316
Over the top of that building, you will see

01:00:17.423 --> 01:00:19.704
you know, all of the vinyl siding.

01:00:20.024 --> 01:00:34.409
So as you can see with the photographs from across the street, you know, where we had that condition, we work with the developer to return the brick, you know, to the back edge of that part of the building.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:46.034
You know, so I think there's some details that just need to be, you know, firmed up here and made to better align

01:00:46.638 --> 01:00:48.480
you know, with the model example.

01:00:51.324 --> 01:00:55.669
May I introduce or say something really quick about the windows?

01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:58.653
Actually, let me ask you a question.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:00:59.234
Sure.

01:00:59.474 --> 01:01:01.517
Do you want to talk to these people before we decide?

01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:10.412
I'm not really certain what there is to discuss other than we're building the exact same thing that we built in the past.

01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:16.835
As far as split windows, we didn't do split windows.

01:01:16.855 --> 01:01:19.356
They're solid one piece windows.

01:01:19.436 --> 01:01:21.356
There's no split windows on this property.

01:01:22.037 --> 01:01:24.658
And then he speaks of a front window in the basement.

01:01:25.178 --> 01:01:26.818
Well, the plans never called for that.

01:01:27.199 --> 01:01:28.159
So we didn't put one in.

01:01:29.162 --> 01:01:30.423
Um, and we used them.

01:01:30.843 --> 01:01:33.225
I mean, they were approved as it sits currently.

01:01:33.925 --> 01:01:39.888
So, um, we didn't leave a window out by choice.

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:41.029
It just wasn't in the plans.

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:54.197
And then also, as he said something about a split window, um, the model match on 3313 has split windows, but ours were solid one piece windows and that's what was approved.

01:01:54.357 --> 01:01:57.539
So we, we followed it to, as to the plans.

01:01:59.764 --> 01:02:06.069
So I don't mind working with them, but I just don't know what else could be added to what has already been approved.

01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.910
That's what I'm saying.

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:10.192
OK, thank you, Mr. Haskins.

01:02:10.273 --> 01:02:12.274
Chairman, may I ask clarity?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.816
This is a new application for a permit.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.377
Has the application been filed?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:19.280
Yes.

01:02:20.944 --> 01:02:25.387
Chairman, could you ask the cultural resource office in their file?

01:02:26.227 --> 01:02:33.691
It appears to me that they have 50 days from the date of an application to grant or deny the permit, but I don't know where we are in that period.

01:02:35.212 --> 01:02:37.934
So, we mean, the applied.

01:02:38.835 --> 01:02:42.317
the application back on the 6th of February.

01:02:42.377 --> 01:02:45.619
So we're still within that first window for application.

01:02:46.119 --> 01:02:47.040
It's not even been denied yet.

01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.160
So we haven't even started that clock.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:51.422
So there's plenty of time to bring the item back if need be.

01:02:51.462 --> 01:02:54.104
We can even deny it and then come back as an admin.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.025
But we have plenty of time to work with the applicant.

01:03:00.207 --> 01:03:01.408
Commissioners, what's your pleasure?

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.210
Commissioner Allen, what do you think?

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.351
I move to defer, Mr. Chairman.

01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:09.121
Is the motion on the floor?

01:03:10.181 --> 01:03:10.822
Is there a second?

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:11.562
I second.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.662
The motion on the floor has been made and seconded.

01:03:14.722 --> 01:03:15.542
Is there any discussion?

01:03:18.123 --> 01:03:30.445
Hearing none, all those in favor of deferring agenda items F and G, signify by saying aye.

01:03:31.045 --> 01:03:31.385
Aye.

01:03:31.885 --> 01:03:32.085
Aye.

01:03:32.105 --> 01:03:33.106
Opposed?

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:35.266
Aye.

01:03:37.961 --> 01:03:41.523
Commissioner Hamacher, you are making me laugh.

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:43.044
Sorry.

01:03:45.406 --> 01:03:45.846
It is fine.

01:03:46.687 --> 01:03:47.967
I believe that the motion carries.

01:03:49.668 --> 01:03:53.951
Commissioners, that concludes the business that we have before us.

01:03:53.971 --> 01:03:55.852
Does anybody have anything to add for the good of the order?

01:03:57.714 --> 01:03:59.735
Hearing nothing, Commissioner Hamacher, good luck.

01:03:59.755 --> 01:04:03.017
Thank you.

01:04:03.117 --> 01:04:04.538
Speedy delivery on the boy.

01:04:07.085 --> 01:04:07.365
Or a girl.

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:10.650
OK.

01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:11.771
Do I hear a motion to adjourn?

01:04:13.934 --> 01:04:14.455
So moved.

01:04:16.117 --> 01:04:16.758
Any objection?

01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:19.081
Hearing none, we stand adjourned.
