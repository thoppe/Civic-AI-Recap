WEBVTT

00:06.806 --> 00:21.586
Okay, the board will reconvene and we will start with item 8 on the update of our assessment system called CASP and we also have an information and action item here.

00:21.826 --> 00:22.127
Thank you.

00:25.285 --> 00:31.487
Good morning, President Kirst, Chief Glenn Price, members of the board.

00:31.547 --> 00:34.949
I'm Michelle Senner, Director of the Assessment Division here.

00:35.629 --> 00:43.812
And it has been a while since I have come before the board and provided you an update on where we are with our CASP program.

00:43.832 --> 00:45.632
Or at least it seems like it's been a while.

00:45.672 --> 00:49.334
Maybe that's because I took a nice vacation to Ireland in between.

00:51.437 --> 00:58.819
Well, I keep threatening my staff that I might start scheduling my vacations at board meeting times, and they don't think it's very funny.

00:58.899 --> 00:59.359
I don't know.

01:00.779 --> 01:02.440
So I'm here today to give you an update.

01:02.920 --> 01:12.422
And because it's been a while, we might pause in between some of the topics and see if you have questions, because they are so different, a lot of standalone topics in the item.

01:12.462 --> 01:14.783
So if you think that would be helpful, we can go ahead and do that.

01:16.525 --> 01:24.972
So let's start off by saying I'm happy to report that we had our first test takers for this year's Smarter Balanced summative administration.

01:25.032 --> 01:29.556
We had those brave 550 students take their first test on February 26.

01:31.037 --> 01:33.039
So they are in the system and they are testing.

01:33.679 --> 01:42.427
And since that time, we have about 10,000 students right now that have completed at least one of their Smarter Balanced summative tests.

01:42.487 --> 01:43.628
So that's fine.

01:43.688 --> 01:44.388
It's still early.

01:45.349 --> 01:49.192
It could be a balloon drop behind me.

01:49.232 --> 01:51.053
Just imagine it with this announcement.

01:51.834 --> 01:56.337
Our districts are doing their interim assessments.

01:56.417 --> 02:03.801
Yesterday, we just got news that we hit the $5 million mark for the number of interim assessments that were given this year.

02:04.742 --> 02:16.795
So, I had to modify my tacking points this morning because we were at, just yesterday I told Glenn that it was 4 million and now we have crossed the 5 million mark.

02:17.175 --> 02:25.524
So that's about 900,000 more administrations than what we had at this time last year.

02:27.005 --> 02:33.768
So, quite a bit of information there for our teachers to get from those interims.

02:33.788 --> 02:38.790
In terms of that, I'm happy to announce information on our Connections Playlist.

02:39.351 --> 02:46.714
So, I've talked about the Connections Playlist in many items and many information memorandums before this board.

02:46.854 --> 02:53.537
What's new this time in my announcement is that we have a Connections Playlist now for each of our interim assessments.

02:54.537 --> 02:59.781
So, what those connection playlists, I see a smile on member Rucker's face, that's good.

03:02.583 --> 03:07.727
So, the connections playlists were built by educators across our consortium member states.

03:08.327 --> 03:16.013
The teachers evaluated student results on the interims and then determined what skill students were working to solidify.

03:16.713 --> 03:27.223
And they use that information to come up with this connections playlist, which really is the link between our interim assessments and what is in our digital library.

03:29.008 --> 03:37.177
The teachers can use the playlist with student interim assessments to quickly pinpoint resources that support their instruction.

03:37.437 --> 03:46.467
Like I said, it is actually active links within those playlists that they can just click on to get to a specific resource in that digital library.

03:47.448 --> 03:58.658
One of the benefits of that is it reduces the need for our teachers to log into the digital library and search and know what they are looking for and have to put in search terms.

03:59.038 --> 04:08.046
This really simplifies the use of the digital library and we have heard great feedback and positive feedback on the connections playlist.

04:10.047 --> 04:16.769
Just recently, I had the opportunity to do a presentation with my colleague, Director Barbara Murchison.

04:16.869 --> 04:20.651
She's from the Educator Excellence and Equity Office.

04:23.952 --> 04:29.474
We were lucky to do a presentation at the CISC Symposium in lovely Monterey.

04:30.814 --> 04:31.895
That wasn't sarcasm.

04:31.975 --> 04:35.195
It was lovely, unlike some of the other places I get to go to.

04:37.896 --> 04:43.738
The presentation focused on these connections playlists and how they can be used to inform teaching.

04:44.478 --> 04:50.580
We did this by walking through a scenario or an example of how a teacher might use that.

04:51.360 --> 04:56.162
how that connections playlist can be used before instruction.

04:56.663 --> 05:09.328
There's information up there on the connections playlist about what, for example, students who score in the above standard area, what they are still needing to solidify.

05:09.729 --> 05:16.312
You can use that information along with other information to develop lesson plans or to develop student learning goals.

05:16.932 --> 05:19.514
prior to even starting your instruction on a unit.

05:20.174 --> 05:30.280
And then you can use that when you are progressing through that unit to check whether or not students have actually mastered what you have set forth as your learning goal.

05:30.740 --> 05:43.087
So when we talk about it like that, it really helps provide a scenario or an approach that you might use to connect these two different elements of our comprehensive assessment system.

05:43.668 --> 05:45.729
And so that was very well received.

05:46.289 --> 06:01.215
The other thing that was very important to us for Barbara and myself was to really model collaboration between two sides of the house, which is our assessment side of the house and our curriculum and instruction side of the house.

06:01.795 --> 06:06.297
And we were very deliberate in our presentation about talking about that.

06:07.097 --> 06:13.560
and talking about encouraging that same type of collaboration to occur locally in our districts.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.862
That was very deliberate.

06:17.902 --> 06:18.682
We spoke about it.

06:18.702 --> 06:19.923
We were very honest about it.

06:19.943 --> 06:22.484
This is the first time we have actually presented together.

06:24.805 --> 06:31.970
I'm not really that proud to say that, but we recognize that and we hope to do that more often throughout the state.

06:32.070 --> 06:39.015
I think it's a great lesson and a good thing for us to really champion in our state.

06:40.986 --> 06:49.032
I was a little nervous about doing a PowerPoint today after the last meeting, so I don't have one.

06:50.293 --> 06:57.658
If there are questions on the Connections playlist, I could pause and see if there are questions on that particular document.

07:03.444 --> 07:05.725
Well, I have both a question and a comment.

07:05.765 --> 07:07.105
I'll give the comment first.

07:07.565 --> 07:17.207
I had the opportunity in a different capacity at the invitation of Smarter Balanced to visit a meeting where the development of the playlist was done.

07:17.788 --> 07:23.329
And it was interesting to watch teachers from multiple states along with teachers from California

07:23.789 --> 07:31.236
who took basically a week out of their classroom to come to a hotel in Nevada, actually a surprisingly nice hotel in Reno, Nevada, by the way.

07:32.497 --> 07:35.740
In other words, I couldn't smell the smoke from the cigarette.

07:36.180 --> 07:47.891
And to spend time actually doing a very deep dive, not only into the assessment blueprints and student outcomes, but to really do an assessment or evaluation

07:48.411 --> 07:58.594
of the content in the digital library and to look at how the content has matured since the time the library actually started being under development.

07:58.894 --> 08:05.016
So getting a chance to sit in the room and listen to those conversations to talk about teaching and learning and using

08:05.396 --> 08:10.398
the interim assessments in their classroom and using these tools in the library was very interesting.

08:10.818 --> 08:20.762
But my question is concerning the development of the content in the digital library, this has become a kind of chicken and the egg conversation for me.

08:21.442 --> 08:25.404
What do you believe has driven the development of the content?

08:25.744 --> 08:28.685
In other words, how did the people who are working on that content

08:29.245 --> 08:44.549
make decisions about what type of information to create, because teachers were questioning the application or usability of some of the lesson plans and activities that were created, and how will that change going forward?

08:44.589 --> 08:57.653
Having watched what they did with this, how is that development going to, do you have any ideas on how that, I'm asking that because I know Tony's sitting there and he might be able to answer it instead, but how is that going to change going forward to continue improving the library itself?

08:58.544 --> 09:01.927
That is a great question because it does highlight one of the lessons learned.

09:03.328 --> 09:06.670
We have done two things.

09:06.890 --> 09:09.032
One, right now we are going to focus development.

09:09.152 --> 09:13.215
By having those meetings, we were able to identify gaps in the digital library.

09:13.736 --> 09:21.081
As we are trying to develop connections playlists associated with the interim and the digital library, we were able to identify gaps.

09:21.141 --> 09:23.283
Now we can focus development on those gaps.

09:23.903 --> 09:33.286
In the future, as we develop our interim assessments, it makes more sense to develop the connections playlist along with the development of that interim block.

09:33.407 --> 09:40.789
In the future, I believe we can do it in that direction, but for now, we have identified our need and we are doing the focus development.

09:44.591 --> 09:51.273
Just to mention, Tony Alpert is here, Executive Director of Smarter Balanced, so I will send the tough questions to him.

09:52.614 --> 09:54.835
Other board member questions on this.

09:55.455 --> 10:00.256
Can you describe a little bit more just for the audience what a playlist would look like?

10:01.417 --> 10:03.097
That's sort of a generic term.

10:05.258 --> 10:05.558
Sure.

10:05.698 --> 10:10.620
So imagine there might be an interim assessment on geometry.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.620
I'm going to throw out geometry as an example.

10:13.521 --> 10:17.142
And you would have a connections playlist that basically has two columns.

10:17.802 --> 10:25.729
The column on the left would be organized into three blocks, above standard, at or near standard, and then below standard.

10:26.470 --> 10:39.601
In each of those three blocks, it would describe skills that students are still working to solidify if they are scoring within that score area on that particular interim of geometry.

10:41.101 --> 10:57.971
But then on the right side are listed suggestions for digital library content, which are formative assessment resources that an educator might be interested in for students that are scoring at that particular score level on that specific interim.

10:59.852 --> 11:00.873
Does that help?

11:09.389 --> 11:11.290
Tony Alpert, Executive Director for Smarter Balanced.

11:11.350 --> 11:15.013
So Michelle did a great job describing the playlist.

11:15.353 --> 11:31.825
The other piece, though, that principally Michelle and her staff and educators in California have driven is taking that playlist, which is right now in the form of a PDF, and integrating it into the open source reporting system that California educators are using to look at those results.

11:32.565 --> 11:36.826
I think Michelle is going to talk more about the reporting system and the enhancements.

11:36.886 --> 11:42.148
What we did is we have now integrated the playlist directly into the reporting system.

11:42.568 --> 11:51.970
As teachers are looking at those interim results, they are able to look at this connection playlist and make a direct connection into the digital library.

11:53.011 --> 12:11.023
It's still in the form of a PDF, and so we're going to work on making that more flexible, so having it be machine-readable text so that it's more, they're not looking at the full PDF, they're looking maybe at an intermediary page that highlights the skills that they're looking at, and then they'll click on that.

12:12.324 --> 12:27.473
But the other piece that we added is we know that we can't describe all the resources that a district believes a teacher needs to have access to in light of the results of the interim assessment, so we're allowing districts to upload links to their resources.

12:28.193 --> 12:32.377
that they think teachers should look at based on results of the interim assessment.

12:32.437 --> 12:44.627
So then teachers have the benefit of resources identified by the consortium and resources identified by both the county office of education and the district or school as they see fit.

12:46.209 --> 12:56.936
And so what it really does is this becomes a resource that informs the other work that Smarter Balanced is doing to create an online teacher's workbook or resource guide.

12:57.296 --> 13:00.518
And this is just one iteration in that process that they're doing.

13:00.558 --> 13:07.683
They still have other elements and other projects across the country and work groups that are putting this interactive guide together.

13:08.043 --> 13:12.766
But this segment of that interactive guide that connects to work districts are doing locally

13:13.126 --> 13:27.578
has actually matured faster than the rest of the process of developing that teacher's guide, and that's related to work that President Kirst has allowed me to continue working with Smarter Balanced on, so that's the reason why I know a lot about this thing that's going on right now.

13:31.061 --> 13:40.429
So, yes, and Tony mentioned the new reporting system, which we plan on having some screenshots or demo for you at the next board meeting on the new reporting system.

13:41.880 --> 13:47.843
So the next resource that I wanted to highlight was a resource that we developed for IEP teams.

13:48.423 --> 14:07.972
We had heard a need that some IEP teams were finding it a little difficult to find the resources that they thought they needed to appropriately select the correct assessment for a student, as well as appropriately select the accessibility resource for that student.

14:08.432 --> 14:14.016
We do have many resources available to help make that decision, but they are in various places.

14:14.317 --> 14:24.144
We put together a flyer that provides links to all of the resources that we think an IEP team might find useful in making those particular decisions.

14:24.784 --> 14:41.961
We also have a great stakeholder group, and included in that stakeholder group is someone who represents our SELPAs, and so we also ask that they assist us in getting that information out to the appropriate staff within California.

14:43.325 --> 14:48.309
So there are many other resources under development.

14:49.930 --> 14:54.933
One of them, and so let me just talk about one of them because it has a little bit of a connection to that.

14:56.014 --> 14:59.196
And in a recent conversation that I had with CTA,

15:02.179 --> 15:18.679
I received some feedback that our educators are finding it difficult to read our connectors and what you might remember what is a connector that is what links the content on our alternate assessments with our content standards and they're finding that document a little

15:19.799 --> 15:21.821
How do I read that, and what can it be used for?

15:22.821 --> 15:28.504
We are putting together a document to help explain what might be useful from that document.

15:28.944 --> 15:32.326
How do we use it in assessment, and how might you use that locally?

15:32.846 --> 15:40.510
We are putting together a document to help our educators use a resource that we already have available on our website.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.931
That is in development right now.

15:42.892 --> 15:45.173
Hopefully, I will be reporting back to you shortly on that.

15:46.741 --> 15:50.123
So the next topic that I have for you is our primary language assessment.

15:50.543 --> 15:55.126
So this is the last year of our standards-based test in Spanish, our STS test.

15:55.686 --> 15:59.348
That is our current primary language assessment in California last year.

15:59.368 --> 16:07.633
We're happy to announce that the last administration of that assessment is via computer, and that's thanks to support from the Smarter Balanced Consortium.

16:07.653 --> 16:13.436
It's a nice transition to prepare our students, because our next test that's under development will be on a computer.

16:13.656 --> 16:14.777
So this is a nice transition.

16:16.838 --> 16:21.944
Our new primary language test is called the California Spanish Assessment, or the CSA.

16:22.465 --> 16:24.447
That replaces the STS.

16:25.388 --> 16:33.878
In order to accomplish that transition, we'll be conducting a field test in fall of 2018 to ensure that the test is ready in spring of 2019.

16:36.621 --> 16:55.296
We recognize that might not be the normal time of our field test, but we have quite a few tests happening at the same time, and we thought it was more appropriate to not have that occur so we could get a large enough sample in our field test for this optional assessment.

16:55.416 --> 16:59.019
Next, I have the California science test to give you an update on.

16:59.039 --> 17:00.801
I have a feeling you'll have some questions on this.

17:02.595 --> 17:14.360
We're on track with the development of our two science assessments, the California Science Test, or CAST, as well as the CAA for Science as our alternate science assessment.

17:15.160 --> 17:23.184
You might recall that the CAST is scheduled to go operational in 2018-19, and the CAA for Science the following year.

17:24.404 --> 17:32.790
I'm happy to announce, first of all, that the CAST Academies, which is our professional learning event, will occur in April.

17:34.090 --> 17:38.113
Thus far, we have 400 educators already registered for that.

17:38.653 --> 17:45.758
In fact, our Sacramento and Irvine locations, I believe, are full, so anyone who wants to travel to Fresno, you should go ahead and sign up quickly.

17:47.714 --> 17:54.458
We're doing a unique approach with this training in order to try and get more of our educators trained.

17:54.478 --> 17:55.858
So we're using a hybrid approach.

17:56.379 --> 18:03.322
We have some in-person trainings in those three locations, and we're also allowing virtual hubs to occur.

18:03.442 --> 18:04.803
So we'll have virtual hubs.

18:05.483 --> 18:07.526
well as in person.

18:07.566 --> 18:10.308
And so this is the first time that we've done it exactly like this.

18:10.889 --> 18:20.999
We'll see how this works and if it does it'll be a great way for us to expand on the number of educators that we can train with the limited resources that we have.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.703
This full-day academy covers four sessions.

18:25.743 --> 18:29.707
The goal is to help educators understand these new assessments.

18:30.208 --> 18:35.412
They include session one, which is the role of assessments and the various types of assessments.

18:36.233 --> 18:39.096
We do a review of the California NGSS.

18:39.696 --> 18:42.539
How you read that NGSS document will be in there.

18:42.559 --> 18:43.520
It's a little complex.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.843
It looks a lot different than you would our ELA and math content standards.

18:48.484 --> 18:52.785
We talk about the role of phenomena and the concept of multidimensionality.

18:53.585 --> 18:58.606
We talk about how you can experience the CAST training test items, where to go, how you might use them.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.567
We talk about the implications of the CAST item types.

19:02.967 --> 19:09.749
You may recall that we're doing both performance tests as well as standalone items, so we'll be talking about those.

19:10.349 --> 19:14.770
And then we'll be talking about the test design and how that has an impact on teaching and learning.

19:15.170 --> 19:17.411
So this gives us an opportunity to talk about how

19:18.391 --> 19:32.731
While we may have three assessments, we actually assess more standards than just those three grade levels might indicate, so it's an opportunity to talk about ensuring that science instruction is happening in all grades.

19:34.092 --> 19:40.995
We are happy to announce that it is West Ed under contract with ETS who is conducting these trainings for us.

19:42.075 --> 19:46.137
We held a workshop with stakeholders to get their feedback on the training.

19:46.337 --> 19:49.358
That was in early March, seems like so long ago.

19:49.958 --> 19:50.958
But that was early March.

19:51.518 --> 20:00.801
So I'd like to thank all of the organizations that were able to spend a full day with us to go over this training and provide us feedback so that we could make it better.

20:01.401 --> 20:15.185
So that was the Association of California School Administrators, the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association, the California Teachers Association, the California Science Teachers Association, the California Science Project,

20:15.848 --> 20:23.011
the K-12 Alliance, the Regional Assessment Network, the Small School District Association, the Making Sense of Science Project.

20:24.151 --> 20:28.232
So thank all of them for agreeing to spend a whole day with us.

20:29.173 --> 20:31.694
The content standards are new, the assessments are new.

20:32.034 --> 20:36.295
This was a great opportunity for them to come spend a day and give us feedback.

20:36.676 --> 20:38.076
And they did, they did not hold back.

20:39.116 --> 20:43.238
So we're going through and making those edits now so that we can prepare for the April

20:44.219 --> 20:45.720
launch of that event.

20:46.581 --> 21:02.295
We also will be doing, thanks to our contract with Sacramento County Office of Education, we want to ensure that our county offices have what they need in order for them to go forth and conduct similar trainings in their counties so that it doesn't just stop here.

21:02.796 --> 21:07.220
If there's a county or staff that couldn't get trained, we want the county offices to have what they need.

21:07.880 --> 21:13.864
So, Sacramento County will be doing a training of trainers, if you will, meant for county offices of education.

21:13.884 --> 21:15.965
That will be happening in the summer.

21:27.212 --> 21:29.433
The next thing is, just as a reminder,

21:30.899 --> 21:40.225
For our 17-18 administration, those are census administrations, which means all eligible students are expected to participate.

21:41.126 --> 21:48.230
So for this year, that is a field test for CAST, and it is the second pilot year for the CAA for Science.

21:48.971 --> 21:52.433
So let's talk a little bit about the CAA for Science for a moment.

21:53.433 --> 21:57.217
You may recall that we had an innovative test design.

21:57.437 --> 22:05.405
We are trying something for CAA for science that we've never tried before in California, and we're trying that on a very complicated set of standards.

22:05.465 --> 22:08.668
So I came forth and said, I need two years of pilot.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.871
And you all said, yes, you do.

22:12.592 --> 22:15.055
So thank you very much, because we do.

22:15.595 --> 22:20.180
So let me talk about the things that we learned from the first year's pilot that were changing in the second year's pilot.

22:20.560 --> 22:26.205
It's quite a long list, and it goes, I think, to show that we had good reason for asking for two years.

22:27.463 --> 22:33.307
So the reason why we changed, or the information that we got, was mostly via a survey.

22:33.507 --> 22:38.450
So we did have a survey after the pilot, but we also conduct focus groups quite often.

22:39.351 --> 22:45.635
If you see me having a training somewhere, I also usually have a small focus group during lunch.

22:45.735 --> 22:52.819
I keep people back, or ETS keeps people back, and if they're there, it's a great way, no cost way, to have focus groups, right?

22:52.899 --> 22:54.981
So we were able to do that also.

22:56.263 --> 23:03.231
So we're making a number of changes that we believe will positively impact students and our teachers for year two pilot.

23:04.032 --> 23:15.504
So the first thing we did was we decreased the item length and difficulty to reduce the complexity of the questions, but we did this while also maintaining alignment to the core content connectors.

23:16.425 --> 23:20.609
We decreased the number of items associated with most tasks.

23:20.789 --> 23:23.191
So remember, this is a task model approach.

23:23.752 --> 23:27.535
So we reduced the number of items that would be associated with each task.

23:28.315 --> 23:33.460
We simplified and streamlined the language that we used, made sure it was appropriate for the student population.

23:34.061 --> 23:36.663
We reduced the overall difficulty of that language.

23:38.689 --> 23:47.837
We added a student response check providing clear guidance in each task about the conditions under which testing should stop if a student doesn't respond.

23:48.458 --> 23:49.119
That was added.

23:50.540 --> 24:02.411
We eliminated the need for examiners to evaluate the student's lack of independence at multiple points throughout a task and instead have them only do that once per task.

24:04.631 --> 24:15.042
We redesigned the graphic interface of the embedded performance test so that they have more clear directions to our examiners who are administering this test.

24:17.096 --> 24:21.920
We were more thoughtful about the activities that we included in this year's performance task.

24:22.260 --> 24:32.429
And what I mean by that is we selected, for example, items that require fewer materials and were mindful of materials that would be readily available at a school site.

24:33.450 --> 24:35.452
So that was a lesson learned.

24:36.993 --> 24:42.297
If you're going to do a hands-on activity, we want that to include materials that are easy to find for our educators.

24:43.584 --> 24:49.290
We sought a balance between hands-on activities and graphic representations or short videos.

24:49.350 --> 24:55.636
We wanted to ensure that there were also other ways of getting the content besides just hands-on activities.

24:56.717 --> 25:02.222
We introduced a formal answer recording document that simplifies recording a student response.

25:03.463 --> 25:08.188
Those are all of the things that we're undertaking for year two pilots.

25:09.969 --> 25:30.802
We eventually will have this assessment more similar to CAA for ELA and math in terms of it being delivered on a computer and the answers actually being easily input on a computer, and we're transitioning to that over time when we get to the field test.

25:31.202 --> 25:34.504
So there will be more enhancements when we get to the field test.

25:34.524 --> 25:39.087
This is not the final list of enhancements that we'll need in order to get this right.

25:40.067 --> 25:44.769
I want to say I am grateful for the hardworking educators and the valuable feedback they gave us.

25:46.590 --> 25:52.393
Some of the administrations we heard were a bit of a challenge for the pilot year one, and they expressed that to us.

25:53.633 --> 26:04.058
We hope that the changes that we made have improved that, but also still have fidelity to the design that we all agreed on and that we want to undertake for this.

26:04.238 --> 26:07.920
We believe that we have a better balance in terms of that for this next pilot year.

26:09.942 --> 26:37.286
The other thing is I want to just mention that we believe that the changes that we made highlight our commitment to getting it right and our commitment to being honest and transparent about the things that we believe we need to improve and making those statements in a public meeting and agreeing that it's going to take some time to get this right and we're on the right road, but it will probably take until we get to the field test in terms of the lessons learned.

26:39.778 --> 26:42.619
I think we want to take questions here.

26:46.240 --> 27:01.545
I heard you say that as part of the administration of the assessment there is some kind of monitoring that the educator in the classroom is doing of the student to make a decision

27:02.725 --> 27:09.351
to stop the student from continuing on that item or that task.

27:10.072 --> 27:21.803
Is there objective criteria or guidance to teachers on how to make those intervention decisions or does that still remain more subjective at this point?

27:24.758 --> 27:33.164
There is always some degree of subjectivity in that kind of decision, but it is not about a student not getting the answers correct.

27:33.284 --> 27:36.066
It is about a student not being responsive.

27:36.187 --> 27:41.491
I believe that does provide a level of objectivity in terms of making that decision.

27:42.191 --> 27:44.333
We do have more guidance than we did before.

27:44.933 --> 27:56.598
Whether or not we need to increase that, we'll look again and have some more focus group and feedback on whether or not our educators felt like they had all the information they needed to make that decision.

27:56.918 --> 27:57.739
It isn't new.

27:59.559 --> 28:05.162
Our examiners make that same type of decision with CAA for ELA and math.

28:06.062 --> 28:23.635
And then for the manipulatives or the tools that students would use or interact with as part of the task, is there a difference in cost from among the tasks or is the cost of the equipment relatively the same for each of the tasks that have been developed?

28:25.052 --> 28:28.715
I have not looked at it from that perspective of cost.

28:29.616 --> 28:40.204
I believe that now that we have made them readily available, pencils, that type of thing, that I am not sure how much cost will play into that.

28:40.524 --> 28:44.107
But it is a question that we are happy to look at and see if there is.

28:44.827 --> 28:51.032
There were some particular samples last year that were very difficult and, honestly, probably

28:51.092 --> 29:00.596
probably had some expense to them because they weren't readily available, and I'm not sure that we're going to have that same type of issue in the coming year.

29:00.756 --> 29:02.757
But we're happy to look at it from that perspective.

29:05.358 --> 29:10.200
Can you talk a little bit about how we're going to satisfy the Federal?

29:10.360 --> 29:11.321
That's coming next.

29:13.522 --> 29:14.362
You read my mind.

29:15.523 --> 29:15.843
Pardon?

29:16.924 --> 29:17.785
Oh, Karen Valdez.

29:17.845 --> 29:18.305
KAREN VALDEZ.

29:19.766 --> 29:21.868
I just want to really thank you.

29:22.408 --> 29:24.730
I really feel like you are not reacting.

29:24.750 --> 29:31.475
You're responding and your inclusivity of all the stakeholders and simple things like the supply list for the administration.

29:31.495 --> 29:34.417
I remember in the Kappa days going through my house and finding things.

29:34.957 --> 29:38.560
And I think that that's really helping to make this test be the best it can be.

29:38.620 --> 29:42.143
So I appreciate what you're doing and the iterations that you're going through.

29:42.183 --> 29:43.924
So thank you.

29:50.487 --> 29:51.988
So, next topic.

29:52.648 --> 30:00.270
In order to meet federal law, we will be providing preliminary indicators using pre-operational science assessments.

30:00.951 --> 30:06.173
So, preliminary indicators, they're not scale scores, and they're not achievement levels, so let's start there.

30:06.293 --> 30:07.293
That is what they are not.

30:08.894 --> 30:18.457
They are percent correct, and they're also a general indication of the California NGSS understanding for a student.

30:20.000 --> 30:31.104
An LEA may use this information in conjunction with other information to get a broad and early understanding of where they are in terms of their NGSS implementation.

30:32.284 --> 30:42.188
ESSA requires, as well as IDEA, just want to add that, that these results be communicated with three audiences.

30:42.448 --> 30:47.590
And those three audiences are parents and students, LEAs, and the general public.

30:48.749 --> 30:53.311
California will be complying with this requirement as a condition of not double testing.

30:54.731 --> 30:59.113
Another way of saying that is California has not submitted a request for a waiver.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.694
We see no need to ask for a waiver.

31:02.714 --> 31:06.415
I believe that is exactly what I put in writing to them.

31:08.276 --> 31:13.038
That being said, we want to ensure that the various audiences appropriately interpret

31:13.934 --> 31:14.254
i.e.

31:14.394 --> 31:20.276
don't over-interpret the meaning of the preliminary indicators.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.637
We will not be placing that on a student score report.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.537
We believe that would send the wrong message.

31:25.958 --> 31:29.519
We will not be placing preliminary indicators in the California dashboard.

31:29.979 --> 31:34.461
That would again be sending the wrong message about what these preliminary indicators are.

31:35.921 --> 31:47.466
What we will be doing is assisting our schools and districts with communicating these preliminary indicators to that audience that they are responsible for communicating with, which are the parents and students.

31:48.246 --> 31:52.428
We're going to do that by providing a preliminary indicator communications toolkit.

31:52.828 --> 31:56.070
That toolkit is currently under development right now.

31:57.270 --> 32:03.113
It will include such things as a timeline, key messages that might be helpful when communicating,

32:04.383 --> 32:12.406
Frequently asked questions, we are collecting those now, and also an optional parent score report letter.

32:13.706 --> 32:21.489
The toolkit will communicate to our LEAs the discretion that they have in how they communicate results to parents.

32:24.421 --> 32:33.567
I will be utilizing two different groups to receive feedback on this communications toolkit before I send this out publicly to our districts in California.

32:34.288 --> 32:48.538
Those two groups are the Statewide Assessment Stakeholder Group, which I talk about all the time and I am so lucky to have, and they agree to meet with me every single month to provide me assistance, as well as our Regional Assessment Network, which our County Office of Education

32:50.699 --> 32:51.600
friends and colleagues.

32:52.220 --> 33:03.409
Those are the two groups that I will be using to gather input on that and I have a sense that there might be questions on the preliminary indicators.

33:05.631 --> 33:11.316
What discretion does the LEA have in terms of reporting to parents and students?

33:12.865 --> 33:14.666
I assured the U.S.

33:14.686 --> 33:27.076
Department of Education that I would notify our districts that they are to communicate with parents and students, and that I would provide them with information on how they might do that.

33:28.056 --> 33:38.620
For example, we will only give examples, we will not give an exhaustive list, but one example that we have heard might be useful is providing this information in a one-on-one meeting.

33:38.680 --> 33:53.506
So if you have scheduled parent-teacher conferences, that would allow you to have that conversation with a parent about where you are, where your school is, in terms of transitioning to the new standards at the same time that you are providing that assessment result.

33:54.267 --> 33:55.127
That is one option.

33:55.615 --> 34:03.098
We are providing a letter, so if districts feel like that is the best option for them to communicate with their parent community, they can do that.

34:03.699 --> 34:11.442
But we are also gathering other options that we can put in a non-exhaustive list of options.

34:14.723 --> 34:15.224
Other comments?

34:15.264 --> 34:16.124
Board Member Williams.

34:17.985 --> 34:22.587
What are the two groups that you're going to run the communications toolkit by?

34:23.277 --> 34:26.978
So the first group is the statewide assessment stakeholder group.

34:26.998 --> 34:35.359
So that includes many organizations, such as California PTA, CSTA, CTA, AXA, SELPA, AXI.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.480
I know I missed some.

34:39.660 --> 34:42.221
So the California Science Teachers Association.

34:42.261 --> 34:43.921
They have a representative on that group.

34:44.581 --> 34:52.163
All right, because I know they have a good feel for the pulse of what the science teachers and administrators are going to be concerned about.

34:52.643 --> 34:55.745
Yes, and they are great partners in the development of this test.

34:56.266 --> 35:00.048
What I didn't mention – I think I'm free to mention it.

35:01.930 --> 35:12.417
It's not solidified, but CSTA is so gracious to allow us – because I told them we're doing this CAST Academy.

35:12.457 --> 35:13.658
It's six hours of training.

35:13.678 --> 35:14.579
It's full-day training.

35:15.479 --> 35:25.787
They have a conference coming up later this year, so I believe that they are going to give us, CDE, six hours to hold another CASP Academy at their conference.

35:26.548 --> 35:33.253
That is just an example of what great partners they have been in the rollout of this test, so I am very grateful.

35:33.533 --> 35:39.678
Yes, they will be included as soon as we have a draft to send them, which hopefully is this week.

35:40.465 --> 35:43.769
Well, I appreciate your calling them great partners.

35:44.429 --> 35:56.641
They are, and of course they have a real vested interest in how all of this goes, and I'm sure they feel equally appreciative to you and the staff at CDE for doing a six-hour session at their conference.

35:56.661 --> 35:59.724
It will be a big help for their teachers, so it's a win-win.

36:00.925 --> 36:12.710
I just want to say that I really appreciate the way that you're handling this with regard to working on the negotiation with the federal ED.

36:14.070 --> 36:18.812
Everyone appreciates the fact that there was no double testing, which it looked like there was going to have to be.

36:19.532 --> 36:46.617
And I think, I feel really confident that when LEAs get their CAS scores, the way that you're handling them and what they are, that they will be able to communicate those effectively with parents and students in a way, I feel confident that they will choose to do it in a way that says, this indicates where we are in our implementation of NGSS.

36:47.188 --> 36:57.356
and I'm hoping that they also do it in a way with their teachers that says, okay, let's work together to see what else we need to be doing over the next year or two to get fully implemented.

36:57.796 --> 37:11.927
So I think it's going to be, while it might feel a little anxious for those first scores to come out, especially since we don't have instructional materials yet, so the schedule's kind of a little bit out of sync,

37:12.747 --> 37:20.874
But I think it could be turned around into a very beneficial thing in terms of motivating and informing the next round of implementation.

37:21.435 --> 37:22.756
And I appreciate your work on this.

37:23.657 --> 37:23.977
Thank you.

37:23.997 --> 37:27.240
Board Member Valdez.

37:28.132 --> 37:29.613
Just a quick clarification question.

37:29.653 --> 37:38.216
So I know that when it came out that there was going to be some kind of feedback to districts in terms of results, and so now it's percentages is what I heard you say.

37:38.616 --> 37:45.258
I think that helped a lot at the high school level to give it a little bit more importance, because there was a lot of just trying to plan, right?

37:45.358 --> 37:46.018
Who's taking it?

37:46.058 --> 37:50.220
I know it's supposed to be 12th graders, but there was some creative thinking in how to go about it.

37:52.141 --> 38:00.988
So as an LEA, I'm going to get results by individual students in some kind of a database, and then I'm going to merge them into some kind of a letter.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.289
Is that the idea behind it?

38:05.597 --> 38:10.421
The final details, we are still working out, but I believe it will be a data file.

38:10.441 --> 38:11.002
Do you know that?

38:11.142 --> 38:21.329
Whether or not it is a separate data file or combined with a data file that you already have, we are still in conversations about that specific detail, but yes, it will be a data file by student.

38:23.931 --> 38:26.753
California is responsible for the general public.

38:27.694 --> 38:33.898
So I do have to report to the general public by all the required federal subgroups that I normally have to report on.

38:34.419 --> 38:40.002
That being said, I don't want to give the impression that you can do more with this than you should.

38:40.563 --> 38:49.829
So we aren't going to do that via our splashy website with the bars and all of that, the colored website that you all know as our CAS reporting website.

38:50.269 --> 39:01.219
But we will provide a research file that has all the groups on it, so the reporting to the public will also be done via a data file, just like that is being done for you.

39:01.619 --> 39:09.126
I think that will also allow us to put the appropriate cautionary language right there where you would download that data file.

39:19.403 --> 39:20.363
So let's change gears again.

39:21.244 --> 39:32.309
So happy to announce that we have recently posted the assignment of accessibility resources for the 2017 Smarter Balanced Summative Test Administration.

39:32.949 --> 39:43.714
So this is a data file that we produce and we post that provides information about counts of students who were assigned accessibility resources.

39:44.654 --> 39:50.059
We saw growth in terms of the assignment of supports over the last three test administrations.

39:51.080 --> 39:55.965
We're happy to see that trend, but we don't believe that tells the whole story.

39:56.105 --> 40:06.295
Starting next year, we're going to start investigating reporting of student usage of the designated supports and accommodations.

40:07.416 --> 40:09.497
This is a monumental task.

40:11.278 --> 40:20.942
As you might imagine, or if you can imagine for a moment, a testing session and a student is sitting there with an item and one of these supports may be a pop-up glossary.

40:21.912 --> 40:28.795
and there are multiple words on that one item, maybe they select one word to use a pop-up glossary.

40:29.835 --> 40:33.437
Maybe they don't use any, and then they use a pop-up glossary for the next item.

40:34.257 --> 40:40.719
So how we actually analyze this data and provide that information is going to take some time.

40:41.540 --> 40:46.782
This is going to be a massive amount of information, almost data overload, if you will,

40:47.242 --> 40:56.365
But we do believe that it will give us a better picture of what's going on in terms of the usage of accessibility supports.

40:57.305 --> 40:59.326
We're never going to get the full picture.

40:59.786 --> 41:05.568
Unless someone was sitting behind every student and monitored what they did, it's never going to be complete.

41:05.948 --> 41:09.349
But this is going to be more of the pie, if you will.

41:11.390 --> 41:25.221
So, we're happy to announce that, but I also want to give us a little bit of caution that it's probably going to take some time, and it's going to take us some time after we get the data to really think about how we report this and what makes the most sense.

41:25.721 --> 41:32.547
Does a student clicking on a pop-up glossary once over an entire test administration mean they used a pop-up glossary?

41:33.147 --> 41:34.388
I don't know at this time.

41:35.048 --> 41:42.330
So that's the type of information that we're getting and the struggles that we will be having in interpreting it.

41:47.592 --> 41:53.454
What are some of your goals for your analysis of that data?

41:56.135 --> 42:00.397
Well, one of the things in terms of the assignment of resources,

42:01.610 --> 42:04.692
We keep seeing more and more resources assigned to students.

42:05.252 --> 42:11.676
I think it would be great to be able to provide LEAs some information on what students are actually using when they get on that test.

42:12.336 --> 42:15.638
Sometimes I think it's really easy to just click more and more.

42:16.258 --> 42:16.959
Yes, they need that.

42:17.019 --> 42:17.679
Yes, they need that.

42:17.719 --> 42:18.399
That would be helpful.

42:18.419 --> 42:19.120
That would be helpful.

42:19.640 --> 42:25.105
In reality, it may not be helpful, it may be overloaded, and it also may not be used.

42:25.785 --> 42:31.890
So I think that there's some learning that can come from this type of information that we're gathering.

42:32.691 --> 42:36.674
We also are talking about the future

42:37.234 --> 42:47.698
the next generation, if you will, of the professional development and the presentations that my division will be doing in collaboration with all my partners and all my contractors.

42:47.738 --> 42:54.120
And one of them happens to be really talking about accessibility supports throughout the year.

42:55.320 --> 43:02.502
identifying ways that they can not only use our products, but what other products are out there that we know they are using in the classroom.

43:03.303 --> 43:08.865
We know that we have Google Classrooms and we know that they're using Google products, for example, some schools.

43:09.345 --> 43:13.206
What are similarities between that and what they will see on the assessment?

43:13.786 --> 43:19.188
And maybe thinking about that when you have that long list of supports for Smarter Balanced,

43:20.089 --> 43:21.791
and you're making those choices for students.

43:21.851 --> 43:32.485
So that's the future of what we plan on presenting on and hoping to get to in terms of our next professional development type of events in the future and I think that information will help.

43:37.025 --> 43:38.006
So thank you.

43:38.987 --> 43:39.628
I would agree.

43:40.029 --> 43:45.596
I'm glad to hear that there's going to be some analysis of the accessibility tools and how they're being used, all that.

43:46.277 --> 43:51.665
The core piece or the basic piece is the training of the

43:52.185 --> 44:07.695
the administrators on what these tools mean, how they fit into the accommodations for the student, and I think that it provided great tools around that, but I think there's still a lot of professional development and communication and support.

44:08.635 --> 44:14.738
finding and really learning what those tools are and how they might meet individual student needs.

44:15.278 --> 44:24.503
So it's got to be that you're collecting the data on that end but there's still that training at the at the school level as well in the district level to make it all really work.

44:24.903 --> 44:28.725
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

44:29.965 --> 44:40.375
I'm really excited to hear that because I had actually asked, I think, two years ago to show me how ELs were accessing some of the supports.

44:40.976 --> 44:43.458
So that would be one group of students that we want to see.

44:43.778 --> 44:47.362
Do they have access to the resources, supports available to them?

44:48.022 --> 44:54.005
because these are manually assigned, correct, for the students before they take the assessment.

44:54.346 --> 45:00.169
So you would also have to, the teacher would have to know who their students are and tailor the supports for them.

45:00.929 --> 45:06.652
So we didn't know if teachers were actually doing that or if there was an understanding of who was before them.

45:07.032 --> 45:16.137
So that would be a great way, but again, I do think that it also needs to be part of the training so that everybody is aware of what's available to them and what's being used or not used.

45:16.701 --> 45:17.321
Thanks.

45:17.701 --> 45:19.622
And we have information now on assignment.

45:19.642 --> 45:29.947
So we do know whether or not they're assigning, for example, stacked translations, or whether or not they're assigning a pop-up glossary for students.

45:31.507 --> 45:33.648
But I think the second question is important.

45:34.308 --> 45:44.973
The other piece of that, in particular for our students who do not have an IEP, the process for selecting those supports

45:47.132 --> 45:49.754
districts have discretion on what kind of process they use for that.

45:50.595 --> 46:10.371
I think this also may provide some information at a district-by-district level that may be helpful for those as they're still, I think, struggling in some districts on what process to use and whether or not it is really just an individual teacher making that decision, whether or not they have formed committees that have conversations and make those choices.

46:12.612 --> 46:17.435
We always encourage those decisions to be made on an individual student basis.

46:18.376 --> 46:21.158
I do believe that that's not always the case for districts.

46:21.238 --> 46:34.747
They use information such as their SALT score and sometimes only just their SALT score and use that to determine what resources to provide.

46:34.787 --> 46:39.390
And so I think this is another piece of information that might show those that are using that

46:39.991 --> 46:41.475
That tool may not be helpful.

46:50.351 --> 46:55.034
So I know that there are some districts, so for example, these are all lessons learned, right?

46:55.074 --> 47:00.199
So the first year they turned on stack translations for all of their ELs and then it just slowed them down.

47:00.279 --> 47:08.766
So as you're looking at this analysis also, do the resources slow down the student or do they help the student?

47:08.846 --> 47:13.349
Is it too much on the page as they're looking at the item as well as the glossary?

47:13.429 --> 47:16.412
I mean, those are kinds of some considerations and I don't know how you'd measure that.

47:16.872 --> 47:23.576
But I think, is there an opportunity or some kind of a forum for districts to share their thinking about why they do some things?

47:23.596 --> 47:28.139
Because I know it's a local thing, but there are teacher by teacher decisions.

47:28.199 --> 47:30.601
But a lot of times at the district level, this is managed.

47:30.961 --> 47:34.903
And maybe it's with the regional assessment networks.

47:34.943 --> 47:40.867
But just the thinking about why they do, over time, have made different decisions and what has benefited them.

47:41.327 --> 47:45.631
and some of the efficiency for the students to be able to engage with the assessment.

47:45.671 --> 47:51.336
I'm just wondering, is that metacognition thinking about your thinking, but at a large level across districts?

47:51.976 --> 47:53.758
So, a couple things.

47:54.078 --> 48:03.927
One, I can easily send a question out to my regional assessment network about, you know, how have your processes changed in terms of making these assignments and what lessons have you learned?

48:07.759 --> 48:17.586
Since you brought up the other question, I believe I can announce this other project that we just agreed to do yesterday.

48:18.526 --> 48:26.471
Yesterday, I had a meeting with Californians Together about one of the topics that came up, which were the stack translations.

48:27.772 --> 48:31.454
and you asked, how do you gather that information?

48:31.534 --> 48:34.935
Well, the information that you're talking about you gather via cognitive lab.

48:35.436 --> 48:41.879
So you have someone sitting with a student who is asking them questions as they're interacting with the assessment.

48:42.359 --> 48:43.819
And in terms of stack translations,

48:45.100 --> 48:59.411
We have had some feedback that just the way it's displayed on the screen with the English and then the Spanish is just difficult, and they believe that students are having a hard time following which line to read.

49:01.532 --> 49:06.776
We have had that conversation in the past, and in the past we did believe that.

49:07.656 --> 49:14.481
In looking at the other options, the current option that we have is still the best option, but it is time to reevaluate that again.

49:15.421 --> 49:21.686
What we have agreed to do is come up with some different mock-ups and have a cognitive lab, hopefully later this summer.

49:22.526 --> 49:30.346
And so I know that California's Together is going to help me find some students to participate in that cognitive lab that Smarter Balanced is going to conduct for us.

49:33.893 --> 49:35.174
Maybe we don't even have to go to them.

49:36.135 --> 49:37.115
Tony, you have your students now.

49:37.356 --> 49:38.636
And I think that's perfect.

49:39.037 --> 49:47.982
And I also just really want to celebrate your intentional looking forward and trying to engage, because these things should be used all year long, right?

49:48.022 --> 49:52.885
So I think I really want to applaud the idea that you're trying to go out there and make sure they're happening with all of the vendors.

49:52.925 --> 49:53.666
So thank you.

49:56.781 --> 49:58.962
Do you have any other items for us?

49:59.182 --> 49:59.522
Yes.

49:59.882 --> 50:00.683
I know you have.

50:00.823 --> 50:01.203
I do.

50:01.223 --> 50:03.324
I know, I know.

50:03.344 --> 50:06.285
I was told I had all the time in the world.

50:06.305 --> 50:06.865
Okay.

50:08.641 --> 50:09.021
Not quite.

50:09.482 --> 50:14.006
Let's move on to peer review and give you a little bit of update there.

50:14.746 --> 50:22.092
In June 2016, you might recall that we submitted our peer review evidence for our Smarter Balanced assessment.

50:22.293 --> 50:30.019
The purpose of that is to document the validity, reliability, and fairness of our assessment system with the U.S.

50:30.039 --> 50:31.000
Department of Education.

50:31.460 --> 50:36.004
The outcome of that submission, you might recall, was substantially meets the requirement,

50:37.747 --> 50:41.194
stellar first peer review finding.

50:42.888 --> 50:44.429
As part of that, though, the U.S.

50:44.449 --> 50:50.572
Department of Education did request additional evidence, and so the Smarter Balance did submit that additional evidence in December of 2017.

50:53.193 --> 51:01.278
Also in December, California submitted its peer review evidence for the California Alternate Assessments for English Language Arts and Mathematics.

51:01.818 --> 51:07.261
I believe we submitted over 100 different pieces of evidence for that particular peer review.

51:08.021 --> 51:13.482
And we should hear back on both of those, the additional evidence that Smarter sent, as well as our alternate assessments.

51:13.602 --> 51:17.243
We hope to hear back in summer of this year on those results.

51:20.264 --> 51:30.546
And finally, I'd like to report some preliminary information about the additional analysis that Smarter Balance was conducting in relationship to the 2016 versus the 2017 scores.

51:34.755 --> 51:49.875
So in consultation with the consortium members as well as the Smarter Balanced Technical Advisory Committee, the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium went through a series of analyses to test some hypotheses related to assertions that were made about the release of last year's scores.

51:51.038 --> 51:58.243
The analyses investigated seven research questions, and I'm going to go through the preliminary information.

51:58.383 --> 52:13.034
The report is not yet final, and it will be delivered to us either later this month or early April, in time for us to provide you that report in an April information memorandum, but I did want to give you some preliminary information.

52:13.455 --> 52:16.477
So I'm going to go through each of the questions and brief information.

52:17.436 --> 52:21.200
The first was, did students perform better or worse compared to the previous year?

52:21.901 --> 52:26.445
Essentially, the 2016 and 2017 average scale scores were the same.

52:27.466 --> 52:29.588
Were there fewer test questions available?

52:30.729 --> 52:30.949
No.

52:31.570 --> 52:39.678
The 2017 bank included virtually all of the 2016 items, plus a large number of new items that were developed.

52:41.607 --> 52:43.387
Were the new test questions more difficult?

52:43.907 --> 52:45.888
No, the new test questions were not more difficult.

52:46.628 --> 52:50.089
Did the newly added test questions negatively impact test results?

52:50.609 --> 52:52.889
There were no substantial differences that were found.

52:54.030 --> 52:56.250
Did students spend less time taking the test?

52:56.930 --> 53:00.231
No, actually the students spent more time in 2017.

53:00.811 --> 53:05.252
They spent about 11 minutes more in ELA, about 10 minutes more in math.

53:06.411 --> 53:08.852
Did students take the test earlier in the school year?

53:09.672 --> 53:11.532
No, the time was essentially the same.

53:12.812 --> 53:14.333
Did student demographics change?

53:15.053 --> 53:22.815
There were slight differences found, but they seem to be more related to how students were classified versus true demographic changes.

53:23.315 --> 53:27.235
An example is less students classified as unknown race in 2016 versus 2017.

53:30.455 --> 53:45.783
So the Smarter Balanced Technical Advisory Committee agreed that the analyses conducted to investigate the research questions were thorough and did not uncover any technical errors associated with the newly added items or with any component of the 2017 administration.

53:46.884 --> 53:55.769
The analyses conducted by Smarter Balanced was also independently reviewed by the National Center for Improving Educational Assessment.

53:57.023 --> 54:03.849
Smarter Balanced is finalizing that report, like I said, so these are preliminary, and I will be sending the report in the information memorandum.

54:04.410 --> 54:12.277
But in summary, we anticipate that this report will confirm the appropriateness of comparing the 2016 and 2017 Smarter Balanced test results.

54:14.759 --> 54:15.820
Any questions on that?

54:16.621 --> 54:17.482
Board Member Strauss.

54:18.396 --> 54:25.585
So, Michelle, I really appreciate your thorough presentation and your demeanor and presenting it and the continued work you do.

54:25.606 --> 54:34.177
The question on the analysis that you just talked about, those were the initial and we'd had a meeting with you all about what further validation we were going to do to

54:35.398 --> 54:40.045
to support or look at the issue of reliability.

54:40.385 --> 54:51.000
Are there any more studies or analysis or I thought we were talking about maybe independent review that might extend the validation and deepen this discussion?

54:55.233 --> 54:57.935
Hello, Tony Alpert, Executive Director of Smyrna Balance.

54:59.076 --> 55:06.943
So we do conduct a whole series of additional analyses as part of our annual technical report.

55:07.083 --> 55:13.968
And for those of you that have the pleasure to look at it, it's something on the order of 500, 600 pages or some such.

55:14.068 --> 55:16.390
So that is part of our annual process.

55:16.510 --> 55:19.513
On top of that, we added this special additional analysis

55:20.253 --> 55:27.757
to address the specific concerns that you as the board have or part of the board have expressed.

55:28.437 --> 55:34.341
And so this is on top of what is otherwise our best practice.

55:35.241 --> 55:40.844
The additional analysis we contracted with the National Center for Improving Educational Assessment

55:41.244 --> 55:57.640
They're looking at all of our analytical questions, our process for testing them, our results, and they're determining whether or not they can affirm both our analytical process as comprehensive and our conclusions based on the data that we're looking at.

55:59.423 --> 56:02.146
What's the timing for that follow-up analysis?

56:02.407 --> 56:05.030
So tomorrow, I think we should get that.

56:06.131 --> 56:07.532
So they've been working in parallel.

56:07.873 --> 56:15.221
When we presented, we started this discussion with our technical advisory committee and our members back in fall.

56:16.382 --> 56:25.990
And I think as you're aware, we don't get the data from states until after they've certified it as part of their accountability systems.

56:26.070 --> 56:28.052
And as you know, that takes a long time.

56:28.112 --> 56:34.217
So by January, we had a full data set upon which we could start conducting our analyses.

56:35.077 --> 56:41.602
So in October, we talked conceptually with our technical advisory committee about the analyses that we might engage in.

56:42.023 --> 56:49.228
Then once we had the data, we started producing some initial results to discuss with our TAC.

56:49.868 --> 56:52.650
And then they, of course, had suggestions for changes.

56:53.490 --> 57:06.257
So in the meantime, we had a contract with the center, and then they had to adjust their strategy and their timeline based on the revised request from our technical advisory committee.

57:06.277 --> 57:10.980
So it's all shifted a little bit later than we might have hoped, but we're working as quickly as we can.

57:13.301 --> 57:14.802
Any further questions on that?

57:17.183 --> 57:18.364
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

57:19.617 --> 57:21.958
So, questions for Michelle.

57:22.038 --> 57:30.863
And I know that you cover the digital library and I know that that's resources that could help us go from the flat and take up a little bit.

57:31.304 --> 57:44.011
But what are you, the CD, doing to help and support LEAs and for the supports to trickle down so that we see a difference, hopefully an increase, next year?

57:44.031 --> 57:47.112
Now I feel the weight of the world on me.

57:52.122 --> 58:04.070
What we, the department, do to help improve academic performance is, of course, not solely related to assessment, nor solely related to the digital library.

58:04.090 --> 58:14.878
I am sure that someone from Tom Adams' shop would be happy to come present on the various professional learning activities and resources that they provide to support

58:16.158 --> 58:43.915
In terms of what I provide, really I've already presented on those and I'm happy to, I was talking to Patricia DeCoste this morning, I think it would be a perfect opportunity for us to come at the next board meeting and bring a district person who is using some of these resources and report out to you how they think they, whether or not they think they're being useful and will lead to improved academic success.

58:46.092 --> 58:49.436
also bring a teacher, that would be great to hear directly from someone.

58:49.516 --> 58:50.076
I sure can.

58:50.697 --> 58:50.957
Please.

58:50.997 --> 58:51.698
That request.

58:51.978 --> 59:01.569
Yes, because I know I was talking to my husband about some of the resources he's using and one of his colleagues accidentally like set the actual, administered the assessment.

59:01.689 --> 59:02.089
Oh, yeah.

59:02.970 --> 59:07.292
And she was confused and it showed that the window opened before it had to open.

59:07.632 --> 59:14.296
So there's still a lot of confusion, a lot of need for training at the school site level on how to use these resources.

59:14.616 --> 59:17.918
So it would be great to hear from those that are actually using the resources.

59:18.278 --> 59:19.679
Sure, I'm happy to do that.

59:19.719 --> 59:21.059
We'll find someone to come present.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.421
And we're always looking for

59:24.261 --> 59:29.084
districts that are doing innovative things with our resources, and we highlight those.

59:29.124 --> 59:30.485
We have a series called C.A.S.P.

59:30.645 --> 59:39.851
in Action, and we highlight different districts that are trying out different things, and sometimes they're successful, and sometimes, frankly, they're not.

59:39.871 --> 59:42.793
They report back on, we tried this, and this didn't work.

59:43.473 --> 59:46.095
In fact, Member Sung had her

59:46.855 --> 59:57.238
Her charter school was actually in one of the more recent CASP in action, and they reported back on how they used the practice and training tests with their students and with their parent population.

59:57.258 --> 01:00:05.000
And there was feedback from the teachers on what worked about that and what might they do differently in the future when they took on that activity.

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.421
And so those are the type of things that we're always looking for.

01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:12.142
But I think it's time to bring forth the district again and do a presentation.

01:00:13.663 --> 01:00:14.423
Board Member Roker.

01:00:16.434 --> 01:00:19.057
I've been trying to figure out when to ask this question.

01:00:19.097 --> 01:00:33.134
So since we're on the topic of resources, another important resource that has been developed both by Smarter Balanced and that the department has been using and providing support on is on the accessibility tools and the guidance.

01:00:33.935 --> 01:00:56.293
And in looking at the report, at least the information that's been provided to us so far about the access or use of accessibility tools, my concern remains that it seems very low, given the number of students who A, take the alternative assessment, or the number of districts that have a numerically significant subgroup of students with disabilities.

01:00:56.733 --> 01:01:20.215
So I want to understand with all of the assessment practices and interim assessments that are being done, is there any guidance being given to districts to encourage them to use the accessibility tools even as they're using the practice test and the interim assessments because I don't see where that use has actually improved given the number of students that have been identified with disabilities or taking the alternative assessments.

01:01:20.913 --> 01:01:24.956
So we are seeing increases in the assignment of resources.

01:01:25.337 --> 01:01:26.618
So that is occurring.

01:01:27.899 --> 01:01:28.539
Is it enough?

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:33.963
And is it the right resource, I think, is really an important question.

01:01:36.005 --> 01:01:37.807
Probably not in all cases, right?

01:01:38.547 --> 01:01:53.451
So we do provide information quite often, particularly related to the interims and the practice and training tests, and iterate many times about how one usage of that is actually trying out these supports.

01:01:54.212 --> 01:01:56.892
That is a message that is constant from us.

01:01:57.853 --> 01:02:01.734
We do a webinar annually about resources.

01:02:03.655 --> 01:02:10.560
I feel like we do communicate quite often, but with the state our size, it obviously is not trickling down in all cases.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:22.129
We recently started engaging in activity to locate all of the conferences that might be occurring in and around our state.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:31.535
We are putting special emphasis on locating conferences where we can reach educators of students with disabilities.

01:02:31.555 --> 01:02:35.157
That is something that we are particularly focusing on this year.

01:02:35.177 --> 01:02:39.020
I believe we have one or two conferences that we think we're going to hit.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:45.204
We also do present at the SELPA meeting, but maybe we need to do that again.

01:02:45.825 --> 01:02:57.914
The reason why I wanted to ask the question is I still get emails from teachers across the state saying that their district is under the impression that using the accessibility tools means there's only one way

01:02:58.354 --> 01:03:03.118
that the test will be identified and it's automatically that the student is not proficient.

01:03:03.158 --> 01:03:22.974
It doesn't matter that the Smarter Balanced Guide says explicitly in several areas of the guidance, including right on the front page, that that is not the case, but many teachers are being told when they ask about accessibility tools for their students that their districts tell them no because students will be identified as not proficient if they use any of them.

01:03:23.474 --> 01:03:28.260
We're happy to put that particular message out yet again in our weekly update.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:33.105
Also, just to point out, our weekly update is not limited to just district staff.

01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:37.811
Any educator in California can sign up and get the information directly from the department.

01:03:38.251 --> 01:03:40.973
so that they are not relying on that type of information.

01:03:41.773 --> 01:03:48.038
Also, we use our weekly upload date to highlight specific resources within our digital library.

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:52.421
We do that quite frequently, so it is a great resource for them to get directly.

01:03:52.601 --> 01:04:00.847
Maybe we need to reach out to CTA and CFT and see if they can help us get the word out that that might be something that their members would be interested in joining.

01:04:03.419 --> 01:04:09.064
So one additional resource that we offer is we call it a crosswalk with instructional practices.

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:18.692
So we try to describe the accessibility resources that are on the Smarter Balanced assessment and the equivalent resources that a teacher might use in the classroom.

01:04:18.732 --> 01:04:29.402
So for instance, the text-to-speech, they might have support on the Smarter Balanced assessment, they might have an instructional assistant in the classroom who reads aloud to the student.

01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:39.110
So trying to make that connection so they tie their practice that they use every day to the resources that are in the summative assessment to try and make that connection more clear for them.

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.973
And it sounds like perhaps we have to highlight that a little bit more as well.

01:04:43.453 --> 01:04:45.695
Thank you.

01:04:48.517 --> 01:04:52.039
So, I just wanted to say thank you as well, Michelle, for coming.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.982
We always like to get updates and appreciate your presentation, and thanks to Tony for being here.

01:04:57.963 --> 01:05:00.344
Thanks for trying to be all things to all people.

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:12.111
I'm actually struck by the conversations as we have these around CAS by the stark difference between this assessment system and the California standards test.

01:05:12.831 --> 01:05:24.742
and just to have people roll back the tape a little bit to how we got here and how much we have invested in improving teaching and learning as an outgrowth of our assessment system.

01:05:24.782 --> 01:05:26.743
I think we lose that a little bit.

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:36.392
The one thing I wanted to go back to, though, and I apologize for missing the boat on this, was when you talked about the reporting of the preliminary indicators for science,

01:05:37.152 --> 01:05:53.704
Just to revisit the topic of not making a big hoop-dee-doo about test results separate from all the other indicators that are in the dashboard, and I know you're still trying to figure out how you're going to actually report them, but I would encourage, as we're sort of thinking about

01:05:54.945 --> 01:06:10.872
when we roll out the various metrics in our accountability system, that we make sure that test results are appropriately part of that rollout as opposed to a separate be-all, end-all that we've made them in the past.

01:06:12.616 --> 01:06:16.457
I think we have some things that we can address in there.

01:06:16.857 --> 01:06:23.379
We do specifically talk about not looking at these preliminary indicators as a standalone piece of information.

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:30.340
So maybe we also focus and specifically direct them to places that do offer multiple measures like the dashboard.

01:06:30.781 --> 01:06:36.022
So we could be a little more direct in that, in the FAQs that we provide.

01:06:36.562 --> 01:06:44.387
Yeah, I think we heard yesterday from the CSTA, they wanted to have a placeholder and member Williams talked about this as well.

01:06:44.447 --> 01:06:53.072
So I think just kind of laying the groundwork a little bit to this is what it's going to look like when it's fully fleshed out and validated and all of that.

01:06:53.432 --> 01:06:59.456
But again, just reinforcing, because I feel like a lot of the anxiousness that people have about CASP

01:07:00.177 --> 01:07:04.918
is still, it's the muscle memory of, it's everything that we've got is this test.

01:07:05.338 --> 01:07:06.019
And it's not.

01:07:06.259 --> 01:07:07.759
I mean, it's very important information.

01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:12.520
As I said earlier, it's a really great tool for improving teaching and learning.

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:19.502
But I think it would be great to just continue down this path of there's lots of other things that are important.

01:07:21.832 --> 01:07:28.759
None of this discussion has touched on my biggest concern, which is, and maybe we can do this next time.

01:07:28.779 --> 01:07:32.662
I don't want to open it, you know, have a presentation this time.

01:07:32.702 --> 01:07:36.106
And that is the appalling lack of knowledge by the general public.

01:07:36.813 --> 01:07:48.477
not educators, of what Smarter Balanced is and how it differs from the old test, from college admissions tests, and even its basic properties.

01:07:49.838 --> 01:08:00.902
I speak a lot with audiences, rotary clubs, that kind of thing, and they have no idea that this is a computer-adaptive test

01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:06.984
that it has open response, that a performance exam is different from a writing exam.

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:25.312
Education advocacy groups continue to say we don't get results back to school districts to the fall, confusing the fact that the turnaround is two weeks and they talk to reporters about it and we get criticism for slow reporting to districts.

01:08:26.372 --> 01:08:39.161
So we may be communicating better with educators, but the general awareness of the unique characteristics in what we're doing, I think, in the general public is very weak.

01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:45.125
And I know Smarter Balanced is trying to do something about it, and next time I think we ought to talk.

01:08:45.325 --> 01:08:48.888
I have some presentation on that when you come back.

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:51.269
I mean, you know,

01:08:52.574 --> 01:09:01.119
When I tell people that the SAT is a paper and pencil test, ours is computer adapted for each individual, they don't have open response.

01:09:01.219 --> 01:09:02.539
It's a closed system.

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.282
They use a traditional writing example.

01:09:07.382 --> 01:09:09.163
We use a performance exam.

01:09:10.544 --> 01:09:15.907
We give feedback on detailed things that are different from what they do.

01:09:16.987 --> 01:09:24.839
We are extremely vulnerable in defending this assessment in the public policy area.

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:32.630
There needs to be more focus on the inside baseball within educators

01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:39.720
But we are losing the battle in the external awareness of the assessment, and they still think it's CST.

01:09:41.803 --> 01:09:47.812
The only test the general public has ever seen is a closed-end moldable choice bubble-in test.

01:09:48.473 --> 01:09:55.975
and then they see our announcement on what the scores are in September or whenever it comes out and assume there's this huge delay.

01:09:56.875 --> 01:10:03.837
So I think also the educational professional groups could do more about this in some ways in disseminating it.

01:10:03.957 --> 01:10:08.779
So this is my biggest concern and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:17.881
So we're very susceptible to disinformation and misinformation about this exam and assessment.

01:10:18.283 --> 01:10:21.925
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, thank you for those comments.

01:10:23.865 --> 01:10:26.486
I think you're on point.

01:10:27.147 --> 01:10:40.852
The people I talk to outside of the education community have very little knowledge about our assessment and where we're going in general beyond just assessment, to take Member Burr's comments and context.

01:10:41.612 --> 01:10:42.033
as well.

01:10:42.934 --> 01:10:51.561
I just wanted to say that I think this takes a communication plan that goes beyond our assessment division.

01:10:52.362 --> 01:11:07.855
So this is something that I'll discuss with Chief Deputy Glenn Price as well as take it back to the Executive Committee of Smarter Balance because I'm sure that the same thing is true in other states as well.

01:11:10.106 --> 01:11:13.149
Okay, I think we're ready for public comment on this item.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:19.294
We have two public commenters, Doug McRae and Martha Zaragoza-Diaz.

01:11:28.724 --> 01:11:29.124
Good morning.

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:31.786
I'm Doug McRae, retired testing publisher for Monterey.

01:11:33.147 --> 01:11:40.811
Since your January meeting, Smarter Balanced has acknowledged a large change in 2017 operational item bank compared to 2016.

01:11:41.591 --> 01:11:53.658
They've not addressed whether or not the 2017 scores had adjustments to reflect changes in difficulty for 2017 operational bank by grade, by content area.

01:11:54.919 --> 01:12:01.786
The little information I received says that there were changes by grade, by content area, in difficulty.

01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:12.157
These things, no adjustments or incorrect adjustments, could be the cause for 2017 scores to drop like a stone.

01:12:13.358 --> 01:12:14.999
Still need for more transparency.

01:12:15.619 --> 01:12:18.441
This problem affects 14 states and 5 million students.

01:12:18.961 --> 01:12:21.403
Finally, we need a credible independent evaluation.

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.645
I have great confidence in the Center for Assessment.

01:12:25.126 --> 01:12:35.993
However, I understand the lead person on this was a former co-chair of the Smarter Balanced Committee, and that strains the independence of it.

01:12:36.974 --> 01:12:40.836
Additional CASP issues are addressed in material in your electronic folder.

01:12:41.477 --> 01:12:41.757
Thank you.

01:12:46.482 --> 01:12:48.882
Good morning Dr. Kirsten, board members.

01:12:48.942 --> 01:12:55.504
My name is Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and I'm representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

01:12:56.104 --> 01:13:11.686
First, I'd like to say that we're very pleased with the projects that will be undertaken with regards to obtaining data specific to supports used by students taking the CSTs and also with regards to the stacked translations.

01:13:11.786 --> 01:13:15.347
We think that this is very important for students.

01:13:16.447 --> 01:13:22.474
We also would like to thank staff on the work done so far with regards to the California Spanish assessment.

01:13:22.975 --> 01:13:33.807
However, we do believe that the CSA can be strengthened by including a writing component similar to what is provided by the English language arts assessment.

01:13:34.287 --> 01:13:38.289
Currently the CSA only assesses writing mechanics.

01:13:38.809 --> 01:13:48.854
We believe that in order to assess the writing abilities of students taking the CSA that they should have a writing component within the CSA.

01:13:49.715 --> 01:13:50.916
Staff is aware of this.

01:13:50.976 --> 01:13:57.359
We've had our discussions but we would encourage the board to include this in order to move this issue along.

01:13:57.599 --> 01:13:57.899
Thank you.

01:14:06.394 --> 01:14:13.038
Good morning President Kirst, Deputy Price, members of the board, Jessica Sacco representing California Science Teachers Association.

01:14:13.058 --> 01:14:24.786
I haven't signed up because we don't have an ask but given that we were mentioned I thought it was appropriate for me to return the thanks and appreciation for the department for their very deliberate

01:14:25.406 --> 01:14:32.212
and inclusive approach as they work to develop the CAST and the alternate assessment as well as the board for their comments today.

01:14:32.572 --> 01:14:36.795
CSJ is proud to partner as well and we're very grateful for all of your support for science.

01:14:37.196 --> 01:14:37.536
Thank you.

01:14:38.997 --> 01:14:41.599
And yes, we did offer a CAST Academy at the conference.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:42.800
So, yeah.

01:14:44.902 --> 01:14:49.666
Okay, this is not an action item so there's no board resolution needed.

01:14:50.767 --> 01:14:50.947
Yeah.

01:14:52.941 --> 01:15:00.984
Michelle, can you respond to the consideration of the writing portion of the California Spanish assessment?

01:15:01.624 --> 01:15:02.365
Sure.

01:15:03.086 --> 01:15:10.514
So I have met with Martha and Californians together on several occasions on their requests.

01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:15.379
It is correct that the Spanish assessment measures writing mechanics.

01:15:15.459 --> 01:15:17.041
That is what the blueprint measures.

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:22.247
It does not have, if you will, an extended writing prompt.

01:15:24.209 --> 01:15:33.157
We have agreed to come up with a cost estimate for what it would cost to add that and provide that to Californians together.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:42.006
We don't have the resources to add that type of item to the test.

01:15:42.066 --> 01:15:43.007
I'm a testing person.

01:15:43.307 --> 01:15:45.209
I'm happy to add all kinds of things.

01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:49.652
You know, from a policy perspective, we do need to look at testing time.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:53.395
In this case, it's optional, so maybe that isn't as much of a concern.

01:15:54.396 --> 01:15:55.897
But we are getting our cost estimate.

01:15:55.917 --> 01:16:00.300
I got some information this week that I'm confirming and we'll be providing that to them by next week.

01:16:03.442 --> 01:16:09.767
Okay, we're now ready for item nine, which is the English Language Proficiency Assessment for California.

01:16:10.888 --> 01:16:13.370
And Michelle will present that as well.

01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:14.212
Yes.

01:16:15.255 --> 01:16:19.529
So unlike the last item, item 9 is an action item before you.

01:16:20.825 --> 01:16:29.629
The CDE asked the board to approve revisions to the test blueprints for the initial English language proficiency assessments for California, or LPAC.

01:16:30.829 --> 01:16:33.350
As a reminder, the LPAC has two separate tests.

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:42.954
It has an initial assessment for the identification of English learners that goes operational in July, and our summative becomes operational this year.

01:16:43.054 --> 01:16:45.195
That testing is going on now through May.

01:16:46.089 --> 01:16:50.233
The SB approved the original blueprints for the initial in November of 2015.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:58.141
A test blueprint details the number of items and points by task, type, and content standard.

01:16:58.862 --> 01:17:06.610
The CDE is now recommending revisions based on both stakeholder input as well as the field test results.

01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:18.681
The proposed revisions to the test blueprint for the initial LPAC are similar to those that I brought for you in September of 2017 for the summative LPAC blueprint.

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:25.847
Revisions address administration considerations which resulted in the elimination of some task types.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.883
Revisions also ensure appropriate rigor.

01:17:31.124 --> 01:17:39.691
For example, changes to ensure that the appropriate number of items were included for various task types to address the full continuum of performance were made.

01:17:41.033 --> 01:17:51.242
Lastly, revisions were done to address the performance of task types, for example, realignment of some task types and the elimination of other task types.

01:17:52.836 --> 01:17:58.318
Lastly, we are proposing the use of a single initial assessment for grades 9 through 12.

01:17:59.598 --> 01:18:09.382
The reason for this proposed change to the blueprint is because the 2012 English language development standards at grades 9 and 10 and at 11 and 12 are very similar.

01:18:09.402 --> 01:18:17.284
Therefore, a single test administered once in a student's school career can satisfy the intended use of the initial assessment.

01:18:18.205 --> 01:18:21.926
Remember, the initial is used to identify students as English learners.

01:18:23.274 --> 01:18:43.644
The revisions offer the final benefit, reduction in test materials that LEAs need to order, handle, and store securely from year to year, reduction in training for test examiners, both in the state-sponsored training as well as local training events, and potential reduction in the number of testing sessions that staff need to complete for grade-level groupings.

01:18:44.824 --> 01:18:57.989
The proposed changes have been vetted with our LPAC technical advisory group, the California Association for Bilingual Education, Californians Together, and California educators during the initial standard setting in February.

01:18:58.490 --> 01:19:01.631
The responses to that change were positive.

01:19:03.103 --> 01:19:06.925
The next step, the CDE will provide an information memorandum.

01:19:07.425 --> 01:19:09.126
This changes completely.

01:19:10.047 --> 01:19:11.708
What is the next step in terms of LPAC?

01:19:12.448 --> 01:19:19.072
We are going to provide you an information memorandum that details the preliminary threshold scores for the initial LPAC.

01:19:19.832 --> 01:19:23.415
Those threshold scores will be coming to you in May for approval.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:44.406
So it's a great opportunity right now to thank member Ortez-Lacon, who was so nice to come and spend a full day at our initial standard setting event so that she could witness and observe the process that ETS, our contractor, was conducting to establish those threshold scores.

01:19:44.886 --> 01:19:52.408
So I want to say thank you, and I need to make sure that I include those kind of invites to my liaisons whenever they arise.

01:19:54.341 --> 01:19:58.330
So are there any questions on the action before you?

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:01.538
Board member Holiday.

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:23.404
Although the standards may be quite similar between 9, 10, 11, and 12 in grades, the need for a student to become much more sophisticated in her use of language in the 11th and 12th grade compared to 9th grade freshmen, there's a pretty wide gap there.

01:20:24.605 --> 01:20:26.267
Did you take that sort of

01:20:27.148 --> 01:20:33.242
Idea in in to your thinking about having only one initial assessment

01:20:35.031 --> 01:20:46.137
That was considered while there is of course continued learning and sophistication that is occurring with a student's English language development and their English skills throughout high school.

01:20:47.397 --> 01:21:00.764
It was the opinion of the experts that we consulted that in terms of whether or not you need to be classified as an English learner to provide appropriate supports that was consistent across the high school grades.

01:21:02.386 --> 01:21:02.926
One more, sorry.

01:21:03.146 --> 01:21:19.820
Did you also think about having a single test but that there would be an additional group of questions or additional tasks beyond what you might give to the 9th, 10th, or the 11th grader or the 9th or 10th grader?

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.904
I mean, not two tests as much as just an expanded.

01:21:23.964 --> 01:21:26.486
An augmented test as well.

01:21:26.826 --> 01:21:27.687
That was not considered.

01:21:31.169 --> 01:21:31.970
Any other questions?

01:21:33.310 --> 01:21:37.152
Board Member Sung.

01:21:37.773 --> 01:21:45.797
Not so much, I think, but I think for the identification initially, it doesn't seem like there's much of a difference at all in that.

01:21:46.678 --> 01:21:53.321
So I will move this item and approve the staff recommendation.

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:53.701
What's that?

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:02.358
Is it, there's a motion we can discuss it.

01:22:02.478 --> 01:22:03.999
Oh I thought this was assessment.

01:22:11.745 --> 01:22:12.346
Okay.

01:22:13.547 --> 01:22:14.748
We have a motion right?

01:22:14.808 --> 01:22:17.570
I have a motion for staff recommendation.

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:20.993
Is there a second?

01:22:21.793 --> 01:22:22.134
Second.

01:22:22.694 --> 01:22:26.097
Okay let's have public comment on the motion then.

01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:30.358
on the whole item, I'm sorry, yeah.

01:22:31.538 --> 01:22:33.939
Doug McRae and Martha Zaragoza-Diaz.

01:22:42.102 --> 01:22:45.163
Good morning again, I'm Doug McRae, retired test publisher for Monterey.

01:22:46.084 --> 01:22:56.228
Both the LPAC summative and the LPAC initial test development sequence have involved revised blueprints after completion of field test exercises.

01:22:57.128 --> 01:23:05.797
This unusual occurrence typically calls for a new field test exercise based upon the revised blueprints and delay of operational testing for a year.

01:23:06.678 --> 01:23:12.704
I'd ask why is the CDE staff ignoring this major flaw in test development sequence for the LPAC test?

01:23:14.045 --> 01:23:23.969
has major impact on validity and reliability of LPAC summative scores now being produced, and will have major impact on validity and reliability of LPAC initial scores.

01:23:24.469 --> 01:23:28.791
I'd note the standard setting threshold study was done without any data whatsoever.

01:23:28.811 --> 01:23:37.014
It was a data-free exercise, which for a test to be used for accountability is not a good idea.

01:23:37.754 --> 01:23:38.034
Thank you.

01:23:43.536 --> 01:23:51.479
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together and we've reviewed this item.

01:23:51.859 --> 01:23:58.842
We've had people take a look at it and we recommend moving forward and we support the staff recommendation.

01:23:59.122 --> 01:23:59.442
Thank you.

01:23:59.462 --> 01:24:03.984
Okay there's no further discussion on this item.

01:24:04.284 --> 01:24:05.465
All in favor raise your hands.

01:24:05.485 --> 01:24:07.705
Okay that is carried.

01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:09.206
The CDE recommendation is

01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:17.263
So we're now on to item 10, the California Education for a Global Economy Initiative.

01:24:33.991 --> 01:24:34.491
Good morning.

01:24:34.531 --> 01:24:37.214
Would you like to take a stretch break?

01:24:41.197 --> 01:24:45.820
Good morning, President Kurz, Chief Deputy Glenn Price, and esteemed members of the board.

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:58.450
I'm Veronica Aguilar, Director of the English Learner Support Division, and I'm here to provide an update on the rulemaking process for the California Education for a Global Economy, or California EDGE Initiative, also known as Proposition 58.

01:24:59.671 --> 01:25:07.815
The proposed regulations are intended to provide clarity, interaction to local education agencies for the purpose of complying with the provisions of California EDGE initiative.

01:25:08.235 --> 01:25:20.340
The regulations are designed to guide local education agencies and school sites towards a process that incorporates parents and stakeholders into the process of establishing language acquisition programs to the extent possible.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:29.298
As you may recall, over 70% of California voters approved Proposition 58 on November 8th of 2016.

01:25:29.418 --> 01:25:33.422
The amended statutes became effective July 1st of 2017.

01:25:34.923 --> 01:25:44.052
During the July meeting, the State Board of Education approved the commencement of the rulemaking process and opened a 45-day comment period for members of the public to provide public comment.

01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:52.901
After reviewing analysis of the public comment, the California Department of Education revised the proposed regulations and responded to the comments received.

01:25:53.301 --> 01:26:00.128
The State Board of Education approved the proposed revisions to the regulations on November 8th of 2017.

01:26:00.648 --> 01:26:05.613
The California Department of Education circulated the proposed regulations for 15 day public comment period.

01:26:06.747 --> 01:26:14.433
And the department accepted two recommended proposed changes from the public and made two minor technical changes.

01:26:15.373 --> 01:26:20.317
The changes are denoted in the proposed regulations as double underlined in attachment two.

01:26:21.058 --> 01:26:27.943
The summary of the public comment received in the California Department of Education responses is provided in attachment four.

01:26:30.512 --> 01:26:47.118
Based on the public comments received, the two key revisions are to Section 11301, Community Engagement, Section A. As you can see in this slide, the proposed text is added in double underline, while the deleted text is displayed in double strikethrough.

01:26:47.419 --> 01:26:50.300
The words, if applicable, are stricken and replaced

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:53.664
by if such a body is required by law.

01:26:54.064 --> 01:27:06.362
This modification is necessary to clarify that pursuant to California Education Code 52063, a district with less than 50 English learners is not required to have an English Parent Advisory Committee.

01:27:08.874 --> 01:27:14.996
So, similarly, this modification applies to Section 11301C, as you can see on this slide.

01:27:15.336 --> 01:27:22.878
The other two minor modifications not displayed on this slide was a change to the, to an A, and the, to an N, just for clarity.

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:31.681
In addition, the Economic and Fiscal Impact Statement was amended, as well as the Fiscal Statement of Reason, which is your attachment three.

01:27:32.321 --> 01:27:35.222
These are the documents that delay hearing this item in January.

01:27:35.942 --> 01:27:40.906
Both documents now include a statement that I'm going to read to you verbatim.

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:58.941
To the extent the commission on state mandates determines that any of the requirements in these regulations exceed the requirements of or are not necessary and constitute a reimbursable mandate, a state will be required to provide the general fund resources to fund the required activities.

01:28:00.421 --> 01:28:08.666
Now, the California Department of Education continues to affirm that the regulations are submitted to the state board today, as submitted to the state board today.

01:28:09.346 --> 01:28:12.028
As in previous presentations, do not impose any cost.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:17.331
This provision is more of a safeguard for any potential unforeseen cost.

01:28:20.945 --> 01:28:23.928
The next steps and timelines are presented on this slide.

01:28:24.308 --> 01:28:32.215
Upon approval of the commencement of the 15-day public comment period, members of the public may submit their comments to the email listed on the slide.

01:28:33.336 --> 01:28:38.220
This will allow the public to provide input on the amendments to the proposed regulations.

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:45.666
The public may comment on the amendments, and as I mentioned before, those are the ones with double underlying and double strikethrough.

01:28:45.966 --> 01:28:48.288
These are the only sections open to public comment.

01:28:49.469 --> 01:28:57.641
All public comments that are received will be reviewed and taken into consideration during the revision of the proposed regulations.

01:28:58.502 --> 01:29:05.772
If substantive amendments are made, then the proposed regulations would come back to the State Board in May.

01:29:09.447 --> 01:29:18.630
If there are no revisions to the proposed regulations after the 15-day comment period, the State Board of Education considers the proposed regulations adopted.

01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:20.231
That is what we are recommending.

01:29:20.911 --> 01:29:25.352
Upon adoption, the regulations would then be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law.

01:29:25.712 --> 01:29:29.894
The regulations would become final after their review and approval.

01:29:31.294 --> 01:29:36.135
Additional information regarding this initiative is available on the California Department of Education.

01:29:36.735 --> 01:29:49.898
And as a courtesy to the public, and since 80% of all English learners in California are Spanish speakers, the regulations presented to you today are also posted in Spanish on the California EDGE Initiative webpage.

01:29:50.438 --> 01:29:53.979
It is anticipated that the regulations will become effective July 1st of 2018.

01:29:54.059 --> 01:29:56.199
Thank you.

01:29:56.219 --> 01:29:58.460
Okay.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:58.960
You have more?

01:30:01.405 --> 01:30:04.027
I wanted to just give you the implementation plan.

01:30:05.809 --> 01:30:22.442
Once the regulations are adopted, an implementation plan has been developed and delineated in this slide, beginning with including the information and proposed English learning roadmap trainings that are planned in the summer, north, central, and south, as well as webinars in both English and Spanish.

01:30:22.802 --> 01:30:26.064
Of course, we're going to also try for the top five languages.

01:30:26.765 --> 01:30:27.786
We'll contract that out.

01:30:28.526 --> 01:30:31.887
bilingual coordinators network and other conferences.

01:30:31.947 --> 01:30:48.591
We are very fortunate that we do have the support of various institutions and they're all listed here, which is really a tribute to why this proposition passed and also to the California English Learner Roadmap.

01:30:49.284 --> 01:31:14.161
The CDE requests the following action of the State Board to approve the commencement of the 15-day comment period, designated a formal public comment period so members of the public may provide comments on the proposed amendments, and if there's no substantive amendments after the 15-day comment period, then the proposed regulations adopted by the State Board, and direct the California Department of Education to submit the regulations to the Office of Administrative Law.

01:31:14.841 --> 01:31:35.236
Before opening it up for questions, I would like to thank individuals in various offices that were instrumental in keeping the regulations moving, but particularly the joint collaboration between Judy Saez, Amy Holloway, and our Chief Deputy, Michelle Summa, because they really were instrumental in getting the item here.

01:31:36.357 --> 01:31:38.498
Okay, thank you for that board member discussion.

01:31:38.798 --> 01:31:39.479
Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:31:40.865 --> 01:31:42.645
Thank you, Veronica, for the presentation.

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:50.868
And I just want to point out that this really could have been in consent because there's only two minor changes to the wording.

01:31:51.208 --> 01:31:52.368
But we pulled it.

01:31:52.388 --> 01:31:53.709
It was pulled from January.

01:31:53.769 --> 01:32:03.211
So in full transparency, we wanted to give it an opportunity for the public to be aware of where we're at and also to notify the public that there is a 15 day common period.

01:32:04.011 --> 01:32:05.172
But thank you for the presentation.

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:06.012
Thank you.

01:32:07.068 --> 01:32:08.249
Any other board discussion?

01:32:09.771 --> 01:32:11.453
If not, we're ready for public comment.

01:32:15.637 --> 01:32:21.143
We have two public commenters, Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and Michael Flores-Castaneda.

01:32:22.998 --> 01:32:23.498
Good morning.

01:32:23.778 --> 01:32:29.361
Martha Zaragoza-Diaz representing California Association for Bilingual Education and Californians Together.

01:32:31.162 --> 01:32:34.904
We support the recommendation to go ahead and approve the regulations.

01:32:35.744 --> 01:32:38.346
We are very pleased that a lot of work has gone into

01:32:41.187 --> 01:32:42.668
Developing these regulations.

01:32:42.768 --> 01:32:44.370
We've provided quite a few comments.

01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:52.136
We've we see that they've been incorporated at least the majority of them and The field is waiting for these regulations.

01:32:52.256 --> 01:32:54.698
And so We recommend support.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:55.099
Thank you

01:32:59.008 --> 01:33:02.329
Good morning, Michael Flores Castaneda on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:11.651
When this came up in January, we presented a letter to the board requesting that the time to respond to parents be changed from 90 to 45 days.

01:33:11.811 --> 01:33:18.813
It had been changed to 60 days and we're requesting once again on behalf of our Language Acquisition Committee from CTA that it be changed to 45 days.

01:33:18.853 --> 01:33:20.474
We still feel that 60 days is too long.

01:33:20.914 --> 01:33:24.895
It's the third of the school year to respond to parents on what type of programs could be offered.

01:33:25.095 --> 01:33:25.315
Thank you.

01:33:27.731 --> 01:33:29.392
Okay do I have a motion on this?

01:33:35.795 --> 01:33:38.156
Motion to move the department's recommendation.

01:33:40.497 --> 01:33:41.818
Okay been moved and seconded.

01:33:41.938 --> 01:33:43.639
All in favor raise your hands.

01:33:44.659 --> 01:33:49.661
Okay that passes and we're going to take then a break before we take up the waivers and let's come back at 10 15.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:34:00.589
Waiver 4 through 8 and waivers 10 through 15.

01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:06.613
I would move approval of the recommendations for the actions on the waivers enumerated.

01:34:06.633 --> 01:34:08.113
Second.

01:34:09.054 --> 01:34:11.675
Are there any comment public comments on those waivers?

01:34:13.636 --> 01:34:15.897
Hearing none, all in favor.

01:34:17.538 --> 01:34:18.859
Sheila Whitley and

01:34:25.467 --> 01:34:27.908
Is there anybody in the audience that wants to speak on these waivers?

01:34:29.509 --> 01:34:31.490
Okay, if not, let's raise our hands.

01:34:33.050 --> 01:34:34.311
Okay, that's done.

01:34:34.391 --> 01:34:45.756
We have now three that we want to hear and we'll take those in order of numerics and so let's have a presentation on waiver one.

01:34:46.396 --> 01:34:53.219
This is the Hanford Joint Union High School District Community Day Schools.

01:34:54.674 --> 01:34:57.635
Good morning, President Kirsten, Chief Deputy Price, members.

01:34:58.115 --> 01:35:01.557
I'm Gordon Jackson, Director of the Coordinated Student Support Division.

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:07.959
I'm here today to seek approval for a waiver request from Hanford Joint Union High School District.

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:19.384
And now then, I've got some information associated to share with you and then the recommended approval with four conditions.

01:35:20.219 --> 01:35:40.395
Hanford Joint Union High School District, now that King's County Office of Education, as of May of 2017, is no longer providing an educational setting for expelled students, is currently providing educational placements for all expelled students who live in the district's boundaries at Hanford Community Day School.

01:35:41.376 --> 01:35:48.722
The district is concerned about the safety of students and staff, considering the status of some of these expelled students.

01:35:49.342 --> 01:36:00.413
and is requesting to waive portions of California Education Code Section 48663A relating to community day school minimum instructional minutes.

01:36:01.594 --> 01:36:10.663
The district is requesting to have the option of offering an independent study placement for those students for whom the district has safety concerns.

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:23.052
Under normal circumstances, independent study pursuant to California Education Code 48663A may not be utilized to provide any part of minimum instructional day.

01:36:24.593 --> 01:36:36.080
By virtue of this waiver, it is to be understood that the minimum school day pursuant to this California Education Code is to be met for all students, regardless of the instructional setting.

01:36:36.701 --> 01:36:37.882
Thus, the 360-minute day still applies.

01:36:41.884 --> 01:37:08.049
This waiver, for which we are only recommending approval for the period of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018, is also necessary to allow sufficient time for the Hanford Joint Union High School District to develop a comprehensive educational program for expelled students, including both classroom-based and independent study programs as appropriate for their students.

01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:15.231
So, the CDE recommends approval of this waiver, but with these four conditions.

01:37:16.032 --> 01:37:32.558
One, all of the provisions included in California Education and Code Sections 51-745 through 51-749.6 regarding independent studies shall be in place for Hanford CDS students who choose an independent study option.

01:37:33.358 --> 01:37:48.617
Secondly, the Hanford Union High School District will develop and provide a comprehensive classroom-based educational program for Hanford CDS students who do not choose an independent study program.

01:37:48.957 --> 01:37:49.758
It is their option.

01:37:51.365 --> 01:38:05.794
Three, the Hanford Union High School District will develop and submit a transition plan to the CDE, which includes the aforementioned comprehensive educational program for expelled students for the 2018-2019 school year.

01:38:06.795 --> 01:38:14.640
And lastly, this waiver shall be approved for the period of July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.

01:38:16.801 --> 01:38:20.904
I submit this as a recommendation for approval of this waiver.

01:38:22.483 --> 01:38:25.411
OK, is the board member comments on this item?

01:38:27.356 --> 01:38:29.000
If not, is there any public comment?

01:38:32.497 --> 01:38:44.045
So this is, Gordon, is not a typical waiver that we see in front of us and obviously independent study for kids that are already having serious concerns keeps them out.

01:38:45.166 --> 01:38:50.169
Do they have any required, don't they have a minimum required at least contact time with the school?

01:38:51.110 --> 01:38:55.573
And is there, this is a very short waiver, my understanding it's only till June.

01:38:56.033 --> 01:38:57.694
So just would you clarify the specifics.

01:38:57.714 --> 01:39:01.317
So this is an odd where you would normally not want them out of school when

01:39:02.998 --> 01:39:04.380
They're the most struggling students.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:05.501
Precisely.

01:39:05.521 --> 01:39:11.066
I mean, one would readily say that this is not the ideal situation for a student who's been expelled.

01:39:12.968 --> 01:39:19.395
And I know that Hanford is reacting to this new expectation on their part since the county stepped away.

01:39:20.295 --> 01:39:23.716
and is looking for a way to pull together a program.

01:39:23.736 --> 01:39:25.717
So it is exceptional.

01:39:26.817 --> 01:39:28.998
We're pleased that it's for a short duration.

01:39:29.638 --> 01:39:36.600
And I would concur, I think anyone, that this is perhaps not the ideal placement for an expelled student.

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:44.583
So we're gonna be very much looking forward to this comprehensive report where they explain in detail what they'll do differently for expelled students.

01:39:46.864 --> 01:39:47.704
Board Member Valdez.

01:39:50.552 --> 01:39:52.694
Would this include any special ed students?

01:39:57.359 --> 01:40:04.846
As far as I know it doesn't this time around and it wouldn't be appropriate for a student with an IEP.

01:40:05.927 --> 01:40:09.450
It would have to be, this is Judy Sias, it would have to be consistent with their IEP.

01:40:12.253 --> 01:40:12.993
Any other questions?

01:40:14.054 --> 01:40:15.756
Is there any public comment on this item?

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.241
All those in favor, we have a motion.

01:40:22.321 --> 01:40:26.503
I'll move a motion to approve this waiver with the conditions.

01:40:29.424 --> 01:40:29.944
I'll second.

01:40:30.204 --> 01:40:32.525
Okay, all those in favor, raise your hand.

01:40:33.965 --> 01:40:45.269
Okay, that approves and now we're on to W3, Waiver 3, Lincoln Unified School District Non-Instructional Certificated Employees.

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:57.034
Morning, President Kirst, Chief Deputy Superintendent Price, board members, I'm Barbara Murchison, Director of the Educator Excellence and Equity Division, presenting Waiver 3.

01:40:57.454 --> 01:41:04.537
In this waiver, Lincoln Unified School District is seeking to waive Education Code Section 44663B.

01:41:05.257 --> 01:41:14.741
This section of code requires that the written evaluation for certificated non-instructional employees employed on a 12-month basis be provided to the employee no later than June 30th,

01:41:15.801 --> 01:41:44.761
Then a meeting between the certificated employee and the evaluator to discuss the evaluation be held before July 30th Lincoln unified would like to move these evaluation dates from June 30th and July 30th as defined in Education Code to an unspecified date after the California assessment of student performance and progress CASP test results are made public but before September 30th The district would like to use this information in the evaluations of non-instructional certificated employees

01:41:46.281 --> 01:41:53.766
The department is recommending a denial of this waiver under California Education Code Section 33051A4.

01:41:54.326 --> 01:41:57.047
Pupil or school personnel protections are jeopardized.

01:41:57.828 --> 01:42:01.710
The CASP assessment system is not designed for use in personnel evaluations.

01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:11.456
California standardized tests do not include the required sample amount of questions to be sensitive to classroom instruction or to evaluate non-instructional employees.

01:42:12.236 --> 01:42:23.483
The use of CASP data in an employee evaluation could jeopardize school personnel protections, those of the certificated non-instructional employee, if that evaluation contributed to the employee's dismissal.

01:42:25.126 --> 01:42:38.301
In 2011, the board approved a similar waiver for Lincoln Unified with the condition that the standardized testing and reporting star test data not be used by the district as a basis for any adverse personnel actions.

01:42:39.001 --> 01:42:41.845
The term of that waiver was from May 1st, 2011 through September 30th, 2011.

01:42:45.356 --> 01:42:51.621
When the previous waiver was approved in 2011, California was using a completely different assessment system.

01:42:52.201 --> 01:42:55.944
STAR ended in 2013 and was replaced by CASP.

01:42:56.665 --> 01:43:02.829
With CASP, the district does not have to wait for the public report to have access to its test scores and summary reports.

01:43:03.790 --> 01:43:16.856
Final CASP aggregate results are not reported to the public until August, but computer-based assessment results are available to LEAs two to three weeks after the student has completed all components of the assessment for the content area.

01:43:17.837 --> 01:43:23.660
Individual student scores and preliminary summary reports are available in the CASP online reporting system.

01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:32.804
Coordinators have access to preliminary test results and summary reports in the online reporting system for the district and all the schools within the district.

01:43:34.355 --> 01:43:45.505
In short, if a district feels very strongly about using student summative assessment data in their evaluations, much of that data is available to them much sooner under CASP than with STAR.

01:43:46.166 --> 01:44:00.359
Lincoln Unified typically opens their testing window in late February and closes it on June 1st, and if their testing goes well and according to plan, their reporting should be completed by mid-June, which would allow them to use

01:44:00.859 --> 01:44:06.843
this information as part of the evaluation system consistent with the timelines laid out in Ed Code.

01:44:08.264 --> 01:44:14.368
The waiver request is supported by the local board, the California School Employees Association, and the district's community council.

01:44:14.888 --> 01:44:23.614
The local teacher bargaining group, which does not represent the certificated non-instructional employees, has adopted a neutral position in this matter.

01:44:24.575 --> 01:44:26.756
So that's the information I have for you.

01:44:26.816 --> 01:44:30.419
Again, the department is recommending denial of this waiver request.

01:44:31.279 --> 01:44:35.280
If you have questions or I'm not certain that Lincoln is here today.

01:44:36.541 --> 01:44:38.782
Board member discussion on this side.

01:44:38.802 --> 01:44:44.864
All right.

01:44:45.204 --> 01:44:46.464
Is there any public comment?

01:44:48.745 --> 01:44:49.325
Sheila Whitley.

01:44:56.513 --> 01:44:56.973
Good morning.

01:44:56.993 --> 01:45:00.076
Sheila Whitley representing California Teachers Association.

01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:10.466
We assume this request is referring to the evaluation of administrators or possibly teachers on special assignment that are serving in management positions.

01:45:11.386 --> 01:45:15.130
The California Teachers Association is strongly opposed to any attempt

01:45:15.650 --> 01:45:19.614
to tie test results to the evaluation of teachers.

01:45:20.234 --> 01:45:28.001
So we certainly don't condone this attempt to tie non-instructional certificated evaluations to test scores either.

01:45:28.441 --> 01:45:34.347
CASP was not designed for this kind of usage and we ask for the board to deny the request.

01:45:35.327 --> 01:45:35.668
Thank you.

01:45:35.688 --> 01:45:40.272
Board Member Strauss.

01:45:41.473 --> 01:45:42.813
Barbara, thank you for presenting this.

01:45:42.913 --> 01:45:44.334
I have a quick question.

01:45:44.674 --> 01:45:55.856
You made it clear that the rationale for the waiver request is that they need the test results, but the test results do come back, so in a timely manner.

01:45:56.016 --> 01:46:03.437
Not that we're supporting the use of that for evaluation, but I'm just wondering why they submitted it knowing that the results come in in a timely manner.

01:46:04.038 --> 01:46:06.178
Did you follow up with them, or is this a procedural?

01:46:06.678 --> 01:46:13.107
Yeah, we spoke with representatives of the district and they felt like they wanted to move forward with this waiver.

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:14.889
I can't really explain why.

01:46:14.909 --> 01:46:20.196
Board member Rocker.

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:42.018
Well, I originally wasn't going to comment on the waiver, but this, because it's hard to have a conversation about this waiver and the use of the assessments without going back to the comment that President Kirst made earlier about the lack of understanding about the assessment system and about the way the assessments operate.

01:46:42.538 --> 01:47:04.003
This waiver suggests, again, portends about the idea of a delay in receiving test scores in a timely way or in an efficient way that just is not supported by the way the assessment system works on not only processing student scores, but also on giving districts back the information in a very quick, very early and timely way.

01:47:04.503 --> 01:47:16.910
If this waiver was approved, it would actually support the idea of delaying this reporting until these other scores come out much later in the year than what's actually available currently under the current reporting system.

01:47:16.970 --> 01:47:29.737
So denying the waiver is not a statement by the board about whether or not the board thinks the district is using the score reports and the CASP system in an appropriate way, but more importantly,

01:47:30.177 --> 01:47:42.145
denying the waiver holds the district accountable for using their own score reporting and the information that they get back far sooner than the timeline that they're purporting that they want approved in this waiver.

01:47:45.367 --> 01:47:48.249
Okay, ready for a motion?

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:53.752
I would move the recommendation to deny this waiver.

01:47:53.772 --> 01:47:55.594
Second.

01:47:57.862 --> 01:47:59.002
Second by Member Burr.

01:47:59.243 --> 01:48:00.003
All those in favor?

01:48:00.023 --> 01:48:04.184
Okay, now we're on to Waiver 9.

01:48:04.444 --> 01:48:12.607
This is a request by Pasadena Unified District concerning sale or lease of surplus property.

01:48:14.588 --> 01:48:18.769
Morning President Kirst, Chief Deputy Price, Board Members, my name is Juan Mireles.

01:48:19.269 --> 01:48:23.071
I'm the Director of the School Facilities and Transportation Services Division here at CDE.

01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:27.232
Also with me here today is Mr. Andrew Nave who supervises the review of waivers.

01:48:28.072 --> 01:48:31.173
Waiver 9 is a request by the Pasadena Unified School District.

01:48:31.733 --> 01:48:41.076
The district would like to lease approximately 20,000 square feet out of a total of 40,000 square feet from the school site formerly known as Burbank Elementary School.

01:48:41.776 --> 01:48:48.617
The school was closed in 2011 and part of the campus is currently being used for special education classrooms and offices.

01:48:49.418 --> 01:48:55.679
The district would like to waive several sections of the education code that would require them to go through a sealed bid process.

01:48:56.259 --> 01:48:58.339
It would also require them to select the highest bidder.

01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:10.222
Instead, the district would like to go and use a request for proposals process that would give them greater flexibility in securing the most favorable lease for the district and the community.

01:49:11.042 --> 01:49:21.045
This will allow the district to use other factors aside from cost as in the highest bidder in selecting a tenant that's also compatible with the current operations at the site.

01:49:22.566 --> 01:49:29.168
Both the United Teachers of Pasadena and the California Teachers Association have submitted written opposition to this waiver.

01:49:29.688 --> 01:49:33.529
They would prefer that the district sell or lease the site to the highest bidder.

01:49:34.429 --> 01:49:40.654
The board has previously approved all requests to waive the same sections of the Education Code.

01:49:41.795 --> 01:49:46.139
Therefore, staff is once again recommending that the board approve this waiver with conditions.

01:49:46.999 --> 01:49:51.843
And those conditions are that the acceptance of the proposal be made within 60 days of accepting them.

01:49:53.024 --> 01:49:59.369
and that the reasons for the acceptance be discussed in a public session and that they be included in the minutes for that meeting.

01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:02.391
With that, we'd be happy to answer any questions.

01:50:03.392 --> 01:50:04.292
Board member comments?

01:50:07.354 --> 01:50:08.475
Yeah, I have one.

01:50:08.575 --> 01:50:16.361
I think us getting into the details of how local districts handle these kinds of decisions is really micromanagement.

01:50:16.481 --> 01:50:21.885
I don't feel confident at all that I know what they ought to do, so I support the waiver.

01:50:23.513 --> 01:50:24.938
Are there any public comment on this?

01:50:26.223 --> 01:50:28.250
Sheila Whitley and Fermin Villegas.

01:50:36.656 --> 01:50:52.348
Speaking for California Teachers Association, there were several things that were kind of mentioned here, but what we are really objecting to is that is the portion where they want to waive accepting the bid from the highest bidder.

01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:55.971
We feel like that we should be protecting the taxpayer here.

01:50:56.651 --> 01:51:09.784
and that other policies and procedures that are in place in the regulations for disposing of surplus property protects the district if someone inappropriate were to be the ones applying.

01:51:10.405 --> 01:51:10.705
Thank you.

01:51:16.892 --> 01:51:18.873
Good morning, President Kirst and members of the board.

01:51:19.394 --> 01:51:25.438
Fermin Villegas here from Atkinson-Andelson, Lawyer Ruden-Romo, speaking on behalf of the Pasadena Unified School District.

01:51:27.239 --> 01:51:39.387
We would simply address CTA's comment there that the RFP process that is being requested would not necessarily lead to the highest bidder not being accepted.

01:51:40.327 --> 01:51:52.552
That process would allow the district to negotiate with the bidders that proposed so that it can get the best benefit for all students involved.

01:51:53.112 --> 01:51:59.214
And in fact, it may even end up that the best proposal may be the one that's actually accepted.

01:52:00.774 --> 01:52:09.416
It is important in this case because unlike in other cases, the property actually houses part of the district's special education program.

01:52:09.996 --> 01:52:20.239
And so it is important that the district is allowed to negotiate with whoever would come in so that whatever activity is allowed there is compatible with the existing use.

01:52:21.559 --> 01:52:25.520
We wouldn't want something that is not compatible with having students on site.

01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:28.861
So we respectfully request that you grant the waiver.

01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:29.181
Thank you.

01:52:32.197 --> 01:52:33.358
Any further discussion?

01:52:33.378 --> 01:52:35.159
Looks like I'm ready for a motion on this.

01:52:37.141 --> 01:52:39.802
I will make a motion to move the staff recommendation.

01:52:43.765 --> 01:52:44.846
Second by Member Burr.

01:52:45.126 --> 01:52:46.187
All those in favor?

01:52:46.207 --> 01:52:48.969
Okay, that carries unanimously.

01:52:49.349 --> 01:52:57.394
And so now we're on to the proposed consent calendar and we have some recusals here.

01:52:57.494 --> 01:52:58.175
So we have

01:53:03.405 --> 01:53:05.746
recusals on waiver 11.

01:53:06.426 --> 01:53:08.607
And we have a two-part motion.

01:53:08.747 --> 01:53:18.990
First of all, Sue Burr and Karen Valdez must be excused for recusal.

01:53:19.150 --> 01:53:25.572
So we will consider the first motion on proposed consent item 11.

01:53:27.753 --> 01:53:29.613
Is there any public comment on this item?

01:53:29.854 --> 01:53:30.014
No?

01:53:35.598 --> 01:53:39.340
The motion is to approve just Hemet and OMI.

01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:39.860
Yes.

01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:41.861
OK, so is there any public comment on that part?

01:53:41.901 --> 01:53:43.701
Yeah, just Hemet and OMI.

01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:44.962
So I'll move approval.

01:53:44.982 --> 01:53:51.004
OK, it's been moved and seconded.

01:53:51.504 --> 01:53:53.005
All those in favor, raise your hand.

01:53:54.265 --> 01:53:57.907
OK, now we have a second motion on proposed consent 11.

01:53:59.309 --> 01:54:06.511
And we have two more recusals, board member Strauss, board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:54:09.031 --> 01:54:19.073
And these are the rest of the remaining career technical education incentive grant renewal proposals from local districts.

01:54:19.093 --> 01:54:21.894
Is there any public comment on this item?

01:54:23.314 --> 01:54:23.514
No.

01:54:24.354 --> 01:54:25.575
OK, I'm ready for a motion.

01:54:25.695 --> 01:54:26.375
I'll move the item.

01:54:28.791 --> 01:54:31.894
Seconded by Board Member Rucker.

01:54:32.214 --> 01:54:33.075
All those in favor?

01:54:35.117 --> 01:54:35.557
Okay.

01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:41.582
Let's wait for our colleagues to come back and we can then move proposed consent items 12 through 18.

01:54:41.722 --> 01:54:46.426
Proposed consent items 12 through 19.

01:54:46.466 --> 01:54:46.566
Okay.

01:54:57.901 --> 01:55:03.286
Are there any speakers on these motions and on these consent items, I should say?

01:55:04.186 --> 01:55:04.547
All right.

01:55:04.667 --> 01:55:05.668
I'm ready for a motion.

01:55:06.028 --> 01:55:06.528
I would move.

01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:08.310
I'll second.

01:55:08.843 --> 01:55:11.805
Okay, Burr moved and Rucker seconded.

01:55:12.486 --> 01:55:14.467
All those in favor, raise your hands.

01:55:15.989 --> 01:55:17.750
Okay, carried.

01:55:17.890 --> 01:55:28.518
So now we're on to the first of our charter items and that is item 20 concerning the Vista Springs Charter School.

01:55:29.379 --> 01:55:30.460
CDE will present.

01:55:51.428 --> 01:55:52.408
Good morning board members.

01:55:52.488 --> 01:55:55.889
My name is Lisa Constancia with the Charter Schools Division again here today.

01:55:56.769 --> 01:56:01.691
Item 20 is an appeal by Vista Springs Charter School to establish a new charter school.

01:56:02.511 --> 01:56:14.174
Pursuant to Ed Code section J1, petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the State Board of Education for approval of a charter subject to certain conditions.

01:56:16.158 --> 01:56:28.645
To provide you some background on Vista Springs Charter School, on August 30th, 2017, the Vista Unified School District voted to deny the petition by a vote of four to zero.

01:56:29.366 --> 01:56:34.489
On November 8th, the San Diego County Office of Education took no action on the item.

01:56:35.249 --> 01:56:41.313
On November 16th, 2017, the Vista Springs Charter School submitted an appeal to the State Board of Education.

01:56:44.830 --> 01:56:51.536
Vista Springs Charter School is proposing a TK-12 program, and it is actually four educational programs.

01:56:51.916 --> 01:56:57.000
The La Fuente Academy is a TK-8 classroom-based dual immersion program.

01:56:57.621 --> 01:57:03.846
Their enrollment is expected at 131 for the opening year and to increase to 192 in the fifth year, 2022-23.

01:57:07.429 --> 01:57:20.317
They are also proposing a homeschool independent study TK-12 program that is a resource center supported program, starting with an enrollment of 18 in the opening school year, increasing to 22 in the 2022-23 school year.

01:57:24.315 --> 01:57:28.836
The third program is to be called Keys College and Career Prep High School.

01:57:29.037 --> 01:57:33.718
It is a nine through 12 independent study program with a resource center to support it.

01:57:33.738 --> 01:57:37.879
Enrollment starting at 15 for the first year and increasing to 25 by year five.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:46.829
And the fourth program, Mosaic Academy, a TK-8, three-day classroom-based and independent study model.

01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:57.943
This one would not be opening until the second year of operation in 2019-20, and then beginning with 32 students and increasing to 48 by that fifth year of the charter.

01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:13.172
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7th and the ACCS moved California Department of Education staff's recommendation to approve the petition and the motion passed with a seven to zero vote.

01:58:13.873 --> 01:58:24.262
In this case, the staff did not look at any additional information after the ACCS meeting because we did go with an approval recommendation to the ACCS.

01:58:25.083 --> 01:58:28.926
So we did already feel confident we had enough information to review at that time.

01:58:29.386 --> 01:58:34.409
And this was the one item out of the six that we did initially recommend approval on.

01:58:34.429 --> 01:58:38.031
So that's why we didn't look at any additional information, just to let you know.

01:58:39.532 --> 01:58:47.017
CDE recommends that the state board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish Vista Springs for a five-year term.

01:58:47.578 --> 01:58:54.182
The recommendation is based on demonstrably likely to implement the attendant program due to a realistic financial and operational plan.

01:58:54.742 --> 01:59:00.045
and a sound educational practice and comprehensive description of most of the charter elements in the petition.

01:59:02.287 --> 01:59:04.488
CDE staff is here for any questions you may have.

01:59:05.165 --> 01:59:05.505
Thank you.

01:59:06.446 --> 01:59:10.387
OK, technical questions.

01:59:10.407 --> 01:59:10.707
Yes.

01:59:11.228 --> 01:59:15.690
Just on the chronology, you said San Diego County did not act.

01:59:15.810 --> 01:59:18.371
Did they consider the petition, or did they just punt?

01:59:19.471 --> 01:59:21.652
They did have staff recommendations.

01:59:21.692 --> 01:59:26.354
Their recommendations were to deny, but they, within their 30 day, did not take action.

01:59:26.894 --> 01:59:28.435
So did they hold a hearing, do you know?

01:59:29.155 --> 01:59:30.636
Yes, they did hold a hearing.

01:59:30.757 --> 01:59:31.077
Thank you.

01:59:32.418 --> 01:59:35.600
And I think the county office is here also if you have any questions.

01:59:37.501 --> 01:59:49.870
Okay, so I'm going to open the public hearing now and first we will hear from the supporters of the CDE staff recommendation to approve the charter school petition.

01:59:50.851 --> 01:59:53.253
The petitioners have a total of 10 minutes.

01:59:53.894 --> 02:00:02.341
Then the district and county will have a chance to speak against the CDE recommendation and to oppose the charter school.

02:00:02.421 --> 02:00:04.002
They will also have ten minutes.

02:00:04.583 --> 02:00:14.851
So now I have the public hearing open so we will now move to the ten minute presentation by the supporters of the petition.

02:00:23.629 --> 02:00:24.109
Good morning.

02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:26.951
My name is Dr. Kathleen Hermsmeyer.

02:00:27.111 --> 02:00:30.352
I am the superintendent of the Springs Charter School Network of Schools.

02:00:30.852 --> 02:00:35.154
It's my pleasure to be here today to present our Vista Springs Charter petition to you.

02:00:36.135 --> 02:00:43.718
It's especially gratifying to stand here with CDE's recommendation for approval and the ACCS unanimous recommendation for approval, so that's delightful.

02:00:45.539 --> 02:00:55.467
I wanted to tell you that I brought my leadership team with me, my senior leadership team available to answer your questions if you have any related to education or special ed or EL or business.

02:00:56.488 --> 02:00:58.989
And so they're back there.

02:00:59.009 --> 02:01:03.093
And Harbor Springs Charter Schools is in its fifth year of operations.

02:01:03.753 --> 02:01:07.516
And our program at La Fuente and Vista is in the fourth year of operation.

02:01:07.576 --> 02:01:10.839
Our Springs Resource Centers provide a continuum of service

02:01:11.559 --> 02:01:17.287
to families who want a more parent-involved program.

02:01:17.327 --> 02:01:23.054
They want some independent study, some home study, and some classroom support.

02:01:23.455 --> 02:01:27.680
So it's a more supported version of a homeschool charter.

02:01:30.754 --> 02:01:35.195
It may, we also provide special ed and English language development services at the center.

02:01:36.535 --> 02:01:45.837
And so we are providing, like as she said, four different programs and personalized learning in every one of them.

02:01:45.897 --> 02:01:50.237
So it's one mission, but it's a continuum according to the needs of the parent.

02:01:51.438 --> 02:01:54.578
So, whoops, that was what I was supposed to be on, that slide.

02:01:55.658 --> 02:01:57.799
All right, so I'll move to the next slide.

02:02:00.137 --> 02:02:05.084
We always consider the needs of our students in each local area and we build a continuum of programs, as I've said.

02:02:05.865 --> 02:02:08.729
In Vista, parents really wanted a dual immersion program.

02:02:09.571 --> 02:02:14.377
Vista Unified School District does not have a bilingual dual immersion program on offer.

02:02:15.148 --> 02:02:18.909
We built one with the help of our really qualified, fantastic team.

02:02:19.649 --> 02:02:42.994
In looking at the needs of our community of learners, we decided when the ODIC situation, the Shasta decision came up, we decided when we were taking the opportunity to petition to change the program from a four-day model to a five-day seat-based model for the dual immersion program, because that better met the needs of our families.

02:02:46.291 --> 02:02:50.916
This is a graphic of our transition plan that was attached to our state waiver.

02:02:52.178 --> 02:02:58.725
Once the Anderson decision was made, we immediately began work on a local petition to come into alignment with the decision.

02:02:59.622 --> 02:03:05.507
We began drafting the charter petition in December of 2016 to submit to the local district, Vista Unified.

02:03:06.127 --> 02:03:09.650
We first submitted our petition in February and we were denied in April.

02:03:10.230 --> 02:03:21.859
We took all the reasons for denial and added 220 pages of detail to the charter petition and went back to Vista Unified because we had felt that they were open to that.

02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:26.583
But then when we went back, we were denied again in August.

02:03:27.341 --> 02:03:32.147
So then we appealed to the county, our appeal to the San Diego County was split with no action taken.

02:03:32.607 --> 02:03:34.089
And so that's how we came to be here today.

02:03:37.481 --> 02:03:53.973
So we appreciate the thorough review by your staff and we are happy to modify our charter petition to satisfy the three concerns that they had within the petition and they were mostly technical or smaller.

02:03:55.434 --> 02:03:57.255
So and we're happy to make those changes.

02:03:59.867 --> 02:04:02.349
Our building is fantastic.

02:04:02.369 --> 02:04:15.139
It was remodeled seven years ago and it's approved for use as a school with a gym, a full kitchen for a national school lunch program, and it's, as you know, for charter schools, a good facility is very hard to come by.

02:04:15.599 --> 02:04:22.505
We're delighted to have found such a great school location and we're in a lease for three more years with our own option for five more after that.

02:04:24.195 --> 02:04:35.021
And so, in closing, we do have a few parents, students, and staff here to speak to you today, but I'd like to show you a two-minute video of our students and staff at their school site in Vista.

02:04:40.844 --> 02:04:41.745
Bienvenidos!

02:04:41.845 --> 02:04:43.285
Hi, my name's Sophia.

02:04:43.345 --> 02:04:44.726
Welcome to my school.

02:04:44.866 --> 02:04:47.147
Let's go take a look at La Fuente Academy.

02:04:49.429 --> 02:04:52.051
I'm Amy Heald, and I'm the principal of La Fuente.

02:04:52.311 --> 02:05:03.319
The spring's vision is about empowering parents and about empowering students to set their own goals in life and learning, and also about making the community the classroom.

02:05:03.339 --> 02:05:04.479
So it's really one thing.

02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:08.942
La Fuente to me means a place where everyone can learn.

02:05:17.523 --> 02:05:22.425
Learning a language opens not only that language up to them, but it opens the world to them.

02:05:23.146 --> 02:05:31.230
It helps them connect in all areas, mathematics, music, and even in English, they learn how to speak better because of learning the second language.

02:05:32.390 --> 02:05:39.214
Some of the research that we have shows that the curve of learning of a student who is learning in two languages

02:05:40.134 --> 02:05:45.522
takes off around third or fourth grade, and they surpass in their academic achievement.

02:05:45.703 --> 02:05:48.547
So when I came here, I felt very welcomed.

02:05:48.948 --> 02:05:50.690
I didn't speak any Spanish before.

02:05:50.710 --> 02:05:54.696
It was a little challenging at first, but my teachers made it really easy for me.

02:05:55.297 --> 02:05:58.680
Sometimes people think that children have to be under the age of seven.

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:01.762
Some of the research says that that is the best time to learn a language.

02:06:02.423 --> 02:06:03.643
But it isn't too late.

02:06:03.984 --> 02:06:12.931
And that's why here at La Fuente, we not only try to encourage the children to learn to speak the second language, we encourage their parents to participate in that as well.

02:06:13.451 --> 02:06:15.833
Because it really, really does open the world to you.

02:06:15.853 --> 02:06:17.814
This is Alistair.

02:06:17.914 --> 02:06:19.195
He's in...

02:06:21.292 --> 02:06:21.652
Great.

02:06:22.793 --> 02:06:27.734
What inspired you to speak Spanish or is it like from your culture?

02:06:28.174 --> 02:06:38.858
I like to make secret messages so I think doing this and then having like one of my friends knowing Spanish would be like a really good way like if we were in a club

02:06:39.972 --> 02:06:43.233
to know what we're saying when we're talking to each other.

02:06:43.353 --> 02:06:44.654
Like a secret code.

02:06:44.934 --> 02:06:46.314
Yeah, pretty much.

02:06:46.334 --> 02:06:51.536
I want them to love learning, and I want them to be empowered to learn.

02:06:51.556 --> 02:06:58.879
That they don't need to know the language of the people fully to be able to interact with them in a positive way.

02:06:59.799 --> 02:07:01.160
It's that joy.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:11.788
And when you feel excited about every day of your job or your experience at school, how can that not be a wonderful learning experience?

02:07:25.077 --> 02:07:27.359
Okay, that concludes my presentation.

02:07:30.433 --> 02:07:36.898
Okay, now we have 10 minutes for the opponents to the CDE recommendation and to the charter petition.

02:07:42.382 --> 02:07:45.324
Okay, I see nobody signed up then.

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:49.848
Okay, so now we'll move to public comment.

02:07:51.149 --> 02:07:52.470
Public hearing is still on.

02:07:56.605 --> 02:07:58.586
With the following people, please line up.

02:07:59.127 --> 02:08:12.237
Michael Castaneda, Amy Heald, Molly Elkins, Audrey Elkins, Candace Lynch, Havana Lynch Castillo, Tom VanHoekelum, Jeff Rice, and Romel Antoine.

02:08:13.278 --> 02:08:13.679
Thank you.

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:15.600
Please come forward.

02:08:16.361 --> 02:08:20.064
And identify yourself, and if you're with an organization, identify that.

02:08:20.664 --> 02:08:21.285
One minute, yeah.

02:08:22.025 --> 02:08:22.425
Absolutely.

02:08:23.105 --> 02:08:23.585
Good morning.

02:08:23.685 --> 02:08:24.366
Buenos dias.

02:08:25.006 --> 02:08:25.706
I'm Amy Hilt.

02:08:25.846 --> 02:08:27.747
You just saw me on the video with some of my students.

02:08:28.307 --> 02:08:29.787
I'm the principal of La Fuente.

02:08:30.467 --> 02:08:35.629
And like so many of us in California, and maybe some of you, I am the grandchild of pioneers.

02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:45.852
My family came to the Imperial Valley in 1908, and they braved the terrible summer heat as they worked with other families to create an enduring agricultural community.

02:08:47.386 --> 02:08:52.646
Being a pioneer is all about making sacrifices to make your dreams and the dreams of others come true.

02:08:54.167 --> 02:09:05.070
All of us at Springs Charter Schools act as pioneers every day as we work to innovate learning experiences specifically tailored to our students.

02:09:05.890 --> 02:09:10.151
At La Fuente we are a community who want our children to be bilingual and biliterate.

02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:13.732
Some students have grandparents who only speak Spanish.

02:09:14.312 --> 02:09:18.253
Some dream of having their children better equipped for this multilingual world.

02:09:19.273 --> 02:09:20.614
Some just think it's fun.

02:09:21.534 --> 02:09:25.400
No matter the reason, families are choosing our program and students are thriving with us.

02:09:26.021 --> 02:09:31.971
Please allow us to continue to ignite the excitement of discovery in our students by voting for our charter.

02:09:32.071 --> 02:09:32.472
Thank you.

02:09:32.672 --> 02:09:33.133
Gracias.

02:09:39.994 --> 02:09:44.476
Hello, my name is Molly Elkins and I'm the director of instruction for a small educational company.

02:09:45.117 --> 02:09:47.158
Quality of education is very important to me.

02:09:47.598 --> 02:09:51.320
When my daughter entered TK, we were very happy to find La Fuente.

02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:53.701
It's not like any of the other schools in our area.

02:09:54.541 --> 02:09:57.283
It is community focused and offers bilingual immersion.

02:09:57.583 --> 02:10:03.025
I was homeschooled and a French major in college, so student-centered learning and languages are very important to me.

02:10:03.586 --> 02:10:06.687
I was immediately impressed with the mixed-grade classrooms and activities.

02:10:07.207 --> 02:10:14.971
Audrey has opportunities to learn with kids of varied age levels, and she's also had an opportunity to learn a language in an immersive classroom.

02:10:15.551 --> 02:10:19.533
I wanted my daughter to learn a language from a young age in order to develop fluency.

02:10:20.353 --> 02:10:24.154
At La Fuente, there's a culture of learning and sharing among students, parents, and teachers.

02:10:24.775 --> 02:10:31.877
What this looks like is a friendly, nurturing environment and comfortable, easy relationships between our family and all of the La Fuente staff.

02:10:32.958 --> 02:10:40.480
A benefit that I didn't expect is that my daughter isn't intimidated when she meets someone who doesn't look like her or speak her first language.

02:10:41.080 --> 02:10:45.062
Please authorize Vista Springs so that we can continue building this diverse community.

02:11:06.148 --> 02:11:11.215
Hi my name is Audrey Elkins and I'm here because it's worth the trip to tell you about my school.

02:11:11.716 --> 02:11:14.440
There are three things I especially love about my school.

02:11:15.121 --> 02:11:19.647
I love the fact that my school is small and there are lots of people who care about me.

02:11:21.187 --> 02:11:25.069
Not just my teacher, but all of the teachers and people in the office too.

02:11:25.389 --> 02:11:28.090
I like that I'm someone who helps create my school.

02:11:28.491 --> 02:11:40.457
If I think way back to the beginning, I remember when I was in TK that I got to help unpack the desks and chairs and practice using the screwdriver to put the desks together.

02:11:40.477 --> 02:11:47.180
I like that I get to learn Spanish so that when I am a grown up,

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:51.027
I can make friends in lots of other countries where they speak Spanish.

02:11:51.548 --> 02:11:54.835
When I grow up, I want to be a singer and sing all around the world.

02:12:03.789 --> 02:12:05.110
Hola, buenos dias.

02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:09.993
Hello everyone, my name is Havana Dorsady and I'm really excited to be here.

02:12:10.713 --> 02:12:14.155
I've never been on a plane before and it was very exciting to fly here.

02:12:16.496 --> 02:12:18.738
And some of my family even came to hear me speak.

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:30.224
I want to tell you about my school La Fuente Academy because I get to learn Spanish there and since Spanish was my first language, it is one of my dreams to continue learning and practicing my Spanish.

02:12:30.905 --> 02:12:32.526
Does anyone know what La Fuente means?

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.943
It means a fountain, but to me it means a fountain of knowledge.

02:12:37.643 --> 02:12:45.910
My school is about learning adventures and ever since kindergarten, our teachers and visitors have inspired us to learn and make our life an adventure.

02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:51.494
I hope you'll approve to La Fuente Academy so we can all get back to our learning and our adventures.

02:12:51.895 --> 02:12:52.715
Thank you for your time.

02:13:09.531 --> 02:13:10.431
Good morning, everyone.

02:13:10.892 --> 02:13:12.032
My name is Candace Lynch.

02:13:12.573 --> 02:13:16.895
Thank you for the opportunity to share our stories on why La Fuente Academy is dear to our hearts.

02:13:17.655 --> 02:13:18.936
Spanish was my first language.

02:13:19.156 --> 02:13:21.657
However, I quickly picked up English before kindergarten.

02:13:22.298 --> 02:13:28.881
I didn't have the opportunity to attend a bilingual school like La Fuente, so I only spoke it when needed, which was in conversing with my grandmother.

02:13:29.441 --> 02:13:34.224
When I was nine years old, she passed away, and I no longer found a need to continue my Spanish.

02:13:34.924 --> 02:13:38.511
I began to forget the language and quickly became very self-conscious.

02:13:39.153 --> 02:13:44.182
In high school, I took Spanish classes, but to be honest, I had a very difficult time relearning my first language.

02:13:44.703 --> 02:13:46.166
It was a lot harder than I expected.

02:13:47.634 --> 02:13:55.456
However, with constant exposure and practice, learning Spanish has added great value to my life skills as well as to my resume and my career.

02:13:56.156 --> 02:14:02.897
My hope is to provide my daughter with the opportunities that I didn't have, and La Fuente Academy offers those successful opportunities.

02:14:03.477 --> 02:14:09.519
I hope you will consider the value and potential of our school as we look forward to taking our education to the next level.

02:14:09.939 --> 02:14:10.639
Thank you for your time.

02:14:18.223 --> 02:14:19.283
Hola y buenos dias.

02:14:19.524 --> 02:14:26.867
My name is Tom Van Heukelen and I have the joy of teaching 5th through 8th grades at La Fuente under the oversight of the Springs Charter Schools.

02:14:28.448 --> 02:14:33.110
La Fuente offers the only dual language immersion program in Vista and the surrounding communities.

02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:38.452
This program helps our kids develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and communication skills.

02:14:38.752 --> 02:14:42.194
A dual language immersion program takes what's traditionally considered a challenge

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:49.338
and makes it an asset as native Spanish speakers and native English speakers model language both in the classroom and on the playground.

02:14:50.199 --> 02:14:54.601
Students use both languages to study, communicate, and to get their desires and needs met.

02:14:54.841 --> 02:14:59.084
They learn to value both languages, both cultures, and the racial divide disappears.

02:14:59.904 --> 02:15:10.511
The dual language model is a proven model and has above average test scores in schools where the English learner population and poverty rate are often higher than in the surrounding schools.

02:15:11.277 --> 02:15:19.674
This school is the only opportunity for students in our area to participate in a dual language immersion program, and we all hope you will see the appropriateness of granting our charter.

02:15:20.676 --> 02:15:20.957
Please.

02:15:21.398 --> 02:15:21.678
Thank you.

02:15:25.951 --> 02:15:28.652
Good morning, Michael Flores Castaneda, California Teachers Association.

02:15:29.132 --> 02:15:47.959
And we're here to speak in opposition of the staff recommendation based not only on the findings of the district and the county school board for the unsound educational program and the unlikelihood of a successful implementation, but also because of the lack of the declaration to consider itself the exclusive employer of those, exclusive public employer of those employees.

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:54.042
So on behalf of those would-be employees and their rights, those educators' rights, we ask you to deny the staff recommendation.

02:15:54.142 --> 02:15:54.402
Thank you.

02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:05.994
California Charter Schools Association here to speak in support of Vista Springs.

02:16:06.474 --> 02:16:15.681
They are an existing program and this is the first of many items that we'll see over the next few months out of the Shasta V. Anderson decision.

02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:23.608
that schools are coming out of waivers and asking this board to consider their approval for a new program, which is similar to what they were running before.

02:16:23.668 --> 02:16:33.457
What's really strong about Vista Springs is that they have taken the opportunity in this waiver time to improve their program and to listen to their community to improve their offerings.

02:16:33.537 --> 02:16:40.763
And so we asked this board to move ACCS's recommendation and CDE's recommendation of support.

02:16:41.104 --> 02:16:41.364
Thank you.

02:16:45.302 --> 02:16:46.083
Good morning, everyone.

02:16:46.123 --> 02:16:49.165
Jeff Rice with the A Plus Personalized Learning Network Association.

02:16:49.245 --> 02:16:56.931
I'm also here in support of the Vista Springs Charter Petition Appeal and would like to ask for your support as well.

02:16:57.611 --> 02:17:08.900
I have worked very closely with Dr. Hernsmeyer and her leadership team now for more than 15 years and can attest to the fact that they run an excellent program that is very successful.

02:17:09.780 --> 02:17:17.043
with a strong commitment to a personalized learning model of education and to high standards of academic excellence and accountability.

02:17:17.623 --> 02:17:25.787
It bears emphasis in repeating that in good faith, Vista Springs submitted its petition twice to the local district

02:17:26.527 --> 02:17:43.419
and was denied the first time, and then they corrected all of the errors that were cited, went back a second time with all of those corrections, and were denied for a completely different set of reasons, which makes one wonder whether they would have been approved under any circumstances.

02:17:43.899 --> 02:17:51.104
So therefore, I urge you to step in and do what is right for the parents and students in the San Diego community and approve this charter.

02:17:51.385 --> 02:17:51.685
Thank you.

02:17:55.874 --> 02:17:57.575
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

02:17:57.895 --> 02:17:59.336
Again, in support.

02:17:59.616 --> 02:18:03.798
I'll associate myself with the prior two speakers in the interest of time.

02:18:03.978 --> 02:18:10.260
Innovative program, one that continues to evolve even after umpteen years to meet the evolving needs of the community.

02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:10.681
Thank you.

02:18:13.722 --> 02:18:16.283
OK, that concludes the public hearing.

02:18:16.383 --> 02:18:17.984
And we've heard all the public comments.

02:18:18.024 --> 02:18:22.966
So now we're ready for conversation among the board, comments from the liaisons.

02:18:25.162 --> 02:18:28.587
Do you want to start with comments from the liaisons?

02:18:28.607 --> 02:18:30.891
Well, how about from the board, if there's any board comments?

02:18:32.553 --> 02:18:33.595
OK, liaisons first.

02:18:36.624 --> 02:18:59.475
This is, from my viewpoint, probably one of the easier appeals for today, for this afternoon, with the ACCS recommendation, with the CDE recommendation, with no opposition showing up, with the county not taking action, and with the presentation.

02:19:01.256 --> 02:19:05.558
I am very comfortable recommending this school for approval.

02:19:05.578 --> 02:19:09.821
Other board comments on that?

02:19:09.841 --> 02:19:13.423
Board member Ortiz-Lacon.

02:19:13.752 --> 02:19:15.773
Yes, bienvenidos.

02:19:16.334 --> 02:19:25.060
I also agree, I think this is probably the easiest of the proposals coming before us, but one of the things that I appreciate is that it is a unique model.

02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:29.683
It's a language model that is not offered, a DI model not offered by the district.

02:19:30.523 --> 02:19:35.607
The districts didn't show up to express how this would be a burden in their own communities.

02:19:35.947 --> 02:19:37.468
And we don't see a community divided.

02:19:37.568 --> 02:19:41.230
And I have to say that yesterday I left here with a very, very heavy heart.

02:19:42.291 --> 02:19:45.673
And so this is a type of charter proposals that I like to see.

02:19:46.373 --> 02:19:52.677
And I feel like this is something I could fully support legally and also it's right with my heart and my mind.

02:19:53.198 --> 02:19:53.398
Thanks.

02:19:55.956 --> 02:19:58.438
OK, seeing no other comment, I'm ready for a motion.

02:19:58.558 --> 02:20:00.059
Liaison might make a motion.

02:20:01.721 --> 02:20:05.724
I move approval of CDE's recommendation to authorize this school.

02:20:06.845 --> 02:20:07.906
Second by Holiday.

02:20:09.307 --> 02:20:10.888
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:20:10.908 --> 02:20:13.370
OK, that carries unanimously.

02:20:22.177 --> 02:20:23.799
OK, we're now on to item

02:20:25.103 --> 02:20:30.734
21, this is the Bay Point Preparatory Academy in the San Marcos Unified School District.

02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:02.690
Okay, item 21 is an appeal by Bay Point Preparatory Academy in San Diego to establish a new charter school.

02:21:04.818 --> 02:21:11.403
August 15, 2017, the San Marcos Unified School District voted to deny the petition by a vote of 5-0.

02:21:12.103 --> 02:21:18.608
November 8, 2017, the San Diego County Board of Education voted to deny the petition by a vote of 3-2.

02:21:19.509 --> 02:21:25.053
November 29, 2017, Baypoint submitted a petition on appeal to the State Board of Education.

02:21:27.745 --> 02:21:32.030
Bay Point San Diego is proposing a TK-12 site-based program.

02:21:32.610 --> 02:21:37.816
Their targeting enrollment is 200 in the first year of operation, increasing to 600 by year 2022-23.

02:21:42.119 --> 02:21:50.105
Also, to let the board members know, there is an existing school, existing Bay Point school, Bay Point Preparatory Academy that is currently authorized by the state board.

02:21:50.786 --> 02:21:58.312
It is a K-12 classroom-based program, similar to the one that is being proposed today, and it is in Hemet, California.

02:22:01.141 --> 02:22:16.380
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7, 2018, and the ACCS moved to recommend approval of the petition on the condition that CDE would verify the revised budget and ensure that the revised budget was sound.

02:22:16.981 --> 02:22:19.624
This motion was passed by a vote of six to one.

02:22:21.368 --> 02:22:25.829
CDE staff did review the revised budget as requested by the ACCS.

02:22:26.470 --> 02:22:34.812
The CDE recommendation is that the state board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish Bay Point Academy San Diego.

02:22:35.392 --> 02:22:44.275
And the recommendation is based on the demonstratively unlikely to implement the program, mainly based on their fiscal reserves, that they have very minimal fiscal reserves.

02:22:46.735 --> 02:22:48.856
I'm here and available for any questions that you might have.

02:22:50.603 --> 02:22:51.603
Okay, Board Member Williams.

02:22:53.124 --> 02:22:58.105
Could you repeat what their fiscal reserves are currently projected to be for year one?

02:22:58.405 --> 02:23:06.327
Yes, for year one they're at 3.4% and we are comfortable at about a 5% reserve.

02:23:07.047 --> 02:23:13.289
And I can't remember who said this or where I heard it yesterday that

02:23:16.650 --> 02:23:26.755
either statute or regulations or policy, something like that, expects schools to be at 5%, charter schools to be at 5% by the end of year two.

02:23:27.515 --> 02:23:28.576
Do you know what I'm talking about?

02:23:28.956 --> 02:23:30.456
What the, no, that's not true?

02:23:32.077 --> 02:23:34.738
Someone in the audience is shaking their head that that's not true.

02:23:36.759 --> 02:23:37.099
Okay.

02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:42.422
That has been, from my understanding, the 5% reserve has been our policy.

02:23:44.045 --> 02:23:46.126
It is in our MOUs also.

02:23:49.107 --> 02:23:52.828
Did they make some changes or take a look at their budget?

02:23:52.968 --> 02:23:54.069
Did you take a look at their budget?

02:23:54.109 --> 02:23:54.349
We did.

02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:55.289
How much is it?

02:23:55.329 --> 02:23:55.709
It is 3.4%.

02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:58.910
Other than that, the rest of the budget looked okay?

02:24:03.587 --> 02:24:03.807
Yes.

02:24:05.008 --> 02:24:10.251
And this school is, as I understand it, is a second school.

02:24:10.491 --> 02:24:14.913
We already authorized one of the, a school, Hemet.

02:24:15.354 --> 02:24:15.614
Correct.

02:24:15.654 --> 02:24:16.594
That we authorize.

02:24:17.135 --> 02:24:21.197
And this is a second school in that charter management organization.

02:24:21.477 --> 02:24:21.917
That's correct.

02:24:22.357 --> 02:24:24.959
And Hemet, for Hemet, when did we authorize that?

02:24:25.692 --> 02:24:30.377
That one was authorized in 2015 and 2016.

02:24:30.537 --> 02:24:35.101
It expires in 2020 with the board.

02:24:35.201 --> 02:24:44.570
Has CDE had a reason to issue any kind of letters of concern about either their operations or their finances?

02:24:45.123 --> 02:25:02.635
No, I actually just confirmed this morning, we have issued a letter of academic support, and that is really to have a discussion with them on where their dashboard, there's some oranges on their dashboard, but that is more of just of a conversation between staff and the charter school.

02:25:02.975 --> 02:25:10.180
But in terms of fiscal, their first interim report has come back fine, and we just received their second interim report.

02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:14.222
We haven't had a chance to analyze that yet, but they seem to be in good fiscal standing.

02:25:15.283 --> 02:25:15.624
Okay.

02:25:17.546 --> 02:25:20.909
Other board member questions before we open up the public hearing?

02:25:22.511 --> 02:25:24.914
Okay, I now declare the public hearing open.

02:25:24.994 --> 02:25:35.125
Each side will have 10 minutes so we'll start with the people who support the petition in this case and oppose the CDE recommendation.

02:25:46.451 --> 02:25:46.631
Yeah.

02:25:47.253 --> 02:25:51.320
Might need some tech support from our control room, because the screen's gone blank.

02:26:47.558 --> 02:26:47.889
I believe.

02:27:24.531 --> 02:27:24.811
Okay, go ahead.

02:27:24.831 --> 02:27:27.652
Good morning, State Board and CD staff.

02:27:27.712 --> 02:27:35.636
My name is Nancy Spencer and I'm the lead petitioner for Bay Point Repertory Academy in San Diego.

02:27:36.436 --> 02:27:45.400
First of all, before we get going, I'd like to thank the staff, CD staff for all of the time and energy and effort that they have put into reviewing our petition and supporting documents.

02:27:46.178 --> 02:27:50.960
As I said, my name is Nancy Spencer, and I want to introduce our team to you that put this petition together.

02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:54.181
I have been in education for 46 years.

02:27:54.321 --> 02:27:57.062
I hold elementary, secondary, and administrative credentials.

02:27:57.662 --> 02:27:59.723
I have been in the charter world for 13 years.

02:28:00.463 --> 02:28:02.844
I have opened three successful charter schools.

02:28:03.124 --> 02:28:09.287
Two of those schools were from the beginning, and one of them was a school, Bayshore, in San Marcos that was going to be closed.

02:28:09.967 --> 02:28:14.810
We initially, on all three of the schools, received full WASC accreditation at the first visit.

02:28:15.451 --> 02:28:27.899
In the first school that I was in, in Ventura, Oxnard area, it was an ASAM 9-12 high school with 80% Hispanic, and we had one of the fourth highest API scores in the state with that school.

02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:31.082
Frank Aguaro is our board chair.

02:28:31.183 --> 02:28:33.446
He's been in business for over 20 some years.

02:28:33.466 --> 02:28:39.494
He has been in Charterworld for 12 years with a parent and as well as nine years on the charter board.

02:28:39.755 --> 02:28:45.843
He was the founder of Baypoint and Hemet as well, and he was an immigrant from Uganda during his teen years.

02:28:46.724 --> 02:28:48.645
Heather Herrera is our Director of Education.

02:28:49.126 --> 02:28:50.987
She has been in education 11 years.

02:28:51.347 --> 02:28:54.029
She's been in the charter world for about the last five years.

02:28:54.149 --> 02:28:58.732
She holds her multiple subject credential, and her emphasis is in reading instruction.

02:28:59.093 --> 02:29:10.381
She's worked as a special education behavioral interventionist, and she is also instrumental in developing our K-5 blended learning program that we use out in Bay Point and Hemet.

02:29:11.181 --> 02:29:16.467
Thomas Dell and Bill Jaeger are two other board members who are also founders of Bay Point and this school.

02:29:16.948 --> 02:29:23.676
They collectively have over 40 years experience in business as well as nine and four years respectfully as charter board members.

02:29:25.307 --> 02:29:29.390
Our proven track record, our first school, Bayshore, that is located in San Marcos, opened in 2005.

02:29:29.510 --> 02:29:34.073
It's a K-12, non-classroom-based instruction program.

02:29:34.593 --> 02:29:45.160
It received WASC initial accreditation on its first term out, and in 2014, received the highest WASC accreditation, the sixth year with a mid-term report due.

02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:47.341
It has 41 ACG courses.

02:29:47.481 --> 02:29:54.925
It also has its NCAA-approved courses, which is very difficult for an independent study school to acquire that.

02:29:54.965 --> 02:29:56.426
It took us two years to do that.

02:29:56.987 --> 02:30:00.829
We had two unanimous approvals, renewals with that school.

02:30:01.269 --> 02:30:04.171
I came to Bayshore in 2010, the spring.

02:30:04.191 --> 02:30:08.393
2009-10, they were in a year where the district was going to close them down.

02:30:10.094 --> 02:30:18.426
hired me with the intent of getting the school turned around and as we did we were able to get a unanimous approval at the end of that year renewal as well as another five year.

02:30:19.281 --> 02:30:21.103
Bayshore's academics are track record.

02:30:21.123 --> 02:30:31.372
With the API, you can see from the graph that every year they've continued to improve and exceed what the amount was suggested by the growth that should be each year in API.

02:30:31.832 --> 02:30:37.137
And when CASP was initiated and implemented, we also have continued to improve that.

02:30:37.177 --> 02:30:44.364
We had one slight drop, as you see in the math, but we implemented some changes in our program, and as a result, our scores continue to increase.

02:30:45.526 --> 02:30:50.628
The subgroups, we also looked at our subgroups with the API, as well as our CASP results.

02:30:51.168 --> 02:30:54.489
And as you can see, those two have continued to increase with those groups.

02:30:54.529 --> 02:31:01.732
We looked at Hispanic and socioeconomics in the API, and then our economically disadvantaged in English and math.

02:31:03.325 --> 02:31:09.791
We wanted to get a comparison for this year to see how we've done compared to our local district as well as our county and the state.

02:31:10.291 --> 02:31:17.838
And in ELA, we were pretty close to what San Marcos had as far as both with all students as well as the economically disadvantaged students.

02:31:18.338 --> 02:31:28.167
In our math, we actually exceeded the outperformed the district, the county, and the state as well, both in all students and in the economically disadvantaged.

02:31:29.275 --> 02:31:33.797
Our subgroup population at Bayshore has continued to be above 50%.

02:31:34.217 --> 02:31:40.439
We were at 61, as you can see on the graph, and this year it's at 52.6 with the unduplicated.

02:31:40.799 --> 02:31:42.720
That is a lot higher than what the district is.

02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:44.821
The district has been slowly decreasing.

02:31:44.861 --> 02:31:50.143
They're at 40 this year, but without recruiting that population, we have continued to be high.

02:31:50.483 --> 02:31:54.865
And our special education population, you can also see, has remained consistent.

02:31:55.828 --> 02:32:06.238
Our budget, well our priority location is to locate in the geographic area of one of these three elementary schools and to correct it we're a TK8 program not a TK12.

02:32:06.799 --> 02:32:11.543
So we're TK6 the first year and then adding 7th and 8th the following consecutive years.

02:32:12.004 --> 02:32:20.052
Our budget, we've allocated $10,000 to market towards these populations and those are the statistics for the unduplicated count in

02:32:20.592 --> 02:32:29.210
those elementary boundaries, and we have conservatively estimated 75% that we've put forecasts into our budget.

02:32:30.512 --> 02:32:35.916
Our second school, as you know, is a state board approved charter that was approved in 2015, Bay Point Preparatory.

02:32:36.016 --> 02:32:36.876
It's a K-12.

02:32:37.237 --> 02:32:39.318
It received WASC on its initial accreditation.

02:32:39.398 --> 02:32:42.000
It also has its A through G40 courses approved.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:48.965
And we do have the NCAA courses that have been approved, as well as we are in our first year of CIF competition.

02:32:49.765 --> 02:32:51.406
And we offer music, art, and PE.

02:32:53.054 --> 02:33:00.858
I want to take a look at our first year in operation, what our CASP results were compared to the local school, elementary and middle, as well as the district.

02:33:01.598 --> 02:33:13.824
And as you can see, Bay Point, in the blue, outperformed almost consistently across the all-student grade levels, as well as with our economically disadvantaged students in ELA.

02:33:16.085 --> 02:33:18.987
Also in math, we looked at that, and as you can see, the same thing.

02:33:19.107 --> 02:33:28.635
Bay Point, again, outperformed consistently pretty much all the local school as well as the district in both the all-student and the economically disadvantaged.

02:33:29.941 --> 02:33:41.774
In the science, which was the last year that the CST was administered in our first year of operation, we also took a look at how our students performed, both the all students and economically disadvantaged by the three grade levels that are tested.

02:33:42.094 --> 02:33:49.382
As you can see that Bay Point did perform all except for maybe one where they outperformed the local school or the district.

02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:59.745
In year two of the CASP, we also did a comparison just to see how do we measure up, because we're serving the same populations in our school as in the surrounding areas.

02:34:00.206 --> 02:34:04.228
And this is for the ELA and the all students as well as economically disadvantaged.

02:34:05.488 --> 02:34:08.470
Again, math for the CASP last year, the same thing.

02:34:08.750 --> 02:34:14.513
We did a comparison so we could see how we're measuring up with populations that are in our geographic region.

02:34:16.704 --> 02:34:27.029
We wanted to look at last year, since our population increased and our school grew, how our EL students as well as our SPED students did compared to the local district.

02:34:27.609 --> 02:34:38.194
And the scores from my perspective aren't high, what they should be, but in comparison with what's going on around us, we still did exceptional with the ELA and the math.

02:34:39.949 --> 02:34:49.093
Our subgroup population has continued to grow in the three years that we have been in existence, and it's now up to 76% for the free and reduced lunch population.

02:34:49.494 --> 02:34:55.396
Our EL population dropped this year at the beginning when we took the CBEDS numbers, and I'll explain in the next slide.

02:34:55.917 --> 02:34:58.138
And our SPED population continues to increase.

02:34:59.144 --> 02:35:07.307
The reason that our EL population dropped, as you can see on this slide, is at Bay Point, we reclassified 50% of our students.

02:35:07.807 --> 02:35:12.549
At Bayshore, we reclassified 70%, and it's broken down by the various grade levels.

02:35:12.969 --> 02:35:26.454
And I'm excited about one student that was a 11th grader at our school who was EL, and he reclassified, and he was also a SPED student, so that's encouraging to see we were able to get him over that hump.

02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:43.611
finances that's an issue of concern and i wanted to bring up this in our my side presentation about our track record with our finances as i mentioned to you that i began in the school in the spring of two thousand and ten so that's the last year at the bottom that i've done any numbers for you

02:35:44.392 --> 02:35:48.314
I walked in the door of that school and was told the day I started I had to cut $100,000 from the budget.

02:35:48.934 --> 02:35:57.599
Well, as you can see, we were able to do that, and with the data about our academics, our scores, our academics were not impacted by that.

02:35:57.979 --> 02:36:02.862
And so every year I put on here this table, the projected and the actuals, because we're showing you

02:36:03.942 --> 02:36:06.724
We do know how to adjust a budget and how to work a budget.

02:36:06.744 --> 02:36:11.426
A budget is a proposal, and then what happens is you adjust it and modify it as you go on.

02:36:11.706 --> 02:36:20.891
Bay Point, as you can see, ended the first year with 13.26 percent, higher than what we had initially projected, and we're set to end the year with 18 percent.

02:36:21.372 --> 02:36:25.394
This is just a graph of where we were and how it looks from the previous table.

02:36:26.758 --> 02:36:31.924
And contingency budget, the numbers that you were asking about earlier, you can see the 2018-19, it's $113,000, and we came up with $5.69.

02:36:31.964 --> 02:36:33.245
The CD staff was saying $3.4 based on a $67.

02:36:33.285 --> 02:36:35.567
Those numbers are because the lottery funds

02:36:43.255 --> 02:36:50.505
and the $5,000 in fundraising we'd included in the budget were removed, hence the discrepancy between our budget and the budget that they have.

02:36:50.865 --> 02:36:51.886
We have also applied.

02:36:51.946 --> 02:37:00.377
We're in the process of starting the PCSGP grant application, which we received for Bay Point, and we attended the workshop on Monday and will be submitting that application.

02:37:01.498 --> 02:37:07.003
Just a reminder in August that you were in the report that CDE presented to the SBE.

02:37:07.504 --> 02:37:11.867
It shows how the schools that they oversee did academically and financially.

02:37:12.408 --> 02:37:18.533
And as you can see, Bay Point met both the academic and was considered good financial standing.

02:37:18.553 --> 02:37:23.858
And that was only eight of the 22 schools that had both of those criterias met.

02:37:24.398 --> 02:37:28.559
Again, Bay Point Preparatory will be a replication of what we've been doing up in Hammett.

02:37:28.599 --> 02:37:29.739
We're doing it in San Marcos.

02:37:30.099 --> 02:37:32.560
It'll be a TK-8 program, college prep.

02:37:32.660 --> 02:37:33.740
It's going to be data-driven.

02:37:34.020 --> 02:37:38.041
We're going for the WASC accreditation in the first year and the low student-teacher ratio.

02:37:38.561 --> 02:37:42.582
So I ask for your support in approving Bay Point Preparatory Academy San Diego.

02:37:43.042 --> 02:37:43.543
Thank you.

02:37:43.563 --> 02:37:47.183
Okay, 10 minutes for the opponents.

02:37:48.124 --> 02:37:49.544
District and county people.

02:37:56.465 --> 02:37:57.666
Going once, twice.

02:37:58.786 --> 02:37:59.207
Okay.

02:37:59.927 --> 02:38:02.088
No, no appearance by opponents.

02:38:02.228 --> 02:38:05.150
So we will then begin the public comment.

02:38:10.475 --> 02:38:12.976
Will the following individuals please line up at the podium?

02:38:13.597 --> 02:38:29.165
Angela Ramos, Brian Adams, Heather Herrera, Frank Aguaro, Richard Homsberger, Steve Nelson, Rommel Antone, Eric Premack, and that's it.

02:38:37.889 --> 02:38:38.309
Good morning.

02:38:38.349 --> 02:38:41.530
My name is Brian Adams with Abacus Education Partners.

02:38:42.310 --> 02:38:44.330
I helped prepare the budget for the CHAR petition.

02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:54.832
The budget we submitted actually has reserves of 5.7% in year one, but the CDA staff adjusted our budget by taking away two of our revenue streams, which is how they arrived at reserves of less than 5%.

02:38:56.132 --> 02:38:58.853
These two revenue streams are fundraising and year one lottery.

02:38:59.273 --> 02:39:06.194
The fundraising revenue of 5,000 is less than one-fifth of what we normally raise in each of the other two schools that we operate.

02:39:07.454 --> 02:39:17.941
But even if we don't include any of that fundraising revenue, we still exceed the more than 5% reserve threshold because the $35,000 in lottery revenue for year one should be included.

02:39:18.381 --> 02:39:31.349
We have demonstrated this in our recent correspondence, which you have a copy of, which states that in accordance with accrual basis accounting, the lottery revenue is properly included in year one revenue because that is the year in which this revenue is earned.

02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:33.370
That's all.

02:39:34.031 --> 02:39:34.291
Thank you.

02:39:41.482 --> 02:39:46.285
Good morning, my name is Heather Herrera, and I will be the Director of Education at Baypoint San Diego.

02:39:46.325 --> 02:39:47.906
I want to thank you for your time this morning.

02:39:48.566 --> 02:39:58.613
As a member of the petitioning team, I've been deeply involved in the development of our educational program, and as a former classroom teacher, I've used both the model and the materials that we've outlined for you in the petition.

02:40:00.695 --> 02:40:09.965
As you can see, based on Nancy's slides, what we put together in the educational program is a replication of what we're currently successfully implementing at Hemet.

02:40:10.646 --> 02:40:18.275
And as you can also see in Nancy's slides, we have been able to meet the diverse needs of our different diverse student populations.

02:40:19.035 --> 02:40:23.799
I also wanted to bring your attention to the number of signatures and our parent letters that we've submitted to you.

02:40:24.240 --> 02:40:31.225
There's truly a need in the San Marcos community for a alternative to what's currently being offered for our site-based schools.

02:40:31.726 --> 02:40:34.308
So again, I wanted to thank you again for your time and your review.

02:40:34.868 --> 02:40:38.491
And if you have any questions about the educational program, I'd be happy to answer those.

02:40:38.812 --> 02:40:39.112
Thank you.

02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.480
Good morning, SBE Board members.

02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:50.921
My name is Frank Aguaro, President of Baypoint Hemet and Bayshore San Marcos.

02:40:51.502 --> 02:40:59.944
With Baypoint San Diego, we included the $35,000 in lottery revenue in the budget because it's earned in year one consistent with the accrual method of accounting.

02:41:00.344 --> 02:41:09.886
Although we also have the option to withdraw down on an available $2 million in working capital, cover this, our contingency pro forma, before he requires no need to borrow.

02:41:10.686 --> 02:41:19.671
Short the lottery in fundraising revenue, the changes in year one reserves from 5.6 to 3.4, which can certainly be addressed in a technical clarification.

02:41:19.711 --> 02:41:25.914
CDE staff did find that all other concerns were addressed and the school has a multi-year positive fund balance.

02:41:26.634 --> 02:41:33.944
As with our current schools, this third school will maintain adequate reserves and remain cash flow positive.

02:41:34.484 --> 02:41:42.374
For reconsideration, I hope our track record and response to staff findings gives you the confidence that we have the ability to successfully implement the intended program.

02:41:42.434 --> 02:41:42.735
Thank you.

02:41:47.773 --> 02:41:48.593
Good morning, board members.

02:41:48.613 --> 02:41:50.454
My name is Richard Hansberg.

02:41:50.715 --> 02:41:52.596
I represent Bay Point.

02:41:52.956 --> 02:41:54.397
I think it's important to note two things.

02:41:54.457 --> 02:41:56.057
First, you see no opposition here today.

02:41:56.077 --> 02:42:00.140
I think that's testimony to the strength of this school and its organizational capability.

02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:06.483
And second, I'd note that at the district level, there were no findings and zero findings made regarding the educational program at this school.

02:42:06.523 --> 02:42:08.144
And the only two findings were made regarding

02:42:08.544 --> 02:42:12.065
The UPP are the unduplicated pupil percentages in the facilities.

02:42:12.505 --> 02:42:14.625
At the county level on Peel, just the opposite occurred.

02:42:15.166 --> 02:42:20.047
No findings regarding finances or facilities and findings only regarding the educational program.

02:42:20.527 --> 02:42:23.868
So now here we are at the state level dealing with a very narrow issue.

02:42:24.288 --> 02:42:26.048
Do lottery funds accrue in year one?

02:42:26.428 --> 02:42:29.609
I think we've submitted credible evidence that the answer is absolutely yes.

02:42:30.209 --> 02:42:32.370
I urge your support for Baypoint Preparatory Academy.

02:42:32.630 --> 02:42:33.190
Thank you very much.

02:42:42.503 --> 02:42:44.044
Good morning, board members and staff.

02:42:44.284 --> 02:42:45.785
Thank you for your service to our state.

02:42:45.905 --> 02:42:46.665
I'm Steve Nelson.

02:42:46.805 --> 02:42:53.529
This application is for a school in my community where my family and I have lived for 25 years and where I have my business.

02:42:54.389 --> 02:43:00.353
Our district has doubled in size over that time and is building new schools and yet has declining LCFF revenue.

02:43:00.853 --> 02:43:05.956
They're strapped for cash and now discussing things like eliminating PE teachers and class size ratios.

02:43:06.795 --> 02:43:28.405
We have hundreds of new homes in neighborhoods with new schools, three schools torn down and replaced with all new buildings, a high school for $150 million that holds 3,500 students and is now over capacity two years later, and an elementary school that will be converted for $63 million that holds over 1,100 students.

02:43:29.125 --> 02:43:34.268
The district staff claimed that Bay Point's budget overstated its future enrollment of underserved children.

02:43:35.325 --> 02:43:48.150
However, who better to provide the smaller scale focused attention and high expectations for underserved students than these leaders who have a stellar record over three years under the watchful eye of CDE staff.

02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:50.511
For our community, please approve the school.

02:43:51.292 --> 02:43:51.552
Thank you.

02:43:56.081 --> 02:44:01.145
I just want to speak on a couple of issues.

02:44:01.266 --> 02:44:03.127
First, I want to talk about the leadership of this school.

02:44:03.628 --> 02:44:04.749
Nancy is the superintendent.

02:44:04.829 --> 02:44:06.130
Frank is the president of the board.

02:44:06.510 --> 02:44:13.236
It is clear through their presentation that they know how to manage a school in multiple programs, especially one that is authorized under the state.

02:44:13.716 --> 02:44:19.178
They have shown through their academic success and their fiscal success that they know how to do this well.

02:44:19.618 --> 02:44:33.082
We're happy that they were able to show that they have different ways of meeting the state's requirements around their reserves and how they can do that through no cut to the actual services that are provided to students.

02:44:33.142 --> 02:44:40.445
So we know that they are able to do this program very well, and we look forward to the state supporting their school.

02:44:40.565 --> 02:44:41.165
Thank you so much.

02:44:45.839 --> 02:44:49.044
Hi, Angela de Ramos representing California Teachers Association.

02:44:49.325 --> 02:44:56.236
We urge the board to deny the petition based on the CDE's findings regarding the minimal fiscal reserves.

02:44:56.416 --> 02:44:56.677
Thank you.

02:45:01.917 --> 02:45:03.798
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

02:45:03.878 --> 02:45:05.918
This one should be a slam dunk.

02:45:06.759 --> 02:45:11.100
Another organization with a successful track record operationally, academically, financially.

02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:18.983
With respect to the reserves issue, I'm going to quote directly from the regulations that govern how you guys are supposed to review appeals.

02:45:19.083 --> 02:45:28.986
And it says, quote unquote, present a budget that in its totality appears viable over a period of no less than two years of operations provides for the amassing

02:45:29.699 --> 02:45:34.029
of a reserve equivalent to that required by law for a district of similar size.

02:45:34.651 --> 02:45:39.762
So what that essentially says is that over a two-year period that you get to the

02:45:40.723 --> 02:45:50.171
reserve level that districts are expected, even by CDE's numbers, which underestimate the revenues, they meet that requirement.

02:45:50.551 --> 02:46:04.702
And they exceeded and hit 9% reserve by year three, even using CDE's numbers, which we have heard are factually in error because they do not include the lottery, et cetera, funding that should be there.

02:46:04.782 --> 02:46:06.704
So here, I think you have a slam dunk.

02:46:07.585 --> 02:46:08.806
I urge you to approve.

02:46:08.946 --> 02:46:09.226
Thank you.

02:46:10.503 --> 02:46:17.824
Okay, I now declare the public hearing closed and I think we should have CDE come up and discuss this reserve issue.

02:46:23.957 --> 02:46:31.741
In terms of the lottery and the fundraising, those are typical, we typically do take that out when we're reviewing a fiscal analysis.

02:46:32.381 --> 02:46:40.565
So that, those are amounts that we do take out and then take a look at the budget and see if there are at least a 5% reserve.

02:46:41.006 --> 02:46:43.147
So that has been what we have continually done.

02:46:43.947 --> 02:46:46.769
And why would the lottery not come through?

02:46:46.789 --> 02:46:49.630
I don't, what is the grounds for that being uncertain?

02:46:52.077 --> 02:46:54.398
My understanding is that that comes through in year two.

02:46:54.418 --> 02:46:59.882
It actually just dawned on me what is going on here.

02:47:00.122 --> 02:47:02.263
This is a bit of a technical issue.

02:47:09.188 --> 02:47:17.654
You've heard the accountants and fiscal managers for the charter say they're using accrual basis.

02:47:19.175 --> 02:47:21.977
Governmental entities don't use accrual basis.

02:47:22.017 --> 02:47:23.758
They use modified accrual basis.

02:47:24.378 --> 02:47:25.839
That's what we use to look at this.

02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:31.683
We score the revenues when they are available, not when they're earned.

02:47:32.364 --> 02:47:37.027
They're doing accounting for the nonprofit.

02:47:37.588 --> 02:47:43.136
The laws for the nonprofit say you score the revenues when they are earned as opposed to when they are available.

02:47:43.336 --> 02:47:44.938
It is a bit of a technical issue.

02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:50.907
When we look at these projections, we care about

02:47:52.529 --> 02:47:54.730
They care about the economic condition.

02:47:54.810 --> 02:47:56.950
We care about the fiscal condition.

02:47:57.471 --> 02:48:00.051
So and particularly for the projection.

02:48:00.131 --> 02:48:16.996
So we want to see when the revenues are available to be spent versus what their expenditures are as opposed to, you know, generally the, you know, I'd say the economic value of the entity.

02:48:19.628 --> 02:48:30.344
And what do you make of Mr. Premack's assertion about two years in whatever he read from, I'm not sure what the source of that was.

02:48:31.212 --> 02:48:40.338
Yeah, I think it's just a matter of, for me, confidence.

02:48:41.298 --> 02:48:51.705
The first budget that was submitted contained a lot of errors in the way they were calculating revenues and other things like that.

02:48:52.325 --> 02:48:53.166
They came back.

02:48:54.647 --> 02:48:55.909
They made some adjustments.

02:48:56.929 --> 02:49:01.674
Looked like, you know, I saw a very close look at the adjustments they were making.

02:49:04.516 --> 02:49:16.927
They seemed reasonable, but still, given that the tightness of the budget, it didn't give me a strong sense of confidence that

02:49:18.049 --> 02:49:34.044
they would, that I could rely on the new set of books that they'd given us, given the closeness of the budget versus the errors that had been made in the first set of books they gave us.

02:49:34.084 --> 02:49:35.985
So that's kind of where.

02:49:37.136 --> 02:49:40.638
was a little bit maybe the tipping point for us on this.

02:49:40.759 --> 02:49:46.643
But it's just a level of confidence in what they're presenting.

02:49:47.143 --> 02:49:50.505
But you said they met the 5% in the second year.

02:49:51.766 --> 02:49:54.088
And what was the document he was quoting from?

02:49:54.208 --> 02:49:58.131
So I'm not sure you agree they met the 5% in the second year.

02:49:58.191 --> 02:50:01.413
And I'd like to know, was that law or I'm not familiar?

02:50:02.532 --> 02:50:03.072
It's law.

02:50:03.372 --> 02:50:03.612
OK.

02:50:04.013 --> 02:50:05.273
He was quoting from a law.

02:50:05.573 --> 02:50:06.293
Regulations?

02:50:06.333 --> 02:50:08.234
I think it's the regulations.

02:50:09.054 --> 02:50:09.254
What?

02:50:11.855 --> 02:50:14.596
Regulations are law.

02:50:15.656 --> 02:50:15.957
OK.

02:50:16.437 --> 02:50:18.317
They were official regulation.

02:50:18.337 --> 02:50:20.798
I believe so, but I'll check.

02:50:20.858 --> 02:50:20.918
OK.

02:50:23.939 --> 02:50:26.901
All right, I'm sorry, Board Member Holliday wants to get in on this, yeah.

02:50:27.041 --> 02:50:28.261
And then we'll go around, yeah.

02:50:28.862 --> 02:50:29.862
That's our liaison.

02:50:30.523 --> 02:50:32.244
Ask something from the petitioner.

02:50:33.004 --> 02:50:33.664
Oh, the petitioner?

02:50:33.705 --> 02:50:33.785
OK.

02:50:33.825 --> 02:50:34.205
Yes, please.

02:50:45.017 --> 02:50:51.042
We didn't run into this problem with the prior school in terms of the fiscal projection.

02:50:52.323 --> 02:51:05.394
But the fiscal projection that you had with the existing school in the end was the actual significantly above the original prediction?

02:51:05.414 --> 02:51:06.956
I believe so, yes.

02:51:07.896 --> 02:51:08.477
And secondly,

02:51:10.316 --> 02:51:14.060
A lot of this is based on enrollment, right?

02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:17.183
Enrollment is- Yeah, enrollment drives your revenue.

02:51:17.423 --> 02:51:17.784
Doesn't it?

02:51:20.086 --> 02:51:25.211
And so if this is a thin budget, it makes enrollment really important, right?

02:51:26.953 --> 02:51:28.014
Tell me about your enrollment.

02:51:28.875 --> 02:51:30.016
The projected enrollment

02:51:30.265 --> 02:51:35.490
Well, we're projecting 225 in each grade level, starting with TK through 6th grade.

02:51:35.691 --> 02:51:38.594
And as I said, we'll roll up to 7th and 8th in the following years.

02:51:39.134 --> 02:51:44.660
But that's why we put $10,000 in the budget to actively go out and recruit students in the area.

02:51:45.160 --> 02:51:48.584
Our signatures that we have, and that was the last slide, had 198 signatures.

02:51:50.906 --> 02:52:05.643
student represented signatures so that's close to the 200 we're looking without doing marketing and we targeted that community we went door to door knocking doors and talking about the options and what was there as well so we didn't go looking we haven't really done any

02:52:06.384 --> 02:52:32.215
promotion out in the community because we don't exist yet so that's what we're waiting for is to go out and have that opportunity and I realize what that revenues having been in it that the enrollment drives your revenue so and we've had to as you see as you might have noted on that previous slide that I had about our projected versus what the actuals were but yeah we were able to go back we do with the first interim and the second interim and final budget year and

02:52:32.535 --> 02:52:35.536
we go back and we re-evaluate where we are.

02:52:35.716 --> 02:52:39.617
And we have done that consistently over the last 13 years.

02:52:39.877 --> 02:52:46.580
I have with the schools and with Bay Point and Bayshore for the last eight, almost nine, or nine years now.

02:52:47.220 --> 02:52:50.121
And we run a lean, mean fighting machine if we have to.

02:52:50.241 --> 02:52:52.702
But our top priority is making sure

02:52:53.482 --> 02:52:55.323
that our academics are not impacted.

02:52:55.643 --> 02:53:03.607
And that's why in those slides I put so much of that data, not just so the whole school, but our economically disadvantaged, our ELs and our BED students.

02:53:03.667 --> 02:53:13.231
So we are really conscious of what that looks like and making sure that we can support our students and support our staff with the program that we implement.

02:53:13.431 --> 02:53:18.574
So in Hemet, the initial year of enrollment was successful.

02:53:19.011 --> 02:53:20.211
Yes, we projected 325.

02:53:21.072 --> 02:53:26.133
I think our P2 was a 260, I believe.

02:53:26.273 --> 02:53:28.234
So it was, you know, yeah.

02:53:28.334 --> 02:53:30.714
And our enrollment fluctuated around what it was.

02:53:30.774 --> 02:53:31.555
But it's the same thing.

02:53:31.855 --> 02:53:38.917
We had three months with our last school to go out and promote the school and to advertise that it was there.

02:53:39.037 --> 02:53:44.358
So it was really a struggle, because we lost people who initially had joined us, because it's a year process.

02:53:44.858 --> 02:53:45.438
I've been through that.

02:53:45.518 --> 02:53:47.439
I know how tricky that can be.

02:53:48.159 --> 02:54:05.750
But at the same time, even though you didn't quite make the projected enrollment attempt at the beginning, financially you were able to adjust to the point where you were successful and did not receive any sort of concern or warning from the CDE.

02:54:05.810 --> 02:54:06.370
Is that correct?

02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:07.111
No, correct.

02:54:08.331 --> 02:54:11.752
And you're prepared to make that kind of adjustment, of course, if necessary.

02:54:11.833 --> 02:54:12.433
Absolutely.

02:54:12.873 --> 02:54:25.437
And the communities are obviously different to a certain extent, but at the same time, you do have a little bit longer, if this were to be approved, you would have a little bit longer to do the marketing.

02:54:25.717 --> 02:54:26.058
Correct.

02:54:26.378 --> 02:54:27.058
Two extra months.

02:54:28.171 --> 02:54:29.191
that can be significant.

02:54:29.231 --> 02:54:30.192
Yes, definitely.

02:54:30.232 --> 02:54:38.014
And also it's all a time when when we were approved before in May, it's towards the end of the school year, and so we were really trying to recruit and promote our school during the summer.

02:54:38.494 --> 02:54:53.758
With this school, at least we have the, when people are at the end of the school year looking at options and changes and things, we have an opportunity not only to recruit students, but to recruit staff, qualified staff, because most people have already been hired, a lot of your good quality teachers have, so that's

02:54:54.799 --> 02:55:03.510
One of the concerns, obviously the department is not entirely comfortable with the financial situation.

02:55:03.790 --> 02:55:08.477
Would you be willing for the department to be closely monitoring that?

02:55:09.204 --> 02:55:10.605
Absolutely, I have no problem with that.

02:55:10.786 --> 02:55:26.340
We've always tried to be, ever since my coming in with Bayshore, when there was issues and there was contention with the district with San Marcos ready to shut the school down and very distrusting of what was going on, I've always felt that that's important, is to be open and honest and forthright about what's there.

02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:32.126
If there's a problem, I have no problem explaining that and seeking help, but so yeah, I'm absolutely.

02:55:32.446 --> 02:55:32.747
Thank you.

02:55:34.410 --> 02:55:37.978
Okay, Board Member Williams.

02:55:38.238 --> 02:55:43.830
Will this school be eligible to apply for public charter school grant funds and would you intend to do so?

02:55:44.417 --> 02:55:58.541
Yes, the PCSGP, they just opened that up on the 5th of March and the deadline is April 3rd, so Monday we sat in the training all day with the staff, CD staff about getting that and we've already had conversations with budget and how we're going to put that in our budget.

02:55:58.661 --> 02:56:03.403
Gentleman went to the meeting yes, Tuesday in Sacramento here in this room, so.

02:56:03.523 --> 02:56:07.704
And do you have any idea, did you apply for a certain amount or do you know what the amounts are?

02:56:08.224 --> 02:56:09.545
The amounts are different this year.

02:56:09.666 --> 02:56:10.746
It's a whole new structure.

02:56:10.827 --> 02:56:18.694
It's $475,000 for the initial grant and an additional $100,000 on the unduplicated numbers, but that's not based on where you reside.

02:56:18.734 --> 02:56:27.061
It's based on your population once you have your enrollment in C-BEDS day.

02:56:27.241 --> 02:56:29.143
If you were awarded that, when would that come in?

02:56:29.603 --> 02:56:30.204
When would you get it?

02:56:30.884 --> 02:56:33.687
It comes fairly quickly we have to we can start the way it's done.

02:56:33.707 --> 02:56:36.589
It's reverse reverse It's reimbursements.

02:56:36.649 --> 02:56:52.562
It's not initial up front So you have to you can start submitting any expenditures that you have starting April 5th So anything that we incur starting that date that is allowable under the grant we will start Expending those and then getting reimbursements submitting for those we have it's a very short window.

02:56:52.602 --> 02:56:53.163
We have to spend

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:57.748
Spent all the money by July of 2019, July 31st.

02:56:57.848 --> 02:56:59.731
So it's not the normal three years.

02:56:59.791 --> 02:57:04.537
It's a very like a one and a 15 month, one year and a half process for spending it.

02:57:04.557 --> 02:57:05.578
Okay, thank you.

02:57:06.639 --> 02:57:07.741
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:57:10.178 --> 02:57:11.659
This is, I guess, for the department.

02:57:11.979 --> 02:57:18.764
I'm actually looking at the dashboard, which is the new accountability system that we have, versus API.

02:57:19.364 --> 02:57:33.813
And one of the things that I'm looking at, just one indicator, ELA, and I see that maybe the schools, I'm looking at Bay Point, maybe it's doing better for some of the student subgroups relative to some of the neighboring schools.

02:57:34.433 --> 02:57:36.354
But internally, you have a lot of work to do.

02:57:37.294 --> 02:57:47.978
I see a pretty significant achievement gap between your Latino students and your white students, where your white students made a 14-point gain and your Latino students declined by 10.8 points.

02:57:50.419 --> 02:57:58.744
And for your English learners, I see that although a small number of students, they're also very low in terms of status.

02:57:59.264 --> 02:58:10.590
So that is concerning to me because once you start peeling back the data dashboard, the orange is really triggered by your Latino students and their numbers are pretty comparable to the numbers of white students, 79 and 70.

02:58:12.631 --> 02:58:30.320
So I would like us, as we're looking at providing support to our charter schools, that we're looking not only how they compare to the schools in the surrounding community, but how they're doing to serve the students that they have and prevent internal achievement gaps that are happening in both indicators.

02:58:30.380 --> 02:58:32.101
You see it in math and you see it in ELA.

02:58:32.421 --> 02:58:36.743
And I don't even have an ELP indicator that could just be the newness of the school.

02:58:37.284 --> 02:58:37.584
Thank you.

02:58:37.644 --> 02:58:38.404
That's a concern for me.

02:58:38.584 --> 02:58:38.804
Thanks.

02:58:41.599 --> 02:58:44.741
I just have a quick question for the petitioner and then I think for Nick.

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:48.222
I'm confused because the names are similar.

02:58:48.363 --> 02:58:55.706
Bayshore Preparatory Academy or school, is that authorized by San Marcos?

02:58:55.846 --> 02:58:56.347
Yes, it is.

02:58:56.527 --> 02:59:00.829
Okay, but they denied your petition for this school.

02:59:00.849 --> 02:59:02.570
They authorized it and renewed it in

02:59:03.210 --> 02:59:09.092
the year that I came in, 2010, and then they again unanimously renewed it in 2014.

02:59:09.692 --> 02:59:16.253
And when we presented before them, their concern was not about our academic or educational program at all.

02:59:16.333 --> 02:59:22.575
They basically, the one issue besides the location, you don't have a place, you have a name to where you're going to locate, which isn't required.

02:59:23.535 --> 02:59:28.778
was that they didn't think we could hit our 75% unduplicated numbers that we put in our budget.

02:59:29.178 --> 02:59:35.400
So they wanted us to reduce it down to what the district is, which is 40, and then they said, over the next few years, drop it by a point, 39, 38.

02:59:35.540 --> 02:59:44.885
And we said, well, at Bayshore, without recruiting, we've always been up between 50 to 60%, and that is our target audience who we're going for.

02:59:44.945 --> 02:59:47.946
So that's why we were denied at San Marcos.

02:59:48.882 --> 02:59:52.163
So that's actually my question then to Nick or to Lisa.

02:59:52.683 --> 03:00:05.628
When the budget came in, I don't know what their unduplicated count percentage was, but was that an initial concern of yours or do you think that their projections of unduplicated funding are realistic?

03:00:12.350 --> 03:00:18.492
I don't know that the issue was relative to their projected enrollment or their unduplicated count.

03:00:19.051 --> 03:00:26.476
I think it was just in the calculation of their LCFF funding was an issue for us.

03:00:26.516 --> 03:00:30.239
They seemed to be way off of what we had calculated.

03:00:30.339 --> 03:00:40.486
And it's a bit of a concern because we've got the FCMAT calculator out there that's easily accessible to all to use.

03:00:42.587 --> 03:00:53.289
Why they had gotten a very different calculation of that that we had gotten in using this calculator was a big concern.

03:00:53.309 --> 03:01:00.951
There are some other calculations that seem to have been in error as well in their original budget submittal.

03:01:01.231 --> 03:01:02.031
Including the grant.

03:01:02.371 --> 03:01:06.732
Including the grant funds that we didn't know if that was going to be accounted for.

03:01:06.772 --> 03:01:07.292
Mr. President.

03:01:09.353 --> 03:01:10.093
I'm sorry, were you finished?

03:01:12.858 --> 03:01:20.154
I said including the federal grant funds because those weren't aren't guaranteed as well initially they had included those in the budget also.

03:01:21.451 --> 03:01:24.994
the federal grant, the Pacific, I'm sorry, the public charter school grant funds.

03:01:25.074 --> 03:01:26.816
Yeah.

03:01:26.856 --> 03:01:32.782
Did you have a chance to look at the, I want to go back to this question on whether they satisfied the regulation.

03:01:32.962 --> 03:01:39.428
Did you have a chance to look, can you give me an answer yes or no as to whether they did, there is a regulation.

03:01:39.868 --> 03:01:44.913
Did you agree that they satisfied the regulation by saying they'd be at 5% in the second year?

03:01:45.589 --> 03:01:47.290
I'd say there is a regulation.

03:01:48.211 --> 03:01:49.973
They satisfied on paper.

03:01:50.013 --> 03:01:55.597
I'm not sure how confident I am that that that that can be relied upon.

03:01:56.318 --> 03:01:56.658
Okay.

03:01:56.738 --> 03:01:57.078
Thank you.

03:01:57.098 --> 03:01:58.259
It's the bottom line there.

03:02:00.581 --> 03:02:01.402
Board Member Holliday.

03:02:02.162 --> 03:02:02.503
Thank you.

03:02:04.925 --> 03:02:10.749
So I So I do think that

03:02:12.273 --> 03:02:18.417
This school is capable of meeting their fiscal responsibility.

03:02:18.457 --> 03:02:22.339
And I do think the educational program is a value to the community.

03:02:22.779 --> 03:02:27.582
And I do think that we have a track record of reasonable, if not good, success.

03:02:28.542 --> 03:02:32.144
I do appreciate the department's fiscal concerns.

03:02:32.585 --> 03:02:36.187
And I certainly would like to try to help alleviate

03:02:37.128 --> 03:02:50.925
those concerns by offering a motion to approve this charter school but with a condition I have a written motion if it would be proper at this point to pass it out to the member to the board members

03:02:59.931 --> 03:03:01.832
While he's passing that out, can I make a comment?

03:03:02.553 --> 03:03:03.293
Yes.

03:03:03.714 --> 03:03:14.962
I think the fact also that we've already authorized one charter in this CMO and that they have been functioning well operationally and fiscally and academically.

03:03:16.082 --> 03:03:31.265
And I'm impressed with the leadership of the group, the CMO, in terms of how data-driven she is and how much data she has and how they analyze it, both budget and otherwise.

03:03:32.145 --> 03:03:40.827
And so I'm going to be supporting the motion that Member Holliday is proposing.

03:03:41.670 --> 03:04:01.701
If you have a copy it says to approve the Bay Point petition with the technical amendments identified by the CDE in the petition review form and with the condition that Bay Point agrees to provide quarterly operational data to the CDE demonstrating the actions Bay Point is taking to achieve at least a 5% reserve by the beginning of the 19-20 school year.

03:04:02.081 --> 03:04:03.281
And I would second that motion.

03:04:07.383 --> 03:04:08.664
It's been moved and seconded.

03:04:08.804 --> 03:04:10.165
Any further board discussion?

03:04:11.639 --> 03:04:12.019
Yes.

03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:14.200
Pardon?

03:04:14.821 --> 03:04:15.401
Mr. Price.

03:04:15.421 --> 03:04:28.347
Yeah, I'd just like to ask Deputy Schweitzer to comment on this as far as the timing of the quarterly reports and indicate whether you believe this would provide greater levels of confidence.

03:04:30.975 --> 03:04:31.355
Sure.

03:04:31.856 --> 03:04:52.882
Certainly, we do, you know, of course, over the schools that we oversee, we do regularly check in with them on their fiscal condition, but yeah, this is probably, we do, what, three times a year this, so this would be an additional

03:04:54.642 --> 03:05:08.295
I mean and you know certainly if the board were to approve this school we would probably be looking at it more closely anyway just as that's that's our responsibility for for overseeing these schools so.

03:05:11.619 --> 03:05:11.879
Okay.

03:05:14.175 --> 03:05:14.975
Board Member Valdez.

03:05:15.655 --> 03:05:15.976
Thank you.

03:05:16.236 --> 03:05:17.396
I have a question for staff.

03:05:17.496 --> 03:05:24.438
So it sounds like when the school in San Mar- well, let's go back to Hemet.

03:05:24.458 --> 03:05:33.361
When the school in Hemet was opened, you under projected the unduplicated count because that district has about 83% unduplicated count.

03:05:33.401 --> 03:05:34.061
You came in about 70.

03:05:35.281 --> 03:05:46.846
And I'm just concerned that San Marcos was saying, based on their numbers and knowing that they asked that you be at about 45% unduplicated count, was that correct?

03:05:47.166 --> 03:05:47.346
Or 40%?

03:05:48.507 --> 03:05:52.689
And you're coming in at 75.

03:05:53.529 --> 03:06:04.274
And so I want to ask staff, are we comfortable with this based on what number of unduplicated count to get to be solvent in 20, if that makes sense?

03:06:09.006 --> 03:06:13.048
because you underestimated in Hemet and you're overestimating in San Marcos.

03:06:13.068 --> 03:06:14.369
So that's just my question.

03:06:14.429 --> 03:06:16.430
What's the margin of error?

03:06:31.747 --> 03:06:41.511
We, I'm sorry, we don't really have an answer to that right now, but it is something is if if the board were to approve this, we'd have to carefully monitor that.

03:06:44.532 --> 03:06:45.392
Board Member Rucker.

03:06:46.853 --> 03:06:50.694
Board Member Holiday, I just wanted to make sure I understood the motion.

03:06:51.275 --> 03:06:58.017
So if the board approves this petition, the school would open in the beginning of the 18-19 school year.

03:07:01.431 --> 03:07:01.911
Correct?

03:07:02.972 --> 03:07:14.839
And so the regulations say that they have to, that they should, the goal is that they get to the 5% reserve by the end of the second year of operation.

03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:27.827
If I'm reading this motion correctly, it says that they would need to achieve at least a 5% reserve by the beginning of their second year of operation, 19-20.

03:07:28.428 --> 03:07:30.369
Is that what you meant to do?

03:07:35.734 --> 03:07:38.215
I believe this is what the MOU states, doesn't it?

03:07:40.295 --> 03:07:43.616
I thought it said it'd be by the end of the second year of operation.

03:07:43.776 --> 03:07:45.957
No, I'm sorry, you're talking about the regulation?

03:07:46.297 --> 03:07:46.557
Yeah.

03:07:46.637 --> 03:07:54.339
I'm talking about the MOU that the department has used with state board authorized charter schools in the past.

03:07:54.619 --> 03:07:54.999
Okay.

03:07:55.219 --> 03:07:56.900
And that is what it says, correct?

03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:01.081
By the beginning of the second year of operation.

03:08:09.389 --> 03:08:12.331
So the MOU states that it's- Please identify yourself.

03:08:12.411 --> 03:08:15.013
I'm sorry, Judy Hall, Administrator, Charter Schools Division.

03:08:15.914 --> 03:08:16.434
Apologize.

03:08:16.994 --> 03:08:27.522
So the MOU states that we're expecting 5% based on the LCFF entitlement, the full entitlement, and that it's not stipulated by year.

03:08:28.082 --> 03:08:32.525
So it's beginning with the entitlement when that entitlement's actually received.

03:08:34.332 --> 03:08:49.426
When the, so, right, so when you get your LCFF, based on prior year, this is a new school year, so that won't come until mid-year after PENCECT and 20-day are fully established.

03:08:49.946 --> 03:09:00.716
Then we bill based on P1, whatever that count is, that's the entitlement, and then we go back at P2 and adjust the billing, either up or down.

03:09:05.376 --> 03:09:05.596
Right.

03:09:07.377 --> 03:09:07.637
Right.

03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:25.565
So if we were to approve this motion, they would need to end their first fiscal year with a 5% reserve, which means it's hitting all of the targets that they're saying they're going to hit.

03:09:26.465 --> 03:09:28.866
My question is, what if they don't?

03:09:30.307 --> 03:09:30.927
What if they don't?

03:09:31.502 --> 03:09:46.500
That is where I was going because what this doesn't say and what this doesn't contemplate based on the fact that they may be overestimating what their LCFF unduplicated count may be,

03:09:47.080 --> 03:10:03.623
based on the advice from the district, they may be overestimating what their actual revenues should be by the end of the first year of operation, given the fact they didn't meet their target in their other school at their first year of operation.

03:10:05.586 --> 03:10:13.670
But what they did meet is their fiscal responsibility and a clean budget in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth years.

03:10:14.551 --> 03:10:18.413
And they did not have any fiscal insolvency or problem.

03:10:18.673 --> 03:10:25.537
And the question of what would happen if they don't meet it, it's the same question that we face every time you start up a charter school.

03:10:26.057 --> 03:10:31.800
It's a question we face always and every authorizer faces, every charter school leader faces.

03:10:32.260 --> 03:10:34.041
You either make the budget or you're in trouble.

03:10:34.819 --> 03:10:58.767
And what we're trying to do here with this motion is to adhere to the department's MOU process and not change that, but at the same time encourage or ask that the CDE monitor this very closely with the intent that should things start to look

03:10:59.487 --> 03:11:09.952
different than what was projected that the CDE could provide technical support, advice, counsel in ways that would help the charter school sort it out and be successful.

03:11:17.119 --> 03:11:31.502
In addition, on the PowerPoint, it was made very, by the petitioner, it was made very clear that they do pretty, pay a lot of attention to budget analysis with projections and actuals, projections and actuals.

03:11:32.163 --> 03:11:46.506
And one of the things that I heard the petitioner say was when they see, you know, a budget is a plan, and the plans don't always exactly work out, and so you have to right-size your organization to what is actually happening.

03:11:47.026 --> 03:11:49.588
And what I heard is that they are very good at right sizing.

03:11:50.429 --> 03:12:03.519
In particular, she said that they always make sure when they need to make any adjustments that they do them with a priority of protecting the student and the instructional program first and find other ways to make those adjustments.

03:12:03.579 --> 03:12:06.942
So I think they're actually very savvy at what they do fiscally.

03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:11.630
Okay, Board Member Holliday.

03:12:11.650 --> 03:12:12.891
Do we have a motion second?

03:12:13.051 --> 03:12:15.872
Okay, all right.

03:12:15.952 --> 03:12:20.515
Call the question or those in favor of approving the charter petition, raise your hands.

03:12:22.716 --> 03:12:24.317
Those opposed, raise your hands.

03:12:24.697 --> 03:12:26.278
Okay, it carries.

03:12:26.818 --> 03:12:29.319
I'm one abstention, two no votes, one abstention.

03:12:29.399 --> 03:12:30.640
It carries with six votes.

03:12:34.674 --> 03:12:35.254
Abstain.

03:12:35.414 --> 03:12:35.714
OK.

03:12:36.655 --> 03:12:36.975
All right.

03:12:37.875 --> 03:12:38.215
Lunch?

03:12:40.196 --> 03:12:43.037
OK.

03:12:43.097 --> 03:12:44.358
We will resume.

03:12:47.679 --> 03:12:48.760
We're going to get our lunch.

03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:51.121
And we're going to bring it back.

03:12:51.461 --> 03:12:51.641
No, 1250.

03:12:51.741 --> 03:12:52.201
What?

03:12:52.521 --> 03:12:54.582
So we need to be back here at 1230.

03:13:02.847 --> 03:13:07.408
Well, we underestimated the time.

03:13:07.888 --> 03:13:09.009
There was no opposition.

03:13:12.089 --> 03:13:13.870
The Board will reconvene at 1230.

03:13:16.030 --> 03:13:31.074
Okay, the State Board will reconvene and we will now hear on item 22, the Middle School Mesa Spring Valley Appeals from San Diego County.

03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:57.877
Okay, item number 22 is the appeal by College Prep Middle School to establish a new charter school.

03:14:00.097 --> 03:14:14.121
Pursuant to Ed Code Section J1, petitioners for a charter school that had been denied at the local level may petition the school board for the State Board of Education for approval of the charter subject to certain conditions.

03:14:15.061 --> 03:14:21.583
June 30th, 2017, La Mesa Spring Valley School District voted to deny the petition by a vote of four to zero.

03:14:22.303 --> 03:14:28.625
October 11th, 2017, San Diego County Board of Education voted to deny the petition with a vote of three to two.

03:14:29.625 --> 03:14:34.248
November 22nd, College Prep submitted a petition on appeal to the State Board of Education.

03:14:37.290 --> 03:14:41.814
College Prep was previously authorized by Mountain Empire Unified School District.

03:14:42.934 --> 03:14:54.602
They voluntarily closed under Mountain Empire on June 30th, 2017, which is the same date in which they were denied their petition with La Mesa Spring Valley.

03:14:56.283 --> 03:14:59.385
The petition currently before you is for College Prep Middle School.

03:14:59.486 --> 03:15:01.627
It's for that same school.

03:15:02.708 --> 03:15:09.912
They are located in La Mesa and will be for the first part of 2018-19 if they're authorized to open in 18-19.

03:15:10.373 --> 03:15:14.715
And they'll move to a newly constructed site in Spring Valley for the second half of the year.

03:15:15.176 --> 03:15:19.178
But both of those locations are within the La Mesa-Spring Valley school district boundaries.

03:15:20.339 --> 03:15:25.784
The petitioner was also approved for a second school under Mountain Empire.

03:15:26.444 --> 03:15:28.646
That one is College Prep East County.

03:15:28.947 --> 03:15:37.114
It is currently open and is at the former College Prep site, but they will be moving to the location in Acampo in 18-19 school year.

03:15:41.505 --> 03:15:45.946
I tried to explain that, but if there's any other questions as we go through, if that didn't make sense to everyone.

03:15:46.847 --> 03:15:50.308
The proposed grade levels are 5.8, and it is a site-based program.

03:15:50.488 --> 03:15:59.130
The targeted enrollment is 240 for the 18-19 school year, increasing to 500 by the 2022-23 school year.

03:15:59.751 --> 03:16:07.013
They're planning to serve pupils from the La Mesa Spring Valley School District and surrounding communities in East San Diego County.

03:16:08.752 --> 03:16:15.277
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7, 2018, and moved to recommend approval of the petition.

03:16:15.938 --> 03:16:18.980
Four commissioners voted in favor, three voted against.

03:16:19.080 --> 03:16:26.506
There was not five votes to move the recommendation forward to the State Board of Education, so no recommendation has been moved.

03:16:27.267 --> 03:16:32.351
The petitioner did submit additional information that after the ACCS meeting that the staff did review.

03:16:34.648 --> 03:16:42.831
And after the review, the CDE recommends that the state board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish College Prep Middle School on a five-year term.

03:16:43.472 --> 03:16:56.097
The recommendation is based on demonstratively likely to implement the program due to realistic financial and operational plan and a sound educational practice and comprehensive description of most of the required charter elements in the petition.

03:16:56.777 --> 03:16:59.078
And I'm here and available for any questions that you may have.

03:17:00.455 --> 03:17:04.837
Okay, are there any technical questions on this proposal at this point?

03:17:05.197 --> 03:17:06.118
Board Member Strauss.

03:17:06.778 --> 03:17:10.399
Could you clarify, so this closed and now they want to reopen under a different?

03:17:10.419 --> 03:17:11.040
Correct.

03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:11.880
Could you just clarify that?

03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:27.027
Sure, they were authorized under Mountain Empire and then sought to, because they are physically located in La Mesa in their school boundaries, they sought to get a petition approved through La Mesa Spring Valley.

03:17:27.447 --> 03:17:34.313
So they were denied by La Mesa Spring Valley and they closed under Mountain Empire on the same day, on June 30th, 2017.

03:17:35.434 --> 03:17:48.246
So right now they are not authorized by La Mesa or by Mountain Empire, which is why they did also then go to the County Office of Education seeking petition there and were denied there, which is why they're now before the State Board of Education.

03:17:48.406 --> 03:17:51.429
The only thing, we've had other situations like this where they

03:17:52.169 --> 03:17:53.610
Why did they close?

03:17:53.631 --> 03:17:54.011
Do you know?

03:17:54.171 --> 03:17:57.794
Why didn't they just stay open and continue the appeal process?

03:17:57.914 --> 03:18:08.983
From what I understand, and they are here to speak to this, but they did want to seek authorization under La Mesa because they are physically located within the boundaries of the La Mesa School District.

03:18:12.466 --> 03:18:14.627
This is related to the Shasta decision?

03:18:14.868 --> 03:18:15.548
No, not.

03:18:15.828 --> 03:18:17.790
No, it's not a resource center.

03:18:20.464 --> 03:18:21.804
It is a site-based program.

03:18:23.165 --> 03:18:26.165
But they did want, yes, they did want to seek authorization where they are.

03:18:27.866 --> 03:18:28.206
Correct.

03:18:31.066 --> 03:18:32.427
Any other technical questions?

03:18:34.007 --> 03:18:36.727
If not, I'm going to declare the public hearing open.

03:18:36.847 --> 03:18:38.588
Each side will have 10 minutes.

03:18:39.868 --> 03:18:48.970
And so I want to start then with the groups that are in support of the petition and the CDE recommendation to approve.

03:18:55.708 --> 03:18:57.177
Thank you.

03:19:07.301 --> 03:19:10.782
All set, all set.

03:19:10.902 --> 03:19:11.662
I need these now.

03:19:12.743 --> 03:19:13.843
Good afternoon, board members.

03:19:13.983 --> 03:19:21.145
I'm petitioner Christina Calloway, and on behalf of all of us here representing College Prep Middle School, La Mesa Spring Valley, we thank you for hearing our appeal.

03:19:22.226 --> 03:19:27.867
Also, we'd like to thank the CDE staff for the time and attention that they gave in their careful and thorough review of our charter petition.

03:19:28.447 --> 03:19:36.990
We've always been so fortunate to have surrounded ourselves with a talented and supportive group of people, some of which are here today to speak about our program and help to answer any questions that you might have.

03:19:39.773 --> 03:19:47.742
The educational program outlined in the charter before you does not merely propose a hypothetical program that would be implemented in a not yet existing school.

03:19:48.262 --> 03:19:58.133
Rather, if granted, the charter will allow the continuation of an educational program that has been in practice for eight years with a proven track record in a community that we already serve.

03:19:58.934 --> 03:20:14.853
The goal of our educational program is to promote students to high school who are on the path to college and career, students who are prepared for the rigors of high school and beyond, who don't require remediation and are able to choose from the highest level of core course offerings and college preparatory electives available to them.

03:20:16.027 --> 03:20:22.514
Our academic program is centered on mastery of foundational skills in literacy and mathematics and in the core content areas of social studies and science.

03:20:23.275 --> 03:20:30.482
Frequent assessment is used to inform our curricular decisions, monitor student progress, and identify students that might need additional supports.

03:20:31.303 --> 03:20:35.506
There's tremendous demand and need in the La Mesa Spring Valley community for a high-performing charter school.

03:20:35.987 --> 03:20:58.244
We wish to continue to provide that educational choice to a community that overwhelmingly wants choice, as indicated by the almost 300 letters of support that we provided to you from our community members, elected officials, families and friends, including many of our alumni, who we're really proud to say are now attending our local community colleges, universities all over the country, and even a student at Stanford, to name a few.

03:20:59.125 --> 03:21:03.567
We wish to carry on the tradition of success we started in La Mesa with our first charter in 2010.

03:21:05.728 --> 03:21:06.749
I love putting up this picture.

03:21:06.789 --> 03:21:12.591
This is a picture of Mr. Miller and me in 2013 on the day that we learned that our API at CPMS was an amazing 941.

03:21:12.671 --> 03:21:14.972
I always look and say, we were so young.

03:21:16.293 --> 03:21:19.274
Making us the third highest ranking middle school in San Diego County.

03:21:19.795 --> 03:21:26.738
In addition to the successful academic program that is consistent with sound educational practice, we offer a strong team of experienced personnel.

03:21:27.358 --> 03:21:29.960
Mr. Miller, who you see there, is our director of school operations.

03:21:30.321 --> 03:21:35.305
He has almost 20 years of experience working in the fields of education and family and child mental health services.

03:21:35.745 --> 03:21:44.212
He's worked for Child Protective Services, County Mental Health, Autism Support Services, and as a school psychologist and administrator at the middle school level.

03:21:44.833 --> 03:21:52.999
Mr. Miller holds an administrative services credential, a pupil personnel services credential, a master's in educational psychology, and is a certified school psychologist.

03:21:53.920 --> 03:21:55.201
I'm the director of school business.

03:21:55.381 --> 03:21:58.123
I'm responsible for the majority of our back office for the school.

03:21:58.523 --> 03:22:03.986
I do all of our required state and county reporting, including the maintenance of our CalPETS data, et cetera.

03:22:04.627 --> 03:22:06.828
I supervise staff and provide instructional support.

03:22:07.288 --> 03:22:15.393
I have a single subject teaching credential in biology, an administrative services credential, a pupil personnel services credential, and a master's degree in educational counseling.

03:22:15.974 --> 03:22:22.478
Forever a student and wanting to grow, I recently completed the school business manager certificate program at the University of Southern California.

03:22:23.239 --> 03:22:25.142
I, along with Mr. Miller, run our school every day.

03:22:25.203 --> 03:22:30.193
We fill in where needed and you'll always see us in the parking lot directing traffic mornings and afternoons.

03:22:31.943 --> 03:22:36.867
Historically, our scores on the CASP assessments have consistently outranked state, county, and local averages.

03:22:37.447 --> 03:22:42.491
We've been informed that we are ranked 67th out of 2,508 middle schools in the state.

03:22:42.911 --> 03:22:43.632
Pretty proud of that.

03:22:44.332 --> 03:22:52.418
In other measures, we've also shown that we can achieve success in all the state priority areas, including parent involvement, student engagement, and school climate, to name a few.

03:22:53.039 --> 03:22:58.523
In the new accountability system, we are proud to have achieved the highest rating of performance across all the state indicators.

03:23:00.492 --> 03:23:09.936
Our educational program is designed to help and serve all students, low-achieving, high-achieving, English learners, students with disabilities, students from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, and all others.

03:23:10.476 --> 03:23:22.141
Our recruitment plan outlined in our charter is specifically tailored to attract students from all walks of life, and we are confident that it, along with the opportunity to grow our enrollment, will lead to a diverse pool of interested students.

03:23:24.008 --> 03:23:26.791
On the business side of things, we've always run a fiscally sound operation.

03:23:27.231 --> 03:23:33.897
We have seven years of successful independent audits and have maintained a positive fund balance for all the years of our operation.

03:23:34.598 --> 03:23:38.642
Each year our board has been committed to building a healthy reserve with an eye towards growing our program.

03:23:40.851 --> 03:23:44.832
Our charter budget also reflects our strategic goals for the future when it comes to our school site.

03:23:45.312 --> 03:23:48.113
We've done extensive due diligence for the school's new facility.

03:23:48.573 --> 03:24:01.116
We engaged a turnkey school facilities developer with years of experience acquiring and constructing charter school campuses in California and across the nation to help ensure that our plans for our new facility are solid and that our goals are attainable.

03:24:01.716 --> 03:24:11.083
The costs for the new facility are well within commercial market ranges for financing and construction of this type and are reflected in our charter school's projected budget.

03:24:12.064 --> 03:24:16.087
Our project comes in at a fraction of the per-pupil cost for other new schools in our county.

03:24:16.747 --> 03:24:22.830
This is an architect's rendering of our proposed new state-of-the-art ADA-compliant facility located at Madrid Way in Spring Valley.

03:24:23.310 --> 03:24:26.732
The project was unanimously approved by the San Diego County Planning Commission.

03:24:27.092 --> 03:24:35.055
The two-story building will have e-occupancy and will be approximately 27,000 square feet and equipped with modern amenities for a state-of-the-art 21st century middle school.

03:24:35.596 --> 03:24:42.158
We intend to exercise our right to purchase the project in a few years and have been exploring the eventual financing of the purchase with tax-exempt bonds.

03:24:42.599 --> 03:24:45.180
We are already talking with a major underwriter in that regard.

03:24:46.061 --> 03:24:52.833
Our largest barrier to serving more students has been the capacity at our current temporary facility, which only will allow 240 students.

03:24:53.434 --> 03:24:58.443
The new construction will address our facility issues and allow us to serve more students, including those on our wait list.

03:25:00.211 --> 03:25:03.573
Again, we appreciate the opportunity to present ourselves and our program to you today.

03:25:03.834 --> 03:25:06.255
We believe we're a great example of the Charter School Act.

03:25:06.695 --> 03:25:10.858
Our family supports us, our family support us, my mom supports me, right?

03:25:10.938 --> 03:25:11.999
Our family supports us.

03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:16.122
Our staff supports us and the community supports us.

03:25:16.782 --> 03:25:20.625
We have a wait list of over 130 students currently and it grows every year.

03:25:20.645 --> 03:25:26.249
And in these past eight years, we think we've done exactly the kind of work that you would be so very proud of.

03:25:26.829 --> 03:25:30.473
Please look at our track record and our likelihood of continued success.

03:25:30.833 --> 03:25:36.418
Your support will help us to continue our tradition of excellence and expand our ability to serve even more students of our community.

03:25:37.119 --> 03:25:44.887
I want to take the opportunity again to thank you on behalf of all of our families and supporters, those here with us today and those working hard back in San Diego.

03:25:45.327 --> 03:25:58.173
And speaking of working hard back in San Diego, I have to share with you that today, one of our sixth graders was representing us at the San Diego County Spelling Bee, and all of our seventh graders are out on San Diego Bay experiencing hands-on science with the Floating Sea Lab.

03:25:58.693 --> 03:26:04.175
So speaking of back home, we're a really busy place, here's a brief video from our campus.

03:26:04.236 --> 03:26:05.096
And again, thank you.

03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:24.841
I am college prep.

03:26:25.741 --> 03:26:27.062
I am college prep.

03:26:27.763 --> 03:26:29.644
I am college prep.

03:26:30.265 --> 03:26:31.846
I am college prep.

03:26:32.547 --> 03:26:34.708
I need college prep.

03:26:35.389 --> 03:26:37.991
I'm not college prep.

03:26:38.371 --> 03:26:40.152
I am college prep.

03:26:40.793 --> 03:26:42.114
I am college prep.

03:26:43.515 --> 03:26:45.357
I am college prep.

03:26:45.838 --> 03:26:46.960
I am college prep.

03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:48.342
I am college prep.

03:27:19.594 --> 03:27:27.783
Okay, that concludes the presentation on this side and so we will now turn to the opponents of the petition.

03:27:32.188 --> 03:27:33.570
District and County officials.

03:27:49.858 --> 03:27:50.579
Good afternoon.

03:27:52.440 --> 03:27:53.941
I'm Dr. Emma Turner.

03:27:54.021 --> 03:28:01.047
I'm immediate past president of the LaMesa Spring Valley School Board and also I'm the current clerk.

03:28:02.208 --> 03:28:11.896
I'm here today to support our decision and the decision of San Diego County Office of Education to deny the petition from College Prep.

03:28:13.978 --> 03:28:16.440
The charter has been denied four times

03:28:17.318 --> 03:28:20.060
by two local educational agencies in San Diego.

03:28:20.801 --> 03:28:29.107
And any approval by the State Board of Education now would be detrimental to local control.

03:28:30.568 --> 03:28:36.553
We were thoughtful and very inclusive in making our decision about College Prep.

03:28:36.913 --> 03:28:43.358
We gave them every opportunity to correct glaring deficiencies around their proposed finances.

03:28:45.140 --> 03:28:48.242
double student count, and other serious matters you have before you.

03:28:49.783 --> 03:28:53.065
College prep does not serve all students.

03:28:53.786 --> 03:29:00.190
And comparing it to the La Mesa Spring Valley School is not accurate.

03:29:01.250 --> 03:29:03.392
It's like comparing apples and oranges.

03:29:03.452 --> 03:29:04.412
Here are some examples.

03:29:07.674 --> 03:29:11.697
College prep requires families to purchase uniforms.

03:29:14.582 --> 03:29:16.443
This is a requirement in order to attend the school.

03:29:16.883 --> 03:29:22.925
And the proposal allows two of the highest paid administrators to remove students at will.

03:29:27.146 --> 03:29:31.788
It does not serve the same demographics of the community in which it's located now.

03:29:37.555 --> 03:29:51.145
And contrary to some statements that's been said, we at La Mesa Spring Valley, we welcome and we embrace charter schools that operate lawfully and that are in compliance with the authorizer's oversight.

03:29:52.729 --> 03:29:59.615
For example, we just recently approved the petition of a charter school.

03:30:00.215 --> 03:30:04.779
They were very transparent, they were cooperative, and they worked with us.

03:30:05.239 --> 03:30:08.782
They had some discrepancies that they had to correct also, but they did so.

03:30:12.045 --> 03:30:29.871
So as a local public official elected to ensure public schools within La Mesa Spring Valley's boundaries are operating lawfully and serving all kids, I respectfully request that you deny the college prep petition based on the deficiencies noted in our denial.

03:30:30.331 --> 03:30:41.515
If college prep submitted additional documents for your consideration on this appeal, we have not been given access to them, even though we've requested.

03:30:42.697 --> 03:30:50.488
And therefore, I also respectfully request that those documents not be considered in your deliberations.

03:30:51.129 --> 03:30:52.411
Thank you for letting me speak.

03:30:56.616 --> 03:30:57.216
Good afternoon.

03:30:57.236 --> 03:30:58.277
I'm Kristen Armitas.

03:30:58.377 --> 03:31:00.438
I am from the San Diego County Office of Education.

03:31:00.538 --> 03:31:03.280
I serve as the consultant in business advisory services.

03:31:04.101 --> 03:31:06.662
So we had very similar findings as the district.

03:31:07.022 --> 03:31:16.949
We also showed the uniforms and that there were disciplinary actions that could be taken against students for not wearing uniforms or for lost materials.

03:31:17.549 --> 03:31:19.350
suspension and expulsion procedures.

03:31:20.210 --> 03:31:33.518
That was also an issue for us, so they did not provide manifestation determinations for special education students and also failed to explain the process for a student to appeal that decision.

03:31:35.045 --> 03:31:40.209
Racial and ethnic balance, so again, they are not serving the same student population as the school district currently is.

03:31:40.870 --> 03:31:42.871
So low socioeconomic and English learners.

03:31:43.712 --> 03:31:47.394
Low socioeconomic, La Mesa Spring Valley District is a 60% percentage.

03:31:48.595 --> 03:31:51.257
And English learners is 20% for that district.

03:31:51.617 --> 03:31:56.161
And college prep on the other side is 37% low socioeconomic and only 2% English learners.

03:31:59.943 --> 03:32:04.985
But where the county office really has found some very significant concern is on the financial projections.

03:32:05.705 --> 03:32:14.389
So the majority of their budget was based off of a $1.5 million beginning fund balance, which was to come from the college prep middle school that closed.

03:32:15.663 --> 03:32:19.704
In between this time, they've also opened and established College Prep Middle School East County.

03:32:20.164 --> 03:32:26.526
And in that petition, that $1.5 million was also named as a beginning balance for that charter school, which is operational this fiscal year.

03:32:26.966 --> 03:32:34.988
So it's still unclear to us whether or not that $1.5 million is even available for the La Mesa Spring Valley Charter to access.

03:32:36.148 --> 03:32:50.674
And in addition to that, the land agreement or the lease agreement that they have entered into is highly reliant on student ADA counts in those first few years, which currently they've been at about 230, 240 students.

03:32:50.714 --> 03:32:52.074
They have a target of 500.

03:32:52.694 --> 03:32:56.376
Doesn't seem like that is a reasonable expectation at this point.

03:32:57.375 --> 03:33:03.081
And they are also highly reliant on the charter schools facility grant funds to move forward with those payments.

03:33:03.161 --> 03:33:11.631
The lease payment that they're currently making is $180,000, and that soars in year three to $941,000 under this new proposed agreement.

03:33:12.291 --> 03:33:14.333
So those are the findings that the county office had.

03:33:14.414 --> 03:33:17.397
And with that, I will turn it back over to LaMesa Spring Valley.

03:33:18.746 --> 03:33:19.386
Well, good afternoon.

03:33:19.406 --> 03:33:20.226
My name is Brian Marshall.

03:33:20.247 --> 03:33:21.967
I'm superintendent of La Mesa Spring Valley Schools.

03:33:21.987 --> 03:33:27.169
I've been superintendent in the district for 15 years, been in public education now 29 years.

03:33:27.869 --> 03:33:30.950
Why would La Mesa not approve such a high-performing school?

03:33:31.410 --> 03:33:39.113
Because you can't deny the achievement of the students there, although you can question the demographics, which we'll get into, but certainly the students do have high achievement.

03:33:39.953 --> 03:33:44.935
Why would La Mesa Spring Valley not want to embrace that school and bring it into

03:33:46.358 --> 03:33:46.759
district.

03:33:47.279 --> 03:33:55.024
They were operating in the district since 2010 under a charter in Mountain Empire that was, after the Shasta decision, illegal.

03:33:55.684 --> 03:33:59.227
That's why they had to get a subsequent petition.

03:33:59.247 --> 03:34:03.370
That's why they closed the first school, opened the second school, College Prep East County.

03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:11.955
They're now operating in the exact same location as was mentioned under an exemption because they're building facility up in the Campo area in Mountain Empire.

03:34:12.276 --> 03:34:15.558
So why would La Mesa Spring Valley not go for this twice?

03:34:16.959 --> 03:34:17.619
Several reasons.

03:34:18.259 --> 03:34:21.821
The first of them has to be the demographic group that they serve.

03:34:22.602 --> 03:34:41.613
When I asked College Prep in 2015 about their demographics, I got a very flippant response, which I included in my documents to you, I hope you received the three letters that we sent, our documents to you where Petitioner Calloway stated, well, there is no College Prep La Mesa Spring Valley yet, so there can be no demographic differences.

03:34:42.333 --> 03:34:50.639
But that petition was written to transform the existing College Prep Middle School to the College Prep Middle School in the Mesa Spring Valley.

03:34:50.659 --> 03:34:52.060
So there were demographic differences.

03:34:52.100 --> 03:34:53.240
It was just going to be a transition.

03:34:53.841 --> 03:35:04.308
The second thing that came up that was a concern for us was this land deal and certainly the purchase and all of that that went around this purchase of the Madrid Way property.

03:35:04.988 --> 03:35:10.472
It is important to note that the purchase of the property was done without College Prep Board approval in November.

03:35:10.492 --> 03:35:11.993
It wasn't until January

03:35:12.373 --> 03:35:18.415
that that was approved by the college prep board in a retroactive move.

03:35:19.136 --> 03:35:26.798
Since that time, then, they've entered into agreements with Highmark and with all of these other firms outside of California to develop the property.

03:35:27.619 --> 03:35:33.561
But as was mentioned by the county office, the costs are just so outrageous, going from $180,000 a year lease payment to over $900,000.

03:35:37.483 --> 03:35:39.965
Those were a big concern for us, and the budget just didn't pan out.

03:35:40.646 --> 03:35:44.230
And finally, as was mentioned by the county, discipline procedures.

03:35:44.430 --> 03:35:49.376
When I did my first capacity interview with College Prep and their staff, and I have two minutes and four seconds, so I've got more than enough time.

03:35:50.096 --> 03:35:55.622
When I did my first capacity interview, I noticed in their SARC that there was an expulsion

03:35:56.368 --> 03:36:02.392
Now, I have been a middle school principal, I've been a middle school vice principal, I was a middle school math teacher, I've been assistant superintendent, superintendent.

03:36:02.712 --> 03:36:08.155
You and I know that expulsion is the most serious consequence a school district can levy on a student.

03:36:08.195 --> 03:36:15.759
Expulsion means you do not attend public school for one year, the semester in which the event happened and the subsequent semester.

03:36:16.160 --> 03:36:23.104
So I asked myself, at a charter school of 240 students with this demographic body, how can there be an expulsion?

03:36:23.962 --> 03:36:25.244
It had to be serious.

03:36:25.945 --> 03:36:35.536
You and I both know that in California, there are three things that are mandatory expulsions, brandishing a knife, selling a controlled substance, so selling drugs, or bringing a black powder firearm to a campus.

03:36:35.556 --> 03:36:38.179
You bring those three things, we have no hope, you gotta get expelled.

03:36:38.740 --> 03:36:42.525
So I asked petitioners, can you tell me about this expulsion?

03:36:43.565 --> 03:36:46.147
And the response was, well, the youngster brought a knife.

03:36:46.687 --> 03:36:49.289
Now, you and I both know middle schoolers are going to bring knives to school.

03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:50.549
They forget they're in the backpack.

03:36:50.570 --> 03:36:51.390
They think it's cool.

03:36:51.450 --> 03:36:51.830
Whatever.

03:36:52.831 --> 03:36:54.012
Generally, you kind of take that.

03:36:54.052 --> 03:36:55.072
Maybe there's a suspension.

03:36:55.132 --> 03:36:56.033
Maybe there's some of that stuff.

03:36:56.373 --> 03:36:57.534
So I said, oh, my gosh, a knife.

03:36:57.674 --> 03:36:58.935
The student must have brandished it.

03:36:59.235 --> 03:37:00.936
He said, oh, no, he was just showing it to some friends.

03:37:00.976 --> 03:37:02.397
Well, you and I both know kids like knives.

03:37:02.417 --> 03:37:03.277
They're going to show them to friends.

03:37:03.658 --> 03:37:05.319
So I said, so what did he do that got him expelled?

03:37:05.739 --> 03:37:08.240
Well, he just didn't fit in was the answer.

03:37:09.301 --> 03:37:10.562
That is an absolute quote.

03:37:11.448 --> 03:37:12.970
It just wasn't fitting in with our school.

03:37:13.370 --> 03:37:16.093
We hear that sometimes from kids that come back from college prep.

03:37:16.113 --> 03:37:16.734
They're mean to me.

03:37:17.995 --> 03:37:22.781
Finally, I have to say, you have documents that were not provided to La Mesa Spring Valley.

03:37:23.698 --> 03:37:27.961
When your staff reviewed the exact documents we had, they recommended denial.

03:37:28.181 --> 03:37:38.669
It was only after the subsequent documents were received that I asked for and was told you'd be given you everything in that letter, and you have all of this, that we had to deny.

03:37:39.209 --> 03:37:43.973
In your case, with the documents that we had, there was a denial.

03:37:44.193 --> 03:37:47.315
Why would CollegePrep not share the documents with La Mesa Spring Valley?

03:37:47.715 --> 03:37:48.436
Four seconds left.

03:37:48.596 --> 03:37:49.597
I thank you for your time.

03:37:53.007 --> 03:37:55.069
Okay.

03:37:55.329 --> 03:38:02.335
Board member, before we have board member comments, I'll call for public comment because we're under the public hearing.

03:38:03.860 --> 03:38:06.061
With the following speakers, please line up at the podium.

03:38:06.941 --> 03:38:30.511
Sheila Whitley, David Feliciano, Mitchell Miller, Joe Gilman, Dylan Petrovich, Tracy Dahlkamp, Sung Trainer, Christine Lamarca, Lana Penaberry, Father Simon Ishaki, Corey Malchik, Mark Skosin, Gary Hobelman, Andy Stern, Ramal Anfion, and Eric Premack.

03:38:35.834 --> 03:38:36.695
Please come forward.

03:38:37.235 --> 03:38:38.196
I'm Mitchell Miller.

03:38:38.256 --> 03:38:40.637
I was named third, so I'm not sure where the first two.

03:38:40.858 --> 03:38:41.678
Were you on the list?

03:38:42.078 --> 03:38:42.339
Yes, sir.

03:38:42.579 --> 03:38:43.259
OK, go ahead.

03:38:43.479 --> 03:38:43.760
Thank you.

03:38:43.780 --> 03:38:44.360
I appreciate it.

03:38:44.820 --> 03:38:46.041
Good afternoon, board members.

03:38:46.081 --> 03:38:47.562
My name is Mitchell Miller, as we mentioned.

03:38:47.582 --> 03:38:49.323
I'm one of the petitioners for College Prep.

03:38:49.564 --> 03:38:54.947
I'd like to thank you for this opportunity to present our petition and to be able to tell you a little bit about the good stuff that we're doing for kids.

03:38:55.348 --> 03:39:01.452
We believe that we've developed a very successful educational program over the past eight years, culminating to the petition that is before you.

03:39:01.872 --> 03:39:03.974
It is one that truly focuses on people and programs.

03:39:04.514 --> 03:39:06.515
However, it's been quite a journey that's brought us here today.

03:39:06.735 --> 03:39:21.623
And despite the district putting up roadblocks at every step of the way, including unsuccessfully litigating against us, not once but twice, at a reported cost of over $250,000 at taxpayers expense, we continue to provide a high quality education to our community for eight years.

03:39:22.867 --> 03:39:28.071
We feel that this should be an exciting time for us as we look to expand our program whose success we hope will be celebrated.

03:39:28.492 --> 03:39:33.536
We love what we do and we want to be able to continue to educate students and prepare them for high school and beyond.

03:39:33.916 --> 03:39:40.982
We take that responsibility very seriously and know how significant the middle school years are in making sure that students are on the right path to success.

03:39:41.542 --> 03:39:44.925
We hope that you see how much this means to us in our community and we wish that

03:39:45.465 --> 03:39:50.012
to not only make our students and families proud, but to make the State Board to be proud as well.

03:39:50.252 --> 03:39:52.095
Something that we like to call Tiger Pride.

03:39:52.435 --> 03:39:53.677
Thank you again for your consideration.

03:39:53.717 --> 03:39:54.238
I appreciate it.

03:39:59.266 --> 03:40:03.588
OK, I brought a picture because my kids wanted to come again, but we came last month.

03:40:03.708 --> 03:40:10.770
So my name is Jo Gilman, and I'm the proud parent of two college prep students spanning the last seven years.

03:40:10.890 --> 03:40:12.931
We're a multicultural blended family.

03:40:13.611 --> 03:40:17.252
And this makes me, sorry, a stepmom and a grandma of three.

03:40:17.832 --> 03:40:20.093
I can't wait for my grandkids to go to college prep.

03:40:20.373 --> 03:40:21.754
The last seven years have been awesome.

03:40:22.654 --> 03:40:27.999
My daughter, Kamilani, has a 4.6, and she's in her top 3% of her graduating class this year.

03:40:28.340 --> 03:40:33.785
She has a love for math and physics, and she learned excellent organizational skills from her years at college prep.

03:40:34.606 --> 03:40:35.967
Our eighth grade daughter, Mia-Clea.

03:40:38.326 --> 03:40:43.910
who came with me last month is also a straight-A student and has acquired her excellent study habits from college prep.

03:40:44.691 --> 03:40:50.095
Both also have been prepared for a strong social life as navigating a middle school can be difficult.

03:40:50.896 --> 03:40:54.358
I love the fact that our classroom size provides an intimate learning environment.

03:40:54.718 --> 03:40:59.262
Both my girls attended our local elementary school and while I was very happy with the environment,

03:40:59.822 --> 03:41:04.686
It quickly became obvious that our girls were given the task to tutor their peers.

03:41:05.247 --> 03:41:10.871
While this honor was esteem building, it kept them at status quo and did not give them the challenge they needed to push forward.

03:41:11.492 --> 03:41:12.553
College Prep has done that.

03:41:13.373 --> 03:41:16.516
Please approve our charter so that my grandkids can attend there.

03:41:17.257 --> 03:41:19.218
I'm really counting on you guys to do the right thing.

03:41:19.558 --> 03:41:19.839
Thank you.

03:41:27.418 --> 03:41:29.279
Good afternoon, distinguished members of the board.

03:41:29.439 --> 03:41:30.800
My name is Dejan Petakovic.

03:41:31.241 --> 03:41:36.124
That's a Serbian surname if you're interested in diversity, but in the spirit of St.

03:41:36.164 --> 03:41:37.865
Patrick's Day, we can be Irish.

03:41:39.727 --> 03:41:45.471
My wife, Natasha, and I are the proud parents of two sons who are both honor roll students at College Prep Middle Schools.

03:41:46.997 --> 03:41:58.626
Analogous to the credo, location, location in the real estate world, the credo that best describes CPMS is dedication, dedication, dedication.

03:41:59.486 --> 03:42:01.668
Our students are dedicated to higher learning.

03:42:02.509 --> 03:42:04.891
Our educators are dedicated to our students.

03:42:05.671 --> 03:42:11.896
We as parents, the true representatives here today of the Lomasa Spring Valley School District,

03:42:13.191 --> 03:42:22.633
Come here today from San Diego at our own personal expense, not a taxpayer expense, in support of our petition under your oversight.

03:42:23.974 --> 03:42:28.335
We ask you to join our three pillars of dedication.

03:42:28.355 --> 03:42:32.176
Together, we may build together a stronger foundation.

03:42:32.296 --> 03:42:32.616
Thank you.

03:42:38.103 --> 03:42:42.649
Hello, my name is Tracy and I have two children in eighth and sixth grade who currently attend CPMS.

03:42:42.749 --> 03:42:44.332
I do not have a background in education.

03:42:44.372 --> 03:42:45.894
I'm not involved in local politics.

03:42:46.354 --> 03:42:47.676
I am a mom who two years ago...

03:42:50.393 --> 03:43:00.600
was in a dire situation with my children's education due to physical, emotional, and psychological challenges at their large public schools with large class sizes.

03:43:01.461 --> 03:43:05.224
After one year, it was clear that CPMAs made the difference.

03:43:05.624 --> 03:43:09.747
My kids felt seen, heard, understood, and cared for.

03:43:10.428 --> 03:43:11.608
The students are noticed.

03:43:11.748 --> 03:43:14.030
They're encouraged to share their opinions and ideas.

03:43:14.631 --> 03:43:18.734
The teachers have an opportunity to observe the pace of the class and adjust learning accordingly.

03:43:19.594 --> 03:43:24.955
The benefits of my children have experienced being in a smaller class size has been a real eye-opener for our family.

03:43:25.155 --> 03:43:28.316
Another reason this school is so well-loved is because of the nurturing staff.

03:43:28.776 --> 03:43:32.056
They know every child, all families are invited and encouraged to be active.

03:43:32.676 --> 03:43:40.938
Personally, I believe the increased violence we see at schools today is largely due to children that are in environments where they are not seen, they are not heard or understood.

03:43:41.498 --> 03:43:47.719
This school sees our kids and they care, and more kids deserve a school like this.

03:43:47.959 --> 03:43:48.279
Thank you.

03:43:55.043 --> 03:43:55.543
Good afternoon.

03:43:55.583 --> 03:43:59.925
I want to thank you in advance for taking into consideration what I'm going to say before making your final decision.

03:44:00.606 --> 03:44:03.688
My name is Lena Pena-Berry, and my son is in seventh grade at College Prep.

03:44:04.228 --> 03:44:08.030
Almost four years ago, my husband and I made a very hard choice to leave our faith-based school.

03:44:08.671 --> 03:44:17.016
After touring multiple schools in and out of our district, we made the decision to move our son to College Prep, as it was the only school in our community that met our son's educational needs.

03:44:17.876 --> 03:44:19.478
It was one of the best decisions we ever made.

03:44:19.898 --> 03:44:27.646
Aside from a stellar education, our son has learned accountability, responsibility, time management, and most of all, how to be a respectful young man.

03:44:28.246 --> 03:44:37.876
The driving factor behind his enormous success is due to the entire staff at CPMS, who make it a priority to know every student and their families on a very personal level.

03:44:38.376 --> 03:44:41.859
And they work closely with them in shaping the success of every student.

03:44:42.620 --> 03:44:49.965
I stand before you to ask you to please let our program continue to grow and thrive so more kids can have the same opportunity we have had.

03:44:50.726 --> 03:44:57.830
I know with your support, CPMS will continue to affect our kids and community in a positive way for years to come.

03:44:58.411 --> 03:44:58.711
Thank you.

03:45:04.758 --> 03:45:06.920
Good afternoon, my name is Sung Trainer.

03:45:07.960 --> 03:45:13.685
Thank you for giving me this opportunity to express my strong support for College Prep Middle School.

03:45:14.805 --> 03:45:18.929
Currently, I have a daughter in seventh grade and a son in sixth grade at College Prep.

03:45:19.509 --> 03:45:22.851
Both of their experiences have been positive and encouraging.

03:45:23.752 --> 03:45:29.153
They are very different in personality and in learning styles, but they are both thriving.

03:45:30.253 --> 03:45:35.274
My daughter is involved in the school's ASB program, and my son plays volleyball on the boys' team.

03:45:36.234 --> 03:45:41.575
In addition, I have been able to volunteer at the school, giving regular art lessons to fifth graders.

03:45:42.195 --> 03:45:48.376
This opportunity has allowed me to observe the administrative staff and teachers closely.

03:45:48.976 --> 03:45:51.277
The administrative staff are dedicated.

03:45:52.077 --> 03:45:53.738
and are excellent at running the school.

03:45:54.158 --> 03:45:58.040
They are kind and genuinely care about the students.

03:45:59.521 --> 03:46:08.746
The teachers are well prepared and provide an engaging and positive learning environment for the students, and they also take an interest in the individual students.

03:46:08.926 --> 03:46:15.670
Please let our College Prep Middle School continue its tradition of preparing our future leaders for success.

03:46:20.322 --> 03:46:21.242
Good afternoon, hello.

03:46:21.422 --> 03:46:25.043
My name is Christine Lamarca and I have twin 8th grade daughters at CPMS.

03:46:26.244 --> 03:46:36.767
By the end of the 4th grade we recognized that the 5th grade teachers' quality was not up to the same standard as the teachers we had had prior and we decided to go and look for options for our children.

03:46:37.267 --> 03:46:45.009
The other thing was that as they were heading into middle school there was a 1,500 student plus school developing a very poor reputation in our neighborhood.

03:46:45.609 --> 03:46:50.454
And that option didn't seem like a good fit for our physically small and often very quirky daughters.

03:46:51.254 --> 03:46:53.897
And school, obviously, is not a one-size-fits-all option.

03:46:54.037 --> 03:46:56.059
We started looking for our alternatives.

03:46:56.559 --> 03:47:06.128
And after touring CPMS in our tiny little space and meeting the directors and seeing the quality of the student work, lining the walls in the classrooms, it was clear that this is where our girls would be best suited to be.

03:47:07.069 --> 03:47:12.551
We started it in 2014 and here we are in 2018 and the transformation of our daughters is crazy.

03:47:12.571 --> 03:47:18.072
They've been accepted with honors to a local high school achieving over 90th percentile nationwide in testing.

03:47:18.892 --> 03:47:28.535
The CPMS students like mine demonstrate proficiency and we would perhaps like to see this be a model for all of our students and future leaders in the East County area of El Cajon.

03:47:28.695 --> 03:47:28.995
Thank you.

03:47:35.285 --> 03:47:35.828
Good afternoon.

03:47:36.009 --> 03:47:37.035
My name is Corey metric.

03:47:37.055 --> 03:47:38.504
I'm the board president of college prep.

03:47:39.315 --> 03:47:49.099
I want to thank the administration, faculty, and staff of College Prep Middle School for creating, cultivating, and operating a premier learning environment and a fiscally responsible organization.

03:47:49.879 --> 03:47:55.701
I would also like to thank all the students and families, those many of who are here today and those who couldn't make it, for all of their support.

03:47:56.382 --> 03:48:00.683
And finally, I would like to thank the CDE staff for their thorough and unbiased review of our charter.

03:48:01.203 --> 03:48:08.006
Their detailed analysis of the facts resulted in the CDE staff recommendation of approval for our school.

03:48:09.073 --> 03:48:20.112
And what I would hope that this board would do is to follow both the majority of the ACCS that voted to approve us, as well as your staff to approve us, and approve our high-performing charter school.

03:48:20.332 --> 03:48:20.813
Thank you very much.

03:48:26.803 --> 03:48:27.283
Good afternoon.

03:48:27.343 --> 03:48:28.263
My name is Gary Hobelman.

03:48:28.283 --> 03:48:35.265
I'm the assistant superintendent of business for Mountain Empire Unified School District and I've been with the district since January of 2015.

03:48:36.105 --> 03:48:41.287
We just wanted to say that we were the original authorizing agency for Charter Prep back in 2010-2011.

03:48:41.767 --> 03:48:46.768
We've been providing the back office and the payroll support for the Charter since that time.

03:48:47.588 --> 03:49:00.080
We have a wonderful working relationship with them and College Prep has been a viable charter and it's reflected in their fiscal responsibility in previous years and their educational program.

03:49:00.420 --> 03:49:00.701
Thank you.

03:49:04.753 --> 03:49:05.193
Good afternoon.

03:49:05.213 --> 03:49:06.415
My name is Mark Skousen.

03:49:06.575 --> 03:49:12.060
I'm the president of Highmark School Development, the company that's actually developing this facility for college prep middle school.

03:49:13.821 --> 03:49:22.910
The thing that I just wanted to mention today is we've developed over 70 schools around the country, including several other high-performing charter schools here in California.

03:49:24.010 --> 03:49:31.713
And we do a very, very vigorous vetting, underwriting process for each of the schools we choose to develop and invest in.

03:49:32.694 --> 03:49:36.595
This has been about a two and a half year process with College Prep Middle School.

03:49:36.735 --> 03:49:41.397
We vetted board governance, we vetted their program, we vetted the real estate solution.

03:49:42.798 --> 03:49:50.341
In my mind, having looked at a lot of schools, College Prep Middle School represents the best of the best in the terms of the schools that we choose to underwrite.

03:49:50.421 --> 03:49:52.802
We are pretty selective in the schools that we

03:49:53.902 --> 03:50:01.364
choose to partner with and this is the exact type school that we choose to partner with and are very supportive.

03:50:02.104 --> 03:50:15.147
The other quick thing that I'll mention is as it talks as it relates to the facility payment, we back into the facility payment based on the school's budget and we will not put a school in a situation where they cannot afford their facility payment.

03:50:15.327 --> 03:50:15.627
Thank you.

03:50:20.302 --> 03:50:21.623
Hello, my name is Andy Stern.

03:50:21.863 --> 03:50:23.764
I'm the Managing Director with Charter Impact.

03:50:23.824 --> 03:50:26.505
We provide accounting and financial services for charter schools.

03:50:27.205 --> 03:50:31.027
I was previously for six years the Chief Business Officer for Rocketship Education.

03:50:31.607 --> 03:50:35.429
Charter Impact asked us to do an independent financial analysis.

03:50:35.969 --> 03:50:43.532
Our conclusion is that the financials are reasonable and the fund balance resulting in a fund balance that's in excess of 37% in all the years of the charter.

03:50:45.693 --> 03:51:05.142
The projections of rent are as stated, however, the charter school qualifies for SB 740 allocations, which would result in the annual cost of less than $500,000 even when the school is full, and would likely be less if and when the school exercises its likely option to acquire the building and refinance.

03:51:10.640 --> 03:51:14.725
Hello I'm Sheila Whitley and I'm here representing California Teachers Association.

03:51:15.886 --> 03:51:25.577
First I want to commend CPMS because it sounds like they have an exemplary program and it's a program I'd love to have my children have attended and my grandchildren to attend.

03:51:26.843 --> 03:51:36.111
However, I am here objecting to this being approved, and I am objecting because of the message that keeps being sent to charter schools.

03:51:36.951 --> 03:51:38.953
All of us believe in local control.

03:51:39.113 --> 03:51:40.474
That is why we have the LCAPs.

03:51:40.554 --> 03:51:45.979
You guys developed this to give back monies to local school districts.

03:51:47.240 --> 03:51:51.143
Most of the teachers in California truly believe that it is very important

03:51:51.603 --> 03:52:01.474
to have local control of our schools because not all communities are the same, not all schools are the same, and not all children are the same.

03:52:03.277 --> 03:52:04.478
So I feel like the

03:52:07.201 --> 03:52:23.337
that you are sending back to schools is that they cannot provide the information that is requested and that they can just come here and get their programs approved by the State Board and I don't think that is the message that you guys should be sending or that you want to be sent.

03:52:23.938 --> 03:52:24.278
Thank you.

03:52:30.168 --> 03:52:31.009
Good afternoon, board members.

03:52:31.049 --> 03:52:32.089
My name is Sarah Sutherland.

03:52:32.129 --> 03:52:34.571
I'm an attorney and I represented La Mesa Spring Valley School District.

03:52:35.451 --> 03:52:38.313
Petitioners have an active charter with Mountain Empire School District.

03:52:38.834 --> 03:52:41.295
Currently, there's four more years on that charter.

03:52:42.696 --> 03:52:46.058
That charter was pending at the time the La Mesa Spring Valley Charter was pending.

03:52:46.098 --> 03:52:47.519
They were essentially the same charter.

03:52:47.879 --> 03:52:49.560
They were based on the same teacher signatures.

03:52:49.921 --> 03:52:51.202
They were based on the same students.

03:52:51.622 --> 03:52:52.843
They were based on the same money.

03:52:53.703 --> 03:52:57.926
And so at the time this petition was considered by La Mesa Spring Valley, it was a very different proposal than it is

03:52:58.386 --> 03:53:07.351
before you today, which is now a second school, with another charter for Mountain Empire that is apparently gonna move these same 240 students to Campo, which is 50 miles from La Mesa.

03:53:07.371 --> 03:53:20.277
I wanna remind this board that Mountain Empire Unified School District was, at the time this charter was approved, run by a superintendent that has been convicted of a felony for approving charters to just locate outside of his boundaries.

03:53:20.297 --> 03:53:24.960
This is a classroom-based charter that located wherever they wanted to locate as long as it wasn't in Mountain Empire.

03:53:26.200 --> 03:53:38.825
That's how this started and that's why it is continuing to this day with this sort of local issue, which is truly a local issue and we would respectfully request that you allow it to remain a local issue and we are handling it.

03:53:39.045 --> 03:53:39.385
Thank you.

03:53:44.166 --> 03:53:46.687
Hello, my name is David Feliciano.

03:53:46.767 --> 03:53:51.609
I'm the assistant superintendent for business services at La Mesa Spring Valley School District.

03:53:53.513 --> 03:53:55.553
And you forgive me, I'm going to read from my phone here.

03:53:57.031 --> 03:54:00.813
I'm a resident of San Diego and I'm also an advocate for charter schools.

03:54:01.093 --> 03:54:09.218
In fact, I have two children that attend a charter school where they receive a high quality education and it's the right fit for my family.

03:54:09.778 --> 03:54:14.301
I should add that this charter school was authorized by the district in which the school is located.

03:54:15.401 --> 03:54:18.723
It is this commitment to school choice that motivates me to speak to you today.

03:54:19.444 --> 03:54:24.907
As a CBO, if I were to engage my district in a binding multimillion dollar land deal,

03:54:25.547 --> 03:54:40.307
With multiple out-of-state for-profit corporations prior to board approval and with no opportunity for public input or scrutiny, as CPMS has done, I would rightly be accused of misappropriating millions of dollars in public funds.

03:54:40.828 --> 03:54:47.398
violating the education code, conflict of interest laws, the Brown Act, and numerous other state and federal laws.

03:54:48.119 --> 03:54:50.803
I would lose my job and possibly face criminal charges.

03:54:51.203 --> 03:54:55.890
I fear for the charter school movement because of these actions by CPMS.

03:54:56.051 --> 03:54:56.311
Thank you.

03:54:59.758 --> 03:55:01.540
Board, Ramel Antoine with Cal Charters.

03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:09.529
I want to state our strong support for College Prep Middle School based on their track record, based on the services they're already offering and their expansion.

03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:20.622
At ACCS, this issue of diversity came up and I wanted to read a letter from Father Simon, or sorry, Father Simon Shockey, speaking to a specific group that they're serving that doesn't show up on the indicators.

03:55:21.343 --> 03:55:25.387
So, dear board members, here's a brief explanation about who the Chaldeans are.

03:55:25.887 --> 03:55:32.434
I hope everything – rather, the Chaldeans are part of an ancient group of many people who are the original inhabitants of modern-day Iraq.

03:55:33.215 --> 03:55:36.999
They also have their own traditions and language which they use, which is Aramaic.

03:55:37.500 --> 03:55:42.125
Over the past century, Chaldeans have been spreading all throughout the world, mainly because of religious persecution in Iraq.

03:55:42.805 --> 03:55:47.308
We have big communities in Europe, Australia, and Canada, but the major areas are Detroit and San Diego.

03:55:47.788 --> 03:55:54.512
In San Diego alone, they have about 60,000 Chaldeans, many of whom experienced religious persecution in Iraq and had to flee the country with nothing.

03:55:54.992 --> 03:56:01.936
For Chaldean community here in San Diego, he does a lot of work and really thinks that the college prep provides an option for those students needing support.

03:56:02.397 --> 03:56:02.697
Thank you.

03:56:08.792 --> 03:56:10.473
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

03:56:10.694 --> 03:56:16.879
Again, another one that I think should be an easy, simple, straightforward approval.

03:56:17.399 --> 03:56:19.000
They meet all of the criteria.

03:56:20.442 --> 03:56:26.327
I think there's obviously a lot of philosophical opposition to the charter school concept in some circles.

03:56:27.147 --> 03:56:28.548
Again, not a reason for denial.

03:56:28.709 --> 03:56:28.989
Thank you.

03:56:34.864 --> 03:56:36.965
Good afternoon, Claire Crawford within the public interest.

03:56:37.705 --> 03:56:56.174
I would just like to suggest that if you do vote to approve this charter that you request that the CD staff that are charged with oversight provide careful attention to the demographics of the student body and ensure that their demographics reach much closer to reflect what the district currently has attending.

03:56:56.214 --> 03:56:57.835
I think the numbers that the county raised

03:56:58.956 --> 03:57:06.963
serious concerns about whether they're actually serving the students in that community and so the CDA would have the ability to really be monitoring that closely.

03:57:07.023 --> 03:57:07.243
Thanks.

03:57:09.605 --> 03:57:18.193
Okay that concludes the public comments so I declare the public hearing closed and now we're ready for board member questions comments.

03:57:18.233 --> 03:57:19.174
Board member Strauss.

03:57:22.841 --> 03:57:28.423
Well, I wanna thank everyone for coming to testify and share their perceptions.

03:57:28.863 --> 03:57:39.367
It sounds from what I hear and from the data that the instructional program of this school is solid, but I have a lot of clarifying questions based on the other testimony.

03:57:39.907 --> 03:57:46.990
So maybe I'll start with our CDE team and then you can decide who best and I'll just kind of share.

03:57:47.270 --> 03:57:50.872
I wanna talk about the demographics, about the disciplinary action,

03:57:51.932 --> 03:57:54.594
about the financial issues and things that the county felt.

03:57:54.654 --> 03:58:06.481
So could we start with the, did you investigate the contrast in the demographics from the local population to what appears, is it the, well maybe I'll ask you that and then we've heard some other explanations.

03:58:06.541 --> 03:58:13.025
I'm just trying to be clear about whether it's a self-selected group and doesn't represent the actual population of the community.

03:58:14.206 --> 03:58:16.288
We didn't look at the demographics specifically.

03:58:16.348 --> 03:58:20.912
We did look at the race and ethnicity balance and how that's identified in the petition.

03:58:21.392 --> 03:58:24.495
So that's as far as we got in terms of the race and ethnicity.

03:58:24.555 --> 03:58:32.942
But as was proposed, that is something we can continue to look at as we monitor, especially with the dashboard now.

03:58:32.982 --> 03:58:37.926
So that is something we can continue to monitor and bring forward if we do have any concerns about that.

03:58:37.966 --> 03:58:40.088
But we didn't get into the detailed demographics.

03:58:40.168 --> 03:58:51.958
So I just would put on the table, and maybe my other colleagues have other clarifying, but the contrast of 2% English learners versus 20% of local population is a concern of mine, but maybe there'll be some other ones as well.

03:58:52.459 --> 03:59:00.106
Also, this doesn't really sound like a school that closed, but when I asked you, you said it closed, but it sort of reopened, but it sounds like it's an existing school.

03:59:00.406 --> 03:59:07.212
I'm actually somewhat confused, and also that one was gonna be located 50 miles away, so could you follow me

03:59:07.794 --> 03:59:29.743
give me from one mountain empire authorized it and where it is today has it moved has it just closed and reopened is it just a technical i'm i'm just confused by all the testimony that i will do my best and and if if i am incorrect i'll have the the petitioner come up but my understanding is there's two schools so they were both authorized under mountain empire

03:59:30.343 --> 03:59:35.825
one in La Mesa, which is the one before you today, and then the Acampo site.

03:59:35.865 --> 03:59:47.848
The La Mesa school closed June 30, 2017, and then the Acampo site has been using that facility.

03:59:48.388 --> 03:59:51.609
They are currently in operation.

03:59:51.789 --> 03:59:52.229
There are

03:59:53.450 --> 03:59:59.777
technically two schools, one that's currently open and then one that's before you to be authorized under the state board.

04:00:00.038 --> 04:00:09.689
But the one that's before us to be authorized, are there students currently in that program waiting authorization because of the technical issue of relocating in the local, like it really didn't close.

04:00:10.475 --> 04:00:15.297
Well, my understanding is that one did close, and there are kids that are at the Campos site now.

04:00:16.178 --> 04:00:17.759
They also do have a waiting list.

04:00:17.879 --> 04:00:25.863
So if both schools are open, then there will be kids going to the La Mesa site and kids staying at the Campos.

04:00:25.883 --> 04:00:29.945
But the parents who testified are talking about their students in a program that they don't want us to close.

04:00:31.326 --> 04:00:34.087
Because the other campus is currently operating.

04:00:34.848 --> 04:00:48.563
The kids that were in the school back closed, but a new school came in and took over the school that was existing under the other name, so it's just got a different name now, but it's the same site and the same students, so that's why I'm confused.

04:00:49.466 --> 04:01:16.400
maybe my okay my it's been a long day and i may have if i have it wrong please let me know but my understanding is that the the the mace the the la mesa site the closed the college prep middle school closed and then in august the acampo site opened uh both college prep but there that students went to are at that facility the facility is still in la mesa so the students went to that school which is that school again

04:01:16.900 --> 04:01:17.820
The same facility.

04:01:18.280 --> 04:01:18.720
It's the same.

04:01:18.780 --> 04:01:20.341
In La Mesa, not in Campo.

04:01:20.381 --> 04:01:21.181
La Mesa, yes.

04:01:21.701 --> 04:01:22.681
But they were in La Mesa.

04:01:22.701 --> 04:01:24.582
I'm totally lost, yeah.

04:01:24.682 --> 04:01:28.462
Can you tell me where Campo is and where is Campo?

04:01:28.482 --> 04:01:29.883
That means nothing to me, Campo.

04:01:29.943 --> 04:01:35.564
I believe they're operating under a petition authorized by, currently, authorized by Mountain Empire.

04:01:36.544 --> 04:01:40.285
But they have a site in La Mesa and a site in El Campo.

04:01:40.705 --> 04:01:43.125
The site in La Mesa is outside of Mountain Empire.

04:01:43.565 --> 04:01:45.486
They're operating there under exemption.

04:01:46.346 --> 04:01:54.524
that is legal, they allege, based on the temporary allowance to operate outside of the district because they're constructing a facility.

04:01:55.154 --> 04:01:56.315
Where is El Campo?

04:01:56.375 --> 04:02:00.357
Is that near, how close is that to the local school district?

04:02:00.377 --> 04:02:01.297
It's like 50 miles away.

04:02:01.678 --> 04:02:03.599
But the kids are going to school in La Mesa.

04:02:03.619 --> 04:02:08.201
How could they have the same population as Springfield, as La Mesa then?

04:02:08.601 --> 04:02:12.884
So there's, so we had our La Mesa, we had our La Mesa site.

04:02:13.064 --> 04:02:15.345
It was in a church basement, I believe.

04:02:16.106 --> 04:02:18.407
That site was authorized

04:02:18.768 --> 04:02:29.389
by Mountain Empire closed, then they did a new petition in Mountain Empire with two sites, Acampo and the closed site.

04:02:31.121 --> 04:02:42.367
And now they're going to get a new petition proposed to you with just the La Mesa site, but keep open the Acampo site under the Mountain Empire petition.

04:02:42.387 --> 04:02:43.288
Judy, let me clarify.

04:02:43.588 --> 04:02:51.212
The students that were in the college prep middle school have not lost the continuity of their instructional program.

04:02:51.232 --> 04:02:51.772
That's correct.

04:02:51.792 --> 04:02:52.413
They've changed authorizers.

04:02:52.453 --> 04:02:52.973
That's correct.

04:02:53.193 --> 04:02:55.554
Are they still in the same site they were in in 2017?

04:02:56.155 --> 04:02:58.956
So it's really a technical process.

04:02:59.636 --> 04:03:00.117
Am I right?

04:03:00.217 --> 04:03:00.377
Yes.

04:03:00.917 --> 04:03:03.339
Yes, but there will be two schools.

04:03:03.780 --> 04:03:09.744
Yes, at the end of this it will look a little different because if you approve it there would be two schools, two petitions.

04:03:10.385 --> 04:03:20.433
The petition you possibly approve with the La Mesa site and then the petition that's currently authorized by Mountain Empire will lose the La Mesa site and just keep the compost site.

04:03:22.293 --> 04:03:22.553
Okay.

04:03:23.194 --> 04:03:23.954
Well, right.

04:03:23.974 --> 04:03:24.534
Yes.

04:03:25.195 --> 04:03:25.355
Yes.

04:03:25.655 --> 04:03:34.881
Where did the statistics come from that they produced and was it a site 50 miles from the proposed one or is it the La Mesa?

04:03:35.741 --> 04:03:36.182
I'm sorry.

04:03:36.282 --> 04:03:36.962
I apologize.

04:03:37.022 --> 04:03:37.923
I missed the question.

04:03:37.943 --> 04:03:38.103
Okay.

04:03:38.123 --> 04:03:49.410
We got various statistics about racial and ethnic differences between the charter school proposal and the district.

04:03:50.146 --> 04:03:54.171
If they're going to school 50 miles away, what is the comparison?

04:03:54.652 --> 04:03:56.354
I'm trying to, you know, I'm lost.

04:03:56.434 --> 04:03:59.458
Right now, those are the same kids in La Mesa.

04:04:01.160 --> 04:04:03.003
They're not going 50 miles away.

04:04:03.944 --> 04:04:07.849
This is really just a technicality to get it within its own location.

04:04:08.320 --> 04:04:23.132
So just a couple more things and then I believe I'm expecting my colleagues may have other questions but the issue of disciplinary actions and suspending or expelling kids that seem to be against what the philosophy of normal progressive discipline at middle school.

04:04:23.593 --> 04:04:28.397
Did you review that or was that done only at the county level and was there any

04:04:28.897 --> 04:04:33.139
recommendations or conditions regarding the disciplinary exclusion issues?

04:04:33.459 --> 04:04:43.343
We did review the suspension and expulsion that was in the petition and we did note that they would need to be updated based on the new laws, the AB 1360 that came into effect.

04:04:43.783 --> 04:04:50.626
But that is the case in most of the petitions that we see because they're older and they're trying to catch up to the new laws.

04:04:51.106 --> 04:04:53.907
So that is pretty standard in each of the petitions that we see.

04:04:53.987 --> 04:04:56.228
And my last area, again we may come back, but

04:04:56.528 --> 04:05:06.374
The financial issues that we heard testimony on, is the CDE comfortable with the current financial information that you have?

04:05:06.494 --> 04:05:09.696
We are.

04:05:09.736 --> 04:05:10.397
Board Member Burr.

04:05:12.773 --> 04:05:33.602
I just want to follow up on the issue about the racial and ethnic diversity and make sure I understand what we're doing at the state level because the charter law requires a charter to include the means by which the school will achieve a racial and ethnic balance among its pupils that are reflective of the district in which it will be located.

04:05:34.722 --> 04:05:46.592
So, I'm not sure if you checked that or if there is a definitive, I didn't look at the charter petition on this area, definitive plan to achieve that balance.

04:05:51.743 --> 04:06:11.877
One second here and just and while you're looking for at least that what what's a little confusing I'll just say for the La Mesa Spring Valley people folks the tables that you included seem to be heavily weighted toward the elementary or middle schools that were in the neighborhood but the law talks about the whole district and

04:06:13.058 --> 04:06:24.729
I just want to be clear that that's the standard in the statute, that it's the district population, but I also want to know what we're doing to make sure that happens.

04:06:24.910 --> 04:06:28.693
Part of our review of the petition is racial and ethnic balance.

04:06:31.735 --> 04:06:43.600
In this case, we didn't see anything in the petition that would state otherwise, so we do take a general look at the petition in that sense.

04:06:43.780 --> 04:06:58.546
That may be something we can look at further, but we didn't see anything to the contrary, so we assume that as they continue to grow under us, we will continue to look at that as part of the MOU.

04:07:02.602 --> 04:07:04.022
I remember how to say.

04:07:07.844 --> 04:07:09.624
This is a site-based school, correct?

04:07:10.005 --> 04:07:10.325
Correct.

04:07:10.945 --> 04:07:14.306
There was some talk about this being part of the Shasta ruling.

04:07:14.986 --> 04:07:15.527
No, it's not.

04:07:15.587 --> 04:07:16.747
It's a site-based school.

04:07:16.987 --> 04:07:20.048
I believe the superintendent thought it was, but at the same time it's not.

04:07:20.108 --> 04:07:22.529
It's not associated with that decision.

04:07:22.749 --> 04:07:23.029
Correct.

04:07:23.289 --> 04:07:25.090
Our understanding is it is a site-based school.

04:07:25.663 --> 04:07:36.228
There is, of course, this other issue about a charter being authorized in a particular district, but the site being located outside that district.

04:07:36.648 --> 04:07:39.510
That's a whole other topic, but it doesn't have to do with the Shastra rule.

04:07:39.610 --> 04:07:39.910
No.

04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.290
Correct.

04:07:43.111 --> 04:07:47.874
We heard that a lot about this new facility.

04:07:48.074 --> 04:07:54.957
And in fact, at the beginning of the title page of their petition, they have that same drawing of the building.

04:07:56.747 --> 04:08:10.415
Is there a spot, though, in the petition that requires that the school continue down that path to that construction project?

04:08:12.668 --> 04:08:20.513
If we were to approve this petition, are we obligating them to continue down this path toward that facility?

04:08:20.773 --> 04:08:21.693
With the new facility?

04:08:21.714 --> 04:08:22.114
Yeah.

04:08:22.474 --> 04:08:32.360
We will look at that and the costs of that facility as part of the financials that we look at in ensuring that we feel the charter school will be financially viable.

04:08:32.820 --> 04:08:42.266
So we do include what they're estimating to be their lease payments, but there isn't anything that holds them to that facility.

04:08:42.526 --> 04:08:46.630
We heard from the facility provider.

04:08:46.650 --> 04:09:02.505
I don't know exactly what term the gentleman goes by, but that with all their experience of 70 other, you know, school buildings they built or whatever, you know, they work on a sliding scale based upon, you know, the needs of the school and all that.

04:09:03.203 --> 04:09:12.472
But it is possible for the school to pull out of that construction project if financially they can't meet it.

04:09:12.512 --> 04:09:13.233
Is that your understanding?

04:09:13.253 --> 04:09:15.755
I'm not sure where they are in that contract.

04:09:15.835 --> 04:09:17.917
So that might be a question for them.

04:09:19.499 --> 04:09:21.320
I just have a couple more quickies here if you don't mind.

04:09:21.781 --> 04:09:24.623
This $1.5 million that was the starting balance

04:09:29.991 --> 04:09:41.759
There was some confusion here about whether or not that's already been used for a particular school or whether it is still possible for this school to have in their budget.

04:09:41.839 --> 04:09:42.760
Can you explain that?

04:09:43.385 --> 04:09:48.707
We did initially, it was one of our questions about where this $1.2 million was.

04:09:49.307 --> 04:09:53.609
As part of our additional review, we did get a board resolution.

04:09:53.989 --> 04:10:02.773
We did get a home office bank account that showed us where the funds were.

04:10:03.333 --> 04:10:12.017
So we did feel comfortable that the transfer of those funds would be coming to basically both schools, but we did feel comfortable

04:10:12.677 --> 04:10:14.979
The majority of that is coming to the La Mesa school.

04:10:15.520 --> 04:10:19.504
And when you talk about this additional information, is this information you asked for?

04:10:20.211 --> 04:10:46.964
it is we did if if you recall at the ACCS meeting one of our biggest concerns was this 1.2 million we couldn't tell if that was included in their account but we didn't tell it we couldn't tell if that was actually going to the school or where that those funds were so we did ask for some clarifying information to find out where that money was and where it was coming from to make us more comfortable with the financials this is the type of

04:10:48.453 --> 04:10:51.774
Question that comes up is that you know, we didn't get that information.

04:10:51.794 --> 04:10:56.696
I didn't get that You didn't get that, you know, but this is information you asked for and they provided it to you.

04:10:56.756 --> 04:10:57.356
Is that correct?

04:10:57.516 --> 04:11:04.699
Okay, and I just sorry And one more checking on that and did you give it to the back?

04:11:05.059 --> 04:11:14.402
The district says you could they couldn't get that information from you That part I'm I'm not sure we they they did ask us for it and we did provide that to the district

04:11:14.764 --> 04:11:15.345
Okay, go ahead.

04:11:15.385 --> 04:11:15.685
Sorry.

04:11:15.806 --> 04:11:26.961
And the last on my list right now, at least, is do you do you know for a fact that they are requiring fees for uniforms?

04:11:30.051 --> 04:11:32.752
I remember that question coming up before the ACCS meeting.

04:11:32.792 --> 04:11:42.458
We did ask the petitioners if they were requiring uniforms, but our conversations with them were that they were going to assume the cost of those uniforms.

04:11:43.679 --> 04:11:45.200
That is my memory recollection.

04:11:45.260 --> 04:11:46.260
I will double check.

04:11:48.388 --> 04:11:50.029
I don't recall if it was in their budget.

04:11:50.369 --> 04:11:51.270
I'll have to take a look.

04:11:52.290 --> 04:11:54.692
It's not a line item, but for you.

04:11:54.712 --> 04:11:56.413
It doesn't necessarily have to be a line item.

04:11:56.493 --> 04:11:56.853
Correct.

04:11:56.973 --> 04:12:00.495
But it needs to be in the budget, obviously, if they're going to assume the cost of uniforms.

04:12:00.595 --> 04:12:00.836
All right.

04:12:00.916 --> 04:12:01.236
Thank you.

04:12:01.776 --> 04:12:04.538
Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe, I think, was next.

04:12:05.358 --> 04:12:06.199
Oh, Karen was next.

04:12:06.339 --> 04:12:07.520
Oh, Karen was next.

04:12:07.580 --> 04:12:07.640
OK.

04:12:08.929 --> 04:12:22.638
So I have a few concerns, and one is, of course, the suspension and expulsion data procedures, not having a manifestation determination if it involves a special education student, but I'm hearing that we're going to maybe clean that up in the MOU.

04:12:23.439 --> 04:12:33.586
I do have real concerns about the demographics and not matching, and the huge discrepancy, it's like half of the poverty level, and 1% or so of the, or 2% of the,

04:12:39.810 --> 04:12:41.872
SED, the low income level.

04:12:42.413 --> 04:12:50.981
But my other concern is if the property that they're putting the school on belongs to whom?

04:12:51.141 --> 04:12:57.067
The new property, my understanding is it belongs to College Prep Middle School.

04:12:57.147 --> 04:12:58.208
College Prep owns that.

04:12:59.009 --> 04:13:00.931
They don't own, okay.

04:13:00.951 --> 04:13:01.711
Who owns that property?

04:13:04.008 --> 04:13:05.189
The developer.

04:13:05.529 --> 04:13:21.558
So with that, if an agreement is entered in, and I have been working with a school that has private underwriting bonds for their school, and the contention is if that school ever goes upside down, that the authorizer is the one that then holds the liability on the loan.

04:13:21.618 --> 04:13:22.378
Is that correct?

04:13:23.459 --> 04:13:26.100
Are you doing a leaseback type of agreement?

04:13:26.120 --> 04:13:27.641
Do you mind coming up and talking about that?

04:13:32.779 --> 04:13:41.267
Yeah, so Highmark School Development partners with a large real estate investment trust that provides the majority of the capital for the financing of this project, roughly $9.3 million.

04:13:42.368 --> 04:13:45.971
So we do a triple net lease with a three-year buyout provision.

04:13:46.131 --> 04:13:54.439
So we basically have ramped the payments based on the student enrollment of the school and then the school have the option to buy that facility back from us after three years.

04:13:54.499 --> 04:13:57.282
So we're the property owner for those first three years and then the school

04:13:57.963 --> 04:14:04.576
could access the tax-exempt capital markets to own the facility and be title owners of that facility after three years.

04:14:04.876 --> 04:14:08.043
So it's kind of like a balloon payment on the fourth year something has to happen?

04:14:09.025 --> 04:14:17.751
Well, no, I mean, as soon as they as soon as they become an attractive target to the tax exempt market through the underwriting process, then then they would have the ability to exit.

04:14:17.811 --> 04:14:19.432
They would they go through an underwriting process.

04:14:19.532 --> 04:14:20.953
That's a private bonds, right?

04:14:21.013 --> 04:14:21.813
That's what we're going for.

04:14:21.854 --> 04:14:23.495
So that's what I'm talking about.

04:14:24.735 --> 04:14:25.176
Yeah.

04:14:25.236 --> 04:14:26.156
Private public bonds.

04:14:26.216 --> 04:14:26.336
Right.

04:14:26.997 --> 04:14:27.637
Oxymoron there.

04:14:27.677 --> 04:14:27.817
Right.

04:14:29.779 --> 04:14:36.103
So with that, though, the liability of that loan ultimately lies with the authorizer if something happens to that charter.

04:14:36.368 --> 04:14:41.772
No, it actually, because it's privately financed, Highmark actually acts as the guarantor on that.

04:14:42.112 --> 04:14:55.442
So if for some reason the school could not make that lease payment, Highmark is first obligated to that, to the Real Estate Investment Trust, EPR, and then they would, we would either try and find another school to come in there if they couldn't make the payment.

04:14:55.843 --> 04:14:58.345
It's our real estate essentially, it's not your responsibility.

04:14:58.365 --> 04:15:03.008
Okay, thank you.

04:15:03.028 --> 04:15:03.969
A fellow, Ortiz Lacombe.

04:15:04.926 --> 04:15:05.266
Thank you.

04:15:05.286 --> 04:15:11.331
I think anyone that says this is a simple one is not sitting on this side.

04:15:12.131 --> 04:15:19.457
Because there's a couple of things, and we've heard it's a recurring theme, because now like 50% of our items are charter related.

04:15:19.977 --> 04:15:27.103
And before the liaisons would take the lead, but I think now all of us should be very well acquainted with the review process on the CDE end.

04:15:28.184 --> 04:15:34.431
We hear that the petition has evolved and that there's new material and new information.

04:15:35.152 --> 04:15:40.818
I can't, from where I'm sitting, I don't know how that has evolved, and I'm assuming that's something the CDE will look at.

04:15:41.259 --> 04:15:42.019
You look at

04:15:42.660 --> 04:15:49.383
and correct me if I'm wrong, what petition was initially filed, what petition was filed with the county, and what's coming before us?

04:15:49.563 --> 04:15:52.884
And any clarification is based on the original petition.

04:15:53.965 --> 04:15:57.366
I also want to know, are we looking at data of the demographics?

04:15:57.426 --> 04:15:59.247
I mean, that's something that we should be looking at.

04:15:59.527 --> 04:16:00.948
Does it mirror the demographics?

04:16:01.408 --> 04:16:04.689
I have to say that you are doing well by your students, and that's undeniable.

04:16:05.030 --> 04:16:08.691
You know, you're doing well by your Latino students, you're doing well by your three English learners.

04:16:10.672 --> 04:16:17.876
Three, when it's 18%, it would be great for us to see what is a comparison, what is the demographic information.

04:16:18.216 --> 04:16:28.901
Not for us to pull it up on site with the data dashboard, but that should be something coming before us, as well as information that comes before us using our current accountability system.

04:16:28.981 --> 04:16:34.964
I've seen too many APIs, but I think that should stop when it reaches you, and then what comes to us is more up to date.

04:16:35.925 --> 04:16:37.025
In terms of the uniforms,

04:16:38.266 --> 04:16:40.227
Listen, that's kind of a common practice.

04:16:40.287 --> 04:16:42.167
Long Beach Unified has uniforms.

04:16:42.247 --> 04:16:44.088
My kids wear uniforms in public school.

04:16:44.388 --> 04:16:48.889
And there's also always a thing called a waiver where parents could opt to waive out of the uniform.

04:16:49.149 --> 04:16:49.609
And guess what?

04:16:49.749 --> 04:16:51.170
Most of us parents love the uniform.

04:16:52.190 --> 04:16:54.291
So for me, that's not the concern.

04:16:54.331 --> 04:17:02.933
And I think that we've shown in Long Beach Unified that the lowest income family could receive assistance from the schools, but they also like the uniform option.

04:17:03.013 --> 04:17:06.694
That is something that brings parity in terms of socioeconomic to our students.

04:17:06.974 --> 04:17:11.276
so that not one student has to feel like they're not well-dressed for school.

04:17:11.356 --> 04:17:12.836
So, you know, I like that concept.

04:17:13.476 --> 04:17:25.881
But I think that really the issue here is that we hear the district, we hear the county, and they each have a different story, and then we hear the petitioners, and we're now left to make a decision based on a story that has evolved so much.

04:17:26.041 --> 04:17:34.764
And it would be great to know how you review, maybe a memo, how you review the petitions, what goes into your considerations, so that we are all on the same page.

04:17:35.244 --> 04:17:35.504
Thank you.

04:17:39.352 --> 04:17:42.614
Could I ask the petitioner a couple of questions, please?

04:17:51.521 --> 04:17:53.082
This is kind of a general question.

04:17:53.222 --> 04:18:00.707
You've heard from the department responses to some of the questions that other board members have made and that I've made.

04:18:01.047 --> 04:18:03.769
Do you disagree with any of their responses?

04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:06.071
Respectfully, yes.

04:18:06.874 --> 04:18:08.234
Which one and how?

04:18:08.434 --> 04:18:14.736
With regard to our demographics, I believe that we very much look like the community that we're located in.

04:18:16.697 --> 04:18:21.978
When we move to our new facility, if we're so fortunate to get your support, we would like to move to our new facility.

04:18:22.018 --> 04:18:34.082
That facility actually qualifies for SB 740 funds because of the surrounding area, which means that they have over 55% of their students that receive free and reduced price meals.

04:18:34.722 --> 04:18:41.265
Currently at our campus, we are at 41% free and reduced price meals.

04:18:42.565 --> 04:18:50.748
If I could just list our demographics currently, 53% are white, 3.8% are Asian, 8.8% are African American, 3.3% Filipino, 8.8% Hispanic, 13% Middle Eastern, 1.3% Korean, 2.9% Mexican American, and 1% Pacific Islander, and those are just to name a few.

04:19:02.653 --> 04:19:11.403
We have currently, yes, we have a few ELs, but we also have about 57 RFEP students that we monitor and we work with as well.

04:19:11.523 --> 04:19:13.065
So just to let you know that.

04:19:13.705 --> 04:19:20.733
There are 13 primary languages that are spoken at our school, Arabic, Assyrian, Chaldean, French, Japanese, Khymer,

04:19:21.433 --> 04:19:25.035
Korean, Lao, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.

04:19:26.296 --> 04:19:32.959
I would like you to recall or remember that we are a campus that's located in the lower level of a church building currently.

04:19:33.439 --> 04:19:35.460
We have served 240 students.

04:19:35.680 --> 04:19:39.182
That is all the fire marshal will allow us to have in our current facility.

04:19:40.102 --> 04:19:55.051
Each year, we have a 98% retention rate, which means that our students that start with us at fifth grade, they tend to come back to us at sixth grade, and they continue on seventh grade and eighth grade, and that's a wonderful thing, and one of our, I think, our best statistics.

04:19:55.992 --> 04:20:03.036
This past year, we had 20 younger siblings come to our school, which I also think is one of the more wonderful statistics that we have.

04:20:03.676 --> 04:20:09.662
If you think about that in terms of each year, we basically have a new fifth grade cohort that comes to us each year.

04:20:09.742 --> 04:20:11.984
That's 60 spots that are available.

04:20:12.545 --> 04:20:17.570
Now, if I have 20 siblings that are coming, that means that I really only have 40 spots available.

04:20:18.230 --> 04:20:23.656
As you can see, while we have an open enrollment process, there's not very many spots to fill in our school.

04:20:24.416 --> 04:20:33.324
So we're looking forward to our growth and our move to the other part of town, if you will, to increase our diversity.

04:20:33.864 --> 04:20:39.429
And I believe that we will attract a diverse and interested group of students.

04:20:40.870 --> 04:20:43.893
I hope that answers some of the demographic questions that you had.

04:20:47.057 --> 04:20:52.499
As far as the facility, we, I'm sorry.

04:20:52.619 --> 04:20:53.359
That's all right.

04:20:53.840 --> 04:21:01.343
So, you know, thank you for that explanation, but as I think Member Burr pointed out, it's important to have a plan.

04:21:02.763 --> 04:21:09.928
for achieving the racial and economic demographics of the district.

04:21:10.609 --> 04:21:11.990
Absolutely.

04:21:12.210 --> 04:21:17.113
And again, I think 12,600 students are in the district and we are serving 240 of them.

04:21:17.633 --> 04:21:25.579
And once again, I think if you looked at the area that we're in and those schools that are surrounding us, you'll see that we very much mirror those demographics.

04:21:26.179 --> 04:21:29.122
I believe CDE was okay.

04:21:29.162 --> 04:21:36.590
They looked at our plan for our recruitment and found it to be satisfactory.

04:21:37.370 --> 04:21:44.858
I really believe that with that recruitment plan and our move, we are going to attract a diverse population of students.

04:21:47.250 --> 04:21:55.645
Yes, board member Rucker, but I'm going to put into say that I will ask the district and county to come back just the way you did, but we'll continue.

04:21:58.824 --> 04:22:01.087
Since I have you up here, I do have a couple of questions.

04:22:01.548 --> 04:22:07.455
Could you summarize what your recruitment plan is that you believe you wrote in your petition?

04:22:07.855 --> 04:22:13.162
Right now, because our facility is very small, there tends to be more of a word of mouth.

04:22:13.262 --> 04:22:17.908
It seems like it is a more active way of getting our students.

04:22:18.608 --> 04:22:25.635
We intend to go out and do community meetings in various kind of community gathering places.

04:22:26.096 --> 04:22:31.080
We also are going to do a wide-reaching advertisement campaign.

04:22:31.901 --> 04:22:41.731
We haven't done that as much in the past just because we just, again, our limited resources or room at our current site just won't allow it.

04:22:42.471 --> 04:22:43.591
outreach to the community.

04:22:44.071 --> 04:22:45.452
What do you mean when you say that?

04:22:46.052 --> 04:22:57.054
Well we we put out information about our school and then we get you know we have our enrollment but again we've only got certain amount of spots available and then the rest of our students those students are on wait lists.

04:22:57.534 --> 04:23:06.236
So I think once we are able to move to a bigger facility again in the charter you'll see that we plan many many more outreach

04:23:06.997 --> 04:23:11.242
efforts to different places in the community, places where people gather.

04:23:11.903 --> 04:23:17.130
Also, again, another wide-reaching advertising campaign over in that neck of the woods.

04:23:17.461 --> 04:23:19.742
And I heard you say you have a wait list, is that correct?

04:23:19.802 --> 04:23:23.143
Yes, currently we have 130 students on our current wait list.

04:23:23.163 --> 04:23:25.724
And what's the ethnicity of the students on your wait list?

04:23:26.384 --> 04:23:39.148
I couldn't tell you off the top of my head but they're from all over the county and we are open to all students of all over the county and we don't just have students in our school from La Mesa Spring Valley, we have students from the surrounding areas as well.

04:23:39.668 --> 04:23:55.439
Okay and concerning this because I am confused about the two sites I'll be honest with you it would have been better if I had never heard about the site that was authorized by a district that's not related to the petition we're asking today it would have eliminated some of my confusion.

04:23:55.459 --> 04:24:01.042
So I want to focus just on the site that's inside La Mesa Spring Valley.

04:24:01.403 --> 04:24:03.284
The petition before you I appreciate that.

04:24:03.844 --> 04:24:08.848
So for the site that's inside La Mesa Spring Valley that this petition is related to

04:24:10.088 --> 04:24:14.411
are those the students that are going to be going to your new site?

04:24:14.912 --> 04:24:15.852
I think most likely.

04:24:15.872 --> 04:24:23.678
I think that we have students that have begun our program and are definitely probably going to be interested in enrolling.

04:24:24.058 --> 04:24:25.519
I didn't ask the question correctly.

04:24:25.539 --> 04:24:26.120
I'm sorry.

04:24:26.220 --> 04:24:27.400
Okay, no, that's not your fault.

04:24:27.440 --> 04:24:29.242
That means I didn't ask the question correctly.

04:24:29.662 --> 04:24:34.806
As it relates to the students at the La Mesa site, are those, is that the,

04:24:35.486 --> 04:24:39.808
students that you are building this new building for?

04:24:40.628 --> 04:24:43.729
I think we're, I'm trying to understand what you're saying.

04:24:44.690 --> 04:24:55.034
The students that are currently in our program, I'm going to make a strong shake my head assumption that they are going to want to enroll at our new, in our new

04:24:55.834 --> 04:24:57.676
Okay, how many students is that?

04:24:57.876 --> 04:24:58.617
That's 240.

04:24:59.418 --> 04:25:02.501
And this new building will house how many more students?

04:25:02.521 --> 04:25:02.501
250, 260.

04:25:02.742 --> 04:25:03.522
It's at capacity it can be 500.

04:25:03.563 --> 04:25:05.064
So at capacity it'd be 500.

04:25:05.164 --> 04:25:05.465
So you'd be

04:25:11.491 --> 04:25:15.294
recruiting half again as many students as you have right now.

04:25:15.795 --> 04:25:26.263
And yet the development plan that you described to me, the fairs and all those other recruitment strategies are what you're going to use to recruit those additional students.

04:25:26.683 --> 04:25:34.089
And you have students on your waiting list of over 130 students, but you can't tell me about the ethnicity of those students.

04:25:34.770 --> 04:25:40.755
I don't have that information right in front of me, but I can tell you that they come from all over San Diego County.

04:25:41.435 --> 04:25:46.558
And so they would have a place or in line for that new school when you move, is that correct?

04:25:46.618 --> 04:25:50.020
Well, we are about to start our open enrollment season.

04:25:50.560 --> 04:25:54.743
And so those students that are on wait lists are asked to re-enroll.

04:25:54.783 --> 04:25:56.364
They do not stay on a wait list.

04:25:56.404 --> 04:25:57.484
I understand that.

04:25:57.545 --> 04:26:06.830
So those 130 that you're speaking of, they wouldn't necessarily be the same 130 that are automatically called, hey, we have a spot for you.

04:26:07.430 --> 04:26:10.312
It would be a new fresh cohort, if you will,

04:26:10.672 --> 04:26:13.093
in the fall with our enrollment.

04:26:14.713 --> 04:26:16.594
We're starting our own enrollment season now.

04:26:17.094 --> 04:26:22.295
Okay, thank you.

04:26:22.895 --> 04:26:25.056
But wasn't one of the sites 50 miles away?

04:26:25.296 --> 04:26:27.797
So are you expecting students to go 50 miles?

04:26:28.677 --> 04:26:29.197
We have.

04:26:29.797 --> 04:26:31.198
I'm not expecting that.

04:26:31.418 --> 04:26:35.139
However, we have that option open for our families.

04:26:35.579 --> 04:26:39.080
We actually do have a few families that live kind of out towards that neck of the woods.

04:26:40.100 --> 04:26:56.350
But we would expect that the students that live in La Mesa or the surrounding environs of La Mesa, the communities around this, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley, El Cajon, what have you, would probably want to enroll in the La Mesa Spring Valley campus.

04:26:57.410 --> 04:26:58.551
Okay, Member Burr is next.

04:27:00.626 --> 04:27:04.248
So I think I'm more confused than I ever was.

04:27:05.849 --> 04:27:10.852
I'm trying to understand what the consequence would be of us not approving this petition.

04:27:11.592 --> 04:27:14.794
Because if I hear what you're saying, just let me make sure I understand this.

04:27:14.834 --> 04:27:20.937
It's a little bit about the current school, because we hear lots of wonderful things about the current school.

04:27:20.977 --> 04:27:22.638
So there is a school operating.

04:27:23.299 --> 04:27:28.282
My understanding is that that school is operating under Mountain Empire petition.

04:27:29.142 --> 04:27:35.988
So if we were not able to come to an agreement today about this petition, what happens to those kids?

04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:48.340
The students that are currently in our La Mesa facility, they would have the option to enroll in the school at East County, which is 50 miles away.

04:27:49.681 --> 04:27:53.244
I just heard you say that you were expecting them to move there anyway.

04:27:54.185 --> 04:27:56.266
No, I'm sorry if that's what you thought.

04:27:56.406 --> 04:28:09.390
No, like I had said, I would expect that students that live in La Mesa and the surrounding environments would want to stay with the La Mesa location and would move to the new facility or stay in La Mesa.

04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:11.590
They would not go 50 miles out to Campo.

04:28:11.650 --> 04:28:14.211
So they would stay in La Mesa in the church?

04:28:15.432 --> 04:28:18.554
We would no longer exist as College Prep Middle School.

04:28:20.035 --> 04:28:33.667
The facility or the school that we operate now, the one school that we operate, outside of this is the charter that we have, if I can back up the track, in 2010 we were authorized by Mountain Empire Unified School District.

04:28:34.227 --> 04:28:41.213
We operated happily in La Mesa Spring Valley, the one location rule applied at that time.

04:28:44.295 --> 04:28:54.000
We're kind of bebopping along in our location, and as we grew, we made a decision that we needed to start planning for a new facility.

04:28:54.221 --> 04:28:57.983
Again, we have the capacity for 240 students, and that's it.

04:28:58.023 --> 04:29:00.124
That's all the fire marshal will allow us.

04:29:01.064 --> 04:29:07.288
When we started to pursue the new facility, litigation was brought against us by the Little Mesa Spring Valley School District.

04:29:08.048 --> 04:29:12.353
Granted, we were five years operating in La Mesa.

04:29:12.373 --> 04:29:17.179
La Mesa Spring Valley actually provided our lunch services for three years.

04:29:17.819 --> 04:29:19.481
They provided transportation for our students.

04:29:19.521 --> 04:29:21.263
We bought back these services from them.

04:29:22.104 --> 04:29:27.630
They sued us alleging that they were never properly notified that we were located in La Mesa.

04:29:28.772 --> 04:29:43.043
In order to, I know, in order to avoid an expensive litigation, and I have to tell you this has been four years now of this, it's an expensive fight and we're a small school.

04:29:44.724 --> 04:29:51.770
Over such a technical concern, we decided that the best thing to do would be to look to be locally authorized.

04:29:52.771 --> 04:29:54.373
And I'm here to tell you that we tried.

04:29:54.773 --> 04:29:59.999
We've tried three times to be locally authorized by the La Mesa Spring Valley School District.

04:30:00.019 --> 04:30:04.103
And each time we have attempted, I mean, we've worked with them.

04:30:04.184 --> 04:30:09.830
We've, you know, I think things were very harmonious until the property, the project.

04:30:11.031 --> 04:30:13.434
That is what's going on.

04:30:13.595 --> 04:30:20.403
So you would be essentially closing our La Mesa facility without your support.

04:30:20.924 --> 04:30:26.151
And I hate to be able to just say that and be blunt, but that's what we're facing.

04:30:26.911 --> 04:30:30.613
We are looking forward to our plans of opening a school in Mountain Empire.

04:30:30.953 --> 04:30:33.455
We're looking forward to that, moving our school over there.

04:30:34.315 --> 04:30:44.120
Currently the Mountain Empire School District was deeded some property and we've been with Mountain Empire for eight years and enjoyed a wonderful, wonderful relationship with our authorizers.

04:30:44.140 --> 04:30:45.521
So we know these things are possible.

04:30:45.561 --> 04:30:47.282
They really are, I would need you to know that.

04:30:47.702 --> 04:30:53.005
It's possible for a charter school to work collaboratively, cooperatively with their sponsoring district.

04:30:53.585 --> 04:30:58.109
And in good faith, we tried to make that happen with La Mesa Spring Valley to no avail.

04:30:58.749 --> 04:31:08.437
When the first lawsuit was found to be, well, we ended up closing that charter, again, because we wanted to get locally authorized.

04:31:09.177 --> 04:31:11.739
La Mesa Spring Valley has brought litigation against us twice.

04:31:12.660 --> 04:31:19.425
Once, a week before school started this past year, they tried to get a restraining order to keep our students from coming to our school.

04:31:20.726 --> 04:31:23.169
Thankfully, the judge didn't see the beauty in that.

04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:28.374
And I must tell you that both those litigations, we prevailed in both of those.

04:31:29.135 --> 04:31:32.058
So it's been a very long journey to get to here with you.

04:31:32.518 --> 04:31:37.604
As you can imagine, when you're a business that's five years into operation and you're doing all the right things.

04:31:38.764 --> 04:31:44.548
You're growing, you're fiscally responsible, your kids are doing well, your families are supported.

04:31:45.348 --> 04:31:50.951
Every indicator that you throw at us, every measure that you give us, we've excelled.

04:31:51.591 --> 04:31:57.394
And at five years, we believe that we needed to grow in order to serve more students in our community.

04:31:57.875 --> 04:32:04.118
And then to be faced with this type of opposition, even though we've tried to become locally approved.

04:32:05.986 --> 04:32:10.389
That's the long story, and I apologize for the length, but it has.

04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:15.433
It's been four years of litigation, and that's what brings us here today.

04:32:15.473 --> 04:32:24.479
It's not the EC charter, because we enjoy a wonderful collaborative relationship with Mountain Empire, and we have a wonderful school planned for the fall.

04:32:25.339 --> 04:32:26.080
Board Member Sung.

04:32:26.100 --> 04:32:30.926
Petition in front of you, this is the one that will continue to serve the community we've been serving for eight years.

04:32:31.286 --> 04:32:38.935
The program that we've been showing you the history of, all of that wonderful thing, the parents that have been in our program, that is what you are.

04:32:39.776 --> 04:32:40.337
Member Sung.

04:32:43.424 --> 04:32:48.345
Thank you, that really was very helpful to get a little bit more of that context in the history.

04:32:48.825 --> 04:32:53.406
So the school that was closed down, that was located in La Mesa.

04:32:53.426 --> 04:32:54.487
Will essentially be replaced.

04:32:54.567 --> 04:32:56.487
It will be this, it will be this one.

04:32:56.627 --> 04:33:03.269
And the students who were in that school are temporarily under this other charter until such time you can get there.

04:33:03.289 --> 04:33:06.590
So that's where, those are the students who are actually going to be going to the school.

04:33:06.890 --> 04:33:07.110
Right.

04:33:07.850 --> 04:33:09.011
Okay, I think we have that.

04:33:09.031 --> 04:33:11.493
And I'm sorry for the confusion.

04:33:11.553 --> 04:33:12.293
That is enough.

04:33:13.214 --> 04:33:21.800
I'm ready for the district and the county to come up and make their rebuttals to what they've heard or add anything they want to add.

04:33:35.362 --> 04:33:39.765
I think that this illustrates the issue that La Mesa Spring Valley had in considering this petition.

04:33:40.325 --> 04:33:44.648
We have now heard it's going to be one school, two schools, we're moving, we're surrendering.

04:33:46.009 --> 04:33:53.875
They did not prevail in the litigation, they mooted the litigation by surrendering their charter, and so the judge actually said, you threw in the towel, they are the prevailing party.

04:33:54.375 --> 04:33:56.396
They did not prevail in the first litigation.

04:33:57.597 --> 04:34:02.321
The idea that they didn't engage in it, they appealed a demur to the Court of Appeals and had it tied up for three years.

04:34:03.541 --> 04:34:09.923
And so the litigation was certainly engaged in and avoided and it was ultimately successful and that is why we are here.

04:34:11.083 --> 04:34:15.545
And so the idea that they prevailed in both cases is completely inaccurate.

04:34:15.965 --> 04:34:23.067
The issue is that the same teachers that currently work at the facility in La Mesa are the same teachers that signed the Campo petition

04:34:23.467 --> 04:34:25.467
are the same teachers that were going to move there and teach.

04:34:25.987 --> 04:34:35.089
And at the time La Mesa Spring Valley was considering this petition, two school districts had the same petition with the same teachers and the same kids and the same funding to support it.

04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:37.209
This is all about that facility.

04:34:37.689 --> 04:34:44.191
And a public school district learning at a planning commission, the new public school facility was going to be built in their boundaries.

04:34:44.231 --> 04:34:46.131
That facility was not approved by Mountain Empire.

04:34:46.151 --> 04:34:48.371
Mountain Empire was not aware of that facility.

04:34:48.411 --> 04:34:51.552
Mountain Empire is 50 miles away and does not oversee this charter.

04:34:52.472 --> 04:34:52.892
They do not.

04:34:52.932 --> 04:34:54.653
They are serving La Mesa Spring Valley residents.

04:34:55.173 --> 04:35:01.016
And the district that is left to deal with all of the behavior that is not overseen is La Mesa Spring Valley.

04:35:01.956 --> 04:35:09.940
The students that are not served there, the homeless students, the special ed students, the English learners, the socioeconomically depressed students, those are all in La Mesa schools.

04:35:11.261 --> 04:35:12.121
We are looking at a district.

04:35:12.141 --> 04:35:13.421
We're not looking at that little neighborhood.

04:35:16.385 --> 04:35:19.727
The budget that you're looking at is totally different than the budget we considered.

04:35:20.167 --> 04:35:26.871
The budget Mesa Spring Valley considered was based on the exact same open funding balance as the one Mountain Empire granted.

04:35:27.231 --> 04:35:29.872
Mountain Empire had granted that when the Mesa Spring Valley considered it.

04:35:30.333 --> 04:35:40.158
So we would be granting a charter, a second charter with the same $1.5 million, the same eight teacher signatures, and the same 240 students.

04:35:41.119 --> 04:35:42.179
And how could we approve that?

04:35:42.239 --> 04:35:43.080
They were moving to Campo.

04:35:44.141 --> 04:35:45.041
That's what they said to us.

04:35:45.061 --> 04:35:46.382
That's what they represented in the litigation.

04:35:46.422 --> 04:35:47.402
That charter is closing.

04:35:47.482 --> 04:35:48.363
We're moving to Campo.

04:35:48.903 --> 04:35:50.384
Judge, don't order anything against us.

04:35:50.424 --> 04:35:51.184
We are already moving.

04:35:51.904 --> 04:36:00.848
That's why a second case was necessary, because on the eve of trial, they surrendered their charter and got a new one in one month with a few days' notice to La Mesa Spring Valley.

04:36:01.788 --> 04:36:05.830
And so this concept of we've been constantly trying to work together is really not accurate.

04:36:06.857 --> 04:36:10.960
Mr. Marshall actually went to their board meeting and encouraged them to work with him to submit a petition.

04:36:11.440 --> 04:36:18.426
And all we were requesting is to work with us on the facility, that we did not need a new public school facility built kitty corner to an existing school.

04:36:19.838 --> 04:36:21.059
They wouldn't work with us on the facility.

04:36:21.079 --> 04:36:22.240
They wouldn't tell us anything about it.

04:36:22.540 --> 04:36:24.701
There was a question asked about the documentation.

04:36:25.141 --> 04:36:30.605
That documentation was requested by La Mesa-Spring Valley several times, and they refused to provide it.

04:36:31.005 --> 04:36:34.407
We now know, in receiving it from you all, that it existed at that time.

04:36:35.448 --> 04:36:37.049
When we requested it, it existed.

04:36:37.429 --> 04:36:38.930
And it was provided to you, but not us.

04:36:39.471 --> 04:36:40.091
Not the county.

04:36:40.891 --> 04:36:41.612
That's a problem.

04:36:42.252 --> 04:36:43.093
That's a huge problem.

04:36:43.919 --> 04:36:47.980
How can a lease, we were entering a lease, backing a lease that we couldn't look at.

04:36:48.541 --> 04:36:49.801
That is a huge problem.

04:36:50.681 --> 04:36:54.363
And so the idea that it was all cooperative, they've been very cooperative with CDE.

04:36:54.643 --> 04:36:57.264
They've provided CDE any information CDE wants to know.

04:36:57.884 --> 04:36:59.404
With us, they wouldn't come to a meeting.

04:37:00.185 --> 04:37:02.646
They wouldn't even tell us about the deal, who owned the property.

04:37:03.246 --> 04:37:06.067
We learned through these documents it is owned by an out of state corporation.

04:37:06.527 --> 04:37:09.268
That was purchased by a public charter school in California with public

04:37:09.728 --> 04:37:18.514
Tax dollars that is now owned by a developer and so these are real issues that we were grappling with at the time and we didn't Have the clarity that you all are now being provided at all.

04:37:18.574 --> 04:37:26.999
We didn't have a developer come to the meetings We didn't have a single parent come to the meeting None of these folks that have spoke before you came to any of the Mesa Spring Valley board meetings.

04:37:27.019 --> 04:37:27.039
I

04:37:31.132 --> 04:37:31.913
To provide comment.

04:37:31.933 --> 04:37:32.734
They did not comment.

04:37:32.974 --> 04:37:34.235
They did not comment at the board meetings.

04:37:34.355 --> 04:37:55.292
I was there So anyway that I think that is there are obviously many perspectives on this and I I guess that is the reason why I think it is very difficult for this board in Sacramento to understand the difference between Mountain Empire, which is a very rural huge area with 3,000 students and La Mesa Spring Valley, which is an urban area with over 12,000

04:37:57.194 --> 04:38:09.527
And so it is it is very difficult I think for this board to actually have an understanding of what you're approving you're approving These petitioners to operate a second charter to have two charters 50 miles apart with two different authorizers with the same seven teacher signatures

04:38:11.124 --> 04:38:13.567
Superintendent, would you like to comment?

04:38:14.088 --> 04:38:14.448
Certainly.

04:38:15.850 --> 04:38:28.104
As was asked and stated, the information provided to the Department of Education is different than the information that was provided to La Mesa Spring Valley or the San Diego County Office of Education.

04:38:28.684 --> 04:38:36.469
We did request for any and all documents related to the land lease and all of that, and we're told that we've given you everything.

04:38:37.289 --> 04:38:42.352
I know, in seeing the documents that you guys have, that the second lease is dated May 5th, 2017.

04:38:44.673 --> 04:38:50.236
In a letter to us that you have dated June, he stated, we've given you everything.

04:38:51.056 --> 04:38:52.257
That is not the case.

04:38:52.297 --> 04:38:54.938
There was a second lease that actually would have clarified.

04:38:54.978 --> 04:38:59.240
If you look through the emails I sent, I said, hey, the budget doesn't really look like the budget should.

04:38:59.560 --> 04:39:00.681
Your numbers are different.

04:39:00.901 --> 04:39:05.863
As I use this letter of intent that we have, that doesn't calculate.

04:39:05.903 --> 04:39:07.544
There has to be something else going on.

04:39:07.844 --> 04:39:08.324
No, no, no.

04:39:08.425 --> 04:39:09.245
You have everything.

04:39:09.685 --> 04:39:38.787
i even so okay if you're not going to come to the meeting here's an email here's my questions just give me an answer and you guys have that i spelled it all out and we received zero information back it's almost as if they didn't want local approval i'm not going to say they didn't because i don't know but it's almost as if what i would tell you is that i offered and i think you have this as well i offered to meet with them to help review the petition the very first one as to expedite approval was the words that i put in the email

04:39:39.347 --> 04:39:41.949
They wrote back and said, no, no, no, we've got some legal stuff we're working on.

04:39:42.229 --> 04:39:42.609
We're good.

04:39:45.911 --> 04:39:46.411
Okay.

04:39:46.611 --> 04:39:47.492
So, anyway.

04:39:47.532 --> 04:39:49.233
Board member Rucker was next.

04:39:49.293 --> 04:39:51.094
Yeah, board member Rucker was next.

04:39:51.434 --> 04:39:53.195
You want to talk to the UNF?

04:39:53.295 --> 04:39:53.655
Okay.

04:39:53.695 --> 04:39:53.896
Yeah.

04:39:54.316 --> 04:39:54.676
Okay.

04:39:54.756 --> 04:40:04.622
So, when I studied all six of the charter hearings that we were looking at this for these two days, I actually thought this was going to be the easy one.

04:40:05.883 --> 04:40:20.578
I sought two petitions, two authorizers, two sites, and that became my simple way of understanding what this charter was about and attempting to unravel a morass of timelines and all of these things.

04:40:21.358 --> 04:40:40.150
I did go back and read through all the material, the petition, and I did craft and construct a timeline, and I do agree with you that there are some issues in the timeline about the communication, about what you requested, and whether or not you received it, so I do agree with you on that.

04:40:40.551 --> 04:40:50.317
But now, before I say this next sentence, Mr. President, I truly object to the behavior of people in the room

04:40:50.837 --> 04:40:54.160
in shouting out and shouting at people at the dais.

04:40:54.621 --> 04:41:08.613
It's not just the parents and other folks from the community, but we've had people who go to these board meetings regularly who are also behaving in inappropriate ways, and that needs to stop and be put in check.

04:41:09.694 --> 04:41:12.737
So the reason I said this, because now I'm going to say the next thing,

04:41:15.101 --> 04:41:28.171
While it may seem on the surface that there is some intentionality to be deceitful or to defraud in some way, I don't actually believe that was the issue.

04:41:28.192 --> 04:41:39.160
I think that probably there is some mismanagement, probably there's some misunderstanding, and probably there, I don't believe there was a purpose of, there was purposeful evasion.

04:41:39.581 --> 04:41:40.822
What I believe was,

04:41:41.542 --> 04:41:52.010
There was a desire to try to resolve what they felt was an untenable legal circumstance that they found themselves in, and they looked for the path of least resistance to try to resolve it.

04:41:52.410 --> 04:41:57.594
But the problem is they created more problems than they actually resolved.

04:41:57.895 --> 04:42:01.597
So my question to you is, because I want to be real clear,

04:42:02.458 --> 04:42:14.563
You have students who are otherwise students in your district who are currently at a charter school site in your district that's authorized by another school district.

04:42:15.043 --> 04:42:23.767
Going back to board member Burr's question, if this charter is not approved today, I have two questions.

04:42:24.127 --> 04:42:29.229
The first is if this charter is not approved today, where will those students be?

04:42:30.089 --> 04:42:32.091
So there is two options for those students.

04:42:32.512 --> 04:42:35.555
There is an existing charter with Mountain Empire.

04:42:35.635 --> 04:42:39.899
It's called College Prep Middle School East County, which will operate next year, I believe.

04:42:40.240 --> 04:42:44.063
The students could choose to attend College Prep Middle School East County.

04:42:44.164 --> 04:42:49.909
That would have to be located in the Mountain Empire School District, which is some 50 miles away.

04:42:50.250 --> 04:42:52.332
So some students may choose to do that.

04:42:52.512 --> 04:42:52.993
I don't know.

04:42:53.834 --> 04:43:02.684
The students who are not choosing to follow to the College Prep Peace County, they would then need to enroll in another school in the La Mesa community.

04:43:02.804 --> 04:43:11.174
That could be one of our schools, Parkway Middle School, one of the elementary schools, since it's a five through eight program, they would be served both in elementary and middle schools.

04:43:11.774 --> 04:43:25.256
If they don't reside within the La Mesa boundaries, and as you heard, some of these students reside in other neighboring districts, whether that is El Cajon or in San Diego Unified, those students would then need to find a school in their community.

04:43:25.276 --> 04:43:28.837
There's also other charter schools that operate within the community.

04:43:28.977 --> 04:43:33.638
I would tell you that La Mesa Spring Valley, we operate three 4th through 8th grade academy schools.

04:43:34.098 --> 04:43:39.539
The La Mesa Arts Academy focused on the performing arts, and so kids would have to find a place or go to these schools.

04:43:39.599 --> 04:43:44.324
So then that takes me to my second question, and this goes back to this building.

04:43:44.764 --> 04:43:47.587
So I do agree with you that they knew they had this building.

04:43:48.168 --> 04:43:54.374
I am confused about whether they bought it, if they gave money to an out-of-state entity, if they have a lease.

04:43:55.015 --> 04:43:56.557
All of that's very confusing to me.

04:43:56.638 --> 04:44:00.223
I do know that there was an exchange of state funds with somebody.

04:44:00.583 --> 04:44:05.851
I don't know if it means they own it or they lease it, but I am very clear as of the spring last year, they have a building.

04:44:06.452 --> 04:44:09.697
Where do you think this building is in your district?

04:44:10.475 --> 04:44:17.019
So this building is now a old church lot that is in Spring Valley on Madrid Way.

04:44:17.179 --> 04:44:22.682
It is across the street, Caddy Corner, from an existing elementary school, Casadero Elementary.

04:44:22.883 --> 04:44:30.087
Okay, so relative to the building these students are currently going to school in, how far away will this new building be?

04:44:31.768 --> 04:44:35.030
Not very, very far, maybe five to eight miles.

04:44:35.370 --> 04:44:45.096
Okay, so if this charter is approved and they're allowed to go forward with developing this building, I'm assuming they're saying or asserting that the building can be ready for them.

04:44:51.360 --> 04:44:52.000
About nine months.

04:44:52.100 --> 04:44:52.981
In about nine months.

04:44:53.001 --> 04:44:59.144
So in the meanwhile, where do you believe these students, if the charter is approved, where do you believe these students will be?

04:44:59.364 --> 04:45:07.929
I believe the plan that has been presented would be that for the first start of the 2018-19 school year, students would remain in the existing facility.

04:45:08.549 --> 04:45:13.992
As the new facility became online, then they would be migrated to the new facility sometime mid-year.

04:45:14.292 --> 04:45:17.934
Okay, so that's where I started getting confused when the original presentation was made.

04:45:17.974 --> 04:45:29.580
So your La Mesa students who are currently housed in a building that is being authorized as a charter in another district would actually leave this building, go to the new building site in nine months once it's completed.

04:45:29.881 --> 04:45:39.986
They would still be La Mesa students, Spring Valley students in a building in La Mesa Spring Valley in a charter authorized by this board, by this board if the petition is approved.

04:45:40.466 --> 04:45:40.887
Does that,

04:45:41.827 --> 04:46:00.836
So while the board is not a party to any of your litigations and any of your conflicts and issues that you have with these authorizers, as it directly relates to this building and those students, what issues get resolved by that for the students and your district?

04:46:02.857 --> 04:46:19.353
So if the state, the board, were to authorize the College Prep Middle School in Mesa Spring Valley, which is the one that is there, then the issue that would be resolved for our students would be they would have their charter school within their community for next year.

04:46:19.533 --> 04:46:19.853
Okay.

04:46:20.074 --> 04:46:22.476
And I hope you know I'm being very honest.

04:46:22.816 --> 04:46:25.038
I'm not couching my words at all.

04:46:25.058 --> 04:46:25.679
I'm telling you the truth.

04:46:25.819 --> 04:46:36.944
Okay, so the issue that remains for me and the issue I'm still I'm confused by and it is an issue that you did raise is about the funds and the funding and how the building was procured.

04:46:37.704 --> 04:46:48.989
Does that none of this approval process here unravels those fiscal issues or does it clarify any of those fiscal issues that are still very murky even for me today?

04:46:49.409 --> 04:47:03.492
And I would add that one of the questions that was asked is that if the school goes out into the market to get bonds to purchase the building, who is liable for those bonds if they are defaulted upon?

04:47:03.992 --> 04:47:05.833
But they've already given somebody some money.

04:47:06.493 --> 04:47:08.894
They have entered into a 20-year lease.

04:47:08.934 --> 04:47:09.874
I mean, this is my understanding.

04:47:09.914 --> 04:47:11.114
I haven't seen the new documents.

04:47:11.134 --> 04:47:14.075
But I can tell you from the old documents, because I'm very familiar with those, if you want.

04:47:15.035 --> 04:47:15.215
Yes.

04:47:15.415 --> 04:47:15.596
Okay.

04:47:16.036 --> 04:47:21.079
So they've entered into a 20-year lease to rent facility.

04:47:21.200 --> 04:47:22.400
They're not buying that facility.

04:47:22.440 --> 04:47:26.423
There's buyout options in the lease, but the lease isn't a lease purchase.

04:47:26.463 --> 04:47:27.024
It's a lease.

04:47:27.464 --> 04:47:32.628
And then at the year three, you can purchase it for 125% of the construction cost or whatever.

04:47:32.668 --> 04:47:33.048
That kind of thing.

04:47:33.068 --> 04:47:33.168
Right.

04:47:33.268 --> 04:47:33.789
I understood.

04:47:33.969 --> 04:47:36.210
So yeah, that's where I started getting confused again.

04:47:36.250 --> 04:47:36.991
Did they buy it?

04:47:37.031 --> 04:47:37.852
Are they leasing it?

04:47:37.892 --> 04:47:41.634
It's a lease with an option to buy, but the buyout isn't part of the lease payments.

04:47:41.654 --> 04:47:43.756
The lease payments are separate from the buyout.

04:47:43.976 --> 04:47:44.437
Thank you.

04:47:44.457 --> 04:47:46.703
I appreciate, I thank you.

04:47:46.743 --> 04:47:47.424
I appreciate.

04:47:47.445 --> 04:47:47.846
You're very welcome.

04:47:47.926 --> 04:47:51.334
You have unwrapped some other, you have unwrapped some other concerns that I had.

04:47:51.414 --> 04:47:51.735
Thank you.

04:47:53.635 --> 04:47:55.817
Yeah, Bruce is next.

04:47:55.837 --> 04:48:00.460
Well, I just want to pursue this one if I could in that regard.

04:48:00.480 --> 04:48:06.125
Can CDE come up and talk about what you saw?

04:48:06.145 --> 04:48:13.210
I mean, we have allegations about the facility and how it's financed and people are operating off of different documents.

04:48:13.731 --> 04:48:15.792
I'd like to hear what you saw

04:48:17.173 --> 04:48:27.036
I don't think, in my own personal view is there's nothing inherently evil about going out and getting a private developer and getting them to build a school.

04:48:28.896 --> 04:48:37.238
It always to me, you know, the idea that all of these things have to be financed by the public and that anything else is evil, I never agreed with.

04:48:37.318 --> 04:48:42.139
So if it is, but what they explain never made sense to me either.

04:48:43.019 --> 04:48:45.340
If it is a lease payment,

04:48:45.900 --> 04:48:52.827
And the developer then has a guaranteed enrollment of these students if developer can make money on this.

04:48:52.887 --> 04:48:54.889
So, but they were talking about buying it.

04:48:54.989 --> 04:48:58.392
So, can you tell us what then this they're saying about this?

04:49:04.344 --> 04:49:13.067
Okay, what we did see is that the petitioner will finance the project costs through the lease payments.

04:49:13.767 --> 04:49:23.350
So we took into account the $42,000 that they stated would be the lease payment for the facility.

04:49:23.810 --> 04:49:31.553
So we took that into account into their financials, not the option to then purchase that if it goes down that path.

04:49:32.213 --> 04:49:46.277
Yeah, because we are looking at it within that makes sense to me where they were going to get this money to buy the building was in that that was the way they lease payments or lease payments and using a developer to get it is not to me a problem.

04:49:46.377 --> 04:49:49.118
But yeah, I couldn't believe how they were going to buy this thing.

04:49:51.365 --> 04:49:58.031
So just for the board's understanding, the state does have programs.

04:49:58.352 --> 04:50:02.035
They're housed over at the School Finance Authority.

04:50:02.115 --> 04:50:08.522
And there are other agencies throughout the state that enable charter schools to issue

04:50:11.344 --> 04:50:16.426
tax exempt bonds to finance the purchase of facilities.

04:50:18.727 --> 04:50:21.368
I presume that's what they were referring to.

04:50:21.568 --> 04:50:30.092
And those bonds are typically secured by a sort of a lease arrangement, a lease payment arrangement.

04:50:31.716 --> 04:50:45.465
become the, or the lease payments for the charter school, for the facilities, go to pay the interest and principal on the bonds until the bonds are retired.

04:50:45.565 --> 04:50:53.990
So I presume that's what, you probably talked to the charter folks themselves, but I presume that's what they're planning.

04:50:54.010 --> 04:50:54.971
Go ahead with the leases.

04:50:55.011 --> 04:50:56.352
Board Member Holliday.

04:50:56.692 --> 04:50:59.694
Well, I don't want to rush things, but... Yeah, we're getting along.

04:51:02.324 --> 04:51:17.167
I would be prepared to make a motion, and the reason I feel comfortable with this motion is because I do believe that we have a group of educators that are providing a quality program for their students.

04:51:17.967 --> 04:51:21.088
I don't understand what all the lawsuits are about.

04:51:21.328 --> 04:51:23.188
I don't understand the intent of the lawsuits.

04:51:23.268 --> 04:51:25.909
I don't understand the outcome of the lawsuits.

04:51:26.950 --> 04:51:40.910
But I do understand that this is a group who unfortunately originally was authorized outside this district, and that has created a great deal of difficulty on all sides.

04:51:45.086 --> 04:51:46.728
This school approved today.

04:51:46.888 --> 04:51:55.860
It will mean that there will be a continuation of this school's program and the teachers and parents and the family at this at this location for

04:51:56.619 --> 04:51:59.602
a period of time until this other facility comes online.

04:52:00.984 --> 04:52:06.870
I have over the years dealt with these sorts of development companies in my own experience.

04:52:06.970 --> 04:52:09.553
I have been in and out of lease arrangements.

04:52:10.454 --> 04:52:12.135
They do come from out of state often.

04:52:12.176 --> 04:52:14.218
It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with that.

04:52:14.278 --> 04:52:15.819
They come from in state other times.

04:52:18.062 --> 04:52:24.126
They all have to have above-board practices, and I don't think that puts us at a liability.

04:52:25.848 --> 04:52:28.650
I am concerned about the demographics as always.

04:52:29.270 --> 04:52:37.957
There's never a reason why a charter school can't adequately mirror the demographics of the district.

04:52:38.507 --> 04:52:46.911
I do believe that there has been a challenge with only bringing in a handful of kids each year and not really an outreach program.

04:52:46.931 --> 04:52:48.592
They haven't really focused on that.

04:52:49.012 --> 04:53:00.357
But I do think that when the new facility comes online that it will provide them an opportunity to do some different and orchestrated outreach.

04:53:00.797 --> 04:53:02.678
And I certainly hope that that is the case.

04:53:02.738 --> 04:53:05.239
We don't want to let that drop at all.

04:53:05.993 --> 04:53:11.216
Anyway, I will recommend approval of the CDE's recommendation.

04:53:12.317 --> 04:53:13.077
And I'll second.

04:53:15.098 --> 04:53:16.399
Any further board discussion?

04:53:19.321 --> 04:53:19.621
Okay.

04:53:20.321 --> 04:53:20.641
All right.

04:53:21.061 --> 04:53:22.502
All those in favor, raise your hands.

04:53:22.522 --> 04:53:25.204
Okay, those opposed.

04:53:29.966 --> 04:53:31.587
Okay, the board will take a recess.

04:53:34.636 --> 04:53:35.957
We'll come back at 2.20.

04:53:37.757 --> 04:53:46.982
Okay, the board will reconvene and we're on item 23, the petition for Phoenix Charter Academy in Shasta County, California.

04:53:48.563 --> 04:53:53.305
Item 23 is an appeal by Phoenix Charter Academy to establish a charter school.

04:53:53.985 --> 04:54:03.830
Pursuant to Ed Code section J1, petitioners for a charter school that have been denied at the local level may petition the state board for approval of the charter subject to certain conditions.

04:54:05.999 --> 04:54:12.365
On May 9th, 2017, Shasta Union High School District voted to deny the petition on a vote of five to zero.

04:54:13.466 --> 04:54:21.793
June 13th, 2017, Whitmore Union Elementary School District voted to approve the petition on a vote of three to two.

04:54:22.314 --> 04:54:28.119
So Phoenix is currently open and operating under the Whitmore Union Elementary School District.

04:54:29.200 --> 04:54:32.943
Staff, our understanding is the school will continue to operate under Whitmore.

04:54:35.962 --> 04:54:45.930
So after they are currently operating under Whitmore, they then went to the Shasta County Office of Education to get their petition approved there.

04:54:46.511 --> 04:54:51.295
The Shasta County Office of Ed voted to deny the petition on a vote of seven to zero.

04:54:51.875 --> 04:54:56.719
And so now the petition for Phoenix Charter is before the State Board of Education on appeal.

04:54:58.480 --> 04:55:01.543
This is a non-classroom based program.

04:55:04.059 --> 04:55:10.025
To give you a little history, Phoenix was previously operated as the Academy of Personalized Learning.

04:55:10.825 --> 04:55:19.153
They were authorized from August 18th, 2009 through June 30th, 2017, and they were authorized by Gateway Unified School District.

04:55:19.914 --> 04:55:25.038
APL offered to voluntarily close as of June 30th, 2017 prior to revocation from Gateway.

04:55:27.360 --> 04:55:37.545
PCA, again, is currently operating at the same location as when they were Apple, when they were Academy of Personalized Learning, so they are at that same location.

04:55:37.565 --> 04:55:38.946
I know, I'm sorry.

04:55:38.966 --> 04:55:42.587
I'm going to try and make this less confusing.

04:55:42.607 --> 04:55:43.648
I know it can be confusing.

04:55:44.108 --> 04:55:45.569
Okay.

04:55:45.749 --> 04:55:50.411
Again, the proposed grade level is K-12, independent study, non-classroom based program.

04:55:51.091 --> 04:55:52.012
Current enrollment is 331.

04:55:52.552 --> 04:55:59.756
And based on the information received, they plan to stay at that enrollment through the 2022-23 school year.

04:56:00.516 --> 04:56:09.220
It is a resource center located in Redding, California, which is within the Shasta County, but outside the geographic boundaries of Whitmore Union.

04:56:09.420 --> 04:56:10.641
So that's why they're here.

04:56:11.543 --> 04:56:17.202
The Resource Center includes administrative offices, meeting spaces, a school library, computer labs, and classrooms.

04:56:19.218 --> 04:56:27.501
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on February 7th, 2018, and they moved staff recommendation to deny the petition.

04:56:28.061 --> 04:56:36.844
Four commissioners voted in favor, three voted against, and as you know, five votes are needed to move the recommendation to the State Board, so no recommendation moved forward.

04:56:37.664 --> 04:56:42.866
The petitioner did submit additional information after the ACCS meeting that was reviewed by CDE staff.

04:56:44.662 --> 04:56:51.568
The CDE recommends that the State Board hold a public hearing to deny the request to establish Phoenix Charter Academy.

04:56:52.308 --> 04:56:58.874
Our denial is based on demonstratively unlikely to implement the program and being unfamiliar with some of the requirements of law.

04:56:59.614 --> 04:57:13.526
They have a marginal fiscal viability, unsuccessful history, previously operated as the Academy of Personalized Learning, and they do have some deficiencies still, even after we reviewed their additional information that we found in their charter elements.

04:57:15.899 --> 04:57:21.301
PCA previously operated as Apple, as I mentioned earlier, charter school during this time period.

04:57:21.681 --> 04:57:27.122
So they were authorized by Gateway Unified School District, same resource center location in Redding.

04:57:28.063 --> 04:57:32.824
On October 15, 2015, APL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

04:57:33.604 --> 04:57:42.287
On November 9, 2016, the Gateway Board approved issuance of a notice of violation to be issued to the charter school as APL.

04:57:43.807 --> 04:57:54.613
Their reasons for the notice of violation was that they were violating the law, that they were not within the geographic boundaries of the district at the time, and they were failing to demonstrate increases in pupil achievement.

04:57:54.673 --> 04:57:56.794
Those were the grounds the district had at the time.

04:57:58.533 --> 04:58:06.541
February 22nd, 2017, the Gateway Board provided APL a notice of intent to revoke and a notice of facts in support of revocation.

04:58:07.262 --> 04:58:14.149
The Gateway Board took no action because APL offered to voluntarily close as of June 30th, 2017.

04:58:16.792 --> 04:58:25.077
March 10, 2017, APL stakeholders then drafted and submitted the Phoenix petition to the Shasta Union High School District.

04:58:26.037 --> 04:58:36.504
Then it was subsequently denied by the Shasta Union High School District, approved by the Whitmore Union Elementary School District, and then denied by the Shasta County Office of Education.

04:58:39.031 --> 04:58:46.257
And then these are the elements in the charter petition that even with additional information, we do feel that there are some deficiencies in the charter.

04:58:47.498 --> 04:58:49.279
I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.

04:58:50.801 --> 04:58:51.421
Okay, thank you.

04:58:51.781 --> 04:58:53.303
Technical questions for CDE.

04:58:57.949 --> 04:59:06.114
Did they they submitted a petition to Shasta County just as a countywide petition or that was an appeal petition?

04:59:06.634 --> 04:59:15.881
That was well it was an appeal petition from the appeal that when they submitted to Shasta the high school district because they are located within their bounds.

04:59:18.442 --> 04:59:20.884
Okay then we're ready for the public hearing.

04:59:22.165 --> 04:59:25.309
And so I'm going to open the public hearing.

04:59:25.449 --> 04:59:26.971
Each side has 10 minutes.

04:59:27.912 --> 04:59:36.982
So I'll start with the petitioners who want to have the state board approve the charter and they'll have 10 minutes and then the opponents 10 minutes.

05:00:04.221 --> 05:00:04.722
Here we go.

05:00:21.286 --> 05:00:29.533
I'm Dr. Patricia Doherty, and I would like to start this afternoon with thanking all of you for sharing your time with us and giving us time to appear in front of you today.

05:00:29.553 --> 05:00:32.035
I would like to introduce Carl Yoder.

05:00:32.095 --> 05:00:35.297
He is here to discuss our fiscal viability with you.

05:00:35.918 --> 05:00:40.501
He is a principal of DMS, and they do our back office.

05:00:40.942 --> 05:00:41.242
Thank you.

05:00:44.597 --> 05:00:45.238
Good afternoon.

05:00:46.018 --> 05:00:53.342
Patricia had asked me, due to the importance of the fiscal viability of the Charter, that I speak for a few minutes at the start of the presentation.

05:00:54.023 --> 05:00:57.825
Patricia will then go through the PowerPoint and provide additional information.

05:00:57.845 --> 05:01:00.306
I am speaking solely on the fiscal viability.

05:01:01.127 --> 05:01:05.770
I really wanted to talk about four major points in the next few minutes.

05:01:06.630 --> 05:01:11.214
The first one has to do with the individual findings of fact presented in the CDE analysis.

05:01:11.955 --> 05:01:14.717
We commend CDE staff for their work.

05:01:15.598 --> 05:01:19.401
We continue to have some minor differences of opinion on a number of items.

05:01:20.522 --> 05:01:23.384
Lottery funding, we did not include in the first year.

05:01:23.965 --> 05:01:27.087
LCFF funding is updated, provides additional revenue.

05:01:27.688 --> 05:01:33.693
Mandate block grant has been increased and provides actually additional revenue over what was in our original petition.

05:01:34.954 --> 05:01:47.727
We can go through the individual items and I am happy to answer questions, but I would really like to move to my second point, which is for the sake of argument, let's take at face value the conclusions that CDE arrived at.

05:01:48.588 --> 05:01:50.630
That is a very small surplus, $655 in the first year.

05:01:53.072 --> 05:02:02.581
In year two, $177,000 surplus, and that brings the school to a 5.5% reserve, and then up to 7.3% in the third year.

05:02:04.023 --> 05:02:08.087
Under SBE's own guidelines in the California Code of Regulations,

05:02:08.707 --> 05:02:14.872
It states that charter schools approved by SBE shall be given two years to reach the minimum reserve threshold.

05:02:15.493 --> 05:02:23.940
And in this case, CDE's own findings show that the charter meets that reserve level after the second year, and the reserve grows after that.

05:02:25.401 --> 05:02:39.351
The third point was for clarity, we had not included any beginning balances that were transferred over from APL, but the reality is APL continued to be financially viable.

05:02:39.531 --> 05:02:42.593
The closure was not due to a lack of financial resources.

05:02:43.373 --> 05:02:47.897
The school met all of its operational commitments and closed with net asset balance of about $505,000.

05:02:50.077 --> 05:02:55.504
As the school is currently operating, Phoenix has received those net assets.

05:02:56.345 --> 05:03:00.390
Phoenix under Whitmore now has a net asset balance and will end at about 526,000.

05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:05.991
when that $526,000 is taken into account.

05:03:06.231 --> 05:03:20.844
In other words, if SBE approves this charter, the SBE-approved charter opens next year, that new charter will begin with a net asset balance of over $500,000, effectively negating the claim that the school would have insufficient resources.

05:03:21.665 --> 05:03:34.754
And my fourth point, before I turn it over to Patricia, as the board is well aware, charter schools are encouraged to be approved, and they should only be denied if they are demonstrably unlikely to succeed.

05:03:35.474 --> 05:03:39.357
In this situation, Phoenix is operating successfully.

05:03:39.717 --> 05:03:48.963
It's operating under Whitmore, is operating successfully this year, showing a surplus, and the only reason that the school is before SPE, as Patricia will outline,

05:03:49.724 --> 05:03:54.030
is due to legal issues having to do with Shasta Union High School District.

05:03:54.130 --> 05:04:02.123
With that, I'm available for any questions after the presentation, but I'm turning it over to Patricia to continue the PowerPoint for the remaining of the 10 minutes.

05:04:02.423 --> 05:04:02.684
Thank you.

05:04:08.493 --> 05:04:14.778
As Carl had stated, Phoenix Charter Academy is successfully operating with the sponsorship of Whitmore.

05:04:15.298 --> 05:04:19.161
We are also being relentlessly attacked by the traditional districts.

05:04:19.721 --> 05:04:23.824
We are operating with Whitmore on an exception.

05:04:24.025 --> 05:04:29.589
There is not the real estate in Whitmore to house our program in its totality.

05:04:33.111 --> 05:04:37.775
Imagine what it must be like to run a charter school that you are continually under attack for.

05:04:38.635 --> 05:04:46.479
And we do have to defend when we are attacked legally by the traditional districts in our area.

05:04:48.920 --> 05:04:50.961
I'm forced to spend public funds to do that.

05:04:51.601 --> 05:04:54.803
I would rather buy Chromebooks for our students.

05:04:55.543 --> 05:04:57.764
And I don't have that option because I have to be able to defend.

05:05:02.441 --> 05:05:13.017
And if in the event SBE does decide to vote for us today to sponsor us, we will be closing our Whitmore charter and transferring our assets.

05:05:18.676 --> 05:05:24.440
One of the claims from CDE was that we had not provided training for our ESL parents.

05:05:25.201 --> 05:05:33.266
We are developing an ESL program within our LCAP and within our first and second charter years.

05:05:34.667 --> 05:05:44.194
Along with that, it is also in our LCAP, which we have sent you a copy of, that we are developing parent training for not just our ESL independent study students,

05:05:45.638 --> 05:05:48.160
which we will, I'm sure, have moving forward.

05:05:48.200 --> 05:05:49.121
We don't have now.

05:05:49.401 --> 05:05:55.185
We're also developing those programs for our population of independent study students.

05:05:56.346 --> 05:06:02.050
We do have measurable pupil outcomes, and they are listed in our LCAP.

05:06:02.411 --> 05:06:04.412
We have many things that we benchmark with.

05:06:04.492 --> 05:06:05.793
One of them is ed performance.

05:06:06.454 --> 05:06:11.277
And being our first year, we did set a goal of

05:06:12.879 --> 05:06:19.647
our students being able to make across the board a minimum of a 5% growth in their academic progress.

05:06:21.516 --> 05:06:27.537
The next claim was that we lacked a description of our employee qualifications.

05:06:27.657 --> 05:06:29.418
We did send you all of our credentials.

05:06:29.598 --> 05:06:32.139
All of our staff are fully credentialed and qualified.

05:06:32.159 --> 05:06:37.220
There was also a remark made about our SPED team not being qualified.

05:06:37.780 --> 05:06:41.421
We have a speech and language pathologist who works with us.

05:06:41.721 --> 05:06:46.102
It is a full-time position and she is fully qualified with all certifications.

05:06:46.202 --> 05:06:48.823
We have an RSP teacher who is with us.

05:06:49.063 --> 05:06:49.903
She has her

05:06:51.823 --> 05:06:54.665
her foreign language credential, her EL certification.

05:06:54.725 --> 05:07:03.211
She has her RSP credential, her learning handicap credential as our RSP person.

05:07:03.651 --> 05:07:05.933
The administration holds a doctorate degree.

05:07:06.213 --> 05:07:08.075
I am fully qualified.

05:07:08.155 --> 05:07:15.180
I have also had two years of leadership training with the SELPA as well as CBO training with CSDC.

05:07:17.082 --> 05:07:19.304
You do have access to all of our credentials.

05:07:19.324 --> 05:07:20.865
We did send them with a matrix.

05:07:21.626 --> 05:07:25.409
I am here to say that we are fully qualified and we are fully committed to our students.

05:07:27.810 --> 05:07:31.373
There was also a claim regarding our admission requirements.

05:07:33.575 --> 05:07:43.563
PCA's admission and enrollment requirements are aligned in strict accordance with the law and we do not prevent barriers for any of our students.

05:07:45.402 --> 05:07:51.570
As was stated earlier, we did surrender our charter back to Gateway Unified School District.

05:07:51.690 --> 05:07:53.052
That was a strategic move.

05:07:53.472 --> 05:07:56.896
It was also noted for the record that we had filed Chapter 11.

05:07:58.217 --> 05:08:00.438
I think it was called Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

05:08:00.798 --> 05:08:03.200
It was called Chapter 11 reorganization.

05:08:03.220 --> 05:08:04.441
Those are two different things.

05:08:04.961 --> 05:08:10.284
When we had stood before the judge requesting Chapter 11, that was also strategic.

05:08:10.304 --> 05:08:12.105
We were being attacked viciously.

05:08:12.986 --> 05:08:21.390
Our resources were being eaten up rapidly, and we could not gain any control of the chaos that was happening to us.

05:08:22.451 --> 05:08:25.613
When we stood before that judge, if we had been insolvent,

05:08:26.531 --> 05:08:31.834
He would have immediately changed us from a Chapter 11 to a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13.

05:08:32.934 --> 05:08:34.455
We were never insolvent.

05:08:34.895 --> 05:08:36.336
It was a strategic move.

05:08:36.796 --> 05:08:41.638
I am more than willing to answer any questions that you have for us on that period in our life.

05:08:42.279 --> 05:08:52.724
We did approach, after the Shasta Anderson decision, we did approach Gateway Unified School District and ask for a waiver and they denied it outright.

05:08:53.965 --> 05:08:58.265
So we were moving forward to operate with the letter of the law.

05:08:59.272 --> 05:09:03.214
Shasta Union High School District is in our geographic boundaries, they denied.

05:09:03.814 --> 05:09:14.800
Whitmore was willing to take us on to preserve not only our charter school for our families and our students, but to, they really do believe in our program and we have a wonderful working relationship with them.

05:09:15.160 --> 05:09:25.785
And they do know we're here today and I do believe you have in your handouts the letter from Dr. Robbins in our support and I apologize he's on a cruise and couldn't be here today.

05:09:26.486 --> 05:09:27.226
He's the lucky one.

05:09:28.686 --> 05:09:34.207
and we are here to answer any of your questions and add any clarity that we possibly can for you.

05:09:39.649 --> 05:09:39.989
Thank you.

05:09:40.249 --> 05:09:45.550
Okay, that completes your presentation and now we'll move to the opponents for 10 minutes.

05:09:46.750 --> 05:09:48.011
We're under the public hearing.

05:09:48.291 --> 05:09:49.311
Public hearing is open.

05:10:01.021 --> 05:10:02.463
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

05:10:02.503 --> 05:10:03.664
My name's Adam Ferber.

05:10:03.845 --> 05:10:06.368
I'm the lawyer for the Shasta County Office of Education.

05:10:06.809 --> 05:10:12.015
Just wanted to kind of identify myself and let you know that I'm here for any questions and to introduce Ms.

05:10:12.075 --> 05:10:15.620
Amy Barker from Shasta County Office of Education who has a statement.

05:10:16.314 --> 05:10:27.866
Hi, I'm Amy Barker, Executive Director of Administrator Support Services, where I support charter schools and the regular schools.

05:10:28.647 --> 05:10:33.352
I oversee and provide support to two of our charter schools as well.

05:10:34.112 --> 05:10:39.576
Our office and governing board opposed the grant of Phoenix Appeal.

05:10:40.317 --> 05:10:50.884
Our main concern among many is that over time the school's marginally viable budget, as it is called in your staff report, with no 5% reserve and a 655 ending balance for fiscal year 2018-19.

05:10:57.689 --> 05:11:06.276
is unsustainable and is a strong predictor of future fiscal instability that will inevitably impact students.

05:11:07.957 --> 05:11:17.525
When the school's petition came to us, our office review of the financial plan disclosed 13 substantial concerns about its fiscal viability.

05:11:18.525 --> 05:11:20.627
These concerns continue to be present.

05:11:21.568 --> 05:11:25.571
Phoenix began operation under Whitmore, as stated earlier,

05:11:26.291 --> 05:11:26.912
July of 2017.

05:11:28.914 --> 05:11:40.084
However, it did not submit STRS contribution that it deducted from payroll earnings to the county office until January of this year, January 16th of this year.

05:11:41.265 --> 05:11:47.751
STRS notified us in November of 2017 that a Phoenix employee account was 120 days past due.

05:11:52.165 --> 05:11:55.712
for deductions owned under the STRS buyback program.

05:11:56.313 --> 05:12:02.004
Those past due funds for November through January were not remitted until the end of January.

05:12:04.164 --> 05:12:08.406
How the school handled those funds during the time raises a red flag.

05:12:09.066 --> 05:12:15.549
This is especially true in light of the school's unsuccessful financial history as APL.

05:12:16.889 --> 05:12:28.875
We regard Phoenix and APL as one in the same, essentially as a single school without any demonstrated history of fiscal health over an extended time period.

05:12:29.895 --> 05:12:37.645
The last minute budget revisions do very little to reassure us it is a good candidate for sustained future success.

05:12:38.686 --> 05:12:46.756
We believe that the efforts of our office and our governing board in considering the Phoenix appeal were extensive and conscientious.

05:12:47.591 --> 05:13:01.474
We believe that our governing board's denial of the petition was absolutely correct for fiscal instability as well as for other programmatic inadequacies outlined in the reasons we denied the charter back in June.

05:13:02.314 --> 05:13:06.395
Nothing that the school has done since then has changed our mind.

05:13:07.015 --> 05:13:10.476
We therefore ask the board to deny the appeal.

05:13:10.496 --> 05:13:11.976
Thank you.

05:13:19.113 --> 05:13:19.994
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

05:13:20.014 --> 05:13:20.815
My name is Jim Cloney.

05:13:20.855 --> 05:13:23.138
I'm superintendent for the Shasta Union High School District.

05:13:23.578 --> 05:13:27.502
My first visit to the state board, I wish to thank you for your service on behalf of the students of our state.

05:13:27.703 --> 05:13:32.268
I know having worked with the board for 10 years as superintendent, it is a thankless job, so I do appreciate that.

05:13:33.269 --> 05:13:39.936
Also, I have to say, Shasta Union High School District, I was not aware up until the last couple of years how often Shasta came up in your conversations.

05:13:42.466 --> 05:13:43.287
We are aware of that.

05:13:43.307 --> 05:13:45.308
So I'm going to make two quick points.

05:13:45.328 --> 05:13:57.234
I know we have other folks who need to speak, but the first is to reiterate, and I know this is a point that's made by other districts, is we consider ourselves charter friendly.

05:13:57.355 --> 05:14:01.477
We do have two longstanding charters that our district has supported for many, many years.

05:14:02.297 --> 05:14:05.441
Shasta Charter Academy, which I know the board is familiar with.

05:14:06.222 --> 05:14:14.972
We have supported that charter since the late 90s, and we also have University Preparatory School, which we actually just two nights ago renewed their charter for an additional five years.

05:14:15.012 --> 05:14:20.178
So we do consider ourselves good supporters of charters and a good authorization district.

05:14:21.340 --> 05:14:27.185
The second point I wanted to make is just with respect to the Phoenix Charter Academy proposal.

05:14:28.045 --> 05:14:30.988
Just roughly one year ago, I met with Ms.

05:14:31.028 --> 05:14:31.388
Dougherty.

05:14:31.769 --> 05:14:32.149
I've known Ms.

05:14:32.189 --> 05:14:33.030
Dougherty for many years.

05:14:33.290 --> 05:14:36.433
I know many people associated with Phoenix Charter Academy as friends and colleagues.

05:14:37.900 --> 05:14:44.646
We had an open conversation, a very transparent one, I believe, when she was looking for a district to consider their charter.

05:14:45.266 --> 05:14:57.157
I believe we were very transparent in that conversation about we would certainly do our due diligence, that we held no preconceived notions against Phoenix Charter Academy or APL or either of those two entities.

05:14:58.097 --> 05:15:01.901
We believe our process in reviewing the 16 points in the charter was thorough.

05:15:02.401 --> 05:15:07.224
And our board did come to a unanimous 5-0 decision to make the denial.

05:15:07.384 --> 05:15:14.489
So we certainly encourage the board to support that decision, support our county office's decision.

05:15:14.509 --> 05:15:19.772
I know the advisory commission did not make a recommendation, although that recommendation was denial.

05:15:20.092 --> 05:15:22.254
And of course, staff from CDE has recommended denial.

05:15:22.314 --> 05:15:25.336
So we are here just to encourage the board to follow those recommendations.

05:15:25.556 --> 05:15:25.776
Thank you.

05:15:28.322 --> 05:15:28.922
Good afternoon.

05:15:30.083 --> 05:15:32.625
Thanks for sticking in through the long day.

05:15:33.626 --> 05:15:34.627
My name is Megan Macy.

05:15:34.807 --> 05:15:37.769
I am an attorney for Shasta Union High School District.

05:15:38.330 --> 05:15:47.016
There is plenty of documentation in the records submitted by our office, but you certainly have a robust staff report from CDE staff.

05:15:48.457 --> 05:16:01.881
So I'm not going to belabor the technical points for the reasons that the petition should be denied, but I want to make the point that the reason that the high school denied this petition is because it is a subpar charter petition.

05:16:02.861 --> 05:16:09.823
And even given the many opportunities that the CDE staff has given to provide additional information, which we

05:16:10.703 --> 05:16:16.107
don't think it's proper in the charter petitioning process, the recommendation is still for denial.

05:16:16.728 --> 05:16:18.809
And there's a couple of really big reasons why.

05:16:19.289 --> 05:16:25.974
The first is that this is a petitioner with a very negative history in operating charter schools.

05:16:26.755 --> 05:16:27.696
And as Ms.

05:16:27.716 --> 05:16:34.100
Dougherty herself mentioned, they've made a lot of tactical decisions over time in an effort to

05:16:35.622 --> 05:16:39.846
you know, to avoid consequences of their own decision-making.

05:16:40.447 --> 05:16:42.969
And that's a concern for Shasta High School District.

05:16:44.010 --> 05:16:54.942
The reason for filing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to the petitioners, was so they could avoid consequences of the teachers in their district

05:16:55.482 --> 05:16:59.484
and they had an onslaught of unfair labor practice charges.

05:16:59.884 --> 05:17:05.227
That's just not something that is proper under the EERA, and that's a concern for the high school district.

05:17:06.488 --> 05:17:09.609
Secondly, the conditions on the budget.

05:17:12.515 --> 05:17:16.857
Moving forward, it's based on anticipated enrollment of 331 students.

05:17:17.537 --> 05:17:26.762
Based on their own numbers of the demographics that were given, I think in this last round, they have a current enrollment of 294 students.

05:17:27.262 --> 05:17:28.703
So there's continued red flags.

05:17:29.223 --> 05:17:35.146
Not going to belabor the issues anymore, but we would just strongly encourage denial of the petition today.

05:17:35.506 --> 05:17:36.026
Thank you very much.

05:17:39.611 --> 05:17:46.832
Okay, that completes those initial 10-minute presentations and now we're ready for the public comment.

05:17:47.588 --> 05:17:50.029
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium?

05:17:50.689 --> 05:18:17.258
Ken Burt, Sheila Whitley, Pat Keener, Jeff Rice, Rommel Antone, Eric Premack, Christopher Rothrock, Mercedes Bradley, Sherry Cocking Keener, Cheryl Woodman, Amy Barker, Adam Ferber, Marty Stainbrook, Lisa Core, Michelle Lopez, Ona Heller, Claire Crawford, Jim Cloney, Megan Macy, Carney Rasmussen.

05:18:24.888 --> 05:18:27.530
Good afternoon, Sheila Whitley speaking for CTA.

05:18:28.611 --> 05:18:35.715
The California Teachers Association strongly opposes the overturning of the local and county decisions in this matter.

05:18:36.436 --> 05:18:41.739
In this case, CTA fully supports the department's recommendation to deny this appeal.

05:18:42.439 --> 05:18:51.685
We do this for concerns with physical concerns and also the EERA employee rights concerns.

05:18:52.225 --> 05:18:52.926
Thank you very much.

05:18:57.605 --> 05:18:58.546
Good afternoon, board.

05:18:59.006 --> 05:19:00.047
My name is Patrick Keener.

05:19:00.107 --> 05:19:04.310
I'm one of the board members for PCA and thank you very much for allowing us to be here today.

05:19:04.950 --> 05:19:06.892
Charter schools are a public school of choice.

05:19:07.732 --> 05:19:15.198
And as a board member, I believe that I take this job seriously in taking a look at the fiscal accountability for PCA.

05:19:15.878 --> 05:19:17.639
I believe they are physically sound.

05:19:18.000 --> 05:19:19.320
They're moving in the right direction.

05:19:19.981 --> 05:19:25.225
We have been very, very happy with the support that we've got from Dr. Robbins and the Whitmore School District.

05:19:25.882 --> 05:19:28.723
that we would probably continue to want to stay under that direction.

05:19:29.043 --> 05:19:48.448
Unfortunately, because of all the legal requirements, the legal hassles that PCA is undergoing by the Chester Union High School districts and others within the area, we feel threatened and coerced and intimidated that Whitmore will have to give up the sponsorship and certification.

05:19:49.308 --> 05:19:54.470
So I'm here today to ask you to please support our certification through the CDE.

05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:55.210
Thank you.

05:20:02.011 --> 05:20:02.631
Good afternoon.

05:20:02.752 --> 05:20:03.972
I'm Sherry Kockenkeener.

05:20:04.112 --> 05:20:07.335
I'm a teacher at Phoenix Charter Academy.

05:20:07.875 --> 05:20:09.456
I've taught for over 20 years.

05:20:09.536 --> 05:20:11.437
I've been a teacher there for two years.

05:20:11.998 --> 05:20:14.900
I have never worked with a more professional staff or administration.

05:20:16.000 --> 05:20:18.942
We do have an organized association.

05:20:19.483 --> 05:20:23.365
So as far as my rights as a teacher and what I'm doing, I'm covered there.

05:20:23.385 --> 05:20:26.928
I think in Reading, we're unique that

05:20:27.975 --> 05:20:34.445
that families get to choose the school that they attend, whether or not they live in that particular homeschool district.

05:20:35.046 --> 05:20:38.110
I don't see the difference of that being with a charter school.

05:20:38.711 --> 05:20:40.895
Yes, there might be other charter schools in our district,

05:20:42.077 --> 05:20:47.560
but they should have the opportunity to continue to go to our charter school, which is Phoenix Charter Academy.

05:20:48.260 --> 05:20:52.723
We have many families that couldn't be comfortable in other places.

05:20:52.823 --> 05:20:56.605
They weren't given the opportunity at other locations, and they have been with us.

05:20:57.285 --> 05:21:04.849
And to close us and not give us this charter would really affect over 300 families.

05:21:05.530 --> 05:21:05.830
Thank you.

05:21:12.082 --> 05:21:12.603
All righty, board.

05:21:12.883 --> 05:21:14.464
My name is Marty Stambrick.

05:21:14.584 --> 05:21:16.446
I'm a former APL board member.

05:21:17.166 --> 05:21:22.591
I'm well acquainted with the deceptions, half-truths, and overall lack of moral integrity of CTA and some of its members.

05:21:23.492 --> 05:21:27.375
I'm currently a very satisfied parent of a son who is a student at PCA.

05:21:27.836 --> 05:21:29.477
I'm here to advocate for PCA.

05:21:30.238 --> 05:21:35.983
My son's educators at PCA have exceeded my expectations with the openness and communications to further my son's education.

05:21:36.892 --> 05:21:40.374
I've found the staff to be very friendly and willing to help with any concerns I've had.

05:21:40.774 --> 05:21:50.800
I find it a bit frustrating that I have to advocate for the school of my choice because my local superintendents care more about their future retirement than my son's education.

05:21:51.940 --> 05:22:04.047
I hope this board finds in favor of supporting PCA as the state can protect us from the ongoing attacks and nonstop bullying of the CTA, Shasta County Office of Education, and the traditional district superintendents.

05:22:04.787 --> 05:22:08.310
so that I can continue to take my son to the public school of my choice.

05:22:09.371 --> 05:22:21.460
A parent should not worry whether their child's school will close on a year-to-year basis based on attacks over competitors' public funds.

05:22:21.901 --> 05:22:22.121
Thank you.

05:22:28.257 --> 05:22:28.797
Good afternoon.

05:22:28.937 --> 05:22:30.098
My name is Christopher Rothrock.

05:22:30.298 --> 05:22:35.119
I'm a teacher at Phoenix Charter Academy and I'm here to speak on behalf of my fellow peers.

05:22:35.719 --> 05:22:42.441
As you know, we've been under fire by multiple entities and through all this we're just trying to obtain solvency so we can serve our students.

05:22:42.461 --> 05:22:43.942
That's what we are here to do.

05:22:45.022 --> 05:22:47.003
And in order to ensure that the teachers

05:22:47.443 --> 05:22:54.309
remain covered and could put our focus where it needs to be, we have indeed formed an association with 100% involvement from all of our teachers.

05:22:54.989 --> 05:23:00.734
Innovation and focus on the individual student has made PCA the school of choice for over 300 students in our community.

05:23:01.435 --> 05:23:11.704
Our program is 100% focused on student success, but does not spare the rigor, as is evident by the fact that Phoenix Charter Academy just received its WASC accreditation for three years.

05:23:12.785 --> 05:23:20.797
You can imagine with such student-centered work, PCA staff is able to focus on what teachers truly love to do, that is to grow and enrich our students.

05:23:21.318 --> 05:23:23.241
We're very excited about the future of this program.

05:23:23.702 --> 05:23:27.147
So on behalf of the staff at PCA, I thank you for your time and consideration.

05:23:34.133 --> 05:23:36.473
I will be reading a letter from a parent.

05:23:37.834 --> 05:23:43.215
My special needs child spent 10 years in Shasta County's traditional public school system.

05:23:43.815 --> 05:23:50.196
He attended five different schools in classrooms encompassing general education to special day class.

05:23:50.656 --> 05:24:00.998
Last August, I became frustrated to find that his educational plan for the school year involved teaching him shapes, colors, and counting, much like preschool.

05:24:01.558 --> 05:24:02.558
My son is 13 years old.

05:24:03.638 --> 05:24:05.502
Would you identify yourself for us, please?

05:24:05.522 --> 05:24:09.730
Yes, I'm the special ed teacher at Mercedes Brady.

05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:10.190
Thank you.

05:24:10.411 --> 05:24:10.932
You're welcome.

05:24:14.525 --> 05:24:16.786
He was taught nothing in 10 years.

05:24:17.266 --> 05:24:21.407
In my frustration, I reached out to PCA and met with their SPED team.

05:24:21.827 --> 05:24:28.208
For the first time, I was asked to tell them about my child and about how they could help me educate my son.

05:24:29.689 --> 05:24:36.871
The team was truly interested in the academic success of my child, my autistic, nonverbal son.

05:24:36.891 --> 05:24:37.651
Time.

05:24:38.491 --> 05:24:48.459
is successfully completing language arts, science, social studies at grade level and is excelling in mathematics, working with algebra and geometry.

05:24:48.579 --> 05:24:52.201
This is after six months at PCA.

05:24:52.982 --> 05:24:54.163
Thank you very, very much.

05:25:00.472 --> 05:25:01.152
Good afternoon.

05:25:01.233 --> 05:25:07.937
My name is Cheryl Woodman, and I'm reading parts of a letter from the superintendent of Whitmore Union Elementary School District.

05:25:08.477 --> 05:25:10.098
You should have this letter in front of you.

05:25:10.959 --> 05:25:17.563
Dear California SBE, I'm writing in support of the petition for Phoenix Charter Academy for approval by you.

05:25:18.104 --> 05:25:22.827
Whitmore Union Elementary School is a small rural district in Shasta County.

05:25:23.547 --> 05:25:29.732
After the Anderson ruling, the learning centers outside of the district boundaries became a major issue.

05:25:30.612 --> 05:25:38.380
The districts listed and their attorney continue to claim that the charter schools do not qualify for the exemption stated in Ed Code section 47605A5.

05:25:38.400 --> 05:25:42.944
As to date, the district has incurred a total of $31,784 in legal bills fighting for all three charters.

05:25:51.112 --> 05:25:56.494
The State Board's approval will remove the specter of a prolonged legal battle over the exemption.

05:25:57.034 --> 05:26:05.196
Should the State Board approve Phoenix Charter Academy and decide to delegate oversight responsibilities, Whitmore would be more than happy to do so.

05:26:05.736 --> 05:26:07.937
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.

05:26:13.217 --> 05:26:14.298
Board, last one for today.

05:26:15.158 --> 05:26:17.559
Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association.

05:26:17.979 --> 05:26:19.680
Just really quickly wanted to make a couple of points.

05:26:20.020 --> 05:26:26.884
We support PCA based on their track record and what they've been doing so far for students under this authorization under Whitmore.

05:26:27.384 --> 05:26:35.328
This 5% reserve that we're talking about, the purpose of the reserve is for schools to offset any unforeseen costs that come up for them.

05:26:35.948 --> 05:26:47.932
What we're seeing currently is a playbook in how to exhaust those schools' resources in this reserve to make it so that they're fiscally insolvent, so they're unable to seek reauthorization anywhere else because they can't just make money up.

05:26:48.012 --> 05:27:05.338
So this is the second now of many that we'll see coming up under the Shasta decision, and I suggested the board look at the playbook that's going to come up where we exhaust schools' resources to fight cases like these and make it unattractive for districts to approve them.

05:27:05.658 --> 05:27:06.058
Thank you.

05:27:10.520 --> 05:27:11.100
Good afternoon.

05:27:11.160 --> 05:27:14.261
Jeff Rice with the A Plus Personalized Learning Network Association.

05:27:14.461 --> 05:27:26.345
I have worked with Dr. Doherty and her leadership team since 2009 and can personally attest to the fact that they have an unwavering commitment to put students first and to academic excellence and accountability.

05:27:27.245 --> 05:27:33.750
You've heard the challenging climate that this school and this leadership team is facing in Shasta County.

05:27:33.790 --> 05:27:37.393
Shasta County has become ground zero from the Shasta case.

05:27:37.433 --> 05:27:48.081
And I can tell you from personal experience that the contentious nature that exists in that county is becoming more extreme and is not lessening as a result of that appellate court decision.

05:27:48.602 --> 05:27:53.926
I find the argument about fiscal instability to be quite ironic.

05:27:54.446 --> 05:28:01.350
given the challenging climate and the fact that all of their previous funds were exhausted to defend their right to exist.

05:28:01.830 --> 05:28:11.916
It would be like saying that that the culture in London, England in the early 40s was unstable because it was being relentlessly bombed by German warplanes.

05:28:12.496 --> 05:28:19.621
This school is solid, serving its students and has been for years and needs your support and protection.

05:28:19.981 --> 05:28:20.261
Thank you.

05:28:24.349 --> 05:28:26.250
Hi, Claire Crawford with In the Public Interest.

05:28:27.211 --> 05:28:30.233
Hopefully this should be more simple than the last one.

05:28:32.134 --> 05:28:35.296
This should be a pretty easy decision and so I urge you to deny this petition.

05:28:35.656 --> 05:28:39.799
The CDE staff rightly recommends denial due to this school's unsuccessful history.

05:28:40.559 --> 05:28:43.621
As you've heard, this is really APL, Academy of Personalized Learning.

05:28:43.821 --> 05:28:47.003
APL filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, was issued a notice of

05:28:48.004 --> 05:28:53.212
violation and notice of intent to revoke by the authorizer based in part on academic performance.

05:28:53.553 --> 05:28:55.796
This is the same leadership administration and location.

05:28:56.197 --> 05:29:02.166
The CDE staff are also raising serious educational and fiscal concerns based on what was submitted for PCA.

05:29:03.368 --> 05:29:10.257
In the cases of SBE-authorized Synergy and Paramount, the local and county entities raised concerns that bore out in those schools' failures.

05:29:10.718 --> 05:29:13.522
Here you have an actual track record of failure, APLs.

05:29:14.303 --> 05:29:17.147
Again, same leadership, same administration, same school location.

05:29:17.667 --> 05:29:19.670
It has a track record of failure and should be denied.

05:29:23.686 --> 05:29:24.706
Hi, good afternoon.

05:29:24.726 --> 05:29:25.566
My name is Lisa Kaur.

05:29:25.586 --> 05:29:28.107
I'm with Young, Mini, and Kaur representing the petitioners.

05:29:28.727 --> 05:29:49.711
The Shasta Union High School District has threatened more than once to sue the Whitmore School District for approving this charter for its use of the exemption under 47605.1D, which allows a charter school to operate one facility outside district boundaries but within the county boundaries if there are no facilities within the district boundaries in which it is authorized.

05:29:50.171 --> 05:30:10.238
Today, the State Board can support the students that have chosen this charter school, the 320 current students that have chosen this charter school, and their access to the resources that they deserve by authorizing the charter and allowing the school the opportunity to prove its success in fiscal accountability without the diversion of public funds and resources to frivolous litigation.

05:30:10.818 --> 05:30:17.841
If you approve, you're approving an already demonstrably successful program which has fought tirelessly for its students against incredible opposition.

05:30:18.181 --> 05:30:27.666
You're approving critically important student access to resource center that offers special education services, mandatory testing, labs, and access to instructional materials.

05:30:28.246 --> 05:30:29.827
I'm available if there are any questions.

05:30:29.867 --> 05:30:30.187
Thank you.

05:30:34.958 --> 05:30:36.820
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

05:30:36.880 --> 05:30:40.182
This is a really interesting case and does have a complex history to it.

05:30:41.183 --> 05:30:49.249
If you take something from this, though, the most important message I think that you take from this is that this school is a survivor.

05:30:49.690 --> 05:31:00.018
It has withstood assault after assault after assault at the local level and came through operating successfully academically, financially, and operationally.

05:31:00.738 --> 05:31:06.222
The stated reasons for denial here are, again, similar to the ones you looked at this morning.

05:31:06.522 --> 05:31:14.088
The school, per CDE's own figures, shows a budget reserve of 5.5% in year two and 7.3% in year two and 7.3%

05:31:20.276 --> 05:31:21.557
percent in year three.

05:31:21.697 --> 05:31:27.660
So it again meets your financial standards that you're supposed to be operating under here.

05:31:28.501 --> 05:31:31.603
We've worked with Dr. Dougherty and her team for many years.

05:31:31.723 --> 05:31:36.746
She's been through our leadership training and, God help her, came through our CBO training twice.

05:31:38.127 --> 05:31:45.051
Very capable team, very strong team, demonstrably likely to succeed even under assault.

05:31:45.311 --> 05:31:45.611
Thank you.

05:31:50.313 --> 05:31:51.794
California Teachers Association.

05:31:52.394 --> 05:32:02.179
So, so far yesterday and today we saw that this board does not care if a petition is not compliant with the Charter Schools Act and it certainly doesn't care if approving a petition will have a negative impact on thousands of district students.

05:32:02.739 --> 05:32:11.023
Yesterday we also heard that you are perceived by the charter industry as being an easy authorizer, that charters actually prefer to be rejected by local democratically elected boards

05:32:11.443 --> 05:32:20.427
so they can be authorized by you because you will not provide sufficient oversight and accountability, and you will not require charters to follow laws that they don't feel like following, like Government Code 1090.

05:32:21.108 --> 05:32:24.529
If you approve this charter, you will be a caricature of a rubber stamp.

05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:35.795
You will be saying it doesn't matter if a petitioner previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, that it engaged in authorizer shopping, that it flagrantly violated labor law, that it spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal fees rather than students,

05:32:36.195 --> 05:32:49.702
that voluntarily closed a charter rather than be revoked, that it illegally discriminated against potential students, that it has zero EL students, and that CDE staff have said that their SPED and EL programs are insufficient and that it is unlikely to succeed.

05:32:50.262 --> 05:32:54.985
I urge you to have some respect for the law and for yourselves as authorizers and reject this petition.

05:33:00.231 --> 05:33:04.896
Hi, I'm Michelle Lopez representing Phoenix Charter Academy.

05:33:04.936 --> 05:33:06.538
I'm an attorney with the Law Offices of Young Money and Core.

05:33:06.919 --> 05:33:09.401
I want to applaud the CDE and their review process here.

05:33:09.421 --> 05:33:17.931
We found that their second review of information is just greatly appreciated and find it to be actually contrary to the last speaker.

05:33:18.791 --> 05:33:24.955
part of quality authorizing practices to look at the charter de novo like the Charter Schools Act was intended to be.

05:33:25.896 --> 05:33:44.387
That said, I just want to continue with Lisa's conversation about, you know, if this charter is denied, the students here lose the ongoing threats of litigation, the students lose to the ongoing threats of litigation by the Shasta County large school district seeking to monopolize what they deem their sovereign right to educate students.

05:33:45.187 --> 05:33:50.429
The districts will think they've won by shutting down every effort made by the charter school to come into compliance with the Anderson decision.

05:33:50.749 --> 05:33:58.071
However, these students are not returning to the districts until they offer the unique educational opportunities the students find at Phoenix and why they've chosen that school.

05:33:58.511 --> 05:34:02.432
If the charter is denied, there is no winner.

05:34:02.753 --> 05:34:06.834
No increase in funds to the school districts, no academic benefits, just loss to those students.

05:34:06.914 --> 05:34:07.274
Thank you.

05:34:08.874 --> 05:34:12.716
Okay, that concludes the public hearing, so I'm ready for board member discussion.

05:34:12.756 --> 05:34:13.636
Board member Strauss.

05:34:14.414 --> 05:34:16.955
So, I need, Lisa, I have some clarification.

05:34:18.575 --> 05:34:22.576
So, our CD, I'm sorry.

05:34:22.596 --> 05:34:24.397
I'm sorry.

05:34:24.417 --> 05:34:26.658
I apologize.

05:34:26.838 --> 05:34:27.838
Just some clarification.

05:34:28.278 --> 05:34:29.138
So, thank you so much.

05:34:29.219 --> 05:34:35.881
I mean, this seems really complicated, and I'm not sure we've quite heard one like this, but I'm just trying to see if I understand the facts.

05:34:35.941 --> 05:34:40.562
So, this is a charter that is currently authorized by Whitmore.

05:34:40.902 --> 05:34:47.344
that Whitmore is saying, state board, you should authorize, but we're glad to continue to oversight.

05:34:47.864 --> 05:34:49.165
And they're supporting it.

05:34:50.045 --> 05:34:55.587
And so they're operating with a new name, but they're still authorized under Whitmore.

05:34:56.087 --> 05:34:58.248
And so if we deny it today,

05:34:59.068 --> 05:35:03.550
these kids are still authorized under the Whitmore, is that correct?

05:35:03.751 --> 05:35:06.492
The school doesn't close, is that correct?

05:35:06.572 --> 05:35:08.373
They are still authorized under the Whitmore.

05:35:08.393 --> 05:35:14.937
I don't want to pine upon the validity of the charter approval, but our understanding is that they would continue.

05:35:14.957 --> 05:35:20.740
So they're actually, if I understand, and I'm sure there'll be more follow-up from my colleagues,

05:35:21.720 --> 05:35:34.244
They're authorized with a different name, and they filed bankruptcy, so now they're trying to change their name and be a new charter, but it's the same kids and the same staff that's asking for the authorization.

05:35:34.284 --> 05:35:35.265
They've done that already?

05:35:35.985 --> 05:35:36.205
Yes.

05:35:36.265 --> 05:35:38.986
They are authorized as Phoenix.

05:35:39.546 --> 05:35:44.148
They were previously Academy of Personalized Learning, so it is, from my understanding, the same group.

05:35:44.728 --> 05:35:54.974
But yes, they reformed, they pulled that new petition together, presented it before Shasta Union High School District, then to Whitmore.

05:35:55.094 --> 05:35:58.176
So they are authorized with that charter under Whitmore.

05:35:58.396 --> 05:35:59.737
You're operating with that petition.

05:35:59.757 --> 05:36:04.840
And under the Shasta decision, Whitmore's allowed one outside their area.

05:36:04.860 --> 05:36:05.360
Is that correct?

05:36:05.420 --> 05:36:06.421
Why they're still allowed

05:36:06.921 --> 05:36:09.403
If we deny it, they're still allowed to operate outside.

05:36:09.483 --> 05:36:10.804
But that's that's my end.

05:36:10.864 --> 05:36:15.147
I don't want to opine on any on the on the Anderson decision, but that's my understanding.

05:36:15.208 --> 05:36:16.849
But I would let Judy weigh in on that.

05:36:17.249 --> 05:36:20.432
And let her let the council talk.

05:36:20.732 --> 05:36:20.952
Right.

05:36:21.332 --> 05:36:36.284
As the attorney for the charter school testified, they believe they have an exemption under Ed Code, which currently exists that allows an allows a charter school to operate outside of its authorizer boundaries when there is no space available within the authorizer district.

05:36:36.824 --> 05:36:41.469
And the other thing, Lisa, and I'm not sure, I know you did a lot of follow-up and asked for extra documentation.

05:36:41.929 --> 05:36:49.296
This bankruptcy filing, could you clarify what you know about why they filed for bankruptcy and now are asking again?

05:36:49.316 --> 05:36:51.378
Do you know what that was about?

05:36:51.578 --> 05:36:53.460
Virginia, do you mind talking about the bankruptcy?

05:36:54.421 --> 05:36:57.203
Was it had to do with filing?

05:36:57.684 --> 05:36:58.124
I'm sorry.

05:36:58.144 --> 05:36:58.885
No, no, it's okay.

05:37:00.495 --> 05:37:09.103
Based on the record, there was an unfair labor practice charge from some teachers that were employed by Apple.

05:37:09.584 --> 05:37:13.608
The charter school says that they were laid off due to declining enrollment.

05:37:14.878 --> 05:37:16.499
The teachers disagreed.

05:37:16.539 --> 05:37:18.899
They filed an unfair labor practice charge.

05:37:18.939 --> 05:37:23.641
They had some rulings before the Public Employment Relations Board, some hearings going on.

05:37:24.181 --> 05:37:27.362
At the same time, they filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

05:37:28.483 --> 05:37:34.185
As you can see from one of the documents in your electronic red folder, I think there was the bankruptcy court's ruling.

05:37:35.005 --> 05:37:39.647
This was from the trustee who said, wait a minute, you seem to be gaming the system.

05:37:39.687 --> 05:37:41.547
I think that's what you heard from some of the testimony.

05:37:41.787 --> 05:37:43.788
That was in one of your documents.

05:37:47.113 --> 05:37:48.573
Okay that board member Rucker.

05:37:50.654 --> 05:38:03.917
Well part of what I was going to request was an explanation from Judy about the Shasta decision because we heard in a previous charter school hearing that it also applied to that charter issue and it did not.

05:38:04.237 --> 05:38:12.399
So Judy can you just make sure you clarify for us what you know what exactly how this exactly covers what's going on with this charter.

05:38:12.850 --> 05:38:17.832
Right, so this one is an issue of a resource center, so it is subject to the Shasta decision.

05:38:18.613 --> 05:38:22.094
They were previously authorized by Gateway when they were Apple.

05:38:22.574 --> 05:38:28.617
As you know, Gateway, they are located within Shasta, they were not located within Gateway.

05:38:29.097 --> 05:38:38.182
At that same time, they were undergoing some of the issues that we had heard regarding the bankruptcy and the labor, so Gateway started revocation proceedings.

05:38:38.642 --> 05:38:40.763
They decided to surrender that charter,

05:38:41.383 --> 05:38:42.344
rather than be revoked.

05:38:42.644 --> 05:38:49.469
And at the same time, based on my understanding, they submitted two petitions, one to Shasta and the same petition, like Lisa said, to Whitmore.

05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:52.571
The Whitmore one got picked up.

05:38:53.312 --> 05:38:59.456
So at the start of this school year, they're authorized by Whitmore and they closed Apple under Gateway.

05:39:00.672 --> 05:39:05.675
Okay and so then my other question then is so and then it's a two-part question.

05:39:05.715 --> 05:39:08.637
What happens if we approve and what happens if we disapprove?

05:39:09.678 --> 05:39:14.161
What happens if we do not approve this request?

05:39:14.281 --> 05:39:18.824
Does the school remain open and operated by whom?

05:39:19.204 --> 05:39:27.331
Yes, so like we talked about, I believe the school, their attorney testified that they have an exemption, that they are legally authorized under Whitmore.

05:39:28.052 --> 05:39:41.763
They might be subject to some legal challenges, whether or not that's true, but the school would not close immediately unless something, they were revoked or they turned in their charter or a court order, so they would still be open.

05:39:41.783 --> 05:39:47.228
So since they're already approved by one authorizer, what do they need this approval for?

05:39:48.311 --> 05:39:55.134
Well, they say in their letters that they just want to avoid further court costs and litigation.

05:39:56.415 --> 05:39:58.295
I don't see how this approval does that.

05:39:59.816 --> 05:40:07.059
Well, they would no longer be fighting because they would be located within Shasta and authorized by you.

05:40:07.399 --> 05:40:12.562
So then they would no longer have to satisfy that exemption because they wouldn't be outside of their boundaries.

05:40:13.062 --> 05:40:13.122
Oh.

05:40:16.065 --> 05:40:19.247
Okay, any other questions?

05:40:21.228 --> 05:40:22.909
Liaisons, would you speak please?

05:40:28.693 --> 05:40:36.498
So I don't have any questions because I was at the ACCS meeting and heard a lot more testimony there.

05:40:42.268 --> 05:40:43.829
I really hate this charter role.

05:40:44.810 --> 05:40:46.211
It is so difficult.

05:40:46.271 --> 05:40:50.314
It is just so difficult, and it just gets more difficult all the time.

05:40:51.075 --> 05:40:51.935
Was that too blunt?

05:40:53.657 --> 05:41:04.345
It's very difficult, and I'm now over seven years into it, so there could be a little battle fatigue going on.

05:41:06.548 --> 05:41:16.422
I know that the political environment and the legal environment for charter schools has gotten more intense, has grown more intense over the seven years.

05:41:17.103 --> 05:41:18.845
I'm absolutely aware of that.

05:41:22.290 --> 05:41:30.080
And I know that both sides feel righteous in what they want and feel like they have the right to do.

05:41:30.180 --> 05:41:36.367
And they're all, whether it's the district filing suit or the charter school,

05:41:38.630 --> 05:41:46.737
pushing back on something, I have no doubt that everyone involved cares most about serving students, and serving students well.

05:41:46.777 --> 05:41:48.178
That's why they became educators.

05:41:48.999 --> 05:41:51.781
And that's what is most important to them.

05:41:51.881 --> 05:41:59.627
Still, the way that the tension, the political tension, and then now increasingly some legal attention has increased is,

05:42:02.049 --> 05:42:19.981
making me uncomfortable in the same kind of way that you mentioned, Feliza, member Feliza, in the same kind of way that you mentioned when you felt like some of the ethnic groups were battling over some of these things.

05:42:20.041 --> 05:42:21.342
It's just uncomfortable.

05:42:21.962 --> 05:42:23.924
It's not what I would like to see.

05:42:25.084 --> 05:42:28.687
That said, I am prepared to make a motion

05:42:29.747 --> 05:42:51.678
and in preface to it, at the ACCS, although a motion did not, recommendation did not come forward because there wasn't five to vote, five in favor of a single motion, there were a majority of the ACCS, four, that voted to deny this charter school.

05:42:52.678 --> 05:42:56.580
and I am uncomfortable with the history of the charter school.

05:42:57.300 --> 05:43:16.268
I'm uncomfortable with the fiscal concerns, with the union concerns, with the bankruptcy concerns, with the reauthorization concerns, with the what were referred to as strategic decisions by the operator that

05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:23.514
evidently didn't turn out to be that strategic because each one seems to need a fix for something else.

05:43:24.214 --> 05:43:41.168
So I'm prepared to recommend that to move the CDE recommendation to deny the request to establish Phoenix Charter Academy under the authorization of the State Board for marginal fiscal viability and unsuccessful history.

05:43:43.456 --> 05:43:44.657
I will second.

05:43:44.937 --> 05:43:46.319
Seconded, moved and seconded.

05:43:47.139 --> 05:43:49.462
Is there any further board discussion of this?

05:43:51.924 --> 05:43:54.667
Hearing none, all those in favor of the motion, raise your hand.

05:43:55.507 --> 05:43:57.389
Okay, it is denied unanimously.

05:43:58.610 --> 05:44:03.175
Okay, we now on to item 24, general public comment.

05:44:03.195 --> 05:44:03.835
Do you have any?

05:44:04.516 --> 05:44:06.478
There's no one signed up for general public comment.

05:44:06.498 --> 05:44:08.420
Okay, I declare the board adjourned.
