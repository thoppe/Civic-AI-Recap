05:57.040 --> 05:58.560
Welcome to the board.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.240
It's wonderful to have you all on board.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.440
And I'd like to ask each of the new board members

06:03.440 --> 06:06.320
if they'd like to share a few introductory comments

06:06.320 --> 06:08.040
beginning with Sharon Elkin.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.360
You fooled me, backwards order there.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.200
I know, we do this, we go back and forth.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.240
They don't make it funny to feel like, you know,

06:15.240 --> 06:18.440
they're at the end of the alphabet and always last, so.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.400
Thank you.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.240
Well, I just first want to say,

06:21.240 --> 06:25.240
I'm so honored and excited to be joining this group.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.040
And saying that oath of office really brought it home.

06:30.040 --> 06:35.040
What a important and public duty this is.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.360
I mean, I'm honored.

06:37.360 --> 06:42.360
And I have been working on behalf of the students

06:42.880 --> 06:46.240
at Gateway for the last 20 plus years.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.760
And I've always felt like my job

06:47.760 --> 06:50.000
was both to do right by our kids

06:50.000 --> 06:54.760
and by the kids across all public schools more broadly.

06:54.760 --> 06:58.120
And I'm really thankful to have this opportunity

06:58.120 --> 07:01.000
to step up in this way and to join you

07:01.000 --> 07:02.560
and learn from you all.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.880
So thank you for this honor and I'm happy to be here.

07:05.880 --> 07:06.960
I just want to say one more thing.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.800
I'm super excited to roll up my sleeves and get to work.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.800
And unfortunately, I am going to miss the rest of today

07:15.920 --> 07:18.600
because of a family funeral I need to attend.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.840
So I will really roll up my sleeves tomorrow, bye.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.120
Our hearts go with you this afternoon

07:25.120 --> 07:27.960
and we're thrilled to welcome you this morning.

07:28.800 --> 07:29.640
Thank you.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.480
Brenda.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.200
Okay, I knew with that L, there was no fooling me.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.120
I'm in the middle, either way we go.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.280
But first of all, good morning again to each of you.

07:43.280 --> 07:47.200
And like Sharon, I am truly excited and honored

07:47.200 --> 07:49.520
to be a member of this board.

07:49.520 --> 07:53.040
And I am truly looking forward to working with each of you

07:53.040 --> 07:57.560
and other stakeholders as we just continue to make sure

07:57.560 --> 08:02.560
that we ensure a good academic environment in our schools

08:02.640 --> 08:06.680
for our students and an environment that has supported

08:06.680 --> 08:08.040
measures for our students,

08:08.040 --> 08:11.640
as well as great working environments for our teachers

08:11.640 --> 08:14.320
and for our other staff members.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.400
And again, like Sharon, I am truly just honored

08:18.400 --> 08:22.360
to be able to serve at this capacity and at this level.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.480
And I look forward to working with each of you.

08:25.480 --> 08:28.120
I've spent the last 33 years in education

08:28.120 --> 08:29.360
within one district,

08:29.360 --> 08:33.520
and it was an honor to serve over 40,000 students.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.720
And now it's an honor to serve the millions of students

08:36.720 --> 08:39.640
and teachers and staff in California.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.320
So again, I'm just grateful for the opportunity.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.600
Thank you.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.200
6.2 million children.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.040
Millions.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.880
Yeah, that's a millions.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.360
Thank you.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.960
Well, thank you again for this honor

08:55.440 --> 08:57.400
to be part of this board and this team.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.200
I look forward to collaborating.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.520
It's been a dream of mine since I was a little girl

09:01.520 --> 09:06.280
to become a teacher from being an instructional assistant,

09:06.280 --> 09:09.320
working with bilingual children to becoming a teacher

09:09.320 --> 09:13.760
and just looking at actually different educational systems

09:13.760 --> 09:14.680
all over the world.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.640
I've been an avid traveler

09:16.640 --> 09:19.040
and it's always been a passion of mine

09:19.040 --> 09:23.080
and to work not only in this great state of California,

09:23.080 --> 09:27.760
but also to work in an urban school and school district.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.040
It really is a pleasure to be part of this team,

09:31.040 --> 09:33.840
to collaborate and be able to share my ideas,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.120
not only my personal experiences

09:36.120 --> 09:37.560
as an English language learner,

09:37.560 --> 09:40.920
but as a teacher that has worked

09:40.920 --> 09:42.960
for over 20 years in urban settings.

09:42.960 --> 09:47.960
So I'm excited to also dive in to learn and to collaborate

09:49.480 --> 09:51.280
and just to share my ideas

09:51.360 --> 09:56.040
and hopefully contribute as much as I can to the board

09:56.040 --> 09:58.600
and to our students, six million.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.880
And that alone is exciting and it drives me every day.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.760
So thank you so much.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.200
Great to have you here.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.720
What a wonderful start to the day.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.760
And so now we're gonna go into closed session.

10:10.760 --> 10:13.840

10:16.520 --> 10:19.200

10:19.200 --> 10:21.600
So we'll see you in closed session.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.960
which will be taken up later this afternoon.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.960
The proposed waiver consent items are W1 through eight,

12:14.960 --> 12:17.280
which will be taken up tomorrow morning.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.960
Changes in the agenda include taking up item four,

12:20.960 --> 12:24.680
the accountability item after the state superintendent

12:24.680 --> 12:28.080
and the state board president's reports under item one.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.400
The state board pulled item seven from the agenda

12:30.400 --> 12:32.400
on Monday, March 7th.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.160
Tomorrow we will reopen item one

12:34.160 --> 12:37.040
to take action on the January 2022 minutes

12:37.040 --> 12:40.240
and to take up the state board liaison reports.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.120
Members of the public who are wishing

12:43.120 --> 12:44.440
to call in for public comment

12:44.440 --> 12:46.760
should view the live stream of the meeting

12:46.760 --> 12:48.360
to know at what time public comment

12:48.360 --> 12:50.120
will occur for each item.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.920
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number

12:52.920 --> 12:55.120
and entering a participant access code

12:56.000 --> 12:57.680
on a slide that we will display

12:57.680 --> 13:01.200
and then following each of the operator's prompts.

13:01.200 --> 13:04.840
Upon dialing in, the callers will be added to the caller queue.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.440
The operator will notify callers

13:06.440 --> 13:09.200
when it is their turn to provide public comment.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.480
We will also ask callers to please turn down

13:11.480 --> 13:13.840
the speaker volume of their computers.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.240
If they're following the live webcast

13:16.240 --> 13:18.440
to avoid an echoing effect.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.920
Public comment will be limited to one minute per speaker.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.400
Item 13 is the general public comment item

13:24.400 --> 13:26.240
during which members of the public

13:26.240 --> 13:27.680
may provide comment on matters

13:27.680 --> 13:31.800
that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.840
Board members, please mute your microphones

13:33.840 --> 13:36.720
when not speaking and keep your cameras on at all times

13:36.720 --> 13:38.520
except during the scheduled breaks

13:38.520 --> 13:41.840
or if you need to take a momentary break

13:41.880 --> 13:43.720
to ensure that we maintain a quorum

13:43.720 --> 13:45.880
throughout today's virtual meeting.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.200
For each item on the agenda,

13:47.200 --> 13:49.600
there will be an opportunity for you to raise your hand

13:49.600 --> 13:51.640
using the Zoom participant window

13:51.640 --> 13:55.040
if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.400
And item one where we will start

13:57.400 --> 14:00.240
is our State Board projects and priorities item

14:00.240 --> 14:02.960
and I'll now turn it over to State Superintendent

14:02.960 --> 14:05.520
Tony Thurman for his remarks.

14:05.520 --> 14:10.520
And I'm looking for the State Superintendent on my screen.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.720
President Darling-Hammond,

14:17.720 --> 14:20.440
we're just pulling up the cameras here for the podium.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.280
Okay, great.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.080
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond,

14:32.080 --> 14:34.600
members of the board, good morning

14:34.640 --> 14:35.840
to the new members of the board.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.880
We'd like to welcome you to the board

14:37.880 --> 14:40.480
and we look forward to our work with you.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.160
We'd like to share just a few notes

14:44.160 --> 14:46.840
about items taking place in schools

14:46.840 --> 14:48.000
and about work happening

14:48.000 --> 14:50.640
at the California Department of Education.

14:50.640 --> 14:53.000
I'll note that on last week,

14:53.000 --> 14:56.320
we helped many of our schools celebrate

14:56.320 --> 14:58.400
Read Across America Day

14:58.400 --> 15:01.600
and I'll note that in this year's proposed budget,

15:01.600 --> 15:04.360
the governor has made programs

15:04.360 --> 15:06.680
to support literacy a priority.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.480
In particular, supporting reading coaches and specialists,

15:12.760 --> 15:15.320
an item that we think is very important

15:15.320 --> 15:17.760
to support the needs of our students.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.200
I wanna thank you, President Darling-Hammond

15:20.200 --> 15:22.040
for your support of that item

15:22.040 --> 15:24.160
and for your work with our reading

15:24.160 --> 15:25.880
by third grade task force

15:25.880 --> 15:30.640
which also had similar recommendations.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.920
It was great to be out at Jordan Academy

15:33.920 --> 15:36.600
and have an opportunity to read with students

15:36.600 --> 15:38.000
for Read Across America Day.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.680
This is the location that I've been able to visit

15:40.680 --> 15:44.160
over the last four years and all across our state.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.720
Our students and our educators

15:45.720 --> 15:48.680
have been engaged in literacy.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.240
We intend to continue supporting it.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.320
Many of you know that the Department of Education

15:53.320 --> 15:55.280
this year is sponsoring a bill

15:55.280 --> 15:58.480
that would expand funding for literacy programs

15:58.520 --> 16:02.040
in the form of home visiting outreach

16:02.040 --> 16:03.680
to support our families.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.560
Additionally, the Department of Education

16:06.560 --> 16:10.720
is supporting legislation that would allocate new funding

16:10.720 --> 16:13.320
to support literacy intervention programs

16:13.320 --> 16:15.280
like the Freedom Schools Program

16:15.280 --> 16:18.720
which is a evidence-based program,

16:18.720 --> 16:21.840
an Afrocentric literacy intervention program.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.880
We're making and continuing to make literacy

16:24.920 --> 16:29.080
among our top priorities to support California students.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.240
I also wanna speak on a program that's related

16:31.240 --> 16:32.200
and equally important

16:32.200 --> 16:34.440
and that is the Community Schools Initiative.

16:34.440 --> 16:37.960
As many of you remember and recall,

16:37.960 --> 16:41.280
the budget has a $3 billion allocation

16:41.280 --> 16:45.240
to implement a Community Schools Initiative.

16:45.240 --> 16:50.240
I wanna thank the board for its involvement here

16:50.240 --> 16:53.320
and our board liaisons,

16:53.320 --> 16:55.880
President Darling-Hammond and Dr. Escobedo

16:55.880 --> 16:59.840
who've been our board liaisons on community schools.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.160
And thank you for all of your great work.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.880
The request for application has gone out

17:05.840 --> 17:08.640
on March 1st for planning grants.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.360
These are grants that help school districts

17:10.360 --> 17:13.880
that have never had a Community Schools Initiative

17:13.880 --> 17:15.560
launch one, do the planning work

17:15.560 --> 17:18.000
to determine how to build it.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.080
We're anticipating that this week

17:20.080 --> 17:22.720
a round of grant applications will go out

17:22.720 --> 17:24.720
for school districts that will be applying

17:24.720 --> 17:26.280
for implementation grants

17:26.280 --> 17:29.400
to implement a Community Schools Initiative.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.480
These are for school districts

17:30.480 --> 17:34.080
that actually have experience working with community schools

17:34.080 --> 17:35.960
and so that they have an opportunity

17:35.960 --> 17:38.840
to further launch their work.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.880
And shortly after, we anticipate next week

17:41.880 --> 17:43.040
that there'll be another round

17:43.040 --> 17:45.280
of grant applications going out

17:45.280 --> 17:46.760
for those organizations that want

17:46.800 --> 17:49.400
to become lead technical assistance agencies

17:49.400 --> 17:52.640
to provide guidance to our school districts

17:52.640 --> 17:54.920
as it relates to community schools.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.800
So we're happy to answer questions

17:56.800 --> 17:58.920
from members of the board at any time

17:58.920 --> 18:00.120
about community schools.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.680
We just wanted to give you the update

18:01.680 --> 18:03.000
that the work is moving.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.680
The legislature and the state board

18:04.680 --> 18:06.400
have made it a priority

18:06.400 --> 18:08.160
that these community schools resources

18:08.160 --> 18:11.200
get to schools as quickly as can be possible.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.840
And so we wanted to keep you aware

18:14.000 --> 18:17.200
where things are with these programs.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.840
The report from our schools,

18:18.840 --> 18:20.640
they're doing incredible work

18:20.640 --> 18:24.360
and we continue to commend all educators,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.080
teachers and classified staff,

18:26.080 --> 18:28.320
administrators, students and parents

18:28.320 --> 18:31.280
for their resilience during these challenging times.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.280
Our schools are open and our children are learning

18:33.280 --> 18:35.200
and we're grateful for the efforts

18:35.200 --> 18:37.080
of those who are supporting them.

18:37.080 --> 18:40.000
In spite of challenges that we experience in our system,

18:40.000 --> 18:41.720
like staffing shortages,

18:41.720 --> 18:43.360
our schools are finding ways

18:43.360 --> 18:45.640
to make the most with the resources that we have.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.240
And so we commend them for their work.

18:48.240 --> 18:51.360
Many of you know that we have launched a working group

18:51.360 --> 18:54.360
that is focused on addressing staff shortages.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.440
We've had a number of meetings to look at the data

18:57.440 --> 19:00.200
to examine where educators are going

19:00.200 --> 19:01.760
and why they're leaving.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.680
They will not surprise you,

19:04.680 --> 19:06.000
especially given the research

19:06.000 --> 19:08.480
that our president has done over the years,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.800
that compensation and working conditions

19:10.800 --> 19:12.840
are certainly among top issues

19:12.840 --> 19:16.720
for why educators leave the field at every level.

19:16.720 --> 19:21.680
Of course, these departures have been exaggerated

19:21.680 --> 19:23.400
and exacerbated by the pandemic.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.520
We've just seen that in education,

19:25.520 --> 19:28.760
like in every sector, many folks are leaving.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.760
But we believe that there is an opportunity

19:30.760 --> 19:34.080
to attract new folks to the profession

19:34.080 --> 19:36.400
and to help retain those who are in the profession

19:36.400 --> 19:38.200
and that we need a call to action

19:38.200 --> 19:40.720
to remind educator candidates

19:40.720 --> 19:42.720
that this is an incredible opportunity

19:42.720 --> 19:44.000
to help young people.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.440
This state has more than $350 million

19:46.440 --> 19:49.560
in residency programs that districts can use.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.240
The state has provided five billion-some dollars

19:52.240 --> 19:54.160
for educator effectiveness grants

19:54.160 --> 19:57.760
being administered through the Department of Education

19:57.760 --> 20:00.880
and our Triple ED division and incredible work there.

20:00.880 --> 20:05.520
This state also makes some $500 million available

20:05.520 --> 20:07.760
in scholarships for new applicants

20:07.760 --> 20:08.920
who wish to become teachers.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.480
The resources are here.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.280
We just have to find ways to link together

20:12.280 --> 20:15.520
those resources in coordination and recruitment.

20:15.520 --> 20:18.000
There are many items in the governor's proposed budget

20:18.000 --> 20:20.440
that would enhance the work of the Commission

20:20.440 --> 20:23.600
on Teacher Credentialing to support some of that recruitment

20:23.600 --> 20:25.680
and we continue to work with organizations

20:25.680 --> 20:30.160
that are interested in how to recruit and retain

20:30.160 --> 20:32.920
a great workforce and a diverse workforce,

20:32.920 --> 20:35.880
which is something that we continue to prioritize.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.480
I would acknowledge that on last week,

20:38.480 --> 20:42.000
the Department of Public Health made a formal announcement

20:42.000 --> 20:44.040
about wearing masks in schools

20:44.040 --> 20:46.720
and that as of the end of this week,

20:48.800 --> 20:53.800
by March 11th, the mandate for wearing masks in schools

20:54.920 --> 20:56.480
will have been lifted.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.200
Of course, masks can still be worn in schools.

20:59.200 --> 21:03.480
It continues to be recommended, but after this Friday,

21:03.480 --> 21:05.960
our schools have been presented with information

21:05.960 --> 21:09.760
that the mandate to wear a mask has been lifted.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.640
Recognizing that there's been tremendous success

21:12.640 --> 21:14.280
that has allowed us to get to this place.

21:14.280 --> 21:17.880
Californians are highly vaccinated.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.200
The fact that California has used masks

21:21.200 --> 21:24.720
and other health protocols has allowed us

21:24.720 --> 21:28.240
to keep our schools open more than most other states.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.040
I would still urge caution because we recognize

21:31.040 --> 21:32.600
that there are many communities

21:32.600 --> 21:35.040
where vaccine rates are still low

21:35.040 --> 21:38.440
and many communities where incidents

21:38.440 --> 21:41.560
of coronavirus infection are still high,

21:41.560 --> 21:44.560
not the least of which are the African American community

21:44.560 --> 21:46.240
and in some cases, Latino community

21:46.240 --> 21:48.960
and Asian American Pacific Islander communities.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.320
And we should still be cautious.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.480
And so for clarity for schools,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.560
the mask mandate has been lifted,

21:55.560 --> 21:58.480
but masks are still recommended

21:58.480 --> 22:02.920
as well as other health and safety protocols

22:02.920 --> 22:05.160
that can be provided for our schools.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.560
Lots of great things happening

22:06.560 --> 22:08.840
to support our schools going forward.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.040
We know that our students will recover

22:12.040 --> 22:14.240
in terms of learning gaps that they've experienced

22:14.240 --> 22:15.960
during the pandemic.

22:15.960 --> 22:19.280
Universal TK programs and implementation efforts

22:19.280 --> 22:20.120
are underway.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.040
We wanna acknowledge the great work

22:22.040 --> 22:25.160
of our early learning and care division

22:25.160 --> 22:26.840
who are at the head of this.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.000
Universal meals, this week I had the opportunity

22:29.000 --> 22:31.800
to celebrate what was the kickoff

22:31.800 --> 22:35.760
of national school breakfast week

22:35.760 --> 22:38.600
and many campaigns being supported,

22:38.600 --> 22:42.400
including by our first partner in the state

22:42.400 --> 22:44.600
to support organic meals, organic breakfast

22:44.600 --> 22:45.880
and organic cereal.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.960
Again, wanna harken that this budget

22:47.960 --> 22:49.600
that we are currently implementing

22:49.600 --> 22:53.560
provides revenue to have universal meals

22:53.560 --> 22:55.720
for all students, two meals,

22:55.720 --> 22:58.160
regardless of a student's background,

22:58.160 --> 22:59.920
that we are implementing programs

22:59.920 --> 23:02.880
to help school districts upgrade their school facilities.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.640
And I would note some $47 million

23:06.480 --> 23:11.480
for schools for fresh fruit and other organic foods.

23:11.480 --> 23:14.200
And so lots of things in the works

23:14.200 --> 23:16.360
to support our schools.

23:16.360 --> 23:20.280
There is a Children's Behavioral Health Initiative,

23:20.280 --> 23:23.520
more than $4.3 billion to support mental health.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.840
We're working closely with the Departments

23:25.840 --> 23:28.600
of Public Health and Health Care Services

23:28.600 --> 23:31.400
on how this moves forward.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.440
We've introduced at the Department of Legislation,

23:33.440 --> 23:34.720
sponsored legislation rather,

23:35.240 --> 23:37.920
would help to fill out the pathways

23:37.920 --> 23:40.440
of those who'd become mental health professionals.

23:41.400 --> 23:45.160
SB 1229 would provide scholarships

23:45.160 --> 23:48.120
to those who would become masters level clinicians

23:48.120 --> 23:51.120
and commit to working in communities of high need.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.480
By most accounts, California, even before the pandemic

23:54.480 --> 23:58.120
was only able to provide about a third of the need

23:58.120 --> 24:00.960
for those who needed a mental health professional.

24:00.960 --> 24:03.400
We know that's been exacerbated by the pandemic,

24:03.440 --> 24:05.920
by the 25 counties that have experienced fire.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.320
So we've introduced SB 1229,

24:08.320 --> 24:10.440
a bill that would fund scholarships

24:10.440 --> 24:13.240
for those who would enter graduate programs

24:13.240 --> 24:16.120
to become clinicians and work in schools.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.920
And we anticipate that this revenue could help

24:18.920 --> 24:22.200
to secure 10,000 new mental health clinicians

24:22.200 --> 24:25.560
for our schools over the course of the next several years.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.800
The Department of Education is currently working

24:27.800 --> 24:31.320
to administer grants that can also support

24:31.360 --> 24:32.960
student mental health needs,

24:32.960 --> 24:35.680
including a grant to help school districts

24:35.680 --> 24:37.920
counter social isolation,

24:37.920 --> 24:41.360
as well as an effort where the Department of Education

24:41.360 --> 24:44.160
will provide technical assistance to school districts

24:44.160 --> 24:47.280
to help them learn how to utilize Medi-Cal dollars

24:47.280 --> 24:49.760
to draw down federal dollars

24:49.760 --> 24:54.320
to support the delivery of mental health programs.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.240
And finally, I would mention

24:55.240 --> 24:57.280
that the California Department of Education

24:57.280 --> 25:00.480
will be putting out a request for proposals

25:00.480 --> 25:05.240
that focuses on efforts to address bias in our schools.

25:05.240 --> 25:07.640
This is a $10 million initiative

25:07.640 --> 25:09.280
funded in last year's budget,

25:09.280 --> 25:11.120
being implemented by the department

25:11.120 --> 25:15.320
to address the issues related to bias

25:15.320 --> 25:17.360
and racism in our schools.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.880
There's no shortage of things happening

25:18.880 --> 25:22.040
that I believe will help to transform California schools.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.360
We like to lift these up, our community schools,

25:24.360 --> 25:29.120
our statewide mental health initiative, our anti-bias work,

25:29.120 --> 25:32.800
our work around universal TK and universal meals,

25:32.800 --> 25:34.920
and of course, expanded learning

25:34.920 --> 25:37.360
to provide the types of resources

25:37.360 --> 25:41.560
to help our students heal from the trauma of the pandemic,

25:41.560 --> 25:43.600
recover as it relates to their learning,

25:43.600 --> 25:48.040
and to thrive as we move to help them prepare for the future.

25:48.040 --> 25:52.560
And so I'm happy to share these updates, Madam President.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.600
And Madam President,

25:53.600 --> 25:55.720
if you would allow me just one more opportunity,

25:55.720 --> 25:58.160
I'd like to take a moment of personal privilege

25:58.160 --> 26:02.400
to acknowledge a long-time CDE employee

26:02.400 --> 26:06.120
who has now joined the ranks officially

26:06.120 --> 26:08.200
of the State Board of Education.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.200
With your permission, Madam President.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.520
Please go right ahead.

26:14.520 --> 26:19.960
Thank you. I'd like to acknowledge Lisa Constancio,

26:19.960 --> 26:23.320
a 25-year employee of the state of California

26:23.320 --> 26:24.720
who doesn't know that this is happening.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.160
But nonetheless, we want to acknowledge Lisa,

26:27.160 --> 26:29.280
who is in the State Boardroom.

26:29.280 --> 26:31.720
I think she's trying to exit the State Boardroom.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.880
And so I have to acknowledge her this way

26:33.880 --> 26:35.560
so that we do not lose her.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.680
Lisa has served at the Department of Education

26:37.680 --> 26:39.800
for 15 years until recently,

26:39.800 --> 26:43.040
and she's joined the team at the State Board of Education.

26:43.040 --> 26:46.080
We're grateful for 25 years of state service

26:46.080 --> 26:48.080
and 15 years at CDE,

26:48.080 --> 26:51.080
and that as she has departed and begun her new duties

26:51.080 --> 26:52.680
in January of this year,

26:52.680 --> 26:54.720
that she's literally just gone down the hallway

26:54.720 --> 26:56.080
and still in the building,

26:56.120 --> 26:57.880
maybe still in the same parking lot,

26:57.880 --> 26:59.400
and that we still have the opportunity

26:59.400 --> 27:00.680
to work closely with her.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.960
For those of you who don't know Lisa Constancio,

27:02.960 --> 27:04.440
if I can just share a little bit about the work

27:04.440 --> 27:07.400
that she's done at the California Department of Education.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.200
She has served in many capacities

27:09.200 --> 27:12.240
since joining the department in 2006.

27:12.240 --> 27:16.280
In 2017, she became the division director

27:16.280 --> 27:18.280
for our charter school's division.

27:18.280 --> 27:21.960
And I had the good fortune to work closely with her in 2019

27:21.960 --> 27:24.000
when the governor appointed the task force

27:24.000 --> 27:25.600
on charter school reform,

27:25.600 --> 27:28.720
which made the first reform of charter school law in decades.

27:28.720 --> 27:31.640
And that task force came up with balanced recommendations

27:31.640 --> 27:33.240
to address many needs,

27:33.240 --> 27:36.920
and Lisa played an integral part in that work.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.400
Lisa went on to become appointed to serve

27:39.400 --> 27:43.480
as deputy superintendent at the Department of Education,

27:43.480 --> 27:45.920
working with a number of our divisions

27:45.920 --> 27:48.280
that address a number of fiscal issues.

27:48.280 --> 27:51.120
And in addition to that, during the pandemic,

27:51.120 --> 27:54.600
Lisa became our point person for many of the efforts

27:54.600 --> 27:58.440
focused on dealing with response to emergencies

27:58.440 --> 27:59.840
and natural disasters.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.880
She became a regular member of the meetings

28:01.880 --> 28:04.080
with the Office of Emergency Services,

28:04.080 --> 28:07.160
and that work continued as the pandemic began,

28:07.160 --> 28:09.600
she became our point person who sat at many tables

28:09.600 --> 28:11.920
to make sure that resources reached our schools

28:11.920 --> 28:16.920
to counter the impacts of COVID-19.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.840
She's an incredible leader, deeply committed,

28:19.840 --> 28:23.000
incredible parent of a California students,

28:23.000 --> 28:25.760
and we are grateful to have had her service here.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.600
And we wanted to take this moment

28:27.600 --> 28:29.280
to acknowledge you, Lisa Constancio,

28:29.280 --> 28:30.920
formally for your service

28:30.920 --> 28:33.240
at the California Department of Education,

28:33.240 --> 28:36.160
and congratulate you as you begin to continue your service

28:36.160 --> 28:38.200
at the State Board of Education.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.440
Please join me in congratulating and welcoming

28:40.440 --> 28:42.320
and thanking Lisa Constancio.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.320
Thank you.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.360
Thank you.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.760
We do have some certificates here for you, Lisa.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.880
She's declined my invitation for remarks,

28:55.880 --> 28:58.720
but we would be remiss if we didn't have the opportunity

28:58.720 --> 28:59.800
to acknowledge her.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.280
Madam President and members of the board,

29:01.280 --> 29:03.880
thank you for the latitude to be able to acknowledge

29:03.880 --> 29:05.440
Lisa Constancio here today.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.720
This concludes my report.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.000
Thank you so much.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
And we're thrilled to recognize Lisa as well

29:13.080 --> 29:14.160
as all in the family,

29:14.160 --> 29:16.640
and we appreciate the fact that she will be continuing

29:16.640 --> 29:19.920
to serve the state from the other side of the building.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.320
So thank you so much.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.440
I am going to reinforce a couple of the remarks

29:28.440 --> 29:30.480
that our state superintendent has made.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.760
And as he depicted, we're really engaged right now

29:35.760 --> 29:37.080
in a process of developing

29:37.080 --> 29:39.280
a whole child approach to education,

29:39.280 --> 29:41.040
which includes the ways in which we think

29:41.040 --> 29:43.880
about all of the supports that children need to be ready

29:43.880 --> 29:48.880
to learn effectively, a whole school approach to that,

29:48.880 --> 29:50.880
and a whole community approach.

29:50.880 --> 29:54.120
So it is a very important moment in the way

29:54.120 --> 29:58.640
in which California is thinking about education policy.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.040
I do want to note also that next week

30:01.040 --> 30:04.160
will mark the two-year anniversary

30:04.160 --> 30:07.000
since the start of the pandemic in California

30:07.120 --> 30:11.320
when we all went home and started trying to figure out

30:11.320 --> 30:13.160
how to do distance learning.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.360
I want to thank all of the educators and families

30:15.360 --> 30:18.080
who have persevered through the most trying conditions

30:18.080 --> 30:20.320
our schools have ever faced to keep students safe

30:20.320 --> 30:23.200
and learning over these last 24 months.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.920
I want to note that compared to other big states

30:25.920 --> 30:28.320
like Florida, New York, and Texas,

30:28.320 --> 30:32.200
California has had the lowest pediatric hospitalizations,

30:32.200 --> 30:33.400
the lowest death rates,

30:33.400 --> 30:36.400
the fewest school closures due to outbreaks,

30:36.400 --> 30:40.000
and that is due to the hard work of our school communities

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
to provide our students with safe learning environments

30:43.000 --> 30:46.480
and all of the mitigation strategies that the state,

30:46.480 --> 30:49.320
the counties, the districts, the schools together

30:49.320 --> 30:54.320
have put in place to allow for that kind of safety.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.800
Looking ahead, the hospitalization rates

30:56.800 --> 30:59.080
are projected to decline even further,

30:59.080 --> 31:01.880
but as State Superintendent Thurman noted,

31:01.880 --> 31:04.840
there are communities where that is not the case,

31:04.840 --> 31:07.960
where there are actually some increases in case rates

31:07.960 --> 31:11.040
and there are places where we still have to be very,

31:11.040 --> 31:12.080
very vigilant.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.880
So with new surges or variants still possible,

31:15.880 --> 31:17.840
even though the trend is downward,

31:17.840 --> 31:19.400
we have moved into this new phase,

31:19.400 --> 31:21.880
which is anchored in continued vigilance

31:21.880 --> 31:24.480
and reduced disparities in case rates.

31:25.400 --> 31:27.600
Masking schools as the State Superintendent said

31:27.600 --> 31:31.560
will be moved from a required state mandate

31:31.560 --> 31:36.200
to a strongly recommended for local communities.

31:36.200 --> 31:38.880
It is strongly recommended because it is one of the best ways

31:38.880 --> 31:41.600
to protect the health and wellbeing of all of us,

31:41.600 --> 31:45.320
including, of course, the most vulnerable among us,

31:45.320 --> 31:47.520
children who are not eligible for a vaccine,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.440
disabled people, the elderly people

31:49.440 --> 31:52.720
with compromised immune systems,

31:52.720 --> 31:55.240
multiple chronic conditions, and in communities

31:55.240 --> 32:00.240
where case rates have not yet really begun to decline

32:00.880 --> 32:03.000
or hospitalization rates.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.600
So as local decisions are made

32:04.600 --> 32:07.160
regarding whether to maintain or establish

32:07.160 --> 32:09.280
universal masking requirements,

32:09.280 --> 32:11.080
and families are making decisions

32:11.080 --> 32:13.120
based on their own situations,

32:13.120 --> 32:14.960
it will be important for our educators

32:14.960 --> 32:17.920
to reinforce the students and with parents

32:17.920 --> 32:21.400
and with all of the members of the school community

32:21.400 --> 32:24.680
the importance of respecting each other's decisions.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.960
And teachers can model respect

32:26.960 --> 32:29.160
and schools can make sure that the climate

32:29.160 --> 32:32.520
and the culture of the campus is one that puts tolerance,

32:32.520 --> 32:37.040
support, and consideration at the center of our policies.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.400
And of course, the best way to prevent serious illness

32:39.400 --> 32:41.680
from COVID is through vaccination.

32:41.680 --> 32:45.560
We have extraordinary evidence of that

32:45.560 --> 32:49.880
in the differentials that occur for hospitalization

32:49.880 --> 32:53.320
or death rates with respect to the differences

32:53.320 --> 32:56.360
in vaccination rates.

32:56.360 --> 32:58.720
And vaccines have saved lives

32:59.280 --> 33:00.560
and reduced those hospitalizations.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.440
The state continues to offer

33:02.440 --> 33:05.240
mobile vaccine clinics to schools

33:05.240 --> 33:07.280
interested in improving vaccine rates.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.680
We really do need to be paying attention to this right now

33:10.680 --> 33:13.080
and any school that wants to do so

33:13.080 --> 33:18.080
can sign up at toolkit.covid19.ca.gov,

33:18.240 --> 33:19.880
mobile vaccinations.

33:19.880 --> 33:22.520
So we wanna continue to encourage

33:23.480 --> 33:28.480
an attitude and a support system for safety in our schools.

33:29.160 --> 33:31.840
With the end of the school and summer break fast approaching

33:31.840 --> 33:34.400
our schools are gearing up to extend programming

33:34.400 --> 33:36.760
to students into the summer.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.120
And as the governor noted

33:38.120 --> 33:40.520
in his state of the state address yesterday,

33:40.520 --> 33:43.840
expanding access to high quality teaching and learning

33:43.840 --> 33:46.080
is key to moving past COVID

33:46.080 --> 33:49.000
and into a future where all students thrive.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.640
Fortunately, California has been a leader in the US

33:51.640 --> 33:55.280
for access to before, after and summer school programming.

33:55.280 --> 33:59.400
In fact, the Afterschool Alliance ranks California second

33:59.400 --> 34:01.520
after only Washington DC

34:01.520 --> 34:04.120
for access and quality of afterschool programming.

34:04.120 --> 34:05.520
And we have been expanding,

34:05.520 --> 34:08.640
we'll continue to expand the resources and funding

34:08.640 --> 34:11.640
for that programming and for summer school program.

34:11.640 --> 34:15.240
So with $1.8 billion in state investments

34:15.240 --> 34:17.680
in the expanded learning opportunities program

34:17.680 --> 34:21.400
and a total of $5 billion over the next couple of years,

34:21.440 --> 34:23.320
we will soon claim that top spot.

34:23.320 --> 34:26.480
And I hope we will use that time and that opportunity

34:26.480 --> 34:31.480
to really provide both the kinds of academic supports,

34:32.080 --> 34:34.640
everything from high intensity tutoring

34:34.640 --> 34:39.240
and other kinds of academic opportunities

34:39.240 --> 34:43.600
for dealing with the learning recovery process that we're in

34:43.600 --> 34:47.480
and also enrichment in music and the arts and recreation

34:47.480 --> 34:50.520
and all the other things that make a summer of joy

34:50.560 --> 34:53.600
possible for our students and a summer of learning.

34:54.680 --> 34:59.080
Universal TK is also this year beginning its stage

34:59.080 --> 35:02.880
of bringing the next one fourth of the students

35:02.880 --> 35:05.920
into the process of being eligible for TK.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.280
And I will say the Department of Education

35:10.280 --> 35:14.280
is doing yeoman's work to figure out

35:14.280 --> 35:16.600
how to give the technical assistance to districts

35:16.600 --> 35:18.680
to do this opening up and working

35:18.680 --> 35:20.480
with the teacher credentialing commission

35:20.480 --> 35:23.400
to create pathways for staff,

35:23.400 --> 35:27.240
both from early childhood and multiple subjects pathways

35:27.240 --> 35:29.640
and new entrance to the field.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.480
As State Superintendent Thurmond said,

35:31.480 --> 35:34.680
we have a variety of supports,

35:34.680 --> 35:38.280
which are open to TK, prospective TK teachers,

35:38.280 --> 35:40.400
as well as K-12 teachers

35:40.400 --> 35:42.280
in terms of golden state scholarships,

35:42.280 --> 35:45.760
which are available to help students offset

35:45.760 --> 35:48.680
their college costs by $25,000,

35:48.680 --> 35:51.680
the residency programs that are starting up,

35:51.680 --> 35:54.000
including for TK teachers,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
the classified staff pathways

35:56.000 --> 35:59.840
that enable paraprofessionals to get a pathway,

35:59.840 --> 36:02.960
a paid pathway into a teaching career.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.000
So we're enthusiastic about and laying the table

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
for a real growth in our teaching workforce

36:12.200 --> 36:16.600
that allows people to come into teaching in California

36:16.600 --> 36:20.040
without debt, with a high quality preparation

36:20.040 --> 36:25.040
and with a long-term possibility of committing to the field

36:25.160 --> 36:27.480
because it becomes affordable in those ways.

36:28.720 --> 36:33.720
I also wanna just note that as we look at the opportunities

36:34.760 --> 36:37.920
for both TK and for expanded learning

36:37.920 --> 36:40.040
and before and after school time,

36:40.120 --> 36:43.160
we are launching, as the State Superintendent noted,

36:43.160 --> 36:44.360
our community school strategy,

36:44.360 --> 36:45.960
which will allow many schools

36:45.960 --> 36:48.640
to tie all of these efforts together

36:48.640 --> 36:53.640
and to make it possible in a very orchestrated way

36:54.520 --> 36:58.000
to serve the needs of students in their communities.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
We will have the possibility over the next couple of weeks

37:03.040 --> 37:08.040
for up to a couple of thousand schools in the state

37:08.360 --> 37:11.720
to get planning grants, implementation grants,

37:11.720 --> 37:14.560
and we will have a technical assistance center

37:14.560 --> 37:19.400
that is responding, is able to be conceptualized

37:19.400 --> 37:21.680
in response to the RFA that's going on.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.440
So we really wanna appreciate the engagement

37:24.440 --> 37:27.560
of the many critical interest holders in this process.

37:27.560 --> 37:30.360
We look forward to continued engagement,

37:30.360 --> 37:32.320
including by our new board members.

37:32.320 --> 37:34.600
We have a lot of work to do

37:34.600 --> 37:38.560
because once we have these resources in place,

37:38.560 --> 37:42.920
implementation is the most important element,

37:42.920 --> 37:46.880
as they used to say in the work I did in policy analysis,

37:46.880 --> 37:49.040
that implementation is the great slip

37:49.040 --> 37:50.600
between the cup and the lip

37:50.600 --> 37:53.440
if you don't pay attention to it.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.200
And we are going to be paying a lot of attention

37:56.200 --> 37:59.600
to being sure that the pathway to doing this work

37:59.680 --> 38:01.760
effectively in our local schools

38:01.760 --> 38:06.440
is made smoother by the work that we do.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.680
And with that, we will dive into our work,

38:09.680 --> 38:13.120
which will get us going on a number of these topics.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.200
We're gonna start with item four,

38:16.200 --> 38:18.240
which is the update on the implementation

38:18.240 --> 38:20.720
of the integrated local, state, and federal accountability

38:20.720 --> 38:23.280
and continuous improvement system.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.680
And the CDE is recommending that we take action

38:26.680 --> 38:29.760
related to the accountability work plan

38:29.760 --> 38:32.000
as deemed necessary and appropriate,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.480
and that we delegate authority to CDE

38:34.480 --> 38:35.600
subject to the approval

38:35.600 --> 38:37.600
of the State Board Executive Director

38:37.600 --> 38:40.920
to pursue as expeditiously as possible a waiver

38:40.920 --> 38:42.760
to allow California to maintain

38:42.760 --> 38:46.240
its DOS modified methods business rules

38:46.240 --> 38:48.480
for calculating academic achievement

38:48.480 --> 38:53.480
and graduation indicators for our alternative schools,

38:53.680 --> 38:56.040
and that we approve the submission

38:56.040 --> 39:00.880
of the 2021-22 addendum for the consolidated state plan

39:00.880 --> 39:02.440
due to COVID-19.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.280
This item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis

39:05.280 --> 39:08.040
and Joseph Saenz of the CDE.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.560
And Cindy and Joe, please begin.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.760
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond, Cindy Kazanis

39:14.760 --> 39:16.040
of the Analysis, Measurement,

39:16.040 --> 39:17.680
and Accountability Reporting Division.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.480
I wanted to welcome the new members today

39:20.480 --> 39:23.320
and also acknowledge that we have some new liaisons

39:23.320 --> 39:25.600
that are helping us with accountability these days,

39:25.600 --> 39:27.560
President Lyndon Darlene Hammond

39:27.560 --> 39:30.680
and Vice President Glover Woods.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.880
We're very excited to bring to you our annual item,

39:33.880 --> 39:35.920
our update on the implementation

39:35.920 --> 39:38.200
of the accountability system.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.000
Some of the work that I do

39:40.000 --> 39:42.960
is to obviously lead the accountability system work,

39:42.960 --> 39:45.280
but also in regards to data reporting.

39:45.280 --> 39:47.480
So data that comes out of the department

39:47.480 --> 39:49.360
typically comes from my office.

39:49.360 --> 39:52.720
I have been in this role since 2015

39:52.720 --> 39:55.920
and have been at the department for 19 years.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.520
So it's really excited to see

39:57.520 --> 39:59.680
some fresh faces here this morning.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.840
So we're gonna cover a couple of topics

40:03.840 --> 40:05.120
to bring you up to speed

40:05.120 --> 40:07.400
on what we've been working on for the past year,

40:07.400 --> 40:11.920
and then also take you into the year of work for 2022,

40:11.920 --> 40:14.600
as well as a couple of years beyond.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.560
I'm gonna be joined by my colleague Joe Saenz

40:16.560 --> 40:19.280
to discuss our proposed waiver

40:19.280 --> 40:22.440
for our Dashboard Alternative School Status Program,

40:22.480 --> 40:25.080
as well as our addendum

40:25.080 --> 40:27.400
that is being offered by the US Department of Education

40:27.400 --> 40:29.800
that we'd like to take advantage of.

40:31.640 --> 40:34.160
So the recommendation, you can see on the screen,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.640
I'll read it once and then we'll have it at the end

40:36.640 --> 40:38.200
just so you're aware of the action.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.280
I know that President Darlene Hammond

40:40.280 --> 40:41.720
gave you a brief overview.

40:41.720 --> 40:42.800
The department is recommending

40:42.800 --> 40:44.320
that the State Board take action related

40:44.320 --> 40:47.240
to the 2022 Accountability Work Plan

40:47.240 --> 40:48.920
as deemed necessary and appropriate,

40:48.920 --> 40:50.520
and that the State Board of Education

40:50.520 --> 40:52.760
delegate to the Executive Director

40:52.760 --> 40:55.600
to pursue as expeditiously as possible

40:55.600 --> 40:57.640
a waiver to allow California

40:57.640 --> 41:00.080
to maintain the Dashboard Alternative School Status

41:00.080 --> 41:02.920
modified methods, business rules for calculating

41:02.920 --> 41:05.680
the academic achievement and graduation rate indicators,

41:05.680 --> 41:08.400
and that the SBE approved California submission

41:08.400 --> 41:11.520
of the 2021-2022 Addendum Template

41:11.520 --> 41:14.400
for the Consolidated State Plan due to COVID-19.

41:14.920 --> 41:18.880
So the past year, just like in schools,

41:18.880 --> 41:21.520
we are seeing a lot of noise in the data

41:21.520 --> 41:23.680
and we'd like to take you through just a couple of things

41:23.680 --> 41:26.600
that we've been working on up to the release

41:26.600 --> 41:29.840
of our major data sets in January of 2022.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.320
So specifically what affected our work

41:34.320 --> 41:37.600
was that we, of course, have still been

41:37.600 --> 41:40.240
part of the pandemic and we've had a lot of disruptions

41:40.240 --> 41:43.240
in schools, and we've had a lot of disruptions

41:43.400 --> 41:44.240
in schools.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.440
This past year, the State Board of Education

41:49.440 --> 41:54.320
applied for a waiver to suspend accountability requirements

41:54.320 --> 41:57.000
for the 2020-2021 school year,

41:57.000 --> 41:59.560
and what this impact meant to the Dashboard

41:59.560 --> 42:03.040
is we did not publish state-level indicators

42:03.040 --> 42:05.520
for each of the metrics.

42:05.520 --> 42:08.400
You will see local indicators, though, on the Dashboard.

42:09.400 --> 42:13.080
Following the action by the U.S. Department of Education

42:13.080 --> 42:14.720
and the approval of that waiver,

42:14.720 --> 42:18.440
we also had relief from state requirements

42:18.440 --> 42:23.440
around accountability as identified under AB 130,

42:24.400 --> 42:27.080
which was passed in July of 2021,

42:27.080 --> 42:29.080
and that mirrored the actions

42:29.080 --> 42:30.560
by the U.S. Department of Education

42:30.560 --> 42:32.960
in that we suspended, the state suspended

42:32.960 --> 42:35.040
the reporting of state indicators

42:35.040 --> 42:37.520
and reporting available data

42:38.280 --> 42:39.760
that would have been included on the Dashboard

42:39.760 --> 42:41.480
were asked to be put on our website,

42:41.480 --> 42:44.200
only if they were determined to be valid and reliable.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.440
And then, as I mentioned, we were able to report out

42:46.440 --> 42:47.800
on local indicator data.

42:48.840 --> 42:53.320
So what that meant in absence of having values placed on it,

42:53.320 --> 42:55.200
performance levels placed on our data,

42:55.200 --> 42:57.760
is that we simply reported out on raw data

42:57.760 --> 43:02.760
around graduation rates, our chronic absenteeism,

43:02.920 --> 43:04.600
as well as many other metrics.

43:05.600 --> 43:09.880
So we did release a version of the Dashboard for 2021

43:09.880 --> 43:12.200
on January 7th, 2022.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.720
You will see district enrollment information,

43:14.720 --> 43:18.440
demographic information, as well as the local indicators.

43:18.440 --> 43:19.760
First, the local indicators

43:19.760 --> 43:21.560
were only for informational purposes,

43:21.560 --> 43:24.280
so you don't see a performance standard attached to it.

43:24.280 --> 43:27.080
In prior years, you would have seen met or not met,

43:27.080 --> 43:28.680
or not met for two or more years.

43:30.320 --> 43:34.280
We also provided the public transparency

43:34.960 --> 43:38.200
into the data around our graduation rates

43:38.200 --> 43:40.280
and our college career indicator.

43:40.280 --> 43:43.480
So the department has been supplementing

43:43.480 --> 43:46.960
what is posted to the California School Dashboard

43:46.960 --> 43:49.320
through a sister website that we host

43:49.320 --> 43:51.560
called the School Dashboard Additional Reports

43:51.560 --> 43:53.120
and Data webpage.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.880
And on that report webpage, you can get information

43:55.880 --> 43:59.280
about a school's four and five-year graduation rates

43:59.280 --> 44:03.800
as we calculate it to align with the accountability standards,

44:03.800 --> 44:06.520
as well as our graduation rate for alternative schools,

44:06.520 --> 44:08.320
which is a one-year graduation rate.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.760
Additionally, you see metrics

44:10.760 --> 44:12.800
around our college career indicator.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.680
So while we're not able to report out on students

44:15.680 --> 44:18.360
who took the grade 11 assessments,

44:18.360 --> 44:21.840
we are able to report out on students who, for example,

44:21.840 --> 44:23.280
completed A through G,

44:23.280 --> 44:28.280
and had completed their career technical education pathways,

44:28.680 --> 44:33.280
or took an advanced placement exam

44:33.400 --> 44:35.440
and passed it with a certain level.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.600
And so that additional transparency is available, again,

44:38.600 --> 44:41.520
through the dashboard and on the department's webpage

44:41.520 --> 44:44.080
when you go to our accountability homepage.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.800
So DataQuest, as many of you probably know,

44:49.800 --> 44:52.560
I've already heard some data reported this morning,

44:52.560 --> 44:54.080
our 6.2 million kids.

44:54.080 --> 44:56.360
That's something that my division calculates

44:56.360 --> 44:58.040
and posts on an annual basis.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.400
DataQuest is really the heart of our data reporting

45:02.800 --> 45:05.080
for the department around educational data.

45:05.080 --> 45:09.440
And so DataQuest continues to report out on, thank you,

45:10.520 --> 45:14.440
on graduation and dropout rates, discipline, absenteeism.

45:14.440 --> 45:18.000
We have a new report called Stability and Stability Rate,

45:18.000 --> 45:19.920
as well as our cumulative enrollment.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.240
That information, again,

45:21.240 --> 45:24.000
was published along with the dashboard in January.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.280
And you can see comparisons between schools, districts,

45:27.280 --> 45:29.400
county, and the state.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.240
Additionally, there are comparisons

45:31.240 --> 45:34.000
for certain reports on grade spans,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.280
on whether or not they're alternative school or not,

45:36.280 --> 45:37.320
whether or not you wanna look at it

45:37.320 --> 45:38.880
by a particular student group,

45:38.880 --> 45:42.200
so English learners, students with disabilities.

45:42.200 --> 45:45.120
There's a lot of accessibility

45:45.120 --> 45:46.720
that is attached to these reports.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.640
And so in absence of having state indicators

45:49.640 --> 45:51.760
on the dashboard, DataQuest has been something

45:51.760 --> 45:52.920
that we've been able to maintain

45:52.920 --> 45:57.880
throughout the COVID-19 and the pandemic phase.

45:58.880 --> 46:02.600
All right, so we're gonna move on to attachment one.

46:02.600 --> 46:04.640
I should have warned you, this is a long item.

46:04.640 --> 46:09.360
And so we will take a break for clarifying questions

46:09.360 --> 46:11.440
after each of the attachments.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.440
And I'll turn it over to President Darling-Hammond

46:14.440 --> 46:18.120
when we take that break to allow for those questions.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.800
So attachment one is our work plan for the year,

46:20.800 --> 46:22.840
and I will get started.

46:22.840 --> 46:26.960
So we are required not only by state but federal law

46:26.960 --> 46:28.720
to restart accountability.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.720
And what does that mean in terms of knowing

46:31.720 --> 46:35.040
that we still have disruptions this school year

46:35.040 --> 46:36.080
in our schools?

46:36.080 --> 46:41.080
Students have been sick due to COVID and had to stay home,

46:41.400 --> 46:44.280
and there's been a lot of concern and consternation

46:44.280 --> 46:47.560
in the field around not only chronic absenteeism rates,

46:47.560 --> 46:50.400
potentially, and their effect on a school

46:50.400 --> 46:52.720
or district determination,

46:52.720 --> 46:56.200
but as well as our upcoming state assessments.

46:56.200 --> 46:59.840
So while we are hearing all of this consternation

46:59.840 --> 47:02.080
from the field, we do have an obligation

47:02.080 --> 47:04.680
because we do take federal and state money.

47:04.680 --> 47:09.040
We have to hold our districts and our schools accountable

47:09.040 --> 47:13.000
through the means that we've put forward on the dashboard

47:13.000 --> 47:14.880
and through our SSA state plan.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.280
So in terms of restarting accountability,

47:17.280 --> 47:20.600
we need to, under the US Department of Education's

47:20.600 --> 47:24.040
requirement, we need to make sure that we are identifying

47:24.040 --> 47:27.000
for the first time in two years schools

47:27.000 --> 47:29.200
for comprehensive support and improvement

47:29.200 --> 47:32.480
and additional targeted support and improvement

47:32.480 --> 47:35.840
using this current school year's data.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.920
Additionally, under state law,

47:38.920 --> 47:41.240
I already mentioned Assembly Bill 130.

47:41.240 --> 47:46.240
We are really, you know, we have guidance from,

47:47.200 --> 47:49.920
or rather, required under this provision

47:49.920 --> 47:52.960
to only use performance data for this current year.

47:52.960 --> 47:55.520
So we will not be looking back at old data

47:55.520 --> 47:58.560
or even last year's data to do comparisons

47:58.560 --> 48:01.000
and to create what we call a performance color.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.760
So the department is restricted from using that prior data,

48:04.760 --> 48:07.800
and so we only are able to display what we call status

48:07.800 --> 48:11.360
or current year data on the California school dashboard.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.640
We are recommending, and you'll hear this later on

48:14.640 --> 48:18.320
through the addendum, that the college career indicator

48:18.320 --> 48:21.480
not be reported because of last year's

48:21.480 --> 48:23.520
2021 statewide assessments

48:23.520 --> 48:28.520
and the lack of statewide participation in the CASP test.

48:31.720 --> 48:34.520
Since that is one of the major pieces

48:34.520 --> 48:36.280
about how students demonstrate

48:36.280 --> 48:39.120
that they're college or career ready,

48:39.120 --> 48:41.920
it's really important that we have a full set of data

48:41.920 --> 48:43.720
in order to calculate that indicator.

48:45.360 --> 48:47.760
So just, again, just to reiterate,

48:47.800 --> 48:51.760
the 2020 tools dashboard will not be able to report change

48:52.720 --> 48:54.520
or the difference from prior year,

48:54.520 --> 48:56.320
and we will not be performing,

48:56.320 --> 48:58.240
reporting out on performance colors

48:58.240 --> 49:01.040
due to these restrictions from assembly bill 130.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.680
So what does this mean?

49:04.680 --> 49:08.360
We are exploring options on a display.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.680
The display you see on this screen

49:09.680 --> 49:11.840
is for the English learner progress indicator

49:11.840 --> 49:14.120
from the 2019 dashboard.

49:14.120 --> 49:17.000
And when the department published this information,

49:17.040 --> 49:20.360
it was to respond to a condition

49:20.360 --> 49:22.280
from the U.S. Department of Education.

49:22.280 --> 49:24.800
But it was also to provide transparency to the field.

49:24.800 --> 49:27.280
In absence of a third year of data,

49:27.280 --> 49:31.120
we were trying to just at least establish a baseline

49:31.120 --> 49:33.560
as to where schools were on this measure.

49:33.560 --> 49:38.080
So we have a foundation about how we've done this before,

49:38.080 --> 49:39.920
but we know that it will be more than

49:39.920 --> 49:41.400
just the English learner progress indicator

49:41.400 --> 49:44.600
that will be showing status only through the entire dashboard.

49:44.600 --> 49:48.040
So in thinking about how we would display

49:48.040 --> 49:50.600
this moving forward, we're asking our contractor,

49:50.600 --> 49:52.040
San Joaquin County Office of Education,

49:52.040 --> 49:54.720
for some mock-ups on making sure that

49:56.040 --> 49:58.480
this is meaningful to schools and to districts

49:58.480 --> 50:01.640
and that they can make decisions

50:01.640 --> 50:04.960
and also talk to the public about what this means

50:04.960 --> 50:07.800
in terms of how their schools and districts are doing.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.960
So what are the other indicators that will be reported

50:10.960 --> 50:13.960
on the dashboard using status and what data are we using

50:13.960 --> 50:15.600
for each of these indicators?

50:15.600 --> 50:17.720
So to begin with, the academic indicator

50:17.720 --> 50:21.200
will be using the 2022 Smarter Balanced Assessments

50:21.200 --> 50:23.240
and California Alternative Assessments

50:23.240 --> 50:26.600
for English Language Arts, Literacy, and Mathematics.

50:26.600 --> 50:29.760
Our Chronic Absenteeism and our Suspension Rate Indicators

50:29.760 --> 50:32.520
use our, excuse me, our 2021

50:32.520 --> 50:34.960
and 2022 Smart Balance Assessments.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.080
Our English Learner Progress Indicators

50:37.080 --> 50:41.640
use our, excuse me, our 2021, 2022 Enrollment Data.

50:41.640 --> 50:45.920
Our English Learner Progress Indicator will use 2020, 2021,

50:45.920 --> 50:49.920
and 21, 22 English Language Proficiency Assessments

50:49.920 --> 50:52.440
for California or LPAC results.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.760
This is a very different indicator

50:54.760 --> 50:57.680
because we do need two years of data to produce status.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.240
And then finally, our Graduation Rate Indicator

51:00.240 --> 51:02.120
will look at the class of 2020.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.800
So we'll look at our graduating class

51:03.800 --> 51:05.560
to determine this indicator.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.800
We'll also look at students in the class of 2021

51:08.800 --> 51:11.960
who took an additional year to graduate

51:11.960 --> 51:16.960
with a full complement of their coursework.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.720
So our fifth year graduates.

51:18.720 --> 51:19.720
And then we'll look at our

51:19.720 --> 51:21.520
Dashboard Alternative School students

51:21.520 --> 51:24.280
who graduated, of course, in 2022.

51:27.240 --> 51:29.680
There has been a lot of conversation in the field.

51:29.680 --> 51:32.720
I think it started maybe week two of school

51:32.720 --> 51:34.960
about the department taking up

51:34.960 --> 51:37.520
whether or not we want to reset cut scores.

51:37.520 --> 51:41.640
And what this means is whether or not the status levels

51:41.640 --> 51:43.040
that were established by the board

51:43.040 --> 51:45.600
over the course of several meetings,

51:45.600 --> 51:49.840
if not half a dozen meetings for each of these indicators,

51:49.840 --> 51:52.360
whether or not the board would take up resetting those

51:52.360 --> 51:57.360
in light of all of the consternation in the field,

51:57.920 --> 51:58.840
the noise in the field,

51:58.840 --> 52:02.080
the fact that we know that we have greater levels

52:02.080 --> 52:05.720
of students being absent due to the pandemic.

52:05.720 --> 52:09.680
And so we spent the last two months asking this question.

52:09.680 --> 52:11.600
We talked to the technical design group

52:11.600 --> 52:14.980
who advises the CDE on technical matters

52:14.980 --> 52:16.880
around the accountability system.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.200
We spoke with the California Patricia's advisory group

52:19.200 --> 52:21.120
who advises you, the state board,

52:21.120 --> 52:23.000
on matters around Title I.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.600
We also talked to the advisory commission

52:24.600 --> 52:26.680
on special education.

52:26.680 --> 52:29.960
I've talked to several of the committees

52:29.960 --> 52:33.680
from the county schools superintendents association.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.680
And there's not clear guidance in the field

52:39.840 --> 52:42.880
or a clear desire in the field on how to proceed.

52:42.880 --> 52:45.040
But with all of these things in mind,

52:45.040 --> 52:47.200
we know that in our SSA state plan,

52:47.200 --> 52:49.200
that we've said that we would revisit cut scores

52:49.200 --> 52:51.700
after a period of seven years.

52:51.700 --> 52:54.400
And while we're hitting up against seven years,

52:54.440 --> 52:57.320
we know that we also have two years

52:57.320 --> 52:59.120
in which we don't have data.

52:59.120 --> 53:02.500
And so one thing that we would suggest is,

53:04.000 --> 53:06.920
let me actually just go over the feedback that we received.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.800
So the technical design group

53:08.800 --> 53:11.480
was not in favor of the adjustments.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.440
They expressed concerns that doing so

53:13.440 --> 53:16.140
may cause the system to lose credibility.

53:16.140 --> 53:17.520
We heard that again

53:17.520 --> 53:20.520
from the California Patricia's advisory group.

53:20.520 --> 53:22.200
And I think this is important to note

53:22.200 --> 53:23.380
that they expressed concerns

53:23.380 --> 53:26.900
that lowering standards may not provide an accurate picture

53:26.900 --> 53:28.500
of what's occurring at schools.

53:29.660 --> 53:32.420
They also had members who expressed

53:32.420 --> 53:34.180
that if cut scores were not reset,

53:34.180 --> 53:37.180
LEAs in schools may not view the dashboard

53:37.180 --> 53:40.260
as a system that reports relevant data.

53:40.260 --> 53:44.220
So again, either ends of the spectrum on this,

53:44.220 --> 53:46.500
we are recommending at this point

53:46.500 --> 53:48.180
that we keep the cut scores as is.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.640
And we continue to monitor it as we collect the data.

53:51.640 --> 53:55.160
And when we look next year to adding in change

53:55.160 --> 53:58.500
or two years of data that we revisit this conversation.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.000
We also saw in some of the letters that you received

54:04.000 --> 54:05.760
from different organizations

54:05.760 --> 54:09.000
and a desire to really focus on how we communicate out

54:09.000 --> 54:11.840
about what this restart around accountability means.

54:11.840 --> 54:14.440
And so we are taking that recommendation

54:14.440 --> 54:16.480
and we will develop a toolkit

54:16.480 --> 54:19.400
for communicating about the 2022 dashboard

54:19.400 --> 54:21.520
when it's released in December.

54:22.400 --> 54:24.300
Right now we have several one page flyers

54:24.300 --> 54:29.300
and the works that are relevant to the status levels,

54:29.400 --> 54:32.160
participation rate, among other things.

54:32.160 --> 54:34.900
And in years past, we've done some webinar slides

54:34.900 --> 54:38.520
that others can use that provide a format for them

54:38.520 --> 54:42.120
to share with members of the public and their community.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.800
And then we have also offered up key talking points.

54:45.800 --> 54:48.200
So we'll work with our educational partners

54:48.200 --> 54:53.200
to put these together as we head up a release

54:53.320 --> 54:54.940
in December of 2022.

54:58.040 --> 55:01.400
So I think with that, we will shift from current year

55:01.400 --> 55:04.320
and we'll shift to things that we're continuing to work on

55:04.320 --> 55:09.320
that is a multi-year process around future dashboards.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.820
So specifically, we're super excited

55:12.820 --> 55:15.800
that we had a little bit of time this last year

55:15.800 --> 55:17.680
to work on developing something

55:17.680 --> 55:19.720
that had been on to do list for several years.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.740
And that was a student level data file

55:21.740 --> 55:23.520
for our college career indicator.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.120
And why this is important is because this kind of data

55:26.120 --> 55:28.920
is not available in a one-stop shop

55:28.920 --> 55:33.920
in our student data system, CalPADs or other places.

55:34.100 --> 55:37.880
And so we developed internally a mechanism

55:37.880 --> 55:40.240
to create an online portal.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.700
We're calling it SOARS,

55:41.700 --> 55:45.560
the Student Online Accountability Record Status.

55:45.560 --> 55:47.460
And what this system allows to do

55:48.260 --> 55:50.620
is to share student level data back with authorized personnel

55:50.620 --> 55:53.980
from local educational agencies and charter schools.

55:53.980 --> 55:56.340
And why this is important and why there's, I think,

55:56.340 --> 55:59.100
been such a thirst from the field to understand this

55:59.100 --> 56:02.420
is the college career indicator brings

56:02.420 --> 56:04.980
just hundreds of thousands, if not millions,

56:04.980 --> 56:08.420
of data points together on each individual student,

56:08.420 --> 56:11.860
looking at their four or five years worth of high school

56:11.860 --> 56:15.380
and giving them credit for what they've accomplished,

56:15.380 --> 56:17.140
things that they've participated in.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.660
It's a very nice compliment for a school

56:20.660 --> 56:24.300
to be able to look at how their students were able

56:24.300 --> 56:25.760
to show that they were prepared

56:25.760 --> 56:28.300
or approaching prepared on this measure.

56:28.300 --> 56:30.820
So we will be releasing this this spring.

56:30.820 --> 56:33.840
And again, it's only available to authorized personnel.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.020
The other thing that we've been working on for several years

56:38.020 --> 56:39.580
and continue to work on,

56:39.580 --> 56:41.740
because you do have to ramp up on these things

56:41.740 --> 56:44.340
around the college career measures,

56:44.340 --> 56:47.500
is the development of two new measures for this indicator

56:47.500 --> 56:50.500
around civic engagement and industry certifications.

56:50.500 --> 56:52.420
And we know that the State Board of Education

56:52.420 --> 56:55.020
has taken action on civic engagement.

56:55.020 --> 56:57.900
And we have been working as a department

56:57.900 --> 57:01.980
to determine how best to collect that information,

57:01.980 --> 57:04.680
whether it's in our student level data system

57:04.680 --> 57:06.780
or in an auxiliary system,

57:06.780 --> 57:10.500
that would capture students' information

57:10.500 --> 57:14.940
as well as how they potentially were able to demonstrate

57:14.940 --> 57:19.340
that they achieved the civic engagement seal.

57:19.340 --> 57:22.220
So we have met with the civic engagement group.

57:22.220 --> 57:27.220
They are very civically active and engaged in a great way,

57:27.700 --> 57:31.900
and in collaboration with our educator excellence division.

57:31.900 --> 57:35.300
And I know that we have a meeting coming up later this summer

57:35.300 --> 57:38.580
in which we'll talk about the data collection plan

57:38.980 --> 57:40.920
for this next couple of years.

57:42.060 --> 57:44.140
Additionally, we have been working

57:44.140 --> 57:46.820
with our college career transition division

57:46.820 --> 57:51.220
under director Pete Callis around industry certifications.

57:51.220 --> 57:54.080
And this is absolutely a multi-year process.

57:54.080 --> 57:57.660
There is not a national standard for any of these metrics.

57:57.660 --> 58:01.180
And so California is really having to take a step back,

58:01.180 --> 58:04.140
look to others, how they've attempted to put it

58:04.140 --> 58:06.540
into something like their accountability system,

58:06.580 --> 58:08.660
how they've attempted to collect this information,

58:08.660 --> 58:10.660
again, through their student level data system.

58:10.660 --> 58:15.300
And so we are continuing that work in 2022 and beyond.

58:17.420 --> 58:19.660
I'm gonna switch over to assessments.

58:19.660 --> 58:21.420
And just so you know, Mal Vang is in the room

58:21.420 --> 58:23.020
in case you have any tough questions

58:23.020 --> 58:24.540
around our assessments.

58:24.540 --> 58:28.380
I know she's up after me for a couple of items.

58:28.380 --> 58:29.860
We are continuing.

58:29.860 --> 58:32.380
The board did take action several years back

58:32.380 --> 58:35.940
that they gave a nod that this California Science Test

58:35.940 --> 58:39.900
or CAST would be included in a future dashboard.

58:39.900 --> 58:43.900
We have been anxiously awaiting for these data to come in,

58:43.900 --> 58:46.540
for us to have two years of consecutive data.

58:46.540 --> 58:48.940
And so I think there's been some consternation in the field.

58:48.940 --> 58:50.500
You saw that in the letters

58:50.500 --> 58:52.580
that we have not been able to act sooner

58:52.580 --> 58:56.980
on including this test into the accountability system.

58:56.980 --> 58:58.300
And because the accountability system

58:58.300 --> 58:59.700
is of course of high stakes,

58:59.700 --> 59:02.980
schools are identified for needs improvement

59:02.980 --> 59:06.300
and eligibility for districts

59:06.300 --> 59:08.540
under differentiated assistance.

59:08.540 --> 59:10.620
It's really important that we get it right.

59:10.620 --> 59:13.940
And so we've taken a tact

59:13.940 --> 59:16.140
in which we've been working very closely

59:16.140 --> 59:17.660
with our assessments division

59:17.660 --> 59:19.260
to make sure that the years of data

59:19.260 --> 59:21.820
that we would use to start this process

59:22.780 --> 59:27.100
are valid and reliable and we can move forward on this.

59:27.100 --> 59:29.420
So there is just a couple of things,

59:29.420 --> 59:31.540
factors that we've been mulling over

59:31.540 --> 59:34.180
and the fact that we've had a limited number of students

59:34.180 --> 59:38.140
completing the assessment during the pandemic is a concern.

59:38.140 --> 59:40.420
The use of the revised blueprint

59:40.420 --> 59:43.300
that the State Board of Education approved back in January

59:43.300 --> 59:47.940
will be in operation this school year.

59:47.940 --> 59:51.140
There is also a need as we think about

59:51.140 --> 59:53.100
bringing it into the dashboard,

59:53.100 --> 59:54.700
not just for informational purposes,

59:54.700 --> 59:56.940
but to actually include in an indicator,

59:56.940 --> 59:58.820
whether it's a standalone indicator

59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.860
or something that is attached to an academic indicator,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:03.700
that we need to make sure

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.180
that we have the appropriate balance

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.020
of academic and non-academic indicators

01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.700
in our accountability system

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.380
under the Every Student Succeeds Act.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.340
So that is another piece of it.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.180
We will continue to update you as we make progress

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:19.860
and as of course we have successful administrations

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.420
of this new blueprint in the current school year.

01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.620
And finally on assessments is our student growth model.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:31.020
Those of you that were on the board last year,

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.500
you had the pleasure of approving

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.060
the student growth model at your main meeting.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.980
We are looking forward to a couple of years from now

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:42.300
when we're gonna have the necessary data sets

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:47.100
to actually use the growth model in the accountability system

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:50.660
and use it for actionable decisions at the local level.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.220
So we are going to spend,

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.060
as we get our first years of data,

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.100
all sets of data in 2022 and 2023,

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.260
working with our contractor educational testing services

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:05.500
to make sure that we have the appropriate visual displays

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.380
on how to provide this information back to the public

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.580
because this is a very complex model

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.420
and we need to make sure

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.740
that we're communicating appropriately

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:16.580
with not only our educational partners

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.220
but with parents and community members

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.940
about what this means.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.780
So we are committed to working on that

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.580
over the next several years as well.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:29.060
Shifting gears to teacher data

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:34.060
and teacher data has been a very long process

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.980
for us to bring this forward for priority one.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.580
So this year you will see for the first time

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:47.820
the state inputting data into the dashboard for priority one.

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.780
Up until now that has been done at the local level

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:55.940
and SB 75, which is passed in 2019,

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.540
required the board and the department

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:02.540
to look at what data we collected at the state level

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.180
that could replace the local indicators.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.860
So we are currently processing this data set

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.340
based on a data sharing agreement

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:13.220
with the commission on teacher credentialing.

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.980
And so here's a couple of high level dates

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:20.020
that we think are feasible for us to meet

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.020
around getting this data out.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:26.860
So we are in the process of developing a report

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.980
and making sure that the data has met

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:31.540
all of the necessary quality checks

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.340
to release on data quest.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:37.260
That information will be relevant for the reporting

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.140
out of this information on priority one

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.820
for the 2022 dashboard.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:43.260
We are also committed this year

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:45.740
to convening an ad hoc policy group

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:48.860
to solicit feedback on how to report this data.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.900
There's been questions around the definition.

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.460
We will review the data elements

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.700
and also talk about resources to the field

01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:58.820
because unfortunately the definitions around teacher data

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.940
change depending on what you're reporting on.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.820
So whether it's the dashboard,

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.700
the school accountability report card,

01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.700
the Williams case legislation,

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.100
they all have different terminology.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:08.940
And so we need to make sure

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.660
that we are not confusing the field with what we are doing.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:16.980
We will update the board on our progress this fall

01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:20.260
either during an item or through a memo.

01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.020
And then finally in 2023,

01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:26.700
when we have this second year of data

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:28.220
that we're able to release,

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:32.140
we'll come back, circle back to that ad hoc policy group

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:33.740
and engage our technical experts

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.820
to develop objective criteria.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.540
We need two years of data to develop objective criteria

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.260
based on the standards that we use

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.100
for putting items into the California school dashboard.

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.180
So my final slide in this section is around next year.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.980
So 2023 dashboard and beyond,

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.660
we anticipate again,

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.300
that we can restart our performance colors

01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:00.180
by adding in a second year of data with change.

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:01.940
And the exception will continue

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:03.980
to be the college career indicator

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:07.540
in which we can only report on status due to again,

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.780
not having assessment data from the prior year.

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.580
For 2024, we'll bring in all of our indicators

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.340
to the dashboard and report out on status,

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.140
change and performance colors.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.460
So with that, I'm happy to turn it over

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.340
to President Darlene Hammond for any questions,

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.700
technical questions from members of the board.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.820
Thank you so much, Cindy,

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.180
not only for that really thorough presentation,

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:33.820
but also for all the work you've done for many, many years

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:37.820
to build the new accountability system that we are using,

01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:41.780
that really the process started in some sense in 2013

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:43.620
with the local control funding formula.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.340
So we're almost a decade into building this

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:51.020
and your work has been extraordinary in that regard.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.420
Right now, I think we just wanna take

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.540
clarification questions and we will go

01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:58.460
to discussion questions later for new board members.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.860
I knew a little participant

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.420
or there's a little raise hand icon

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:06.580
that will show me if you have a clarifying question

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.780
at this time.

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.540
And I would like to start off with one if I could

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:12.380
while others are thinking about

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.140
whether they have any.

01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:18.180
Cindy, could you go back to the slide,

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.580
which was the English learner progress slide,

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:26.580
which showed some designations of what was considered,

01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:31.580
which numerical rates of progress were considered

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.700
to be high, medium, low.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.020
Thank you very much.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:40.020
And just say a little bit about how those were determined

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.420
and is that something that,

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.540
I think it'd be good for people to have clarification

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.020
on where those come from.

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:56.300
Sure, so this slide, just to again put it into context

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.260
is an example of how to report out on status only.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:02.260
It sounds like your question though is around

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:03.940
how were the scores,

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:07.860
there are the levels that you see on this scorecard set.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.860
So the progress levels that you see,

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:16.100
very high, high, medium, low, very low,

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:19.100
went through a rigorous data analysis process

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.740
by my division.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.620
It went through our technical design group

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.940
as well as the English learner advisory group.

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:31.780
We have a policy group that advises us on the indicator

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:35.260
who are made up of practitioners as well as researchers.

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.860
And with all of those measures or feedback rather

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.140
from those groups,

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:42.340
as well as the California Petitions Advisory Group

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.700
and the other educational groups

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:47.260
that we always reach out to,

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.980
we brought forward a recommendation to the state board

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.580
and the state board adopted these,

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.060
they're considered cut scores really,

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.540
they're based on cut scores.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.340
So this is the status cut scores.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:02.340
So I think part of what I've heard from other groups

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:07.820
in looking at this, what we call a baseball card,

01:07:07.820 --> 01:07:09.500
this may not very, very user friendly.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.380
And we may wanna think about for this one year only

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.100
doing something drastically different

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.140
than we've ever done around status.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:21.580
Maybe it's creating a different visual.

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.460
We lose some of the text,

01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:27.300
but this particular baseball card and the development of it

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.660
went through, like I said, a very rigorous vetting process.

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:34.380
The actual display of it had several changes

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.540
through especially that policy committee

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:40.780
that advises us on the English Learner Progress Indicator.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.180
And that's how we arrived at this particular one.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.740
The other piece I've heard just as far as feedback

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.380
from the field is that unlike our other baseball cards,

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.500
this one does not have a comparison to the state.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:54.020
And so this may not, again,

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.420
may not be the best representation,

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.940
but this is something that is technically currently

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.540
on the website on the 2019 dashboard.

01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:02.980
Thank you, that's really helpful.

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.540
And I just wanna note that as we were dealing

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:08.460
with all of the challenges last year

01:08:08.460 --> 01:08:10.820
of how to get assessments done,

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.060
and of course, some districts used

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.060
our Smarter Balanced CASP assessments,

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.180
others used when they could not administer those,

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.340
they used other assessments,

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:24.300
we were able to get a very, very high share

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.620
of our English learners assessed on our LPAC assessment.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.260
So the data for this are much more comprehensive

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.500
and complete than for the other tests.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.460
And I wanna appreciate all the people

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:40.260
who made that possible both in the department

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.980
and in the field for that.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.340
Are there other clarifying questions?

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.540
Yes, member Patia Bronson.

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.500
Hey, thank you.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.860
I also appreciate the thoroughness of the report

01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:58.380
and also that we are creating something new

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.380
in the midst of challenging circumstances

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.820
with the pandemic and the effect on assessments.

01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:07.980
So thank you for your leadership again.

01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:11.660
I was just, I wanted to actually ask

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:13.140
for a clarification you had mentioned

01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:15.340
in ad hoc policy advisory group.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:18.460
And if you could just talk about to what extent

01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.940
community members have been engaged,

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.100
parents of EL children,

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:28.500
and also of advocacy organizations

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.500
who represent both the children and families.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:33.700
And just to clarify,

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.100
you're discussing specifically

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.220
around the English learner progress indicator

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.820
or the accountability system?

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.420
The LP, yes.

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.220
So the English learner progress indicator work group

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.500
for accountability that advises the department

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.820
has several representatives from LEAs,

01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:53.420
including county offices of education

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:56.500
who are very active in the English learner community.

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:59.140
We do have researchers,

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:04.140
including a very notable member from West Ed,

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.620
and I'm forgetting Molly's last name,

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:13.620
but just leaders in the field in terms of research.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.260
Magali, I will be able to,

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:20.700
I can give you a list of those names.

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.940
They're actually in a board memo from several years back.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:25.020
So I know that they're in our board item

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:27.020
because we list all of the previous board items

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.180
related to our indicators.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:29.900
So we'll follow up with you,

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:32.220
member Pertio, Bronson.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.220
I guess the related question to that is just,

01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:39.980
is there, or can you say more about sort of

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.940
what the community engagement plan looks like going forward,

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.980
particularly around cut scores in LP?

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:49.660
Sure, I mean, I think that for any of our measures,

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.700
what we're hearing from the field is an interest

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.060
in looking at cut scores over the next couple of years.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.300
And so I wouldn't treat LP differently

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.060
than I would treat any of the other metrics.

01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:06.060
That is something that the department worked tirelessly

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.380
on to establish.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.620
I am worried.

01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:13.740
I know that President Darling-Hammond mentioned

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.820
that we've had a great participation rate for our LP

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.740
this last cycle.

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:21.660
And so putting together this new set of data

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.700
based on post or current pandemic measures,

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.140
it'll be, I think overall,

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:29.260
we need to look at what do cut scores look like

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:30.100
moving forward.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.820
But there is not a specific engagement strategy

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:35.640
per indicator.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.820
We do meet with our policy work groups

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.220
on a regular basis.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.620
And so we'll go back through that process

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:44.060
and then we'll make sure that

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.860
through the California Patricia's Advisory Group,

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.940
which members of the public do serve on

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:52.940
and are very vocal about this population of students,

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.420
we'll get feedback from them.

01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.060
And of course, there's obvious opportunities

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:58.020
for public comment during that process.

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:03.540
Right, I'm not seeing any other clarifying questions,

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.460
but I do have one.

01:12:05.460 --> 01:12:08.300
I believe that you said that in terms of what we'll show

01:12:08.300 --> 01:12:09.980
on the dashboard this year,

01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:11.940
we will not be using our color coding,

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.980
but we'll be giving the status information.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.660
Is that correct?

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.500
That is correct.

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.580
So it will look different.

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.700
We understand that we are very committed to growth

01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.260
as well as growth and progress,

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.780
as well as status,

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.260
which will not be possible

01:12:29.260 --> 01:12:30.660
for all of the indicators this year.

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:34.220
So it will not look like our normal dashboard,

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.620
but it will give information.

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.020
Member Lewis.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:43.460
Just a clarifying question again about status reporting

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.900
as it relates to suspension rates.

01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:52.420
I think you had a slide that had all of the indicators

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.420
on there, but I didn't see one for suspension rates.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.580
So since we didn't have any reporting on the dashboard

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:04.580
for suspension rates since 2019,

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.300
and then for this year,

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:08.980
it's gonna be status only, correct?

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:10.460
So does that have,

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:15.460
does that halt disproportionality assignments to districts?

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.660
I cannot speak on the disproportionality assignments.

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.780
That's our special education division.

01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:22.180
I have turned to the slide

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.700
in which the indicators are listed,

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.300
and we did group suspension with chronic absenteeism.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.300
We have been reporting out on suspension rate on data quest.

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.820
So I wanna make sure that I say that out loud.

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:36.100
We know that suspension rates

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.820
dramatically decreased last year, the full year of COVID,

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.900
and we have heard some consternation

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.300
about students returning to the classroom

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.340
and some suspension rates going up in certain situations.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.140
Okay, thank you.

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:52.980
You're welcome.

01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.740
Any other clarifying questions?

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:58.300
I know Cindy has more to tell us.

01:13:59.620 --> 01:14:01.500
I don't see any other hands raised,

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.900
so I think Cindy, you can proceed apace.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.940
Okay, so this is the quickest attachment,

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.540
and I won't pause for questions here

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:10.860
because it's simply telling you,

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.580
or rather sharing with you,

01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:15.940
the amount of outreach we've been doing over the last year.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:20.100
And while my entire team of 40 plus staff

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:22.780
have been working remotely, including myself,

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.860
we have gotten out to the field.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.140
We have held policy work group meetings.

01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:29.900
As you can see, we list the participant numbers,

01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:31.380
but I think really the most important one

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.020
at the bottom there shows,

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.220
we did 26 virtual meetings with over 5,000 participants.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.780
So while accountability is suspended,

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:41.180
there is absolutely still interest

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:45.300
in engaging in how schools are doing,

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:46.740
how districts are doing,

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.100
how we can better report on data at the state level

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.700
absent accountability or absent a data set.

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:56.420
And so that is really the work that we've been doing

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.340
in the division that I'm very proud of,

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.980
very proud of the team in light of all those obstacles.

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:03.980
And with that, I'm gonna turn it over to my colleague,

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.700
Joe Sines to introduce you to attachment three

01:15:07.700 --> 01:15:09.180
and our request for a waiver

01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.980
from the US Department of Education.

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:20.180
Thank you, Cindy.

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:23.860
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond,

01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:26.420
Superintendent Thurman and state board members.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.700
For those of you who don't know me, my name is Joe Sines.

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:30.420
I'm the Federal Policy Liaison

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.820
at the CDE's Government Affairs Division.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:36.500
And I will be reviewing the Dashboard Alternative School

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.140
Status or DAS General Waiver.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.420
So just for a review on the origins of the DAS program,

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:52.420
goes back to 2017, California Education Code Section 52052D

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.820
allows the establishment of the DAS program.

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.100
So this program is intended to ensure

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.860
that California's accountability system

01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:03.100
fairly evaluates the success or progress

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.660
of alternative schools that serve high-risk students.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:09.180
With the adoption of the Dashboard in 2017,

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:12.140
the SBE acknowledged that the system did not address

01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:13.940
the success or progress of students

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.860
in alternative school settings.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.620
The SBE subsequently directed the CDE

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.540
to develop indicators for alternative schools

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:24.380
that evaluate the success and progress of these schools

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:26.460
based on the LCFF state priorities

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.540
and accountability requirements in ESSA.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:33.060
So the intent was not to develop

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.620
a separate accountability system for alternative schools,

01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.660
but rather to include modified metrics for indicators

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.820
on the California School Dashboard Indicators

01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.020
that fairly evaluate alternative schools.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.340
So as a refresher, schools are automatically assigned

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:51.500
to DAS status because the school type

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.260
is identified in education code.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.180
So this would be continuation schools,

01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.260
county community schools, juvenile court, et cetera,

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.700
or is a district-operated special education school

01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:03.220
that has at least 70% of students who participate

01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:07.100
in the California Alternate Assessment, or CA,

01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.340
in grades three through eight and grade 11.

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.500
We know that the California Alternate Assessment

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.620
is given to a very select number of students,

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.060
but they are highly concentrated

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:18.940
in district-operated special education schools.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:22.420
Additionally, we provide an opportunity

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.420
for schools to apply for DAS status.

01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:26.980
For this, it must be validated

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.380
that at least 70% of the school population

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.940
is comprised of high-risk student groups.

01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:39.540
So this slide gives a representation

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:43.220
of what it looks like in the schools

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:47.220
that are considered DAS due to education code language,

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:49.220
which we see a majority of them are.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.980
Approximately 835 schools, or 80% of those schools,

01:17:54.980 --> 01:17:57.100
are automatically assigned by school type.

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:02.620
39 are from the district-operated special education schools,

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:06.340
and 170 schools through the DAS application process.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.660
So looking at it by the numbers,

01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.060
DAS students represent about 2.5%

01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:17.100
of the total number of students in California schools,

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:21.140
151,000 DAS students out of six million total students.

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.700
DAS schools represent about 10%

01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:25.420
of the total number of schools,

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:30.180
so 1,044 out of about 10,000 total schools.

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.220
This is significant for our accountability system.

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:35.980
We have over 1,000 DAS schools,

01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:38.580
which far exceeds any other state in the nation.

01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:41.140
And the number of students served

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.300
in this alternative setting

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:45.340
is also much more than any other state.

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.660
So DAS schools receive performance colors

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:52.300
on every state indicator.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.380
However, to fairly hold DAS schools accountable,

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.860
we identified three indicators

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:58.500
where we could implement modified methods.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.380
Specifically, these were the graduation rate indicator,

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:06.180
the college career indicator, and the academic indicator.

01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:14.380
So just, you know, I know it's hard to even remember 2020,

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.020
much less 2017, so for the background,

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.860
we can take a look at the timeline of the DAS program.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.900
2017 was when the state board requested

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.940
the development of the DAS program,

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:26.220
and the work that went into this program was robust

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.300
and done in partnership

01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.300
with the alternative schools community.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:33.660
There was a lot of work with CPAC, the state board,

01:19:33.660 --> 01:19:35.340
the alternative schools task force,

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:39.180
and other interest groups to develop and vet these proposals.

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.300
In 2018, the CDE was able to bring before the state board

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.940
to approve the use of modified methods

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.260
of state indicators for DAS schools.

01:19:48.260 --> 01:19:51.180
In 2020, California received a letter from ED stating

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:53.220
that the use of modified methods

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.980
to calculate state indicators for DAS schools

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.420
is not permissible.

01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:00.060
Specifically, the following is prohibited.

01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.020
Establishing different cut scores for DAS schools

01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.500
for the academic indicator,

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.740
and using a one-year graduation rate,

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.420
which our modified method is.

01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:15.620
And so for the continued timeline in 2020,

01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.380
December of 2020 to be exact,

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:20.860
CPAC received an update on the letter from ED,

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.260
and CDE staff received feedback

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.820
on the modified measures for DAS schools.

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.980
Also, the state board received an information memorandum

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:30.260
on the letter from ED.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:34.940
Following that, in January 2021,

01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.820
the SBE approved amendments to California's SSA state plan

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:40.380
to bring the DAS modified methods business rules

01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.140
for calculating the academic achievement indicator

01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.060
into compliance with federal law.

01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.460
Okay.

01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:53.540
Okay.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:57.180
However, in January 2022, we received two letters from ED

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.980
in response to California's SSA state plan amendments.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:03.380
In February, the SBE received a memo

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.580
with a copy of the responses from ED.

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:09.300
All right.

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:13.660
So in the letter from ED, they specifically stated

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.540
that CDE's modified methods

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.420
do not meet the SSA requirements.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:21.020
They stated that SSA only allows the use

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:24.180
of alternative accountability metrics for schools

01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.900
missing the data required for accountability determinations.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:31.220
In this letter, they specifically called out preschool

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.780
through second grade schools.

01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:34.460
They did this since C-schools are unable

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.940
to have an academic indicator

01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:38.180
since they do not test in these grade levels,

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.900
and therefore an alternative accountability metric

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:41.740
is permitted.

01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:44.980
However, they do not approve this for schools

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.340
that do have the necessary data

01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:49.700
to receive an accountability determination.

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:53.380
So this would be DAS schools that test students.

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:56.340
Therefore, we cannot substitute an accountability metric.

01:22:00.020 --> 01:22:03.860
So this slide takes a look at what the denial

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.660
of these amendments have,

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.180
the impact of the denial of these amendments have.

01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:09.740
We would no longer be able to use

01:22:09.740 --> 01:22:11.140
the one-year graduation rate.

01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:14.340
We would instead have to use the four-year cohort rate.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:16.740
Additionally, DAS schools will be held

01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:19.340
to the same cut scores for the academic indicator

01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:21.700
on the five-by-five performance level grid

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.380
as non-DAS schools.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.020
And so this would begin immediately with the 2022 dashboard

01:22:27.020 --> 01:22:29.620
that is due to be released this fall.

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:36.420
So there is an option to request a waiver of SSA statute,

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:38.460
which we are discussing today.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.620
This has been done in the past.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.940
This would potentially allow us

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:44.060
to keep the current system in place

01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:47.300
and would allow for modified measures for DAS schools

01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.020
through the DAS one-year graduation rate

01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:51.820
under the graduation rate indicator.

01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:57.980
Different five-by-five cut scores for DAS schools.

01:22:57.980 --> 01:22:59.580
And for the academic indicator,

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.500
different five-by-five cut scores for DAS schools as well.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:09.620
Now we'll walk through additional considerations

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.700
that ED provided in the response letter

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.060
to the CDE on the DAS amendments.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.700
Specifically, two of the ways they suggested using

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:24.420
to reduce the impact of identification of DAS schools

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.260
being over-identified for support

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:28.060
were partial attendance modifications

01:23:28.060 --> 01:23:31.060
to dashboard indicators and also to modify

01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.220
how we assist schools for support.

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:38.580
For partial attendance, we could look at excluding students

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.420
who have not attended the same school within an LEA

01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:45.140
for at least half of a school year.

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:46.820
For school support eligibility,

01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:48.620
we could change the identification pool

01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:51.100
for the lowest performing 5% of Title I schools

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.460
from all schools to identification school type.

01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:58.140
So this would be elementary schools, middle schools,

01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:00.100
high schools, and DAS schools.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.500
Additionally, while the CDE is waiting for action

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:06.620
from ED on the waiver,

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:09.300
the CDE is exploring options to continue to include

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.340
the modified measures for the graduation rate

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.740
on the dashboard for informational purposes.

01:24:15.220 --> 01:24:19.380
This may include other yet-to-be-determined measures.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.780
We can also develop a new report that displays

01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:24.220
an additional DAS color placement designation

01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.940
on the school dashboard,

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.780
additional reports, five-by-five placement report.

01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:32.700
And finally, the CDE is considering the development

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:35.060
of a new report that displays the DAS schools'

01:24:35.060 --> 01:24:36.220
distance from standard

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:39.660
without the participation rate penalty.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:45.140
So we have received,

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.780
we currently do have public comment open

01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:51.140
for this potential waiver.

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:53.740
It's open through March 30th, 2022.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.900
As of March 8th, 2022, we received 15 comments,

01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:59.860
which were all supportive of pursuing the waiver.

01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.140
Also at the February 2022 meeting

01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:07.060
for the California Practitioners Advisory Group, or CPAG,

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.660
the members did express support

01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.700
for pursuing a DAS general waiver.

01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:16.620
So now I will pass it back to President Darling-Hammond

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.020
and the State Board members.

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.100
All right, thank you so much.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:26.260
Are there any clarifying questions for Joseph?

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.300
I am not seeing any yet.

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.020
Give it a minute of wait time.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.660
You were exceptionally clear.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.820
So I think we're passing the ball back to Cindy,

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.660
is that correct?

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.100
No, I'll be handling attachment for as well.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.900
Okay, then carry on.

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:51.220
All right, we are almost to the finish line.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.220
So I think we're going to pass it back to Joseph.

01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:56.300
We are almost to the finish line.

01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:58.820
Thank you for your attention.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.420
Our next attachment, attachment four,

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.740
will be California's 2021-22 Addendum Template

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.540
for the Consolidated State Plan due to COVID-19.

01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.260
So we'll start off for some vital background

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.820
on the prior federal COVID-19 waivers.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:16.100
As you know, the past couple of years,

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.820
we have dealt with this in each year.

01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:21.580
So I think it's important to have a little bit of background

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:24.380
for our new members and draw a line

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:27.340
of how we got to where we are today.

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.260
The first assessment and accountability waiver

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.340
we will look at will be the 2019-20 waiver

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.100
California submitted.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.780
Due to the extraordinary circumstances created

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.980
by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting school closures,

01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.020
U.S. Department of Education invited states

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.940
to request a waiver for the 2019-20 school year

01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:46.660
of the assessment requirements.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:49.700
Through this waiver,

01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.740
the states would not need to administer

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.420
statewide assessments to all students

01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:57.620
to make annual accountability determinations

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:00.500
to identify schools for support and improvement

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:02.900
or to provide data on its state and local report cards

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:05.300
for assessment and accountability information.

01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:11.020
Our waiver was supported or submitted

01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:13.420
by State Superintendent of Public Instruction,

01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:15.980
Tony Thurman, and California State Board of Education

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:19.140
President Linda Darling-Hammond on March 26th, 2020.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.260
And was approved quickly by ED on March 27th, 2020.

01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.700
For reference, this slide also lists the ESSA sections

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:30.060
that were requested to be waived and subsequently approved.

01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.980
Now that brings us to the next assessment

01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:38.380
and accountability waiver.

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.540
For the 2021 school year,

01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.180
ED offered the COVID-19 state plan addendum

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:45.500
to allow states to modify their accountability systems

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.860
described in their state plans

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.460
to account for the lack of data

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.580
due to the assessment and accountability waivers

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:52.980
from the 2019-20 school year.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:27:59.980
This waiver was brought before the SBE

01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:01.620
and approved for submission to ED,

01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.380
requesting that the following requirements be waived.

01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:07.780
This was the removal of the 95% participation rate penalty

01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:09.780
for the academic indicator,

01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:12.340
removal of the requirement to identify schools for support

01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:15.460
based on 2020-21 data,

01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:17.860
requirement for schools that are currently identified

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.100
to support to continue to receive support

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.860
in the 21-22 school year.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:25.100
This allowed states to exit comprehensive support

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.060
and improvement or CSI schools

01:28:27.060 --> 01:28:30.460
based on the graduation rate if exit criteria are met.

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:33.300
And this requires states resume identification of schools

01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:35.540
based on the 21-22 data.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:42.300
So now we get to the current 21-22 addendum template.

01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:44.500
In December of 2021, the ED released

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.940
the 2021-22 addendum template

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:49.620
for the consolidated state plan due to COVID-19

01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.700
to provide states a streamlined process

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:55.420
to modify state plans for only the 2021-22 school year

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.020
as they implement accountability

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.460
and school identification requirements.

01:28:59.460 --> 01:29:01.700
Now it is important to note that any changes

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:05.020
that would go beyond the 2021-22 school year

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.980
would require the CDE to use

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.180
the regular state plan amendment process,

01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.820
and this is a very important step

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:12.100
in the amendment process,

01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.260
and this is noted in the template as well.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.580
So the CDE proposes amending the state plan

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.860
by shifting forward timelines two years

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:29.340
for measurements of interim progress and long-term goals,

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:32.060
modifying the school quality indicator,

01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:34.260
and for schools eligible for assistance,

01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.660
this would be change in identification frequency,

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.020
change in methodology,

01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:40.740
and revising the entrance and exit criteria.

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:43.900
And now I have the pleasure

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.100
of passing the presentation back to Cindy.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.620
Thanks, Joe.

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.940
So just to note, I know that Joe mentioned

01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:57.300
that this addendum is only for the current school year,

01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.780
and just I think for our new members,

01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.700
and maybe for some of our older members,

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:03.780
these addendums are unprecedented.

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.700
Doing a streamlined waiver and getting a response back

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.860
from the U.S. Department of Education in 24 hours

01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.780
or a week is simply, that doesn't happen,

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:14.540
and I do have to acknowledge

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:16.660
that they have been extremely responsive

01:30:16.660 --> 01:30:19.060
to the COVID-19 situation

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.420
by preparing things like an addendum template.

01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:24.220
This is the third year in a row that they've done it,

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:28.140
and it has really relieved the departments,

01:30:28.140 --> 01:30:29.500
state departments of education

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:32.180
from having these onerous requirements

01:30:32.180 --> 01:30:33.620
placed on schools and districts,

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:37.020
and we know that there should be other places.

01:30:37.020 --> 01:30:39.460
So the Department of Education is recommending,

01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:42.900
and we did receive feedback even later on

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.300
from the California Fishers Advisory Group

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.260
that we take advantage of the opportunity

01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:51.700
to shift forward our long-term goals by two years.

01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:53.620
This is in keeping with the fact

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.740
that we've actually lost two years

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:58.060
in our accountability system

01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:02.140
to demonstrate that we are meeting long-term goals

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:05.140
or on our way to the measurements of interim progress,

01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:07.860
which are reported out through the dashboard

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.420
and on our statement earlier with the cards.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:12.740
And so we need to make sure

01:31:12.740 --> 01:31:15.940
that we're tweeting every indicator the same,

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.740
and so you do see our recommendation

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:22.220
that we shift the two-year,

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:25.500
or rather shift these timelines two years

01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:29.020
for the academic achievement graduation rate

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:32.020
and the progress in achieving English language proficiency.

01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:37.140
So the second piece that we want to also recommend

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:46.860
to the board to take advantage of

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:50.100
is the modification of the school quality indicator.

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:55.020
And in California, we use two indicators to measure this,

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.740
suspension rate and college per indicator.

01:31:57.740 --> 01:32:02.060
As we were thinking about this particular indicator

01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:05.140
and what is a challenge for us,

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.220
you've already heard,

01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:08.740
on reporting out on the college per indicator data,

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:11.300
we did reach out to the US Department of Education

01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:14.220
and had a phone call with them to talk through

01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.500
if we were not able to report out on this,

01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:20.380
would they be amenable to including this in our addendum?

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.220
And because we use two indicators to measure school quality,

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:24.620
they said, absolutely,

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.660
this is something that the addendum was designed for.

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:30.660
So we are, again, recommending removal of reporting

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:35.660
out on the college per indicator for the 2022 dashboard

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.500
due to limitations of that grade 11 assessment

01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:43.540
from this past administration, from the 2021 administration.

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.740
We will, of course, as you heard earlier,

01:32:45.740 --> 01:32:48.580
continue to use suspension rate and report out on that

01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:51.220
for all grade levels to meet the requirements

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:54.500
in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:59.020
The third piece is probably the one

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:02.380
that is one of the more difficult ones.

01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:04.580
We are required to identify schools

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:05.940
for the first time in two years.

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:08.860
I've just mentioned that in the prior attachment.

01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.820
So the identification process

01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:12.900
falls into two different categories,

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:14.940
comprehensive support and improvement,

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:17.340
and additional targeted support and improvement.

01:33:17.340 --> 01:33:19.140
And these determinations will be made

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:23.060
based on using data from the 2022 dashboard.

01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:25.100
As you heard in the previous attachment,

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.020
we are prohibited from reporting out

01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:31.460
on additional years of data on the dashboard

01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:34.100
due to the constraints from Assembly Bill 130.

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.780
And so this one-time change in the addendum,

01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:42.540
we are gonna be suggesting over the next couple of slides,

01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:45.660
several one-time changes that would affect

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.220
for the 2022 identification cycle.

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:55.700
So the first piece is the change in methodology.

01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.860
We have our current state plan

01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:03.620
that is approved by the US Department of Education shows,

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.420
rather, let me take a step back.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:08.900
We are going back to using our English Learner Progress

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:12.660
Indicator as an example of how we'd like to change

01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.820
the methodology by using status only

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:16.660
for identification purposes.

01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.220
We were in this situation back in 2019

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.620
because there was a condition placed on us

01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:23.460
by the US Department of Education

01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:27.340
to utilize the LP to identify schools.

01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.900
And so we used a proxy of very low

01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:33.460
for our red performance categories.

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:37.980
We did that based on data analysis and simulations,

01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.300
trying to see, trying to make sure

01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.300
there wasn't a lot of noise in the data

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:45.140
and that we were identifying the right types of schools,

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.940
again, based on this proxy.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:53.140
We found in that simulation process back in 2018-19

01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:56.700
if we used other status levels, for example,

01:34:56.700 --> 01:35:00.740
low as a proxy for orange, that we introduced error

01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:05.660
or the correlation didn't tend to be as strong.

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.420
In November of 2019, the State Board approved

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:11.580
the recommendation to use this in the methodology

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:15.620
and we were able to identify schools

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.340
using the English Learner Progress Indicator

01:35:18.340 --> 01:35:20.540
as part of the methodology.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:24.420
So we are suggesting that we take the lessons learned

01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.700
from this one indicator

01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:27.620
and apply it to the entire dashboard.

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.660
We have done additional simulations

01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.580
now that when the addendum came out,

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.540
we met internally, we thought about how we could

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.940
bring forward this item to you

01:35:41.940 --> 01:35:45.100
and make sure that it was based on a recommendation

01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:49.340
that was valid and reliable and technically sound.

01:35:49.380 --> 01:35:53.980
And so these simulations have been run

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:55.100
by our technical design group

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:57.820
as well as the various policy groups

01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:00.300
that I've mentioned previously.

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.460
What we found is very low is,

01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.340
I know we use the word decent,

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:07.300
but it is an appropriate proxy for red.

01:36:07.300 --> 01:36:12.300
We did confirm with this new simulations that we conducted

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.540
that low, medium, and high,

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.260
and so the corresponding colors would be orange,

01:36:17.260 --> 01:36:22.260
yellow, and green are not suitable proxies for the color

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.740
because of the increased level of error.

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.220
And you can see that in the data

01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:29.460
that I show below on this slide.

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:31.660
So you can see at either ends of the spectrum,

01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:35.220
very low and red and very high and blue,

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.780
there's a high correlation,

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:41.340
but as soon as you get into orange and yellow and green,

01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.900
there's just a much higher level of error

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:47.900
that is introduced because you're bringing change

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:50.780
into the situation, it has more of an impact.

01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:58.420
So in thinking about how to shift eligibility criteria,

01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:01.060
again, for this one year only,

01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.220
we went back and we looked at

01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.340
what our current eligibility criteria was

01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.780
in our SSA state plan.

01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:07.620
That is what you see on the screen,

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.260
but we've made some edits to it.

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.740
So the suggestion that we started with was,

01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:15.380
let's simply cross out anywhere that it said a color

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:18.860
and substitute it for the corresponding status level.

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.220
We know that each of these criteria,

01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.860
I should say that you saw that they all introduce error,

01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.820
some of them higher than others

01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:31.700
because status is not in a direct correlation

01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:32.820
or proxy for color.

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.820
And in looking at this list,

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:41.580
I should actually just take a step back.

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:45.100
When we look at schools for comprehensive support

01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:47.700
and improvement, the first category we need to look for

01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:52.300
is any school that has a graduation rate less than 68%.

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:54.660
We take those out of the pool, they're identified.

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:57.300
We then look at Title I schools.

01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:00.500
So Title I schools who meet the criteria below,

01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:04.100
and this is done in the hierarchical method.

01:38:06.460 --> 01:38:09.940
So the requirement for the low performing

01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:13.620
comprehensive support and improvement identification

01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:18.620
is that we identify 5%, not rounding up to 5%,

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.660
but at least 5% of schools in the state.

01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.260
And so the simulation results that you see below

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:30.020
on this slide, we use the status criteria

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.060
from the 2019 dashboard.

01:38:32.060 --> 01:38:33.860
We applied this methodology,

01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:38.300
so using a proxy of very low for red.

01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.020
And the descriptions that you see,

01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:43.580
so this is referring to each of the indicators.

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.660
So if I'm a school with, a high school rather,

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:50.660
you may not have as many indicators

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:52.940
as an elementary school may.

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:56.580
And so that's why these categories are all very low,

01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:59.220
all very low except one majority and very low.

01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.900
So that's each of the indicators together

01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.060
create these descriptions.

01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.300
So to walk you through what this slide is trying to tell us

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:11.540
is that for all very low,

01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.180
if we were to use the 2019 data,

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:18.980
we would see 163 schools being eligible,

01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:21.140
Title I schools being eligible for assistance.

01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.940
That equals 2.4% of our Title I schools,

01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:26.500
again, minus those that had already been identified

01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.100
for graduation rate, low graduation rate.

01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:31.660
We bring in the second criteria, we go,

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:35.860
if this is moving cumulative, we get up to 4.9%.

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:38.340
Keep in mind, we have to get over 5%.

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.540
So we need to bring in at least that third criteria,

01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.940
we'd come up to 7%.

01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.100
If we brought in the fourth criteria, we'd be up to 11%.

01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:48.780
So well above and beyond the requirements

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:52.620
of the Every Student Succeeds Act for California.

01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.140
So with that in mind,

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.540
the two status criteria of all very low

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:03.620
and all very low except for one gets us to 4.9%.

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:07.980
And my staff tell me that's eight schools short of 5%.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:10.380
We know that life has changed dramatically

01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:13.180
in our schools since 2019.

01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:16.020
And there is a high likelihood that we will be able

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:19.340
to only have to use those first two criteria

01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:21.700
to meet the 5% threshold.

01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.940
But just in case we don't,

01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.700
we wanna make sure that we have a backup plan.

01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:30.180
And so this is another look at the data.

01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:34.020
This is simply giving you a bit of context

01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:35.260
for those of you that I know

01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:37.740
President Donny Hammond likes to look at data,

01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.140
look at the error that is introduced.

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:43.700
So we looked at the 2019 data.

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:48.500
And if we are using the status levels instead of color,

01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:50.620
we're actually identifying 64 more schools

01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.100
using this methodology 135

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.580
using the first two methodologies and so on.

01:40:56.580 --> 01:41:00.140
And so just another look at the fact

01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:02.980
that it's not a perfect correlation of proxy

01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:04.780
between red and very low.

01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:08.220
So the recommendation is from the department

01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:10.900
that we use criteria one and two.

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:15.260
And if we don't meet that 5%, we incorporate criteria three.

01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:17.820
So you see those criteria in the addendum,

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.260
the first three criteria.

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:20.980
We don't believe we need criteria four

01:41:20.980 --> 01:41:23.020
because based on, again, our simulations,

01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.780
we know we're gonna get to 5%

01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:26.580
just with those first three criteria.

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:31.220
And with that, I think turn it back over

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:32.540
to Joe to close this out.

01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:38.700
Okay, and just to review our feedback on this

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:43.700
from interest groups, at the February, 2022 CPAC meeting,

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:46.420
the members expressed support for our proposal

01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:50.420
to submit the 2021-22 addendum template.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.580
And so finishing off our recommendations,

01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:58.220
the California Department of Education

01:41:58.220 --> 01:42:00.060
recommends that the State Board of Education

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:02.500
take action related to the 2022

01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:06.580
Accountability Work Plan as deemed necessary and appropriate,

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:10.020
that the SBE delegate to the SBE executive director

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:13.060
to pursue as expeditiously as possible

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:15.260
a waiver to allow California to maintain

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:17.340
DAS modified methods business rules

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.700
for calculating the academic achievement

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.740
and graduation rate indicators,

01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:24.260
and that the SBE approve California's submission

01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:26.580
of the 2021-22 addendum template

01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:29.380
for the consolidated state plan due to COVID-19.

01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:30.860
Simple enough.

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:37.220
How simple on a scale of one to 10.

01:42:39.220 --> 01:42:44.220
So before we get into public comment or discussion,

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:48.020
I wanna just be sure that if there are clarifying questions

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:53.020
on the last portion of the presentation, we take those.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.340
And it is complicated.

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.020
I do have one clarification.

01:42:57.180 --> 01:42:58.420
It's complicated.

01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:00.740
I do have one clarifying question myself

01:43:02.020 --> 01:43:04.020
that I'd like to ask and if others do,

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:07.540
and then we will go into fuller discussion of everything.

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:10.900
So Cindy, you did a good job of explaining to us

01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.900
how we need to recreate five percentage of Title I schools

01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:21.500
need to be identified for support and intervention.

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.460
And of course, we've always done that in the past

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.940
with growth and progress and status being considered.

01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:36.700
Obviously, this is not the approach we would have chosen.

01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:40.300
It's the approach that meets the federal requirement

01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.220
for this year.

01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:45.900
You start off mentioning the high schools

01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:49.220
who have less than a 68% graduation rate.

01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:55.340
When you identify those, do they count into the 5%?

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:00.740
And maybe you could help us understand the relationship

01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:04.140
between the two sets of calculations,

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:06.620
the high school calculation, and then of course,

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.460
you know, the identification of other schools

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.580
who are rated very low on the status indicator.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.420
Absolutely, and in fact, I wish I had a graphic

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:18.820
because I do think this is not intuitive.

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:21.500
There's a Venn diagram in there somewhere, I think.

01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:23.100
This is not intuitive.

01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:27.740
So the first step when you look at identification

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:29.380
for comprehensive support and improvement

01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:32.420
is to look at all high schools in the state

01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:36.660
and see if they fall below that 68%.

01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.060
If they do, they're automatically in

01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:41.340
and they're taken out of the pool of schools.

01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:46.060
We then shrink the pool of schools to just Title I schools,

01:44:46.060 --> 01:44:49.900
which was, I just wanna go back to my numbers,

01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:54.420
which is 6,852 for 2019.

01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.420
So that N at the top of this last column here.

01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:04.500
So the 5% is based on schools that are in the pool

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.500
after we've removed the low graduation rate

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:08.740
that are Title I.

01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:13.020
So we need to do 5% of 6,852,

01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:16.620
and that calculation is 343 schools.

01:45:16.620 --> 01:45:20.100
You can see on the second full bullet on this slide.

01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:23.300
That was, again, for 2009.

01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:25.500
Yeah, so the high schools that are identified

01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:29.620
are in addition to, I mean, they're sitting over there

01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.460
as a separate group.

01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:33.900
Correct, they're sort of skimmed off the top.

01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:34.740
That's how I would put it.

01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:35.940
You skim them off the top,

01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:38.820
and then you have a shrunken pool

01:45:38.820 --> 01:45:42.380
that you start with for the 5%.

01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:45.940
Gotcha, and those high schools come from

01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.500
not only Title I high schools,

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:49.260
but any high schools in the state?

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.700
Correct, any high school in the state

01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:54.580
that has a graduation rate lower than 68%,

01:45:54.580 --> 01:45:57.220
regardless of funding status, would be identified.

01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:00.340
So I just wanted to be sure everybody

01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.700
kind of understood what we're going for.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.340
And if I understood you correctly,

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:06.420
you think that probably when we do the,

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.380
this is based on simulations,

01:46:08.380 --> 01:46:10.900
but when we do the analysis,

01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:13.260
it may very well be that we only use

01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.740
criteria one and two.

01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:18.980
Yes, I mean, I can't predict the data.

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:23.060
I gave up on that after we had the first year of COVID,

01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:28.060
but it does seem like because we were so close in 2019,

01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:30.260
that we will probably get to that

01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:31.660
with the first two criteria.

01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.900
And then my last question, which could lead us,

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.580
I don't wanna go too far into discussion

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.020
because we wanna get public comment,

01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:42.140
but if we did have to go to criteria three,

01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:44.780
are we anticipating any way of

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:50.900
slicing that so that we don't have to add another,

01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:55.900
whatever, 200, 300 schools, 400 schools to the mix?

01:46:58.260 --> 01:47:00.780
Yes, so I've changed the slide.

01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:04.500
So I've gone back to that simulation that we did.

01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:08.860
And we did add in what, roughly 150 more schools

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:10.820
with the simulation.

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:13.060
We can't stop at 5%.

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.100
We have to apply that metric universally.

01:47:15.100 --> 01:47:17.380
That was one of the conditions that we negotiated

01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:19.780
with the U.S. Department of Education.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.340
Actually, in person, I was there in Washington, D.C.

01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:23.700
several years back.

01:47:23.700 --> 01:47:27.460
So it is unfortunate because it does bring us up

01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:30.420
well over the 5% based on these simulations.

01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:35.060
But you can see there that I think we feel pretty confident

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.380
about the criteria one and two

01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.020
may be the only ones we need to apply

01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:41.460
so we can get closer to that 5% of schools.

01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:43.540
Okay, thank you.

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.980
I don't want to belabor that now.

01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:48.220
Are there any other clarification questions?

01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:53.100
I am not seeing any hands coming up.

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:56.260
So with that, we want to encourage folks

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.860
to queue up for public comment.

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:02.940
We are going to ask our liaisons

01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:06.060
for any comment they want to make.

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:08.180
Then we're gonna take a few minutes break

01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:11.420
because there's a technology concern

01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:14.260
for getting the public comment line open.

01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:17.900
So you'll have a moment to get a quick cup of coffee

01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.820
or whatever, and then we'll come back.

01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:22.420
So just to give you a little foreshadowing.

01:48:22.420 --> 01:48:24.660
And well, if you are interested

01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.060
in providing comment on this item,

01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:28.900
you can call the telephone number

01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:31.980
and use the access code shown on this slide.

01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:36.260
And your comments will be limited to one minute.

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:38.620
We want to remind you when you do call in

01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:41.020
to turn down the volume of your computer

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.620
on the live webcast to avoid background echoes.

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:49.620
And so with that, I'm going to ask our liaison,

01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:51.500
Vice President Glover-Woods,

01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:52.820
if she'd like to make a comment,

01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:53.820
and then I will make one,

01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.820
and then we will take a little break.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.260
Thank you very much.

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:00.420
Just a couple of very brief comments.

01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:03.980
But first, just expression of gratitude

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:08.540
to Cindy, Joe, and the CDE staff for working with this.

01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.820
Again, not simple at all as we try to ensure

01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:15.300
that our accountability system continues to be reflective

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:19.860
of what was needed in the midst of all of the changes

01:49:19.860 --> 01:49:20.700
that have happened.

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.700
So thank you so very much for all of the work

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.500
and the timeless hours that have gone into sharing

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:29.420
what you've shared with us in this item today.

01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:31.580
Just a couple of points I'd like to make

01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.260
before we move forward.

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:36.100
And one is just to underscore how important it is

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:40.420
that we do indeed restart our accountability system

01:49:40.420 --> 01:49:43.020
to ensure that all of our LEA schools and students

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:45.820
are receiving the support that they need.

01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:49.260
In that same vein, it's also important that our restart

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:52.140
respond to what we know has taken place

01:49:52.140 --> 01:49:56.700
in our assessment actions over the last couple of years.

01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:59.540
So the communication toolkit

01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:02.860
that was referenced a little earlier in the presentation

01:50:03.380 --> 01:50:04.900
is going to be very, very key

01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:07.660
so that our community understands

01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:11.140
how we're reflecting the data as a result

01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:14.860
of not using our performance level colors

01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:17.220
and really reflecting the status change

01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.820
in the upcoming dashboard,

01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:24.220
as well as providing the support that LEAs will need

01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.140
to communicate this information

01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:28.380
to not only their governing boards,

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:31.820
but their communities and families as well.

01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:34.700
So thank you for that and looking forward

01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:36.580
to just ongoing work to make sure

01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:39.020
that things are crystal clear

01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:40.780
and that as we move forward

01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:44.460
with representing the status only information

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:47.340
on the dashboard, that it's done in such a way.

01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:50.140
Of course, that does not confuse people

01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:54.180
with the way we've represented our performance level colors

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:58.900
when we do indeed have data with status and change.

01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:02.260
The other couple of points that I wanted to bring forward

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:05.420
is that very excited and encouraged

01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:07.820
by the future plans and next steps

01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:10.380
that Cindy outlined in the presentation.

01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:13.380
I think it will just help for us to enhance the support

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:14.700
that we provide to students

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.500
by enhancing the level of data that we will receive.

01:51:18.500 --> 01:51:21.620
And just to continue to underscore how important it is

01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:25.340
to be in collaboration with our educational partners

01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.860
in the development of those next steps.

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:33.780
The pursuant of the waiver for the DOS schools

01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.820
is critical, again, not to rehash,

01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:38.940
but we've already heard the support that is there,

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:41.140
knowing that the methodology that was developed

01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:43.940
for our DOS schools was done so thoughtfully

01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:47.340
to be reflective of what we feel was necessary

01:51:47.340 --> 01:51:50.060
in reflecting the data for students in California

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:51.820
that attend those schools.

01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:55.380
And so just quite excited that we will continue

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:57.260
to pursue a waiver for that,

01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.660
as well as the other flexibilities

01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:04.660
that will be outlined in our 21-22 addendum.

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:08.180
So again, just in closing of my comments,

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:10.380
President Darley Hammond and members,

01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:13.980
fellow members of the Board, a restart is critical,

01:52:13.980 --> 01:52:17.380
and it's time for us to continue to move forward

01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:20.140
with this robust accountability system

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:23.580
to be sure that our schools receive the supports

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.860
that they need.

01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:29.020
Also as critical in the restart is how we restart

01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:32.980
to be sure that our LEAs have the data necessary

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:37.380
to make the plans that will be so critical

01:52:37.380 --> 01:52:39.820
in supporting our students moving forward.

01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:41.860
So thank you very much, President Darley Hammond,

01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:44.140
for a moment just to speak to this item.

01:52:45.180 --> 01:52:47.980
Thank you, and I'll just add on a couple of thoughts.

01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:52.100
Again, I wanna underscore how much work is going on

01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:55.060
by the members of our leadership

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.260
in the State Department of Education

01:52:57.260 --> 01:52:59.700
and the previous Board and this Board

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:02.500
in building this accountability system

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:06.740
to really represent more indicators of how kids are doing

01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:09.460
and what kinds of support they're getting.

01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:14.460
And that is a really important foundation

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:18.500
for what we will want to be doing next.

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:23.540
The momentary need to identify schools

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:27.380
only on the basis of status is,

01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:31.100
as you all no doubt know, really at odds

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:32.580
with the philosophy and the approach

01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:34.660
that the Board has adopted in California,

01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:39.660
which is that school employees are always trying to,

01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.780
whatever students come to school with,

01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:45.260
enable them to make substantial progress.

01:53:45.260 --> 01:53:47.500
The recognition of that progress has been

01:53:47.500 --> 01:53:49.860
at the core of California's effort, by the way.

01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:52.300
We were one of the first states to do that.

01:53:52.300 --> 01:53:57.300
Other states have since taken a page from our books,

01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:02.340
so we have discussed the fact that the frame in California

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.980
now is not one of shame and blame

01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:09.380
or pointing fingers at schools

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.740
that are serving high-need students

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:14.500
in an era of high need,

01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.860
that this really is about support and improvement

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.300
about getting resources from the SIG grants

01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.740
to the schools that demonstrate the greatest needs

01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:27.300
and to do that in a way that acknowledges

01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:29.860
the efforts that educators have been making

01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:32.860
all across the state to meet the needs of their students

01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:34.860
and to meet the needs of the times.

01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:38.100
And I know that my colleagues

01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:40.020
in the Department of Education

01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.980
completely agree with that framing,

01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:45.420
and that is how the framing will be communicated

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:48.420
to the field when those identifications are made.

01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:50.660
It is important in some respects

01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:55.140
to try to get that 5% line

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:57.540
that is required by the federal government

01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.300
as close as possible to that number

01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:02.420
so that we are giving as much support as we can

01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:04.660
to schools to make it practicable

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:09.660
for them to do some really thoughtful improvement steps

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:12.900
in the next coming years.

01:55:12.900 --> 01:55:16.980
So the final point that Vice President Glover Woods

01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:20.220
has made is that this is a moment not only to restart,

01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:21.860
but also to rethink.

01:55:21.860 --> 01:55:26.860
The Department of Education has issued some guidance,

01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:30.500
which invites states to think about

01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:35.500
how to configure indicators in their accountability systems

01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:38.420
that take account of opportunity to learn

01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:40.380
about what kids are experiencing

01:55:40.380 --> 01:55:43.300
as well as how they're doing on multiple measures.

01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.860
We've already gone further down that path

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:47.780
than many other states,

01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:51.380
but we will want to take advantage of that invitation

01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:55.140
to think together with our leadership in the department

01:55:55.140 --> 01:56:00.140
about where does California wanna be in the next decade,

01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.820
having built on what we started a decade ago.

01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:07.500
So with that, I'm told that the folks have called in

01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:10.580
for public comment, can stay on the line,

01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.660
but there is a need for a brief break

01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:16.540
because of a technology need to establish

01:56:16.540 --> 01:56:19.620
the call in line in the right way.

01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:22.140
And now I have said everything that I understand,

01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:24.740
I'm at the edge of my technological competence.

01:56:24.740 --> 01:56:28.100
So we're gonna take a break for about five minutes.

01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:32.900
It is 1109, let's try to be back at 11, let's say 15.

01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.780
We'll give ourselves six minutes

01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:37.500
for that technology need to be met.

01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.980
And we'll see you then, do not leave the meeting,

01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:43.820
just turn off your video and your microphone.

01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:05.620
Thank you.

01:57:34.780 --> 01:57:35.620
Thank you.

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:05.620
Thank you.

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:35.620
Thank you.

01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:05.620
Thank you.

01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:35.620
Thank you.

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:05.620
Thank you.

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:35.620
Thank you.

02:01:04.780 --> 02:01:05.620
Thank you.

02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:35.620
Thank you.

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:05.620
Thank you.

02:02:34.780 --> 02:02:35.620
Thank you.

02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:05.620
Thank you.

02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:35.620
Thank you.

02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.620
Thank you.

02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:06.460
Thank you.

02:04:07.460 --> 02:04:08.280
Thank you.

02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:34.660
All right.

02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.820
Thank you.

02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.780
We are now looking for public comments.

02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:41.060
I understand there are callers in the queue.

02:04:41.060 --> 02:04:42.340
Linda, just before we do that,

02:04:42.340 --> 02:04:44.340
would you like me to reestablish our quorum?

02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:45.640
Yes, please do that.

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.140
Sorry, I know we're a little bit out of order today

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:48.060
with our technologies.

02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:48.900
Yeah.

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:50.580
Member Rodriguez.

Member Lewis.

02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:09.120
Present.

02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:10.620
Vice President Glover-Woods.

Here.

02:05:22.340 --> 02:05:23.180
Member Quorum.

02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:29.060
All right, we're ready for public comment.

02:05:29.060 --> 02:05:31.980
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:05:31.980 --> 02:05:34.620
Remember to turn down the speaker volume of your computer

02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.820
if you're following the live feed.

02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:38.820
Speakers are limited to one minute each.

02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:42.780
Okay, it looks like we have 12 people signed up

02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:44.220
in the queue for public comment.

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:47.660
Again, this is for public comment for item number four.

02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:49.220
I will open the phone line down.

02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.660
Good morning, State Board of Education.

02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:54.780
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:55.620
You have one minute.

02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:56.700
Your time starts now.

02:05:59.940 --> 02:06:02.820
Hello, this is Shilpa Ram from Public Advocates.

02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:05.260
We have two requests of the state board relative

02:06:05.260 --> 02:06:07.500
to the Priority 1 teacher quality indicator.

02:06:08.020 --> 02:06:10.820
First public advocates ask that the state board direct

02:06:10.820 --> 02:06:14.100
CBE to include a more robust Priority 1 indicator

02:06:14.100 --> 02:06:15.660
in the dashboard work plan.

02:06:15.660 --> 02:06:18.420
To align with Ed Code that more robust indicator needs

02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.740
to be based on teachers who are both fully credentialed

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:23.300
and properly assigned and not only on the relatively

02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:26.260
few teachers who are misassigned as Item 7 had proposed.

02:06:26.260 --> 02:06:28.740
The agenda item in today's presentation did not

02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:30.340
include the need to make the Priority 1

02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:32.780
indicator more robust and it's important that that happens.

02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:35.220
Second we appreciate the proposal in today's

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.380
presentation to include educational partners

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:39.540
in the work to establish objective criteria

02:06:39.540 --> 02:06:41.780
for Priority 1 and conclude the work next year.

02:06:41.780 --> 02:06:44.100
Thank you for ensuring that the dashboard work plan

02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:45.820
include a stronger commitment to full

02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:47.180
implementation of Priority 1.

02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:49.300
Thank you.

02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:53.060
Good morning State Board of Education.

02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:54.940
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.020
Your time starts now.

02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:01.060
This is Suzanne Cooey of the Charter School

02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:01.820
Development Center.

02:07:01.860 --> 02:07:02.860
Good morning board members.

02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:05.900
CSCC strongly encourages the state board

02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:08.120
to aggressively pursue the preservation

02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:11.500
of modified metrics for DAS schools to fairly

02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.420
and appropriately evaluate a DAS school's impact

02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:16.780
on their students as Attachment 3 states.

02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:20.260
Fair and appropriate evaluation of schools impact

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.140
on students should be a primary focus of our data

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.460
and accountability system.

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:27.220
But we have multiple issues at the school level.

02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:30.940
In addition to DAS methods the federal department

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:33.540
rejected the CDE's formulas for the English

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.740
Learner Progress Indicator and the CDE's

02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:37.220
participation rate penalty.

02:07:37.900 --> 02:07:40.980
The CDE version more accurately reflected

02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:42.060
student performance.

02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:45.380
The new federal participation rate penalty

02:07:45.380 --> 02:07:48.980
will tank the academic indicators for example

02:07:48.980 --> 02:07:51.020
when small student groups are affected.

02:07:51.780 --> 02:07:53.780
The state does not have to use the federal

02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:57.460
version for the state's purposes including charter.

02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:59.140
Will time is up.

02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:02.100
In fall 2023 it will be more than shame and blame.

02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:05.220
It will mean school closure based on imperfect data.

02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:07.220
So I hope we can address that. Thanks so much.

02:08:07.220 --> 02:08:08.220
Thank you so much.

02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:14.900
Good morning State Board of Education.

02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:17.020
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:08:17.020 --> 02:08:18.220
Your time starts now.

02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:24.060
Hi my name is Shay Fairchild and I've been

02:08:24.060 --> 02:08:26.020
a teacher for the past 16 years with my current

02:08:26.020 --> 02:08:28.100
assignment as a teacher on special assignments

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:32.060
to implement and train TK-12 teachers in science.

02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:34.500
Additionally I just completed my four year

02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:36.340
term as a member of the Instructional Quality

02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:38.460
Commission an experience that has profoundly

02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:39.900
changed my educational career.

02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:42.980
Through that experience I have learned that we are partners.

02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:46.620
CDE State Board of Ed and districts.

02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:50.980
And without your support we cannot do our job

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:53.100
with full fidelity. Let me explain the issue.

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:55.820
In my district I have been given 30 minutes

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:57.700
with elementary school teachers and approximately

02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:00.100
11 release days for secondary teachers

02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:02.100
in the past four years pre-pandemic.

02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:05.140
For the implementation and the instructional

02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:08.940
shifts required for the change in NDSS

02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:11.420
and for many districts we are further ahead.

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:14.020
This is where you guys come in and the voice

02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:15.620
for equity and access.

02:09:15.620 --> 02:09:19.140
Our students in the state of California.

02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:20.740
Thank you Coller your time is up.

02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:23.460
Thank you Coller.

02:09:25.580 --> 02:09:27.100
Good morning State Board of Education.

02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:28.900
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:30.020
Your time starts now.

02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:33.460
Good morning Dr.

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:34.860
Darla Hammond and board members.

02:09:34.860 --> 02:09:36.660
Diana Vu on behalf of the Association

02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:38.020
of California School Administrators.

02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.820
Access concern that a dashboard that's

02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.940
limited to only status will display an incomplete

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:44.340
picture of the performance of LEAs in each indicator.

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:46.460
Commit to the lack of change in performance

02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:47.340
level colors.

02:09:47.340 --> 02:09:48.460
Acts request the following.

02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:51.100
One annotation on this 2022 dashboard

02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.940
acknowledges that COVID-19 pandemic abruptly

02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:55.020
disrupted education.

02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.300
The narrative should also include should also explain

02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.620
why the dashboard is only displaying STAB support.

02:09:59.620 --> 02:10:02.540
Two the CDE's communication plan and toolkit for LEAs

02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:05.180
include helping explain the anomalies captured

02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:08.260
within the 2022 dashboard to parents and the community.

02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:10.860
Three a narrative text box accompanying each state

02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:13.740
indicator that enables LEAs to narrate their unique

02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.780
challenges and gain gains during this unprecedented time.

02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:19.380
Lastly access strongly supports a waiver request

02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:21.420
to the U.S. upon education to continue the use

02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:24.140
of alternative metrics within our state county

02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:26.340
systems for DAS schools. Thank you.

02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:27.340
Thank you.

02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:30.620
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:10:30.620 --> 02:10:31.780
for the record. You have one minute.

02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:32.780
Your time starts now.

02:10:36.500 --> 02:10:38.220
Good morning. This is Katina Salazar

02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:39.620
with California's Together.

02:10:39.620 --> 02:10:41.940
We would like to highlight the need to revisit

02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:44.500
the definition of English learners for the academic

02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:48.380
indicators by defining the EL subgroup as current EL

02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.580
only to make visible the need to address

02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:54.980
students in their classrooms now and in the LCAP.

02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:58.060
Using the data files to file a department

02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:01.380
with the current status criteria only 98 schools

02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:03.460
would be identified by the EL subgroup.

02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:05.940
This is less than 10 percent of all the schools

02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:08.580
in California with 30 or more English learners.

02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:12.540
Although not part of the federal addendum only 2 to 6

02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:16.180
would be identified by the differentiated assistance

02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.580
for the English learner subgroup.

02:11:18.220 --> 02:11:20.500
This is not a new issue as we have thought this up

02:11:20.500 --> 02:11:22.700
in the past few years but would really

02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:24.740
appreciate your consideration. Thank you.

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:25.740
Thank you.

02:11:27.340 --> 02:11:29.340
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:30.860
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:36.220
Good morning and welcome new board members.

02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:37.700
My name is Jessica Sacco.

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.860
I'm calling in on behalf of Children Now.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.820
Since districts focus on dashboard indicators

02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:44.860
we encourage that the board start to add science

02:11:44.860 --> 02:11:46.980
to the dashboard starting with reporting performance

02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:50.260
in 2023 and then adopt a 5 by 5 color matrix

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.580
in 2024.

02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.460
Furthermore we encourage the board to start now

02:11:53.460 --> 02:11:55.380
to model ways to incorporate the growth model

02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:57.420
into the dashboard because we believe it is the single

02:11:57.420 --> 02:11:58.740
best measure of school quality.

02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:00.900
We support seeking the federal waiver

02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:02.820
for alternative schools and think that additional

02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.620
work is needed to strengthen accountability

02:12:04.620 --> 02:12:05.940
for these schools.

02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:08.620
For the 2022 dashboard please allow easy access

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:10.660
to the full scope of teacher data available

02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.460
including teacher assignment ineffective

02:12:12.460 --> 02:12:15.140
and out of field teachers broken down by student group.

02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:18.380
And finally specifics are included in the LCFF

02:12:18.420 --> 02:12:20.660
equity coalition and Alliance for Student Success

02:12:20.660 --> 02:12:22.300
letters on all of these topics and more.

02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:23.900
Thank you. Thank you.

02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:26.460
Next caller please state your name

02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:28.620
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.060
Good morning Dr.

02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:34.300
Darling-Hammond and members.

02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:37.700
This is Derek Lennox on behalf of the California County

02:12:37.700 --> 02:12:40.180
Superintendents Educational Services Association.

02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:43.420
We support the CDE's proposal to pursue a waiver

02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:45.620
to allow California to maintain dashboard

02:12:45.660 --> 02:12:49.060
alternative school status modified methods business

02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:51.980
rules as DAS school serves some of California's

02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:53.820
most vulnerable and transient students.

02:12:53.820 --> 02:12:55.780
We are concerned that the changes to the current

02:12:55.780 --> 02:12:59.020
modified methods could portray an inaccurate picture

02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:03.500
of our DAS school students outcomes as well as result

02:13:03.500 --> 02:13:05.340
in an over identification of DAS schools

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:08.180
for comprehensive support and improvement.

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:11.020
So we applaud and thank the CDE and state board

02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:12.700
for your ongoing commitment to equity

02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.540
and for ensuring that each of our six million

02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:16.620
students are fairly represented in our

02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:19.380
statewide accountability system. Thank you.

02:13:19.380 --> 02:13:20.380
Thank you.

02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:23.780
Next next caller please state your name

02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:26.140
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:13:29.460 --> 02:13:31.660
I'm Peter Ahern from the California Association

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:32.740
of Science Educators.

02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:34.220
I want to thank President Darling-Hammond

02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:36.780
for reiterating the board's commitment to having

02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:39.220
science on the dashboard at the last SBE meeting.

02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:41.820
We thank CDE for clarifying the conditions

02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:43.700
for putting science on the dashboard.

02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:47.020
CDE points out that NGSS implementation is stalled

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:49.220
and suggested that this might be a reason to delay

02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:50.860
putting science on the dashboard.

02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:52.380
In fact it's the other way around.

02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:53.900
Districts are told to use the dashboard

02:13:53.900 --> 02:13:56.540
to inform their LCAP so when they don't see science

02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:59.500
on the dashboard they don't fund NGSS implementation.

02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:01.660
Science is likely to be on the dashboard

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:04.820
after testing in 2023 given CDE's timeline.

02:14:04.820 --> 02:14:07.500
Districts need to plan for this indicating science

02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:10.580
as a status only indicator or creating a placeholder

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:12.980
indicating that science is coming would do a great

02:14:13.020 --> 02:14:15.660
deal in signaling districts to fund science implementation.

02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:18.180
In addition we also ask the board to please

02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:21.580
support Assembly Bill 2565 author Rubio

02:14:21.580 --> 02:14:24.140
which would finally help fund long-term teacher

02:14:24.140 --> 02:14:26.540
leadership capacity and professional development

02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:27.540
for any.

02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:28.540
Thank you Coller.

02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:30.540
Thank you Coller. Your time is up.

02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:32.140
Next Coller please state your name

02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:34.380
and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:40.380
Good evening members of the State Board of Education.

02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:43.660
This is Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together

02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:45.660
and we support the recommendations

02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.780
in the LCFF Equity Coalition Letter.

02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.700
Specifically for this I am calling to highlight

02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:54.420
our concerns with the low expectations

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.300
that the current LP Cuts course set for districts.

02:14:58.060 --> 02:15:00.020
The current Cuts course would rate districts

02:15:00.020 --> 02:15:03.220
as very high even when over one in three

02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:05.140
of their English learners do not make progress.

02:15:06.340 --> 02:15:08.020
This leaves complaints to see in the system.

02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.180
Moreover based on the 2019 data only 20 school

02:15:12.180 --> 02:15:15.500
districts were identified as very low and rolling

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.740
less than 1 percent of all English learners.

02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.300
In a true equity equity focused system we would want

02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:23.580
expectations to be set based on what we want

02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:26.340
to see in the system not based on the previously

02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:28.020
inequitable outcomes of the past.

02:15:28.860 --> 02:15:30.580
This is why we continue to ask the State Board

02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:32.740
of Education and the department to revisit

02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:35.420
the LP Cuts course and that it be included

02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:37.220
in the DemDem template. Thank you.

02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:38.340
Thank you.

02:15:39.460 --> 02:15:41.460
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.100
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:49.940
Hi my name is Leticia Garcia on behalf

02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:52.380
of the Riverside County Superintendent of Schools.

02:15:52.380 --> 02:15:55.180
We support staff's request to pursue a waiver

02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:58.060
to maintain the DAS modified metrics for calculating

02:15:58.060 --> 02:16:01.380
the academic achievement and graduation rate indicators.

02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:05.100
We believe the DAS program is a balance between high

02:16:05.140 --> 02:16:08.460
accountability for alternative schools and an opportunity

02:16:08.460 --> 02:16:09.460
to be successful.

02:16:09.980 --> 02:16:12.060
This modification is critical because our

02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:14.420
students come to us at various stages

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.780
of their academic career.

02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:18.260
We service our students within the framework

02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:21.260
of MTSS promoting the whole child approach

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:24.460
which means restorative practices ensuring literacy

02:16:24.460 --> 02:16:26.740
financial literacy providing mental health

02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:30.020
supports tackling racism and promoting equity.

02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:33.260
We do not reduce rigor or lower expectations.

02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:36.380
We believe the DAS program is rooted in equity

02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:39.820
and provides real accountability and real equity

02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.540
equitable opportunities for our students.

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:43.420
Thank you.

02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:44.420
Thank you.

02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:47.340
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:49.060
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.780
Good morning President Darling-Hammond

02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:57.260
and members of the board including the new ones.

02:16:57.260 --> 02:17:01.260
Liz Guiana Public Advocates for the LCFF Equity Coalition.

02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:03.380
We support the waiver request to the U.S.

02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:06.540
Department of Education on how California calculates

02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:08.780
academic achievement and graduation rate

02:17:08.780 --> 02:17:10.860
indicators for alternative schools.

02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:13.780
We appreciate the department's transparency

02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:17.140
in sharing their work plan to continuously improve

02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:19.900
our multiple measures accountability system

02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:22.020
but we would like the work plan to clearly

02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:24.420
and publicly include more robust teacher

02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:26.220
indicators for priority one.

02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:28.420
Not just the teacher missed assignments

02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:31.340
but fully credentialed and properly assigned teachers.

02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:34.380
Also the state science test should be included

02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:36.660
in the next dashboard even if it's just

02:17:36.660 --> 02:17:38.300
status only performance.

02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:40.700
We know that what gets measured matters.

02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:43.220
And since status will be the way for all other

02:17:43.220 --> 02:17:45.420
indicators it would not be confusing.

02:17:46.460 --> 02:17:48.100
And finally now that we're submitting

02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:50.260
an ESSA addendum template we think it's a good

02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:52.260
opportunity to refine the definition

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:53.220
of being Gresh learners.

02:17:53.220 --> 02:17:53.820
Thank you caller.

02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.980
Honestly show the school needing support. Thank you.

02:17:56.980 --> 02:17:57.980
Thank you.

02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.100
Next caller please state your name

02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:02.380
and affiliation for the record.

02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:03.380
Your time starts now.

02:18:07.260 --> 02:18:10.260
My name is Kelly Garcia and I am a science

02:18:10.260 --> 02:18:12.340
teacher at Hutchinson Middle School

02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:13.820
in La Mirada California.

02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:16.900
More importantly I'm the grandmother to Hudson

02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:18.780
Glenn Olivia and Miles.

02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.900
All future California public school students.

02:18:21.900 --> 02:18:24.140
I'm here today to strongly urge you to place

02:18:24.140 --> 02:18:27.060
a place science placeholder on this California

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:28.340
school dashboard.

02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:29.940
We learned through the events of the past two

02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:31.980
years that having a scientifically literate

02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:34.380
population is important for our quality of life.

02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:36.740
In addition the fastest growing careers in our

02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.580
state are strongly connected to science

02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:41.380
and technology further emphasizing the necessity

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:43.100
of an effective science education.

02:18:43.100 --> 02:18:45.180
When you consider that girls typically make

02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:47.740
career decisions by the age of 11 and many

02:18:47.740 --> 02:18:49.660
students in our underserved communities often

02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:52.260
don't know anyone who works in STEM field it is

02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:53.860
all too apparent that we must take steps

02:18:53.860 --> 02:18:56.660
to solidify accountability to ensure all

02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:58.860
students are equitably prepared for a future

02:18:58.860 --> 02:18:59.860
workforce.

02:18:59.860 --> 02:19:02.060
As a classroom teacher I'm well aware of the struggles

02:19:02.060 --> 02:19:03.940
that teachers schools and districts have had

02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:05.420
in implementing NGFS.

02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:06.420
Thank you.

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:07.420
Stand long before closing.

02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:08.420
Thank you.

02:19:08.420 --> 02:19:09.420
Thank you.

02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:13.940
Next caller please state your name and affiliation

02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:15.460
for the record. Your time starts now.

02:19:18.900 --> 02:19:19.340
Good morning.

02:19:19.340 --> 02:19:21.620
Colleen Pagter on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified

02:19:21.620 --> 02:19:22.460
School District.

02:19:22.460 --> 02:19:24.620
Los Angeles Unified is concerned that making no

02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:27.340
adjustments to cut points or indicator definitions

02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:29.380
will contribute to an over-identification

02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:32.500
of schools particularly in terms of ATSI.

02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.540
The premise of the accountability system

02:19:34.540 --> 02:19:36.620
is to target supports at high need schools.

02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:38.540
If too many schools are identified it becomes

02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:41.180
difficult to do so and the targeted funds that are intended

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.660
for interventions and supports would be diluted.

02:19:43.660 --> 02:19:46.340
Therefore we recommend that CDE conduct and make

02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:48.540
public a comprehensive analysis to determine

02:19:48.540 --> 02:19:50.580
the likely number of schools that will be identified

02:19:50.580 --> 02:19:53.180
in 2022 especially for ATSI.

02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:56.260
Based on the proposed actions in order to reduce

02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:57.940
the number of schools for targeted support

02:19:57.940 --> 02:19:59.900
we ask that you consider using the available

02:19:59.900 --> 02:20:02.540
federal flexibilities by adjusting the definition

02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:07.420
of chronic absenteeism for 2022 accountability to acknowledge

02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:10.220
the impact of the pandemic and COVID related absences.

02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:13.300
Lastly we ask that CDE include 2019 student group

02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:16.060
performance as a factor for ATSI designations

02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:19.220
since one year status not constitute chronic

02:20:19.220 --> 02:20:20.420
underperformance. Thank you.

02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:21.420
Thank you.

02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:25.620
That concludes public comment for item number four.

02:20:28.220 --> 02:20:29.060
All right.

02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:35.020
Lots to chew on here and I'm sure people have many,

02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:36.820
many thoughts.

02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:40.220
I have a few myself but I'm gonna wait until others

02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:43.220
have a chance to get their questions on the table.

02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:47.620
Yes, member Escobedo.

02:20:47.620 --> 02:20:52.620
Yes, I understand the LPAC cut scores.

02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:57.340
We had rigorous data analysis by researchers

02:20:57.340 --> 02:20:59.420
and people in the field.

02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:02.500
However, I do believe there needs to be an increase

02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.860
of confidence and I just wonder if there's a way

02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:10.500
we can triangulate some scores along with these cut off

02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:15.500
scores what I mean specifically like perhaps we can look

02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:18.860
at the percentage of long-term English learners

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:23.860
and maybe average scale scores and see how they

02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:31.260
are connected to those schools that are either very high

02:21:31.260 --> 02:21:32.820
or in the middle or very low.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:37.820
So you would think that you're very high school

02:21:37.980 --> 02:21:42.900
according to LPAC you would have less number of long-term

02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:45.700
English learners compared to the other levels

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:49.580
as well as probably a higher scale score average.

02:21:49.580 --> 02:21:53.820
So I just wonder if we can look at data and associate data

02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:56.860
and connect data and maybe more coherence

02:21:56.860 --> 02:21:58.660
to create more meaning.

02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:03.260
I would love to see that if that's a possibility

02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.580
in the future of course.

02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:11.380
Is that something you wanna ask Cindy to respond to

02:22:12.140 --> 02:22:12.980
if it's true?

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:14.060
Please, please.

02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:17.660
Hi, this is Cindy Kazanis,

02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:19.340
Director of the Analysis Measurement

02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.300
and Account of the Reporting Division.

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:23.860
So I think the comment that you're bringing up

02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:28.100
are mixing data points that I would need to take back

02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:33.020
to the team and to our policy advisory group.

02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:35.420
It seems to me as well that there's a lot

02:22:35.420 --> 02:22:38.100
of misunderstandings about the purpose of the indicator

02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:40.540
and what it's designed to do.

02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:43.300
And so I would like President Darling-Hammond

02:22:43.300 --> 02:22:46.860
if we can also touch base with the accountability liaisons

02:22:46.860 --> 02:22:50.980
on next steps so that we can perhaps clear the air

02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:55.180
and make sure that the indicator is working

02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:57.060
as it was designed.

02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:00.020
But also when we think about how we select

02:23:00.020 --> 02:23:02.700
or how districts are identified for support,

02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:05.900
it's not just based on one indicator

02:23:05.900 --> 02:23:09.460
and there is very specific methodology requirements

02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:13.060
that are outlined, the Board adopted those criteria.

02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:15.620
And so I think there's a lot more at this

02:23:17.540 --> 02:23:19.060
as part of this particular issue

02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:23.100
than simply doing a simulation of various data points.

02:23:27.500 --> 02:23:29.980
Are there other comments or questions?

02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:36.020
Well, I have my little, oh, there, Member Rodriguez.

02:23:36.020 --> 02:23:37.260
Okay, thank you.

02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:40.460
And so we're addressing all of the issues

02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:43.100
that were brought up, right, Craig, in our comments?

02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:46.140
Yeah, any issues at this point, this is the time to do it.

02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:47.740
All right, wonderful.

02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:52.300
So with regard to the Doss School Waiver,

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:55.220
I just want to say that I'm in full support of it

02:23:55.220 --> 02:23:59.260
because I understand what our students are,

02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:03.620
especially our foster students who are in Doss schools,

02:24:03.620 --> 02:24:05.380
the support that they need.

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:10.500
And I have a lot of firsthand accounts with those students.

02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:16.540
And so I just wouldn't want to make the,

02:24:22.660 --> 02:24:24.060
I'm sorry, I'm really sick

02:24:24.060 --> 02:24:25.420
and so I'm having a hard time

02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:27.700
getting my thoughts together here.

02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:32.220
But I'm in favor of the waiver and the calls

02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:35.220
and the letters that we received for all of those reasons.

02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:40.540
Second, I think that with regard to the cut scores,

02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:42.460
we have a great opportunity here.

02:24:42.460 --> 02:24:47.060
One of my observations during distance learning

02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:50.420
is that my students who really struggled

02:24:50.420 --> 02:24:53.300
were those who were extrinsically motivated

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:57.020
or those who depended a lot on direction

02:24:57.020 --> 02:25:02.020
and just constant monitoring

02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:05.780
as opposed to the internal motivation

02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:09.100
that as teachers, we want our students to have.

02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.660
And so I think to look at the scores,

02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:13.540
to look at where we are now

02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:18.540
is a snapshot of how we can move forward

02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:22.660
and take our students to really focus

02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:25.380
on internal motivation and a love of learning

02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:28.340
that they can carry on to their future studies.

02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:33.380
And in the event that we have to face something

02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.100
like this again, that our students are prepared,

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:38.220
that they have the skills that they need.

02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:41.740
So looking at the snapshot now is the way it is,

02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:43.540
I think is really good information

02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:46.140
for all of us here in the state.

02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:51.060
I'm also concerned about science

02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.900
because I really, as the caller said,

02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:57.860
what's measured is what's valued

02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:03.420
and as districts are looking at their planning for funding,

02:26:05.740 --> 02:26:08.980
if we don't have any science representation on there,

02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:11.580
it'll be hard to make determinations for the future.

02:26:12.620 --> 02:26:13.460
Thank you.

02:26:16.020 --> 02:26:17.460
Thank you.

02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:20.580
Are there other questions or comments?

02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:25.940
I'd like to pick up on the last point

02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:28.820
that member Rodriguez made and then member Glover-Woods,

02:26:28.820 --> 02:26:31.260
I'll come straight to you, I saw your hand go up.

02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:35.580
Not electronically, the old fashioned way.

02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.460
On the question of science, I would like to ask,

02:26:39.460 --> 02:26:41.020
I came up from several callers

02:26:41.020 --> 02:26:42.260
and it's an interesting point

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:45.420
that we are reporting only status this year.

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:49.340
Is there a reason why we could not report status results

02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:51.020
for science in 2022?

02:26:53.260 --> 02:26:55.700
Is that your question too, member Glover-Woods?

02:26:56.580 --> 02:27:01.580
Member Darling-Hammond, so we will get the first test results

02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:05.860
of this data based on the new blueprint this fall

02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:10.260
and for us to turn around something of a new test,

02:27:10.260 --> 02:27:14.100
I don't think it's feasible,

02:27:14.100 --> 02:27:15.660
but I will take it back to the team.

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.460
We will have the conversation to make sure

02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:21.260
that we can rule out any pieces of it,

02:27:21.260 --> 02:27:24.260
but in order to put it out for informational purposes,

02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:26.420
because bringing it on for status

02:27:26.420 --> 02:27:28.540
and determining that it's an indicator,

02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:30.260
you're gonna need to have further discussions

02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:33.180
about how you weight those academic indicators.

02:27:33.180 --> 02:27:38.020
And so it's not just simply putting information on

02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:39.340
and saying there's a status level,

02:27:39.340 --> 02:27:41.620
it's also saying how do you value it

02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:44.020
in place of all of the other indicators

02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:46.620
because it's a very careful balance of academic

02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:48.820
versus non-academic indicators

02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:50.380
on the dashboard at this point.

02:27:51.300 --> 02:27:53.820
Yeah, so that is something that the department

02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:55.700
is inviting states to reconsider

02:27:55.700 --> 02:28:00.700
because the law does not include some of the constraints

02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:04.220
that were in the decision earlier.

02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:08.660
But I guess the companion question might be

02:28:08.660 --> 02:28:11.260
whether we could display it on the dashboard

02:28:11.260 --> 02:28:15.820
for informational purposes without taking into account

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.420
its use in accountability,

02:28:17.420 --> 02:28:18.620
which we wouldn't want to do

02:28:18.620 --> 02:28:20.420
until the following year anyway,

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:22.660
so to use it for informational purposes.

02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:26.060
And I'm happy to bring that to you back

02:28:26.060 --> 02:28:30.340
as an action item later on this year.

02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:31.260
Thank you.

02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:33.820
Member Glover-Woods, you are raising your hand.

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:36.540
President and Darlene Hammond,

02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:39.700
you asked the question that I was going to ask

02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:42.980
and I've received the response, thank you very much.

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.380
Thank you.

02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:45.860
I have a couple of others,

02:28:45.860 --> 02:28:48.140
but I want to just be checking

02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:51.180
to make sure nobody else has some questions.

02:28:52.060 --> 02:28:54.220
A second point that was made by a caller

02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:56.940
that I thought was a useful one,

02:28:56.940 --> 02:28:59.500
and you may already have this in mind to do,

02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:03.380
but I just wanted to raise it was that the question

02:29:03.380 --> 02:29:06.580
came up about in a toolkit for LEAs,

02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:08.380
finding a way to help them explain

02:29:08.380 --> 02:29:11.300
all of the anomalous results because it is complicated

02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:13.420
and we're in our own learning mode

02:29:13.420 --> 02:29:16.180
and every school board in the state

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:17.980
will have its own learning mode.

02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:21.540
So I just wanted to let you respond to that question.

02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:23.460
Yes, absolutely.

02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:27.060
So we did include a slide on a communications toolkit.

02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:30.500
It was an idea we definitely took from one of the letters

02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:33.460
and is something that we have done in years past.

02:29:33.460 --> 02:29:34.500
We've worked very closely

02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:37.740
with State Board of Education staff, excuse me,

02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:39.580
who have just a really keen insight

02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:43.220
on talking about these very meaty things

02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:47.180
in a very basic manner so that the public can understand

02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:49.780
and it's not meant for just a bunch of data

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:51.420
and accountability geeks.

02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:55.020
So in that term, we will definitely be spending

02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:56.500
the next several months if not

02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:57.860
until we release the dashboard,

02:29:57.860 --> 02:29:59.660
up until we release the dashboard

02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:01.660
on how to help with messaging

02:30:01.660 --> 02:30:05.140
and talking about this restarting of accountability

02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:08.860
and what it means and how districts and schools

02:30:08.860 --> 02:30:10.500
who are identified for support

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:15.500
are actually supported in our system of support,

02:30:15.540 --> 02:30:18.180
which is, of course, very unique in California.

02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:22.740
And I know that our partners at CCE

02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:24.780
and the county offices have been very eager

02:30:24.780 --> 02:30:27.180
to get this new set of data

02:30:27.180 --> 02:30:28.980
and start working with schools

02:30:28.980 --> 02:30:30.660
based on current information.

02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:34.060
Yeah, I truly appreciate that.

02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:37.100
And I think the way you are stating it

02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:39.540
is very important that this really is about

02:30:40.700 --> 02:30:43.460
organizing support, so that's terrific.

02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:48.220
One other question that came up from a caller was

02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:52.020
whether in order to, if we did get to the point

02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:55.060
where criteria one and two were not sufficient

02:30:55.060 --> 02:30:59.940
to identify 5% of Title I schools,

02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:04.940
whether we might not look in a global way,

02:31:05.260 --> 02:31:10.260
but for example, use the delete the chronic absenteeism

02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:13.500
indicator or otherwise use the flexibilities

02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:17.900
that have been indicated that the department

02:31:17.900 --> 02:31:22.900
might be willing to have around the selection process

02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:26.260
rather than the version that we had approved

02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:27.500
over many years ago.

02:31:27.500 --> 02:31:30.740
Just wanted your thoughts and comments on that,

02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:32.740
on that kind of more refined approach

02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.820
if we have to go to a third criterion.

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:37.540
Yeah, so I guess, let me tease it out

02:31:37.540 --> 02:31:39.780
because I don't see the third criteria

02:31:39.820 --> 02:31:44.020
as being connected to the chronic absenteeism statement.

02:31:44.020 --> 02:31:45.420
The chronic absenteeism statement

02:31:45.420 --> 02:31:47.700
is they want us to reset cut scores

02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:51.820
so that it's not over identifying schools.

02:31:51.820 --> 02:31:54.020
And if you recall the criteria.

02:31:54.020 --> 02:31:57.100
Or not using it in the calculation

02:31:57.100 --> 02:31:58.580
was what I thought I was hearing,

02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:00.420
but to your point, yes.

02:32:02.300 --> 02:32:04.340
Yes, so I mean, at this point, I mean,

02:32:04.340 --> 02:32:08.780
that we are recommending that you use all indicators

02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:10.860
at the college career indicator.

02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.260
I do have to point out that one indicator

02:32:14.260 --> 02:32:17.700
will not get you identified assuming

02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:22.700
that you have sufficient end sizes for the other indicators.

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:26.100
So it would be extremely unusual

02:32:26.100 --> 02:32:29.420
that just by having read on chronic absenteeism

02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.700
that you would be automatically,

02:32:30.700 --> 02:32:32.860
and you'd have to have low performance

02:32:32.860 --> 02:32:36.020
on your ELA and math assessments.

02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:37.420
You'd have to have low performance,

02:32:37.420 --> 02:32:41.100
for example, on your English learner progress indicator

02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:43.420
status on graduation rate.

02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:46.100
And so it's not a one and done.

02:32:46.100 --> 02:32:50.100
This is a multi-measures system for a reason.

02:32:50.100 --> 02:32:54.620
And in doing that, it's very hard to predict.

02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:55.580
I'm not going to predict.

02:32:55.580 --> 02:33:00.380
I said that earlier on what these data will look like

02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:02.700
come fall of 2022.

02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:04.340
We know the field is hurting

02:33:04.340 --> 02:33:06.420
especially on chronic absenteeism.

02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:10.100
But I would also just mention that if you are identified

02:33:10.100 --> 02:33:12.980
as a school for comprehensive support and improvement,

02:33:12.980 --> 02:33:14.580
you get money from the state.

02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:16.340
The state actually gives you funding

02:33:16.340 --> 02:33:18.100
to help support you in this effort.

02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:20.540
That is unusual in our system of support

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:22.260
the way it's designed these days.

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:27.260
So just a point of clarification on the eligibility process,

02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:30.700
identification, and then I think it's very difficult

02:33:30.700 --> 02:33:32.140
for us to do a bunch of what ifs.

02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:34.780
But at this point, we are recommending you stick

02:33:34.780 --> 02:33:37.500
with the indicators that we've recommended

02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:39.660
and with the cut scores as is.

02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:44.500
I think the concern will be if we,

02:33:44.500 --> 02:33:46.580
we understand you don't want to predict

02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:51.060
and we want to have confidence.

02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:53.300
I think I have a fair amount of confidence

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:56.500
in your probability statement

02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.820
that we would probably identify a sufficient number

02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:03.300
of schools with criteria one and two.

02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:08.900
We will want to avoid having to identify

02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:11.780
as many as seven or 8% of schools if we can.

02:34:11.780 --> 02:34:15.580
So if we get to that, if we have to cross that bridge,

02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:19.460
we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:24.460
The last question that I have is on the priority one,

02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:28.580
the full representation of priority one

02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:30.620
in the dashboard work plan,

02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:32.180
which would include the percentage

02:34:32.180 --> 02:34:34.220
of fully certified teachers,

02:34:34.220 --> 02:34:37.580
including those who are not properly assigned

02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:41.980
and those who are misassigned as a proportion of the total.

02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.940
And is there any reason we cannot add that

02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:47.620
to the dashboard work plan?

02:34:48.500 --> 02:34:50.460
So it is part of the dashboard work plan.

02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:52.980
I think folks overlooked the slide.

02:34:52.980 --> 02:34:55.900
Maybe it would be helpful to bring it up on the screen

02:34:57.500 --> 02:35:01.020
in which we commit to, again,

02:35:01.020 --> 02:35:03.260
convening an ad hoc advisory group,

02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:06.300
reporting that would provide feedback

02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:07.300
on the reporting of the data,

02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:09.180
including a review of the data elements.

02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:12.140
So what I have taken from the comments

02:35:12.140 --> 02:35:15.580
that were given today, as well as in writing,

02:35:15.580 --> 02:35:16.780
is that there's a disagreement

02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:18.820
about what data elements should be included,

02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:21.980
and so we will spend time to make sure we get that right.

02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:23.300
I think that you know very well,

02:35:23.300 --> 02:35:25.020
because we've been meeting with you on this issue

02:35:25.020 --> 02:35:26.580
for the last two years,

02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:29.660
that these definitions are not clean.

02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:33.460
And we have been spending quite a bit of time.

02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:35.780
This is really the most complex data set

02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:37.220
the department has ever dealt with.

02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:40.460
And so while it's 300,000 teachers,

02:35:40.460 --> 02:35:44.420
you're also combining that with our 6.2 million students

02:35:44.420 --> 02:35:46.860
in the classrooms in which they're being taught.

02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:50.540
And so that, as well as matching it up with data

02:35:50.540 --> 02:35:53.460
that the Commission on Teacher Credentialing is giving us,

02:35:54.340 --> 02:35:58.180
it gives us a headache, but we are working through it.

02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:00.180
And I am confident we're gonna be able

02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:02.340
to get some data out fairly soon.

02:36:02.340 --> 02:36:03.780
But on the data elements piece,

02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:06.220
we will definitely conduct a thorough review

02:36:06.220 --> 02:36:08.020
to make sure that it is aligned

02:36:08.020 --> 02:36:11.580
with the intent of priority one in state law.

02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:14.940
And I'll just reiterate that,

02:36:14.940 --> 02:36:19.700
you know, the statistic that has been reported

02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:23.460
on this assignment is often reported alone,

02:36:23.460 --> 02:36:26.580
but it is, and therefore it's often misunderstood

02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:28.380
and misinterpreted.

02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:31.300
It is the priority one states that

02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:37.700
we should be looking at the fully credentialed teachers

02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:40.980
who are fully credentialed in their subject area

02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:44.420
and the proportion who are misassigned.

02:36:44.420 --> 02:36:47.780
So in order to calculate the percentage who are misassigned,

02:36:47.780 --> 02:36:49.380
that is they're fully credentialed,

02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:52.180
but not properly assigned in their subject area,

02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:54.260
you have to calculate it already,

02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:56.540
the percentage who are fully credentialed.

02:36:57.500 --> 02:36:59.020
So that data element is readily available,

02:36:59.020 --> 02:37:00.740
but it's rarely reported,

02:37:00.740 --> 02:37:03.060
and it leads to a lot of confusion in the field.

02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:08.140
So I will just, you know, assert again

02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:10.780
that that is a data point we have

02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:13.260
because we couldn't calculate misassignment without it.

02:37:13.260 --> 02:37:17.980
And that piece of it, there are more complicated elements,

02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:21.140
which we all know about what having to do with teachers

02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:24.180
who have various other kinds of permits

02:37:24.180 --> 02:37:25.940
or substandard credentials.

02:37:25.940 --> 02:37:28.460
But the element of how many are fully credentialed

02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:31.380
from which we calculate misassignment should be,

02:37:31.380 --> 02:37:32.460
is part of priority one,

02:37:32.460 --> 02:37:36.980
should be part of the work plan for the department.

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:41.980
And with that understanding, we could move,

02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:45.380
see if there's a motion to adopt the recommendation.

02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:51.580
Unless there are any other questions,

02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:53.580
I haven't seen any other hands going up.

02:37:54.100 --> 02:37:57.900
I move to adopt the recommendation.

02:37:57.900 --> 02:37:59.540
All right, do we have a second?

02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:01.540
I second it.

02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:05.740
All right, is there any further discussion?

02:38:07.780 --> 02:38:11.140
Hearing none, Brooks, can you call the roll for the vote?

02:38:11.140 --> 02:38:12.060
Member Rodriguez.

02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:15.860
Yes.

02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:16.980
Member Patilio-Brownson.

02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:19.300
Yes.

02:38:19.300 --> 02:38:20.140
Member McQuillan.

02:38:21.260 --> 02:38:22.500
Aye.

02:38:22.500 --> 02:38:23.900
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

02:38:26.260 --> 02:38:27.740
Yes.

02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:28.580
Member Olken.

02:38:29.460 --> 02:38:30.300
Member Lewis.

02:38:31.700 --> 02:38:32.540
Yes.

02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:34.860
Vice President Glover-Woods.

02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:37.380
Yes.

02:38:37.380 --> 02:38:38.220
Member Escobedo.

02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:40.820
Yes.

02:38:40.820 --> 02:38:42.660
President Darlene Hammond.

02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:43.700
Yes.

02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:44.540
Member Bonacca.

02:38:45.740 --> 02:38:46.580
Aye.

02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:48.500
Motion passes.

02:38:49.740 --> 02:38:51.860
Thank you, and thank you so much,

02:38:51.940 --> 02:38:55.420
Cindy and Joe, for the very thorough presentation

02:38:55.420 --> 02:38:58.620
and all of the work that has gone into

02:38:58.620 --> 02:39:03.620
making this school year able to present data.

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:07.420
There were even questions about that at a moment in time,

02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:13.140
and moving it forward in a way that is well thought through

02:39:13.140 --> 02:39:15.500
and will inform our stakeholders.

02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:16.340
We appreciate it.

02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:19.140
We'll come back around on those other questions

02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:21.500
about science and other things,

02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:27.140
and come back to the Board with those questions on the table.

02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:32.860
So at this point, we're just a few minutes away from noon.

02:39:32.860 --> 02:39:36.340
I think it makes sense for us to break for lunch,

02:39:37.340 --> 02:39:42.340
take 30 minutes, and come back at 12 22

02:39:42.580 --> 02:39:45.940
to resume the rest of the agenda.

02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:50.340
We'll see you then.

02:39:50.340 --> 02:39:51.980
Remember, don't leave the meeting,

02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:53.860
just stop your video and your mic.

02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:18.740
Member Rodriguez.

02:40:19.700 --> 02:40:20.700
Here.

02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:22.860
Member Petillo-Brownson.

02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:23.980
Here.

02:40:23.980 --> 02:40:24.820
Member McQuillan.

02:40:25.900 --> 02:40:27.140
Here.

02:40:27.140 --> 02:40:28.460
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:30.860
Present.

02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:32.420
Member Olken.

02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:33.260
Member Lewis.

02:40:34.740 --> 02:40:35.580
Present.

02:40:35.580 --> 02:40:37.060
Vice President Glover-Woods.

02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:40.060
Here.

02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:41.700
Member Escobedo.

02:40:41.700 --> 02:40:42.540
Here.

02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:44.340
President Darling-Hammond.

02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:45.180
Here.

02:40:45.180 --> 02:40:46.020
Member Bonacca.

02:40:47.780 --> 02:40:48.620
Here.

02:40:49.620 --> 02:40:54.100
All right, we are moving on to item two.

02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:56.020
Item two is the California Assessment

02:40:56.020 --> 02:40:57.700
of Student Performance and Progress

02:40:57.700 --> 02:40:59.700
and the English Language Proficiency Assessments

02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:01.300
for California,

02:41:01.300 --> 02:41:03.740
approval of the revised student score reports

02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:07.300
for both the 2022-23

02:41:07.300 --> 02:41:10.340
initial English Language Proficiency Assessments

02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:11.900
and the initial alternate

02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:14.940
English Language Proficiency Assessments for California,

02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:17.740
and an update on our system program activities.

02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:21.420
And the item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton

02:41:21.420 --> 02:41:23.380
and Mal Vang of the CDE.

02:41:25.140 --> 02:41:27.300
Cheryl and Mal, take it away.

02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:32.940
Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond,

02:41:32.940 --> 02:41:35.780
Vice President Glover-Woods, and Board members.

02:41:35.780 --> 02:41:37.420
I'm Cheryl Cotton, Deputy Superintendent

02:41:37.420 --> 02:41:38.660
of the Instruction, Measurement,

02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:40.740
and Administration branch.

02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:43.820
To assist with this item, I have Dr. Mal Vang,

02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:45.740
Director of the Assessment Development

02:41:45.740 --> 02:41:48.180
and Administration Division to co-present.

02:41:48.180 --> 02:41:51.660
Dr. Linda Hooper, Associate Director

02:41:51.660 --> 02:41:54.460
of Assessment and Administration Division.

02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:57.860
Marion Aracilla, Executive Director

02:41:57.860 --> 02:41:59.800
from Educational Testing Service.

02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:03.180
Tony Alpert, Executive Director,

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:07.020
and Dr. Magna Chia, Chief Strategy Officer

02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:09.420
from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium

02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:12.340
as panelists to assist us with questions.

02:42:12.340 --> 02:42:15.180
The item before you today is an action

02:42:15.180 --> 02:42:16.920
and an information item.

02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:18.740
Next slide.

02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:30.220
Today's presentation will cover the following topics.

02:42:30.220 --> 02:42:31.700
We will provide an overview

02:42:31.700 --> 02:42:33.580
of the California Department of Education's

02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:36.740
CDE recommendation for approval,

02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:38.240
as well as background information

02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:40.460
on the action item for today.

02:42:40.460 --> 02:42:44.800
Then we will go over some CASP and LPAC updates.

02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:48.260
And finally, we will return to the CDE's recommendation

02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:50.100
for SBE item.

02:42:50.100 --> 02:42:52.820
Now we'll hand the presentation over to Dr. Mal Vang,

02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:54.260
Director of Assessment Development

02:42:54.260 --> 02:42:55.660
and Administration Division.

02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:07.300
Thank you.

02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:11.500
Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond,

02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:14.340
Vice President Glover Woods, and board members.

02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:18.100
As Deputy Superintendent Cotton mentioned,

02:43:18.100 --> 02:43:21.060
I'm Mal Vang, Director for the Assessment Development

02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:23.420
and Administration Division.

02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:25.760
In this section, I will provide an overview

02:43:25.760 --> 02:43:28.220
of the California Department of Education's

02:43:28.220 --> 02:43:30.160
recommendation for approval.

02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:36.300
So the California Department of Education recommends

02:43:36.300 --> 02:43:38.580
that the California State Board of Education

02:43:38.580 --> 02:43:41.920
approve the revised initial English language

02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.920
proficiency assessments for California or LPAC

02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:51.260
and the initial alternate LPAC student score reports

02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:56.260
for the 2022-23 test results as found in attachment two.

02:44:02.820 --> 02:44:06.040
In this next section, I will provide background information

02:44:06.040 --> 02:44:07.880
on the action item.

02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.160
In California, our California assessment system overall

02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:22.160
as background information serves all our 6 million

02:44:23.120 --> 02:44:26.720
plus students in kindergarten through grade 12,

02:44:26.720 --> 02:44:31.720
including in that about 1.1 million English learners,

02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:36.440
800,000 students with disabilities,

02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:41.440
and 300,000 educators in about 2,000 local educational

02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:45.620
agencies and about 10,000 schools,

02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:51.820
while administering about 20 million tests annually.

02:44:56.680 --> 02:45:00.520
So the California assessment of student performance

02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:05.560
and progress or CASP here is an umbrella assessment system.

02:45:08.240 --> 02:45:12.200
In 2010, the California State Board of Education

02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:14.440
adopted the Common Core State Standards

02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:19.200
for English Language Arts or ELA here, and mathematics.

02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:21.800
So per state law, California joined

02:45:21.800 --> 02:45:26.400
the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium in June 2011

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.000
as a governing state to work on the development

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:32.080
of English and math assessments.

02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:35.280
The three components of the Smarter Balanced Assessments

02:45:35.280 --> 02:45:37.520
for English Language Arts and Mathematics here

02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:41.840
consists of the summative assessments, interim assessments,

02:45:41.840 --> 02:45:45.480
and formative assessment resources in the Tools

02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.020
for Teachers system to support instruction

02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:51.280
and professional learning throughout the year.

02:45:52.920 --> 02:45:55.040
Also as addressed in state law,

02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:58.840
the CASP or summative assessments include

02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:02.520
the following, as I mentioned,

02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:04.400
the Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments

02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:07.240
for English Language Arts and Mathematics,

02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:09.500
which is administered to students

02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:12.440
in grades three through eight and 11,

02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:14.560
and then the California Science Test,

02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:18.940
or we call the acronym as CAST,

02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:21.720
which is administered to students in grades five, eight,

02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:23.600
and ones in high school.

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:26.680
We also have added science resources

02:46:26.680 --> 02:46:29.820
in the Tools for Teachers for this assessment,

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
to support this assessment.

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.240
And then there is the California Alternate Assessments

02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:39.680
for English Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science.

02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:43.080
This is for students with the most significant

02:46:43.080 --> 02:46:45.320
cognitive disabilities as designated

02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:47.960
in their Individualized Education Plan,

02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:51.640
or IEP program, or IEP, excuse me.

02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:56.000
And then we also have the California Spanish Assessment

02:46:56.040 --> 02:46:58.840
for Spanish Reading Language Arts,

02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.060
which is an optional test administered to students

02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:05.320
in grades three through eight and high school.

02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:08.740
And then we have the grade two Diagnostic Assessments

02:47:08.740 --> 02:47:10.720
for English Language Arts and Mathematics

02:47:10.720 --> 02:47:13.360
for local educational agencies

02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:16.740
that continue to test students in grade two.

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:21.640
Oh, just a minute.

02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:26.440
I wanted to just provide a little quick background

02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:28.160
on the CASP.

02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:33.160
So these CASP summative assessments are computer adapted

02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:37.680
or computer-based tests that measure what students know

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:40.320
and can do in these content areas.

02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:42.760
And they produce scores that can be aggregated

02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:44.500
and disaggregated for the purpose

02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:47.040
of informing parents and guardians,

02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.560
local educational agencies, the public,

02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:52.880
and the state about students' achievement in their learning

02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:55.920
of the California Academic Content Standards.

02:47:55.920 --> 02:47:57.920
So the CASP summative assessments

02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:00.320
also provide individual student results

02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:04.100
to students, parents and guardians, and teachers,

02:48:04.100 --> 02:48:07.980
and produce school, district, and county level results

02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:12.400
that allow for the monitoring of a school progress as well,

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:15.280
and then produce results to meet the requirements

02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:18.640
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act,

02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:23.640
or ESEA, as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act,

02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:28.740
or ESSA, and was enacted on December 10, 2015.

02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:36.080
The other assessment under the California Assessment System

02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:39.440
is the English Language Proficiency Assessments

02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:42.120
for California, or ALPAC.

02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:45.280
So the ALPAC serves multiple purposes.

02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:48.760
The initial ALPAC is the Required State Task

02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:52.520
for English Language Proficiency, or ELP,

02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:56.040
that is administered to students whose primary language

02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:58.320
is a language other than English,

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:02.720
and it assesses listening, speaking, reading, and writing

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:07.720
to eligible students, or eligible students take this test,

02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:12.680
or this assessment only once in their educational career.

02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:14.800
And the purpose of the initial ALPAC, again,

02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:17.160
is to determine the English language proficiency

02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:20.480
of students enrolling in schools in California

02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:22.400
for the first time.

02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:25.320
So the process of administering the initial ALPAC

02:49:25.320 --> 02:49:27.920
and notifying parents and guardians of the results

02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:32.120
is completed within 30 days, calendar days,

02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:34.640
of enrollment in a California public school.

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:39.320
The summative ALPAC here measures

02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:42.140
how well English learner students are progressing

02:49:42.140 --> 02:49:44.360
with English language development,

02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.600
in each of the four domains, again,

02:49:46.600 --> 02:49:49.400
of listening, speaking, reading, and writing.

02:49:49.400 --> 02:49:52.200
And the purpose is to measure students' progress

02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:54.920
towards English language proficiency.

02:49:54.920 --> 02:49:58.440
As with the initial ALPAC, this assessment is administered

02:49:58.440 --> 02:50:01.480
to students in kindergarten through grade 12.

02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:07.640
Students are assessed with the summative ALPAC annually

02:50:07.640 --> 02:50:10.360
until they meet reclassification,

02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.440
or, and it also supports decisions for students

02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:17.640
to be re-designated as fluent English proficient.

02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:22.860
The alternate ALPAC is for English learner students

02:50:22.860 --> 02:50:26.200
with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:29.120
Again, for students in kindergarten through grade 12,

02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:31.040
it is used for the same purpose

02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:33.560
as the initial and summative ALPAC.

02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:36.800
The alternate ALPAC is aligned

02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:40.120
to the 2012 California English Language Development

02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.360
standards through the English Language Development Connectors,

02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:47.740
which are reduced in breadth, depth, and complexity.

02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:53.320
However, the alternate ALPAC uses integrated task types

02:50:53.320 --> 02:50:56.320
that measure a student's expressive,

02:50:56.320 --> 02:50:58.880
meaning speaking and writing skills,

02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:03.880
and receptive, meaning listening and reading skills.

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:06.800
However, students can respond

02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:08.920
in their preferred mode of communication

02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:10.960
for all test questions.

02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:14.520
So some examples of communication modes are verbal,

02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:17.760
one-word responses, or non-verbal responses,

02:51:17.760 --> 02:51:20.720
such as pointing, nodding, eye gaze,

02:51:20.720 --> 02:51:25.720
and using augmentative and alternative communication devices.

02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:29.160
And this assessment is administered one-on-one

02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:30.220
and in person.

02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:37.840
So we are in the middle of test administrations

02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:40.480
for the CASP and the ALPAC.

02:51:40.480 --> 02:51:42.840
This slide consists of the testing windows

02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:46.080
for the administration of the CASP assessments.

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:49.440
The Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments

02:51:49.440 --> 02:51:51.280
for English Language, Arts, and Math

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:52.920
span the whole year.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:58.480
From August 17th through July 30th, they'll be available.

02:51:58.480 --> 02:52:01.040
The California Alternate Assessment for Science

02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:04.880
is meant to be administered directly after instruction

02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:09.880
and is open from September 6th through July 15th.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:13.480
The CASP summative assessments overall for ELA

02:52:13.480 --> 02:52:16.280
for English Language, Arts, Mathematics, and Science,

02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:19.640
and the alternate assessments for the same content areas,

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:24.640
and the optional California Spanish assessment

02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:27.640
are available from January 11th through July 15th.

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:30.640
And then the ALPAC test administration windows

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:32.440
for this year.

02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:37.440
The initial ALPAC window opened in July 1st,

02:52:37.560 --> 02:52:40.960
and it will be available through June 30th.

02:52:40.960 --> 02:52:45.960
And then due to the holiday and systems updates,

02:52:46.520 --> 02:52:49.320
the first day of testing for next school year

02:52:49.320 --> 02:52:51.120
will begin on July 5th.

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:53.800
And then we'll have the first day of testing

02:52:54.040 --> 02:52:57.760
for next school year will begin on July 5th.

02:52:58.760 --> 02:53:02.280
And then we have our summative ALPAC window,

02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:05.400
which is open from February 1st

02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:07.600
through May 31st of each year.

02:53:08.600 --> 02:53:12.000
And then the alternate operational ALPAC,

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.760
alternate ALPAC operational field test, excuse me.

02:53:16.520 --> 02:53:20.200
Administration window opened on November 1st of this year,

02:53:20.200 --> 02:53:25.200
and it has been extended through May 31st, 2022.

02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:27.600
And I'll provide a little bit more detail

02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:30.440
about the status of our alternate ALPAC

02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:32.840
operational field test in a later slide.

02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:38.280
So to help with this item,

02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:41.320
and to provide further background,

02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:44.080
on this slide before you

02:53:44.080 --> 02:53:49.000
is the student score reports development timeline.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.680
And as background information,

02:53:51.680 --> 02:53:55.640
as each test becomes operational,

02:53:55.640 --> 02:53:58.360
we have brought the proposed student score reports

02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:01.880
to the State Board of Education for review and approval.

02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:04.080
So in March of 2015,

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:06.120
the State Board of Education approved

02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:10.240
the 2014-15 CASP student score reports,

02:54:10.240 --> 02:54:13.320
which was the first set of student score reports

02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:16.080
for English, Language, Arts, and Math.

02:54:16.080 --> 02:54:18.320
And then in January of 2016,

02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:22.800
the State Board approved the 2015-16 CASP

02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:26.680
student score reports for English, Language, Arts, and Math.

02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:29.720
And then in May 2016,

02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:32.760
the State Board of Education approved

02:54:32.760 --> 02:54:36.360
the 2015-16 student score reports

02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:38.760
for the California Alternate Assessments

02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:41.360
for English and Math, that was their first year.

02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:46.640
In December 2017, the State Board also approved

02:54:46.680 --> 02:54:49.680
the 2017-18 student score reports

02:54:49.680 --> 02:54:54.680
for the summative ALPAC assessment for the first time.

02:54:55.080 --> 02:54:57.720
And then in October 2018,

02:54:58.720 --> 02:55:02.160
we went through a period where we were transitioning

02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:06.000
from paper to electronic student score reports.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.480
So an information memorandum

02:55:09.480 --> 02:55:11.480
was sent to the State Board of Education

02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:15.400
that explained the technical edits to the score reports

02:55:15.400 --> 02:55:18.960
and the transition from paper to electronic reports

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:22.840
and the timing for that and the implementation plan.

02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:26.760
And then these technical edits and the resulting design

02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:29.800
that was applied to the English, Language, Arts, and Math

02:55:29.800 --> 02:55:32.760
was applied to all the CASP assessments.

02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:36.280
And that included the ELA Math, the Science,

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:38.000
the California Science Test,

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.600
the California Spanish Assessment,

02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:42.680
and the California Alternate Assessments

02:55:42.680 --> 02:55:44.600
for English, Language, Arts, and Math.

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:49.440
Then in September of 2019,

02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.440
the State Board approved the 2019-20 revisions

02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:58.720
to include the California Alternate Assessment

02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:00.880
for Science at that time.

02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:03.000
And in addition, the revisions

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:06.080
to the ALPAC student score reports.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.000
So the State Board of Education approved the 2020-21

02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:17.560
initial ALPAC student score report in January of 2020.

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:20.560
And then the 2020-21

02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:25.320
altered ALPAC student score reports in November of 2020.

02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:27.520
So it seems like I'm going through

02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:28.720
each of these dates with you,

02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:33.360
but they're very important in how it kind of addresses

02:56:33.360 --> 02:56:35.760
our timeline and what we're presenting today.

02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:39.120
So I just wanna make sure I provide some thorough background.

02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:42.400
And in January of this year,

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:45.200
the State Board of Education once again approved

02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:49.080
the revisions to the CASP and ALPAC student score reports

02:56:49.080 --> 02:56:51.800
for this year, the 21-22 school year.

02:56:52.680 --> 02:56:54.880
And then finally, the CD is proposing

02:56:54.880 --> 02:56:56.760
that the State Board of Education approve

02:56:56.760 --> 02:57:00.080
the 2022-23 initial ALPAC

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:05.040
and initial alternate ALPAC student score reports today.

02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:14.360
So in this slide, I will share the proposed revisions

02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:16.760
for the 22-23 initial ALPAC

02:57:16.760 --> 02:57:19.520
and initial alternate ALPAC student score reports

02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:22.000
as found in attachment two.

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:25.320
The purpose is to ensure that the student score reports

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.800
reflect the most up-to-date changes

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:30.760
so that key information about student performance

02:57:30.760 --> 02:57:34.160
is communicated clearly to parents and guardians.

02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:36.160
The California Department of Education

02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:39.840
proposes removing the alternate assessment footnote

02:57:39.840 --> 02:57:43.640
on this initial ALPAC student score report,

02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:45.880
updating the unlisted resource footnote

02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:49.000
as a single asterisk and making a minor edit

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.400
to the language in the footnote.

02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.560
Because the initial ALPAC,

02:57:53.560 --> 02:57:56.720
alternate ALPAC will be operational in July,

02:57:57.640 --> 02:58:00.120
local educational agencies will no longer need

02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:04.840
to administer locally determined alternate assessments.

02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:07.840
So the alternate assessment footnote is no longer needed

02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:11.000
on the initial ALPAC student score report.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:12.520
These changes are consistent

02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.080
with the summative ALPAC student score reports

02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:19.160
that were approved by the State Board of Education

02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:23.200
in January of this year, 2022.

02:58:23.200 --> 02:58:28.200
And in addition, based on feedback from our interest holders,

02:58:28.800 --> 02:58:31.920
the what is the ALPAC section

02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.600
has been incorporated into the why section

02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:37.000
both initial ALPAC

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.240
and the initial alternate ALPAC student score reports

02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:43.800
to be consistent with other student score reports.

02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:46.600
And lastly, the performance level graphic

02:58:46.600 --> 02:58:48.800
has been added to the overall score

02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:52.000
and performance level box on page one

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.200
to be consistent with the summative

02:58:54.200 --> 02:58:56.320
ALPAC student score report.

02:58:56.320 --> 02:58:59.320
And the academic year was updated to 2022-23

02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:03.760
on both student score reports.

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:11.720
So this is our mega assessment update.

02:59:11.720 --> 02:59:15.960
So we do have some specific updates to share with you.

02:59:15.960 --> 02:59:19.480
I'd like to go over them in this next session.

02:59:20.920 --> 02:59:24.040
As I mentioned, I was going to go into detail a bit more

02:59:24.040 --> 02:59:27.560
about the alternate ALPAC operational field test.

02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:31.320
The, this operational field test,

02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:35.840
the window again began on November 1st, 2021

02:59:35.840 --> 02:59:40.840
and was scheduled to end on February 15th, 2022.

02:59:40.960 --> 02:59:45.240
However, throughout the whole field test,

02:59:45.240 --> 02:59:49.200
we monitor testing and as we wanted to make sure

02:59:49.200 --> 02:59:52.600
that the local educational agencies were able to assess

02:59:52.600 --> 02:59:55.040
all of our eligible English learner students

02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:58.080
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

02:59:58.080 --> 02:59:59.960
on this assessment.

02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:02.480
And because not all local educational agencies

03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:04.080
were able to complete testing,

03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:07.600
the testing window has been extended to May 31st

03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:09.840
to coincide with the close of the summative

03:00:09.840 --> 03:00:12.960
ALPAC administration window as well.

03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:17.640
And as of February 15th, approximately 60%

03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:20.520
of the eligible students have been assessed.

03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:22.320
So with the extension of the window,

03:00:22.320 --> 03:00:25.120
we anticipate that the local educational agencies

03:00:25.120 --> 03:00:28.480
will be able to assess 100% of the eligible students

03:00:28.480 --> 03:00:31.640
as we near the end of the administration window.

03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:36.120
We are, we conducted the standard setting workshops

03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:40.960
with the contractor ETS and California educators

03:00:40.960 --> 03:00:44.160
in late February and early March.

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:46.960
So our next steps in the development

03:00:46.960 --> 03:00:50.120
of this alternate ALPAC will be to bring forward

03:00:50.520 --> 03:00:54.360
the standard setting plan to the State Board of Education

03:00:54.360 --> 03:00:58.520
via an April information memorandum

03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:00.520
and the proposed threshold scores

03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:03.840
to the State Board of Education's review and approval

03:01:03.840 --> 03:01:07.400
at its May SBE meeting.

03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:17.120
So transitioning to another update that we'd like to share

03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:21.400
is information about the Smarter Balanced

03:01:21.400 --> 03:01:23.800
demonstration of concept study.

03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:28.200
So in January, the California Department of Education

03:01:28.200 --> 03:01:30.520
did provide information regarding this study

03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:33.760
conducted by Smarter Balanced in partnership

03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:36.320
with the new teacher center.

03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:41.320
And this study stems from interest expressed by leadership

03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:45.120
in select member states in exploring the idea

03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:47.640
of through year assessments and other efforts

03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:50.280
to reduce the amount of time required

03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:53.400
for summative assessments at the end of the year.

03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:56.120
So considering these interests,

03:01:56.120 --> 03:01:58.600
Smarter Balanced and a new teacher center

03:01:58.600 --> 03:02:01.360
developed this study which focuses on examining

03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:04.880
how embedding Smarter Balanced performance tasks

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:09.320
into classroom instruction may reduce the time required

03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:12.760
for the end of year summative assessment process.

03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:20.800
So due to the challenges that local educational agencies

03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:24.800
have faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:28.720
the study is now comprised of solely two

03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:31.520
local educational agencies in California.

03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:35.640
Val Verde Unified School District,

03:02:35.640 --> 03:02:37.640
which is in Riverside County,

03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:41.560
is participating with grades four, five and six

03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:43.080
and high school.

03:02:43.080 --> 03:02:46.360
And Upper Lake Unified School District,

03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:48.040
which is in Lake County,

03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:51.240
is participating at the high school level.

03:02:51.240 --> 03:02:54.600
The states of Washington, just as a note,

03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:57.640
the states of Washington and Hawaii

03:02:57.640 --> 03:03:02.240
were originally going to participate also,

03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:04.340
but ultimately they were not able to.

03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:09.000
So in this study as a first step for participating,

03:03:09.040 --> 03:03:12.360
the educators were to attend an initial set

03:03:12.360 --> 03:03:14.520
of professional learning sessions

03:03:14.520 --> 03:03:17.000
hosted by the new teacher center.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:18.160
And then leadership staff

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:21.120
from both the local educational agencies

03:03:21.120 --> 03:03:24.440
met with the staff from Smarter Balanced

03:03:24.440 --> 03:03:25.960
and the new teacher center

03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:30.640
to create a customized professional learning plan

03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:34.000
that will work with their instructional calendars.

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:35.480
And at this point in the study,

03:03:35.480 --> 03:03:38.920
Val Verde has completed 16 of 26

03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:41.400
planned professional learning sessions.

03:03:41.400 --> 03:03:44.000
And Upper Lake Unified has completed seven

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:47.160
of the nine planned professional learning sessions.

03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:50.720
And some additional key steps

03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:53.680
for participating educators in this year's study

03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:58.480
include implementing the performance task support activity

03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:01.920
and then administering the performance task, of course,

03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:04.800
and collaborating with colleagues

03:04:04.840 --> 03:04:06.840
in scoring student responses

03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:10.720
and then planning for instruction based on data gathered.

03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:15.240
So this year's study is expected to conclude in May, 2022

03:04:15.240 --> 03:04:18.200
with a report to follow and further investigation

03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:23.200
to this area is anticipated for the 2022-23 school year.

03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:26.880
More information will be provided

03:04:26.880 --> 03:04:31.880
in our CASP update section of the May SBE item.

03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:40.360
So this brings me to the close of the presentation slides.

03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:42.800
I want to remind you to follow us on Twitter

03:04:42.800 --> 03:04:47.800
at CDE assessments to get some latest updates

03:04:47.800 --> 03:04:49.640
on all the development

03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:52.040
and administration activities we're doing.

03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:56.960
And at this time, I'm happy to pause

03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:00.760
and see if you have any clarifying questions

03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:02.640
that I may address at this time.

03:05:04.960 --> 03:05:07.240
Thank you so much, Mel.

03:05:07.240 --> 03:05:10.240
And could you put the call-in slide in up

03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:13.240
so that anyone who wants to queue up

03:05:13.240 --> 03:05:15.840
for a public comment can do so.

03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:18.720
And I'll just remind folks

03:05:18.720 --> 03:05:21.240
that they can make a public comment

03:05:21.240 --> 03:05:24.080
by calling the number and dialing the access code

03:05:24.080 --> 03:05:25.720
on this slide.

03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:27.520
And then while we're waiting for members of the public

03:05:27.520 --> 03:05:29.440
to call in, I'll share a couple of comments

03:05:29.440 --> 03:05:31.400
and then see if we have clarifying questions.

03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:35.320
And I see member Rodriguez is waiting with one.

03:05:35.320 --> 03:05:37.480
First, I just want to thank Mel

03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:39.680
for all the work that has gone on,

03:05:39.680 --> 03:05:41.760
not just in the last couple of months,

03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:43.040
but over this last year,

03:05:43.040 --> 03:05:45.840
trying to help us get through the process

03:05:45.840 --> 03:05:48.880
of doing assessments in the pandemic,

03:05:48.880 --> 03:05:53.480
just Yeoman's effort and two good results.

03:05:53.480 --> 03:05:58.480
And the end of that process is happening now

03:05:59.440 --> 03:06:02.440
as we sort of make sure that everything

03:06:02.440 --> 03:06:04.720
is ready to move forward in a more,

03:06:06.720 --> 03:06:08.080
I hate to say normal,

03:06:08.080 --> 03:06:10.960
because that word has taken on so many connotations,

03:06:10.960 --> 03:06:13.680
but in a more systematic way.

03:06:13.680 --> 03:06:15.240
So thank you very much for that.

03:06:15.240 --> 03:06:17.760
I think that the proposals here make a lot of sense.

03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:21.080
I'm particularly excited to hear more in May

03:06:21.080 --> 03:06:23.840
about the proof of concept that Smarter Balanced

03:06:23.840 --> 03:06:26.280
is engaged in with the performance tests

03:06:26.480 --> 03:06:30.280
being used in the classroom during the school year.

03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:33.760
And we'll look forward to hearing more about that.

03:06:33.760 --> 03:06:36.720
And we'll turn to clarifying questions.

03:06:36.720 --> 03:06:39.880
Iday, you are first up.

03:06:39.880 --> 03:06:40.840
All right, thank you.

03:06:40.840 --> 03:06:42.920
And thank you so much for this item.

03:06:42.920 --> 03:06:46.120
I really enjoyed the graphics and your presentation

03:06:46.120 --> 03:06:48.120
and the item itself.

03:06:48.120 --> 03:06:51.200
And I just have a clarifying question regarding,

03:06:51.200 --> 03:06:53.840
and it may be something that you covered

03:06:53.840 --> 03:06:55.960
or that has been covered before,

03:06:56.520 --> 03:06:59.320
but the SSRs, when they go home to the parents,

03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:01.000
are they also available to the parents

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:02.280
in their home language?

03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:09.080
Yes, we do translate them into the top seven languages

03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:12.760
in California, so they are available.

03:07:14.080 --> 03:07:15.560
Thank you for that.

03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:16.920
You're welcome.

03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:18.480
Any other clarifying questions

03:07:18.480 --> 03:07:20.120
before we go to public comment?

03:07:22.080 --> 03:07:25.680
Seeing none, we'll open the public comment line.

03:07:26.320 --> 03:07:27.720
Do we have any public comments?

03:07:27.720 --> 03:07:28.560
Yes, we do.

03:07:28.560 --> 03:07:30.000
It looks like we have two people signed up

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:31.360
for public comment.

03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:32.920
I will open the phone line now.

03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:37.040
Good afternoon, State Board of Education.

03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:39.120
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:40.000
You have one minute.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:41.440
Your time starts now.

03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:47.360
I am Martha Hernandez at Californians Together,

03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:50.480
and we endorse the approval of the revised student report

03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:54.320
for both 2022-23 initial LPAC

03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:56.680
and initial alternate LPAC.

03:07:56.680 --> 03:07:58.440
We want to express our appreciation

03:07:58.440 --> 03:08:01.800
for the revisions on the reports for both the forms

03:08:01.800 --> 03:08:04.120
to include the information on what is

03:08:04.120 --> 03:08:06.960
and why do we administer the initial LPAC.

03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:08.600
We are grateful for the opportunity

03:08:08.600 --> 03:08:11.920
to have provided input and collaborate with CDE staff

03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:13.760
on the new version of the form.

03:08:13.760 --> 03:08:15.200
Thank you very much.

03:08:15.200 --> 03:08:16.040
Thank you.

03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:18.840
Next caller, please state your name

03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:20.160
and affiliation for the record.

03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:21.560
Your time starts now.

03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:25.640
Good afternoon.

03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:29.960
Liz Guillen at Public Advocates for the Equity Coalition.

03:08:29.960 --> 03:08:32.080
We want to support this item,

03:08:32.080 --> 03:08:35.600
and we also wanted to take the opportunity

03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:37.560
to thank the department staff

03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:39.600
for hearing the concerns that we raised

03:08:39.600 --> 03:08:41.520
about the student score reports

03:08:41.520 --> 03:08:44.000
and making the changes that we recommended.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.880
We think it's going to be helpful for parents

03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:50.080
as they try to make sense of all this information.

03:08:50.080 --> 03:08:53.120
And we also think it's important that whenever we can,

03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:56.200
that we thank our colleagues at the department

03:08:56.200 --> 03:08:58.200
for all the hard work that they're doing.

03:08:58.200 --> 03:08:59.040
Thank you.

03:08:59.040 --> 03:08:59.860
Bye-bye.

03:08:59.860 --> 03:09:00.700
Thank you.

03:09:00.700 --> 03:09:03.200
That concludes public comment for item number two.

03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:07.840
I just think it's lovely that we get public comments

03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:11.000
thanking people for being so responsive to public input

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:14.800
and recognizing the efforts of the departments.

03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:19.800
So just like to launch us into a good discussion

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:23.520
of this item with that observation,

03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:25.920
are there any other questions or comments

03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:28.040
from folks about this item?

03:09:30.640 --> 03:09:32.320
Yes, Member Bonacca.

03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:36.400
I have a quick clarifying question

03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:39.040
in terms of the Smarter Balanced Demonstration

03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:40.960
of Concept Study.

03:09:40.960 --> 03:09:42.920
So if I'm understanding it correctly,

03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:46.560
teachers are embedding performance tasks

03:09:46.560 --> 03:09:48.840
in the classroom instruction

03:09:48.840 --> 03:09:51.280
as a way to prepare for the test, correct?

03:09:53.280 --> 03:09:55.040
Ultimately, it might be the way

03:09:55.040 --> 03:09:56.560
that the test is actually given

03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:59.800
rather than doing it all at one time at the end.

03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:02.480
But I see that Tony Alpert has just popped up

03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:03.320
on the screen.

03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:04.280
Hi, Tony.

03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:07.400
Do you want to respond to that question?

03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:08.600
Absolutely.

03:10:08.600 --> 03:10:10.200
So thank you for the question.

03:10:11.960 --> 03:10:15.400
Ultimately, we want teachers to provide

03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:17.640
to improve student learning

03:10:17.640 --> 03:10:19.880
and to address the skills

03:10:19.880 --> 03:10:21.440
that the performance tests measure.

03:10:21.440 --> 03:10:23.640
So the demonstration of concept

03:10:23.640 --> 03:10:25.560
gives a little bit of flexibility

03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:30.560
as to when the A task might be administered,

03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:32.560
currently the interim assessment task,

03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:38.480
and so that teachers can better fit the task

03:10:38.480 --> 03:10:41.000
with their instructional plan,

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:45.080
but ultimately gives a lot of guidance

03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:46.560
and support and structure

03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:50.680
regarding the higher order thinking skills

03:10:50.680 --> 03:10:53.160
that the performance has addressed

03:10:53.160 --> 03:10:54.920
and helps guide the teachers

03:10:54.920 --> 03:10:58.560
in how they can provide students

03:10:58.560 --> 03:11:01.280
with the scaffolding to bring their background

03:11:01.280 --> 03:11:05.040
and their assets into a instructional discussion

03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:08.720
that better helps students acquire those skills.

03:11:09.400 --> 03:11:12.040
We anticipate that students will do better

03:11:12.040 --> 03:11:13.960
on the summit of assessment,

03:11:13.960 --> 03:11:15.200
but the primary purpose

03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:16.960
is to improve teaching and learning.

03:11:18.240 --> 03:11:19.600
And let me just say that

03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:22.360
there are more than 20 states

03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:23.680
around the country right now

03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:25.360
that are looking at different ways

03:11:25.360 --> 03:11:26.960
of organizing assessment.

03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:29.320
Having been through the pandemic

03:11:29.320 --> 03:11:30.920
and everyone trying to figure out

03:11:30.920 --> 03:11:33.160
how do we give our assessments at the end of the year,

03:11:33.160 --> 03:11:36.360
but also feeling a need for information

03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:38.960
that informs teaching and learning throughout the year.

03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:40.120
There are a number of states

03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:42.320
that are in one way or another

03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:45.480
looking at methods to do assessment

03:11:45.480 --> 03:11:48.040
that would allow assessments

03:11:48.040 --> 03:11:49.240
during the course of the school year

03:11:49.240 --> 03:11:52.680
to be part of both informing instruction

03:11:52.680 --> 03:11:56.400
and potentially to be rolled up as part of the score,

03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:58.880
rather than doing all of that at the end of the year,

03:11:58.880 --> 03:12:00.080
which for us,

03:12:00.080 --> 03:12:04.320
because we have performance tasks in our assessments,

03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:06.280
which we're proud of and happy about,

03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:09.960
would allow shortening those assessments

03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:12.480
significantly at the end of the year as well.

03:12:12.480 --> 03:12:17.120
So it is at the moment a way to test the concept.

03:12:17.120 --> 03:12:18.280
It's a proof of concept.

03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:21.400
Could we embed these tests in instruction?

03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:23.360
How do they work?

03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:26.400
How do teachers and students feel about that process?

03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:29.720
And then is there an implication for the end of the year?

03:12:29.720 --> 03:12:33.080
But so the folks who are engaged in the pilot

03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:36.320
will give the interim performance tests now

03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:39.120
and will also still see performance tests

03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:41.840
in their end of year assessment this year.

03:12:41.840 --> 03:12:43.000
Got it.

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:44.480
Thank you for the clarification.

03:12:44.480 --> 03:12:46.280
And just one more clarification.

03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:49.240
So if they're taking these tasks throughout the year,

03:12:51.520 --> 03:12:54.080
do teachers, if I'm understanding this correctly,

03:12:54.080 --> 03:12:56.080
get the data from those assessments

03:12:56.080 --> 03:12:58.600
and they're able to modify their learning

03:12:58.600 --> 03:13:01.440
to kind of fill any gaps in knowledge that they see,

03:13:01.440 --> 03:13:03.200
or is that data not available?

03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:07.800
Kerry?

03:13:07.800 --> 03:13:11.440
So the interim assessments provide data

03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:13.240
pretty much immediately.

03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:15.840
In the case of the performance test,

03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:18.440
it requires that someone, typically the teacher,

03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:21.240
complete hand scoring,

03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:24.120
and then the results are available in the CSRS,

03:13:24.120 --> 03:13:28.680
the California Educator Reporting System,

03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:32.360
which they can then use in a couple of different ways.

03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:35.320
They can look at the students' responses.

03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:39.000
They can look at all the students' responses in the class.

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:43.040
They can connect to tools for teachers to find resources

03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:46.240
that address the same skills

03:13:46.240 --> 03:13:50.320
and think about whether or not they can,

03:13:50.320 --> 03:13:52.160
they need to retool their instruction

03:13:52.160 --> 03:13:56.480
or enhance or address specific concepts.

03:13:56.480 --> 03:13:57.560
They also have access

03:13:57.560 --> 03:13:59.880
to our annotated student response viewer,

03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:03.680
where they can see exemplar papers at each performance level

03:14:03.680 --> 03:14:08.280
and get an idea of where their student performance fits in

03:14:08.280 --> 03:14:12.440
with the rubric based on similar students' writings.

03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:16.480
And so part of the discussion then is,

03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:19.240
all that is available with the interim assessments.

03:14:19.240 --> 03:14:21.080
What is, as Linda was describing,

03:14:21.080 --> 03:14:22.320
we still have to think about then,

03:14:22.320 --> 03:14:27.280
how do we transport that into a summative type environment

03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:30.760
where similar flexibility and benefits are available?

03:14:30.760 --> 03:14:33.920
But right now, we're getting feedback on,

03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:35.400
is this at all helpful?

03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:38.920
And so far, the results are promising.

03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:42.080
Got it, thank you for that clarification.

03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:44.480
And I can just say, as a student,

03:14:44.480 --> 03:14:47.600
I know that when my teachers kind of have implemented

03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:51.680
a similar type of teaching where we take tasks,

03:14:51.680 --> 03:14:54.240
like for example, tests, I know for my IB tests,

03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:56.080
we've done this a lot.

03:14:56.080 --> 03:14:58.920
We take mock exams and they grade it

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:02.560
and they kind of go back and teach us the things that,

03:15:02.560 --> 03:15:05.200
they kind of fill in those gaps in knowledge.

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:08.120
And I've found that it's been just extremely helpful.

03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:12.520
It really helped me, especially last year with my IB exams,

03:15:12.520 --> 03:15:15.960
and right now I'm using that method this year as well.

03:15:15.960 --> 03:15:19.520
So I'm really glad that we're studying this.

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:23.400
And as you know, with an IB program,

03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:25.320
you're taking some papers and projects

03:15:25.320 --> 03:15:27.040
during the school year that are being scored

03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:28.840
and taking some exams that are being scored

03:15:28.840 --> 03:15:32.600
and it all gets combined into an analysis.

03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:37.120
So it's actually sort of a type of analog.

03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:39.720
Member Glover-Woods.

03:15:41.680 --> 03:15:45.320
Yes, clarifying question around the calibration

03:15:45.320 --> 03:15:48.760
of the scoring related to the performance tasks.

03:15:48.800 --> 03:15:53.680
So how in this pilot are the scores

03:15:53.680 --> 03:15:56.880
that teachers are giving to the performance tasks

03:15:56.880 --> 03:15:58.960
calibrated from class to class

03:15:58.960 --> 03:16:03.160
and with the schools that are participating in the study?

03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:09.800
If I may answer that,

03:16:10.680 --> 03:16:13.880
that's an incredibly important and complicated question.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:17.000
So we provide the task,

03:16:20.960 --> 03:16:24.160
all the interim assessment items are field tested

03:16:24.160 --> 03:16:26.000
during the summative assessment.

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:29.840
And it is an intel after field testing is completed

03:16:29.840 --> 03:16:34.240
and we've looked at the quality of the statistics

03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:37.040
associated with the items that we then determine

03:16:37.040 --> 03:16:39.200
whether or not those items go into the interim

03:16:39.200 --> 03:16:40.040
or the summative.

03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:45.040
So, but they all meet the same rigorous quality criteria.

03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:50.080
And so that's how we calibrate from a statistical sense

03:16:50.080 --> 03:16:53.040
as to the relative difficulty of items.

03:16:53.040 --> 03:16:58.040
Then regarding scoring as each performance task

03:16:59.120 --> 03:17:03.280
is associated with papers, we call anchor papers

03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:08.280
that help orient the teacher on the requisite knowledge

03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:10.720
of skills that students need to demonstrate

03:17:10.720 --> 03:17:15.720
for a particular prompt and what the associated level

03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:21.120
of the rubric that performance would be associated with.

03:17:21.600 --> 03:17:25.000
And teachers can look at those

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.560
and they can go through a process independently

03:17:28.760 --> 03:17:30.920
to calibrate their own scoring

03:17:30.920 --> 03:17:34.480
against these pre-scored papers.

03:17:34.480 --> 03:17:36.920
During the demonstration of concept,

03:17:36.920 --> 03:17:39.840
the new teacher center is providing embedded

03:17:39.840 --> 03:17:43.200
and ongoing coaching and helping teachers

03:17:43.200 --> 03:17:46.440
understand the rubric, understand the content standards

03:17:46.440 --> 03:17:49.160
associated with the performance task

03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:51.200
that the performance task is measuring

03:17:51.200 --> 03:17:55.440
and then helping guide them on that critical process

03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:58.280
of calibrating their own evaluation

03:17:59.200 --> 03:18:01.680
based on these other resources.

03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:05.560
And so that is a substantial enhancement

03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:10.440
into the process that we think is both extremely helpful

03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:14.720
and also essential as we increase the complexity

03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:16.440
of the summative assessment

03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:20.720
and give that additional flexibility to teachers.

03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:24.240
So let me just also note that this experiment,

03:18:24.240 --> 03:18:26.400
if you will, this proof of concept

03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:31.400
does not count at all in our end of year testing this year.

03:18:31.400 --> 03:18:35.920
This is an opportunity to see how it goes in classrooms

03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:39.360
and some of those teachers are scoring the students work.

03:18:39.360 --> 03:18:41.960
I think there may be some who opted out of scoring

03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:44.040
and other teachers are scoring the work

03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:46.800
and who are trained scorers

03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:49.040
because we do for our assessments,

03:18:49.040 --> 03:18:51.640
trained scores routinely who are teachers.

03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:56.320
And so they get the scores from someone else's scoring,

03:18:56.320 --> 03:19:01.320
but this is all for the purpose of learning at the moment.

03:19:01.880 --> 03:19:04.560
If we were ever to do something like this

03:19:04.560 --> 03:19:06.400
as part of the summative,

03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:08.040
there would be a training process,

03:19:08.040 --> 03:19:10.120
there would be a calibration process,

03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:13.080
there would probably be a back read and audit process

03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:15.720
that would take place as is common

03:19:15.720 --> 03:19:19.120
when you use performance tasks.

03:19:19.120 --> 03:19:22.160
And as happens with the performance tasks now

03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:24.560
that are in the end of year exam.

03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:27.720
Any other questions?

03:19:28.600 --> 03:19:30.880
All right, well, thank you very much.

03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:32.400
Thanks for coming, Tony.

03:19:32.400 --> 03:19:33.760
Nice to see you.

03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:34.840
Not a very long trip.

03:19:34.840 --> 03:19:36.920
I think you might have gone from your kitchen

03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:40.440
to your living room, but to get online.

03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:43.800
And Mal, thank you for all the good work that you've done.

03:19:43.800 --> 03:19:45.960
I don't, I guess we do need a motion.

03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:50.960
Yes, to accept the new changes to the score reports.

03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:53.440
Do I have a motion on that?

03:19:53.440 --> 03:19:54.920
Do I have a motion on that?

03:19:56.560 --> 03:19:58.000
I move.

03:19:58.000 --> 03:19:59.880
And here's the recommendation for approval.

03:19:59.880 --> 03:20:02.080
I assume you're moving this recommendation.

03:20:03.320 --> 03:20:04.960
And do we have a second?

03:20:04.960 --> 03:20:05.880
Second.

03:20:05.880 --> 03:20:07.480
Thank you very much.

03:20:07.480 --> 03:20:08.760
Any further discussion?

03:20:10.040 --> 03:20:12.280
Brooks, would you like to call the roll?

03:20:12.280 --> 03:20:13.120
Member Rodriguez.

03:20:14.400 --> 03:20:15.440
Yes.

03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:16.640
Member Petillo-Brownson.

03:20:18.120 --> 03:20:19.080
Yes.

03:20:19.080 --> 03:20:19.920
Member McQuillan.

03:20:20.920 --> 03:20:21.760
Aye.

03:20:23.680 --> 03:20:25.040
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

03:20:26.240 --> 03:20:27.480
Yes.

03:20:27.480 --> 03:20:28.320
Member Olken.

03:20:29.200 --> 03:20:30.040
Member Lewis.

03:20:31.520 --> 03:20:32.600
Yes.

03:20:32.600 --> 03:20:33.960
Vice President Glover-Woods.

03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:36.320
Yes.

03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:37.160
Member Escobedo.

03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:39.360
Yes.

03:20:39.360 --> 03:20:41.200
President Darling-Hammond.

03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:42.160
Yes.

03:20:42.160 --> 03:20:43.000
Member Bonacca.

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:45.320
Aye.

03:20:45.320 --> 03:20:46.160
Motion passes.

03:20:47.640 --> 03:20:48.480
Thank you.

03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:50.240
I move right along to item three,

03:20:50.240 --> 03:20:53.120
which is the Federal Every Student Succeeds Act,

03:20:53.120 --> 03:20:55.440
Authorization to Pursue a Waiver

03:20:55.440 --> 03:20:59.040
for the 2021-22 school year of the 1% cap

03:20:59.040 --> 03:21:01.360
on the percentage of eligible students

03:21:01.360 --> 03:21:03.800
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

03:21:03.800 --> 03:21:06.080
who may be assessed with an alternate assessment

03:21:06.080 --> 03:21:09.040
aligned with alternate academic achievement standards

03:21:09.040 --> 03:21:11.720
for English language arts, mathematics,

03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:14.360
and science or other related waivers.

03:21:14.360 --> 03:21:16.840
And this item will be presented

03:21:16.840 --> 03:21:19.080
by Cheryl Cotton and Mal Vang.

03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.200
Glad you didn't go far.

03:21:27.560 --> 03:21:29.600
And Cheryl, we're not hearing you yet,

03:21:29.600 --> 03:21:31.240
just to let you know.

03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:33.880
Superintendent Thurmond,

03:21:33.880 --> 03:21:35.800
President Darling-Hammond,

03:21:35.800 --> 03:21:37.800
Vice President Glover-Woods,

03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:39.480
and board members, I'm Cheryl Cotton,

03:21:39.480 --> 03:21:41.320
again, Deputy Superintendent

03:21:41.320 --> 03:21:44.200
of the Instruction, Measurement, and Administration branch.

03:21:44.200 --> 03:21:45.920
To assist with this item,

03:21:45.920 --> 03:21:47.360
I have Dr. Mal Vang,

03:21:47.360 --> 03:21:48.640
Director of Assessment Development

03:21:48.640 --> 03:21:51.200
and Administration Division to co-present,

03:21:51.200 --> 03:21:52.360
Dr. Linda Hooper,

03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:56.560
Associate Director of Assessment and Administration Division,

03:21:56.560 --> 03:21:58.680
and Shiloh Duncan-Berserill,

03:21:58.680 --> 03:22:01.160
Associate Director of the Special Education Division

03:22:01.160 --> 03:22:03.440
as panelists to assist us with questions.

03:22:04.320 --> 03:22:08.040
The item before you today is an action and information item.

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.320
A revised version of item three

03:22:11.320 --> 03:22:14.000
was posted on March 3rd to update the following.

03:22:14.680 --> 03:22:16.120
On page four of the item

03:22:16.120 --> 03:22:18.520
and page 16 of attachment one,

03:22:18.520 --> 03:22:20.360
we provided language to clarify

03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:24.480
how California intends to meet the 90-day requirement

03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:28.000
to submit a waiver request of the 1% cap

03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:29.120
on eligible students

03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:32.160
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:34.920
who may be assessed with an alternate assessment

03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:38.120
for the 22-23 school year.

03:22:38.120 --> 03:22:40.080
On page eight of attachment one,

03:22:40.080 --> 03:22:42.160
the updated estimates were provided

03:22:42.160 --> 03:22:44.400
in tables eight and nine,

03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:46.400
based on recent registration data.

03:22:50.520 --> 03:22:54.160
Today's presentation covers the recommendation for approval

03:22:54.160 --> 03:22:57.960
of and background on this action item request

03:22:57.960 --> 03:23:01.400
to the United States Department of Education, or ED.

03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:05.480
Today's presentation will cover the following topics.

03:23:05.480 --> 03:23:06.760
We'll provide an overview

03:23:06.760 --> 03:23:08.480
of the California Department of Education's

03:23:08.480 --> 03:23:10.600
recommendation for approval,

03:23:10.600 --> 03:23:12.120
as well as background information

03:23:12.120 --> 03:23:14.320
on the action item for today.

03:23:14.320 --> 03:23:17.840
Then we will go over some of the CASP and LPAC updates.

03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:20.840
And finally, we will return to the CDE's recommendation

03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:22.880
for SBE action.

03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:26.360
Now I will hand the presentation over to Dr. Mao Vang,

03:23:26.360 --> 03:23:27.800
Director of the Assessment Development

03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:29.240
and Administration Division.

03:23:36.680 --> 03:23:37.760
Thank you, Cheryl.

03:23:41.600 --> 03:23:45.080
Again, Superintendent Thurman, President Arlen Hammond,

03:23:45.080 --> 03:23:47.800
Vice President Glover-Woods, and board members.

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:49.960
I'm Mao Vang.

03:23:49.960 --> 03:23:51.760
I'm Director of the Assessment Development

03:23:51.760 --> 03:23:53.200
and Administration Division.

03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:55.640
In this section, I will provide an overview

03:23:55.640 --> 03:23:58.360
of CDE's recommendation for approval.

03:23:58.360 --> 03:23:59.920
And just to clarify, I may have

03:24:03.200 --> 03:24:06.720
note that the recommendation here is

03:24:06.920 --> 03:24:11.920
that the CDE recommends that the California State Board

03:24:13.440 --> 03:24:17.080
of Education authorize the California Department

03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:20.720
of Education to submit to the U.S. Department of Education

03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:24.720
the draft waiver package found in attachment one,

03:24:24.720 --> 03:24:26.640
which contains the following.

03:24:26.640 --> 03:24:31.640
A request for a waiver of the requirement to assess 95%

03:24:38.760 --> 03:24:42.760
of students in the 2020-21 school year.

03:24:43.840 --> 03:24:46.200
Request for a waiver of the requirement

03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:49.800
that these waiver requests be submitted at least 90 days

03:24:49.800 --> 03:24:52.720
before the beginning of our annual testing window.

03:24:53.600 --> 03:24:56.240
And request for a waiver of the requirement

03:24:56.240 --> 03:24:59.640
to assess less than 1% of eligible students

03:24:59.640 --> 03:25:04.120
with an alternate assessment for the 21-22 administration.

03:25:06.040 --> 03:25:09.760
Furthermore, we are asking for a request

03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:12.200
for an extension of our plan

03:25:12.200 --> 03:25:15.440
to report preliminary indicator results

03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:19.000
for the 2021 administration

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:22.600
of the California alternate assessment for science.

03:25:26.240 --> 03:25:31.240
As background information, the State Board of Education

03:25:31.280 --> 03:25:33.880
has the authority to request waivers

03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:36.880
for federal requirement as the designated

03:25:36.880 --> 03:25:39.280
state education agency.

03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:44.760
And that is why we are bringing this up to you.

03:25:44.760 --> 03:25:48.680
And then just going over the background information

03:25:50.200 --> 03:25:53.200
regarding the requirements for the state education.

03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:58.360
Information regarding our recommendation.

03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:05.920
This per, excuse me, per our federal regulations,

03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:15.520
which is really Section 200.6C2.

03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:20.640
The total number of students assessed

03:26:20.680 --> 03:26:23.200
using an alternate assessment

03:26:23.200 --> 03:26:26.400
aligned with alternate academic achievement standards

03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:29.080
may not exceed 1% of the total number

03:26:29.080 --> 03:26:32.000
of students assessed in the state.

03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:36.200
So if the state expects that it will exceed 1%

03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:39.400
of students assessed with alternate assessments,

03:26:39.400 --> 03:26:43.160
the state needs to request a waiver of this requirement.

03:26:44.080 --> 03:26:46.640
So in order for a state to be eligible

03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:50.720
for the waiver of the 1% cap on alternate assessments,

03:26:50.720 --> 03:26:54.760
it must assess at least 95% of all students enrolled

03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:58.560
as well as 95% of students with this,

03:26:58.560 --> 03:27:01.400
in the students with disabilities group

03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:02.840
in the previous year.

03:27:04.840 --> 03:27:07.960
Furthermore, a request of a waiver of 1%,

03:27:07.960 --> 03:27:11.640
of the 1% cap requirement must be submitted 90 days

03:27:11.640 --> 03:27:15.520
before the beginning of the state's annual testing window.

03:27:15.520 --> 03:27:19.240
So the CASP summative testing window

03:27:19.240 --> 03:27:24.240
opened on January 11th, 2022.

03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:28.240
So as a result, there is a memo

03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:34.160
from the US Department of Education

03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:38.680
on October, dated October 29th, 2021,

03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:42.560
regarding this 1% cap waiver.

03:27:42.560 --> 03:27:44.760
And the extended options to states

03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:47.440
to meet this requirement in light of the impact

03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:52.160
of the COVID pandemic in the 2020-21 school year.

03:27:52.160 --> 03:27:55.680
So based on CDE or California Department of Education's

03:27:55.680 --> 03:27:57.880
data analysis and survey results

03:27:57.880 --> 03:28:00.800
from local educational agencies,

03:28:00.800 --> 03:28:03.480
the California Department of Education anticipates

03:28:03.480 --> 03:28:08.480
that California will exceed the 1% cap for the 2021-22.

03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:14.280
And so the waiver package that the CDE wishes

03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:18.680
to submit with the State Board of Education's approval

03:28:18.680 --> 03:28:22.000
involves a waiver of the 1% cap,

03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:24.960
as well as other waivers determined to be necessary

03:28:24.960 --> 03:28:28.280
due to the unique situation surrounding state testing

03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:29.640
throughout the pandemic.

03:28:32.680 --> 03:28:35.520
And I will cover each of these waivers

03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:38.320
in more detail in these slides.

03:28:38.320 --> 03:28:43.320
So the first waiver is the participation rate of 95%

03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:48.360
for the 2020-21 school year.

03:28:48.360 --> 03:28:51.280
So as I mentioned, in order for a state to be eligible

03:28:52.240 --> 03:28:55.680
for a waiver of the 1% cap on alternate assessments,

03:28:55.680 --> 03:29:00.280
it must have assessed at least 95% of students enrolled

03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:04.080
as well as 95% of students with disabilities

03:29:04.080 --> 03:29:05.320
in the previous year.

03:29:06.600 --> 03:29:11.600
And the Ed did invite states to request a waiver

03:29:12.600 --> 03:29:17.600
of the 95% participation rate requirement for the 2020-21.

03:29:19.080 --> 03:29:21.720
And although our state, California,

03:29:21.720 --> 03:29:24.600
offered all of our statewide assessments

03:29:24.600 --> 03:29:27.600
in the 2020-21 school year,

03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:32.360
California did not meet the 95% participation rate.

03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:35.680
And this excludes the students who took local assessments

03:29:35.680 --> 03:29:40.360
as they are not counted toward the 95% participation rate.

03:29:40.360 --> 03:29:43.920
So due to the fact that California did not meet

03:29:43.920 --> 03:29:46.600
this 95% participation requirement

03:29:46.600 --> 03:29:49.280
in the 2020-21 school year,

03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:54.120
and meeting this participation rate is required

03:29:54.120 --> 03:29:57.400
for applying for the waiver of the 1% cap

03:29:57.400 --> 03:29:59.200
on alternate assessments,

03:29:59.200 --> 03:30:03.680
the CDE is requesting the SBE's authorization

03:30:03.680 --> 03:30:05.920
to request a waiver of the requirement

03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:10.920
to assess 95% of students in the 2020-21 school year.

03:30:14.760 --> 03:30:18.120
The second waiver, the 90-day timeline

03:30:18.120 --> 03:30:21.120
for request of the 1% waiver.

03:30:26.560 --> 03:30:29.560
The deadline, of course, from federal law

03:30:32.400 --> 03:30:35.600
is for requesting a waiver of these requirements

03:30:36.480 --> 03:30:39.440
to assess the less than 1% of students

03:30:39.440 --> 03:30:42.280
with an alternate assessment is that 90 days

03:30:42.280 --> 03:30:44.200
prior to the beginning of testing,

03:30:45.000 --> 03:30:48.600
again, because the testing window for the CAS has begun,

03:30:48.600 --> 03:30:51.800
the California Department of Education

03:30:51.800 --> 03:30:53.440
cannot meet this timeline.

03:30:53.440 --> 03:30:54.680
And for this reason,

03:30:54.680 --> 03:30:57.120
the California Department of Education

03:30:57.120 --> 03:31:00.320
requests the SBE's authorization to request

03:31:01.280 --> 03:31:03.280
for a waiver of the requirement

03:31:03.280 --> 03:31:06.360
that these waiver requests be submitted 90 days

03:31:06.360 --> 03:31:10.040
before the beginning of the state's annual testing window.

03:31:10.040 --> 03:31:12.760
So as a reminder, as Cheryl mentioned,

03:31:12.760 --> 03:31:16.840
a revised version of the item was posted on March 3rd

03:31:16.840 --> 03:31:19.040
with updates on page four of the item

03:31:19.040 --> 03:31:23.240
and page 16 of attachment one,

03:31:23.240 --> 03:31:26.560
with language to clarify how California intends

03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:29.880
to meet the 90-day requirement in the coming school year,

03:31:29.880 --> 03:31:33.040
the 2022-23 school year.

03:31:33.040 --> 03:31:38.040
So to meet the requirement in the 2022-23 school year,

03:31:38.600 --> 03:31:41.120
the California Department of Education

03:31:41.120 --> 03:31:45.320
will analyze the data from this spring's administration,

03:31:46.520 --> 03:31:51.520
2022, and if California is projected to exceed

03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:57.520
the 1% cap, the CDE will bring to the SBE

03:31:58.080 --> 03:32:01.360
a waiver request for exceeding the 1% cap

03:32:01.400 --> 03:32:05.920
on eligible students taking alternate assessments in July

03:32:05.920 --> 03:32:10.920
to give us that time allotment to do so.

03:32:13.920 --> 03:32:18.440
The third waiver is the 1% cap

03:32:18.440 --> 03:32:23.080
on students being assigned the alternate assessment

03:32:23.080 --> 03:32:26.200
for the 2021-22 school year.

03:32:27.040 --> 03:32:29.200
So the California Department of Education

03:32:29.200 --> 03:32:33.520
has collected surveys from local educational agencies

03:32:33.520 --> 03:32:38.400
regarding their expectations of number of eligible students

03:32:38.400 --> 03:32:40.640
participating in alternate assessments

03:32:40.640 --> 03:32:45.640
for the 2021-22 school year.

03:32:45.960 --> 03:32:48.240
And we have also reviewed alternate assessment

03:32:48.240 --> 03:32:53.240
participation data from the 2018-19

03:32:53.240 --> 03:32:56.680
as well as the 2020-21 school year.

03:32:56.680 --> 03:32:59.320
And the California Department of Education

03:32:59.320 --> 03:33:03.800
anticipates and expects that the state will exceed

03:33:03.800 --> 03:33:07.880
the 1% cap on the percentage of our eligible students

03:33:07.880 --> 03:33:10.920
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

03:33:10.920 --> 03:33:13.520
who may be assessed with an alternate assessment

03:33:13.520 --> 03:33:16.960
for the 2021-22 school year.

03:33:16.960 --> 03:33:21.560
And for this reason, the CDE requests the SBE's

03:33:21.560 --> 03:33:24.920
authorization to submit the waiver of the 1% cap

03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:28.080
for the 2021-22 school year.

03:33:29.120 --> 03:33:31.800
And on the following slides,

03:33:31.800 --> 03:33:35.000
I will review some of the participation rate data

03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:40.000
included in the CDE's waiver requests package

03:33:41.080 --> 03:33:43.440
to the US Department of Education.

03:33:46.840 --> 03:33:51.840
So this table consists of the California

03:33:52.400 --> 03:33:56.360
alternate assessment participation rate

03:33:56.360 --> 03:33:59.560
of eligible students with disabilities

03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:04.080
by content area, ELA, English language arts,

03:34:04.080 --> 03:34:09.080
mathematics, and science for the 2020-21 school year.

03:34:09.520 --> 03:34:12.080
So the data indicates that English language arts

03:34:12.080 --> 03:34:16.680
and mathematics exceeded the 1% threshold

03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:19.560
and science was very close to the 1%.

03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:27.280
And this table shows the estimated number

03:34:31.480 --> 03:34:33.760
of eligible students

03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:36.920
for the California alternate assessments,

03:34:36.920 --> 03:34:40.360
participation rates again by English language arts,

03:34:40.360 --> 03:34:45.360
mathematics, and science in the 2020-22 school administration.

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:51.240
And it's based on enrollment and registration.

03:34:51.240 --> 03:34:54.080
And the estimated number of students assessed

03:34:54.080 --> 03:34:58.080
with the California alternate assessments

03:34:58.080 --> 03:35:01.880
to meet the 95% participation rate.

03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:06.880
Again, as a reminder, the revised version of the item

03:35:06.880 --> 03:35:11.880
that was posted on March 3rd on page eight of attachment one,

03:35:11.920 --> 03:35:14.920
the updated estimates were provided in tables eight and nine

03:35:14.920 --> 03:35:18.400
based on recent registration data.

03:35:25.400 --> 03:35:30.400
And then the estimated overall CAA participation rates,

03:35:31.600 --> 03:35:35.600
this one is the estimated overall participation rates

03:35:35.600 --> 03:35:40.200
for all students, and this one is the estimated

03:35:40.240 --> 03:35:42.520
participation rates for all students

03:35:42.520 --> 03:35:47.520
and for this spring's test of 2022 spring administration.

03:35:50.760 --> 03:35:53.000
This table shows the estimated number

03:35:53.000 --> 03:35:55.200
of eligible students overall

03:35:55.200 --> 03:35:57.760
for English language arts, mathematics, and science

03:35:57.760 --> 03:36:00.800
and the estimated number of students

03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:06.440
who need to be assessed to meet the 95% participation rate.

03:36:07.440 --> 03:36:12.440
Overall, the data from recent years and estimates

03:36:12.480 --> 03:36:15.200
for the 2022 administration indicates

03:36:15.200 --> 03:36:20.200
that California should request a waiver of the 1% cap

03:36:20.240 --> 03:36:22.080
on the percentage of eligible students

03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:25.120
with the most significant cognitive disabilities

03:36:25.120 --> 03:36:28.000
who may be assessed with an alternate assessment

03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:32.960
for the 2021-22 school year for English language arts,

03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:34.760
mathematics, and science.

03:36:36.560 --> 03:36:41.560
And then switching again to more further background

03:36:44.400 --> 03:36:49.400
on the next topic is requesting an extension

03:36:51.320 --> 03:36:55.840
to use the preliminary indicators for reporting results

03:36:55.840 --> 03:37:00.840
of the 2021 California alternate assessments for science.

03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:05.840
The, in the 2019-20 school year,

03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:12.240
California Department of Education did plan that

03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:17.240
to be the California alternate science assessment

03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:19.640
for science's administration

03:37:19.640 --> 03:37:24.640
to be the first operational field test operational year.

03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:27.680
However, due to the COVID pandemic,

03:37:28.360 --> 03:37:30.080
again, testing was suspended

03:37:30.080 --> 03:37:33.040
and the first California alternate assessment

03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:36.680
for science operational field test was delayed for one year.

03:37:38.520 --> 03:37:42.520
And then during the 2020-21 school year,

03:37:42.520 --> 03:37:44.200
the California alternate assessment

03:37:44.200 --> 03:37:49.200
for science administration due to the continued impact

03:37:49.600 --> 03:37:51.560
of the COVID pandemic,

03:37:51.560 --> 03:37:54.280
there was a limited number of eligible students

03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:57.280
who were eligible for the 2021 school year

03:37:57.760 --> 03:38:00.320
and students who completed testing.

03:38:00.320 --> 03:38:03.120
Therefore, the California Department of Education

03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:06.480
delayed the operational administration of the test

03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:07.560
for another year.

03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:10.800
So California is now requesting

03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:13.320
that the State Board of Education

03:38:13.320 --> 03:38:16.320
authorize the California Department of Education

03:38:16.320 --> 03:38:19.320
to request from the US Department of Education

03:38:19.320 --> 03:38:23.240
an extension to use the preliminary indicator results

03:38:23.240 --> 03:38:26.080
for the 2020-21 administration.

03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:31.640
For the California alternate assessment for science.

03:38:34.120 --> 03:38:38.120
And that summarizes each of the ask

03:38:38.120 --> 03:38:41.680
or request for waivers or request for extension

03:38:41.680 --> 03:38:44.160
that are in this item.

03:38:44.160 --> 03:38:49.160
And it brings me to the summary slide here.

03:38:49.200 --> 03:38:54.120
So I will just remind you about our little Twitter account

03:38:54.160 --> 03:38:57.160
and following us, and I will pause for

03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:01.480
and answer any clarifying questions that you may have.

03:39:03.720 --> 03:39:05.400
Running back to you, President.

03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:08.240
Thank you, I appreciate the little PR plug

03:39:08.240 --> 03:39:09.440
for the Twitter account.

03:39:11.720 --> 03:39:14.360
And I'll just say we have a hot water heater

03:39:14.360 --> 03:39:15.440
being replaced here.

03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:17.560
So I've been kind of on and off screen a little bit.

03:39:17.560 --> 03:39:20.080
And if I disappear, Vice President Glover Woods

03:39:20.080 --> 03:39:21.280
will be taking the gavel.

03:39:21.320 --> 03:39:25.800
So we're just keeping up with business today.

03:39:25.800 --> 03:39:27.720
Could you put up the public comment slides

03:39:27.720 --> 03:39:31.880
so that we can have callers queue up for public comment?

03:39:31.880 --> 03:39:36.880
And I will see if any of you in the board

03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:42.000
will have any clarifying questions

03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:43.600
while we're waiting for public comment.

03:39:43.600 --> 03:39:48.600
And simply say that this is very helpful information.

03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:51.600
Mal, we appreciate it.

03:39:51.600 --> 03:39:55.440
And I don't have any particular concerns

03:39:55.440 --> 03:39:56.640
or questions myself.

03:39:56.640 --> 03:39:58.880
So any clarifying questions?

03:40:02.240 --> 03:40:03.840
Yes, Member Glover Woods.

03:40:05.520 --> 03:40:09.120
And again, definitely support the need for the waiver.

03:40:09.120 --> 03:40:13.600
Just Mal clarifying question on why we were not able

03:40:13.600 --> 03:40:17.480
to meet the 90 day window for the 2021,

03:40:17.480 --> 03:40:20.040
2020, 2021 school year.

03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:24.640
Yeah, so last school year we did,

03:40:24.640 --> 03:40:27.960
the board did approve us to extend the testing window

03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:31.920
all the way to the end of July for both CASP and ALPAC.

03:40:31.920 --> 03:40:36.720
So we didn't, that also extended when we could have

03:40:36.720 --> 03:40:38.800
all the data available.

03:40:38.800 --> 03:40:40.880
And we worked through the fall.

03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:43.560
So we did not publicly release our data

03:40:43.560 --> 03:40:46.720
until January 7th of 2022.

03:40:46.760 --> 03:40:50.600
So all the delays did not give us the information

03:40:50.600 --> 03:40:55.120
in a timely manner to be able to submit the waiver.

03:40:58.080 --> 03:41:00.000
And I think the Department of Education

03:41:00.000 --> 03:41:02.240
will understand all of that because there were states

03:41:02.240 --> 03:41:04.080
across the country that were urged

03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:05.520
to extend their testing windows

03:41:05.520 --> 03:41:07.960
if that would be enabling for the field.

03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:11.680
So we're not alone in that circumstance.

03:41:11.680 --> 03:41:12.520
That's right.

03:41:12.520 --> 03:41:14.640
Any other clarifying questions?

03:41:16.800 --> 03:41:18.680
All right, is there any public comment?

03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:23.240
We do not have anybody in the queue

03:41:23.240 --> 03:41:25.800
for public comments for this item.

03:41:25.800 --> 03:41:28.720
All right, since there's no public comment,

03:41:28.720 --> 03:41:31.280
we can see if there's any further board discussion.

03:41:33.320 --> 03:41:35.800
And if there is no further board discussion,

03:41:35.800 --> 03:41:37.480
we can take a motion.

03:41:40.400 --> 03:41:43.960
And maybe Mal, you wanna, oh, yes, Member McClellan.

03:41:43.960 --> 03:41:45.560
Yes, just to follow up.

03:41:45.560 --> 03:41:47.160
Thank you for this presentation.

03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:50.400
Very technical, a lot of information there.

03:41:51.400 --> 03:41:52.880
So there have been other states

03:41:52.880 --> 03:41:55.520
who have been already granted extensions

03:41:55.520 --> 03:41:57.640
and waivers in this area.

03:41:57.640 --> 03:41:59.200
That was kind of one of my questions.

03:41:59.200 --> 03:42:00.040
Thank you.

03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:03.360
Yes, in terms of submitting them,

03:42:03.360 --> 03:42:05.200
I don't know whether they are approved,

03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:06.760
but yes, it's a process

03:42:06.760 --> 03:42:10.760
that the U.S. Department of Education has available.

03:42:10.800 --> 03:42:14.720
So it depends on state's readiness.

03:42:14.720 --> 03:42:16.920
They submit it when they can.

03:42:17.920 --> 03:42:20.200
Yeah, and the point I was making was simply

03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:23.320
that many states did extend their testing windows

03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:25.080
last year as we did.

03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:27.480
And so then you can't calculate

03:42:27.480 --> 03:42:30.960
what your percentage of engagement was until later.

03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:33.200
And so we will not be alone in that,

03:42:33.200 --> 03:42:35.520
but we don't know whether anybody else

03:42:35.520 --> 03:42:36.600
has been granted a waiver,

03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:38.680
but the department will not be surprised

03:42:39.040 --> 03:42:41.920
by these kinds of requests.

03:42:44.640 --> 03:42:48.040
Any other discussion questions or comments?

03:42:51.480 --> 03:42:53.640
All right, do we have a motion

03:42:53.640 --> 03:42:57.240
to accept the board's recommendation

03:42:57.240 --> 03:42:59.040
or the department's recommendation?

03:43:01.720 --> 03:43:04.840
I'll move to accept the recommendation on the screen.

03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:08.400
All right, and a second?

03:43:08.920 --> 03:43:10.080
I second.

03:43:10.080 --> 03:43:11.280
Thank you.

03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:12.760
Any further discussion?

03:43:13.800 --> 03:43:16.000
Brooks, can you call the roll for the vote?

03:43:17.240 --> 03:43:18.320
Member Rodriguez?

03:43:19.800 --> 03:43:20.760
Yes.

03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:22.920
Member Petillo-Brownson?

03:43:22.920 --> 03:43:23.760
Yes.

03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:24.680
Member McQuillan?

03:43:26.200 --> 03:43:27.040
Yes.

03:43:27.040 --> 03:43:29.360
Member Orozco-Gonzalez?

03:43:29.360 --> 03:43:30.640
Yes.

03:43:30.640 --> 03:43:31.480
Member Olken?

03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:33.480
Member Lewis?

03:43:34.920 --> 03:43:36.320
Yes.

03:43:36.320 --> 03:43:37.720
Vice President Glover-Woods?

03:43:38.720 --> 03:43:39.920
Yes.

03:43:39.920 --> 03:43:40.760
Member Escobedo?

03:43:41.880 --> 03:43:43.160
Yes.

03:43:43.160 --> 03:43:44.960
President Darling-Hammond?

03:43:44.960 --> 03:43:45.840
Yes.

03:43:45.840 --> 03:43:46.680
Member Bonacca?

03:43:47.920 --> 03:43:49.080
Aye.

03:43:49.080 --> 03:43:49.960
Motion carries.

03:43:51.640 --> 03:43:54.000
All right, thank you very much.

03:43:54.000 --> 03:43:57.120
We're gonna move right on ahead into item five.

03:43:57.120 --> 03:44:00.280
Item five is the Eagle Collegiate Academy.

03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:02.880
We are to consider evidence regarding a notice

03:44:02.880 --> 03:44:05.160
of violation issued by the California State Board

03:44:05.200 --> 03:44:08.720
of Education pursuant to California Education Code

03:44:08.720 --> 03:44:13.240
Section 47607G, and we will consider issuing a notice

03:44:13.240 --> 03:44:16.840
of intent to revoke with notice of facts pursuant

03:44:16.840 --> 03:44:21.840
to California Education Code Section 47607H.

03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:25.640
And I'm gonna allow Stephanie Farland of the CDE

03:44:25.640 --> 03:44:29.800
to present the recommendation and the background.

03:44:31.080 --> 03:44:33.520
President Darling-Hammond, I think we need just a moment here

03:44:33.520 --> 03:44:35.240
for Ms. Farland to connect.

03:44:36.120 --> 03:44:37.800
All right, we will.

03:44:56.720 --> 03:44:57.560
There we go.

03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:04.360
Thank you.

03:45:33.560 --> 03:45:35.000
Oh, cool, and your hand is still up.

03:45:35.000 --> 03:45:37.480
Is that just left over from before?

03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:40.000
There we go.

03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:40.840
Thanks.

03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:41.800
For stretching my arm.

03:45:44.280 --> 03:45:45.440
Figuratively.

03:45:45.440 --> 03:45:48.520
President Darling-Hammond, I believe we're ready to proceed.

03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:51.320
All right, Stephanie, please proceed.

03:45:55.400 --> 03:45:56.240
Thank you.

03:45:57.120 --> 03:46:00.360
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, board members,

03:46:00.360 --> 03:46:02.080
Chief Deputy Mary Nicely.

03:46:02.200 --> 03:46:03.720
Good to see all of you.

03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:11.120
Today we are onto item five, and this item consists

03:46:12.000 --> 03:46:14.640
of the consideration of evidence regarding the notice

03:46:14.640 --> 03:46:18.280
of violation that was issued to Eagle Collegiate Academy

03:46:18.280 --> 03:46:20.040
by the California State Board of Education

03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:22.480
on January 12th, 2022.

03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:27.600
CDE recommends that the state board issue a notice

03:46:27.600 --> 03:46:30.840
of intent to revoke and notice of facts in support

03:46:30.840 --> 03:46:33.840
of the revocation of Eagle Collegiate Academy

03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:34.680
charter school.

03:46:38.240 --> 03:46:40.680
Just a little background.

03:46:40.680 --> 03:46:44.640
At its July 8th, 9th, 2020 meeting,

03:46:44.640 --> 03:46:46.800
the state board approved the Eagle Collegiate

03:46:46.800 --> 03:46:50.400
charter petition on appeal with conditions

03:46:50.400 --> 03:46:52.480
to establish a new school within the boundaries

03:46:52.480 --> 03:46:55.400
of the Acton-Aguadose Unified School District

03:46:55.400 --> 03:46:58.800
with a scheduled opening date in 2021-22.

03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:02.080
So part of the conditions were that the school

03:47:02.080 --> 03:47:03.840
had an additional year to open.

03:47:05.440 --> 03:47:07.520
The charter petition stated its intention

03:47:07.520 --> 03:47:11.920
to serve 168 students in TK through grade three

03:47:11.920 --> 03:47:13.880
in its first year of operation.

03:47:16.960 --> 03:47:20.320
So here we have a timeline of board action.

03:47:22.240 --> 03:47:23.960
This means local and county boards.

03:47:23.960 --> 03:47:27.920
So we know November of 2019,

03:47:27.920 --> 03:47:30.280
the Eagle Collegiate Academy petition was denied

03:47:30.280 --> 03:47:33.240
by the Acton-Aguadose Unified School District

03:47:33.240 --> 03:47:35.560
by a vote of five to zero.

03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:39.120
It then went on appeal to the Los Angeles County

03:47:39.120 --> 03:47:42.080
Board of Education where they voted to deny

03:47:42.080 --> 03:47:43.600
on a vote of six to zero.

03:47:44.760 --> 03:47:48.400
It then came up to the State Board of Education on appeal.

03:47:48.400 --> 03:47:50.320
It was heard by the ACCS,

03:47:50.320 --> 03:47:52.520
the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools.

03:47:53.520 --> 03:47:56.960
And the ACCS concurred with CDE's recommendation

03:47:56.960 --> 03:47:59.840
to deny the Eagle Collegiate Academy petition

03:47:59.840 --> 03:48:02.640
by a vote of seven to one with one abstention.

03:48:03.680 --> 03:48:07.160
It then came to the board, State Board,

03:48:07.160 --> 03:48:09.720
where the State Board approved it with conditions

03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:12.480
to establish a new school within the boundaries

03:48:12.480 --> 03:48:15.400
of Acton-Aguadose School District.

03:48:15.400 --> 03:48:18.760
In September, the ECA opened virtually

03:48:18.760 --> 03:48:23.600
because they had yet to obtain a facility.

03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:27.160
On November 12th, 2021,

03:48:27.160 --> 03:48:29.840
the CDE sent a letter of concern

03:48:29.840 --> 03:48:31.560
to the Eagle Collegiate Academy.

03:48:32.720 --> 03:48:36.240
That letter of concern was based on a report

03:48:36.240 --> 03:48:39.920
that the school had only 12 students enrolled.

03:48:42.360 --> 03:48:44.840
That letter of concern then,

03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:47.880
on January 12th, the SBE issued a notice of violation

03:48:47.880 --> 03:48:51.720
as they didn't remedy the issues in the letter of concern.

03:48:51.720 --> 03:48:55.400
And on February 15th, the ACCS, as I stated earlier,

03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:57.360
concurred with the CDE's recommendation

03:48:57.360 --> 03:48:59.520
and unanimously voted to recommend

03:48:59.520 --> 03:49:02.960
that the SBE issue a notice of intent to revoke

03:49:02.960 --> 03:49:04.680
to Eagle Collegiate Academy.

03:49:06.480 --> 03:49:08.520
And just as some background,

03:49:08.520 --> 03:49:10.120
I know we have some new members today.

03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:12.560
So the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools

03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:15.280
is the Advisory Commission for this body,

03:49:15.280 --> 03:49:17.600
and they hear all of the charter items

03:49:17.600 --> 03:49:20.360
prior to the State Board hearing the items,

03:49:20.360 --> 03:49:22.920
and they issue their own recommendation,

03:49:22.920 --> 03:49:24.920
apart from the CDE's recommendation.

03:49:30.080 --> 03:49:33.080
And to go over what are the grounds

03:49:33.080 --> 03:49:35.440
for revocation of a charter school.

03:49:35.440 --> 03:49:40.440
Per Education Code 47607F, a charter may be revoked

03:49:40.520 --> 03:49:42.480
if substantial evidence indicates

03:49:42.480 --> 03:49:45.400
that the charter school did any of the following.

03:49:45.400 --> 03:49:48.480
Committed a material violation of any of the conditions,

03:49:48.480 --> 03:49:51.160
standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.

03:49:52.160 --> 03:49:55.120
Failed to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes

03:49:55.120 --> 03:49:57.240
identified in the charter.

03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:00.440
Failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles

03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:03.160
or engage in fiscal mismanagement,

03:50:03.160 --> 03:50:04.840
or violation of any law.

03:50:09.200 --> 03:50:12.280
So there is a process outlined in Ed Code

03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:13.920
for revocation.

03:50:13.920 --> 03:50:16.680
This process is not something that the department

03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:20.880
creates, we go by the Ed Code.

03:50:20.880 --> 03:50:24.520
So pursuant to 47607G, before revocation,

03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:27.440
a chartering authority shall notify the charter school

03:50:27.440 --> 03:50:29.440
of any violation and give the school

03:50:29.440 --> 03:50:31.560
an opportunity to remedy the violation.

03:50:32.720 --> 03:50:35.440
On January 12th, the SBE, 2022,

03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:38.920
the SBE issued that notice of violation to ECA

03:50:38.920 --> 03:50:41.120
and provided the school a reasonable opportunity

03:50:41.120 --> 03:50:42.600
to remedy the violations.

03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:46.760
ECA had failed to adequately refute remedy

03:50:46.760 --> 03:50:49.480
or propose to remedy the violations described

03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:50.920
in the notice of violation.

03:50:56.120 --> 03:51:00.040
Pursuant to Ed Code 47607H, before revoking a charter

03:51:00.040 --> 03:51:01.840
for failure to remedy a violation,

03:51:01.840 --> 03:51:03.600
the chartering authority shall provide

03:51:03.600 --> 03:51:05.760
a written notice of intent to revoke,

03:51:05.760 --> 03:51:08.040
and notice of facts in support of revocation

03:51:08.040 --> 03:51:09.520
to the charter school.

03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:11.520
And that's what we are doing today.

03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:14.120
At today's meeting, the SBE will consider the evidence

03:51:14.120 --> 03:51:15.760
regarding the notice of violation

03:51:15.760 --> 03:51:17.880
and decide whether to issue a notice of intent

03:51:17.880 --> 03:51:20.160
to revoke and notice of facts in support

03:51:20.160 --> 03:51:22.040
of the revocation of ECA charter.

03:51:30.400 --> 03:51:33.960
Pursuant, and then the final step, is the public hearing.

03:51:33.960 --> 03:51:37.360
So pursuant to Ed Code section 47607H,

03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:39.560
no later than 30 days after providing that notice

03:51:39.560 --> 03:51:41.760
of intent to revoke, the chartering authority

03:51:41.760 --> 03:51:43.960
shall hold a public hearing regarding whether

03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:45.960
evidence exists to revoke the charter.

03:51:47.520 --> 03:51:49.400
No later than 30 days, the chartering authority

03:51:49.400 --> 03:51:51.280
shall issue a final decision to revoke

03:51:51.280 --> 03:51:53.040
or decline to revoke the charter.

03:51:54.120 --> 03:51:56.040
The chartering authority shall not revoke a charter

03:51:56.040 --> 03:51:58.080
unless it makes written factual findings

03:51:58.080 --> 03:52:00.680
supported by substantial evidence.

03:52:00.680 --> 03:52:03.440
At tomorrow's March 10th, 2022 meeting,

03:52:03.440 --> 03:52:05.960
the SBE may decide to hold a public hearing

03:52:05.960 --> 03:52:08.280
to consider the revocation of ECA charter

03:52:08.280 --> 03:52:10.880
and issue a final decision to revoke

03:52:10.880 --> 03:52:12.640
or decline to revoke the charter.

03:52:17.160 --> 03:52:20.640
The CDE's recommendation is that the State Board

03:52:20.640 --> 03:52:23.480
issue a notice of intent to revoke

03:52:23.480 --> 03:52:27.480
and notice of facts to ECA pursuant to Ed Code 47607H.

03:52:29.240 --> 03:52:32.080
The CDE will provide substantial evidence

03:52:32.080 --> 03:52:34.520
that ECA has committed the following.

03:52:34.520 --> 03:52:37.680
Fiscal mismanagement, violation of several conditions,

03:52:37.680 --> 03:52:40.360
standards or procedures set forth in the charter,

03:52:40.360 --> 03:52:42.000
and violation of provisions of law.

03:52:43.720 --> 03:52:47.320
At its February 15th, 2022 meeting,

03:52:47.320 --> 03:52:50.160
the ACCS concurred with the CDE's recommendation

03:52:50.160 --> 03:52:52.480
and unanimously voted to recommend

03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:55.120
that the SBE issue a notice of intent to revoke.

03:52:59.240 --> 03:53:02.120
Just as a summary of the ACCS meeting

03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:04.320
and the discussion that took place,

03:53:05.880 --> 03:53:09.680
ACCS expressed its concerns with EGLE Collegiate,

03:53:09.680 --> 03:53:12.720
which were primarily focused on the following.

03:53:12.720 --> 03:53:14.760
Failure to meet enrollment projections,

03:53:14.760 --> 03:53:17.000
significant overstaffing,

03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:19.880
fiscally insolvent beyond recovery,

03:53:19.880 --> 03:53:21.920
and inability to implement the program.

03:53:26.880 --> 03:53:29.360
So now we'll move into the instances of violation.

03:53:30.360 --> 03:53:33.160
The instances of violation that we have found

03:53:33.160 --> 03:53:34.680
are fiscal mismanagement,

03:53:35.640 --> 03:53:38.520
the budget is based on unrealistic enrollment,

03:53:38.520 --> 03:53:41.040
and there is a projected fiscal insolvency.

03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:44.000
There were material violations

03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:47.440
based on Ed Code section 47607F1,

03:53:47.440 --> 03:53:49.960
failure to maintain adequate budget reserves,

03:53:49.960 --> 03:53:53.920
failure to timely acquire appropriate facilities,

03:53:53.920 --> 03:53:57.080
and a change to a non-classroom based educational program.

03:53:58.080 --> 03:54:01.400
And then the violations of law

03:54:01.400 --> 03:54:04.120
would be the inadequate budget reserves

03:54:04.120 --> 03:54:06.960
and non-compliant independent study written agreements.

03:54:12.120 --> 03:54:14.160
We're gonna start with the fiscal mismanagement

03:54:14.160 --> 03:54:15.880
because I'm sure as you read in the item,

03:54:15.880 --> 03:54:19.280
this is the most serious of the violations

03:54:19.280 --> 03:54:23.160
and the violation that really cannot be remedied

03:54:23.160 --> 03:54:24.000
at this time.

03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:27.120
As cited in the Notice of Violation,

03:54:27.120 --> 03:54:29.880
ECA based and continues to base its budget

03:54:29.880 --> 03:54:31.800
on an unrealistic enrollment.

03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:35.160
And we have here just a little timeline

03:54:35.160 --> 03:54:37.800
of the enrollment of ECA.

03:54:37.800 --> 03:54:39.360
When they were approved,

03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:42.840
they outlined a prospective enrollment of 168 students.

03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:45.200
In May of 2021,

03:54:45.200 --> 03:54:48.680
ECA reported a prospective enrollment of 131 students.

03:54:50.280 --> 03:54:53.000
ECA reported an estimated October enrollment

03:54:53.200 --> 03:54:56.000
of 168 students via the pupil estimates

03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:00.320
for new or significantly expanding charters, PENSEC.

03:55:00.320 --> 03:55:02.960
And that is the way that new charters project

03:55:02.960 --> 03:55:05.720
how many students they'll have enrolled

03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:10.720
and that is what their LCFF is based on, their projection.

03:55:12.240 --> 03:55:14.040
In September of 2021,

03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:16.000
ECA communicated that the school began

03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:18.360
with an enrollment of 131 students.

03:55:19.800 --> 03:55:22.360
In the beginning of November 2021,

03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:26.760
ECA reported a total enrollment of 12 students

03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:29.520
via the charter school 20 day attendance report.

03:55:31.360 --> 03:55:33.000
Once we saw that report

03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:34.960
and saw that they only had 12 students,

03:55:34.960 --> 03:55:37.480
we immediately sent a letter of concern to the school

03:55:37.480 --> 03:55:38.560
in early November.

03:55:41.080 --> 03:55:43.400
As of today or as of February,

03:55:43.400 --> 03:55:44.920
but I believe as of today,

03:55:44.920 --> 03:55:49.400
the reported ADA continues to be 12 students.

03:55:53.360 --> 03:55:56.960
So ECA responded to this violation

03:55:56.960 --> 03:55:59.160
and I will go over ECA's response

03:55:59.160 --> 03:56:02.000
and then our response to their response.

03:56:02.000 --> 03:56:04.800
So ECA responded to this violation

03:56:04.800 --> 03:56:07.040
by providing CDE a revised budget.

03:56:08.160 --> 03:56:11.360
Their revised budget included their projection

03:56:11.360 --> 03:56:16.360
of enrolling 45 new students by April 19th, 2022.

03:56:18.480 --> 03:56:20.400
ECA stated that it anticipates

03:56:20.400 --> 03:56:21.760
that these students will enroll

03:56:21.760 --> 03:56:23.280
once a facility is secured.

03:56:25.960 --> 03:56:28.520
That would give them a total of 57 students.

03:56:28.520 --> 03:56:30.080
With 57 students enrolled,

03:56:30.080 --> 03:56:34.200
ECA anticipates having an ADA of 27.53,

03:56:34.200 --> 03:56:36.920
which reduces this local control funding formula

03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:41.920
over payment from 497,000 to 329,000

03:56:42.120 --> 03:56:45.000
for fiscal year 2021-22.

03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:47.720
Their revised budget also includes

03:56:47.720 --> 03:56:49.160
decreased enrollment projections

03:56:49.160 --> 03:56:52.120
over the next couple of years from where they started out.

03:56:56.080 --> 03:56:58.720
Our analysis of that revised budget

03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:02.200
that came in post notice of violation

03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:08.960
is that even if we used ECA's own projections,

03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:10.480
which we disagree with,

03:57:10.480 --> 03:57:12.800
we don't believe that they would be able

03:57:12.800 --> 03:57:16.320
to get 57 students by next month.

03:57:17.080 --> 03:57:18.680
We're in March of a school year.

03:57:20.560 --> 03:57:23.760
But even if we went with their projections,

03:57:23.760 --> 03:57:26.560
they still maintain a negative ending fund balance

03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:29.960
of 302,000 at the end of fiscal year 2021-22.

03:57:30.880 --> 03:57:35.880
We also still believe that the projected enrollment

03:57:36.640 --> 03:57:39.480
they have for the next two years, fiscal years,

03:57:39.480 --> 03:57:41.600
are unrealistic and inconsistent,

03:57:41.600 --> 03:57:43.600
not only with their own growth patterns,

03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:46.040
but with growth patterns in other charter schools.

03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:51.880
As stated in the notice of violation,

03:57:52.280 --> 03:57:55.080
ECA based its fiscal solvency

03:57:55.080 --> 03:57:58.080
on an unrealistic and overestimated enrollment.

03:57:59.040 --> 03:58:01.880
ECA responded to this violation, as I said,

03:58:01.880 --> 03:58:03.480
by providing a revised budget.

03:58:06.200 --> 03:58:08.440
With their own projections,

03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:11.520
they estimate that they'll have an ending cash balance

03:58:11.520 --> 03:58:15.800
of $4,000 for fiscal year 2021-22.

03:58:16.320 --> 03:58:21.320
Our analysis of their revised budget

03:58:22.920 --> 03:58:25.800
is that ECA is not fiscally sustainable.

03:58:27.480 --> 03:58:31.480
ECA's revised budget includes a deficit of $282,497

03:58:32.920 --> 03:58:36.240
and a negative ending fund balance of 302,000.

03:58:37.640 --> 03:58:41.680
They also project that their public charter school

03:58:41.680 --> 03:58:46.280
grant program funds will be allocated to them.

03:58:47.120 --> 03:58:49.440
Their public charter school grant program funds

03:58:49.440 --> 03:58:51.200
currently are on a payment hold.

03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:53.440
There is an enrollment minimum

03:58:54.560 --> 03:58:57.200
in order to receive and participate

03:58:57.200 --> 03:59:00.440
in the federal public charter school grant program.

03:59:00.440 --> 03:59:02.720
They are nowhere near that minimum,

03:59:02.720 --> 03:59:05.680
and they would have to be up to 75 students

03:59:05.680 --> 03:59:07.160
by the end of the school year

03:59:07.160 --> 03:59:11.680
in order for the department to reissue

03:59:11.680 --> 03:59:13.920
any money from those funds.

03:59:13.920 --> 03:59:16.760
They are unlikely, that grant, oops, sorry,

03:59:16.760 --> 03:59:19.600
went forward faster than I wanted to.

03:59:19.600 --> 03:59:23.080
Those funds are unlikely to be restarted for the school.

03:59:24.200 --> 03:59:28.560
In addition, ECA includes in their budget,

03:59:28.560 --> 03:59:29.520
proposed budget,

03:59:29.520 --> 03:59:32.560
elementary and secondary school emergency relief funds,

03:59:32.560 --> 03:59:35.120
we know them as ESSER funds,

03:59:35.120 --> 03:59:38.360
and ECA is not eligible for those funds

03:59:38.360 --> 03:59:40.280
this year or next year,

03:59:40.280 --> 03:59:45.280
as they do not have enough FRPM students enrolled this year,

03:59:45.640 --> 03:59:47.040
they need at least 37,

03:59:47.040 --> 03:59:49.760
and as I said, they only have 12 students total,

03:59:50.960 --> 03:59:52.280
to be eligible.

03:59:52.280 --> 03:59:57.040
And so we did verify that yesterday with our ESSER folks

03:59:57.040 --> 03:59:59.480
that they will not be eligible for that funding.

04:00:00.880 --> 04:00:04.440
So ECA has failed to take steps to balance its budget

04:00:04.440 --> 04:00:07.560
also by adequately reducing expenditures.

04:00:08.400 --> 04:00:11.040
And that is something that the ACCS discussed

04:00:11.040 --> 04:00:14.360
in their meeting in terms of over staffing.

04:00:14.360 --> 04:00:16.840
They have four and a half staff for 12 kids.

04:00:17.760 --> 04:00:21.920
So really we feel like they have failed

04:00:21.920 --> 04:00:24.080
to take the steps to balance their budget.

04:00:29.960 --> 04:00:33.520
So the CDE's practice is to evaluate fiscal solvency

04:00:33.520 --> 04:00:36.120
based on a school's actual enrollment.

04:00:36.120 --> 04:00:38.960
So the budgets that were submitted by ECA

04:00:38.960 --> 04:00:43.040
are based on the enrollment they project they will have

04:00:43.040 --> 04:00:44.400
by the middle of April.

04:00:45.200 --> 04:00:49.720
Our analysis is based on their actual enrollment

04:00:49.720 --> 04:00:50.960
of 12 students.

04:00:51.800 --> 04:00:54.680
Based on those 12, of enrolling only 12 students,

04:00:54.680 --> 04:00:59.680
the CDE estimates that ECA's LCF repayment

04:00:59.680 --> 04:01:03.400
will be 497,973.

04:01:04.280 --> 04:01:07.240
And I don't know that I mentioned this before,

04:01:07.240 --> 04:01:09.880
but the reason we keep talking about repayment

04:01:09.880 --> 04:01:14.560
is the first LCFF payment that ECA received

04:01:14.560 --> 04:01:19.040
was based on their 168 projection enrollment

04:01:19.040 --> 04:01:20.560
during the PENSEC.

04:01:20.560 --> 04:01:24.200
So they received that money, but they only had 12 students.

04:01:24.200 --> 04:01:28.320
So they were overpaid by almost half a million dollars.

04:01:29.120 --> 04:01:32.560
And that money is owed back to the state.

04:01:32.560 --> 04:01:33.920
So I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear,

04:01:33.920 --> 04:01:35.360
but when we talk about repayment,

04:01:35.360 --> 04:01:38.760
it is the LCFF repayment, overpayment that was given

04:01:38.760 --> 04:01:40.560
to them earlier this school year.

04:01:44.480 --> 04:01:46.520
In the ECA's report, you will notice

04:01:46.520 --> 04:01:51.520
that they have discussed having a repayment plan

04:01:51.880 --> 04:01:53.160
for that overpayment.

04:01:54.120 --> 04:01:56.840
They put in their budget that they could repay

04:01:56.840 --> 04:01:59.320
that overpayment over the next two years.

04:01:59.320 --> 04:02:01.600
And I wanna be really clear that a charter school

04:02:01.600 --> 04:02:03.920
cannot dictate a repayment plan

04:02:03.920 --> 04:02:06.040
for an overpayment of apportionment.

04:02:06.040 --> 04:02:08.960
And the CDE nor the SBE have the authority

04:02:08.960 --> 04:02:13.720
to grant a repayment plan for charter school overpayments.

04:02:13.720 --> 04:02:16.040
So the school will be invoiced

04:02:16.040 --> 04:02:19.960
and they will be required to pay that invoice at once.

04:02:21.480 --> 04:02:23.960
ECA may have a negative ending cash balance

04:02:23.960 --> 04:02:28.960
of $488,353 by June of 2022.

04:02:29.720 --> 04:02:32.480
ECA will fail to meet its financial obligations

04:02:32.480 --> 04:02:34.000
by May of 2022.

04:02:34.840 --> 04:02:38.120
And financial obligations obviously include

04:02:38.120 --> 04:02:40.240
teacher salaries, teacher health benefits,

04:02:40.240 --> 04:02:41.200
teacher retirement.

04:02:42.360 --> 04:02:43.720
If operations continue,

04:02:43.720 --> 04:02:46.440
apportionment payments begin in July 2022

04:02:46.440 --> 04:02:50.640
will also be offset to recover any remaining LCFF payments,

04:02:50.640 --> 04:02:54.160
which means that even if the school stays open,

04:02:54.160 --> 04:02:57.240
they will not receive any new LCFF funding

04:02:57.240 --> 04:03:00.880
even next year until that overpayment is made

04:03:00.880 --> 04:03:01.800
back to the state.

04:03:06.200 --> 04:03:08.720
So this chart just sort of puts it out in black and white

04:03:08.720 --> 04:03:13.440
on a chart of what our analysis is of their cash balance

04:03:13.440 --> 04:03:14.680
and their ending fund balance

04:03:14.680 --> 04:03:17.200
at the end of the 21-22 fiscal year.

04:03:23.760 --> 04:03:25.680
On March 4th, which was last Friday,

04:03:25.680 --> 04:03:29.400
ECA submitted another revised budget to the CDE.

04:03:30.440 --> 04:03:33.760
We have conducted a preliminary review of that budget.

04:03:35.720 --> 04:03:37.320
It just came in on Friday,

04:03:37.320 --> 04:03:39.440
so we didn't have time to do a deep dive,

04:03:39.440 --> 04:03:42.000
but we did look at it quickly

04:03:42.000 --> 04:03:44.200
and based upon our preliminary review,

04:03:44.200 --> 04:03:48.600
the CDE finds that ECA remains fiscally unsustainable.

04:03:52.560 --> 04:03:54.960
So violations of the charter.

04:03:55.000 --> 04:03:57.400
Failure to maintain adequate budget reserves.

04:03:57.400 --> 04:03:58.920
As stated in the Notice of Violation,

04:03:58.920 --> 04:04:01.720
per the MOU between ECA and the State Board,

04:04:01.720 --> 04:04:03.440
ECA is expected to maintain reserves

04:04:03.440 --> 04:04:07.960
at 5% of expenditures or 71,000, whichever is greater.

04:04:08.920 --> 04:04:11.080
At the time of the Notice of Violation,

04:04:11.080 --> 04:04:14.560
the CDE projected ECA to have a negative ending fund balance

04:04:14.560 --> 04:04:18.480
of $1.2 million, so obviously there's not a reserve there.

04:04:19.560 --> 04:04:21.680
ECA responded to this violation

04:04:21.680 --> 04:04:23.640
by providing a revised budget,

04:04:23.640 --> 04:04:24.840
but their own projections

04:04:24.840 --> 04:04:27.720
end in a negative fund balance of $302,000,

04:04:27.720 --> 04:04:30.120
so obviously there's a difference there

04:04:30.120 --> 04:04:31.920
between our two analyses,

04:04:31.920 --> 04:04:34.680
but either way, they're in a negative fund balance.

04:04:37.400 --> 04:04:39.280
CDE analyzed the revised budget.

04:04:39.280 --> 04:04:40.800
Again, we find their projections

04:04:40.800 --> 04:04:43.760
to be based on unrealistic, unsubstantiated,

04:04:43.760 --> 04:04:46.400
and inflated enrollment for 21-22.

04:04:47.680 --> 04:04:50.800
And CDE projects that based on ECA's current enrollment

04:04:50.800 --> 04:04:52.000
of 12 students, they will have

04:04:52.000 --> 04:04:56.360
a negative ending fund balance of 598,000 by June 2022.

04:04:56.360 --> 04:04:58.680
And really, that actually is probably a little higher

04:04:58.680 --> 04:05:01.560
because we were including their ESSER funds

04:05:01.560 --> 04:05:02.880
in some of our analysis,

04:05:02.880 --> 04:05:03.960
but since we found out

04:05:03.960 --> 04:05:05.880
that they're not actually entitled to ESSER funds,

04:05:05.880 --> 04:05:07.760
those numbers go up just a little bit.

04:05:12.800 --> 04:05:15.760
Failure to acquire appropriate facilities.

04:05:15.760 --> 04:05:17.520
As stated in the Notice of Violation,

04:05:17.520 --> 04:05:21.000
ECA's charter required ECA school facilities

04:05:21.000 --> 04:05:25.680
to be completed and ready on or before May 28th, 2021.

04:05:25.680 --> 04:05:28.560
Remember, they were approved July, 2020.

04:05:28.560 --> 04:05:30.840
They were given an extra year to open,

04:05:32.400 --> 04:05:33.680
so they had an extra year

04:05:33.680 --> 04:05:37.160
to find an appropriate facility for their students.

04:05:37.160 --> 04:05:39.280
They failed to open a facility

04:05:39.280 --> 04:05:42.120
as a classroom-based charter school by the SBE approved date

04:05:42.120 --> 04:05:45.400
or before the start of the fiscal year 21-22.

04:05:45.400 --> 04:05:46.920
They started school on September 7th,

04:05:46.920 --> 04:05:48.680
they still did not have a facility.

04:05:49.680 --> 04:05:54.040
On December 6th, 2021, ECA informed the CDE

04:05:54.040 --> 04:05:56.280
after we had sent the letter of concern

04:05:56.280 --> 04:05:58.280
that it had obtained a short-term lease

04:05:58.280 --> 04:05:59.640
at a temporary facility.

04:06:01.080 --> 04:06:03.400
We expedited, we were down there within days,

04:06:03.400 --> 04:06:06.320
we expedited a visit to the facility

04:06:06.320 --> 04:06:09.080
and inspected it on December 16th

04:06:09.080 --> 04:06:11.680
and found the facility to be non-compliant.

04:06:12.920 --> 04:06:15.000
ECA responded to this violation

04:06:15.000 --> 04:06:16.440
by proposing to hold class

04:06:17.280 --> 04:06:19.360
in a different building

04:06:19.360 --> 04:06:21.800
located on the same property of the lease site.

04:06:23.600 --> 04:06:26.360
They notified us of that

04:06:26.360 --> 04:06:31.360
after the notice of violation was submitted

04:06:31.360 --> 04:06:35.800
or approved by the State Board of Education in January.

04:06:35.800 --> 04:06:38.840
So once again, we expedited a second visit

04:06:38.840 --> 04:06:40.280
to inspect the new building

04:06:40.280 --> 04:06:43.280
of the newly proposed facility on February 10th.

04:06:44.240 --> 04:06:46.760
The CDE pre-opening site inspection checklist

04:06:46.760 --> 04:06:49.160
for this newly proposed facility

04:06:49.160 --> 04:06:50.800
is linked under the documentation

04:06:50.800 --> 04:06:53.240
considered by the ACCS section in the item.

04:06:54.280 --> 04:06:56.600
What our facilities division found

04:06:57.720 --> 04:07:01.040
was that the facility was still out of compliance

04:07:01.040 --> 04:07:03.960
and we still had several outstanding concerns

04:07:03.960 --> 04:07:05.440
about that facility,

04:07:05.440 --> 04:07:07.280
which are all written in that report.

04:07:08.040 --> 04:07:13.040
Additionally, the newly proposed facility

04:07:14.880 --> 04:07:18.760
is located within two nautical miles of an airport runway.

04:07:20.040 --> 04:07:22.800
Pursuant to Ed Code 17215,

04:07:22.800 --> 04:07:26.280
before acquiring Title II or leasing property

04:07:26.280 --> 04:07:28.000
for a new school site,

04:07:28.000 --> 04:07:30.640
a charter school shall give the CDE written notice

04:07:30.640 --> 04:07:32.720
of the proposed acquisition or lease

04:07:32.720 --> 04:07:35.960
and shall submit any information required by the CDE

04:07:35.960 --> 04:07:40.080
if the site is within two miles measured by airline

04:07:40.080 --> 04:07:42.000
of that point on an airport runway

04:07:42.000 --> 04:07:43.440
that is nearest to the site.

04:07:44.440 --> 04:07:48.560
Pursuant to the same Ed Code 17215C,

04:07:48.560 --> 04:07:51.400
the California Department of Transportation, Caltrans,

04:07:51.400 --> 04:07:55.680
is required to evaluate that proposed K-12 school site

04:07:55.680 --> 04:07:57.680
as they are any K-12 school site

04:07:57.680 --> 04:08:00.520
that are within two nautical miles of an airport runway.

04:08:01.520 --> 04:08:04.080
So to be clear,

04:08:06.240 --> 04:08:09.600
Eagle Collegiate Academy did not do its due diligence.

04:08:09.600 --> 04:08:11.880
The school is required to submit this information

04:08:11.880 --> 04:08:14.360
prior to leasing the property

04:08:14.360 --> 04:08:19.360
and prior to using any public funds for that property.

04:08:20.160 --> 04:08:21.360
This did not happen.

04:08:22.960 --> 04:08:26.640
Once we learned that there was an airport runway

04:08:26.640 --> 04:08:29.760
within two nautical miles of that charter,

04:08:29.800 --> 04:08:34.800
CDE submitted a request for this evaluation to Caltrans.

04:08:35.520 --> 04:08:39.920
We are in the process of their review

04:08:39.920 --> 04:08:44.360
and have not received any formal letter

04:08:44.360 --> 04:08:46.640
approving that process.

04:08:48.920 --> 04:08:50.880
So students cannot occupy the site

04:08:50.880 --> 04:08:53.480
until the Caltrans findings are officially reported.

04:08:53.480 --> 04:08:58.480
In addition, the facility is insufficient

04:09:03.280 --> 04:09:06.600
to accommodate ECA's projected student enrollment.

04:09:06.600 --> 04:09:10.560
So if they get the approval from Caltrans

04:09:10.560 --> 04:09:13.760
and they remedy the deficiencies

04:09:13.760 --> 04:09:16.760
that CDE still has with the site,

04:09:16.760 --> 04:09:20.560
the site will only hold a maximum of 34 students

04:09:20.560 --> 04:09:23.320
and ECA is projecting, as I said earlier,

04:09:24.160 --> 04:09:26.200
a minimum of 57 by the end of this school year.

04:09:28.000 --> 04:09:29.560
So the newly proposed facility

04:09:29.560 --> 04:09:32.320
will not accommodate this projected enrollment level,

04:09:32.320 --> 04:09:34.600
even if it becomes compliant.

04:09:37.240 --> 04:09:40.640
And the facility is a temporary lease, as I said earlier.

04:09:40.640 --> 04:09:42.280
The facility is only leased

04:09:42.280 --> 04:09:44.080
through the end of this school year

04:09:44.080 --> 04:09:47.480
and the school does not have a site for next year.

04:09:53.760 --> 04:09:56.240
As outlined in the notice of violation,

04:09:56.240 --> 04:09:58.560
ECA's petition outlines a classroom-based

04:09:58.560 --> 04:10:02.320
international baccalaureate educational program.

04:10:02.320 --> 04:10:04.280
However, ECA has reported that its students

04:10:04.280 --> 04:10:06.120
are receiving online instruction only

04:10:06.120 --> 04:10:07.360
via independent study.

04:10:08.520 --> 04:10:10.200
ECA responded to this violation

04:10:10.200 --> 04:10:12.160
by stating that its curriculum has not changed,

04:10:12.160 --> 04:10:14.280
it has been forced to conduct instruction virtually

04:10:14.280 --> 04:10:16.560
due to challenges in obtaining a facility.

04:10:16.560 --> 04:10:18.160
We're not disagreeing with that,

04:10:18.160 --> 04:10:21.360
but it is a violation of their petition

04:10:21.360 --> 04:10:23.280
in that they were only approved

04:10:23.280 --> 04:10:27.560
for an online, for an in-classroom-based IB program.

04:10:29.760 --> 04:10:31.920
And as we know, online and remote instruction

04:10:31.920 --> 04:10:34.240
significantly changes the way an education program

04:10:34.240 --> 04:10:36.200
is delivered and received by students.

04:10:43.560 --> 04:10:45.760
Violation of law, we stated earlier,

04:10:45.760 --> 04:10:47.440
inadequate budget reserves.

04:10:48.360 --> 04:10:51.480
And I stated all of this earlier,

04:10:51.480 --> 04:10:53.040
but just to go over it again,

04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:55.440
ECA is expected to maintain reserves

04:10:55.440 --> 04:10:59.360
at 5% of expenditures, whichever is greater.

04:10:59.360 --> 04:11:00.760
They've only been open this school year,

04:11:00.760 --> 04:11:02.280
but out during that time,

04:11:02.280 --> 04:11:05.640
they have not been able to meet this requirement.

04:11:10.120 --> 04:11:12.800
A second issue, violation of law,

04:11:12.800 --> 04:11:14.480
was their non-compliant independent study

04:11:14.480 --> 04:11:15.560
written agreements.

04:11:16.520 --> 04:11:20.360
Because they were an online program,

04:11:20.360 --> 04:11:23.480
or have been, or continue to be for this school year,

04:11:23.480 --> 04:11:25.040
they were required by law

04:11:25.040 --> 04:11:28.600
to have independent study written agreements

04:11:28.600 --> 04:11:30.800
with each of the students and families.

04:11:33.760 --> 04:11:35.080
In our notice of violation,

04:11:35.080 --> 04:11:37.680
we stated that ECA's independent study

04:11:37.680 --> 04:11:39.640
written agreements were non-compliant.

04:11:41.240 --> 04:11:42.880
They responded to this violation

04:11:42.880 --> 04:11:44.400
by claiming that their independent study

04:11:44.400 --> 04:11:46.200
written agreements are compliant,

04:11:46.200 --> 04:11:47.480
and that the information was clearly

04:11:47.480 --> 04:11:49.040
communicated to families.

04:11:51.320 --> 04:11:53.360
We find that they have been out of compliance

04:11:53.360 --> 04:11:55.960
for the majority of the 21-22 school year.

04:11:57.760 --> 04:12:01.120
On February 25th, ECA did submit a draft

04:12:01.120 --> 04:12:03.760
of a revised independent study master agreement,

04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:06.800
showing that this violation has been partially cured.

04:12:06.800 --> 04:12:09.680
However, ECA still has not submitted

04:12:09.680 --> 04:12:11.600
revised independent study written agreements

04:12:11.600 --> 04:12:13.080
for each of the students signed

04:12:13.080 --> 04:12:16.960
as they're required to be by law to the CDE.

04:12:20.120 --> 04:12:23.280
The last issue in the notice of violation

04:12:23.280 --> 04:12:27.840
that we had pointed out was on December 1, 2021,

04:12:27.840 --> 04:12:28.840
the El Dorado Charter,

04:12:28.840 --> 04:12:31.560
Special Education Local Plan Area, SELPA,

04:12:31.560 --> 04:12:33.280
issued a formal notice of its concerns

04:12:33.280 --> 04:12:36.120
about ECA's ability to function as an LEA,

04:12:36.120 --> 04:12:37.640
in that ECA at that time

04:12:37.640 --> 04:12:39.880
had not set up a child fine process,

04:12:39.880 --> 04:12:41.920
and the SELPA was concerned that students with disabilities

04:12:41.920 --> 04:12:43.880
were not receiving their due services.

04:12:43.880 --> 04:12:44.960
However, since that time,

04:12:44.960 --> 04:12:46.200
the El Dorado Charter, SELPA,

04:12:46.200 --> 04:12:49.040
has confirmed that ECA has resolved the issue

04:12:49.040 --> 04:12:51.040
stated in the SELPA's letter of concern.

04:12:55.120 --> 04:12:57.080
So in summary, the CDE,

04:12:59.600 --> 04:13:01.160
the battery's running low here,

04:13:04.880 --> 04:13:08.160
the CDE concludes that there is no fiscal viability

04:13:08.160 --> 04:13:10.360
for ECA moving forward.

04:13:10.360 --> 04:13:11.560
Based on our analysis,

04:13:11.560 --> 04:13:14.520
the CDE estimates that ECA will have

04:13:14.520 --> 04:13:19.520
an estimated negative ending cash balance of 488,353,

04:13:19.600 --> 04:13:24.600
and a negative ending fund balance of 598,000 by June 2022.

04:13:25.720 --> 04:13:28.640
ECA will fail to meet its financial obligations,

04:13:28.640 --> 04:13:30.280
including, but not limited,

04:13:30.280 --> 04:13:33.760
to staff salaries, pension obligations, and benefits

04:13:33.760 --> 04:13:35.600
by May 2022,

04:13:35.600 --> 04:13:39.600
and payments beginning in July 2022, if there were any,

04:13:39.600 --> 04:13:43.360
would be offset to recover any remaining LCFF overpayment.

04:13:46.600 --> 04:13:48.600
So in conclusion, there is substantial evidence

04:13:48.600 --> 04:13:50.440
that ECA has committed the following,

04:13:50.440 --> 04:13:51.960
fiscal mismanagement,

04:13:51.960 --> 04:13:53.800
violation of several conditions, standards,

04:13:53.800 --> 04:13:55.800
or procedures set forth in the charter,

04:13:55.800 --> 04:13:58.400
violation of provisions of law.

04:13:58.400 --> 04:14:00.440
ECA has not adequately refuted,

04:14:00.440 --> 04:14:02.040
remedied, or proposed a plan

04:14:02.040 --> 04:14:04.240
to remedy the aforementioned violations.

04:14:05.120 --> 04:14:07.480
We are recommending that the State Board of Education

04:14:07.480 --> 04:14:09.360
issue a notice of intent to revoke,

04:14:09.360 --> 04:14:11.040
and notice of facts to ECA,

04:14:11.040 --> 04:14:14.160
pursuant to Ed Code section 47607H.

04:14:15.200 --> 04:14:16.680
At its February 15th meeting,

04:14:16.680 --> 04:14:19.280
the ACCA has concurred with the CDE's recommendation,

04:14:19.280 --> 04:14:21.720
and unanimously voted to recommend the same.

04:14:23.360 --> 04:14:26.240
The CDE has contacted the districts of residence

04:14:26.240 --> 04:14:29.080
for ECA's current students.

04:14:29.080 --> 04:14:31.040
All districts have confirmed in writing

04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:32.720
that they are prepared to provide

04:14:32.720 --> 04:14:34.440
appropriate educational placement

04:14:34.440 --> 04:14:37.560
of any student who resides within their district boundaries,

04:14:37.560 --> 04:14:38.560
and we also,

04:14:38.600 --> 04:14:39.920
and I'm sure you'll hear from them later,

04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:41.440
we also have that confirmation

04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:43.440
from the LA County Office of Education.

04:14:46.880 --> 04:14:48.680
And that concludes my presentation.

04:14:54.440 --> 04:14:55.280
I'm on mute.

04:14:55.280 --> 04:14:56.120
Thank you very much.

04:14:57.160 --> 04:14:59.880
At this point, we want to be able to hear

04:14:59.880 --> 04:15:02.280
from Dr. Ogo Okoye-Johnson,

04:15:02.280 --> 04:15:04.920
who is the CEO of Eagle Collegiate Academy.

04:15:05.920 --> 04:15:08.640
And Dr. Okoye-Johnson, please begin.

04:15:08.640 --> 04:15:10.360
You have about 10 minutes.

04:15:11.360 --> 04:15:13.760
Then we will take public comments after that.

04:15:34.920 --> 04:15:35.760
Okay.

04:15:58.080 --> 04:16:00.160
Dr. Okoye-Johnson?

04:16:00.240 --> 04:16:05.240
ECA is waiting for my slide to be uploaded.

04:16:06.040 --> 04:16:06.880
Thank you.

04:16:09.720 --> 04:16:13.280
By CDE, SBE, I submitted it to them,

04:16:13.280 --> 04:16:16.680
so once they start, I would start.

04:16:16.680 --> 04:16:17.600
Okay, thank you.

04:16:31.160 --> 04:16:32.000
All right.

04:16:33.720 --> 04:16:35.200
I think I can pull them up.

04:16:35.200 --> 04:16:36.760
Is that a P-H-S-D-E?

04:16:40.520 --> 04:16:42.520
I can see it in the folder.

04:17:00.160 --> 04:17:03.160
It looks like it's in a corrupted file.

04:17:09.520 --> 04:17:12.520
Dr. Okoye-Johnson, are you able to share from yours?

04:17:12.520 --> 04:17:14.400
The staff was not informed

04:17:14.400 --> 04:17:16.080
that we were to present from here,

04:17:16.080 --> 04:17:18.080
and so we've been expecting you to be sharing

04:17:18.080 --> 04:17:19.200
from your side, which you can do

04:17:19.200 --> 04:17:20.600
through your Zoom function.

04:17:23.560 --> 04:17:27.000
Yes, I could, but in the meeting that we had,

04:17:27.520 --> 04:17:29.720
I was told that if I submitted, then they would share it,

04:17:29.720 --> 04:17:32.720
but it's okay, I would have to pull it up.

04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:37.720
I was ready for that to be done by staff, so.

04:17:37.720 --> 04:17:38.960
We have a copy here we can open,

04:17:38.960 --> 04:17:40.240
if that's what you'd prefer?

04:17:41.480 --> 04:17:43.720
Well, that's what I thought we were doing,

04:17:43.720 --> 04:17:46.600
because that's why I sent it in, but I also have it.

04:17:46.600 --> 04:17:49.640
If you do it, then we're all on the same page.

04:17:49.640 --> 04:17:51.680
It looks like it's about to happen, so.

04:17:51.680 --> 04:17:52.520
Okay, we can open it.

04:17:52.520 --> 04:17:53.360
Thank you, ma'am.

04:17:53.360 --> 04:17:54.200
Thank you.

04:17:54.200 --> 04:17:56.160
All right, I think we have the slide.

04:17:58.960 --> 04:18:03.960
And Dr. Osorio, yes, go right ahead, please begin.

04:18:03.960 --> 04:18:04.960
Thank you, ma'am.

04:18:04.960 --> 04:18:07.200
Good afternoon, honorable Madam Board President

04:18:07.200 --> 04:18:11.720
Dr. Darlene Harmon, honorable board members, and CDE staff.

04:18:11.720 --> 04:18:14.160
My name is Dr. Ogokoye Johnson.

04:18:14.160 --> 04:18:16.200
I am the founder and the chief of staff

04:18:16.200 --> 04:18:19.200
of the Board of Trustees of the University of Michigan.

04:18:19.200 --> 04:18:21.200
I am the president of the Board of Trustees

04:18:21.200 --> 04:18:23.200
of the University of Michigan.

04:18:23.200 --> 04:18:25.280
I am the founder and the chief executive officer

04:18:25.280 --> 04:18:28.400
of Eagle Collegiate Academy, thanks to you.

04:18:28.400 --> 04:18:31.680
With me today, our legal expert, Ms. Rooley,

04:18:31.680 --> 04:18:34.040
and our fiscal expert, Mr. Adams.

04:18:34.040 --> 04:18:36.600
We are a K through eight public charter school,

04:18:36.600 --> 04:18:39.040
currently serving grades K through third,

04:18:39.040 --> 04:18:42.240
and are the first and only international baccalaureate

04:18:42.240 --> 04:18:44.440
primary years program candidate school,

04:18:44.440 --> 04:18:45.960
serving the Antelope Valley

04:18:45.960 --> 04:18:48.480
and the Santa Clarita Valley communities.

04:18:48.480 --> 04:18:51.640
On behalf of our entire ECA community,

04:18:51.640 --> 04:18:54.480
thank you for taking the time to hear us today.

04:18:54.480 --> 04:18:57.800
We are asking the State Board of Education, next slide,

04:18:57.800 --> 04:19:01.720
to delay action on a final decision

04:19:01.720 --> 04:19:04.160
to revoke the ECA charter.

04:19:04.160 --> 04:19:07.240
Such a delay is well within SBA's discretion,

04:19:07.240 --> 04:19:10.120
and it's consistent with its regulations on this topic.

04:19:10.120 --> 04:19:12.440
We are asking for the following reasons.

04:19:12.440 --> 04:19:14.840
To minimize the devastation and the disruption

04:19:14.840 --> 04:19:17.520
of the lives of the students and their families

04:19:17.520 --> 04:19:20.320
that will come with immediate school closure.

04:19:20.320 --> 04:19:23.240
To give ECA students time to use the facility

04:19:23.240 --> 04:19:26.720
that has been set up for them for in-person instruction,

04:19:26.720 --> 04:19:28.880
which has been so long promised,

04:19:28.880 --> 04:19:33.880
and which Caltrans has cleared and notified CDE via email

04:19:34.000 --> 04:19:36.200
that is clear to use.

04:19:36.200 --> 04:19:38.840
ECA has sufficient financial resources

04:19:38.840 --> 04:19:39.960
to finish out the school year,

04:19:39.960 --> 04:19:44.000
despite the CDE's assertion to the contrary.

04:19:44.000 --> 04:19:46.480
ECA will have the opportunity to receive

04:19:46.480 --> 04:19:49.480
its already approved public charter school grant program

04:19:49.480 --> 04:19:52.760
if we do get in person of $300,000,

04:19:52.760 --> 04:19:56.000
as long as we meet the program's enrollment threshold,

04:19:56.000 --> 04:19:58.320
which we believe we would need.

04:19:58.320 --> 04:20:03.320
To avoid losing ECA's hard fought for IB candidacy,

04:20:04.320 --> 04:20:07.360
to use the already paid for year-long instructional

04:20:07.360 --> 04:20:09.600
and intervention materials have been purchased

04:20:09.600 --> 04:20:11.600
that the students are using,

04:20:11.600 --> 04:20:14.120
and all our current families have re-enrolled

04:20:14.120 --> 04:20:15.760
for next school year,

04:20:15.760 --> 04:20:19.320
and new families have also enrolled of 92.

04:20:20.160 --> 04:20:21.800
Not only did the current families re-enroll

04:20:21.800 --> 04:20:22.800
their current students,

04:20:22.800 --> 04:20:25.840
they enroll some of their siblings as well.

04:20:25.840 --> 04:20:28.720
We are conducting a robust enrollment campaign,

04:20:28.720 --> 04:20:32.000
which includes email campaign, social media campaign,

04:20:32.000 --> 04:20:34.680
we've been doing this door-to-door campaign,

04:20:34.680 --> 04:20:36.760
and follow-up phone calls with families.

04:20:36.760 --> 04:20:39.000
Some families have taught the facility,

04:20:39.000 --> 04:20:42.400
and this is why we know that we have this enrollment.

04:20:42.400 --> 04:20:43.240
Next slide.

04:20:44.480 --> 04:20:46.800
As some of you know and remember,

04:20:46.800 --> 04:20:51.040
the State Board unanimously approved ECA's petition

04:20:51.040 --> 04:20:54.520
with conditions July 8th, with a one-year delayed opening.

04:20:55.480 --> 04:20:58.920
And because of the pandemic, this is why that happened.

04:20:58.920 --> 04:21:03.320
Our families and team were overjoyed at that prospect

04:21:03.320 --> 04:21:05.040
after fighting for four years

04:21:05.040 --> 04:21:07.840
to bring this excellent program to our communities.

04:21:07.840 --> 04:21:10.760
There was no way for anyone to predict

04:21:10.760 --> 04:21:14.400
that we will still be battling with the pandemic today.

04:21:14.440 --> 04:21:17.520
California was under the lockdown stay-at-home order

04:21:17.520 --> 04:21:19.440
from March 19, 2020,

04:21:19.440 --> 04:21:22.280
and never really fully opened until June 2021.

04:21:23.560 --> 04:21:26.400
ECA is caught in an impossible spiral.

04:21:26.400 --> 04:21:28.000
We cannot enroll more students

04:21:28.000 --> 04:21:30.480
until CDE approves our facility.

04:21:30.480 --> 04:21:32.400
ECA cannot repay its debt to the CDE

04:21:32.400 --> 04:21:35.400
until it can open our facility and enroll more students

04:21:35.400 --> 04:21:38.080
and get some of the funding that we have.

04:21:38.080 --> 04:21:41.280
So we are here today asking for a life raft

04:21:41.280 --> 04:21:43.160
to pull us out of this spiral.

04:21:43.160 --> 04:21:45.960
We ask for the sake of our Scholar Eagles,

04:21:45.960 --> 04:21:47.680
that's what we call our students,

04:21:47.680 --> 04:21:50.760
of our families and of our community

04:21:50.760 --> 04:21:53.560
to delay the final action on this revocation

04:21:53.560 --> 04:21:55.920
of ECA's hard fought charter.

04:21:55.920 --> 04:21:56.760
Next slide.

04:21:57.960 --> 04:22:00.520
We recognize the weightiness

04:22:00.520 --> 04:22:03.640
of this heartbreaking situation for the SBE,

04:22:03.640 --> 04:22:05.920
heartbreaking for the CDE

04:22:05.920 --> 04:22:09.920
and for our whole ECA community, it's heartbreaking.

04:22:09.920 --> 04:22:12.480
We appreciate all the work

04:22:12.480 --> 04:22:14.520
that CDE has done these two years

04:22:14.520 --> 04:22:17.960
to help us get started and running.

04:22:17.960 --> 04:22:20.240
But we have been shocked lately

04:22:20.240 --> 04:22:23.560
by their complete change in tone as of December.

04:22:23.560 --> 04:22:26.040
We have been upfront with the CDE

04:22:26.040 --> 04:22:28.040
since its charter was approved

04:22:28.040 --> 04:22:31.560
and there is no evidence of any intent

04:22:31.560 --> 04:22:34.040
by the ECA team, anyone,

04:22:34.040 --> 04:22:38.120
to provide CDE any incorrect information

04:22:38.120 --> 04:22:39.640
which CDE has alleged.

04:22:40.640 --> 04:22:45.160
On May 28th, 2021, we notified CDE

04:22:45.160 --> 04:22:47.640
that our facility was not ready at that time.

04:22:47.640 --> 04:22:50.240
So they knew and we shared that information

04:22:50.240 --> 04:22:52.840
in a written document that was submitted to you.

04:22:53.880 --> 04:22:56.520
In December, ECA received a phone call

04:22:56.520 --> 04:22:59.240
from the director of the CDE charter schools division.

04:23:00.240 --> 04:23:02.280
The director has never called.

04:23:02.280 --> 04:23:05.200
And so she explained that the CDE's intent

04:23:05.200 --> 04:23:08.840
is to prepare the SBE to revoke ECA's charter.

04:23:08.840 --> 04:23:11.200
And the director promised to send a link

04:23:11.200 --> 04:23:13.600
to a previous SBE charter revocation

04:23:13.600 --> 04:23:15.720
because she was not there at that time

04:23:15.720 --> 04:23:18.520
so that we can see it and see what we would have

04:23:18.520 --> 04:23:21.280
to go through and make a decision.

04:23:21.280 --> 04:23:24.280
But we never received that link.

04:23:25.600 --> 04:23:28.560
The director has fast-tracked this revocation process

04:23:28.560 --> 04:23:31.040
and has dismissed the genuine remedies

04:23:31.040 --> 04:23:33.440
and refutations that ECA has presented.

04:23:33.440 --> 04:23:35.320
We have told them, whatever you need us to do,

04:23:35.320 --> 04:23:37.440
we will do it, please tell us.

04:23:37.440 --> 04:23:41.000
And we have been distressed over the lack of consistency

04:23:41.000 --> 04:23:43.160
in communications from the CDE.

04:23:43.160 --> 04:23:45.480
For example, the CDE's facility

04:23:45.480 --> 04:23:48.240
and charter schools division staff told us verbally

04:23:48.240 --> 04:23:49.840
that the youth ministry would work.

04:23:49.840 --> 04:23:52.360
But then when we got the facility report,

04:23:52.360 --> 04:23:54.280
it said that it would not work.

04:23:54.280 --> 04:23:56.720
And then when they came in December,

04:23:56.720 --> 04:23:58.840
they indicated that the site was not near

04:23:58.840 --> 04:24:00.160
any airport runways,

04:24:00.160 --> 04:24:03.160
but then the February report states that it is.

04:24:03.160 --> 04:24:05.080
It feels as if though the goalposts

04:24:05.080 --> 04:24:07.800
are constantly being moved down the field.

04:24:07.800 --> 04:24:11.920
But thankfully Caltrans has notified CDE via email

04:24:11.920 --> 04:24:15.320
that the current church site has been cleared by Caltrans.

04:24:15.320 --> 04:24:18.320
It is now up to CDE to approve the site to be used.

04:24:20.880 --> 04:24:21.960
In July, next slide.

04:24:22.880 --> 04:24:27.000
In July, 2020, you gave us a chance to fulfill our calling

04:24:27.000 --> 04:24:30.760
and we stand before you or sit before you today,

04:24:30.760 --> 04:24:32.800
saying that we have done so.

04:24:32.800 --> 04:24:34.720
Maybe not with the number of students

04:24:35.360 --> 04:24:36.360
that we had wanted to,

04:24:36.360 --> 04:24:38.760
but all our families are happy

04:24:38.760 --> 04:24:40.480
and have re-enrolled for next school year

04:24:40.480 --> 04:24:42.920
in addition to new families.

04:24:42.920 --> 04:24:45.400
ECA students are thriving and showing growth

04:24:45.400 --> 04:24:49.840
based on teacher and NWEA map growth test,

04:24:49.840 --> 04:24:53.000
thereby meeting the learning outcomes of our charter.

04:24:53.000 --> 04:24:56.160
And we were in communication with IB

04:24:56.160 --> 04:24:57.920
throughout this process.

04:24:57.920 --> 04:25:00.240
Our team is confident it will increase its enrollment

04:25:00.240 --> 04:25:02.520
once it's allowed to start in-person instruction

04:25:02.520 --> 04:25:05.560
because we know our families, we know where they are,

04:25:05.560 --> 04:25:08.280
we have gone door to door to them

04:25:08.280 --> 04:25:11.200
and we put those systems in place to do so.

04:25:11.200 --> 04:25:14.760
Please allow us to fulfill what you allowed us to start.

04:25:14.760 --> 04:25:18.440
There is a great need for ECA in our communities

04:25:18.440 --> 04:25:21.240
and we can show that based on our enrollment campaign

04:25:21.240 --> 04:25:22.960
that we have been conducting.

04:25:22.960 --> 04:25:26.480
Revoking the ECA charter will only continue perpetuating

04:25:26.480 --> 04:25:30.160
the cycle of struggling communities being silenced,

04:25:30.160 --> 04:25:33.160
ignored instead of supported and void.

04:25:33.160 --> 04:25:36.200
We still have five years of our charter term left.

04:25:36.200 --> 04:25:38.280
We are literally new.

04:25:38.280 --> 04:25:40.960
Please allow us to prove that we can implement

04:25:40.960 --> 04:25:42.240
this educational program

04:25:42.240 --> 04:25:44.680
despite the challenges of the pandemic.

04:25:44.680 --> 04:25:45.520
Next slide.

04:25:46.880 --> 04:25:48.600
The budget we submitted for this meeting

04:25:48.600 --> 04:25:53.480
projected an idea of 13.51 by the P2 attendance report,

04:25:53.480 --> 04:25:55.400
which is what we're using,

04:25:55.400 --> 04:25:57.080
even though we know that we,

04:25:57.080 --> 04:25:59.160
in order to receive the public charter school grant,

04:25:59.160 --> 04:26:01.680
we can get more students before the end of the year,

04:26:01.680 --> 04:26:05.080
which is June 30, 2022.

04:26:05.080 --> 04:26:08.880
However, because of the fundraising campaign

04:26:08.880 --> 04:26:11.280
we've been doing, we have received pledges

04:26:11.280 --> 04:26:16.280
which we have submitted to SBEN CDE of $530,000 so far,

04:26:18.040 --> 04:26:19.760
and we are still expecting more

04:26:19.760 --> 04:26:21.760
from our capital fundraising campaign.

04:26:21.760 --> 04:26:25.480
People are still, just the idea of trying to close the school

04:26:25.480 --> 04:26:28.000
is heartbreaking that people are just coming out

04:26:28.000 --> 04:26:30.840
and donating and pledging to ECEA.

04:26:30.840 --> 04:26:33.160
And we also have 92 application forms

04:26:33.160 --> 04:26:35.240
which we shared in our report.

04:26:35.240 --> 04:26:38.360
So we know that our projection of 168 students

04:26:38.360 --> 04:26:39.560
for next year is realistic.

04:26:39.560 --> 04:26:43.040
We have people calling as they receive our email

04:26:43.040 --> 04:26:44.000
and other campaigns.

04:26:44.000 --> 04:26:44.840
Next slide.

04:26:45.880 --> 04:26:49.960
We have pledges of up to $530,000 like I just mentioned,

04:26:49.960 --> 04:26:52.120
which will help us to repay the LCFF,

04:26:52.120 --> 04:26:55.240
but they will also repay the fund balance

04:26:55.240 --> 04:26:57.960
that has been mentioned earlier.

04:26:58.920 --> 04:27:00.480
If ECEA is allowed to continue to operate,

04:27:00.480 --> 04:27:04.040
because that's then how we can pay CDE back

04:27:04.040 --> 04:27:06.800
and also make sure that we meet that fund balance.

04:27:06.800 --> 04:27:08.320
Next slide.

04:27:08.320 --> 04:27:10.960
ECEA was in regular communication with the CDE

04:27:10.960 --> 04:27:13.600
during the summer and early fall of 2021

04:27:13.600 --> 04:27:17.320
based on information that we submitted to you in our report.

04:27:17.320 --> 04:27:22.160
Again, Caltrans has cleared this site to use.

04:27:22.160 --> 04:27:24.600
It's now up to CDE to sign off.

04:27:24.600 --> 04:27:27.160
And we requested how they would like us

04:27:27.160 --> 04:27:29.760
to notify them of all the other things

04:27:29.760 --> 04:27:32.920
that we have already cleared from their February report.

04:27:32.920 --> 04:27:35.520
And to date, we have not received information

04:27:35.520 --> 04:27:36.480
as to how to do that.

04:27:36.480 --> 04:27:38.200
We do reach out to CDE.

04:27:38.200 --> 04:27:42.720
We ask for information to help us meet their requirements.

04:27:42.720 --> 04:27:43.680
Dr. Akoya-Johnson.

04:27:43.680 --> 04:27:44.760
Next slide.

04:27:44.760 --> 04:27:47.920
Because ECEA could not operate in its present facilities.

04:27:47.920 --> 04:27:49.160
Pardon me, ma'am.

04:27:49.160 --> 04:27:51.000
The 10 minutes has just come to a close.

04:27:51.000 --> 04:27:53.360
If you'd like to make a concluding statement.

04:27:53.720 --> 04:27:54.760
She's a guy over there.

04:27:56.760 --> 04:27:59.520
And so once again, we ask that the SBE

04:27:59.520 --> 04:28:03.040
delay final action on the revocation of ECEA's charter

04:28:03.040 --> 04:28:04.800
in order to allow sufficient time

04:28:04.800 --> 04:28:06.960
for the facility to be up and running.

04:28:06.960 --> 04:28:08.800
There is no legal or procedural need

04:28:08.800 --> 04:28:10.760
to fast track revocation.

04:28:10.760 --> 04:28:12.400
And it will only harm students

04:28:12.400 --> 04:28:14.560
by removing them from their school home

04:28:14.560 --> 04:28:16.000
during the middle of the year.

04:28:16.000 --> 04:28:19.040
We have repeatedly cleared alleged violations

04:28:19.040 --> 04:28:20.840
reached out to CDE,

04:28:20.840 --> 04:28:23.000
including about independent study agreements

04:28:23.640 --> 04:28:24.480
and everything else.

04:28:24.480 --> 04:28:26.720
And we'll like to show you this current slide.

04:28:26.720 --> 04:28:27.560
Thank you, ma'am.

04:28:27.560 --> 04:28:28.520
Where you would see where we are.

04:28:28.520 --> 04:28:29.360
Next slide.

04:28:29.360 --> 04:28:31.400
Can we show the state board the slide

04:28:31.400 --> 04:28:34.400
of this current place where they, so they can see it.

04:28:34.400 --> 04:28:35.960
Dr. Akoya-Johnson, I apologize.

04:28:35.960 --> 04:28:37.160
The time has come to a close.

04:28:37.160 --> 04:28:39.040
Thank you for your comments.

04:28:39.040 --> 04:28:39.880
All right.

04:28:39.880 --> 04:28:42.600
Thank you so much for your time and for hearing us.

04:28:51.200 --> 04:28:52.480
I'm sorry I was muted.

04:28:53.280 --> 04:28:55.400
We want to put up the public comment slide

04:28:55.400 --> 04:28:58.240
so that people can queue up for public comment.

04:28:59.800 --> 04:29:02.520
Members of the public who want to provide comment

04:29:02.520 --> 04:29:05.120
on this item can do so by calling the telephone number

04:29:05.120 --> 04:29:07.960
and using the access code provided on the slide

04:29:07.960 --> 04:29:09.840
that is shown now.

04:29:09.840 --> 04:29:12.760
And while we're waiting for members of the public

04:29:12.760 --> 04:29:15.960
to queue up, I want to just ask Vice President Glover-Woods

04:29:15.960 --> 04:29:20.280
if she has any initial comments as state board liaison,

04:29:20.280 --> 04:29:22.520
and then we will go to public comment.

04:29:24.000 --> 04:29:26.920
President Darling-Hammond, thank you so much

04:29:26.920 --> 04:29:29.280
for the opportunity to share.

04:29:29.280 --> 04:29:32.760
I just want to concur and underscore

04:29:32.760 --> 04:29:36.960
that the fiscal concerns that have been shared

04:29:36.960 --> 04:29:39.600
in the presentation from the CDE staff

04:29:39.600 --> 04:29:42.720
are of primary concern.

04:29:42.720 --> 04:29:47.040
The fiscal insolvency that has been outlined

04:29:47.040 --> 04:29:50.920
is again, something that is of great concern,

04:29:50.920 --> 04:29:55.480
the fact that they are slated to run out of funds

04:29:55.480 --> 04:29:58.560
before the school year does come to a close.

04:29:58.560 --> 04:30:00.520
And I would like to also underscore

04:30:00.520 --> 04:30:04.000
that the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools

04:30:04.000 --> 04:30:09.000
discussed this revocation and heard some very similar

04:30:09.040 --> 04:30:12.600
comments during their meeting in February.

04:30:12.600 --> 04:30:15.400
And for our new board members just to know

04:30:15.400 --> 04:30:19.960
that the ACCS is a board that is comprised

04:30:19.960 --> 04:30:24.600
of multiple educational partners, if you will,

04:30:26.320 --> 04:30:29.000
charter school operators, parents, teachers,

04:30:29.000 --> 04:30:31.480
county superintendents, district superintendents,

04:30:31.480 --> 04:30:33.080
and governing board members.

04:30:33.080 --> 04:30:36.880
So it's a diverse body that takes care to listen

04:30:36.880 --> 04:30:39.240
to the issues brought before them

04:30:39.240 --> 04:30:43.120
before giving recommendations to this body

04:30:43.120 --> 04:30:45.120
of the State Board of Education.

04:30:45.120 --> 04:30:49.640
So the ACCS did unanimously recommend

04:30:49.680 --> 04:30:54.000
that the State Board of Education issue a notice

04:30:54.000 --> 04:30:58.560
of intent to revoke two EGLE collegiate academy.

04:30:58.560 --> 04:31:01.920
They also were very concerned about the fiscal solvency

04:31:01.920 --> 04:31:04.960
and I'd like to move forward President Darling-Hammond

04:31:04.960 --> 04:31:08.600
when you do appropriate for public comment at this time

04:31:08.600 --> 04:31:12.040
and the conversation and discussion

04:31:12.040 --> 04:31:13.240
amongst the board members.

04:31:13.240 --> 04:31:14.080
Thank you.

04:31:14.080 --> 04:31:15.120
Thank you, we'll move to public comment.

04:31:15.120 --> 04:31:16.760
Are there any public commenters?

04:31:17.760 --> 04:31:20.800
Yes, there are currently 17 callers in the queue.

04:31:20.800 --> 04:31:22.440
I will open up the phone line now.

04:31:23.840 --> 04:31:25.520
Good afternoon, State Board of Education.

04:31:25.520 --> 04:31:27.600
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:31:27.600 --> 04:31:28.880
Your time starts now.

04:31:28.880 --> 04:31:30.040
You have one minute.

04:31:32.880 --> 04:31:33.840
Hi, good afternoon.

04:31:33.840 --> 04:31:36.440
My name is Dawn Hakeem and I have been involved

04:31:36.440 --> 04:31:40.440
with EGLE collegiate academy since the very beginning.

04:31:40.440 --> 04:31:45.440
I am urging you to please reconsider and work with us.

04:31:46.280 --> 04:31:51.280
We are working very hard to drive fundraising and enrollment

04:31:53.600 --> 04:31:56.400
and we really believe strongly

04:31:56.400 --> 04:32:00.400
that our academic program is doing so well

04:32:00.400 --> 04:32:02.960
and our families are so happy with it.

04:32:02.960 --> 04:32:06.600
So we just need a little bit of help.

04:32:06.600 --> 04:32:08.960
If we can just get a facility

04:32:08.960 --> 04:32:10.440
and if we could have help with that,

04:32:10.440 --> 04:32:14.000
then everything else will really fall into place

04:32:14.000 --> 04:32:18.360
and we feel like we've been going back and forth

04:32:18.360 --> 04:32:23.360
and we're really at a point where we have the site ready.

04:32:23.560 --> 04:32:25.040
It can be our launching ground

04:32:25.040 --> 04:32:28.720
and then we will be able to repay back these funds.

04:32:28.720 --> 04:32:29.560
Schools are busy.

04:32:29.560 --> 04:32:31.880
Thank you, call your time is up.

04:32:31.880 --> 04:32:32.880
Thank you, caller.

04:32:35.160 --> 04:32:36.560
Next caller, please state your name

04:32:36.560 --> 04:32:37.920
and affiliation for the record.

04:32:37.920 --> 04:32:40.120
You have one minute, your time starts now.

04:32:41.000 --> 04:32:43.440
Good afternoon, my name is Michael Juba

04:32:43.440 --> 04:32:44.640
and I'm a classroom teacher

04:32:44.640 --> 04:32:47.640
representing the California Teachers Association.

04:32:47.640 --> 04:32:50.400
CTA supports the CDE's recommendation

04:32:50.400 --> 04:32:53.800
that the state board issue a notice of intent to revoke

04:32:53.800 --> 04:32:57.520
with notice of facts to the EGLE collegiate academy.

04:32:57.520 --> 04:33:01.200
The issues with ECA outlined by the CDE in the item

04:33:01.200 --> 04:33:04.040
are egregious and CTA would like to highlight

04:33:04.040 --> 04:33:07.480
that the consistent pattern of shifting enrollment numbers

04:33:07.640 --> 04:33:11.600
led to the ECA being overfunded by almost $500,000

04:33:11.600 --> 04:33:13.360
in public funds.

04:33:13.360 --> 04:33:15.280
Perhaps the most troubling shift occurred

04:33:15.280 --> 04:33:18.920
with ECA reporting to the CDE on September 30th

04:33:18.920 --> 04:33:21.720
that they started school with 131 students

04:33:21.720 --> 04:33:25.280
and then their attendance report only had 12.

04:33:25.280 --> 04:33:29.080
ECA's actions are reminiscent of the A3 scandal

04:33:29.080 --> 04:33:31.920
and we believe it would be prudent for the CDE

04:33:31.920 --> 04:33:34.640
to investigate ECA's actions

04:33:35.400 --> 04:33:38.400
to determine if this was gross management,

04:33:38.400 --> 04:33:41.400
gross incompetence, or fraud.

04:33:41.400 --> 04:33:42.240
Thank you, color.

04:33:42.240 --> 04:33:43.080
Thank you, color.

04:33:43.080 --> 04:33:43.920
Your time is up.

04:33:46.400 --> 04:33:47.720
Next color, please state your name

04:33:47.720 --> 04:33:49.040
and affiliation for the record.

04:33:49.040 --> 04:33:50.080
Your time starts now.

04:33:50.080 --> 04:33:51.080
You have one minute.

04:33:55.120 --> 04:33:59.320
Hi, I'm calling because I would like you to support ECA.

04:33:59.320 --> 04:34:01.720
I'm a mother of second grade,

04:34:02.320 --> 04:34:05.680
I'm a mother of second grade student

04:34:05.680 --> 04:34:07.320
and he's so happy over there

04:34:07.320 --> 04:34:10.280
and I would like you to give him a chance,

04:34:10.280 --> 04:34:11.720
to give them a chance.

04:34:13.520 --> 04:34:16.400
And when my son is here, he wants to say something.

04:34:18.120 --> 04:34:22.560
I love my school, please support it.

04:34:24.000 --> 04:34:25.120
Thank you.

04:34:25.120 --> 04:34:26.120
Thank you very much.

04:34:28.000 --> 04:34:29.480
Next color, please state your name

04:34:29.480 --> 04:34:30.840
and affiliation for the record.

04:34:30.840 --> 04:34:31.680
You have one minute.

04:34:31.680 --> 04:34:32.920
Your time starts now.

04:34:36.480 --> 04:34:38.040
Good afternoon, board members.

04:34:38.040 --> 04:34:39.280
My name is Andrew Ciccarelli

04:34:39.280 --> 04:34:41.240
and I am the director of the charter school's office

04:34:41.240 --> 04:34:44.000
for the Los Angeles County Office of Education.

04:34:44.000 --> 04:34:45.920
Back on July 8th of 2020,

04:34:45.920 --> 04:34:47.160
we presented to this board

04:34:47.160 --> 04:34:49.040
with the county and district's concerns

04:34:49.040 --> 04:34:51.600
with the Eagle Collegiate Academy charter petition.

04:34:51.600 --> 04:34:53.880
We found the petitioners demonstrably unlikely

04:34:53.880 --> 04:34:56.240
to successfully implement the petition

04:34:56.240 --> 04:34:57.360
and in particular,

04:34:57.360 --> 04:35:00.240
we noted the petitioner's unrealistic enrollment plan

04:35:00.240 --> 04:35:03.080
and an underestimation of the cost and time it would take

04:35:03.080 --> 04:35:05.800
to bring an identified and wholly unfit facility

04:35:05.800 --> 04:35:07.040
into compliance.

04:35:07.040 --> 04:35:08.520
Despite an extra planning year

04:35:08.520 --> 04:35:11.240
and the petitioner's strong assurances to the contrary,

04:35:11.240 --> 04:35:13.120
these dilemmas have indeed come to pass

04:35:13.120 --> 04:35:15.480
to the detriment of their students and community.

04:35:15.480 --> 04:35:17.600
The school has enrolled only 12 students

04:35:17.600 --> 04:35:19.800
inadequately adjusting their budgets

04:35:19.800 --> 04:35:22.360
and has been unable to secure an appropriate facility,

04:35:22.360 --> 04:35:24.120
providing a remote educational program

04:35:24.120 --> 04:35:26.320
that is deficient and in violation of law.

04:35:26.320 --> 04:35:29.280
Your staff have provided a detailed and compelling report,

04:35:29.280 --> 04:35:31.240
the Eagle Collegiate Academy is not a good option

04:35:31.240 --> 04:35:33.400
for its community and it is in the best interest

04:35:33.400 --> 04:35:35.480
of this community for the school to close.

04:35:35.480 --> 04:35:37.000
The district and county are prepared to help.

04:35:37.000 --> 04:35:37.840
Thank you, caller.

04:35:37.840 --> 04:35:38.680
Your time is up.

04:35:38.680 --> 04:35:41.120
In addition to other more productive educational options,

04:35:41.120 --> 04:35:42.640
I urge you to revoke this school.

04:35:42.640 --> 04:35:43.480
Thank you.

04:35:43.480 --> 04:35:44.320
Thank you.

04:35:45.400 --> 04:35:46.800
Next caller, please state your name

04:35:46.800 --> 04:35:48.080
and affiliation for the record.

04:35:48.080 --> 04:35:48.920
You have one minute.

04:35:48.920 --> 04:35:50.080
Your time starts now.

04:35:51.720 --> 04:35:52.880
It can't be too loud.

04:35:56.120 --> 04:35:56.960
Good afternoon, caller.

04:35:56.960 --> 04:35:59.000
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

04:35:59.000 --> 04:36:00.200
Your time starts now.

04:36:08.920 --> 04:36:09.760
Caller.

04:36:09.760 --> 04:36:11.240
Oh, hi, my name.

04:36:11.240 --> 04:36:12.280
Go ahead.

04:36:12.280 --> 04:36:13.400
Hello.

04:36:13.400 --> 04:36:14.840
My name is Ashley Cousteau.

04:36:14.840 --> 04:36:17.000
I am a teacher at Eagle Collegiate Academy

04:36:17.000 --> 04:36:19.280
and a second and third grade teacher.

04:36:19.280 --> 04:36:21.480
And this school means so much

04:36:23.000 --> 04:36:25.520
to the staff and the faculty and the students

04:36:25.520 --> 04:36:28.640
and the parents and we have done so much

04:36:29.280 --> 04:36:30.840
to try to meet your needs

04:36:30.840 --> 04:36:33.040
and to be able to keep these students going

04:36:33.040 --> 04:36:35.000
and they are dreading the idea

04:36:35.000 --> 04:36:36.680
of their school closing down.

04:36:36.680 --> 04:36:38.920
Their grades are phenomenal

04:36:38.920 --> 04:36:41.560
with how much time that they are given in class

04:36:41.560 --> 04:36:43.560
with not as many students

04:36:43.560 --> 04:36:45.680
but given the best instruction possible

04:36:45.680 --> 04:36:47.880
and they just wanna finish off this school year

04:36:47.880 --> 04:36:49.760
and continue at their school.

04:36:49.760 --> 04:36:52.760
If you could please help us, work with us

04:36:52.760 --> 04:36:56.880
because these students would be so devastated.

04:36:56.880 --> 04:36:57.720
Thank you, caller.

04:36:57.720 --> 04:36:58.560
Time is up.

04:37:00.760 --> 04:37:02.280
Next caller, please state your name

04:37:02.280 --> 04:37:03.560
and affiliation for the record.

04:37:03.560 --> 04:37:04.400
You have one minute.

04:37:04.400 --> 04:37:05.440
Your time starts now.

04:37:13.640 --> 04:37:14.760
Caller, please state your name

04:37:14.760 --> 04:37:16.040
and affiliation for the record.

04:37:16.040 --> 04:37:17.360
Your time starts now.

04:37:22.400 --> 04:37:24.160
Okay, moving on.

04:37:24.160 --> 04:37:25.120
Next caller.

04:37:26.120 --> 04:37:27.600
Please state your name and affiliation.

04:37:27.600 --> 04:37:28.800
Your time starts now.

04:37:30.600 --> 04:37:32.040
Hello, my name is Jack Ritter

04:37:32.040 --> 04:37:34.720
and I'm a community member at Inalga Duce

04:37:34.720 --> 04:37:37.600
and I just hope that you guys please let ECA continue.

04:37:37.600 --> 04:37:39.280
I think it is important for these students

04:37:39.280 --> 04:37:41.600
to have consistency at this young age

04:37:41.600 --> 04:37:44.240
and be at the same facility with the same teachers.

04:37:44.240 --> 04:37:46.400
I think change may be detrimental to their development

04:37:46.400 --> 04:37:48.000
at the stage of their lives.

04:37:48.000 --> 04:37:49.680
The teachers at ECA have done a great job

04:37:49.680 --> 04:37:50.520
educating the students

04:37:50.520 --> 04:37:52.920
and the improvement is evident

04:37:53.120 --> 04:37:55.360
in the facts in the school.

04:37:56.200 --> 04:37:57.760
The relationships built between the teachers

04:37:57.760 --> 04:37:59.040
and the students are very important

04:37:59.040 --> 04:38:00.960
for these students' lives

04:38:00.960 --> 04:38:02.880
and I just hope that you please think about the students' lives

04:38:02.880 --> 04:38:04.520
when making these decisions.

04:38:04.520 --> 04:38:05.720
Thank you.

04:38:05.720 --> 04:38:06.560
Thank you.

04:38:18.000 --> 04:38:19.320
Hi, my name is Paulina

04:38:19.320 --> 04:38:21.840
and I'm calling in support of Eagle Crooked Academy.

04:38:21.840 --> 04:38:24.760
ECA is providing value to students

04:38:24.760 --> 04:38:26.600
and I'm asking you not to close the school.

04:38:26.600 --> 04:38:27.560
Thank you.

04:38:27.560 --> 04:38:28.400
Thank you.

04:38:29.400 --> 04:38:30.880
Next caller, please state your name

04:38:32.200 --> 04:38:33.440
Your time starts now.

04:38:33.440 --> 04:38:34.440
You have one minute.

04:38:40.480 --> 04:38:42.040
Hello, my name is Rita Solaya.

04:38:42.040 --> 04:38:44.920
I'm the ECA board of the director member

04:38:44.920 --> 04:38:47.040
and I'm calling for supporting

04:38:47.040 --> 04:38:50.240
and asking please do not disturb our children's lives

04:38:50.240 --> 04:38:52.280
by closing the school where they are thriving,

04:38:52.280 --> 04:38:54.360
learning and growing every day.

04:38:54.360 --> 04:38:56.680
Closing ECA before the school has the opportunity

04:38:56.680 --> 04:38:59.520
to serve all the families that want to attend

04:38:59.520 --> 04:39:03.960
and perpetuate why the rich keeps getting richer

04:39:03.960 --> 04:39:05.440
and the poor keeps getting poorer

04:39:05.440 --> 04:39:07.680
because you would be taking away the opportunity

04:39:07.680 --> 04:39:09.400
for our children to change their future

04:39:09.400 --> 04:39:11.040
by assessing the quality of education

04:39:11.040 --> 04:39:13.160
for ECA they need and deserve.

04:39:13.160 --> 04:39:16.640
Please do not close with this beginning of time

04:39:16.640 --> 04:39:19.880
and every time we come into a halt,

04:39:20.840 --> 04:39:21.960
it's affecting our children.

04:39:21.960 --> 04:39:23.880
I'm a mother of four children

04:39:23.880 --> 04:39:26.800
which essentially lost the opportunity

04:39:26.800 --> 04:39:29.760
to attend to this, to ECA due to the fact

04:39:29.760 --> 04:39:32.560
that we have been going back and forth

04:39:32.560 --> 04:39:36.960
and being able to open ECA on time.

04:39:36.960 --> 04:39:37.800
Thank you.

04:39:37.800 --> 04:39:38.640
Thank you, caller.

04:39:39.880 --> 04:39:41.200

Your time starts now.

04:39:48.040 --> 04:39:48.880
Hello.

04:39:49.760 --> 04:39:50.600
Go ahead, caller.

04:39:51.960 --> 04:39:52.800
Thank you.

04:39:52.800 --> 04:39:54.160
My name is Eliana Howe

04:39:54.160 --> 04:39:57.720
and I'm one of the special ed teachers at the school

04:39:57.720 --> 04:40:00.560
that has been supporting ECA for many years

04:40:00.560 --> 04:40:04.080
and I just would like to have the school continue

04:40:04.080 --> 04:40:05.800
helping the students in the community.

04:40:05.800 --> 04:40:06.640
Thank you.

04:40:06.640 --> 04:40:07.680
Thank you very much.

04:40:09.280 --> 04:40:10.640
Next caller, please state your name

04:40:10.640 --> 04:40:11.920

04:40:12.760 --> 04:40:14.000
Your time starts now.

04:40:14.840 --> 04:40:16.600
Hi, my name is Ruth Posey.

04:40:16.600 --> 04:40:18.840
I'm a parent in the community.

04:40:18.840 --> 04:40:21.800
I would like to say that I support the school,

04:40:21.800 --> 04:40:26.800
the teachers, the staff, and the families, most importantly.

04:40:26.800 --> 04:40:30.800
I think the school is very good for the community

04:40:30.800 --> 04:40:33.280
because of the excellent instructional program

04:40:33.280 --> 04:40:35.800
and care for the students and family

04:40:35.800 --> 04:40:39.400
and I think it would be unfair to interrupt the instruction

04:40:39.400 --> 04:40:42.080
for the students, the children,

04:40:43.080 --> 04:40:47.520
and the families who are gone this far into the school year

04:40:47.520 --> 04:40:49.680
and who are really thriving and learning.

04:40:50.640 --> 04:40:54.000
With the connection to classmates and the teachers,

04:40:54.000 --> 04:40:55.760
it seems like it's a very great program

04:40:55.760 --> 04:40:59.440
and I wish you would give it another chance to stay open.

04:40:59.440 --> 04:41:00.280
Thank you.

04:41:00.280 --> 04:41:01.120
Thank you.

Okay, thank you very much.

04:41:20.160 --> 04:41:24.360
Yeah, and I think that it should be given the chance

04:41:24.360 --> 04:41:25.960
to finish out the school year.

04:41:28.440 --> 04:41:29.960

My name is Uzo Madusky.

04:41:42.320 --> 04:41:47.320
I'm just pleading that you consider leaving ECA to thrive.

04:41:47.640 --> 04:41:49.440
Please do not close down the school.

04:41:49.440 --> 04:41:50.360
Thank you.

04:41:50.360 --> 04:41:51.200

04:41:55.960 --> 04:41:57.000
Your time starts now.

04:42:00.640 --> 04:42:05.640
Hi, I'm in support of Eagle Collegiate Academy continuing.

04:42:06.320 --> 04:42:09.640
I have two children that will be attending

04:42:09.640 --> 04:42:11.960
Eagle Collegiate Academy in the fall.

04:42:11.960 --> 04:42:16.320
And I'm looking forward to being able to make that choice

04:42:16.320 --> 04:42:19.680
to which school I want to send my children.

04:42:19.680 --> 04:42:24.160
So I just ask that you would continue to help ECA

04:42:24.160 --> 04:42:27.160
and support ECA and keep the school open.

04:42:27.160 --> 04:42:28.000
Thank you.

04:42:28.000 --> 04:42:28.840
Thank you.

Hi, my name is Jolie.

04:42:39.480 --> 04:42:44.120
I have two kids in ECA and I'm here to support the school.

04:42:44.120 --> 04:42:47.880
I would like you guys to give us the opportunity to stay open.

04:42:47.880 --> 04:42:49.840
My kids are so happy with this school.

04:42:49.840 --> 04:42:51.920
The teachers are so great.

04:42:51.920 --> 04:42:54.200
The directors, everybody, we are so happy.

04:42:54.200 --> 04:42:57.200
And we ask you guys to leave that school open.

04:42:57.200 --> 04:43:00.360
It's gonna be a great impact, not just for Santa Clarita,

04:43:00.360 --> 04:43:02.000
but for the areas I would do say.

04:43:02.000 --> 04:43:03.480
And I know it's gonna be great.

04:43:03.520 --> 04:43:07.280
We're gonna do amazing if you guys give us a chance

04:43:07.280 --> 04:43:08.200
to stay open.

04:43:08.200 --> 04:43:11.800
My kids, they have been learning so much.

04:43:11.800 --> 04:43:14.360
They have been developing themselves so much.

04:43:14.360 --> 04:43:16.520
And I'm so happy with this school.

04:43:16.520 --> 04:43:18.840
Please give us the opportunity to stay open.

04:43:18.840 --> 04:43:21.280
And I know you guys not gonna,

04:43:21.280 --> 04:43:23.280
you're gonna be happy with this school.

04:43:23.280 --> 04:43:24.120

04:43:36.800 --> 04:43:38.120
Hi.

04:43:38.120 --> 04:43:40.320
My name is Ezekiel Morikori.

04:43:40.320 --> 04:43:42.360
I am a father of two.

04:43:43.840 --> 04:43:47.040
I will freedom not to close the ETA class at school

04:43:47.040 --> 04:43:48.760

04:43:48.760 --> 04:43:51.200
Hey guys, say something, don't close your school.

04:43:52.240 --> 04:43:54.640
Please not, don't close our school.

04:43:54.640 --> 04:43:56.640
We really need it.

04:43:56.640 --> 04:43:59.680
Our class is the best at the ETA class.

04:43:59.680 --> 04:44:03.160
Don't close our school, we don't need it.

04:44:04.160 --> 04:44:07.160
Because if we don't have it,

04:44:07.160 --> 04:44:12.040
we won't be able to do school or learn.

04:44:17.120 --> 04:44:18.880

04:44:18.880 --> 04:44:19.720

and I'm calling as a community member.

04:44:34.600 --> 04:44:36.920
Our community really needs a school

04:44:36.920 --> 04:44:39.800
like Eagle Collegiate Academy.

04:44:39.800 --> 04:44:43.000
The students are very happy learning there

04:44:43.000 --> 04:44:46.600
and they would be devastated if the school closes.

04:44:46.600 --> 04:44:49.840
Please allow the school to remain open

04:44:49.840 --> 04:44:52.480
so their education is not disrupted.

04:44:52.480 --> 04:44:53.320
Thank you.

04:45:06.680 --> 04:45:08.040
Hi, my name is Isabella

04:45:08.040 --> 04:45:11.440
and I'm a potential parent at Eagle Collegiate Academy.

04:45:11.440 --> 04:45:14.760
I see the value that Eagle Collegiate Academy has

04:45:14.760 --> 04:45:19.360
through its educators, its teachers, its staff,

04:45:19.360 --> 04:45:23.400
and I am very happy to be a part of it.

04:45:23.520 --> 04:45:28.240
And I am so excited for my children

04:45:28.240 --> 04:45:31.080
to be a part of their instructional programs

04:45:31.080 --> 04:45:33.400
such as their international baccalaureate

04:45:33.400 --> 04:45:35.880
and primary years program candidacy.

04:45:35.880 --> 04:45:37.680
I believe in a strong mission

04:45:37.680 --> 04:45:40.160
and I do not want the school to be closed down

04:45:40.160 --> 04:45:44.200
for my children not to have the experience

04:45:44.200 --> 04:45:46.760
that the current students are having.

04:45:46.760 --> 04:45:50.560
Our staff, the teachers are so wonderful

04:45:50.840 --> 04:45:52.800
from what I've heard and seen.

04:45:52.800 --> 04:45:57.800
And it's just, we really want the school to stay open

04:45:57.920 --> 04:46:01.440
so that our children and more children can experience

04:46:01.440 --> 04:46:04.360
what our children are experiencing now.

04:46:04.360 --> 04:46:05.440

04:46:24.880 --> 04:46:26.120
Go ahead, caller.

04:46:26.120 --> 04:46:28.520
The school has a great education program

04:46:28.520 --> 04:46:31.080
and it is good for the community,

04:46:31.080 --> 04:46:32.840
especially for the students.

04:46:32.840 --> 04:46:36.520
It would be bad and such a shame to close the school down,

04:46:36.520 --> 04:46:39.160
especially in the middle of the school year.

04:46:39.160 --> 04:46:42.280
Please do not shut down Eagle Collegiate Academy.

04:46:42.280 --> 04:46:43.160

Hi, my name is Mobology.

04:46:57.040 --> 04:47:01.400
I am a parent of a third grader at ECA

04:47:01.400 --> 04:47:06.400
and I have two potential children coming in in the fall.

04:47:07.080 --> 04:47:09.800
Please help us keep ECA open

04:47:09.800 --> 04:47:12.240
for the betterment of this young kid

04:47:12.240 --> 04:47:16.520
and also to avoid disruption of the educational learning

04:47:16.520 --> 04:47:18.080
that is already going.

04:47:18.080 --> 04:47:21.160
My daughter is very happy with her teacher

04:47:21.160 --> 04:47:25.440
and she has already made a strong bond with her classmates.

04:47:25.440 --> 04:47:27.120
ECA, from what I've observed,

04:47:27.120 --> 04:47:30.720
has come with total hard work, rigorous curriculum

04:47:30.720 --> 04:47:32.360
and great determination to make sure

04:47:32.360 --> 04:47:34.400
that the students succeed.

04:47:34.400 --> 04:47:36.560
Please help us keep the school open.

04:47:36.560 --> 04:47:37.400

04:47:45.160 --> 04:47:46.520
Hi, my name is Anna Morales.

04:47:46.520 --> 04:47:49.640
I'm a parent of a third grader, my son Andrew,

04:47:49.640 --> 04:47:51.840
and I'm in support of Eagle Collegiate Academy

04:47:51.840 --> 04:47:53.640
to stay open.

04:47:53.640 --> 04:47:56.120
My son comes from a background of homeschooling.

04:47:56.120 --> 04:47:59.120
It took me a long time to find a good fit for my son

04:47:59.120 --> 04:48:00.640
and in Eagle Collegiate Academy,

04:48:00.640 --> 04:48:05.640
he has been just learning, being successful.

04:48:05.640 --> 04:48:08.680
He has grown in many ways.

04:48:08.680 --> 04:48:11.640
I'm very excited and happy for him to continue on.

04:48:11.680 --> 04:48:13.760
So please, please keep this school open

04:48:13.760 --> 04:48:16.280
because it will be a detriment to my son

04:48:16.280 --> 04:48:17.600
and here's my son, Andrew.

04:48:18.560 --> 04:48:19.400
Thank you.

04:48:24.200 --> 04:48:25.040
I apologize.

04:48:25.040 --> 04:48:25.880
I think I...

04:48:25.880 --> 04:48:28.720
My name is Andrew and I really like this school.

04:48:28.720 --> 04:48:32.120
My teacher, Ms. Crustel, and my classmates,

04:48:32.120 --> 04:48:35.000
they bring really good education

04:48:35.000 --> 04:48:36.920
and I'm involved with the fun too.

04:48:36.920 --> 04:48:38.240
My name's Andrew.

04:48:39.360 --> 04:48:40.200
Thank you.

04:48:40.320 --> 04:48:41.520
Thank you, Andrew.

04:48:41.520 --> 04:48:42.360

The program is wonderful.

04:49:24.200 --> 04:49:28.360
It will be a tragedy if you close this school.

04:49:28.360 --> 04:49:31.120
Keep it open and see what they can do.

04:49:31.120 --> 04:49:34.600
Give them the opportunity to show you

04:49:34.600 --> 04:49:39.600

04:49:44.400 --> 04:49:45.360
So keep it open.

Hello, my name is Uche Madishke.

I happen to be one of the parents

04:50:38.960 --> 04:50:41.880

04:50:41.880 --> 04:50:44.040
I want to passionately plea

04:50:44.040 --> 04:50:46.480
that you leave this school open.

04:50:46.480 --> 04:50:48.360
My daughters have been having a wonderful,

04:50:48.360 --> 04:50:50.680
one-of-a-kind experience going in there.

04:50:50.680 --> 04:50:52.240
Come back every time and they tell me

04:50:52.240 --> 04:50:55.080
how they have been taught different languages,

04:50:55.080 --> 04:50:56.520
South Korean and all of that.

04:50:56.520 --> 04:50:59.000
So the opportunity for them to be multilingual

04:50:59.000 --> 04:51:01.080
actually exists by them going to this school.

04:51:01.080 --> 04:51:02.600
So I'll plead with you

04:51:02.600 --> 04:51:04.840
that you please leave this school open.

04:51:04.840 --> 04:51:05.680

We appreciate you showing up and giving us your input.

04:52:42.200 --> 04:52:44.160
And now we need to find out

04:52:44.160 --> 04:52:46.400
if we have some more discussion on the board.

04:52:50.400 --> 04:52:51.240
Any questions?

04:52:51.240 --> 04:52:52.720
Yes, member Bonanca.

04:52:55.040 --> 04:52:57.520
So I have a clarifying question.

04:52:57.520 --> 04:52:59.920
It seems like many of the issues stem

04:52:59.920 --> 04:53:04.360
from the difference between the predicted enrollment

04:53:04.360 --> 04:53:06.240
and the actual enrollment.

04:53:06.240 --> 04:53:08.240
And so I'm just curious,

04:53:09.840 --> 04:53:14.840
how was ECA able to predict the enrollment of 131 students

04:53:14.840 --> 04:53:18.480
and was that prediction corroborated by any evidence

04:53:18.480 --> 04:53:21.600
or was it checked by any state agency

04:53:21.600 --> 04:53:22.760
before it was approved?

04:53:25.000 --> 04:53:29.560
So maybe we wanna go first to Stephanie McFarland

04:53:29.720 --> 04:53:31.400
on your second part of your question

04:53:31.400 --> 04:53:36.120
and then we can go to Dr. Akoya Johnson.

04:53:37.880 --> 04:53:40.560
So I might bring in our fiscal services division.

04:53:40.560 --> 04:53:43.520
I know Kiyomi Meeker is on the line

04:53:43.520 --> 04:53:45.480
to help answer any fiscal questions,

04:53:45.480 --> 04:53:50.480
but yes, the way that new and expanding charters are funded

04:53:51.200 --> 04:53:56.200
is that they estimate how many students

04:53:56.400 --> 04:53:58.200
that they are going to receive.

04:53:58.200 --> 04:54:02.960
So they estimated 168 students, I believe,

04:54:02.960 --> 04:54:04.280
on their PENSEC report

04:54:04.280 --> 04:54:06.160
and that is what they were funded for.

04:54:07.160 --> 04:54:09.600
A 20-day report comes out

04:54:09.600 --> 04:54:11.920
and we received that the beginning of November,

04:54:11.920 --> 04:54:15.920
I think November 1st, which indicated they had 12.

04:54:15.920 --> 04:54:18.080
So there is a little bit of a time-lapse

04:54:18.080 --> 04:54:21.160
between finding how much they were funded

04:54:21.160 --> 04:54:23.240
and how many they actually had.

04:54:23.760 --> 04:54:28.760
So there is, that's sort of the verification

04:54:28.840 --> 04:54:31.560
is that 20-day report of how many students they have.

04:54:31.560 --> 04:54:33.840
And I'm sure Kiyomi, if you're on the line,

04:54:33.840 --> 04:54:37.080
you could probably answer that more elegantly than I could.

04:54:38.440 --> 04:54:39.280
But if you feel like-

04:54:39.280 --> 04:54:40.600
We see Kiyomi.

04:54:40.600 --> 04:54:43.000
You did a good job, Stephanie.

04:54:43.000 --> 04:54:46.320
And just for background for the board members,

04:54:46.320 --> 04:54:50.080
hi, Kiyomi Meeker, education fiscal administrator

04:54:50.080 --> 04:54:52.120
in the school fiscal services division.

04:54:52.120 --> 04:54:55.160
This is how we fund all new charters

04:54:55.160 --> 04:54:57.520
because the advance funding is based

04:54:57.520 --> 04:55:00.480
for all LEAs on prior year ADA

04:55:00.480 --> 04:55:02.560
and new charters don't have that.

04:55:02.560 --> 04:55:04.480
We have something called the special advance

04:55:04.480 --> 04:55:06.640
and so the first one is an estimate.

04:55:06.640 --> 04:55:09.040
They do their best guess based on enrollment

04:55:09.040 --> 04:55:12.440
and then the first time we get real data

04:55:12.440 --> 04:55:14.600
or based on actual numbers is the 20-day.

04:55:14.600 --> 04:55:16.640
And so that's where we saw the discrepancy.

04:55:18.200 --> 04:55:19.480
If that answers your question,

04:55:19.480 --> 04:55:21.600
are there any other questions or comments?

04:55:22.360 --> 04:55:26.440
Yes, member Cleverwoods.

04:55:29.760 --> 04:55:33.160
First, I'd like to thank all of the students

04:55:33.160 --> 04:55:35.720
and the parents and the staff members

04:55:35.720 --> 04:55:38.840
from Equal Collegiate Academy that called in.

04:55:38.840 --> 04:55:42.720
It's just quite unfortunate that we are even at a place

04:55:42.720 --> 04:55:46.120
to have this discussion this afternoon.

04:55:46.120 --> 04:55:48.520
It's such a challenge to open a new school

04:55:48.520 --> 04:55:51.800
and opening a new school in the midst of a pandemic

04:55:51.800 --> 04:55:54.080
makes it even more challenging.

04:55:55.200 --> 04:56:00.200
With that being said, this grave concern that I have

04:56:00.480 --> 04:56:03.320
is regarding the fiscal insolvency.

04:56:03.320 --> 04:56:08.120
The numbers that have been shared based on CDE's projections

04:56:08.120 --> 04:56:11.920
and even Equal Collegiate Academy's projections

04:56:11.920 --> 04:56:16.600
just show that there is a gross fiscal insolvency

04:56:16.600 --> 04:56:19.680
for the school and the ability for them

04:56:19.680 --> 04:56:24.600
to continue to operate with such a deficit

04:56:24.600 --> 04:56:29.600
is, it makes it very challenging to do so at a minimum.

04:56:31.800 --> 04:56:36.520
So I, again, just want to say to the communities

04:56:36.520 --> 04:56:38.400
and to my fellow board members,

04:56:38.400 --> 04:56:43.040
this is a challenging and difficult decision to be made.

04:56:44.280 --> 04:56:46.920
And I will be ready to make a motion

04:56:46.920 --> 04:56:48.560
when it is time to do so.

04:56:50.200 --> 04:56:52.760
Are there any other questions

04:56:52.760 --> 04:56:54.320
or comments from board members?

04:56:58.360 --> 04:57:02.760
Seeing none, I think we are ready for a motion,

04:57:03.720 --> 04:57:05.120
Vice President Cleverwood.

04:57:07.160 --> 04:57:08.840
Thank you, President Burley-Hammond.

04:57:10.040 --> 04:57:13.040
I move that we,

04:57:15.160 --> 04:57:19.560
I move that we issue a notice of intent

04:57:19.560 --> 04:57:22.800
to revoke with notice of facts

04:57:22.800 --> 04:57:27.800
pursuant to Education Code Section 47607H at this time.

04:57:31.240 --> 04:57:32.840
Is there a second?

04:57:32.840 --> 04:57:34.120
Second that.

04:57:34.120 --> 04:57:35.920
Thank you, any further discussion?

04:57:38.480 --> 04:57:42.640
Hearing none, Brooks, can you please call the roll call vote?

04:57:42.640 --> 04:57:43.480
Member Rodriguez.

04:57:45.200 --> 04:57:46.280
Yes.

04:57:46.280 --> 04:57:47.480
Member Patilio-Brownson.

04:57:50.560 --> 04:57:51.920
Yes.

Member McQuillan.

04:57:54.240 --> 04:57:55.440
Yes.

04:57:55.440 --> 04:57:56.840
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:57:58.080 --> 04:57:59.720
Yes.

04:57:59.720 --> 04:58:00.560
Member Olken.

Member Lewis.

04:58:04.160 --> 04:58:05.680
Yes.

04:58:05.680 --> 04:58:06.960
Vice President Cleverwood.

04:58:08.480 --> 04:58:09.480
Yes.

04:58:09.480 --> 04:58:10.320
Member Escobedo.

04:58:11.440 --> 04:58:12.720
Yes.

04:58:12.720 --> 04:58:13.920
President Darlin-Hammond.

04:58:14.960 --> 04:58:16.080
Yes.

04:58:16.080 --> 04:58:16.920
Member Bonacca.

04:58:17.920 --> 04:58:19.160
Aye.

04:58:19.760 --> 04:58:20.600
The motion carries.

04:58:21.880 --> 04:58:25.920
Thank you, I want to thank Dr. Ogoda-Koya-Johnson

04:58:25.920 --> 04:58:29.320
for her work on this charter

04:58:29.320 --> 04:58:33.800
and the work of staff who called in and the students.

04:58:33.800 --> 04:58:37.840
We feel the pain that you experienced.

04:58:37.840 --> 04:58:40.280
We also want to thank Stephanie Farland

04:58:40.280 --> 04:58:42.320
and the members of our CDE staff

04:58:42.320 --> 04:58:45.760
who have been doing extensive due diligence

04:58:45.760 --> 04:58:47.640
on this question for quite some time

04:58:47.640 --> 04:58:51.040
and we appreciate their efforts very much.

04:58:51.040 --> 04:58:53.720
And with that, we're going to take a 10-minute break.

04:58:53.720 --> 04:58:54.760
I'd like to ask board members

04:58:54.760 --> 04:58:57.920
to please just turn off your microphones and cameras

04:58:57.920 --> 04:59:00.480
and do not leave the meeting.

04:59:00.480 --> 04:59:05.480
And we will see you at 2.55, we'll give you 11 minutes.

04:59:05.800 --> 04:59:06.640
Thank you.

04:59:18.280 --> 04:59:20.240
All right, welcome back.

04:59:20.240 --> 04:59:22.360
Board members, we need to reestablish a quorum,

04:59:22.360 --> 04:59:25.080
so Brooks is going to call the roll.

04:59:25.080 --> 04:59:26.000
Member Rodriguez.

04:59:27.560 --> 04:59:28.520
Present.

04:59:28.520 --> 04:59:29.720
Member Petillo-Brownson.

04:59:31.640 --> 04:59:32.560
Present.

04:59:32.560 --> 04:59:33.400
Member McQuillan.

04:59:34.880 --> 04:59:35.840
Here.

04:59:35.840 --> 04:59:38.080
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

04:59:38.080 --> 04:59:38.960
Here.

04:59:38.960 --> 04:59:40.240
Member Olken.

04:59:40.240 --> 04:59:41.080
Member Lewis.

04:59:42.160 --> 04:59:43.000
Present.

04:59:43.000 --> 04:59:44.240
Vice President Cleverwood.

04:59:45.440 --> 04:59:46.280
Here.

04:59:46.280 --> 04:59:47.120
Member Escobedo.

04:59:48.160 --> 04:59:49.000
Here.

04:59:49.000 --> 04:59:50.720
Present, Darlene Hammond.

04:59:50.720 --> 04:59:51.560
Here.

04:59:51.560 --> 04:59:52.400
Member Bonacca.

04:59:53.600 --> 04:59:54.440
Here.

04:59:54.440 --> 04:59:55.280
Member Quorum.

04:59:56.760 --> 04:59:58.880
Excellent, thank you.

04:59:58.880 --> 05:00:01.000
We're moving to item six.

05:00:01.000 --> 05:00:03.320
Item six is the approval of modifications

05:00:03.320 --> 05:00:06.960
to California's 2020 to 2023

05:00:06.960 --> 05:00:09.960
Unified Strategic Workforce Development Plan.

05:00:09.960 --> 05:00:12.400
And the CDE recommends that we approve

05:00:12.400 --> 05:00:15.920
the modified state plan under the Workforce Innovation

05:00:15.920 --> 05:00:18.600
and Opportunity Act of 2014.

05:00:18.600 --> 05:00:21.000
This item will be presented by Tim Rainey,

05:00:21.000 --> 05:00:22.680
Executive Director of the California

05:00:22.680 --> 05:00:24.560
Workforce Development Board,

05:00:24.560 --> 05:00:27.080
and Carolyn Zachary, the Administrator

05:00:27.080 --> 05:00:30.240
of the Adult Education Office of the State Department,

05:00:30.240 --> 05:00:32.360
with an introduction by Pete Callis,

05:00:32.360 --> 05:00:34.760
who is Director of the College and Career Division

05:00:34.760 --> 05:00:36.280
of the CDE.

05:00:36.280 --> 05:00:38.960
Pete, Tim, and Carolyn, please begin.

05:00:40.240 --> 05:00:42.360
Good afternoon, President Darlene Hammond,

05:00:42.360 --> 05:00:44.520
state board members, Superintendent Thurmond,

05:00:44.520 --> 05:00:46.200
and Chief Deputy Nicely.

05:00:46.200 --> 05:00:47.960
I'm Pete Callis, the Division Director

05:00:47.960 --> 05:00:50.800
over the Career and College Transition Division.

05:00:50.800 --> 05:00:53.480
My team, small but mighty, Tim Rainey,

05:00:54.960 --> 05:00:59.000
and Carolyn Zachary are here to present on this item.

05:00:59.000 --> 05:01:00.560
I'd like to introduce Carolyn Zachary,

05:01:00.560 --> 05:01:03.240
our Administrator over the Adult Education Office,

05:01:03.240 --> 05:01:05.480
and Tim Rainey, the Executive Director

05:01:05.480 --> 05:01:07.240
of the California Workforce Development Board

05:01:07.240 --> 05:01:08.920
to take you through our item.

05:01:08.920 --> 05:01:09.740
Thank you.

05:01:10.460 --> 05:01:15.460
All right, I'm going to start sharing my screen first.

05:01:19.100 --> 05:01:23.500
I'm hoping you can all see that, and here we go.

05:01:27.500 --> 05:01:30.740
All right, well, good afternoon, Superintendent Thurmond,

05:01:30.740 --> 05:01:35.300
President Darlene Hammond, and Vice President Clover Woods.

05:01:35.300 --> 05:01:37.340
We will be presenting information

05:01:37.340 --> 05:01:40.140
and seeking approval today

05:01:40.140 --> 05:01:43.100
for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act

05:01:43.100 --> 05:01:45.660
state plan modifications.

05:01:45.660 --> 05:01:47.980
The acronym for the Workforce Innovation

05:01:47.980 --> 05:01:51.700
and Opportunity Act is WIOA.

05:01:51.700 --> 05:01:54.860
As background, the first California state plan

05:01:54.860 --> 05:01:59.500
was approved by the state board in January 2016

05:01:59.500 --> 05:02:03.740
with mid-plan modifications approved in 2018.

05:02:03.740 --> 05:02:06.860
The current state plan was approved by the state board

05:02:06.860 --> 05:02:09.980
in 2020, and today we are bringing forward

05:02:09.980 --> 05:02:12.540
the mid-plan modifications.

05:02:12.540 --> 05:02:14.340
Tim Rainey, the Executive Director

05:02:14.340 --> 05:02:17.220
of the California Workforce Development Board

05:02:17.220 --> 05:02:19.740
will provide information on the state plan.

05:02:19.740 --> 05:02:24.140
I will follow with information about our adult education,

05:02:24.140 --> 05:02:29.140
Title II Adult Education and Family Literacy Act section.

05:02:29.260 --> 05:02:30.100
Tim?

05:02:30.900 --> 05:02:32.220
Thank you, Carolyn.

05:02:32.220 --> 05:02:35.820
Honored to be here, President Hammond, thank you very much.

05:02:35.820 --> 05:02:38.260
And I also want to thank Superintendent Thurmond

05:02:38.260 --> 05:02:40.460
for being a member of the State Workforce Development Board

05:02:40.460 --> 05:02:43.700
and Pete Callis for participating so much

05:02:43.700 --> 05:02:45.220
in the state board's work,

05:02:45.220 --> 05:02:48.420
and my friend and colleague Patricia Dacasse is on,

05:02:48.420 --> 05:02:50.420
and of course, my good friend and colleague,

05:02:50.420 --> 05:02:53.580
Carolyn Zachary, for all your support and work with us.

05:02:53.580 --> 05:02:56.060
Great partnership, us and y'all.

05:02:56.100 --> 05:02:58.260
I'll go through some basic background, if I could,

05:02:58.260 --> 05:03:00.260
and I should apologize in advance.

05:03:00.260 --> 05:03:02.300
I know you've been at it all day,

05:03:02.300 --> 05:03:04.300
and here I am, another talking head,

05:03:04.300 --> 05:03:06.100
so I don't bore you to tears.

05:03:06.100 --> 05:03:08.820
I don't have any presentation material,

05:03:08.820 --> 05:03:11.580
so that's on me, sorry about that.

05:03:11.580 --> 05:03:13.140
So I'll just talk for a bit,

05:03:13.140 --> 05:03:17.140
and I'll hand it back to Carolyn to talk about the CD part.

05:03:18.660 --> 05:03:20.140
Quickly on the background,

05:03:20.140 --> 05:03:22.060
the Workforce Innovation Opportunities

05:03:22.060 --> 05:03:23.940
and the Workforce Development Board,

05:03:24.780 --> 05:03:26.900
the Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act,

05:03:26.900 --> 05:03:29.660
as Carolyn said, requires that every four years,

05:03:29.660 --> 05:03:30.940
the State Workforce Development Board,

05:03:30.940 --> 05:03:35.500
every state has to do this with its WIOA title partners.

05:03:35.500 --> 05:03:37.260
We have to publish a unified

05:03:37.260 --> 05:03:38.780
strategic workforce development plan,

05:03:38.780 --> 05:03:41.740
AKA what we call the state plan.

05:03:41.740 --> 05:03:44.420
We also do a mandatory modification every two years,

05:03:44.420 --> 05:03:47.060
and that's in fact what this is, it's a modification.

05:03:47.060 --> 05:03:49.300
And then next year, we're gonna dive into

05:03:49.300 --> 05:03:50.940
with your help and partnership

05:03:50.940 --> 05:03:53.140
in developing a brand new state strategic plan.

05:03:53.180 --> 05:03:57.100
So what I'm talking about now is the modification.

05:03:58.420 --> 05:03:59.980
The federally approved plan

05:03:59.980 --> 05:04:02.740
has to include all of those WIOA titles.

05:04:02.740 --> 05:04:05.900
Title one, adult dislocated worker and youth funding,

05:04:05.900 --> 05:04:07.420
that as you know is administered

05:04:07.420 --> 05:04:09.380
through 45 local workforce boards

05:04:09.380 --> 05:04:11.140
around the state of California.

05:04:11.140 --> 05:04:14.620
Title two, that you're more than aware of.

05:04:14.620 --> 05:04:17.340
Title three, Wagner-Pizer Employment Service Program

05:04:17.340 --> 05:04:18.180
that's administered through

05:04:18.180 --> 05:04:19.820
the Employment Development Department.

05:04:19.820 --> 05:04:22.060
And then finally, title four,

05:04:22.100 --> 05:04:24.220
that's Vocational Rehabilitation

05:04:24.220 --> 05:04:25.060
that's administered

05:04:25.060 --> 05:04:27.940
through the Department of Rehabilitation.

05:04:27.940 --> 05:04:29.780
So as our current,

05:04:29.780 --> 05:04:31.500
I think Carolyn might have already said this,

05:04:31.500 --> 05:04:34.260
but our current plan is gonna run to July, 2023.

05:04:34.260 --> 05:04:36.460
And at that point, we'll start the process

05:04:36.460 --> 05:04:39.100
of rewriting a new state plan.

05:04:40.260 --> 05:04:43.700
The plan modification that we're talking about today

05:04:43.700 --> 05:04:47.020
has to be to the US Department of Labor by March 15th.

05:04:47.020 --> 05:04:50.220
So I really deeply appreciate the recommendation

05:04:50.220 --> 05:04:52.580
to approve this draft.

05:04:52.580 --> 05:04:55.340
We just got it back from 30 days of public comment.

05:04:55.340 --> 05:04:58.140
We've incorporated all of that comment

05:04:58.140 --> 05:05:01.820
and we're pretty close to ready to finalize

05:05:01.820 --> 05:05:03.140
and do that submittal.

05:05:05.100 --> 05:05:09.500
The drafts, the modification is unfortunately

05:05:09.500 --> 05:05:12.180
not unlike what I presented to you before.

05:05:12.180 --> 05:05:15.260
So I guess again, I'm apologizing for going over

05:05:15.260 --> 05:05:16.860
some of the same grounds.

05:05:16.860 --> 05:05:19.260
If you're like me though, you forgot what I said.

05:05:20.140 --> 05:05:21.740
So it's gonna be all new

05:05:21.740 --> 05:05:23.980
and you'll validate everything my kids say to me,

05:05:23.980 --> 05:05:25.580
which will be good.

05:05:25.580 --> 05:05:30.020
The state plan is built on three policy objectives

05:05:30.020 --> 05:05:31.860
and on seven strategies.

05:05:33.100 --> 05:05:36.020
There's also a vision that is the underpinning

05:05:36.020 --> 05:05:37.900
of the state plan that we call High Road.

05:05:37.900 --> 05:05:40.700
And I wanna come back to that right at the end.

05:05:40.700 --> 05:05:44.340
The three state plan objectives, the policy objectives

05:05:44.340 --> 05:05:47.260
are fostering demand-driven skills attainment.

05:05:47.460 --> 05:05:50.100
And that means aligning workforce and education programs

05:05:50.100 --> 05:05:52.420
with industry sectors so that employers

05:05:52.420 --> 05:05:54.220
have the skilled workers they need.

05:05:54.220 --> 05:05:58.300
And secondly, enabling upward mobility for all Californians.

05:05:58.300 --> 05:06:00.620
And that means making workforce and education programs

05:06:00.620 --> 05:06:02.700
easily accessible and navigable,

05:06:02.700 --> 05:06:05.540
especially for workers with barriers to employment

05:06:05.540 --> 05:06:08.340
and prioritizing investments in skills

05:06:08.340 --> 05:06:11.620
that lead to quality jobs and economic security.

05:06:11.620 --> 05:06:13.740
And then finally, the last policy objective,

05:06:13.740 --> 05:06:16.300
aligning, coordinating and integrating programs

05:06:16.300 --> 05:06:18.420
and services across systems

05:06:18.420 --> 05:06:21.620
so that we economize our limited resources

05:06:21.620 --> 05:06:22.980
for scale and impact.

05:06:24.220 --> 05:06:28.180
And using this unified plan, the state plan

05:06:28.180 --> 05:06:30.580
is a very important way of getting at that.

05:06:30.580 --> 05:06:33.940
The seven state plan strategies, and I'll be very quick,

05:06:34.860 --> 05:06:37.060
sector strategies is number one.

05:06:37.060 --> 05:06:39.340
We really emphasize this because this is a way

05:06:39.340 --> 05:06:41.580
to connect programs around the state

05:06:41.580 --> 05:06:43.620
to pathways into good jobs

05:06:43.620 --> 05:06:45.380
that are driving regional employment.

05:06:45.380 --> 05:06:49.020
That's really important to the overall vision

05:06:49.020 --> 05:06:51.380
and strategy of the state plan.

05:06:51.380 --> 05:06:54.020
Career pathways is the second.

05:06:54.020 --> 05:06:56.260
Regional partnerships, we always say

05:06:56.260 --> 05:06:57.780
that programs should be delivered locally,

05:06:57.780 --> 05:07:01.900
closest to the communities and people who most need support.

05:07:01.900 --> 05:07:03.420
But industry sectors don't organize

05:07:03.420 --> 05:07:07.140
within political jurisdictions or school jurisdictions.

05:07:07.140 --> 05:07:10.340
They organize regionally, so we need to tie into sectors,

05:07:10.340 --> 05:07:12.300
again, that are driving regional employment

05:07:12.300 --> 05:07:14.500
and that offer the best jobs and careers.

05:07:14.740 --> 05:07:18.060
That work benefits both the industries

05:07:18.060 --> 05:07:19.780
that we're trying to help be more competitive,

05:07:19.780 --> 05:07:23.140
but also the communities that we aim to impact.

05:07:23.140 --> 05:07:24.860
The fourth one is earn and learn.

05:07:25.700 --> 05:07:28.260
Combining quality applied learning with compensation

05:07:28.260 --> 05:07:31.820
is kind of the general definition of that.

05:07:31.820 --> 05:07:36.420
But as you know, the governor has really prioritized

05:07:36.420 --> 05:07:38.220
formalized apprenticeship in California,

05:07:38.220 --> 05:07:39.540
not just in the construction trades,

05:07:39.540 --> 05:07:41.860
but in industry sectors beyond the trades.

05:07:41.860 --> 05:07:44.980
And there's a great deal of work going on around that.

05:07:44.980 --> 05:07:46.660
Supportive services is the fifth.

05:07:46.660 --> 05:07:51.260
People can't afford the time to pursue

05:07:51.260 --> 05:07:53.980
quality skills training without supports.

05:07:53.980 --> 05:07:57.140
Child care, transportation, counseling, mentoring,

05:07:57.140 --> 05:07:59.580
housing, income supports are all very important

05:07:59.580 --> 05:08:01.300
to make that possible.

05:08:01.300 --> 05:08:02.540
The next one, number six,

05:08:02.540 --> 05:08:05.540
is creating cross-system data capacity,

05:08:05.540 --> 05:08:09.780
such as our current partnership with CDE on our CalSkills,

05:08:09.780 --> 05:08:12.180
which is using cross-system performance data

05:08:12.180 --> 05:08:15.260
to assess the value of different interventions,

05:08:15.260 --> 05:08:16.220
workforce interventions.

05:08:16.220 --> 05:08:20.140
We just did an impact analysis of this incredible data

05:08:20.140 --> 05:08:21.380
with the California Policy Lab

05:08:21.380 --> 05:08:23.860
that we would love to come back and share with you.

05:08:23.860 --> 05:08:25.620
And then finally, integrated service delivery.

05:08:25.620 --> 05:08:28.660
So through this coordination, data system alignment,

05:08:28.660 --> 05:08:32.740
co-enrollment, making a complex patchwork

05:08:32.740 --> 05:08:36.420
of local programs much more navigable, as I said before,

05:08:36.420 --> 05:08:38.660
for both workers and employers.

05:08:38.700 --> 05:08:41.220
We did spend a lot of time last year

05:08:41.220 --> 05:08:44.900
working with your staff,

05:08:44.900 --> 05:08:48.260
reaffirming areas of focus

05:08:48.260 --> 05:08:51.780
that went into this modification of our state plan.

05:08:52.620 --> 05:08:55.380
One is around integrated service delivery

05:08:55.380 --> 05:08:57.140
and leveraging supportive services.

05:08:57.140 --> 05:08:59.940
Using co-enrollment among the WIOA titles

05:08:59.940 --> 05:09:01.060
is a big part of that.

05:09:01.980 --> 05:09:04.340
Also, a common intake process

05:09:04.340 --> 05:09:06.540
and aligned data collection and analysis,

05:09:06.540 --> 05:09:09.980
that's especially critical for program and system alignment.

05:09:09.980 --> 05:09:12.540
And again, getting to that navigability of the system

05:09:12.540 --> 05:09:15.540
so it's not such a patchwork and difficult for people

05:09:15.540 --> 05:09:17.780
who don't have time to be messing around

05:09:17.780 --> 05:09:22.300
with a siloed system of workforce and economic services

05:09:22.300 --> 05:09:24.460
and in education services.

05:09:24.460 --> 05:09:28.140
And we'll be participating in the technical assistance.

05:09:28.140 --> 05:09:31.260
It's actually a work group for co-enrollment

05:09:31.260 --> 05:09:34.900
that we're engaged in with California

05:09:34.900 --> 05:09:36.380
Department of Education, CDE.

05:09:38.740 --> 05:09:40.540
Providing technical assistance to the field

05:09:40.540 --> 05:09:42.300
is a big piece of that.

05:09:42.300 --> 05:09:45.940
Also, educating local partners on the value

05:09:45.940 --> 05:09:49.460
and available resources of the Education Options Office,

05:09:49.460 --> 05:09:51.940
critical resources and support.

05:09:51.940 --> 05:09:54.580
And then finally, for Perkins,

05:09:54.580 --> 05:09:58.020
recommitting to greater regional coordination

05:09:58.020 --> 05:10:00.100
in integrated service delivery.

05:10:00.100 --> 05:10:02.740
So utilizing the local and regional planning efforts,

05:10:02.740 --> 05:10:05.020
for example, among workforce boards,

05:10:05.020 --> 05:10:08.300
strong workforce program in Perkins Five

05:10:08.300 --> 05:10:10.980
to achieve that deeper system alignment.

05:10:10.980 --> 05:10:15.380
And we will be supporting the state plan

05:10:15.380 --> 05:10:18.460
for career and technical education efforts

05:10:18.460 --> 05:10:20.460
under the California Workforce Pathways

05:10:20.460 --> 05:10:22.380
Joint Advisory Committee.

05:10:23.340 --> 05:10:25.780
That is the plan in a nutshell.

05:10:25.780 --> 05:10:28.340
And if I could, I'd like to go back to the vision

05:10:28.340 --> 05:10:29.860
that's underpinning all of this work

05:10:29.860 --> 05:10:31.180
because I think it's important.

05:10:32.060 --> 05:10:33.220
Over the last couple of years,

05:10:33.220 --> 05:10:37.380
it's where we've really kind of refined our approach

05:10:37.380 --> 05:10:39.140
to workforce development and how we get

05:10:39.140 --> 05:10:40.260
to that kind of system change

05:10:40.260 --> 05:10:42.260
that could impact equity in the state.

05:10:43.860 --> 05:10:46.980
This is, I think, the California Workforce Development Boards

05:10:46.980 --> 05:10:49.180
and the state plans and our partners,

05:10:49.180 --> 05:10:52.780
real contribution to getting at the governor's vision

05:10:52.780 --> 05:10:54.780
of a California for all.

05:10:56.140 --> 05:10:58.540
I think, and I can say this

05:10:58.540 --> 05:11:00.060
because I've been part of the workforce system

05:11:00.060 --> 05:11:02.540
for a long time, too long.

05:11:02.540 --> 05:11:03.980
Well, I shouldn't say too long.

05:11:03.980 --> 05:11:05.420
We have a lot of work to do.

05:11:05.420 --> 05:11:09.460
The traditional workforce approach is inadequate

05:11:09.460 --> 05:11:13.020
on its own for addressing poverty and inequality

05:11:13.020 --> 05:11:14.620
in California.

05:11:14.620 --> 05:11:17.380
We keep trying to push people into labor markets

05:11:17.380 --> 05:11:18.580
and hope they get jobs.

05:11:20.100 --> 05:11:22.180
President Obama used to call that train of praise

05:11:22.180 --> 05:11:23.220
one of my favorite lines

05:11:23.220 --> 05:11:25.540
that I think it really sort of describes

05:11:25.540 --> 05:11:26.380
the challenge that we have.

05:11:26.380 --> 05:11:28.460
We can't just expect that people are gonna attach.

05:11:29.380 --> 05:11:31.300
We have to make those connections happen.

05:11:32.180 --> 05:11:35.420
We get a lot right as a workforce development system,

05:11:35.420 --> 05:11:37.740
especially serving people that most need to leg up

05:11:37.740 --> 05:11:39.580
in competitive labor markets.

05:11:39.580 --> 05:11:42.540
But I think we get one important thing wrong.

05:11:42.540 --> 05:11:46.540
Rather than responding to labor markets,

05:11:46.540 --> 05:11:50.660
we need to be in the business of shaping labor markets.

05:11:51.660 --> 05:11:53.100
Otherwise, we're not gonna move the needle

05:11:53.100 --> 05:11:54.980
on economic equity.

05:11:54.980 --> 05:11:58.660
A structural problem that we have to contend with

05:11:58.660 --> 05:12:00.820
is that there aren't enough good jobs

05:12:00.820 --> 05:12:03.380
for the number of people who need good jobs.

05:12:03.380 --> 05:12:05.500
MIT economist, David Otter,

05:12:05.500 --> 05:12:07.700
who recently came out with a wonderful book.

05:12:07.700 --> 05:12:08.820
I wish I had the title in front of me.

05:12:08.820 --> 05:12:10.980
I tell you, Google him.

05:12:11.900 --> 05:12:14.660
He likens this challenge of too few good jobs

05:12:14.660 --> 05:12:17.700
to a basketball game in a high school gym

05:12:17.700 --> 05:12:20.140
where you've got a fixed number of seats

05:12:20.140 --> 05:12:22.540
and you've got more spectators showing up for the game

05:12:22.540 --> 05:12:24.940
than there are seats and everybody wants to sit down.

05:12:25.940 --> 05:12:28.300
And the seats will go to those who are quick

05:12:28.300 --> 05:12:30.660
and aggressive in sitting down.

05:12:30.660 --> 05:12:32.740
And we can train people to be faster.

05:12:32.740 --> 05:12:34.860
We can train people to be more aggressive

05:12:34.860 --> 05:12:35.700
for the next game.

05:12:35.700 --> 05:12:36.540
But the fact is,

05:12:36.540 --> 05:12:39.260
you still have the same number of fixed seats.

05:12:39.260 --> 05:12:40.900
So as a workforce system,

05:12:40.900 --> 05:12:44.060
if we don't change the way we approach workforce development

05:12:44.060 --> 05:12:45.820
from that traditional approach,

05:12:45.820 --> 05:12:48.460
then we're gonna continue to feed this competition

05:12:48.460 --> 05:12:50.460
for too few good jobs.

05:12:50.460 --> 05:12:52.700
And who loses out in that competition

05:12:52.940 --> 05:12:55.300
have been historically marginalized.

05:12:55.300 --> 05:12:59.180
So to move the needle on economic equity

05:12:59.180 --> 05:13:01.660
to get to that California for all,

05:13:01.660 --> 05:13:03.420
we can't just respond to labor markets who said,

05:13:03.420 --> 05:13:05.460
we have to be in the business of shaping them.

05:13:05.460 --> 05:13:09.140
And to us, that means at least three things.

05:13:09.140 --> 05:13:10.940
One is improving access to good jobs

05:13:10.940 --> 05:13:15.820
built into the objectives that are described

05:13:15.820 --> 05:13:17.420
in the state strategic plan.

05:13:17.420 --> 05:13:18.900
Improving access to good jobs

05:13:18.900 --> 05:13:22.340
means connecting existing workforce programs

05:13:22.980 --> 05:13:23.820
to not just any jobs,

05:13:23.820 --> 05:13:25.460
but the best jobs in industry sectors

05:13:25.460 --> 05:13:27.260
with projected growth and openings.

05:13:27.260 --> 05:13:28.700
So being very deliberate about

05:13:28.700 --> 05:13:31.220
not just we'll respond to markets,

05:13:31.220 --> 05:13:32.900
but we're looking at what the trends are

05:13:32.900 --> 05:13:37.060
in terms of where the openings are over the next five years.

05:13:37.060 --> 05:13:39.980
But we're also paying a lot of attention to job quality.

05:13:41.060 --> 05:13:43.060
The second one is creating more good jobs.

05:13:43.060 --> 05:13:46.300
So we could use our public dollars, the people's money,

05:13:46.300 --> 05:13:49.140
to subsidize high road employers

05:13:49.140 --> 05:13:51.860
and help them be more competitive and grow

05:13:51.860 --> 05:13:54.140
rather than subsidizing the low road companies

05:13:54.140 --> 05:13:57.340
that offer high turnover, low wage jobs,

05:13:57.340 --> 05:13:59.500
and that are dangerous in many cases.

05:13:59.500 --> 05:14:01.500
And the third one is improving existing jobs.

05:14:01.500 --> 05:14:03.620
So we can, and we're doing this all over California

05:14:03.620 --> 05:14:05.380
as a matter of fact,

05:14:05.380 --> 05:14:08.660
working with employers that are interested in job quality

05:14:08.660 --> 05:14:11.020
as a way to improve recruitment

05:14:11.020 --> 05:14:13.220
and the retention of talent.

05:14:13.220 --> 05:14:16.260
So I'll finish up with kind of hitting

05:14:16.260 --> 05:14:17.540
the three high road principles

05:14:17.540 --> 05:14:19.820
of equity, job quality, and climate.

05:14:19.820 --> 05:14:23.660
So that's the approach that we're taking with high road

05:14:23.660 --> 05:14:25.540
and applying it not just to workforce programs,

05:14:25.540 --> 05:14:28.180
but also to policy in Sacramento.

05:14:28.180 --> 05:14:30.740
Job quality is starting with quality jobs in sectors,

05:14:30.740 --> 05:14:32.900
again, that are driving regional employment.

05:14:32.900 --> 05:14:37.900
And a good job has been defined in many places,

05:14:38.580 --> 05:14:42.060
but I think it's worth saying safe and just workplace,

05:14:42.060 --> 05:14:44.660
living wages, family health benefits,

05:14:44.660 --> 05:14:47.860
retirement and pension contributions if possible,

05:14:47.900 --> 05:14:50.180
investment and training and job mobility,

05:14:50.180 --> 05:14:52.380
worker voice and agency on the job

05:14:52.380 --> 05:14:54.700
and fair and predictable scheduling are just a few

05:14:54.700 --> 05:14:56.380
of those kinds of components that make up

05:14:56.380 --> 05:14:57.980
a good quality job.

05:14:57.980 --> 05:15:00.100
We can focus on those as a workforce system

05:15:00.100 --> 05:15:02.900
and attaching the people that we wanna impact to those.

05:15:02.900 --> 05:15:04.020
We can't achieve equity

05:15:04.020 --> 05:15:07.180
if we don't pay attention to job quality.

05:15:07.180 --> 05:15:10.500
And then equity is workforce programs

05:15:10.500 --> 05:15:13.260
that I think are doing really good on this score

05:15:14.260 --> 05:15:16.540
and focusing on populations

05:15:16.540 --> 05:15:18.140
that have significant barriers to employment.

05:15:18.140 --> 05:15:21.300
The trick is to make sure that we're not thinking

05:15:21.300 --> 05:15:24.180
that any job is a good job and kind of erasing that

05:15:24.180 --> 05:15:26.660
from the workforce culture and focusing

05:15:26.660 --> 05:15:29.140
on the best quality jobs and making sure we're getting

05:15:29.140 --> 05:15:31.740
people pathways to those jobs.

05:15:31.740 --> 05:15:35.180
And then finally, climate, focusing on building resiliency

05:15:35.180 --> 05:15:36.980
for industries and workers and communities

05:15:36.980 --> 05:15:38.740
that are most impacted by climate.

05:15:40.020 --> 05:15:43.580
Our end game is to increase economic equity

05:15:43.580 --> 05:15:46.260
by transforming the way whole industry sectors

05:15:46.780 --> 05:15:47.980
recruit, hire, promote and retain talent.

05:15:47.980 --> 05:15:48.820
I think we can do that.

05:15:48.820 --> 05:15:50.660
In fact, we are doing it.

05:15:50.660 --> 05:15:52.260
So we end up with a California economy

05:15:52.260 --> 05:15:53.820
that's defined by quality jobs.

05:15:53.820 --> 05:15:58.300
It's defined by equity and defined by climate resilience.

05:15:58.300 --> 05:16:00.980
So this is long game stuff.

05:16:02.620 --> 05:16:03.460
I'll end there.

05:16:03.460 --> 05:16:04.300
Thank you very much.

05:16:06.820 --> 05:16:08.300
Thank you so much, Tim.

05:16:08.300 --> 05:16:11.900
I always appreciate the hearing from you

05:16:11.900 --> 05:16:13.220
and your enthusiasm.

05:16:13.860 --> 05:16:17.300
I hope that I can mirror that enthusiasm

05:16:17.300 --> 05:16:21.740
for our Title II programs that I'm going to share about now.

05:16:21.740 --> 05:16:23.580
So I'd first like to, I'm going to jump through

05:16:23.580 --> 05:16:26.660
a couple of slides because Tim talked about

05:16:26.660 --> 05:16:31.340
the totality of the WIOA programs.

05:16:31.340 --> 05:16:33.540
And those include Title I,

05:16:33.540 --> 05:16:36.540
which is the dislocated worker adult,

05:16:36.540 --> 05:16:40.180
dislocated worker adult program and youth program.

05:16:40.180 --> 05:16:44.140
And he also talked about Title III, Wagner-Pyser

05:16:44.140 --> 05:16:49.140
and Title IV, which is vocational rehabilitation program.

05:16:49.340 --> 05:16:51.500
So he touched on those,

05:16:51.500 --> 05:16:55.580
but I really want to dive deeper into adult education

05:16:55.580 --> 05:16:58.900
and the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act,

05:16:58.900 --> 05:17:02.740
which is Title II of WIOA.

05:17:02.740 --> 05:17:06.780
And I first want to start with just one or two sentences

05:17:06.780 --> 05:17:11.300
about the history of adult education in California.

05:17:11.300 --> 05:17:16.300
We've been working for well over 150 years in California

05:17:17.060 --> 05:17:21.340
to help adults move their families forward

05:17:21.340 --> 05:17:24.020
on a solid economic path.

05:17:24.020 --> 05:17:29.020
Back in 1856, the San Francisco Board of Education

05:17:29.460 --> 05:17:33.140
opened night programs for immigrants

05:17:33.140 --> 05:17:34.580
to help them learn English

05:17:34.580 --> 05:17:37.220
and at that time, vocational skills.

05:17:37.220 --> 05:17:41.420
And so we have a solid footing in California

05:17:41.420 --> 05:17:46.420
in adult education and are probably one of the oldest states

05:17:46.860 --> 05:17:51.860
to offer adult education from such a long time ago.

05:17:52.300 --> 05:17:57.300
Title II, as you'll see, focuses on helping adults

05:17:57.740 --> 05:18:00.100
become literate, whether it's in English

05:18:00.100 --> 05:18:02.140
or just in general literacy

05:18:02.140 --> 05:18:05.500
to become economically self-sufficient.

05:18:05.500 --> 05:18:08.620
We also have the focus on family literacy

05:18:08.620 --> 05:18:12.260
where we're helping parents improve their skills

05:18:12.260 --> 05:18:14.300
to then also help their children

05:18:14.300 --> 05:18:16.780
improve their skills in school.

05:18:16.780 --> 05:18:19.460
That's the family literacy component.

05:18:19.460 --> 05:18:22.420
We're also looking at how we can help adults

05:18:22.420 --> 05:18:24.980
attain their secondary school diploma,

05:18:24.980 --> 05:18:28.340
whether that's through a high school diploma program

05:18:28.340 --> 05:18:33.340
or through an equivalency program such as GED or Hiset.

05:18:34.940 --> 05:18:38.620
We have a large focus on our immigrant population

05:18:38.620 --> 05:18:40.580
and as you'll see a little later,

05:18:40.580 --> 05:18:42.860
our immigrants and our students

05:18:42.860 --> 05:18:45.180
who speak a language other than English

05:18:45.180 --> 05:18:48.620
make up the majority of the individuals that we serve.

05:18:50.380 --> 05:18:52.540
In order to be served in adult education,

05:18:52.540 --> 05:18:54.900
you have to be 18 years of age or older

05:18:55.900 --> 05:18:59.780
and you do not need to have a social security number.

05:18:59.780 --> 05:19:04.020
You don't have to have any right to work documentation.

05:19:04.020 --> 05:19:06.700
This is a little different

05:19:06.700 --> 05:19:08.580
than some of the other title programs

05:19:08.580 --> 05:19:13.140
although we are working very hard as Tim has talked about

05:19:13.140 --> 05:19:15.540
to ensure equity.

05:19:15.540 --> 05:19:18.820
So we're striving to find as many services

05:19:18.820 --> 05:19:21.900
with our title partners.

05:19:21.980 --> 05:19:24.780
So we call title one, three and four

05:19:24.780 --> 05:19:28.020
to ensure that everyone can receive services.

05:19:29.140 --> 05:19:33.780
The students that come to us as Tim talked about

05:19:33.780 --> 05:19:35.820
often have some barriers

05:19:35.820 --> 05:19:39.140
and it could be that they have limited English,

05:19:39.140 --> 05:19:42.300
limited education, they may be in a low income job

05:19:42.300 --> 05:19:44.500
and wanna improve their skills

05:19:44.500 --> 05:19:47.460
and maybe coming to us with some disabilities

05:19:47.460 --> 05:19:50.140
or they may have some limited career skills

05:19:50.140 --> 05:19:52.540
and they want to improve those career skills.

05:19:54.220 --> 05:19:56.100
Tim also talked about co-enrollment

05:19:56.100 --> 05:19:59.100
and we've been working on co-enrollment in California

05:19:59.100 --> 05:20:03.700
for several years and feel that we're making great strides

05:20:03.700 --> 05:20:04.900
in co-enrollment.

05:20:04.900 --> 05:20:09.780
Co-enrollment is where students who are in adult education

05:20:09.780 --> 05:20:11.300
are also being served

05:20:11.300 --> 05:20:14.820
at our America's Job Centers for California

05:20:14.820 --> 05:20:16.060
or they're being served

05:20:16.060 --> 05:20:18.820
at the Department of Rehabilitation.

05:20:18.820 --> 05:20:20.780
And the idea is that they can help improve

05:20:20.780 --> 05:20:22.220
their English skills,

05:20:22.220 --> 05:20:25.540
they can earn that diploma or their equivalency

05:20:25.540 --> 05:20:28.740
and most importantly, we can help them to upskill

05:20:28.740 --> 05:20:33.340
into better, to good jobs as we're calling them.

05:20:34.500 --> 05:20:38.620
But we know that adults also in co-enrollment

05:20:38.620 --> 05:20:40.540
can learn these new career skills

05:20:40.540 --> 05:20:44.500
if they need to re-skill to move into a new career.

05:20:44.500 --> 05:20:47.860
They want to enter or re-enter the workforce,

05:20:47.860 --> 05:20:51.100
they again want to improve their reading or their math

05:20:51.100 --> 05:20:55.020
and also a big focus of our adult education programs

05:20:55.020 --> 05:20:57.140
is preparing students for citizenship.

05:21:01.060 --> 05:21:04.980
We're going to provide an overview of funding

05:21:04.980 --> 05:21:06.860
for adult education in California

05:21:06.860 --> 05:21:10.660
because WIOA is not our only source.

05:21:11.620 --> 05:21:16.540
We have programs that receive LCFF funding,

05:21:16.540 --> 05:21:19.100
the Local Control Funding Formula.

05:21:19.100 --> 05:21:21.060
If they're sitting in a community college

05:21:21.060 --> 05:21:24.180
non-credit program, they're receiving apportionment

05:21:24.180 --> 05:21:26.780
and many of our programs also,

05:21:26.780 --> 05:21:30.820
especially our community-based faith-based organizations

05:21:30.820 --> 05:21:33.900
receive donations and our library literacy programs

05:21:33.900 --> 05:21:37.500
are supported by state library funds.

05:21:37.500 --> 05:21:39.420
The bulk of the dollars though

05:21:39.420 --> 05:21:42.940
that support adult education in California

05:21:42.940 --> 05:21:46.300
come through the state from the adult education program

05:21:46.300 --> 05:21:51.300
called CAPE and we receive over $560 million

05:21:52.540 --> 05:21:56.540
in that fund source to support adult learning

05:21:56.540 --> 05:21:58.380
throughout the state.

05:21:58.380 --> 05:22:01.180
And then our WIOA Title II fund

05:22:01.180 --> 05:22:05.340
is around 107 million this last year.

05:22:07.540 --> 05:22:09.140
Where would you find adult programs?

05:22:09.140 --> 05:22:11.340
Where are they located?

05:22:11.340 --> 05:22:16.100
They're situated in K-12 schools or K-adult schools,

05:22:16.940 --> 05:22:18.620
so associated with the school district.

05:22:18.620 --> 05:22:21.900
They're in community college, non-credit programs,

05:22:21.900 --> 05:22:25.220
community faith-based organizations, libraries.

05:22:25.220 --> 05:22:29.300
We even have some workforce development boards

05:22:29.300 --> 05:22:31.940
that are offering Title II programs

05:22:31.940 --> 05:22:36.500
and corrections is another big area of focus.

05:22:38.060 --> 05:22:39.420
These are the program areas

05:22:39.420 --> 05:22:43.100
that you will find students learning in our programs,

05:22:43.100 --> 05:22:46.420
adult basic and secondary education programs

05:22:46.420 --> 05:22:48.620
for immigrants, including civics education,

05:22:48.620 --> 05:22:52.780
citizenship and ESL, family literacy,

05:22:52.780 --> 05:22:55.100
integrated education and training.

05:22:55.100 --> 05:22:58.460
This is where we are increasing our partnerships

05:22:58.460 --> 05:23:00.940
with our local workforce development boards

05:23:00.940 --> 05:23:03.260
and the high road training programs

05:23:03.260 --> 05:23:06.460
that in partnerships that Tim talked about,

05:23:06.460 --> 05:23:08.380
workforce entry and re-entry,

05:23:09.700 --> 05:23:12.780
adults with disabilities, pre-apprenticeships

05:23:12.780 --> 05:23:16.500
and short-term career technical education.

05:23:16.500 --> 05:23:18.420
Those three have asterisks

05:23:18.420 --> 05:23:23.260
because those programs cannot be supported with WIOA funds

05:23:23.260 --> 05:23:25.660
and they're only supported with our state funds.

05:23:27.900 --> 05:23:29.780
Now COVID certainly had an impact

05:23:29.780 --> 05:23:32.100
and that was part of the information

05:23:32.100 --> 05:23:35.700
that was included in our state plan modifications

05:23:35.700 --> 05:23:38.780
is how we reacted to COVID throughout the state.

05:23:38.780 --> 05:23:43.180
But as you can see, we have seen declining enrollment.

05:23:43.180 --> 05:23:46.060
I will say though that this year

05:23:46.060 --> 05:23:48.980
when we compare the first six months

05:23:48.980 --> 05:23:51.340
to last year's first six months,

05:23:51.340 --> 05:23:55.460
we are seeing a great uptick in enrollment in our programs.

05:23:57.540 --> 05:23:59.980
This slide just gives you a general overview

05:23:59.980 --> 05:24:04.980
of enrollment across the various programs in the state.

05:24:05.100 --> 05:24:08.700
There's a difference between students that are enrolled,

05:24:09.620 --> 05:24:12.180
reportable individuals and participants.

05:24:12.180 --> 05:24:16.300
And so when we're looking at our participants,

05:24:16.300 --> 05:24:20.300
those are students that have been enrolled in our programs

05:24:23.100 --> 05:24:27.140
for 12 or more hours of instruction

05:24:27.140 --> 05:24:30.180
and have a pre-test and a post-test.

05:24:30.180 --> 05:24:32.660
So they've been in the program long enough

05:24:32.660 --> 05:24:35.380
and had enough hours to be pre and post-tested.

05:24:36.380 --> 05:24:39.380
What do our students look like?

05:24:39.380 --> 05:24:44.380
We have over 60% of our students are Hispanic or Latino,

05:24:44.820 --> 05:24:49.820
16% Asian, 12 white and around 6% are African American.

05:24:52.140 --> 05:24:56.180
Nearly 50% of our students are between the ages of 24,

05:24:56.180 --> 05:25:00.060
25 and 44 and then our next largest demographic

05:25:00.060 --> 05:25:01.260
really were kind of equal there

05:25:01.260 --> 05:25:06.100
between the 19 and 24 year olds and the 45 and 54 year olds.

05:25:08.340 --> 05:25:10.780
Right now what's happening in many of our programs

05:25:10.780 --> 05:25:15.140
is we have all three types of instruction happening.

05:25:15.140 --> 05:25:20.100
We have online instruction, in-person instruction,

05:25:20.100 --> 05:25:22.220
as well as hybrid instruction.

05:25:22.220 --> 05:25:26.940
And instruction happens in adult education all the time.

05:25:26.940 --> 05:25:29.900
It can happen on a 24 hour cycle

05:25:29.940 --> 05:25:32.180
with our online instruction.

05:25:32.180 --> 05:25:36.780
And many of our programs found that they had increases

05:25:36.780 --> 05:25:39.460
in students through the online programs,

05:25:40.780 --> 05:25:44.420
logging on at 10 o'clock at night at one in the morning

05:25:44.420 --> 05:25:48.180
because they were able to work that into their work schedule.

05:25:48.180 --> 05:25:51.220
And that is truly a benefit of our programs.

05:25:52.420 --> 05:25:56.660
So in closing, I would just like to ask

05:25:56.660 --> 05:26:00.220
that the Board of Education approve the modifications

05:26:00.220 --> 05:26:05.220
to our state plan and I'm happy to answer any questions.

05:26:08.220 --> 05:26:10.900
Thank you so much, very inspiring.

05:26:12.300 --> 05:26:14.660
We want to put the public comment slide up

05:26:14.660 --> 05:26:17.460
so that people can queue up for public comment

05:26:18.500 --> 05:26:22.780
by calling the number and dialing the access code listed there.

05:26:22.780 --> 05:26:25.540
And before we go to public comment,

05:26:25.620 --> 05:26:28.060
I would like to see if our liaisons,

05:26:28.060 --> 05:26:30.220
member McQuillin and Rodriguez

05:26:30.220 --> 05:26:32.860
would like to offer some comments.

05:26:32.860 --> 05:26:33.780
Member McQuillin.

05:26:36.500 --> 05:26:39.580
Just want to thank the staff for their great presentation.

05:26:39.580 --> 05:26:41.940
It's such an important program

05:26:41.940 --> 05:26:46.380
to helping some of our most vulnerable community members

05:26:46.380 --> 05:26:50.220
who are trying to become more employable

05:26:50.220 --> 05:26:55.220
and get literacy skills and, you know,

05:26:55.300 --> 05:26:57.580
in some of our places that we really need

05:26:57.580 --> 05:27:00.340
to help people out in those vulnerable places,

05:27:00.340 --> 05:27:04.660
whether it be incarceration, our community centers

05:27:04.660 --> 05:27:06.820
and libraries and other locations.

05:27:06.820 --> 05:27:09.220
So such an important program.

05:27:09.220 --> 05:27:11.100
So thank you for the presentation.

05:27:12.940 --> 05:27:16.820
Member Rodriguez, I'd like to echo

05:27:16.820 --> 05:27:19.180
my fellow members comments.

05:27:19.180 --> 05:27:23.940
I think that both Mr. Tim Rainey and Carolyn Zachary

05:27:23.940 --> 05:27:27.900
did a wonderful job of overviewing this particular,

05:27:27.900 --> 05:27:29.460
giving all of the nuts and bolts.

05:27:29.460 --> 05:27:34.460
And so as a liaison, I will stick with the impact.

05:27:35.460 --> 05:27:37.620
I actually started in adult education.

05:27:37.620 --> 05:27:39.460
I started my career in teaching

05:27:39.460 --> 05:27:44.460
and in a community like mine, which is so impoverished

05:27:45.020 --> 05:27:49.620
and we have so many recent immigrants.

05:27:49.620 --> 05:27:52.420
I've noticed that adult education is a program

05:27:52.420 --> 05:27:55.260
that helps people gain confidence.

05:27:55.260 --> 05:27:58.220
Parents teach their children how to read.

05:27:59.260 --> 05:28:01.260
Sorry about that little cough in the background.

05:28:01.260 --> 05:28:03.860
My dog has a tracheal collapse.

05:28:06.660 --> 05:28:08.580
But you know, there are so many opportunities,

05:28:08.580 --> 05:28:13.580
adults who need diplomas to move up in their jobs,

05:28:15.340 --> 05:28:17.340
moms learning English so that they can support

05:28:17.340 --> 05:28:20.420
their families and then additionally,

05:28:20.420 --> 05:28:22.300
which is another item that we'll see tomorrow,

05:28:23.140 --> 05:28:25.900
but the CT opportunities for the adults

05:28:25.900 --> 05:28:28.660
where they can venture down new career pathways.

05:28:28.660 --> 05:28:33.660
And that's where watching the parents become empowered,

05:28:34.580 --> 05:28:36.500
you know, it trickles into the family,

05:28:36.500 --> 05:28:38.540
especially the adult literacy, right?

05:28:38.540 --> 05:28:40.940
You know, when there's family literacy programs.

05:28:42.540 --> 05:28:43.380
Thank you.

05:28:45.660 --> 05:28:47.300
Very, very helpful.

05:28:47.300 --> 05:28:49.180
Do we have any public comment?

05:28:50.060 --> 05:28:51.740
We do, there is one caller in the queue.

05:28:51.740 --> 05:28:53.380
I will open up the phone line now.

05:28:59.060 --> 05:28:59.940
Good afternoon, caller.

05:28:59.940 --> 05:29:01.860
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:29:01.860 --> 05:29:02.700
You have one minute.

05:29:02.700 --> 05:29:03.700
Your time starts now.

05:29:05.380 --> 05:29:07.020
Hi, this is Hayen Kimner

05:29:07.020 --> 05:29:10.020
with the California Community Schools Learning Exchange.

05:29:10.020 --> 05:29:11.500
We're thrilled to hear this update

05:29:11.500 --> 05:29:13.500
that reflects your commitment to cultivating

05:29:13.500 --> 05:29:16.500
and strengthening alignment and partnerships

05:29:16.500 --> 05:29:19.460
in support of a holistic approach to equitable learning,

05:29:19.460 --> 05:29:22.660
innovation and improvement and capacity building.

05:29:22.660 --> 05:29:25.820
This particular use of the federal WIAO

05:29:25.820 --> 05:29:27.900
to support family and adult literacy

05:29:27.900 --> 05:29:31.460
is an important facet to an LEA's community school strategy,

05:29:31.460 --> 05:29:34.940
if done intentionally, to integrate and align efforts,

05:29:34.940 --> 05:29:36.940
communities, partners and staff.

05:29:36.940 --> 05:29:39.580
Not only is this about engaging adults and families,

05:29:39.580 --> 05:29:42.340
but connecting it to support K-12 literacy,

05:29:42.340 --> 05:29:43.860
higher ed and workforce partners

05:29:43.860 --> 05:29:45.260
and other municipal partners

05:29:45.260 --> 05:29:48.020
is the work of community schools in action.

05:29:48.020 --> 05:29:51.300
And these important community schools muscles of partnership

05:29:51.300 --> 05:29:54.140
are integral to maximizing all of our state

05:29:54.140 --> 05:29:56.460
and federal investments and transformation.

05:29:56.460 --> 05:29:57.900
Thank you so much.

05:29:57.900 --> 05:29:59.180
Thank you.

05:29:59.180 --> 05:30:02.060
And that concludes public comment for item number six.

05:30:04.020 --> 05:30:04.860
Thank you.

05:30:04.860 --> 05:30:09.220
And that was a wonderful connecting of the dots

05:30:09.220 --> 05:30:11.020
between our community schools initiatives

05:30:11.020 --> 05:30:14.100
and many of the adult education initiatives

05:30:14.100 --> 05:30:15.740
and workforce initiatives

05:30:15.740 --> 05:30:19.420
that really do make a big difference in that context.

05:30:19.420 --> 05:30:22.180
So I now wanna just ask the board members

05:30:22.180 --> 05:30:25.500
if there's any discussion or questions

05:30:25.500 --> 05:30:26.740
or comments on the item.

05:30:30.940 --> 05:30:32.820
Yes, member McClellan.

05:30:32.820 --> 05:30:36.540
So did I, just clarification going forward,

05:30:36.540 --> 05:30:39.740
this is a modification at the two year junction

05:30:39.740 --> 05:30:43.060
and then next year we'll be diving in further

05:30:43.060 --> 05:30:47.460
to modify the plan or create a whole new plan.

05:30:47.460 --> 05:30:48.820
Is that what I heard?

05:30:48.820 --> 05:30:49.660
Thank you.

05:30:49.660 --> 05:30:50.500
Yes.

05:30:50.500 --> 05:30:51.540
Yes, that's correct.

05:30:54.420 --> 05:30:55.260
Thank you.

05:30:58.140 --> 05:31:00.100
Any other comments or questions?

05:31:03.860 --> 05:31:07.260
All right, member McClellan, your hand is still up.

05:31:07.260 --> 05:31:09.780
Is that another comment or are you ready to make a motion?

05:31:09.780 --> 05:31:13.020
I'm ready to make the motion to adopt the plan

05:31:13.980 --> 05:31:16.140
with the modifications as stated.

05:31:17.460 --> 05:31:19.020
Do I have a second?

05:31:19.020 --> 05:31:20.060
Second it.

05:31:20.060 --> 05:31:21.100
Thank you very much.

05:31:23.100 --> 05:31:24.860
And is there any further discussion?

05:31:26.300 --> 05:31:30.060
All right, is there any further discussion?

05:31:30.060 --> 05:31:32.260
I just wanted to appreciate the call out

05:31:32.260 --> 05:31:34.380
on family literacy and the lifting up

05:31:34.380 --> 05:31:36.420
of the two generation approach,

05:31:36.420 --> 05:31:39.100
which I think is such an important through line

05:31:39.100 --> 05:31:40.540
to all of our K to 12 schools,

05:31:40.540 --> 05:31:43.140
but also just making sure that it is,

05:31:44.140 --> 05:31:45.980
it hasn't always, I think, been lifted up

05:31:45.980 --> 05:31:47.860
and I appreciate that you all are doing that.

05:31:47.860 --> 05:31:49.260
Thank you.

05:31:49.260 --> 05:31:50.260
Perfect, thank you.

05:31:51.740 --> 05:31:53.740
All right, seeing no more discussion,

05:31:53.740 --> 05:31:57.020
Brooks, please call the roll for the vote.

05:31:57.020 --> 05:31:58.860
Member Rodriguez.

05:31:58.860 --> 05:32:00.220
Yes.

05:32:00.220 --> 05:32:01.380
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:32:02.740 --> 05:32:03.660
Yes.

05:32:03.660 --> 05:32:04.580
Member McClellan.

05:32:07.020 --> 05:32:08.100
Yes.

05:32:08.100 --> 05:32:09.380
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

05:32:10.380 --> 05:32:11.580
Yes.

05:32:11.580 --> 05:32:13.100
Member Olken.

05:32:13.100 --> 05:32:13.940
Member Lewis.

05:32:14.860 --> 05:32:16.140
Yes.

05:32:16.140 --> 05:32:17.580
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:32:19.180 --> 05:32:20.140
Yes.

05:32:20.140 --> 05:32:20.980
Member Escobedo.

05:32:22.180 --> 05:32:23.460
Yes.

05:32:23.460 --> 05:32:24.740
President Darlin-Hammond.

05:32:25.820 --> 05:32:26.820
Yes.

05:32:26.820 --> 05:32:27.660
Member Bonacca.

05:32:28.860 --> 05:32:29.860
Aye.

05:32:29.860 --> 05:32:30.700
Motion carries.

05:32:32.420 --> 05:32:35.780
All right, terrific, thank you very much

05:32:35.780 --> 05:32:38.500
for the presentation, as I said, very inspiring

05:32:38.580 --> 05:32:43.500
and we can move on now to our last items,

05:32:43.500 --> 05:32:45.380
which are the consent agenda.

05:32:47.780 --> 05:32:52.780
And the regular consent items are items eight through 10.

05:32:53.860 --> 05:32:56.140
We do want to open up the phone line again

05:32:56.140 --> 05:33:00.900
for a public comment on those consent items.

05:33:00.900 --> 05:33:03.940
Members of the public wishing to provide comment,

05:33:03.940 --> 05:33:05.980
they do so by calling the telephone number

05:33:06.020 --> 05:33:08.020
using the access code provided

05:33:08.020 --> 05:33:10.220
on the slide that is showing now.

05:33:10.220 --> 05:33:12.900
And we'll give it a little bit of wait time,

05:33:12.900 --> 05:33:17.140
just in case people are trying to queue up for comment.

05:33:18.780 --> 05:33:22.340
Give it a few more seconds before we check in.

05:33:32.940 --> 05:33:35.700
Do we have anyone queuing up for public comment?

05:33:36.460 --> 05:33:38.900
There is no one signed up for public comment.

05:33:40.060 --> 05:33:45.060
All right, so given that there is no public comment,

05:33:45.060 --> 05:33:48.180
I'll ask for a motion on consent for items eight through 10.

05:33:48.180 --> 05:33:49.100
Do I have a motion?

05:33:51.060 --> 05:33:52.340
So moved.

05:33:52.340 --> 05:33:53.980
Thank you, do I have a second?

05:33:56.460 --> 05:33:57.500
Second.

05:33:57.500 --> 05:33:59.060
Thank you very much.

05:33:59.060 --> 05:34:00.820
We'll now hold a roll call vote.

05:34:00.820 --> 05:34:02.860
Brooks, please call the roll.

05:34:02.860 --> 05:34:03.780

05:34:15.340 --> 05:34:16.420

05:34:16.420 --> 05:34:17.620

05:34:17.620 --> 05:34:18.580

05:34:20.540 --> 05:34:21.700

05:34:21.700 --> 05:34:23.140
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:34:24.580 --> 05:34:25.940

05:34:25.940 --> 05:34:26.780
Member Escobedo.

05:34:27.980 --> 05:34:29.100

05:34:29.100 --> 05:34:31.140
President Darlene Hammond.

05:34:31.140 --> 05:34:32.020
Yes.

05:34:32.020 --> 05:34:32.860
Member Bonacca.

05:34:34.020 --> 05:34:35.020
Aye.

05:34:35.060 --> 05:34:35.900
Motion carries.

05:34:37.300 --> 05:34:38.140
All right.

05:34:38.980 --> 05:34:43.620
I want to applaud the expeditiousness of all of us

05:34:43.620 --> 05:34:46.980
and our colleagues at the State Department of Education.

05:34:46.980 --> 05:34:50.500
We have made it through day one of our board meeting,

05:34:50.500 --> 05:34:53.380
and so grab that extra time,

05:34:53.380 --> 05:34:56.460
go get a walk or a latte

05:34:56.460 --> 05:34:58.220
or whatever strikes your fancy.

05:34:58.220 --> 05:35:01.860
We will see you tomorrow at 8.30 a.m.

05:35:01.860 --> 05:35:02.700
Thank you.

05:35:05.020 --> 05:35:05.860
Thank you.
