you

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
you

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
Jim O'Toole thank you very much. I will now hold a roll call vote.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.560
Brooks, please call the roll.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.320
Ms. Darlene Hammond.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.680
Aye.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.080
Ms. Cabello.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.200
Aye.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.000
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.240
Yes.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.640
Ms. Lewis.

06:09.640 --> 06:10.920
Yes.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.440
Ms. McQuillan.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.880
Aye.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.600
Ms. Olken.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.600
Yes.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.640
Ms. Roscoe-Gonzalez.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.040
Aye.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.720
Ms. Patilabraunsen.

06:22.720 --> 06:23.920
Yes.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.200
Ms. Porter.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.480
Aye.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.840
Ms. Rodriguez.

06:28.320 --> 06:29.400
Yes.

06:29.400 --> 06:31.400
Mr. Yoshimoto-Towry.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.480
Yes.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.480
The motion carries unanimously.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.560
All right, thank you.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.800
We're gonna move on now to item 12.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.320
Item 12 is the State Annual Performance Report

06:43.320 --> 06:45.720
for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities

06:45.720 --> 06:50.720
Education Act, covering program year 2021 to 2022.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.240
The California Department of Education recommends

06:54.240 --> 06:57.320
that we review and approve the executive summary

06:57.480 --> 07:02.480
for the FFY 2021 APR for Part B of the IDEA,

07:02.560 --> 07:05.120
covering program year 2021 to 22,

07:05.120 --> 07:08.200
as prepared by the Special Education Division.

07:08.200 --> 07:12.480
And the item will be presented by Heather Kalamis of the CDE.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.880
Heather, please begin.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.840
Good morning.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.600
It's a pleasure to see you all present

07:19.600 --> 07:23.160
the Special Education Division's FYI 2021 update

07:23.160 --> 07:25.480
of our annual performance report.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.480
In addition to hearing how the state of California

07:28.480 --> 07:29.960
is progressing towards our targets,

07:29.960 --> 07:32.240
you will also hear how the Special Education Division

07:32.240 --> 07:35.080
is working to improve our performance on the targets,

07:35.080 --> 07:36.840
as well as the partnerships we have strengthened

07:36.840 --> 07:39.280
both internally and externally to improve outcomes

07:39.280 --> 07:41.240
for students with disabilities.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.120
With that, we'll get started with a few slides

07:43.120 --> 07:46.720
that will ground us in data in terms of who we're serving,

07:46.720 --> 07:49.560
and remind you that we serve a student population

07:49.560 --> 07:52.880
that is rich in diversity and rich in need across our state.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.560
We will also then take a deeper dive

07:54.560 --> 07:58.200
across our 17 federally mandated indicators,

07:58.200 --> 08:01.000
and then finally we'll highlight the partnerships

08:01.000 --> 08:03.280
and the work that's being done across the state,

08:03.280 --> 08:05.240
and hear from our Multilingual Support Division

08:05.240 --> 08:07.680
and our Early Education Division on joint efforts

08:07.680 --> 08:09.440
across our division to support students

08:09.440 --> 08:11.040
with disabilities as well.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.520
What you see here are typical slides

08:14.520 --> 08:16.680
just in terms of overall who we're serving

08:16.680 --> 08:18.520
in the state of California.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.720
Our total enrollment in this slide here

08:20.720 --> 08:23.280
is reflective of students with disabilities

08:23.280 --> 08:25.880
from birth to age 22.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.520
As you can see, there's been a slight decrease

08:28.520 --> 08:31.080
in total enrollment of students with disabilities

08:31.080 --> 08:32.960
over the past two years.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.520
Not different or similar to the overall

08:36.520 --> 08:39.600
general education population decline in enrollment

08:39.600 --> 08:41.400
in the state of California as well.

08:43.920 --> 08:46.760
This next slide here just walks us through

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
the past 10 years of both population of K-12 students

08:53.280 --> 08:55.920
and also the percentage of students with disabilities

08:55.920 --> 08:58.880
in the state of California over the past 10 years.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.120
As you can see here, while there's been a decrease

09:03.120 --> 09:06.160
in overall enrollment, the percentage of students

09:06.160 --> 09:08.440
with disabilities has grown, right?

09:08.440 --> 09:10.280
So it's an interesting dynamic here

09:10.280 --> 09:14.360
that obviously for us here in the state of California

09:14.400 --> 09:17.520
continues to show the need for resources,

09:17.520 --> 09:20.440
state investments, and statewide support for LEAs

09:20.440 --> 09:22.240
and professional development for educators,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.840
paraprofessionals, and administrators as well.

09:24.840 --> 09:27.480
This is a number we will certainly keep our eyes on

09:27.480 --> 09:30.640
to ensure that we have effective systems

09:30.640 --> 09:32.280
and supports in place as well.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.560
These slides here, similar to previous years,

09:40.560 --> 09:45.080
there has not been much change from our last APR cycle.

09:45.080 --> 09:48.040
The numbers have stayed consistently from year to year.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.440
The only addition or sort of change was the,

09:51.440 --> 09:55.560
there was about a 1% increase for both foster youth

09:55.560 --> 09:58.720
and socioeconomically disadvantaged students

09:58.720 --> 10:01.400
in terms of the local control funding formula as well.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.640
But the numbers have stayed about the same

10:05.640 --> 10:06.880
over the past two years.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.880
In terms of the percentage of students with IEPs

10:11.880 --> 10:14.800
in one or more of the LCFF student groups

10:14.800 --> 10:19.160
for the previous year, again, stayed fairly consistent.

10:19.160 --> 10:24.160
No large increases or decreases in this category as well.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.920
In terms of over the past six months,

10:30.920 --> 10:34.160
the special education division has been engaging

10:34.160 --> 10:36.400
in strategic planning and priority setting,

10:36.920 --> 10:38.720
which I hope the board can hear about soon

10:38.720 --> 10:40.200
in the coming months.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.360
The work of our division can be bucketed

10:42.360 --> 10:44.880
into the following areas that you see here,

10:44.880 --> 10:47.840
monitoring and target technical assistance,

10:47.840 --> 10:52.240
data collection and reporting, effective dispute resolution,

10:52.240 --> 10:54.320
inter-agency professional development,

10:54.320 --> 10:57.240
fiscal management, and non-public schools.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.080
As such, we have a very large division

11:00.080 --> 11:03.720
and oversee a wide variety of activities

11:03.720 --> 11:05.760
in terms of our general supervision.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.160
But we, in terms of our strategic planning,

11:08.160 --> 11:12.240
are developing priorities to ensure that we have aligned

11:12.240 --> 11:14.560
and integrated data-driven governance

11:14.560 --> 11:16.200
and accountability and support systems

11:16.200 --> 11:19.000
that reflect the priorities of equity, diversity,

11:19.000 --> 11:22.080
and inclusion, inclusive practices that are driven

11:22.080 --> 11:24.880
by high-quality program, planned and documented

11:24.880 --> 11:27.800
with high-quality IEPs, and also ensuring

11:27.800 --> 11:30.080
that we have healthy and a well-trained workforce

11:30.080 --> 11:31.560
to professional development systems

11:31.560 --> 11:33.040
and recruitment efforts as well.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.520
So more to come on the strategic planning.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.080
But certainly this is also a piece

11:37.080 --> 11:39.480
that is guiding our work moving forward as well.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.280
In terms of our monitoring system,

11:45.680 --> 11:48.600
the special education has a tiered monitoring system.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.800
And the state of California has made investments

11:50.800 --> 11:53.240
over the past two years to better align

11:53.240 --> 11:56.600
both special education and general education systems.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.840
For instance, the LCAP addendum,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.720
the group parent participation.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.320
There is a tremendous opportunity for deep engagement

12:03.320 --> 12:05.600
at the SCA level, county office level,

12:05.600 --> 12:08.440
SOPA level, and LEA level to improve outcomes

12:08.440 --> 12:10.440
for students with disabilities.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.640
We must ensure that our systems are designed

12:12.640 --> 12:14.640
in a way that supports all learners

12:14.640 --> 12:17.080
and reflects efforts across multiple areas

12:17.080 --> 12:18.560
to reach our goal.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.560
It's important to note that roughly 177 of LEAs

12:24.480 --> 12:27.880
in differentiated assistance for students with disabilities

12:27.880 --> 12:30.360
have already conducted a data analysis

12:30.360 --> 12:32.680
and root cause analysis to address outcomes

12:32.680 --> 12:34.200
for students with disabilities

12:34.200 --> 12:37.240
through our special education SIM process,

12:37.240 --> 12:39.920
which you'll hear about in just a few moments,

12:39.920 --> 12:44.800
that our special education division has developed.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.680
These processes and outputs can and should be leveraged

12:48.680 --> 12:52.160
within the DA process and included in the LCAP.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.560
These LEAs already have a jumpstart

12:54.560 --> 12:56.360
in terms of integrated improvement plan

12:56.360 --> 12:58.960
for students with disabilities.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.640
As part of the legal requirement to monitor

13:06.640 --> 13:09.080
local education agencies, LEAs,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.920
the special education supports our districts

13:11.920 --> 13:14.720
to address both compliance and performance areas

13:14.720 --> 13:16.200
through a process that we call

13:16.200 --> 13:19.880
Compliance and Improvement Monitoring, or CIM, C-I-M.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.960
The process places LEAs into tiers of support

13:22.960 --> 13:25.080
and differentiates the support and engagement

13:25.080 --> 13:27.360
based on the need of the LEA.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.320
The CIM is a three-step process that assists LEAs

13:31.280 --> 13:33.520
in answering the following questions.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.200
What's occurring in the district?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.920
Why is this occurring in the district?

13:36.920 --> 13:40.040
And how can we make effective lasting change?

13:40.040 --> 13:44.480
And LEAs engage directly both with CDE and TE providers

13:44.480 --> 13:46.360
through our statewide system of support

13:46.360 --> 13:49.880
and a number of activities such as integrated data analysis,

13:49.880 --> 13:52.120
assessment of infrastructure,

13:52.120 --> 13:54.640
educational partner feedback and focus groups,

13:54.640 --> 13:57.920
root cause analysis, and prioritization.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.520
And all of these activities are with an emphasis

14:00.520 --> 14:03.680
placed on high leverage activities for maximum impact.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.720
The remaining LEAs will also be going through

14:06.720 --> 14:11.120
the CIM process in 2023 this year with the support of CDE.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.400
All of the CIM resources that LEAs use

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
for improvement planning are available to LEAs

14:15.400 --> 14:18.280
and also are for use in the DA,

14:18.280 --> 14:21.160
or differentiated assistance process as well.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.160
We have carefully thought and built out tools.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.240
Technical assistance and support for LEAs

14:26.240 --> 14:28.640
will be going through CIM in the DA process.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.440
And again, our staff will be working very closely

14:31.440 --> 14:35.160
with differentiated assistance teams and LEAs in the future

14:35.160 --> 14:38.000
to make these resources known and available

14:38.000 --> 14:39.640
so that LEAs can continue to work

14:39.640 --> 14:41.200
throughout the process as well.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.480
In terms of how LEAs are selected for the CIM process,

14:45.480 --> 14:48.600
these are the areas in which each year

14:48.600 --> 14:51.080
the California Department of Education is required

14:51.080 --> 14:54.160
to make what we call annual determinations.

14:54.200 --> 14:58.320
These determinations designate LEAs into the tiers

14:58.320 --> 15:00.400
and determines a level of support.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.000
As you can see here, these five areas

15:04.000 --> 15:06.600
are the areas in which CDE

15:06.600 --> 15:08.560
and our technical assistance providers

15:08.560 --> 15:10.440
provide additional support.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.920
The CIM process, which I spoke a little bit about before here,

15:19.920 --> 15:23.480
again, just sort of a little bit of a visual to the words

15:23.480 --> 15:26.960
in terms of first, again, what is occurring in the district,

15:26.960 --> 15:28.560
that's step one, right?

15:28.560 --> 15:31.800
To figure out what is exactly happening.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.680
Two is investigation, right?

15:33.680 --> 15:35.960
Really sort of drilling down into that root cause analysis

15:35.960 --> 15:37.640
in terms of the why.

15:37.640 --> 15:41.800
And then the third step is the planning process.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.520
And so a comprehensive plan has been developed

15:45.520 --> 15:49.000
for implementation using parts of other plans

15:49.000 --> 15:51.920
that may, or other data, but there is a comprehensive plan

15:51.920 --> 15:56.040
that is developed at the end in which the LEA will use

15:56.040 --> 15:58.200
and utilize as a living document

15:58.200 --> 16:00.000
for continuous improvement efforts.

16:02.040 --> 16:07.320
In years two and three, the process continues.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.680
We know through the lens of continuous improvement

16:09.680 --> 16:11.560
that change takes time.

16:11.560 --> 16:16.480
So steps four include a sort of a step back

16:16.480 --> 16:20.160
and an assessment of actually how the plan is going

16:20.200 --> 16:22.400
and are we meeting those expectations and the goals

16:22.400 --> 16:25.640
in which the LEA set forth.

16:25.640 --> 16:30.000
And so if not, then there is a period of adjustment

16:30.000 --> 16:33.520
to ensure that the LEA is on track.

16:33.520 --> 16:40.240
The implementation updates occur in partnership with CDE as well

16:40.240 --> 16:43.840
to ensure that LEAs are on track to meet their goals.

16:43.840 --> 16:48.520
And then in year three, there is continued implementation.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.320
The LEAs continue to implement the plan,

16:52.320 --> 16:55.120
review any local data that might be relevant,

16:55.120 --> 17:00.080
and then also provide any updates to CDE.

17:00.080 --> 17:04.000
And then also they, again, work with us very closely

17:04.000 --> 17:06.840
to ensure that their plan is aligned tightly

17:06.840 --> 17:09.480
to their goals as well.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.040
All right, so that's just a little bit about an overview

17:12.040 --> 17:13.880
of who we serve in the special education

17:13.880 --> 17:17.160
and how we go about doing our work in terms of monitoring

17:17.160 --> 17:19.240
and support for LEAs.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.440
Wanted to shift our attention to the annual performance report

17:22.440 --> 17:24.960
in and of itself and walk through a few

17:24.960 --> 17:27.680
of the key indicators here today.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.720
We won't walk through every single one,

17:29.720 --> 17:31.840
but you do have them in your packet.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.320
But I will be highlighting several key indicators

17:34.320 --> 17:37.280
throughout the course of this presentation.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.360
The annual performance report is a requirement

17:41.360 --> 17:43.280
of the California Department of Education,

17:43.280 --> 17:47.000
is required of the Office of Special Education Programs.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.200
The State Board of Education must approve this plan

17:49.200 --> 17:53.560
prior to submission to OSEP next month in February.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.360
If you do recall, the targets for this current cycle

17:57.360 --> 18:01.200
that we're in, fiscal year 2020 to 2025,

18:01.200 --> 18:05.200
were approved at the SBE meeting in 2021 last year.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.200
Any of the previous APRs

18:08.200 --> 18:10.960
or state systemic improvement plans can be found

18:10.960 --> 18:14.640
on our website for your reference as well.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.040
I do wanna sort of preface before I jump in,

18:18.040 --> 18:20.880
this is certainly a required activity,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.640
but I think also it's a meaningful activity

18:23.640 --> 18:27.040
for us at the state and really takes shape

18:27.040 --> 18:31.560
and brings sort of a focus area for our work moving forward

18:31.560 --> 18:34.240
as best we can align with our statewide system of support

18:34.240 --> 18:36.480
and our technical assistance and really utilize

18:36.480 --> 18:39.360
and drive these indicators for meaningful change

18:39.360 --> 18:41.520
across the state of California.

18:42.480 --> 18:47.480
So I will jump in here and talk just about

18:47.960 --> 18:52.520
a few of the compliance indicators that you see before you.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.200
These compliance indicators are set

18:55.200 --> 18:57.120
by the federal government, OSEP,

18:57.120 --> 18:59.640
they are either zero or 100.

19:00.840 --> 19:05.560
And so in terms of the, a couple of reminders here

19:05.560 --> 19:10.560
is that indicator 4B is suspension

19:11.440 --> 19:14.200
and expulsion is lag year data.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.200
So that data is reflective of 2020, 2021.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.160
So you see a zero percent here,

19:22.160 --> 19:24.440
that number is likely representative

19:24.440 --> 19:26.720
of distance learning environments

19:26.720 --> 19:30.440
where students were not able to attend school

19:30.440 --> 19:32.840
in the physical sense.

19:32.840 --> 19:35.400
We do expect this number to go up,

19:35.400 --> 19:38.000
hopefully not too much obviously,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.680
as students have returned to classroom.

19:39.680 --> 19:43.400
So next year, this time around,

19:43.400 --> 19:45.480
you will see that number change.

19:45.480 --> 19:49.280
And again, it's because there is a little bit of a lag

19:49.280 --> 19:51.040
year data in that as well.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.680
In terms of, just wanna talk just a little bit about

19:59.680 --> 20:04.680
sort of disproportionate and significant disproportionality.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.200
You know, disproportionality here is a,

20:09.200 --> 20:12.800
really what we call an early warning system.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.160
And so LEAs who have been identified

20:16.160 --> 20:18.080
for disproportionality are required

20:18.080 --> 20:21.480
in a three year process.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.520
The first year is to conduct a root cause analysis.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.240
Second year, they are required

20:29.240 --> 20:31.440
to implement change practices.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.120
And then the third year,

20:33.120 --> 20:35.240
if they are found disproportionate,

20:35.240 --> 20:37.960
they are found to be significantly disproportionate,

20:37.960 --> 20:40.240
which means they must set aside 15%

20:40.240 --> 20:43.360
of their IEDA federal award to develop a plan

20:43.360 --> 20:46.280
to address the needs of the district

20:46.280 --> 20:49.880
and the specific need for the student body in question.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.560
One of the compliance indicators

20:53.560 --> 20:56.000
that I wanted to highlight for you here

20:56.000 --> 20:58.520
was early childhood transition.

20:58.520 --> 21:01.840
I think that this particular indicator,

21:02.240 --> 21:06.440
we saw such a steep decrease last year.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.960
This year, we have seen a noticeable increase.

21:10.960 --> 21:14.600
This could be contributed in continuing ongoing investments

21:14.600 --> 21:16.880
that CDE and the state budget have made

21:16.880 --> 21:20.800
in early childhood and our continued partnership with DDS.

21:20.800 --> 21:25.480
The state budget gave CDE $850,000

21:25.480 --> 21:28.720
and six positions to form a new unit in special education,

21:28.720 --> 21:31.000
specifically to strengthen the transition process

21:31.000 --> 21:32.360
of young children with disabilities

21:32.360 --> 21:35.440
from part C to part B services.

21:35.440 --> 21:39.040
This will allow CDE to work closely with DDS

21:39.040 --> 21:41.600
to encourage a seamless transition and coordination

21:41.600 --> 21:43.080
in our state, regional centers,

21:43.080 --> 21:45.040
and at the local level as well.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.480
In addition, the budget commits $700,000

21:47.480 --> 21:51.200
in federal IDEA funds for the CDE to partner

21:51.200 --> 21:55.080
with the California Department of Developmental Services

21:55.080 --> 21:58.160
to develop parent-friendly resources on transition services,

21:58.160 --> 22:01.680
including the difference between part C and part B services,

22:01.680 --> 22:04.160
options for students after they turn three,

22:04.160 --> 22:06.720
and an overview of the transition processes,

22:06.720 --> 22:09.440
processes and transitions timelines.

22:09.440 --> 22:13.800
We do know that transition for our youngest learners

22:13.800 --> 22:16.440
and our families can often be a scary time.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.680
And we are certainly pleased that this number has increased,

22:19.680 --> 22:22.440
particularly over time and particularly during COVID.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.760
And this is an area that we will continue to focus on

22:24.760 --> 22:28.320
as we know that a smooth and seamless transition

22:28.320 --> 22:30.920
to part B services can set the trajectory

22:30.920 --> 22:34.840
for student success throughout their educational career.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.400
And this will be a continued focus area for us

22:37.400 --> 22:41.240
at the state here as well.

22:41.240 --> 22:46.000
In terms of the performance indicators,

22:46.000 --> 22:50.600
this roadmap here, which you may have seen before,

22:50.600 --> 22:54.720
visualizes how a student is placed and supported

22:54.720 --> 22:56.400
in their least restrictive environment

22:56.400 --> 22:59.720
can have lower instances of discipline.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.440
And this means they are spending more time in the classroom

23:03.440 --> 23:05.480
receiving their instructional minutes,

23:05.480 --> 23:07.400
which can lead to better outcomes

23:07.400 --> 23:09.920
as measured by statewide assessments, graduation rate,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.320
and post-school outcomes.

23:11.320 --> 23:15.640
So we know that a healthy start to education begins at birth.

23:15.640 --> 23:20.120
We know that it starts with high quality early childhood care

23:20.120 --> 23:23.240
and supports and services, with timely assessments,

23:23.280 --> 23:25.200
with appropriate instruction,

23:25.200 --> 23:29.320
and then also provided in the right setting

23:29.320 --> 23:31.600
will lead to those post-school outcomes

23:31.600 --> 23:34.200
that we want to see for all of our students as well.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.840
In terms of our theory of action as well,

23:42.840 --> 23:46.280
again, just sort of a different spin on what I just said,

23:46.280 --> 23:49.400
but again, this combination of, again,

23:49.400 --> 23:52.120
ensuring that we have the right placement for students,

23:52.120 --> 23:55.760
the right supports, coupled with high quality instruction,

23:55.760 --> 23:58.160
oftentimes we know leads to a reduction

23:58.160 --> 24:02.520
in behavior problems, which leads to increased time

24:02.520 --> 24:04.800
in the classroom, increased participation

24:04.800 --> 24:06.640
in the student's learning environment,

24:06.640 --> 24:10.440
which in theory then should translate to graduation

24:10.440 --> 24:13.720
and post-secondary achievement for each student as well.

24:16.920 --> 24:20.440
In terms of the performance indicators that you see here

24:20.480 --> 24:22.560
in front of you as well,

24:22.560 --> 24:26.280
I won't be going through each indicator in the presentation,

24:26.280 --> 24:29.160
all of these indicators, again, within your item.

24:29.160 --> 24:33.080
I will highlight the work that's being done around indicators one,

24:33.080 --> 24:37.680
which is graduation, 4A, suspension, expulsion,

24:37.680 --> 24:40.880
five, educational environments, or LRE,

24:40.880 --> 24:45.880
six, preschool LRE, and 14, just post-school transition.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.320
And again, I think it's important to note that indicators one,

24:50.320 --> 24:54.240
which is graduation, indicator two, dropout,

24:54.240 --> 24:57.760
and 4A are all lag year data,

24:57.760 --> 25:00.640
so these are data pulled from the previous year.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.520
This is the second half of our performance indicators.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.520
Again, won't go through every single one.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.200
I did want to draw out,

25:14.200 --> 25:16.040
and we'll talk a little bit more about it later,

25:16.040 --> 25:17.640
but the post-school outcomes,

25:17.680 --> 25:21.360
we did see some steep decreases last year due to COVID,

25:21.360 --> 25:24.320
and then we're seeing some numbers rebound

25:24.320 --> 25:27.000
as we would like this year as well.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.440
In terms of the performance indicator six,

25:31.440 --> 25:33.880
preschool and least restrictive environment,

25:33.880 --> 25:36.440
this is an indicator that as noted

25:36.440 --> 25:41.160
in last year's presentation to the State Board of Education,

25:41.160 --> 25:43.520
the Office of Special Education Programs

25:43.520 --> 25:46.200
changed the measurement of indicator six

25:46.200 --> 25:49.520
to exclude five-year-old kindergartners.

25:49.520 --> 25:52.600
They had previously been counted in this indicator,

25:52.600 --> 25:56.120
so again, we did expect to see a significant impact

25:56.120 --> 25:57.920
to this indicator this year

25:57.920 --> 26:00.520
after the removal of those students.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.120
This year's data reflects, I think,

26:03.120 --> 26:07.720
sort of a continued refinement to the reported data,

26:07.720 --> 26:12.120
and while it may seem in 2021, 2022

26:12.120 --> 26:16.880
that the indicator 6A decreased by 10%

26:16.880 --> 26:21.040
and 6B increased by 10%.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.920
This does not mean that students

26:22.920 --> 26:24.200
who were in more inclusive settings

26:24.200 --> 26:27.800
were suddenly placed in more restrictive environments.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.360
I think it's important to note there has been a decrease

26:30.360 --> 26:33.680
of over 40,000 students in the population

26:33.680 --> 26:36.800
for this indicator over the past two years,

26:36.800 --> 26:38.400
and again, due to the removal

26:38.400 --> 26:40.560
of the five-year-old kindergartners.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.840
This decrease has been seen and felt across the board

26:43.840 --> 26:45.240
in all educational environments,

26:45.240 --> 26:47.840
so in fact, there were just less students overall

26:47.840 --> 26:51.160
in the indicator and 6B environments as well.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.960
I still don't wanna minimize,

26:52.960 --> 26:57.960
and I think sort of there is a reason, a rationale,

26:58.200 --> 27:00.040
and a condition that has impacted

27:00.040 --> 27:02.240
sort of the numbers that you're seeing today,

27:02.240 --> 27:06.640
but that does not, I think, account for,

27:06.640 --> 27:10.320
or we're not going to sort of lessen our focus

27:11.120 --> 27:13.520
on this area, we know that preschool LRE

27:13.520 --> 27:16.720
is extremely critical, and that while

27:16.720 --> 27:18.240
sort of the calculations have changed

27:18.240 --> 27:19.520
and the landscapes have changed,

27:19.520 --> 27:22.920
that our approach to supporting high-quality

27:22.920 --> 27:25.160
preschool environments will continue

27:25.160 --> 27:27.760
across all settings as well.

27:32.560 --> 27:35.960
And then some of the pre-K investments

27:35.960 --> 27:38.760
that we will be utilizing,

27:38.760 --> 27:41.920
and you'll hear just a little bit more about later as well,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.560
is to address some of the LRE,

27:45.560 --> 27:49.800
preschool LRE that you saw in the last slide.

27:49.800 --> 27:52.800
Children with an IEP or IFSP,

27:52.800 --> 27:55.800
Individualized Family Service Plan,

27:55.800 --> 27:57.560
will be categorically eligible

27:57.560 --> 28:00.120
for California State Preschool.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.640
Along with Stephen Profiter,

28:02.640 --> 28:05.440
we'll talk more about this later in the presentation.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.560
Again, there was a requirement for the set-aside

28:09.360 --> 28:11.320
to reserve at least 10% of students with IEPs,

28:11.320 --> 28:13.840
similar to Head Start, with a phase-in process.

28:13.840 --> 28:16.480
So this year, there will be,

28:16.480 --> 28:18.360
last year was a 5% set-aside,

28:18.360 --> 28:21.560
this year will be a 7.5% set-aside,

28:21.560 --> 28:25.040
and then in starting July 1st of 2024,

28:25.040 --> 28:28.640
there'll be a 10% funded enrollment reserve

28:28.640 --> 28:31.640
for these children, and contractors must serve

28:31.640 --> 28:33.880
those children in those environments as well.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.600
Even if a child does not qualify for an IEP,

28:38.280 --> 28:40.360
the state preschool program will still be an option

28:40.360 --> 28:41.360
for them as well.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.560
And there are also $2,000,001 funds

28:45.560 --> 28:47.760
to incorporate early identification

28:47.760 --> 28:49.800
for learning disabilities

28:49.800 --> 28:52.320
into the state preschool assessment tools,

28:52.320 --> 28:54.160
including a process followed up

28:54.160 --> 28:56.120
by expert evaluators as well.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.840
Indicator five, which is least restrictive environment.

29:01.840 --> 29:06.200
Again, we're talking about the students who are aged five

29:06.200 --> 29:10.880
through aged 20, or in age six through 22,

29:10.880 --> 29:13.720
served inside regular education classrooms.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.520
In indicator five, A and five C are trendy

29:17.520 --> 29:20.400
in the direction CDE would like to see.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.040
Indicator five B is reflective of just,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.600
I think, year-to-year fluctuations.

29:26.600 --> 29:31.360
I think the effort and the emphasis placed on inclusion

29:31.360 --> 29:34.600
or inclusive practices can be felt across the state

29:34.720 --> 29:36.240
in a number of areas.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.200
I would like to highlight the work that's being done

29:38.200 --> 29:42.320
by our partner supporting inclusive practices, or SIP,

29:42.320 --> 29:45.200
S-I-P as we like to call them.

29:45.200 --> 29:49.760
The SIP project supports LEAs to increase access

29:49.760 --> 29:52.000
to general education settings

29:52.000 --> 29:54.280
with research-based evidence practices,

29:54.280 --> 29:56.680
targeted training, and technical assistance

29:56.680 --> 29:58.240
to supporting students with disabilities

29:58.240 --> 30:00.280
in the least restrictive environment.

30:00.280 --> 30:03.520
Currently, the SIP project has 55 LEAs as grantees

30:03.520 --> 30:05.760
as they work closely together as cohorts.

30:07.200 --> 30:11.360
The outcomes for SIP include shifting attitudes

30:11.360 --> 30:14.480
towards inclusion, equity and access,

30:14.480 --> 30:16.960
implementation of inclusive practices,

30:16.960 --> 30:20.000
and utilizing universal design for learning

30:20.000 --> 30:21.920
as a curricular framework,

30:21.920 --> 30:25.080
as well as using evidence-based teaching practices

30:25.080 --> 30:28.800
in terms of moving our key indicators forward as well.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.080
The SIP approach is to assist LEAs

30:31.080 --> 30:34.200
in building strong leadership support for inclusion

30:34.200 --> 30:37.480
and having leaders articulate an inclusion vision clearly

30:37.480 --> 30:39.880
and urgently through formal articulation

30:39.880 --> 30:42.240
and by priority setting as well.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.000
SIP uses several key data sources

30:45.000 --> 30:47.360
to closely monitor the effectiveness of their project

30:47.360 --> 30:48.800
and the work that they do.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.760
Overall, the 55 grantees and those in long

30:51.760 --> 30:56.080
and newer cohorts have shown positive movement

30:56.080 --> 30:57.560
on this indicator.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.720
And then also, SIP was recently tapped

30:59.720 --> 31:02.920
to pilot a project centered on early education at LRE

31:02.920 --> 31:05.680
and two grantees have been selected to this work.

31:06.480 --> 31:09.160
All this to say, the success of SIP has been noted

31:09.160 --> 31:11.320
by the state budget and continues,

31:11.320 --> 31:14.040
and the state continues to invest in the SIP project

31:14.040 --> 31:17.720
and SIP received over $1 million

31:17.720 --> 31:20.200
in the state budget last year as well.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.840
So certainly, the work in LRE, across LRE,

31:22.840 --> 31:24.760
we know takes time.

31:24.760 --> 31:26.840
We're talking about changing mindsets,

31:26.840 --> 31:28.320
we're talking about changing policies,

31:28.320 --> 31:29.840
we're talking about changing practices.

31:29.840 --> 31:34.840
And so, the work of SIP across these 55 grantee areas,

31:36.200 --> 31:40.280
we will continue to scale and certainly support efforts

31:40.280 --> 31:41.840
of inclusion across the state.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.640
The other indicator that I would like to highlight

31:47.640 --> 31:52.640
is indicator 4A, suspension and expulsion.

31:52.720 --> 31:55.160
In terms of the expansion and expulsion here,

31:58.560 --> 32:01.640
the calculation for that is a little bit different

32:01.640 --> 32:03.080
than the dashboard.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.560
So again, we're looking at students with disabilities

32:05.560 --> 32:09.040
who are suspended for greater than 10 days

32:09.040 --> 32:13.120
in a school year, and again, this is lag data as well.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.880
This is the number that was zero.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.280
And again, next year we know this number will increase

32:18.280 --> 32:20.320
by nature of the fact that we are no longer

32:20.320 --> 32:22.480
in a distance learning situation.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.760
In order to address suspension and expulsion

32:25.760 --> 32:26.960
for students with disabilities,

32:26.960 --> 32:29.120
as we know, this is a critical area,

32:29.120 --> 32:31.880
an area of focus for us across the state.

32:31.880 --> 32:36.080
The California Multi-Tiered System of Support, or MTSS,

32:36.080 --> 32:40.240
is a systemic and continuous improvement framework

32:40.240 --> 32:43.560
designed to provide effective technical assistance

32:43.560 --> 32:46.320
for districts and schools to address every student's

32:46.320 --> 32:48.880
academic, behavioral, social, emotional needs

32:48.880 --> 32:52.120
in an inclusive and equitable learning environment

32:52.120 --> 32:54.440
driven by policy and practice,

32:54.480 --> 32:57.720
strong leadership, and family and community engagement.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.600
The California MTSS helps districts and schools

33:00.600 --> 33:03.320
increase attendance, prevent dropouts,

33:03.320 --> 33:06.040
lower disciplinary rates, and improve school climate,

33:06.040 --> 33:08.480
and boost academic performance.

33:08.480 --> 33:12.320
MTSS, or California MTSS, achieves this through coaching,

33:12.320 --> 33:15.240
community practice, and also the MTSS pathway

33:15.240 --> 33:18.280
certification of schools.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.280
And we know that, I think, sort of robust MTSS systems

33:23.800 --> 33:28.800
is a system that, in theory, and certainly a best practice,

33:29.280 --> 33:32.400
should be implemented in every single school setting as well

33:32.400 --> 33:34.280
as it provides the appropriate level of support

33:34.280 --> 33:37.200
for all students in a school setting.

33:37.200 --> 33:40.360
It provides a pro-social and positive environment

33:40.360 --> 33:42.160
for students to thrive and to learn.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.080
Terms of graduation.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.840
Here, again, this indicator is different

33:51.920 --> 33:54.680
than what is reported on the dashboard.

33:54.680 --> 33:57.800
Indicator one is a one-year calculation,

33:57.800 --> 33:59.360
meaning it looks at the percentage of students

33:59.360 --> 34:02.560
who exited special education due to graduation

34:02.560 --> 34:04.160
with a regular high school diploma

34:04.160 --> 34:07.680
out of all students with IEPs that exited special education.

34:10.360 --> 34:14.760
Here, again, we've seen that we are meeting

34:14.760 --> 34:19.080
that indicator as well, and certainly we'll look forward

34:19.080 --> 34:22.080
to increasing this metric as well,

34:22.080 --> 34:24.360
so that all of our students with disabilities

34:24.360 --> 34:26.960
are exiting with a regular high school diploma.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.840
I think, to that end, there have been

34:28.840 --> 34:31.960
several budget investments over the past couple of years

34:31.960 --> 34:34.040
that have sort of spoken to the fact

34:34.040 --> 34:37.000
or acknowledged the fact that there is a need

34:37.000 --> 34:39.200
for certain students with disabilities

34:39.200 --> 34:42.640
to have alternate pathways to get to the diploma,

34:42.640 --> 34:45.080
recognizing that, again, the student body

34:45.080 --> 34:47.680
that we're serving is extremely diverse,

34:48.280 --> 34:50.880
both in sort of demographic but also in need

34:50.880 --> 34:52.720
and recognizing that there are multiple pathways

34:52.720 --> 34:54.320
to get to the same end goal.

34:54.320 --> 34:59.320
And so with that, the alternate pathways to diploma

34:59.800 --> 35:02.160
and some of the work that's being done around that

35:02.160 --> 35:04.480
in the sort of previous and current budget acts

35:04.480 --> 35:09.480
gets to students that have more significant needs

35:12.360 --> 35:17.200
and students that still qualify

35:17.240 --> 35:21.280
for the alternative assessment have a clear pathway

35:21.280 --> 35:23.680
towards achieving a regular high school diploma.

35:28.760 --> 35:32.000
In Decatur XIV, post-secondary outcomes,

35:32.000 --> 35:36.520
again, here, we know that for students with disabilities,

35:36.520 --> 35:39.120
life after high school can look very,

35:40.160 --> 35:42.080
sometimes it's also a very sort of

35:42.080 --> 35:44.880
scary transition process as well,

35:44.880 --> 35:48.120
ensuring that we have students that are

35:48.120 --> 35:49.640
not only graduating with a diploma

35:49.640 --> 35:53.280
but also have a chance to meaningful engage

35:53.280 --> 35:56.600
in college and career or in workforce

35:56.600 --> 35:59.360
is something that certainly is a focus here for the state.

35:59.360 --> 36:01.880
It's also important to note as well

36:01.880 --> 36:05.960
that the Office of Special Education Programs, or OSEP,

36:05.960 --> 36:10.960
has also made this a focus area for the country,

36:11.520 --> 36:13.800
essentially as well, in terms of ensuring

36:13.800 --> 36:17.320
that we have meaningful post-secondary outcomes

36:17.320 --> 36:18.600
and improving our performance

36:18.600 --> 36:21.040
across these indicators as well.

36:25.360 --> 36:30.200
And here, we saw decreases in this number last year,

36:30.200 --> 36:32.000
but we are seeing numbers start to rebound

36:32.000 --> 36:34.280
as we're coming out of the pandemic.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.000
We look forward to seeing these numbers

36:36.000 --> 36:39.920
continue to track positively in years to come as well.

36:40.480 --> 36:43.480
In terms of our state systemic improvement plan,

36:43.480 --> 36:44.680
which is Indicator 17,

36:44.680 --> 36:47.240
which is technically the last indicator,

36:47.240 --> 36:52.240
the ESSEP, as we deem or like to call it,

36:53.280 --> 36:56.280
addresses plans for improving outcomes

36:56.280 --> 36:58.360
for students with disabilities.

36:58.360 --> 37:02.160
The California State Identified Measurable Result,

37:02.160 --> 37:04.200
or we call it the CIMR, all these acronyms,

37:04.200 --> 37:07.840
I know, I'm sorry, is the performance of all of these

37:07.880 --> 37:12.920
with disabilities who took the CASP,

37:12.920 --> 37:15.320
both in ELA and in math.

37:15.320 --> 37:19.600
And then our ESSEP is focused on creating systemic

37:19.600 --> 37:21.080
and sustainable changes,

37:21.080 --> 37:23.000
including the necessary alignment

37:23.000 --> 37:25.760
in statewide accountability and improvement structures,

37:25.760 --> 37:28.000
like the statewide system of support,

37:28.000 --> 37:31.760
to improve outcomes for students with disabilities as well.

37:31.760 --> 37:36.760
So California has made significant progress

37:39.720 --> 37:41.520
in building a statewide system of support

37:41.520 --> 37:43.760
that effectively assist LEAs to design

37:43.760 --> 37:46.120
and implement effective improvement strategies

37:46.120 --> 37:47.720
for students with disabilities.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.160
We know that a comprehensive system of technical assistance

37:53.160 --> 37:56.000
that's available through the statewide system

37:56.000 --> 37:57.720
includes evidence-based practices

37:57.720 --> 38:00.720
to effectively serve students with disabilities.

38:00.720 --> 38:04.480
The statewide system of support seeks to support LEAs'

38:04.480 --> 38:08.120
efforts to implement the improvement strategies

38:08.120 --> 38:09.760
outlined in their LCAPs

38:09.760 --> 38:12.040
and to monitor intended improvement.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.560
California is now in year six

38:14.560 --> 38:17.440
of creating a coordinated and coherent state structure

38:17.440 --> 38:21.520
to ensure LEAs receive the assistance necessary

38:21.520 --> 38:23.800
to address disparities in student outcomes.

38:23.800 --> 38:25.840
California's ESSEP is focused on creating

38:25.840 --> 38:28.400
systemic and sustainable changes,

38:28.400 --> 38:31.200
including necessary alignment in statewide accountability

38:31.200 --> 38:32.400
and improvement structures,

38:32.400 --> 38:35.240
like the statewide system of support, to improve outcomes.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.800
I just wanna go back just really quickly

38:43.800 --> 38:46.240
and talk about one of the areas

38:46.240 --> 38:50.600
that I think will be a key lever in this improvement process

38:50.600 --> 38:54.360
is the IDA Local Control Accountability Plan Addendum.

38:54.360 --> 38:57.200
The 2022 Budget Act included the development

38:57.200 --> 38:59.240
of the IDA Addendum,

38:59.240 --> 39:03.040
which stipulates by July 1st of 2025,

39:03.040 --> 39:07.280
LEAs that have been identified for CDE for improvement

39:07.280 --> 39:11.280
will develop an addendum in conjunction with the LCAP.

39:11.280 --> 39:13.840
This addendum will support inclusive planning.

39:13.840 --> 39:17.040
It's designed to be an inclusive planning process

39:17.040 --> 39:19.840
and will promote cohesion by linking special education

39:19.840 --> 39:21.240
and general education planning,

39:21.240 --> 39:23.280
again, getting to the one system

39:23.280 --> 39:24.800
and closer to the one system

39:24.800 --> 39:27.000
that we all are working towards.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.720
And again, the budget requires the inclusion of parents

39:29.720 --> 39:31.600
of students with disabilities

39:31.600 --> 39:34.680
on district and county LCAP parent advisories committees

39:34.680 --> 39:38.640
as well, ensuring equity of voice for all students.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.360
In terms of sort of what's next for the state

39:43.360 --> 39:45.920
in the system of support here,

39:45.920 --> 39:49.920
we know that sort of everything that we do

39:49.920 --> 39:53.160
is designed to funnel down into the local,

39:53.160 --> 39:54.600
the classroom level as well.

39:55.400 --> 39:59.960
The layering of supports and initiatives and services

39:59.960 --> 40:01.920
is really our goal here,

40:01.920 --> 40:05.640
working both sort of vertically and horizontally,

40:05.640 --> 40:08.200
if you will, with each of the partners

40:08.200 --> 40:11.040
of our educational partners at each level

40:11.040 --> 40:13.640
to really effectively change and work

40:13.640 --> 40:16.840
to improve our outcomes with students with disabilities.

40:17.760 --> 40:22.760
I did want to note, we are also at an exciting time as well.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.720
Our new grant year cycle starts this year,

40:26.720 --> 40:29.360
July 1st of 2023, with our new,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.560
with a new statewide system of support

40:31.560 --> 40:33.920
and special education resource leads.

40:33.920 --> 40:37.120
This grant year cycle will run through 2028.

40:37.120 --> 40:41.120
This time around, the budget has allocated

40:41.120 --> 40:44.920
$12 million annually for this new grant cycle.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.880
The CDE and SBE work diligently to put together

40:47.880 --> 40:50.720
a comprehensive and targeted RFA

40:50.720 --> 40:53.440
to address the areas of highest need at the state

40:53.440 --> 40:55.200
at this current point in time.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.560
And the budget language currently states that

40:58.560 --> 41:01.760
there'll be no more than 10 resource leads.

41:01.760 --> 41:05.200
Three will be, at least three of those leads

41:05.200 --> 41:08.400
will be designated to build local and regional capacity

41:08.400 --> 41:10.080
to support LEAs.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.080
At least one of those leads has to,

41:12.080 --> 41:14.280
support the development and implementation

41:14.280 --> 41:16.440
of high quality IEPs.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.920
One resource lead to develop the capacity

41:18.920 --> 41:20.800
at the LEA level on universal design

41:20.800 --> 41:22.760
for learning framework.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.120
One resource lead to focus on English learners

41:25.120 --> 41:26.680
and how to best support.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.680
And then one resource lead in partnership

41:28.680 --> 41:31.000
with a family support organization

41:31.000 --> 41:33.880
will focus on alternative dispute resolution.

41:33.880 --> 41:38.880
So an exciting time ahead in terms of sort of a new

41:39.240 --> 41:41.600
sort of an additional iteration of this work

41:41.600 --> 41:43.640
and a continuation of this work in general

41:43.640 --> 41:46.280
in terms of how we're supporting and improving outcomes.

41:46.280 --> 41:48.920
We're optimistic about the number,

41:48.920 --> 41:51.400
the quality of applications that we will receive

41:51.400 --> 41:54.080
and along with the work that will continue across the state

41:54.080 --> 41:57.560
and integrate into the statewide system of support.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.440
And now I just wanted to take a brief moment in time

42:06.480 --> 42:11.480
to pause and now transition over to a couple of the,

42:12.680 --> 42:14.400
highlight a couple of the CDE partnerships

42:14.400 --> 42:19.400
that we have strengthened within our own department

42:19.640 --> 42:23.520
and recognizing that the overlaps in the intersections

42:23.520 --> 42:26.920
of students with disabilities, of multilingual students

42:26.920 --> 42:30.680
and our early learners, we can no longer ignore.

42:30.680 --> 42:32.120
We know that there are,

42:32.360 --> 42:34.680
we can no longer ignore, right?

42:34.680 --> 42:39.680
We know that there are areas in which commonly we hold

42:40.480 --> 42:45.480
for our students and so right now we are certainly,

42:47.560 --> 42:50.240
working together collaboratively as a group

42:50.240 --> 42:53.360
in order to shine the spotlight,

42:53.360 --> 42:56.120
elevate the conversation of how we're working together

42:56.120 --> 43:01.120
to address some of the challenges that we face.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.040
As well.

43:06.520 --> 43:10.200
All right, now I'm gonna pass it over to Alicia Moreno-Ramirez

43:10.200 --> 43:12.920
who's the director of the multilingual support division

43:12.920 --> 43:15.000
who will run through just a couple of slides

43:15.000 --> 43:17.440
and highlight the work that both of our divisions are doing

43:17.440 --> 43:20.320
to support duly identified students as well.

43:22.520 --> 43:23.720
Good morning, thank you Heather

43:23.720 --> 43:25.160
and good morning President Darling-Hammond

43:25.160 --> 43:26.600
and members of the board.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.680
My name is Alicia Moreno-Ramirez

43:28.680 --> 43:30.600
and I am the director of the CDE's

43:30.600 --> 43:33.760
multilingual support division.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.040
Today I'll share briefly on some of the key collaboration

43:36.040 --> 43:37.720
across the opportunities for all branch,

43:37.720 --> 43:39.800
particularly highlighting how the multilingual

43:39.800 --> 43:41.280
support division is partnered

43:41.280 --> 43:42.880
with the special education division

43:42.880 --> 43:44.280
and the early education division

43:44.280 --> 43:47.280
to benefit California's diverse children and youth

43:47.280 --> 43:49.040
as well as how we produce together

43:49.040 --> 43:51.240
some of the guidance and resources

43:51.240 --> 43:52.880
also born of that collaboration.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.600
The California Department of Education

43:55.600 --> 43:57.600
multilingual support division or MSD,

43:57.640 --> 43:59.480
the special education or SED

43:59.480 --> 44:02.400
and the early education division or EED

44:02.400 --> 44:04.520
have a history, a long history of collaboration

44:04.520 --> 44:07.600
that's resulted in the development of important policy

44:07.600 --> 44:10.720
and guidance that continues to shape education in our state.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.400
First, the California English Learner Roadmap Policy

44:14.400 --> 44:16.800
or EL Roadmap Policy was developed

44:16.800 --> 44:19.680
through the collaborative process coordinated by the MSD

44:19.680 --> 44:22.640
that included teachers, administrators,

44:22.640 --> 44:25.480
county office of education representatives,

44:25.480 --> 44:27.560
educational nonprofit representatives

44:28.560 --> 44:30.280
and representatives from multiple divisions in the CDE,

44:30.280 --> 44:32.200
including SED and EED.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.360
The English Learner Roadmap Policy was approved

44:35.360 --> 44:39.960
by California State Board of Education in July 12th, 2017.

44:39.960 --> 44:42.320
And as a result of the collaboration with EED,

44:42.320 --> 44:45.200
the EL Roadmap Policy calls out explicit connections

44:45.200 --> 44:47.600
to dual language learners in preschool

44:47.600 --> 44:49.880
and the importance of alignment and articulation

44:49.880 --> 44:51.840
within and across systems.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.440
And due to SED's involvement,

44:53.440 --> 44:55.520
the EL Roadmap also calls attention

44:55.520 --> 44:57.080
to the importance of addressing the needs

44:57.600 --> 45:00.160
of dually identified students across the system.

45:01.720 --> 45:03.080
In addition to providing input

45:03.080 --> 45:04.760
on the policy and guidance document,

45:04.760 --> 45:07.400
the SED also collaborated with the MSD

45:07.400 --> 45:09.240
to develop a three-way crosswalk

45:09.240 --> 45:11.680
between the EL Roadmap principles,

45:11.680 --> 45:15.040
the special education annual performance report indicators

45:15.040 --> 45:18.560
and the local control funding formula priority areas.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.400
This tool allows education leaders

45:20.400 --> 45:22.720
to see the connections between these three areas

45:22.720 --> 45:24.640
as they use this resource for planning,

45:24.640 --> 45:26.640
again, in the best interest of students.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.400
The California Practitioner's Guide

45:29.400 --> 45:32.920
for Educating English Learners with Disabilities

45:32.920 --> 45:36.480
was also developed collaboratively between the SED,

45:36.480 --> 45:40.520
the MSD and through contract with WestEd.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.960
The Practitioner's Guide was developed

45:41.960 --> 45:43.040
to make valuable information

45:43.040 --> 45:44.880
on serving English learners with disabilities

45:44.880 --> 45:49.000
or dually identified students in TK through grade 12,

45:49.000 --> 45:52.600
readily available to busy educators.

45:52.600 --> 45:54.680
These documents continue to guide CDE's work

45:54.680 --> 45:55.880
in supporting English learners

45:55.880 --> 45:57.200
and dually identified students

45:57.200 --> 45:59.000
in preschool through grade 12.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.320
We can pop to the next slide, please.

46:04.760 --> 46:06.720
As part of our ongoing collaboration,

46:06.720 --> 46:10.720
the MSD, SED and EED have continued to engage

46:10.720 --> 46:12.360
to ensure consistent approaches

46:12.360 --> 46:15.000
aligned with the guidance in the EL Roadmap policy

46:15.000 --> 46:16.080
and the Practitioner's Guide

46:16.080 --> 46:18.760
for Educating English Learners with Disabilities.

46:18.760 --> 46:19.920
The goal of this collaboration

46:19.920 --> 46:22.720
is to support local education agencies

46:22.720 --> 46:24.560
to better support and embrace the children

46:24.560 --> 46:26.160
and communities that they serve

46:26.160 --> 46:28.240
and to build upon the assets that these children

46:28.240 --> 46:30.320
and youth bring to California schools.

46:31.400 --> 46:33.800
The MSD and SED collaborate monthly

46:33.800 --> 46:35.920
with the Imperial County Special Education

46:35.920 --> 46:38.400
Local Plan Area or ICSELPA.

46:39.560 --> 46:42.360
At the CDE, ICSELPA collaboration meetings,

46:42.360 --> 46:45.160
the SED, MSD and ICSELPA engage

46:45.160 --> 46:48.080
in collaborative conversations regarding timely topics

46:48.080 --> 46:50.280
such as reclassification,

46:50.280 --> 46:53.200
the alternate English language proficiency assessments

46:53.240 --> 46:55.920
for California or ALT LPAC,

46:55.920 --> 46:57.760
identification of dual language learners

46:57.760 --> 46:59.360
with disabilities in preschool,

47:00.240 --> 47:01.600
English learners with disabilities

47:01.600 --> 47:04.240
placed in dual immersion programs

47:04.240 --> 47:07.640
and other topics related to dually identified students.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.280
Further, the ICSELPA has developed

47:10.280 --> 47:12.840
and presented training modules on the Practitioner's Guide,

47:12.840 --> 47:15.600
co-presented with the MSD and SED directors

47:15.600 --> 47:18.240
on educating dually identified students,

47:18.240 --> 47:21.280
promotes resources to support EL Roadmap implementation

47:21.280 --> 47:23.240
and has provided training for CDE staff

47:23.240 --> 47:25.720
on English learners with disabilities.

47:25.720 --> 47:27.400
The ICSELPA also collaborates

47:27.400 --> 47:30.280
with the 2019 Educator Workforce Investment Grant

47:30.280 --> 47:33.680
or EWIG EL Roadmap Implementation Grantee

47:33.680 --> 47:37.240
called ELRISE or English Learner Roadmap Implementation

47:37.240 --> 47:38.880
for Systemic Excellence

47:38.880 --> 47:40.800
to provide customized professional learning

47:40.800 --> 47:43.200
focused on dually identified students

47:43.200 --> 47:46.160
to ELRISE Anchor County Offices of Education

47:46.160 --> 47:47.720
and participating districts

47:47.720 --> 47:50.200
based upon the needs of local educational agencies.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.640
ICSELPA further provides supports for these counties

47:53.640 --> 47:55.640
to connect with their local SELPAs.

47:57.200 --> 48:00.080
The MSD, SED and the Assessment Administration

48:00.080 --> 48:02.480
and Development Division also meet quarterly

48:02.480 --> 48:05.240
to collaborate on responding to inquiries from the field

48:05.240 --> 48:07.360
that overlap with the work of multiple divisions

48:07.360 --> 48:10.200
such as reclassifying students with disabilities

48:10.200 --> 48:11.920
using the LPAC or the ALT LPAC.

48:13.360 --> 48:16.920
The MSD, SED and EED also continue to collaborate

48:16.920 --> 48:19.280
to create communication pipelines,

48:19.280 --> 48:20.480
co-develop presentations

48:20.480 --> 48:22.760
that reflect the intersectionality of students

48:22.760 --> 48:26.200
and co-present when opportunities like this arise.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.480
For example, the MSD recently developed content

48:28.480 --> 48:29.320
and talking points

48:29.320 --> 48:31.440
for universal pre-kindergarten presentations

48:31.440 --> 48:33.920
and the SED and MSD directors will co-present

48:33.920 --> 48:35.960
at the upcoming California Association

48:35.960 --> 48:37.760
for Bilingual Education Conference.

48:39.600 --> 48:41.600
Region 15 Comprehensive Center

48:41.600 --> 48:44.120
supported the MSD, SED and EED

48:44.120 --> 48:45.880
in cross division collaboration

48:45.880 --> 48:48.000
through a series of facilitating meetings

48:48.000 --> 48:50.400
where we can best see the interconnections

48:51.280 --> 48:52.120
of our work.

48:52.120 --> 48:53.320
These meetings help build the foundation

48:53.320 --> 48:55.120
for ongoing collaboration

48:55.120 --> 48:57.360
between and across the three divisions.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.800
The MSD, SED and EED continue

49:00.800 --> 49:02.280
to build a collaborative relationship

49:02.280 --> 49:04.160
to better support students and the educators

49:04.160 --> 49:08.560
who serve them in assets based and needs responsive ways.

49:08.560 --> 49:10.080
I'll now hand off to,

49:10.080 --> 49:12.160
I believe the Director of Early Education Division,

49:12.160 --> 49:14.920
Stephen Proffiter, is it coming to you, Stephen?

49:14.920 --> 49:15.840
Coming to Stephen.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.240
Thank you, Alicia, we know you're busy.

49:17.240 --> 49:18.440
Thank you, appreciate it.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.360
Wonderful, thank you Heather and Alicia

49:21.360 --> 49:22.640
and good morning.

49:22.640 --> 49:23.800
So to build off a little bit

49:23.800 --> 49:26.680
of what Alicia and Heather have shared,

49:26.680 --> 49:28.760
our divisions have worked closely together

49:28.760 --> 49:30.280
on a number of state initiatives

49:30.280 --> 49:33.280
and efforts to increase access, participation

49:33.280 --> 49:35.760
and supports for children with disabilities

49:35.760 --> 49:38.680
in inclusive early education programs.

49:38.680 --> 49:40.400
A cornerstone of this partnership

49:40.400 --> 49:43.240
is collaboration to support inclusion in UPK

49:43.240 --> 49:44.920
or as we've said earlier,

49:44.920 --> 49:48.360
universal pre-kindergarten planning and implementation.

49:49.240 --> 49:51.920
We've had strong coordination to develop unified

49:51.920 --> 49:53.640
and clear messaging for the field

49:53.640 --> 49:56.120
in our published guidance and our webinars

49:56.120 --> 49:58.240
as well as on addressing any concerns

49:58.240 --> 50:00.360
that come up from the field.

50:00.360 --> 50:02.200
Another area that I wanna highlight

50:02.200 --> 50:04.720
is the huge advancement in inclusion

50:04.720 --> 50:06.880
in the California State Preschool Program

50:06.880 --> 50:09.800
or CSPP as you'll hear me reference later

50:09.800 --> 50:12.040
where we've been working hand in hand

50:12.040 --> 50:15.600
with across divisions to develop guidance for contractors

50:15.600 --> 50:18.320
on how to implement changes related to enrolling

50:19.280 --> 50:22.040
and serving children with disabilities in the CSPP.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.120
The changes will have a huge impact

50:24.120 --> 50:26.480
on access for children with disabilities,

50:26.480 --> 50:28.360
creating more inclusive classrooms

50:28.360 --> 50:30.800
and ensuring that children with disabilities

50:30.800 --> 50:33.600
are educated in the least restrictive environment.

50:33.600 --> 50:35.600
Some of these key changes include

50:35.600 --> 50:39.280
children with disabilities now have categorical eligibility

50:39.280 --> 50:41.040
for the state preschool in addition

50:41.040 --> 50:43.600
to higher priority for enrollment

50:43.600 --> 50:48.280
and by 2425, as you heard Heather mentioned earlier,

50:49.240 --> 50:51.360
our state preschools are required to set aside 10%

50:51.360 --> 50:53.840
of funded enrollment for children with disabilities

50:53.840 --> 50:56.440
and to ensure that children are educated

50:56.440 --> 50:58.320
in the least restrictive environment.

51:04.760 --> 51:08.160
I also want to highlight some key programs

51:08.160 --> 51:10.260
and spaces for collaboration.

51:11.240 --> 51:14.840
Assembly Bill 1808 of 2018 established

51:14.840 --> 51:18.360
the Inclusive Early Education Expansion Program

51:18.360 --> 51:21.240
which you'll hear me refer to later as EAP

51:21.240 --> 51:24.280
administered by the CDE to support early educators

51:24.280 --> 51:28.520
in increasing access to early education programs

51:28.520 --> 51:31.000
like the California State Preschool Program.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.640
Funds support three main areas

51:32.640 --> 51:35.720
including facilities improvements, adaptive equipment

51:35.720 --> 51:37.720
and professional development.

51:37.720 --> 51:40.080
The current year budget also included resources

51:40.080 --> 51:42.040
for state level systems building.

51:42.080 --> 51:45.080
You can refer to page 35 of yesterday's TK item

51:45.080 --> 51:47.760
for more details on this.

51:47.760 --> 51:49.480
Our divisions have worked closely

51:49.480 --> 51:51.520
during the development of the existing grant

51:51.520 --> 51:54.480
and are currently collaborating to expand the program

51:54.480 --> 51:58.720
through an upcoming request for applications process.

51:58.720 --> 52:00.960
Also under AB 1808,

52:00.960 --> 52:02.680
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction

52:02.680 --> 52:06.680
established a cross sector agency work group in April 2019

52:06.680 --> 52:09.960
for the purpose of sharing challenges, barriers

52:10.000 --> 52:13.080
and best practices for inclusion of children with disabilities

52:13.080 --> 52:15.760
and to work towards continuous improvement

52:15.760 --> 52:17.200
of inclusion of these children

52:17.200 --> 52:19.480
in high quality early learning and care programs

52:19.480 --> 52:21.200
in California.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.440
The work group consists of multiple state agencies

52:23.440 --> 52:26.760
and other early childhood constituents.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.920
With technical assistance

52:27.920 --> 52:30.420
from the Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center,

52:30.420 --> 52:32.200
the work group completed a statewide

52:32.200 --> 52:35.600
high quality inclusion indicators assessment

52:35.600 --> 52:38.680
to determine areas of improvement for inclusion

52:38.680 --> 52:41.360
as well as develop a strategic plan.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.960
Currently, the work group is coalescing resources

52:43.960 --> 52:45.800
to support the field and implementing

52:45.800 --> 52:48.840
high quality early learning and care programs.

52:48.840 --> 52:51.200
The three main activities include

52:51.200 --> 52:53.720
creating and disseminating a communications plan

52:53.720 --> 52:55.960
on inclusion, including the development

52:55.960 --> 52:57.880
of a reference guide for inclusion

52:57.880 --> 53:00.520
and resources to address barriers,

53:00.520 --> 53:04.360
reviewing and disseminating existing special education

53:04.360 --> 53:08.120
and inclusion related guidance, regulations and policies

53:08.160 --> 53:09.520
including the development

53:09.520 --> 53:12.760
of a frequently asked questions resource

53:12.760 --> 53:15.320
as well as coalescing best practices, standards

53:15.320 --> 53:17.000
and policy resources,

53:17.000 --> 53:20.320
including a matrix of technical assistance resources

53:20.320 --> 53:23.480
and a review of inclusion assessment tools

53:23.480 --> 53:26.240
in collaboration with Quality Counts California.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.520
To increase collaborative efforts across divisions

53:30.520 --> 53:33.440
within the CDE and to leverage our shared goal

53:33.440 --> 53:35.320
of supporting our youngest learners

53:35.320 --> 53:37.920
with disabilities within inclusive settings,

53:38.720 --> 53:40.920
the CDE established a cross division coordination

53:40.920 --> 53:43.800
on inclusion team in November of 2021.

53:43.800 --> 53:46.280
Currently staff from the early education division,

53:46.280 --> 53:47.680
the special education division

53:47.680 --> 53:50.920
and multilingual support divisions participate on this team

53:50.920 --> 53:52.680
with the intention of adding divisions,

53:52.680 --> 53:56.240
additional divisions as collaborative partners within CDE.

53:56.240 --> 53:58.800
The team is currently revisiting and updating goals

53:58.800 --> 54:00.240
established during the previous year,

54:00.240 --> 54:03.680
which include determining areas of need for the field

54:03.680 --> 54:07.080
and identify resources to support inclusive practices,

54:07.120 --> 54:08.640
determine internal and external

54:08.640 --> 54:10.600
technical assistance needs around inclusion,

54:10.600 --> 54:13.600
including training on the Lanterman Act,

54:13.600 --> 54:17.720
special education legal foundation's best practices

54:17.720 --> 54:19.960
for inclusion, desired results,

54:19.960 --> 54:22.680
access adaptations and accommodation,

54:22.680 --> 54:24.480
universal design for learning

54:24.480 --> 54:28.040
and a program overview from an EAP grantee.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.920
Another goal in this team is to coordinate efforts

54:30.920 --> 54:33.680
between divisions, including determination of ways

54:33.680 --> 54:36.920
that monitoring teams align and how they can collaborate

54:37.760 --> 54:40.160
to best support services to children with disabilities.

54:42.040 --> 54:46.000
While the special education division has been the lead

54:46.000 --> 54:48.520
on collaboration with the department of developmental

54:48.520 --> 54:50.320
services early start program,

54:50.320 --> 54:53.000
it has been clear that the intersection of initiatives

54:53.000 --> 54:56.080
and issues has brought an opportunity for our departments

54:56.080 --> 54:57.880
to deepen their partnership.

54:57.880 --> 55:00.320
The CDE has made efforts to increase support

55:00.320 --> 55:03.440
for children transitioning from part C or early start

55:03.440 --> 55:05.600
to part B special education services,

55:05.600 --> 55:08.240
in addition to children who may become ineligible

55:08.240 --> 55:09.320
for part B services,

55:09.320 --> 55:12.440
but still require early education services.

55:12.440 --> 55:14.920
I'm gonna hand over to Heather to share some background

55:14.920 --> 55:16.320
on the part C to B transition

55:16.320 --> 55:18.280
and the importance of our partnership.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.020
Sorry, now you're in.

55:33.520 --> 55:34.360
All right.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.680
In terms of our partnership with the DDS,

55:39.680 --> 55:43.840
as we like to call them, again, we know that,

55:43.840 --> 55:45.440
and I spoke to a little bit earlier,

55:45.440 --> 55:50.440
the transition to part C to B is one that is a critical time

55:50.680 --> 55:51.680
in a young learner's life.

55:51.680 --> 55:55.360
And so those seamless and coordinated transitions,

55:55.360 --> 55:59.560
again, provide that solid and strong foundation.

55:59.560 --> 56:03.280
And again, as I mentioned previously before,

56:03.280 --> 56:08.280
they're $150,000 plus resources to establish

56:09.520 --> 56:13.160
a early childhood transition or early education unit

56:13.160 --> 56:18.160
within the special education division is being brought to life.

56:19.200 --> 56:21.440
And we should have that unit up and running,

56:21.440 --> 56:24.600
hopefully by mid-February or so as well,

56:24.600 --> 56:26.480
to continue the partnership,

56:26.480 --> 56:28.280
both not only with Steve's division,

56:28.280 --> 56:31.040
but also with the Department of Developmental Services

56:31.040 --> 56:32.400
as well.

56:32.400 --> 56:35.240
Again, the work that we're doing

56:35.240 --> 56:39.560
with both the Department of Developmental Services,

56:39.560 --> 56:44.560
again, working with DDS on specifically developing

56:44.600 --> 56:47.160
both shared resources and parent-friendly resources

56:47.160 --> 56:50.760
that are available on the services that are available

56:50.760 --> 56:52.120
after a child turns three,

56:52.120 --> 56:54.320
and an overview of the transition processes

56:54.320 --> 56:58.080
and timelines as well is a focus area for us.

56:58.080 --> 57:02.600
And then this past summer, both the CDE and the DDS

57:02.600 --> 57:06.640
spent an entire day doing some strategic planning,

57:06.640 --> 57:09.960
which will be the first of many series of meetings

57:09.960 --> 57:13.720
to ensure that both of our agencies are ensuring

57:13.720 --> 57:16.280
that we are both working together

57:16.280 --> 57:18.240
towards a common goal as well,

57:18.240 --> 57:22.280
as well as participation on the Interagency Coordinating Council

57:22.280 --> 57:23.840
for Early Intervention

57:23.840 --> 57:26.280
and our joint partnership with that as well.

57:26.280 --> 57:28.240
And then also hosting and holding

57:28.240 --> 57:31.920
a regional center transition liaison meetings as well.

57:31.920 --> 57:35.720
So again, the importance of partnering with DDS

57:35.720 --> 57:37.160
on sort of the early ed side,

57:37.160 --> 57:39.440
and I would be remiss if I didn't mention

57:39.440 --> 57:43.200
the Department of Rehab on the sort of post-secondary side.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.760
Again, education sort of sits in the middle

57:45.760 --> 57:48.360
of this equation, and it's extremely important

57:48.360 --> 57:52.680
that all of our agencies work in a coordinated manner

57:52.680 --> 57:57.360
to support a student's birth through age 22 as well.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.920
And again, so we are again, working with DDS

58:00.920 --> 58:04.320
collaboratively to again, develop those resources

58:04.320 --> 58:06.040
and work towards our strategic planning,

58:06.040 --> 58:10.000
but a shared goal that our agencies share

58:10.000 --> 58:14.800
is that our early learners have the strongest start possible

58:14.800 --> 58:18.000
in their educational time.

58:19.120 --> 58:23.760
I think with that, we've sort of concluded,

58:23.760 --> 58:26.680
we've had quite a bit of discussion,

58:26.680 --> 58:29.560
I think in terms of just sort of the overview

58:29.560 --> 58:33.320
of the work ahead in terms of sort of currently

58:33.320 --> 58:36.280
where we sit in our annual performance report,

58:36.280 --> 58:39.880
and then the work that we're doing to continue on.

58:39.880 --> 58:42.240
We know that again, while this is federally mandated,

58:42.240 --> 58:45.880
this is the work that we do, and to embed and integrate

58:45.880 --> 58:49.320
and align across all areas and content areas

58:49.320 --> 58:52.760
in multiple contexts, we'll continue to strengthen

58:52.760 --> 58:56.480
our charge and our mission to ensure that all students

58:56.480 --> 58:59.720
are thriving in joyful learning environments as well.

58:59.720 --> 59:04.000
So again, the next step, this concludes this portion

59:04.000 --> 59:07.320
of the sort of presentation, and next steps again

59:07.320 --> 59:10.160
would be pending approval of this item.

59:11.400 --> 59:14.520
The CDE in our division will go ahead and submit

59:14.520 --> 59:16.360
to the Office of Special Education Programs

59:16.360 --> 59:20.640
on February 1st, and typically as typical in years past,

59:20.640 --> 59:24.840
OSAP typically approves those programs or plans

59:24.840 --> 59:28.360
around April of 2023 as well.

59:28.360 --> 59:32.320
So again, we're recommending approval

59:32.320 --> 59:37.320
for the FY 2021 APR and SUP2 submission to OSAP.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.920
Thank you so much for your time, a pleasure to be here,

59:39.920 --> 59:42.360
and happy to answer any questions.

59:43.800 --> 59:45.240
Thank you so much, Heather.

59:45.240 --> 59:48.160
We really appreciate it, and appreciate knowing

59:48.160 --> 59:52.840
what the CDE is doing to advance the goals

59:52.840 --> 59:55.720
as well as what the targets themselves are.

59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.720
We are going to do some amendments to our next steps.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.640
It turns out that there were some sound issues

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.720
on the webcast when we took up items 11

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.040
and the waiver consent items.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.240
Although we understand that the closed captioning

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:16.200
was working out of concern for public engagement,

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.280
we are going to reopen these items

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:20.560
after we conclude this item.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.560
At this moment, I'm gonna ask for liaison comments

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.680
about this item and any quick clarifications.

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.200
We'll then take a break before we come back

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.280
for full discussion, because it's been a couple of hours

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.280
since we started this morning.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.040
So a little bit of adjustments in the flow of the meeting.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:47.360
And I wanna just give member Yoshimoto-Taryi

01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:52.000
an opportunity as our liaison to respond to the item.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.120
If they're clarifying items, we'll take those,

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.160
but we'll come back for public comment

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.440
and discussion after break.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.200
Member Yoshimoto-Taryi.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.240
Thank you, Board President.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.720
So I'd like to also share my appreciation

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.520
not only for today's presentation,

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.360
but also for the collaboration

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.760
of multiple entities and practitioners throughout the year.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.760
As Director Kalamisi mentioned,

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.920
this is a required item for us to review each year,

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.920
but it's also about the meaningful continuous improvement

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.680
as a state that we want to make

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.560
for our students with disabilities.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.400
For a little bit of context, the data in this report,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.640
when it's paired with the data in the school dashboard,

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:37.440
we get a more complete story

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.640
on how our students with disabilities are doing,

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.280
including the data points that tell us

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.720
how preschool students are doing with disabilities,

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.040
as well as some insights on how students with disabilities

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:48.720
are doing after high school,

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.680
which I think are important to mention.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.960
And it's also important to call out

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.800
that the indicator targets in this report

01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:00.040
really represent the floor of our expectations as a state,

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:02.920
and we know that there are LEAs and individual schools

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.720
within our LEAs that are exceeding

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.680
the targets presented here.

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.720
And I think it'd be ideal to have practitioners share

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.600
in front of the Board at some point

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.600
with other practitioners across the state.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.680
So as a final note,

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.840
as C.D. highlighted at the top of the presentation,

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.480
students with disabilities are students

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.200
with intersectional identities.

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.400
So we see our students showing up in every student group.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.120
And the meaning of that to me is really

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.680
that the success of our students with disabilities

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.000
falls on all of our shoulders as a responsibility

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.320
and requires the collaboration of multiple divisions

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.720
in our systems as we saw today.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.480
So that being said, I look forward to the discussion

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.080
on how these data, both in the report

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.960
and in the dashboard together,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.480
continue our improvement practices.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.880
Thank you, Board President.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.160
Terrific, thank you.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.320
And I love the idea of us hearing from some practitioners

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.320
who've been making progress on some of these things

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.280
about how they're doing it.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:04.280
So we'll keep that in mind for a soon future date.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:08.800
Are there clarifying questions for Heather

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.960
before we take a quick break?

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.320
I'm not seeing any hands at this moment.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.320
So we're going to take a 15 minute break, it's 10.21.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.320
Let's come back at about 10.36.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.320
We will then go to public comment.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.320
The public comment slide is posted.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.320
If members of the public want to queue up for comment,

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.320
please call the number on that slide

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.320
and dial in the participant number.

01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.320
And then we'll go to public comment.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.160
And dial in the participant access code.

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:45.960
Then we'll take comment, have our board discussion,

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:49.640
and then go back to item 11

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.960
to be sure that everyone has had the opportunity to hear.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.400
All right, see you in 15 minutes.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.200
All right, we are back.

01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:10.440
And Brooks, could you please call the roll

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.640
to establish the quorum?

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.520
President Darling-Hammond.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.360
Here.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.320
Member Escobedo.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.160
Here.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.520
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.520
Here.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.320
Member Lewis.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.160
Here.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:26.240
Member McQuillan.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.080
Here.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.280
Member Olken.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.200
Here.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.680
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.720
Here.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.840
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.680
Here.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.480
Member Porter.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:39.320
Here.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.280
Member Rodriguez.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.120
Here.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.200
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.040
Here.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.200
Most present.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.160
All right, so at this point,

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.000
we are going to hear any public comment

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.160
that may be queued up for item 12.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.880
Is there any public comment?

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.640
We do not have any callers in the queue for public comment.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.160
All right, so now we're open for board discussion.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.800
Let us know if you have any comments

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.480
or questions on the item.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:19.480
I am seeing no hands raised.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.520
Do I have a motion to adopt the CDE recommendation?

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.400
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.560
So moved.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.400
So moved.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.240
Thank you.

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:34.360
Member Lewis, thank you.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.720
We have a second.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.600
I will now call a roll call vote.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.800
Brooks, please call the roll.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.040
President Darling-Hammond.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:42.880
Aye.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.560
Member Escobedo.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.520
Aye.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.680
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.720
Yes.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.560
Member Lewis.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:51.760
Yes.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.920
Member McQuillan.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720
Yes.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.560
Member Olken.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:00.040
Yes.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.360
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:03.680
Yes.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.600
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.280
Yes.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.400
Member Porter.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400
Yes.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.000
Member Rodriguez.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.080
Yes.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.160
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.080
Yes.

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.480
Motion carries unanimously.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:18.600
All right.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.080
And now because we did not have a fully functional sound

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.560
at the beginning of our meeting this morning,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.120
I am going to report again that in closed session,

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.160
the board discussed or took action

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.800
on the following legal matters,

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.520
Mark S. versus State,

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.080
Napa Valley Unified School District versus SBE.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.120
And then we're going to go to item 11,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.280
which is the approval of a charter school number

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:44.000
assigned to a newly established charter school,

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.120
Myakamas Charter Middle School.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.040
The CDE recommends that the State Board

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:50.080
assign a charter number to the charter school

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.440
identified in attachment one.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:53.640
And the item will be presented

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.640
by Stephanie Farland of the CDE.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.440
Stephanie, please begin.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.760
Thank you.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.640
I'm thrilled you wanted to see me again.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.480
Okay, so item 11, as mentioned,

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:10.800
the State Board of Education is responsible

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.880
for assigning a number to each approved charter petition.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.520
This item addresses the assignment

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.560
of a charter school number

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:20.680
for Myakamas Charter Middle School, MCMS,

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.840
a recently authorized charter school.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.880
A little background on numbering,

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:30.400
California Education Code 47602 states at the SBE

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.520
shall assign a number to each charter petition

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.760
that it grants pursuant to subdivision J

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:40.760
of section 47605 or section 47605.8

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.120
and to each charter notice it receives

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.880
based on the chronological order

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:46.760
in which the notice is received.

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.480
Each number shall correspond to a single petition

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.160
that identifies a charter school

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.160
that will operate within the geographic

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.240
and site limitations of this part.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.720
Myakamas Charter Middle School

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.600
was approved at the State Board

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.080
of Education's September 14, 15, 2022 meeting.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.400
The SBE reversed Napa Valley Unified School Districts

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.000
and the Napa County Board of Education's denials

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
of the MCMS petition pursuant to Ed Code 47605 K2E.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.000
At the same meeting, the SBE designated

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.840
the Napa County Office of Education

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.320
as the oversight agency for MCMS.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.120
MCMS is approved to operate

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.800
as a classroom-based charter school

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:30.120
for a five-year term of July 1, 2023

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.120
through June 30th, 2028.

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.960
The California Department of Education recommends

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.840
that the State Board assign charter number 2134 to MCMS.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.560
And that concludes my presentation.

01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.640
All right, and so the public comments slides

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.920
should be displayed so that we can open

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.080
the phone line for public comment.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.000
Members of the public wishing to provide comments,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
is there somebody putting that slide up?

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.720
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.440
on the item may do so by calling the number,

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.840
telephone number and using the access code

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.880
provided on the slide that will be shown momentarily.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.360
Okay, the slide is up.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:19.520
Just give them a few seconds

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.760
because of the potential lag in the broadcast.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.000
Yeah, we're not seeing the slide yet.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.720
Yeah, it seems like it's trying to come up.

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.480
Brooks, I'm not seeing the slide up yet.

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.240
So if there's a lag, it's a pretty long lag.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.960
It's on the webcast,

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:54.680
but it isn't showing here on the screen right now.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.440
Okay.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.680
So those who want to call in can see it.

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.120
If we're confident that it is on the webcast,

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:11.080
we can open the queue for public comment.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.000
Okay, we currently do not have any callers

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.480
in the queue for this item.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.880
Okay, we're sure that the slide is showing.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.960
Yes, we are. Okay.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.560
So be sure, and the sound is being heard.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.160
So with that, given that there's no public comment,

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.640
can I get a motion?

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.760
Yes, I would like to motion granting a charter number.

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.480
And a second?

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:42.760
I'll second it.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.600
Member Rodriguez, thank you.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.480
Brooks, can you call the roll?

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:47.680
President Darling-Hammond.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:49.960
Aye.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:50.800
Member Escobedo.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:52.680
Aye.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.960
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.880
Yes.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:56.760
Member Lewis.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.720
Yes.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:10:59.720
Member McQuillan.

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.560
Yes.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.400
Member Olken.

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.920
Yes.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.360
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.520
Yes.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.680
Member Patillo-Brownson.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:11.640
Yes.

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.240
Member Porter.

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.200
Yes.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.280
Member Rodriguez.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.320
Yes.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.400
Member Yesha-Mauritari.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.400
Yes.

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.120
Motion carries unanimously again.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:22.960
Thank you.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.000
All right, and now, thank you, Stephanie,

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.520
for representing the item,

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:32.000
and we are gonna move on to the waiver consent items.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.680
W1 through W5, and we will now open the phone line

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.960
for public comment again.

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.960
And is the slide being shown?

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:46.880
Yes, the slide is now up on the webcast.

01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:50.720
Okay, so if there are any public comments

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:54.480
on any waiver items one through five,

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.000
we encourage you to state your name

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.600
and affiliation for the record,

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:00.080
and the waiver item number,

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.680
and the district name to which you are speaking.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.360
Please remember to turn down speaker volume

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.400
of your computers if you are following the live feed.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.480
The speakers are limited to one minute each.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.520
Are there any public comments?

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.040
We do have one caller in the queue.

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.480
I will open up the phone line now.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:18.320
Thank you.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.160
Good morning.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.680
State your name and affiliation for the record.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:22.520
You have one minute.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.640
Your time starts now.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.200
Good morning, State Board of Education members.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.560
My name is Cassie Mancini

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.280
on behalf of the California School Employees Association.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.080
Thank you so much for reopening the lines on this item.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:39.480
I just am calling in on item number W04

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.280
related to torrents unified school districts labor request.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.800
CSEA very much appreciates the efforts of CDE staff

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.800
to work with us to ensure robust stakeholder engagement

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.520
on this item, and we're supportive

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.320
of the waiver with conditions.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.320
Thank you so much, and you have a great day.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.160
Thank you.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.080
And that concludes public comment for waiver consent items.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.280
All right.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.000
Given that there's no other public comment,

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.040
I'll now ask for a motion on waivers one through five.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.520
So moved.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.560
Member Rodriguez, and is there a second?

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
Second.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.960
Member Yoshimoto-Towry, thank you very much.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.760
And we will now hold a roll call vote.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.680
Brooks, please call the roll.

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:27.640
President Darling-Hammond.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.480
Aye.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.320
Member Escobedo.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.280
Aye.

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.560
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.400
Yes.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.240
Member Lewis.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:36.920
Yes.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.880
Member McQuillan.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.640
Aye.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.480
Member Olken.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.520
Yes.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:44.840
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.840
Yes.

01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:47.960
Member Patillo-Brownson.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:49.760
Yes.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.440
Member Porter.

01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:52.280
Yes.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.160
Member Rodriguez.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:55.120
Yes.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.280
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.240
Yes.

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.120
Motion carries unanimously again.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.040
Thank you.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.160
All right.

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.720
And we're gonna move on to item 13,

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.480
which is the public comment.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.680
General public comment is invited on any matter

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.040
not included on the printed agenda.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.320
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.520
on this item may do so by calling the numbers

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.560
shown on the public comment slide.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:19.360
Is that posted?

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.400
It's not where we can see it.

01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.600
It is being broadcast.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.520
Okay.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.440
And we encourage you to please state your name

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.080
and affiliation for the record.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.080
Remember to turn down the volume on your computer

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.120
if you're following the live feed.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:38.040
Speakers will be limited to one minute each.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.120
Are there any public comments?

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.360
We do not have any callers in the queue

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.200
for general public comment.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.880
All right.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.440
So now we're gonna reopen item one

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:53.480
to take action on the preliminary report of actions,

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:57.000
the draft November 2022 meeting minutes,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.760
take up appointments to the advisory commissions

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.240
and report on our liaison assignments.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.520
The first is the state board draft preliminary report

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.680
of actions minutes for the November 2022 meeting.

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.960
While we are waiting for any members of the public

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.520
to call in and is the slide posted again on the webcast?

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.720
Just double checking.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.600
Yes, it just went up.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.320
Okay, great.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.840
Do I have a motion from a board member

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:30.960
to approve the November 2022 state board of education

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.760
draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:35.960
Aye.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.760
I have a motion from member Roscoe Gonzales.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.600
Is there a second?

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.520
Second.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.360
Thank you, member Lewis.

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.000
And are there any public comments?

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.720
We do have one caller in the queue.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.880
I will open the phone line now.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.200
Okay.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.120
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.960
You have one minute.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:15:59.920
Your time starts now.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.520
Good morning, President Donahamn

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.720
and members of the board.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.480
My name is Nicholas Watson,

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.320
speaking on behalf

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.360
of the California Charter Schools Association.

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.840
He says, they applaud the state board

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:16.200
for its commitment to revisit the verified data list

01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.280
considered in charter school renewals.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.480
We respectfully urge the board to address verified data

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:25.760
no later than May, 2023 to give charter schools clarity

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.680
on which assessments they are allowed to submit

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:29.000
with renewal petitions.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.280
We'd also like to emphasize that we do not believe

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.080
that charter schools under the default standard

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.720
are required to submit verified data

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:38.200
as part of their renewal process.

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.520
We ask the state board to address this issue.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.240
We also ask the board to consider extending

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:46.440
pandemic considerations and verified data.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.440
Currently, the SBA approved verified data

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.560
only allow pandemic considerations for 2021,

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.280
but this should extend beyond a single school year.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:57.440
Finally, we recommend the board consider updating

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:01.600
gross norms data submitted for 2023-24 renewals

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.360
to account for the ways in which learning loss

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.640
has affected student performance.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.480
Thank you.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:07.640
Thank you.

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.480
Okay, that concludes public comment.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.520
Thank you.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.560
Is there any further discussion?

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.520
Seeing none.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.360
We have a motion and a second,

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:27.240
so we'll call the roll call vote to music.

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.920
It's kind of lovely.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.920
It's certainly the way that we're gonna see

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.160
as it snows out today.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.000
Hold on one moment.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:42.320
Darling Hammond.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.760
Aye.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:46.320
A member of Escobedo.

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.800
Aye.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.640
Aye.

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.480
Thank you, sir.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:51.320
Thank you.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.160
Thank you.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.000
Thank you.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:53.840
Thank you.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.680
Thank you.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.520
Thank you.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.360
Thank you.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.120
Thank you, sir.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.560
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.040
Yes.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:03.760
Member Lewis.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:04.600
Yes.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.160
Member McQuillan.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.240
Aye.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.080
Member Olken.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:10.440
Yes.

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:12.720
Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.800
Yes.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.840
Member Patelo-Brownson.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.760
Yes.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.480
Member Porter.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.360
Yes.

01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.120
Member Rosary, yes.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.960
Yes.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.840
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.680
Yes.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:25.640
Very unanimously.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.480
Thank you.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.920
So it's been an interesting audio visual meeting.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.120
Our next item is appointments to the ACCS,

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.120
the CPAC and IQC,

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.480
and I'll ask Vice President Glover-Woods

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.080
as Chair of the State Board Screening Committee

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.800
to present the committee's recommendations

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:49.040
for appointments to those three bodies.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.400
And we want the public comment slide to go up again

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.200
so that after you present your overview

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:56.600
and recommendations,

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:59.600
we can go to the phone line for public comment.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.240
Take it away.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.080
Well, thank you.

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.240
I'm happy to report that I will not be singing

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.320
the recommendations to you,

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.240
but I do want to share that the screening committee

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.480
did meet in December and January

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.800
to paper screen and interview candidates

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.720
for the California Practitioners Advisory Group,

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.240
also known as CPAC,

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:22.400
the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools, ACCS,

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:24.720
and the Instructional Quality Commission,

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.440
and the IQC.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.240
The screening committee included myself,

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.600
members Escovedo and Lewis,

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.600
and we were also joined by CDE and SBE staff members.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:41.120
So first to let you know our recommendation for CPAC,

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.600
for the California Practitioners Advisory Group,

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:48.000
the screening committee is recommending Samara Polko,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.400
oh, I'm sorry, Polko,

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.880
who is a Director of Education

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.240
with the California Catholic Conference,

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.520
and we are recommending that she serve

01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.920
as the representative for private school children.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:01.600
Her appointment is for three year term

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.600
starting January 3 through December 31st, 2025.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.680
We also are recommending that Judy Flores,

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:14.040
Superintendent of Shasta County Office of Education,

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.200
be appointed Vice Chair of the CPAC group.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.000
For the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.240
the screening committee is recommending Elio Brazil,

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.920
Superintendent of Keys Union Elementary School District,

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.840
and we recommend that he be appointed

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:35.080
as the commissioner representing district superintendents.

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.280
His appointment would be for a two year term,

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.240
which would start January 1st, 2023,

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.280
and go through December 31st, 2024.

01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:47.320
As it relates to the Instructional Quality Commission,

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:50.040
the committee is recommending Cole Vang,

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.440
who's the Curriculum Specialist

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:54.520
at the Sacramento County Office of Education.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:56.400
We recommend that she be appointed

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.040
as a commissioner representing teachers,

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.120
and that her appointment be for a four year term

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:07.120
starting January 1st, 2023, through December 31st, 2026.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.920
Lastly, we do want to let the Board know

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:16.080
as well as the public that we are currently recruiting

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.080
for two positions on the Advisory Commission

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.480
on Special Education.

01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:23.320
Preference will be given to applicants

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:26.280
who are representatives of charter schools

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:29.480
and parents of students with disabilities.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.000
The deadline to apply will be coming up,

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.720
and it will be February 3rd,

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.200
and we will bring our recommendations for appointments

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.320
to the Advisory Commission on Special Education

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:46.320
to the full Board for vote at the March 2023 meeting.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:49.000
So on behalf of the screening committee,

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.880
I'd like to say congratulations to all of those

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.080
who were selected for these various seats

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.960
on commissions and advisory groups,

01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.080
as well as a very large thank you to all who have applied

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:03.960
and took time to interview with us as well.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:04.800
Thank you.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:06.880
Thank you.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.160
I want to just be sure that we are able

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.640
to open the phone line for public comment

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.040
before we turn to our liaisons.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.920
Is the public comment slide up for the webcast?

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.680
It has just gone up,

01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:21.520
so we should probably give everyone

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.200
just a little bit of time here.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.440
Well, we're gonna hear from our liaisons

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.040
while the public is queuing up

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:30.960
to call the telephone number and use the access code

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.760
provided on the slide that is being shown now.

01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.160
And while we're waiting for the members of the public

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.080
to call in, I want to ask Member Lewis

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.720
and then Member Escobedo,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.200
who served on the screening committee

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.200
if they have any initial comments.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.040
Member Lewis.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:48.360
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.960
I would just like to add that we had

01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:52.440
a lot of great candidates,

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:56.440
and I think the individuals who were chosen

01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.560
were also great candidates

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:02.640
and that we expect great things from them

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.440
and just appreciative for all who applied

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.640
for the various positions.

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.320
Terrific, thank you.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.640
Member Escobedo.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.800
Member Escobedo.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:18.800
I just appreciate SBE staff as well as CDE staff.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.000
I mean, in some cases they were hard decisions,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.840
but we really push our thinking

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:30.240
and we do believe we got the very best

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:33.080
in these committee groups

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:38.080
and really look forward to their unique perspective

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.440
in giving us advice and making decisions

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:44.080
on what's best for students.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.400
So really appreciate the thoughtfulness

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:53.200
and the whole organizational structure

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.080
to make this occur.

01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:00.080
So, and of course, Dr. Glover Woods is amazing

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:04.680
in how she organizes and ensures

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:08.040
that we're walking a very straight path.

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:10.280
That's terrific.

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.400
And I want to just appreciate

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.440
all of the committee members as well as the staff.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.440
It's an enormous job, takes a lot of care.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:18.560
And it's also a process of trying to figure out

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.920
how to get the diversity of views

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.320
and individuals who allow the group

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.440
to be greater than the sum of the parts

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:27.640
in making decisions.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.560
So I know there's a lot of thought

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:31.240
that goes into all of that.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.120
We really appreciate all the time and effort

01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:36.440
and good thinking that you put into it.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:41.240
We want to see now if there are any clarifying questions

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:44.200
and then we'll go to public comment if there is any.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.760
Any clarifying questions?

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.280
All right, that was very clear.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.480
And is there any public comment?

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.280
No, we do not have any callers in the queue

01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.040
for public comment.

01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:58.280
All right, so is there any further discussion

01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280
among the Board?

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.000
And so I think we're now ready for a motion.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.840
Did I get a motion?

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:09.440
Yes, I move that the Board accept

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:14.440
the recommended appointments from the screening committee.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.880
Thank you, Member Glover-Woods, is there a second?

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.480
I second that motion.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.560
Thank you very much, Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.800
And at that point, I think we just want

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.040
to get a roll call vote.

01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.080
President Darling-Hammond.

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:28.920
Aye.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.640
Member Escobedo.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.480
Aye.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.640
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.480
Yes.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.120
Member Lewis.

01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:36.960
Yes.

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.720
Member McQuillan.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.600
Yes.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.440
Member Olken.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.280
Yes.

01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.760
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.920
Yes.

01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.000
Member Patilla-Brownson.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:48.840
Yes.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.400
Member Porter.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.240
Yes.

01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:53.000
Member Rodriguez.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:53.840
Yes.

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.800
Member Yoshio Mototari.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.760
Yes.

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.760
Motion carries unanimously.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.360
All right, thank you so much, Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:06.440
And we're now going to move to our liaison reports

01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:09.160
on activities that are not related

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.760
to any items on our January agenda.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.720
And we're going to call on board members

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.320
in alphabetical order based on last name.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.720
So, Member Escobedo, you're going to start us off.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:22.320
Surely.

01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:26.600
We'd like to talk about my role with NASB,

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:29.200
which is the National Association

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:32.120
of School Boards of Education.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:36.280
They empower state board members to leverage their role

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.440
in the educational federal ecosystem

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:42.320
to lead for both equity and excellence.

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:46.520
And I would like to have our colleagues,

01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:51.160
if they can, attend a annual conference that they have.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:56.160
And it's typically at a different state each year.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.400
And this year is going to be in California,

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:02.600
specifically in my backyard, San Diego.

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.640
So it's going to be on October 25th through the 28th.

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.320
I'll send you more details later,

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.320
but they typically have experts

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:25.120
to help state board members design systems, right?

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.600
That can really expand on the equity and excellence efforts

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.240
at each state.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:38.240
So I'm also part of the planning committee

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.880
for this conference.

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.960
And we'll be attending,

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.400
I'll be representing our state at a webinar

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:50.440
focused on leadership,

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:55.440
on how can state agencies enhance educational leadership

01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.960
throughout their state as well.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.160
I will be attending a February meeting for CPAC.

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.200
And at that meeting,

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:13.960
we'll have a final draft of the state plan for approval.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.960
And we'll have, we'll overview the preliminary results

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:23.200
for our round eight B.

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:28.080
And I think Trustee McQuillan will talk a little bit more

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:31.520
about the meeting that we had in November as well.

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.640
And that is my report and looking again forward

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.280
to my work as liaison for this year.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.360
And if people have ideas for the program,

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:42.760
it sounds like this is the time

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:45.680
to get those to member Escobedo.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.880
Thank you, thanks for doing that.

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.320
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.760
Yes, I'd like to say that member Lewis

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.960
will be sharing a bit more

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.960
about the instructional quality commission

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.360
and member Olken will be talking

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.480
about the advisory commission on charter schools.

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.240
So I'd like to take my time just to provide the board

01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.120
with an update regarding the California

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:09.080
Collaborative for Educational Excellence,

01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.200
also known as CCE.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.240
So there are three areas

01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.320
that I'd like to share with you very briefly.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:19.440
The first is in regards to the work CCE has been doing

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.240
with the community engagement initiative

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.440
and wanted to let the board know that really this past

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.200
about a week or so ago, January 11th through the 13th,

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.240
the community engagement initiative had its first

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.280
or had an in-person cohort,

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:37.280
professional learning network

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.960
and it included cohorts one, two and three.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:43.640
And there were over 44 LEAs that were there.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:45.440
So schools and school districts,

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.280
county office and of education

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:50.880
from that span the state from Shasta

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:52.560
all the way to Imperial County.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:53.720
So they were all present

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.880
at that professional learning network

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.320
that took place on January 11th through 13th.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:02.680
And if you would like more information,

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:03.680
you can definitely go

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:07.000
to the community engagement initiative website

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.040
and also encourage you to find out more

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:12.520
about the work that's being done in that area

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:17.520
by visiting the californiaengage.org website as well.

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.400
CCE also has a learning acceleration systems grant

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.600
and I just like to share with the board that very soon,

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.520
the collaborative for learning acceleration

01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.520
is going to be launching some free online modules

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:36.160
related to areas of math and literacy

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.040
and language development.

01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.800
Also the first annual summit

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:43.640
is going to be held March 11th, 2023.

01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:45.320
And so for more information,

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.920
you can of course definitely go to the CCE website

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.680
or I'm more than happy to share any information

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.080
that I may have as well.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.880
There's also going to be a workshop

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.840
hosted by Project CLEAR,

01:30:58.840 --> 01:31:00.080
which and it'll be a series

01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:02.960
of free afterschool virtual workshops

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.840
where participants will be able to explore

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:08.720
literacy teaching and learning strategies.

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.720
Lastly, just to let everyone know

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.500
that the data research learning networks,

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.640
which is an opportunity for districts and counties

01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:20.800
to transform their data policies and practices

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.760
and programs has begun.

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.360
There's already an initial cohort.

01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:30.360
If interested in the next cohort for the 2023, 2024 year,

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.920
please stay posted and keep your eyes open.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.600
More information will be coming out in the spring.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.600
Thank you very much.

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:50.880
I think you might be on mute, Linda.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:55.160
Member Lewis, it is your turn.

01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.080
Sorry about that.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:01.240
Okay, thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.560
First report I'll give

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.040
is for the Instructional Quality Commission.

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.640
And as Vice President Gloverwood said,

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:12.240
we both serve as liaisons to this commission.

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.280
And so five commissioners have reached the end

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:16.760
of their terms last month

01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:19.920
and the student commissioner for the IQC

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:24.600
will term out at the end of this year, this school year.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:28.040
And at the November meeting, if you recall,

01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:29.760
the State Board of Education appointed

01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.600
four new commissioners and one student commissioner.

01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:34.640
And as we just heard today,

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:39.160
we appointed one more commissioner to the IQC.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.240
The next meeting for the Quality Commission

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.360
will be next week.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.800
We'll have an orientation for new members at this meeting.

01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:52.520
Additional topics at next week's meeting

01:32:52.520 --> 01:32:56.320
include the election of the chair, the vice chair,

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.880
and the executive committee members,

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:02.400
the appointment of subject matter committee chairs,

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.800
assignment of members to the subject matter committees,

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:08.440
the designation of liaisons.

01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.440
We'll also be reviewing the 2023 IQC goals

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.080
and a review of the bylaws.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:18.360
And if you want information,

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:23.360
the agenda has been posted to the IQC Commission 2023

01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:27.440
public meeting notices, agendas, minutes, webcasts page

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:30.920
on the California Department of Education website.

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:38.640
My next report is for the California subject matter

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:42.960
concurrence committee.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.800
Just briefly, if you're not aware of this committee,

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:51.040
their mission states that with an unwavering commitment

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:53.640
to equity, the California subject matter project

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.600
seeks to improve student learning

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:58.480
through discipline-specific research-based,

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:01.800
sustained professional learning and leadership programs

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:05.040
for TK through 16 educators.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.960
And you may already know each of the nine projects

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.960
in the CSMP network centers on specific subject matter.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.800
And to better serve communities across California,

01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.240
each project has regional sites

01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.240
at different colleges and universities,

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.680
and they host professional learning programs for educators.

01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:29.560
The nine discipline-specific networks

01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:32.240
and more than 80 regional sites

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:36.200
serve approximately 25,000 educators

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:41.160
from more than 1,200 school districts on an annual basis.

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:46.160
And the last meeting that we had was on January the 9th,

01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.800
and I'll just share a summary of that meeting.

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.280
And Claudia Martinez from the University of California

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:56.480
Office of the President is the executive director

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.400
of the CSMP.

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:03.000
And she gave a presentation regarding the fiscal outlook

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.720
that's connected to the CSMP and the work that they do.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:10.600
And she reported a steady-based funding to continue

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:14.240
and state funding to the UC Office of the President.

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:18.280
And there is federal ESSA funding subcontracted

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:21.480
with the California Department of Education.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.400
Consecutive one-time state appropriations

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.400
between the year 2019 and 2023

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.560
targeted various areas of professional learning.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:38.560
And an estimated 25 million in additional funding since 2019

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.640
targeted multiple statewide initiatives.

01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:46.320
And so I'll just give you a summary of the initiatives

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:51.320
that are being supported by this funding through the CSMP.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:55.680
The first is expanded services during the pandemic,

01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.040
including a response to COVID-related learning acceleration.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.600
Second, supporting school districts and county office leaders

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.600
through the 21st Century School Leadership Academy partnership.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:13.280
Third, supporting novice and guest teachers

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.400
through the California for Educational Excellence,

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:19.080
CCEE partnership,

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.880
and the development of new cross-disciplinary programs

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.960
focused on racial justice,

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.360
climate change, education, and environmental justice.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.520
And also additional support

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.200
for recent state-funded priorities,

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.320
namely ethnic studies and computer science.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320
And I tell you, it was the second meeting

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.200
that I'd attended with this group.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:45.120
And the meetings are very insightful

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.480
with all the work that they're doing

01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:49.880
to support leaders and educators across California.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.760
And it's just wonderful to hear about the details

01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:55.880
of the various initiatives that they have going

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.480
and to hear the enthusiasm

01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:01.040
and the voices of the various committee members

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:03.280
as they made their reports.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:08.280
There's a lot of support being provided from this group

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:11.160
to our teachers and administrators.

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.240
And the hope is that all of the professional learning

01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:17.960
will trickle down to the classrooms across the state

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:22.960
to facilitate positive outcomes for our students.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.400
And if anyone is liking specific information

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.440
about what some of these initiatives are,

01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.080
I can certainly give that.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:34.320
Was trying to be succinct in my report,

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:36.400
but I do have the information handy

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.920
if anyone would like additional information

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.600
about any of those initiatives.

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:46.240
Thank you so much.

01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:47.200
Member McClellan.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:51.880
Thank you.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:55.240
So my report, the first part of it

01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.240
is the California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.960
report from there, from the November meeting.

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:10.520
This committee, in addition to guiding the development

01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.320
of the CTE state plan is responsible

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:18.960
for annually approving the CTE data report

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:20.600
and timeline for meeting

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.400
the Career Technical Education Incentive Grant, CTIG,

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.360
and the kindergarten through grade 12

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.960
strong workforce program data matrix.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.400
At our November 2022 meeting,

01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.800
the CDE staff presented the following.

01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:44.800
We heard a data metrics report

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.800
and we're pleased to report the CTE students

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.560
continue to outperform all other students

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:57.000
in terms of their graduation rate and the CASP results.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.920
We also heard funding results

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:04.640
from the CTIG round eight requests for proposals.

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.560
And then we heard information on the recommended edits

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.480
to the CTE state plan made by members

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:18.320
of the September committee meeting.

01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:24.080
From the 45 day public comment period

01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:29.080
on the statewide plan, we heard the following themes,

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.200
aligning across a statewide range of sectors

01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.080
and interest holders, tackling CTE teacher shortages

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.520
and credentialing, addressing challenges

01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:46.520
to implementing the high quality WBL, work-based learning,

01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:51.680
boosting access to high quality CTE,

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:56.040
support in building out dual enrollment,

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.840
supports and services for all student populations,

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:05.320
recognizes student leadership development,

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.040
ensuring preparation options for college and careers,

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:14.400
supporting sustainable funding strategies

01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.160
and improving data collection and use.

01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.000
Those were the themes that were collected

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.560
in the 45 day listening public comment period

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.720
for the statewide plan.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.200
Our next meeting is set for February 3rd.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.760
We will hear jobs for the future.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.040
We'll do a presentation on the final draft

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.440
of the statewide plan for CTE.

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:46.680
CDE staff will present the preliminary results

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:49.200
from the CTIG round eight B.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.160
And then the chancellor's office

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:56.080
for the community college staff will present results

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.080
from the 2022-23 strong workforce grant program.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:05.400
So that's what we have for the career technical education.

01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.240
A second point of interest is I've recently been appointed

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.240
to serve as a state board of education liaison

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.200
to the model curriculum coordinating council.

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:24.440
And this council has the charge of the creation

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.240
of the statewide model curriculum,

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.240
coordinating council as specified in AB 167.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.480
The council's purpose is to oversee the development

01:41:38.480 --> 01:41:41.560
of the four new model curricula,

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.160
including the Vietnamese American refugee experience,

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:51.160
the Cambodian genocide among history and cultural studies

01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:54.320
as well as the Native American studies.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:42:00.320
AB 167 requires the model curricula related

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.520
to the Vietnamese American refugees experience,

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:08.960
Cambodian genocide among history and cultural studies

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:12.360
be developed by September 1st, 2024.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.400
The Native American studies curricula

01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.160
needs to be developed by September 1st, 2025.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.280
We're working with West Ed,

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.600
we'll be facilitating the council meetings

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.720
which will convene four times per year.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.440
And the first one will be January 31st,

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.720
here in a week or so.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.480
And that's all I have to report.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.320
Thank you.

01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:48.920
Apologies, President Arnham,

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.480
I believe you're still on mute.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:52.920
I was just saying, it's great to hear

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:56.840
about the model curriculum committee that is launching

01:42:56.840 --> 01:42:59.120
and so glad that you're gonna be part of that.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.320
Member Olken, you're up next.

01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.280
Great, thank you.

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:08.440
And I was just, unfortunately when member McQuillan

01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:11.240
was reporting my internet froze twice.

01:43:11.240 --> 01:43:15.400
So hopefully if I freeze, I'll be smiling.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.520
In any case, I'm really,

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:23.960
I appreciate this opportunity to share out on a few things.

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.480
First, as Vice President Glover-Woods said,

01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:29.960
I'm gonna report briefly on the advisory commission

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.920
on charter schools.

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.640
We had an item that was on the consent calendar,

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:36.240
so I won't go into that.

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:39.360
But we did have the opportunity to thank

01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:44.360
four outgoing commissioners who had served the commission

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.720
extraordinarily well in the last meeting.

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.480
And it was just such an honor to hear

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.040
all of the good work that they've done.

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:56.320
So I just wanna give them a thank you here today.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:01.320
So the four outgoing commissioners were Andrea Faisal,

01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.480
Gail Garbolino-Mojica, Jared Austin and Wes Siever.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.080
And they were incredible participants

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.600
and members of that commission.

01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:17.600
The other, I actually have switched liaison assignments

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.040
other than that since we last met.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:25.080
So I'm gonna talk briefly about my new assignment

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:28.040
and then a project that I get to be part of.

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:32.360
So my new liaison assignment is I am the liaison

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.080
for environmental literacy, which I'm very excited about.

01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.080
And I note that President Darling Hammond

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.560
has mentioned the importance of this work twice already

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.840
in our meetings since we started the year,

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:52.000
both at our first meeting in September

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.360
and our meeting in January.

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:54.200
I mean, this one.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:00.040
First, we were in the midst of a incredible heat storm

01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:03.240
and fires across the state in September.

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.280
And then now we're all drying out

01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:09.400
after weeks of flooding across the state.

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.400
And both because of these environmental disasters

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:19.000
and also because our young people are so well equipped

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000
to lead us out of these problems with the environment.

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.760
I'm really excited to be able to be a liaison in this role.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.680
As President Darling Hammond noted,

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:35.440
the state has made some significant investments

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.000
in environmental literacy

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.240
over the last several budget cycles.

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.240
And they range from investments in curriculum

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.760
and professional development for teachers

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:52.160
in efforts to implement frameworks

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.120
that were established a few years back

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:58.600
to greening our school fleets.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.280
And one of the things I think that's particularly

01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:06.160
both exciting and challenging about this role

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.040
is the way in which we really all have to work together

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.240
across agencies and departments

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.560
to make a significant impact on the environment.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:24.640
But I think we recognize that young people growing up

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.440
with an understanding of the impact

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.840
that they make either intentionally

01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:33.520
or unintentionally on the environment

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.360
and the ways in which through science education

01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:43.000
and research and strong leadership,

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.640
they can help be part of the solution

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.120
because environmental literacy

01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:51.520
is in fact a climate change solution.

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:55.160
I think this is a really exciting assignment.

01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:57.360
And I just wanted to note that when yesterday

01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:01.680
Nate Watts, who was one of the students

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:04.880
for the US Senate program,

01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:07.360
spoke about his desire to work

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:08.880
in environmental sustainability

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:11.000
and to be a leader in those efforts.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.360
I knew I was in the right place

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.680
with this new liaison assignment.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:17.000
So that's the first thing.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.680
And then the second thing I think also equally impactful

01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:26.680
and exciting for me is I have the opportunity

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:31.680
to serve on a panel of experts from across the state

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.680
related to improving, strengthening

01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:42.680
and refining the IEP template that we use in California.

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.200
There has been some incredible work already done.

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:50.080
In the last year, there was a work group

01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.760
of key stakeholders and practitioners

01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:55.560
that got us really far along in this work.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:59.480
And I'm excited to be part of the group

01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:02.000
that is looking at ways we can continue

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.680
to ensure that IT template drives

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:08.400
student-centered, family-centered,

01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.280
jargon-free, assets-based, team-oriented,

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.040
hopes-driven IEPs for our young people.

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.160
It feels like we're on the right track

01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:29.840
and it's exciting because we know

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:31.640
all the incredible contributions

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:36.240
that our students with disabilities have to offer.

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:40.000
And I think the process, the IEP process

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.440
can both affirm all of those contributions

01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.080
and help realize them.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:46.280
So I'm really excited about that work as well.

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:50.960
And I think that's it.

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:51.960
Thank you so much.

01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.560
That's great, thank you.

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.120
Member Roscoe-Gonzalez.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:01.280
We didn't have a chance to,

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:04.400
the opportunity to meet this past month on assessments,

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:06.880
which is my liaison assignment.

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.360
Holidays got in the way, but through my exploration

01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.080
and the in-depth presentation on item three,

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.560
I think of all the teachers throughout the state

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.640
just reviewing resources to help their students

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.320
demonstrate the standards they've mastered

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.560
throughout the academic year and getting ready for that.

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:30.800
I know there's anxiety and preparation,

01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.320
and I think that sometimes the best way to prepare

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.160
is to research and go back into the tools

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:42.120
for teachers at the CDE and take all the resources

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.560
they can to prepare.

01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:47.520
I'm really interested in, like we mentioned in item three,

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:51.240
how the teachers can review the two sets of educator

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.200
resources that are prepared by Smarter Balance

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.520
to help them with their higher order thinking skills.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:01.240
I think that the integrated deeper learning resources,

01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.520
those instructional resources will help support students

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.560
and educators in that full range of higher order

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:10.480
thinking skills that can be measured.

01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:12.800
There's a lot of professional learning resources

01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.840
on the CDE website and the SBAC website to help them

01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.480
build just that community with their PLC,

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:23.800
their professional learning communities at school

01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:27.240
and at the district level and just continue

01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.640
to provide resources for teachers

01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:33.280
to help get their students to meet

01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:35.120
that proficient or advanced level.

01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:38.120
That's it.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:39.960
All right.

01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.840
Member Patilla Brunson.

01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:48.520
So there's a couple of items related

01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:51.760
to the early learning liaison work.

01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:54.600
We had the December California Early Childhood Policy

01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:59.040
Council meeting where we heard from the Department of Ed,

01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.040
folks who have actually provided presentations

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:05.000
yesterday and today.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.120
There was also, I think, really important information

01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:12.520
about some misconceptions that are sometimes

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:15.760
out there circulating that we're trying to figure out

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:18.720
how to address and ensure that the misconceptions

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:21.560
don't really take on a life of their own.

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:23.760
There's a section of that agenda around voices

01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.760
from the field and there was representation

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:34.040
from providers of state preschool classrooms,

01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:37.840
teachers who were describing how there was some confusion

01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:40.080
among school districts about whether

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:43.480
transitional kindergarten implementation implied

01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:45.120
that school districts should ramp down

01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.200
their state preschool programs.

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.640
And as I think was demonstrated by yesterday's presentation

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:53.080
by Sarah Neville-Morgan from the CDE,

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:57.920
the idea of a universal preschool pre-K program

01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:00.600
is to have both TK for four-year-olds

01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.200
as well as ongoing state preschool programs

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:05.960
for three-year-olds on a targeted basis

01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:09.040
and that school districts can play an important role

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:11.600
in that, so that I think goes in the list

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.040
of important information that we need to ensure

01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:17.080
is out there so that the full benefit

01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.200
of some of these recent early learning investments

01:52:19.200 --> 01:52:22.040
can be had for both threes and fours.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.640
There was also a presentation

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:25.600
by the Department of Social Services

01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.440
on the transition of childcare programs.

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:29.200
This is primarily more in the zero to two

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.200
and aftercare spaces and the impact

01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:37.640
from recent budget investments on stipends

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:42.640
for reopening providers across a set of age groups,

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.640
both for aftercare for kids who are school age

01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:48.720
as well as zero to five.

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.640
Also in December, the official kickoff

01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.560
and establishment of the universal preschool

01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:00.120
mixed delivery work group began

01:53:00.120 --> 01:53:02.640
and we'll actually be having our very first meeting

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:04.840
actually next week.

01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.080
The focus of this work group is to provide recommendations

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.760
on increasing access and updating preschool standards

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:15.400
as was provided in legislation.

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:19.040
Importantly, I think members include many folks

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:22.600
from the mixed delivery service from community-based settings

01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:26.040
but also representatives from the county offices of ed

01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:30.640
and from TK program leads as well as school districts

01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:34.720
which again provide both transitional kindergarten programs

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:36.880
but also provide more than half

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:40.520
of California's state preschool programs already.

01:53:41.800 --> 01:53:45.720
The last update is also related to NASB

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:47.880
which I think was covered earlier.

01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:52.880
NASB has a early learning work group

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:55.280
which convened in December.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:56.600
California is a new member

01:53:56.600 --> 01:53:59.560
of the early childhood education state network.

01:53:59.560 --> 01:54:02.760
It's their fourth cohort of learning states

01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:07.320
and we are now alongside North Carolina and DC

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:11.800
covering both how different states are looking

01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.760
to basically bolster their early learning offerings

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:17.320
for children and families

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.360
but also to do the work of coordination

01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.480
with other state agencies in terms of workforce development,

01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:26.080
teacher pipeline, accreditation, curriculum,

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:27.720
and accountability.

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:31.320
And that brings my report to its conclusion.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:32.560
Thank you.

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:34.240
Terrific.

01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.080
Exciting to hear about all of the early learning work

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.680
that's going on.

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:39.440
Member Porter.

01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:41.200
Thank you so much, President Darling-Hammons.

01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.000
I'm gonna keep my report pretty brief

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.640
and just highlight two main areas that I've been working in.

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.920
And so the first is that I served as a presenter

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:52.480
at the Association of California School Administrators

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:53.880
Region 14 Conference

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:57.880
alongside Board President Eileen Strauss

01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.160
and this was a great opportunity

01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:01.600
to discuss statewide priorities

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:04.800
and I personally spoke about student concerns

01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:08.720
and how to effectively include student voice

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:10.920
and from there ended with an opportunity

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:14.080
to work with these districts superintendents

01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.200
and administrators to create

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.520
their own student advisory councils

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:20.360
and work with me to do so as a way

01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.800
to accurately get student input on local decisions.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.000
Second, I've been meeting

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.960
with various student advisory groups

01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:30.120
and I think one of the most impactful conversations

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:34.120
was with San Diego Unified School District students.

01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.280
I met with them initially to share opportunities

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.680
to expand their advocacy on district and statewide level

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:44.200
and then the conversation kind of pivoted

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:46.360
to talking about financial literacy,

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.000
mental health and school safety as statewide concerns

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.840
and so specifically students were interested

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:54.560
in more resources available to them

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:58.400
learning about taxes and post-secondary education options

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:00.160
and smart investment decisions

01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.640
and so we had a very important conversation

01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:04.640
that I think we continue to have as a board as well

01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:06.960
and conversations like these are truly

01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:08.760
at the center of my work

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.400
and I'm really looking forward to meeting

01:56:10.400 --> 01:56:13.840
with more student advisory groups in the upcoming months

01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.880
and that concludes my report, thank you.

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.000
Terrific, I love the fact that we're getting

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.640
student voice engaged all over the state,

01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.080
thank you for doing that.

01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:27.440
Next is member Rodriguez.

01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:31.920
Good morning, President, members and public.

01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:36.080
So I have a few updates,

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.600
the CTC for member Olkins benefit

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:43.120
commission on teacher credentialing met in December

01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:45.960
and I have a few important and exciting updates.

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:50.360
First, we celebrated the leadership of Chair Tina Sloan

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:51.880
and welcome the new leadership

01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.680
of Commissioner Marquita Grenoche Shire

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:58.520
who served for years as an ex officio CTC member

01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.400
representing the CSU in her capacity

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.280
as Assistant Vice Chancellor of Educator Prep

01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:07.280
and Public Schools Program.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:10.600
The commission benefited immeasurably

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:12.600
from the leadership of Chair Sloan

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:16.400
and we are all excited to support Chair Grenoche Shire

01:57:16.400 --> 01:57:17.880
to take on the reins.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.160
The CTC is completing a multi-year

01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:23.560
strategic planning process

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.080
just in time for the new chair to lead its implementation.

01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:29.680
The plan includes changes in recent years

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:31.960
to the CTC's responsibilities

01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.280
such as the administration of various grant programs

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.520
related to the educator workforce,

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.480
expansion of early childhood education prep

01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.320
and licensure activities and the strengthening

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:47.280
of data gathering and reporting efforts.

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:50.480
The numbers meeting also heard an update

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.800
to the classified school employee

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.680
teacher credentialing program.

01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:59.680
The 2021-22 state budget appropriated $125 million

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.760
to be distributed over five years for LEAs

01:58:04.760 --> 01:58:07.760
to support classified staff to become teachers.

01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:11.640
Round one allocated 14 million to 40 LEAs

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:15.400
to support nearly 3,000 staff to become educators

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.160
and the round two RFA deadline closed in December.

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:22.480
Previous funding in 2016 and 2017

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.480
supported 2,260 staff to become educators.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:29.120
If LEAs in your area haven't applied,

01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.160
tell them to keep their eyes out for future rounds of funding.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.240
Next, a topic near and dear to my heart,

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:39.800
the CTC heard an update from CBE's

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.000
National Board and Center Program,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:46.640
which as you may recall offers teachers a $2,500 subsidy

01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:48.720
to obtain their certification

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:51.560
and offers national board certified teachers

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:55.600
$5,000 a year for five years if they teach in a school

01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.200
serving 55% or more unduplicated students.

01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:03.040
In 21-22, the first year of the program,

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:07.600
the subsidy was awarded to, everybody sitting down,

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:12.600
1,712 teachers working in high priority schools,

01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:14.480
which is four times the number

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:18.600
that pursued certification prior to the subsidy

01:59:18.600 --> 01:59:21.560
and four times the number of BIPOC teachers.

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:26.200
The certification incentive was awarded to 1,945 teachers

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:28.480
also working in high priority schools

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:30.200
and the vast majority of the teachers

01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:32.200
are in Los Angeles County.

01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:36.440
So kudos to LA, LA County and a shout out

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:39.720
to the rest of the state to step up the subscription

01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:41.520
to this incredible program.

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:48.200
A couple of proposed draft literacy programs

01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:52.920
and TPEs for early childhood education

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.520
and deaf and hard of hearing credentials

01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:57.120
are open for public comment.

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:01.280
So since we've been talking about early childhood education,

02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:04.640
if you'd like to comment on the standards,

02:00:04.640 --> 02:00:07.440
the public comment period is open

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:12.440
and you can visit the CTC website, which is ctc.ca.gov

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:15.600
and you'll find further information

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:17.280
on the page that you land.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:22.840
And also the commission established a new webpage

02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:25.640
dedicated to information and resources

02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:30.640
regarding the PK3 ECE specialist instruction credential.

02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.480
So if you go to the CTC webpage,

02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:38.160
you'll find the information and you can go there

02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:41.240
because otherwise it's a very long URL.

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:43.720
On this webpage, links are available

02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:49.680
to the PK3 ECE specialist construction credential handbook,

02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:54.680
authorizations, requirements, standards and teaching.

02:00:55.680 --> 02:01:00.160
Next on moving on to going back in the past here,

02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:04.800
November 15th, I had the privilege

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:08.280
of attending the Civic Learning Summit in Sacramento,

02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:11.440
which was sponsored by Californians for Civic Learning

02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:13.480
in partnership with the Power of Democracy

02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.040
Civic Learning Initiative, Sacramento

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.480
and Los Angeles County Office of Ed.

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.040
There were about 150 of us in attendance

02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.480
at the California Museum.

02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.800
Secretary of State Shirley Weber

02:01:28.800 --> 02:01:32.960
delivered a very dynamic opening address

02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:37.040
where she compared our democracy to gardening, right?

02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:40.200
And when we tend to flowers and they grow,

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.160
they grow beautifully, but if we start ignoring the weeds,

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:47.280
they can pop up and within a matter of days, months,

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.120
you walk out and your garden's full of weeds.

02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:50.440
So we have to tend,

02:01:50.440 --> 02:01:54.520
Power of Democracy was her very powerful message.

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:56.280
There were presentations from students,

02:01:56.280 --> 02:02:01.280
which was the reason that we were there.

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.760
Clovis Tarpey Elementary, the students presented

02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:08.160
on their service learning projects.

02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:11.760
Edison High School, Black Student Union from Fresno

02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:13.880
presented on how they organized

02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:16.400
and called out racist images on social media.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:19.560
A dozen of the students spoke

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.960
to the Fresno Unified School Board.

02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:27.960
And many of them were speaking publicly for the first time,

02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.280
but they were prompted by a social media photo

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.480
that surfaced of a high school student wearing

02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:35.640
or resemble the KKK hood.

02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:41.320
And so the Black students at Fresno Unified

02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.760
say that racial harassment intensified

02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:47.920
and especially after racially motivated crimes

02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:50.200
as the ones in Buffalo and Orange County.

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:54.840
And students from Anaheim School District

02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:57.120
delivered powerful Ted Talks,

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:01.600
where one student talked about having empathy

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:04.680
and understanding and reaching out to refugees.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:08.080
And another young man talked about food deserts

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:11.560
and how sometimes poor communities have more access

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:15.040
to fast food versus healthy food.

02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:17.520
Incredibly powerful Ted Talks.

02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:21.480
And it was just, you know, we were all compelled to action.

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:23.680
Lastly, Christine Benson,

02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:26.560
the Chair of NASB's Board of Directors,

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:30.160
invited me to co-chair the PEP Committee,

02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:32.720
PEP Public Education Position.

02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:38.720
And so the NASB, she contacted President Darling Hammond

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:42.720
and then submitted my name to the Board of Directors

02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.360
and they approved my appointment in December.

02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:46.400
And so we'll be currently,

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.600
I'll be meeting with the Chair, Lisa Fricke,

02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:53.080
and we'll be planning out what'll be happening

02:03:53.080 --> 02:03:58.080
for the next meeting, which we'll present in San Diego.

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.640
Member Escobedo, you talked about the upcoming NASB meeting.

02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.560
So thank you, President and members.

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:06.800
That concludes my report.

02:04:10.120 --> 02:04:11.400
Thank you so much.

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.840
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:17.000
Thank you, Board President.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.040
So I'm happy to report

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:20.600
that I have four new liaison duties.

02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:24.480
And I will just briefly touch base on each of those today.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:26.000
The first one is Civic Learning

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.840
and Board Member Rodriguez did such a great job

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:31.400
explaining the event in November

02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:32.600
that I'm not gonna reiterate,

02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:34.640
other than to say we were just really excited

02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:35.920
to see the students.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.560
Their teachers are there, their principals,

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:41.120
their superintendents and their families.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.440
And we were joined by the Chief Justice of California,

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:44.800
Patricia Guerrero,

02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.120
and she got to meet with each of the students as well.

02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:48.680
So that was very exciting.

02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:49.960
The second liaison duty

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.720
is the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:54.800
And as you know, the members of this commission

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:55.960
provide an important service

02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:58.080
by making recommendations to us,

02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.800
to the governor, to the legislature

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:04.160
of research and program development and evaluation.

02:05:04.160 --> 02:05:08.600
And what's exciting is with the passage of Senate Bill 291,

02:05:08.600 --> 02:05:11.600
the commission will now have two student members

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.840
with exceptional needs,

02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.120
speaking to student voice,

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.760
ages 16 to 22 for one year terms.

02:05:18.760 --> 02:05:21.760
So that's something to be very proud of.

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:23.040
And the next in-person meeting

02:05:23.040 --> 02:05:26.200
is February 15th and 16th in Sacramento.

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.080
And my third liaison duty is English learners

02:05:29.080 --> 02:05:31.880
along with board member Escobedo.

02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:32.920
And as some of you know,

02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:34.600
I grew up with my great grandparents

02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:35.880
who were English learners.

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:37.720
And so I have a special place in my heart

02:05:37.720 --> 02:05:40.520
for the assets, the wisdom and the courage

02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:43.160
that comes with the English learner experience.

02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:45.480
And the next English learner specialist convening

02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:48.920
will be Wednesday, also February 15th in Sacramento.

02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:51.840
And so I'll be excited to be there.

02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:54.560
And then finally, my fourth liaison duty

02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:55.960
is the community schools

02:05:55.960 --> 02:05:58.840
that I share with board president Darling Hammond.

02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:02.480
And so any day now, please be on the lookout

02:06:02.480 --> 02:06:06.720
for the 2022-23 California Community School

02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:10.520
Partnership Program or CCSPP for short.

02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:13.080
It's a cohort two implementation grant

02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.960
request for applications.

02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:18.800
And the anticipated due date will be in March of this year.

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:21.040
So again, any day now that should post.

02:06:21.040 --> 02:06:24.200
And I just wanna highlight that this year's RFA

02:06:24.200 --> 02:06:26.400
will require proof of planning,

02:06:26.400 --> 02:06:28.000
which is something we learned and found

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.560
to be very important to ultimate success

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:31.880
of community schools.

02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:33.720
So we encourage all qualifying entities

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:36.080
to apply for this great opportunity.

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:37.520
Thank you, I'll turn it back.

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:39.640
Terrific.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:44.200
And I'm going to just add a little bit more

02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:48.960
on community schools to note that a lot of activity

02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:51.280
is upcoming again, as you know,

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:54.000
in terms of implementation and planning grants,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.760
a formative evaluation RFA, which will be going out soon.

02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:00.920
So we will have ongoing data from the schools

02:07:00.920 --> 02:07:05.920
and the State Transformational Assistance Center

02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.520
is now up and running.

02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.920
They are doing all kinds of helpful work

02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.120
to the field around community schools.

02:07:17.160 --> 02:07:19.520
Every Tuesday, they have a learning collective

02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:20.760
and people can call in.

02:07:20.760 --> 02:07:23.720
There's a time from two to 3.30 where you can call in

02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.000
and be part of any sharing of information,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:30.320
asking of questions, getting guidance.

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:35.240
They have developed a set of webinars as well

02:07:35.240 --> 02:07:38.200
on culturally relevant family and community engagement,

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:40.120
the role of community school leaders,

02:07:40.120 --> 02:07:41.680
building flourishing partnerships.

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.680
They're happening on a monthly basis.

02:07:43.680 --> 02:07:47.240
All of them are recorded and available in archive

02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:49.840
for those who have missed any of them.

02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.560
And I know that there's a lot of enthusiasm

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:56.440
and activity around both the work that schools are doing

02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:58.760
and the work that they would like to do.

02:07:58.760 --> 02:08:03.760
And finally, February 3rd is the 50th anniversary of PACE,

02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:07.760
Policy Analysis for California Education.

02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:09.080
Some of you know about their work.

02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:12.680
They are a consortium of universities across the state

02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:15.040
that have done research on many things,

02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:17.960
including the getting down to facts reports

02:08:17.960 --> 02:08:20.720
and a second round of getting down to facts too

02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:23.440
that led to a lot of the policy

02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.120
that we're now implementing

02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:27.520
around local control funding formula,

02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:29.800
around early childhood education,

02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:32.280
around improvements in the work

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:37.280
of the teacher credentialing and support system.

02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:40.760
And so they're having their 50th anniversary in Sacramento.

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.560
They're doing a conference

02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:46.920
and both Mike Kirsten, I will be there virtually.

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:48.760
He will be there, I think in person

02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:52.840
to reflect on the way in which that work has informed

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.040
the work of the last two administrations

02:08:56.040 --> 02:08:56.880
and the state board.

02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:59.000
So that'll be interesting for those of you

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:02.680
who want to explore historical roots.

02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:05.280
And that concludes my report.

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:09.160
And with that, I think I can hereby adjourn

02:09:09.160 --> 02:09:12.840
the January, 2023 State Board of Education meeting

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.560
at 11 47 a.m.

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:18.080
And I will look forward to seeing you in March.
