35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Rydw i'n edrych ar y cyfleoedd o'r cyfleoedd yma, Mr. Cartwright.

35:29.000 --> 35:38.000
Thank you, Chairman Rogers, and I'd like to join you in welcoming Secretary Gina Raimondo back to our subcommittee.

35:38.000 --> 35:46.000
Madam Secretary, as we all know, it's been an extremely busy two years at the Department of Commerce.

35:46.000 --> 35:55.000
You've been engaging in your ordinary year-to-year responsibilities, everything from census surveys,

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
to export control enforcement, to forecasting severe weather.

36:00.000 --> 36:07.000
The Department is now involved in the massive effort to bring semiconductor production back to the United States,

36:07.000 --> 36:15.000
as provided for in the Chips and Science Act, approved by the last Congress and signed by President Biden.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.000
The Department is also busy implementing funding to help expand high-speed internet access

36:21.000 --> 36:29.000
and to support climate resilience efforts as provided in the IIJA and the Inflation Reduction Act,

36:29.000 --> 36:33.000
also both approved by the last Congress.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.000
In the middle of all of this, I was overjoyed to welcome you to my district in Northeastern Pennsylvania.

36:39.000 --> 36:48.000
We had some very productive discussions, and Pittston's own mayor, Mike Lombardo, is one of your top fans at this point.

36:48.000 --> 36:55.000
The President's Fiscal Year 2024 Budget is the subject of today's hearing.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
You have a request of $12.1 billion for the Department of Commerce.

36:59.000 --> 37:03.000
It represents an increase of $1.1 billion, or just over 10%,

37:03.000 --> 37:10.000
for what are important and diverse missions of the Department of Commerce,

37:10.000 --> 37:18.000
all of them critical for the quality of life of the American people and American competitiveness in the world.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
Your department plays an important role to help strengthen and secure our supply chains,

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
which we became painfully aware of during the pandemic,

37:30.000 --> 37:35.000
and you help keep American businesses successful in the global trade market.

37:35.000 --> 37:42.000
I'm pleased that your request includes strong funding increases for the Economic Development Administration,

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
as well as the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, which we discussed in Pittston,

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
to help create jobs and economic opportunity and to strengthen our nation's manufacturing base.

37:56.000 --> 38:04.000
Among many other initiatives, this request includes strong funding for investments in next-generation weather satellites

38:04.000 --> 38:12.000
to help provide more accurate weather forecasting that American citizens and American businesses rely on,

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
as well as a strong funding increase for the Bureau of Industry and Security

38:16.000 --> 38:23.000
to help expand its capacity for export enforcement, both domestically and overseas,

38:23.000 --> 38:30.000
in order to prevent sensitive dual-use technologies from falling into the wrong hands.

38:31.000 --> 38:37.000
I am, however, greatly concerned that proposals by many in Congress,

38:37.000 --> 38:47.000
and there are voices out there talking about as much as 22% decreases in funding for departments across the board,

38:47.000 --> 38:55.000
those calls for slashes in funding and discretionary spending will greatly damage the efforts that I just mentioned.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
I look forward to discussing these issues at this hearing,

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
and I thank you, Madam Secretary, for joining us and providing us your testimony.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.000
Let me now recognize Ranking Member DeLauro for her opening statement.

39:11.000 --> 39:16.000
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, to you, Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Cartwright.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
Really, I'm happy to be here at this very critical hearing.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
Thank you, Secretary Raimondo, for being here today.

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
When you took office two years ago, our nation was facing an economic crisis.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
But with your leadership and the help of this committee,

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
we have made great strides to strengthen our supply chains to make our economy stronger and more competitive,

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
invest in economic development of our communities,

39:39.000 --> 39:45.000
and to help the U.S. in its manufacturers and small businesses to be able to grow, to be able to thrive.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.000
To build on this success, President Biden proposed a budget

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
that meets the needs of families and communities all across America.

39:52.000 --> 39:59.000
I'm particularly pleased to see a proposed 56% increase for the Economic Development Administration, EDA.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
Fostering equity and opportunity for Americans, regardless of zip code or background,

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
is one of the most important duties of this subcommittee.

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
And the funding proposed for EDA would make innovation more geographically and more racially diverse

40:14.000 --> 40:20.000
and create good jobs for underserved and vulnerable communities that need them.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
I'm also pleased that the budget proposes a 58% increase for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program,

40:27.000 --> 40:35.000
which helps small and medium-sized U.S. manufacturers create and preserve jobs to help them thrive in the global economy.

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
To make our economy even more competitive, Congress met the moment.

40:40.000 --> 40:46.000
And past the Chips and Science Act last year, let me say a thank you to you and to your staff

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
for all of the work that was done on this effort and all the work that you are doing,

40:51.000 --> 40:59.000
including through the budget request to ensure that the impact of Chips and Science is actualized.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
This is critical to strengthening our supply chain.

41:02.000 --> 41:08.000
But to do so, we must also take action to safeguard our national security and supply chain resiliency.

41:08.000 --> 41:14.000
I was pleased to see the International Trade Administration's budget proposes increased funding

41:14.000 --> 41:20.000
to assist the Treasury Department in the establishment of an outbound investment review mechanism,

41:20.000 --> 41:27.000
similar to proposals I outlined in my bipartisan National Critical Capabilities Defense Act.

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
This would ensure we can quickly address vulnerabilities and prevent offshoring of production capacity

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
and intellectual property to foreign adversaries.

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
Before I conclude, I must mention how worried I am that much of the progress I spoke about

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
can very well be at risk because of some of my Republican colleagues

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
and what they have called for, extreme cuts to government funding.

41:54.000 --> 42:02.000
And yesterday on Wall Street, Speaker McCarthy reiterated his intent and others' intent to cut back funding

42:02.000 --> 42:10.000
to a 2022 level and to lock in that austerity with caps for the next 10 years.

42:10.000 --> 42:18.000
But make no mistake, caps are just another name for more cuts. Caps, in fact, are cuts.

42:18.000 --> 42:25.000
As you mentioned in your letter to me on the impacts of these cuts, they would set our success back.

42:26.000 --> 42:34.000
This kind of movement was reiterated by a very esteemed think tank,

42:34.000 --> 42:42.000
the Heritage Foundation, which I know a number of my colleagues look into and look to for direction.

42:42.000 --> 42:48.000
And what Heritage has suggested with regard to commerce is to eliminate the Commerce Department's

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
Economic Development Administration, eliminate the Commerce Department's Minority Business Development Agency,

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
eliminate Commerce's Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership,

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
and cut and cap funding for the National Science Foundation.

43:02.000 --> 43:09.000
These cuts would endanger our national security by reducing our efforts to enforce export controls,

43:09.000 --> 43:14.000
including those that keep goods and sensitive defense technologies away from our adversaries.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
They would weaken our economic competitiveness by reducing our capacity to promote trade and investment

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
and, if implemented, the programs that create stronger communities

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
and better paying jobs across the nation would be dramatically reduced.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
And initiatives to prepare for disasters and to adapt to a changing climate would be drastically cut.

43:34.000 --> 43:40.000
The economic well-being of our communities cannot become victim to these efforts.

43:40.000 --> 43:47.000
I, like you and this committee, will fight to continue strengthening our economy,

43:47.000 --> 43:54.000
and we look forward to hearing from you, Secretary Raimondo, on the funding that you need to do so to keep our economy strong.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
With that, let me just say a thank you to you, Chairman Rogers, and to Ranking Member Cartwright. I yield back.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Thank the Ranking Member.

44:02.000 --> 44:09.000
We're pleased now to welcome to our subcommittee hearing Secretary Raimondo.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
You're recognized for an opening statement.

44:13.000 --> 44:18.000
Without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record.

44:18.000 --> 44:26.000
I hope that you can keep your statement to five minutes or so, so we can have additional time for questions.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
You're now recognized. Welcome.

44:28.000 --> 44:35.000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you, Chairman Rogers, for presiding over this hearing.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Ranking Member Cartwright, it was wonderful to be with you in Pittston,

44:38.000 --> 44:41.000
and thank you, Ranking Member DeLauro, for making the time to be here.

44:41.000 --> 44:48.000
To members of the subcommittee, thank you for being here and thank you for giving me this opportunity to have a fulsome discussion,

44:48.000 --> 44:57.000
and I hope to answer all of your questions with respect to President Biden's fiscal year 2024 budget request for the Department of Commerce.

44:57.000 --> 45:04.000
Echoing much of what has been said, I would like to begin by saying that thanks to your hard work

45:04.000 --> 45:11.000
and thanks to the major investments from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Bipartisan Chips and Science Act,

45:11.000 --> 45:18.000
and your support throughout the appropriations process, the Commerce Department is hard at work

45:18.000 --> 45:28.000
and operating on all cylinders to create jobs, improve economic conditions, and secure America's national security for all Americans.

45:28.000 --> 45:35.000
Our goal is to make sure that America is well positioned to continue its leadership.

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
Everything we do with the Department of Commerce is designed to enhance America's ability to compete.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
From the smallest companies to the biggest, we want to compete to allow America to lead in the world,

45:47.000 --> 45:56.000
and I'm here today to ask you to build on those investments in fiscal year 2024 so that we can keep the momentum going,

45:56.000 --> 46:03.000
continue to invest in American businesses, American communities, and American workers so that we can lead the world.

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
President Biden requests $12.3 billion in discretionary funding and $4 billion in mandatory funding for the Department.

46:11.000 --> 46:18.000
In the interest of time and respectfully, Chairman, I'll just highlight a few of the requests.

46:18.000 --> 46:23.000
My full written testimony obviously will go into the details,

46:23.000 --> 46:31.000
but there is a focus in investing in manufacturing, innovation, and resilient supply chains.

46:31.000 --> 46:42.000
It calls for $1.6 billion to support the work of NIST, including $277 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which has been referenced.

46:42.000 --> 46:49.000
The funding will enable these MEP centers to expand coordination with the private sector,

46:49.000 --> 46:56.000
to narrow the gaps in supply chains, and to enable especially small and medium-sized manufacturers

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
to adopt critical technologies which will help them be more resilient.

47:01.000 --> 47:07.000
The budget provides for $98 million to expand NIST's role in Manufacturing USA,

47:07.000 --> 47:14.000
including $60 million in new competitive awards to enable existing Manufacturing USA institutes

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
to promote domestic production of institute-developed technologies.

47:20.000 --> 47:29.000
And it proposes $700 million for ITA, including $26 million to establish a Supply Chain Resiliency Office

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
to proactively identify and mitigate supply chain risks.

47:34.000 --> 47:41.000
It also increases funding to SelectUSA to attract foreign domestic investment.

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
Fel wedi'i cymryd, ar gyfer mlynedd o amrygain, y pandemig oedd unrhyw beth yw'r cyfansoddiadau economaidd

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
sydd wedi'i ddechrau eu cyfansoddiadau, eu ffamiliau, a'u gweithredu eu gweithredu.

47:53.000 --> 48:01.000
Yn ogystal â'r byd, mae gennym gysylltiadau sy'n gweithredu gyda gysylltiadau gweithredu a'u gweithredu i helpu y cyfansoddiadau.

48:01.000 --> 48:06.000
Yn ogystal â hynny, mae'r budget yn gweithredu $4 miliwn yn gweithredu gynllun,

48:06.000 --> 48:13.000
a $50 miliwn yn gysylltuadau dysgrifiaethol i'r EDA i gysylltu cymdeithasol, technoleg, a chyfansoddiadau gynllun,

48:13.000 --> 48:17.000
i gysylltu gyfansoddiadau geograffig a chyfansoddiadau.

48:17.000 --> 48:28.000
Mae'n cynnwys $200 miliwn i'r progrwm Pilot Recompeat i gynllunio grantau i'r cyfansoddiadau sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiadau sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiadau sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiad sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiad sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiad sy'n bwysig.

48:29.000 --> 48:39.000
Mae'n cynnwys $100 miliwn i'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol, sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol a $100 miliwn i'r MBDA.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Felly rydw i'n cysylltu â'r hyn.

48:41.000 --> 48:50.000
Yn y ffyrdd o ffyrdd, rydw i wedi gysylltu'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol sy'n bwysig i'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol o'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol o'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol o'r cyfansoddiadau cymdeithasol.

48:50.000 --> 49:20.000
Mae'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r ffaith yw'r f

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
a ddod o'r cwestiwnau y gallwch chi gyd. Thank you.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
We will now proceed under the five-minute rule for questions.

49:29.000 --> 49:34.000
I'll begin by recognizing myself.

49:37.000 --> 49:42.000
Madam Secretary, the Department of Commerce plays a critical role

49:42.000 --> 49:46.000
in promoting economic growth and job creation.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
From promoting trade and investment to protecting intellectual property

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
and supporting scientific research,

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
the department's work is essential to our nation's prosperity.

50:00.000 --> 50:07.000
What key initiatives in the 24-budget request will have the greatest impact

50:07.000 --> 50:13.000
on the department's overall mission of promoting economic growth and job creation?

50:13.000 --> 50:18.000
In addition, how will the department ensure that these funds

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
are being used effectively and efficiently,

50:22.000 --> 50:29.000
and what metrics or indicators will be used to measure the success of these investments?

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Many of the increases proposed in your budget request

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
are for programs that received supplemental funding.

50:38.000 --> 50:47.000
How will the 24 request build on the support that Congress has already provided?

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Thank you for the question, Chairman Rogers.

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
Let me say I want to thank you—we've talked about this in the past—for your consistent support of EDA.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
My short answer to your question is all of the programs,

51:01.000 --> 51:05.000
but I want to focus specifically on a few in the EDA,

51:05.000 --> 51:11.000
because I think they're particularly vital at this moment in time, given what our economy needs.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
First of all, the tech hubs.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
The omnibus included enough for a pilot in the tech hubs.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
The budget asks for additional money in tech hubs.

51:20.000 --> 51:24.000
There is innovation all across this country,

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
not just in Boston, Silicon Valley, and New York City,

51:28.000 --> 51:34.000
and we need to invest in communities all around America to tap into that innovation.

51:34.000 --> 51:37.000
We need to do that to create jobs in those communities,

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
but frankly we need to do that in order to compete in the world.

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
Success will mean communities all around the country

51:48.000 --> 51:53.000
that have universities or companies that have leading-edge technology

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
or research and development in any area where we invest in them

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
so that they can flourish and create jobs in those communities.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
I could include a new initiative called re-compete,

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
which I referenced in my opening statement,

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
which is a place-based economic development

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
focused on communities that are the most distressed.

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
Every one of you has some community in your state

52:17.000 --> 52:22.000
that is chronically distressed and who都有 cael سwyth iawn.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
We can't leave them behind.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
I know in Kentucky you have these communities,

52:27.000 --> 52:32.000
mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny, ac felly mae hynny'n ymwneud â gweithredu economaidd ymlaen,

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
lle mae'n rhaid i ni helpu i'w gysylltu mewn beth maen nhw'n dda,

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
i weithredu pobl ar gyfer cyfansoddiadau heddiw a morfod,

52:39.000 --> 52:44.000
ac yn y ffordd hynny, byddwn yn helpu America i ddod ymlaen,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
i ddod eu cyfansoddiadau, a dydw i'n meddwl,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
bod y cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac equal.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Mae'r cyfansoddiadau hynny'n bwysig ac ac equal.

Rwy'n glir bod y gweithwyr ymddiriedig wedi'i ddweud o'r Aelodau Aelodau, oherwydd bod y Prif Weinidog o'r Aelodau Aelodau Aelodau wedi'i ddweud y bydd y cysylltiadau'r amgylcheddau'r CCP'r amgylcheddau'n dweud nad oes biliadau o ddollars i helpu cymdeithas ymgylchedd cymdeithas, gyda'r amgylcheddau y byddai'r ddollars nid yw'r amgylcheddau'r cymdeithas o'r cymdeithas o'r cymdeithas yng Nghymru.

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:46.600
Felly, roeddwn i'n ddweud i chi, y text y Llywodraethau o'r Chips Act yn dweud y bydd cymdeithas ymgylcheddau'r amgylcheddau yn cael y pwynt o'r amgylcheddau o'r amgylcheddau yn cymdeithas gyda'r amgylcheddau cymdeithasol a'r amgylcheddau cymdeithasol cymdeithasol a'i gynnwys cymdeithas ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylcheddau cymdeithasol ymgylchedd

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:03.580
C slightly chi'n fawd i fesial y cymdeithasol.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:12.580
o gynnyddio'r cyfansoddiadau y 2022 i'r cyfansoddiad y 2024.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:18.580
Ac roeddwn i'n siŵr am EDA a sut y byddwn i'n fwyaf y byddai'r Prif Weinidog

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:20.580
wedi cael gwybodaeth yng Nghymru.

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:26.580
Ond mae'r Prif Weinidog wedi'u cymryd at y cwestiwn

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:37.580
am beth y byddai'r cyfansoddiadau o'r 2022 yn ymwneud â'r cyfansoddiad $155 miliwn

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.580
ar gyfer gynnydd o'r EDA.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.580
Beth yw'r amser ar gyfer cyfansoddiadau os yw hynny'n digwydd?

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:59.580
Felly rydw i'n cael ei ddweud, mae'r EDA yn rhywbeth y byddwn i'n meddwl.

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.580
Mae'n dda gyda'r MBDA, oherwydd rydw i wedi'i gweld ymlaen.

Rydyn ni'n credu y byddwn ni'n rhaid i'w wneud yw

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920
ddechrau'r amser hwn

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.920

Rwy'n mynd i ddweud, ac mae'r ysgol yn gallu'i ddeall,

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920

yn unrhyw amgylchedd

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.920
Why aren't we updating the entity list

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920
and denied person lists

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.920
and putting more pressure on China

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.920
like we would do with, say, Iran

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920
with a maximum pressure mindset?

01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.920
Can you give me your perspective

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.920
either your personal perspective

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.920
where can we get better?

01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.920
China is eating our lunch

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.920
literally and figuratively

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.920
and we feel like we're passive

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.920
You said the BIS needs to be

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920
as aggressive as possible

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.920
but we're not actually being as aggressive as possible right now

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.920
so I'd just like to get your perspective on that

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.920
Can I answer?

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.920
Look, let me say this

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:12.920
If you have ideas

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.920
about how we can be more aggressive

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:16.920
I'm happy to take a meeting anytime

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.920
but in the time I've been

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.920
Commerce Secretary

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.920
I've put over 200 Chinese entities

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.920
on the entity list

01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:26.920
More than a quarter of the Chinese entities

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:28.920
on the list were put there by us

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:30.920
Last October, we did

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.920
something this country's never done before

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.920
in the breadth and depth

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.920
of the semiconductor controls that we made

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:38.920
as applied to the entire country

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.920
of China

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.920
We've amped up enforcement

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920
and every day we are on it

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:48.920
to try to be

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.920
as aggressive as possible

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.920
to make sure that China doesn't get our technologies

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.920
to advance their military

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.920
I would just say that

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.920
Having said that

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.920
look, it's a constant battle

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:04.920
like it is a daily battle

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.920
Right now, the trade rep

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.920
Ambassador Tai

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:10.920
is conducting the review

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.920
of the 301

01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.920
which was focused on IP

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.920
and so the point you make

01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.920
is an excellent one

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.920
We should have zero tolerance for China ripping off

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.920
American IP and hurting American businesses

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.920
so we are constantly looking

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.920
at ways that we can protect American businesses

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920
and make sure they play by the rules

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.920
Let me be clear, we can outcompete China

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920
if they play by the rules

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.920
and so ensuring a level playing field

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.920
is a top priority of ours

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.920
and you'll be happy to have a further discussion

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.920
I think reciprocal trade is the key amount of time

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.920
but I'll take you up on that offer, we'd love to sit down

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.920
We have a lot of good ideas, we just need to be more aggressive

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.920
Thank you

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.920
Mrs. Meng

01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.920
Thank you Mr. Chairman

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.920
and thank you Madam Secretary for being here

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.920
and for your great work

01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:56.920
and for literally travelling around the country

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.920
continuing to find ways

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.920
to invest in the American people

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.920
I also wanted to ask about

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.920
the potential

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.920
proposed cuts

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:10.920
of either fiscal year

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:12.920
return to fiscal year 2022 levels

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.920
or a 22%

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.920
reduction, both of whom

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:18.920
we've heard from the majority

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.920
If there were these proposed cuts

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.920
I wanted to ask you

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.920
about the potential

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:28.920
impact in two

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.920
specific areas

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.920
one is on our national security

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:34.920
there's been a lot of

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.920
talk today and of course

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.920
concern about national security

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:40.920
including

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920
making sure that we are keeping sensitive

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.920
goods and technology out

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.920
of the hands of our adversaries

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.920
and if we are serious

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:50.920
about being aggressive

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.920
and serious about being proactive

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.920
and keeping and making sure

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920
that America is first

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:58.920
like I tell my teenage son

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.920
it's not always about just

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.920
criticising the adversary

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:04.920
or an opponent's weaknesses

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.920
but seeing how we can put

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.920
ourselves on a higher ground

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.920
making us

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.920
more competitive

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.920
to put us first

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.920
so number one, I wanted to know

01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.920
how potential cuts would impact

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.920
advances in national security

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.920
and two, I wanted to

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.920
ask about potential cuts and their impact

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.920
on American jobs and

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.920
economic competitiveness

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.920
would cuts

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:32.920
weaken our nation's

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.920
economic competitiveness

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:36.920
would it affect America's

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:38.920
ability to maintain

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.920
and increase the number

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:42.920
of American jobs throughout this

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.920
country?

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.920
So first let me say I have a 16 year old son

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.920
so if you have any guidance on that

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.920
I'd be happy to get it

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:52.920
I think yes

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.920
is what I

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920
feel

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.920
we have been consistently

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920
making investments in

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.920
our supply chain, in research and

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.920
development, in manufacturing

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:06.920
and we're starting to see the benefit of that

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.920
manufacturing jobs are coming back

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.920
supply chain is coming back to America

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.920
you know

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.920
coal communities and forgotten communities

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.920
manufacturing communities

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.920
like the one I'm from

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.920
are being revitalized

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.920
the investments in

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920
BIS

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:26.920
you know the congressman's

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.920
you make an excellent point

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.920
which is to say we have to be

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:32.920
vigilant on this

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.920
if we don't have the enforcement agents

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.920
we won't be able to do

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.920
our job effectively

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.920
if we don't have enough analysts we won't be able to do

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:42.920
our job effectively

01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.920
with respect to

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.920
BIS so I think that

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.920
look at what we did with Russia

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:50.920
very quickly

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.920
we got a coalition of over 39

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.920
countries together

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.920
since then we've put more than 500

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.920
Russian entities on the entity list

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:00.920
we've stopped hundreds of millions of dollars

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:02.920
of technology

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.920
going into Russia

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.920
we wouldn't have been able

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.920
to do any of that if we didn't have

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.920
the funding so

01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:12.920
I don't know

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.920
yes I think it would have an impact

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.920
and our ability to compete, our ability to invest

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.920
and our

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.920
job creation

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.920
Thank you and I wanted to

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.920
also quickly ask about

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920
potential cuts with the census

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.920
I know that we are far away from the next

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.920
census but as you know

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.920
fiscal year 2024 is the last

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:36.920
year in the Census

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.920
Bureau's exploration of design

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.920
innovations leading up to the selection

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:42.920
of an operational design for the next

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.920
census. The budget request

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.920
for the Bureau is 1.6 billion

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.920
with 409 million for the

01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.920
census preparation

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.920
last year I had expressed my

01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.920
concern to you about under

01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.920
counting America's children

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:58.920
and I am still concerned that

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:00.920
potential budget cuts would impact

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.920
the research that you are doing that would allow

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.920
the most effective, innovative and secure

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.920
methods of data collection

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.920
from being pursued

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:10.920
Madam Secretary, can you

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.920
discuss what the impact on the preparation

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.920
for the census would be if there

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:16.920
were cuts?

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.920
So although 2030 seems like a long

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.920
time away, the census

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:22.920
Bureau right now has more than 50

01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.920
research projects ongoing

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.920
to improve the way we collect

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.920
the data

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:30.920
I should say that everything

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.920
about the census should be apolitical

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.920
database, fact based and

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.920
we rely on the experts

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.920
so they have 50

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.920
research projects going on now

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:42.920
this is a very important year

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.920
we have called

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.920
for investments in

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.920
IT, research, design

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.920
to make sure that we get the most

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.920
accurate information about how many

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.920
Americans there are, how many

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.920
people we have living in America and how

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:58.920
they live their lives

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.920
so yes,

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.920
I think it's fair to say

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.920
that we would be less accurate

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.920
in 2030 if we weren't able to make

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:08.920
the investments necessary to

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.920
do that collection properly

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:12.920
Thank you, I yield back

01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.920
Mr. Clyde

01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.920
Thank you Mr. Chairman

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:20.920
Secretary

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.920
Raimondo, thank you for being here today

01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:24.920
and to discuss

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.920
the Department of Commerce's fiscal year

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.920
2024 budget request

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:30.920
from your request summary

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.920
I see that the Department is asking for

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.920
$12.3 billion this fiscal year

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:36.920
an 11% increase

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.920
over FY23 enacted

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:40.920
that's a fair bit of money

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.920
Do you believe

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:44.920
the Department of Commerce

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.920
should receive or spend unauthorized

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.920
funds?

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.920
I mean

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.920
I would leave it to Congress

01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:54.920
to decide what

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.920
to authorize and appropriate

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.920
what I can tell you is

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.920
we are using

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.920
and spending and investing the appropriated

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:04.920
money in accordance with Congress's

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:06.920
intent

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.920
What is your department's current spending authorization?

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.920
I'll have to get you the

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.920
number, I'll get back to you

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.920
So you don't know

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:18.920
Not off the top of my head, no

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.920
So you came today to request $12.3

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920
billion from the American taxpayers

01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.920
yet you don't know if and how much

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.920
you're legally authorized to have

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:28.920
I'm sure my team

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.920
could tell me in a second

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.920
Okay

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.920
Well, according to the Congressional Budget Office

01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.920
and this committee's

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.920
fiscal year 2023 report

01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:42.920
many of the department's bureaus and programs

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:44.920
are currently not authorized

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.920
some for more than decades

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.920
Let me give you an example

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.920
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.920
has not been completely authorized

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.920
since 1992

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:58.920
The National Weather Service since 1993

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.920
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:02.920
1993

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.920
The Bureau of Industry and Security

01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:06.920
1994

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.920
The Economic Development Administration 2008

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:10.920
and the National Institute of Standards

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.920
and Technology

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.920
since 2013

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.920
So you've been the secretary for two years

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:18.920
Were you aware of these

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.920
expired authorizations prior to

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.920
submitting the 2024 budget request?

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.920
As I said

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.920
We

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:28.920
This is in

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.920
I respect Congress's authority

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.920
It's up to Congress to decide what's authorized

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.920
what to appropriate and how to make those decisions

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.920
My job

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:38.920
and I am faithfully undertaking that

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.920
is to

01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:42.920
administer appropriated monies

01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:44.920
consistent with the law

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.920
with transparency

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.920
and accountability to

01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:50.920
taxpayers

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:52.920
In Congress we have authorizing committees

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.920
and we have appropriating

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.920
We have one appropriating committee, this one

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.920
and we have 18 or 19 authorizing committees

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:00.920
and every department

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.920
of the federal government has an authorizing

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.920
committee that authorizes its

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:06.920
use or that authorizes

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.920
whether it exists

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.920
legally authorizes it

01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:12.920
Okay

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.920
and I'm

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:16.920
puzzled as to why the Department of

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.920
Commerce has not requested authorization

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.920
from the authorizing committees

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.920
As I said

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:26.920
we could take that up with the

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.920
authorizing committees

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.920
That would be great, that would be the energy and commerce

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920
committee and potentially the science

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.920
space and technology committee I guess

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.920
Your department is broken

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.920
down through both authorizing

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.920
That's what happens when you cover

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.920
everything from fish to space

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.920
I get it

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.920
So

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.920
So do you think

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.920
it's not your responsibility

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.920
to go get an authorization from Congress?

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.920
It's never my responsibility

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.920
to tell Congress what to do

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.920
My responsibility is to

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.920
carry out my job

01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.920
in the confines of Congress's intent

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:04.920
which is what we're doing

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:06.920
Okay, well

01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:08.920
I know that I'm new to the appropriations

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920
committee but

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.920
I've been learning the processes of it

01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920
and I just want to ensure

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.920
that there's proper oversight

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.920
and accountability are afforded to

01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.920
the federal responsibilities into tax

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.920
dollar expenditures

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.920
I know past appropriators may not

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.920
have strictly adhered to this process

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.920
but this majority came

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.920
in on a commitment to regular order

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.920
and regular order means

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.920
that you have an authorization

01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.920
and then you appropriate

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.920
to that authorization

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.920
If you do not have an authorization how can you

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.920
appropriate to something that doesn't exist?

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:46.920
Once again that to me is in

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.920
Congress's jurisdiction and

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.920
so I'll leave it to you and your colleagues to

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:52.920
sort through

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.920
those issues. Well I hope

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.920
that you will take this then and go to the

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.920
appropriate authorizing committees

01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:00.920
and request the appropriate

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.920
authorizations because it's

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.920
going to be difficult to support

01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.920
an appropriation without an authorization

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:08.920
Thank you

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:10.920
Thank you and I yield back. Mr.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.920
Ruffersberger

01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:18.920
Okay secretary first thing

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.920
thank you for being here from

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.920
where I sit I think

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:24.920
you've done a good job you have a lot of

01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.920
different issues you have to deal with

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:28.920
We've been very supportive

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.920
of building our semiconductor

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.920
computer chips

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.920
and I'm concerned

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.920
that we have not

01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.920
we don't have the workforce

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:40.920
to go where we need to

01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:42.920
go. In an

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.920
article you said that we simply will

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.920
not be successful in achieving

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.920
the national security goals of

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:50.920
the chips initiatives unless we

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920
invest in our workforce period

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.920
and full stop

01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:56.920
you said for decades we've taken

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.920
our eye off the ball with manufacturing

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.920
which means that worker

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.920
supply of people with

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.920
the skills to do super technical manufacturing

01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:06.920
has withered and so

01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:08.920
we need to be honest about it

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.920
but also embrace it as an opportunity

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:12.920
to come up with creative

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.920
solutions. To that

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.920
end the commerce department is asking every

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:18.920
company buying for a share of

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.920
39 billion in direct funding

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.920
for semiconductor manufacturing to

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.920
develop and outline plans for how

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.920
they plan to build a skilled and diverse

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.920
workforce including by working

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.920
with high schools and community

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.920
colleges. Can you tell us

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.920
more on where we need to build the workforce

01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.920
both on the government side and the commercial side?

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.920
Yes, thank you.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.920
Real quickly too because I

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.920
have a space question.

01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.920
Okay, well

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.920
I'll say it.

01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:48.920
Right before coming here I was

01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.920
at a semiconductor event with Senator

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:52.920
Young talking about this topic. It was

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.920
hosted by Purdue. The industry

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:56.920
estimates that there's

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:58.920
a hundred thousand

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:00.920
semiconductor there'll be a hundred thousand semiconductor

01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.920
technicians short

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:04.920
in the next few years and those are

01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:06.920
non-college degree jobs

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.920
if we don't train more.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.920
They also estimate that they're very short

01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.920
of PhD engineers and

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.920
chemists.

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.920
So my point

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:18.920
in making those comments is that

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:20.920
it's not enough to build

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:22.920
the buildings. You need to have people who have

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.920
the skills to do the job and

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:26.920
right now given our very low unemployment

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:28.920
rate that is a challenge. So we have

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.920
to think creatively. By the way it's also

01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.920
true for building facilities.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:34.920
The unemployment rate in the building

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:36.920
trades is

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:38.920
in some states zero.

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:40.920
Full employment. Every one of these

01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.920
facilities will take between five and ten thousand building

01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:44.920
trades to build for years.

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:46.920
So my point is that we have

01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.920
to get and those are non-college degree jobs

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.920
working with high schools and apprenticeship

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:52.920
programs, figuring out ways to tap

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.920
communities

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.920
that haven't previously been in the business

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920
of the building trade. So long story short

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.920
I have a sense

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.920
of urgency about training people

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:04.920
because it's necessary to meet the mission.

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.920
Okay. I'm going

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:08.920
to switch to space real quick.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920
I'd like to ask you about the growing problem

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920
of orbital debris

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:14.920
and how it relates to the efforts

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:16.920
of the office of space commerce.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:18.920
The Russians last year tested

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.920
an anti-seattle

01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.920
satellite missile.

01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.920
They created a debris field that was so

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.920
big it threatened the safety

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.920
operations of our international space station.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.920
These are thousands of active

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.920
satellites. There are

01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:34.920
tens of thousands of space debris ranging

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.920
from nuts and bolts to old rocket

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.920
stages and all of them can cause

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:40.920
damage. The office of space commerce

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.920
is charged with protecting the space

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:44.920
services

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:46.920
that are critical to our nation's infrastructure

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.920
sustaining US

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:50.920
space sector leadership

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.920
globally and international space

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.920
cooperation.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.920
What are your quick thoughts

01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.920
on the growing problem of orbital debris

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.920
as well as the growing

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:02.920
congestion due to a large

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.920
consolation?

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920
Please talk about China as well.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:08.920
Yeah. So my quick thoughts

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:10.920
are that it is a problem

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.920
and it is a growing problem. I mean the good

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.920
news is that there's more

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.920
commercial opportunities in space.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.920
We're innovating more and so there are more

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:20.920
satellites. The

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.920
problem is, as you say, it's

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.920
congested. There's much more opportunity

01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.920
for collisions, much more opportunity

01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:28.920
for

01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.920
mal intent,

01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:34.920
stealing information and

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:36.920
such. So what we are doing,

01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:38.920
a few things quickly. One

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.920
is we're asking for increased funding, which we

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.920
got last year. We're asking for more this year

01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:44.920
to have our space tracking

01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:46.920
system. I

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.920
think of it as air traffic control for

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.920
space, which is to say we need to

01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:52.920
know what's going on, what's available

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.920
to cut down on the collisions. And so

01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:56.920
we're investing in that. We've

01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:58.920
increased the staff

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:00.920
by 75 percent at space

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.920
commerce. We've put a

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:04.920
new director in, Rich Dalbello,

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.920
who's excellent. We've elevated space

01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.920
commerce from lower in

01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:10.920
NOAA to higher up and giving

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.920
it more attention. I'd be happy

01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:14.920
to have Deputy Secretary Graves come and sit

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:16.920
with you because he's focused on this.

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:18.920
The bottom line is it's a problem.

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:20.920
It's going to get worse as you see

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:22.920
more commercial space

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.920
activities. China and

01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.920
Russia are both a problem

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.920
and so we need a much better system

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:30.920
which we're building, which we think will be operational

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.920
by the end of fiscal year 24

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.920
to have a better sense

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.920
of what's happening in orbit.

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.920
Thank you. I yield back.

01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:40.920
Mr. Adderholt.

01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:44.920
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:46.920
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.920
I just wanted to ask

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.920
about the steel and aluminum

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:52.920
232 tariff.

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:54.920
I understand we face

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.920
October 2023 deadline

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920
to conclude negotiations

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.920
on the global arrangement

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.920
on sustainable steel

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.920
and aluminum. And

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.920
I also understand that both

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:08.920
sides have now exchanged initial

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:10.920
concept papers.

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.920
But it appears that there is fundamental

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.920
differences between the proposed

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.920
proposal that's been put forward

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.920
by the Biden administration

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.920
and also the response from the

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.920
European Commission.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.920
Given the differences

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:26.920
that are

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.920
apparent at this point,

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:30.920
what is your assessment of

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.920
the prospects for concluding an agreement

01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920
before the date

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920
of October 23,

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920
2023

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:40.920
to possibly

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:42.920
get some kind of

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.920
negotiation finalized?

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.920
Yeah. A couple of things.

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:48.920
Ambassador Tai and the

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.920
USTR are the

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.920
lead in this negotiation.

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.920
But I am

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:56.920
aware of it. In fact,

01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.920
I was just meeting with the trade

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:00.920
minister from the EU. We'll be

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.920
headed over to Sweden

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.920
in June

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:06.920
to continue to make progress

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:08.920
on this. I would say

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.920
that we're hopeful to hit the

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.920
deadline and we're making progress.

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.920
We still have many months to go.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.920
But as a long-term solution, I think

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.920
it's the right solution.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:20.920
So Ambassador

01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:22.920
Tai is closer to it than

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.920
I am, but it's a priority.

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920
And the Europeans

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920
are working with us constructively

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.920
to try to have it

01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.920
resolved.

01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.920
What are

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920
your options if, for some

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920
reason, it's not

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.920
an agreement that's not reached by that

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.920
date?

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.920
You know, I think we need to operate

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.920
as though we will. And so I'm

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.920
going to

01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.920
the administration's going to work.

01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.920
There's always an

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.920
option to continue going after October.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.920
But I think

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:58.920
everyone is focused on having that

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.920
happen.

01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:02.920
It sets the right incentive

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.920
structure

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.920
to have more green

01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.920
steel and aluminum.

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:10.920
And, you know,

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.920
the problem with steel and aluminum is

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920
China has been flooding the market

01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.920
with excess capacity

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:18.920
and cheap, dirty

01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:20.920
steel and aluminum. And so this is the best

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:22.920
tool, we think, to

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.920
prevent that. So I think our

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:26.920
goal is to have it done.

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.920
Do you anticipate that

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.920
the Section 232 tariff could be

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.920
reimposed on imports

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.920
from EU member countries?

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920
That we don't, you know,

01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:38.920
I'm not going to go there because I'm going to

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.920
choose to focus on

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.920
hitting the deadline and getting it done.

01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.920
It was

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.920
I was in the middle of the

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.920
negotiation to

01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.920
adjust the

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.920
tariffs and I don't think we want to go back

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.920
to that.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:56.920
Let me switch over to

01:39:56.920 --> 01:39:58.920
situation with

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:00.920
weather situation. So far in

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.920
2023, we've seen a real

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.920
alarming amount of deadly

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.920
destructive tornadoes rip through

01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.920
the south and especially

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.920
my home state of Alabama.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:12.920
My rural constituents are

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.920
especially vulnerable to tornadoes

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.920
because we have a radar gap

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:18.920
in west Alabama.

01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.920
The severe storms that produce

01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:22.920
deadly tornadoes are typically

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:24.920
low altitude systems that

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.920
evade the legacy

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.920
radar system

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:30.920
and that creates the gap in the coverage.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.920
My colleague from Alabama,

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:34.920
Congresswoman Terry Sewell,

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:36.920
who is my neighbor

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:38.920
to the south, we have, we

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:40.920
had a very productive conversation

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.920
earlier this month with the National

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.920
Weather Service Director King Graham

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:46.920
about this very

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:48.920
issue and

01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.920
we discussed some of the issues

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.920
that we're facing. He committed

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.920
to us in that conversation to work with

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.920
us to find a solution for west Alabama

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.920
until the next generation

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:00.920
radars are installed

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.920
throughout the country. And of course

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:04.920
obviously the next generation radars

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:06.920
will be a while before that will take

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.920
place, but until that takes

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.920
place, you know,

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.920
there is a gap and

01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920
the constituents, our

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.920
constituents in Alabama

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.920
are in that gap

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920
and I guess my

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.920
question to you, would you commit to working

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920
with the director,

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:26.920
Dr. Graham, to find

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920
and rapidly implement

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.920
a solution to resolve this

01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.920
radar gap that potentially

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:34.920
could cause many more deaths in the state

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.920
of Alabama? Absolutely. I did

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:38.920
not know. I was unaware of that gap

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:40.920
and I do

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.920
know how devastating the tornadoes have

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.920
been. In fact, I recently was

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920
on the phone with an employee of the Commerce

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.920
Department in that part

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.920
of the world whose house was destroyed by the

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.920
tornadoes. So I took

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:54.920
note, I will look in on it. The gap,

01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920
the situation with the gap is

01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.920
it's like EF3

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:00.920
and EF4 can be

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:02.920
detected, but EF1 and EF2 cannot

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920
be detected. But as you know, EF1

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.920
and EF2 tornadoes,

01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.920
EF1 and EF2 can be very deadly as

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.920
well. I see. So that's

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:12.920
where the gap is.

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.920
Okay, yes, we'll work with you.

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.920
Congresswoman Sewell and I have been together trying to

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.920
work on this, so we appreciate your commitment

01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.920
to that. Thank you. Yes.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.920
Mr. Morrell.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:26.920
Thank you, Chairman Rogers and

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:28.920
ranking member Kyright for

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:30.920
holding this important hearing and thank you,

01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:32.920
Madam Secretary, for

01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:34.920
not only your service but your leadership

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:36.920
of the department

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.920
and the important work you have and certainly

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:40.920
for joining us here today.

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.920
Last year, I was one of the

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.920
voices calling for significant investment

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.920
in the regional innovation and the CHIPS and Science

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.920
Act, which is something I know that

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:50.920
you've been very, very supportive of

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:52.920
and worked hard on. And the final

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:54.920
bill, as you obviously know,

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920
created the regional technology and

01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.920
innovation hubs that designate and fund

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.920
up to 20 tech hubs of innovation

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.920
under-invested

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.920
in communities and regions

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:06.920
poised to make a leap forward in the innovation economy.

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.920
Excuse me.

01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:10.920
Upstate New York, and I've shared

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.920
this with you before, is an

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.920
excellent example of

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.920
a region poised to make such a

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.920
leap forward. My district,

01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920
which is Rochester, New York, alone is home

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920
to two top-tier research

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.920
universities. It was also identified

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.920
by MIT

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.920
economist Simon Johnson

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.920
and Jonathan Gruber and Jumpstart in America

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:32.920
as the top technology hub candidate

01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920
in the United States. So I'm

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920
certain if the Commerce Department

01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.920
and Congress continue to prioritize tech

01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:40.920
hubs, we can unleash the potential of regions

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:42.920
across the United States and

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:44.920
accelerate the development of dozens of leading-age

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:46.920
technologies,

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:48.920
particularly in underserved regions. I think you

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.920
mentioned the big hubs that tend to attract

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:52.920
a lot of the venture capital money. So

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:54.920
what role would you say

01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:56.920
that the Department

01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:58.920
expect the

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:00.920
tech hubs to play in collaboration

01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.920
with other pieces in the Chips

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:04.920
and Science Act investments? And will

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:06.920
the Department continue to prioritize

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.920
the tech hubs among your other

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.920
CHIPS responsibilities?

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:12.920
Yes, thank you. So

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.920
it is a priority, and we

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.920
will continue to prioritize

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920
it. It all

01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.920
relates to national security

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.920
insofar as we need to tap into

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.920
the technology, know-how,

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:26.920
and research and development that we have in

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.920
this country everywhere that

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:30.920
it exists. I mean, in

01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.920
your world,

01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.920
Rochester Institute of Technology,

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:36.920
other universities,

01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:38.920
upstate New York is filled

01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:40.920
with great

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.920
universities,

01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:44.920
advanced technology,

01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:46.920
and, you know, as I said

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:48.920
before, these great technologies

01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:50.920
don't exist just at MIT,

01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.920
Harvard, and Stanford. So

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:54.920
we have to,

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:56.920
the way we plan to roll this out,

01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:58.920
and we'll be rolling it out shortly,

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:00.920
coming months, is it'll be

01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.920
a competitive process. We're going to

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.920
ask each community to put forward

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.920
a full,

01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:08.920
robust application, getting

01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:10.920
the whole community, you know, public

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.920
sector, private sector, universities,

01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.920
and we

01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:16.920
think, you know, we'll designate 20 or

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:18.920
more tech hubs,

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:20.920
we'll fund, I don't

01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:22.920
know, plus or minus a dozen,

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.920
10, 11, but

01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.920
I hope that's just the beginning, because I know

01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:28.920
there are places

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:30.920
that we should invest in all over this country

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:32.920
to tap into the full potential.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.920
Yeah, and you know

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.920
this better than most, having

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.920
come out of the world, I think something

01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:40.920
90% of the venture capital dollars are in about

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:42.920
five regional communities,

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.920
so that certainly excludes many communities.

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.920
I know that the

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:48.920
Science and

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:50.920
Tech, or the Chips and Science

01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:52.920
Act put the tech hubs at authorization

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:54.920
of 10 billion

01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.920
in the bill. Only 500

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:58.920
million was authorized for appropriation

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:00.920
last

01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:02.920
year, and I wonder if you could just address

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:04.920
if they're not funded

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.920
to a much more appropriate level,

01:46:06.920 --> 01:46:08.920
the missed opportunity there.

01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.920
It's a huge missed opportunity. I mean, with

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.920
500 million,

01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:14.920
I mean, you can do the math

01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:16.920
yourself. I mean, if we were to pick

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:18.920
10, that's only 50

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:20.920
million each, it's actually less than that,

01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:22.920
because we'll need to put some money out for

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:24.920
planning grants and such.

01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:28.920
There's surely more than five

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.920
or ten places around America

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:32.920
that are

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.920
have cutting-edge research. As I said,

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.920
I just came from an event hosted by

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:38.920
Indiana. Amazing

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.920
what they have going on in the heartland

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:42.920
with Purdue and their institutions,

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.920
and I could say that it could go around the table

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.920
here. So, we

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:48.920
need more than

01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:50.920
six, seven, eight, nine, ten

01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:52.920
places, and frankly, they need

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.920
more money to really build this out. If you look

01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.920
at places like, say, Pittsburgh,

01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:58.920
they are now

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:00.920
leading edge in robotics,

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:02.920
but it's taken time

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.920
and a good deal of money

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:06.920
and public-private partnerships. That's

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:08.920
the final thing I'll say. This can't be done

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:10.920
with government alone or government money.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:12.920
Our money has to be a small piece of the pie

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.920
that catalyzes other money,

01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:16.920
private sector, coming

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.920
together, and that's how we're going to judge

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.920
who gets the money, the strength

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.920
of the coalition that's coming together.

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:24.920
Well, thank you again for your leadership.

01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.920
I look forward to continue to work with you,

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.920
and thanks so much, and I yield back, Mr. Chair.

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.920
Mr. Elsie?

01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:32.920
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Madam Secretary.

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:34.920
Do you prefer Madam Secretary or

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.920
Governor? Governor. You do?

01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:38.920
Okay. I don't blame you. All right,

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.920
Governor. Well,

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:42.920
appreciate you asking that. Thank you for being

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:44.920
here. I know that as a

01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:46.920
father of young children that doing this job

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:48.920
and being a parent and father

01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:50.920
is difficult, and so I appreciate the

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920
time that you've dedicated in service to your nation

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.920
and to your state. Same to you.

01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.920
I appreciate you saying that. Thank you very much. We have Rugby in

01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.920
Common. I don't know, I don't think you were front

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.920
line, but I'm sure you were an outstanding

01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.920
back. I was a scrum half. Okay.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.920
I'm sure you're very good at it. Not

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:06.920
really, but. Listen, I just

01:48:06.920 --> 01:48:08.920
wanted to talk about something that's really important

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.920
to the voters of District 6 in Texas,

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.920
just south of Dallas,

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:14.920
a largely rural community,

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.920
and let's talk about the census real

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:18.920
quick. The Department of Commerce handles many different

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:20.920
sub-agencies, including the Census Bureau.

01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.920
The Census Bureau was established in 1902

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.920
to count the entire

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.920
US population every 10 years as mandated

01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.920
in the Constitution for the

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.920
apportionment of seats in the US House of Representatives

01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.920
along with other services.

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:34.920
It was reported that

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.920
the census undercounted several states' populations

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.920
in 2020 after a

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:40.920
post enumeration survey. I can get you that

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:42.920
reference if you need it

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.920
down the road. This included Arkansas,

01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:46.920
Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Tennessee,

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.920
and my home state of Texas.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920
The Census Bureau also

01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:52.920
overcounted eight states, including Delaware,

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:54.920
Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota,

01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:56.920
New York, Ohio, Rhode Island,

01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:58.920
and Utah.

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:00.920
As we talk about—and it's

01:49:00.920 --> 01:49:02.920
very important to my voters. They bring it up

01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:04.920
all the time. If the people of Texas are under

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:06.920
representative in the House,

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:08.920
in the number of apportionment and congressmen,

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:10.920
and the people of another state are

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:12.920
overrepresented, then the Census

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.920
Bureau has threatened the very foundation of our

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.920
republic in a way that ensures

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:18.920
the people of Texas are not fully represented.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.920
The very foundation of our

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:22.920
system requires an accurate count of the number of American

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:24.920
citizens who are eligible to vote

01:49:24.920 --> 01:49:26.920
and are represented by their representatives

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:28.920
in the House. So the

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.920
impression for the folks in my district are that

01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:32.920
the last census count was used by

01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.920
somebody, say, on the

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:36.920
left to ensure that democrat-leaning states were

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.920
overcounted and conservative-leaning states

01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:40.920
were undercounted. Five

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:42.920
of the six states that were undercounted were majority

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.920
republican. Seven of the eight states that were

01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.920
overcounted were majority democrat.

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.920
That doesn't really—

01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:50.920
I'm not a statistician, but that

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:52.920
doesn't sound very good to me. So

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:54.920
let's talk about the budget. The Census Bureau

01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.920
is requesting $1.6 billion in

01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.920
fiscal year 2024, which includes an additional

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.920
$164 million for the 2030

01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:02.920
census. How do y'all

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:04.920
plan on fixing the

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.920
lessons learned from the 2020 census? Because

01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:08.920
representation

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:10.920
in congress ultimately determines the electoral

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.920
college,

01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.920
and it's winner-take-all. So the folks in my

01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.920
district would really like to—they don't really trust the

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.920
census. So I'd like to hear how you're going to

01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:20.920
fix that.

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.920
It's an excellent question, and I appreciate the

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.920
question. Let me say a few

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.920
things. So first of all, you're right,

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:28.920
which is to say there's

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.920
no place for politics

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:32.920
or political views

01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.920
in how the census is

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:36.920
administered.

01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.920
It should be

01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.920
do the count, right? Do the count.

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.920
Who's living in Texas, who's living in

01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.920
wherever, accurately,

01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:46.920
et cetera.

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:48.920
So I give you that commitment. I, of course,

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:50.920
wasn't here for the last census,

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.920
but

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:54.920
there'll be zero political

01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:56.920
interference. We're getting ready now for 2030.

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.920
The instruction to the team

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.920
is do your work, be apolitical, count

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.920
the data, and make sure everyone's counted.

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.920
I will say

01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:08.920
2020 was really hard. I was

01:51:08.920 --> 01:51:10.920
the governor at the time. It was in the middle

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:12.920
of a lot of challenges

01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:14.920
to collect in 2020.

01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.920
So we're learning

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.920
from that

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.920
experience and figuring out how

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.920
we can make it better. And as I said before

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.920
with Congressman Meng, right now

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.920
we have like 50 research

01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:28.920
projects going on in the census

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.920
to figure out how to be more

01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:32.920
accurate. So I guess

01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:34.920
I would just say I agree fully with

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:36.920
the sentiment and be happy

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:38.920
to follow up with you, you know, more

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:40.920
specifically. Rob Santos,

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.920
who runs the census, is his top flight

01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:44.920
statistician from Texas

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.920
and can have

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:48.920
him follow up. I'd sure appreciate that because

01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:50.920
I think finding out, you know, when you're

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:52.920
a fighter pilot, as my

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:54.920
friend Mike Garcia and I flew together,

01:51:54.920 --> 01:51:56.920
you brief, you

01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:58.920
do the mission, and then you debrief. And I think

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:00.920
a serious debrief that

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:02.920
would tell us exactly what lessons

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:04.920
learned we have and then going forward

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.920
so that this doesn't happen again because

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.920
I don't care. 2016, the left

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.920
thought that the election was stolen. 2020,

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.920
there's a lot of folks on my side that

01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:14.920
aren't, don't have any faith

01:52:14.920 --> 01:52:16.920
in the integrity of the election. So

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:18.920
it is important. It's

01:52:18.920 --> 01:52:20.920
absolutely essential for

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.920
the survival of our republic the way we want

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:24.920
it to, that we do this right next

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.920
time. So thank you very much for your time.

01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.920
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.920
Thank you,

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:32.920
Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that.

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:34.920
Governor, it's great to see you and

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.920
you've done a wonderful job. We really

01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.920
appreciate your long, long public

01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.920
service. So thank you very

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.920
much. The National

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.920
Institute of Standards and Technology,

01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:46.920
NIST. It's headquartered

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:48.920
in my district

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:50.920
and it's one of the leading agencies.

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.920
We were there together

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:54.920
driving scientific innovation

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:56.920
and some of our

01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.920
most pressing problems.

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.920
However, the facilities

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:02.920
are a train wreck.

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.920
The buildings were built in the 1950s.

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:06.920
The scientists,

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.920
while they're great on science,

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:10.920
they aren't good on asking for money.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.920
They aren't good on explaining why their buildings

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.920
are falling down

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:16.920
and that it impedes their scientific

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:18.920
work

01:53:18.920 --> 01:53:20.920
and costs us untold

01:53:20.920 --> 01:53:22.920
tens of millions of dollars

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:24.920
by working in poor facilities.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:26.920
So

01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:28.920
China, of course, has taken the opposite

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:30.920
task. They've invested

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:32.920
in their equivalence of NIST.

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.920
They actually have five facilities

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:36.920
that were a dead ringer,

01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.920
a copy of NIST,

01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:40.920
that they did when they came over here and looked at our

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:42.920
NIST. They went out and built five of their own.

01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:44.920
So they're looking to overtake us

01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.920
in this area

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.920
in standards and, you know, meteorology.

01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.920
So

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:52.920
last year, with Chairman Cartwright's support,

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.920
we were able to increase the construction

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:56.920
funding in NIST

01:53:56.920 --> 01:53:58.920
to 130 million.

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:00.920
This year, the President's budget came back at

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:02.920
262 million.

01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.920
And

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:06.920
we're 2.3 billion, backlog,

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.920
don't forget, 2.3 billion

01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.920
behind. So I just want to

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.920
stress the fact it's so important

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:14.920
that with all the noise that cut the budget

01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:16.920
to 22 levels,

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:18.920
you know, we can't shoot our

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:20.920
nose off despite ourselves

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.920
and we need to invest for the long

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:24.920
term. As a business guy,

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.920
that's the right way to do it.

01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:28.920
So could you just talk for a second

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:30.920
about that hidden cost

01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.920
of these deteriorating facilities,

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.920
especially the cost of talent?

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:36.920
I mean, the director told me she

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:38.920
loses top talent to China.

01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:40.920
Go to China to work.

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:42.920
They don't want to work somewhere nice.

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:44.920
Yeah.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:46.920
Well, thank you, Congressman, and thank you for your consistent

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:48.920
support. I would invite anyone here

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.920
to come with

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.920
me for a visit to NIST

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.920
facilities. The Congressman and I have gone.

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.920
And it is true that

01:54:56.920 --> 01:54:58.920
these facilities

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:00.920
need investment.

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:02.920
I will tell you, the people working

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:04.920
in NIST are top

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:06.920
notch. We have Nobel Prize

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:08.920
winning physicists who work for

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:10.920
NIST.

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:12.920
We have this leading

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:14.920
artificial intelligence, quantum

01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.920
and cyber

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:18.920
experts work at NIST.

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:20.920
But as you say, they work in

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:22.920
dilapidated buildings,

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.920
which is unfair,

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:26.920
sometimes unsafe, and

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:28.920
prevents them.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:30.920
The National Academy's assessment

01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:32.920
of the condition of NIST R&D

01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.920
facilities

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920
finds them to be quote unquote

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:38.920
unacceptable. Their report

01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:40.920
found that a median

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:42.920
of 20 percent of

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.920
all researcher time each

01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:46.920
year is lost due to

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.920
facility impacts of their

01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.920
work. So

01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.920
they're less productive. You know, they're

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:54.920
less productive. I think it's probably at least 20 percent,

01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:56.920
having been there myself.

01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.920
Where they go,

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:00.920
they go to the private sector, they go

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.920
to universities, but we just

01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:04.920
have to make these investments, which is why we're asking

01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:06.920
for more investing.

01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.920
We certainly have phenomenal talent

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:10.920
there. It just absolutely blows your mind

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.920
how smart these guys and gals

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:14.920
are, women are, men and women, but

01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:16.920
the young researchers,

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:18.920
they have choices.

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:20.920
They can go private or they can

01:56:20.920 --> 01:56:22.920
go abroad. And that's what we seem

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:24.920
to lose in that pipeline, as our

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.920
researchers just age out.

01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:28.920
We don't have the young folks with the new ideas

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:30.920
coming up, because

01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:32.920
work facilities and

01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.920
standards matter

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.920
to them more.

01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:38.920
Agree, to track new

01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:40.920
people. And again,

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.920
back to everything we've been talking about,

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:44.920
leading the world in technology,

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:46.920
what they focus on is artificial intelligence,

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:48.920
cyber security, quantum computing,

01:56:48.920 --> 01:56:50.920
everything America needs to lead

01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:52.920
in, and

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:54.920
they are doing that, but the facilities

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:56.920
in which they're doing that are holding

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.920
them back and making them

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:00.920
less productive. Fantastic, I appreciate

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.920
your support and I look forward

01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:04.920
to the next round to talk about some broadband

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.920
stuff, so I yield back to

01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:08.920
Chairman.

01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:10.920
I would like to do a second

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.920
round of questions, but

01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:14.920
the Secretary

01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:16.920
has an obligation at

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:18.920
four o'clock. So we can go quick.

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.920
We want to accommodate her

01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:22.920
schedule.

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:24.920
So we'll do a second round

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:26.920
but very brief.

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:28.920
Hopefully three minutes or

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:30.920
less.

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:32.920
And I'll recognize myself.

01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:34.920
The assistance

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:36.920
to coal communities

01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.920
program administered by

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:40.920
ADA

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.920
has been critical in providing

01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:44.920
funding and tactical

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:46.920
assistance to communities

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:48.920
affected by the decline of the coal

01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:50.920
industry.

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.920
I represent one of the biggest coal

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.920
mining, former coal mining

01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.920
communities in the country.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.920
And I understand the importance of this

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.920
program for our communities

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.920
and I encourage you to prioritize

01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:04.920
grant funding for that

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:06.920
program especially.

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:08.920
Can you give us an update on the program's

01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.920
progress in supporting

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:12.920
economic development

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.920
and diversification efforts in coal

01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:16.920
communities across the country?

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.920
Yes. This is a top priority

01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:20.920
of mine, of President Biden's, and

01:58:20.920 --> 01:58:22.920
I know it matters a lot to you in

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.920
Kentucky.

01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:26.920
The update is that

01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.920
we are investing at record

01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:30.920
amounts and will continue to

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.920
do so and we are creating jobs

01:58:32.920 --> 01:58:34.920
in these communities in new industries

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.920
which is really very exciting.

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.920
So for example, in Kentucky we've

01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.920
put more than $23

01:58:42.920 --> 01:58:44.920
million through ADA

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:46.920
into coal communities

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:48.920
since I've been secretary, effectively

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:50.920
to create new jobs, to do job

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:52.920
training, same in West Virginia.

01:58:52.920 --> 01:58:54.920
With the ARP money

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:56.920
we were able to take

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:58.920
$300 million and put it

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:00.920
into coal communities. And I would

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:02.920
simply say, as I said before,

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.920
these communities won't be brought back

01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:06.920
to life unless we invest.

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:08.920
And you know

01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:10.920
what happens otherwise, no jobs,

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:12.920
opioid addiction,

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:14.920
we have

01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.920
to be there for them to get new jobs,

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:18.920
new job training, new industries,

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:20.920
and so we're extremely focused

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.920
on it. We're trying to

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:24.920
reinvent the economy

01:59:24.920 --> 01:59:26.920
of my region

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.920
with especially high-tech

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:30.920
stuff. In fact,

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.920
I've coined a phrase that

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.920
fits our goal

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:36.920
and it's called

01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:38.920
Silicon Hauler.

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:44.920
So thank you for

01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:46.920
working with us.

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:48.920
Do you agree with FBI

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:50.920
Director Ray's national

01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:52.920
security concerns about TikTok?

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:56.920
And do you agree with ODNI

01:59:56.920 --> 01:59:58.920
Director Haynes

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:00.920
assessment that

02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.920
China is collecting foreign data

02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.920
to target

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:06.920
audiences for information

02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:08.920
campaigns?

02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.920
I do. I do. You know, I don't think

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.920
we can limit. I

02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:14.920
think that all of these

02:00:14.920 --> 02:00:16.920
connected apps and many

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:18.920
other technology

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.920
apps pose

02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.920
risks. And

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:24.920
in fact, I look forward to

02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:26.920
working with Congress in a bipartisan way

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.920
to enhance our security in that respect.

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:32.920
Mr. Cartwright?

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:34.920
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Secretary,

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.920
last year's hearing, we talked about Ukraine

02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.920
and how

02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.920
the Bureau of Industry and Security

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:42.920
is a critical agency in aiding

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.920
our efforts to enforce the export

02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:46.920
controls on

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.920
Russia and Belarus in

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:50.920
response to Russia's war

02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.920
against Ukraine. We provided $22

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:54.920
million in supplemental funding

02:00:54.920 --> 02:00:56.920
to assist BIS

02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.920
on that front last year. Can you give us

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:00.920
an update on how these funds

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.920
have been used and is it working?

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:04.920
Thank you. Thank you for the support.

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:06.920
I would say, yes, it is working.

02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:08.920
We have 39

02:01:08.920 --> 02:01:10.920
we led a coalition of 39

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.920
countries around the world.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.920
We've put more than 500 Russian entities

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:16.920
on the entity list.

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.920
We've stopped hundreds of shipments

02:01:18.920 --> 02:01:20.920
going into

02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.920
Russia. We know

02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:24.920
they're

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:26.920
struggling to continue

02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:28.920
the war because they can't repair

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:30.920
equipment.

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:32.920
They don't have the semiconductors to repair the equipment.

02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:34.920
They don't have the spare parts to conduct the equipment.

02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:38.920
But it is, as I said before

02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:40.920
with Rep Garcia, it's a

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.920
daily vigilance.

02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.920
It makes my blood boil every time I learn

02:01:44.920 --> 02:01:46.920
about

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.920
a downed piece of equipment

02:01:48.920 --> 02:01:50.920
that has American equipment still

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.920
in it. So we're constantly on it.

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:54.920
Is it working? Yes.

02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:56.920
Do we need to stay on it every day? Yes.

02:01:56.920 --> 02:01:58.920
Can we do that work without

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:00.920
resources? No.

02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:02.920
Well, you have been diligent

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:04.920
in coming to our classified

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:06.920
security briefings.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.920
And I encourage you to keep doing that. Keep us

02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.920
posted. Heel back, Mr. Chairman.

02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.920
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:16.920
I'll be brief, Governor.

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:18.920
VX, you remember VX, a very

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:20.920
lethal chemical weapon

02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:22.920
gas, about a thousand times more potent

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:24.920
than sarin.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.920
If we had indications that

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:28.920
VX gas or powder

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:30.920
was in route

02:02:30.920 --> 02:02:32.920
and we had indications from the Intelligence Committee

02:02:32.920 --> 02:02:34.920
or Community DoD

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.920
Maritime Surveillance,

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:38.920
that there was a plan to

02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:40.920
ship that VX

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.920
through Mexico across our

02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:44.920
southern border into the United States to be

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:46.920
used as a chemical weapon,

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:48.920
what would the response of the Department of

02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:50.920
Commerce be?

02:02:51.920 --> 02:02:53.920
I mean,

02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:55.920
I don't know

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:57.920
the details of that, so I'm quite

02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.920
resident to talk about

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.920
a specific issue, but

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:03.920
look, anything like that would be

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:05.920
an interagency response

02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:07.920
led by the intelligence

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:09.920
community and Department of Homeland Security.

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.920
But we would do whatever we needed to

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:13.920
do to support the effort.

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:15.920
Making sure we're tracking the

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:17.920
vessels, the points of

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:19.920
origin of the material coming from China

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.920
through to Mexico

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:23.920
and assist the DoD,

02:03:23.920 --> 02:03:25.920
Homeland Security and the interdiction of

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.920
what would be effectively a weapon of

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.920
mass destruction. We would do whatever was called

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.920
upon us to meet the mission.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:33.920
I think we have that scenario today. It's just not called

02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:35.920
VX, it's called Fentanyl. We have

02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:37.920
active precursor exports

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:39.920
coming out of China with this known

02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:41.920
game plan of sending them to Mexico,

02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:43.920
taking that powder, making

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.920
the pill in Mexico and then shipping

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:47.920
to the United States where, ironically

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.920
and painfully, we've actually lost more people

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:51.920
from Fentanyl than VX gas in the

02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:53.920
history of the planet just in the last

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.920
couple of days. So I

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:57.920
think this is the paradigm that commerce,

02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.920
DoD,

02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:01.920
Homeland and the intelligence

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:03.920
communities need to take.

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.920
I don't know how to spread that

02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:07.920
in this administration and get everyone

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.920
to absorb that paradigm, but

02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.920
that's not happening right now.

02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:13.920
We have a weapon of mass destruction coming across

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.920
our southern borders, killing 100,000 Americans

02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:17.920
every year, 30 times more

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:19.920
than people died on 9-11.

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.920
And this executive branch,

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.920
to include commerce, DoD

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:25.920
and state,

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.920
are doing nothing to mitigate that

02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:29.920
except for

02:04:29.920 --> 02:04:31.920
enforcement once it gets across our borders.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.920
Look, I would say a couple

02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:35.920
of quick things. I'm mindful of time.

02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:37.920
This I did see upfront and

02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:39.920
very painfully and personally as governor.

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:41.920
And Fentanyl

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.920
sometimes even touching it can be deadly.

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.920
That's right. Just like VX.

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.920
It is horrific.

02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:49.920
Much

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.920
begins in China

02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:53.920
and is synthetic.

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.920
The thing I would say to you is that this is

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:57.920
a priority of the presidents.

02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:59.920
I was with the president in

02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:01.920
Mexico. We talked extensively

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:03.920
with President López Obrador.

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.920
I met just a week

02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.920
ago with Secretary Blinken on this.

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:09.920
I'm going to be doing a lot more private sector

02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.920
in the US outreach.

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:13.920
So I disagree that we're doing nothing,

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:15.920
but I will tell you it's a priority.

02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:17.920
What we are doing is ineffective.

02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:19.920
This has to be treated like a chemical weapon

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:21.920
of mass destruction coming across the Pacific Ocean

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.920
and through our borders.

02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.920
I'm out of time. I yield back.

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.920
Ms. Ming.

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.920
Thank you. Before I ask my quick question,

02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.920
I do want to give credit where credit is due

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:33.920
in relation to my

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.920
colleagues' question about

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.920
the census being from the state of New York.

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:39.920
I want to applaud my leaders

02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:41.920
at the city and the state levels,

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:43.920
one, for investing

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:45.920
money and time in making

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:47.920
sure that we were counting

02:05:47.920 --> 02:05:49.920
accurately in the state of New

02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:51.920
York, having

02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.920
a get out the count campaign,

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:55.920
and two, not engaging

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.920
in fear mongering and

02:05:57.920 --> 02:05:59.920
trying to determine who deserves

02:05:59.920 --> 02:06:01.920
to be counted or not.

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:03.920
Madam Secretary, my question

02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:05.920
is about the

02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:07.920
department's regulation of 3D printed

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:09.920
firearms.

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:11.920
When the Trump administration moved

02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:13.920
jurisdiction of export oversight from

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.920
state to commerce, they created

02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:17.920
an enforcement loophole which has allowed

02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:19.920
for the dissemination of instructions

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:21.920
for printing 3D guns.

02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:23.920
Last October, I led a letter

02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.920
with Senator Markey

02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:27.920
asking President Biden to strengthen the

02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:29.920
regulatory oversight of these guns

02:06:29.920 --> 02:06:31.920
specifically by having your department

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:33.920
strike the ready for insertion

02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.920
qualification and clarifying

02:06:35.920 --> 02:06:37.920
that the rule included instruction files

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.920
that were emailed or otherwise

02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.920
made available to foreign persons.

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:43.920
Mr. Chairman, I request

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:45.920
unanimous consent to insert my letter

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:47.920
in the record.

02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:49.920
Thank you.

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.920
Madam Secretary, do you believe the current

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:53.920
version of the regulations are broad

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:55.920
enough to apply to any known

02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:57.920
versions of currently viable

02:06:57.920 --> 02:06:59.920
3D firearm files?

02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:01.920
And can we get a commitment

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.920
from you to issue guidance to that

02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.920
aspect?

02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:07.920
I would say that you have been consistent

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:09.920
in your focus on this

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.920
and I admire that.

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:13.920
You can get a commitment that

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:15.920
I will send Under Secretary

02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.920
Estevez to sit with you and talk

02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:19.920
through it.

02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.920
I will just say that we still work

02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:23.920
with the Department of State.

02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:25.920
This is all an interagency process

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:27.920
and state is at the table.

02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:29.920
And we absolutely share

02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:31.920
your passion

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.920
in making sure that none of this

02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.920
controlled substances,

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.920
software, et cetera,

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:39.920
can get into the wrong hands.

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:41.920
So we'll follow up.

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:43.920
Thank you. I yield back. What time to spare?

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:45.920
Mr. Claude.

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:47.920
I'd like to follow up

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.920
on

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.920
Rep

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:53.920
Elsie's questions regarding the census.

02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:55.920
Who gets counted?

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:57.920
Who gets counted? Everyone who lives

02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.920
in the country gets counted.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.920
Who lives in the country? Okay.

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:03.920
So does that include illegals and permanent

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:05.920
residents?

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:07.920
If you live here, yes.

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.920
There's no citizenship requirement,

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:11.920
nor should there be.

02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:13.920
In the last two years, over six million

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:15.920
illegals have entered our country.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:17.920
Illegals cannot vote.

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:19.920
Only citizens can vote. Am I correct?

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:21.920
Yes.

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:23.920
Therefore, the more illegals that

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.920
enter the country,

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:27.920
that then

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:29.920
disproportionately

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:31.920
disenfranchises

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:33.920
those of us who are citizens who can vote

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:35.920
because we don't have

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.920
proper representation.

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.920
Is that not right?

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:41.920
I would dispute that characterization,

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.920
but

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.920
my job is to run the census

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:47.920
faithfully in accordance with the law and the Constitution

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:49.920
to count everyone who lives

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:51.920
here, and that is what we are doing

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:53.920
faithfully.

02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:55.920
Okay. All right.

02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:57.920
Well, I guess we'll just have to disagree on that

02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:59.920
where it comes to

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:03.920
citizens versus illegals

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:05.920
because I think that

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:09.920
that disproportionately

02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:11.920
for any particular area,

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:13.920
it disproportionately

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:15.920
disenfranchises the American

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.920
citizen because then

02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:19.920
it takes fewer citizens

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.920
to create one particular

02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:23.920
representative

02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:25.920
and more illegals then can do that.

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.920
I mean, if you look at the six million

02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:29.920
illegals, that's the equivalent

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.920
of

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:33.920
what, 12?

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.920
12 congressional seats? No, not 12.

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.920
Nine congressional seats.

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.920
That's a lot of people. Thank you, and I yield back.

02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.920
Mr.

02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:43.920
Tron, can you keep it to one minute?

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:45.920
I could do it, Mr. Chairman.

02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.920
Thank you, Governor. Great time.

02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.920
Quickly,

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:51.920
in all the census counting problem,

02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.920
that was Trump working really hard

02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:55.920
to disenfranchise and not count

02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:57.920
the minorities, just so we're all clear

02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.920
about the honest truth of that.

02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:01.920
Broadband, going to be a game changer.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.920
Rural America, going to be a whole

02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:05.920
other world. It's so

02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.920
awesome it's going to happen. 42.5

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.920
billion coming out of your group.

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:11.920
April Delaney's pushing it

02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.920
out. We're working with her. She's great.

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:15.920
Are we on track for

02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:17.920
June on the funding?

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:19.920
June 30th. Every state will know

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:21.920
by June 30th what their

02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:23.920
amount is.

02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:25.920
Great. In workforce development

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:27.920
programs, we're going to need a ton of

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.920
workforce. Same problem you have in the

02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.920
CHIPS area. Putting this

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:33.920
broadband in, we don't have

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.920
the people to put it in.

02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:37.920
Thoughts on that? What do we need?

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:39.920
Listen, this is a huge issue.

02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:41.920
Again,

02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:43.920
the unemployment rate among

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:45.920
plumbers, pipefitters, welders in

02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:47.920
your states, you can't find anyone.

02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.920
Broadband alone, we think,

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:51.920
will require about 100,000

02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:53.920
people. Technicians,

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.920
fibresplicers, people to lay the fiber and the whole

02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:57.920
thing. CHIPS, another 100,000.

02:10:57.920 --> 02:10:59.920
So we need to

02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:01.920
train, and the great thing is

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.920
high paying jobs that don't require a

02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:05.920
college degree.

02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.920
We are baking in

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:09.920
workforce development into

02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:11.920
everything we do at Commerce.

02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.920
In fact, part of our request in EDA

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.920
is $100 million for good jobs.

02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:17.920
CHIPS money, broadband money,

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:19.920
train people, and

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:21.920
get them jobs.

02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:23.920
Only we're ever going to get it right. Thank you, I yield back.

02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:25.920
Well, Madam Secretary,

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:27.920
it's two minutes after four.

02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:29.920
You've been saved by the bell.

02:11:29.920 --> 02:11:31.920
Well, I don't know.

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.920
Representative Troun says this was a good time.

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:37.920
That concludes today's hearing.

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.920
Thank you very much, Madam Secretary.

02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:41.920
Thank you for your time.

02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:43.920
It's my pleasure, thank you.

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.920
With that objection, all members

02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:47.920
will have seven legislative days

02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.920
to submit additional written questions

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:51.920
for the witness or additional

02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:53.920
materials for the record.

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.920
The hearing is adjourned.

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:15.920
Diolch yn fawr.
