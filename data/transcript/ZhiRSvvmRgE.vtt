WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.040
Good morning, everybody's awake.

00:11.040 --> 00:15.960
Seeing that board members are now present, I hereby call the May 2023 meeting of the

00:15.960 --> 00:19.720
State Board of Education to order at 831 a.m.

00:19.720 --> 00:24.320
And I'd like to commence by saluting the flag, Member Escobedo, will you please lead us in

00:24.320 --> 00:25.320
the Pledge of Allegiance?

00:25.680 --> 00:27.680
Hand over the mark, ready to begin.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.320
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for

00:34.320 --> 00:42.880
which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.320
Thank you.

00:44.320 --> 00:48.040
I'd like to welcome board members, staff, and members of the public who are attending

00:48.040 --> 00:49.960
this board meeting in person.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.840
I encourage everyone in the board room to wear masks.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.680
The masks are available in the back of the room if you need one.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.600
We have had reported exposures in the last two board meetings, but no reported transmissions,

01:01.600 --> 01:08.320
so our safety strategies are working and we thank you for your consideration.

01:08.320 --> 01:12.320
I'd also like to announce that we will be without two board members for this meeting,

01:12.320 --> 01:15.440
Board Member McQuillan and Board Member Patio-Bronson.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.040
We'll also be without Board Member Escobedo on Friday.

01:20.040 --> 01:26.840
For the consent calendars, the proposed waiver consent items are W1 through W11, and the

01:26.840 --> 01:30.960
proposed regular consent items are items 4 through 8.

01:30.960 --> 01:36.120
There is one public hearing on the agenda.

01:36.120 --> 01:43.360
Item 13, time community, will be a public hearing to consider revocation of the charter

01:43.360 --> 01:47.960
if we so decide today.

01:48.040 --> 01:53.200
The changes in the agenda include reopening item 1 later this morning to hear from State

01:53.200 --> 01:57.880
Superintendent Toni Thurmond, and again this afternoon to take action on the preliminary

01:57.880 --> 02:03.600
report of actions draft March 2023 meeting minutes to take up revisions to the terms

02:03.600 --> 02:10.280
of the two March 2023 appointments to advisory commission on special education, and to report

02:10.280 --> 02:12.680
on our liaison assignments.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.880
We will move item 12, presentation of the California State Plan for Career Technical

02:17.880 --> 02:24.240
Education from tomorrow to this afternoon after item 10.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.920
Public comment will be accepted either in person or by phone.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.600
Members of the public wishing to call for public comment should view the live stream

02:31.600 --> 02:36.440
of the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.960
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering a participant access

02:41.040 --> 02:45.240
code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

02:45.240 --> 02:48.600
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.920
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.760
We'll also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they

02:57.760 --> 03:01.840
are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

03:01.840 --> 03:06.000
Members of the public wishing to provide public comment in person should sign in using the

03:06.000 --> 03:08.840
binder at the table just outside the room.

03:08.880 --> 03:14.560
The binder is on the table with separate pages for each item number.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.680
This will help ensure that staff is able to track the in-person speakers for a particular

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
item.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.600
Public comment is limited to one minute for each speaker.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.000
Where speakers require interpretation, two minutes will be provided.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.680
Item 14 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide

03:31.680 --> 03:37.320
comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

03:37.320 --> 03:44.560
And so we're now going to open up with item 1, which is our state board projects and priorities

03:44.560 --> 03:45.560
item.

03:45.560 --> 03:51.080
The superintendent will give his report later this morning, and I will give a short report

03:51.080 --> 03:55.560
now before we proceed with the rest of the agenda.

03:55.560 --> 04:02.520
And this is the month of May, which is a joyful month in many ways, in addition to coming

04:02.600 --> 04:07.720
close to the end of the school year and everyone looking forward to summer vacation.

04:07.720 --> 04:12.280
May is when we celebrate all the wonderful, hardworking people in our public education

04:12.280 --> 04:13.400
system.

04:13.400 --> 04:19.720
So I want to start today by thanking California's teachers, counselors, administrators, school

04:19.720 --> 04:25.240
nurses, school librarians, school psychologists, support staff, nutrition workers, and everyone

04:25.240 --> 04:31.160
else who make our schools a joyful, pleasurable place to learn.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.680
And we appreciate you.

04:33.680 --> 04:38.560
May is also when we learn a little bit more about the state's financial projections and

04:38.560 --> 04:43.320
how those impact the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, which is when we release

04:43.320 --> 04:47.280
what's called the May revise to the budget.

04:47.280 --> 04:53.600
And last week, Governor Newsom did release that revision to the January budget and talked

04:53.600 --> 04:58.460
about the uncertainties and the risks that are affecting our financial picture.

04:58.460 --> 05:03.460
Those uncertainties include the change in the tax filing deadline to October, I'm taking

05:03.460 --> 05:08.740
advantage of it, I don't know about you, which means that they don't know how much tax money

05:08.740 --> 05:15.820
is coming in, instability in the banking sector, higher interest rates, and a possible fallout

05:15.820 --> 05:18.900
from the debt limit impasse in Congress.

05:18.900 --> 05:24.060
So these together can lead to a projected shortfall of $32 billion from the earlier

05:24.060 --> 05:25.660
projected revenues.

05:25.980 --> 05:31.460
Again, this is estimated because there are so many things to yet be known.

05:31.460 --> 05:35.300
Fortunately, the governor and the legislature have managed the state's resources over these

05:35.300 --> 05:39.780
last four years very intelligently and very carefully.

05:39.780 --> 05:44.060
And because of that careful planning, the governor is able to raise the cost of living

05:44.060 --> 05:50.540
increase for schools to 8.22% from what was projected in January, continue the state's

05:50.620 --> 05:55.940
investments in the whole child initiatives we have been part of, and limit downward

05:55.940 --> 06:00.940
funding adjustments to only school programs funded by one-time money.

06:00.940 --> 06:05.660
Some other budget highlights include that we have continued funding for universal transitional

06:05.660 --> 06:11.540
kindergarten, which is coming online, and one of the interesting things is that in response

06:11.540 --> 06:18.900
to surveys this year, about a third of districts said they're going to reach full enrollment

06:19.140 --> 06:26.300
and access faster than the legislative deadline, including our four largest districts.

06:26.300 --> 06:32.500
It includes $1.6 billion for universal free meals, $80 million to support county offices

06:32.500 --> 06:37.700
of education serving students in juvenile court and other alternative settings, a new

06:37.700 --> 06:45.500
requirement for LEAs to provide literacy screening for all K-2 students beginning in 2025-26,

06:45.500 --> 06:51.500
with safeguards for multilingual learners and another million dollars to support the

06:51.500 --> 06:55.900
board in identifying the screeners that LEAs can use.

06:55.900 --> 07:01.420
We have improvements to the local control funding formulas accountability system proposed

07:01.420 --> 07:06.620
to better focus attention on equity gaps and low achieving student groups and to help schools

07:06.620 --> 07:13.620
leverage that $80 billion in LCFSF funding so that it reaches the students who need it

07:13.620 --> 07:15.140
the most.

07:15.140 --> 07:21.460
The addition of a $300 million dollar equity multiplier to LCFSF, which is another investment

07:21.460 --> 07:25.060
in the schools with the greatest need.

07:25.060 --> 07:28.980
Continued commitment to initiatives aimed at recruiting and retaining educators.

07:28.980 --> 07:34.940
California was one of only seven states in the country last year in 2020-2021 that did

07:34.940 --> 07:42.100
see gains in entrance to teaching in part because of some of those investments.

07:42.140 --> 07:46.380
And a continued commitment to expanded learning opportunities through after school, before

07:46.380 --> 07:48.780
school programs and summer school.

07:48.780 --> 07:53.300
So we have been, as you know, really investing in learning recovery.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.120
All of that will continue.

07:55.120 --> 08:04.060
We did see very optimistic trends between 2021 and 2022 for the students who took the

08:04.060 --> 08:10.500
same test both years, accelerating faster than they had before the pandemic.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.620
Those investments are going to continue in the years to come.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.220
We know that this is not the end of the process.

08:18.220 --> 08:24.180
There is a second phase of the budget process, often known as sausage making, which will

08:24.180 --> 08:29.900
continue until the legislature completes a final budget about the middle of June.

08:29.900 --> 08:34.380
I want to thank the governor for his work to protect education investments that are

08:34.380 --> 08:39.820
helping our schools become places of deeper learning with a focus on student health, happiness

08:39.820 --> 08:41.260
and equity.

08:41.260 --> 08:47.860
And with that, we'll launch our meeting with item two.

08:47.860 --> 08:54.460
And we'll be joined by Cindy Kazanis.

08:54.460 --> 08:58.940
Item two is the adoption of the updated list of valid and reliable assessments required

08:58.940 --> 09:04.500
by the California Education Code section 47607.2.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.800
And the CDE recommends that we approve the recommendations contained in attachment one

09:09.800 --> 09:13.660
to update the criteria to define verified data.

09:13.660 --> 09:21.420
This is data to be used by charter schools, should they so choose, in their renewal applications,

09:21.420 --> 09:28.060
to update the data use procedures related to the verified data, and to update the academic

09:28.060 --> 09:32.900
progress indicators for inclusion within the approved verified data list.

09:32.900 --> 09:39.860
And the item will be presented by Cindy Kazanis of the CDE, Eric Crane and Kelly Weinbein of

09:39.860 --> 09:40.860
WestEd.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.020
Cindy, please begin.

09:43.020 --> 09:44.020
Thank you.

09:44.020 --> 09:48.060
Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis, Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

09:48.060 --> 09:50.580
And today I am not talking to you about accountability.

09:50.580 --> 09:55.700
This is separate and apart from our work on the California School Dashboard, but related

09:55.700 --> 09:57.940
in some parts.

09:57.940 --> 10:04.140
So to get us started, just walking through the attachments and appendix briefly, we will

10:04.140 --> 10:09.660
with the help of the WestEd team that President Darling-Hammond just introduced, we will hear

10:09.660 --> 10:12.540
about their work through attachment one.

10:12.540 --> 10:15.900
Attachment two is the full education code for these sections.

10:15.900 --> 10:23.320
And then we've also included appendixes A and B, which is the work of WestEd to engage

10:24.320 --> 10:31.920
on this item, as well as work around verified data, including the test publishers who you

10:31.920 --> 10:36.240
are going to be asked to approve today.

10:36.240 --> 10:42.080
We do have two corrections in the item, grammatical errors that we did not catch.

10:42.080 --> 10:49.680
And so under attachment one on page 15, we should have said instead of, there was I think

10:50.080 --> 10:54.040
three assessments, it should say these five assessments, and then we did misspell one

10:54.040 --> 10:59.440
of the educator advocates' names.

10:59.440 --> 11:03.560
So the recommendation before you today from the California Department of Education is

11:03.560 --> 11:08.480
that you approve the recommendations contained in attachment one, first to update the criteria

11:08.480 --> 11:13.440
to define verified data, second to update the data use procedures related to verified

11:13.440 --> 11:18.780
data, and finally to update the academic progress indicators for inclusion within the approved

11:18.820 --> 11:22.220
verified data list.

11:22.220 --> 11:29.100
We've provided a couple of the definitions, some quoting verbatim and others with trying

11:29.100 --> 11:35.140
to summarize their intent to provide you just a bit of context.

11:35.140 --> 11:40.900
When looking back at November 2020, you were here under the leadership under President

11:40.900 --> 11:46.300
Darlene Hammond, there were others in the role of the liaison for accountability, specifically

11:46.300 --> 11:48.740
member Sue Burr and Eileen Strauss.

11:48.740 --> 11:54.380
And so while there are some familiar faces that probably recall this item from, I think

11:54.380 --> 11:59.980
that was our last in-person during COVID, it's I think helpful to reintroduce to many

11:59.980 --> 12:03.060
of you the work that the board did before.

12:03.060 --> 12:09.740
So specifically, the board was required at that time to adopt by January 1st, 2021,

12:09.740 --> 12:15.260
establishing the criteria to define verified data and to identify an approved list of valid

12:15.300 --> 12:18.220
and reliable assessments, which the board did.

12:18.220 --> 12:26.180
And then just in terms of definitions, verified data means data derived from nationally recognized,

12:26.180 --> 12:30.700
valid, peer-reviewed, and reliable sources that are externally produced, and verified

12:30.700 --> 12:34.460
data shall include measures of post-secondary outcomes.

12:34.460 --> 12:39.660
And those were actions that, again, the board worked towards in that original item.

12:39.660 --> 12:44.820
And finally, the Ed Code section listed at the bottom there is talking about what the

12:44.820 --> 12:50.580
definition of an increased academic achievement as having at least one year's progress for

12:50.580 --> 12:55.220
each year in school.

12:55.220 --> 13:03.500
As far as the renewal criteria, AB 1505, set forward criteria that is applied to charter

13:03.660 --> 13:04.900
schools statewide.

13:04.900 --> 13:11.620
It was designed to hold all charter schools to the same criteria and standards, and the

13:11.620 --> 13:18.860
criteria does place charter schools into performance levels, which is the work of my division.

13:18.860 --> 13:24.180
The renewal process also asks that charter schools and authorizers are required to follow

13:24.180 --> 13:27.620
as dependent on that performance level that was established.

13:27.620 --> 13:33.140
And to note, this criteria that we're talking about today and the approved lists does exclude

13:33.580 --> 13:41.180
our Dashboard Alternative School Status, or DAS schools, which have separate renewal criteria.

13:41.180 --> 13:46.540
So as far as using verified data in the renewal process, again, just a brief overview.

13:46.540 --> 13:51.940
This is not part of the action, but a charter school in the low-performance category may

13:51.940 --> 13:57.340
not be renewed in addition to other requirements it demonstrates through verified data, measurable

13:57.340 --> 14:02.580
increases in academic achievement, or strong post-secondary outcomes.

14:02.580 --> 14:07.340
So it needs to demonstrate through verified data, again, measurable increases in academic

14:07.340 --> 14:10.500
achievement or strong post-secondary outcomes.

14:10.500 --> 14:17.060
For our charter school and what we've made this up to make it operational, middle performance

14:17.060 --> 14:22.440
category, seeking renewal, a charter authority must consider clear and convincing evidence

14:22.440 --> 14:27.700
of either measurable outcomes in academic achievement or strong post-secondary outcomes,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.340
which must be demonstrated by verified data.

14:31.300 --> 14:36.700
Again, we've talked a little bit about the prior state board action from November 2020

14:36.700 --> 14:44.420
in which this board adopted 14 academic progress indicators that met the established criteria

14:44.420 --> 14:49.660
and have been used or are to be used in the renewal process.

14:49.660 --> 14:54.100
And just as a note, assessments that are not on the list cannot be used as part of this

14:54.100 --> 14:57.820
verified data process.

14:57.860 --> 15:04.840
So the update before you today is first based on appropriation.

15:04.840 --> 15:11.120
This work is not something that is inherent to civil service or to the work of the California

15:11.120 --> 15:12.780
Department of Education.

15:12.780 --> 15:21.100
And so there was outside advocacy to have this appropriation in the 2022-23 state budget

15:21.100 --> 15:24.140
for the CDE to again contract out this work.

15:24.140 --> 15:30.540
So we have a one-time contract again with WestEd who conducted a review of the new

15:30.540 --> 15:34.500
assessments for the board to consider adding to the list.

15:34.500 --> 15:37.780
And it's important to note there is no ongoing funding for this work.

15:37.780 --> 15:44.420
So if there are additional assessments that you would like to be added in future years,

15:44.420 --> 15:50.460
we would need to go back to find additional funding for that work.

15:50.460 --> 15:56.060
I also wanted to just point out that this is a narrow item, has a very narrow scope.

15:56.060 --> 16:01.300
We were asked through that budget trailer bill to look at adding verified data providers

16:01.300 --> 16:02.300
to the list.

16:02.300 --> 16:08.260
And so you see before you today 10 new academic progress indicators being recommended for

16:08.260 --> 16:10.220
inclusion on that list.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.740
You do not see, we did not explore post-secondary outcomes.

16:12.740 --> 16:17.740
This was limited to the academic progress indicators.

16:18.020 --> 16:24.140
Also, we have been made aware from several different test publishers the need for administrative

16:24.140 --> 16:25.140
changes.

16:25.140 --> 16:26.140
They've changed their name.

16:26.140 --> 16:27.820
They got acquired by somebody else.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.900
They want to add grades behind it.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.860
And so you're going to hear a little bit of explanation again from the WestEd team about

16:33.860 --> 16:38.340
the administrative changes they're recommending to assessments that have been already approved

16:38.340 --> 16:39.980
by the board.

16:39.980 --> 16:48.260
And then finally, we're going to walk through some conforming changes or clarifications

16:48.260 --> 16:54.420
to the criteria to define verified data and the data use procedures.

16:54.420 --> 17:00.740
We were made aware and the original board action in November of 2020 was done in the

17:00.740 --> 17:04.300
context of COVID was going to be over in a couple of weeks or a couple of months.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.020
And of course, things really did drag on.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.180
And so some of the language is outdated and needs to be updated.

17:10.180 --> 17:14.900
And so that is the scope in which we approach the item today and that you're going to hear

17:14.900 --> 17:19.780
from the WestEd team on, again, the engagement with the education advocacy groups in this

17:19.780 --> 17:20.780
regard.

17:20.780 --> 17:23.980
We just wanted to make sure Stephanie is here.

17:23.980 --> 17:28.820
So also, before I turn it over to the WestEd team, I wanted to recognize Stephanie Farlin,

17:28.820 --> 17:34.060
our director of the charter schools division, and her team as well as the team from the

17:34.060 --> 17:37.380
legal division who have been assisting us with this item.

17:37.380 --> 17:41.060
I am very sad that Stephanie's last board meeting is today.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.540
I'm sure you'll hear more about this from others.

17:43.540 --> 17:47.500
But because I have a little bit of time at the podium, I just wanted to recognize she's

17:47.500 --> 17:49.180
been a terrific colleague.

17:49.180 --> 17:55.020
She deals with some very tough issues and has always maintained her composure and professionalism.

17:55.020 --> 18:00.220
And I'm just delighted that we've had some time to work together and that she's supported

18:00.220 --> 18:02.340
me in this item.

18:02.340 --> 18:06.860
So without further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Eric Crane, who will introduce

18:06.860 --> 18:14.220
his colleagues and talk about their work.

18:14.220 --> 18:16.300
Thank you, Director Kazanis.

18:16.300 --> 18:21.740
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods, distinguished board

18:21.740 --> 18:27.500
members, executive director and board staff, and distinguished leaders and staff of the

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
department.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.860
I'm Eric Crane.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.260
I'm a senior researcher at WestEd.

18:33.260 --> 18:38.700
And as someone who's devoted my professional career to the use of data to have improved

18:38.700 --> 18:44.020
discussions about education, about student learning in school and student performance,

18:44.020 --> 18:49.220
it's an honor to be a part of this work.

18:49.220 --> 18:58.100
The work has really focused on four parts, engaging partners and vendors in the verified

18:58.140 --> 19:07.140
data process, delivering an overview of the process for assessment vendors to submit technical

19:07.140 --> 19:13.940
evidence for review, provide updates about the work, such as today's work, and then

19:13.940 --> 19:19.900
ultimately to recommend to the department, who in turn is recommending to you, an expanded

19:19.940 --> 19:28.660
list of valid and reliable assessments for this verified data process.

19:28.660 --> 19:31.340
I want to thank my team at WestEd.

19:31.340 --> 19:36.820
It's been a really interesting collaboration.

19:36.820 --> 19:44.740
We've had folks with expertise in convening, working hand-in-hand with psychometric experts

19:44.820 --> 19:47.340
to look at the assessment.

19:47.340 --> 19:54.500
And it's been also a really interesting process to kind of collaborate with the education

19:54.500 --> 20:01.300
partners in the sense of making sure that the information about this work was disseminated

20:01.300 --> 20:05.940
to both charter schools, the charter school community, and the authorizers community,

20:05.940 --> 20:09.860
and other interested parties.

20:09.860 --> 20:14.580
So I think it'd be helpful to kind of set this in context with the timeline.

20:14.980 --> 20:21.300
I won't hit every line item here, but in 2020, the kind of first round of this work took

20:21.300 --> 20:29.660
place where 14 different assessments were adopted for verified data.

20:29.660 --> 20:35.620
Director Kazanis mentioned the appropriation for some new work to happen, which we launched

20:35.620 --> 20:43.420
at the end of 2022, and we brought together partners to update the work both in January

20:43.460 --> 20:45.020
and March.

20:45.020 --> 20:52.300
Early in this year, we had an assessment landscape survey where we reached out to and got good

20:52.300 --> 20:55.780
feedback from the charter schools in the state.

20:55.780 --> 21:02.340
I think we reached out via the charter schools division's list to every single charter school

21:02.340 --> 21:03.460
in the state.

21:03.460 --> 21:08.940
And as you'll hear, we had a pretty good response, certainly a bigger response than we had in

21:08.940 --> 21:11.340
2020, which I'll just share.

21:11.740 --> 21:17.300
It came as a surprise to me because we had a very big outreach effort in 2020.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.620
And then since then, since the second meeting, and actually before the second meeting had

21:21.620 --> 21:26.920
even happened, we had begun the technical work of reviewing these assessments for validity

21:26.920 --> 21:34.260
and reliability and appropriateness for this verified data purpose.

21:34.260 --> 21:43.820
And then we drafted a memo that was released in April, and of course today the board meeting.

21:43.820 --> 21:47.700
And we do have a hard end date of this project for June 30th.

21:47.700 --> 21:53.060
And as Director Kazanis mentioned, there is no additional funding for work beyond this

21:53.060 --> 21:58.260
or another round of adding more assessments to the verified data list.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.260
But that could change.

21:59.260 --> 22:03.060
That's the current state of play.

22:03.060 --> 22:09.580
So we had, I believe it's 19 different educational partners take part.

22:09.580 --> 22:14.820
I won't read their names, but if you scan the names and organizations, you can see that

22:14.820 --> 22:22.980
they represent a range of interested parties.

22:22.980 --> 22:26.700
And moving to the work itself.

22:26.700 --> 22:32.060
As we went about the work and thinking about the conversations that would happen after

22:32.060 --> 22:40.860
verified data were adopted and in play in renewal conversations, we felt that schools

22:40.860 --> 22:47.220
and authorizers need not be experts in psychometrics to have these discussions, but certainly charter

22:47.220 --> 22:54.340
schools should be able to talk about the conditions under which assessments were administered

22:54.340 --> 22:57.820
and to be able to engage in some discussion about that.

22:57.860 --> 23:04.860
We'll talk a little bit later specifically about the COVID-19 effects on this work and

23:04.860 --> 23:08.740
on some of the questions we asked, data we gathered.

23:08.740 --> 23:15.700
And another point that has to be made is even though we identified assessments for inclusion

23:15.700 --> 23:21.740
or for recommended inclusion on a list, we did not rank or order the assessments to say

23:21.740 --> 23:23.900
this one is better than that one.

23:23.900 --> 23:30.260
And in fact, there are some very strong assessments that do not meet what we were looking for

23:30.260 --> 23:32.180
in this process.

23:32.180 --> 23:38.420
That is to say that they may be very good for, say, diagnostic, but may not be able

23:38.420 --> 23:44.380
to produce one year's growth, which is a requirement of our work, and so they could be left off

23:44.380 --> 23:45.380
the list.

23:45.380 --> 23:49.860
That is not to say that they are poor assessments.

23:49.860 --> 23:54.740
And conversely, there are some assessments that we move forward and recommend because

23:54.740 --> 23:58.940
they did fit the requirements and they would not be appropriate for other contexts and

23:58.940 --> 24:00.300
other purposes.

24:00.300 --> 24:06.420
So no attempt was made to rank or order these assessments.

24:06.420 --> 24:11.420
I want to turn it over to my colleague, the Deputy Project Director, Kelly Weinveen, who's

24:11.420 --> 24:14.420
going to walk you through the next few slides.

24:19.860 --> 24:24.460
Good morning.

24:24.460 --> 24:25.460
My name's Kelly Weinveen.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.740
I'm with WestEd and serve as the Deputy Project Director.

24:29.740 --> 24:34.620
So as Eric stated, the assessments that were adopted by the State Board in 2020 were not

24:34.620 --> 24:39.540
subject to a new review process and they remained on the verified data list.

24:39.540 --> 24:44.660
And we still contacted all publishers who had an assessment on the 2020 list to request

24:45.540 --> 24:50.740
to see if the assessment had substantially changed and we would need to re-review.

24:50.740 --> 24:55.980
This communication also invited existing publishers to inform WestEd if there were any administrative

24:55.980 --> 25:03.580
changes such as a name change, which we communicated out and asked all existing publishers for.

25:03.580 --> 25:07.660
For all other publishers, the request for the information process neared exactly what

25:07.660 --> 25:13.180
we did in 2020.

25:13.180 --> 25:18.060
So as part of the 2023 work related to this project, one of the first things we did was

25:18.060 --> 25:23.080
create a charter school assessment survey that was modeled after a similar survey we

25:23.080 --> 25:25.260
sent during the 2020 work.

25:25.260 --> 25:29.100
And we did this to ask charter schools in the state of California, what assessments

25:29.100 --> 25:31.080
are you using currently?

25:31.080 --> 25:35.240
So this survey was intended to gather a broad understanding of what assessment schools are

25:35.240 --> 25:40.100
currently using, which would then inform our outreach to test publishers who might want

25:40.420 --> 25:43.380
be included on the verified data list.

25:43.380 --> 25:47.820
As Eric mentioned, we partnered with CDE's charter school division and also with our

25:47.820 --> 25:52.300
education partners to disseminate the survey to charter schools across the state.

25:52.300 --> 25:58.940
And we received a total of 388 responses, which was a 20% increase compared to the 2020

25:58.940 --> 26:01.060
work we did.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.980
Based on responses from charter schools, the WestEd team analyzed these responses and we

26:04.980 --> 26:10.420
identified 46 assessments that were mentioned by at least one school in the state as currently

26:10.420 --> 26:13.540
being in use.

26:13.540 --> 26:19.140
So in late January 2023 then, WestEd invited publishers from all 46 assessments that were

26:19.140 --> 26:22.940
mentioned to submit evidence for our review.

26:22.940 --> 26:27.380
Publishers who already had an assessment on our adopted indicators list were also contacted,

26:27.380 --> 26:32.380
as I mentioned, to see if their assessment had substantially changed since our review

26:32.380 --> 26:34.780
was done in 2020.

26:34.780 --> 26:38.820
Every publisher received three emails and an individual phone call if no response was

26:38.820 --> 26:42.900
received between January 31st and February 14th.

26:42.900 --> 26:47.860
And if requested, extensions were granted to publishers who may have needed more time.

26:47.860 --> 26:52.460
WestEd received submissions of evidence from publishers regarding 23 different assessments.

26:52.460 --> 26:59.420
And of those 23 assessments, 18 were new assessments and five were requests for administrative changes

26:59.660 --> 27:07.140
such as NWEA requested their name change from map to map growth or for others also requested

27:07.140 --> 27:11.220
administrative changes.

27:11.220 --> 27:15.580
The technical review process for the 18 new assessments mirrored the process that we conducted

27:15.580 --> 27:17.420
in 2020.

27:17.420 --> 27:22.780
WestEd staff with backgrounds in psychometric expertise conducted all reviews and this graphic

27:22.780 --> 27:27.660
here on this slide shows an overview of that review process.

27:27.660 --> 27:32.540
All assessments went through an initial review, a phase one review of technical quality, and

27:32.540 --> 27:38.580
a phase two review of performance standards, and then a final review which led to our recommendations.

27:38.580 --> 27:42.500
The initial review was done to ensure that publishers submitted technical information

27:42.500 --> 27:47.140
that would provide suitable evidence for the review in phase one and two.

27:47.140 --> 27:52.980
Of the 18 assessments that were submitted, initially 10 did not submit sufficient information

27:52.980 --> 27:56.820
and we requested additional information from those publishers.

27:56.980 --> 28:00.620
At this stage in the process, there was one assessment that was identified by reviewers

28:00.620 --> 28:04.740
as not aligned with the intended purposes of this review.

28:04.740 --> 28:09.500
Then in phase one, the WestEd team evaluated the technical quality of these 17 assessments

28:09.500 --> 28:14.940
to determine if they were evidence-based, valid, reliable, and standards aligned.

28:14.940 --> 28:19.540
11 of the assessments met the requirements of our phase one review.

28:19.540 --> 28:24.080
In phase two, reviewers rated whether there was a clear process for calculating one year's

28:24.120 --> 28:29.440
growth from assessment data and 10 of the 11 assessments met the standard.

28:29.440 --> 28:34.680
A no anywhere in this review process would stop the process of the review for that particular assessment.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.680
As stated, evidence was submitted to WestEd regarding 23 assessments in total and all

28:41.680 --> 28:44.720
evidence submitted was reviewed by WestEd staff.

28:44.720 --> 28:49.640
There were three WestEd team members who had technical experience and psychometric expertise.

28:49.640 --> 28:53.800
They all completed independent reviews and a fourth team member was brought in to serve

28:53.800 --> 28:56.880
as a resolution reviewer when needed.

28:56.880 --> 29:01.160
All raters were trained on the rubric, which was originally developed by WestEd experts

29:01.160 --> 29:07.080
in 2020 and those assessments that met all 57 item rankings in this rubric were recommended

29:07.080 --> 29:09.680
as additions to the approved list.

29:09.680 --> 29:14.440
For each assessment, these two reviewers were assigned to rate its technical evidence independently.

29:14.440 --> 29:19.080
They were not able to see each other's completed reviews and after the two independent reviews

29:19.080 --> 29:23.160
were complete, reviewers discussed and reconciled any differences.

29:23.520 --> 29:30.520
If needed, a resolution reviewer was brought in to issue a final rating for that assessment.

29:30.520 --> 29:35.360
As Eric mentioned, it should also be noted that if we did not recommend assessment as

29:35.360 --> 29:39.800
verified data, that does not imply that the assessment is without merit.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.840
Many assessments that were reviewed were noted by reviewers as strong assessments, but they

29:43.840 --> 29:46.840
may have not met the purposes for use as verified data.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.840
I'll turn it back over to my colleague Eric to continue.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.840
Thanks, Kelly.

29:57.840 --> 30:04.840
So, what did the reviewers consider?

30:04.840 --> 30:09.600
The reviewers looked through the technical material provided by the assessment publishers

30:09.600 --> 30:14.720
and looked for things like scientific theoretical base of the assessment, the alignment of the

30:14.720 --> 30:20.760
assessment to California Common Core standards, criterion validity construct, validity, reliability,

30:20.760 --> 30:29.760
and evidence of appropriateness for all students, including student groups.

30:29.760 --> 30:37.720
If the assessment published a Spanish language version or paper and pencil version, the technical

30:37.720 --> 30:45.560
material was reviewed to check for equivalency and the quality of those materials, bias and

30:45.560 --> 30:53.080
fairness was looked at, and information about how to administer the test.

30:53.080 --> 30:58.320
For this, I want to do a call-out in reference that we did ask different questions.

30:58.320 --> 31:04.480
We changed the rubric slightly for 2023 to check and see if there was any special guidance

31:04.480 --> 31:10.280
for administration during the time of COVID, as we know that that did change administration

31:10.280 --> 31:13.760
of these assessments in general.

31:13.760 --> 31:21.520
What administration support did they provide regarding COVID test administration?

31:21.520 --> 31:29.200
These last four, lastly, the materials were reviewed for information about accessibility,

31:29.200 --> 31:36.400
how the test was scored, and what reporting looked like, security, and data privacy.

31:37.000 --> 31:48.040
With that as the rubric, we rated the assessments, and these are the recommended assessments

31:48.040 --> 31:53.440
in the legislation they're referred to as academic progress indicators.

31:53.440 --> 32:02.400
Achieve 3000, ACT, AIMS Web+, Developmental Reading Assessment, Third Edition, Exact Path,

32:02.440 --> 32:09.760
iReady Assessments 912, iStations Indicators of Progress, iExcel Real-Time Diagnostic,

32:09.760 --> 32:17.960
Math and ELA, Pre-ACT and Pre-ACT 8-9, and Test of English Language Learning.

32:17.960 --> 32:33.160
For those publishers that already had an assessment on the verified data list, we'd also reached

32:33.160 --> 32:40.360
out to them and asked if their assessments had changed materially, and most of them replied

32:40.360 --> 32:46.560
that their assessments did not change, but there were some administrative changes.

32:46.560 --> 32:52.360
As my colleague Kelly just mentioned, a lot of them were about name changes or including

32:52.360 --> 32:55.680
the grade for more clarity.

32:55.680 --> 33:02.960
For example, NWA's Measures of Academic Progress, NWA now would like that assessment to be referred

33:02.960 --> 33:06.400
to as MAP Growth.

33:06.400 --> 33:11.840
You see the others here, College Board requested an administrative change, and Houghton Mifflin

33:11.840 --> 33:18.560
Harcourt with Math Inventory and Reading Inventory requested a name change.

33:18.560 --> 33:24.280
These did not need much of a review, they were just administrative changes, and we recommend

33:24.280 --> 33:31.520
those name changes as well as the inclusion of grade levels for all of the assessments.

33:31.520 --> 33:38.040
Needs to be re-emphasized that there is not a process for this to happen going into the

33:38.040 --> 33:39.280
future.

33:39.280 --> 33:46.280
If assessment publishers change their names, the current processes, the assessments named

33:46.280 --> 33:54.280
on the department's website reflect the verified data list.

33:54.280 --> 34:02.680
These are the 14 assessments that were previously on the list, approved in 2020, now edited

34:02.680 --> 34:15.200
and amended to show their grade, and that includes also the updated name changes.

34:15.200 --> 34:23.000
Those are the 14 that are there, they're in the item as well.

34:23.000 --> 34:28.740
There were a couple of things that came up in the process of the survey.

34:28.740 --> 34:36.420
With 388 schools responding to the assessment landscape survey, and 46 different assessments

34:36.420 --> 34:45.340
identified, there was also a couple of things that were identified, mentioned in open-ended

34:45.340 --> 34:50.380
items that we dug in a little deeper on, and concluded that they were not assessments per

34:50.380 --> 34:53.940
se, and outside of what we could consider.

34:53.940 --> 34:58.940
They're in a sense approaches to using data.

34:58.940 --> 35:03.200
The first of these was the Lexile-Quantile framework, this was mentioned by a number

35:03.200 --> 35:05.380
of survey respondents.

35:05.380 --> 35:12.660
For some assessments that use this framework, there's a separate score, a Lexile or a Quantile,

35:12.660 --> 35:18.320
on the reading and math assessments respectively, that permits comparison across different assessments

35:18.400 --> 35:20.760
that use the same framework.

35:20.760 --> 35:27.600
It was not for us to approve Lexile-Quantile, because it was not an assessment.

35:27.600 --> 35:33.560
Similarly, we heard from respondents about Core Student Growth Percentile methodology.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.360
Likewise, this is not an assessment.

35:36.360 --> 35:44.240
Core SGP uses CASP data and repurposes it in a novel way.

35:44.240 --> 35:50.440
As with Lexile-Quantile, Core is not an assessment to be approved, but rather a way of using

35:50.440 --> 35:56.520
the underlying data.

35:56.520 --> 36:01.040
I mentioned earlier how COVID impacted the work, I wanted to go into a little more detail

36:01.040 --> 36:04.400
with this slide.

36:04.400 --> 36:07.600
COVID considerations affected the work in these ways.

36:07.600 --> 36:15.560
We changed our request to publishers and asked for additional information about administration.

36:15.560 --> 36:25.600
We also asked if the fact of COVID changed how scores should be interpreted, and at least

36:25.600 --> 36:32.160
one publisher did make a slight adjustment to what they thought a typical year's growth

36:32.160 --> 36:33.160
was.

36:33.800 --> 36:38.120
It's detailed in the item.

36:38.120 --> 36:47.680
We had reviewed the criteria to define, verify data and data use procedures, and that changed

36:47.680 --> 36:52.760
as well in the sense of we wanted to make sure that the wording of those criteria and

36:52.760 --> 36:59.000
data use procedures reflected the reality of COVID.

36:59.040 --> 37:06.440
We ultimately added another statement about paying attention to publisher guidance about

37:06.440 --> 37:09.720
administering and interpreting results.

37:09.720 --> 37:15.280
Those were the four main ways that COVID influenced the work.

37:15.280 --> 37:20.640
The long presentation, so at this time I wanted to just pause and see if there were questions

37:20.640 --> 37:24.960
or comments from the board, and if not, I can go on and go into some of the detail about

37:25.040 --> 37:29.880
the criteria to define, verify data and data use procedures.

37:29.880 --> 37:35.040
Are there any clarifying questions at this time?

37:35.040 --> 37:37.040
Please proceed.

37:45.040 --> 37:53.000
So as part of the work we did in 2020, we looked at criteria to define, verify data

37:53.000 --> 37:54.920
and data use procedures.

37:54.920 --> 38:01.400
These were essentially supporting guardrails about how the assessment information was to

38:01.400 --> 38:03.520
be used.

38:03.520 --> 38:08.400
We expected at the start of the work that these would just roll forward, but we heard

38:08.400 --> 38:14.680
loud and clear from the education partners that these two deserved more scrutiny, and

38:14.680 --> 38:19.760
so I'll talk a little bit about the changes.

38:19.760 --> 38:28.360
Back in 2020, we heard about the need for this guidance to use the data correctly, and

38:28.360 --> 38:32.760
that became the basis for these criteria and data use procedures.

38:32.760 --> 38:37.400
As part of the 2020 board action, there were five criteria and nine data use procedures

38:37.400 --> 38:39.200
adopted.

38:39.200 --> 38:43.460
For completeness, they're all in here again, but I'm going to spend my focus on just those

38:43.460 --> 38:49.080
that have changes.

38:49.080 --> 38:57.240
So the technical review was at the heart of our work, but the comments and feedback that

38:57.240 --> 39:06.400
we got caused us to really drill down on the criteria and data use procedures as well,

39:06.400 --> 39:14.440
and ultimately there was a lot of discussion about participation, security, longitudinal

39:14.840 --> 39:23.120
progress, and pandemic natural disaster considerations, and again, I'll detail this right now.

39:23.120 --> 39:29.720
So stepping through the five criteria to define verified data, data eligibility was the first.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.520
There are no changes here.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.680
Participation has a change.

39:34.680 --> 39:41.920
You can see the current language on the left side and the recommended language on the right

39:41.920 --> 39:44.520
side.

39:44.520 --> 39:49.200
The core of the information there is the same, but then at the end, it's recommended to

39:49.200 --> 39:54.400
include a note consistent with the U.S. Department of Education's flexibility for state accountability

39:54.400 --> 39:58.080
purposes in 2019-20 and 2020-21.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.020
The 95 participation rate requirement should not apply in those years.

40:02.020 --> 40:09.040
So it's really about kind of truing up or making comparable the guidance that applied

40:09.160 --> 40:14.680
to non-charter schools and bringing that to the charter schools as well.

40:14.680 --> 40:21.760
So that's the recommended language change on the participation criterion.

40:21.760 --> 40:25.640
Disaggregation, no change there.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.920
Student groups, no change there.

40:28.920 --> 40:36.240
And the final criterion, the methodology, no change there, consistent with the recommendations

40:36.240 --> 40:38.840
adopted in 2020.

40:39.640 --> 40:43.400
On the data use procedures, there are nine of them, and a number of them have no changes,

40:43.400 --> 40:46.560
but we'll spend a little more time on those that do.

40:46.560 --> 40:50.600
Flexibility, no change there.

40:50.600 --> 40:58.280
There is no requirement to use a particular source of verified data.

40:58.280 --> 41:04.960
Multiple measures are an option that the school may present, and then the chartering authority

41:05.080 --> 41:08.200
may consider, so no change there.

41:08.200 --> 41:15.520
Transparency, the idea that it should be clear to all parties in the discussion what the

41:15.520 --> 41:21.240
data are, what they mean, what they say, no change there.

41:21.240 --> 41:28.520
Security, so for this we do have a change in the language, a proposed change, and that

41:28.520 --> 41:34.880
is just to call out explicitly if there was any special administration guidance related

41:34.880 --> 41:38.120
to COVID.

41:38.120 --> 41:44.480
And you can see that there in the red text.

41:44.480 --> 41:49.080
Procedure number five, longitudinal progress.

41:49.080 --> 41:55.440
It seemed important to elevate for the schools and authorizers that guidance on interpreting

41:55.440 --> 42:00.480
one year's growth should come from the publisher.

42:00.480 --> 42:08.560
There's really no way to say globally these assessments vary so widely, so one statement

42:08.560 --> 42:15.320
about how progress is going to look just would not be appropriate, so we've said that anyway,

42:15.320 --> 42:20.820
but this sort of strengthens it that the publisher is the best source of information about interpreting

42:20.980 --> 42:27.980
one year's growth and that they're published information about one year's growth.

42:30.060 --> 42:36.660
Procedure six, differences from CASP, no change there.

42:36.660 --> 42:43.660
Procedure seven, comparability, I think relates to post-secondary, no change there.

42:44.620 --> 42:51.620
Procedure eight, referring to using CASP data, no change in the language there.

42:55.860 --> 43:02.860
And finally, a recommended change to the language in procedure nine, just to make it more defined

43:04.180 --> 43:10.380
and precise, that we're talking about presenting evidence of learning disruptions due to the

43:10.380 --> 43:15.100
pandemic or natural disasters that resulted in school closures.

43:15.100 --> 43:21.340
So I think that the intent there is to give it more precision about what kinds of contexts

43:21.340 --> 43:28.340
procedure nine is referring to.

43:28.420 --> 43:35.420
So our remaining work, our remaining project work on this is to work with the department

43:36.420 --> 43:41.420
and, as appropriate, with board staff to talk about what happens today and making sure that

43:41.420 --> 43:44.420
that's communicated to the field.

43:44.420 --> 43:51.420
The department, as a result of the 2020 work, did a frequency asked questions list and we'll

43:51.420 --> 43:55.420
support them in refining, revising that.

43:55.420 --> 44:01.420
If there are any questions that come from the test publisher community, we'll support

44:01.420 --> 44:02.420
the department in that.

44:03.420 --> 44:08.420
And again, this project does have that hard stop on June 30th, and I think that's important

44:08.420 --> 44:13.420
to underscore as well.

44:13.420 --> 44:16.420
With that, Director Gazzanis, I'll turn it back to you.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.420
Thank you, Eric.

44:18.420 --> 44:24.420
So the recommendation before you today, again, is to approve the recommendations contained

44:24.420 --> 44:29.420
in attachment one, updating the criteria to define verified data, updating the data use

44:29.420 --> 44:34.420
procedures related to verified data, and finally, updating the data, excuse me, updating

44:34.420 --> 44:38.420
the academic progress indicators for inclusion within the verified data list.

44:38.420 --> 44:45.420
And with that, I would turn it back to President Darling-Hammond for next steps.

44:45.420 --> 44:49.420
Are you ready for any clarifying questions?

44:49.420 --> 44:50.420
Sure.

44:50.420 --> 44:53.420
This is the end of the presentation from the department.

44:53.420 --> 45:00.420
Well, we are going to put on the public comment slide and the phone line will be open for

45:00.420 --> 45:02.420
public comment.

45:02.420 --> 45:08.420
There will be public comment both in person and on the line, and we want to be sure that

45:08.420 --> 45:14.420
people are queued up for the telephone line with that phone number and access code as

45:14.420 --> 45:15.420
noted.

45:15.420 --> 45:21.420
And while we're waiting, we'll call on our liaison, Vice President Glover-Woods, to see

45:21.420 --> 45:23.420
if she has any initial comments.

45:23.420 --> 45:28.420
I will make a few, and if there are clarifying questions, we can get those in.

45:28.420 --> 45:31.420
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and good morning to everyone.

45:31.420 --> 45:37.420
I just would like to share and really just express my appreciation for the work that

45:37.420 --> 45:45.420
has been done to really consider any assessment necessary for the verified data list.

45:45.420 --> 45:52.420
The process that was used by WestEd and in conjunction with CDE, I think, really showed

45:52.420 --> 45:59.420
an opportunity for any assessments that should be considered for review, for that to happen.

45:59.420 --> 46:05.420
And again, I'd like to say thank you very much for even extending to certain publishers

46:05.420 --> 46:11.420
additional time to request information or provide information if you had not heard from

46:11.420 --> 46:12.420
them.

46:12.420 --> 46:17.420
I feel very confident that any assessment that should have been considered in this review

46:17.420 --> 46:20.420
has had opportunity to be considered.

46:20.420 --> 46:22.420
So thank you very much for that.

46:22.420 --> 46:29.420
And also in looking at the considerations as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic and

46:29.420 --> 46:34.420
natural disasters and the impact that that does have on school closures as well in bringing

46:34.420 --> 46:36.420
that into the fold also.

46:36.420 --> 46:40.420
So my comments, President Darling-Hammond, really just anchored themselves in gratitude

46:40.420 --> 46:42.420
for the process that was used.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.420
Thank you.

46:43.420 --> 46:45.420
Thank you very much.

46:45.420 --> 46:50.420
And as you may have intuited, there's both the approval of the list, the verified data

46:50.420 --> 46:56.420
list, and what charter schools can use in their presentations, and also the ways in

46:56.420 --> 47:02.420
which they must administer the assessments, et cetera.

47:02.420 --> 47:06.420
So we have gotten a lot of written comments, and based on those, I've been thinking a little

47:07.420 --> 47:11.420
about how to address some of those concerns that have been raised in the written comments,

47:11.420 --> 47:13.420
and we'll come back to that later.

47:13.420 --> 47:18.420
But I also want to express my gratitude on the fast timeline and with the carefulness

47:18.420 --> 47:24.420
that our WestEd team and our CDE team have approved this verified data list so that it

47:24.420 --> 47:27.420
can be available again this year.

47:27.420 --> 47:35.420
Are there any clarifying comments or questions that people have before we go to public comment?

47:35.420 --> 47:36.420
All right.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.420
We are so clear.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.420
Thank you, Cindy.

47:41.420 --> 47:49.420
And we'll go then to any public comment speakers signed up in person.

47:49.420 --> 47:51.420
Yes, there are three people signed up.

47:51.420 --> 48:02.420
All right.

48:02.420 --> 48:08.420
Elizabeth Robitaille.

48:08.420 --> 48:14.420
I'll try again.

48:14.420 --> 48:20.420
Okay, thank you.

48:20.420 --> 48:25.420
Elizabeth Robitaille, Chief Schools Officer for the California Charter Schools Association.

48:25.420 --> 48:30.420
Verified data provides a crucial opportunity for charter schools to present evidence of

48:30.420 --> 48:32.420
student success at time of renewal.

48:32.420 --> 48:37.420
However, it was never the intent to set up a system where the California school dashboard

48:37.420 --> 48:43.420
and its vast array of indicators would be insufficient evidence to support renewal determinations

48:43.420 --> 48:46.420
for all but a small handful of high-track schools.

48:46.420 --> 48:52.420
We urge the State Board to clarify that verified data is intended to be a helpful supplement

48:52.420 --> 48:58.420
for schools who need it, not a mandatory requirement for all charter schools identified in the

48:58.420 --> 49:01.420
default renewal, the middle track.

49:01.420 --> 49:05.420
For middle-track schools, including verified data in their renewal petitions,

49:05.420 --> 49:11.420
Ed Code requires authorizers to consider not dismiss this verified data when evaluating

49:11.420 --> 49:15.420
school performance against the criteria governing a charter's renewal.

49:15.420 --> 49:21.420
Verified data is intended to support charter's renewals where supplementary evidence is helpful,

49:21.420 --> 49:24.420
not to impose an additional mandate for all.

49:24.420 --> 49:28.420
We ask the State Board to clarify this point of confusion for charter schools and authorizers.

49:28.420 --> 49:29.420
Thank you.

49:32.420 --> 49:33.420
Eric Premack.

49:38.420 --> 49:40.420
Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and members.

49:40.420 --> 49:42.420
Eric Premack with the Charter Schools Center.

49:42.420 --> 49:47.420
In the interest of time, I'll associate myself with the comments that we've made in our coalition

49:47.420 --> 49:52.420
letter, but I wanted to up the periscope a little bit here because nothing galvanizes

49:52.420 --> 49:56.420
one's attention in the charter sector like the life and death of schools that hinge on

49:56.420 --> 49:58.420
the use of this data.

49:58.420 --> 50:03.420
Where the larger system has departed from what many of you have referred to as the old test

50:03.420 --> 50:10.420
and punish system, the charter system instead has upped the stakes, in my humble opinion,

50:10.420 --> 50:14.420
inappropriately so, but we have to deal with the cards that were dealt.

50:14.420 --> 50:18.420
And given these very high stakes, we think it's really important that we have the best

50:18.420 --> 50:24.420
possible range of assessments and verified data criteria, including all the ones that we

50:24.420 --> 50:26.420
listed in their letter.

50:26.420 --> 50:32.420
Thus, I urge you to consider all of them very seriously and to continue the work on this.

50:32.420 --> 50:38.420
And also to put it kind of bluntly, we think it's also in the Board's best interest to avoid

50:38.420 --> 50:45.420
problematic data use, particularly if it turns into a large number of appeals and gums up your

50:45.420 --> 50:47.420
work going forward.

50:47.420 --> 50:49.420
Thank you.

50:49.420 --> 50:51.420
Nicholas Watson.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.420
Good morning, members of the Board.

50:57.420 --> 51:00.420
My name is Nicholas Watson from the California Charter Schools Association.

51:00.420 --> 51:05.420
I just wanted to thank the members of CDE staff and West Ed that put in a lot of time on this

51:05.420 --> 51:07.420
big important policy matter.

51:07.420 --> 51:10.420
I also wanted to thank the five charter school leaders who are part of the work group.

51:10.420 --> 51:14.420
Those charter school leaders, of course, represent a much larger group of charter schools with

51:14.420 --> 51:16.420
similar concerns.

51:16.420 --> 51:20.420
We will in the next few years have more than 500 charter schools coming up for renewal.

51:20.420 --> 51:24.420
And these verified data policy matters are of critical importance to them.

51:24.420 --> 51:29.420
We submitted a letter, CCSA submitted a letter signed jointly by more than 90 charter schools

51:29.420 --> 51:33.420
outlining our requested additional changes to the policy recommendations.

51:33.420 --> 51:37.420
We hope the Board will seriously consider adopting those recommendations.

51:37.420 --> 51:39.420
Thank you.

51:40.420 --> 51:44.420
Any other in person?

51:44.420 --> 51:47.420
How about phone comments?

51:47.420 --> 51:50.420
Yes, we have 12 callers in the queue.

51:50.420 --> 51:52.420
I will open the phone line now.

51:52.420 --> 51:56.420
Let me remind folks to please remember to turn down the speaker volume of your computer.

51:56.420 --> 52:00.420
If you are following the live feed, speakers are limited to one minute each.

52:00.420 --> 52:04.420
But where speakers require interpretation, two minutes will be provided.

52:04.420 --> 52:08.420
Good morning, State Board of Education.

52:08.420 --> 52:10.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

52:10.420 --> 52:14.420
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

52:14.420 --> 52:18.420
Skylar Davis on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

52:18.420 --> 52:23.420
Under AB 1505, verified data is scheduled to sunset in 2026.

52:23.420 --> 52:28.420
We respectfully request that the State Board support eliminating the sunset on verified data.

52:28.420 --> 52:32.420
And acknowledging that charters in many states live or die based on public measures alone,

52:32.420 --> 52:35.420
we applaud the state for being an advocate for multiple measures.

52:35.420 --> 52:39.420
However, failure to protect the use of this at renewal in the form of verified data

52:39.420 --> 52:43.420
would prevent us from upholding meaningful robust accountability for charters.

52:43.420 --> 52:47.420
As we saw during the pandemic, schools relied on such internal assessments

52:47.420 --> 52:51.420
and post-secondary outcomes to appropriately measure student progress.

52:51.420 --> 52:55.420
As we transition out of the pandemic, this will continue to be important

52:55.420 --> 53:00.420
in more precisely identifying an LEA's strengths, growth areas, and gaps between student learners.

53:00.420 --> 53:05.420
Therefore, authorizers should continue to be required to consider verified data

53:05.420 --> 53:09.420
to fully grasp which LEAs are meeting the needs of the students they serve.

53:09.420 --> 53:13.420
Thank you. Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

53:13.420 --> 53:17.420
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

53:17.420 --> 53:22.420
Hi, this is Suzanne Cooey from the Charter Schools Development Center.

53:22.420 --> 53:27.420
Thank you, members of the board. We strongly recommend a few edits to wording.

53:27.420 --> 53:31.420
We all know schools can score low on the dashboard but be high growth.

53:31.420 --> 53:38.420
To spot those schools, core growth data is the best and really only available longitudinal method

53:38.420 --> 53:42.420
to spot high growth in the most challenged schools.

53:42.420 --> 53:48.420
Unclear wording of Data Use Procedure 8, though, has made authorizers think it may not be allowable.

53:48.420 --> 53:51.420
That should be an easy edit.

53:51.420 --> 53:55.420
Also, most publishers don't have student group analytics

53:55.420 --> 53:59.420
and have told us that forcing student group reporting from their data

53:59.420 --> 54:03.420
would be an unsound basis to close schools.

54:03.420 --> 54:09.420
They were not consulted on that criterion, and that's also an important and easy edit.

54:09.420 --> 54:12.420
Publishers warn against the misuse of their data and school accountability

54:12.420 --> 54:16.420
if not properly interpreted in context.

54:16.420 --> 54:21.420
Giving authorizers some discretion to flex such as, just based on context, for example,

54:21.420 --> 54:26.420
if there's evidence that 95% is just missed slightly, maybe not four,

54:26.420 --> 54:31.420
and no evidence that there's overscoring students.

54:31.420 --> 54:35.420
So these modest, reasonable edits can better guide authorizers towards sound data use.

54:35.420 --> 54:36.420
Thank you.

54:36.420 --> 54:37.420
Thank you.

54:37.420 --> 54:39.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

54:39.420 --> 54:44.420
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

54:44.420 --> 54:48.420
Michael Garner, Director of Data Analytics at Green Dot Public Schools.

54:48.420 --> 54:55.420
Data Use Procedure 8 should explicitly name core growth data as an allowable methodology.

54:55.420 --> 55:00.420
Green Dot's mission is oriented to serving students who come in far behind grade level.

55:00.420 --> 55:06.420
Core shows that some of our schools are growing students over 90% more than similar schools,

55:06.420 --> 55:09.420
but they still achieve low status on the California dashboard

55:09.420 --> 55:12.420
because they're just starting out so far behind.

55:12.420 --> 55:15.420
Without core SGP, this growth is invisible.

55:15.420 --> 55:20.420
Core needs to be explicitly identified because as Data Use Procedure 8 is currently written,

55:20.420 --> 55:23.420
authorizers may think they cannot use any growth methodology.

55:23.420 --> 55:30.420
It says methodologies should not be restricted to the manner of the dashboard and the CAST reporting website.

55:30.420 --> 55:33.420
But these sites neither provide nor enable growth methodology.

55:33.420 --> 55:38.420
Explicit inclusion of core will ensure schools like ours have a path to show growth.

55:38.420 --> 55:39.420
Thank you.

55:39.420 --> 55:40.420
Thank you.

55:40.420 --> 55:43.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

55:43.420 --> 55:44.420
Give one minute.

55:44.420 --> 55:45.420
Your time starts now.

55:48.420 --> 55:50.420
Hello, State Board of Education members.

55:50.420 --> 55:55.420
My name is Lorraine Richards and I am a classroom teacher representing the California Teacher Association.

55:55.420 --> 56:00.420
CTA co-signed a coalition letter with Alameda County Office of Education,

56:00.420 --> 56:09.420
ACSA, California County Superintendent, CFP, CSBA, CSBA, and LACO that supports the CBA's recommended actions

56:09.420 --> 56:14.420
to adopt additional assessments and the revised data use criteria and procedures.

56:14.420 --> 56:21.420
The recommended data to the criteria to define verified data on page 6 of the item is clear

56:21.420 --> 56:28.420
and ensures alignment with flexibility offered to all public schools for the 19-20-20-21 school year.

56:28.420 --> 56:35.420
The recommended data to the data use procedures on the pages 8 and 9 are appropriate

56:35.420 --> 56:41.420
to allow authorizers to consider the impact of pandemic on learning while not undermining the entire process

56:41.420 --> 56:45.420
of verified data as laid out in AB 1505.

56:45.420 --> 56:50.420
Additionally, the sunset date of January 1st, 2026 for verified data,

56:50.420 --> 56:54.420
these recommendations are logical and will help the implementation in the near future.

56:54.420 --> 56:55.420
Thank you.

56:55.420 --> 56:56.420
Thank you.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

56:58.420 --> 56:59.420
You have one minute.

56:59.420 --> 57:00.420
Your time starts now.

57:00.420 --> 57:01.420
Good morning.

57:01.420 --> 57:05.420
This is Mary Cox, Executive Director, Superintendent of Poor Butte Charter School.

57:05.420 --> 57:10.420
I join charter colleagues in thanking the State Board for your consideration to promote fair

57:10.420 --> 57:15.420
and accurate use of student growth data, including through Verify Data Criteria Number 4

57:15.420 --> 57:18.420
and Data Use Procedure Number 6.

57:18.420 --> 57:22.420
Both need amendments to only require student group growth reporting

57:22.420 --> 57:25.420
for assessments that offer student group analytics.

57:26.420 --> 57:30.420
When publishers do not provide student group data,

57:30.420 --> 57:33.420
charter schools must independently calculate growth rates.

57:33.420 --> 57:38.420
This is analytically complex, costly, and could yield inaccurate and consistent

57:38.420 --> 57:41.420
and unfair representations of subgroup growth.

57:41.420 --> 57:46.420
Also, interpreting the data without student group analytics can lead to misunderstanding

57:46.420 --> 57:49.420
of school quality, especially for the most challenged schools.

57:50.420 --> 57:54.420
Mending Number 4 and 6 is critical to prevent unsound evaluation

57:54.420 --> 57:56.420
of student group performance in charter renewals.

57:56.420 --> 57:57.420
Thank you.

57:57.420 --> 57:58.420
Thank you.

57:58.420 --> 58:00.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

58:00.420 --> 58:01.420
You have one minute.

58:01.420 --> 58:02.420
Your time starts now.

58:08.420 --> 58:11.420
Caller, with the last four digits, 8454, you are now live.

58:11.420 --> 58:13.420
Please start your public comment.

58:13.420 --> 58:18.420
Okay.

58:18.420 --> 58:19.420
We're going to move on.

58:23.420 --> 58:26.420
Caller, with the last four digits, 2726, you are now live.

58:26.420 --> 58:27.420
Please start your public comment.

58:38.420 --> 58:42.420
Caller, with the last four digits, 5740, you are now live.

58:42.420 --> 58:43.420
Please start your public comment.

58:45.420 --> 58:46.420
Good morning.

58:46.420 --> 58:49.420
My name is Tim Tutor, and I'm the Executive Director of Alta Schools.

58:49.420 --> 58:55.420
We appreciate that Data Use Procedure 9 addresses the pandemic and natural disasters,

58:55.420 --> 58:57.420
but the language is not actionable.

58:57.420 --> 59:03.420
It merely indicates that charter schools may present evidence of learning disruptions.

59:03.420 --> 59:05.420
This is not substantive.

59:05.420 --> 59:09.420
What matters is that renewal consider impacts on student growth.

59:09.420 --> 59:16.420
Data Use Procedure 9 should say evaluation of growth data should consider evidence of learning disruptions.

59:16.420 --> 59:20.420
Impacted schools may have slower growth for valid reasons.

59:20.420 --> 59:26.420
If schools land on the denial track due to chronic absenteeism averaging 30 percent last year,

59:26.420 --> 59:29.420
unprecedented staffing shortage, and developmental delays,

59:29.420 --> 59:34.420
authorizers should have the discretion to consider those impacts and not be forced to close the school.

59:34.420 --> 59:35.420
Thank you.

59:35.420 --> 59:36.420
Thank you.

59:36.420 --> 59:38.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

59:38.420 --> 59:39.420
You have one minute.

59:39.420 --> 59:40.420
Your time starts now.

59:44.420 --> 59:45.420
Hi.

59:45.420 --> 59:49.420
This is Hillary Harmsen, Chief Growth Officer with KIPP Public Schools Northern California.

59:49.420 --> 59:57.420
I want to thank the State Board, CDE, and WestEd for their really important work to ensure verified data are fair and reasonable for both charter schools and authorizers.

59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.420
I joined charter colleagues in recommending the addition of a tense data use procedure.

01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:05.420
While authorizers may request data as part of annual oversight and monitoring,

01:00:05.420 --> 01:00:11.420
verified data as outlined in this item should not impose additional administrative burdens other than required by law,

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:15.420
nor prompt an unnecessary level of detail concerning student assessment.

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:19.420
To ensure equitable and consistent evaluation of charter schools across the state,

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:26.420
we recommend clarifying that authorizers should not require verified data from charter schools as part of annual oversight and monitoring,

01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:33.420
nor should they require access to assessment portals to directly verify reports and individual student data,

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:38.420
and finally, they should not require submission of reports not provided by the publisher.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.420
Thank you very much.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.420
Thank you.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:43.420
You have one minute.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.420
Your time starts now.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:51.420
Hi, Kayla Rodriguez, Superintendent of Meadows Union School District,

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.420
and I sit on the State Board for Small Schools Districts Association.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:01.420
Small school districts may renewal determinations for the majority of charter schools in the state.

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:09.420
The multiple measures that verify data represent are valuable in helping ensure the strongest, most fair renewal determinations.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:15.420
Like many authorizers, however, we do not have dedicated staff with expertise in the various assessments.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.420
Authorizers would benefit from support to understand how to appropriately consider verified data.

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:26.420
For example, can we consider an assessment with less than a 95% participation rate, and if so, with what parameters?

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:30.420
Authorizers would also benefit from flexibility to make local decisions.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:35.420
For example, if a natural disaster occurs, we would want to be able to consider its impact on student learning,

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.420
whether or not it resulted in a school closure.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:48.420
We appreciate the State's Board's support and work to ensure these verified data are as clear and as straightforward as possible to support authorizers, particularly for small school districts.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:49.420
Thank you.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.420
Thank you.

01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:53.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420
You have one minute.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.420
Your time starts now.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:00.420
Good morning, Madam Chair and members.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:05.420
Liz Guillen with Public Advocates for the LCFF Equity Coalition.

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:19.420
We support the department's recommendation to approve the use of the overall performance level on this summative alternate LTCH.

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:24.420
We mostly appreciate the process that the department used for reaching this recommendation.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:29.420
Thank you very much.

01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.420
Thank you.

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420
You have one minute.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:37.420
Your time starts now.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.420
Good morning.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:50.420
This is Lindsay Tornatore calling on behalf of the California County Superintendent calling in to support the CDE's recommendations as stated in our coalition letter that we co-signed along with CTA and other colleagues.

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:55.420
And just a comment about the importance of student level data in our accountability system.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:03:04.420
Our accountability system is really designed to create opportunities for all LEAs to better understand the systemic barriers that are limiting every student's success.

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:10.420
And so this is truly a process of equity and it is driven by analysis of student level data.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:17.420
We appreciate the discussion that is happening this morning and all the work that has led up to this point in time.

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:28.420
We are here ready to support all of our charters, especially as we prepare for them to be eligible for the opportunity of differentiated systems in 2023.

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:38.420
And we look forward to the next steps of the state board to ensure that all LEAs are sharing and providing valid and reliable data to lead towards student improvement.

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.420
Thank you.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.420
Thank you.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.420
This is Casey Taylor, Executive Director of Achieve Charter Schools of Paradise.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:04:00.420
I appreciate that the state board is considering it.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:05.420
Caller, we are unable to hear you.

01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:07.420
Are you still there?

01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:09.420
Okay, I'm going to.

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:11.420
I am here.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.420
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.420
We can hear you now.

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:19.420
This is Casey Taylor.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.420
Okay.

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.420
Caller, I would ask if you could please call back in.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:26.420
We cannot hear you on our end.

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.420
Thank you.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.420
You have one minute.

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.420
Your time starts now.

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.420
It doesn't have to be with this call.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:42.420
Caller, with the last four digits, 8454,

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.420
you are now live.

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:49.420
Please start your public comment.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:54.420
Okay, moving on.

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:57.420
Caller, with the last four digits, 2726, you are now live.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:00.420
Please start your public comment.

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.420
Good morning. My name is Elizabeth Brenner.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.420
I'm the Superintendent of Compass Charter Schools.

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:10.420
I respectfully request that the board allow authorizers to consider

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:16.420
the participation rates in local assessments below 95% that could be

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.420
accepted as verified data for charter renewal.

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:23.420
Many charter schools serve families who hold strong personal beliefs

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.420
about the negative effect of standardized tests on the emotional

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:30.420
well-being of their children that impacts the school's ability to

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.420
attain the 95% participation rate.

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:37.420
Current language suggests that even participation rates as high as

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:40.420
93% would not be considered.

01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:44.420
To disregard results that are statistically significant unfairly

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:46.420
punishes these schools.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.420
We suggest that for participation rates less than 95%, the charter

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:54.420
school must address the lower participation rate and demonstrate how

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.420
they are representative of the makeup of the school population.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.420
Thank you.

01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.420
Thank you.

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:03.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.420
We have one minute.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.420
Your time starts now.

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.420
This is Casey Taylor, Executive Director of Achieve Charter Schools

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420
of Paradise.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.420
I appreciate that the state board is considering adjusting the verified

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:17.420
data use procedures so that a charter school can present evidence of

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:21.420
pandemic or natural disaster related learning disruptions for more than

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.420
just the 2020-21 school year.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.420
But I urge the state board to remove West End proposed language that would

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:30.420
only allow authorizers to consider evidence of learning disruptions if

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:32.420
they resulted in school closures.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.420
Having helped our school community navigate through the trauma of the

01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:39.420
2018 Paradise Campfire as well as the pandemic that followed, I can

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.420
personally attest that disruptions to students' learning may extend far

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.420
beyond school closures.

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.420
Allow charter schools and authorizers who know the local conditions to

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:51.420
present and evaluate verified data with on-the-ground context when

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:55.420
catastrophes beyond the school's control impact student learning,

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:58.420
regardless of whether or not they involve school closing.

01:06:58.420 --> 01:06:59.420
Thank you.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.420
Thank you.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.420
So that concludes public comment for item number two.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:08.420
All right.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.420
Thank you very much.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.420
We're now going to be open for board discussion.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:21.420
And I want to just ask Cindy Kazanis if she can be available for some

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:24.420
clarifying questions because I know we have some.

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:26.420
I have one to start us off.

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:31.420
And then I know that member Tari also has one.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:37.420
There was a statement about whether it is mandated to use verified data

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:38.420
for schools.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:42.420
And I think we clarified that earlier that it is not a requirement that

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.420
schools use these data, but that they are permitted to use verified data

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:48.420
in the renewal.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:54.420
Has that been clarified by the CDE already or is that something we need

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:55.420
to take up again?

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.420
The CDE has an FAQ on their website where this has been clarified.

01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:03.420
We received feedback from the Charter Schools Association last fall,

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:08.420
and we updated one of the FAQs that related to this directly.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:13.420
But I just want to clarify as well that this conversation is outside of what

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.420
is before you today as far as action.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.420
So what's before you today is adopting a list, an additional list of

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:29.420
assessment providers as well as the criteria around the use of this data.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:30.420
Okay.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.420
And that clarification is there.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:36.420
So member Yoshimoto, Tari?

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:37.420
Thank you, Board President.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.420
And again, this is probably more of a clarifying question.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:45.420
But in regard to the list, the ones that went through administrative changes,

01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.420
maybe I missed this, but how often is the cadence of updates?

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.420
Is it incumbent upon the vendor to let you know that their name is changing,

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.420
or does the department reach out in a certain cadence annually,

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:00.420
biannually to request changes?

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.420
And I'll tell you why I'm asking.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:09.420
I'm asking primarily because when product names of a large company fall under

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:14.420
many different product names, there are implications for districts' pricing

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.420
optimization, performance evaluation, and those sort of things.

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:24.420
And sometimes it's hard for LEAs to know that products are actually under the

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:25.420
same other company.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.420
And I know there's one on the list that's been updated.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.420
Absolutely.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:35.420
And this is, I think, one of the reasons that, again, the advocates push for the

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:40.420
reopening of this and the funding for it because there is not an ongoing process

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:43.420
for the department to consider administrative changes.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.420
It's, again, outside of the expertise of our work, and so we are dependent on,

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.420
this time around, on WestEd.

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:57.420
So if the board was interested in us having an annual review of that

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.420
administrative change, we would need to seek funding to, again, reengage

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.420
potentially with WestEd to do that work.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:10.420
But there is no process in place to do this on a regular basis.

01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:15.420
Existing law, as a couple of the callers stated, has a verified date of

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.420
sunsetting in two and a half years.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.420
So we are approaching this sunset already.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:27.420
But to your point, it was a major vendor who changed their name, who was

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:29.420
subsumed by a larger vendor.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:33.420
I think that's part of the economic forces that Eric was talking about, the

01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:39.420
underlying issues around the assessment community.

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:40.420
Thank you.

01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.420
So it's just a question that I have, given that we know that there is one

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.420
name change already on the list.

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.420
There's five.

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:46.420
Oh, there's five.

01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:47.420
Since this list is...

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:51.420
There's five on the list currently that are being recommended for

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.420
administrative changes.

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:53.420
Right.

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:59.420
And I'm wondering if we know that if there's one more also, if that should be

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:01.420
part of the discussions today or not.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.420
We were made of one, just so you know, we were made of one administrative

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:06.420
change the week of posting.

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:07.420
Okay.

01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:12.420
So that was, and Eric, if needed, Eric can come up and explain the outreach

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.420
that they did.

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:14.420
Okay.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:18.420
Thanks.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:27.420
Are there other questions or comments from my members of the board?

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.420
Okay.

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:32.420
Dr. Olken?

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:33.420
Hello.

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:40.420
Thank you so much for this presentation and also all of the hard work leading

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:41.420
up to it.

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:45.420
I really appreciate many pieces of it.

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:52.420
For example, the strong partnership across different education partners to

01:11:52.420 --> 01:12:00.420
the list and the proposal, the work that went into ensuring that every school

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.420
was able to provide the types of assessments that they're using.

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:10.420
There's just so much here that is really, it makes me proud.

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:15.420
And I also, there are pieces that we heard in public comment and that when I

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:21.420
reflect on my own experience as a person who is working in a charter school, I

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.420
still have questions about and concerns.

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:31.420
And I might have to do this in more than one question because I have several.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:37.420
But I guess the first would be to go back to what President Darling Hammond

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:43.420
brought up about if the use of verified data is required.

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:47.420
And I know you said it's outside of the scope of this item.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:54.420
And partly I want to speak to our fellow board members, too, just to get in our

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:56.420
head what we're deciding.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:05.420
So we have already seen some other changes that impact the charter school

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:11.420
community related to 1505, for example, the renewal process, right?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:18.420
This is the first time we're seeing how, I mean, the appeal process.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:23.420
This is the first time we're seeing how charter schools who are already

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.420
existing, they're already, they have schools, they have kids that they're

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:30.420
serving, and they're up for renewal, what that's going to look like under the

01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:32.420
new rules, right?

01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:38.420
So this question of what's the purpose of verified data and how is it used is

01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.420
really important because as was said in the presentation and by some of the

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:50.420
callers, its intent is to provide charter schools, particularly before we as a

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:57.420
state have a growth model as part of our dashboard, the opportunity to show how

01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:04.420
our students are performing and growing in a way that is augmenting what is

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.420
currently on the dashboard, right?

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:12.420
So it's supposed to be a tool to show progress.

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:17.420
And so this question of if it's required or not feels really important, and it

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:21.420
does feel to me like, I mean, it even got mentioned in the presentation on

01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.420
slide seven.

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:28.420
Slide seven was the use, use verified data in the renewal process, and it says

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:33.420
the charter school in the low performance category may not be renewed unless it

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.420
demonstrates through verified data measurable increases in academic

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:40.420
achievement or strong post-secondary outcomes.

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:44.420
So we can say that's really clear based on the presentation that in the low

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:50.420
category you have to use verified data to make a case.

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:53.420
But I'm just following up on Linda's question, and I'm sorry there's such a

01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.420
long prologue, but the next one says for a charter school in the middle

01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:02.420
performance category seeking renewal, the chartering authority must consider a

01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.420
clear and convincing evidence of either measurable increases in academic

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:10.420
achievement or strong post-secondary outcomes, which must be demonstrated by

01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.420
verified data.

01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:26.420
So I read that to say the burden falls on the chartering authority to consider

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:32.420
data that might be presented by a charter school if they choose to.

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.420
Am I over reading?

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.420
I would defer to legal staff, but this is outside of my area of expertise.

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:44.420
I'm here to provide recommendations on adding assessment vendors to the list

01:15:44.420 --> 01:15:48.420
and to provide comments around the data use procedures, but I'll defer to others

01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.420
to help you with that interpretation.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:57.420
Okay, so even though that's in the item, it's a slide.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:06.420
Well, maybe somebody can, I mean, to me, if that's not part of what a data use

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:09.420
procedure is.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:13.420
It's not what the board determined as a data use procedure back in November

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.420
2020.

01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:20.420
So that is right now what you see in slide seven is a way of background on how

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:26.420
the department has helped to provide resources to the field on

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:33.420
operationalizing this process, and this is directly taken from our website and

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:34.420
our FAQs.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.420
So this slide is not reintroducing anything new.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:42.420
It is something that has existed on the website, again, for several months.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:48.420
But I would, if you're asking for an interpretation or an affirmation of that,

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:50.420
again, I would defer to legal counsel.

01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:54.420
I guess partly at this point I just want to point out for us to consider that

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.420
that seems unclear.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:05.420
And if we're getting, if we're preparing to approve recommendations that include,

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:09.420
that are as high stakes as if a school gets to continue or not, and there's

01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:15.420
something that unclear, I wonder if that's something we want to address as part

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.420
of our recommendations.

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.420
So I can let that go for now.

01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:23.420
But thank you.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.420
And I'll have more.

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:27.420
I just have a comment.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:35.420
I think the recommended update to the criteria to define verified data is clear

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:41.420
and ensures alignment with the, with pliability offered to all public schools for

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:46.420
the 2019 and 2020-2021 school year.

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:51.420
The recommended updates to the data use procedures I believe are appropriate to

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:56.420
allow authorizers to consider the impacts of the pandemic on learning while not

01:17:56.420 --> 01:18:02.420
undermining the entire purpose of the verified data as laid out on AB 1505.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.420
I really commend your work.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.420
I think it was very thorough.

01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:10.420
I think that you used a scaffold to carefully give opportunities to all assessment

01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:13.420
vendors to participate and ample time.

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:21.420
So I thank you so much for your presentation.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.420
We were talking about the question of what's in scope and believe that this is in

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:30.420
scope, but there's, but it's not part of Cindy's obligation to answer it.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:34.420
So we're going to try to figure out how to have that conversation with the right person.

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:40.420
Is Len available?

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.420
Good morning, board members.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.420
Len Garfinkel, general counsel for the department.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:50.420
As director Kazanis said, we attempted to address this in the FAQ.

01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:58.420
And what it does is recite to the statutory language, which is where we are.

01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:05.420
And I know that Virginia Cale is here in our office who's been involved with this issue too.

01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:11.420
I don't know, Virginia, if you'd like to expand on that at all.

01:19:11.420 --> 01:19:12.420
Yeah.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:14.420
Virginia wants to say something.

01:19:14.420 --> 01:19:18.420
I will just say I was there for the vote in 2020 that we took as a board.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:23.420
And our understanding was that this was an affordance that could be added to what is on the

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:26.420
dashboard as part of the discussion.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:30.420
Not something that would be required of every charter school.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:35.420
So I'm eager to hear how it evolved since then.

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:39.420
President Demingham, can I add one thing to that comment?

01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:44.420
I listened to that board meeting because I wasn't yet on the board.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:47.420
And it was essential.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:53.420
There were a couple central conversations that came up with the clear, like, let's make sure as we

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:58.420
continue working on this, if it's not clear now, it's clear next time.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:01.420
And that's why I'm raising it.

01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:09.420
I remember us trying to clarify that.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.420
Good morning, board.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.420
I'm Virginia Cale with the CDE Legal Division.

01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:28.420
So our FAQ was developed based on the language N47607.2, which specifically sets out the use of

01:20:28.420 --> 01:20:32.420
verified data and what verified data is meant to show.

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:41.420
It is certainly, I can scoot over to this one, sorry.

01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:48.420
It is certainly what the department has interpreted to show that for a low tier school, for a school that

01:20:48.420 --> 01:20:56.420
would otherwise be denied, verified data is going to have to be introduced because a charter school

01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:02.420
is going to have to show either measurable growth or strong post-secondary outcomes, both of which

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:06.420
have to be shown through verified data, in order to even get a two-year renewal.

01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:15.420
For the middle tier charter schools, what the statute says is that the authorizer must consider

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.420
verified data as presented.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:26.420
And it also says that those middle tier charter schools can show, as part of the renewal process,

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:32.420
measurable increases or strong post-secondary outcomes, and those may be shown through verified data.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.420
Well, no, that is the only way you can show those two things is through verified data.

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:40.420
On our verified data list, I don't know that we have post-secondary outcomes, for example.

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:43.420
We do. It is not being considered now.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:46.420
We're not updating that list, but that is definitely on that list.

01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:57.420
So for those in the middle tier, what is the framework that you're using?

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:06.420
For those in the middle tier, if they're going to show either of those two things,

01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:08.420
they need to show it through verified data.

01:22:08.420 --> 01:22:16.420
And when they present the verified data, 476.7.2 mandates that the authorizer consider that data when it's presented.

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:22.420
That certainly wouldn't limit or wouldn't...

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:29.420
I mean, it's not the clearest piece of law.

01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:36.420
And so what we have... it's not. I'm going to be honest with you.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:43.420
But what it does say is that in that middle tier, if a school is going to show measurable increases

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.420
or strong post-secondary outcomes, they must show them through verified data.

01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:50.420
And if they present verified data, the charter authorizer must consider it.

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.420
So that is where and how we've crafted that FAQ, is making it clear that for those low tier,

01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.420
you don't even get your chance at that two-year renewal, which is your only option,

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:01.420
unless you're presenting verified data.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:09.420
And in the middle tier, if you're going to support your renewal application by showing growth

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:13.420
or strong post-secondary outcomes, you've got to show it through verified data.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.420
Member Glover-Woods.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:24.420
Okay. So if I understand correctly, I'm going to go back to one of the original questions,

01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:31.420
which was, do charter schools have to utilize verified data?

01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:38.420
And based on what we have... based on the discussion we've had, it seems that the answer...

01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:44.420
and I'm stating what I think the answer is so that you can let me know if that's accurate or not.

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:49.420
But it seems that the answer is not all charter schools have to use verified data

01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:56.420
unless they fall within the low-performance category or middle-performance category.

01:23:56.420 --> 01:24:02.420
Because based on the conversation we've had the last couple of minutes, it seems that those schools,

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:07.420
the charter schools that would come up for renewal that fall into low-performance or middle-performance,

01:24:07.420 --> 01:24:17.420
do have to utilize verified data, and that does have to be considered as part of their renewal.

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.420
For the low tier, they must.

01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:27.420
For the middle tier, if they're going to show either of those two things,

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:31.420
if they're going to show the measurable increases or the strong post-secondary outcomes,

01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:34.420
they must rely on verified data.

01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.420
And there's kind of a quibble there in that middle, right?

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:42.420
Because you may have, especially this year where we're going to have all schools being considered under the middle tier,

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:47.420
you may very well have some schools that have a very strong showing on the dashboard,

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:54.420
that have very high task scores, and that can show that maybe they don't need to show more than that,

01:24:54.420 --> 01:25:00.420
because they're going to show that they should be renewed based on what's available through CAS

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:03.420
and what's available on the dashboard.

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:11.420
But you may very well have some that are much truer to what will be middle tier once we get there,

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:15.420
that need to show more, because perhaps their task scores aren't great or there's some issues on their dashboard,

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:19.420
and they're trying to establish that, well, but we do have strong post-secondary outcomes,

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:23.420
or we can show measurable increases.

01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:26.420
And then that would have to be shown through verified data.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:31.420
So I think the point for the middle schools is that, and by the way, when charters are authorized,

01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.420
there are many, many things that authorizers are permitted to look at and that schools are permitted to show,

01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:44.420
which can include the wonderful programs they're providing,

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:49.420
or the way in which the families are engaged in enrollment, et cetera.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.420
There are many other things.

01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:56.420
But I think the point for the middle schools is if you want to go beyond CASPA data

01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:06.420
for these purposes of looking at achievement or post-secondary outcomes, the data you use must be verified.

01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:14.420
But it does not require that you have to produce verified data if you can use all the other data

01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:23.420
that you would be presenting and the dashboard data as the basis of the conversation with the authorizer.

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:30.420
Does that fit what you are expressing?

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:37.420
Okay, so I think to your point, and this year, as we were just told,

01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:43.420
all the schools will be considered in the middle tier, so to speak.

01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:50.420
So for this year, for those who want to present more data than the dashboard presents

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:54.420
about achievement or post-secondary data, they must use the verified list.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:27:00.420
But it does not mean that if they didn't do diagnostic testing beyond CASP,

01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:05.420
that they have to run out and go do that testing now, I believe.

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:10.420
If we want to say that that is not correct, then we better get that straight.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:19.420
And if we think that is correct, I want to make sure people who don't spend as much time as we have

01:27:19.420 --> 01:27:26.420
trying to understand this, it's clear what schools are needing to prepare

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:34.420
and it's clear what authorizers can consider and or require.

01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:41.420
Because in my reading of it right now, whether it's in the item or elsewhere,

01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:49.420
it's as complicated as this conversation has been to understand, and that seems unfair.

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:58.420
And I think we can do, there's some easy fixes.

01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:05.420
So moving on from this question, if we are in a reasonable place on that and we can verify that,

01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:11.420
I'm going to ask for some amendments that are responsive to some of the conversation that we heard

01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:17.420
from folks who were commenters and maybe take a break so that we can clarify those.

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:27.420
But we heard several things about ways that the data might be used that would be productive

01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:32.420
from folks who both wrote in and spoke.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:40.420
So I would want to amend the participation rate element to say,

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:46.420
to add after the results of at least 95 percent of pupils for whom the assessment is appropriate,

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:56.420
I would want to add an authorizer may consider evidence of impacts of the global pandemic or natural disasters on participation

01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:03.420
and may choose to flex the 95 percent requirements so long as there is evidence that selection bias has not occurred.

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:09.420
That is that excluded students were not likely to score lower than the students who took the assessment.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.420
So that would respond to some of the comments that we heard.

01:29:14.420 --> 01:29:22.420
With respect to the use of student group data,

01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:30.420
the CDE recommendation says the data include all student groups that have at least 11 students.

01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.420
I would add for assessments that publish student group norms to enable comparisons

01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:40.420
because we heard that not all of the publishers produce those norms,

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:45.420
which we are able to produce for CASP and will have in our growth metric.

01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:48.420
And then finally on data use procedure number six,

01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:59.420
which is the differences from the CASP again to add the charter school shall present data for the student groups

01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:03.420
whose CASP performance placed the school in the middle or low performance category

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:09.420
and add for assessments that publish student group norms to enable comparisons.

01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:12.420
Just again to clarify that.

01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:21.420
And finally, one of our goals is not to try to turn every authorizer and every charter school into psychometricians.

01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:24.420
The world has enough of those.

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:31.420
But we do want to make useful analyses available in the decision making.

01:30:31.420 --> 01:30:40.420
So where it talks about in the use of the CASP for English language arts, literacy and mathematics,

01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:46.420
specified CASP reported data can only be used in a manner consistent with the data reported on the CASP website

01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:51.420
and dashboard, CASP data and methodologies for analyzing CASP data.

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:56.420
And I would add, for example, the core student growth percentiles that are mutually agreed upon

01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:00.420
by the chartering authority and the charter school may be used to supplement.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:08.420
So I think that that would resolve a few of the questions that we heard in ways that I hope clarify a path forward

01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.420
for the authorizers and the schools.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.420
I see that Cindy is here and wants to speak to something.

01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.420
So please.

01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:18.420
I would ask Eric Crane to come up.

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:23.420
I think it would be helpful to have a bit more overview around the student group issue,

01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:29.420
just so you're aware of what was asked of publishers and what they told us publicly that they could do.

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:35.420
So I want to make sure that we have that clarification prior to this action, if possible.

01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:41.420
Thank you, Director Gazzanes.

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:53.420
So the student group criterion, as it's currently worded, is that the data include all student groups that have at least 11 students

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:59.420
using the groups and minimum size for reporting from the California school dashboard.

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:11.420
So it is a criterion that asks for the data to be disaggregated at the group level.

01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:17.420
In terms of what the publishers provided and what our review considered,

01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:28.420
we did ask and we did review in the technical material what the publishers produce for student groups.

01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:38.420
And those that have moved forward on balance with their technical quality have that.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:45.420
And they do, by and large, report on group norms.

01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:54.420
So the criterion, as it's now stated, calls for separate reporting out.

01:32:54.420 --> 01:33:05.420
And it wasn't entirely clear what the proposed language change would do to that criterion.

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:10.420
What it would do is simply say, yes, where the group norms are made available by the publisher,

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:15.420
where the reporting would continue to report by groups,

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:24.420
but where the group norms are not available, then you're not expected to.

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:27.420
That's a minimum requirement of what we asked of publishers.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:30.420
So you would not have made the list if you could not produce the student group information.

01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:32.420
Is that accurate?

01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:36.420
Norms are different than information.

01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:40.420
You have to have developed norms for each subgroup.

01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:42.420
Okay, thank you.

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:49.420
Just a comment on that.

01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:59.420
I think sometimes publishers aren't given access to all of the data disaggregation characteristics

01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.420
that they would need to do that type of data.

01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:06.420
For example, students are getting foster use services.

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:13.420
That data might not be passed to publishers to be able to give back data in that format.

01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:16.420
So I wonder about that.

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:24.420
How much data is being shared with vendors to actually be able to turn around and desegregate that data?

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:26.420
And there's two questions.

01:34:26.420 --> 01:34:29.420
One is whether you can desegregate the data.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.420
And that can sometimes be an issue, as you have suggested.

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:37.420
The other issue is whether you're making a judgment about the gains of student groups

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:43.420
when they don't have student group norms, norms that are for those student groups.

01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:46.420
So those two related issues.

01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:51.420
Or whether those markers are even shared with the publisher.

01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:55.420
Right, and sometimes that may also be an issue.

01:34:56.420 --> 01:35:03.420
So what I'd like to do, I'd like to hear any other discussion from the board

01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:09.420
and then take a break to come back with proposed amendments that are written so you can see them.

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.420
Member Glover-Woods.

01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.420
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:21.420
I was going to ask if you would restate the amendment related to student group.

01:35:21.420 --> 01:35:23.420
I wanted to hear that again.

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:27.420
And then I may have a question, Cindy, after I hear that.

01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:33.420
It would add to the student groups proposal.

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:37.420
The data include, this is what's already there.

01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.420
The data include all student groups that have at least 11 students

01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:46.420
using the groups and minimum size for reporting from the California school dashboard

01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.420
for assessments that publish student group norms to enable comparisons.

01:35:52.420 --> 01:36:01.420
That would be added for assessments that publish student group norms to enable comparisons.

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:05.420
And so my question, Cindy, just to clarify.

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:11.420
Are there assessments on the list that's before us for approval

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:19.420
that do not provide the student group norms information?

01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:34.420
The assessments that were moved forward cleared the rubric in an overall way

01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:39.420
and that individual item need not have been met for an assessment to go forward.

01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:43.420
So it is possible that an assessment could have been recommended to you all

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:47.420
without having met that requirement of group norms.

01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:49.420
Thank you. Thank you for the clarification.

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:54.420
The reporting, however, is what's referenced in the current version of the criterion.

01:36:54.420 --> 01:37:01.420
So they're able to, in a sense, disaggregate the data by student group,

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:04.420
but not with the student group norm, which is the...

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:06.420
There's another question we can ask.

01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:12.420
Are they all able to disaggregate by all of the student groups

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:15.420
that are part of the dashboard?

01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:18.420
That is a separate question.

01:37:18.420 --> 01:37:22.420
And the criterion, of course, falls to the school authorizer conversation

01:37:22.420 --> 01:37:25.420
and not to the publisher reporting.

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:33.420
So the sense of the criterion is that the data include the student groups.

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.420
That would be in the conversation between charter school and authorizer.

01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:42.420
So the publisher is not in that discussion?

01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:44.420
It comes after the fact?

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:48.420
What I think the question may be is whether the whole set of verified data being presented

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:58.420
gets thrown out if the publisher cannot produce student group disaggregated data

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:03.420
for all of the dashboard groups

01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:09.420
or cannot produce data that is benchmarked to the group norms.

01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:13.420
And I think what we're trying to accomplish is being sure that the data that is available

01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:17.420
and appropriate can still be used,

01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:23.420
even if the publisher can't provide everything that is in this expectation.

01:38:23.420 --> 01:38:33.420
I would say yes and, not but, yes and, if, well, let me just kind of break it down this way.

01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:39.420
As we're considering the list of assessments and as we're considering these different areas,

01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:48.420
what I want to be sure is that for those charter schools that will need to utilize verified data

01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:57.420
as part of their renewal process, that the data from the assessments is able to be disaggregated,

01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:00.420
I'm going to just go with the disaggregation right now,

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:09.420
into the student groups that are required based on CAS, based on all other schools.

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.420
I want to be sure that that verified data, what we approve,

01:39:12.420 --> 01:39:21.420
does not exclude looking at data for all of the student groups that are possible that meet that minimum.

01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:29.420
Maybe we need to word this in a way that makes it clear that data that can be looked at should be looked at,

01:39:29.420 --> 01:39:34.420
but that a source of verified data should not be thrown out if it doesn't have.

01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:37.420
I think that might be helpful.

01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:39.420
These are data that already exist.

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:42.420
It's not like these schools are going to be able to go out there now and say,

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:52.420
oh, we've been using this source of data and now we're going to go give a different test.

01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.420
Or the authorizers say, well, we're just not going to accept your data.

01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:58.420
I think that's what we're getting to.

01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:06.420
I would agree, and I again think as we are approving a list of assessments,

01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:14.420
we want to, to the degree that we can, know that the majority of those on this list are able to be,

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:20.420
in a sense that they're able to look and be able to show data in the same way as with all schools.

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:30.420
But I understand and appreciate and do support if there is data that is not available based on student norms and comparability,

01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:33.420
that that shouldn't exclude the verified data.

01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:41.420
But I still want to be sure that all charters are still going to need to,

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:47.420
in a sense, demonstrate student group performance for all of the student groups

01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:51.420
that are required with that minimum number of 11.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:56.420
So to one last little point, and I think I'll stop.

01:40:56.420 --> 01:41:04.420
Just for my clarification, when a charter goes through the renewal process,

01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:09.420
one level of data that has to be looked at is CASP data.

01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:11.420
Is that accurate?

01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:15.420
And then the other level of data that can be looked at,

01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:19.420
with the exception of the low performance group, is verified data.

01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:21.420
Is that accurate?

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.420
Yes.

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.420
Thank you.

01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:29.420
And then I think the questions that may come up are,

01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:40.420
does the authorizer need to look at, you know, allow the use of the verified data that the school may want to present?

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:51.420
If it doesn't, for example, have every one of the student groups represented and with group norms.

01:41:51.420 --> 01:41:53.420
I have a clarifying question.

01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:59.420
Would the usage of core methodology help alleviate some of these concerns?

01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.420
It might. I will say when we were doing the work during the pandemic,

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:10.420
where many districts were allowed to use different diagnostic assessments if they could not,

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:21.420
if they didn't have enough secure, you know, browsers, et cetera, to use the CASP or they lacked enough equipment.

01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.420
When there were analyses done of some of those data,

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:31.420
they could not be broken down by all the groups because the data recipients,

01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:43.420
the NWBA or the iReady or whatever, didn't have in every case students identified by all of the markers that go into the state data set.

01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:51.420
So it may be possible for a publisher to produce data when they get the,

01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:56.420
I think this is what member Nashi Mototari was just explaining.

01:42:56.420 --> 01:43:03.420
They don't always get all the data from the school or district to allow the breakdown.

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:11.420
But then the other issue that has been raised is, and this was in the letter that came from the Charter Development Center,

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:20.420
that not all of them produce group norms for the subgroups, which we're able to do at the state level,

01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:27.420
but we're not, you know, that is not necessarily something that every publisher can do for every assessment.

01:43:27.420 --> 01:43:30.420
And I think Cindy wants to say something because she is standing there.

01:43:30.420 --> 01:43:35.420
So we would like to recognize you if you do want to say something or to answer any clarifying questions.

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:41.420
Okay. Any further question? Yes. Member Olcott, are you?

01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:43.420
I think my question is for you. Yeah.

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:55.420
So if I understand the proposal is that we're going to break so that what you said verbally,

01:43:55.420 --> 01:44:00.420
we can see in writing and then will we have further discussion at that point?

01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:03.420
Further discussion on it, yes. Fantastic. Thank you.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.420
That's too many words for everyone to be holding their brain in.

01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:10.420
There may be things that we need to take a look at. Thank you.

01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:16.420
Thank you, Ms. Elkin for mentioning. I would like to see it in writing so that I can see it in print and kind of.

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:22.420
So we're going to take a break if that's okay. We have another member, Yashemoda Wattari.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:27.420
Before we take a break, I think the reason I brought that up is my understanding of FERPA

01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:36.420
is that because data use agreements differ across systems and between vendors,

01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:43.420
that is sometimes why the data isn't shared as readily if a student has an IP,

01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.420
if a student is unhoused, if a student.

01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:53.420
So that may limit the ability of a third party to actually desegregate by certain student groups.

01:44:53.420 --> 01:45:05.420
And I don't know that that is required of districts or of LEAs to have robust data use agreements

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:10.420
with certain privacy stipulations.

01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:19.420
Thank you. One other response to member Escobedo's question, yes, about the core growth metric.

01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:23.420
What that would allow, we don't yet have our growth metric in place.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:28.420
And this is all came about because we were not yet to a statewide growth metric.

01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:35.420
But allowing the districts that do participate in core to use the core growth metric

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:44.420
would allow them to use CASP data, which then gets past some of the challenges that we're,

01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:51.420
if they're using that metric, that statistical process with the CASP, which is what typically is done.

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:55.420
So I don't think we answered that fully before.

01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.420
I just had a clarifying point on that.

01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:03.420
And I want to make sure that I emphasize on that criteria that there is a statement that says

01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:07.420
that the CASP data cannot be used to dispute the dashboard results.

01:46:07.420 --> 01:46:11.420
So core may look at it in a different manner.

01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:20.420
And if it is inconsistent with what we see on the dashboard, the dashboard overrules that piece.

01:46:20.420 --> 01:46:23.420
But the dashboard doesn't have a growth metric.

01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:27.420
I mean, that would end up being a question, right?

01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:33.420
If you have a status measure and a growth measure, they're going to show you different things,

01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.420
not necessarily incompatible things.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:42.420
And then just to address member Yoshimoto-Towery's point, we did not hear FERPA concerns about the sharing of data.

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.420
That is something I know that my division takes very seriously.

01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:51.420
We enter into a number of data sharing agreements with researchers on a regular basis.

01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:58.420
And so we are currently, as an example, sharing student group information, including foster and unhoused youth

01:46:58.420 --> 01:47:01.420
or what we call homeless youth with our testing vendor, ETS.

01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:10.420
And so that is absolutely something that we have an MOU in place that allows us for that kind of use.

01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:17.420
So I just wanted to make sure that we said that out loud, that we did not hear that concern from the test publishers at least.

01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:22.420
My comment was more in regard to specific LEAs and third party vendors, not so much the state.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:31.420
And sometimes the LEA will say, for example, we can't share the free and reduced price lunch data or whatever with an outside vendor.

01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:34.420
And that's why we don't use free and reduced price lunch data.

01:47:34.420 --> 01:47:37.420
We use the SED as the student group.

01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:42.420
So I just want to make sure that, you know, on a state level, we have set an example that this can be done.

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:48.420
Right. And then we have different things happening in local places.

01:47:50.420 --> 01:47:53.420
Any other questions?

01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:56.420
All right. We're going to take a 10 minute break.

01:47:56.420 --> 01:48:01.420
See you back here at we're going to make an 11 minute break and see you back here at 1030.

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:08.420
And we're going to do the countdown.

01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:27.420
All right.

01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:30.420
Eric Petrowski, Policy Director, State Board of Education.

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:34.420
I have slides available for the changes that have been requested.

01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.420
All right. Thank you very much.

01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:44.420
So I wonder before making a motion with amendments, just clarify a couple of things.

01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:57.420
The verified data use was put in place, as I noted before, in part because we did not yet have a growth metric to look at student growth.

01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:01.420
And that's a major piece of what every school is trying to accomplish.

01:49:02.420 --> 01:49:13.420
At this moment, we're talking about four charter schools that will come up for reauthorization in the next year or two.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:19.420
We're talking about what they have been doing over the last number of years, three, four years.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:23.420
So this is mostly retrospective.

01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:30.420
It may it's not really so much prospective, except there may be a few that are coming up next year who would choose something based on the data.

01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:33.420
They may use it something based on this list this year.

01:49:33.420 --> 01:49:37.420
It's verifying data they may already have used.

01:49:37.420 --> 01:49:44.420
So just to be clear that this is not for many charter schools, this would not be a selection process.

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:51.420
It would be a how do we understand what can be presented and how do authorizers understand what can be looked at.

01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:54.420
So just to be clear about that.

01:49:54.420 --> 01:50:04.420
What I would propose is that we adopt the CDE recommendation with the amendments that are in red on these slides.

01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:18.420
In terms of verified data, too, we would add that an authorizer may consider evidence of the impacts of global pandemic or natural disasters on participation and may waive this requirement.

01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:27.420
If there's evidence that selection bias has not occurred, for example, excluding students who are not likely.

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:37.420
There should not be a not there excluded students who were likely to score lower on average.

01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:49.420
Can we be shared the slides so we can look at it in print?

01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:54.420
I don't know. That was part of our challenge was figuring out how to get the slides to communicate.

01:50:54.420 --> 01:50:59.420
I would have to ask the folks who were struggling with that.

01:50:59.420 --> 01:51:04.420
In our inbox? Sure. Or even just electronically.

01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:07.420
I think the electronics was the problem.

01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:10.420
OK, it's coming from Brooks.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:16.420
Excluded students who were likely to score lower on average than students who took the assessment.

01:51:16.420 --> 01:51:29.420
So that would give authorizers the opportunity to consider the impacts of the pandemic and natural disasters and to consider evidence that has less than 95 percent participation rate.

01:51:29.420 --> 01:51:39.420
If there's evidence that, for example, you know, all of the special education students or some students who were low achieving were not excluded.

01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:43.420
Move on to the next one.

01:51:43.420 --> 01:51:48.420
Verified data for.

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:54.420
No, we changed this, and this is not the correct version.

01:51:54.420 --> 01:52:06.420
I'm sorry, this is not the correct version that we just worked on.

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:21.420
All right, we may need to take what I would recommend is that because we have other things to do that we move ahead with the agenda, come back to this after lunch because we've had technology issues and capturing issues.

01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:29.420
The amendments really seek to be sure that student group data is reported wherever it's available and of an adequate sample size.

01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:43.420
And that comparisons are appropriate when they're compared to CASP data and that the core growth metric is included as an example of what can be done.

01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:54.420
So that's what we'll come back to, but the wording is not correct on the slides that we were just shown, and we'll be sure that those who want to see it in their inboxes can do so.

01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:58.420
So what I would suggest that we do is move on so that we can get them.

01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:00.420
Is that OK, Brooks?

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:03.420
And come back to this.

01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:10.420
Yeah, we'll reopen this item and thank everyone for their forbearance as we've tried to to get the.

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:15.420
All the technology to work is state superintendent.

01:53:15.420 --> 01:53:25.420
Available because he would be the next item on the agenda.

01:53:25.420 --> 01:53:26.420
He's here.

01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.420
All right.

01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:32.420
Drum roll.

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:40.420
Here we go.

01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:41.420
Yeah, we're going to come back to this.

01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:43.420
Well, maybe after lunch.

01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:47.420
I'm not sure.

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:50.420
I want to be sure that we can make it available to everyone.

01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:56.420
And clearly we're having, you know, challenges.

01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:24.420
All right.

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:35.420
Well, we had some snags in being sure that the technology could communicate the amendments, so we're going to fix those and come back to that.

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:46.420
So we're delighted that you're here and we're opening item one for your state superintendent's report.

01:54:46.420 --> 01:54:47.420
Thank you.

01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:54.420
Thank you, Madam President, to President Darling Hammond and members of the board, to those who are present, to those who are following online.

01:54:54.420 --> 01:55:01.420
It's my pleasure to bring you a few highlights from our work at the California Department of Education.

01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:07.420
Many of you know that most recently, one of our largest districts in the state experienced an eight day strike.

01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:14.420
And I bring this up to say that given the fiscal conditions that some of our school districts still experience,

01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:18.420
we're going to continue to see labor and management strife.

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:27.420
And so we found ourselves in the position to actually mediate the strike in Oakland, working with both labor and management to work through complicated issues.

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:34.420
And I'm grateful to say that we were able to help them reach agreement on very important topics,

01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:46.420
both improving compensation for important staff and providing incredible services for students who are often homeless, who have been disadvantaged in other ways.

01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:52.420
And so while we don't really have a labor management team at the Department of Education,

01:55:52.420 --> 01:55:59.420
we've made it known that we will work with districts to try and prevent them from reaching the crisis point of actually naming a strike,

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:07.420
because we know that while sometimes it's necessary, those who get hurt are the students and we don't want students to have lost time.

01:56:07.420 --> 01:56:14.420
And so we've made it known that we will help any district that is experiencing labor and management strife if they're willing to work with us.

01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:19.420
And we try to find ways to help them prevent being in a situation of calling a strike.

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:26.420
I'd like to thank some of the staff at the Department of Education for joining me in the mediation and working long hours

01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:39.420
and finding ways to find space for the mediation to take place and literally providing meals to the striking parties and management for the course of eight days.

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:50.420
And I'd like to thank, first, Deputy Superintendent Malia Vela, who literally secured space for upwards of 60 people who were involved in the mediation

01:56:50.420 --> 01:57:00.420
and coached a number of the participants on how to work through some of the complications of labor law and the conversations that take place.

01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:10.420
And I'd like to thank Deputy Superintendent Abel Guillen, who also joined those negotiations and, of course, our Chief Deputy Superintendent Mary Nicely.

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:18.420
As ironic as the timing was, the strike occurred during Teacher Appreciation Month.

01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:31.420
And we had to find ways to weave in and out of those negotiations to participate in some Teacher Appreciation events and want to officially say thank you to all of our teachers in the month of May.

01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:36.420
Thank you for what you do. We appreciate you and your efforts.

01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:43.420
And thank you to everyone at Burbank Elementary School who allowed me to visit as part of our Teacher Appreciation Month visit.

01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:52.420
And at Burbank Elementary, we visited some TK classes and some state preschool classes.

01:57:52.420 --> 01:57:56.420
And these are dual immersion classes as well.

01:57:56.420 --> 01:58:12.420
And so we got a special treat to see TK as it is envisioned for our state and to see the incredible accomplishments being made by our students and to be with students who are learning Spanish and some Tagalog and just to see incredible things.

01:58:12.420 --> 01:58:18.420
We want to remind our teachers, you know, it's a hard job and we know that you need support.

01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:23.420
We want to remind you that the National Board Certification Program is available to you.

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:34.420
Thank you, Dr. Darling-Hammond and others for securing the funding in the budget for those who receive that certification to receive $5,000 a year, every year for five years.

01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:43.420
And I'm incredibly pleased to say that applications are up and that the applications of teachers of color are significantly up.

01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:48.420
They've increased by, they've tripled. Those applications have tripled.

01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:57.420
And when you see Deputy Superintendent Shel Cotton, she can provide you the exact percentages, but the applications for teachers of color have tripled.

01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:10.420
It is programs like these and programs like our teacher education workforce programs that we can use to support our workforce in retaining them.

01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:21.420
I do want to also acknowledge that we celebrated some of our classified staff in what was called a heroes program, recognizing the food service workers.

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:27.420
Every time I have the chance to serve meals in these programs, I think how tired I am afterwards.

01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:37.420
And I just have great appreciation for those who do this on a day in and day out basis and provide a smile to young learners as they provide them a meal.

01:59:37.420 --> 01:59:42.420
I want to say thank you to those that allowed us to visit.

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:52.420
And we were grateful to be able to provide them with donated tickets to the Warriors and Lakers game in San Francisco.

01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:55.420
I did not get to attend, but I'm glad that they got to attend.

01:59:55.420 --> 02:00:01.420
I wish it had been a better outcome for the Warriors, but go Warriors, always, always believe.

02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:12.420
I also want to note that as we are celebrating Teacher Appreciation Month, we continue our efforts to support statewide recruitment of teacher candidates and future candidates.

02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:15.420
And we have a public service announcement that has gone out.

02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:22.420
We have created a one stop way for people to learn about the profession.

02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:24.420
What does it mean to become a teacher?

02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:27.420
How do you get access to getting funds for a teacher credential?

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:39.420
Thank you again, Dr. Darling-Hammond and others for helping us to grow our Golden State Teacher Grant to $20,000 to anyone who wants to become a teacher or a mental health clinician in our state.

02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:41.420
We are out there promoting that.

02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:46.420
I think we can see that applications are up for the Golden State Teacher Grant.

02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:55.420
And we're excited to continue to connect candidates to teacher credentialing programs or to districts who are actually doing the hiring.

02:00:56.420 --> 02:01:00.420
You know, it's hard to get the information and it's not all in one place.

02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:17.420
And while we don't have recruitment staff at the department, we've entered into this work in hopes of helping us recruit the TK teachers that we need over the next several years and bilingual education teachers and math and science teachers and arts and music teachers and every other category you can think of.

02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:22.420
I want to acknowledge the May revise that came out just a few days ago.

02:01:22.420 --> 02:01:27.420
We recognize that the state is experiencing a significant decline in projected revenue.

02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:38.420
But I'm grateful that as it relates to what has been proposed for education, that there have been very few reductions proposed.

02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:48.420
There have been some reductions proposed for some of the one time grants, and we hope that the legislature can find a way around making those reductions.

02:01:48.420 --> 02:02:04.420
But with an 8.2% cost of living adjustment proposed and a number of programs that we think are important, not just because we've sponsored bills in this area, but because they're important, that there's funding proposed in this budget to expand training programs for bilingual educators.

02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:13.420
There is funding in this budget that is proposed to support any programs that would be related to dyslexia screening.

02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:27.420
It should that bill prevail that there would be a way to ensure that many of our students aren't over identified for dyslexia and that they're training opportunities for how we implement such a bill.

02:02:27.420 --> 02:02:40.420
And of course, there's funding to support increasing the teacher residency grant, which is a bill that we've actually sponsored in SB 765 that would increase the teacher residency grant to $40,000.

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:48.420
And so the great things are happening in California, but we still have to grapple with challenges that districts face like declining enrollment.

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:58.420
So next week, we'll be hosting a declining enrollment webinar that's intended to be a how to to show districts how you can counter declining enrollment.

02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:03.420
Yes, districts have to make hard choices as their enrollment declines.

02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:06.420
And sadly, that means reducing overhead.

02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:11.420
In some cases, even closing schools that have low enrollment.

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:24.420
But we want to look to the future and how districts can actually improve their enrollment and show them things that they can do to make that happen, like provide more STEAM education programs and more dual language immersion programs.

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:31.420
And so next week's webinar on May the 23rd at 1030 that anyone can join will focus on these programs.

02:03:31.420 --> 02:03:40.420
And we will have representatives who can talk about them like those at the calculus roundtable, which have some groundbreaking STEAM education programs.

02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:53.420
And the West County Mandarin School from West Contra Costa Unified School District that has used its dual language immersion programs to attract parents and families back to the district.

02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:56.420
And so we invite you all to join us for that conversation.

02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:00.420
Finally, I'd like to make some staff acknowledgments.

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.420
It's bittersweet.

02:04:02.420 --> 02:04:10.420
We will be soon losing someone who's been no stranger to this board and to the Department of Education.

02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:12.420
I don't know if she's in the room.

02:04:12.420 --> 02:04:14.420
She's hiding. Yes, she's in the room.

02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:21.420
I want to acknowledge Stephanie Farland, who many of you know will be moving on to other work, but still working in the educational space.

02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.420
And I'll let her tell you where she's going to be.

02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:25.420
That's her. That's her announcement.

02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:34.420
But I want to acknowledge her on behalf of three and a half incredible years of service to this organization, to this work.

02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:39.420
And it has been important work and not always easy work.

02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:42.420
How's that? I want to be strength based in how I say it.

02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:50.420
But I am personally grateful to you, Stephanie, for the time that we first started working together, which was all the way back to the Charter Task Force.

02:04:50.420 --> 02:04:55.420
And for you being a participant to help us come up with rules.

02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:57.420
How do charter schools get renewed?

02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:01.420
Every group deserves the right to know what the renewal process is.

02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:11.420
And we needed that reform to clarify that, to provide guidelines for how new charters can be established and how there can be accountability.

02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:15.420
And I want to thank you for leading in a way that was always fair and balanced.

02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:23.420
And you've done a service to the field and you've done a service at the California Department of Education and the State Board of Education.

02:05:23.420 --> 02:05:26.420
And you are appreciated and you will be missed.

02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:39.420
And through the president and chair, if we could, could we show our appreciation for Stephanie Farland for your service at the Department of Education.

02:05:39.420 --> 02:05:44.420
And we do have a little something for you and we have some parting gifts, but you have our thanks.

02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:50.420
And just know that in your new role, which is also education related, we will be calling you.

02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:57.420
And I'd like to acknowledge two new staff who are joining the department that you will see here at the board.

02:05:57.420 --> 02:06:03.420
One is Robert Perez, who is joining as Southern California liaison.

02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:12.420
This means that he's someone who can go to meetings for the department and for myself in Southern California and attend meetings with me.

02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:16.420
He has a background of working in the legislature.

02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:20.420
He's worked for three different legislative bodies or members.

02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:27.420
He has a background of working with our farm worker families all across the state.

02:06:27.420 --> 02:06:38.420
He was very instrumental in his work at the UFW Foundation and making sure that we had access to PPE for farm worker families during the pandemic.

02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:42.420
As a matter of fact, we worked with him directly to secure it.

02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:46.420
And he and his team made sure that the families had access to it.

02:06:46.420 --> 02:06:48.420
We're grateful to have him come on board.

02:06:48.420 --> 02:06:52.420
And then the next person is coming on board is also no stranger to this work.

02:06:53.420 --> 02:07:09.420
Dr. Erica Torres, who many of you have known recently as the administrator at Inglewood Unified School District, is coming on board as a deputy superintendent to work on a number of issues, including strategy, policy and special initiatives.

02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:14.420
She will be leading a strategic plan process for the California Department of Education.

02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:21.420
We want every one of our near 2000 employees to be able to connect to a clear mission and vision for the work.

02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:24.420
And so we will be creating a strategic plan.

02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:35.420
And we are working on aligning all of our major grant funded initiatives to create more what I would call comparable, measurable outcomes.

02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:47.420
This state is making an enormous investment in expanded learning and community schools and TK, the Learning Recovery Block Grant, the Reading Cultures and Specialists Program.

02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:56.420
All of these programs are going to help our students bounce back from the challenges of the pandemic and create a system that's even better than what they had before.

02:07:56.420 --> 02:08:01.420
But we have to make sure that we have the ability to show the impact of these programs.

02:08:02.420 --> 02:08:13.420
And so Dr. Torres' work will help us to align these programs and to be able to increase our reporting efficiency to show the deep impact that these programs have all across the state.

02:08:13.420 --> 02:08:18.420
So thank you for welcoming Robert Perez and Dr. Torres to the program.

02:08:18.420 --> 02:08:26.420
And with your concurrence, Madam President, I would like to present a certificate of our appreciation to Stephanie Farland.

02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:28.420
I think that's a great idea.

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:40.420
And I would also just like to add our thanks to Stephanie for her great work, for her professionalism, for her sensitivity, her dedication to the state board and CDE team.

02:08:40.420 --> 02:08:42.420
We're going to miss you.

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:54.420
I know Stephanie has deep knowledge of public education that stems from her past experience where she started in Sacramento as a teacher of history and government at Hiram Johnson High School.

02:08:54.420 --> 02:08:58.420
And then she was a senior consultant for the California School Boards Association.

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.420
And we want to add a certificate also from the state board.

02:09:02.420 --> 02:09:08.420
And thanks to Stephanie for her wonderful work for all of our students as well as for us.

02:09:24.420 --> 02:09:46.420
Thank you.

02:09:46.420 --> 02:09:59.420
Hello.

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:00.420
A little unexpected.

02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:02.420
So I'll make it very brief.

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:07.420
But I very much appreciate Superintendent Thurman's words.

02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:14.420
It really, and President Darling-Hammond's words, it's really been a pleasure working at the department.

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:26.420
I have an unbelievably fabulous staff, as you can see via the items that come to you and all the work that goes into the work that we do in the charter schools division.

02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:32.420
The superintendent has been a great leader in this area and really one of the most supportive bosses I've ever had.

02:10:32.420 --> 02:10:34.420
So it's been great.

02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:36.420
It's been a learning experience for me.

02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:47.420
And I just am so blessed and, you know, so much wiser having worked in the department the last three and a half years with such incredible people.

02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:57.420
And I will also say that I also really, really like the state board staff and they've been supportive and you have fabulous people on your staff as well.

02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:03.420
And I just loved coming up, meeting you, getting to know Cynthia and Sharon through the charter work has been awesome.

02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:05.420
So really, I appreciate it.

02:11:05.420 --> 02:11:07.420
And I am staying in education.

02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:10.420
I will be still continuing to work with charter authorizers around the state.

02:11:10.420 --> 02:11:12.420
So I'm very excited about that work.

02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:16.420
And I know everything that I have learned the last three and a half years will add to that.

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:22.420
So thank you.

02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:23.420
Thanks again, Stephanie.

02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:28.420
We will be calling you and we appreciate you again.

02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:41.420
I do want the board to know and the SBE staff to know that during the transition, Stephanie has been very gracious of giving us extra time to work on a number of items as she prepares the transition into her new role.

02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:54.420
During the transition, we will be asking Deputy Superintendent Nancy Portillo to serve as a liaison to the board for any questions that you all have about charter items.

02:11:54.420 --> 02:12:02.420
She will be presenting at the board meeting and working closely with our charter division staff until the position is filled.

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:04.420
We will be actively posting it and recruiting.

02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:09.420
But Nancy is someone who has worked in the charter community.

02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:19.420
She has been a leader and administrator at a charter school, is very knowledgeable about the policies about charter schools and equity and serving students wherever they attend.

02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:25.420
And we're grateful to have her interim support during this time of transition.

02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:27.420
And this concludes my report.

02:12:27.420 --> 02:12:29.420
Thank you so much.

02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:37.420
And at this moment, we're going to reconvene on item two because we do now have the technology all lined up.

02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:44.420
You have received in your inbox board members at about 1058 a.m. from Brooks a copy of the slides.

02:12:44.420 --> 02:12:47.420
So everybody should have them multiple ways.

02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:50.420
And hopefully all the versions agree with each other now.

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:52.420
And thank you, Sarah.

02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:57.420
Please help us to see them on the screen.

02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:03.420
We had computers that were not talking to each other properly previously.

02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:06.420
There we go.

02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:20.420
OK, so the motion is to adopt the recommendations with the amendments in red for the criteria to define verified data.

02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:29.420
Number two, that we add an authorizer may consider evidence of the impacts of global pandemic or natural disasters on participation.

02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:36.420
This is in relation to participation rates and may waive this requirement if there is evidence that selection bias has not occurred.

02:13:36.420 --> 02:13:44.420
For example, the school has not excluded students who are likely to score lower on average than students who took the assessment.

02:13:44.420 --> 02:13:45.420
That's the first one.

02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:53.420
Second one, with respect to verified data, number four, adding to the CDE recommendation.

02:13:53.420 --> 02:14:05.420
The data include all student groups that have at least 11 students using the groups and minimum size for reporting from the California School Dashboard for assessments that report student data for those groups.

02:14:05.420 --> 02:14:07.420
So we expect to see it.

02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:12.420
The next one, data use procedure number six.

02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:24.420
This has to do with comparing students by in student groups in the verified data to the CASP performance.

02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:29.420
And this is where the question about student group norms comes up.

02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:34.420
And it would add this statement.

02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:40.420
The entire school shall present data for the student groups whose CASP performance placed the school in the middle or low performance category.

02:14:40.420 --> 02:14:50.420
When appropriate data for those student groups is available, appropriate data will meet the minimum end size for the student group and wherever possible be considered in terms of student group norms.

02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:54.420
Because there was this debate about whether the publishers do or don't provide it.

02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.420
If they do provide it, it should be considered.

02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:12.420
And then the last one is simply to, when mentioning methodologies for analyzing CASP data, clarify that that can include core student growth percentile methodology.

02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:16.420
And those are the amendments.

02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:18.420
So I'm making this motion.

02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:20.420
Do we have a second?

02:15:20.420 --> 02:15:21.420
Thank you.

02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:27.420
Member Glover-Woods, is there any further discussion of the motion?

02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:29.420
Member Rodriguez?

02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:40.420
I just want to extend my compliments to all of the work that went in in preparing this to WestED.

02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:46.420
And I'd like to thank the public commenters as well.

02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:52.420
And this conversation that we had was incredibly eye opening for me.

02:15:52.420 --> 02:16:05.420
And I learned so much from this process and I really appreciate being on this board and listening, listening to our partners and the work that's going forward.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:09.420
So thank you.

02:16:09.420 --> 02:16:14.420
Here is seeing no other hands and apparently no other discussion.

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:15.420
I think we can call for the vote.

02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.420
How do you want to do that, Brooks?

02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:19.420
Just raise your hand.

02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:20.420
Okay.

02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:24.420
All those in favor of the motion as amended say aye.

02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:26.420
Any opposed say nay.

02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:28.420
Any abstentions?

02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:29.420
All right.

02:16:29.420 --> 02:16:30.420
The motion carries.

02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:35.420
Thank you very much for hanging in with this complicated set of questions.

02:16:35.420 --> 02:16:41.420
And with that, we're going to move on to item number three, because you had a very long break already.

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:46.420
So we'll try to go until lunch if we can.

02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:58.420
And item three is the approval of the recommended summative alternate English language proficiency assessments for California threshold for meeting reclassification criterion one.

02:16:58.420 --> 02:17:26.420
And the CDE recommends that we approve the state superintendent of public instruction's proposed use of summative alternative LPAC overall performance level three, fluent English proficient to satisfy the English language proficiency criterion for reclassification decision making, beginning with the 2022-23 summative alternate LPAC administration for English learner students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

02:17:26.420 --> 02:17:29.420
Enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12.

02:17:29.420 --> 02:17:41.420
And this item will be presented by Sarah Neville-Morgan, Alicia Moreno Ramirez, and Kelly Bucker of the CDE, Molly Faulkner Bond of WestJet, and Patricia Barron of ETS.

02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:42.420
It does take a village.

02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:53.420
Welcome, Sarah.

02:17:53.420 --> 02:17:55.420
Do you have your microphone on?

02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:57.420
Let's be sure you're...

02:17:57.420 --> 02:17:58.420
Now it is.

02:17:58.420 --> 02:18:02.420
So the hard, hard job this morning of just introducing everybody.

02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:03.420
So good morning.

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:08.420
I'm Sarah Neville-Morgan, deputy superintendent with the California Department of Education.

02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:16.420
So really want to appreciate President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, and board members for having us here this morning to present this item.

02:18:16.420 --> 02:18:32.420
With me, I will have Alicia Moreno Ramirez, director of the multilingual support division, Dr. Kelly Batcher, assessment development and administration division, psychometrics evaluation and data office administrator.

02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:44.420
They will be helping co-present along with Molly Faulkner Bond, a senior research associate, regional educational laboratory west or rail west at WestJet.

02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:48.420
And Dr. Patricia Barron, strategic advisor of ETS.

02:18:48.420 --> 02:18:58.420
So we will be bringing an action item before you all today, which means we will be putting forth some items that we hope you move forward.

02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:01.420
And with that, I'm going to bring Alicia up here.

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:06.420
See, I told you I had the really tough part this morning.

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:09.420
Thank you, Sarah.

02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:15.420
Good morning, Superintendent Thurman, President Darlene Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods, and board members.

02:19:15.420 --> 02:19:19.420
I'm Alicia Moreno Ramirez, director of the multilingual support division.

02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:23.420
Today's presentation will cover the following.

02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:37.420
We will provide an overview of the California Department of Education's or CDE's recommendation for approval of performance level three on the summative alternate English language proficiency assessments for California or LPAC in the following manner.

02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:40.420
First, we'll provide you with the CDE's recommendation for approval.

02:19:40.420 --> 02:19:52.420
Next, we will explain the context behind the use of the summative alternate LPAC for determining the overall proficiency level needed to reach fluent English proficiency and eligibility for reclassification.

02:19:52.420 --> 02:20:02.420
Then we'll share reclassification study results in the two studies conducted to support this recommendation, the threshold validation study and the supplemental empirical analyses.

02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:07.420
We'll respond to any questions from the SBE and the public and provide clarification when necessary.

02:20:07.420 --> 02:20:14.420
And finally, we'll return to CDE's recommendation for State Board of Education action.

02:20:14.420 --> 02:20:21.420
In this section of the presentation, I'll provide you with an overview of the CDE's recommendation for approval before you today.

02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:26.420
The CDE recommends that the California State Board of Education approve the following.

02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:51.420
Proposed use of the summative alternate LPAC overall performance level or PL3, fluent English proficient, to satisfy the English language proficiency criterion for reclassification decision making, beginning with the 2022-23 summative alternate LPAC administration for English learner or EL students with the most significant cognitive disabilities enrolled in kindergarten through grade 12.

02:20:51.420 --> 02:21:05.420
In this section, I will review the context around the use of the alternate LPAC for determining the English language proficiency level of EL students with the most significant cognitive disabilities who may be eligible for reclassification to fluent English proficiency.

02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:16.420
The development of the alternate LPAC for EL students with the most significant cognitive disabilities is the first of its kind in the state and is a demonstration of California's commitment to innovation and rigor.

02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:22.420
The design is focused on equity and helps standardize students' reclassification experiences.

02:21:22.420 --> 02:21:45.420
As this issue reflects the intersection of student experience, the CDE engaged with cross-division collaboration among the multilingual support, assessment development administration, and special education divisions and has elicited the input of interest holders in the areas of assessment, special education, and multilingual learning in preparation for advancing this recommendation.

02:21:45.420 --> 02:22:02.420
English learner students who are enrolled in a California school beginning in any grade level kindergarten through grade 12 have a language other than English identified on the home language survey and upon assessment demonstrated a level of English language proficiency that indicates EL programs and services are necessary.

02:22:02.420 --> 02:22:12.420
Students identified as English learners receive programs and services until they meet the reclassification criteria pursuant to Education Code Section 313.

02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:25.420
Dually identified students specifically are those who are identified as English learners and as children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Act as defined in 20 U.S. Code Section 14.01.3.A.

02:22:25.420 --> 02:22:35.420
Dually identified students receive both EL programs and services and special education and related services.

02:22:35.420 --> 02:23:04.420
More specifically, dually identified students are entitled to all services and supports for students with disabilities, including in the Individualized Education Plan or IEP or Section 504 plan, inclusion in the regular education program, and a free and appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, as well as all services and supports for EL students including, but not limited to, integrated and designated English language development instruction.

02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:12.420
And participation in annual language assessment with a goal or expectation of reclassification and exit from EL status.

02:23:12.420 --> 02:23:20.420
Dually identified students with the most significant cognitive disabilities are identified by local IEP teams.

02:23:20.420 --> 02:23:40.420
The four reclassification criteria found in Education Code Section 313F provide an expectation of what is needed for an English learner student, including dually identified students, to be considered proficient beginning with the assessment of English language proficiency level.

02:23:40.420 --> 02:23:49.420
Reclassification is a comprehensive process where all four criteria are to be met for a student to be considered for reclassification.

02:23:49.420 --> 02:24:00.420
The SBE approves the threshold for Criterion 1, and LEAs may determine locally which measures may be used to meet Criterion 2, 3, and 4.

02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:13.420
Criterion 1 is assessment of language proficiency using an objective assessment instrument, but not limited to the English language development test that is developed or acquired pursuant to Section 60810.

02:24:13.420 --> 02:24:19.420
Criterion 2, teacher evaluation including, but not limited to, a review of the pupil's curriculum mastery.

02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:23.420
Criterion 3, parental opinion and consultation.

02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:38.420
And Criterion 4, comparison of the performance of the pupil in basic skills that demonstrates whether the pupil is sufficiently proficient in English to participate effectively in a curriculum designed for pupils of the same age whose native language is English.

02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:48.420
It's important to note that reclassification of a dually identified student is a process that is centered around a specific student and their IEP team.

02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:55.420
As such, Criterion 2 through 4 are equally central to this process as they focus on educator and family consultation.

02:24:55.420 --> 02:25:08.420
Now I'll hand the presentation over to Dr. Kelly Bacher to discuss some additional details about the alternate LPAC assessment and the analyses that inform the recommendation before you today.

02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:25.420
Thank you Alicia. Good morning Superintendent Thurmond, Deputy Superintendent Guillen, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods and board members, and Kelly Bacher, I'm the administrator of the psychometrics evaluation and data office in the assessment division here at CDE.

02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:31.420
Participation in the ELP assessment is required of all English learner students.

02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:41.420
And the range of assessment participation options for dually identified students includes full participation in the general summit of LPAC with accommodations,

02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:46.420
partial participation in the summit of LPAC with domain exemptions,

02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:53.420
and participation in the alternate LPAC when a student's IEP team has determined that they should take alternate assessments.

02:25:53.420 --> 02:26:03.420
For these eligible students, the alternate for all or alt for all approach allows students who take one alternate assessment to take all alternate assessments.

02:26:03.420 --> 02:26:14.420
So for example, a student who takes the California alternate assessment for English language arts, the CAA for ELA, will also take the alternate LPAC if they are an English learner student.

02:26:14.420 --> 02:26:25.420
And in the 2021-22 administration, approximately 17,000 students in grades K through 12 took the alternate LPAC.

02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:30.420
So let's briefly review the development and the current guidance of the alternate LPAC.

02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:39.420
In May of 2019, the SBE approved the high level test design for the alternate LPAC and a year later approved the test blueprint.

02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:49.420
Between June of 2020 and October of the next year, ETS developed the assessment, which was followed by the operational field test through May of 2022.

02:26:49.420 --> 02:27:02.420
In February and March of 2022, ETS conducted standard setting workshops with panels of educators who established the thresholds for alternate LPAC level one through level three.

02:27:02.420 --> 02:27:10.420
These thresholds were reviewed by our California assessment system technical advisory group and various stakeholders.

02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:23.420
And in the process of the standard setting workshop, the panel defined performance level three as fluent English proficient and further defined students at level three as having sufficient English language proficiency

02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:30.420
and may need occasional linguistic support to access adapted grade level content in English.

02:27:30.420 --> 02:27:40.420
Now, because students who take the alternate LPAC are a heterogeneous group, there is no one definition that fits or one student profile that fits this level three definition,

02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:51.420
but rather students arrive at proficiency having different disabilities, using different communication modes, and receiving individualized education programs and support.

02:27:51.420 --> 02:28:03.420
The panel judgments informed our recommended thresholds in May of 2022 that were approved by the state board that included the definition of level three as fluent English proficient.

02:28:03.420 --> 02:28:13.420
And at the time, the next steps were to identify and conduct follow-up analyses to empirically evaluate and confirm the thresholds for the purpose of reclassification.

02:28:14.420 --> 02:28:27.420
So since October of last year, REL West has partnered with CDE to coach our staff to evaluate the approved thresholds, which has brought us to our recommendation today.

02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:41.420
And in April, the CDE provided the SBE with a memorandum that described the results of two studies, the purposes of which were to evaluate the thresholds using information from the student performance on the alternate LPAC,

02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:47.420
educator judgments and student performance on the California alternate assessment in English language arts.

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:53.420
So now I would like to invite my virtual co-presenters to share information about these two studies.

02:28:53.420 --> 02:29:00.420
Dr. Patricia Barron is going first, and she'll be presenting on behalf of VTS to provide an overview of the threshold validation study.

02:29:00.420 --> 02:29:12.420
Thank you, Dr. Bakker, and good morning Superintendent Thurman, Deputy Superintendent Guillen, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover-Woods and board members.

02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:16.420
I'm Patricia Barron with VTS, and I'm very happy to be here with you today.

02:29:16.420 --> 02:29:25.420
The purpose of the alternate LPAC validation study was to evaluate the threshold scores approved by the SBE in May 2022.

02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:35.420
The threshold scores provided performance levels for students taking the summative alternate LPAC in 2021-22.

02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:45.420
Data for the study included student performance levels based on two processes, alternate LPAC test scores derived from the standard setting process,

02:29:45.420 --> 02:29:50.420
alternate LPAC test scores derived from the standard setting process,

02:29:50.420 --> 02:30:04.420
and student performance level judgment data collected using an in-test survey that educators completed at the beginning of the operational field test administration and prior to testing the same students.

02:30:04.420 --> 02:30:19.420
Both groups of educators use the SBE approved descriptors to describe the three performance levels, Novice English Learner, Level 1, Intermediate English Learner, Level 2, and Fluent English Proficient, Level 3.

02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:22.420
Next slide, please.

02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:33.420
The results indicated moderate agreement between educator ratings and threshold scores overall and identified some trends by grade level and by performance level.

02:30:33.420 --> 02:30:47.420
The percent agreement between educators ratings and the alternate LPAC thresholds ranged from 72.4% to 80.5% and the overall percent agreement was 73.3%.

02:30:47.420 --> 02:31:02.420
These results provide support for the threshold scores for the alternate LPAC as educator judgments of the students based on classroom observation mostly concurred with classifications based on assessment scores.

02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.420
There was also a trend observed across data collection methods.

02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:24.420
That is, the results from the standard setting and the classroom observation studies suggested that the percentage of students classified as Fluent English Proficient increased as student grade level increased from kindergarten through grade 12.

02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:34.420
Now I'd like to pass for the second study to Rell West who provided the CDE with coaching and technical support to conduct their analyses.

02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:39.420
It's my pleasure to pass to Dr. Faulkner-Bond who will introduce the empirical analyses.

02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:43.420
Thank you.

02:31:43.420 --> 02:31:54.420
Thank you, Dr. Barron and good morning Superintendent Thurman, Deputy Superintendent Guillen, President Darling-Hammond, Vice President Glover Woods and board members.

02:31:54.420 --> 02:32:01.420
As Dr. Barron stated, Rell West provided coaching to the CDE to apply the methods for the second study.

02:32:01.420 --> 02:32:11.420
Rell West also supported the CDE by independently replicating the CDE's findings and aiding the CDE in the interpretations and recommendations from the results.

02:32:11.420 --> 02:32:14.420
Next slide please.

02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:20.420
The methods the CDE used in this project were developed in 2012 with support from the US Department of Education.

02:32:20.420 --> 02:32:33.420
The methods were specifically designed to support state education agency personnel and technical assistance providers in using empirical data to inform decisions about thresholds and policy for English learner reclassification.

02:32:33.420 --> 02:32:42.420
They involve three approaches that use ELP assessment and content achievement data to identify appropriate ELP cut scores for reclassification.

02:32:42.420 --> 02:32:51.420
The methods were developed using real student data from multiple states and have since been used in other states and in California to inform the setting of thresholds on summative ELP assessments.

02:32:51.420 --> 02:32:56.420
They have also been used to inform the threshold set on other alternate ELP assessments.

02:32:56.420 --> 02:32:59.420
Next slide please.

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:16.420
The methods are designed to reflect the language and logic of the two most recent recent reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act by supporting states to identify the point at which language proficiency and academic achievement become slightly less tightly coupled for students who are assessed in both areas.

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:28.420
Specifically, the methods propose that researchers can define English language proficient as the point at which EL students academic content achievement assessed using English becomes less related to their ELP.

02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:30.420
Next slide please.

02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:38.420
To unpack the logic a bit more, we know that students who are not yet proficient in English generally do poorly on assessments that are administered in English.

02:33:39.420 --> 02:33:45.420
So leaving aside the validity concerns that underlie this, this means that there is typically a strong relationship between the two assessments.

02:33:45.420 --> 02:33:50.420
Students who do poorly in ELP also tend to do poorly in academic content.

02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:59.420
At some point though, when students have sufficient English proficiency to meaningfully interact with the assessment, we should start to see a broader range of academic performance.

02:33:59.420 --> 02:34:06.420
As with all students, we'll expect that some students will be very good at say mathematics, many will be average and some will really struggle.

02:34:06.420 --> 02:34:15.420
This would mean that students with the same level of ELP may have a much broader range of academic content scores, leading to a less strong relationship between the two assessments.

02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:25.420
The methods authors argue that at or beyond this point is where the ELP performance standard might be considered and empirical procedures can help to identify this level of performance.

02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:33.420
So now to share the results of the CDE application of these methods, I will hand this back to Dr. Kelly Bacher.

02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:36.420
Thank you, Dr. Faulkner-Bond.

02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:45.420
So in a moment, I will give a high level overview of each of the statistical methods that we.

02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.420
Over here.

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:55.420
So in a moment, I will give an overview of each of the statistical methods that we use to inform our recommendation.

02:34:55.420 --> 02:35:07.420
But first, we thought it would be helpful to state here right at the outset that it is our conclusion that the analysis confirm alternate LPAC level 3 as the appropriate threshold where language and content become less related.

02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:17.420
And this is based on over 60 analyses of alternate LPAC students in grades 3 through 8 and 11 who also had CAA for ELA scores.

02:35:17.420 --> 02:35:22.420
And there are some limitations and considerations to the data that we included in this analysis.

02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:30.420
The first being that because we are including ELA assessment scores, the data are necessarily limited to the grade that which we administer the ELA assessment.

02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:34.420
So these next few slides will include information on grades 3 through 8 and 11.

02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:40.420
And second, these data were collected in the very first administration of the alternate LPAC.

02:35:40.420 --> 02:35:46.420
So it's possible that the performance of students in this very first year may differ from future years.

02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:53.420
So because of this, the CDE is recommending a number of follow up analyses as more years of data and information become available.

02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:59.420
So on the next few slides, I'll show some examples of the results that informed our recommendation.

02:36:01.420 --> 02:36:11.420
The first method is called descriptive box plots, and it helps us determine at what alternate LPAC level or at least half the students proficient on the ELA assessment.

02:36:11.420 --> 02:36:21.420
So to orient us to this figure on the horizontal or X axis, we have students grouped by their performance level on alternate LPAC 1, 2, and 3.

02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:33.420
We also have student performance for the student groups of English only, EO, initial fluent English proficient or IFEP, and reclassified fluent English proficient or RFEP.

02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:41.420
TBD students are those whose English language proficiency has not yet been determined by an assessment and tends to be a very small group of students.

02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:49.420
And on the vertical or Y axis, we have the CAA for ELA scale score.

02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:56.420
These box and whisker plots show the distribution of ELA scores for each of these groups of students.

02:36:56.420 --> 02:37:05.420
And you can think of these plots as a traditional bell curve that's kind of been flopped on its side where the majority of students are within that large rectangle with fewer out at the tail ends.

02:37:06.420 --> 02:37:18.420
So one conclusion from this figure is we can see that alternate LPAC level 3 students, roughly half of them are scoring at or above proficiency on the ELA assessment.

02:37:18.420 --> 02:37:23.420
The proficiency line is indicated by that red horizontal at 460.

02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:26.420
So that's our proficiency point for ELA.

02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:41.420
Another take home from this figure is that our LPAC performance levels are performing and functioning as we intended in that as the performance levels go up, so does the distribution on the ELA assessment as we'd expected.

02:37:42.420 --> 02:37:59.420
It's also worth noting that we can see students who are in alternate LPAC level 3 are outperforming their EO, IFEP, and RFEP peers, the latter of which, the RFEP group, was previously reclassified based on locally determined criteria.

02:38:00.420 --> 02:38:09.420
So we do expect that the trends for IFEP and RFEP students may change over time as the field grows more familiar with the assessment and the use of these thresholds.

02:38:10.420 --> 02:38:23.420
I will also note here that whenever possible, we also looked at the results for our two largest disability groups, which were students with autism and students with intellectual disabilities, and the results were remarkably consistent with the overall sample.

02:38:23.420 --> 02:38:26.420
And that was true for all three of our methods we used.

02:38:29.420 --> 02:38:32.420
Our second method is called logistic regression.

02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:42.420
And the goal here is to find at what point on the alternate LPAC score scale do students have a 50% likelihood of scoring proficiently on the ELA assessment.

02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:57.420
And we focus on 50% because that would mean a student has a roughly even likelihood of being proficient or not on the ELA assessment and kind of gets at that uncoupling of the two assessments that Dr. Faulkner-Bahn was referring to a few minutes ago.

02:38:58.420 --> 02:39:06.420
So on this figure, on the horizontal or X axis, we have the range of scale scores on the alternate LPAC.

02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:17.420
On the Y axis, we have the probability of proficiency on the ELA assessment, and that 50% mark we've got our eye on is indicated with that red horizontal line.

02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:25.420
The dashed vertical lines indicate where the cut scores or the thresholds are for the alternate LPAC at this grade.

02:39:25.420 --> 02:39:32.420
We're showing you an example today of grade four, so we can see where the cut score is for performance level two and performance level three.

02:39:34.420 --> 02:39:43.420
So what we see from this figure is that our blue regression line is crossing the 50% probability likelihood within alternate LPAC level three.

02:39:43.420 --> 02:40:03.420
So given that, as we saw on a prior slide, English-only students tended to not be performing proficiently on the ELA assessment, we decided to conduct what we called an equity check by rerunning the logistic regression method but altering the target.

02:40:03.420 --> 02:40:15.420
So instead of having the target be level three proficiency on the ELA assessment, we decided to use the midpoint of level two or between level two and three as the target.

02:40:16.420 --> 02:40:27.420
We thought that using this as the target might better reflect the wording of reclassification criterion four that talks about the performance of English learners relative to their English proficient peers.

02:40:28.420 --> 02:40:35.420
And with this as the target, alternate LPAC level three also works for most grades as a performance threshold.

02:40:40.420 --> 02:40:51.420
And the logic for our final method, which is called decision consistency, is to identify the score range on the alternate LPAC at which the most students are consistently classified using both assessments.

02:40:52.420 --> 02:41:03.420
So consistency here means that both the ELA assessment and the ELP assessment are deeming the student to be proficient or both of them are saying not proficient.

02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:12.420
So either of those would be considered consistent classifications. And what we're trying to do is minimize the instances where students are proficient on one assessment but not the other.

02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:25.420
So on the horizontal x-axis here, we again have the alternate LPAC performance levels. Here we have split them into smaller buckets, if you will, of low and high for each level.

02:41:26.420 --> 02:41:37.420
On the y-axis, we have the percentage of students who are consistently classified and again is either proficient on both assessments or not proficient on either.

02:41:38.420 --> 02:41:49.420
With this method, what we're hoping to see is an inflection point where the consistency either decreases or starts plateauing to indicate that we are maximizing the decision consistency.

02:41:50.420 --> 02:41:59.420
And for this figure, the results are clearest for grade three, which shows a peak in consistent classifications at the lower end of alternate LPAC level three.

02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:13.420
The other grades here don't show a similar peak, but they do affirm that across the scale score continuum, the consistent classifications are highest within alternate LPAC performance level three.

02:42:16.420 --> 02:42:25.420
And with this method, we also conducted a similar equity check using the midpoint of performance level two on the ELA assessment as the target.

02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:34.420
And with this as the target, we can see that all grades now show a clear point of inflection, beyond which the percentage of classifications is decreasing.

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:43.420
And looking across the grades, we can see that this peak is occurring either at the lower end of performance level three or the upper end of performance level two.

02:42:44.420 --> 02:42:50.420
So these exploratory results affirm that alternate LPAC level three is an appropriate reclassification threshold.

02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:58.420
So in summary, the threshold validation study compared and contrasted student performance on the alternate LPAC with educator judgments.

02:42:59.420 --> 02:43:07.420
And the supplemental empirical analyses evaluated the relationship between performance on the alternate LPAC and the CAA for ELA assessment.

02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:16.420
And taken together, the results of these two studies support the use of alternate LPAC performance level three as an appropriate threshold for reclassification criterion one.

02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:25.420
So I'd now like to welcome back Alicia Moreno-Ramirez to share our implementation plan and present the recommendation that's before you today.

02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:37.420
Thank you, Dr. Bacher. Pending SBE approval, resources, and support for implementation will include guidance letter to the field, confirming summative alternate LPAC overall level, overall performance level of the SBA.

02:43:37.420 --> 02:43:59.420
Thank you, Dr. Bacher. Pending SBE approval, resources, and support for implementation will include guidance letter to the field, confirming summative alternate LPAC overall level, overall performance level three for reclassification, and technical assistance webinars to address the reclassification process.

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:09.420
Content updates will also be made to the reclassification webpage on CDE's website and the LPAC.org webpage and the annual LPAC information guide.

02:44:10.420 --> 02:44:14.420
There will be a robust layer of tools and supports to guide educators in the field.

02:44:17.420 --> 02:44:19.420
I will now restate the CDE's recommendation.

02:44:20.420 --> 02:44:24.420
The CDE recommends that the California State Board of Education approve the following.

02:44:25.420 --> 02:44:37.420
An overall level three fluent English proficient on the summative alternate LPAC to meet criterion one of the four reclassification criteria for English learner students with the most significant cognitive disabilities.

02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:43.420
Thank you for your consideration and at this time we will welcome any clarifying questions about the work we've presented today.

02:44:49.420 --> 02:44:58.420
All right. Thank you very much. I think we want to put up the call-in slide for the public comment.

02:44:59.420 --> 02:45:08.420
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:16.420
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask member Escobedo and member Yoshimoto-Towry if they have any initial comments.

02:45:17.420 --> 02:45:21.420
Then we'll go to any clarifying questions and then we will go to public comment.

02:45:22.420 --> 02:45:23.420
So member Escobedo.

02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:35.420
I just want to share that last week's regional meeting with the English learner specialist was a significant topic of duly identified students.

02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:44.420
And it seems the vast majority of the students are duly identified is because of other learning disabilities and speech and language.

02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:50.420
So it should be very interesting in the implementation of this recommendation if we do pass it.

02:45:51.420 --> 02:45:59.420
How would that percentage decrease or not, depending on those who are in level three.

02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:13.420
And I think this is really a good step for us to look into because many of these duly identified students never get reclassified.

02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:23.420
And definitely these last two items is challenging our psychometric acumen.

02:46:24.420 --> 02:46:33.420
So I truly appreciate the logic models, the validation studies that were fascinating.

02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:35.420
My head kind of hurts.

02:46:36.420 --> 02:46:54.420
But no, no, thank you for the amazing explanation and also the effects of this decision for many of our students that are, I don't want to say in limbo, but in a place where they stayed as duly identified students.

02:46:56.420 --> 02:46:57.420
Thank you very much.

02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:00.420
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:10.420
Just a second that I just want to commend the department for looking at the needs of students who qualify for both special education services and English learner services.

02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:15.420
And I think it's critical for us to do that as much as possible, even when not required by law.

02:47:16.420 --> 02:47:17.420
Thank you.

02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:21.420
Thank you. Are there any clarifying questions?

02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:25.420
We can get into the deeper discussion after public comment.

02:47:26.420 --> 02:47:30.420
And so with that, I'm going to move us to public comment.

02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:33.420
Do you have any in-person?

02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:37.420
There is no one signed up for in-person public comment.

02:47:38.420 --> 02:47:40.420
Any public comment on the phone line?

02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:42.420
We do not have any callers in the queue.

02:47:42.420 --> 02:47:43.420
All right.

02:47:46.420 --> 02:47:47.420
Don't get too excited.

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:50.420
But I do think I do want to also voice my appreciation.

02:47:50.420 --> 02:47:55.420
And I actually do want to ask for a little bit of clarification on two of the slides.

02:47:56.420 --> 02:47:58.420
Back to your point, Member Escobedo.

02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:08.420
So I'd love to see slide 20, 21 and 23 again and ask a question about that.

02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:16.420
So I'd love to see slide 20, 21 and 23 again and ask a question about that.

02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:28.420
Yes, and I may phone a friend in Mali.

02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:34.420
And I just want to be sure, did we make this transition at a time when everybody had finished presenting?

02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:36.420
Yes.

02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:37.420
Okay. All right. Great.

02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:41.420
There were so many parts of the presentation.

02:48:42.420 --> 02:48:59.420
So if you look at slide 20, the one right before this one, you can see that the 50% chance happens well into PL3.

02:49:00.420 --> 02:49:16.420
But so before that, at the cut score for PL3, there's much less than a 50% chance that students will be scoring proficient on the CAA.

02:49:17.420 --> 02:49:28.420
So that's one question I have is like that certainly as you briefed it, in that band is where you hit that 50% mark.

02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:31.420
But it happens well into the band, it looks like.

02:49:32.420 --> 02:50:00.420
And then if you go to 23, you know, the inflection point for I can't discern all of the different ones, but for some grade levels starts earlier, starts at PL2H, right, at the higher level of performance level 2.

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:12.420
And so my question is that one could imagine a decision which would use PL2 or PL2 and a half as the cut point rather than PL3.

02:50:12.420 --> 02:50:21.420
And I'd like to hear sort of an argument for why three is a better place to hit that cut point than say two or two and a half.

02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:23.420
Sure. Yes. Those are great questions.

02:50:23.420 --> 02:50:33.420
So I will give my response and then I will invite Molly Faulkner-Bahn to hop on and Alicia as well as some of the considerations when we came to our recommendation here.

02:50:33.420 --> 02:50:36.420
So if I can go back to this one here.

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:50.420
Yes. So an argument could be made based on this slide that in fact upper in the level 3, right, above the cut score for level 3 could be a good place for reclassification recommendations.

02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:56.420
I will say that this is a grade for example and of course every grade has a slightly different curve.

02:50:56.420 --> 02:51:00.420
As we went up the grades, this curve does tend to shift even further to the right.

02:51:00.420 --> 02:51:03.420
So that's something to be aware of.

02:51:03.420 --> 02:51:09.420
Whereas as you said on slide 23, we have an argument could be made for it to be a bit lower.

02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:17.420
So when we had a lot of discussions about coming to this recommendation today and really trying to take all of the pieces together.

02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:27.420
Whereas some set a little high, some set a little low and taking into account the information from the standard setting panel and their definition of level 3.

02:51:27.420 --> 02:51:43.420
And also discussing with some interest holders in terms of what is the more appropriate decision in terms of providing service, removing services too early, right, or continuing students in services that are no longer needed and kind of that push and pull with that.

02:51:44.420 --> 02:51:47.420
And Dr. Faulkner-Bahn, is there anything you'd like to add to that?

02:51:50.420 --> 02:52:00.420
Yes, just to underscore that I think Kelly shared previously, but these are based on a single year of data from the first time the assessment was administered.

02:52:00.420 --> 02:52:04.420
And so I think this will be an important thing to continue to monitor.

02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:10.420
And it's possible with more information that a different conclusion could be considered.

02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:24.420
But as Kelly said, really what's high stakes about these decisions is that tension between premature removal of English learner services that students may still need versus maintaining them in services that they may no longer need and that could affect their access to other services.

02:52:25.420 --> 02:52:32.420
And so given that there was a little bit of fuzziness, the recommendation presented here is the one that we think strikes the best balance.

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:38.420
But additional information would certainly be helpful and could be revisited at a future time.

02:52:41.420 --> 02:52:44.420
Are there other questions from members of the board?

02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:48.420
Member Escobedo, you look like you're going to get caught.

02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:56.420
Also slide 19 was interesting because it goes in the same line as Dr. Hammond's point.

02:52:57.420 --> 02:53:07.420
When you look at those students in PL2, and I know there'll be fluctuation from year to year on both sides, right?

02:53:08.420 --> 02:53:20.420
But it seems like those students are, when compared to their COT ELA score, in par with English only, IFAP, RFAP.

02:53:20.420 --> 02:53:22.420
Is that accurate?

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.420
Yes, yes.

02:53:24.420 --> 02:53:30.420
The distribution of those Level 2 students is very similar to the English proficient peers on the right-hand side.

02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:31.420
That's right.

02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:37.420
A point of clarification here that might be helpful is that, I believe Dr. Faulkner-Bahn mentioned,

02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:43.420
we had previously done basically the same set of analyses for the general LPAC when we developed that assessment.

02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:52.420
And at the time, those student groups, these English proficient groups, were at a higher level, closer to that kind of red-cut score that we see on the figure.

02:53:52.420 --> 02:53:57.420
But in large part, we think that's due to the fact that prior to the LPAC, we had the CELT, right?

02:53:57.420 --> 02:54:03.420
So we still had a standardized administration of an assessment, standardized reclassification criteria for the most part.

02:54:03.420 --> 02:54:12.420
And so students were being kind of filtered out of the ELP status into RFEP status in a more consistent manner statewide.

02:54:12.420 --> 02:54:16.420
But with the alternate LPAC, there was no statewide assessment before that.

02:54:16.420 --> 02:54:22.420
And so we don't have as much information about how students came to be classified as IFEP and RFEP.

02:54:23.420 --> 02:54:32.420
And so we do expect that if this recommendation is approved, that as students are moved from EL status at level three into the RFEP group,

02:54:32.420 --> 02:54:43.420
or IFEP in the case of the initial, that we will see those student group averages and distributions move upward over time to more mimic more closely what we saw for the general assessment.

02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:53.420
And that's because there is a double standard that the students need to meet. Is that right?

02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:57.420
In terms of the ELP and the ELA assessment? Yes.

02:54:57.420 --> 02:55:04.420
I mean, our recommendation today is focused on the ELP assessment solely, so that just that first criterion of reclassification.

02:55:05.420 --> 02:55:12.420
And I think there maybe there are more conversations to be had about the ELA assessment and how that's implemented as well with IP team.

02:55:17.420 --> 02:55:22.420
All right. Are there any other comments or questions?

02:55:22.420 --> 02:55:30.420
Just I want to just clarify one of the points that was made by one of our colleagues who beamed in from from ETS.

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:42.420
That you're trying to figure out the point at which students may no longer need services of one kind, but may also then access, she said, services of another kind.

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:56.420
And that would be programs, because in some districts, students are not able to go on into certain kind of mainstream classes and get A through G and other kinds of programming until they are reclassified.

02:55:56.420 --> 02:56:02.420
So it is a very delicate thing. You don't want to over or undershoot by too much.

02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:15.420
And that's why I think one of the things we would want to do is look at this again, look at the data again in another year, have it, you know, have this decision that we make today be one that can be evaluated over time.

02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:21.420
Any other? Yes. Member Escobedo.

02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:36.420
All right. I think we have a motion. Yes, I would like to propose the use of summative alternative LPAC overall P3 fluent English proficient to certify the ELP criterion for reclassification.

02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:49.420
Decision making beginning with the 22-23 summative alternate LPAC administration for English learner students with the most significant cognitive disabilities enrolled in kinder through 12.

02:56:49.420 --> 02:57:00.420
Thank you very much. Do I have a second? Member Lewis, did you raise your hand? OK, member Lewis has a second. All in favor. Any further discussion?

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:08.420
All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed say nay. Any abstentions? Motion passes.

02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:18.420
We are going to adjourn for lunch and we will be back here by let's say one hour from now at 1250.

02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:22.420
1251.

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:48.420
We're good. All right. Welcome back. I'd like to reconvene the board and take up the regular consent items four through eight.

02:57:48.420 --> 02:58:04.420
We'll now open the phone line for the queue for public comment on consent items four through eight and members of the public who wish to provide comment on those items may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

02:58:04.420 --> 02:58:18.420
Are there any speakers signed up to provide public comment in person? No speakers have signed up. All right. And then we will give do a little bit of waiting because there's a lag on the phone line.

02:58:18.420 --> 02:58:21.420
So we'll give it 30 seconds or so.

02:58:34.420 --> 02:58:44.420
All right. Do we have any phone commenters? No, we do not have any callers in the queue. All right. Given that there's no public comment, I will ask for a motion on consent items four through eight.

02:58:45.420 --> 02:58:58.420
Member Olken and do I have a second? Member Lewis. Thank you. All in favor say aye. Any opposed nay. Any abstentions? All right.

02:58:58.420 --> 02:59:08.420
Motion carries and we'll now take up item nine, which is the California Community Schools Partnership Program approval of cohort to implementation grantees.

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:24.420
The CDE recommends that we approve the CCSPP cohort to implementation grant awards, which are in your attachment one. The item will be presented by Steve Zimmer, Pete Callis and Hamad Razali of the CDE.

02:59:24.420 --> 02:59:27.420
Steve, nice to see you. Please begin.

02:59:32.420 --> 02:59:35.420
Make sure your mic is on.

02:59:38.420 --> 02:59:42.420
Can you hear me?

02:59:42.420 --> 02:59:45.420
Good afternoon. Thank you.

02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:59.420
Board President Darling-Hammond and to all of the board members, it is an honor to represent Superintendent Thurmond to present this item today.

02:59:59.420 --> 03:00:08.420
I will say that we bring to you the recommendation for a historic investment.

03:00:08.420 --> 03:00:37.420
$750.5 million of implementation grant funding and the possibility I believe to realize the promise of the vision of our leadership here, of this board, of the superintendent, the legislature and the governor.

03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:46.420
It is a day I think that we come to you really humbled by the possibility of what we could do here today.

03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:53.420
I want to, as we begin the presentation, I want to thank a few people.

03:00:53.420 --> 03:01:12.420
I want to thank the board president and Superintendent Thurmond for their vision and leadership and encouragement and support of us as we have as we have been given the great honor of the implementation of this program.

03:01:12.420 --> 03:01:28.420
I want to thank our team at CDE, our very small team who have worked in ways that I have rarely seen a team work to implement at the scale that we are implementing.

03:01:28.420 --> 03:01:33.420
Specifically our division director Pete Kalis, who you will hear from in just a moment.

03:01:33.420 --> 03:01:40.420
Hamed Rizali, our new administrator in the community school's office.

03:01:40.420 --> 03:01:50.420
Lisa Reimers and Kate Starr and LeGrand, our legal counsel who has worked with us closely on this.

03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:59.420
I also want to thank, and this really has been a partnership with our state board staff.

03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:12.420
I want to thank especially Rigel Massaro and Jessica Holmes for their ongoing collaboration with us every step of the way.

03:02:12.420 --> 03:02:24.420
I want to also thank our STAC, Alameda County Office of Education, a team led by Dr. Navdeep Purwal, who you met at the last board meeting.

03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:29.420
But I think most of all, I want to thank the folks in the field.

03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:50.420
The superintendent, I was honored to go with the superintendent two months ago to Fullerton to have just an inspiring opening of a facility that was only made possible through this grant.

03:02:50.420 --> 03:03:07.420
And to see their teams coming together, to see the engagement of families, of community in a way that truly had never happened before was nothing short of transformational.

03:03:07.420 --> 03:03:20.420
That's what we heard over and over and over again from students, from parents, from teachers, from community members and community based organizations.

03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:26.420
Transformative. That was the charge. That was the goal.

03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:35.420
That is what we intend to have realized in every site that we recommend for you today.

03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:50.420
So with that, I'm going to introduce Pete Callis, who's going to take you through the first set of slides and then I'll be back to talk specifically about our recommendation here today and about the implementation grants that we are recommending.

03:03:50.420 --> 03:03:55.420
Pete.

03:03:55.420 --> 03:03:58.420
Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon.

03:03:59.420 --> 03:04:07.420
So brief overview of what we've done so far with the community schools funding that we received and putting these programs together.

03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:19.420
In 2021, the legislature allocated just over $3 billion for the establishment of the California Community Schools Partnership Program to create new community schools and expand existing community schools.

03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:33.420
CDE has completed two rounds of planning grants and two rounds of implementation grants as of now, along with the selection of our lead technical assistance center and the eight regional technical assistance centers across the state.

03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:53.420
In 2022-23, the legislature allocated an additional $1.1 billion for implementation grants and extension grants going forward.

03:04:53.420 --> 03:05:06.420
There was an additional $140 million allocated during this decision for County Office of Education Coordination grants, which we've allocated some of those already this year, back in the fall.

03:05:06.420 --> 03:05:21.420
And $742,000 to create our community schools office, which is growing. We've hired a few people so far. Our division had 21 openings as of January and we filled 15 of them so far as of now.

03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:27.420
So we're moving along. The community schools office is moving along. So we'll have a lot more support for the field going forward.

03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:37.420
Also, they changed. They added two years to the program timeline, which the program timeline now is extended to 2030-31.

03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:42.420
I don't think I'm going to be here then, but we'll see.

03:05:42.420 --> 03:05:50.420
I'll still be alive, though, but just may not be around for the finish of the program.

03:05:57.420 --> 03:05:59.420
Probably Greece.

03:06:02.420 --> 03:06:11.420
Retired following my daughter's around, probably playing college softball. So 10% of the funding that we received went to our planning grantees.

03:06:11.420 --> 03:06:26.420
This winter, CDE completed round two of the planning grant allocations for 418 local education agencies were funded with planning grants totaling over $121 million and approximately $200,000 apiece for their grant.

03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:35.420
And they have two years to use that funding. The LEAs funded with planning grants did not have any existing community schools in their districts.

03:06:35.420 --> 03:06:47.420
Of the original funding that we received, the 70% of it went to implementation grants. CDE ran our second round of implementation grants this past winter.

03:06:47.420 --> 03:06:56.420
There was over $2 billion available for cohort two implementation grants, grants from the 2021 funding that we received.

03:06:56.420 --> 03:07:19.420
Implementation grants are annual for five years, up to $500,000 per grantee per year. Cohort one had 76 LEAs approved for 458 school sites funded for a total of $625,575.

03:07:26.420 --> 03:07:39.420
All right, now I'm going to turn it back over to Steve. He's going to take us forward with round two of the implementation grants and our next steps for this year and next year. Thank you.

03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:53.420
Thank you, Pete. Thanks for all your work on this and your leadership. Greatly appreciated. And if you're in Greece, we're going to invite you back for the culmination of the program.

03:07:53.420 --> 03:08:04.420
Let me now take a few minutes to talk to you about this specific recommendation and this implementation grant cohort two.

03:08:04.420 --> 03:08:13.420
We released the RFA on January 24th with the allocation amount set at $750 million.

03:08:13.420 --> 03:08:26.420
We also changed the RFA process. In the first year, it was much more weighted around eligibility criteria. This year, we balanced.

03:08:26.420 --> 03:08:51.420
We asked our applicants to show artifacts, to write an implementation plan. So it was a 50-50 weighting between the qualitative pieces of the program that they are proposing and the evidence that they are ready to implement.

03:08:51.420 --> 03:09:12.420
Balanced with our continued focus on the equity priorities of this program. We received 142 complete applications and I want to remind everyone that even though in the implementation phase, funding is by school site, the application is still the LEA.

03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:25.420
So that may seem a small number, but it was 85 school districts, eight county offices of education, and 49 charter schools who applied.

03:09:25.420 --> 03:09:43.420
A reminder about our funding levels. We have gradations from 25 to 150, 151 to 400, 400 to 1,000, 1,000 to 2,000, and the very large 2,000 and over.

03:09:43.420 --> 03:10:11.420
And that just shows you, this is also in the item, it shows you a little bit about the investment over the five-year trajectory. So as you see, those of us who have spent the majority of our careers at schools, these funding investment levels really offer the opportunity for a transformational program over the trajectory of five years.

03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:25.420
So what we are recommending today, we are recommending 128 LEAs for funding for a total of 570 schools.

03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:44.420
I mean, I never would have imagined that we could have come this close, but we came very, very close. 750 million point five, 750 million 5,000 is our recommended investment.

03:10:44.420 --> 03:11:03.420
We used, as I said, the scoring was balanced between the qualitative portions of that, and I'll talk about that in just a moment. We also used our UPC numbers as we did in the first year.

03:11:03.420 --> 03:11:30.420
Per our precedent that we set in the first year, we also dipped a little bit lower to recognize the conditions are, I shouldn't say conditions, but that our small and rural schools face particular unique situations, and we dipped down a little bit lower to 58% to fund 15 additional small and rural schools.

03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:44.420
Based on feedback that we received from several of our advocacy partners, we also included four schools that have a very high non-stability rate.

03:11:44.420 --> 03:12:09.420
These are, this enables us to capture youth and schools that serve youth who have a very high school transiency rate and some specific subgroups there that advocates who are concerned do not always get captured in our UPC numbers.

03:12:09.420 --> 03:12:28.420
So there are four schools that qualify under having high non-stability rates. The LEAs that were not recommended for funding either did not meet the priority guidelines or the RFA guidelines, and I can speak to that more directly if there are questions.

03:12:28.420 --> 03:12:43.420
Here are the 128, the breakdown, 78 school districts, 48 unified, 24 elementary, six high school districts, seven county offices of education, and 43 charter schools.

03:12:43.420 --> 03:13:06.420
With the concurrence of the board today with this recommendation, we will still have remaining for implementation grants approximately $1.83 billion that will remain in terms of our, to award further implementation grants.

03:13:06.420 --> 03:13:22.420
Here's a breakdown of the regions, Bay Area 25, Capital Area 6, Central Coast, we still have low subscription though we did get more planning grants from the Central Coast this year.

03:13:22.420 --> 03:13:34.420
They came in at four, Central Valley 18, Greater Los Angeles 38, Northern California 12, Southern Coast 22, Southern Inland 3.

03:13:34.420 --> 03:13:48.420
What are our next steps? We will be holding a webinar for our cohort to implementation grantees to begin supporting their programs right away.

03:13:48.420 --> 03:14:00.420
We will be connecting both planning and implementation grantees to their, our tax through their, to their regional technical assistance centers.

03:14:00.420 --> 03:14:21.420
We are, we are going to, we're going to also include our county offices of education who have received coordination grant funding to assist in so we have coverage through all areas of the state where there are implementation grants.

03:14:21.420 --> 03:14:37.420
Important next step also is to release our formative evaluation RFP, which is a little bit different as you know from the RFA, and we hope to do that very, very soon.

03:14:37.420 --> 03:14:56.420
And really important is, and I was just talking about this with staff right before the meeting, we will be collecting our first annual reports from cohort one implementation grantees.

03:14:56.420 --> 03:15:10.420
The, the sequencing and timeline of this, you know, really had us accelerating our process for I think all the right equity reasons of getting this funding out.

03:15:10.420 --> 03:15:33.420
If you remember, a lot of the catalyst was to get this, this funding to our communities, especially communities particularly devastated by the disproportionate impacts of the pandemic and the ongoing impacts of disparities that were endemic before there was a pandemic.

03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:48.420
So we will be receiving our first annual reports and we look forward to bringing that analysis to to the board to share with you what we're learning at scale.

03:15:48.420 --> 03:16:08.420
We are also our, our, our stack our statewide transformative assistance lead Alameda County will be holding the first community schools summit on June 16 2023 in San Francisco.

03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:37.420
Very much looking forward to that. And we're also going to partner with divisions within CDE, but also with some of our external partners to to really ensure in the areas of early childhood, special education for English learners that we're ensuring inclusivity and making sure all of our metrics moving forward.

03:16:38.420 --> 03:17:03.420
Elevate that inclusivity and whether we need to make adjustments and our, our phase moving forward, or we also need to make sure that what we're capturing in this annual reporting is is assuring that community schools implementation means the whole of our community.

03:17:03.420 --> 03:17:26.420
All of our learners. Let me end by saying that these visits, several that I've been able to do with Superintendent Thurman, a few more that I've been able to do on my own, really speak to the vision that this board had the vision that our, our state leadership had.

03:17:27.420 --> 03:17:41.420
You see the change. You feel the change. Implementation does not happen. As we know, simply by the allocation of funds alone.

03:17:41.420 --> 03:17:57.420
We believe that we have set up the type of support network. We believe that the support of this of this board with our framework lays out a guide, a guiding path.

03:17:57.420 --> 03:18:04.420
But the implementation will happen at our schools in our communities.

03:18:05.420 --> 03:18:29.420
And today, 570 schools, 570 communities with guidance, with a vision, with an equity journey in front of them, but a path that they will create based on the, the assets and strengths that already exist in the, in the community.

03:18:29.420 --> 03:18:52.420
Not a state program coming in to fix what is broken, but an investment, an investment in the strengths that are already there to build those strengths, to grow those strengths, to support those strengths and to encourage communities to work together on behalf of our kids in a different way.

03:18:52.420 --> 03:19:04.420
It is 570 schools, 570 communities, but it's tens of thousands of lives. Tens of thousands of educational dreams that we believe that I can tell you from what I've seen.

03:19:04.420 --> 03:19:20.420
We're supporting today in a transformational way. And I just want to encourage us to, to support that transformation. Thank you for the opportunity to present. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

03:19:34.420 --> 03:19:55.420
Thank you very much. At this point, I think we want to also put up the phone line for public comment. Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may wish to do so in person or by calling the telephone number using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

03:19:55.420 --> 03:20:10.420
While we are waiting for members of the public to call in, I want to ask for our liaison member Yoshimoto Tauri if she has any initial comments before me and then I'll ask board members if you have any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

03:20:10.420 --> 03:20:19.420
Thank you. Just wanted to say congratulations to all of the applicants and folks that are receiving this grant.

03:20:20.420 --> 03:20:37.420
What it means is that they're moving from planning to implementation. And that for three reasons, right, the collaboration across various stakeholders. Number one, number two, there's leadership at the local, the regional and the state levels to support the transformation.

03:20:37.420 --> 03:20:53.420
And thirdly, the two year extension really acknowledges that strong foundations are important to long term sustainability. And so the fact that we're intentionally making a long term investment in this program is really important.

03:20:53.420 --> 03:21:13.420
And I have a few more comments, but I'll reserve those for later. Thank you. All right. Well, I will echo my fellow board members comments. The fact that this is really being planned in a way that has the possibility to take deep roots is, you know, very, very important and encouraging.

03:21:13.420 --> 03:21:28.420
It is exciting that we're poised to allocate three quarters of a billion dollars to community schools implementation across all of the regions of the state and that we're supporting them with a statewide technical assistance infrastructure.

03:21:28.420 --> 03:21:51.420
And it'll be important for us and the technical assistance providers and the department to keep focused on how the dollars leverage the services that students need, the programs that make them both successful academically and attached to and belonging in the schools that they attend, particularly our high need students.

03:21:51.420 --> 03:22:03.420
So we will keep our eye on the ball as the implementation goes forward. Are there any clarifying questions that people have before we move to public comment?

03:22:03.420 --> 03:22:24.420
Member Escobedo on on slide 12, you have the regions displayed by number. Do they reflect where the regional technical centers are located? I just wonder. I just want to be clear about that. Or is that yes, that is that is correct. Thank you.

03:22:25.420 --> 03:22:36.420
That is correct. And the there is court, there's a corresponding our attack to each of the regions that are listed. Thank you. Is there any other clarifying question?

03:22:37.420 --> 03:22:41.420
Seeing none, do we have any public comment in person?

03:22:43.420 --> 03:22:46.420
We have one person signed up, Tim Taylor.

03:22:54.420 --> 03:23:19.420
Yeah, there we go. Tim Taylor from the California Small School District Association. And thanks for all your service. Just two things. One, we appreciate the staff working hard to put more funds out to rural schools. They did a better job this time.

03:23:19.420 --> 03:23:34.420
My recommendation to the state board and to CDE is have a carve out like we do with CTIG money like we do with MTSS. So our frontier schools can compete with the larger schools. It's very difficult.

03:23:34.420 --> 03:24:01.420
Community schools is a great model. In 1986, I taught in Folsom Cordova and it was a community school based off of what they did in New York. And it's really effective for rural schools. They don't have a lot of CBOs. They don't have a lot of nonprofits out there. So please help fund them more. And my recommendation is let them compete against each other. And then it will be easier for staff to fund our schools. Thank you.

03:24:02.420 --> 03:24:11.420
Thank you very much. Any other in person? Seeing none, shall we move to telephone public comment?

03:24:12.420 --> 03:24:16.420
Yes, we have 11 callers in the queue. I will open the phone line now.

03:24:17.420 --> 03:24:27.420
We want to remind people to turn the speaker volume down on their computers if they're following the live feed so that there will not be echoing.

03:24:28.420 --> 03:24:35.420
Okay. Good afternoon. State Board of Education, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:24:40.420 --> 03:24:45.420
Caller, ending in the last four digits, 5116. You are now live. Please start your public comment.

03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:52.420
Sure. Good afternoon. My name is Connie Choi here on behalf of Public Advocates and the California Partnership.

03:24:53.420 --> 03:25:01.420
We understand that in order to provide adequate time to develop the aligned reporting documents for Cohort 1, CDE will not release them until June 2023.

03:25:02.420 --> 03:25:11.420
This pushed back the submission date for the annual progress reports to fall 2023 so that schools and LEAs could timely develop and publicly present those reports.

03:25:11.420 --> 03:25:28.420
We strongly urge CDE to set a new deadline to November 15, 2023 to ensure that shared decision-making teams can engage in inclusive processes with students, families, educators, and community partners to develop and present the reports upon returning to school in the fall. Thank you.

03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:35.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:25:35.420 --> 03:25:39.420
Hello.

03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:46.420
One moment. We do have an interpreter here.

03:25:47.420 --> 03:25:53.420
Hello. I am going to speak in English, in Spanish, and I'll be interpreting.

03:25:53.420 --> 03:25:57.420
Good afternoon. My name is Maria Ruiz, and I am a mother living in Los Angeles.

03:25:58.420 --> 03:26:02.420
I participate in the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools.

03:26:03.420 --> 03:26:09.420
I participate in the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools.

03:26:10.420 --> 03:26:16.420
I participate in the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools.

03:26:17.420 --> 03:26:27.420
I participate in the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools.

03:26:28.420 --> 03:26:34.420
I participate in Ines City Travels.

03:26:35.420 --> 03:26:37.420
The Partnership for Los Angeles Schools.

03:26:38.420 --> 03:26:41.420
And part of Los Angeles area in the school.

03:26:42.420 --> 03:26:44.420
The Partnership the Future of Learning.

03:26:44.420 --> 03:26:47.420
And Partnership of Future Learning.

03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:58.420
The students and the families and all the companionship in the community.

03:26:59.420 --> 03:27:10.420
They should have an executive voice and very respectful on what decision they will make.

03:27:10.420 --> 03:27:24.420
And all kinds of levels up until our district and all kinds of levels higher than the district.

03:27:25.420 --> 03:27:33.420
The Office of Education of the county and the state.

03:27:33.420 --> 03:27:46.420
The Associates of all the students, the families and everything on their surroundings.

03:27:47.420 --> 03:27:58.420
It should be a transform on the matter of how we are developing our schools.

03:27:58.420 --> 03:28:08.420
We are ready so you can count on us with this process.

03:28:09.420 --> 03:28:18.420
Mendel High School is a community school.

03:28:19.420 --> 03:28:31.420
And there should be another type of grade that will be entered in a different community.

03:28:32.420 --> 03:28:42.420
Thank you for the collaboration of the parents.

03:28:42.420 --> 03:28:46.420
Students and the members of the community.

03:28:50.420 --> 03:28:53.420
We demonstrate of the transformation.

03:28:56.420 --> 03:28:58.420
It can only occur.

03:29:04.420 --> 03:29:08.420
If we all participate in an authentic way of matter.

03:29:13.420 --> 03:29:19.420
Nothing above us or over us. Thank you very much.

03:29:20.420 --> 03:29:22.420
Thank you.

03:29:23.420 --> 03:29:28.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:29:32.420 --> 03:29:37.420
Hello, my name is Lorraine Richards and I am a classroom teacher representing California Teachers Association.

03:29:37.420 --> 03:29:47.420
CTA continues to be impressed and supportive of the work of the CTAAC and what they have accomplished in less than one year is tremendous.

03:29:48.420 --> 03:29:58.420
CTA is appreciative of the CDE's work to review the cohort to implementation grant application so quickly with the added requirements of artifacts.

03:29:59.420 --> 03:30:09.420
The number of LEAs being awarded is tremendous and we believe that this shows the investment in establishing and cultivating community schools throughout our state in the right one.

03:30:10.420 --> 03:30:22.420
CTA has encouraged our members to uplift shared decision making and democratic leadership as a foundational step to ensure that students, parents, community and educators all have seats at the table.

03:30:22.420 --> 03:30:29.420
Some locals have put MOUs in place. Some have negotiated shared decision making within collective bargaining agreements.

03:30:30.420 --> 03:30:38.420
Every community is different but the tenets of shared decision making ring true no matter where you are in the state. Thank you.

03:30:39.420 --> 03:30:44.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:30:53.420 --> 03:30:58.420
Caller, ending in the last four digits, 6027, you are now live. Please start your public comment.

03:30:59.420 --> 03:31:10.420
Good afternoon. Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea Rosales. I live in Los Angeles. I'm a student, alumni and educational justice parent organizer with energy struggle and I'm also with the California partnership.

03:31:11.420 --> 03:31:19.420
We appreciate that all of the equity indicators included in the implementation and grant priority criteria were balanced in the round two application scoring process.

03:31:19.420 --> 03:31:30.420
This shift will ensure that more eligible schools with demonstrated need, especially those serving students experiencing large equity gaps, are not excluded from this historic school transformation opportunity.

03:31:30.420 --> 03:31:49.420
Expanded access of community schools partnership program to schools serving high populations of black students, students with disabilities and other historically excluded students who are not part of the school serving 80% or more of the LCFS unduplicated people count is critical to creating racially just relationship centered community schools across our state.

03:31:50.420 --> 03:31:58.420
Transformation can only happen when students, families, communities, educators and district leaders are authentic partners. Nothing about us without us. Thank you.

03:31:59.420 --> 03:32:04.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:32:07.420 --> 03:32:18.420
Hello, Deanna Niebuhr with the Community Schools Learning Exchange. DSLX has been working directly with LEAs across the state. Our comments today are from this on the ground vantage point.

03:32:18.420 --> 03:32:40.420
DSLX is concerned about the methodology being used to award implementation grants. While we see the very good intentions behind the 80% unduplicated pupil rate priority set out in statute, we are concerned that attempts to abide by this priority may be having unintended consequences that affect the accessibility of the grant program and its technical assistance offerings.

03:32:41.420 --> 03:33:01.420
Specifically, is the 80% priority looming large and causing LEAs that are technically eligible for the program to be essentially ineligible for an implementation grant? Please consider both our rural and small LEAs as well as our LEAs in suburban communities that are now serving families who have been priced out of the urban core.

03:33:02.420 --> 03:33:20.420
And in both cases, find themselves in situations where the transportation and health and human services infrastructure is often very sparse. Thank you for your consideration. DSLX is here to help make the community schools initiative a viable statewide program.

03:33:21.420 --> 03:33:26.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:33:26.420 --> 03:33:43.420
Good afternoon, President Darlene Hammond, State Board members, staff, and communities. My name is Katie Nunez-Adler, and I'm the statewide coordinator for the California Partnership for the Peace of Learning, an alliance of community organizing and advocacy groups that center black, indigenous, brown, and immigrant students, families, and communities of color across the state to advance a shared vision for schools.

03:33:43.420 --> 03:33:58.420
We appreciate how staff at the Department, Board, and State Transformational Assistance Center have listened to and integrated our feedback rooted in the engagement of directly impacted students, families, community partners, and educators to inform the development of the community schools partnership program.

03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:18.420
We believe that authentic relationships rooted in mutual understanding, trust, and shared power and decision making provide the necessary foundation for improving the social emotional well-being and academic outcomes for students. Thank you.

03:34:18.420 --> 03:34:33.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:34:33.420 --> 03:34:39.420
Yeah, that's what you're going to hear.

03:34:39.420 --> 03:34:48.420
Caller with the last four digits, seven, five, oh, they just hung up.

03:34:48.420 --> 03:34:58.420
Caller with the last four digits, four, nine, two, five, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:34:58.420 --> 03:34:59.420
Hello?

03:34:59.420 --> 03:35:03.420
Hello, you are live. Please start your public comment.

03:35:03.420 --> 03:35:25.420
Yeah, good afternoon. My name is Juan Tecum. I'm calling to support Time Community School, and I'm calling the Department of Education to support this school. We believe that it is very important for this school to remain open, because we believe school with small group students in the classroom to receive the necessary help from the teacher.

03:35:25.420 --> 03:35:42.420
I apologize, sir. I think you're you're calling in for Time Charter School. That is the next item up. If you don't mind calling back in after this item is completed. Thank you.

03:35:42.420 --> 03:35:50.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:58.420
Caller with the last four digits, five, one, seven, zero. You are now live. Please start your public comment.

03:35:58.420 --> 03:36:01.420
I'm sorry. I have to call back. I am calling for Time Charter School.

03:36:01.420 --> 03:36:06.420
Okay, thank you.

03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:12.420
Caller with the last four digits, eight, six, three, zero. You are now live. Please start your public comment.

03:36:12.420 --> 03:36:22.420
Good afternoon. My name is Lucero Soto, and I am a community organizer with Sacramento Act, PICO-Ed for Live, and a member of the California Partnership for the Future of Learning.

03:36:22.420 --> 03:36:36.420
There is a need for increased capacity to support the rollout and implementation of the work that the State Transformational Assistance Center and the Regional Technical Assistance Centers leading and supporting planning and implementation grantees.

03:36:36.420 --> 03:36:43.420
In particular, LEAs need to have a shared understanding of community schools as a transformative approach to schooling.

03:36:43.420 --> 03:36:51.420
This means desiloing the work and engaging LEA-level leaders across departments around the community schools approach.

03:36:51.420 --> 03:37:02.420
It also means providing intentional development to support school site-level leaders and shared decision-making teams, inclusive of students, families, educators, and community partners,

03:37:02.420 --> 03:37:09.420
to understand and support implementation of this opportunity for transformational at the school site level.

03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:15.420
Engaging community organizations as key partners is critical to leveraging this historic opportunity.

03:37:15.420 --> 03:37:24.420
Transformation can only happen when students, families, communities, and educators, district leaders, are authentic partners. Nothing about us without us. Thank you.

03:37:24.420 --> 03:37:27.420
Thank you.

03:37:27.420 --> 03:37:34.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

03:37:34.420 --> 03:37:41.420
Good afternoon. Liz Guillen with Public Advocates on behalf of the LCFF Equity Coalition.

03:37:41.420 --> 03:37:44.420
We support this item, are very excited about it.

03:37:44.420 --> 03:37:54.420
We urge the board and the department to continue sending a clear message to county offices, districts, and schools to receive implementation grants that the work isn't over.

03:37:54.420 --> 03:38:01.420
They're still required to publicly present their plans to their school communities and at the district level starting this fall.

03:38:01.420 --> 03:38:16.420
Additionally, we would like to stress the really good language in the round two implementation grant RFA that clearly states that the annual progress reports need to be developed and presented with shared decision-making.

03:38:16.420 --> 03:38:29.420
And shared decision-making teams need to be convened now so that the teams have the opportunity to build relationships, conduct needs and assets mapping, reflect on learnings, measure progress, and present plans.

03:38:29.420 --> 03:38:39.420
A lot of work still needs to be done, and it's tough work, work that we value, but we know takes a lot of energy and commitment.

03:38:39.420 --> 03:38:43.420
Thank you so much for leading the way on community schools.

03:38:43.420 --> 03:38:46.420
Thank you.

03:38:46.420 --> 03:38:55.420
Next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now.

03:38:55.420 --> 03:39:11.420
Caller with the last four digits 5137 you are now live please start your public comment.

03:39:11.420 --> 03:39:21.420
Next caller with the last four digits 7802 please start your public comment now.

03:39:21.420 --> 03:39:29.420
Okay, it looks like those callers are probably for the next item and that concludes public comment for item number nine.

03:39:29.420 --> 03:39:38.420
Thank you very much to all of the callers and all the commenters and all the people doing the work on this agenda in the field.

03:39:38.420 --> 03:39:41.420
I think we're open now for board discussion.

03:39:41.420 --> 03:39:44.420
Are there any further comments or questions?

03:39:44.420 --> 03:39:46.420
Yes, member Roscoe Gonzalez.

03:39:46.420 --> 03:39:49.420
I just have a comment.

03:39:49.420 --> 03:39:57.420
One of the callers used the words as socios autenticos, which means authentic partners, I believe is referring to shared governance.

03:39:57.420 --> 03:40:12.420
The required artifacts as outlined in the RFA will help to ensure the adherence to the California Community Schools framework and help to ensure LEAs are authentically engaging in shared decision making, which is the cornerstone of these efforts.

03:40:12.420 --> 03:40:18.420
Every community is different, but the tenants of shared decision making ring true no matter where you are in the state.

03:40:18.420 --> 03:40:28.420
There are wonderful examples of LEAs ensuring that students, parents, community and educators all have seats at the table as part of the decision making process.

03:40:28.420 --> 03:40:33.420
These efforts are different in many school districts based on their local context.

03:40:33.420 --> 03:40:36.420
Some have put memorandums of understanding in place.

03:40:36.420 --> 03:40:43.420
Some have negotiated shared decision making within their collective bargaining agreements as a commitment to shared governance.

03:40:43.420 --> 03:40:49.420
This is an example of democratic leadership as a key foundational step in achieving these transformational community schools.

03:40:49.420 --> 03:40:56.420
And it makes this process and I think this new way of having schools in California so exciting.

03:40:56.420 --> 03:41:06.420
It's happened in my school district and it's what gets teachers, educators, community and students excited about having a community school in their school district.

03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:15.420
Any other comments or questions? Yes, member Glover-Woods and then member Escobedo.

03:41:15.420 --> 03:41:22.420
First, just a couple of comments and then a question.

03:41:22.420 --> 03:41:32.420
Thank you again so much for the awesome work that's being done bringing this program to fruition.

03:41:32.420 --> 03:41:40.420
It's exciting to hear that there are now schools and LEAs that are in the implementation phase and that area is being looked at.

03:41:40.420 --> 03:41:47.420
And also thank you for giving an update on the community schools office and the support.

03:41:47.420 --> 03:42:01.420
I do really believe with the amount of money that is being invested in this, what's going to be very, very critical as has already been stated is the support that's given to LEAs and schools and communities.

03:42:02.420 --> 03:42:12.420
As it relates to that and Mr. Zimmer, I have to say I applaud a statement you made towards the end about while we're looking at hundreds of schools,

03:42:12.420 --> 03:42:16.420
we're looking at tens of thousands of lives that are impacted by this.

03:42:16.420 --> 03:42:21.420
And I'm just quite excited about the possibilities.

03:42:21.420 --> 03:42:31.420
I had a question as it relates to the annual reports that are going to come forward for the implementation, those that are in the implementation phase.

03:42:31.420 --> 03:42:45.420
My question is, to what degree and how will the annual reports align with existing reports that LEAs or schools may already be engaged in?

03:42:45.420 --> 03:42:54.420
For example, their LCAP or if they are in a differentiated assistance process or CSI or ATSI.

03:42:54.420 --> 03:43:11.420
How does this report for these schools align to existing reports and plans that they may also be working on?

03:43:11.420 --> 03:43:18.420
Thank you for your comments now that I turned the microphone on.

03:43:18.420 --> 03:43:20.420
It's an important question.

03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:25.420
We don't want our reporting to be overly burdensome.

03:43:25.420 --> 03:43:35.420
And where there is alignment with existing DA reporting, LCAP reporting,

03:43:35.420 --> 03:43:52.420
we don't want to create needless duplication of having to basically say the same thing in a different way that would be time consuming and not useful.

03:43:52.420 --> 03:44:03.420
However, there are some pieces in our reporting that probably will be a little bit different.

03:44:03.420 --> 03:44:15.420
And this relates also to the formative assessment, the formative evaluation that RFP will be releasing.

03:44:15.420 --> 03:44:31.420
First, we want to make sure that we are able to track the type of partnerships and engagements that are happening.

03:44:31.420 --> 03:44:35.420
You heard reference the artifacts in the RFA.

03:44:35.420 --> 03:44:43.420
In our reporting process, we're looking for a more comprehensive reporting.

03:44:43.420 --> 03:44:56.420
There will also be elements that are aligned to the framework, making sure that there are shared decision making councils in place,

03:44:56.420 --> 03:45:06.420
making sure that there has been the asset mapping and needs assessment and gap analysis.

03:45:06.420 --> 03:45:12.420
And let me tell you specifically what we're looking for here.

03:45:12.420 --> 03:45:21.420
The addition of services in areas of need is always a good thing.

03:45:21.420 --> 03:45:38.420
The process here is very intentional, and that is to make sure that our school sites are completing the asset mapping and needs analysis

03:45:38.420 --> 03:45:50.420
and that the services are based off of the direct feedback from the community, from students, from families.

03:45:50.420 --> 03:45:54.420
Our reporting needs to capture that.

03:45:54.420 --> 03:46:05.420
And where there are some gaps or where that's not clear, that's where the technical – there's some precision that we're looking for here.

03:46:05.420 --> 03:46:16.420
And so I don't mean to get too into the weeds in responses, but only to say, yes, we want to – wherever there's alignment with existing reporting,

03:46:16.420 --> 03:46:26.420
we don't want to create duplication or burden, but there are specific areas that we are looking to track based on the framework

03:46:26.420 --> 03:46:35.420
so that we can make sure in a program at this scale we are directing that technical assistance in as precise a way as we possibly can.

03:46:35.420 --> 03:46:45.420
So that's the relationship that we're looking for between the reporting and the TA engagement.

03:46:45.420 --> 03:46:49.420
And there are some things that wouldn't be captured in the existing reporting.

03:46:49.420 --> 03:46:51.420
So I hope that helps.

03:46:51.420 --> 03:46:54.420
Go ahead.

03:46:54.420 --> 03:46:57.420
Thank you. Thank you for that response.

03:46:57.420 --> 03:47:00.420
And I definitely appreciate what is being said.

03:47:00.420 --> 03:47:09.420
And I want to say that my question, while always – I always have my eye on the ball of multiple plans and overduplication,

03:47:09.420 --> 03:47:15.420
definitely not something that's very helpful for the field, the other piece of it as well is, as you said,

03:47:15.420 --> 03:47:20.420
how are we looking at some of those very specific aspects to this particular program?

03:47:20.420 --> 03:47:26.420
And just a comment in closing that I'd like to say, especially to those who are in the field,

03:47:26.420 --> 03:47:35.420
it's about looking at all of the things that are happening for schools, not as discrete pieces, but as a whole.

03:47:35.420 --> 03:47:42.420
I think about the analogy we were using decades ago about the shopping cart and all the wheels rolling in the same direction.

03:47:42.420 --> 03:47:46.420
Something similar to that applies to this as well.

03:47:46.420 --> 03:47:54.420
So as LEAs are looking at completing the reporting for this particular program,

03:47:54.420 --> 03:48:04.420
I just encourage a holistic review of all of the plans and all of the things that are being done at a district and at a school level

03:48:04.420 --> 03:48:13.420
to be sure that everything is working hand in hand and that we don't have bits and pieces working in isolation.

03:48:13.420 --> 03:48:21.420
Because we know this program has a huge impact on so many of the accountability indicators that we look at.

03:48:21.420 --> 03:48:29.420
And again, we must look at the reporting and analysis of the impact of the program as well as other things.

03:48:29.420 --> 03:48:37.420
Again, I keep using the word holistic. I think I'm absent a different word right now, but as a whole.

03:48:37.420 --> 03:48:42.420
The word that comes to mind is cohesion.

03:48:42.420 --> 03:48:48.420
Thank you. Thank you very much for helping me with that. Yes. Thank you very much.

03:48:48.420 --> 03:48:50.420
Thank you.

03:48:50.420 --> 03:48:55.420
Member Escobedo and then Member Olken and then Member Yoshimoto-Towrie.

03:48:55.420 --> 03:49:03.420
I was looking at the regions and they range from 3 to 38, which is a significant range.

03:49:03.420 --> 03:49:07.420
My question is the support aspect.

03:49:08.420 --> 03:49:22.420
Do we have the capacity from each regional center to support 38, 25 or 22 areas within their region?

03:49:22.420 --> 03:49:28.420
I want to say that we have our eye on that.

03:49:28.420 --> 03:49:32.420
I can't give you a definitive answer because I don't know yet.

03:49:33.420 --> 03:49:41.420
It's important and when I see that variance, I have the same concern.

03:49:41.420 --> 03:49:49.420
I will say in areas of low subscription in the implementation grants this year,

03:49:49.420 --> 03:49:53.420
we do have higher subscription in the planning grants.

03:49:53.420 --> 03:49:58.420
Not as high as I would like, but certainly higher than the first year.

03:49:58.420 --> 03:50:05.420
For example, on the Central Coast where I was able to visit last week in Oxnard,

03:50:05.420 --> 03:50:13.420
we had a great meeting with a number of districts, particularly the high school district,

03:50:13.420 --> 03:50:18.420
got to visit a number of schools in the planning grant phase,

03:50:18.420 --> 03:50:22.420
and they're looking at the whole of the Oxnard Plains

03:50:22.420 --> 03:50:30.420
and how to integrate their many feeder elementary districts into the program.

03:50:30.420 --> 03:50:38.420
The TA work there would be significantly different than the TA work,

03:50:38.420 --> 03:50:48.420
let's say, in LA Bay Area or the Southern Coast where you have larger scale implementation.

03:50:48.420 --> 03:50:52.420
So to borrow a phrase that we use a lot,

03:50:52.420 --> 03:50:57.420
the TA itself is going to have to have a lot of differentiation.

03:50:57.420 --> 03:51:02.420
So I saw, Dr. Acevedo, the same things that you've seen.

03:51:02.420 --> 03:51:08.420
It is very much on the radar screen and has the attention of the STAC.

03:51:08.420 --> 03:51:18.420
And if we are seeing areas that are overwhelmed by volume and underwhelmed by volume,

03:51:18.420 --> 03:51:22.420
we're going to need to make course corrections as we move forward.

03:51:22.420 --> 03:51:25.420
That's the best answer I could have right now.

03:51:25.420 --> 03:51:26.420
Thank you.

03:51:26.420 --> 03:51:28.420
Member Olken?

03:51:28.420 --> 03:51:29.420
Thank you.

03:51:29.420 --> 03:51:32.420
Thanks for this great news that you're sharing with us today.

03:51:32.420 --> 03:51:35.420
I like that that's how you started this presentation.

03:51:35.420 --> 03:51:36.420
This is good news.

03:51:36.420 --> 03:51:44.420
And I just wanted to make the quick comment that as I've been talking with education leaders

03:51:44.420 --> 03:51:49.420
and educators, particularly in San Francisco, but wherever I go,

03:51:49.420 --> 03:51:55.420
and I ask, you know, what are the things that are going on at the state or at the state board

03:51:55.420 --> 03:52:01.420
that feel really important and that can really move the needle for our schools and families?

03:52:02.420 --> 03:52:06.420
Community schools is always one of the top things that comes up.

03:52:06.420 --> 03:52:11.420
And then the other thing is not really a program, but it's an approach,

03:52:11.420 --> 03:52:18.420
which is to make sure that we are providing enough time and consistent resources

03:52:18.420 --> 03:52:21.420
and support for things to take hold.

03:52:21.420 --> 03:52:28.420
So the idea that these are multi-year grants is something that feels to the folks

03:52:28.420 --> 03:52:35.420
that I've spoken with like a real investment in the sustainability of change

03:52:35.420 --> 03:52:38.420
rather than sort of a scattershot approach.

03:52:38.420 --> 03:52:41.420
And so I appreciate that that's how we're setting this up.

03:52:41.420 --> 03:52:46.420
And I just wanted to raise that up with gratitude.

03:52:49.420 --> 03:52:52.420
Member Yoshimoto-Tari?

03:52:52.420 --> 03:52:53.420
Thank you.

03:52:53.420 --> 03:52:54.420
Thank you.

03:52:54.420 --> 03:52:59.420
And I know you know my gratitude, Deputy Superintendent.

03:52:59.420 --> 03:53:02.420
I also want to call attention to slide 14.

03:53:02.420 --> 03:53:09.420
It's the very last bullet in the deck before we get to the recommendation,

03:53:09.420 --> 03:53:16.420
which calls attention to prioritizing early childhood.

03:53:16.420 --> 03:53:18.420
I personally would put a comma there.

03:53:18.420 --> 03:53:25.420
Special education, so students with disabilities and English learner discussions,

03:53:25.420 --> 03:53:28.420
because this is really a unique opportunity, as sort of mentioned before,

03:53:28.420 --> 03:53:32.420
to braid and blend other funding sources and initiatives.

03:53:32.420 --> 03:53:36.420
So educator effectiveness, expansion of universal transitional kindergarten,

03:53:36.420 --> 03:53:40.420
as we think about expanding learning opportunities, program dollars.

03:53:40.420 --> 03:53:47.420
The community school effort become the coherence maker of all of those different initiatives

03:53:47.420 --> 03:53:50.420
that are so important in our state right now.

03:53:50.420 --> 03:53:56.420
And in doing so, really highlighting the opportunity for inclusivity,

03:53:56.420 --> 03:54:00.420
what that looks like programmatically,

03:54:00.420 --> 03:54:04.420
where there are models in our state for inclusive practices.

03:54:04.420 --> 03:54:08.420
And whether that's reflecting it in the next RFA, as you mentioned,

03:54:08.420 --> 03:54:13.420
Deputy Superintendent, or metrics for formative and summative assessment,

03:54:13.420 --> 03:54:16.420
or setting aside time for people to have that collaboration,

03:54:16.420 --> 03:54:18.420
it really is a unique opportunity.

03:54:18.420 --> 03:54:24.420
And just to highlight that, this will connect a little bit with my liaison report,

03:54:24.420 --> 03:54:30.420
but the Advisory Commission for Special Education,

03:54:30.420 --> 03:54:36.420
whose role is to really partially advise us as a board on matters,

03:54:36.420 --> 03:54:40.420
invited you to come speak in February on the community school program,

03:54:40.420 --> 03:54:45.420
and had Superintendent Thurman speaking in April to them.

03:54:45.420 --> 03:54:50.420
And at the end of the April meeting, they passed a motion to ask you to come back again,

03:54:50.420 --> 03:54:55.420
because they feel very strongly that this is a huge opportunity for that inclusiveness,

03:54:55.420 --> 03:54:58.420
and just to create that sense of belonging,

03:54:58.420 --> 03:55:04.420
and really take the opportunity at hand in front of us.

03:55:04.420 --> 03:55:10.420
So thank you again, and we're excited to see how this is going to move forward.

03:55:10.420 --> 03:55:16.420
This may be the first time in my career that I've been subject to a motion that's positive,

03:55:16.420 --> 03:55:21.420
so that's very good. I look forward to it.

03:55:21.420 --> 03:55:23.420
You're popular.

03:55:23.420 --> 03:55:34.420
The dialogue with the Commission was truly important, and I look forward to it continuing.

03:55:34.420 --> 03:55:41.420
And since you used the word motion, I'd like to see if we've got a motion.

03:55:41.420 --> 03:55:44.420
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

03:55:44.420 --> 03:55:47.420
You've got a surge in cohesion.

03:55:47.420 --> 03:55:49.420
Those were holistic approaches.

03:55:49.420 --> 03:55:58.420
Yes, I make a motion to holistically approve the California Community Schools Partnership Program Cohort 2 Implementation Grant Awards.

03:55:58.420 --> 03:56:01.420
I think we have a second from Member Orozco-Gonzalez.

03:56:01.420 --> 03:56:03.420
And is there any other discussion?

03:56:03.420 --> 03:56:05.420
All in favor say aye.

03:56:05.420 --> 03:56:07.420
Any opposed?

03:56:07.420 --> 03:56:09.420
Any abstentions?

03:56:09.420 --> 03:56:10.420
Motion passes.

03:56:10.420 --> 03:56:11.420
Thank you very much.

03:56:11.420 --> 03:56:12.420
We appreciate it.

03:56:12.420 --> 03:56:21.420
It's nice to have such a positive conversation about such an optimistic agenda.

03:56:21.420 --> 03:56:23.420
I'm going to move us right along.

03:56:23.420 --> 03:56:33.420
I realized that after I gave us an hour for lunch, I wasn't supposed to give us quite so long.

03:56:33.420 --> 03:56:40.420
I had inconsistent instructions in my script.

03:56:40.420 --> 03:56:43.420
So we are going to move right along to item 10.

03:56:43.420 --> 03:56:48.420
Item 10 is the time community.

03:56:48.420 --> 03:57:01.420
We're going to consider evidence regarding a notion of violation issued by the California State Board of Education pursuant to California Education Code 47607G.

03:57:01.420 --> 03:57:10.420
And we're going to consider issuing a notice of intent to revoke with notice of facts pursuant to California Education Code Section 47607H.

03:57:10.420 --> 03:57:25.420
And this item is going to be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE and members of the Los Angeles County Office of Education Charter School oversight staff.

03:57:25.420 --> 03:57:29.420
And then there will be an opportunity for members of the school to also present.

03:57:29.420 --> 03:57:33.420
So Stephanie, please begin.

03:57:33.420 --> 03:57:34.420
Thank you.

03:57:34.420 --> 03:57:42.420
So good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, board members, Deputy Superintendent Guyen.

03:57:42.420 --> 03:58:03.420
So as Board President Darling-Hammond mentioned, this is about a revocation and considering evidence regarding the notice of violation that you issued to time in March pursuant to Ed Code Section 47607G.

03:58:03.420 --> 03:58:11.420
We are asking today to issue a notice of intent to revoke intent to revoke with a notice of facts to time.

03:58:11.420 --> 03:58:12.420
A little background.

03:58:12.420 --> 03:58:17.420
Time appealed the establishment of its charter to the state board on March 6, 2020.

03:58:17.420 --> 03:58:23.420
Time has was previously denied by Montebello Unified School District and the L.A. County Board of Education.

03:58:23.420 --> 03:58:32.420
The time of approval time had projected to serve 260 students in grades 9 and 10 in year one and 600 students by year five.

03:58:32.420 --> 03:58:36.420
They are located in Montebello.

03:58:36.420 --> 03:58:41.420
The California Department of Ed recommended that the S.B. deny the petition to establish time based on the following findings.

03:58:41.420 --> 03:58:44.420
Petitioner is unlikely to successfully implement the program.

03:58:44.420 --> 03:58:48.420
Petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the required elements.

03:58:48.420 --> 03:58:59.420
On July 9, 2020, the state board approved the establishment of the time charter for a five year term effective July 1, 2020, with a delay in opening and starting instruction in 21, 22.

03:58:59.420 --> 03:59:17.420
By mutual agreement, the S.B.E. designated its supervisory, boy, it's my last day, supervisorial and oversight responsibilities of the school to the Los Angeles County Office of Ed pursuant to former Ed Code Section 47605K1.

03:59:17.420 --> 03:59:24.420
That Ed Code Section went away when 1505 was established into law.

03:59:24.420 --> 03:59:36.420
In 2022, Laco and the C.D.E. identified concerns with time's fiscal management throughout the course of its oversight and on several occasions, Laco has offered assistance to time and remedying the school's deteriorating financial state.

03:59:36.420 --> 03:59:43.420
Time has not successfully implemented the sound financial practices that Laco has advised, resulting in the dire financial state of the school.

03:59:43.420 --> 03:59:49.420
On July 14, 2022, the C.D.E. recommended that the S.B.E. issue a notice of violation.

03:59:49.420 --> 03:59:52.420
The S.B.E. moved to approve the C.D.E. recommendation.

03:59:52.420 --> 03:59:54.420
The motion failed by a vote of five to four.

03:59:54.420 --> 03:59:59.420
Six votes are required to carry a motion, so no action was taken that day by the state board.

03:59:59.420 --> 04:00:07.420
Throughout 2022-23, Laco and the C.D.E. continued to have ongoing concerns with time's fiscal management.

04:00:07.420 --> 04:00:23.420
On March 9, 2023, in alignment with the C.D.E.'s recommendation, the S.B.E. issued a NOV to time, finding substantial evidence that demonstrated that the school failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles and engaged in fiscal mismanagement, citing the following specific violations.

04:00:23.420 --> 04:00:32.420
Unrealistic enrollment and ADA projections, significant differences in financial projections and actual results, low cash flow projections.

04:00:32.420 --> 04:00:40.420
On March 24, 2023, time provided its response to the NOV and a fiscal stability plan to the C.D.E. and to Laco.

04:00:40.420 --> 04:00:49.420
The C.D.E. is recommending today that the S.B.E. issue a notice of intent to revoke with notice of fax to time pursuant to 47607H.

04:00:49.420 --> 04:00:58.420
The C.D.E. provides substantial evidence that time has failed to meet generally accepting accounting principles and engaged in fiscal mismanagement,

04:00:58.420 --> 04:01:04.420
and that they have failed to adequately refute revenue or propose to remedy the violations outlined in the NOV.

04:01:04.420 --> 04:01:18.420
At its April 18, 2023 meeting, the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools concurred with the C.D.E.'s recommendation and unanimously voted to recommend that the S.B.E. issue a notice of intent to revoke and notice of fax to time.

04:01:18.420 --> 04:01:25.420
To go over the charter revocation information, I'm going to bring up Rick Reyes, who you might be seeing more of.

04:01:25.420 --> 04:01:33.420
He is an education program consultant, and he works on these issues along with our appeals in our charter school division office.

04:01:35.420 --> 04:01:38.420
All right, so a quick review of charter revocation.

04:01:38.420 --> 04:01:53.420
California Education Code, Section 47607F states that a charter may be revoked by the chartering authority if the authority finds, through a showing of substantial evidence, that the charter school did any of the following.

04:01:53.420 --> 04:01:59.420
Committed a material violation of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.

04:01:59.420 --> 04:02:03.420
Failed to meet or pursue any of the pupil outcomes identified in the charter.

04:02:03.420 --> 04:02:10.420
Failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles or engaged in fiscal mismanagement, or violated any law.

04:02:10.420 --> 04:02:25.420
Pursuant to Education Code, Section 47607G, before revocation, a chartering authority shall notify the charter school of any violation and give the school a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violation.

04:02:25.420 --> 04:02:34.420
On March 9th, 2023, the S.B.E. issued a notice of violation to time and provided the school a reasonable opportunity to remedy the violations.

04:02:35.420 --> 04:02:41.420
And time has failed to adequately refute remedy or propose to remedy the violations described in the notice of violation.

04:02:44.420 --> 04:02:58.420
Pursuant to Education Code, Section 47607H, before revoking a charter for failure to remedy a violation, the chartering authority shall provide a written notice of intent to revoke and notice of facts in support of revocation to the charter school.

04:02:59.420 --> 04:03:10.420
Here at today's meeting, the S.B.E. will consider the evidence regarding the notice of violation and decide whether to issue a notice of intent to revoke and notice of facts in support of the revocation of the time charter.

04:03:14.420 --> 04:03:27.420
Again, pursuant to Education Code, Section 47607H, no later than 30 days after providing the notice of intent to revoke, the chartering authority shall hold a public hearing regarding whether evidence exists to revoke the charter.

04:03:27.420 --> 04:03:33.420
No later than 30 days after the public hearing, the chartering authority shall issue a final decision to revoke or decline to revoke the charter.

04:03:34.420 --> 04:03:41.420
And the chartering authority shall not revoke a charter unless it makes written factual findings supported by substantial evidence that supports its findings.

04:03:42.420 --> 04:03:56.420
If the S.B.E. issues a notice of intent to revoke at today's meeting, at tomorrow's meeting, the S.B.E. will hold a public hearing to consider the revocation of time's charter and issue a final decision to revoke or decline to revoke the charter.

04:03:58.420 --> 04:04:03.420
And with that, I'll turn the presentation over to Indra Ciccarelli and Dale Brown from LACO.

04:04:10.420 --> 04:04:19.420
Thank you so much. Good afternoon, board members. I appreciate your time today as we have this very difficult conversation.

04:04:19.420 --> 04:04:31.420
The following fiscal concerns were listed in the LACO January 26, 2022 Notice of Concern.

04:04:31.420 --> 04:04:49.420
Time failed to demonstrate financial viability for the 21-22 school year and subsequent fiscal years due to its enrollment shortfall, deficit spending, potential cash deficiencies, reliance on debts, and a negative ending net position for the 21-22 fiscal year.

04:04:49.420 --> 04:05:03.420
LACO sent time a second Notice of Concern on June 28, 2022, based on continued unrealistic enrollment and average daily attendance projections, which grossly impacted revenue and the school's operations.

04:05:04.420 --> 04:05:14.420
Additional concerns were documented in the notice, including the school's projected fiscal insolvency, debt accumulation, and unreliable cash projections.

04:05:14.420 --> 04:05:24.420
The current concerns regarding time community school are listed on the slide in front of you and will be detailed in the slides to follow.

04:05:25.420 --> 04:05:41.420
Of note is the fact that the school's adopted budget for the current school year again included unrealistic enrollment and ADA projections in spite of guidance from LACO to plan more conservatively based on the enrollment and attendance shortfalls from the previous school year.

04:05:41.420 --> 04:05:51.420
This pattern of planning will continue to perpetuate a structural deficit and fiscal insolvency despite any significant one-time funds secured by the school.

04:05:52.420 --> 04:06:00.420
I will now turn the presentation over to my colleague, Dr. Dowell Brown, to discuss time's response to the Notice of Violation.

04:06:05.420 --> 04:06:08.420
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and esteemed board members.

04:06:08.420 --> 04:06:13.420
The following slides will detail the analysis of time's response to the Notice of Violation.

04:06:17.420 --> 04:06:26.420
As stated in the Notice of Violation issued by the SBE, time has continually developed budgets based on unrealistic enrollment and ADA projections.

04:06:27.420 --> 04:06:31.420
Time's responses to the Notice of Violation are noted on the slide in front of you.

04:06:38.420 --> 04:06:50.420
In reviewing time's response, both LACO and the CDE found that time continues its pattern of aspirational budget development despite repeated failures to meet projected enrollment targets.

04:06:51.420 --> 04:07:04.420
Time's response stated it will be completely or almost completely out of debt by the end of 2023-24, yet time's fiscal stability plan states it will reduce its debt by only half by that time.

04:07:04.420 --> 04:07:08.420
Time's response lacked a detailed plan to support either assertion.

04:07:09.420 --> 04:07:14.420
It should be noted that time has made similar assertions in the past that have not been realized.

04:07:15.420 --> 04:07:21.420
The school believes that many of its fiscal concerns stem from their inability to gain certain revenues.

04:07:22.420 --> 04:07:32.420
To be clear, time did not get the PCSPG grant because it failed to meet minimum enrollment requirements and in fact still have never met those requirements.

04:07:33.420 --> 04:07:39.420
They subsequently wanted to appeal that decision and ask for a letter of good standing in order to make that appeal.

04:07:40.420 --> 04:07:52.420
Despite an outstanding notice of concern, LACO and Good Faith asked the state for an extension on time's behalf in order to give the school time to provide documentation addressing staff concerns.

04:07:53.420 --> 04:07:58.420
Time failed to meet that timeline, declining to provide any documentation whatsoever.

04:07:59.420 --> 04:08:04.420
In terms of the state's revolving loan program, time did in fact access $100,000.

04:08:05.420 --> 04:08:10.420
As reported by the school, they have also sold over $400,000 in receivables.

04:08:11.420 --> 04:08:15.420
The school is not in its current situation because of a lack of revenue.

04:08:16.420 --> 04:08:19.420
It is there because of a failure to manage money properly.

04:08:19.420 --> 04:08:27.420
Again, both LACO and CDE found that time's budgets and multi-year projections are based on unrealistic enrollment in ADA projections.

04:08:28.420 --> 04:08:45.420
In addition, time is fiscally insolvent for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years due to unrealistic projections, structural deficits, inadequate cash, and continued accumulation of debt.

04:08:49.420 --> 04:08:57.420
The table before you illustrates time's unrealistic enrollment and ADA projections for the last fiscal year and current fiscal year.

04:08:58.420 --> 04:09:16.420
In 2021-22, time projected an ADA of approximately 156 students, but its certified P2 showed an ADA of approximately 34 students, a shortfall of 122 students or 78% below the projected ADA.

04:09:16.420 --> 04:09:33.420
In 2022-23, time projected an ADA of approximately 104 students, but its reported P1 ADA showed approximately 55 students, a shortfall of 49 students or 47% below the projected ADA.

04:09:34.420 --> 04:09:52.420
It should be noted that in correspondence to the State Board on July 8, 2022, time stated that enrollment for 2022-23 included 70 fully registered students with an additional 15 registrations in progress for a total of 85 students.

04:09:53.420 --> 04:09:58.420
However, time began the 2022-23 school year with 63 students.

04:09:58.420 --> 04:10:14.420
In addition, time's initial fiscal stabilization plan projected an enrollment increase of 30 students for next year and an increase of 68 students in 2024-25, a year in which the school will no longer be adding grade levels.

04:10:15.420 --> 04:10:28.420
In addition, the school is projecting a 90% monthly attendance rate. However, time's monthly attendance rate has only met or exceeded 90% in 6 out of 19 months of the school's existence.

04:10:29.420 --> 04:10:40.420
The slide before you displays concerns stated within the Notice of Violation and time's response to those concerns.

04:10:40.420 --> 04:10:52.420
Time fails to address concerns that its financial projections continually differ from actual results and provides only aspirational assurances of financial viability.

04:10:52.420 --> 04:11:02.420
The table before you summarizes time's financial projections for the last fiscal year and current fiscal year.

04:11:03.420 --> 04:11:16.420
Time's 2021-22 adopted budget projected an operating surplus of approximately $376,000 and an ending net position of approximately $468,000.

04:11:16.420 --> 04:11:30.420
However, the school ended the fiscal year with a deficit of just over $378,000 and a negative ending net position of $268,436.

04:11:30.420 --> 04:11:43.420
Time's 2022-23 adopted budget projected an operating surplus of approximately $509,000 and an ending net position of approximately $285,000.

04:11:43.420 --> 04:12:01.420
However, the school's first interim report updated its projections to incur a deficit of approximately $68,000 and an ending net position of negative $336,748 for the 2022-23 school year.

04:12:01.420 --> 04:12:20.420
Time's actual revenues and expenses from July 1 through February 28, 2023 reflect an operating deficit of $452,222 and an ending net position of negative $720,657.

04:12:20.420 --> 04:12:31.420
LACO remains concerned with Time's fiscal insolvency status due to the structural level of deficit spending, rising debts, and cash deficiencies.

04:12:31.420 --> 04:12:48.420
Time's reserves for economic uncertainties is negative and has grown from negative 23% to negative 34%, which is substantially below the 3% minimum reserve required pursuant to the LACO Monitoring Memorandum of Understanding.

04:12:48.420 --> 04:13:03.420
The table before you summarizes the changes in Time's financial position based on reported actuals from July 1, 2022 through February 28, 2023.

04:13:03.420 --> 04:13:21.420
Due to deficit spending, as previously discussed, Time's total assets decreased from $226,663 to negative $61,522, a decrease in total assets by approximately $288,000.

04:13:21.420 --> 04:13:41.420
The negative net assets of $61,522 is due to the sale of future state aid receivables in the amount of $328,800, offset by other assets including a cash balance of $49,943.

04:13:41.420 --> 04:14:04.420
Time's total liabilities increased from a July 1 balance of approximately $495,000 to $659,136 as of February 28, 2023, an increase in total liabilities of approximately $164,000 or 33%.

04:14:04.420 --> 04:14:13.420
Total net assets decreased by $452,222.

04:14:13.420 --> 04:14:21.420
As previously stated, Time's unrealistic projections, including revenue projections, have contributed to his current fiscal position.

04:14:21.420 --> 04:14:34.420
The school's adopted 2022-23 budget included approximately $247,000 in revenue from subleasing space within the school's facility.

04:14:34.420 --> 04:14:42.420
LACO staff met with Time to express concern regarding the school's ability to secure subleases totaling the budgeted amount.

04:14:42.420 --> 04:14:48.420
The amount was later revised to $150,000 in anticipated subleasing revenue.

04:14:48.420 --> 04:15:02.420
Time actualized just $19,710 in subleasing revenue through February 2023, which projects a shortfall in subleasing revenue of approximately $79,000.

04:15:02.420 --> 04:15:17.420
Of note, per the school's renegotiated lease, Time will no longer receive subleasing revenue as all subleasing revenue will go directly to the landlord.

04:15:17.420 --> 04:15:22.420
This table further illustrates Time's ongoing unrealistic revenue projections.

04:15:22.420 --> 04:15:30.420
Time's adopted budget for the 2022-23 school year projected $247,500 in annual revenue for subleasing.

04:15:30.420 --> 04:15:42.420
At the start of the year, these leases had not been executed, and a revised budget in October then projected $150,000 despite still having un-executed leases.

04:15:42.420 --> 04:15:50.420
In December, school leadership assured LACO that a January lease for $10,000 a month was forthcoming.

04:15:50.420 --> 04:16:04.420
In January, this was revised to begin in February, and in February revised again to begin in March, now for $6,000 a month rather than $10,000 per month.

04:16:04.420 --> 04:16:12.420
Just as Time's projected lease revenue in year two was unrealistic, so too has been their budgeted attendance rate.

04:16:12.420 --> 04:16:18.420
Despite historic data to the contrary, Time continued to budget at a 95% attendance rate.

04:16:18.420 --> 04:16:27.420
This has significantly impacted their projected and budgeted ADA.

04:16:27.420 --> 04:16:38.420
As you can see in the school's month-over-month attendance data, Time's monthly attendance rate has only met or exceeded 90% in six out of 19 months of the school's existence.

04:16:38.420 --> 04:16:44.420
Additionally, these all happened last year when the school had fewer students.

04:16:44.420 --> 04:16:54.420
Furthermore, half of the months where the attendance rate reached 90% occurred during months with 10 or fewer instructional days.

04:16:54.420 --> 04:17:02.420
Indeed, the month with the highest enrollment so far this year also saw the lowest attendance rate for this year.

04:17:02.420 --> 04:17:17.420
To assume that the school will somehow be able to increase its enrollment by more than it ever has, while additionally increasing its attendance rate seems to fly directly in the face of the school's own historical data.

04:17:17.420 --> 04:17:22.420
Time's response to the Notice of Violation contained no information related to cash flow projections.

04:17:22.420 --> 04:17:28.420
Therefore, the CDE and LACO were unable to provide additional analysis on this matter.

04:17:28.420 --> 04:17:35.420
Time's cash management remains a major area of concern.

04:17:35.420 --> 04:17:45.420
As of February 28, 2023, Time had a cash balance of $49,943 or approximately 13 days of operating cash.

04:17:45.420 --> 04:18:01.420
Due to its structural deficit, rising debts, and inadequate cash, Time may not be able to meet its financial obligations, including payroll and related expenses, in the current and subsequent fiscal years.

04:18:01.420 --> 04:18:06.420
Additional concerns regarding Time include adherence to fiscal policies.

04:18:06.420 --> 04:18:11.420
The school executed a loan prior to receiving approval from the Time Board.

04:18:11.420 --> 04:18:17.420
In its response to the Notice of Violation, the school stated that the violation was unintentional.

04:18:17.420 --> 04:18:26.420
There is a need for the school to enact corrective action to ensure that this violation would not happen again.

04:18:26.420 --> 04:18:44.420
At the time of its 2021-22 independent audit, Time had accumulated $281,348 in defaulted loans, along with an outstanding $100,000 loan from the charter school revolving loan fund.

04:18:44.420 --> 04:18:57.420
Time's response to the Notice of Violation does not provide evidence to refute the statements in the Notice of Violation related to Time's failure to repay its debts.

04:18:57.420 --> 04:19:09.420
As of February 28, 2022, Time had total liabilities of $659,136, comprised of the following.

04:19:09.420 --> 04:19:21.420
Seven promissory notes totaling over $325,000, five of which were due directly to the executive director for a total of $219,000.

04:19:21.420 --> 04:19:29.420
Several payments to the director were due between February 28, 2022, and August 31, 2022.

04:19:29.420 --> 04:19:43.420
$60,000 due to another private individual with a payment due August 15, 2022, and an additional $60,000 due to a sublease in April of 2023.

04:19:43.420 --> 04:19:48.420
Six of these promissory notes were defaulted for at least six months.

04:19:48.420 --> 04:20:05.420
Additional debt includes accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling $253,490, and a California school finance authority loan balance of $80,002.

04:20:05.420 --> 04:20:21.420
At the April 2023 ACCS meeting, Time stated that the $217,444 loan from its executive director had not yet been forgiven, as its forgiveness is dependent upon the outcome of the revocation hearing.

04:20:21.420 --> 04:20:32.420
Moreover, the revised fiscal stability plan submitted by the school included only conditional loan forgiveness for loans owed to the executive director.

04:20:32.420 --> 04:20:45.420
The note stated that the loans made to the school by the executive director would only be forgiven if the school operated for the full 2023-2024 school year.

04:20:45.420 --> 04:20:56.420
On February 16, 2023, the Time governing board accepted addendums to extend maturity dates and amend payment terms to six promissory notes.

04:20:56.420 --> 04:21:03.420
I will now turn the presentation back over to Mr. Ciccarelli.

04:21:03.420 --> 04:21:11.420
Thank you Dr. Brown.

04:21:11.420 --> 04:21:23.420
So on May 5, 2023, Time submitted a second fiscal stability plan and budget forecast, which was not submitted prior to the posting of this agenda item.

04:21:23.420 --> 04:21:41.420
However, the CDE and LACO have reviewed the information provided and find that the new plan and budget do not propose an adequate remedy to the school's financial situation, and in fact suggest further concerns of fiscal mismanagement.

04:21:41.420 --> 04:21:47.420
Upon its review of the new plan and budget, the CDE and LACO find the following.

04:21:47.420 --> 04:22:00.420
The plan again utilizes unrealistic ADA projections, budgeting a 90% monthly student attendance rate, despite the school only meeting that rate in six out of 19 months of the school's existence.

04:22:00.420 --> 04:22:05.420
The plan includes unrealized fundraising revenue.

04:22:05.420 --> 04:22:11.420
The multi-year budget projections fail to reflect outstanding financial liability.

04:22:11.420 --> 04:22:15.420
The plan provides no evidence of students intending to enroll.

04:22:15.420 --> 04:22:35.420
The plan includes conditional loan forgiveness based on continued school operation, and despite the failure to reflect all the liabilities, the plan still forecasts that the school will have a negative 9.3% reserve next year.

04:22:35.420 --> 04:22:43.420
In particular, this unrecognized liability comes from a revised facility lease.

04:22:43.420 --> 04:22:53.420
While the school has stated that the renegotiated lease reduces its liability or saves them money, this statement is patently false.

04:22:53.420 --> 04:23:11.420
The renegotiated lease merely defers part of the monthly rental costs for up to two years, with all these deferred monies potentially totaling almost $250,000 due in three equal payments at the end of the two-year period.

04:23:11.420 --> 04:23:33.420
Per this revised lease agreement, as of May 1, 2023, Time already owed the leaser $35,640 in monthly rental expense and late fees, which included the school's April 2023 past-due rent in the amount of $19,800.

04:23:33.420 --> 04:23:43.420
These monies are included with the deferred rental payments, which still include a year-over-year cost increase. Again, no money is saved.

04:23:43.420 --> 04:23:57.420
The landlord is in effect giving the school a loan and allowing them to fall further into debt, debt that is then not projected within the multi-year budget.

04:23:57.420 --> 04:24:07.420
On May 12, 2023, the Los Angeles County Charter SELPA issued a Notice of Concern to Time, which included the following information.

04:24:07.420 --> 04:24:21.420
Time's vendor for special education services informed the SELPA it would no longer provide services due to Time's non-payment of invoices, and they have sent this board a letter to that effect as well.

04:24:21.420 --> 04:24:33.420
Although Time secured a new vendor for special education services, the contract with the new vendor excludes several critical services to which Time's students with disabilities are entitled.

04:24:33.420 --> 04:24:48.420
According to the SELPA, the contract with the new vendor is insufficient and could result in the loss of educational benefit for students with disabilities that attend the school.

04:24:48.420 --> 04:24:56.420
Some further considerations to the educational program include staffing concerns and academic performance.

04:24:56.420 --> 04:25:06.420
For example, against advice to the contrary, the school intentionally left its counselor position unfilled due to its 2021-22 budget shortfall.

04:25:07.420 --> 04:25:11.420
Per the charter petition, this position coordinates student testing.

04:25:11.420 --> 04:25:25.420
On June 28, 2022, Time was issued a Notice of Concern by LACO, which included the school's failure to report academic performance for all students and low participation rates for benchmark assessments.

04:25:25.420 --> 04:25:34.420
The 2021-22 internal benchmark data that was submitted by Time shows that fewer than half its students met their growth projections in reading and math.

04:25:34.420 --> 04:25:42.420
LACO has requested Time's current 2022-23 internal benchmark data, however, that data has not been forwarded.

04:25:46.420 --> 04:25:49.420
LACO staff have tried to help the school.

04:25:49.420 --> 04:26:06.420
Since Time's authorization, LACO has taken many steps to support the charter school, including nine site visits by LACO staff that included the charter school office, facilities unit, pupil attendance, accounting, and compliance, the Los Angeles County SELPA, and even LACO board members.

04:26:06.420 --> 04:26:20.420
Two comprehensive meetings with the executive director and members of the governing board, monthly fiscal monitoring, biweekly Zoom meetings with all authorized county charter schools, and regular meetings, calls, and emails with a LACO assigned coordinator.

04:26:20.420 --> 04:26:35.420
Unfortunately, despite LACO staff having given specific and actionable advice, Time has been unwilling to implement much of the guidance offered by LACO staff, staff with extensive experience in new charter schools.

04:26:35.420 --> 04:26:42.420
Therefore, despite this widespread support, LACO staff were prompted to send notices of concern.

04:26:42.420 --> 04:26:49.420
As the commission can see, we have serious concerns with Time's ability to meet its fiscal responsibilities.

04:26:49.420 --> 04:26:52.420
We understand that there have been challenges.

04:26:52.420 --> 04:26:58.420
As charter leaders, we know that every school has challenges to which they must respond and adjust accordingly.

04:26:58.420 --> 04:27:07.420
Unfortunately, at every point where Time leadership is given the opportunity to adjust their budget according to real numbers, they refuse to do so.

04:27:07.420 --> 04:27:20.420
Time leadership presented to the state board last July stating they would pay off their debt this year, that the school had 70 students fully enrolled, with 15 more in progress and an additional 200 parents expressing interest.

04:27:20.420 --> 04:27:26.420
Despite this strong attestation, the school actually began the year with only 63 students.

04:27:26.420 --> 04:27:32.420
They do not use historic or baseline data and therefore fail to manage their money accordingly.

04:27:32.420 --> 04:27:40.420
This is why in two years the school's debt has ballooned to over $600,000 without a realistic plan to remove this debt.

04:27:40.420 --> 04:27:51.420
Time continues to have a structural deficit such that even if the school were able to receive significant one-time funds, this structural deficit would maintain its fiscal insolvency.

04:27:51.420 --> 04:27:58.420
We've given specific and actionable advice. Our seasoned and experienced fiscal advisors have given advice.

04:27:58.420 --> 04:28:01.420
We don't want any of our schools to fail.

04:28:01.420 --> 04:28:06.420
However, we cannot in good conscience simply hope for the best without planning for the worst.

04:28:06.420 --> 04:28:13.420
We need to advocate for the students and staff that suffer as the school continues to fail in its fiscal obligations.

04:28:13.420 --> 04:28:19.420
We need to stop this debt train before there is a mid-year closure that would be devastating to this community.

04:28:19.420 --> 04:28:25.420
We urge you to issue a notice of revocation to this school that has been unable to live up to its promise to the community.

04:28:25.420 --> 04:28:29.420
Thank you and I will hand the presentation back to the CDE staff.

04:28:35.420 --> 04:28:43.420
Thank you. Just in conclusion, the CDE concludes that there is no fiscal viability for time moving forward.

04:28:44.420 --> 04:28:54.420
Budget cash flow and multi-year projections, as you heard, continue to be based on unrealistic enrollment and financial projections, making its ongoing structural deficits and cash deficiencies masking.

04:28:54.420 --> 04:29:03.420
Time has insufficient cash, will not be able to meet its financial obligations in the current and subsequent two fiscal years, including payroll and related benefits.

04:29:03.420 --> 04:29:07.420
It is unable to repay its accumulated debts of over 700,000.

04:29:08.420 --> 04:29:17.420
So time has engaged in ongoing fiscal mismanagement and has failed to implement an adequate remedy, thereby continuing to undermine its ability to serve its students.

04:29:17.420 --> 04:29:25.420
The CDE recommends that the SBE issue a notice of intent to revoke with notice of facts to time pursuant to Ed Code Section 47607H.

04:29:25.420 --> 04:29:32.420
There is substantial evidence, as you've heard, that time has failed to meet generally accepted accounting principles and engaged in fiscal mismanagement.

04:29:32.420 --> 04:29:41.420
Time has failed to adequately refute remedy or propose to remedy the violations outlined in the NOV that was issued to the school by the SBE in March of 2023.

04:29:41.420 --> 04:29:52.420
At its April 18, 2023 meeting, the ACCS concurred with CDE's recommendation and unanimously voted to recommend that the SBE issue a notice of intent to revoke and notice of facts.

04:29:52.420 --> 04:30:05.420
If the SBE issues a notice of intent to revoke, as was mentioned earlier, at tomorrow's May 19th meeting, the SBE will hold a public hearing to consider the revocation of time and issue a final decision to revoke or decline to revoke the charter.

04:30:05.420 --> 04:30:10.420
That concludes our presentation. Thank you.

04:30:10.420 --> 04:30:17.420
All right. Thank you very much. We'll now hear from Dr. Gabriel Ramirez from TIME.

04:30:17.420 --> 04:30:19.420
Dr. Ramirez.

04:30:22.420 --> 04:30:38.420
Dr. Ramirez, you have 10 minutes. Please begin.

04:30:38.420 --> 04:30:44.420
Yeah, we won't start the clock till you begin.

04:30:44.420 --> 04:30:46.420
Can you hear me? Hello?

04:31:14.420 --> 04:31:24.420
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond, board members and superintendent.

04:31:24.420 --> 04:31:30.420
My name is Dr. Gabriel Ramirez and I'm the executive director and founder of TIME Community Schools.

04:31:30.420 --> 04:31:41.420
At the last meeting, you expressed your hesitation in closing our school because we were making academic gains and are having a positive impact on the community.

04:31:41.420 --> 04:31:45.420
You asked for a financial plan that could demonstrate our viability.

04:31:45.420 --> 04:31:55.420
Working with our back office provider, we developed a plan based on what we consider to be reasonable enrollment and revenue projections and submitted it to LACO and the CDE.

04:31:55.420 --> 04:32:04.420
The plan was reviewed at the April ACCS meeting. Members determined that the plan was incomplete based on LACO analysis.

04:32:05.420 --> 04:32:14.420
After the ACCS meeting, I spoke with LACO staff who reminded me that the ACCS recommendation is not the SBE's final decision.

04:32:14.420 --> 04:32:21.420
During that conversation, they provided me with greater detail about what would satisfy their concerns.

04:32:21.420 --> 04:32:30.420
The meeting reaffirmed the SBE and LACO's director Ciccarelli's comment about wanting every school to succeed.

04:32:30.420 --> 04:32:39.420
Over the next week, I reached out to the SBE, LACO and CDE to let them know that we would submit a revised plan that the SBE could approve.

04:32:39.420 --> 04:32:50.420
On May 5th, 2023, TIME submitted a specific, measurable, achievable and time-specific plan incorporating ACCS and LACO feedback.

04:32:50.420 --> 04:32:56.420
Yes, TIME has suffered and struggled financially. We acknowledge this.

04:32:56.420 --> 04:33:06.420
Facing enrollment challenges due to a pandemic, losing access to critical funds like SB 740 and the Startup Grant, and having debt has made it challenging.

04:33:06.420 --> 04:33:18.420
But TIME has never wavered in its commitment to providing a quality education, nor has TIME ever stopped looking for solutions to improve our finances.

04:33:18.420 --> 04:33:23.420
As LACO has told us, we are the little engine that could.

04:33:24.420 --> 04:33:27.420
There is nothing more important to us

04:33:46.420 --> 04:33:49.420
than educating children.

04:33:50.420 --> 04:34:00.420
And so, I'd like to review with you now our updated financial plan that we sent to LACO and the SBE two weeks ago.

04:34:02.420 --> 04:34:11.420
There are three areas of concern that the SBE and LACO identified in our previous plan, enrollment, projections and cash flow.

04:34:11.420 --> 04:34:24.420
I will first address enrollment. In their analysis, the SBE LACO stated that, quote, TIME has continuously failed to meet its enrollment projections with historical trends, indicating about 20 students per grade level, end quote.

04:34:24.420 --> 04:34:30.420
In our previous plan, TIME projected a 50% increase based on our first year growth.

04:34:30.420 --> 04:34:42.420
However, to demonstrate that we could better satisfy concerns, we used the SBE LACO analysis and increased our enrollment by simply 20 students for the 23-24 school year.

04:34:42.420 --> 04:34:55.420
We maintain this number of 82 total students for the 24-25 school year. According to the SBE LACO's analysis, an increase of 20 students is achievable and conservative.

04:34:55.420 --> 04:35:04.420
With this adjustment, TIME's updated plan has now met the first concern of unrealistic enrollment projections.

04:35:04.420 --> 04:35:11.420
The next concern is projections and whether these enrollment numbers allow TIME to eliminate all debt and meet the reserve.

04:35:11.420 --> 04:35:20.420
As you can see in the chart before you, based on our 20 student increase, TIME is able to reduce its debt quite significantly by the end of 23-24.

04:35:20.420 --> 04:35:31.420
In fact, TIME ends the year in surplus. In 24-25, with no growth projected, TIME has eliminated all year's deficit and meets the required 3% reserve.

04:35:31.420 --> 04:35:39.420
How did we achieve this? TIME's board approved a budget on 82 students for two consecutive years.

04:35:39.420 --> 04:35:47.420
TIME renegotiated our lease, reducing our liability from $35,640 to $20,000.

04:35:47.420 --> 04:36:00.420
Today, the Mexican-American Opportunity Foundation, a large community organization and partner to TIME, confirmed that they will sign another sub-lease with us to help further ease our lease expense.

04:36:00.420 --> 04:36:11.420
TIME renegotiated all personal loans to be paid over multiple years. Upon completion of the 23-24 school year, $218,000 of private loan will be forgiven.

04:36:11.420 --> 04:36:21.420
All of these actions are verified by fully executed documents and were submitted to LACO and CDE two weeks ago, with the exception of the new sub-lease made today.

04:36:21.420 --> 04:36:26.420
With the submission of these documents, we now satisfy the second concern of projections.

04:36:26.420 --> 04:36:37.420
TIME worked tirelessly to renegotiate these expenses and provide the verification to prove that our budget is based on real numbers, not wishful thinking.

04:36:37.420 --> 04:36:47.420
In regards to cash flow, TIME has partnered with an entity to support the short-term cash flow needs in the next two years until the timing of state revenue payment matches up to the current enrollment.

04:36:47.420 --> 04:36:57.420
As you can see in the chart, TIME will have a surplus each year that will be sufficient to build the cash reserves necessary to overcome the delay in cash receipts from government sources.

04:36:57.420 --> 04:37:02.420
TIME has now satisfied the third concern, cash flow.

04:37:02.420 --> 04:37:07.420
Lastly, I'd like to share with you what we've accomplished since our opening in July of 2021.

04:37:07.420 --> 04:37:12.420
70% of our students enter TIME with an average GPA of 1.5.

04:37:12.420 --> 04:37:14.420
The current GPA is 2.5.

04:37:14.420 --> 04:37:19.420
100% of our students participate in dual enrollment with East Los Angeles College.

04:37:19.420 --> 04:37:23.420
100% of our students pursue CTE pathways and internships.

04:37:23.420 --> 04:37:26.420
100% of our students participate in clubs.

04:37:26.420 --> 04:37:30.420
100% of our students receive tutoring.

04:37:30.420 --> 04:37:35.420
TIME received WASC accreditation, a huge accomplishment for a first-year school.

04:37:35.420 --> 04:37:41.420
TIME has been accepted into the League of Innovative Schools, the first single school to ever receive this honor.

04:37:41.420 --> 04:37:52.420
TIME was awarded a $78,000 grant so its teachers can participate in the Modern Classroom Project, a grant typically given to district schools but awarded to TCS because of our innovative model.

04:37:52.420 --> 04:37:58.420
TCS has identified and secured partnerships with six middle schools to allow us to promote our school on their campuses.

04:37:58.420 --> 04:38:03.420
TCS has established 10 community-based organizations that have committed to promoting TIME to all their families.

04:38:03.420 --> 04:38:09.420
And lastly, 15 local businesses support us and provide placements for student interns.

04:38:09.420 --> 04:38:15.420
I hope that what I presented has shown you that we are competent and capable.

04:38:15.420 --> 04:38:21.420
We strongly believe that our updated financial plan meets and satisfies all concerns.

04:38:21.420 --> 04:38:24.420
Our ask today is the following.

04:38:24.420 --> 04:38:28.420
Allow TIME to continue to enroll the 20 additional students.

04:38:28.420 --> 04:38:33.420
If we do not meet this number by the end of July, we will close.

04:38:33.420 --> 04:38:38.420
If this becomes necessary, families will still have enough notice to find another school.

04:38:38.420 --> 04:38:50.420
Also, if you do accept our proposal, I would ask that the SBE provide us a letter of good standing so that we may receive critical SB 740 funding for which we qualify.

04:38:50.420 --> 04:38:56.420
Today you will hear from parents, students, and community members who deeply support TIME.

04:38:56.420 --> 04:39:03.420
Also, I have shared with you over 80 letters of support from families and community members and leaders.

04:39:03.420 --> 04:39:08.420
They love our approach, our learning model, our commitment to them.

04:39:13.420 --> 04:39:17.420
I want to thank you for giving TIME this opportunity to present.

04:39:23.420 --> 04:39:31.420
And show you that we can reflect, grow, and meet our vision of preparing the next generation of leaders for our community.

04:39:31.420 --> 04:39:33.420
Thank you.

04:39:33.420 --> 04:39:36.420
Thank you very much, Dr. Ramirez.

04:39:36.420 --> 04:39:43.420
I am going to ask that we open the phone line for public comment.

04:39:43.420 --> 04:39:51.420
Members of the public should put up the slide for that.

04:39:51.420 --> 04:39:53.420
Somebody could do that.

04:39:54.420 --> 04:40:06.420
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so in person or by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

04:40:06.420 --> 04:40:19.420
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I'd like to ask Vice President Glover-Woods and Member Olken if they have any initial comments as our liaisons before we go to public comment, which will be followed by board discussion.

04:40:19.420 --> 04:40:21.420
Member Glover-Woods.

04:40:21.420 --> 04:40:29.420
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and thank you, Dr. Ramirez, for the presentation as well as CDE and LACO staff.

04:40:29.420 --> 04:40:38.420
To my fellow burden members, as you can see, we have a very critical and important decision in front of us.

04:40:38.420 --> 04:40:42.420
I won't rehash the presentations that we have heard.

04:40:42.420 --> 04:40:57.420
And I think the other thing I will say, and I'll turn it over to Member Olken, is that the decision we make today is critical to students and staff of that community.

04:40:57.420 --> 04:41:20.420
We also need to keep in consideration the numbers that have been presented, as well as the impact a decision today may have on the future of the school and also plans if it is decided to move to the next step tomorrow for the school.

04:41:20.420 --> 04:41:30.420
So I'll just leave my comments at that, and we'll share more as we go into our board discussion.

04:41:30.420 --> 04:41:42.420
Thank you. Thank you to our presenters for this is at least the third time that you've been here to talk about this with us.

04:41:42.420 --> 04:41:59.420
My framing comments are echoing Vice President Glover-Woods that this is a difficult and hard decision no matter what we do, in that it affects a whole school community.

04:41:59.420 --> 04:42:08.420
And, you know, it's clear that there's no ill intent here.

04:42:08.420 --> 04:42:20.420
You know, this is we are being asked to interpret the law and think about what our responsibility is.

04:42:20.420 --> 04:42:31.420
And as educators, we always make decisions partly with our heart, and I think also we have a role to really weigh facts here.

04:42:31.420 --> 04:42:38.420
So here we go. Thank you. That's all.

04:42:38.420 --> 04:42:50.420
Do we have in-person comment? Nicholas Watson.

04:42:50.420 --> 04:42:56.420
Good afternoon, members of board. Nicholas Watson speaking on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

04:42:56.420 --> 04:43:03.420
We are in opposition to the revocation of times charter times only been in operation for two years.

04:43:03.420 --> 04:43:15.420
It is not unusual for new schools, new charter schools to encounter financial and enrollment challenges, particularly when you open a school during a COVID pandemic.

04:43:15.420 --> 04:43:21.420
It's difficult financially. That's why we have these startup grant programs to help schools.

04:43:21.420 --> 04:43:26.420
The school facilities are very expensive. That's why we have the SB 740 program.

04:43:26.420 --> 04:43:32.420
It's nice to say that we want all of our schools to succeed and we don't want any of our schools to fail.

04:43:32.420 --> 04:43:42.420
But when we purposely take actions to deny financial resources that schools need to succeed, we have to be willing to acknowledge the consequences that that will have on school operations.

04:43:42.420 --> 04:44:02.420
So I just asked the board to consider how differently the schools finances will look today if they were given access to the financial opportunities that most charter schools are given when they start, when they open. Thank you.

04:44:02.420 --> 04:44:08.420
And are we ready to move to telephone comment?

04:44:08.420 --> 04:44:14.420
Yes, we have 27 callers in the queue currently. I will open the phone line now.

04:44:14.420 --> 04:44:24.420
Good afternoon State Board of Education. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:44:24.420 --> 04:44:27.420
Caller with the last four digits. Hello.

04:44:27.420 --> 04:44:31.420
My name is Grace. I'm a student at TCS.

04:44:31.420 --> 04:44:41.420
TCS has been a really good school for me. All the teachers put in so much effort into what they teach and how they do their classes.

04:44:41.420 --> 04:44:49.420
It's more unique than any school I've been to. It has helped me a lot by giving me the help I need to succeed with my grades.

04:44:49.420 --> 04:44:56.420
And I feel very comfortable and not stressed here. I'm doing better than I ever have in school. Thank you.

04:44:56.420 --> 04:45:14.420
Thank you. Next caller, please state your name and affiliation.

04:45:14.420 --> 04:45:22.420
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:45:22.420 --> 04:45:28.420
Caller with the last four digits. 3599, you are now live. Please start your public comment.

04:45:28.420 --> 04:45:33.420
That's me. Am I on? Hello?

04:45:33.420 --> 04:45:38.420
Oh, okay. Hi. I'm a mom from one of the children there.

04:45:38.420 --> 04:45:48.420
And I've seen so much improvement on my son with all the support that he gets, especially from the staff.

04:45:48.420 --> 04:46:00.420
And I was very grateful when that school was recommended to me because my son has, I tried public school with him and it did not work.

04:46:00.420 --> 04:46:08.420
I was getting called constantly every day. Whereas here, they talk to him, they help him.

04:46:09.420 --> 04:46:15.420
So, I mean, he's been in private school all his life until, except for when he started.

04:46:15.420 --> 04:46:22.420
And now he's here, which makes me feel like if he was in a private school because he's getting that attention.

04:46:22.420 --> 04:46:28.420
I think the staff there is wonderful. I get constant communication with them.

04:46:28.420 --> 04:46:37.420
And I just wish they'd give another chance to the school because my son will not make it in public school.

04:46:37.420 --> 04:46:47.420

Hi, yes, my name is Liz Hernandez and I'm a parent of one of the students, Miguel Hernandez.

04:47:14.420 --> 04:47:21.420
And I just wanted to say that my son went from being visible in public school, he moved to my mother's.

04:47:21.420 --> 04:47:25.420
He just like brought in his rising and find something different.

04:47:25.420 --> 04:47:38.420
And he went from all F's literally with like a 72% absent list to like, I think he missed two days of school for doctor's notes and all A's and B's.

04:47:38.420 --> 04:47:44.420
And every day he comes and tells my mom, oh, I learned this or they're doing this and this is so cool.

04:47:44.420 --> 04:47:49.420
And I think this is a great program for people like my son. And my son has an IEP.

04:47:49.420 --> 04:47:54.420
So he struggles in regular public school because they don't do the IEP program like they should.

04:47:54.420 --> 04:48:00.420
And even he hasn't had one problem having to use IEP here.

04:48:00.420 --> 04:48:09.420
And I think that they should give him another opportunity to continue because it's a great program and I strongly support it.

04:48:09.420 --> 04:48:11.420
Thank you. Thank you.

Good afternoon, members of the State Board of Education and members of the public.

04:48:23.420 --> 04:48:30.420
My name is David Navar and I am an educator for the Montevallo U-5 School District and president of the Montevallo Teachers Association.

04:48:30.420 --> 04:48:34.420
Today I'm asking you to proceed with the revocation of time starter.

04:48:34.420 --> 04:48:39.420
I am disciplining our community and our students by failing to engage in physical prudency.

04:48:39.420 --> 04:48:45.420
And we cannot afford to have time to engage in negligence at the expense of our students and their education.

04:48:45.420 --> 04:48:52.420
MUSD and the educators of MTA are ready to welcome time students with low pass size, devices for all students,

04:48:52.420 --> 04:48:59.420
a variety of programs including a robust CTE program, district paid APC, free lunch for all, and the very best teachers and staff.

04:48:59.420 --> 04:49:04.420
MTA supports the revocation of time starter. Thank you and have a great day.

04:49:12.420 --> 04:49:16.420
Yes, my name is Michael Mendia Jr. I am a father.

04:49:16.420 --> 04:49:20.420
My son is currently a sophomore at time community schools.

04:49:20.420 --> 04:49:31.420
And the reason why we chose this school is because we had a lot of issues with the Montevallo Unified School District in caring for my son with his mental health and his academic success.

04:49:31.420 --> 04:49:39.420
And when we did come to time community schools, they made it a priority that my son excel.

04:49:39.420 --> 04:49:44.420
He went from straight F's to A's and B's and getting college course credits.

04:49:44.420 --> 04:49:56.420
And they're very active in my son's academic life and making sure he's hitting all the necessary benchmarks to succeed not only in school but in life.

04:49:56.420 --> 04:50:03.420
Whereas we were getting roadblocks consistently before and right now the school is a godsend.

04:50:03.420 --> 04:50:16.420
And I feel that doing injustice to all the students if you take away their opportunity to grow and succeed and not have to go to a school where they're just a number and a paycheck.

04:50:16.420 --> 04:50:20.420

Hello, my name is Lorraine Richards. I am a classroom teacher representing the California Teachers Association.

04:50:31.420 --> 04:50:46.420
CTA supports the CDE's recommendation that the State Board issue a notice of intent to revoke with notice of fact to time and hold a public hearing to issue a final decision to revoke time charter at its May 19, 2023 meeting.

04:50:46.420 --> 04:50:57.420
There is substantial evidence that shows that Time Board has failed to follow generally accepted accounting principles and has engaged in fiscal mismanagement.

04:50:57.420 --> 04:51:08.420
The CDE has determined that Time has not adequately refuted, remedied, or proposed a plan to remedy the violations identified in the notice violation.

04:51:08.420 --> 04:51:14.420
We have been provided a subpar fiscal stability plan that is not adequate to remedy the violation.

04:51:14.420 --> 04:51:20.420
It is time to take action and move forward with the revocation process. Thank you. Thank you.

Good afternoon. My name is Martel Lowen. I am the grandmother of Miguel Hernandez, and I also want to support the continuation of time school time charter school, and I echo the comments of the first gentleman in that time charter school should be given the benefit to

04:51:58.420 --> 04:52:12.420
be able to acquire additional funding to take into consideration the pandemic and the effects of the pandemic on not just time, but on hundreds and thousands of other students in school.

04:52:12.420 --> 04:52:34.420
My grandson, as his mother mentioned earlier, was getting asked in school. He wasn't going to school, and since he has been with us and attending time, he has not missed any school for reasons unexcusable other than doctor's appointments.

04:52:34.420 --> 04:52:44.420
He is very excited about attending time. He's very excited about going to school every day. He was a child that would not get up to go to school.

04:52:44.420 --> 04:52:46.420
Thank you. Thank you.

Yes, my name is Albert Navarro. I am a friend of one of the students there. My student, when he first started, he was doing real bad in other schools, and he didn't want to go to school at all.

04:53:49.420 --> 04:53:58.420
But once he started trying, it really helped him out, become more focused in school. Now all he wants to do is go to school. He's doing real good in his classes.

04:53:58.420 --> 04:54:25.420
He can become more, he can get more students in and out of school because of the school, and they help him out a lot.

Hello, good morning. My name is Jenny Ramirez. Good morning and good day to everybody.

04:55:00.420 --> 04:55:24.420
I'm very thankful for the director of the school and the staff, teachers, because my son has been making great academic progress at this school.

04:55:24.420 --> 04:55:51.420
So my student is very happy at the school. Thank you to the director, to the staff. My son wakes up early.

04:55:51.420 --> 04:56:01.420
He is very motivated to go to school and hopefully, given the blessing of God, the school will continue to operate. Thank you to everybody.

Hi, good afternoon. My name is Cindy Pais and I'm a parent. My daughter is a sophomore there.

04:56:28.420 --> 04:56:37.420
Something that I want to mention about the school is the way they teach to their students, which has made a big difference to my daughter.

04:56:37.420 --> 04:56:53.420
I've noticed a huge difference in my daughter where she can speak her mind now. That's a big skill that they need for college.

04:56:53.420 --> 04:57:03.420
I'm really happy with the school. I drive kind of far. I drive like 45 minutes, but it's worth it because the school really focuses on the community.

04:57:03.420 --> 04:57:13.420
And it's something that she has, you know, helped her tremendously. So hopefully you guys would reconsider and keep the school open. Thank you.

I am a mother of three students at the charter school.

04:57:45.420 --> 04:58:10.420
I want to say thank you to all the directors and the teachers of the school because of them, my children are having better grades.

04:58:10.420 --> 04:58:35.420
Please, I want you to support the school and maintain it open.

04:58:35.420 --> 04:58:43.420
I want you to support the school and maintain it open so my children can have a better opportunity.

04:58:43.420 --> 04:58:54.420
So please follow my support. And if they can remain the school, the charter schools open. Thank you.

Hi, yes. Hi, yes. My name is Alberto Rojas. I'm calling on behalf of Time Community Charter High School and its staff, parents and students.

04:59:19.420 --> 04:59:30.420
I help Time with enrollment and outreach. As someone who attended schooling here in the state of California, I strongly believe that Time has an enriching program that has been making a life changing impact in both student and parent lives.

04:59:30.420 --> 04:59:36.420
And we want to continue doing so. Not only has it been changing lives of students, but also its staff.

04:59:36.420 --> 04:59:41.420
I include myself in that group that has been impacted in a positive way by the school and Dr. Ramirez.

04:59:42.420 --> 04:59:50.420
Dr. Ramirez is a true educator and mentor. And if the state decides to close our school, then they will prevent us from continuing helping both current and future families.

04:59:50.420 --> 05:00:02.420
Thus, it will be a failing the city of Montebello, neighboring cities, and most importantly, families by stopping us from providing quality education to students enrolled now and in the future.

05:00:02.420 --> 05:00:07.420
I am requesting an extension to allow our school to continue operating because children are the future.

05:00:07.420 --> 05:00:17.420
And we want to continue enriching our community of Montebello and other neighboring communities to help produce more successful people, which is our goal here at Time.

05:00:17.420 --> 05:00:22.420
Thank you. And the people calling for the revocation of Time should take a look in their...

Time Community Schools is a very important part of Montebello. It has become one of the centers for students.

05:05:08.420 --> 05:05:18.420
It is a school that is being served. It's a school that serves the underserved students.

05:05:18.420 --> 05:05:28.420
It is very important that Time Community remain open to give Montebello and the surrounding community choices for the students.

05:05:28.420 --> 05:05:40.420
Time Community Schools, it's a work in progress. I have seen the staff and the faculty demonstrate their full commitment to serving the students. Thank you.

My name is Alejandro Munoz and I work with the Outreach and Enrollment with Time Communities Schools.

05:07:21.420 --> 05:07:31.420
And I'm curious to know if traditional schools with long standing had a call like this. How many of the families would call in with a story of transformation?

05:07:31.420 --> 05:07:40.420
I'm sure they'd have academic success stories, but would they have this many stories of students whose lives have been transformed by what time it was offering?

05:07:40.420 --> 05:07:50.420
The passion and commitment that Dr. Ramirez demonstrated is what the students get tenfold. And the school serves a purpose.

05:07:50.420 --> 05:07:55.420
It's like a vital organ and if it's missing and taken away, the community will not survive.

05:07:55.420 --> 05:08:04.420
It may be on the surface, it may look like things are great, but there are needs that are not being met and Time Communities Schools meets those needs. Thank you.

Hi, my name is Lamar Brown, president of the Board for Time Communities Schools. Thank you all for the time today.

05:08:20.420 --> 05:08:26.420
We have had our difficulties, but as always, we remain committed to our students, our families, and our communities.

05:08:26.420 --> 05:08:31.420
We love our community and what we have built in this short amount of time.

05:08:31.420 --> 05:08:45.420
Really what we're asking for, please just give time, a little bit more time to continue to see out our vision of serving our students, our families, our community, as well as we know that we can and as well as we have.

Hi, my name is Gloria De Dios and I have a student there in school and I've struggled with him for a long time and I think he's done so much better while he's there.

05:09:13.420 --> 05:09:21.420
He gets all the support. They help him so much and I'm constantly surprised.

05:09:21.420 --> 05:09:29.420
But yes, Dr. Ramirez is so supportive and all the other staff members, he finds himself there really great.

05:09:29.420 --> 05:09:41.420
I mean, I have to drive. I live in Puente and I have to drive a distance, but I don't care as long as I know he's getting the education and the help he needs so that he can focus because that's one of his problems.

05:09:41.420 --> 05:09:48.420
So I appreciate if you guys change it and just make it go, make it keep going because he really needs that.

05:09:48.420 --> 05:09:55.420
I think a lot of students need that that are being left out in other schools that are not being helped.

05:09:55.420 --> 05:10:04.420
So please have a heart and keep it open because our kids need it. Thank you.

Hi, my name is Carla Guzman and I'm a special ed parent at Time Community School where families are welcome.

05:10:19.420 --> 05:10:29.420
This school has provided a safe environment not only for my child, but all students enrolled and future students who are considering enrolling as a special ed parent.

05:10:29.420 --> 05:10:34.420
My son has been struggling academically and his previous public school.

05:10:34.420 --> 05:10:55.420
And when I was recommended from this school, my my child has improved a lot and he has been more open and him being having social phobia has helped him at this school in volunteering and doing other activities that he normally wouldn't do.

05:10:56.420 --> 05:11:09.420
So I will really appreciate my son having an opportunity to continue to attend this school and where I know if it closes down, he will definitely struggle and other public schools. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Layla and I am a student at Time Community School.

05:11:34.420 --> 05:11:40.420
One thing I love about Time Community School is they will do anything to help you out.

05:11:40.420 --> 05:11:48.420
And before I came to Time Community School, I was failing all my classes at my district school and I had no help.

05:11:48.420 --> 05:11:57.420
Time took their time to help me get my grades up and do better and I have. I'm passing all my classes and my behavior hasn't improved. Thank you.

Hi, good afternoon. My name is Jenny Lopez. I'm a mother of one of your students, other students at Time Community.

05:12:14.420 --> 05:12:20.420
I just want to say really short that we are just asking for one more chance.

05:12:20.420 --> 05:12:29.420
You know, the students, we started with the school and I know it's been difficult and I understand all the money wise and your concern, which is a huge one.

05:12:29.420 --> 05:12:35.420
But please reconsider the impact that this school is making on our kids.

05:12:35.420 --> 05:12:45.420
I try like 45 minutes as well. And like the other mother was saying, I don't care because, you know, I can see my my daughter improving academically,

05:12:45.420 --> 05:12:53.420
socializing, you know, she has hard time communicating with people and she's been totally day and night.

05:12:53.420 --> 05:13:00.420
I mean, it's like a big change. And I want for her to continue to have that support from that school and the teachers.

05:13:00.420 --> 05:13:05.420
And we're working together and we're, you know, we're doing anything that we can do to get more students.

05:13:05.420 --> 05:13:09.420
So just giving us one more chance, please reconsider. Please. Thank you.

I'm calling the State Board of Education to request the support for this school.

05:14:11.420 --> 05:14:20.420
We believe that it's very important for this school to remain open because we believe school with small group of students in the classroom

05:14:20.420 --> 05:14:26.420
receive the necessary help from the teachers to be successful. Thank you so much.

I'm calling on behalf of Time Charter School. I have my daughter there.

05:15:21.920 --> 05:15:27.040
It's the first year here in that school and it's an excellent school. I would like that

05:15:27.040 --> 05:15:45.840
the school remain open. Teachers are great, same as the director. I'm actually a volunteer

05:15:45.840 --> 05:16:14.800
at school. And I would strongly like that the school remain open. Classes are excellent

05:16:14.800 --> 05:16:20.080
and my daughter has made many good friends at school and I would not like her to make

05:16:20.080 --> 05:16:31.680
friends otherwise. Thank you very much.

Hello. Hi, can you hear me? We can.

05:16:43.400 --> 05:16:51.600
Hi, yes, my name is Sebastian Ayala. I'm calling in support of Time Community Schools. I just

05:16:51.600 --> 05:16:57.240
wanted to reiterate what the first gentleman said, that if the school did have access to

05:16:57.240 --> 05:17:03.280
the funds that other charter schools had access to due to, unfortunately due to COVID, what

05:17:03.280 --> 05:17:09.880
kind of state the school would be in. And I believe that Dr. Ramirez did plan out a

05:17:09.880 --> 05:17:18.240
he did address the mismanagement of the funds in his presentation. And second to who we

05:17:18.240 --> 05:17:23.160
should really be asking or talking to are the students and their families. And I believe

05:17:23.160 --> 05:17:27.720
all of the students and all of the families have nothing but positive things to say about

05:17:27.720 --> 05:17:32.360
the school. Their lives have been changed for the better. They're doing something that

05:17:32.440 --> 05:17:37.240
other schools just frankly aren't, not that they're not willing, but just other schools

05:17:37.240 --> 05:17:42.360
haven't addressed the issues that these students have dealt with. And so I believe that Ramirez

05:17:42.360 --> 05:17:48.280
does, he did address the fiscal mismanagement and I believe that we should only be listening.

05:17:48.280 --> 05:17:50.760
Thank you. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Blanca Prado Randolph and my husband Stafford Randolph. We were looking

05:18:04.920 --> 05:18:10.400
for a school for my daughter in our community. We were really surprised to find a time charter

05:18:10.400 --> 05:18:16.680
school. When we first arrived at the school, we were met with Mr. Ramirez and he gave us

05:18:16.680 --> 05:18:22.800
a tour of the school. The school is very clean. The classroom format is very nice for the

05:18:22.960 --> 05:18:28.520
students. I feel he's the first one ever to take interest in my daughter's academics

05:18:28.520 --> 05:18:35.520
and have her now take an IEP. We're saddened that this school will be closing. The teachers

05:18:36.160 --> 05:18:39.000
are very nice and professional and here's my husband.

05:18:39.000 --> 05:18:46.000
I just want to say too that it's very nice to have an alternative in the neighborhood

05:18:47.000 --> 05:18:54.000
in the area for kids that need to catch up, that they need a second chance and be refocused

05:18:54.240 --> 05:19:01.240
and Mr. Ramirez does a great job at doing so. He's a great resource in this area and

05:19:01.640 --> 05:19:05.720
it would be a major, major launch.

05:19:05.720 --> 05:19:12.200

Hi, my name is Judy, Judy Pillin of Desauletron and I would like for you to consider keeping

05:19:21.280 --> 05:19:26.560
the school open. I've seen a great advancement in my son's education. He's actually excited

05:19:26.560 --> 05:19:33.560
to go to school. We currently live in Compton and he drives all the way to Montebello for

05:19:34.280 --> 05:19:39.240
his learning. I've seen a boost of his confidence in his education. It's really helped him

05:19:39.240 --> 05:19:45.760
out a lot. So please consider keeping the school open and he's very happy with his

05:19:45.760 --> 05:19:49.880
teachers and everything. So thank you for your consideration.

05:19:49.880 --> 05:19:54.720

Yes, hi. Good afternoon. My name is Eduardo. I'm a resident of Montebello and I am looking

05:20:26.480 --> 05:20:31.560
for alternatives for my child that is enrolling this fall in high school. When I look at the

05:20:31.560 --> 05:20:37.360
academic performance of Montebello Unified, it is concerning to know that, well, some

05:20:37.480 --> 05:20:44.480
realities are that Sher High School's current proficiency rate is at 16% in math. Belle

05:20:44.560 --> 05:20:51.560
Gardens High School is at 9% in math. And lastly, Montebello High has a 7.7% proficiency

05:20:53.640 --> 05:21:00.040
in math. This is an unfortunate thing. Certainly, being fiscally sound is important for any

05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:05.760
school, but we also need to look at the accountability of public schools as well as charter schools.

05:21:06.160 --> 05:21:11.160
So I do encourage the board today to consider different options for charter schools that

05:21:11.160 --> 05:21:17.160
are initiating in a COVID era, but more importantly, being really holding everyone accountable

05:21:17.160 --> 05:21:22.160
across the board, not only traditional school settings as well as charter schools. So thank

05:21:22.160 --> 05:21:27.160
you for your time. I do believe that everyone deserves more opportunities in a post-COVID

05:21:27.160 --> 05:21:30.160
era. Thank you for your time. Thank you.

Hello, my name is Jason Stenumer. I'm Managing Director of Charter Impact here to advocate

05:21:44.720 --> 05:21:50.000
for Time Charter School. Time is like many other schools who have struggled with enrollment

05:21:50.000 --> 05:21:54.080
during the pandemic, especially considering that the school opened in the middle of the

05:21:54.080 --> 05:22:00.120
pandemic. Time's unique program provides a positive and rewarding educational experience

05:22:01.080 --> 05:22:04.080
as you have heard from many students and parents today.

05:22:04.080 --> 05:22:08.360
Speaking to Time's financials, regardless of what has been stated today, the school follows

05:22:08.360 --> 05:22:14.280
all gap required financial practices. They've had zero financial findings in their audit

05:22:14.280 --> 05:22:19.840
and they have not defaulted on any loans. Lastly, on a procedural note, the CDE and

05:22:19.840 --> 05:22:26.800
LACO are given no time limit and took 33 minutes to present their side of the argument today.

05:22:27.480 --> 05:22:31.680
Time is only allowed 10 minutes for their rebuttal. Dr. Ramirez is a passionate educator

05:22:31.680 --> 05:22:38.680
and this school is his life. The inequity does not seem fair or just in the process

05:22:38.680 --> 05:22:41.560
of such a large decision. Thank you.

05:22:50.080 --> 05:22:58.200
Hello, my name is Kevin Oliver Garcia. I am a student here at TCS. The school has helped

05:22:58.200 --> 05:23:03.400
me a lot. Going from sixth to seventh grade, I was doing all right, but once I hit eighth

05:23:03.400 --> 05:23:09.040
grade, dropping my grades was going straight F and didn't graduate. After coming here to

05:23:09.040 --> 05:23:17.640
TCS, I've really improved going to have a passing GPA of 2.37. I think the school really

05:23:17.840 --> 05:23:23.040
makes improvements in a lot of the students, seeing them from being very uncomfortable

05:23:23.040 --> 05:23:27.560
and anxious at the beginning of the school year to seeing them all huddled around in

05:23:27.560 --> 05:23:31.520
the middle of groups having fun every day, getting to know one another. I think the school

05:23:31.520 --> 05:23:35.560
has offered a really good opportunity to most of the students and the community here in

05:23:35.560 --> 05:23:42.720
Montebello. I just feel like the counselor should give Dr. Ramirez a second opportunity

05:23:42.800 --> 05:23:49.800
to show that he really can do all that he promises, and that's about it.

I have two students attending time in school, and for myself, it's been very successful.

05:24:40.960 --> 05:24:45.960
I have one kid almost dropping out of school. He was a ninth grade, a troubled kid. He went

05:24:45.960 --> 05:24:51.960
in there, and now his GPA is up. He's interested in going to school every day, and I'm really

05:24:51.960 --> 05:24:56.960
impressed. We have wonderful staff in there. The doctor is doing an amazing job, something

05:24:57.040 --> 05:25:02.040
I couldn't experience in a public school, and I would like to hate this school to be

05:25:02.040 --> 05:25:08.040
closed, so I request and beg to have it open. Give him a second opportunity, and with that

My name is Sebastian Petz. I'm a pastor of the Word Church LA, of which Montebello Christian

05:26:03.120 --> 05:26:08.120
School is the ministry of in the city of Montebello. I've gotten to know Dr. Ramirez

05:26:08.120 --> 05:26:15.120
as a friend, as a colleague, and even a bit of a mentor in the Christian education leadership

05:26:15.560 --> 05:26:22.560
space. As our school also struggled coming through COVID, and getting to meet Dr. Ramirez

05:26:23.920 --> 05:26:28.640
and hearing his vision for Christian education, not sorry, Christian education, but education

05:26:28.640 --> 05:26:35.640
in general, especially from a project-based learning philosophy, seeing how well a lot

05:26:36.400 --> 05:26:42.880
of our kids are now doing in freshman year of their high school, having graduated from

05:26:42.880 --> 05:26:48.760
our school, which is a K-8 school. I think shutting this school down, in fact, I'm confident

05:26:48.760 --> 05:26:55.040
that shutting this school down now would be a huge disservice to not only our children,

05:26:55.040 --> 05:27:01.160
but every single student that's enrolled in their school, knowing how lackluster the

05:27:01.160 --> 05:27:04.720
educational alternatives are in the public school district.

05:27:04.720 --> 05:27:11.720
Thank you, your time is up. Next caller with the last four digits, 9478, you are now live,

05:27:19.280 --> 05:27:26.280
please start your public comment. Good afternoon, please state your name and affiliation. You

05:27:38.080 --> 05:27:45.080
have one minute, your time starts now. Caller, are you there? Hello, my name is Shawna.

05:27:49.680 --> 05:27:56.680
Hello, my name is Shawn. I go to TCS schools. Before, I had a 0.5 GPA. I wanted to drop

05:27:58.680 --> 05:28:03.840
out of school, but when I came to TCS, they really motivated me and pushed me. Now I have

05:28:03.840 --> 05:28:10.840
a 2.5 GPA. Thank you, caller. And caller with the last four digits, 7563, you are now live,

05:28:10.840 --> 05:28:17.840
please start your public comment. Yeah, hello, my name is Anthony Ramirez, and I'm a student

05:28:24.760 --> 05:28:30.400
at Time Community Schools. One thing that makes Time Community Schools unique is how

05:28:30.400 --> 05:28:35.320
amazing the teachers here are. TCS has really helped me a lot to find answers to all my

05:28:35.360 --> 05:28:42.360
questions I have about my personal life, about subjects in school. It's just really amazing.

05:28:42.520 --> 05:28:46.880
And the teachers here are always really supportive, and they always support every student without

05:28:46.880 --> 05:28:53.880
hesitation, just in any way they can. And overall, it's just really amazing school with the teachers

05:28:54.040 --> 05:29:01.040
the most amazing asset of all of it. But yeah, please keep the school open, and all the students

05:29:01.320 --> 05:29:06.480
here have so much potential. Thank you for listening. Thank you. That concludes public

05:29:06.480 --> 05:29:13.480
comment for item number 10. Thank you so much to all the people who called in. We do have

05:29:13.920 --> 05:29:19.520
a request for a very short break because we want to have everyone's attention after the

05:29:19.520 --> 05:29:26.520
break for the conversation that we need to have. So it is 3.26. We'll return at 3.36.

05:29:31.040 --> 05:29:38.040
All right. Welcome back. This is going to be a difficult conversation. I want to open

05:29:46.800 --> 05:29:53.800
for board discussion. Stephanie Farland from CDE and members of the L.A. County Office

05:29:54.920 --> 05:30:00.560
of Education Charter, school oversight staff, and Dr. Gabriel Ramirez will all be available

05:30:00.640 --> 05:30:07.640
to answer questions from board members if you have some. And so I'm going to open it

05:30:07.640 --> 05:30:14.640
up. Member Olken, are you waving your hand? First, just after having listened to both

05:30:22.640 --> 05:30:29.640
sets of presentations and the public comment, I just want to start by saying it was so clear

05:30:29.960 --> 05:30:37.040
how much Dr. Ramirez cares about his school and his students and that Time Charter School

05:30:37.040 --> 05:30:42.440
is a place where students feel empowered as learners and people. And as a school leader,

05:30:42.440 --> 05:30:48.000
that's certainly what I hope my kids and families feel and would articulate. And at the same

05:30:48.000 --> 05:30:55.000
time, I was also convinced that LACA has worked really hard to support and guide Time and

05:30:55.480 --> 05:31:02.480
has done a lot on their behalf. And so I have a couple of questions. The first one is specifically

05:31:06.720 --> 05:31:13.720
to understand the level of really to understand what we need to be certain of today when we

05:31:18.240 --> 05:31:24.120
vote versus what we need to be certain of tomorrow when we vote. Thank you. Member Olken,

05:31:24.120 --> 05:31:31.120
that's a good question. Is this on? It is, right? Okay. So today, what the board needs

05:31:31.120 --> 05:31:37.360
to determine is that there's enough evidence to actually have a hearing on revocation tomorrow.

05:31:37.360 --> 05:31:43.440
So tomorrow there'll be a public hearing and you'll have your discussion about whether

05:31:43.440 --> 05:31:47.880
or not you should revoke the school. Today is just, is there enough evidence to move

05:31:47.880 --> 05:31:54.880
to that hearing tomorrow? Other comments or questions? Member Glover-Woods? Actually,

05:32:00.960 --> 05:32:07.960
a couple of questions before comment. And this question I believe is for Dr. Ramirez,

05:32:09.080 --> 05:32:16.080
but if not, but please. I wanted to ask a question about the other revenue streams that's listed

05:32:17.080 --> 05:32:24.080
on the document you gave us. I noticed there were three items on the additional revenue

05:32:25.080 --> 05:32:32.080
stream area. My question is, are these revenue streams that have been secured or revenue

05:32:35.080 --> 05:32:42.080
streams that will be applied for but are not secured at this time? So those are other revenue

05:32:43.080 --> 05:32:47.080
streams that we will apply for, but in the updated budget that we provided, they were

05:32:47.080 --> 05:32:53.080
not included. Our budget, from our perspective, our budget works without that. I just wanted

05:32:53.080 --> 05:32:58.080
to show as well that we will continue to look for other means to support the school, but

05:32:58.080 --> 05:33:05.080
again, the updated budget works on the ADA, our projected ADA of 82 students. Okay, and

05:33:05.360 --> 05:33:12.360
my other question is in relation to the lease change in amount, I heard one thing from you

05:33:14.320 --> 05:33:20.480
and I think I heard something different from the LACO presentation. As far as the lease

05:33:20.480 --> 05:33:27.480
amount is concerned, has the lease been reduced or is the lease amount deferred to a later

05:33:27.480 --> 05:33:34.480
time when the fiscal viability of the school might be stronger? It's a little bit of both.

05:33:35.480 --> 05:33:40.480
So as we talked with our back office provider and with the owner of the building, we shared

05:33:40.480 --> 05:33:45.480
with them our circumstance of what we needed to improve our financial situation. So what

05:33:45.480 --> 05:33:50.480
the lease states is that, well, currently what the lease states is that we're liable

05:33:50.480 --> 05:33:55.480
for the $35,640, and that was part of the change in the amount that we were able to

05:33:55.480 --> 05:34:00.480
get $35,640, and that was part of the challenge because that is a large amount of money, considering

05:34:00.480 --> 05:34:07.480
also that we did not get access to the SB740, which gives us a portion of that lease money

05:34:07.480 --> 05:34:11.480
back. That's what it's served for. So the burden was larger on us because we did not

05:34:11.480 --> 05:34:18.480
get SB740. So what we asked was how can you help us so that we're not burdened, we don't

05:34:18.480 --> 05:34:24.480
have that total burden of $35,640. So what the owners did was that they reduced us for

05:34:24.480 --> 05:34:30.480
that we're only liable for $20,000. Yes, it's correct that the subleases that we secure

05:34:30.480 --> 05:34:36.480
go to them temporarily, but that's between the owner now and them. We are only liable

05:34:36.480 --> 05:34:42.480
for the $20,000. Now there is about a $5,000 difference between what we originally have

05:34:42.480 --> 05:34:50.480
between what the sublease provides and the total cost. So there was a shortfall of about

05:34:50.480 --> 05:34:57.480
$5,000, which when Laker was saying there's an accumulation that we have to pay after

05:34:57.480 --> 05:35:04.480
two years. So the amount right now is around 200-something thousand, but that's not the

05:35:04.480 --> 05:35:11.480
actual amount. The reason why there's that amount of 200,000 is because they're including

05:35:11.480 --> 05:35:16.480
the taxes for the property until our nonprofit status gets approved, which will be approved

05:35:16.480 --> 05:35:20.480
within this next month, which then brings down that balloon payment, I guess if you will,

05:35:20.480 --> 05:35:29.480
will bring it down to 120. Then from 120 is why I shared with you the MOAF lease that

05:35:29.480 --> 05:35:36.480
we have secured, which is $3,500, which will then go to pay off this deficit. So by the

05:35:36.480 --> 05:35:44.480
time that we get to the third year, we should only owe about $40,000 that will be

05:35:44.480 --> 05:35:49.480
then paid over three payments. And like you said, because at that point, we will be in a

05:35:49.480 --> 05:35:54.480
better financial situation, as you see to the chart that I provided. We will have surplus.

05:35:54.480 --> 05:35:59.480
So in our minds, it allowed us to create an opportunity for us to improve our financial

05:35:59.480 --> 05:36:03.480
situation in a way that was manageable and achievable.

05:36:03.480 --> 05:36:05.480
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Ramirez.

05:36:05.480 --> 05:36:09.480
Thank you.

05:36:10.480 --> 05:36:14.480
I have a couple of questions on enrollment.

05:36:14.480 --> 05:36:15.480
Yes, sir.

05:36:15.480 --> 05:36:23.480
So you pretty much, you will be losing how many students once they graduate from senior year?

05:36:23.480 --> 05:36:30.480
So next year will be our first year of seniors and we only have 13 students, so we will lose 13 students.

05:36:30.480 --> 05:36:39.480
Okay, so you're really looking at increasing not 20, but about 27.

05:36:39.480 --> 05:36:48.480
Okay, which is pretty significant. It's over 30% of your current population.

05:36:48.480 --> 05:36:59.480
So help me understand how are you going to, how can you ensure us that it will be an increase of 20?

05:36:59.480 --> 05:37:03.480
Yes, sir. So that's part of the thing that we've been working very diligently on is to establish these

05:37:03.480 --> 05:37:08.480
relationships with local feeder schools and other organizations that serve the families of Montebello.

05:37:08.480 --> 05:37:15.480
One of them called in today, the pastor from Montebello Christian, who our first year they sent us four kids.

05:37:15.480 --> 05:37:21.480
This last year they sent us seven kids. This year they're on part to send us another seven kids.

05:37:21.480 --> 05:37:26.480
We are working with other charter middle schools that are within the vicinity because we serve about six

05:37:26.480 --> 05:37:33.480
cities who also are sending us families. They're sending us their waiting list.

05:37:33.480 --> 05:37:39.480
Also there is, like I mentioned, MOF, another partner with us, another partnership is Latinos Unidos.

05:37:39.480 --> 05:37:44.480
So one of the things that they're doing at our campus that I just feel is a really great way to bring families

05:37:44.480 --> 05:37:52.480
and some, I guess notoriety if you will, to our school as well is that we have space for a food drive.

05:37:52.480 --> 05:37:56.480
And what I love about it is that a that our students get a partner and be part of that and do part of their

05:37:56.480 --> 05:38:01.480
volunteer community service with that. But in that food drive that they have done previously, they get about

05:38:01.480 --> 05:38:05.480
a thousand families a week. And so for us, it's another opportunity to bring in families.

05:38:05.480 --> 05:38:10.480
We're also working with another community organization called Montebello Youth Institute, who also is

05:38:10.480 --> 05:38:16.480
partnering with us. Also we are working with City Council, who is also looking for ways to increase our

05:38:16.480 --> 05:38:21.480
enrollment. We're also working with SEA, which is an organization that I'm sure you're very familiar with

05:38:21.480 --> 05:38:25.480
that also has, they work with struggling students who have also said that they're going to push families

05:38:25.480 --> 05:38:33.480
our way. So I think the idea of 27 students feels very achievable for us. I mean, again, from last year

05:38:33.480 --> 05:38:39.480
to this year, there was a 50% increase. Now I'm like, you know, 50% as you get bigger, it becomes larger.

05:38:39.480 --> 05:38:44.480
I understand that. So I think at 37%, like you're saying, still feels achievable for us. And I think within the

05:38:44.480 --> 05:38:48.480
timeframe that we have, I do believe that we can meet those numbers.

05:38:53.480 --> 05:39:01.480
Thank you. And before I began, I also want to echo the comments that Member Olken also said about thank you

05:39:01.480 --> 05:39:08.480
for the presentation from all three groups. And it was heartfelt to see your passion and your desire to help

05:39:08.480 --> 05:39:14.480
your students succeed and also to hear from the families and members of the community on the call about how much

05:39:14.480 --> 05:39:20.480
the school means to them. So thank you for what you're doing for our students. I do have a couple of questions

05:39:20.480 --> 05:39:27.480
and they're related to enrollment, such as Member Escobedo. And the first one was when you began your presentation,

05:39:27.480 --> 05:39:36.480
you said that you had met with the LACO administration about what could you do and what numbers would be

05:39:36.480 --> 05:39:43.480
sufficient and acceptable for them to feel like you could accomplish your goals. And is that correct that I get that?

05:39:43.480 --> 05:39:52.480
Yes. And so I guess my question before I ask you another question, can I move to LACO to have them to respond to that?

05:39:52.480 --> 05:40:06.480
Is that because on one of your earlier slides, you mentioned that the new projections were presented on May 5th,

05:40:06.480 --> 05:40:16.480
but you felt like that it wasn't sufficient. So I just wanted you to comment on how that compares to what Dr. Ramirez has said.

05:40:16.480 --> 05:40:29.480
Absolutely. Just to be clear, our stance has not changed. Dr. Ramirez is alluding to a conversation that happened at the airport.

05:40:29.480 --> 05:40:37.480
We worked with the school for two years. We have a relationship. But at no time did we indicate that we were approving any other fiscal

05:40:38.480 --> 05:40:49.480
It was a casual conversation. There was no promise. There was no guarantee. It was a mischaracterization of a conversation.

05:40:49.480 --> 05:40:52.480
Thank you for the clarification.

05:40:52.480 --> 05:40:54.480
May I respond to that?

05:40:54.480 --> 05:40:55.480
Yes, sir.

05:40:55.480 --> 05:41:01.480
And just to be clear, I never stated that they made any promises. That's exactly what happened. I had a conversation with him.

05:41:02.480 --> 05:41:09.480
And what I wanted to know was just because after the presentation, there was many facts or points that I didn't agree with or I felt that were misrepresentations.

05:41:09.480 --> 05:41:15.480
And so I just wanted to have that clear. What are we doing wrong? Because the idea is that they're always saying that they're partners with us.

05:41:15.480 --> 05:41:22.480
So to me, that was a conversation of partnership. What did we do wrong? How can we be better? And so the conversation was exactly right.

05:41:22.480 --> 05:41:28.480
It was a casual conversation where they provided suggestions of here are things that you could do. Here are things that you can consider.

05:41:28.480 --> 05:41:33.480
And so that's what I took it as. I did not take it as a promise. I did not take it at anything else.

05:41:33.480 --> 05:41:45.480
So part of that conversation too was this idea of then reach out to other people, reach out to the SBE, reach out to the CDE, see if they're still within this window of opportunity that there was between the ACCS and this meeting.

05:41:45.480 --> 05:41:55.480
Can you submit something new that shows that you heard what was said, that you understand the ramifications of what's going on and show them still that you have this intent to be better?

05:41:55.480 --> 05:41:59.480
And so I really appreciated those words from Dr. Brown because, again, he made no promises.

05:41:59.480 --> 05:42:07.480
But the words really resonated with me that there was an opportunity still to be better. And that's what I wanted to show you all.

05:42:07.480 --> 05:42:11.480
That's what I really went through in these past several weeks of renegotiating.

05:42:11.480 --> 05:42:17.480
I mean, the undertaking that we went to talk to everyone to renegotiate all these things, it was a huge undertaking.

05:42:17.480 --> 05:42:23.480
But we accomplished it because I took those words and I just took them to heart.

05:42:23.480 --> 05:42:31.480
And I really wanted you to understand that today is really about a commitment that we will continue to have that we have and that we've always had.

05:42:31.480 --> 05:42:33.480
So I just want you to understand that.

05:42:33.480 --> 05:42:41.480
Again, I wanted to be on record that they never made any promises, but their words mattered to me.

05:42:41.480 --> 05:42:44.480
And I just have one more follow-up question regarding the enrollment.

05:42:44.480 --> 05:42:45.480
Yes, ma'am.

05:42:45.480 --> 05:42:51.480
This is a time during the school year that schools are planning for classes for the fall.

05:42:51.480 --> 05:42:57.480
Parents are enrolling their kids, you know, as they're transferring schools or incoming students.

05:42:57.480 --> 05:43:14.480
So how many new students can you verify today that are documented paperwork filled out on the schedule to be enrolled as you're working towards the 20 or or actually the 27 to 33 students that you would need for next year?

05:43:14.480 --> 05:43:15.480
Yes, ma'am.

05:43:15.480 --> 05:43:20.480
I was told yesterday by my recruitment staff that we have seven.

05:43:20.480 --> 05:43:26.480
Now, for the past two years, the majority of our full registration happened within the last three weeks of school.

05:43:26.480 --> 05:43:29.480
That's been the trends that we've seen.

05:43:29.480 --> 05:43:37.480
So like, but I'm pushing our team to continue to because we have more than we have about 40 applications.

05:43:37.480 --> 05:43:41.480
Now they're calling them, they're talking to them, we're continuing to get more families.

05:43:41.480 --> 05:43:48.480
Now, I mean, part of the part of the struggle that we had to is that now there is this information of this possibility.

05:43:48.480 --> 05:43:50.480
So like we're we're having to overcome that as well.

05:43:50.480 --> 05:43:53.480
But with that, still, we have families who are excited.

05:43:53.480 --> 05:43:55.480
They want to be a part of our school.

05:43:55.480 --> 05:43:58.480
Parents are sharing our successes with them.

05:43:58.480 --> 05:44:09.480
So I do still feel confident if you allow us to stay open that within the last three to four weeks prior that we will reach those numbers, because that's just historically what's happened.

05:44:09.480 --> 05:44:11.480
That's all all my questions.

05:44:11.480 --> 05:44:14.480
Thank you. Thank you.

05:44:14.480 --> 05:44:19.480
Any other comments or questions?

05:44:19.480 --> 05:44:23.480
That's President Glover Woods.

05:44:23.480 --> 05:44:34.480
First, I want to say that it's apparent that TCS is making a big difference for the students and families that are attending.

05:44:34.480 --> 05:44:44.480
And Dr. Ramirez, I thank you for your passion and your commitment to the students in the school and the community that came across quite a bit in the public comment.

05:44:44.480 --> 05:44:57.480
And the increase in GPA and the motivation for students to go to school that have been disheartened by school again is quite is quite evident.

05:44:57.480 --> 05:45:15.480
And I think that's what makes this conversation such a difficult one, board members, because knowing that, but also understanding and knowing how to provide continue to provide that when the fiscal viability isn't there is is very, very challenging.

05:45:15.480 --> 05:45:24.480
And I do have to say it seems like we've been here before, almost a year ago, similar conversations.

05:45:24.480 --> 05:45:38.480
And I do truly believe that what has been shared with us is what is truly felt and what is truly believed to be the numbers are the numbers and things have gotten progressively worse.

05:45:38.480 --> 05:45:52.480
And that's I have to be very honest where my concern lies that even with the information that we've gotten thus far, there's not anything that's solid in from what I've heard.

05:45:52.480 --> 05:45:59.480
It's again anchored on hope and hope is wonderful.

05:45:59.480 --> 05:46:05.480
But again, I wonder about what service that provides to students if this hope is not realized.

05:46:05.480 --> 05:46:17.480
So being that being said, President Darling, I don't know if there are other comments before I issue a motion.

05:46:17.480 --> 05:46:21.480
But I think member Alton, you would like to be recognized.

05:46:21.480 --> 05:46:26.480
And member Yoshimoto Tari.

05:46:26.480 --> 05:46:30.480
My I actually have a question for Laco, if that's okay.

05:46:30.480 --> 05:46:31.480
Thank you.

05:46:31.480 --> 05:46:37.480
So as you're coming up, my my question.

05:46:37.480 --> 05:46:55.480
I mean, the as I said earlier, the way I see it, it's it's it's clear that the school is making a huge difference on behalf of kids and families, that people's heart are in the right place, that your hearts are in the right.

05:46:55.480 --> 05:47:00.480
I mean, like there's I feel there's lots of good intent all around.

05:47:00.480 --> 05:47:08.480
And I also felt that your your presentation of the numbers was compelling.

05:47:09.480 --> 05:47:18.480
That said, since then, we've we've received this, which is the response from Dr. Ramirez.

05:47:18.480 --> 05:47:25.480
And this is partly why I asked how deeply we go into this today versus tomorrow.

05:47:25.480 --> 05:47:34.480
But to me, the real question is, you know, are we in a position where this is not my question for you.

05:47:34.480 --> 05:47:35.480
This is my question for myself.

05:47:35.480 --> 05:47:36.480
Sorry.

05:47:36.480 --> 05:47:47.480
But, you know, as as we're deliberating, it's clear there's lots of benefit to the community, families and students and staff.

05:47:47.480 --> 05:47:50.480
It also seems clear that there's risk.

05:47:50.480 --> 05:48:03.480
And the risk is that if the school can't maintain financial solvency, there's a disaster that kids, families and staff all of a sudden are in the midst of.

05:48:03.480 --> 05:48:24.480
And so my question is, as you look at this, can you give me sort of a top line understanding of why your analysis is different than Dr. Ramirez's related to the financial projections?

05:48:24.480 --> 05:48:27.480
Thank you for the question.

05:48:27.480 --> 05:48:32.480
And I will say, you know, I appreciate the new enrollment numbers.

05:48:32.480 --> 05:48:35.480
I think that was a step in the right direction.

05:48:35.480 --> 05:48:39.480
But I think it was sort of far too little.

05:48:39.480 --> 05:48:45.480
When I'm looking at that plan, I'm still seeing an unrealistic attendance rate of 90 percent.

05:48:45.480 --> 05:48:49.480
I'm still seeing unrealistic additional revenues.

05:48:49.480 --> 05:48:58.480
Right. If you look at the actual projection that was part of that when he submitted it, the multi-year budget projection,

05:48:58.480 --> 05:49:07.480
you'll see this year for fundraising, he's booked, I want to say it's less than $2,000.

05:49:07.480 --> 05:49:12.480
Yet in subsequent years, he's booking $95,000.

05:49:12.480 --> 05:49:16.480
So there's still that unrealistic additional revenues that are in there.

05:49:16.480 --> 05:49:26.480
And then I think the real concerning piece is that the third point is really totally mischaracterizing that new lease.

05:49:26.480 --> 05:49:29.480
That new lease is not saving any money.

05:49:29.480 --> 05:49:32.480
There is no reduction in liability.

05:49:32.480 --> 05:49:38.480
It's simply a change in the way that that landlord is collecting their money.

05:49:38.480 --> 05:49:46.480
And I believe that lease was also given to you as part of those documents.

05:49:46.480 --> 05:49:55.480
And if you look at that, the landlord still is collecting $35,600 this year, $36,668 next year.

05:49:55.480 --> 05:49:59.480
And then it goes to $37,768 the following year.

05:49:59.480 --> 05:50:03.480
So he's still increasing his rent every year.

05:50:03.480 --> 05:50:14.480
What he's done is he said, yes, you only pay me $20,000 now, but I'm also going to collect some money from those subleases.

05:50:14.480 --> 05:50:21.480
So while time leadership will tell you about the reduced costs that they're paying,

05:50:21.480 --> 05:50:25.480
they're not telling you that they're also now suddenly reducing their revenue, right?

05:50:25.480 --> 05:50:29.480
Because that was being booked as revenue now that they can't book as revenue.

05:50:29.480 --> 05:50:33.480
And on top of that, they've got the taxes like they said.

05:50:33.480 --> 05:50:54.480
And then what they end up owing still, even after that sublease, is anywhere from $7,000 this year per month to $8,000 next year to finally $9,768 per month.

05:50:54.480 --> 05:50:57.480
That is just getting deferred.

05:50:57.480 --> 05:51:04.480
And so if that's the case, it ends up being well over $200,000 at the end of those two years that they owe.

05:51:04.480 --> 05:51:13.480
Even with the tax piece that Dr. Ramirez talked about, it still ends up being over $150,000.

05:51:13.480 --> 05:51:23.480
That is then suddenly, at the end of that time period, is suddenly payable in three equal monthly installments immediately at that point.

05:51:23.480 --> 05:51:37.480
And what's most concerning is that that liability of somewhere between $250,000 to $150,000 doesn't show up anywhere on those multiyear budget projections.

05:51:37.480 --> 05:51:40.480
So that liability just disappears.

05:51:40.480 --> 05:51:50.480
So again, while I appreciate the enrollment piece, you've still got the unrealistic attendance rate, you've still got the unrealistic additional revenues,

05:51:50.480 --> 05:51:55.480
and now you have this additional liability that you somehow have not booked.

05:51:55.480 --> 05:52:09.480
So we still have serious concerns with that fiscal stability plan, even that latest one that was submitted on the 5th.

05:52:10.480 --> 05:52:13.480
Thank you.

05:52:13.480 --> 05:52:21.480
So for like staff, I also want to acknowledge the family students and educators who spoke today, and these decisions are always difficult ones to have.

05:52:21.480 --> 05:52:34.480
So please know it's not a reflection, no matter what the decision on people's individual commitment, dedication, and I hope that the students I know the students will continue on their college trajectory and to continue to push themselves.

05:52:34.480 --> 05:52:54.480
I did want to be very clear about timelines, because as member Olken said, when students, particularly at this age, are at the end of a school year is a different conversation than when they're in the middle of a school year.

05:52:54.480 --> 05:53:11.480
If the board decides today to not issue a notice of intent to revoke and or tomorrow decides to

05:53:11.480 --> 05:53:26.480
make a decision tomorrow, if there's a second, if there's another chance granted, when does this, is there a timeline that stipulates when this might come back to the board if not resolved?

05:53:26.480 --> 05:53:30.480
Does that make sense?

05:53:30.480 --> 05:53:38.480
Unless the board issues another notice of violation, you probably won't see them back until renewal.

05:53:38.480 --> 05:53:42.480
Which is?

05:53:42.480 --> 05:53:48.480
When is renewal? 2026?

05:53:48.480 --> 05:53:53.480
Yeah, so I think it's 2025 or 26.

05:53:53.480 --> 05:53:57.480
Even if the fiscal situation stays as is or gets worse.

05:53:57.480 --> 05:53:59.480
Unless the state issues another notice of violation.

05:53:59.480 --> 05:54:01.480
I see.

05:54:01.480 --> 05:54:05.480
Okay, thank you.

05:54:05.480 --> 05:54:08.480
Any other comments or questions?

05:54:08.480 --> 05:54:10.480
Member Olken, you're leading in again.

05:54:10.480 --> 05:54:18.480
I felt like I ought to give Dr. Ramirez a chance to respond to the same question I asked.

05:54:18.480 --> 05:54:21.480
Ramirez?

05:54:21.480 --> 05:54:22.480
Thank you.

05:54:22.480 --> 05:54:28.480
So I guess I just want to reiterate, when I talked about, I did not misrepresent the lease.

05:54:28.480 --> 05:54:30.480
That's exactly what I had told you.

05:54:30.480 --> 05:54:36.480
The lease says very specifically that we're only liable for $20,000.

05:54:36.480 --> 05:54:40.480
And yes, I did say as well that the sublease is now the money does not come to us.

05:54:40.480 --> 05:54:42.480
It does go to the owner.

05:54:42.480 --> 05:54:44.480
So everything I said is true.

05:54:44.480 --> 05:54:47.480
There's not a misrepresentation in that.

05:54:47.480 --> 05:54:51.480
The question that you had asked is that it was the intent to provide us some space.

05:54:51.480 --> 05:54:53.480
Yes, that's what it did.

05:54:53.480 --> 05:54:59.480
Now, there is that differential that I talked about that's about $5,000 because even with the original lease,

05:54:59.480 --> 05:55:04.480
with the $12,000 that we brought in from income, it did not meet the $35,000 total.

05:55:04.480 --> 05:55:09.480
So that's where the accumulation comes of the balloon payment that comes in the third year.

05:55:09.480 --> 05:55:16.480
So that's why, again, when I mentioned this new sublease that we acquired today will help really minimize that cost

05:55:16.480 --> 05:55:23.480
so that we're only paying around $40,000 to $50,000 when we have to make that payment in the third year.

05:55:23.480 --> 05:55:31.480
Now, again, in our budget, our budget, now we do not address that balloon payment in 23, 24, 25, 26, these next two years.

05:55:31.480 --> 05:55:33.480
We address it in the third year.

05:55:33.480 --> 05:55:36.480
So the idea that it's not in our budget, that's just not true.

05:55:36.480 --> 05:55:37.480
It is in our budget.

05:55:37.480 --> 05:55:41.480
It's just in the third year when the payment needs to be made.

05:55:41.480 --> 05:55:44.480
In regards to fundraising, I also want to address that as well.

05:55:44.480 --> 05:55:48.480
So the fundraising that we're doing, time has been approved to do bingo.

05:55:48.480 --> 05:55:51.480
So we have been doing bingo now for five weeks.

05:55:51.480 --> 05:55:55.480
As you can imagine, and even for me, I didn't realize, it's a huge undertaking.

05:55:55.480 --> 05:55:57.480
It's a lot of work.

05:55:57.480 --> 05:55:59.480
We get on average about 100 people a week.

05:55:59.480 --> 05:56:04.480
I've showed those pictures to Laco so they can see that there is a desire for that.

05:56:04.480 --> 05:56:07.480
The expenses are high for the first month or two, is what I would say.

05:56:07.480 --> 05:56:09.480
I didn't realize it was that high immediately.

05:56:09.480 --> 05:56:17.480
But just so that you know, last week when we ran bingo, our profit after paying expenses was about $3,500.

05:56:17.480 --> 05:56:24.480
So when we talk about making those futures for this upcoming year of $90,000 to $100,000, yes, that's accurate.

05:56:24.480 --> 05:56:29.480
Because bingo, as we minimize our expenses, obviously then our profits go up,

05:56:29.480 --> 05:56:33.480
and then that's what we have included because to us that is a critical fundraiser

05:56:33.480 --> 05:56:39.480
that we want to utilize to continue to support our efforts so that we then can pay off our debts more quickly.

05:56:39.480 --> 05:56:42.480
And he did mention one more other thing.

05:56:48.480 --> 05:56:50.480
Thank you. I think that was very helpful.

05:56:50.480 --> 05:56:58.480
I just want to make that clear because I mean, I guess the last thing that I'll say, well first a couple of things.

05:56:58.480 --> 05:57:06.480
I mean, I do apologize for my emotional distress in this time.

05:57:06.480 --> 05:57:09.480
You know, this is a really important day.

05:57:09.480 --> 05:57:14.480
And it's not just an important day for me, it's an important day for my families, for this community.

05:57:14.480 --> 05:57:17.480
And it's something that weighs on me very heavily.

05:57:17.480 --> 05:57:20.480
You know, I'm a different kind of administrator.

05:57:20.480 --> 05:57:25.480
I could have become an administrator after my fourth or fifth year like many people do,

05:57:25.480 --> 05:57:28.480
but I didn't feel that I was adequate.

05:57:28.480 --> 05:57:31.480
I was a nationally board certified teacher after my third year.

05:57:31.480 --> 05:57:36.480
I was committed to high quality education, but I did not want to become an administrator until I felt competent.

05:57:36.480 --> 05:57:40.480
So that's why I went back to school after 14 years of teaching and being in the classroom.

05:57:40.480 --> 05:57:42.480
And I went back and I got my doctorate.

05:57:42.480 --> 05:57:47.480
And even then, after I got my doctorate, I still took a little bit of time before I entered into this,

05:57:47.480 --> 05:57:51.480
into this career of being an administrator because I wanted to do it well.

05:57:51.480 --> 05:57:55.480
I wanted to understand all the elements of it.

05:57:55.480 --> 05:57:57.480
And so that's what I believe that I've done.

05:57:57.480 --> 05:58:01.480
I believe that I've made these choices really for the betterment of families.

05:58:01.480 --> 05:58:05.480
This is not, I hate when people say to me that this is my legacy.

05:58:05.480 --> 05:58:08.480
This has never been my legacy.

05:58:08.480 --> 05:58:12.480
This has been the legacy of this community that wants something different.

05:58:12.480 --> 05:58:18.480
And the fact that I have the privilege to serve these families has really been the greatest joy for me.

05:58:18.480 --> 05:58:25.480
So when I share these numbers for you, I don't in any way do these things to misrepresent.

05:58:25.480 --> 05:58:28.480
I really fulfill wholeheartedly believe that I'm being honest.

05:58:28.480 --> 05:58:31.480
I work very closely with our back office provider.

05:58:31.480 --> 05:58:39.480
As it was mentioned in our audit, we have no findings against us because I believe that we are ethical to hold ourselves to the highest standards.

05:58:39.480 --> 05:58:47.480
I'm just asking for this opportunity to continue to meet these projected number of 82 students, which I don't believe is unachievable.

05:58:47.480 --> 05:58:50.480
So that we can continue to serve these families.

05:58:50.480 --> 05:58:59.480
And I really I hope that that as you make this decision that you take all these things into consideration, because I believe if you were to look at our budget,

05:58:59.480 --> 05:59:05.480
I believe if you were to look at these things more closely, you would see that I believe truly that that they are achievable.

05:59:05.480 --> 05:59:12.480
I mean, I'm open to even working more closely with LECO to have more feedback from them.

05:59:12.480 --> 05:59:17.480
Whatever it is that you all think that needs to be done so that so that we can meet these goals.

05:59:17.480 --> 05:59:24.480
I mean, again, we're not we're not opposed to any of those things that will help us get to where we need to be.

05:59:24.480 --> 05:59:29.480
And so thank you again. And I really appreciate your time.

05:59:29.480 --> 05:59:33.480
We really appreciate all that you have done in this school.

05:59:33.480 --> 05:59:41.480
I think many people have mentioned how important it is to offer young people the opportunities that you're offering.

05:59:42.480 --> 05:59:48.480
Are we coming back to Vice President Glover Woods? Does anybody else want to say anything?

05:59:48.480 --> 05:59:51.480
OK. Thank you, President Darlingham.

05:59:51.480 --> 05:59:55.480
And again, thank you, Dr. Ramirez and all of everyone who has called in.

05:59:55.480 --> 06:00:06.480
I believe based on the conversations we've heard, the presentations and comments that we have heard enough information

06:00:06.480 --> 06:00:16.480
that does demonstrate that the fiscal viability of the school is of grave concern and even has impact on some of the academic

06:00:16.480 --> 06:00:26.480
such as the special ed provider not providing services anymore and LECO not receiving additional student data.

06:00:26.480 --> 06:00:36.480
And for that reason, I move that we issue a notice of intent to revoke with notice of facts to time.

06:00:39.480 --> 06:00:41.480
And that concludes my motion.

06:00:43.480 --> 06:00:45.480
I will second.

06:00:45.480 --> 06:00:47.480
I will second.

06:00:49.480 --> 06:00:57.480
The notice of intent to revoke is the prelude to the hearing that then reviews all of that evidence.

06:00:57.480 --> 06:00:58.480
Yes.

06:00:58.480 --> 06:01:01.480
All right. Everyone understands the motion.

06:01:01.480 --> 06:01:05.480
So is there any further discussion before we vote?

06:01:07.480 --> 06:01:11.480
All in favor say aye.

06:01:12.480 --> 06:01:14.480
Any opposed?

06:01:14.480 --> 06:01:16.480
Any abstentions?

06:01:17.480 --> 06:01:18.480
All right.

06:01:18.480 --> 06:01:24.480
So we will have a hearing tomorrow on the evidence.

06:01:27.480 --> 06:01:28.480
Thank you.

06:01:33.480 --> 06:01:37.480
Joyless vote.

06:01:42.480 --> 06:01:46.480
We did take a break right in the middle, so I'm going to try to continue on.

06:01:46.480 --> 06:01:49.480
If you need a break, take one individually.

06:01:49.480 --> 06:01:55.480
Item 12 is the presentation of the California State Plan for Career Technical Education,

06:01:55.480 --> 06:02:01.480
which was developed to offer CTE program and pathway guidance on a regional basis.

06:02:01.480 --> 06:02:09.480
It was approved by California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee at its March 10th, 2023 meeting.

06:02:09.480 --> 06:02:11.480
This item is information only.

06:02:11.480 --> 06:02:14.480
There are no recommendations at this time.

06:02:14.480 --> 06:02:17.480
And the item will be presented by Pete Callis.

06:02:17.480 --> 06:02:21.480
Thank you, Pete, for coming twice before us today.

06:02:21.480 --> 06:02:23.480
Please begin.

06:02:25.480 --> 06:02:26.480
Thank you.

06:02:26.480 --> 06:02:27.480
Yeah, this is great.

06:02:27.480 --> 06:02:30.480
This afternoon worked out well.

06:02:33.480 --> 06:02:37.480
So we started on this journey about three years ago.

06:02:37.480 --> 06:02:43.480
In 2019, it was before I became division director for current college transition division,

06:02:43.480 --> 06:02:48.480
and we've been working with the chancellor's office in developing this plan.

06:02:48.480 --> 06:02:53.480
Normally, we develop a state plan for CTE through our Perkins federal funding,

06:02:53.480 --> 06:02:55.480
and we have that already, and that was in place.

06:02:55.480 --> 06:02:59.480
And the group at the time, before I became division director,

06:02:59.480 --> 06:03:09.480
decided that we should put together a state plan of guidance for pathway development for CTE programs across the state.

06:03:09.480 --> 06:03:16.480
And so the context of the plan is to make a difference with guidance to develop pathways on a regional level with significant changes

06:03:16.480 --> 06:03:22.480
happening with the economy and global trends that impact skills and demands in the labor market.

06:03:22.480 --> 06:03:26.480
We also wanted students to have access to multiple on ramps,

06:03:26.480 --> 06:03:33.480
post-secondary education programs and training programs that would get them into high skill and high wage careers.

06:03:33.480 --> 06:03:37.480
So that's what we were working from.

06:03:42.480 --> 06:03:48.480
The plan is strategic and sets a bold vision, key priorities and themes, short term goals and strategies,

06:03:48.480 --> 06:03:57.480
longer term goals of focus and call to action for achieving California's aims for student success and meeting employers' future workforce needs.

06:03:57.480 --> 06:04:06.480
The plan seeks to improve equity, access and outcomes across the state's diverse geography and diversity of student and worker populations.

06:04:06.480 --> 06:04:14.480
It also sets a course to align and strengthen current efforts and build on previous ones to improve and leverage CTE,

06:04:14.480 --> 06:04:21.480
including building the capacity of the field to make strategic use of current and future levels and sources of funding.

06:04:21.480 --> 06:04:29.480
The implementation phase will explore what state, regions and local actors can do to drive towards the goals of the plan.

06:04:29.480 --> 06:04:39.480
So the overview of this presentation is looking at the timeline, the structure of the California State Plan for CTE,

06:04:39.480 --> 06:04:50.480
public review and comments that we received, updates to the California State Plan and what our next steps are going to be for getting this plan out to the field.

06:04:50.480 --> 06:04:56.480
Over the implementation phase, we'll explore what the state and, as I said, the regions will work with.

06:04:56.480 --> 06:05:06.480
Over the next three years, California will aim to achieve the four main goals, which are the core of the plan and have foundation threads of equity access woven throughout.

06:05:06.480 --> 06:05:12.480
The four goals are to expand work-based learning and improve the quality of the program.

06:05:13.480 --> 06:05:21.480
We've seen now that we've got a new investment in dual enrollment across the state for us to work with our local community colleges and expand that piece.

06:05:21.480 --> 06:05:27.480
So that's a big help to this plan. Boost data-informed decision making for equity and impact.

06:05:27.480 --> 06:05:34.480
And later in the presentation, I'll do a little bit of the three main goals.

06:05:34.480 --> 06:05:44.480
I'll show you some of the data that we've been reviewing with the QAPJAC team and our leadership team at the state level with the chancellor's office.

06:05:44.480 --> 06:05:49.480
And then understand and plan to address CTE teacher and faculty shortages.

06:05:49.480 --> 06:05:58.480
We've all realized over the last few years, the shortages have become much more impactful on what we're seeing.

06:05:58.480 --> 06:06:08.480
In the last few years, the shortages have become much more impactful on what we're trying to do with our schools and deliver this education to our students.

06:06:08.480 --> 06:06:16.480
Upon review of progress in two years, the short-term goals will be revised, updated, and expanded as needed.

06:06:16.480 --> 06:06:19.480
And additional goals will be added for future progress.

06:06:19.480 --> 06:06:22.480
So we really want this plan to be fluid.

06:06:22.480 --> 06:06:30.480
We want to be able to make those changes as the economy changes, as trends change in all of our industry sectors.

06:06:30.480 --> 06:06:37.480
So we want it to be a living document and periodically revisit it and make those changes.

06:06:37.480 --> 06:06:42.480
Again, it's a guidance document, so it's not mandated for any of our LEAs to use.

06:06:42.480 --> 06:06:51.480
But we hope that as we move forward and we really start working with them at the local and regional level that they'll implement a lot of what we have in this plan.

06:06:51.480 --> 06:07:00.480
It was a phased approach. Phase one activities were including engaging stakeholders, understanding the context of what we wanted to do.

06:07:00.480 --> 06:07:07.480
We also, the chancellor's office contracted with Jobs for the Future to help us work through and develop this plan.

06:07:07.480 --> 06:07:13.480
And so they worked with us on the timeframes and drafting the state plan.

06:07:13.480 --> 06:07:19.480
We just, we worked through some study sessions with the Clapjack Group.

06:07:19.480 --> 06:07:25.480
We worked through some focus groups across the state.

06:07:25.480 --> 06:07:28.480
And that was through the Jobs for the Future Group.

06:07:28.480 --> 06:07:31.480
And they supported us through all of that work that they did.

06:07:31.480 --> 06:07:36.480
And so we wanted to be able to synthesize everything that we worked with.

06:07:36.480 --> 06:07:44.480
We brought in guest speakers from across the nation to talk to the Clapjack Group, give them input on what they did when they developed their state plans.

06:07:44.480 --> 06:07:49.480
So there's a lot of context that we put into this before we even worked on drafting the plan.

06:07:49.480 --> 06:07:54.480
Tough part was we switched over with our Clapjack members.

06:07:54.480 --> 06:07:59.480
So right in the middle of developing this, we got two new Clapjack members on our committee.

06:07:59.480 --> 06:08:04.480
So educating everybody, getting everybody up to speed took us a little bit of time.

06:08:04.480 --> 06:08:09.480
But we did work through all of the drafting of it and got it done.

06:08:09.480 --> 06:08:15.480
Phase two activities are supporting regional convenings, which will start this coming fall.

06:08:15.480 --> 06:08:19.480
We've already had letters of interest for hosting the convenings.

06:08:19.480 --> 06:08:23.480
We have more letters of interest than convenings that we're going to host.

06:08:23.480 --> 06:08:27.480
We're going to host 10 across the state going forward.

06:08:27.480 --> 06:08:31.480
We did do a public comment period.

06:08:31.480 --> 06:08:37.480
We did a 45 day, excuse me, public comment period.

06:08:37.480 --> 06:08:43.480
We did multiple email announcements to receive feedback and opportunities for feedback.

06:08:43.480 --> 06:08:52.480
The 45 day comment period, public comment period began on October 3rd, 2022, and it closed on November 17th, 2022.

06:08:52.480 --> 06:08:59.480
We dedicated a web page that was available for the public to be able to review the plan, submit comments.

06:08:59.480 --> 06:09:04.480
And we received a total of 84 individuals responding to this.

06:09:04.480 --> 06:09:08.480
We had 314 comments submitted.

06:09:08.480 --> 06:09:13.480
Once the public comment period ended, Jobs for the Future took the public comments,

06:09:13.480 --> 06:09:20.480
synthesized them into themes that they felt were part of that.

06:09:20.480 --> 06:09:24.480
And so we ended up with nine themes from the public comments.

06:09:24.480 --> 06:09:30.480
They represent a synthesis of insights, perspectives, and frequently mentioned issues.

06:09:30.480 --> 06:09:35.480
Some of the themes include tackling CTE teacher shortages and credentialing issues,

06:09:35.480 --> 06:09:40.480
addressing challenges to implementing high quality work-based learning programs,

06:09:40.480 --> 06:09:48.480
supporting sustainable funding strategies, and recognizing student leadership development, so our CTSO programs.

06:09:48.480 --> 06:09:58.480
Aligning across a wide range of sectors and stakeholders, supports and services to ensure equity for all populations,

06:09:58.480 --> 06:10:00.480
and again, expanding dual enrollment.

06:10:00.480 --> 06:10:07.480
So a lot of the public comments that we received can be used during the implementation phase

06:10:07.480 --> 06:10:12.480
by the local and regional groups that are working on their implementation plans.

06:10:12.480 --> 06:10:16.480
Since the plan was guidance, we couldn't really focus on mandating.

06:10:16.480 --> 06:10:22.480
There's a lot of comments wanting us to mandate funding sources to certain groups and subgroups,

06:10:22.480 --> 06:10:26.480
wanting us to mandate credentialing processes and requirements.

06:10:26.480 --> 06:10:29.480
And so those are the things we couldn't do.

06:10:29.480 --> 06:10:33.480
But I think the plan is comprehensive and moving forward.

06:10:33.480 --> 06:10:45.480
It'll give them a good document to move forward at the local and regional level.

06:10:45.480 --> 06:10:50.480
Sorry, I started talking and missed my slides.

06:10:50.480 --> 06:10:53.480
All right.

06:10:53.480 --> 06:10:59.480
So through the process of receiving the public comments, we looked at previous versions of it.

06:10:59.480 --> 06:11:02.480
We'd made edits for formatting and structure.

06:11:02.480 --> 06:11:06.480
We really wanted it to look as a positive plan.

06:11:06.480 --> 06:11:12.480
So we made updates to the language throughout the plan to better reflect intent as being positive.

06:11:12.480 --> 06:11:18.480
We edited the plan to better ensure applicability across the state and in any region.

06:11:18.480 --> 06:11:22.480
So very useful document.

06:11:22.480 --> 06:11:29.480
Next steps for us is to publish and announce the California State Plan for CTE support.

06:11:29.480 --> 06:11:35.480
And we wanted to bring it to you before we actually published it, along with bringing it to the Board of Governors next week

06:11:35.480 --> 06:11:39.480
so they can see what we've put together for this support.

06:11:39.480 --> 06:11:43.480
And it's really a K-14 plan. It's not a K-12 plan.

06:11:43.480 --> 06:11:52.480
It's supporting K-14 and beyond, hopefully, and building those structures down the road to work with our four-year universities.

06:11:52.480 --> 06:11:58.480
So those are our next steps is really working with them on the regional implementation.

06:11:58.480 --> 06:12:04.480
Our goal is to convene a broad range of interest holders from each region, including K-12 and post-secondary education,

06:12:04.480 --> 06:12:10.480
the private sector, workforce boards, community-based organizations in order to support the regional teams

06:12:10.480 --> 06:12:16.480
in planning for implementing and building promising practices for career technical education,

06:12:16.480 --> 06:12:22.480
support strategic alignment and activities in existing funding streams across sectors and industries,

06:12:22.480 --> 06:12:30.480
and really looking at being able to scale with the funds that they have and being able to use those funds in those regions

06:12:30.480 --> 06:12:38.480
so they can support each other in the regions, engage in peer learning, idea sharing, and knowledge exchange,

06:12:38.480 --> 06:12:46.480
and understanding that piece of it after being a high school, middle school principal for 20 years

06:12:46.480 --> 06:12:52.480
and understanding how to partner with other schools and other districts in your region

06:12:52.480 --> 06:12:56.480
and being able to scale your projects I believe makes a really big difference.

06:12:56.480 --> 06:13:03.480
And looking at data and making a difference with data and understanding that,

06:13:03.480 --> 06:13:08.480
but also looking at programs and what we decide what a good program looks like.

06:13:08.480 --> 06:13:12.480
And it could look different in every region.

06:13:12.480 --> 06:13:21.480
So some of the other pieces, as I said earlier, we do look at data and part of QAPJAC is looking at data and looking at programs.

06:13:21.480 --> 06:13:27.480
And after I came on as the division director and really working with the QAPJAC team and the CAS team,

06:13:27.480 --> 06:13:35.480
which is the community college chancellor's office along with SBE staff, we really started looking at programs.

06:13:35.480 --> 06:13:44.480
And with my experience at the high school level, I was able to look at what I did in the past with some of my programs.

06:13:44.480 --> 06:13:50.480
And these are just a few of the things that we've looked at over the past year with the QAPJAC

06:13:51.480 --> 06:13:57.480
to really dig down deeper into our data and see what we need to do to support CTE programs.

06:13:57.480 --> 06:14:04.480
So example, the California Partnership Academies, that program has been around since 1985.

06:14:04.480 --> 06:14:09.480
And it's an integrated program with really driving home students,

06:14:09.480 --> 06:14:14.480
completing their A through G requirements along with completing a pathway.

06:14:14.480 --> 06:14:17.480
Superintendent Thurman, I know he's not here right now,

06:14:17.480 --> 06:14:21.480
but we've had a number of discussions about paid student internships.

06:14:21.480 --> 06:14:25.480
We've been able to take some of our pathway, our California Partnership Academies,

06:14:25.480 --> 06:14:29.480
and drive them into paid student internships in the last five years.

06:14:29.480 --> 06:14:33.480
And we've grown those. And I have an example coming up.

06:14:33.480 --> 06:14:37.480
Youth apprenticeships, our middle school foundation academies.

06:14:37.480 --> 06:14:45.480
I started that in 17, 18, and we were actually funding 14 middle school academies a year.

06:14:45.480 --> 06:14:49.480
And those academies feed into their feeder high schools into those pathways.

06:14:49.480 --> 06:14:54.480
And that was our goal. So currently we have about 60 middle school academies.

06:14:54.480 --> 06:15:02.480
And I've got some really nice information and things that have happened with those academies in the past couple years.

06:15:02.480 --> 06:15:06.480
And then CTE data review, we've been looking at high school graduation rates.

06:15:06.480 --> 06:15:14.480
And the other key piece that we weren't sure about, but we started looking at is attendance rates for our CTE students.

06:15:14.480 --> 06:15:24.480
And does CTE make a difference for getting students to school and getting them in school and staying in school?

06:15:24.480 --> 06:15:27.480
Again, our CPAs started in 1985.

06:15:27.480 --> 06:15:33.480
Academy components include rigorous academic and career technical education with a career focus,

06:15:33.480 --> 06:15:38.480
a committed team of teachers, and active business and post-secondary partners.

06:15:38.480 --> 06:15:44.480
So looking at the 400 academies, we invest about $30 million a year in the academies.

06:15:44.480 --> 06:15:49.480
Ten of our academies currently are multi-craft core curriculum, pre-apprenticeship CPAs.

06:15:49.480 --> 06:15:57.480
So basically they're construction based academies supporting those students into getting into an apprenticeship when they graduate from this academy.

06:15:57.480 --> 06:16:04.480
We have 18 clean technology and renewable energy academies currently, along with the student internships.

06:16:04.480 --> 06:16:10.480
Our middle school foundation academies, as I said, I started those in 2017-18.

06:16:10.480 --> 06:16:18.480
We fund them at about a million dollars a year, $25,000 for a planning grant and $50,000 for implementation grants.

06:16:18.480 --> 06:16:24.480
They feed into their high school pathways, their high school CTE pathways.

06:16:24.480 --> 06:16:29.480
We started out at funding 10 a year, we're up to 14 a year right now.

06:16:29.480 --> 06:16:35.480
Our youth apprenticeship and apprenticeship programs is expanding and it's expanded in the past year.

06:16:35.480 --> 06:16:40.480
We've been working closely with the Division of Apprenticeship Standards to build that out.

06:16:40.480 --> 06:16:44.480
I have a phenomenal arts, media, and entertainment consultant that works for me.

06:16:44.480 --> 06:16:49.480
She has taken this to the next level with apprenticeship work. She's amazing.

06:16:49.480 --> 06:16:54.480
Allison Frenzel. I talked about the student internship piece.

06:16:55.480 --> 06:17:01.480
I visited Coachella Valley. We have a number of California Partnership Academies there.

06:17:01.480 --> 06:17:06.480
At Coachella Valley High School, we have a Hospitality, Tourism, and Recreation Partnership Academy.

06:17:06.480 --> 06:17:10.480
They originally partnered with two of the Marriott Resorts in Palm Desert.

06:17:10.480 --> 06:17:18.480
They started out 11th graders due to some job shadowing and 12th graders are supposed to do an internship.

06:17:18.480 --> 06:17:22.480
This is where our paid internship program started at Coachella Valley.

06:17:22.480 --> 06:17:29.480
They're up to five resorts in Coachella. We've worked with the HR manager at one of the resorts

06:17:29.480 --> 06:17:35.480
and we've actually been able to expand it to 20 resorts in Southern California now and not just Marriott.

06:17:35.480 --> 06:17:38.480
So we've been able to build that out.

06:17:38.480 --> 06:17:43.480
The paid internships, I actually got to meet some of the students this year when I did the visit.

06:17:43.480 --> 06:17:48.480
They were really excited about what they were doing and they get to do different parts of the resort.

06:17:48.480 --> 06:17:52.480
They do front desk, they do accounting, they do culinary arts.

06:17:52.480 --> 06:17:57.480
So they get at least five choices of rotations throughout the year.

06:17:57.480 --> 06:18:03.480
We actually met one that had already graduated from high school and she'd come back to do a visit the day we were there

06:18:03.480 --> 06:18:08.480
and she had just finished college and Marriott had just offered her a job.

06:18:08.480 --> 06:18:14.480
And the other thing they're doing is they let them do summer work full-time as an internship,

06:18:14.480 --> 06:18:20.480
but also if they're going away to college, they will set them up with a resort wherever they're going to college

06:18:20.480 --> 06:18:26.480
to continue to work in this field if that's their field of choice.

06:18:26.480 --> 06:18:33.480
The Middle School Foundation Academies, Windsor Middle School, Guy Fieri's son was a seventh grader

06:18:33.480 --> 06:18:37.480
when they received their first grant from us.

06:18:38.480 --> 06:18:45.480
Guy Fieri matched the grant of $25,000 that year as a startup grant for planning.

06:18:45.480 --> 06:18:50.480
And then he kicked in another $10,000 in 2021 to expand it even more.

06:18:50.480 --> 06:18:54.480
So they're partnering with Windsor High School's Vineyard Program

06:18:54.480 --> 06:18:59.480
and so they're building out this entire culinary program with winemaking at the high school

06:18:59.480 --> 06:19:03.480
and then the culinary builds from the middle school and feeds into the high school.

06:19:03.480 --> 06:19:07.480
So that's just one of the examples that has happened.

06:19:07.480 --> 06:19:13.480
We had three girls, a sixth grader and two seventh grade girls,

06:19:13.480 --> 06:19:22.480
go to the SkillsUSA national competition and they got three first places in engineering.

06:19:22.480 --> 06:19:27.480
And it was based on what they learned from the academy that their teachers developed at their middle school.

06:19:27.480 --> 06:19:30.480
So we're doing some really nice things for them.

06:19:30.480 --> 06:19:35.480
They're really understanding pathways and how it can make a difference from them starting in the middle school.

06:19:35.480 --> 06:19:43.480
Apprenticeships, as I said, we started the pre-apprenticeship program with a multi-craft core program in the building trades.

06:19:43.480 --> 06:19:50.480
Actually, Superintendent Thurman last two weeks ago was at a high school here in South Sacramento

06:19:50.480 --> 06:19:55.480
and we had a build design competition and it was middle schools and high schools.

06:19:55.480 --> 06:20:00.480
And he actually went out and participated and worked with the students for a bit that day,

06:20:00.480 --> 06:20:06.480
rolled the sleeves up, cut some wood with a saw and did some really cool things with them.

06:20:06.480 --> 06:20:12.480
And so he got to experience what these students are experiencing in these programs.

06:20:12.480 --> 06:20:16.480
Allison, with our arts, media and entertainment,

06:20:16.480 --> 06:20:21.480
she currently has 28 schools or districts developing youth apprenticeship programs.

06:20:21.480 --> 06:20:26.480
Three of the key districts are Inglewood, Compton and Cincinnati.

06:20:26.480 --> 06:20:33.480
Our industry partners range from DreamWorks, Epic Sports, Warner Brothers, Paramount and Netflix.

06:20:33.480 --> 06:20:37.480
I asked her for a little bit of information for the president.

06:20:37.480 --> 06:20:43.480
She sent me 20 text messages with lists of all of our business partners that we're working with.

06:20:43.480 --> 06:20:49.480
Right now, in the past year, they've been able to secure about $12 million.

06:20:49.480 --> 06:20:53.480
And it's not all for high school students. It's 18 and over also.

06:20:53.480 --> 06:20:58.480
And so they're working with community colleges in these regions where these high schools are located

06:20:58.480 --> 06:21:02.480
and they're partnering with the community colleges on the apprenticeship programs.

06:21:06.480 --> 06:21:11.480
So this is some of the data that we've looked at with our QAPTC committee members.

06:21:12.480 --> 06:21:15.480
Graduation rates. You can see all students.

06:21:15.480 --> 06:21:20.480
This is the cohort from the 2019-2020 graduating class.

06:21:20.480 --> 06:21:28.480
491 students overall. Their high school graduation rate was 84.2% overall.

06:21:28.480 --> 06:21:33.480
This is students that completed one course in CTE.

06:21:33.480 --> 06:21:39.480
And you can see down at the bottom, those students, their graduation rate was 90.8.

06:21:39.480 --> 06:21:43.480
So a bit higher than the overall cohort.

06:21:43.480 --> 06:21:46.480
We also looked at students that completed a pathway.

06:21:46.480 --> 06:21:51.480
And their graduation rate for that cohort was 97%.

06:21:51.480 --> 06:21:54.480
So they're staying in school. They're doing the right thing.

06:21:54.480 --> 06:21:58.480
And we're making a difference with our CTE programs.

06:21:58.480 --> 06:22:04.480
Again, this is the similar data just in a different table.

06:22:04.480 --> 06:22:09.480
Then we asked them to look at by gender.

06:22:09.480 --> 06:22:13.480
And the numbers are pretty much the same by gender also.

06:22:13.480 --> 06:22:19.480
They improve as they either take a CTE course or a dabbler.

06:22:19.480 --> 06:22:21.480
And I don't know if some of you know what a dabbler is,

06:22:21.480 --> 06:22:25.480
which I thought was some different term that somebody made up.

06:22:25.480 --> 06:22:28.480
But it's actually in the Perkins language.

06:22:28.480 --> 06:22:33.480
A dabbler is a student that takes two CTE courses that are unrelated

06:22:33.480 --> 06:22:36.480
in different pathways or different industry sectors.

06:22:36.480 --> 06:22:38.480
So that's a dabbler.

06:22:38.480 --> 06:22:42.480
And our completers are ones that finish at least two to complete a pathway.

06:22:42.480 --> 06:22:49.480
But as you can see, their attendance rates are much higher when they're taking the CTE courses.

06:22:49.480 --> 06:22:52.480
Then we broke it also down. I had our data team.

06:22:52.480 --> 06:22:54.480
And we've been working closely with the AMAR data team.

06:22:54.480 --> 06:22:59.480
We meet once a week with four of them in my CTE team.

06:22:59.480 --> 06:23:01.480
And so we looked at data.

06:23:01.480 --> 06:23:03.480
And I asked them to look at attendance.

06:23:03.480 --> 06:23:05.480
And they're like, are you sure you want to look at attendance?

06:23:05.480 --> 06:23:06.480
And I said, let's try it.

06:23:06.480 --> 06:23:09.480
I mean, there's got to be something there that,

06:23:09.480 --> 06:23:12.480
and everything that we've looked at thus far with attendance,

06:23:12.480 --> 06:23:15.480
no matter how we look at the different groups,

06:23:15.480 --> 06:23:21.480
it's all been positive improvements in attendance.

06:23:21.480 --> 06:23:27.480
Also socioeconomic, we looked at that piece, same thing.

06:23:27.480 --> 06:23:33.480
And then I asked them to look at regions and how things are based on the region.

06:23:33.480 --> 06:23:35.480
You can see in the far right hand column,

06:23:35.480 --> 06:23:42.480
the CTE completers are all above 96 percent in their attendance rate.

06:23:42.480 --> 06:23:48.480
And then the bottom just shows you which region, which counties are in each region.

06:23:48.480 --> 06:23:51.480
And then I also looked at industry sectors.

06:23:51.480 --> 06:23:53.480
They're all doing well.

06:23:53.480 --> 06:23:56.480
It doesn't matter which industry sector you look at,

06:23:56.480 --> 06:24:04.480
their attendance rates are almost 95 percent and above all the way across the board.

06:24:04.480 --> 06:24:06.480
That's what's going on with CTE.

06:24:06.480 --> 06:24:08.480
That's our plan that we developed.

06:24:08.480 --> 06:24:10.480
We want to take it to that next step.

06:24:10.480 --> 06:24:13.480
We wanted you to be aware of what we were working on

06:24:13.480 --> 06:24:20.480
and really some positive pieces that we see in California happening right now

06:24:20.480 --> 06:24:21.480
and taking it to the next level.

06:24:21.480 --> 06:24:25.480
We just got done with our federal review of our Perkins program.

06:24:25.480 --> 06:24:29.480
The last time we had a review was about six years ago and we had seven findings.

06:24:29.480 --> 06:24:33.480
This time we're not sure if we even have one finding.

06:24:33.480 --> 06:24:35.480
And if there's one finding, it's going to be a positive,

06:24:35.480 --> 06:24:39.480
it's going to have a positive impact across the state for students.

06:24:39.480 --> 06:24:46.480
So their only concern was that they were wondering when I was going to retire.

06:24:46.480 --> 06:24:49.480
Because we've made some really good impacts in the last two years

06:24:49.480 --> 06:24:51.480
and made some positive changes.

06:24:51.480 --> 06:24:57.480
So we just want to continue this work and make a difference.

06:24:57.480 --> 06:24:59.480
Thank you so much.

06:24:59.480 --> 06:25:02.480
And we've got the public comment slide up.

06:25:02.480 --> 06:25:06.480
So members of the public who would like to call in and comment

06:25:06.480 --> 06:25:10.480
can do so by calling the number on the slide and using the access code.

06:25:10.480 --> 06:25:13.480
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call in,

06:25:13.480 --> 06:25:17.480
I want to ask our liaison member, Rodriguez, if she has some initial comments.

06:25:18.480 --> 06:25:19.480
Sure. Thank you.

06:25:19.480 --> 06:25:24.480
And thank you so much, Mr. Callas, for that wonderful presentation

06:25:24.480 --> 06:25:31.480
and what you're talking about, I see manifesting at my high school

06:25:31.480 --> 06:25:36.480
that transformation that occurs with our programs.

06:25:36.480 --> 06:25:39.480
So thank you for all your hard work with that.

06:25:39.480 --> 06:25:43.480
Just a few comments.

06:25:43.480 --> 06:25:47.480
The California Workforce Pathways Joint Advisory Committee,

06:25:47.480 --> 06:25:51.480
QAPJAC, that Pete just mentioned, consists of three members

06:25:51.480 --> 06:25:55.480
of the California Community College Board of Governors

06:25:55.480 --> 06:25:59.480
and three members of the State Board and an ex-officio member.

06:25:59.480 --> 06:26:03.480
The committee typically meets quarterly to address systems alignment,

06:26:03.480 --> 06:26:09.480
policies specific to career pathways within the context of recent

06:26:09.480 --> 06:26:12.480
and future state and federal investments.

06:26:12.480 --> 06:26:14.480
So our last meeting was March 10th.

06:26:14.480 --> 06:26:19.480
We met the day right after our state board meeting

06:26:19.480 --> 06:26:24.480
and heard a presentation by the CDE and Jobs for the Future

06:26:24.480 --> 06:26:28.480
on the final draft of the state plan that you just saw

06:26:28.480 --> 06:26:31.480
and for career technical education.

06:26:31.480 --> 06:26:34.480
After the presentation, the committee voted to approve

06:26:34.480 --> 06:26:40.480
the California State Plan for career technical education.

06:26:40.480 --> 06:26:43.480
The CDE also presented an informational item

06:26:43.480 --> 06:26:46.480
on career technical education incentive grant,

06:26:46.480 --> 06:26:49.480
the CTAAG data matrix.

06:26:49.480 --> 06:26:53.480
The data highlighted, as we just saw, the positive impact

06:26:53.480 --> 06:26:56.480
that career technical education has on student attendance.

06:26:56.480 --> 06:27:00.480
And I immediately shared all of that data with my,

06:27:00.480 --> 06:27:05.480
with our administrators because we're, we get very excited

06:27:05.480 --> 06:27:08.480
and they were like, well, obvious because they've seen,

06:27:08.480 --> 06:27:10.480
they've seen what we're talking about.

06:27:10.480 --> 06:27:14.480
The next QAPTC meeting is scheduled for May 25th

06:27:14.480 --> 06:27:18.480
and the agenda includes updates on the state plan

06:27:18.480 --> 06:27:22.480
for career technical education, CTAAG data matrix,

06:27:22.480 --> 06:27:26.480
and the K-12 Strong Workforce Program Dashboard,

06:27:26.480 --> 06:27:30.480
which examines CTE engagement and completion for students

06:27:30.480 --> 06:27:35.480
at institutions awarded round one K-12 SWP funding

06:27:35.480 --> 06:27:39.480
for the school years 18-19 and 19-20.

06:27:39.480 --> 06:27:44.480
And that concludes my report.

06:27:44.480 --> 06:27:50.480
If there are commenters who are in person or on the phone,

06:27:50.480 --> 06:27:57.480
I think I see someone in person.

06:27:57.480 --> 06:28:02.480
Turn on your microphone, please.

06:28:02.480 --> 06:28:04.480
Okay. Sorry about that.

06:28:04.480 --> 06:28:05.480
Good afternoon.

06:28:05.480 --> 06:28:08.480
LeAngela Reed on behalf of the, of KROP,

06:28:08.480 --> 06:28:11.480
the Association of Career and College Readiness Organizations.

06:28:11.480 --> 06:28:14.480
We're very excited about the plan.

06:28:14.480 --> 06:28:17.480
I know in the interest of time you want to focus on key things,

06:28:17.480 --> 06:28:20.480
but I will say that the large, the largest group of students

06:28:20.480 --> 06:28:23.480
participating in these CTE programs are in our ROPs,

06:28:23.480 --> 06:28:25.480
do have the highest graduation rate.

06:28:25.480 --> 06:28:29.480
These programs are working and we support, we appreciate

06:28:29.480 --> 06:28:32.480
the work of the department, the support of the governor

06:28:32.480 --> 06:28:34.480
and this board of our programs.

06:28:34.480 --> 06:28:36.480
They're working and even during COVID,

06:28:36.480 --> 06:28:38.480
they were what kept kids together.

06:28:38.480 --> 06:28:42.480
So thank you.

06:28:42.480 --> 06:28:45.480
And is there any telephone comment?

06:28:45.480 --> 06:28:47.480
There are no callers in the queue.

06:28:47.480 --> 06:28:49.480
Okay.

06:28:49.480 --> 06:28:53.480
So this is really just an information item,

06:28:53.480 --> 06:28:56.480
and we want to open up for board discussion.

06:28:56.480 --> 06:29:01.480
Any questions, thoughts, comments?

06:29:01.480 --> 06:29:04.480
Member Yoshimoto-Towry?

06:29:04.480 --> 06:29:06.480
Just briefly.

06:29:06.480 --> 06:29:07.480
Thank you.

06:29:07.480 --> 06:29:09.480
In my experience, I've seen higher graduation rates,

06:29:09.480 --> 06:29:11.480
higher attendance with this work,

06:29:11.480 --> 06:29:13.480
and it makes learning really come alive.

06:29:13.480 --> 06:29:16.480
Question, I've got to, first of all, thank you.

06:29:16.480 --> 06:29:18.480
The state plan is really exciting.

06:29:18.480 --> 06:29:21.480
I think it's exciting to have a comprehensive guide for the state

06:29:21.480 --> 06:29:25.480
that includes regional and local CTE work

06:29:25.480 --> 06:29:27.480
and integrates state funding programs.

06:29:27.480 --> 06:29:31.480
Question about Golden State Pathway programs.

06:29:31.480 --> 06:29:35.480
I see a lot of dual enrollment in the draft plan,

06:29:35.480 --> 06:29:39.480
but I was searching for Golden State Pathways program.

06:29:39.480 --> 06:29:42.480
Can you talk a little bit about that, please?

06:29:42.480 --> 06:29:45.480
Yes.

06:29:45.480 --> 06:29:47.480
So Golden State Pathways is not,

06:29:47.480 --> 06:29:50.480
this was strictly for CTE today, right?

06:29:50.480 --> 06:29:53.480
And so that's why I didn't bring up Golden State Pathways,

06:29:53.480 --> 06:29:56.480
because Golden State Pathways, you can develop pathways

06:29:56.480 --> 06:29:59.480
outside of CTE programs or in CTE programs,

06:29:59.480 --> 06:30:01.480
so it's available for both.

06:30:01.480 --> 06:30:03.480
We're working on that rollout.

06:30:03.480 --> 06:30:08.480
We are working on a, we worked on a framework for the pathways,

06:30:08.480 --> 06:30:11.480
and so I have people in the field reviewing the framework

06:30:11.480 --> 06:30:13.480
right now to get feedback from them,

06:30:13.480 --> 06:30:16.480
and once that's done, then we can move forward

06:30:16.480 --> 06:30:18.480
with getting our RFAs out

06:30:18.480 --> 06:30:22.480
for the Golden State Pathways program.

06:30:22.480 --> 06:30:25.480
I think because it's available within,

06:30:25.480 --> 06:30:28.480
because it's available within the CTE pathways

06:30:28.480 --> 06:30:33.480
and also without, I think there's some, there's overlap,

06:30:33.480 --> 06:30:38.480
and perhaps there's a way to, I don't know,

06:30:38.480 --> 06:30:42.480
get feedback on that from additional stakeholders.

06:30:42.480 --> 06:30:46.480
I'd love to follow up and just ask a question about that.

06:30:46.480 --> 06:30:50.480
What does it mean to be inside the CTE pathways

06:30:50.480 --> 06:30:55.480
or not inside in the sense that the existing pathways

06:30:55.480 --> 06:30:59.480
that, you know, like linked learning or something,

06:30:59.480 --> 06:31:02.480
are all career-oriented,

06:31:02.480 --> 06:31:04.480
but are there some career-oriented programs

06:31:04.480 --> 06:31:07.480
that are not considered part of CTE?

06:31:07.480 --> 06:31:10.480
They wouldn't be part of any of the industry sectors.

06:31:10.480 --> 06:31:12.480
Well, they're in industry sectors.

06:31:12.480 --> 06:31:13.480
I understand.

06:31:13.480 --> 06:31:16.480
So the CTE pathways,

06:31:16.480 --> 06:31:19.480
we have our model curriculum standards for CTE,

06:31:19.480 --> 06:31:24.480
and so that's what they follow when we're doing a CTE pathway.

06:31:24.480 --> 06:31:25.480
So when we built out,

06:31:25.480 --> 06:31:28.480
when we worked on this framework for Golden State Pathways,

06:31:28.480 --> 06:31:32.480
we made it more general than just CTE

06:31:32.480 --> 06:31:36.480
and how we built CTE pathways.

06:31:36.480 --> 06:31:39.480
I probably should not use our time at this hour

06:31:39.480 --> 06:31:40.480
to get deep into that,

06:31:40.480 --> 06:31:43.480
but I will want to follow up and understand that more fully,

06:31:43.480 --> 06:31:45.480
because my understanding of the existing,

06:31:45.480 --> 06:31:47.480
the ones that came from the pathways program earlier

06:31:47.480 --> 06:31:50.480
was that they're all in industry sectors.

06:31:50.480 --> 06:31:52.480
There's 600 pathways in the state,

06:31:52.480 --> 06:31:56.480
and they have business partnerships and so on and so forth.

06:31:56.480 --> 06:32:01.480
The layperson, like myself, would think that that was part of CTE.

06:32:01.480 --> 06:32:04.480
And you're saying there's a thing that we're calling CTE

06:32:04.480 --> 06:32:09.480
that is not the big global umbrella that I'm using,

06:32:09.480 --> 06:32:13.480
but is a specific programmatic approach.

06:32:13.480 --> 06:32:16.480
Is that accurate?

06:32:16.480 --> 06:32:18.480
That has certain...

06:32:18.480 --> 06:32:22.480
CTE would be under the global umbrella of pathways.

06:32:22.480 --> 06:32:25.480
And pathways would be under the global umbrella of CTE,

06:32:25.480 --> 06:32:28.480
is what I'm asking.

06:32:28.480 --> 06:32:29.480
Yes.

06:32:29.480 --> 06:32:30.480
All right.

06:32:30.480 --> 06:32:32.480
Well, actually, when we're not exhausted,

06:32:32.480 --> 06:32:34.480
we'll go into that in another time

06:32:34.480 --> 06:32:36.480
and try to understand the differentials.

06:32:36.480 --> 06:32:39.480
But to member Yoshimoto-Tabri's point,

06:32:39.480 --> 06:32:41.480
I think we would love to see in the state plan

06:32:41.480 --> 06:32:43.480
how this all fits together,

06:32:43.480 --> 06:32:46.480
so we really do have an overview.

06:32:46.480 --> 06:32:48.480
And I'm thrilled about the data,

06:32:48.480 --> 06:32:52.480
because we do know that when kids are applying their knowledge

06:32:52.480 --> 06:32:55.480
and they're getting a chance to really do things that are meaningful,

06:32:55.480 --> 06:32:57.480
they want to come to school.

06:32:57.480 --> 06:33:00.480
And they do well, so I appreciate that.

06:33:00.480 --> 06:33:02.480
You're aggregating that.

06:33:02.480 --> 06:33:06.480
Any other questions or comments?

06:33:06.480 --> 06:33:07.480
All right.

06:33:07.480 --> 06:33:09.480
Well, we really appreciate seeing you twice today

06:33:09.480 --> 06:33:12.480
and getting this wonderful report.

06:33:12.480 --> 06:33:13.480
Thank you.

06:33:13.480 --> 06:33:19.480
And we're going to go on to reopen item one

06:33:19.480 --> 06:33:23.480
and take action on the preliminary report of actions

06:33:23.480 --> 06:33:26.480
draft March 2023 meeting minutes

06:33:26.480 --> 06:33:30.480
to take up revisions to the terms for two March 2023 appointments

06:33:30.480 --> 06:33:33.480
to advisory commission on special education.

06:33:33.480 --> 06:33:36.480
And then I will say, depending on what time we're at,

06:33:36.480 --> 06:33:40.480
we can then do liaison assignments or we can do them tomorrow.

06:33:40.480 --> 06:33:43.480
I think this will probably go pretty quickly, right?

06:33:43.480 --> 06:33:46.480
While we're waiting for any members of the public to call in,

06:33:46.480 --> 06:33:48.480
do I have a motion from a board member

06:33:48.480 --> 06:33:52.480
to approve the March 2023 State Board of Education

06:33:52.480 --> 06:33:56.480
draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

06:33:56.480 --> 06:34:00.480
Okay, we have member Rodriguez motioning

06:34:00.480 --> 06:34:03.480
and member Orozco-Gonzalez seconding.

06:34:03.480 --> 06:34:04.480
Thank you.

06:34:04.480 --> 06:34:06.480
And is there any public comment?

06:34:06.480 --> 06:34:08.480
There is no public comment.

06:34:08.480 --> 06:34:10.480
Is there any further discussion?

06:34:10.480 --> 06:34:11.480
All right.

06:34:11.480 --> 06:34:14.480
For all in favor of approving our minutes.

06:34:14.480 --> 06:34:15.480
Aye.

06:34:15.480 --> 06:34:16.480
Any opposed?

06:34:16.480 --> 06:34:17.480
Say nay.

06:34:17.480 --> 06:34:19.480
Any abstentions?

06:34:19.480 --> 06:34:22.480
All right.

06:34:22.480 --> 06:34:24.480
That motion is approved.

06:34:24.480 --> 06:34:28.480
And now we want to move on to Vice President Glover-Woods

06:34:28.480 --> 06:34:30.480
who as chair of the SBE screening committee

06:34:30.480 --> 06:34:34.480
will present the committee's recommendations for the revisions

06:34:34.480 --> 06:34:38.480
to March 2023 appointments to the ACSE,

06:34:38.480 --> 06:34:41.480
the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

06:34:41.480 --> 06:34:42.480
Thank you.

06:34:42.480 --> 06:34:43.480
So at our left.

06:34:43.480 --> 06:34:47.480
I didn't do public comment on my phone, did I?

06:34:47.480 --> 06:34:49.480
Yeah, we didn't have any.

06:34:49.480 --> 06:34:50.480
We didn't have any, okay.

06:34:50.480 --> 06:34:55.480
So let me show you.

06:34:55.480 --> 06:34:59.480
No, I'm saying we did the slide up before.

06:34:59.480 --> 06:35:03.480
That way we'll have public comment again.

06:35:03.480 --> 06:35:08.480
We're at the end of the day.

06:35:08.480 --> 06:35:09.480
We're getting a little.

06:35:09.480 --> 06:35:13.480
All right.

06:35:13.480 --> 06:35:16.480
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:35:16.480 --> 06:35:19.480
Well, at our last meeting in March,

06:35:19.480 --> 06:35:28.480
we approved four-year terms for two people who were appointed to the ACSE.

06:35:29.480 --> 06:35:35.480
And because they're taking over,

06:35:35.480 --> 06:35:38.480
they're taking over for previous incumbents,

06:35:38.480 --> 06:35:44.480
we need to make an adjustment from a four-year term to a two-year term for them.

06:35:44.480 --> 06:35:53.480
So I move that we adjust the terms for Russell Michoud and Matthew Wilkins

06:35:53.480 --> 06:35:58.480
so that their term ends December 31st, 2024,

06:35:58.480 --> 06:36:01.480
as opposed to I believe it was 2026.

06:36:01.480 --> 06:36:04.480
So we just need to make that adjustment.

06:36:04.480 --> 06:36:08.480
And I believe I made a comment and a motion at the same time.

06:36:08.480 --> 06:36:11.480
Okay, so I think we'll come back for the motion.

06:36:11.480 --> 06:36:12.480
We'll take the comment.

06:36:12.480 --> 06:36:14.480
We'll see if there's any public comment.

06:36:14.480 --> 06:36:20.480
We're trying to triple multitask here.

06:36:20.480 --> 06:36:22.480
If you have a public comment,

06:36:22.480 --> 06:36:28.480
please call into the number shown on the screen with the participant access code shown there.

06:36:28.480 --> 06:36:36.480
And we'll take a moment to see if there's anyone who has public comment on this item.

06:36:36.480 --> 06:36:37.480
All right.

06:36:37.480 --> 06:36:41.480
Seeing that there is no public comment, I am open to a motion.

06:36:41.480 --> 06:36:43.480
Thank you.

06:36:44.480 --> 06:36:51.480
I move that we make revisions to the terms for the two March 2023 appointments

06:36:51.480 --> 06:36:53.480
to the Advisory Commission on Special Education,

06:36:53.480 --> 06:36:58.480
and that would be for Russell Michoud and Matthew Wilkins adjusting their terms

06:36:58.480 --> 06:37:06.480
so that it ends December 31st, 2024.

06:37:06.480 --> 06:37:07.480
Thank you.

06:37:07.480 --> 06:37:08.480
Thank you very much.

06:37:08.480 --> 06:37:11.480
Member Rodriguez, all in favor say aye.

06:37:11.480 --> 06:37:12.480
Aye.

06:37:12.480 --> 06:37:14.480
Any opposed say nay.

06:37:14.480 --> 06:37:15.480
Any abstentions?

06:37:15.480 --> 06:37:17.480
Motion passes.

06:37:17.480 --> 06:37:21.480
So that was very efficient.

06:37:21.480 --> 06:37:25.480
Let us go to our board member liaison reports.

06:37:25.480 --> 06:37:31.480
And we're going to report out on liaison activities that are not related to any items on our May agenda.

06:37:31.480 --> 06:37:36.480
And we'll start with member Escobedo.

06:37:36.480 --> 06:37:44.480
I'd like to report as part of my role in the liaison for NASVY on April 25th,

06:37:44.480 --> 06:37:58.480
I was part of a webinar for they had partners with NCSL, NGA, and CCSSO.

06:37:58.480 --> 06:38:01.480
We hosted a webinar with Dr. Manna.

06:38:01.480 --> 06:38:10.480
And our focus of the webinar is how to create state policy with state boards and universities

06:38:10.480 --> 06:38:16.480
and local districts in support of creating high quality principles.

06:38:16.480 --> 06:38:22.480
So I shared our experience when I was superintendent,

06:38:22.480 --> 06:38:29.480
what we do also here in California in creating these assessments that are connected to the work.

06:38:30.480 --> 06:38:39.480
Cal APAs and we're great interactions from many states that want to duplicate what we're doing in California

06:38:39.480 --> 06:38:47.480
creating leaders that can enhance culture, that can enhance collaboration with teachers.

06:38:47.480 --> 06:38:50.480
So it was very well attended.

06:38:51.480 --> 06:39:02.480
And again, I just want to share that October is our annual NASVY conference

06:39:02.480 --> 06:39:09.480
and hopefully everyone will be able to make it here, all my colleagues.

06:39:09.480 --> 06:39:16.480
Secondly, last week I attended the regional English learner meeting

06:39:16.480 --> 06:39:23.480
and had a great conversation with our regional English learner specialist.

06:39:23.480 --> 06:39:32.480
And as they work with districts especially in the implementation of designated and integrated ELD

06:39:32.480 --> 06:39:36.480
and so they all were sharing and supporting one another.

06:39:36.480 --> 06:39:43.480
One specific topic was of great interest is the long-term English learner community of practice

06:39:43.480 --> 06:39:53.480
that California Department of Education along with the Sobrato Excellence in Teaching at Stanford,

06:39:53.480 --> 06:39:59.480
they're establishing a community of practice that will meet over 24 months.

06:39:59.480 --> 06:40:04.480
The first meeting is going to be I believe at the end of May

06:40:04.480 --> 06:40:12.480
and the goal is to increase awareness of long-term English learners in the high school arena 9 through 12.

06:40:12.480 --> 06:40:16.480
They're going to engage in professional learning, improve data literacy,

06:40:16.480 --> 06:40:25.480
use data to identify specific pain points that LTELs are experiencing in the high school

06:40:25.480 --> 06:40:29.480
and they're going to try to encourage innovation.

06:40:29.480 --> 06:40:37.480
I think we heard in a previous talk that LTELs sometimes are tracked, right?

06:40:37.480 --> 06:40:43.480
So and they never get to be exposed to A through G courses.

06:40:43.480 --> 06:40:46.480
Well, this community of practice is going to be a little bit innovative

06:40:46.480 --> 06:40:53.480
and see how can we reimagine how LTELs are educated in high school.

06:40:53.480 --> 06:41:04.480
So I look forward to those findings and to hear what they'll uncover in this community of practice

06:41:04.480 --> 06:41:08.480
and to help them for the next couple of years.

06:41:08.480 --> 06:41:10.480
Thank you.

06:41:10.480 --> 06:41:13.480
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:41:13.480 --> 06:41:14.480
Thank you.

06:41:14.480 --> 06:41:18.480
First, I'd like to share about a few things that have happened with CCEE

06:41:18.480 --> 06:41:22.480
or the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

06:41:22.480 --> 06:41:25.480
They are just cooking with gas, if you will.

06:41:25.480 --> 06:41:33.480
Executive Director Matt Novo and all of the staff there are just really doing some things to keep our supports in place

06:41:33.480 --> 06:41:35.480
for our LEAs and educators.

06:41:35.480 --> 06:41:39.480
There was a convening for the statewide system of support,

06:41:39.480 --> 06:41:45.480
which I know we all know is a critical piece to the accountability and continuous improvement system.

06:41:45.480 --> 06:41:50.480
They were able to hold that convening first since really we closed with the pandemic,

06:41:50.480 --> 06:41:59.480
and that was done on May 8 in collaboration with CCEE, CDE, county offices and whatnot.

06:41:59.480 --> 06:42:08.480
And this was a really great opportunity for all of those agencies to really collaborate on, again,

06:42:08.480 --> 06:42:16.480
what that statewide system of support will look like and how it can support LEAs in our continuous improvement system.

06:42:16.480 --> 06:42:23.480
So I wanted to share that that had happened, and as well as the Community Engagement Initiative

06:42:23.480 --> 06:42:29.480
end-of-year peer leading and learning network convening took place in April as well.

06:42:29.480 --> 06:42:36.480
There also is a CCEE Advisory Council, and I don't know how many of us are aware that it's composed of

06:42:36.480 --> 06:42:46.480
there's 22 county offices and LEA leaders that advise CCEE on the impact of opportunities and policy implications.

06:42:46.480 --> 06:42:55.480
So one note that I have here is that one priority that was highlighted by the leaders in that Advisory Council

06:42:55.480 --> 06:43:02.480
really related to the number of plans they're engaged in that communicate priorities, strategies and outcomes

06:43:02.480 --> 06:43:05.480
over all of the statewide initiatives.

06:43:05.480 --> 06:43:13.480
So it was probably similar to a conversation we had way earlier today about alignment of plans and what does this look like.

06:43:13.480 --> 06:43:18.480
The counties and the LEAs have expressed considerable interest in addressing that challenge.

06:43:18.480 --> 06:43:24.480
Again, we have a lot of different plans, and it's really about looking at how to best communicate,

06:43:24.480 --> 06:43:30.480
coordinate and align all of those plans and what's being asked for in them.

06:43:30.480 --> 06:43:37.480
Last thing I will say is that the next CCEE meeting, the last one for the school year will be in June.

06:43:37.480 --> 06:43:44.480
I believe it is June 15th, and at that time we'll get really a good end of year review, if you will,

06:43:44.480 --> 06:43:50.480
as well as an update from each of the three CCEE centers.

06:43:50.480 --> 06:43:55.480
So definitely one to watch or one to tune into after it's already done.

06:43:55.480 --> 06:44:00.480
But again, kudos to CCEE team, staff and all.

06:44:00.480 --> 06:44:04.480
They're again really trying to do what it is they've been called to do.

06:44:04.480 --> 06:44:06.480
Thank you.

06:44:06.480 --> 06:44:11.480
Oh wait, no, I have more.

06:44:11.480 --> 06:44:15.480
No, thank you.

06:44:15.480 --> 06:44:17.480
And wait, there's more.

06:44:17.480 --> 06:44:19.480
Okay, but this isn't about CCEE.

06:44:19.480 --> 06:44:22.480
That was like thank you for CCEE, but there's more.

06:44:22.480 --> 06:44:28.480
Okay, so for IQC, I'll be very brief because I know Member Lewis has information to share.

06:44:28.480 --> 06:44:34.480
Just again, we looked and we approved the bylaws on the consent agenda, so I won't go into that.

06:44:34.480 --> 06:44:37.480
And just wanted to share that the commissioners at the last meeting,

06:44:37.480 --> 06:44:45.480
they were given a presentation and an update to guidelines for piloting textbooks and instructional materials

06:44:45.480 --> 06:44:48.480
because that will be continuing during this year.

06:44:48.480 --> 06:44:53.480
So just wanted to give you a heads up that they've received some training and overview on that.

06:44:53.480 --> 06:44:56.480
And there'll be more to give and more to talk about.

06:44:56.480 --> 06:45:00.480
And I will let Member Lewis on her turn give you the rest of IQC.

06:45:00.480 --> 06:45:01.480
And that is it.

06:45:01.480 --> 06:45:03.480
Thank you.

06:45:03.480 --> 06:45:06.480
Member Lewis, you're up.

06:45:23.480 --> 06:45:30.480
One of the other items covered at that meeting was discussion about the alternative means to a diploma project.

06:45:30.480 --> 06:45:36.480
And if you're not aware of that project, it was authorized in the Budget Act of 2022.

06:45:36.480 --> 06:45:42.480
And the purpose of it is to identify and develop alternate coursework

06:45:42.480 --> 06:45:48.480
and projects, performance tasks for educators to be able to use with students with disabilities

06:45:48.480 --> 06:45:57.480
to provide them another means of completing the coursework for graduation requirements for the state of California

06:45:57.480 --> 06:45:59.480
through alternative means.

06:45:59.480 --> 06:46:02.480
So that's really good for our students with disabilities.

06:46:02.480 --> 06:46:10.480
And the Special Education Division at CDE oversees the contract that Westhead has to carry out this project.

06:46:10.480 --> 06:46:16.480
And there are certain outcomes, deliverables that should be a result of this project.

06:46:16.480 --> 06:46:22.480
And they include ready to implement course outlines for educators to be able to use,

06:46:22.480 --> 06:46:29.480
standard aligned rubrics, lesson plans that are aligned to the state's high school graduation requirements,

06:46:29.480 --> 06:46:32.480
and sample expression options.

06:46:32.480 --> 06:46:36.480
And so during the first year of this contract, which this is the first year,

06:46:36.480 --> 06:46:43.480
Westhead has conducted a national scan of states and other strategies that they use for providing students

06:46:43.480 --> 06:46:49.480
with alternate means to show their understanding of core content.

06:46:49.480 --> 06:46:55.480
And from this scan, they interviewed several states to learn more about their specific models.

06:46:55.480 --> 06:47:00.480
For instance, Colorado has their capstone project model.

06:47:00.480 --> 06:47:04.480
Connecticut, their mastery-based learning model.

06:47:04.480 --> 06:47:08.480
New Jersey, a portfolio-based assessment model.

06:47:08.480 --> 06:47:13.480
And Vermont has a proficiency-based graduation requirement model.

06:47:13.480 --> 06:47:22.480
And Westhead has also surveyed LEAs within California to see about what current strategies that they are using to provide

06:47:22.480 --> 06:47:28.480
means for our students with disabilities to meet graduation requirements in alternate ways

06:47:28.480 --> 06:47:36.480
and get their thoughts about reimagining LEA graduation strategies and also inquire about what type of state supports

06:47:36.480 --> 06:47:41.480
that they might need to build out these alternative means for students with an IEP.

06:47:41.480 --> 06:47:50.480
And Westhead is also conducting statewide focus groups to learn more about the local efforts that are going on and their needs.

06:47:50.480 --> 06:47:58.480
And for anyone interested, a recording of the March 15th meeting is available on the Instructional Quality Commission's

06:47:58.480 --> 06:48:06.480
2023 public meeting notices, agenda minutes, and webcast on the California Department of Education's website.

06:48:06.480 --> 06:48:09.480
And that concludes our report. Thank you.

06:48:09.480 --> 06:48:10.480
Thank you.

06:48:10.480 --> 06:48:11.480
Thank you very much.

06:48:11.480 --> 06:48:14.480
Member Olken.

06:48:14.480 --> 06:48:15.480
Thank you.

06:48:15.480 --> 06:48:17.480
I'll keep mine short and sweet today.

06:48:17.480 --> 06:48:28.480
But I just want to quickly say what you were talking about a moment ago reminded me of our study session at the May, March state board meeting.

06:48:28.480 --> 06:48:32.480
And so I'm looking forward to that coming back around at some point.

06:48:32.480 --> 06:48:34.480
It's good stuff.

06:48:34.480 --> 06:48:36.480
I'm going to just talk briefly.

06:48:36.480 --> 06:48:47.480
I don't think I need to give any updates on the advisor commission on charter schools because we have a lot of that today and tomorrow.

06:48:47.480 --> 06:49:07.480
I also am the liaison for environmental literacy and that work, which is building curricular units at every grade level to integrate environmental literacy standards into our classes continues.

06:49:07.480 --> 06:49:15.480
It's work that's being done by different folks across the state.

06:49:15.480 --> 06:49:20.480
And I'll have an update with more on that next month or next time we're together.

06:49:20.480 --> 06:49:29.480
And then the other project that I am part of is the statewide IEP template expert panel.

06:49:29.480 --> 06:49:55.480
And the work of that group is to propose some modifications to the statewide IEP template that was proposed last year and to sort of bring it further into a student build more on student strengths and student voice as part of that process.

06:49:55.480 --> 06:49:58.480
And that work is continuing.

06:49:58.480 --> 06:50:11.480
We met a few weeks ago with folks from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education because they've just recently rolled out a new statewide template.

06:50:11.480 --> 06:50:20.480
And they're now thinking about how to make sure everyone knows how to use it well to make sure that the IEP meetings are inclusive and thoughtful.

06:50:20.480 --> 06:50:23.480
And it was a great meeting to learn from their experience.

06:50:23.480 --> 06:50:27.480
And we're going to all come together for a full day meeting in June.

06:50:27.480 --> 06:50:28.480
So just wait in July.

06:50:28.480 --> 06:50:30.480
I'll have a lot to tell you.

06:50:30.480 --> 06:50:32.480
And that concludes my remarks.

06:50:32.480 --> 06:50:34.480
Thanks.

06:50:34.480 --> 06:50:37.480
Member Aresco Gonzalez.

06:50:37.480 --> 06:50:38.480
Thank you.

06:50:38.480 --> 06:50:40.480
Let me see if it's on.

06:50:40.480 --> 06:50:41.480
Okay.

06:50:41.480 --> 06:50:46.480
So as part of my role with the assessment committee lies on, we met on April 20th.

06:50:46.480 --> 06:51:04.480
And from our meeting, I want to highlight the developments and updates related to the CASP and ELPAC and the CDE and assessment contractor ETS continue to work in redesigning the student score reports for the CASP and ELPAC.

06:51:04.480 --> 06:51:19.480
The goals of the redesign efforts are to improve the reporting of test results provided to students, parents, guardians that include actionable information, provide students, parents, and guardians with timely access to test results.

06:51:19.480 --> 06:51:37.480
Overall, the concept designs were seen as improving the student score reports ability to providing parents with valuable snapshot of their child's learning with further detail regarding highlighting areas of success as well as identifying areas with opportunities for improvement.

06:51:37.480 --> 06:51:46.480
As we improve the reporting of test results, the hope is that it will provide opportunities for reflection to help students understand what they know and how they learn.

06:51:46.480 --> 06:52:03.480
And as they develop strategies for metacognition amongst the most important abilities students can acquire for students to develop this capacity, educators can provide them with multiple opportunities to reflect on their work, the choices they make and the strategies they have chosen in the learning process.

06:52:03.480 --> 06:52:08.480
These reflective opportunities will be part of our continuing work as a classroom teacher.

06:52:08.480 --> 06:52:17.480
Our summer will include reflection of our practice, professional learning and school team collaborations to use the assessment data to drive instruction.

06:52:17.480 --> 06:52:32.480
I encourage educators, classroom teachers and administrators to visit the CASP web page to view professional opportunities this summer and provide educator input, which is key to any change that we make to this process.

06:52:32.480 --> 06:52:37.480
And as a personal note, I just think as a teacher, it's a reflective practice.

06:52:37.480 --> 06:52:42.480
I think the end of the year, finalizing the school year, is the most exciting time.

06:52:42.480 --> 06:52:48.480
It's filled with personal joy. It's a celebration of hard work and growth and dedication.

06:52:48.480 --> 06:52:58.480
I know every single teacher has been assisting and helping through the process of assessment, and I'm grateful to be a teacher and to make a difference in these students' lives.

06:52:58.480 --> 06:53:04.480
And I know that reflection is key when it comes to assessment as we embark to the next school year.

06:53:04.480 --> 06:53:16.480
And I want to remind not only administrators, but educators and parents that there's so many tools that we have at the CDE website, and to navigate them are easy.

06:53:16.480 --> 06:53:27.480
Visit the dashboard. And again, I encourage you to visit the CASP web page to view some of these professional learning opportunities because they will help our students move forward.

06:53:27.480 --> 06:53:33.480
Great. Student Member Porter.

06:53:33.480 --> 06:53:39.480
Thank you so much, President Darling-Hammond. Good afternoon, or I guess not evening, board members and members of the public.

06:53:39.480 --> 06:53:44.480
There are three quick, quick, quick aspects of my work that I want to highlight from these past months in the interest of time.

06:53:44.480 --> 06:53:59.480
So first, I've met with student leaders and staff from Chino Hills, Shasta County, and Alhambra Unified School District to help them with frameworking a student advisory board for their district at the start of the school year next fall.

06:53:59.480 --> 06:54:15.480
Second, I presented to the Los Angeles Office of Education's Student Advisory Council meeting yesterday with about 26 students who represent the 1.5 million students in L.A. County about how to make the most of their education and opportunities for them to take advantage of.

06:54:15.480 --> 06:54:24.480
And more importantly, I heard their ideas about improving financial literacy and equity to very prevalent concerns for these students.

06:54:24.480 --> 06:54:30.480
And lastly, I was able to speak on two panels by nonprofits about mental health, education, and advocacy.

06:54:30.480 --> 06:54:40.480
And as always, a highlight for me and my work is being able to speak to local elementary schools, encouraging our youngest learners to pursue their own path and to enjoy learning.

06:54:40.480 --> 06:54:43.480
And that concludes my report.

06:54:43.480 --> 06:54:47.480
Okay. Member Rodriguez.

06:54:47.480 --> 06:54:52.480
Thank you so much. Good early evening, board members and members of the public.

06:54:52.480 --> 06:55:06.480
I have a few brief updates from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and Tad on my work as co-chair with NASB's education PEP Public Education Committee.

06:55:06.480 --> 06:55:26.480
So at the April meeting, the CTC completed an 18-month strategic plan process, adopting a strategic plan with an inspiring 21st century vision and guiding principles that center equity, linguistic and cultural diversity, and the well-being of students and educators.

06:55:26.480 --> 06:55:34.480
CTC's focus is strong, relevant, and needed as we continue to face a dire teacher shortage post pandemic.

06:55:34.480 --> 06:55:54.480
The commission is committed to high standards and teacher preparation and educator program accreditation, multiple high quality accessible pathways into the profession, including those highlighted in the budget in recent years, such as residency and integrated programs.

06:55:54.480 --> 06:56:17.480
I echo Superintendent Thurman's and President Darlene Hammond's enthusiasm for the teacher related language and the governor's May revision, which is supportive of strong residency programs, reciprocity for military spouse educators, and of course for the National Board incentives that they continue.

06:56:17.480 --> 06:56:22.480
In my work on the PEP committee as co-chair, I'm moving on now.

06:56:22.480 --> 06:56:27.480
I almost said bye, but I'm moving on.

06:56:27.480 --> 06:56:35.480
So on the PEP committee, the committee that I'm chairing is school redesign.

06:56:35.480 --> 06:56:56.480
So looking at high schools with more of a focus on adolescent development and how to best serve them as we heard CTE pathways and opportunities like that are very enriching for the adolescent mind and the adolescent development and looking at their futures.

06:56:56.480 --> 06:57:01.480
We heard a presentation on assessment for the other team that's working on that.

06:57:01.480 --> 06:57:07.480
We had Christine Pitts from Oregon who presented to the panel.

06:57:07.480 --> 06:57:16.480
And when I mentioned the work that we did at our last assessment, the work study, everybody got really excited about that.

06:57:16.480 --> 06:57:18.480
They were like, wow, that's awesome.

06:57:18.480 --> 06:57:31.480
And something came up with a lot of the comments of NASB members, you know, throughout other states regarding the need for transparency with assessment data.

06:57:31.480 --> 06:57:46.480
And, you know, I mentioned how what we do here in California and, you know, how our scores are posted, the process that the local control accountability plan goes through with the county offices.

06:57:46.480 --> 06:57:58.480
They're on the websites and that was it was really nice to share something that I feel we're doing really well and how we communicate the information in the home language of the child.

06:57:58.480 --> 06:58:05.480
So, you know, it was a it was very well received information.

06:58:05.480 --> 06:58:13.480
And lastly, I just wanted to share some good news that I was accepted to a week long Democratic.

06:58:13.480 --> 06:58:25.480
It's a civic summer institute at Acadia State Park in Maine, and it's sponsored by the Democratic Knowledge Project from Project Zero at Harvard.

06:58:25.480 --> 06:58:36.480
And so it'll be a group, I think, about 10 teachers and we'll talk about best practices in civics education and hopefully come back and share some good information.

06:58:36.480 --> 06:58:39.480
Thank you. That concludes my comments.

06:58:39.480 --> 06:58:42.480
Member Yoshimoto Tauri.

06:58:42.480 --> 06:58:52.480
Hi, I already mentioned the confluence of community schools with our students with disabilities and inclusive environments.

06:58:52.480 --> 06:58:56.480
But on English learners, I did want to make one note because today we looked at criterion one.

06:58:56.480 --> 06:59:08.480
And as of this month in May, the Optel, which is the observation protocol for teachers of English learners, is for criterion two and criterion three.

06:59:08.480 --> 06:59:11.480
And that's in its final field testing.

06:59:11.480 --> 06:59:19.480
And it will come to the SBE this fall for review and approval, which will give us a standardized protocol for those other two criterion.

06:59:19.480 --> 06:59:26.480
So thank you.

06:59:26.480 --> 06:59:28.480
Thank you very much.

06:59:28.480 --> 06:59:45.480
And I will simply add to the notes on the assessment front that we're continuing to work with members of the staff and ETS around what may happen with innovative items on the science assessment.

06:59:45.480 --> 06:59:52.480
So we'll be hearing more about that and hearing from different national experts who've been involved with performance assessments, et cetera.

06:59:52.480 --> 06:59:56.480
So we'll be continuing to hear more about that in the months to come.

06:59:56.480 --> 07:00:02.480
And it's exciting to think about students getting more deeply engaged in inquiry science in California.

07:00:03.480 --> 07:00:17.480
And with that, I am going to simply let us know that tomorrow we're going to meet in closed session at 830 to discuss and or take action on the following legal matters, Mirabelli versus Olson.

07:00:17.480 --> 07:00:22.480
And for our information, we'll be meeting upstairs on the fifth floor for that meeting.

07:00:22.480 --> 07:00:28.480
And I'll continue the meeting and end today's session as of 5, 10 p.m.

07:00:28.480 --> 07:00:29.480
And look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
