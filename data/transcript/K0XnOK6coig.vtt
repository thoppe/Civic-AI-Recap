WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.760
Reconvening the open session and in closed session the board

00:07.840 --> 00:11.000
discussed and took action on the following legal matters.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.680
Napa Valley Unified School District versus California

00:13.760 --> 00:16.340
State Board of Education, California School Boards

00:16.420 --> 00:19.340
Association's Education Legal Alliance versus California

00:19.420 --> 00:21.460
State Board of Education.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.220
Item 17 is the next item on the agenda.

00:25.300 --> 00:28.800
It is the action to set aside the State Board of Education's

00:28.880 --> 00:32.600
September 15th, 2022, reversal of the denials of the Maya

00:32.680 --> 00:36.100
Commons Charter Middle School petition to comply with a writ

00:36.180 --> 00:39.600
of mandate to be issued by the Sacramento Superior Court in

00:39.680 --> 00:42.220
Napa Valley Unified School District versus California

00:42.300 --> 00:44.980
State Board of Education and California School Boards

00:45.060 --> 00:48.100
Association's Education Legal Alliance versus California

00:48.180 --> 00:49.720
State Board of Education.

00:49.800 --> 00:53.260
As of this morning, no judgment or writ has issued.

00:53.340 --> 00:56.240
The board has received a request from counsel for Maya

00:56.280 --> 01:00.660
Commons Charter Middle School to withdraw item 17 because the

01:00.740 --> 01:04.040
school intends to immediately appeal the judgment and writ to

01:04.120 --> 01:07.280
be entered by the court in both cases.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.000
Counsel for the school has represented that its filing of

01:10.080 --> 01:13.240
the notice of appeal will automatically stay the court's

01:13.320 --> 01:16.420
judgment and writ that would require the board to take

01:16.500 --> 01:19.580
certain actions within 30 days of the writ's issuance.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.420
Yesterday the school filed notices of appeal in both cases.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.080
In light of these developments, the board will not take up

01:26.080 --> 01:29.460
item 17 at this meeting and it will be withdrawn from the

01:29.540 --> 01:31.880
agenda.

01:31.960 --> 01:35.160
Moving on to the next item, which is the waiver consent

01:35.260 --> 01:39.720
calendar, we need the public comment slide up for the

01:39.800 --> 01:40.460
waivers.

01:40.540 --> 01:43.000
Thank you.

01:43.080 --> 01:43.880
There we go.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.840
Now I'd like to take up the waiver consent items W1 through

01:46.920 --> 01:48.460
W14.

01:48.540 --> 01:52.580
We'll now open the phone line for the public comment queue and

01:52.660 --> 01:55.380
we will give a little wait time.

01:55.760 --> 02:00.140
First we'll ask if there's any in-person public comment.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.140
Nobody has signed up for public comment.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.260
Okay.

02:03.340 --> 02:05.760
And are there any speakers signed up to provide public

02:05.840 --> 02:08.100
comment?

02:08.180 --> 02:11.180
We do have a few callers in the queue.

02:11.260 --> 02:14.140
I'm going to remind the callers that we are currently taking

02:14.220 --> 02:22.680
public comment up for items W1 through W14.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.940
And I will open the phone line now.

02:28.020 --> 02:31.440
Caller with the last four digits, 8331, you are now live.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.900
Please start your public comment.

02:37.980 --> 02:38.440
Okay.

02:38.520 --> 02:44.400
Hearing none, caller with the last four digits, 2181, you are

02:44.480 --> 02:45.020
now live.

02:45.100 --> 02:52.100
Please start your public comment.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.100
My name is Kathy Matthews.

02:55.180 --> 02:58.820
I'm a grandmother with a grandchild who I will be

02:58.900 --> 03:01.900
sending to my commissary several years.

03:01.980 --> 03:02.900
I support this school.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.980
The two existing middle schools are totally different.

03:07.060 --> 03:07.860
I'm sorry.

03:07.940 --> 03:08.820
I'm sorry.

03:08.900 --> 03:09.900
I'm sorry.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.900
I'm sorry.

03:10.980 --> 03:11.940
I'm sorry.

03:12.020 --> 03:12.900
I'm sorry.

03:12.980 --> 03:13.860
I'm sorry.

03:13.940 --> 03:14.900
I'm sorry.

03:14.980 --> 03:15.900
I'm sorry.

03:15.980 --> 03:16.900
I'm sorry.

03:16.980 --> 03:17.940
I'm sorry.

03:18.020 --> 03:18.900
I'm sorry.

03:18.980 --> 03:19.900
I'm sorry.

03:19.980 --> 03:20.900
I'm sorry.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.700
I'm sorry to interrupt.

03:24.780 --> 03:27.700
That item has been withdrawn.

03:27.780 --> 03:35.700
We are currently taking public comment up for W1 through W14.

03:35.780 --> 03:40.700
And it looks like that concludes public comment.

03:40.780 --> 03:41.700
All right.

03:41.780 --> 03:43.700
Given that there's no further public comment, I'll ask for a

03:43.780 --> 03:46.700
motion on consent items waivers 1 through 14.

03:46.780 --> 03:48.700
Do I have a motion?

03:49.700 --> 03:51.900
Member Rodriguez, do I have a second?

03:51.980 --> 03:54.100
Member Olken, thank you very much.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.100
A show of hands for those in favor.

03:56.180 --> 03:59.500
Please keep your hands up until they're counted.

03:59.580 --> 04:04.100
And for UDL purposes, we'll say aye.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.100
Any opposed?

04:05.180 --> 04:06.100
Say nay.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.300
Any abstentions?

04:07.380 --> 04:07.900
All right.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.580
The motion carries.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.580
Thank you.

04:10.660 --> 04:15.100
Item 12 is the California's Bipartisan Safer Communities

04:15.180 --> 04:18.580
Act Stronger Connections Grant Program proposal.

04:19.020 --> 04:23.060
The approval of the criteria to define high needs.

04:23.140 --> 04:28.660
And I will turn this over to Lisa Borrego of the CDE.

04:28.740 --> 04:30.140
Lisa, please begin.

04:30.220 --> 04:33.820
Good morning, everyone.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.140
Yes, we can.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.820
Good morning, everyone.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.380
It is a little low, however.

04:42.460 --> 04:43.060
Yes.

04:43.140 --> 04:43.540
Okay.

04:43.620 --> 04:45.060
Good morning, everyone.

04:45.140 --> 04:47.100
Good morning, Board President Darling-Hammond, Vice

04:47.140 --> 04:49.620
President Glover-Woods, Board members and Chief Deputy

04:49.700 --> 04:50.460
Nicely.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.140
My name is Lisa Borrego, Director of the Whole Child

04:53.220 --> 04:53.980
Division.

04:54.060 --> 04:56.300
I will be presenting on board item number 12,

04:56.380 --> 04:58.700
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act Stronger

04:58.780 --> 05:00.260
Connections Grant Program.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.340
Here with me today are Nancy Kim Portillo, Deputy

05:05.420 --> 05:07.820
Superintendent of Public Instruction, and Dr.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.020
Tom Herman, Education Administrator of the

05:10.100 --> 05:12.020
School Health and Safety Office.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.820
Tom's office will be responsible for

05:13.900 --> 05:16.220
administering the Stronger Connections Grant for the

05:16.220 --> 05:18.220
California Department of Education.

05:21.540 --> 05:24.380
The California Department of Education recommends that

05:24.460 --> 05:27.220
the SBE approve the criteria for the definition of

05:27.300 --> 05:30.700
high need LEA as required in the Californians

05:30.780 --> 05:33.420
Bipartisan Safer Communities Act Stronger

05:33.500 --> 05:36.780
Connections Grant Program pending the SBE Executive

05:36.860 --> 05:39.620
Director approval of final revisions requested by the

05:39.700 --> 05:42.860
SBE, correction of any typographical errors, and

05:42.940 --> 05:45.980
necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

05:46.220 --> 05:50.500
President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer

05:50.580 --> 05:54.100
Communities Act in June 2022 to address the epidemic

05:54.180 --> 05:56.460
of gun violence in schools and communities.

05:56.540 --> 05:58.500
Congress authorized one billion dollars in

05:58.580 --> 06:01.380
formula funding under Title IV, Part A of the

06:01.460 --> 06:04.380
Elementary and Secondary Act for state educational

06:04.460 --> 06:06.780
agencies to provide safer and healthier learning

06:06.860 --> 06:08.740
environments for students.

06:08.820 --> 06:11.020
The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provides one

06:11.100 --> 06:13.180
billion dollars to be awarded in competitive

06:13.220 --> 06:16.820
grants to high need LEAs to establish safer and

06:16.900 --> 06:18.700
healthier learning environments.

06:18.780 --> 06:20.620
This is called the Stronger Connections Grant

06:20.700 --> 06:22.260
Program.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.740
The Bipartisan Safer Community Act specifies

06:24.820 --> 06:27.220
that state education agencies must make

06:27.300 --> 06:30.100
competitive grants to high need LEAs to support

06:30.180 --> 06:33.260
activities under Section 4108 of the Elementary and

06:33.340 --> 06:37.340
Secondary Education Act.

06:37.420 --> 06:39.580
California was awarded one hundred and nineteen

06:39.660 --> 06:40.860
million dollars.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.860
One hundred and thirteen million dollars of this

06:42.940 --> 06:44.860
grant will be awarded to LEAs through a

06:44.940 --> 06:46.940
competitive process.

06:49.340 --> 06:51.380
The purpose of the grant is to increase school

06:51.460 --> 06:53.780
safety, address mental health needs of students,

06:53.860 --> 06:56.260
and promote the emotional and physical well-being

06:56.340 --> 06:58.340
of all students.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.420
States are encouraged to award funding to LEAs

07:02.500 --> 07:04.860
that prioritize social-emotional learning

07:04.940 --> 07:07.420
programs and practices, trauma-informed

07:07.420 --> 07:10.940
practices, identification and referral, initiatives

07:11.020 --> 07:13.420
that reduce exclusionary discipline approaches such

07:13.500 --> 07:16.500
as restorative practices, systemic efforts to

07:16.580 --> 07:19.140
transform school climate by reducing punitive school

07:19.220 --> 07:21.900
discipline practices, and increasing support for

07:21.980 --> 07:23.980
pro-social behaviors.

07:24.060 --> 07:26.500
LEAs will outline their planned use of funds in

07:26.580 --> 07:28.580
the request for application.

07:30.820 --> 07:33.500
Under the U.S. Department of Education published

07:33.580 --> 07:36.540
guidance, the state education agency must

07:36.580 --> 07:39.740
define high-need LEA for purposes of eligibility

07:39.820 --> 07:42.700
for the Stronger Connections Grant Program and

07:42.780 --> 07:44.940
is encouraged to provide the public with an

07:45.020 --> 07:47.820
opportunity to comment and provide input related to

07:47.900 --> 07:49.900
the grant implementation.

07:49.980 --> 07:52.140
Further, they encourage states to use a measure of

07:52.220 --> 07:55.420
poverty in their definition of high-need LEA and to

07:55.500 --> 07:58.700
consider other elements such as chronic absenteeism,

07:58.780 --> 08:01.580
exclusionary discipline, referrals to the juvenile

08:01.660 --> 08:04.820
justice system, substance use, lack of mental

08:04.860 --> 08:08.860
health staff, and exposure to natural disaster.

08:08.940 --> 08:11.460
The charge is to identify a definition of high needs

08:11.540 --> 08:14.500
that is reflective of an LEA's lack of resources to

08:14.580 --> 08:17.180
address the health and safety of all students.

08:17.260 --> 08:20.340
This definition is not intended to identify the

08:20.420 --> 08:23.820
LEAs with the greatest safety issues.

08:23.900 --> 08:26.700
To be clear, as we submit this proposed definition

08:26.780 --> 08:29.100
of high needs, we do not assume that a lack of

08:29.180 --> 08:31.820
resources means a community is more violent.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.380
Rather, our purpose in proposing this definition

08:34.500 --> 08:37.300
is to increase equity and resources through this

08:37.380 --> 08:39.940
grant in combination with other recent efforts like

08:40.020 --> 08:42.260
the Community Schools Partnership Program to

08:42.340 --> 08:45.540
strengthen assets and add resources in areas where

08:45.620 --> 08:49.620
decades of disinvestment has had deep educational impacts.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.580
To meet the requirement to provide the public with

08:55.660 --> 08:58.580
notice and a reasonable opportunity to comment and

08:58.660 --> 09:01.500
to maximize input from education partners across

09:01.580 --> 09:05.500
the state, the CDE designed and distributed a survey.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.780
The survey asked respondents to rank the

09:07.860 --> 09:10.420
importance of the proposed elements of high need and

09:10.500 --> 09:13.940
to prioritize strategies and approaches to safety

09:14.020 --> 09:15.460
and student outcomes.

09:18.340 --> 09:21.020
The survey was sent electronically on June 6,

09:21.100 --> 09:25.020
2023, and closed on June 12, 2023.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.460
The survey was sent to educational partner groups,

09:27.540 --> 09:30.220
including, but not limited to, state and federal

09:30.300 --> 09:32.860
program directors, school safety partners from all

09:32.940 --> 09:36.020
counties, school districts, mental health partners,

09:36.100 --> 09:37.940
and service providers.

09:38.020 --> 09:42.260
CDE received 343 responses.

09:42.340 --> 09:45.100
Seventy-seven percent of respondents indicated that

09:45.180 --> 09:47.820
a chronic absenteeism rate higher than the state

09:47.900 --> 09:52.220
average was of high importance to defining high need.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.540
Eighty-two percent of the respondents indicated that

09:54.620 --> 09:57.460
adding or increasing staff within an LEA whose

09:57.540 --> 09:59.860
primary purpose is to address the mental health

09:59.860 --> 10:02.860
needs of students is a priority strategy and

10:02.940 --> 10:05.140
approach to improving student outcomes.

10:07.580 --> 10:10.420
In formulating the definition of high need,

10:10.500 --> 10:13.820
we considered several factors, including

10:13.900 --> 10:17.060
available statewide and comparable data, survey

10:17.140 --> 10:20.540
results, as referenced in slide 10, definitions

10:20.620 --> 10:23.700
used by other states, and the proposed request for

10:23.780 --> 10:25.700
application components.

10:25.780 --> 10:28.900
For example, while a criterion on access to

10:29.020 --> 10:32.140
mental health staff was of interest, California does

10:32.220 --> 10:34.380
not have a statewide comparable metric to

10:34.460 --> 10:36.860
measure this, which makes it more appropriate for

10:36.940 --> 10:38.900
discussion by the applicant in their request

10:38.980 --> 10:40.860
for application.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.140
As mentioned, we also looked into definitions

10:43.220 --> 10:44.940
used by other states.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.380
Nevada used a high rate of poverty and one of the

10:47.460 --> 10:49.260
following characteristics.

10:49.340 --> 10:51.900
High rates of chronic absenteeism, students

10:51.980 --> 10:54.980
experiencing transiency or homelessness, referrals

10:55.060 --> 10:57.220
to the juvenile justice system.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.140
Colorado used the percentage of students

10:59.220 --> 11:03.740
eligible for free and reduced lunch, student to

11:03.820 --> 11:08.300
mental health ratios, and rate of chronic absenteeism.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.540
Finally, the request for application will allow us

11:11.620 --> 11:14.260
to capture additional local data that will help

11:14.340 --> 11:16.260
determine the allocation of these funds.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.060
As a result, the following represents the proposed

11:22.140 --> 11:25.460
definition of high need for your consideration.

11:25.500 --> 11:29.620
LEAs with a concentration of 80% or above of

11:29.700 --> 11:32.420
students from low income families, English learners

11:32.500 --> 11:35.500
and students in foster care, plus one or more of

11:35.580 --> 11:37.420
the following characteristics.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.820
Unduplicated pupil count.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.580
A chronic absenteeism rate higher than the state

11:42.660 --> 11:46.260
average, an exclusionary discipline in and out of

11:46.340 --> 11:48.460
school suspension rate higher than the state

11:48.540 --> 11:51.660
average, a school stability rate lower than the

11:51.740 --> 11:54.620
state average, and a dropout rate higher than

11:54.660 --> 11:56.460
the state average.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.620
With the combination of the use of a high unduplicated

11:59.700 --> 12:02.300
pupil percentage and one of the additional

12:02.380 --> 12:05.260
eligibility criteria such as high suspension rates

12:05.340 --> 12:07.860
and the local context provided in the request

12:07.940 --> 12:10.500
for application, we hope to provide a significant

12:10.580 --> 12:12.940
amount of funding to LEAs who want to improve their

12:13.020 --> 12:16.100
school climate for a safer campus who may not

12:16.180 --> 12:19.500
otherwise have access to resources to do so.

12:19.500 --> 12:25.020
For clarification purposes, I do want to mention that

12:25.100 --> 12:27.940
unlike community schools implementation grants,

12:28.020 --> 12:35.660
eligibility for this grant is at the LEA level rather

12:35.740 --> 12:37.620
than at the school level.

12:37.700 --> 12:40.620
In other words, LEAs that qualify under the high

12:40.700 --> 12:43.300
needs definition approved by the board would

12:43.380 --> 12:45.620
determine which of their schools they will seek

12:45.700 --> 12:48.460
funding for in their request for application.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.460
We anticipate providing further guidance and

12:50.540 --> 12:53.380
clarification for the school site selection process

12:53.460 --> 12:55.660
as we finalize the request for application in

12:55.740 --> 12:59.380
collaboration with SBE.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.860
Based on the proposed definition of high needs,

13:01.940 --> 13:04.740
CDE conducted a data run to determine the number of

13:04.820 --> 13:06.940
LEAs that would be eligible along with some

13:07.020 --> 13:08.900
additional highlights.

13:08.980 --> 13:12.700
624 LEAs would be eligible under the proposed

13:12.780 --> 13:15.300
definition of high need.

13:15.340 --> 13:20.660
Within those LEAs, 3,228 schools under eligible

13:20.740 --> 13:23.340
LEAs including charter and non-charter schools

13:23.420 --> 13:25.060
would be eligible.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.860
In addition, eligible LEAs are distributed

13:27.940 --> 13:29.780
throughout the state representing diverse

13:29.860 --> 13:33.620
geographic regions and both urban and rural communities.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.580
The competitive application process will

13:39.660 --> 13:43.020
encourage eligible LEAs to utilize specific local

13:43.100 --> 13:45.700
data points or indicators such as mental health

13:45.780 --> 13:48.620
needs, bullying, harassment, community and

13:48.700 --> 13:51.300
school violence and substance use to establish

13:51.380 --> 13:53.180
the gaps and needs that will be addressed

13:53.260 --> 13:55.180
through this grant program.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.500
The competitive process will allow LEAs to

13:57.580 --> 13:59.620
improve to provide information about their

13:59.700 --> 14:02.500
specific health and safety needs.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.700
The draft request for application that was

14:04.780 --> 14:06.940
included at the time of the agenda posting for the

14:07.020 --> 14:10.100
July meeting does not reflect a new requirement

14:10.140 --> 14:12.980
of the 2023 budget act which requires that

14:13.060 --> 14:16.340
LEAs implementing MTSS, multi-tiered systems of

14:16.420 --> 14:19.660
support, be prioritized for these grants.

14:19.740 --> 14:22.420
The multi-tiered system of support prioritization

14:22.500 --> 14:24.180
will be included in the final request for

14:24.260 --> 14:27.140
application along with directions of how LEAs

14:27.220 --> 14:29.620
can document their multi-tiered system of

14:29.700 --> 14:33.300
support process as part of their submission.

14:33.380 --> 14:36.380
CDE, in collaboration with SBE, will use the

14:36.460 --> 14:39.100
request for application process to ensure that

14:39.140 --> 14:41.420
schools and communities demonstrating the highest

14:41.500 --> 14:44.260
need are prioritized and that requests for

14:44.340 --> 14:46.860
application submission requirements mitigate

14:46.940 --> 14:49.740
against potential disproportionate advantages

14:49.820 --> 14:53.220
or disadvantages for particular LEAs resulting

14:53.300 --> 14:55.300
from the federal requirement to qualify

14:55.380 --> 14:57.940
applicants at the LEA level.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.700
CDE will work closely with SBE staff to ensure

15:00.780 --> 15:03.380
alignment and integration of this new language

15:03.460 --> 15:05.420
along with developing subject to approval by

15:05.500 --> 15:07.140
the executive director of the State Board of

15:07.220 --> 15:10.780
Education the request for application process.

15:10.860 --> 15:12.700
Additionally, we have heard from educational

15:12.780 --> 15:14.900
partners about the timeline in the posted

15:14.980 --> 15:17.220
draft request for application and will

15:17.300 --> 15:19.340
adjust the submission timeline to ensure that

15:19.420 --> 15:24.900
all eligible LEAs have the opportunity to apply.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.740
Eligible LEAs will apply on behalf of their

15:27.820 --> 15:29.700
selected schools.

15:29.780 --> 15:32.580
As mentioned previously, unlike community schools,

15:32.660 --> 15:35.140
eligibility for this grant is determined at the

15:35.220 --> 15:38.260
LEA level rather than at the school level.

15:38.340 --> 15:44.900
LEAs will receive between $150,000 to $400,000

15:44.980 --> 15:46.900
for each selected school.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.980
Allocation is based on school enrollment.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.500
The amounts are designed to give schools enough

15:52.580 --> 15:55.220
resources to affect change.

15:55.300 --> 15:58.220
The funding will be allocated to awarded LEAs

15:58.300 --> 16:00.700
annually for two years.

16:00.780 --> 16:03.540
All grant funds need to be expended by September

16:03.580 --> 16:07.580
2026.

16:07.660 --> 16:10.260
In closing, the California Department of

16:10.340 --> 16:13.140
Education recommends that the SBE approve the

16:13.220 --> 16:15.100
criteria for the definition of high need

16:15.180 --> 16:18.140
LEA as required in the California's Bipartisan

16:18.220 --> 16:20.460
Safer Communities Act Stronger Connections

16:20.540 --> 16:23.820
Grant Program pending the SBE executive director

16:23.900 --> 16:27.140
approval of final revisions requested by the SBE

16:27.220 --> 16:29.860
correction of any typographical errors and

16:29.940 --> 16:33.460
necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

16:33.540 --> 16:35.540
This concludes our presentation and we are

16:35.620 --> 16:37.620
happy to answer any questions.

16:42.980 --> 16:45.300
Thank you very much.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.700
First I want to ask our liaison, well first I

16:49.780 --> 16:51.500
want to ask you to put the public comments slide

16:51.580 --> 16:53.220
up which you have.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.820
Members of the public wishing to provide

16:54.900 --> 16:56.860
comment may do so in person or by calling the

16:56.940 --> 16:59.620
telephone number and using the access code provided

16:59.700 --> 17:01.660
on the slide that is shown now.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.300
And while we're waiting for members of the public

17:03.300 --> 17:05.780
to call in, I want to ask our liaison member

17:05.860 --> 17:08.340
Escobedo if he has any initial comments then

17:08.420 --> 17:10.020
we'll see if we have clarifying questions on

17:10.100 --> 17:13.860
the board before we go to public comment.

17:13.940 --> 17:15.940
Member Escobedo.

17:16.020 --> 17:19.940
I just wanted to note that I do believe that the

17:20.020 --> 17:24.420
indicators we saw in front of us on duplicate

17:24.500 --> 17:27.380
accounts and high chronic absenteeism and

17:27.460 --> 17:30.660
reduced lunch are indicators that I do

17:30.820 --> 17:36.980
believe helps us identify which schools are worthy

17:37.060 --> 17:39.940
for safer community grant.

17:40.020 --> 17:46.940
However, I just want to also share that just because

17:47.020 --> 17:50.260
we have a high rate of chronic absenteeism or we

17:50.340 --> 17:58.100
have high poverty, safety is an important aspect

17:58.180 --> 18:01.540
for all schools no matter what the poverty rate.

18:01.620 --> 18:06.620
In fact, a lot of the violence occurs in schools

18:06.700 --> 18:10.860
where you have a very affluent population.

18:10.940 --> 18:15.700
Most of the shootings actually occur in non-urban

18:15.780 --> 18:19.180
school settings so I just wanted to share that.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.380
But looking at the requirements as we see in

18:22.420 --> 18:28.580
this grant, I do applaud CEE for their efforts in

18:28.660 --> 18:33.700
creating the criteria but I just want to make sure

18:33.780 --> 18:43.700
that safety belongs for every school no matter

18:43.780 --> 18:46.740
what these indicators look like.

18:46.820 --> 18:50.860
So just wanted to share those thoughts from my

18:50.900 --> 18:51.900
perspective.

18:51.980 --> 18:54.980
Thank you.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.100
Are there any clarifying questions before we go to

18:57.180 --> 18:58.180
public comment?

18:58.260 --> 19:00.940
Yes, member Patilla Bronson.

19:01.020 --> 19:04.540
So as you were describing the potential criteria, I

19:04.620 --> 19:07.820
think that you said something about not using

19:07.900 --> 19:12.300
community level violence as an indicator based on

19:12.380 --> 19:15.100
federal guidance but I just wanted to clarify.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.380
So the recommendation that's being put forth to

19:17.460 --> 19:20.180
the SBE takes into consideration three

19:20.300 --> 19:22.500
indicators not of one of which is community

19:22.580 --> 19:23.580
violence.

19:23.660 --> 19:27.100
That indicator or that local information can become

19:27.180 --> 19:30.380
a part of the applicant's RFA in describing the

19:30.460 --> 19:32.140
communities and the schools that they'll be

19:32.220 --> 19:33.220
applying for.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.820
So they can use that local level data to be able to

19:35.900 --> 19:38.380
share and present their story on why they're

19:38.460 --> 19:41.140
recommending their school site to be funded through

19:41.220 --> 19:43.020
this program.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.500
There's not a federal prohibition on actually

19:46.580 --> 19:49.300
using that for our eligibility criteria for

19:49.460 --> 19:50.460
the RFA.

19:50.540 --> 19:55.540
Is that correct?

19:55.620 --> 19:57.780
I'm going to ask, excuse me, I'm asking my technical

19:57.860 --> 20:05.860
assistant to support Dr. Herman.

20:05.940 --> 20:07.220
Thank you.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.180
Tom Herman, administrator of the School Health and

20:09.260 --> 20:11.300
Safety Office.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.460
That is correct that there is no prohibition against

20:14.540 --> 20:17.700
using the community violence indicators.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.260
It's just that we felt it would be fair to use those

20:20.340 --> 20:24.460
indicators that are collected statewide and

20:24.540 --> 20:28.340
then those other local indicators such as substance

20:28.420 --> 20:32.980
abuse, community violence, youth risk behaviors in

20:33.060 --> 20:36.100
schools that they would form part of the RFA to

20:36.180 --> 20:38.180
become part of that competitive process.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.620
Just a brief one.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.020
I thought you might have said, but I wasn't, I

20:52.100 --> 20:53.100
didn't hear quite clearly.

20:53.180 --> 20:55.020
Did you say that we were, you were going to adjust

20:55.100 --> 20:58.340
the RFA timeline to allow all LEAs to apply?

20:58.420 --> 21:00.260
That is correct.

21:00.340 --> 21:02.100
Do we know what that timeline is yet?

21:02.180 --> 21:05.020
No, we'll be working with the SB staff to identify

21:05.100 --> 21:07.700
what that timeline will look like.

21:07.780 --> 21:08.780
Thank you.

21:08.860 --> 21:11.140
Member Olken, did you have the same question?

21:11.220 --> 21:14.300
It looked like you had a question too.

21:14.380 --> 21:15.380
Okay.

21:15.460 --> 21:16.460
All right.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.100
We have a few minutes here, so we're going to go

21:18.180 --> 21:19.180
to public comment.

21:19.260 --> 21:23.260
Is there any public comment in the room?

21:23.340 --> 21:25.740
You guys can take a rest if you want for a minute

21:25.820 --> 21:27.820
because I don't know if we'll have any public

21:27.900 --> 21:28.900
comment.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.980
Don't get too comfy.

21:31.060 --> 21:33.060
There's no public comment in the room.

21:33.140 --> 21:34.140
All right.

21:34.220 --> 21:35.220
Is there any on the phone?

21:35.300 --> 21:36.300
Yes.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.900
We have one caller.

21:37.980 --> 21:40.980
Caller with the last four digits, 4270.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.060
You are now live.

21:42.140 --> 21:45.060
Please start your public comment.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.140
Thank you.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.420
Madam Chair, members, excuse me, Madam President

21:49.500 --> 21:51.340
and members, Leigh Ann Giller Reed on behalf of

21:51.420 --> 21:53.580
the Small School Districts Association.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.860
I want to thank the department for acknowledging

21:56.940 --> 21:59.700
the timeline, which was a little bit untenable

21:59.780 --> 22:02.580
for everyone, but particularly small districts

22:02.660 --> 22:07.580
who don't often have the capacity to do a grant

22:07.660 --> 22:11.020
in the timeline, such as was proposed.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.340
And we look forward to working with the

22:12.420 --> 22:15.980
department to ensure that small districts

22:15.980 --> 22:18.500
can play a part because those community services

22:18.580 --> 22:24.860
may not are even more overstressed in some of

22:24.940 --> 22:25.940
those rural areas.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.500
So we look forward to working with you and

22:27.580 --> 22:30.540
thank you again for adjusting the timeline.

22:30.620 --> 22:33.820
And we are here to help in any way we can.

22:33.900 --> 22:34.900
Thank you.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.900
That concludes public comment for item number 12.

22:37.980 --> 22:38.980
Thank you.

22:39.060 --> 22:41.300
So we're now open for board discussion.

22:41.380 --> 22:42.860
Questions or comments?

22:42.900 --> 22:46.420
Yes, I remember Tilo Bronson and then member

22:46.500 --> 22:48.460
Roscoe Gonzalez.

22:48.540 --> 22:50.540
So I just wanted to start by saying I think this

22:50.620 --> 22:55.460
is such a necessary and important area of focus

22:55.540 --> 22:57.740
and I'm so grateful that you all have put this

22:57.820 --> 23:01.300
together to actually think about how to make sure

23:01.380 --> 23:04.100
that these funding sources are directed to the

23:04.180 --> 23:05.700
right places.

23:05.780 --> 23:11.740
I'm a little, I'm trying to grapple with the lack

23:11.780 --> 23:15.420
of a community violence indicator, which I think

23:15.500 --> 23:18.940
would be, would hit it most on the nose.

23:19.020 --> 23:25.580
And in prior work, there are state indicators

23:25.660 --> 23:28.940
that are collected around community levels of gun

23:29.020 --> 23:31.260
violence by zip code.

23:31.340 --> 23:37.180
The, I'm going to pull up the stat as soon as my

23:37.260 --> 23:40.260
phone opens up.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.260
It is, it used to be the Office of Statewide

23:43.340 --> 23:45.740
Health Planning and Development that has been

23:45.820 --> 23:48.740
renamed in the 22 budget as the Department of

23:48.820 --> 23:51.940
Health Care Access and Information and they have

23:52.020 --> 23:54.140
a statewide database of firearm related

23:54.220 --> 23:56.420
hospitalizations.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.340
The level of community violence, particularly

23:59.420 --> 24:04.220
that young people experience in high violence

24:04.300 --> 24:07.940
community, I think is, should be, I think,

24:07.980 --> 24:09.940
lifted up.

24:10.020 --> 24:15.260
And it is, it's not, I think, quite the same as

24:15.340 --> 24:17.940
thinking about community level poverty, which I

24:18.020 --> 24:21.300
think is important, valuable and certainly

24:21.380 --> 24:22.580
relevant.

24:22.660 --> 24:25.900
But because we have particular school sites

24:25.980 --> 24:30.980
and LEAs where the levels of PTSD rival that of

24:31.060 --> 24:35.700
war zones, I think it is relevant to actually have

24:35.740 --> 24:38.740
an indicator that captures that information.

24:38.820 --> 24:43.380
So my suggestion would be that that be elevated as

24:43.460 --> 24:45.660
among the definitions of high need as we're

24:45.740 --> 24:49.660
thinking about a pot of funding that is about

24:49.740 --> 24:53.740
community level violence and safety.

24:53.820 --> 24:57.860
And I'd be happy to send you the sort of data

24:57.940 --> 24:59.660
sources, but it's a state agency.

24:59.900 --> 25:00.900
So.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.500
Roscoe Gonzalez.

25:06.580 --> 25:09.580
Well, and make sure I get here.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.700
And considering that the funded activities may

25:11.780 --> 25:14.220
involve providing mental health services,

25:14.300 --> 25:16.900
encouraging community involvement, establishing

25:16.980 --> 25:18.980
programs to prevent students from dropping out,

25:19.060 --> 25:21.980
implementing nighttime bully initiatives,

25:22.060 --> 25:25.380
purchasing security equipment, reducing chronic

25:25.460 --> 25:28.220
absenteeism in elementary schools, providing early

25:28.260 --> 25:30.140
intervention for middle school students,

25:30.220 --> 25:32.860
behavioral mental health challenges.

25:32.940 --> 25:34.700
When I was reading all this, I thought about will

25:34.780 --> 25:37.180
LEAs be encouraged to create synergy with

25:37.260 --> 25:40.260
community school grants that have been awarded

25:40.340 --> 25:43.100
because it seems like it would be something that

25:43.180 --> 25:44.180
goes together.

25:46.820 --> 25:48.940
The question again is will LEAs be encouraged to

25:49.020 --> 25:52.460
create synergy with community schools grants

25:52.540 --> 25:53.820
that have been awarded?

25:53.900 --> 25:54.740
Yes, thank you.

25:54.780 --> 26:01.180
We are building that into the RFA that districts

26:01.260 --> 26:06.660
indicate the extent to which they're having

26:06.740 --> 26:12.300
systems in place that are school wide that include

26:12.380 --> 26:18.620
community involvement and other initiatives that

26:18.700 --> 26:20.700
they currently have related to this.

26:20.740 --> 26:24.020
This grant itself is related to title four,

26:24.100 --> 26:26.780
part A of ESSA.

26:26.860 --> 26:32.620
It's separated fiscally, but it is nonetheless many

26:32.700 --> 26:34.740
of the same topics.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.820
And so related to the ones you just mentioned.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.580
Great, thank you.

26:39.660 --> 26:41.860
And I'm also just add that I'm happy to hear that

26:41.940 --> 26:44.780
the timeline is being worked on because I wanted

26:44.860 --> 26:46.740
to be able to give opportunities to LEAs to

26:46.820 --> 26:49.700
have enough time to apply, especially rural

26:49.780 --> 26:51.700
communities that don't have the resources for

26:51.780 --> 26:53.340
these grant writing teams, so thank you.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.900
I'd just like to piggyback on that and then I'll

26:57.980 --> 27:01.500
see if there are any other questions or comments.

27:01.580 --> 27:05.260
It would be great if in both helping people think

27:05.340 --> 27:07.140
about that we can also try to structure the

27:07.220 --> 27:09.740
reporting and so on so that it is more efficient

27:09.820 --> 27:12.420
for districts because they're getting hit with a

27:12.460 --> 27:19.460
lot of, you know, management monitoring,

27:19.540 --> 27:21.700
reporting things, and I know that this is federal

27:21.780 --> 27:24.140
so that adds its own, you know, wrinkle to it,

27:24.220 --> 27:26.300
but if you can keep that in mind as you're also

27:26.380 --> 27:28.820
helping people think about how to integrate the

27:28.900 --> 27:30.540
work that they're doing.

27:30.620 --> 27:35.380
The bill itself allows for a large range of fund

27:35.460 --> 27:40.060
uses from sort of school hardening practices to,

27:40.100 --> 27:42.900
you know, more supportive practices to create a

27:42.980 --> 27:46.740
stronger climate and mental health setting,

27:46.820 --> 27:50.460
and it might be useful in the RFA when you get to

27:50.540 --> 27:53.700
that to be either providing some of the

27:53.780 --> 27:57.900
research or asking districts to, you know,

27:57.980 --> 28:01.860
locate their plans in the evidence about what is

28:01.940 --> 28:06.020
most supportive of school safety so that...

28:06.100 --> 28:07.660
Absolutely.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.660
Yeah.

28:08.740 --> 28:14.100
Are there any other questions or comments?

28:15.500 --> 28:18.540
I don't know if I need to actually propose a motion

28:18.620 --> 28:22.860
in order to append something on gun-related

28:22.940 --> 28:25.980
hospitalizations as a factor.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.420
Hospitalizations?

28:27.500 --> 28:28.380
Gun-related.

28:28.460 --> 28:30.100
Oh, gun-related, yeah.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.700
Community violence and I don't know...

28:32.780 --> 28:33.900
Well, let's come back around to that.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.900
We have another discussion coming from

28:36.940 --> 28:39.060
Member McQuillin and then we can come back to that

28:39.140 --> 28:41.180
question before we get to a motion.

28:41.260 --> 28:44.620
Yes, thank you for bringing this forward.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.740
You mentioned a consideration on the

28:46.820 --> 28:50.180
timeline for the application for additional

28:50.260 --> 28:51.660
time for rural districts.

28:51.740 --> 28:54.580
Were there any other considerations for the

28:54.660 --> 28:58.900
disbursement and, you know, equitable disbursement

28:58.980 --> 29:02.340
for rural districts also?

29:02.420 --> 29:04.900
Yeah, thank you for that question.

29:04.980 --> 29:07.700
We've been in contact with rural districts and part of,

29:07.780 --> 29:10.380
as you know, part of the issue has been when it's

29:10.460 --> 29:14.340
based merely on ADA that they sort of suffer from

29:14.420 --> 29:17.180
that because they're not given enough funds to

29:17.260 --> 29:19.860
really affect systemic change and so we're

29:19.940 --> 29:25.140
looking at a minimum threshold of 150,000

29:25.220 --> 29:27.580
currentlys are thinking about a school so

29:27.660 --> 29:29.580
regardless of their size that they would be given

29:29.660 --> 29:34.540
enough money to affect change that is long lasting

29:34.540 --> 29:36.300
and systemic.

29:38.940 --> 29:42.140
As well, I should note that there would be a cap

29:42.220 --> 29:44.580
equally on larger districts so that they

29:44.660 --> 29:48.420
would not sort of gobble up all of the funds so

29:48.500 --> 29:51.220
that there would be a cap on the very large

29:51.300 --> 29:55.620
districts to allow us to be more equitable with the

29:55.700 --> 29:57.980
disbursement of the funds.

29:58.060 --> 29:59.700
Member Olken.

29:59.780 --> 30:00.300
Thank you.

30:00.380 --> 30:03.340
I just wanted to ask a clarifying question

30:03.380 --> 30:10.460
related to member Patil Bronson's potential amendment.

30:10.540 --> 30:14.660
So I thought I heard when you were presenting that

30:14.740 --> 30:19.140
the reason there wasn't a specific indicator related

30:19.220 --> 30:24.140
to community violence was related to the fact there

30:24.220 --> 30:28.140
isn't a comparable measure statewide and I just

30:28.220 --> 30:29.820
wonder if you could talk about that a little bit

30:29.900 --> 30:32.300
and then maybe I misheard that.

30:32.340 --> 30:41.740
And then also clarify if the description of

30:41.820 --> 30:47.020
community violence or community violence is

30:47.100 --> 30:50.100
built into the application but isn't an indicator,

30:50.180 --> 30:53.140
how would it actually be considered?

30:53.220 --> 30:55.540
I'm sorry, could you repeat just the letter?

30:55.620 --> 31:00.860
So if those who are applying are able to address

31:00.900 --> 31:04.980
and speak to the conditions of the community

31:05.060 --> 31:08.100
and particularly related to violence but it isn't

31:08.180 --> 31:12.540
a specific indicator in the application, how would

31:12.620 --> 31:17.540
it actually be considered when judging and trying

31:17.620 --> 31:20.220
to determine who would receive the funding?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.140
Sure, thank you.

31:21.220 --> 31:22.100
That's a great question.

31:22.180 --> 31:26.500
So it would be addressed in the RFA itself in the

31:26.580 --> 31:30.580
rubric in terms of so evaluating the extent to

31:30.660 --> 31:35.100
which those LEAs applied for funds, the extent to

31:35.180 --> 31:39.220
which they're matching their proposed activities

31:39.300 --> 31:41.260
with what their needs are.

31:41.340 --> 31:44.180
And so if their needs are such that students are

31:44.260 --> 31:49.380
experiencing trauma and so forth associated with

31:49.460 --> 31:51.420
community violence, they would indicate that

31:51.500 --> 31:55.140
along with the local data that they're getting

31:55.180 --> 31:57.300
from that.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.100
So it would be built into the rubric for

32:00.180 --> 32:04.740
assessment, just we wouldn't be looking for a

32:04.820 --> 32:08.900
specific measure that they have to quote because

32:08.980 --> 32:10.900
there maybe isn't one across the entire state.

32:10.980 --> 32:12.100
That's correct.

32:12.180 --> 32:16.740
The current configuration of it that high need

32:16.820 --> 32:18.900
would be established through only those

32:18.980 --> 32:26.660
indicators that the CDE collects statewide to be

32:26.740 --> 32:27.500
fair.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.740
Got it, thank you.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.860
I think at this point I want to come back to

32:32.940 --> 32:36.540
Member Patilo Bronson about the data, the indicator

32:36.620 --> 32:38.380
that you were talking about, but we're all getting

32:38.460 --> 32:41.220
on the same page about that.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.340
Yeah, so the California Department of Healthcare

32:44.420 --> 32:48.620
Access and Information tracks firearm related

32:48.700 --> 32:51.780
hospitalizations, which I think is a particularly

32:51.860 --> 32:56.220
relevant measure of community violence in part

32:56.300 --> 32:57.980
because it's available statewide.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.220
It's at the zip code level.

32:59.300 --> 33:03.340
So school district could easily aggregate the data

33:03.420 --> 33:07.660
based on its zip codes in its attendance zones.

33:07.740 --> 33:13.460
But it also I think in some ways is a truer

33:13.460 --> 33:18.020
picture of a lack of community safety that kids

33:18.100 --> 33:19.420
experience in their lives.

33:22.100 --> 33:26.860
In my normal day job, I work on community violence

33:26.940 --> 33:30.460
initiatives and the White House, for example, had

33:30.540 --> 33:33.100
just hosted a community violence farm and

33:33.180 --> 33:36.540
initially looked at firearms incidences relating

33:36.620 --> 33:39.380
in death.

33:39.460 --> 33:43.220
But obviously when kids are shot, when people in a

33:43.220 --> 33:46.260
community are shot with regularity, that has an

33:46.340 --> 33:49.220
incredible impact on mental health, even if someone

33:49.300 --> 33:51.220
does not die.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.940
And so I think what's really helpful about the

33:54.020 --> 33:56.580
Department of Healthcare Access and Information's

33:56.660 --> 34:00.460
data on this topic is that it actually gives a fuller

34:00.540 --> 34:06.340
picture of gun violence that might be weighing on a

34:06.420 --> 34:10.700
kid's home environment, community environment.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.740
And I'd be happy to send the website links.

34:13.820 --> 34:15.980
And are you thinking to propose that that should

34:16.060 --> 34:18.860
be one of the criterion for eligibility?

34:18.940 --> 34:28.180
So I think it's a two part if on slide 12, I think

34:28.260 --> 34:32.420
basically the LCFF factors are kind of the first

34:32.500 --> 34:33.460
function.

34:33.540 --> 34:36.540
And then there's a list of additional characteristics

34:36.620 --> 34:38.700
around chronic absenteeism, exclusionary

34:38.780 --> 34:40.780
discipline.

34:40.860 --> 34:43.820
And my proposal would be to add gun related

34:43.900 --> 34:47.700
hospitalizations as a factor to be considered

34:47.780 --> 34:49.780
below that among the bullets.

34:52.140 --> 34:54.300
So that's the amendment you would like to make to the

34:54.380 --> 34:56.380
high need categories.

34:58.820 --> 35:01.100
I think one thing we would just like to note, if I

35:01.180 --> 35:05.620
may, is we do not know enough about the data set

35:05.660 --> 35:07.940
and would be challenged to figure out the overlay

35:08.020 --> 35:10.900
of zip code and LEA boundaries in a short

35:10.980 --> 35:12.580
timeline.

35:12.660 --> 35:14.820
However, again, that information could be

35:14.900 --> 35:17.620
utilized in the development of their narrative

35:17.700 --> 35:19.260
associated with the schools that they would be

35:19.340 --> 35:21.540
selecting to be considered for the application.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.100
So it is just something we'd want to make note of.

35:25.180 --> 35:28.860
I wonder, so there's criteria to apply, which is

35:28.940 --> 35:32.340
the front gate to get in.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.580
And I wonder whether schools that might be high

35:34.620 --> 35:36.940
need on this variable, which is the one that's

35:37.020 --> 35:40.820
most related to safety, might be excluded by the

35:40.900 --> 35:42.900
other criteria.

35:46.820 --> 35:50.860
Well, so one way to use this criterion is to say

35:50.940 --> 35:54.860
once you get in the door of these measures, then you

35:54.940 --> 36:01.340
can also speak to the gun related hospitalization

36:01.420 --> 36:02.420
rate.

36:02.580 --> 36:06.700
But I mean, this is just a pondering.

36:06.780 --> 36:08.980
There may be schools that have very high gun

36:09.060 --> 36:12.140
related hospitalization rates that would not be

36:12.220 --> 36:16.740
eligible based on these criteria.

36:16.820 --> 36:20.140
But there are communities, to your point, there are

36:20.220 --> 36:22.420
communities that could choose to use that data

36:22.500 --> 36:24.740
information to help explain their narrative for

36:24.820 --> 36:27.220
that selection of schools, while also considering

36:27.300 --> 36:29.060
the other indicators that we're proposing in the

36:29.140 --> 36:30.140
definition.

36:31.140 --> 36:37.580
These bullets below are not additive, right?

36:37.660 --> 36:42.340
They're not requiring in an application process

36:42.420 --> 36:44.860
that they have high rates of all of the bullets,

36:44.940 --> 36:45.940
right?

36:46.020 --> 36:47.020
That's correct.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.100
That's correct.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.100
It's the concentration of 80 percent or above of

36:51.180 --> 36:53.100
students from low income families, English learners

36:53.180 --> 36:56.620
and students in foster care, plus one of the

36:56.700 --> 36:57.700
following.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.500
So it would be any of those indicated there.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.340
And those would be determined by the state

37:02.420 --> 37:04.300
education data set.

37:04.380 --> 37:09.060
So are you comfortable with the notion that the

37:09.140 --> 37:13.420
criterion, maybe I shouldn't use the word

37:13.500 --> 37:18.940
criterion, that the consideration of the gun

37:19.020 --> 37:21.700
related hospitalization rate would come later as

37:21.780 --> 37:24.500
something that people could suggest?

37:24.740 --> 37:27.620
I think the current proposal already has that

37:27.700 --> 37:34.260
baked in as a later almost description that would

37:34.340 --> 37:36.580
be in the application.

37:36.660 --> 37:40.140
Part of why I'm pushing for it to be here is this is

37:40.220 --> 37:42.500
ostensibly a funding pot that's about community

37:42.580 --> 37:43.380
level violence.

37:43.460 --> 37:49.300
And I think it's important to have that lifted up.

37:49.380 --> 37:53.580
If a school district doesn't have ready access or

37:53.580 --> 37:56.460
has so many zip codes to pull that it feels

37:56.540 --> 37:58.340
onerous, they can certainly use any of these

37:58.420 --> 38:01.340
other criteria because there's already four that

38:01.420 --> 38:02.940
they could choose from.

38:03.020 --> 38:07.380
But I actually think that enabling a school

38:07.460 --> 38:13.740
district to share a more clear view of the levels

38:13.820 --> 38:17.220
of community violence that their students face is

38:17.300 --> 38:20.340
pretty important for a funding pot that's

38:20.380 --> 38:21.740
actually about community violence.

38:24.820 --> 38:25.780
Thank you for your comment.

38:25.860 --> 38:27.940
I just would want to again make note that we are

38:28.020 --> 38:30.580
trying, as we think about what eligibility looks

38:30.660 --> 38:33.500
like for all LEAs within the state, we want to

38:33.580 --> 38:35.540
assure that they had access to available

38:35.620 --> 38:39.460
statewide and comparable data that would equalize

38:39.540 --> 38:41.540
their ability to be eligible for this grant.

38:41.620 --> 38:44.140
So those were factors that were considered when

38:44.220 --> 38:46.140
these recommendations for the definition of high

38:46.220 --> 38:48.900
needs was determined.

38:48.980 --> 38:52.220
And again, recognize that there were other local

38:52.300 --> 38:54.620
information that could be shared at the time in

38:54.700 --> 38:57.140
development of their narrative within the LEA

38:57.220 --> 39:00.020
application process, RFA application process, that

39:00.100 --> 39:02.060
would allow us to have a better understanding of

39:02.140 --> 39:04.540
what some of the nuances that you're describing

39:04.620 --> 39:06.620
might look like in communities.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.780
Yes, Member Escobedo.

39:11.860 --> 39:18.860
And Trustee Bronson, I have similar feelings, but

39:18.940 --> 39:24.860
understanding that keeping the data consistent and

39:24.940 --> 39:27.980
for it to fit federal guidelines, I believe, is

39:28.060 --> 39:30.620
my understanding why these indicators were

39:30.700 --> 39:34.340
selected, although I completely on the same

39:34.420 --> 39:38.140
wavelength that you that we need to look at other

39:38.220 --> 39:39.420
local indicators.

39:39.500 --> 39:43.260
And obviously that can be, it could hopefully

39:43.340 --> 39:46.500
increase the level of awareness for those

39:46.540 --> 39:49.100
districts that are interested in applying for

39:49.180 --> 39:52.780
the grant, knowing full well that those specific

39:52.860 --> 39:56.940
indicators are really the gatekeepers for

39:57.020 --> 40:00.340
eligibility for this grant.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.900
So thank you for bringing that up.

40:01.980 --> 40:04.180
Really appreciate it.

40:04.260 --> 40:07.580
I see Member Yoshimoto-Tari.

40:07.660 --> 40:09.420
I just have a hard time hearing there's an echo

40:09.500 --> 40:11.900
on the side, so could you just repeat the name of

40:11.980 --> 40:14.140
the source of the data that you were suggesting,

40:14.220 --> 40:16.380
Member Bertillo-Bronson, please?

40:16.420 --> 40:18.700
It's the California Department of Health

40:18.780 --> 40:21.220
Care Access and Information.

40:21.300 --> 40:24.620
It used to be the California, it had a prior

40:24.700 --> 40:28.860
name until 2022.

40:28.940 --> 40:35.460
It used to be the Office of Statewide Health

40:35.540 --> 40:38.180
Planning and Development, and they changed their name.

40:38.180 --> 40:46.940
Is it not an official California government

40:47.020 --> 40:47.860
department?

40:47.940 --> 40:50.260
No, no, no, it's, I mean, it's a statewide

40:50.340 --> 40:53.300
department and it's statewide data, so it's

40:53.380 --> 40:56.380
got the data runs for the entire, it's got it by

40:56.460 --> 40:58.820
zip code across the state.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.380
I think what I'm hearing about the concern of our

41:02.460 --> 41:07.020
CDE colleagues is that that's not in what we

41:07.060 --> 41:09.620
would download generally from the state education

41:09.700 --> 41:12.500
database to determine who the eligible pool is,

41:12.580 --> 41:16.740
but I'm not all so clear why a district couldn't

41:16.820 --> 41:23.700
bring that and say, here is our bullet in the

41:23.780 --> 41:24.900
criterion.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.140
You know, we have more than 80% of what I think

41:27.220 --> 41:30.180
is on duplicate account students, and we have a

41:30.220 --> 41:36.340
very high rate of government-related

41:36.420 --> 41:39.340
hospitalizations and here's the data, you know,

41:39.420 --> 41:43.500
or here's the link to the data, whatever.

41:43.580 --> 41:46.460
So I'm not clear whether this is an

41:46.540 --> 41:50.940
inconvenience or a fatal flaw to bring in another

41:51.020 --> 41:52.620
agency's data.

41:52.700 --> 41:56.300
I ask the question because it is a California.gov

41:56.340 --> 42:02.140
URL, and I think at a higher, like 30,000 foot

42:02.220 --> 42:06.140
level, it, from a school site's perspective, I

42:06.220 --> 42:11.300
think agencies of the state can do a service to

42:11.380 --> 42:14.500
those of us working in different sectors to help

42:14.580 --> 42:15.900
integrate the data.

42:15.980 --> 42:18.140
So I'm hearing in this case that maybe these data

42:18.220 --> 42:20.940
aren't available by school district boundaries,

42:21.020 --> 42:23.540
they're only available by zip code as one of the

42:23.620 --> 42:24.620
barriers for us.

42:24.700 --> 42:27.940
But I think in a larger context, as we start

42:28.020 --> 42:30.860
thinking about integration of services and

42:30.940 --> 42:33.780
supports on behalf of schools, it's a larger

42:33.860 --> 42:36.980
ask to see if the Department of Education

42:37.060 --> 42:39.660
might be able to work with this department.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.980
And it may not be in time for this RFA, but to work

42:43.060 --> 42:45.020
with this department to see if there can be

42:45.100 --> 42:48.700
collaboration to get this kind of data in

42:48.780 --> 42:50.500
boundaries of our school districts and our LEAs.

42:50.580 --> 42:52.540
Well, let the districts be the ones who bring it

42:52.580 --> 42:57.420
with the evidence that they've assembled.

42:57.500 --> 43:00.660
There are occasional districts that are not,

43:00.740 --> 43:04.220
you know, that cut across partial zip codes,

43:04.300 --> 43:06.460
which is, you know, what is a little bit messy.

43:09.060 --> 43:12.140
But there also are plenty of districts that might,

43:12.220 --> 43:15.220
you know, qualify on this basis and, you know,

43:15.300 --> 43:18.420
would be very clean.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.500
So I think we want to be sure that that's in the

43:20.540 --> 43:22.500
consideration because these are interesting

43:22.580 --> 43:25.420
indicators, but they're not particularly tightly

43:25.500 --> 43:28.940
tied to community-related violence.

43:29.020 --> 43:30.660
And particularly with the chronic absenteeism

43:30.740 --> 43:33.420
indicator, which we talked about yesterday, you

43:33.500 --> 43:35.500
know, you could be identifying places that

43:35.580 --> 43:38.700
had a lot of snow or a lot of flooding, but that's

43:38.780 --> 43:42.740
not something that is, you know, necessarily

43:42.820 --> 43:46.540
connected to the need that they have for these

43:46.620 --> 43:47.540
resources.

43:48.300 --> 43:52.620
Yeah, and I think those are great considerations.

43:52.700 --> 43:55.660
The issue, I think, at hand is that sort of

43:55.740 --> 43:58.340
coordinating that data might push out the timeline

43:58.420 --> 44:00.860
further in terms of establishing the

44:00.940 --> 44:05.060
eligibility, in terms of getting the grant

44:05.140 --> 44:05.740
implemented.

44:05.820 --> 44:09.060
I would want to suggest, too, that there is so

44:09.140 --> 44:16.820
much great local data that is very, very related

44:16.860 --> 44:19.340
to the intent of the grant, and those are

44:19.420 --> 44:21.460
students' mental health needs, their

44:21.540 --> 44:25.300
perceptions of safety, their experience with

44:25.380 --> 44:30.180
trauma, their suicide ideation, their sorts of

44:30.260 --> 44:32.500
feelings of sadness and hopelessness and

44:32.580 --> 44:33.900
disconnected to their school.

44:33.980 --> 44:38.340
And we're seeing such strong data in this post

44:38.420 --> 44:41.100
COVID as students have returned.

44:41.180 --> 44:45.140
And this grant addresses those issues, and those

44:45.180 --> 44:49.100
local needs can be established in their RFA,

44:49.180 --> 44:51.500
along with the activities that they're

44:51.580 --> 44:55.420
suggesting to improve those outcomes.

44:58.020 --> 44:58.540
Yes.

45:02.540 --> 45:03.940
A clarifying question.

45:04.020 --> 45:07.460
Does the federal guidelines hold you to the

45:07.540 --> 45:10.900
80% threshold for the unduplicated count?

45:10.980 --> 45:13.180
I'm just thinking about maybe smaller, real

45:13.220 --> 45:16.220
small rural districts that may have difficulty

45:16.300 --> 45:19.260
reaching that 80%, but may have one of those

45:19.340 --> 45:21.220
other factors present.

45:21.300 --> 45:22.860
Is that a stronghold?

45:22.940 --> 45:27.260
No, that is something that the CDE could

45:27.340 --> 45:27.860
determine.

45:27.940 --> 45:33.340
So they don't, it's not, the 80% isn't a

45:33.420 --> 45:37.420
strict thing from the Department of Education.

45:37.940 --> 45:43.980
RFA to see if a district could apply if they're

45:44.060 --> 45:47.180
under the 80% threshold of a small rural district,

45:47.260 --> 45:49.540
and then it's just based on the application.

45:49.620 --> 45:50.300
I'm sorry.

45:50.380 --> 45:51.500
No, that's okay.

45:51.580 --> 45:52.260
Did you hear me?

45:52.340 --> 45:53.780
Did you hear the question?

45:53.860 --> 45:54.460
Yes.

45:54.540 --> 45:57.460
So the item in front of you today is actually to

45:57.540 --> 46:00.340
determine and approve the definition of HINIE,

46:00.420 --> 46:03.020
which would include that the LEA that applies

46:03.100 --> 46:06.060
must be at 80% or above.

46:06.100 --> 46:10.780
So consideration, if your question is, does the 80%

46:10.860 --> 46:16.340
have to be the threshold that we're recommending

46:16.420 --> 46:20.300
and SBE approves, that would be for discussion.

46:20.380 --> 46:22.060
That could be considered, but there is no federal

46:22.140 --> 46:24.100
guidance that mandates that it be 80%.

46:24.180 --> 46:25.700
It's our recommendation.

46:25.780 --> 46:29.620
Based on ensuring equity, conducting data runs and

46:29.700 --> 46:32.060
determining that there would be access for our

46:32.140 --> 46:35.060
rural school communities to have eligibility under

46:35.100 --> 46:38.740
this criteria at the time of submission.

46:38.820 --> 46:45.540
So the 522 that are listed there, they meet the 80%

46:45.620 --> 46:46.380
threshold?

46:46.460 --> 46:47.340
That is correct.

46:47.420 --> 46:50.060
Under those numbers provided to you, they not

46:50.140 --> 46:54.380
only meet the 80% and or they meet one of these

46:54.460 --> 46:56.260
recommended criteria.

46:56.340 --> 46:59.700
So that ensures that those numbers are actual

46:59.780 --> 47:02.100
numbers that ensure that that would be eligible

47:02.140 --> 47:05.580
LEA's who would be able to apply under the under

47:05.660 --> 47:09.220
this particular recommended definition of HINIE.

47:09.300 --> 47:09.820
Thank you.

47:12.180 --> 47:13.940
And I just sent you the website.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.180
Who?

47:17.940 --> 47:19.380
Actually, I sent it to Brooks.

47:19.460 --> 47:27.980
OK, so I guess we're at a point where we've

47:28.060 --> 47:31.260
raised a lot of considerations and we may

47:31.300 --> 47:32.100
need a motion.

47:37.380 --> 47:39.180
And I'm wondering if we should maybe make the

47:39.260 --> 47:42.580
motion around the recommendation with an

47:42.660 --> 47:45.620
encouragement to consider the ways in which this

47:45.700 --> 47:50.100
additional data could be incorporated so that they

47:50.180 --> 47:53.100
can really kick the tires on that.

47:53.180 --> 47:55.780
I appreciate that this is a real time discussion

47:55.860 --> 47:58.420
we're having and you guys have not had a chance to

47:58.460 --> 48:04.180
look at a sister agency's data, so I'd be happy to

48:04.260 --> 48:08.340
phrase it as a consideration of and provided

48:08.420 --> 48:10.460
it meets sort of the metrics that you all need

48:10.540 --> 48:12.900
for statewide comparability.

48:12.980 --> 48:14.180
I think that would be great.

48:15.660 --> 48:22.380
Sorry, so I am what are you doing to enable

48:22.460 --> 48:28.220
consideration of gun related violence metrics

48:28.340 --> 48:32.500
that are available through state agency reporting?

48:33.180 --> 48:34.940
And there's a couple of sources actually that

48:35.020 --> 48:37.820
track it so you can choose which one you like the

48:37.900 --> 48:38.500
best.

48:38.580 --> 48:41.860
So you're moving an amendment before we get to

48:41.940 --> 48:42.540
the motion.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.340
So I think we would then need a second for the

48:45.420 --> 48:48.740
amendment and then we can vote on the amendment

48:48.820 --> 48:50.140
and then we'll vote on the motion.

48:51.060 --> 48:51.660
Is that right?

48:51.740 --> 48:53.500
Or you want to fold that in with them?

48:53.580 --> 48:55.540
I guess we should not fold it in with the motion.

48:55.620 --> 48:56.700
Let's just vote on the amendment.

48:57.700 --> 49:01.020
She could vote the recommendation with that

49:01.100 --> 49:01.620
amendment.

49:02.140 --> 49:05.060
I will vote for in favor of the recommendation,

49:05.140 --> 49:06.940
which generally I think is fantastic.

49:07.020 --> 49:10.420
And with the amendment for consideration of gun

49:10.500 --> 49:15.380
related violence metrics to be included based on

49:15.900 --> 49:20.780
considerations of statewide data consistency as

49:20.860 --> 49:23.780
plausible as possible and per your discretion.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.260
And I would love to hear back actually.

49:27.700 --> 49:28.700
We have a motion.

49:28.780 --> 49:29.820
All right.

49:29.900 --> 49:30.620
Thank you.

49:31.020 --> 49:32.780
Any other discussion of the motion?

49:33.140 --> 49:35.420
All in favor say aye and raise your hand.

49:36.340 --> 49:36.980
All right.

49:37.060 --> 49:38.940
Any opposed nay.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.180
Any abstentions?

49:40.500 --> 49:41.220
Motion carries.

49:41.300 --> 49:42.180
Thank you very much.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.540
And with that, because we've done so much good

49:44.620 --> 49:46.260
work this morning, I'm going to give you a 15

49:46.340 --> 49:48.740
minute break and then we'll come back and finish

49:48.820 --> 49:49.820
our business for the day.

49:51.540 --> 49:53.500
We have a very relaxed schedule today.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.500
Hey, welcome back.

50:01.780 --> 50:04.260
We're going to move ahead with item 13.

50:06.180 --> 50:08.380
Item 13 is a public hearing regarding the

50:08.460 --> 50:10.460
appeal from an action of the Santa Clara County

50:10.540 --> 50:13.500
Committee on School District Organization to

50:13.580 --> 50:16.620
disapprove a petition to transfer territory from

50:16.700 --> 50:19.500
the San Jose Unified School District to the

50:19.580 --> 50:21.420
Oak Grove Elementary School District and the

50:21.500 --> 50:23.500
Eastside Union High School District.

50:24.500 --> 50:27.100
And this item will be presented by Larry Shirey

50:27.180 --> 50:27.900
of the CDE.

50:27.980 --> 50:29.300
Nice to see you again, Larry.

50:29.380 --> 50:30.220
You may begin.

50:32.140 --> 50:32.900
Thank you.

50:32.980 --> 50:33.820
Good morning, everyone.

50:33.900 --> 50:36.100
Again, Larry Shirey, School Facilities and

50:36.180 --> 50:37.860
Transportation Services Division.

50:38.860 --> 50:41.900
As you just heard, we have an appeal from the

50:41.980 --> 50:45.620
Santa Clara County territory transfer that

50:45.700 --> 50:47.820
was turned down by the county committee there.

50:48.060 --> 50:54.060
The transfer was to move two homes from San Jose

50:54.140 --> 50:58.260
Unified to Oak Grove Elementary and the

50:58.340 --> 51:00.540
Eastside Union High School District.

51:00.620 --> 51:02.740
At the time that they heard this locally, there

51:02.820 --> 51:04.340
was only one student involved.

51:04.420 --> 51:06.020
Currently, there are two.

51:06.100 --> 51:09.820
And the students in question have never, ever

51:09.900 --> 51:11.340
attended San Jose Unified.

51:11.420 --> 51:14.500
They've always been attending Oak Grove

51:14.580 --> 51:17.500
Elementary School or I think actually Evergreen

51:17.500 --> 51:19.940
Elementary School early on on inter-district

51:20.020 --> 51:20.940
transfers.

51:21.020 --> 51:24.980
So there are a couple of peripheral issues I'd

51:25.060 --> 51:27.580
like to address regarding this before we move

51:27.660 --> 51:29.620
into the actual consideration.

51:29.700 --> 51:32.980
One is that you may have read in the item that

51:33.060 --> 51:35.940
we're calling this uninhabited territory.

51:36.020 --> 51:39.580
That may seem a little odd since there are people

51:39.660 --> 51:41.940
living here, but uninhabited territory is a

51:42.020 --> 51:42.620
legal term.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.660
It's in the Education Code, the Government Code,

51:44.740 --> 51:46.300
Public Resources Code.

51:46.300 --> 51:49.740
And the purpose is just to identify very small

51:49.820 --> 51:54.780
areas and prevent absurd responses to them, like

51:54.860 --> 51:59.020
calling elections for two people, a county election

51:59.100 --> 51:59.940
for two people.

52:00.020 --> 52:02.340
For our purposes, it just means that the proposal

52:02.420 --> 52:05.900
gets started by an owner petition rather than a

52:05.980 --> 52:08.620
voter petition, a petition signed by 25% of the

52:08.700 --> 52:11.180
voters in the area.

52:11.260 --> 52:15.340
Secondly, as we discussed briefly yesterday, the

52:15.380 --> 52:17.500
department and your staff have been working

52:17.580 --> 52:20.980
diligently over the last 15 years to move

52:21.060 --> 52:24.620
reorganization items away from your responsibility.

52:24.700 --> 52:29.260
And the criterion for that are items that have

52:29.340 --> 52:32.700
state interest or don't have state interest.

52:32.780 --> 52:35.700
The most recent change we had was that the

52:35.780 --> 52:41.020
legislature has removed appeals of disapprovals

52:41.100 --> 52:47.660
of territory transfers from things that come to you.

52:47.740 --> 52:50.780
Basically, the legislature has stated that a

52:50.860 --> 52:53.860
disapproval of a territory transfer locally is not

52:53.940 --> 52:56.540
a state issue.

52:56.620 --> 52:59.100
Now, this appeal was filed before that legislation

52:59.180 --> 53:02.100
went into effect, so you've got to consider it

53:02.180 --> 53:05.380
despite the fact that the legislature has said it's

53:05.460 --> 53:06.460
not of interest to you.

53:06.460 --> 53:15.540
Petitioner reasons for the transfer, you can see

53:15.620 --> 53:19.540
the schools, the boundary line is the dark, heavy

53:19.620 --> 53:21.860
dark line that runs right through the middle there

53:21.940 --> 53:24.020
and the proposed transfer area is a little red

53:24.100 --> 53:27.860
triangle in the lower part of the screen and the

53:27.940 --> 53:31.860
schools in question are identified, outlined in

53:31.940 --> 53:34.060
red with little school houses.

53:34.100 --> 53:36.380
So the petitioner reason for transfer of San Jose

53:36.460 --> 53:39.740
Unified Schools are more distant.

53:39.820 --> 53:42.180
The schools in Oak Grove and Eastside Union High

53:42.260 --> 53:44.620
School are along the parents' daily commute

53:44.700 --> 53:46.780
routes.

53:46.860 --> 53:49.020
They work in that area, at least one of the parents

53:49.100 --> 53:51.180
work over in that area.

53:51.260 --> 53:52.700
And the residents believe they have a greater

53:52.780 --> 53:56.220
sense of community identity with Oak Grove

53:56.300 --> 53:58.820
Elementary and with the Eastside Union High

53:58.900 --> 54:01.340
School District.

54:01.420 --> 54:04.700
Now, at the risk of ruining the ending, we're

54:04.780 --> 54:08.300
going to recommend that you affirm the action of

54:08.380 --> 54:10.500
the county committee to disapprove this

54:10.580 --> 54:12.660
territory transfer and I'll bring this

54:12.740 --> 54:14.740
recommendation up again later.

54:17.140 --> 54:18.660
All the affected school districts are pretty

54:18.740 --> 54:21.980
large districts and if you look at district-wide

54:22.060 --> 54:25.820
comparisons based on racial, ethnic and SES

54:25.900 --> 54:27.820
issues, there's not a whole lot of difference.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.620
Certainly there are some differences but the

54:29.660 --> 54:34.300
districts look relatively similar when we look at

54:34.380 --> 54:36.980
these issues on a district-wide basis.

54:37.060 --> 54:39.060
We'll come back to school-wide comparisons a

54:39.140 --> 54:41.140
little later.

54:44.300 --> 54:46.820
You might recall from previous reorganization

54:46.900 --> 54:51.420
issues that there are nine minimum standards that

54:51.500 --> 54:54.500
a district reorganization have to meet before the

54:54.580 --> 54:56.660
county committee or the state board to consider

54:56.740 --> 55:00.220
whether or not to approve the reorganization.

55:00.300 --> 55:02.940
The county committee found that all nine of those

55:03.020 --> 55:06.500
standards were substantially met but again,

55:06.580 --> 55:10.980
these standards are not the criteria for approval

55:11.060 --> 55:13.180
of a territory transfer.

55:13.260 --> 55:15.620
Once the thresholds are determined to be met, the

55:15.700 --> 55:19.620
county committee needed to examine the issues and

55:19.700 --> 55:22.140
find out whether or not there was a compelling

55:22.220 --> 55:24.220
reason to transfer this territory.

55:27.660 --> 55:30.500
In our review of the information,

55:30.580 --> 55:32.820
county committee discussed no compelling reason to

55:32.900 --> 55:33.820
approve.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.860
In fact, they did discuss, one thing they did

55:36.940 --> 55:40.020
discuss was that inter-district transfer

55:40.100 --> 55:42.980
agreements which the parents currently are using

55:43.060 --> 55:45.740
are the more appropriate response to the issues

55:45.820 --> 55:49.140
that the homeowners have here.

55:49.220 --> 55:51.220
The county committee then disapproved the transfer.

55:51.220 --> 55:56.900
All three affected school districts oppose the

55:56.980 --> 55:59.420
transfer, San Jose Unified, Eastside High School

55:59.500 --> 56:01.220
District, Union High School District and the

56:01.300 --> 56:03.300
Oak Grove Elementary School District.

56:03.380 --> 56:06.820
Primarily they're concerned that these piecemeal

56:06.900 --> 56:09.620
transfers just aren't the way to deal with

56:09.700 --> 56:11.660
parental preferences.

56:11.740 --> 56:14.180
Boundary changes are not like flipping a switch,

56:14.260 --> 56:16.140
boundaries change.

56:16.220 --> 56:19.140
A lot of work goes into a boundary change and when

56:19.780 --> 56:22.660
you're doing that with just parental preferences

56:22.740 --> 56:25.140
for one school or one school district over the

56:25.220 --> 56:27.860
other, it doesn't make sense to use a territory

56:27.940 --> 56:29.300
transfer process.

56:29.380 --> 56:30.820
And again, the inter-district attendance

56:30.900 --> 56:35.980
agreements which the districts all give freely.

56:36.060 --> 56:39.740
San Jose Unified approves over a thousand

56:39.820 --> 56:43.180
inter-district transfers every year.

56:43.260 --> 56:45.460
The parents in this group have gotten transfers

56:45.540 --> 56:48.420
from the district approved every year.

56:48.500 --> 56:50.940
Oak Grove and Eastside state, hey, you know,

56:51.020 --> 56:52.540
we're in declining enrollment, we're not

56:52.620 --> 56:54.700
going to turn students down.

56:54.780 --> 56:56.860
Basically the only reason that they're going to

56:56.940 --> 57:00.460
turn down or disapprove inter-district transfer

57:00.540 --> 57:02.580
agreement according to what they say is if there

57:02.660 --> 57:07.460
are some disciplinary issues with the students.

57:07.540 --> 57:09.060
And additionally, even though they don't think

57:09.140 --> 57:11.500
there are any real general issues or community

57:11.580 --> 57:14.940
wide issues here, if there are, moving to homes

57:15.020 --> 57:16.180
doesn't address them.

57:16.220 --> 57:19.060
It just simply moves the boundary a couple

57:19.140 --> 57:20.140
of homes over.

57:23.420 --> 57:25.940
The appellants had, or the petitioners had two

57:26.020 --> 57:28.620
primary reasons in their appeal.

57:28.700 --> 57:31.260
One is they were denied due process.

57:31.340 --> 57:33.380
They didn't feel that the county committee told

57:33.460 --> 57:34.780
them why they're disapproving the

57:34.860 --> 57:36.180
territory transfer.

57:36.260 --> 57:38.620
They didn't get a written response from the

57:38.700 --> 57:43.980
county committee regarding the reasons for the

57:44.060 --> 57:46.300
procedural issues such as that.

57:46.380 --> 57:47.740
And they didn't believe that the county

57:47.820 --> 57:49.940
committee members used facts to make their

57:50.020 --> 57:52.860
decisions, that they substituted personal opinions.

57:52.940 --> 57:56.460
Well, you know, the education code identifies

57:56.540 --> 57:58.300
things that can be appealed.

57:58.380 --> 58:00.500
These procedural issues are not things that can

58:00.580 --> 58:01.660
be appealed.

58:01.740 --> 58:05.740
Regardless, we took a look at the concerns and we

58:05.820 --> 58:09.980
find there's no basis even for these reasons.

58:10.060 --> 58:13.060
They weren't denied due process.

58:13.100 --> 58:15.980
County committee members, just like state board

58:16.060 --> 58:21.060
members, can approve or disapprove a reorganization

58:21.140 --> 58:23.300
for any reason.

58:23.380 --> 58:26.260
One thing that I'm sure you know is that the

58:26.340 --> 58:30.020
legislature, through the Constitution, is given

58:30.100 --> 58:33.700
responsibility for district boundaries in the state.

58:33.780 --> 58:36.900
They have turned that over to you and to the

58:36.980 --> 58:37.900
county committee.

58:37.980 --> 58:40.500
So anything that you do regarding district

58:40.540 --> 58:43.860
organization is a quasi-legislative proceeding.

58:43.940 --> 58:46.820
You don't have to really, I mean, basically you

58:46.900 --> 58:48.900
don't have to explain yourself.

58:58.260 --> 59:00.940
Okay, so again I mentioned the county committee

59:01.020 --> 59:04.300
found that all the minimum standards were met.

59:04.380 --> 59:07.540
We're not going to look at those because we agree

59:07.620 --> 59:08.460
that they've met.

59:08.500 --> 59:10.700
The petitioners aren't arguing that issue.

59:10.780 --> 59:13.500
The districts don't take any issue with those

59:13.580 --> 59:14.180
findings.

59:14.260 --> 59:17.060
So all we're going to say is we concur with the

59:17.140 --> 59:24.620
findings of the county committee on the 35753

59:24.700 --> 59:26.180
minimum standards.

59:26.260 --> 59:30.780
But again, meeting those standards is not the

59:30.860 --> 59:34.900
reason that you use to approve a reorganization.

59:34.980 --> 59:37.500
The legislature has given us some intent.

59:37.580 --> 59:40.220
Local educational needs and concerns will serve as

59:40.300 --> 59:42.540
a basis for future reorganization of

59:42.620 --> 59:44.100
districts in each county.

59:44.180 --> 59:48.060
So we need to look at reasons beyond the nine

59:48.140 --> 59:52.140
minimum standards to approve a territory transfer.

59:55.060 --> 59:57.460
To approve it, you need to reverse the local action

59:57.540 --> 59:59.900
to disapprove.

59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.860
And two of the reasons to reverse have been

01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:04.940
supplied by the petitioners.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:06.500
They believe they have a greater sense of

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.020
community with the Oak Grove Elementary School

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:10.660
District and the Eastside Union High School

01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.700
District.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:14.780
And commutes to schools in Oak Grove and Eastside

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:18.500
are closer than our commutes to the schools

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:20.300
in San Jose Unified.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.300
We'll look at those two.

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.540
We have a yellow boundary line between the

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:28.420
district, a blue oval showing the two homes.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.660
Regarding community identity, we have a

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:35.420
difficult time seeing how those two homes have a

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.100
greater sense of community identity with the homes

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.740
to the east of them compared to the homes to

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.420
the west of them or across the street.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.460
It's just for us, that's a non-issue.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.980
Commutes to schools, as you can see here, as you

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:56.460
saw earlier, San Jose Unified schools are more

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.860
distant than Oak Grove Elementary schools.

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.060
But I mentioned there at the bottom of the slide

01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:05.540
that the differences do not meet local standards

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.140
for extreme hardship.

01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:08.860
Here's what I mean by that.

01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:12.900
Santa Clara County is kind of the center of

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.380
territory transfers in the state of California.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.940
You've heard 76 territory transfer appeals since

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.700
1994.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.380
28 of them, more than a third, have come, have

01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:27.180
involved Santa Clara County.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:28.900
So they have a lot of experience with

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:30.620
territory transfer issues.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.980
Almost every territory transfer proposal that

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:38.260
comes forward to them addresses issues of

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.100
schools being closer in the adjacent district.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:45.900
And that's true, almost any boundary you have.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.580
You go north from the transfer area up until

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:53.700
where the boundary cuts over west, you're going

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.980
to find homes in the Oak Grove and the Eastside

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.820
Junior High School District that are closer to

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.940
San Jose Unified schools than they are to Oak

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:05.180
Grove and San Jose and Eastside Junior High

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:05.780
School Districts.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.180
That's the nature of boundaries.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.500
Whether it's a school district or a city, it's

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.220
always going to be something on the other

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.060
side of the boundary that's closer to you than

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.500
what you have in your own city, your own district.

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:21.300
So in response to that understanding and the

01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.860
sheer volume of territory transfers the County

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.140
Committee has dealt with, they came up with their

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:29.020
own local standards for what constitutes a

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.060
hardship for parents in terms of distance traveled.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.900
And these distances do not beat the local

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:36.980
standards for hardship.

01:02:41.660 --> 01:02:46.020
So we don't see any reason to overturn the County

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.980
Committee's decision, but we do have a couple of

01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:52.500
concerns that support that decision to disapproved

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:53.980
the territory transfer.

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:56.860
And these are issues we bring up almost every time.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:59.820
The reorganization moves students into schools

01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.740
with higher socioeconomic status.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.300
And the reorganization could establish a precedent

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.900
for future reorganizations.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:12.540
I mentioned earlier that district-wide, the

01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.540
districts don't look that different.

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:16.700
But if you look at the actual schools that serve

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.940
the area and that would serve the area, there is a

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:20.460
big difference.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:22.500
This is very similar to what you dealt with last

01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:25.900
November when we had an Orange County transfer

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.780
appeal.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.540
Just looking at the elementary school, the San

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:34.340
Jose Unified Elementary School is 60%

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:38.780
socioeconomically disadvantaged versus 11%

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:40.700
at the Oak Grove Elementary School.

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:45.220
27% English language learners versus 15%.

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.500
58% eligibility for free and reduced price meals

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.140
versus 11% or 10.5%.

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.220
And those differences are constant throughout the

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.420
school types and across the different

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.340
socioeconomic indicators.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:04.100
So that's a concern.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:07.460
We always have that as a concern.

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.860
A precedent for future transfers, this is not a

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:13.860
real big issue, but whenever you're using the

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.940
territory transfer process to address individual

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:21.060
parental preferences and you have, and that becomes

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.180
kind of wide knowledge.

01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:25.860
If it becomes successful, then you do have the

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.820
possibility that other individual families are

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.940
going to use this process to get to the schools

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:37.260
they want, especially when you have schools that

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.060
you can transfer into that are of a higher

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.180
socioeconomic status.

01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.180
So it's not a big issue, but it's still a concern

01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:46.860
that we deal with.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:47.660
Let's skip that one.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:49.100
I've already kind of touched on it.

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.740
So finally, our findings.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.860
Again, all the minimum standards are met.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.980
County committee found no compelling reasons for

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.620
approval while considering the fact that

01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.860
inter-district attendance permits are a more

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.420
appropriate response for the parents' issues as

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.300
the same opinion the school districts have.

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.860
The appellants presented no valid reasons for their

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.820
appeal, and the CDE, we do not find any reason or

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.860
concern compelling enough to reverse the county

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.860
committee disapproval of the transfer, but we do

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:27.100
identify some reasons that we think support that

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:29.260
decision of the county committee.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.420
And so we think the local disapproval should be

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.780
allowed to stand.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.820
Again, our recommendation is that you affirm the

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.620
action of the county committee to disapprove

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.140
the proposal to transfer territory from the

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.820
San Jose Unified School District to the Oak Grove

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.020
Elementary School District and the East Side

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.740
Junior High School District.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:50.020
Be happy to take any clarifying questions if

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:50.940
you have any.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.180
If not, I'll be here to answer other questions

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.260
following the public hearing.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:00.900
I think we're going to, at this point, open the

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:06.340
public hearing at 10.55 a.m.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.860
And we will hear from the petitioners who are in

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.460
favor of the territory transfer.

01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:13.060
They'll have 10 minutes to make their presentation.

01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.380
I understand they'll be presenting virtually.

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.060
And after the presentation, we'll open up the

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:19.140
phone line for public comment and also take

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.020
public comment in the boardroom for those who

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:24.220
are not part of either presentation.

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:29.740
If the petitioners are queued up, you may begin.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.820
Do we have the petitioners?

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.420
There we go.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:35.820
Hi there, can you hear me?

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:36.500
Yes, we can.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.740
Thank you very much.

01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:38.660
Yes.

01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.420
Perfect.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:41.700
Sorry, just for consideration, would you be

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.220
bringing up the presentation I shared with

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.380
Mr. Larry earlier?

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:49.780
Would you be bringing that up?

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:50.700
I believe it's coming up.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.740
Thank you.

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:53.340
Perfect.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.260
I just was trying to understand the process.

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.860
Thank you.

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:00.020
There you go.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:00.460
Perfect.

01:07:00.540 --> 01:07:00.940
Thank you.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.620
Thank you very much for your time and this

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.420
opportunity to speak to you.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.780
We appreciate the process that has been put

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.100
forward to enable this.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:13.580
Please let me preface this, that the contents are

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:17.260
specific to our situation and needs.

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:21.700
It's been over three years since this appeal was

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:24.380
made and lots has changed.

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:26.620
This difficult and trying time was not easy for

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:27.300
anyone.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.860
The sudden disruption of routine in the world of

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:32.940
children resulted in anxiety for many children,

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.220
including ours, something we're still trying to

01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.540
recover from.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.260
Our neighborhood relationships became stronger

01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:43.820
and this became more evident as our eldest

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:46.180
started attending Oak Grove School District on

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.500
your transfer.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.900
These types of activities where you have

01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.540
interaction of children, even though they've only

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.420
met each other over springtime or as they're

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.780
walking by your neighbor, they're only possible

01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:06.820
when you live within the school community in which

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.020
you reside.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:13.180
These activities have carried out and established

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:15.420
long relationships with our neighbors and other

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.900
members of the community.

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:21.500
Could we go to slide two, please?

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.060
During the county meetings, we heard the school

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.300
district officials mention that they want

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:28.940
consistency and reliability.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:31.900
And just like the school district, we too are

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.100
seeking consistency and reliability for our

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:34.780
children.

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:37.660
We're a block of four homes that have been

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:40.100
separated into two separate districts.

01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.300
So we are four neighboring homes with a fence line

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.740
that divides the school boundaries.

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:49.180
The experiences of the children in the two

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:51.340
homes from those on the other side of the fence

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.340
are different simply because of where the

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.620
fence line lies.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.420
This Oak Grove Eastside Union High School District

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.220
has provided routine familiarity and a strong

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:05.100
sense of community, belonging and friendships

01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:07.580
that started during COVID and continue to flourish

01:09:07.660 --> 01:09:08.980
today.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.740
We request you please to allow this transfer so

01:09:11.820 --> 01:09:14.780
that we can continue to thrive with certainty.

01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.020
Our request is about our families and doing what

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.260
is right for our kids.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.860
It is difficult to explain and understand why a

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.580
block of homes would be divided into two separate

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:30.980
districts by moving these two homes into Oak Grove

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.260
and Eastside Union High School District.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:35.540
The current fence line boundary would move to

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.900
where Colleen Drive intersects the Valley

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.340
Glen Drive, uniting the four homes under the same

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:43.420
school district.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:46.700
Next slide, please.

01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:49.460
This image is very similar to the one that was

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:53.700
provided by Mr. Larry, just a little bit different

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.980
in terms of the visuals.

01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.660
A is where our homes are located and everything in

01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:03.780
blue is showing the physical locations of the

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.180
three Oak Grove and Eastside Union High School

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.100
District schools.

01:10:09.180 --> 01:10:10.900
Please note this isn't exaggerated.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.660
It looks, as you just saw from Mr. Larry, it looks

01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.500
almost identical to what he was presenting with the

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:19.860
exception of the colors.

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.940
Being able to attend a school in your

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.820
neighborhood, in our neighborhood, has allowed

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.020
us to have greater participation in school

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:30.220
related activities for the children as well as us

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.300
as parents.

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.060
We've learned so much more about the communities

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:35.020
and the school.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.620
Since actively attending within Oak Grove School

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.620
District, we were hoping for a great school

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:46.100
experience for the kids when we first filed for

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.460
the territory transfer.

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:50.500
But since actually being able to attend Oak Grove

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:55.500
School District, the experience proved to be

01:10:55.540 --> 01:10:58.340
beyond what we had imagined.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.660
The positive and thriving environment would not be

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.700
possible when attending the assigned schools of

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.420
San Jose Unified School District.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:12.060
The closest school is further than the

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:15.980
furthest of Oak Grove and Eastside Union High,

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:19.140
thus requiring us to drive our children to and

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:20.660
from school.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.820
There are no safe or commutable ways by which

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:26.860
children could walk or bike to these schools.

01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:28.740
Not only are these schools not within our

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:31.140
community, each of the assigned schools are

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:33.940
located within three separate communities with

01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:36.460
no real connection with each other or the

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.780
community of which we live in.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.780
The assigned middle school, as you can see on

01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:44.180
the bottom left of the slide, is a commute that

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:48.420
requires travel over the hills into Elmenden Valley.

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:56.220
This is a commute that is completely removed from

01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.500
anything that we, anywhere we go, anything we do.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.020
This is not a neighborhood that we even

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:03.860
travel through or have gone through.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.340
The assigned high school, seen at the top of the

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:10.500
slide, requires travel on major streets and at one

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:13.900
point would require children on bikes or

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.500
walking to have to cross a freeway access road

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.660
that's requiring us to drive our children daily

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:21.500
to and from school.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.700
Prior to transferring into the Oak Grove School

01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.340
District, we were on a transfer, as Mr. Larry

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:29.660
mentioned, into Evergreen School District, again,

01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:32.980
another school outside the neighborhood in which

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:36.500
we reside, which truly gave us an understanding of

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.820
the stark difference in attending a school within

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.940
your community versus a school completely

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:45.820
isolated from the community in which you reside.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.700
When the safest and most reliable and healthiest

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.340
solution is all within walking distance from

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.780
within our neighborhood, why create uncertainty

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:56.700
and inconsistencies?

01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:59.660
As mentioned previously by both within this

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:02.660
presentation and by Mr. Larry, we are currently

01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:04.380
on inter-district transfers between

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.620
funds they unified in Oak Grove.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.660
The children walk to and from school along with

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:11.660
their peers and friends and this experience has

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.060
been, again, much more amazing than we could

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.220
have imagined.

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:19.060
The inter-district transfer is not a long-term

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.500
solution for us.

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.580
This is, there is no certainty.

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.540
The transfer criteria only identifies criteria for

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.620
school ages K through five, the transfer nor the

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.700
criteria provide a solution or a path to

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.180
finishing elementary school or anything beyond

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.700
fifth grade.

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:43.180
The only eligibility criteria that we meet today

01:13:43.260 --> 01:13:45.420
is that I am employed within the Oak Grove

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:47.820
School District boundaries and jobs are never

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:48.620
guaranteed.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.420
What happens to the transfer criteria for future

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:55.740
years or if my employment ends or changes?

01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:01.100
To the, oh sorry, I'm on the next slide, I apologize.

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.140
There we go.

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.220
Sorry about that.

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:07.060
The solution is unreliable.

01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:10.340
These transfers are annual application process

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.740
with no guarantees of acceptance year over

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.180
year.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:19.300
Yes, you know, folks will mention that you're in,

01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.460
but there's no written assurance of parents.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:26.740
There's no 100% guarantee understood that it may be

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.540
based on, you know, the child and if they have any

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.820
issues within school.

01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:40.020
But even having that in writing is not available.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:46.180
Children are, sorry, and the other unreliability on

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:50.700
this is that by the time the school district notify

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.540
you of approval, it's too late to sign up for

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.620
after school programs or care as enrollment for

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:03.700
that happens much earlier in the year versus when

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.060
receipt of acceptance is provided.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:12.700
Children are also at a disadvantage when they're

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:16.500
on an inter-district school transfer for

01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:18.060
district-based programming.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:23.620
A preference is given and first choice is given to

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.340
those children who reside within the school

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:29.220
district boundaries.

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.300
So the resident children are provided the preference

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.540
for first choice.

01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.620
But next slide, please.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.340
So we believe that the Santa Clara County

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:46.540
Committee did not make the right decision as it is

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.300
difficult to understand how this could be rejected

01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.700
if the facts including the recommendations of the

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.180
county office were considered.

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:57.300
The committee did not, either in writing or

01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:02.100
verbally, provide any evidence or explanation or

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:04.260
reasoning for the rejection.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.700
Upon leaving the meeting, we were confused and still

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.980
don't understand what the grounds for rejection was

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:11.980
or were.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:15.220
What we recall of the discussion among the

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:17.460
committee members was their personal experience

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.300
as school-aged children.

01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.020
It was not apparent how the decision took into

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.860
consideration the uniqueness of this boundary

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.940
and or the findings of the county itself.

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:34.780
The Santa Clara County office clearly demonstrated

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.780
or concluded that all the criteria, as Mr. Larry

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.940
mentioned, was met, that the number of school-aged

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:45.100
children who could live in these two homes would not

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:49.660
significantly impact enrollment at the districts.

01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:53.180
The declining enrollment in both Oak Grove and

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.220
Eastside Union within the transfer barrier

01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:00.820
demonstrates no negative impact and, as parents

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.180
involved in the school site council, declining

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.180
enrollment has been an ongoing discussion.

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.780
In the corner of Colleen Drive and Valley Glen

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:12.580
Drive, the cul-de-sac.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:14.660
Sorry to interrupt, your time is up.

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.540
OK, thank you very much.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.740
We appreciate it.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.420
At this point, we do want to open up the phone line

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.540
for public comment.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:38.220
We know they're not going to be here, but I would

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.940
like to make a brief statement on the part of

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:42.340
San Jose Unified.

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:46.420
There is a San Jose Unified staff member available

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.980
for questions, but the district superintendent

01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:53.420
has told me that the district really has no

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:55.700
new information to present beyond what you've

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.900
already heard.

01:17:56.980 --> 01:18:00.460
So unless they don't think that a repetition of

01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:03.100
arguments and information has already been

01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:06.660
presented to you is an appropriate use of time,

01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:09.380
so they're not going to be taking part in the

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.940
public hearing.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.620
Similarly, neither Oak Grove nor Eastside will be

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:15.580
presenting.

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:18.460
OK, thank you.

01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:21.100
So at this point, we will open the phone line for

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:21.900
public comment.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:25.060
We need the public comment slide and we'll also

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:27.540
take public comment in the boardroom for those who

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:31.100
were not part of either presentation.

01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:34.700
And so let's see if there's anybody who wants to

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:37.420
make public comment.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:41.260
There is no public comment in the boardroom.

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:44.180
And is there any public comment on the phone?

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:46.980
There are no callers in the queue.

01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.220
OK, yes, hello.

01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:52.300
We do have somebody.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:59.620
Yes, actually, I'm the owner of the property 74.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.860
So but I do not prepare the presentation because my

01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:07.020
neighbor already prepared the presentation ready

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.820
and represented me ready.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.780
But I would like to take a couple of minutes to

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:16.660
emphasize my concerns.

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:18.100
I'm sorry, sir.

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.380
You have already 10 minutes, so you do have one

01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:23.100
minute if you'd like to speak.

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:26.420
But you only have one minute.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.580
OK, hello.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:29.260
Is it me?

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.940
Go ahead and proceed.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.500
Yeah, so I would like to emphasize the current

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:36.940
school district boundary.

01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:41.660
It's actually all my property virtually plus my

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:43.300
fence.

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.620
So this boundary divided the small neighborhood

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:50.540
basically four house to the two parties.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.340
It's not a logic and no sense, you know, for

01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:56.420
schools, school district divided by the supposed

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.380
divided by the, you know, ideally the physical

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.700
street.

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:05.060
So the community seems is broken.

01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:07.820
For example, the two two house kids, you know,

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.420
played together, but they went to the different

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.460
school later on.

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.580
That was not good.

01:20:14.620 --> 01:20:19.300
Also, school are, you know, far away from my homes

01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:22.820
across major basing, you know, the basis tree,

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.660
even freeway.

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:30.020
It has no safe for parents and for children with

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.420
a busy traffic.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:37.220
But the school are all the walk distance, sir.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:39.260
Your time is up.

01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:41.460
Thank you.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.460
And that concludes public comment for item number

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.540
13.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.100
So this point I want to open, I want to close the

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.940
public hearing at 1110 a.m.

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:58.300
And then we will begin board discussion.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.980
I'd first like to ask our liaison member Escobedo

01:21:01.060 --> 01:21:02.980
if he would like to make some initial comments.

01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:08.420
I believe the presentation is very clear.

01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.900
We're looking at two homes, both the county and

01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.860
the district feels that you stay close to your

01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:15.700
mic so we can hear.

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.940
There shouldn't be any any changes to the

01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:18.620
boundaries.

01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.860
And then really, I mean, I think the

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.420
presentation was very clear.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.700
Thank you so much for for all the information you

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.140
provided.

01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:32.100
Any thoughts or comments?

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:35.140
I think we're ready now for clarifying questions

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:36.220
and board discussions.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:40.660
So, yes, as President Glover would.

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:43.260
Just a couple of questions in relation to the

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.140
boundary itself.

01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:47.340
If I'm understanding the presentation correctly,

01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.300
this is a boundary that is not set by a street,

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.580
but by a fence line.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.860
Is that correct, Mr. Sharpe?

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.460
Correct.

01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:58.820
Let me just go back a moment here.

01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:05.620
Right, the boundary is there.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:09.060
You can't see it here, but the boundary, it runs

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.060
because it's a property line there south of Colleen

01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:15.700
Drive is a property line between two homes.

01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:20.460
OK, and can you tell me, do we happen to know when

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.300
that district boundary was drawn?

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.140
Was it drawn prior to the homes in that area and

01:22:26.180 --> 01:22:29.700
the homes in question, or was that boundary line

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:32.180
drawn after those homes were existing?

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.300
I wouldn't know that specifically.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.580
My guess is, though, just by looking at the

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:39.980
boundary line, since it's not, it's at the top

01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.500
there, it's running along the rear property line

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.500
of homes on two streets on either side.

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:50.100
It's the property line and it's running along a

01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:53.660
parcel line that it's highly likely that the

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:57.460
boundary was drawn after the homes were built.

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.900
Because otherwise, parcels would be split and it

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.820
wouldn't be that clean distinction.

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.180
But that's just without knowing for sure, that

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.620
would be my guess.

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.540
OK, thank you.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.620
Thank you.

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:19.380
Any questions or comments?

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.140
I guess I'd love to hear, since we haven't heard

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.380
from the district or the county, the plaintiff

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:31.980
asked the question, like, what is the reason that

01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:35.820
they wanted to deny the request?

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.180
And there seemed to be lack of clarity about that.

01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.260
Maybe you could clear that up.

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:41.980
Do you want to speak with the district

01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.980
representative on that?

01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:44.980
I can answer.

01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:46.980
Representing their views, yeah.

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:50.980
In terms of inter-district transfer requests, I

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.580
am not quite sure, I don't quite understand the

01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.660
concerns that were raised by the appellant in

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:59.820
indicating that the process is not available

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.860
after fifth grade.

01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:03.460
Inter-district transfers are for all grade levels,

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:04.300
K through 12.

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:07.700
I'm sure most of you know that.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:11.700
Regarding her concern that the transfer process

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.740
for her is going to end at fifth grade, if she's

01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:18.460
got an employment-based inter-district transfer,

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.940
what we used to call the Allen Bill transfers,

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.300
those are in statute.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:27.420
Once you get them, you don't have to reapply.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.340
So I'm not quite understanding what's going

01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:33.220
on there, and they're good until 12th grade.

01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.740
In the case of Oak Grove School District, they're

01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:39.100
not a 9-12 district, but they're good for the

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.580
entire attendance of the students.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:46.860
In terms of, I think you were asking why, about

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.700
denials or disapprovals of transfers?

01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.740
Well, no, about the idea of moving the territory

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.180
boundary.

01:24:56.260 --> 01:24:57.540
That's what's being...

01:24:57.620 --> 01:25:00.140
I'm sorry, I'm having trouble hearing it.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.380
Why the, sorry?

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.620
I know.

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:09.780
I have old ears, so I'm sorry.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.180
The disapproval of the request to move the

01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:18.300
boundary, which appears to be between, you know,

01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:23.820
across the fence line in a small neighborhood,

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:27.780
what the rationale was for that disapproval?

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:30.420
The rationale primarily was that there's no

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:35.860
compelling reason to do it, and that's...

01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:38.700
All the conditions are met, and it's the

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.420
responsibility of the county committee to find a

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:44.260
reason to transfer the territory.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.900
They didn't find a reason.

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:48.900
And really, the process can end there.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:50.460
There's no reason to do it.

01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:52.300
We're going to disapprove it.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:55.540
But they also indicated that, you know, this is

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:58.980
not the appropriate way to use territory transfers,

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:02.260
that the district transfer process is the more

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:04.460
appropriate way to deal with the individual

01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:08.500
preferences of the family and their desires for

01:26:08.540 --> 01:26:11.620
one school district over another.

01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.300
Ben?

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:16.100
Yes, Vice President Glover-Woods?

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.980
Oh, I want you to finish your sentence.

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.300
I'm done.

01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:23.380
OK.

01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:26.300
I'm still having a little bit of difficulty,

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.060
and I definitely appreciate the inter-district

01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:32.660
transfer process for preference, most definitely.

01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:36.700
And I also appreciate the comments that were given

01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:41.860
by the person who was presenting in regards to

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:46.220
some of the challenges with approvals of transfers

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:48.140
and the timelines for some of the other things

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:50.780
that you can avail yourself of.

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:53.780
I want to try to get some clarification with where

01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:57.220
I'm struggling here, and to be very honest, it's

01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.940
the way the boundary line is drawn and how it's

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.020
dividing the block.

01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:10.460
That is, I think this is where I'm a little bit

01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:15.940
challenged to understand why there's no compelling

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:20.620
reason when we're dividing a block in this way,

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:22.940
especially if that line was drawn after those

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:28.380
houses were already there, if that is indeed the case.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:31.420
Well, you know, I don't know if you can really

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:35.380
see it clearly here, but the petitioners, the

01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:39.900
appellants talked about four homes, two on, and we

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.860
can't pull up their petition, their

01:27:42.940 --> 01:27:45.740
presentation right now, two homes on one side of

01:27:45.820 --> 01:27:48.220
the boundary, two homes on the other side of the

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.540
boundary, and then on the one side of the two

01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.660
homes, there's a cul-de-sac.

01:27:54.740 --> 01:27:57.180
On the other side of the other two homes is

01:27:57.220 --> 01:28:03.780
another cul-de-sac, and their issue is that we

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:08.380
should, it's hard to describe without being

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.540
able to show it to you, but it's going to divide

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:14.340
the community no matter where the boundary is

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:16.100
going to go.

01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:21.180
If you do what they want, it's still going to

01:28:21.260 --> 01:28:23.820
separate homes in that community from one

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:25.860
district to another.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.060
Well, here it is, yeah, here it is.

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:33.380
So, as you see here, 786, 784, 782, 780, the

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.420
boundary, current boundaries in red divides

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.900
those four homes.

01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:41.780
On the west side, 6204 and 6208 are homes on the

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:44.140
Valley Glen Drive, which is a cul-de-sac.

01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:47.220
On the other side of 780 is another cul-de-sac,

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:50.460
two homes, so everybody has fence lines there.

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:53.260
If you move the boundary to where they want, which

01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:58.220
is the left green line, then they're still

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.860
separating the community.

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.100
This is helpful.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.620
I mean, it's still a fence line.

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:07.020
I mean, it is, they're not, their driveways aren't

01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.020
facing on the same street, but they're homes that

01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.020
are right next to them.

01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:11.820
This helps to clarify.

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:14.020
Similarly, you're going to have homes right across

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.700
the street that look onto these homes, you know.

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:21.500
So, it's just kind of, in terms of a community

01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:24.100
identity issue, we just don't quite understand it

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.340
because you move the boundary and you still

01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.100
have the same issue.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:29.780
Thank you.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.140
And I'd like to add that this is commonplace.

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:36.580
Sometimes these boundaries are created 50, 60, 70

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:42.740
years ago, and in my former district, I had, you

01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:46.380
know, within a block, one or two districts adjoining.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.620
So, this is not a rare occurrence.

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.740
This does happen because these boundaries were set

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:56.420
a long time before some of these homes or sometimes

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:59.500
neighborhoods were established.

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.660
Yeah, I mean, there are many, many instances

01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:06.020
where boundary lines run right through homes.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:09.060
So, right through, yeah, I mean, that's just it.

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:10.460
You know, the boundary lines are drawn,

01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:12.060
housing development comes in.

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.140
You get the bedroom on one side, you go to one

01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:17.140
district and you get the other bedroom.

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.140
Leave it alone.

01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:18.540
All right.

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.980
Do we have any other questions or comments

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.380
before we take a motion?

01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.820
I'm not seeing any questions or.

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:33.500
Did I miss anything?

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.020
All right.

01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:37.340
So, do we have a motion?

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:39.700
Member Escobedo.

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:47.020
I would like to motion for us to affirm the decision

01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.820
of the county committee to disapprove the proposal

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:55.660
to transfer territory from San Jose to Oak Grove

01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:59.100
and the east side, UHSD.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.740
And I second that.

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:01.340
All right.

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.580
Any further discussion of the motion?

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.820
All in favor, raise your hand and say aye.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:06.820
Aye.

01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:07.860
Any opposed?

01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:08.980
Any abstentions?

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:09.820
The motion carries.

01:31:09.900 --> 01:31:10.820
Thank you very much.

01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.700
At this point, thank you, Larry.

01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:15.780
We appreciate you.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.460
We'd like to reopen item one to take action

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.540
on the preliminary report of actions

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:25.260
draft May 2023 meeting minutes

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:28.420
and to report on our liaison assignments.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.540
And while we're waiting for any members of the public

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:34.940
to call in, we need the public comment slide up, please.

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.780
Thank you very much.

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:42.020
Do I have a motion from a board member

01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:45.180
to approve the May 2023 State Board of Education

01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:49.260
draft preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:50.820
Member Olken, do I have a second?

01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.940
Member Rodriguez, thank you.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.140
Is there any public comment?

01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.700
Either in person or on the phone.

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.900
There are no callers in the queue.

01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.900
And no people in the room?

01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.340
And there's nobody in the room.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.460
All right.

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.140
Is there any further discussion?

01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.060
Seeing none, show of hands and say aye.

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:17.700
If you're in favor, aye.

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:19.540
Any opposed?

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.500
Any abstentions?

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:22.820
Okay.

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.820
Member Teal-Bronson and Member McClellan will abstain.

01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:28.180
All right, motion carries.

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.300
Thank you.

01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:32.100
Now I want to invite our State Board members

01:32:32.180 --> 01:32:34.100
to report out on their liaison activities

01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:38.300
that are not related to any items on our July agenda.

01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:40.580
And we're going to start with member Escobedo.

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:41.940
Yes, sir.

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:45.620
I wish to remind the board,

01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.700
NASBE Conference will be on October 25th to 28th.

01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:53.300
It will be in San Diego, California.

01:32:53.380 --> 01:32:57.340
We had a actual meeting with SBE staff

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:00.860
to talk about entertainment and speakers

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:03.420
that can well represent California.

01:33:04.340 --> 01:33:07.700
We also have a proposal submitted

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.700
on our community schools,

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:14.660
or we'll find out if it will be accepted by this month,

01:33:14.740 --> 01:33:17.540
and we'll be having a follow-up meeting

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:21.300
within the next few weeks to discuss further plans

01:33:21.380 --> 01:33:24.260
to highlight California during this conference.

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:27.220
So if you haven't done it already,

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.300
please register yourself again October 25th to the 28th.

01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:36.540
Again, it's the only conference designed

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.380
specifically for State Board members.

01:33:41.900 --> 01:33:45.900
My work as a liaison for WestEd,

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:50.620
we are in preparation for the upcoming CEO hiring.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:52.900
Every board member, including myself,

01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.980
went through an extensive implicit bias training,

01:33:58.060 --> 01:34:02.820
and next week we'll be interviewing three finalists,

01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:05.780
and hopefully by the end of the month

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:10.900
we will know who the new CEO for WestEd will be.

01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:16.620
And my colleagues, President Darling-Hammond,

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:23.180
and Trustee, oh my God, I'd leave.

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:32.340
We had just a great time preparing

01:34:32.420 --> 01:34:34.340
for Senate confirmation as well.

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.340
So we did well, I think we did exceedingly well.

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.020
So it was truly an amazing experience

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.580
and just glad to be part of the process.

01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:48.700
Thank you.

01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:50.540
Perfect, thank you.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.380
We'll go to Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:54.940
Thank you.

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.340
Just to let you know,

01:34:56.420 --> 01:34:58.300
for the Instructional Quality Commission,

01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:01.780
that meeting, they did not meet since our May meeting,

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:06.020
so there will be no report until our September meeting

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.980
in regards to that commission.

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:10.780
And as far as the California Collaborative

01:35:10.860 --> 01:35:14.540
for Educational Excellence, also known as CCEE,

01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:16.460
have a couple of things to share with you.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:21.220
And again, the CCEE is quite busy in their work,

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:24.060
even during these times when schools are off.

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:25.460
Did want to share with you

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:30.180
that the direct technical assistance webpage

01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.340
now includes the progress updates

01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:36.220
for the May 2023 fourth quarter.

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.980
And if you are interested,

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.060
you can definitely go to that webpage

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.820
and review the progress of the current districts

01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:45.980
that are receiving direct technical assistance.

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:49.260
And to date, the districts that are receiving

01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:52.540
that direct technical assistance are Inglewood,

01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.580
Vallejo City, Salinas, Sacramento,

01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:58.780
Oakland, and Mount Diablo.

01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:03.260
Also, the CCEE has been helping to facilitate

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:06.420
the high-quality online instructional materials,

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.100
and the Kern County Superintendent of Schools,

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:11.740
along with the CDE and CCEE,

01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:14.900
is nearing completion of the first year

01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:18.500
of that high-quality online instructional materials project,

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:24.300
as well as the use of a rubric

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:29.300
to help evaluate high-quality online materials for educators.

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:33.260
There is also an annual report for the CCEE.

01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.380
If you would like to read it,

01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:37.900
I would definitely encourage you to do so.

01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:41.780
You will find that online on the CCEE webpage,

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:47.540
and it was presented during our June CCEE governing board meeting,

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:50.420
as well as an update from all of the centers.

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:53.060
And again, in all of your free time,

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:56.140
would encourage you to even take a look at that recording.

01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:59.940
There are a lot of great things happening at each of the centers.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.100
There's one other piece that I did want to share with you

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:04.180
as I get ready to conclude,

01:37:04.260 --> 01:37:07.380
and I have to look on this, I apologize.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:11.620
As I'm getting this other information ready for you,

01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:13.980
I do want to let you know that the CCEE

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:16.780
will be resuming in-person meetings.

01:37:16.860 --> 01:37:18.540
We've been meeting virtually,

01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:22.500
and our first meeting in person for the new year

01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:25.060
will be on August 31st.

01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:27.180
The last piece that I wanted to add in

01:37:27.220 --> 01:37:31.420
is to let you know that the CCEE

01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:36.420
just launched the Levers 2.0 LEA inventory.

01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:38.860
That's an expanded version of the Basic Levers

01:37:38.940 --> 01:37:42.140
special education inventory for LEAs,

01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:47.140
and the tool is available online at the CCEE website,

01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.820
and it's really in place,

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.380
and we encourage LEAs that are wanting to improve

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.660
and align systems for general and special education

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:58.220
to go online and take a look at that tool.

01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.500
Again, another helpful resource, and that concludes my report.

01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.660
Thank you.

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.940
Thank you very much.

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:06.300
Member Lewis.

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:11.500
Okay, thank you.

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:16.420
I am the liaison to the California Subject Matter Project

01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.540
and Currents Committee,

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.620
and I will give a brief report on the June quarterly meeting.

01:38:21.700 --> 01:38:24.500
And for those of you who are not aware

01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.180
of the individuals and groups that comprise this project,

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:32.220
it consists of the California Arts Project,

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:36.020
which is headquartered in CSU San Bernardino,

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:38.660
the California Global Education Project,

01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:42.380
which is headquartered at the University of San Diego,

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.980
the California History Social Science Project,

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:47.060
headquartered at UC Davis,

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:50.780
the California Mathematics Project at UCLA,

01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:53.700
the California Physical Education and Health Project

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:55.700
at CSU Channel Islands,

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:59.980
the California Reading and Literature Project at UC San Diego,

01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:03.460
the California Science Project at UC Riverside,

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.660
the California World Language Project

01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:08.180
headquartered at Stanford University,

01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.180
and the California Writing Project

01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.060
headquartered at UC Santa Barbara.

01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:17.180
And these nine disciplines, they work specific networks

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.900
that consist of 80 regional sites

01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:23.620
that serve approximately 25,000 educators

01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:28.340
for more than 1,200 school districts on an annual basis.

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:31.580
The CSMP is committed to growing their role

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:35.020
in providing a more robust statewide support system

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.700
led by the executive directors

01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:39.980
of each of the mentioned projects.

01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:42.380
And today I'll just share some of the highlights

01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:44.420
from the June meeting.

01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:47.100
The committee started off with an appreciation

01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:50.140
of the former California Reading and Literature Project

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.740
executive director, Debra Costa-Hernandez,

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.740
and welcomed the new executive director,

01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.820
Shirvana Anderson-Bird,

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:03.940
who has been a regional CRLP director for the past 13 years.

01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:06.780
The committee also provided a few highlights

01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:11.380
of several of the statewide cross-disciplinary initiatives

01:40:11.460 --> 01:40:16.380
that are now in different stages of implementation,

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:20.580
and they include programming around ethnic studies

01:40:20.660 --> 01:40:23.060
and computer science.

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.580
The CMP also continues to partner

01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:29.660
with the 21st CSLA Leadership Academy

01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.860
and has formed a new partnership

01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:34.300
with the California Initiative Collaborative,

01:40:34.380 --> 01:40:38.020
a statewide collaborative with intersegmental partners,

01:40:38.100 --> 01:40:41.340
looking at recommendations to create various options

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.780
for mathematics, articulation,

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:47.100
and pathways to higher education.

01:40:47.180 --> 01:40:50.740
This is a very busy group, and during that meeting,

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:55.820
each of the SMP leads provided updates on their current work.

01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.460
And if you'd like more information,

01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:03.220
you can visit the CSMP link to each of the projects

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.820
with an explanation of the work that's going on.

01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:08.260
And thank you, and that concludes my report.

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:10.780
Member Olken.

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:14.860
Thank you.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:19.180
I am going to focus my comments today

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:22.980
in the spirit of gay math

01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:26.740
after our successful adoption yesterday.

01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.540
So I'm just going to talk about two...

01:41:28.620 --> 01:41:32.500
My two liaison reports are sort of related to math.

01:41:32.580 --> 01:41:37.860
First, I am the liaison for the SMP,

01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:40.860
liaison for environmental literacy,

01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:47.540
and I attended the quarterly accountability meeting

01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.700
of the Climate Change and Environmental Justice Program.

01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:55.460
This is a project which stems from a budget allocation

01:41:55.540 --> 01:42:00.340
of $6 million to create free open source curricular units

01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:04.580
at every grade level, focusing on climate change,

01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:09.220
environmental justice, and ensuring that kids

01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:16.620
at all levels are doing hands-on action-oriented work

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.380
to become better stewards

01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.540
and understanding the role that they can play.

01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:25.860
And it's being overseen by the San Mateo County Office of Education,

01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:29.300
and the work is being led by 10 strands.

01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:34.740
So the update is that the work to create all these units

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:37.100
is moving smoothly.

01:42:37.180 --> 01:42:40.820
There are community partners across the state

01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:43.420
who are actually building the units,

01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:47.380
and they're getting ready to do sort of test implementations,

01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.700
pilot programs in schools.

01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:53.100
We got to see the design of the units,

01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:58.980
which is based on big questions.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:04.780
They are interdisciplinary, so this gets back to math,

01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:07.580
because all of the units have standards

01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:12.180
that come from different disciplines across the curricula.

01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:18.300
And so yesterday, the founder of 10 strands was here talking about

01:43:18.380 --> 01:43:21.700
how the environmental literacy standards

01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:24.700
are incorporated into the new math framework,

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.020
and that goes both directions.

01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.420
So that's really exciting work.

01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:32.940
And then the other thing is I was lucky to attend

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:37.620
the Early Math Initiative Symposium,

01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:43.700
which is the Early Math Project is a statewide partnership

01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:47.620
that promotes the importance of math and early education

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:51.340
birth through age eight

01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:55.260
by providing tools to parents and educators

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:58.060
and collaborates with agencies across the state

01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:03.540
to promote mathematical thinking and joy in math.

01:44:03.620 --> 01:44:06.580
The symposium was incredible.

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:12.060
It was intended by 3,000 educators from across California,

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:16.340
as well as a large national and international audience.

01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:23.220
And in case anybody here or out there listening missed it,

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.620
they have another event coming up in the fall,

01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.940
which is a free virtual fall forum on October 8th.

01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:35.220
And so if that's something you're interested in,

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:38.300
you want to look at the Early Math...

01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:39.660
Hold on, I even have the link.

01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.860
Well, you want to look at the Early Math Initiative website.

01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:48.420
And yesterday, we heard one of my favourite quotes from yesterday

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.740
was, first of all, yay math.

01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:52.140
That was my first favourite quote.

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:57.420
But my second one is that fun and rigor can coexist.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:03.100
And I think we don't always remember that in the math classroom,

01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:06.300
but they always remember that in the Early Math Initiative

01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:07.580
and the work that they do.

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:10.180
And I think that's a really important piece

01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:15.340
of strengthening every child's excitement

01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:18.540
and how many kids are going to come and say, I love math.

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.820
So, and with that, that concludes my report.

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:27.340
And for the meeting is yay math.

01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.940
Member Roscoe Gonzalez.

01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:32.780
Hi, everyone.

01:45:32.860 --> 01:45:35.140
So I am the assessment committee liaison

01:45:35.220 --> 01:45:37.460
and I shared during our item three discussion

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:41.700
that the redesigned score reports for CASP and ALPAC

01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:46.380
are a positive test step towards improving test result reporting.

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:51.340
The efforts made by the CDE and the ETS to involve students,

01:45:51.420 --> 01:45:54.780
educators, parents and guardians in focus groups

01:45:54.860 --> 01:45:57.340
and feedback opportunities are commendable.

01:45:57.420 --> 01:45:59.780
The feedback received has resulted in a clearer,

01:45:59.860 --> 01:46:04.820
more accessible reports with less jargon, less text.

01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:07.700
The use of colour and graphics will enhance visual appeal

01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:08.940
and understanding.

01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:13.420
I already received the reports early on in June for my own children.

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:17.180
So I thought that already there is some step forward.

01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:20.100
The inclusion of school and state averages for scale,

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:26.580
score comparison and the consolidation of ELA and mathematics

01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:28.940
and science results into one report,

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:32.540
simplify the information and provide valuable context.

01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:35.460
The introduction of composite claim reporting for ELA

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.620
and mathematics offers a comprehensive view

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:39.380
of student performance.

01:46:39.460 --> 01:46:41.460
The commitment to continuous improvement

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:44.180
and user-friendly designs is evident.

01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:46.940
And I want to highlight again that the educators will have access

01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:52.460
to over 200 assessment forms through the 23-24 Smarter Balance

01:46:52.540 --> 01:46:56.380
interim assessments for ELA and math starting August 1st,

01:46:56.460 --> 01:47:00.260
just in time for the school year to start our planning.

01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:03.500
The Tools for Teachers website provides instructional resources

01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:06.100
including grade level performance descriptions

01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.060
and academic vocabulary list to support educators

01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:11.580
in enhancing their teaching practices

01:47:11.660 --> 01:47:14.420
and meeting the diverse needs of their students.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:18.100
I say are because, you know, I'm in the classroom.

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:20.940
These resources are aligned with the interim assessments

01:47:21.020 --> 01:47:23.420
providing valuable guidance for instruction.

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:26.020
Now my recommendation is that it would be beneficial

01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:29.420
to include English language development, teacher resources

01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:31.460
and the Tools for Teachers website

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:33.660
and that the student score reports are available

01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:37.700
in multiple languages with further improved accessibility

01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.780
and inclusivity.

01:47:39.860 --> 01:47:41.380
So that concludes my report.

01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:42.460
Thank you.

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:45.660
Member Porter.

01:47:50.500 --> 01:47:52.900
So I'm just going to share a few highlights from my work.

01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:55.740
The first that I was able to meet with the Youth Commission

01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:59.100
for the City of San Jose about opportunities for young people

01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:01.180
to get involved on not only the statewide level

01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:04.540
but locally as well and how to leverage their passions

01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:07.100
and turn them into passion projects and talents

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:10.300
to make their school a better and more safe environment.

01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:13.220
Second, I was able to meet with the California Association

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:16.940
of Student Councils three different regional conferences

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:19.940
as well as their summer camp to share with young leaders

01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:22.820
about how to start their journey within school districts

01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:25.820
and this is for freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors

01:48:25.900 --> 01:48:29.500
and just informing them about resources available to students

01:48:29.580 --> 01:48:32.060
as they continue their leadership journeys.

01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:35.780
And lastly, I've been able to train my successor Anya

01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:39.780
with meetings and by creating a Google Drive of information

01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:42.700
about organizations she should connect with,

01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:45.940
advisory groups to work with, people to connect with

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:49.540
and the best ways to maximize her time here on the State Board.

01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:52.260
And so thank you again to each of you for the ways

01:48:52.340 --> 01:48:55.660
that you've impacted me indirectly and directly during my term.

01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.500
I know that I will come back to California

01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.780
because of people like you

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:00.940
and just continue to live a life of service.

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.020
So thank you.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.340
That concludes my report.

01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.420
All right.

01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:06.780
Thank you.

01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.140
Member Rodriguez.

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:11.740
Thank you.

01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:17.580
So we are currently, I'm the co-chair

01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:23.300
for the NASB's PEP, Public Education Policy Committee

01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:28.260
and what our team is working on is high school redesign

01:49:28.340 --> 01:49:32.060
and rethinking how to make high schools more relevant

01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:35.900
and more engaging for our youth

01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:40.060
who reported a disconnection at times

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.620
with their high schools as they are.

01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:46.140
Sometimes they feel unprepared.

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:50.660
And so we're rethinking and looking at models that are effective,

01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:54.260
such as when teachers have a chance to collaborate together,

01:49:55.460 --> 01:50:00.780
when schools are a little more intimate,

01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:06.100
closed for teachers to work with a small group of students.

01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:08.740
And what we're working on,

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.940
we're looking at research and listening to experts.

01:50:12.020 --> 01:50:15.300
And then we'll be presenting this at the conference

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:18.180
that Member Escobedo talked about in October.

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:21.220
So it's exciting work and it's important work

01:50:21.300 --> 01:50:24.620
for our young people and for our teachers as well.

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.700
Thank you.

01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:29.700
Thank you so much.

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.340
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.100
Good afternoon, everybody. I have two reports.

01:50:36.180 --> 01:50:39.020
I passed by alphabetically. I passed by.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.500
Member Patil-Bronson.

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:41.580
Please.

01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:43.260
OK.

01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:46.740
I'm just looking at my alphabetical list and it's like...

01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.100
Go ahead.

01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:49.620
Member Yoshimoto-Towry.

01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.620
I was always last in elementary school.

01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.980
I have a complex about that.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.180
So good afternoon, everybody.

01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:06.900
Two brief reports, one on the Advisory Commission for Special Education.

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:12.220
And I'm happy to report that the commissioners voted a new chair in,

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:16.460
and Chair David Tustin, who many of you know is eager to align

01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:20.380
the work of the Advisory Commission on Special Education with our work.

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:24.900
And an example of that is they added a meeting in December

01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:30.300
to be able to advise us on the annual performance report

01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:32.740
that will come to us in January.

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:35.900
So in time to give us their advice.

01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.620
Secondly, the community schools effort.

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:43.500
I just wanted to share that there was an inspiring community school summit

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:45.740
on June 16th in San Francisco.

01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:50.020
There were thousands of educators there from across California and the nation.

01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.940
And I think what made it so phenomenal is that the breakout sessions

01:51:52.980 --> 01:51:57.020
were led by teachers, by parents, by community school coordinators,

01:51:57.100 --> 01:51:59.500
administrators, people from county offices.

01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.780
And it really showed the collaboration and the community school effort

01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:05.620
across the state and the country.

01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:06.900
So thank you.

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.460
And I'm going to go to Member Patilla Bronson,

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:14.820
but I also, my alphabeticalist did not include Member McQuillan,

01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:16.900
so I'm going to come back to you.

01:52:19.300 --> 01:52:21.020
I think you're just keeping us on our toes.

01:52:21.100 --> 01:52:22.740
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:31.540
So one of the liaison assignments I have is with the Universal Pre-K Mixed Delivery Workgroup,

01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:36.460
which focuses on both the expansion of transitional kindergarten

01:52:36.540 --> 01:52:40.140
as well as the expansion of the California State Preschool Program.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:44.900
It's exciting to see that UTK has been rolling out

01:52:44.980 --> 01:52:48.780
and is expected to serve about 300,000 four-year-olds

01:52:48.860 --> 01:52:51.020
by the 25-26 school year.

01:52:51.500 --> 01:52:54.980
What we're seeing is about 10% of school districts and charter schools

01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.380
are expanding faster than expected,

01:52:57.460 --> 01:53:00.620
enrolling four-year-olds even sooner than required by law,

01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:04.020
which I think is an exciting sign of interest

01:53:04.100 --> 01:53:07.580
and also capacity on the part of local implementing districts,

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:14.180
and that about 80% of districts are offering full-day transitional kindergarten,

01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:16.220
even though they're not officially required to,

01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:18.740
but I think the research certainly demonstrates

01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:24.060
that that is a laudable aspiration to bring into implementation.

01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:26.380
In addition, the state budget,

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:30.500
which I think we described somewhat earlier in the...

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:33.540
I guess that was just yesterday,

01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:36.940
also includes continuing eligibility expansions

01:53:37.020 --> 01:53:41.180
in terms of the number of birthdays that are included

01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:45.420
as we're rolling into or towards 25-26,

01:53:45.540 --> 01:53:50.060
and the budget also included funding to add one certificated

01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:53.460
or classified staff person to every TK class

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:56.220
to reduce the adult-to-child ratios

01:53:56.300 --> 01:53:59.380
to align more closely with the state preschool program.

01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:01.820
It's also a cost-of-living adjustment,

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.540
which has not always been the case

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:06.940
that the early side of the House has gotten the same COLA,

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:09.980
and I think it's a huge sign of respect, honestly,

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:13.500
to have that mirrored across the different systems.

01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:17.060
The latest breaking and connected to school districts,

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.860
but somewhat sort of apart,

01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:22.300
is the childcare side of the world,

01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:24.860
which really is the feeder system.

01:54:24.940 --> 01:54:28.660
Before kids come into the TK to 12 side of the House,

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:35.060
received a huge, really largest pay increase in state history

01:54:35.140 --> 01:54:38.300
for childcare providers.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:40.660
It's estimated to be about $600 million

01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:43.180
and rate increases over two years,

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.580
plus starting the first-ever $80 million retirement funding pot

01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.180
and $100 million for healthcare funding.

01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:52.460
Again, these are things that are normal in the world of K-12,

01:54:52.540 --> 01:54:57.620
but are new for the earliest side of early learning,

01:54:57.700 --> 01:55:00.140
and I think really exciting.

01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:04.180
The last is that, again, as distinct from the K-12 system,

01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:07.180
there are family fees that are charged for childcare,

01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:11.100
so there's a cap for the lowest-income families

01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.540
to no longer have to pay higher amounts per month,

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:19.020
but capping at 1% of family income again.

01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:21.620
That is super exciting.

01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:25.460
In addition, for the liaison work on school facilities,

01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:29.620
there was a UC Berkeley forum on school facilities

01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:32.620
and modernization and inequity problems

01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.060
in the modernization funding,

01:55:34.140 --> 01:55:36.980
which Jeff Vincent from UC Berkeley

01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:40.140
was the primary featured guest.

01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:44.020
Really drawing upon getting down to facts,

01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:45.740
work from a couple years back

01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:48.740
around why disparities in school facilities funding

01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.300
that are due to local property wealth and property values,

01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:56.580
and pointing out the degree to which it's effectively

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:59.860
a regressive finance system that makes it very difficult

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:03.860
for lower-income districts and lower-property districts

01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:06.300
to be able to access modernization funds.

01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:09.700
The big headline number that certainly caught my attention

01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:14.700
is that the most poverty-poor or property-poor districts

01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:18.900
have about $400 per student in terms of bonding capacity

01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:22.340
versus wealthy districts or property-wealthy districts

01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:26.300
have almost $800,000 per student,

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:28.860
and the messages that are sent to kids

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:32.900
when their facilities are allowed to fall into disrepair,

01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:35.180
I think, are significant.

01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:37.900
So there are a host of proposals being considered

01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:41.660
to look at changing the share of local contribution

01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:44.980
versus state contribution to take account for the fact

01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:50.220
that there are a lot of property-poor areas of the state,

01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:54.380
and it's not an urban rural, it's really across the state

01:56:54.460 --> 01:56:58.860
that this problem has been percolating.

01:56:58.940 --> 01:57:02.300
But really looking at modifying the sliding scale proposal

01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:05.780
that is already actually baked into prior legislation

01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:10.300
to even the odds and make the system a little less regressive.

01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:11.900
And that concludes my report.

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:15.260
And Member McQuillan.

01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:17.340
Thank you.

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.500
My assignment that I want to report back on

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:26.220
is the model curriculum liaison assignment.

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:30.980
The first one is from Orange County Office of Education

01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:34.820
which is leading the model curriculum development

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:38.300
on Cambodian genocide model curriculum,

01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:42.580
the Hmong history and cultural studies curriculum,

01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:46.060
and the Vietnamese American refugee experience.

01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:50.580
Orange County has conducted lots of listening sessions

01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:53.300
and input sessions over the last year

01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:56.220
and is now in the drafting period this summer

01:57:56.300 --> 01:57:58.140
of drafting that model curriculum

01:57:58.220 --> 01:57:59.940
on those three communities.

01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:02.580
Very interesting, very insightful,

01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:05.740
learning about these three communities.

01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:10.140
And then this fall, that draft curriculum

01:58:10.220 --> 01:58:13.060
will come back to the committees for feedback

01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:17.140
and then finalizing in the spring of 2024.

01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:21.540
The other model curriculum is being developed

01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.460
by Humboldt County Office of Ed

01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.540
and San Diego County Office of Ed

01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:28.500
on American Indian curriculum.

01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:30.740
That's taking a little more time to bake

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.980
and over the next two years.

01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:35.980
And lots of listening sessions there

01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:38.940
conducted by Humboldt County and San Diego.

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:44.340
And then developing new curriculum,

01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:49.100
grabbing a hold of existing curriculum

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:51.380
and lots of listening sessions there.

01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:53.740
Again, that'll take two years on that.

01:58:54.740 --> 01:58:58.900
The other report is on the career technical education.

01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:01.220
We have a new statewide plan

01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.460
on career technical education.

01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:07.180
That's a report from the Joint Pathways Committee

01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:08.900
that I also sit on.

01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:13.140
And that statewide plan will be rolling out now

01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:14.980
over the next few months.

01:59:15.060 --> 01:59:18.620
And I urge you to take a look at that.

01:59:18.700 --> 01:59:20.180
Thank you.

01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:22.980
Exciting progress being made.

01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:24.940
Thank you.

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.820
And I've said plenty in this meeting.

01:59:26.900 --> 01:59:29.100
I will simply just add to all the work

01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:31.340
that we've already discussed that

01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:35.140
in the accountability domain,

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:39.220
which I am a co-leason for,

01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:42.900
we've begun to think about also

01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:50.340
the continuous instruction approach

01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:53.380
that we started to take at the beginning of the pandemic,

01:59:53.380 --> 01:59:56.140
asking districts to be able to have a plan

01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:58.660
for how they can move in and out of instruction.

01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:00.500
We didn't really talk about that yesterday,

02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:03.900
but that's another piece of the puzzle

02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:07.140
that is really not about accountability or dashboard.

02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:11.100
It's about how do we deal with the kind of changes

02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:13.100
in climate and so on.

02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:15.620
Back in the beginning of the pandemic,

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:20.260
the place that appeared as the most interesting

02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:21.820
in that regard was Miami,

02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:25.020
because they had had the beginnings of floods every year.

02:00:25.100 --> 02:00:27.100
So they had a plan for every school

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:28.620
that students would have laptops,

02:00:28.700 --> 02:00:30.820
they would have all of the assignments and everything

02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:34.220
up on the dashboard,

02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.340
the chalkboard or whatever it is that they were using

02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.500
for online instruction,

02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:41.620
and could flexibly be in and out of school.

02:00:41.700 --> 02:00:44.780
And as we were talking about the ways in which we want to

02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:46.180
support attendance,

02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:48.980
part of it is going to be beyond our dashboard

02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:50.780
or indicator system,

02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:53.860
but really into the way we help support schools

02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:54.980
to be able to do that.

02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:58.460
So interesting conversations are going on about that,

02:00:58.540 --> 02:01:00.260
not only here, but across the country.

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:03.820
And we'll have a chance to talk more about that in future.

02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:07.500
And now I'd like to take up agenda item 16,

02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:09.140
general public comment.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:11.220
Public comment is invited on any matter

02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:14.700
not included on the printed agenda.

02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:16.260
Are there any speakers signed up

02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.300
to provide public comment in person?

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:21.420
Yes, Steve McDougall.

02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:26.060
Nice to see you again.

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:32.540
There we go.

02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:34.260
I think it's afternoon.

02:01:34.340 --> 02:01:37.180
Good afternoon, members of the board, CD staff,

02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:40.260
Steve McDougall with the California Federation of Teachers.

02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:45.420
We are two weeks away from some of our schools opening up,

02:01:45.500 --> 02:01:48.740
five weeks away from all of them being open probably.

02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:52.900
And it'll be our first full year of AI

02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:57.140
being on students' and staff's brains.

02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:03.460
We really need to have some guidance out there for LEAs

02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.420
on what to do about it and what not to do about it.

02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:10.620
Certainly with our academic honesty,

02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:14.420
honesty policies need to be some guidance on that updated.

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:18.100
But I urge you, if you're not already working on that,

02:02:18.180 --> 02:02:20.620
that maybe we need to get going on that.

02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.420
And if you have been working on it and I just missed it,

02:02:23.500 --> 02:02:25.300
I apologize for being redundant.

02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:29.900
So, other than that, I'd like you all to adjourn if you can.

02:02:31.980 --> 02:02:34.260
Thank you very much, Steve,

02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:38.060
both for that knotty problem and for that good advice.

02:02:38.140 --> 02:02:41.700
Is there anyone waiting to provide public comment on the phone line?

02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:42.660
There is not.

02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.740
All right.

02:02:44.820 --> 02:02:46.980
So there are no further callers.

02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:53.740
And I hereby can adjourn our July 2023 meeting at 11.52 a.m.

02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.820
Thank you. And I look forward to seeing you in September.

02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:58.620
Yay!
