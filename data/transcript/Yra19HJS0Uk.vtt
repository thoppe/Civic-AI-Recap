00:03.927 --> 00:04.768
Good morning, everybody.

00:04.788 --> 00:09.330
Juan Godinez from Los Angeles High School District, District Advisory Committee.

00:10.071 --> 00:11.331
As you can see, one minute is hard.

00:11.672 --> 00:12.112
I will try.

00:13.152 --> 00:14.373
Okay.

00:15.234 --> 00:18.035
We generally support Algebra 1 in 8th grade.

00:19.016 --> 00:19.736
About time.

00:19.796 --> 00:24.239
Two years ago, I told you my testimony about the California education system.

00:25.419 --> 00:28.681
I know initially it's going to be hard, like NCLB is.

00:29.081 --> 00:30.102
Maybe not terrible.

00:30.717 --> 00:33.559
But LEAs are going to put the effort to it.

00:33.739 --> 00:34.720
At least they're going to try.

00:35.440 --> 00:36.601
And that's what I like about it.

00:38.462 --> 00:43.105
But at the end, it doesn't matter what happens with the Common Core Standards.

00:44.266 --> 00:48.769
It's of the utmost importance to let the parents know about the standards.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.392
They need to know what the kid's supposed to be learning.

00:54.052 --> 00:58.475
Not just in eighth grade, but this is a process throughout previously.

00:59.569 --> 01:03.073
And it has not been done successfully, you know, previously.

01:03.753 --> 01:07.897
Let the parents know how we can help you help our kids, you know, learn.

01:09.078 --> 01:13.202
And being a minority, low income, has nothing to do with learning.

01:14.163 --> 01:18.607
What we need is a quality education accessible for everybody.

01:18.968 --> 01:19.368
Thank you.

01:20.049 --> 01:20.409
Thank you.

01:20.589 --> 01:21.450
And perfect timing.

01:24.758 --> 01:30.975
The next three are Pixie Hayward Shickley, Marta Zaragoza-Diaz, and Lori Burnham Massey.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.501
Good morning, President Mitchell, Board, Superintendent.

01:42.581 --> 01:53.086
I'm Pixie Hayward-Chickley, representing the California Teachers Association, and it's my great pleasure this morning to introduce the Vice President of the California Teachers Association, Dean Vogel.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.768
I'd also like to give what's left of my time to him.

01:55.948 --> 01:56.268
Thank you.

01:58.254 --> 01:58.754
Good morning.

01:59.915 --> 02:04.017
Very happy to be here and thank you for your thoughtful attention to what's before us.

02:04.538 --> 02:08.420
I am for the record Dean Vogel, Vice President of the California Teachers Association.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.242
I'm here on behalf of my president who has business in LA.

02:12.602 --> 02:16.925
The California Teachers Association supports the adoption of the Common Core Standards.

02:17.640 --> 02:23.308
And we are very, very encouraged by what we hear here today and the work that's before you.

02:24.169 --> 02:32.100
That being said, we do have a reservation around the 8th grade math concern, much of it voiced here.

02:33.562 --> 02:45.156
We implore you to be thoughtful and careful as you attend to the implementation of the eighth grade math, in particular, algebra.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.781
We believe that there's a potential for the pathway approach.

02:50.021 --> 02:53.863
dealing with students who aren't quite ready for algebra in the eighth grade to lead to tracking.

02:54.443 --> 03:04.888
And we hope that you will be diligent in attending to that issue and careful to monitor and assure us that tracking does not take place.

03:06.138 --> 03:13.263
The ultimate success of the Common Core, as has been stated earlier, is going to depend on full implementation and full funding.

03:14.363 --> 03:18.906
And it's also got to be attention to all schools.

03:19.878 --> 03:22.179
all students, not just some schools.

03:22.679 --> 03:26.180
And we know that you'll give that careful attention as well.

03:26.481 --> 03:34.804
We have a tremendous opportunity here before us, ladies and gentlemen, tremendous opportunity to move California forward and continue the work that this board has been doing.

03:34.964 --> 03:45.688
And the California Teachers Association is enthusiastically supportive of the work and we support wholeheartedly the adoption of the Common Core.

03:46.028 --> 03:48.929
Please remember that careful alignment to curriculum,

03:50.130 --> 03:55.235
appropriate textbooks, assessment, professional development are all very, very important.

03:55.976 --> 03:59.120
We urge your adoption of the Common Core.

03:59.560 --> 04:00.261
Thank you very much.

04:05.868 --> 04:08.350
Good morning, Mr. President and members of the board.

04:08.390 --> 04:15.877
My name is Martha Zaragoza-Diaz and I'm representing the California Association for Bilingual Education and the Californians Together Coalition.

04:16.497 --> 04:29.148
First, I'd like to thank the Commission and its members as well as the SCOE staff for a yeoman's job that they've done in meeting their charge within the time, with the tight time constraints that they have, that they had to face.

04:29.928 --> 04:44.294
We certainly appreciate the recognition and the introduction with regards to the fact that there are certain students such as English learners and special education that may require additional support in attaining the standards outlined in the document.

04:44.754 --> 04:47.595
We support the common standards, common core standards.

04:47.935 --> 04:51.677
However, we believe that the board can take it one step further.

04:52.097 --> 04:56.380
you have our letters already outlining our concerns, but our bottom line is this.

04:56.820 --> 05:15.673
If we are to assist teachers in differentiating content instruction and in ensuring that English language development is provided to English learners so that they can become fully proficient and literate in English, it is highly recommended that the English language development standards be an integral part of the Common Core State Standards.

05:16.093 --> 05:22.338
and that they be included as one of the strands or be aligned within each strand of the great level language art standards.

05:22.519 --> 05:32.507
It is critical that their revision and integration be done as quickly as possible and we took the privilege of providing a recommended timeline that we think is doable.

05:32.847 --> 05:34.629
We seek your commitment

05:35.009 --> 05:38.431
We seek your commitment to return to this issue later this year.

05:38.591 --> 05:40.973
It is a very significant issue for English learners.

05:41.573 --> 05:48.317
California's English language development standards are considered model English language proficiency standards nationally.

05:48.797 --> 05:59.383
California, once again, has an opportunity to lead the nation by providing an exemplary lined English language proficiency model for other states to use.

05:59.903 --> 06:03.245
Our organizations stand ready to assist you in this very important effort.

06:03.385 --> 06:03.666
Thank you.

06:08.547 --> 06:09.008
Good morning.

06:09.048 --> 06:14.775
My name is Laurie Burnham and I give my time to be added to the time of the next speaker, Shelley Spiegel Coleman.

06:14.935 --> 06:15.275
Thank you.

06:19.200 --> 06:22.584
Good morning, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, and board members.

06:22.744 --> 06:25.488
I'm Shelley Spiegel Coleman with Californians Together.

06:26.385 --> 06:46.700
We recommend that the same staircase approach of building complexity from grade level to grade level in the Common Core Standards and the supplemental approach of the artful inclusion of K-8 content literacy standards to supplement the state's content standards

06:47.369 --> 06:50.794
be equally directed at meeting the needs of English learners.

06:51.675 --> 07:04.372
In California, we need to align our current English language development standards to the approved Common Core standards if we are to give our teachers the additional support that they need

07:04.853 --> 07:08.558
to bring students to grade level common core standards.

07:09.079 --> 07:20.696
These English language development or English language proficiency standards would be just like the content literacy standards, not replacing the language art standards, but supplementing them.

07:21.425 --> 07:35.476
Without this work at the state level, each district, school, or teacher would be left to define what does it mean to give extra time to promote language proficiency.

07:35.857 --> 07:42.222
They themselves would have to create the clear alignment and write new standards where holes may exist.

07:42.942 --> 07:52.886
If the state does not do this, then schools, districts, and teachers might ignore or better yet be overwhelmed by this critical task.

07:53.746 --> 08:08.692
Districts like Alisal with 68.8% of their student body being English learners, Hoover Elementary School in LAUSD with 83.6% of their students being English learners need our leadership on this issue.

08:09.153 --> 08:12.374
We recommend the adoption of the Common Core Standards today

08:12.896 --> 08:15.407
to meet the short timeline that you have before you.

08:16.084 --> 08:39.641
But in your resolution, we ask you to adopt language as part of the implementation plan that states that the State Board and the Department of Education will use all appropriate current funds and any new state or federal funds to do the developmental work to bring English learners into the new and exciting possibility of Common Core Standards for All.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.442
We, too, stand ready to help you in this task.

08:42.743 --> 08:43.063
Thank you.

08:45.071 --> 08:50.172
President Mitchell, the next three are Cheryl Ortega, Barbara Flores, and Gretchen Mueller.

08:58.120 --> 08:58.580
Good morning.

08:58.841 --> 09:07.206
My name is Cheryl Ortega, and I represent United Teachers Los Angeles, representing over 220,000 English language learners in our school district.

09:10.068 --> 09:25.378
We'd like to thank the commission for their work in developing the English, the ELA standards, but we also are strongly encouraging or recognizing the need to articulate that added support may be required for English language learners.

09:28.480 --> 09:34.527
We can't emphasize enough the need to connect the ELA standards with the ELD standards.

09:35.268 --> 09:45.219
For teachers to have the most explicit guidelines in directing instruction for English language learners, the ELP standards must be distinctly articulated and taught explicitly.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.200
Forty seconds.

09:48.536 --> 09:58.509
The more explicit the roadmap, in this case these ELP standards, the more successful the student will be in reaching his or her final academic destination of English proficiency.

09:59.250 --> 10:07.019
So we feel strongly at UTLA that the ELP standards must be aligned to the ELC common core, ELA common core standards.

10:07.799 --> 10:20.588
but be distinctly articulated so that I and my fellow teachers can do a better job in creating scaffolded lessons that are developmentally appropriate, linguistically sound, and ultimately successful in helping our students.

10:21.169 --> 10:21.529
Thank you.

10:27.383 --> 10:32.227
Good morning, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, state board members.

10:32.987 --> 10:34.609
My name is Dr. Barbara Flores.

10:35.129 --> 10:36.010
I wear many hats.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.711
I'm a university professor.

10:38.232 --> 10:42.175
My field of expertise is language arts in L1 and L2.

10:42.415 --> 10:43.456
I'm a teacher of teachers.

10:44.156 --> 10:54.198
I'm currently the Vice President also of San Bernardino City Unified School District, and I come to you today, though, as President of the Alliance for Multilingual and Multicultural Education.

10:55.318 --> 11:07.281
On behalf of the Alliance of Multilingual and Multicultural Education, we would like to submit this testimony regarding the California Academic Content Standards Commission's recommendations to adopt the Common Core Standards.

11:07.921 --> 11:12.942
We are an alliance of state organizations, affiliates, and community members that have formed a national collective

11:13.502 --> 11:17.123
Collective Advocacy Agenda for Multilingual, Bilingual, and English Language Learners.

11:17.663 --> 11:31.907
Currently, we are one of the three organizations, along with the Council of Chief Estates Officers and the Council of Great City Schools, sponsoring the Fall Summit on the Impact of Common Core Standards of English Language Learners.

11:32.768 --> 11:34.488
Just one more paragraph.

11:34.788 --> 11:37.349
We want to recommend that we

11:40.098 --> 12:00.897
We support the recommendations of the California ELL Common Standards, but we also highly recommend that the State Board of Education also establish a commission to create English language proficiency standards that are aligned with the English language arts content standards in order to provide better policies and guidelines for instructional practices for teachers teaching English language learners.

12:01.517 --> 12:10.879
And in order to accomplish this, the current ELD standards can be revised, edited, and expanded to align with the adopted and approved language arts common core standards.

12:10.919 --> 12:12.600
So we thank you very much.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.001
So we do need your help, folks.

12:18.941 --> 12:20.542
I was thinking about time.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.543
But I'm happy to know that too.

12:27.844 --> 12:28.804
So, good morning.

12:29.264 --> 12:29.984
I'm Gretchen Muller.

12:30.004 --> 12:38.066
I'm with the California Math Council, and I am reading a statement on behalf of Bruce Grip, who was a commissioner and couldn't be here today.

12:38.866 --> 12:53.409
He says, distinguished members of the California State Board of Education, I urge you to accept the recommendation of the Academic Content Standards Commission and adopt for California the Common Core State Standards with the additions noted in the CCSS draft for California.

12:54.364 --> 13:00.897
As a member of the Commission, I am proud of the work that we did and agree with the recommendation to adopt the CCS.

13:01.057 --> 13:04.424
I also support this recommendation as a high school math teacher.

13:05.754 --> 13:11.581
He says he values the thoughtful and balanced development of mathematics in the CCSS from kindergarten through high school.

13:12.022 --> 13:16.267
What I appreciate most is how the high level of rigor is enhanced by relevance.

13:16.747 --> 13:24.997
The infusion of the eight standards for mathematical practice and the emphasis throughout the Common Core Standards on Mathematical Modeling in real world contexts

13:25.497 --> 13:29.159
add both meaning and rigor to improve students' understanding of mathematics.

13:29.719 --> 13:41.924
As a high school mathematics teacher, I would be pleased to teach integrated courses common in other countries or traditional high school mathematics content to students with the quality mathematical preparation based upon these common core standards.

13:42.425 --> 13:42.825
Thank you.

13:42.945 --> 13:44.365
Bruce Grip, high school math teacher.

13:45.426 --> 13:45.726
Thank you.

13:46.807 --> 13:49.968
Cheryl Ortega, John Deasy, and Suzanne Solomon.

13:59.185 --> 13:59.886
I skipped someone.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.967
I thought it was Cheryl, but it was Alicia, right?

14:03.068 --> 14:03.629
It's Alicia.

14:03.649 --> 14:04.069
Sorry about that.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.133
Good morning.

14:09.313 --> 14:14.135
Like everyone before me, I agree for you to adopt the core standards.

14:14.635 --> 14:28.078
I'm here as a person who, for many years, worked as an administrator with students who are on their way to being dropouts because of their low skills, many of which, unfortunately, are ELD learners.

14:28.418 --> 14:32.399
So I'm just here to ask you to, yes, adopt the core standards, but please

14:33.800 --> 14:47.667
Remember, it's very critical that you align those to the ELD standards so that those students who have the lowest skills will not continue to fall through the cracks and so that their teachers can help them.

14:47.967 --> 14:54.091
And I'm just here to say that my concern is for those students, especially who have the lowest

14:55.152 --> 14:58.595
proficiency levels.

14:59.756 --> 15:05.642
I'm afraid that if you don't align the ELD standards to the core standards that their needs will not be met.

15:11.533 --> 15:20.081
President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, and distinguished members of the board, thank you for allowing me to make a few comments this morning on the important decision in front of you on the adoption of the Common Core.

15:20.161 --> 15:22.663
I'm John Dacey, new Deputy Superintendent in LA Unified.

15:23.424 --> 15:24.625
Welcome back to California, John.

15:24.645 --> 15:25.826
It's great to be back to California.

15:26.607 --> 15:27.388
Three minutes, I get them back.

15:28.329 --> 15:30.210
I strongly support the adoption of the Common Core.

15:30.250 --> 15:40.838
California has always taken the lead in the nation for strong standards for youth, and you have taken time to thoroughly research these standards, examine their interplay with our framework, and begin a plan for a strong assessment system aligned with these standards.

15:41.098 --> 15:47.603
Now is the time to formally adopt them and take the lead for the country to see what strong and thoughtful implementation looks like.

15:48.384 --> 15:53.648
I've read the standards thoroughly, covered to cover, and I believe the academics speak for themselves, but it is also a social justice issue.

15:54.292 --> 15:58.815
Universal access and universal acquisition for every youth to these standards is imperative.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.136
I would like to pose two concerns that you should be mindful of.

16:03.057 --> 16:04.478
One is the algebra pathway issue.

16:04.978 --> 16:14.483
While I do not think it should stop the adoption of the Common Core, I believe that there is the potential for youth to be unwisely counseled on which path to take.

16:14.744 --> 16:18.946
I would urge you to publicly monitor who is taking the pathway and how they're doing.

16:19.546 --> 16:25.691
And second, the comments made, I strongly support on the ELV standards that they be strictly and carefully crosswalked with the ELA standards.

16:26.171 --> 16:39.282
I look forward to my part, after you make your decision today, in helping all teachers and principals develop the skills necessary to completely implement these standards so that we can make the success for every single student a reality.

16:39.322 --> 16:39.882
Thank you kindly.

16:40.623 --> 16:41.003
Thank you, John.

16:44.895 --> 17:03.331
Susan Solomon, Vice President of Education for the California State PTA, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, distinguished board members, the California State PTA, representing over 6 million children, supports the Common Core Standards so that all children will be ready for college and for the workforce.

17:04.032 --> 17:07.855
And as has been stated, implementation is key.

17:08.436 --> 17:12.760
And the implementation of these core standards should be done in the real,

17:13.850 --> 17:24.492
landscape of what California's political economy is, so that four to ten years from now, we don't look back at this reform movement and say, what happened?

17:25.292 --> 17:30.573
Our children are not performing as we planned, and the outcomes are not as we thought.

17:30.753 --> 17:35.794
So implementation needs to be thoughtful, careful, and responsible, and smart.

17:36.014 --> 17:36.414
Thank you.

17:37.674 --> 17:38.034
Thank you.

17:39.154 --> 17:42.655
Fred Navarro, Scott Hill, and Monica Henestrosa.

17:49.605 --> 17:56.711
Good afternoon, or near afternoon, President Mitchell, State Superintendent, members of the board, Fred Navarro, Assistant Superintendent, Anaheim Union High School District.

17:57.332 --> 18:00.354
I want to commend you for moving forward with the Common Core Standards concept.

18:00.855 --> 18:04.738
I just want to echo what many of the individuals have said here earlier.

18:04.758 --> 18:07.701
It's really important that you have woven in

18:08.041 --> 18:10.584
the ELD standards throughout the content areas.

18:11.004 --> 18:21.835
As a district that has 87% of its 8th graders in algebra, I can tell you that my math teachers will tell you the greatest obstacle for those kids mastering the subject is their academic literacy.

18:22.495 --> 18:27.500
And by weaving in the ELD standards throughout all the core areas, you'll help us overcome that challenge.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.161
Thank you very much.

18:28.181 --> 18:29.422
Thank you.

18:38.226 --> 18:42.168
Hello, Monica Nestrosa on behalf of the San Diego Unified School District.

18:42.828 --> 18:47.189
I'm here with three messages on behalf of Superintendent Bill Coba and our Board of Education.

18:48.130 --> 18:54.972
We strongly support the adoption of the Common Core Standards with the California additions and there are three issues that I'll outline.

18:55.573 --> 19:01.295
First is that we strongly believe that the adoption will help us better meet our mission of college and career readiness for students.

19:01.335 --> 19:04.216
We think these standards are better equipped to move us in that direction.

19:04.896 --> 19:10.840
Second, we want to highlight the importance that adoption of these standards will have for students that are moving in and out of the state.

19:11.320 --> 19:18.745
San Diego Unified is particularly affected because we serve 10,000 students of military families, and we think that's an important consideration in your vote.

19:19.385 --> 19:24.048
The third is that we stand ready, like many other stakeholders do, to help you with the implementation.

19:24.068 --> 19:30.852
We have a large population of English learner students, and we look forward to working with you on those implementation issues as well as others.

19:31.052 --> 19:31.312
Thank you.

19:38.943 --> 19:41.484
Good morning, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, members of the board.

19:41.644 --> 19:43.585
I'm Scott Hill with School Innovations and Advocacy.

19:43.605 --> 19:45.767
A couple of quick points for you today.

19:46.307 --> 19:51.730
First, like many others, I support strongly and would encourage you to adopt this California version of Common Core Standards.

19:52.050 --> 19:58.213
Second, President Mitchell, Undersecretary Gaither, and Commission Chair Geeting said very well.

19:58.913 --> 20:03.776
And we've heard today, implementation matters, which is why I would make a very strong recommendation to you

20:04.545 --> 20:06.566
Your job today is quite narrow and quite focused.

20:06.767 --> 20:17.974
It is to adopt very specifically the academic content standards and do as little as possible to prejudge or predispose where the state will go in terms of the longer term implementation issues.

20:18.014 --> 20:18.975
Those are all important.

20:19.475 --> 20:22.477
You don't want to prejudge where those will take you into the future.

20:22.517 --> 20:28.381
So I would encourage you to be very specific today in your actions around simply adopting the content standards.

20:28.421 --> 20:28.761
Thank you.

20:29.582 --> 20:30.022
Thank you, Scott.

20:31.567 --> 20:36.083
Chris Steinhauser, Mike Hanson, Walter Richardson, and Michael Schreck.

20:44.113 --> 20:46.897
Good morning, President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell, and members of the board.

20:47.297 --> 20:54.125
My name is Chris Steinhauser, Superintendent of Long Beach Unified School District, as well as a member of the Validation Committee for the Common Core.

20:55.127 --> 21:01.174
On behalf of Long Beach Unified, I urge you strongly to adopt these and we stand ready to support you and others in the implementation.

21:01.294 --> 21:01.895
Thank you very much.

21:03.036 --> 21:03.497
Thank you, Chris.

21:07.571 --> 21:10.452
Good morning President Mitchell, Superintendent O'Connell and members of the board.

21:10.792 --> 21:14.154
I'm here as the Superintendent of President Unified representing 73,000 students.

21:15.014 --> 21:17.795
And I'd just like to slow this down a moment and talk briefly about students.

21:17.835 --> 21:25.098
We're a district of 86% or 86% of our students are students of color, 83% students living in poverty.

21:25.598 --> 21:36.022
A year ago in President Unified we developed a profile of students through our work in equity and access that we thought could make it in Algebra I. These were students who were basic coming out of

21:37.022 --> 21:42.264
7th grade mathematics with a scale score of 325 or around a scale score of 325.

21:42.344 --> 21:49.247
We en masse moved 800 students into Algebra I and folks didn't think they should be there.

21:49.747 --> 21:54.869
I'm proud to report to you that 667 of those students are now proficient moving into high school.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.129
Algebra I is out of the way and they're proficient.

21:57.510 --> 22:01.051
That will make for a dramatically different high school experience almost to a student.

22:01.251 --> 22:03.972
They are poor and students of color.

22:04.592 --> 22:06.253
So rigorous, clear standards matter.

22:06.713 --> 22:08.334
They push us at the local level.

22:08.694 --> 22:09.414
Students benefit.

22:09.794 --> 22:17.678
And all the noise that you will hear downstream, I think, is just all about us adults trying to figure out how to give students access that they so rightly deserve.

22:18.178 --> 22:21.580
We encourage you to strongly adopt the Common Core.

22:21.760 --> 22:22.100
Thank you.

22:22.380 --> 22:22.640
Thanks.

22:22.720 --> 22:30.884
And while Walter is coming up, I want to thank Mike and Chris for their leadership, along with Ray Cortinas, in developing our Race to the Top application.

22:32.230 --> 22:33.532
The traveling team is here.

22:34.072 --> 22:35.414
Glad to see you guys.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.538
Good morning board members, superintendent.

22:38.839 --> 22:43.304
I'm Walter Walsh Richards from the Los Angeles University School District, second vice chair of the district advisory committee.

22:43.364 --> 22:50.434
I represent 461,128 identified Toward student and most of those are left student, English language learning student.

22:51.440 --> 22:56.122
We 100% support the adoption of the core academic standards.

22:56.562 --> 23:02.765
We also, although kids might be minority, they might learn differently, there's nothing wrong with their mind for learning.

23:03.065 --> 23:10.628
We just hope that you will make sure that this staff development, that kids are learning at the grade level that they are.

23:10.648 --> 23:10.988
30 seconds.

23:12.869 --> 23:19.252
middle school, that teachers don't have to teach them at the fourth grade level what they should have known in middle school.

23:19.492 --> 23:22.133
We also support you and your hard work that you're doing.

23:22.173 --> 23:23.614
We're also asking, as Ms.

23:23.634 --> 23:28.736
Ruth Bloom said, I was on the standards team in 1997.

23:29.536 --> 23:39.800
I'm hoping that if you didn't have nobody, no parents or community folks on this one, next time when you do this, have parents and community folks there at the core part of this process.

23:40.040 --> 23:40.741
Thank you very much.

23:41.081 --> 23:41.341
Thank you.

23:44.421 --> 23:45.822
Michael Schreck.

23:50.666 --> 23:50.986
That's all.

23:51.006 --> 23:51.306
That's it.

23:51.606 --> 23:51.847
Great.

23:52.607 --> 23:52.907
Okay.

23:54.469 --> 23:59.712
Thank you all very much, and thanks for helping us keep on our schedule.

24:00.893 --> 24:01.954
Very important comments.

24:02.555 --> 24:12.642
This is a critical, historic opportunity for the state, but we need to be careful as we embark upon this decision.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.863
Board members, questions and comments?

24:17.903 --> 24:18.964
Yvonne and then David.

24:20.405 --> 24:21.306
Well, good afternoon.

24:22.066 --> 24:28.311
Well, first of all, I want to thank all the speakers coming up to give us your input, and particularly the commissioners.

24:29.071 --> 24:32.094
I believe many of you are on Curriculum Commission, right?

24:32.714 --> 24:33.054
Still?

24:33.375 --> 24:33.695
Were?

24:33.835 --> 24:34.215
Was?

24:34.796 --> 24:35.136
Whatever.

24:35.959 --> 24:44.987
And I still remember Sue Stickle, you know, all those years, plugging and helping us with the standard-based reform for many, many years.

24:45.027 --> 24:53.714
So as Kathy gave us, that is a great start, the last 13 years, with the California standard that helped us at the school base to kind of move that forward.

24:54.015 --> 24:57.978
Now, having said that, is now I want to put on the hat of a practitioner.

24:58.919 --> 25:01.321
I mean, many of us get freaked out a little bit, okay?

25:01.341 --> 25:03.323
Honestly, the last two months, say, what?

25:04.468 --> 25:11.030
This is coming, and we're going to change everything we've been doing, you know, the sacred cow of all the standards.

25:11.850 --> 25:16.912
But fortunately, my school starts tomorrow, 2,500 kids returning to Vaughan.

25:17.432 --> 25:24.094
So last Thursday, I was able to bring 130 teachers, all my teachers, pre-K through 12, together.

25:25.154 --> 25:26.355
And I gave them a draft.

25:26.655 --> 25:27.855
I downloaded it and gave them a draft.

25:28.698 --> 25:46.766
And I said, okay, I'm going to serve food, I'm going to serve coffee, I serve everything except liquor, to kind of make sure that I'm not going to get eggs on my face, okay, because I want to really hear what my teachers got to say to inform me how I'm going to vote today, okay, versus what you said that's very important.

25:48.291 --> 25:50.452
So what happened is I tried to sell it first.

25:50.552 --> 25:52.293
I said, wait a minute, I'm educated.

25:52.393 --> 25:54.855
I was educated in China and then Hong Kong.

25:55.515 --> 25:59.297
We have very rigorous international benchmarking standards.

25:59.357 --> 26:04.920
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have made it into UCLA and be sitting right here in this horseshoe.

26:05.381 --> 26:06.261
So I sold that.

26:07.902 --> 26:17.644
This set of standards is college and career ready, benchmark against your greatest nations with the highest test scores, your team, whatever it is.

26:17.944 --> 26:23.685
With my own experience, I said, look, teachers, we have to kind of start switching gears.

26:24.405 --> 26:26.505
Then I put them in the rooms for four hours.

26:27.966 --> 26:30.826
Then they came back, and this is the report.

26:32.726 --> 26:35.767
They said, first of all, the first group said, hey, you know what?

26:37.034 --> 26:40.956
Really, this is fewer standards.

26:41.296 --> 26:43.797
I said, oh, is that a good thing, fewer standards, you know?

26:44.698 --> 26:49.100
But then he said, no, no, no, it's more focused standards, much more focused.

26:49.540 --> 27:03.147
And I know sometimes we blame ourselves, it's mile wide and inch deep for California standards compared to Japan, but those who had the opportunity to visit, you know, schools in Singapore and Japan.

27:03.768 --> 27:06.549
And they said, look, you know, really, like Greg Keating said,

27:07.515 --> 27:18.541
There is that crosswalk, so they're not giving up their beloved standards that's already posted on all the bulletin boards, with the focus standards and deeper.

27:19.342 --> 27:21.343
Oh, good, okay, so they get me going.

27:22.083 --> 27:29.907
Then another group said, I have pre-K through 12, so I'm very, very cognizant of what my secondary teacher's going to say.

27:31.188 --> 27:34.510
Well, this group said, well, it is a progression,

27:35.234 --> 27:42.840
Instead of discrete standards in different grades, it is, like you say, a staircase, very clear progression.

27:43.300 --> 27:45.461
Okay, great, you give me a second point.

27:46.702 --> 27:48.644
Now come my secondary people.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.907
My science teacher and my history social study teachers.

27:53.988 --> 27:55.208
And they said, what?

27:55.849 --> 27:57.930
You mean we are teaching literacy?

27:59.291 --> 28:00.292
Are you out of your mind?

28:00.312 --> 28:01.413
That's what I thought they would say.

28:02.455 --> 28:17.061
No, the department chair said, well, that's nice to have them clearly told us that we are also responsible for writing, reading, and language, and then we will work with our colleagues on that.

28:18.621 --> 28:21.443
Here comes my English department in my elementary.

28:22.463 --> 28:27.425
Now, of course, we have the debate of phonics, whole language, literature,

28:28.405 --> 28:29.125
et cetera, right?

28:29.285 --> 28:36.646
Over there, don't forget, I serve 100% free and reduced, 98% walk-in ELDs, 98%.

28:37.907 --> 28:40.067
They are the school, so don't tell me a subgroup.

28:40.327 --> 28:41.967
They're not subgroup, they are the school.

28:43.508 --> 28:56.930
Then they said, well, if you have a balance of your fundamentals, which they love, the phonemic awareness, okay, the fundamental, then the literature, great, and the information text.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.064
That's a good balance.

29:00.125 --> 29:11.894
And they felt that, hey, look, maybe that will provide the multiple paths for our students who are low-income English learners to be able to kind of weigh in in all three fronts.

29:12.335 --> 29:13.316
And I'm done on this.

29:13.736 --> 29:15.117
Now here comes my math teachers.

29:15.597 --> 29:17.459
Hold on, my math teachers.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.982
Don't forget there's an algebra issue at my school, okay?

29:21.362 --> 29:22.163
Like any schools.

29:22.992 --> 29:29.413
Granted, they said, there is a good balance between procedures, you know, teachers do think of procedures.

29:30.133 --> 29:34.954
In a city school, procedures, you add, you subtract, you do this, you do that, all the procedures.

29:35.434 --> 29:37.475
But do the kids really understand, right?

29:37.795 --> 29:42.735
How you balance understanding and procedures, and this set of standards do balance that.

29:43.916 --> 29:51.117
Understanding and procedures, you know, you bring down the one, you subtract that, you know, those long division stuff, common denominator,

29:51.844 --> 29:55.305
Now the overstuffing of algebra in eighth grade.

29:55.465 --> 29:56.045
Oh my gosh.

29:57.325 --> 30:01.766
Used to be the high school teacher would say, the middle school did not prepare my kids.

30:02.906 --> 30:05.867
And the middle school would say, the elementary, right?

30:06.047 --> 30:08.348
Elementary will go, the preschool, right?

30:08.708 --> 30:10.788
And the preschool will point to the parents.

30:11.188 --> 30:12.269
And parents point to who?

30:12.329 --> 30:13.169
God, I do not know.

30:13.369 --> 30:14.189
Who are they going to do?

30:15.578 --> 30:29.650
But as they look at it, and very clearly, this is different, is before, we have very little learning opportunity for the kids on fractions in elementary.

30:30.531 --> 30:37.957
Now, my third grade teacher woke up and say, oh my gosh, we are going to teach fraction equivalence and ordering?

30:38.777 --> 30:40.119
What refreshing idea.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.880
Of course, they have to go and learn it themselves.

30:41.940 --> 30:42.901
Many of them just kind of, uh.

30:44.099 --> 31:05.416
And then the middle school say, wow, you know, if starting in third grade we do this fractions stuff, by seventh and eighth grade, there's no reason that my school, though as hardcore, difficult, at this point 50% passed the algebra proficiency, 28% algebra two.

31:05.937 --> 31:06.477
It's a struggle.

31:06.517 --> 31:08.499
We started with 8% only three years ago.

31:08.959 --> 31:12.422
So I really stand by algebra, definitely.

31:13.277 --> 31:19.362
But this provide even an algebra plus type of situation and added the geometry.

31:19.922 --> 31:23.245
So with that, let me just say that I'm not as good as Mike Hanson.

31:23.265 --> 31:23.945
Where are you, Mike?

31:24.145 --> 31:26.067
Okay, you get 600 kids up there, I don't.

31:26.367 --> 31:27.608
But anyway, we're getting close.

31:28.168 --> 31:39.677
So now I will say in a leap of faith to my colleagues that I urge you to adopt this CCR or your Common Core Standards.

31:40.963 --> 31:48.104
And I trust that this board, along with CDE and Susteko and everybody else,

31:48.905 --> 32:05.476
that you will very cautiously and strategically complete an implementation plan that take into account of the ELDs, that take into account of students with disabilities, that will network with all the other states.

32:05.536 --> 32:12.401
I believe, Ruth, there are 48 states signed on, not 30, 48, except Alaska and Texas, I think, whatever it is.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.360
Wait, even Puerto Rico is in.

32:16.941 --> 32:20.302
What is California thinking?

32:20.562 --> 32:21.902
That's the faith in that.

32:22.002 --> 32:26.024
But meanwhile, as a board member, I have to say that I trust myself.

32:26.884 --> 32:27.944
At the end, we have to do that.

32:28.484 --> 32:33.506
I trust that I, along with all of you, have the knowledge and the skills and the experience

32:34.441 --> 32:42.189
and know what are some potential pitfalls that we trust that we can create this new implementation plan that will make it work.

32:42.529 --> 32:47.294
So the fortune cookies, I can write it and I hope you all will support it and thank you.

32:50.757 --> 32:51.758
Allen and then David please.

32:53.199 --> 32:56.042
Mr. President, I'd like to make a motion but just a comment before the motion.

32:57.774 --> 33:08.072
And I want to again commend, I know we've done it over and over, but there's a reason that we're commending Greg and Sue and the Commission for their truly outstanding efforts.

33:08.573 --> 33:11.398
And I want to echo what Greg said, substance and adequacy of the

33:12.074 --> 33:13.775
implementation will be the key.

33:14.155 --> 33:22.777
Plans don't implement themselves, people do, and to those that have led the way thus far, I applaud you and I certainly hope we'll be able to work with them on the implementation plan.

33:23.998 --> 33:35.922
I think it's important, and again, I'd like to take full credit for this thought, but again, it's the wonderful work that Greg and Sue and the folks put together in this document.

33:36.382 --> 33:40.403
There's something that is not covered by the standards, or I should say, there's a lot of stuff

33:41.178 --> 33:42.699
That is not covered by the standards.

33:43.480 --> 33:52.466
And I'm quoting from some of the words in here, but the standards should be recognized for what they are not as well as what they are.

33:53.127 --> 33:56.109
Recognized for what they are not as well as what they are for.

33:56.729 --> 34:02.914
The standards define what all students are expected to know and be able to do, not how teachers should teach.

34:04.898 --> 34:08.119
And the standards make references to some particular forms of content.

34:08.319 --> 34:13.542
Indeed, they cannot enumerate all or even most of the content that students should learn.

34:14.242 --> 34:21.225
The standards must therefore be complemented by a well-developed, content-rich curriculum consistent with the expectations laid out.

34:22.245 --> 34:28.108
While the standards focus on what is most essential, they do not describe all or that should be taught.

34:28.732 --> 34:31.915
A great deal is left to the discretion of the teachers and the curriculum developers.

34:32.456 --> 34:37.900
As we're hearing time and time again, this is an open-ended question and answer.

34:38.421 --> 34:49.291
The aim of the standards is to articulate the fundamentals, not to set out an exhaustive list or a set of restrictions that limits what can be taught and beyond what is specified.

34:50.074 --> 35:00.262
The standards set grade-specific standards but do not define the intervention methods or materials necessary to support students who are well below grade-level expectations.

35:01.162 --> 35:10.349
No set of grade-specific standards can fully reflect the great varieties in abilities, needs, learning rates, and achievement levels of the students in any given classroom.

35:11.130 --> 35:16.134
However, the standards do provide clear signposts along the way to the goal of college and career readiness.

35:17.205 --> 35:24.047
And again, I want to talk about the comprehensiveness, if you could indulge me just for a minute, because again, the words are here.

35:24.107 --> 35:33.329
And if anybody hasn't taken the time to go through the thousands of pages, both on the national level and here in California, I suggest that you do.

35:34.069 --> 35:41.131
It is beyond the scope of the standards to define the full range of supports appropriate for ELL learners, which I know have been, it's been raised here today.

35:42.124 --> 35:50.468
At the same time, all students must have the opportunity to learn and meet the same high standards if they are to have access to the knowledge and skills necessary in their post-high school lives.

35:51.729 --> 36:03.375
Likewise, the standards should be read as allowing for the widest possible range of students to participate fully from the outset as permitting appropriate accommodations to ensure maximum partition of students with special education needs.

36:03.995 --> 36:09.058
Here again, technology will have a profound impact in the future and in every area

36:09.817 --> 36:12.459
that the commission touched and that we are looking at.

36:12.819 --> 36:18.443
Technology will be changing the framework and the implementation abilities in ways that we can't even imagine.

36:19.303 --> 36:27.228
So while the ELA and math standards being proposed are critical to college and career readiness, they do not define the whole of such readiness.

36:27.849 --> 36:37.735
Students require a wide-ranging, rigorous academic preparation, and particularly in the early grades, attention to such matters as social, emotional, and physical development and approaches to learning.

36:38.687 --> 36:41.449
And I say that again because there is so much.

36:41.949 --> 36:45.331
There's the movie, I think it was in Amadeus, where they said too many notes.

36:47.193 --> 36:59.240
There can never be too many notes, but these standards proposed on the ELA and MAS standards are a remarkable starting point, and the implementation plan will be everything.

36:59.881 --> 37:03.683
And so I'd like to make a motion that pursuant to Senate Bill 51,

37:07.026 --> 37:20.790
I move that the California State Board of Education hereby adopt the academic content standards as proposed by the Academic Content Standards Commission in English Language Arts and Mathematics.

37:21.590 --> 37:33.833
These standards include the common core and specific additional standards the Commission has deemed necessary to maintain the integrity and rigor of California's already very, very high standards.

37:36.949 --> 37:37.890
I'll second that motion.

37:37.930 --> 37:38.931
I'd like to make a comment.

37:43.274 --> 37:48.559
First of all, like my colleagues, I'd like to thank the commission and Greg and Sue Stickler.

37:49.780 --> 37:53.883
I've also... Stickle.

37:54.164 --> 37:55.605
Stickle.

37:55.765 --> 37:56.866
She is a stickler.

37:57.366 --> 37:58.848
She is a stickler.

37:59.168 --> 38:00.269
That's a part of the legend.

38:02.671 --> 38:08.034
And to you also, Ted, for reminding us what our task is here today and our charge.

38:08.534 --> 38:12.736
And I think it's important that we focus on the Common Core standards.

38:14.217 --> 38:19.899
But I also hear from our colleagues that the standards, as Greg stated, is only the beginning.

38:20.399 --> 38:23.041
It's kind of the destination that we want all our kids to be at.

38:23.761 --> 38:25.842
But the road there is very important.

38:25.882 --> 38:31.925
And I'm hearing from our colleagues that we need to be very diligent, very vigilant,

38:32.392 --> 38:35.854
and mindful of the process of getting us there.

38:36.495 --> 38:41.378
Therefore, the implementation plan is critical, and I've heard that many times here this morning.

38:41.398 --> 38:46.521
So I think, again, I think we have to be vigilant and mindful of that process.

38:47.482 --> 38:52.786
I'd also like to make a comment about the English language learners.

38:53.306 --> 38:54.427
I know that that's been an issue.

38:54.467 --> 38:55.307
I was glad to hear that

38:57.175 --> 39:05.297
Sue Stickle mentioned that the commission was sensitive to the English language learner issue in the state.

39:06.017 --> 39:11.099
And as we all know, 47% of kids go home speaking a language other than English.

39:12.399 --> 39:14.700
41% of our kids in kindergarten are English language learners.

39:14.740 --> 39:19.701
So there's a lot of students that are coming up in those grades and we need to prepare them.

39:20.353 --> 39:27.537
So I think that we need to really work closely and diligently as we move these standards forward.

39:28.158 --> 39:33.561
There's one thing I'd like to suggest in that there was a lot of comments made about English language learners.

39:33.961 --> 39:49.131
We do have an English language advisory committee and I'd like to volunteer that we use that committee very diligently and strategically to help us think this process through in order to address the serious challenges that we have in this state

39:50.251 --> 39:59.374
in regards to educating English language learners, because I'm of the firm conviction if we don't get that right, we're not going to have our future workforce, not only for California, but for the nation.

40:00.034 --> 40:03.515
So just as a thought, I'd like to add that in as a commentary.

40:04.335 --> 40:04.555
Thanks.

40:04.795 --> 40:05.635
Thanks for volunteering.

40:05.655 --> 40:06.836
I think that's good.

40:07.616 --> 40:12.197
I know that there are other board members who have comments that they would like to make before we proceed to a vote.

40:12.257 --> 40:12.377
Ben?

40:16.359 --> 40:17.340
Thank you, President Mitchell.

40:17.620 --> 40:27.250
I'll be brief, both because I have colleagues on the board and leaders in this room who are far more knowledgeable than I am about this issue.

40:28.191 --> 40:30.614
But I did want to make a few quick comments.

40:30.934 --> 40:37.041
I first want to thank the commissioners for their wonderful work, but I also want to thank

40:37.901 --> 40:54.970
I don't think we've acknowledged the leadership of President Obama and Secretary Arne Duncan for getting us, seizing this moment and getting us to where we are today with regards to Common Core Standards and a whole host of other innovative groundbreaking reforms that have occurred throughout this state and this nation.

40:56.511 --> 41:06.296
So as I was thinking about this vote and thinking about the consequential and even historic nature of it, I was trying to bring a

41:07.032 --> 41:10.473
a different perspective to it, which is the perspective of a dad.

41:11.413 --> 41:30.217
I have two very young daughters, neither of whom slept very well last night, who are both going to be, one is 11 months old and Eloise is 11 and Fiona is four, and these standards are going to impact their entire academic life in the state of California.

41:31.097 --> 41:35.318
And so as I was thinking about this vote, a vote

41:36.211 --> 41:47.334
for the status quo or for the Common Core Standards, I was trying to really think about this in terms of what was better for them and what was better for the rest of the children in California.

41:47.354 --> 42:00.497
And as I continue to drill down on it, there has been a lot of talk and a lot of dialogue about whether these standards are higher or lower than the current standards that we have.

42:01.615 --> 42:12.566
The reason I'm going to vote in favor of the Common Core Standards and proudly vote in favor of the Common Core Standards is that I believe they are smarter than the standards that we currently have.

42:13.628 --> 42:18.833
And I think it's just because we all know a lot more about how kids learn

42:19.353 --> 42:25.701
as well as about what types of skills students are going to need to enter a 21st century economy.

42:26.082 --> 42:30.307
We know a lot more now than we did over a decade ago about those issues.

42:30.747 --> 42:38.517
In terms of how kids learn, I think everybody has said this more eloquently than I can, but it does seem to me that

42:39.017 --> 42:54.108
building organically upon ideas and concepts so that kids are actually learning deep knowledge of concepts rather than just memorizing answers is the best way for us to prepare kids to be critical thinkers.

42:54.829 --> 42:57.951
I also think that there's been a lot of interesting

42:59.119 --> 43:09.548
back and forth about the English language art standards and about the addition of an emphasis on non-fiction study and thinking.

43:10.168 --> 43:14.432
And I thought about that a lot because I am the son of two writers.

43:14.552 --> 43:15.573
My dad was a novelist.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.574
My mom was a children's book writer.

43:18.015 --> 43:24.660
And so I grew up in a home with a deep appreciation for literature and words and writing.

43:29.289 --> 43:31.550
very important to me personally.

43:32.271 --> 43:37.633
And I think that the Common Core Standards still embrace that, and it's critical.

43:37.713 --> 43:44.177
Every child in California has to grow up and graduate with a knowledge of art and literature.

43:45.499 --> 43:58.569
But I also think it's very important that we acknowledge that our kids today are going to grow up and graduate into an economy that is wildly different than anything we have ever seen before.

43:58.929 --> 44:02.212
An economy that is dominated by information.

44:04.039 --> 44:18.171
The students that succeed in that economy are going to be the students that graduate with the skills and the tools to critically integrate and critically analyze that information and to do it quickly and to do it intelligently.

44:18.671 --> 44:26.037
And I think that these standards are an important step forward in terms of preparing our students for that economy.

44:27.889 --> 44:42.172
I do believe that there are many other factors that are currently contributing to the problematic, to say the least, problematic status quo for children in California.

44:42.952 --> 44:55.514
But it's also true that even if we turn around and transform every single failing school in California, but those schools are teaching kids to the wrong standards, we will not have done our job.

44:56.034 --> 45:08.281
So this is a critical vote and a historic vote and I'm honored to vote yes because I believe it's good for my two daughters, Fiona and Eloise, and I believe these standards are good for all the children of California.

45:08.741 --> 45:09.082
Thank you.

45:09.842 --> 45:10.322
Thank you, Ben.

45:10.542 --> 45:10.803
Greg?

45:11.903 --> 45:12.303
Thank you.

45:12.584 --> 45:14.285
I too will try to be brief.

45:14.365 --> 45:18.307
I try to come at this also from a couple different perspectives.

45:19.634 --> 45:23.617
people with a lot more knowledge and I know more about the intricacies of this.

45:24.477 --> 45:31.363
But, you know, as I looked at it, I tried to look at it as, you know, my role as a business leader in this state.

45:32.043 --> 45:40.410
And clearly I think that these common core standards do have the ability to help us strengthen our competitiveness

45:42.291 --> 45:50.944
worldwide, particularly if they are benchmarked against the best that we have in this country and benchmarked internationally as well.

45:51.865 --> 45:57.453
Because unquestionably, you know, we continue, we'll need to have

45:59.184 --> 46:10.508
today's students who will be tomorrow's workforce have the computational, analytical, communications skills that we can measure consistently around the country.

46:10.788 --> 46:20.311
And I think that is of great value to us in the business community and will ready young people for their next destination.

46:21.490 --> 46:26.034
So I think that for me has become an important piece of this.

46:26.475 --> 46:35.662
I too, though, kind of like Ben, I looked at it, I tried to look at this from another perspective and more of a personal perspective.

46:35.722 --> 46:41.667
And my own experience, I think, helped me understand the value of this a little bit more.

46:41.727 --> 46:48.113
Because of job transfers in my corporate career,

46:49.314 --> 46:56.137
Our two sons attended schools in six different states as we moved around the country.

46:57.057 --> 47:12.902
And I witnessed firsthand the dramatic differences in rigor and quality of standards and expectations that both schools and teachers had for my kids to meet them as we were in these various places.

47:13.863 --> 47:17.004
And so as parents, my wife and I,

47:18.076 --> 47:40.227
made it our business to make sure that our kids were learning, or whatever they were learning and wherever they were learning in these various schools and various states, that they had the quality and the caliber of rigor that assured that they were being adequately prepared to succeed in college.

47:41.487 --> 47:44.829
And I guess, you know, I feel that they were lucky.

47:45.969 --> 48:01.860
just like probably your kids, the people in this room, are pretty lucky because, you know, they have parents who took it upon themselves to intervene and advocate in their behalf.

48:03.081 --> 48:11.467
And, you know, my point in that is that expectations for excellence shouldn't depend on luck.

48:12.748 --> 48:14.169
They shouldn't depend on luck.

48:15.012 --> 48:19.714
or where you live, or who your parents are, or what your economic status is.

48:20.254 --> 48:27.856
Because as all of us in this room know, many of our nation's kids are not as fortunate as our kids in this room.

48:29.317 --> 48:36.919
And so, you know, I think that has become a valuable lesson to me, you know, as I've been sort of thinking about this.

48:37.665 --> 48:47.607
You know, I always kind of defer to, and some of these people in this room have heard me do this before, but I always refer to the great lessons that I learned from my grandmother.

48:47.627 --> 48:57.530
My grandmother was unusually a college-educated woman, as her father, my great-grandfather, was a university president.

48:58.710 --> 49:03.111
And she put in our bedroom, our brother and I, from the time I was a little kid,

49:03.988 --> 49:08.852
a little plaque that we saw every day that said, no one rises to low expectations.

49:09.932 --> 49:12.294
And I saw that every single day of my life.

49:12.354 --> 49:19.560
And so I guess I just say all that to say, from where I sit, I'm going to say, hallelujah.

49:21.141 --> 49:32.269
Because I think, at last, high expectations for all kids, no matter their ethnicity, no matter where they live, no matter their language,

49:33.904 --> 49:36.726
can and should become a reality.

49:37.747 --> 49:51.979
And so, you know, Common Core standards, I think, from my perspective, can assure that every child at least has an equal opportunity to reach their full potential.

49:52.519 --> 49:58.865
So I am anxiously looking forward to voting yes on Common Core standards.

49:59.785 --> 50:00.266
Thank you, Greg.

50:00.606 --> 50:00.906
Excellent.

50:01.247 --> 50:01.587
Jonathan?

50:02.884 --> 50:13.093
And I'll dovetail member Jones's hallelujah and try and secure my place in heaven and try and be brief to the extent that I am able to.

50:16.316 --> 50:21.460
One, I want to thank just everyone who works so hard on these standards.

50:22.041 --> 50:22.861
They are amazing.

50:23.702 --> 50:25.183
The only statement that

50:26.479 --> 50:28.800
that I'll make is one around the equity issue.

50:29.821 --> 50:45.209
We know that we have issues with certain population, and I'll echo Superintendent Deasy's comments with regard to making sure that we're monitoring how algebra continues.

50:45.969 --> 50:55.734
It sounds like there's room for alignment with the eighth grade goal and our history as a policymaking body as it relates to eighth grade.

50:56.520 --> 51:05.227
And it also sounds like there's plenty of room for alignment with our English language learners as well.

51:05.287 --> 51:09.371
So with that, I will strongly support.

51:10.111 --> 51:10.432
Thank you.

51:13.314 --> 51:15.115
Thank you for all the people that work so hard.

51:15.816 --> 51:17.958
Thank you for the sentiments expressed around the room.

51:18.458 --> 51:19.419
And I'll call for the question.

51:23.263 --> 51:23.543
I do.

51:23.563 --> 51:24.323
I do.

51:25.304 --> 51:28.385
It does give me the chance, though, to say, me too, and stop.

51:28.965 --> 51:29.485
Excuse me.

51:31.166 --> 51:31.206
Hi.

51:31.726 --> 51:36.468
I'm Angela Patella, Interim Chief Counsel for the State Board of Education.

51:36.508 --> 51:40.869
And before you proceed to the vote, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment.

51:40.929 --> 51:43.010
I believe the reference was to Senate Bill 51.

51:43.070 --> 51:45.631
So do you want to correct that?

51:45.771 --> 51:48.292
So the reference should be to Senate Bill 51X.

51:48.992 --> 51:49.012
51X.

51:53.519 --> 52:03.544
So I... It's Senate, okay, it can be Senate Bill 1 or more specifically Senate Bill X5-1.

52:03.665 --> 52:08.167
So let me show you the dyslexia with which I've struggled.

52:08.267 --> 52:11.069
The motion pursuant to Senate Bill X5-1.

52:13.659 --> 52:22.721
I move that the California State Board of Education hereby adopt the academic content standards as proposed by the Academic Content Standards Commission in English Language Arts and Mathematics.

52:23.181 --> 52:33.403
These standards include the Common Core and specific additional standards the Commission has deemed necessary to maintain the integrity and rigor of California's already extremely high standards.

52:33.863 --> 52:36.864
Motion's been made by Mr. Arkatov, seconded by Mr. Lopez.

52:36.924 --> 52:38.944
The question has been called by Mr. Ashwandan.

52:39.004 --> 52:41.305
All those in favor, please signify by raising your hand.

52:43.171 --> 52:44.292
Thank you, the vote is unanimous.

52:45.594 --> 52:47.235
Members, this is a historic moment.

52:52.581 --> 53:03.552
It's a historic moment for the state of California, more importantly for the children of California, for Ben's kids, my kids, all of our kids, this will matter.

53:04.609 --> 53:16.695
I'd like to make the following statements with relation to the work and many of the comments that have been made that I think will help steer us into the next phase into this implementation.

53:16.735 --> 53:17.655
You're looking puzzled.

53:18.496 --> 53:18.716
OK.

53:20.077 --> 53:22.858
That I think will help move us now into implementation.

53:23.738 --> 53:30.882
So first, this is, as many of us have said throughout our discussion today, the beginning of a process and not the end of one.

53:31.482 --> 53:32.983
And therefore, on behalf of the board,

53:33.855 --> 53:47.718
I'd like to direct CDE and board staff to create an implementation plan as defined in the legislation and to work with the legislature to launch a curriculum development process that can begin to operationalize these standards.

53:48.578 --> 53:59.741
In the course of that work, we hope that the framers will take into account the comments made today regarding the shaping of curriculum and individual courses from the collection of standard elements that we've adopted today.

54:02.196 --> 54:14.505
I'd also like to direct the staff of the Academic Standards Commission, that mighty staff of 21, to proceed with technical cleanup of the draft report we have before us.

54:15.426 --> 54:23.232
We've discussed today and elsewhere several inconsistencies that reflect nothing more than the time pressure that the commission was under.

54:24.033 --> 54:27.876
And we'd appreciate their continuing work to resolve those and clarify those.

54:30.007 --> 54:52.116
Further, we hope that the Curriculum Commission and the Framework Committees, or whatever the apparatus is, but the implementation organizations that flow from this, will give consideration to the commentary from the Academic Content Standards Commission, which is separate from the standards we've adopted today, but important in understanding the Commission's thinking.

54:53.564 --> 55:01.970
I would especially commend to them and to members of this board the statements of the Commission regarding English language learners and students with disabilities.

55:04.171 --> 55:19.361
And finally, I want once again to thank the members of the Academic Content Standards Commission, its Chair, Greg Geeting, and its Project Director, Sue Stickle, for their extraordinary work on behalf of California and its children.

55:20.502 --> 55:23.304
Thanks to you, California remains a beacon to the nation.

55:24.249 --> 55:32.338
and a leader in the movement to establish high standards and, importantly, high outcomes for all of our children.

55:33.319 --> 55:33.619
Thanks.

55:33.900 --> 55:36.683
We'll take a five-minute break, and then the board will go into closed session.
