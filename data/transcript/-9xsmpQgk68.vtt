Everyone's present.

Happy New Year.

00:57.200 --> 01:03.200
I hereby call the January 2023 meeting of the State Board of Education to order at 8.31

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200

And I'd like us to commence by saluting the flag.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.200
Member Lewis, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
Yes.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.200
Salute.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.200
Pledge.

01:14.200 --> 01:22.200
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:22.200 --> 01:30.200
which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
Thank you so much.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.200
And at this time, I'm going to turn it over to State Superintendent Tony Thurmond.

01:36.200 --> 01:40.200
Good morning, Madam President, members of the board.

01:40.200 --> 01:50.200
It is my honor now to swear in Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond to continue a new four-year term as a board

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200

Are you ready to begin?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
I am ready.

01:56.200 --> 01:57.200
Very good.

01:57.200 --> 02:03.200
If you would, please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200

Against all enemies.

which I am about to enter. Thank you, member Escobedo. Would you like, would you like to

04:57.340 --> 05:05.500
say a few words? Oh surely. It's been a privilege to be part of this board for the last year

05:05.500 --> 05:11.300
and a half. And I look forward to another four years. We're definitely at an exciting

05:11.300 --> 05:19.620
time, you know, as we going through this post pandemic, you know, era. And truly look forward

05:19.620 --> 05:25.980
to working with not only amazing colleagues that I, you know, feel very close to, but

05:25.980 --> 05:34.580
also an amazing staff that has been just a great support. And I know that we collectively

05:34.660 --> 05:45.420
make a significant enhancement in the lives of our teachers and the lives of, you know,

05:45.420 --> 05:53.900
millions of students in California. So it's truly a privilege to serve on this board.

05:53.900 --> 05:59.100
And it is wonderful to have you and all of the other members here. We have a lot of important

05:59.100 --> 06:05.420
work to do. And with that, we'll launch into item one, our state board projects and priorities

06:05.420 --> 06:12.900
item to take up the annual election of officers only. The state board staff recommends that

06:12.900 --> 06:18.420
the SBE take up the annual election of officers and we will hold an election now for the position

06:18.420 --> 06:24.700
of president and vice president for 2023. The bylaws require that the state superintendent

06:24.700 --> 06:29.300
preside over the election of the president. Superintendent, I turn it over to you.

06:31.780 --> 06:36.260
Thank you. Just one moment, please.

06:54.700 --> 07:06.300
Okay, we shall begin. In keeping with article four of the state's board's bylaws, I would

07:06.300 --> 07:13.460
like to call for nominations for the office of president. No member may nominate or second

07:13.460 --> 07:20.100
the nomination for himself or herself. Six votes are necessary to elect an officer and

07:20.100 --> 07:26.420
each officer elected shall serve for one year or until his or her successor is elected.

07:26.420 --> 07:33.420
I will now open the floor for nominations for the office of president. Are there any

07:33.420 --> 07:42.940
nominations? Superintendent Thurman, I'd like to make a nomination, please. I'd like to

07:42.940 --> 07:47.820
nominate. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to nominate, nominate Linda Darling-Hammond for

07:47.820 --> 07:52.980
the office of president. Thank you, board member Clever Woods. Is there a second to

07:52.980 --> 08:03.980
this nomination? I'd like a second. There is a second. I will now open the floor for

08:03.980 --> 08:11.300
voting now that we have a second. We will also open the roll for any public comment

08:11.300 --> 08:16.780
and for members of the public wishing to provide public comment on this item, you can do so

08:16.780 --> 08:22.340
by calling the telephone number that you now will see on your screen. And so let me

08:22.340 --> 08:29.660
turn to you, Brooks and staff. Are there any individuals requesting to provide public comment?

08:29.660 --> 08:37.060
No, we currently do not have anybody in the queue for public comment. Very good. Thank

08:37.060 --> 08:46.740
you for that. Seeing that there is no public comment, that we have a nomination and a second,

08:46.740 --> 09:00.060
Brooks, would you please call the roll? Member Yoshimoto-Towry? Yes. Member Rodriguez? Yes.

09:00.060 --> 09:10.460
Member Porter? Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson? Enthusiastic, yes. Member Roscoe-Gonzalez?

09:10.940 --> 09:22.860
Yes. Member Olken? Yes. Member McQuillan? Aye. Member Lewis? Yes. Vice president Clever Woods?

09:24.140 --> 09:35.580
Yes. Member Escobedo? Yes. President Darlene Hammond? Yes. Passes unanimously. Congratulations.

09:36.540 --> 09:45.180
Thank you very much. I will reserve my comments until the president's report, but I am truly

09:45.180 --> 09:50.780
grateful for the opportunity to be a part of the great work that we are doing on this board and

09:50.780 --> 09:56.940
working closely with Superintendent Thurman. So I'm pleased to be taking this on for another year.

09:56.940 --> 10:04.060
And I will now open the floor for nominations for the Office of Vice President. Are there any

10:04.060 --> 10:15.260
nominations? Yes. Member Rodriguez? I would like to nominate Member Clever Woods.

10:16.540 --> 10:24.140
Is there a second for that nomination? Member Olken? Thank you. And I guess at this point we

10:24.140 --> 10:28.780
display the public comment slide again in case there are any further public comments as we still

10:28.780 --> 10:34.540
have it up. If anyone wants to make a comment, please call the telephone number and use the

10:34.540 --> 10:41.900
access code provided on the slide that is shown now. And do we have any public comment? No, we do

10:41.900 --> 10:50.940
not. All right. Brooks, can you please call the roll? Member Yoshinomura-Towery? Yes. Member

10:50.940 --> 11:00.140
Rodriguez? Yes. Member Porter? Yes. Member Petillo-Brownson? Smiling beneath my mask, yes.

11:03.100 --> 11:14.060
Member Roscoe Gonzalez? Yes. Member Olken? Yes. Member McQuillan? Yes. Member Lewis? Yes.

11:14.780 --> 11:21.420
Vice President Clever Woods? Yes. Member Escobedo? Yes. Member Darlene Hammond?

11:22.620 --> 11:28.460
And another enthusiastic yes. Congratulations. Congratulations unanimously.

11:31.100 --> 11:37.500
It is my pleasure to announce Cynthia Clever Woods as Vice President for 2023. Congratulations.

11:38.620 --> 11:43.260
And with that auspicious start, do you want to say anything before we get going?

11:45.020 --> 11:51.820
Just how honored I am to be able to serve on the Board and how extremely honored I am to be able

11:51.820 --> 11:56.540
to serve as Vice President for this year. Thank you so very much for the support.

11:58.060 --> 12:04.620
We appreciate all that you are doing and that you will do in the year to come. Now for general

12:04.620 --> 12:12.140
announcements. There is one item on the agenda that has an addendum. Item one, the 2023 State

12:12.220 --> 12:16.860
Board Screening Committee recommendations regarding appointments to the Advisory Commission

12:16.860 --> 12:22.460
on Charter Schools, the California Practitioners Advisory Group, and the Instructional Quality

12:22.460 --> 12:30.940
Commission. In terms of the consent calendars, the proposed waiver consent items are W1 through W5,

12:31.580 --> 12:38.700
and the proposed regular consent items are items 6 through 9. There are no public hearings on this

12:38.700 --> 12:47.180
agenda. And then we have one change in the agenda. We'll reopen item one State Board priorities

12:47.180 --> 12:53.020
shortly to hear reports from the State Superintendent and myself, and we'll reopen item one again

12:53.020 --> 12:59.900
tomorrow to take action on the preliminary report of actions, draft November 2022 meeting minutes

12:59.900 --> 13:04.700
to take up appointments to Advisory Commissions and to report on our liaison assignments.

13:05.660 --> 13:10.460
Members of the public who wish to call in for public comment should view the live stream of

13:10.460 --> 13:16.300
the meeting to know at what time public comment will occur for each item. Public comment may be

13:16.940 --> 13:21.820
provided by dialing the phone number and entering the participant access code,

13:21.820 --> 13:27.580
then following each of the operator's prompts. Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller

13:27.580 --> 13:33.340
queue. The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

13:33.420 --> 13:37.980
We'll also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers

13:37.980 --> 13:44.460
if they are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect. Public comment will be limited

13:44.460 --> 13:50.620
to one minute per speaker. Item 13 is the general public comment item during which members of the

13:50.620 --> 13:55.900
public may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the Board's agenda.

13:56.540 --> 14:01.500
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking, keep your cameras on,

14:01.500 --> 14:06.620
except during the scheduled breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's

14:06.620 --> 14:11.660
virtual meeting. And for each item on the agenda, there will be an opportunity for Board members

14:11.660 --> 14:16.700
to raise their Zoom hand if they would like to ask a question or make a comment.

14:16.700 --> 14:21.740
And so we'll now reopen item one and turn it over to State Superintendent Tony Thurmond

14:21.740 --> 14:28.940
to provide his report. Superintendent Thurmond. Thank you, Madam President, and congratulations

14:28.940 --> 14:36.700
again to you, President Darlene Hammond, and to Vice President Glover Woods. And I'm honored to

14:37.340 --> 14:43.020
work and serve with you both and to all of the members of the Board. As this is the first time

14:43.020 --> 14:48.860
that we are together in this new year, I want to say Happy New Year to you all. And I'm thinking

14:48.860 --> 14:56.940
back to just the last few days where we celebrated the memory, legacy, and honor of Dr. Martin Luther

14:56.940 --> 15:05.500
King Jr. And it is with that memory that I think of a spirit of hopefulness for our state

15:05.500 --> 15:12.300
and for the state of education, for our nation, and for our world. I think often of the quote

15:12.300 --> 15:18.220
that Dr. King said that everyone can be great because anyone can serve. And in that way,

15:18.220 --> 15:26.140
I thank you all for serving the students and families of California. I'd like to start out

15:26.140 --> 15:37.980
by talking about a wonderful honor that we have starting next month to recognize 256 distinguished

15:37.980 --> 15:44.700
schools in the state of California. These are schools that have demonstrated academic success

15:45.260 --> 15:51.900
in supporting our students, and it has been a tradition in California to celebrate these schools

15:51.900 --> 15:57.260
in February in Disneyland. And this will be the first time that these schools can be in person

15:58.620 --> 16:05.420
since the pandemic. And we certainly invite you to join us in recognizing the distinguished schools

16:05.420 --> 16:11.660
for their great honor and for what their work represents for what we can do for other students

16:11.660 --> 16:17.500
in the state. Some of those students are students who you probably saw were impacted during the

16:17.500 --> 16:25.260
pandemic, and we saw some of those reflections during the presentations about the dashboard

16:25.260 --> 16:31.180
and chronic absenteeism in particular, and seeing that for many students, absenteeism rates have

16:31.180 --> 16:37.660
increased. And because of that, the Department of Education, we've kicked off a series on how

16:37.660 --> 16:44.460
to address chronic absenteeism. And our first of many webinars was held yesterday with a number

16:44.460 --> 16:49.260
of districts sharing best practices for things that they've done before the pandemic, during the

16:49.260 --> 16:53.980
pandemic, and post-pandemic to address the needs of our students. We all know that during the

16:53.980 --> 17:00.300
pandemic, many of our families were food insecure. Our schools serve more than 800 million meals

17:00.300 --> 17:05.740
during the pandemic. We know that there's been a spike in depression and anxiety for many of

17:05.740 --> 17:10.940
our students. I had a chance to do some home visits just a few weeks ago with families

17:10.940 --> 17:15.580
who were chronically absent, and I'd like to thank the folks at Mount Diablo Unified for

17:15.580 --> 17:21.580
allowing me to join their team. And I heard consistently the impacts of the pandemic and

17:21.580 --> 17:29.420
depression, you know, housing insecurity, you name it, all the things that our families are facing.

17:29.420 --> 17:34.380
But we know that they're more than the sum of their circumstances, and there are ways that our

17:34.380 --> 17:39.900
schools can support our families, and the state has provided great resources in our state budget

17:39.900 --> 17:46.620
to do that, not the least of which is a 13% increase in LCFF and other resources that can

17:46.620 --> 17:52.380
be used to support outreach and support. And so we will continue to lift up examples of ways to

17:52.380 --> 18:00.380
support our schools and how to provide engaging instruction and programs that help our students

18:01.100 --> 18:07.180
to accelerate their learning when they have returned to school. We're also busy with our

18:07.180 --> 18:12.380
efforts to support teacher recruitment in our state, and within days we'll be making some

18:12.380 --> 18:17.580
announcements about a new public service announcement campaign to help reach those

18:18.220 --> 18:23.180
who would be interested in becoming a teacher in California, to make them aware of the great

18:23.180 --> 18:30.700
resources that we have, like a $20,000 scholarship, a grant for anyone who wants to become a teacher

18:30.700 --> 18:34.780
or to become a counselor in our schools. Dr. Darling-Hammond and others have worked very

18:34.780 --> 18:42.380
closely to make this happen, and we are actively engaging many who would be interested in serving,

18:42.380 --> 18:47.420
those who are in AmeriCorps programs, those who are working as tutors, those who work as classified

18:47.420 --> 18:52.300
staff, those who work in expanded learning to make sure that they can get connected to all the

18:52.300 --> 19:00.380
resources that exist to become a teacher. And so we'll be making announcements about that in the

19:00.380 --> 19:07.260
days to come. And so we want to continue in a spirit of hopefulness about the things that

19:07.260 --> 19:13.260
we can do to overcome the challenges of the last few years. Today on this agenda you'll hear an

19:13.260 --> 19:19.980
update on the efforts to implement our universal transitional kindergarten program, groundbreaking

19:19.980 --> 19:26.140
that no other state has found a way to guarantee preschool for every four-year-old in our state.

19:26.220 --> 19:32.780
And we look at every aspect of early education and opportunities for our students. Related,

19:32.780 --> 19:38.300
I would just point out that the governor's proposed budget speaks to many items that

19:38.300 --> 19:45.980
many of you have spoken to as priorities, including a proposal to provide an additional

19:45.980 --> 19:53.100
allocation for providing reading coaches and specialists at California schools, $250 million

19:53.820 --> 19:58.700
to build on what was in last year's budget, another proposal for doing that. And as we're

19:58.700 --> 20:05.340
working to implement it again, just the spirit of hopefulness that this is a great opportunity

20:05.340 --> 20:11.340
for California and it builds on a series of learning acceleration webinars

20:13.020 --> 20:19.420
that we have been implementing and many of you have been a part of.

20:23.100 --> 20:30.700
Let's see if we get some technical help. Sounds like the echoing is stopping.

20:34.940 --> 20:41.420
Well, if it's good news, let the good news echo and resound that we have big challenges on the

20:41.420 --> 20:48.620
horizon, but we have the resources and the willpower and the political will to make this

20:48.620 --> 20:54.060
happen for California students. And so with that, I will say that we're prepared to work closely

20:54.060 --> 21:01.660
with this board. I would mention that we have one new staff person to announce and it's someone

21:01.660 --> 21:09.260
that you know. You will see him on a regular basis and you probably have seen him in our legal team.

21:10.300 --> 21:17.900
Bruce Yonahiro has been promoted to fill one of the vacancies of our deputy legal counsel

21:17.900 --> 21:22.140
and you will have the opportunity to work with him and we look forward to making an announcement

21:22.140 --> 21:27.500
for you shortly about our new general counsel in the days to come. This concludes my report.

21:28.460 --> 21:33.420
Thank you so much and thank you, Superintendent Thurman. Congratulations on your inauguration

21:33.420 --> 21:39.980
and re-election. I am honored to serve with you. It's been a pleasure as we tackle so many issues

21:39.980 --> 21:48.220
together and your passion for the children and educators in this state is inspiring and

21:48.220 --> 21:54.860
necessary as we engage in all of this problem solving. So thrilled that you are with us for

21:54.860 --> 22:00.380
another four years as well and I want to just say I appreciate Governor Newsom appointing me to

22:00.380 --> 22:06.300
serve a second term at this critical time when we are facing so many challenges and also making

22:06.300 --> 22:12.380
so much progress as Superintendent Thurman just described. I'm grateful to my colleagues on the

22:12.380 --> 22:19.260
board for all of your ongoing commitment to the path toward a shared vision of schools that serve

22:19.260 --> 22:25.420
the whole child, that empower families, that support educators and that enlist the help of

22:25.420 --> 22:31.420
the whole community in joyful and purposeful learning. As you know, schools are at the heart

22:31.420 --> 22:37.260
of any community and our work to build this whole child framework, one in which students are

22:37.260 --> 22:42.220
supported in their health and well-being as well as their academic studies, is important to

22:42.220 --> 22:47.340
supporting communities in good times and in challenging times like those we've been experiencing.

22:47.900 --> 22:54.380
And as you know, in addition to the challenges of COVID-19 over the last nearly three years now,

22:54.380 --> 22:59.900
the effects of climate change are being felt regularly across the state. These past few weeks,

22:59.900 --> 23:05.900
the intense winter storms were devastating for so many. Lives were lost, homes were lost,

23:05.900 --> 23:15.100
businesses were destroyed. At one point, 429 schools were closed, affecting 185,000 students

23:15.100 --> 23:23.020
across 19 counties. This is just over 3% of the students in California. And most of those campuses

23:23.020 --> 23:29.660
resumed operations fairly quickly, in part due to the great efforts of the staff of many

23:29.660 --> 23:37.100
state agencies, including the Department of Education and the State Board. But the storms

23:37.100 --> 23:42.140
will continue to be felt, and there is one town that's been almost entirely evacuated, and

23:42.860 --> 23:46.620
we will continue to feel the effects of the storms for many, many weeks to come.

23:47.340 --> 23:55.980
And I certainly want to express both empathy and gratitude to the many teachers and principals and

23:55.980 --> 24:01.900
school site staff and parents and students who came together to both weather these storms and

24:01.900 --> 24:07.900
to support these families and children and to focus on safety in our schools. And I also want

24:07.900 --> 24:12.140
to acknowledge that these storm systems, along with the drought and fires that we've been

24:12.140 --> 24:18.220
experiencing, will continue, even as our state leaders and many of our school system leaders are

24:18.220 --> 24:25.100
working proactively to limit challenges to our environment, to move us from fossil fuels to a

24:25.100 --> 24:31.100
clean energy future. We have fleets of electric buses, school buses across the state, and many

24:31.100 --> 24:36.300
schools being renovated. But as we continue to cope with these challenges, it's going to be

24:36.300 --> 24:42.940
important for us, I think, to further develop the work that we began when COVID first arrived

24:42.940 --> 24:49.260
for instructional continuity. And we passed a requirement that districts create instructional

24:49.260 --> 24:57.820
continuity plans and to activate efforts to close the digital divide. Superintendent Thurman and

24:57.820 --> 25:03.100
the governor and the first partner and I all worked very hard on that. And then the legislature

25:03.740 --> 25:09.180
and the federal government finally kind of came online. But we're going to need to build on those

25:09.180 --> 25:15.100
efforts so that we can provide for instructional continuity, find ways to be flexible and fast on

25:15.100 --> 25:21.820
our feet in the use of technologies for learning and when physical presence is disrupted. And this

25:21.820 --> 25:27.500
is true whether it's for an individual student who has to be, who's out because they are unwell or

25:27.500 --> 25:33.100
they're needing to be quarantined or whether it is for an entire school or town as in some of

25:33.100 --> 25:38.380
these instances. Given all that we've done to close the digital divide, we should be seeking

25:38.380 --> 25:44.060
ways to ensure that learning is never short-circuited and that we can use these tools to ensure access to

25:44.060 --> 25:48.700
learning materials and opportunities. So we'll be launching a conversation to explore how we can

25:48.700 --> 25:54.700
enable this kind of support for students and schools. Fortunately, Governor Newsom's budget

25:54.700 --> 25:59.980
that was released last week demonstrates the strong commitment both to further environmental

25:59.980 --> 26:06.220
progress and to further educational progress in the state with the whole child approach that's

26:06.220 --> 26:11.500
so necessary to helping students weather these kinds of events. Despite the revenue being down,

26:12.380 --> 26:17.820
Governor's budget maintains strong fiscal support for schools, continues the programs that we've

26:17.820 --> 26:23.820
already launched to accelerate learning and address troubling disparities by strengthening our

26:23.820 --> 26:29.980
state's commitment to equity. Both the investments in the Proposition 98 Rainy Day Fund and the

26:29.980 --> 26:36.460
allocation of one-time funds over a five to seven-year period as we have seen with community schools

26:36.460 --> 26:41.500
and the recruitment of retention funds for educators will support provide that continuing

26:41.500 --> 26:47.900
support for initiatives. The budget allows for all of these future-minded investments to continue.

26:47.900 --> 26:53.100
A universal preschool as Superintendent Thurman noted, community schools, physical and mental,

26:53.100 --> 26:57.820
health services, after school and summer school programs, intensive tutoring programs,

26:58.380 --> 27:03.340
all of these will be critical to ongoing learning recovery. And we've already begun to see the

27:03.340 --> 27:09.020
effects of these investments in the steeper than normal gains in English language arts and math

27:09.020 --> 27:17.340
that we saw last year for the 740,000 students who took the state smarter balance tests in 2021

27:17.340 --> 27:25.020
and 2022. If we maintain those kinds of steep gains, we will rapidly return to the trajectory,

27:25.020 --> 27:30.860
the positive trajectory that schools have been on. This year's substantial increase in the local

27:30.860 --> 27:37.260
control funding formula, despite that tough fiscal picture overall, provides that solid foundation

27:37.260 --> 27:43.420
for our education system. You know that we've moved from a highly inequitable and inadequate

27:43.420 --> 27:49.740
system of funding before 2013. We were among, if you account for cost of living, we were the last

27:49.740 --> 27:54.460
in the nation in spending. Now we are above the national average and we are beginning to see

27:55.340 --> 28:00.940
the gains and outcomes that accompany those investments. It's also heartening to see an

28:00.940 --> 28:07.020
investment in a literacy roadmap, which will create a cohesive blueprint for improving reading

28:07.020 --> 28:13.180
and writing instruction, bringing together the proven strategies, the evidence-based strategies

28:13.180 --> 28:19.660
that we know of that are articulated in our very lengthy ELA ELD framework and make them

28:19.660 --> 28:25.180
more concrete and applicable with instructional supports for teachers and for the literacy coaches

28:25.180 --> 28:32.860
that superintendent noted we will be expanding. The governor and the administration have focused

28:32.860 --> 28:39.740
on our most vulnerable students through the LCFF equity multiplier. This next development in the

28:39.740 --> 28:45.260
local control funding formula will strengthen equity by supporting schools that serve the

28:45.260 --> 28:51.980
very neediest students in a way that should fortify our resolve to attack disparities for

28:51.980 --> 28:57.740
the betterment of all, and we'll be seeing some accompanying efforts to focus in our

28:58.540 --> 29:04.780
local control accountability plans on being sure that students who are struggling are identified

29:04.780 --> 29:08.780
and their needs being met. In addition to the good news in the budget, we have some good news

29:08.780 --> 29:15.020
here at the state board. This month we welcome three new staff members, chief counsel Kieran Gill,

29:16.060 --> 29:22.380
senior policy director Laura Rodriguez, and assistant policy director Michelle Valdivia.

29:22.380 --> 29:27.180
We have a terrific team. I'm excited we're strengthening our ranks further with these

29:27.180 --> 29:31.580
highly qualified individuals. Kieran comes to us from the attorney general's office,

29:31.580 --> 29:36.540
where she served as a deputy attorney general representing state agencies in the areas of

29:36.540 --> 29:42.540
education, health, and welfare programs and state and federal litigation cases since 2018.

29:43.100 --> 29:51.100
She received the 2021 AG award for excellence in COVID-19 litigation and the 2021 civil division

29:51.100 --> 29:56.140
recognition for competency restoration defense and just last week was recognized for her work

29:56.140 --> 30:02.220
as a member of the education litigation team at the 2022 civil division recognition ceremony.

30:02.940 --> 30:08.700
Laura comes to us from the college board where she was senior director for government relations

30:08.700 --> 30:13.260
and served as an internal content expert on California assessment policy, among other

30:13.260 --> 30:18.940
responsibilities. This will come in very handy as she continues to take responsibility for us

30:19.660 --> 30:27.180
for the assessment CTE and Golden State Pathways assignments. Michelle has been a department of

30:27.180 --> 30:32.860
finance fiscal analyst since 2018. She has deep experience in analyzing, reviewing, and making

30:32.860 --> 30:38.460
recommendations on fiscal affairs and analyzing legislation, preparing memos, and representing

30:38.460 --> 30:44.940
the department of finance before the legislature. Michelle is a former California senate fellow and

30:44.940 --> 30:49.980
AmeriCorps member. She holds a bachelor's degree in social welfare from UC Berkeley.

30:49.980 --> 30:57.420
So welcome to all three of these new staff. And finally, yes, we can take a moment to applaud them

30:57.420 --> 31:03.660
and we will have other moments to appreciate them over the coming year. And then I need to express

31:03.660 --> 31:13.420
my profound appreciation and a bit of bittersweet sadness for state policy director Leila Fai-Mudin

31:13.420 --> 31:19.420
who is moving on to other pursuits at the end of the month. Leila has been a fearless champion for

31:19.420 --> 31:24.620
our students, especially our English learners and students with disabilities. She's been a courageous

31:24.620 --> 31:31.420
voice for more equitable practices in our K-12 system. She has a strong moral compass. She keeps

31:31.420 --> 31:36.780
students at the forefront of all of her work. She reminds us of the importance of student voice in

31:36.780 --> 31:43.340
bringing those that we serve to the decision-making table. She puts equity first and knows that the

31:43.420 --> 31:48.460
future of the state depends on us closing the achievement gaps that we experience.

31:49.260 --> 31:55.340
Leila is a system thinker who connects the dots and she's been very instrumental to our work to

31:55.340 --> 32:00.780
bridge health services and education supports and create the infrastructure needed to make the

32:00.780 --> 32:07.420
child youth behavioral health initiative a success. She's been a stalwart on the state board team,

32:07.420 --> 32:13.180
quick to help colleagues and dig in wherever necessary. And I know that I speak for all of us

32:13.180 --> 32:19.500
and say we'll miss her wit and her problem-solving and her occasional baked goods. And

32:19.500 --> 32:25.580
Brooks, I think you have a certificate for Leila. So we want to join me in a round of applause

32:26.140 --> 32:31.740
and pass the ball to Brooks to award the certificate.

32:31.740 --> 32:44.140
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. The certificate has been delivered.

32:45.980 --> 32:51.660
And I'm actually not sure if this is a physical certificate or a virtual certificate at the

32:51.660 --> 32:55.660
moment. It is a physical certificate. We just handed it over. Brooks, let us know

32:55.740 --> 33:02.780
how you want to proceed. I think we just got a big expression of gratitude and thanks.

33:02.780 --> 33:08.780
Looks like something is happening in the boardroom.

33:25.660 --> 33:36.780
Yes.

33:38.060 --> 33:46.780
President Darling-Hammond, can you hear us now? Brooks, I don't know if you are near a microphone

33:47.500 --> 33:57.660
to let us know how you want to proceed. I can hear you now. Okay. We apologize. The boardroom

33:57.660 --> 34:04.380
was muted. It was such an overwhelming response of gratitude for Leila that apparently we knocked

34:04.380 --> 34:12.620
out the mics. So she has received her physical certificate and she gave us a large smile and

34:12.620 --> 34:19.260
double thumbs up and we are all trying to contain our appreciation as well as our sadness

34:19.260 --> 34:24.380
that she's departing. But we are ready for the next item. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

34:24.380 --> 34:30.460
Thank you. And thank you, Leila, wherever you are. We're going to move on to item two.

34:31.020 --> 34:37.020
Item two is the 2023 United States Senate Youth Program and we're going to be recognizing

34:37.100 --> 34:44.220
California's selected student delegates and alternates. The CDE recommends that we present

34:44.220 --> 34:50.860
the 2023 United States Senate Youth Program and recognize the 2023 delegates and alternates.

34:50.860 --> 34:56.060
And this item will be presented by Dina Fong of the CDE. Dina, please begin.

34:56.060 --> 35:05.340
And we're not hearing anything from the boardroom at the moment, so

35:06.540 --> 35:09.420
just letting you know that the mics need to come on.

35:11.020 --> 35:17.740
Good morning. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Great. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond,

35:17.740 --> 35:23.660
State Superintendent Thurmond, and honorable board members. I'm Dina Fong, the United States Senate

35:23.660 --> 35:29.100
Youth Coordinator for California and work in our California Department of Education's

35:29.100 --> 35:36.620
Communications Division. I'm honored to be here today to introduce and recognize our 2023 U.S.

35:36.620 --> 35:43.420
Senate Youth students. The U.S. Senate Youth Program is sponsored by the U.S. Senate and funded

35:43.420 --> 35:51.100
and administered by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. Now in its 61st year, the program

35:51.100 --> 35:56.060
provides an opportunity to selected students to gain an in-depth view of the Senate and the

35:56.060 --> 36:02.060
federal government, as well as provide a foundation for those considering a future in public service

36:02.060 --> 36:08.060
on the local, state, or national level. High school juniors and seniors are nominated by

36:08.060 --> 36:13.900
their principal to apply for this highly competitive merit-based program. To qualify,

36:13.900 --> 36:19.820
students must currently be serving in an elected or appointed leadership position in student

36:19.820 --> 36:27.900
government or a civic or educational organization representing a constituency and serving others

36:27.900 --> 36:34.140
for the entire school year. Our students have gone through a rigorous application process and

36:34.140 --> 36:39.340
were selected based upon their leadership qualities, academic achievement, school and

36:39.340 --> 36:44.460
community involvement, and commitment to public service. The last phase of the program is to

36:44.460 --> 36:50.460
formally present our 2023 U.S. Senate Youth delegates and alternates. These students are

36:50.460 --> 36:55.740
among the best of the best in their school, community, and the state. There is no doubt

36:55.740 --> 37:00.140
that they will succeed in whatever they do and will serve their communities with passion.

37:01.420 --> 37:06.860
Our two delegates will represent California during Washington Week in Washington, D.C.

37:06.860 --> 37:12.140
from March 4th to 11th, where they will participate in a comprehensive public service

37:12.140 --> 37:19.100
leadership and education experience, including hearing from speakers from the three branches

37:19.100 --> 37:24.620
of government and the national media. The delegates will each receive a $10,000 college

37:24.620 --> 37:29.740
scholarship for undergraduate studies with encouragement to study coursework in political

37:29.740 --> 37:35.100
science or history. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to introduce each student and give them

37:35.100 --> 37:42.620
each time to say a few words. Our first delegate is Fiona Liu, a senior at Northwood High School

37:42.620 --> 37:48.780
in Irvine. She has been described as someone with an insatiable thirst for knowledge who is

37:48.780 --> 37:54.860
not afraid to confidently voice her ideas and approaches topics with an open mind and eagerness

37:54.860 --> 38:01.500
to learn. Fiona serves as the policy director of the California High School Democrats. In that

38:01.500 --> 38:07.180
position, she helped launch the organization's inaugural legislative platform by supporting

38:07.180 --> 38:12.700
youth-related bills on behalf of their members and created a legislative advisory committee

38:12.700 --> 38:18.300
to improve the democratic process in supporting bills. Fiona is one of three students from her

38:18.300 --> 38:23.740
school on the Irvine Unified School District Student Advisory Committee, where she advocates

38:23.740 --> 38:29.740
for mental health initiatives and student board member representation. She is a member of the

38:29.740 --> 38:35.100
California Department of Education's Youth Advisory Council as part of the communications

38:35.100 --> 38:42.540
and legislative team and has also interned for Assemblywoman Cotty Petrine Norris. Her community

38:42.540 --> 38:47.740
activities include serving as partnership director for Generation Upboards and as a co-lead and

38:47.740 --> 38:53.980
project manager of a local chapter of Dear Asian Youth, for which she researched a book available

38:53.980 --> 38:59.580
in different Asian languages that show people how to report hate crimes. Fiona wants to explore

38:59.580 --> 39:05.100
majors in comparative studies in race and ethnicity, public policy, and education and

39:05.100 --> 39:10.540
learn about race and its intersection in every aspect of society. She has a passion to support

39:10.540 --> 39:15.660
the underserved and advocate for progressive policies to help marginalized groups stand in

39:15.660 --> 39:20.540
solidarity. Congratulations, Fiona. I'll turn it over to you for a few words.

39:22.540 --> 39:28.060
Thank you so much, Dina, and I just wanted to start off by saying how grateful I am for this

39:28.060 --> 39:33.580
chance to represent California on a national level and learn from some of the most distinguished

39:33.580 --> 39:38.620
people in this country who are and continue to be the trailblazers I look up to in my public service

39:38.620 --> 39:45.580
career. And with this learning opportunity, I'm excited to further my goals in learning how young

39:45.580 --> 39:52.460
people and future generations can engage in both local, state, and federal policy and use this as

39:52.460 --> 39:57.980
a change-making vehicle. I like to do this with an emphasis on racial justice, which I'm very

39:57.980 --> 40:03.420
passionate about, and making systemic change for low-income communities, especially in healthcare

40:03.420 --> 40:11.420
and education access. And along my journey, I like to remind myself what public service means to me,

40:11.420 --> 40:15.820
and that's investing back in the communities that have fostered so much growth within

40:15.820 --> 40:22.220
myself throughout my life and also branching out to other communities to learn and unlearn and

40:22.780 --> 40:25.580
fight for equity and solidarity. So thank you so much.

40:27.820 --> 40:35.340
Thank you, Fiona. Our second delegate is Summer Sun, a senior at Chico High School in Chico.

40:35.340 --> 40:41.020
She has been described as a great example of a humble, quiet leader who leads by modeling hard

40:41.020 --> 40:46.860
work and supportive energies. Positivity radiates whenever she's around, and she naturally inspires

40:46.860 --> 40:53.420
others. Summer is ASB president at her school, where she oversees school-wide functions and

40:53.420 --> 40:58.460
student activities and reports at district board meetings. She has been in student government

40:58.460 --> 41:03.980
every year since ninth grade and has served as class president, ASB secretary, and the school

41:03.980 --> 41:09.980
site council. She is the president of the Students Organized Friendship Alliance Club, whose mission

41:09.980 --> 41:14.700
is to practice social skills with special education students and create a safe space

41:14.700 --> 41:21.180
to celebrate everyone's differences. She founded Read to Rise, a nonprofit global youth reading

41:21.180 --> 41:26.940
program in the local community, Haiti, and China that raises funds to donate books and supplies

41:26.940 --> 41:32.780
for children in poverty and pairs high school students as reading pals for 200 local kids from

41:32.780 --> 41:38.540
economically disadvantaged families. Her passion for volunteerism has earned her the president's

41:38.540 --> 41:45.660
Volunteer Service Gold Award, and as her school's delegate for Girl State, an outstanding citizenship

41:45.660 --> 41:51.660
award for leadership, kindness, and integrity. She plans to major in cultural anthropology with

41:51.660 --> 41:57.420
possible minors in public policy or international relations, followed by a graduate program in law

41:57.420 --> 42:03.660
and government. She is committed to improving the lives of underrepresented groups and minorities.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.220
Congratulations, Summer. Please say a few words.

42:10.140 --> 42:15.500
Hello everyone. I just want to say I'm so happy to be here. Thank you so much for this amazing

42:15.500 --> 42:20.460
opportunity to attend the Senate Youth Program. I just wanted to first thank my teachers, counselor,

42:20.460 --> 42:25.020
principal, and also my superintendent for not just supporting me through the application process,

42:25.020 --> 42:29.180
but all throughout my years of education because I would not be here without them.

42:30.140 --> 42:35.900
I think to me, public service means taking personal experiences and transforming them into

42:35.900 --> 42:42.140
positive impacts. I think that everyone has their own unique story that then allows them to identify

42:42.140 --> 42:48.140
needs in their community and serve in a way that really only they can. I think I honestly just

42:48.140 --> 42:52.700
can't believe that I'm going to be in DC in less than two months. I think this firsthand experience

42:52.700 --> 42:58.540
on how our government works is just truly so special, and most importantly, I'm excited to

42:58.700 --> 43:04.460
learn how to use what I learned to better serve underrepresented groups in my community and my

43:04.460 --> 43:10.060
country. So thank you again for this amazing opportunity. I really cannot express enough how

43:10.060 --> 43:13.100
grateful I am. Thank you, Summer.

43:15.500 --> 43:20.540
If Fiona or Summer should be unable to participate in Washington Week, then one of our alternates

43:20.540 --> 43:27.180
will take their place. Our first alternate is Nathaniel Nate Watts, a senior at Carlsbad

43:27.260 --> 43:32.860
High School in Carlsbad. He has been described as an exceptional human being and a natural leader

43:32.860 --> 43:38.140
committed to service who has the rare qualities of calm, balance, and good humor which allow him

43:38.140 --> 43:44.860
to excel without burning out. Nate serves as a student representative for the Superintendent's

43:44.860 --> 43:50.460
Student Advisory Council at Carlsbad Unified, where he represents student interests and provides

43:50.460 --> 43:55.740
feedback to the district superintendent and the leadership team. He serves as president and captain

43:55.740 --> 44:00.860
of the speech and debate team, vice president of the Indian Culture Club and mock trial,

44:01.500 --> 44:05.580
a delegate of the Model United Nations, and first baseman of the baseball team.

44:06.620 --> 44:11.980
Nate was also recognized as his team's most inspirational player. He mentors younger students

44:11.980 --> 44:16.700
on the debate team as well as elementary students through the Carlsbad Unified Champions,

44:16.700 --> 44:23.260
a district-wide group of students. Nate developed a strong interest in politics and civic engagement

44:23.260 --> 44:28.780
during his time as a Democratic Congressional Campaign Summer Fellow, where he participated in

44:28.780 --> 44:35.500
voter registration, strategizing, organizing town halls, and inspiring youth involvement in politics.

44:36.140 --> 44:43.900
A National Merit semi-finalist and AP scholar with honors, Nate is only one of 22 students worldwide

44:43.900 --> 44:50.940
who has achieved a perfect score on the AP English language exam. He hopes to study political science

44:50.940 --> 44:56.860
and international relations with a focus on the impacts and mitigation of environmental crises.

44:57.420 --> 45:02.620
He wants to dedicate his life to public service to create safer, sustainable communities for

45:02.620 --> 45:06.860
generations to come. Congratulations, Nate. Please say a few words.

45:09.180 --> 45:12.860
Hi, everyone. I just want to say I'm truly grateful for this opportunity.

45:13.580 --> 45:17.020
I want to take this time to thank Ms. Fong, Superintendent Thurmond,

45:17.020 --> 45:22.540
President Hammond, my parents, probably most importantly, as well as everyone back at Carlsbad

45:22.540 --> 45:28.220
Unified. Service to me honestly looks like using opportunities in the present to build a better

45:28.220 --> 45:34.140
future by correcting our mistakes in the past. And in the short term for me, that looks like

45:34.140 --> 45:38.540
continuing to work with my local congressman, Mike Levin, to build a better life for us here

45:38.540 --> 45:43.580
in the 49th District. But then hopefully in the future, in a time past college, I really want to

45:43.580 --> 45:48.860
work on the climate crisis and working on building my generation's solutions to that problem.

45:49.500 --> 45:52.780
So thank you everyone for this opportunity and have a blessed rest of your day.

45:54.620 --> 46:01.740
Thank you, Nate. Our second alternate is Sabrina Brandeis, a senior at Monte Vista High School

46:01.740 --> 46:08.460
in Danville. She is described as a team player who is thoughtful, exhibits grace under pressure,

46:08.460 --> 46:13.340
concerned about the greater good, and hopes to make a difference. Sabrina serves as a youth

46:13.340 --> 46:18.780
commissioner on the Danville Parks and Recreation Commission and represents Danville's teams and the

46:18.780 --> 46:23.660
planning of recreational activities and the management of parks, as well as participating

46:23.660 --> 46:29.420
in decisions that improve Danville's public spaces. She has also served on the Danville Town Council

46:29.420 --> 46:34.220
for five years to represent the team voice in her community through outreach and service projects.

46:34.860 --> 46:40.620
In response to anti-Semitic incidents, she and her sister created a project encouraging students

46:40.620 --> 46:46.460
to discuss intolerance in the community, which led her to become the Stronger Than Hate video

46:46.460 --> 46:52.220
contest national winner. As speech captain of her school's speech and debate team,

46:53.180 --> 46:58.380
she won first place nationally at the Yale Invitational, placed in the top 10 at the

46:58.380 --> 47:03.340
tournament of champions, and placed fourth in California. She was one of two women from

47:03.340 --> 47:10.140
California to represent the state as a senator in the American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation program

47:10.140 --> 47:17.420
and was chosen by staff as the most outstanding senator for 2022. A national merit semi-finalist,

47:17.420 --> 47:22.860
Sabrina would like to study political science followed by law school and work for social justice

47:22.860 --> 47:28.220
and fight unjust policies and bring justice to those who need it. Congratulations, Sabrina.

47:28.860 --> 47:35.340
Please say a few words. I just wanted to start off by saying I am so grateful to have been given

47:35.340 --> 47:40.700
this opportunity and have been chosen as an alternate for this program. As a child, I made

47:40.700 --> 47:45.580
some of my favorite memories attending the annual Danville Health Workshop. It brought me so much

47:45.580 --> 47:49.900
joy to connect with the other kids in my community every year and of course enjoy the free hot

47:49.900 --> 47:54.700
chocolate. As president of the Danville Youth Council and youth commissioner of the Danville

47:54.700 --> 47:59.580
Parks and Recreation Commission, I've worked to recreate some of the joy and community engagement

47:59.580 --> 48:05.420
of the experiences that I enjoyed so much as a child. To me, public service is about connection.

48:05.980 --> 48:10.540
I take pride in connecting with people in my community about their experiences and what they

48:10.540 --> 48:15.420
see a need for. And as one of California's two delegates to Girls Nation, I formed connections

48:15.420 --> 48:20.300
with girls from all over the country, expanding my worldview with new experiences through

48:20.300 --> 48:25.340
conversations. I hope to continue working to foster connections and engagement in every

48:25.340 --> 48:30.780
community that I'm part of. I want to connect with communities and work to fight unjust policies.

48:31.340 --> 48:35.980
I believe that justice is achieved by first understanding the experiences of another.

48:35.980 --> 48:41.340
And in each connection I make, I hope to add to my understanding of my community and the world.

48:44.220 --> 48:49.980
Thank you so much, Sabrina. Once again, I'd like to again say congratulations to our four

48:49.980 --> 48:54.380
students. You are all doing amazing things in your communities, and I look forward to seeing

48:54.380 --> 48:59.740
what's next. What I've shared today is just a small sampling of their many accomplishments.

48:59.740 --> 49:05.180
We would be here all day if I shared everything they're involved in. I also want to add that all

49:05.180 --> 49:09.820
of the students have been described by their advisor, teacher, principal, or superintendent

49:09.820 --> 49:14.700
as someone who definitely stands out from the rest as evidenced from what you heard today.

49:15.340 --> 49:20.140
I think we can surely feel confident and encourage that these outstanding students are shining

49:20.140 --> 49:25.340
examples of our future and they will go on to do more great things and make a positive difference

49:25.340 --> 49:30.780
in our world. I'll turn this back to President Darling-Hammond and State Superintendent Thurman

49:30.780 --> 49:34.460
and the other board members to offer their congratulations. Thank you very much.

49:34.460 --> 49:48.060
Congratulations to all of you. Am I unmuted now? Yes. Okay. And we really appreciate the level of

49:48.700 --> 49:55.340
commitment to contributing that you expressed and the wisdom that we heard from each of you.

49:56.140 --> 50:01.020
We're going to put the public comment slide up while I pass the ball to Superintendent Thurman

50:01.020 --> 50:07.580
to say a few words so that others can also call in and congratulate you. Superintendent Thurman.

50:08.380 --> 50:13.420
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. I just wanted to say congratulations to Fiona and Summer

50:13.980 --> 50:19.980
and Nate and Sabrina for your incredible accomplishments in your local community

50:19.980 --> 50:24.620
and your schools and what you're now doing on behalf of the state of California.

50:24.620 --> 50:29.180
And what you've done already is so impressive in the things that you've laid out for yourselves,

50:29.180 --> 50:36.380
racial justice, environmental justice, public service. It's just so inspiring and so hopeful.

50:36.380 --> 50:40.460
And we know that you're going to do great things. And I suspect that one day we're all going to end

50:40.460 --> 50:47.180
up working for you at some point. And as someone who started in student government, I just want

50:47.180 --> 50:51.580
to encourage you to continue doing this. Look how it's opening doors for you and the communities

50:51.580 --> 50:56.540
that you serve. We couldn't be more proud. Congratulations to you and your families.

50:56.540 --> 51:05.340
And thank you for taking up the call to serve. As I opened with, Dr. King said,

51:05.340 --> 51:09.660
everyone can be great because anyone can serve. You're showing your greatness for you, your

51:09.660 --> 51:14.620
families, your community, and our state. So congratulations. Thank you, Dina, to you and

51:14.620 --> 51:20.940
your team for helping to shepherd this process and to bring forward these incredible leaders.

51:20.940 --> 51:23.580
With that, I'll turn it back to President Darling-Hammond.

51:24.220 --> 51:30.780
Thank you. And plus one to all of that. We do have the public comment slide up and I want to see if

51:30.780 --> 51:37.340
there is any public comment. Anyone who wants to make a comment can call the number shown on the

51:37.340 --> 51:44.380
slide and dial the access code. The operator will let you know when you're online. Is there any

51:44.380 --> 51:50.860
public comment? We do not have anyone in the queue for public comment. All right. And so now I can

51:50.860 --> 51:58.940
open it up to the board members who I know have some congratulations to offer. We're going to

51:58.940 --> 52:07.020
start with Member Porter. Hello, everyone. Fiona, Nate, Sabrina, Summer, congratulations on behalf

52:07.020 --> 52:12.540
of all the students of California. I just want to say thank you for your commitment. Each of you is

52:12.540 --> 52:17.260
working in such niche areas, but something that really resonated with me through all of your

52:17.260 --> 52:22.940
speeches is your emphasis on empathy and community-centered conversations and dialogue,

52:22.940 --> 52:29.900
and I just want to continue to encourage you to use your voice for good, speak up for those who

52:29.900 --> 52:37.900
can't, and congratulations for representing our state at the highest level. Terrific. Thank you.

52:37.900 --> 52:44.140
Member Rodriguez? Thank you. Good morning. I would also like to take this moment to congratulate you

52:44.140 --> 52:51.980
and to let you know how inspired I am with your level of commitment to service and service of

52:51.980 --> 52:59.020
others. Your kindness and compassion is something that really touches me, and your intentional

52:59.020 --> 53:06.220
leadership has filled me with hope this morning. I wish you all the best, and as Superintendent

53:06.220 --> 53:14.060
Thurmond said, we will definitely all be working for you someday. Your leadership is fantastic.

53:14.860 --> 53:20.780
So I look forward to seeing what you do and what you continue to do, because you've already

53:20.780 --> 53:31.900
achieved so much. Member Lewis? Thank you. I think you're going to keep hearing this resonate

53:31.900 --> 53:37.260
throughout all the board members, how impressed we are with what we've heard that you've already

53:37.260 --> 53:43.820
accomplished and the dreams you have for yourselves, for your community. I just love some of the

53:43.820 --> 53:50.540
things that you talked about, equity, solidarity, and giving a voice to the underrepresented.

53:51.980 --> 53:58.780
It is so encouraging just to see the passion that you as young people have and all of the things

53:58.780 --> 54:03.500
that you've done that people at my age never thought about doing when we were in high school.

54:03.500 --> 54:08.780
I mean, you've accomplished so much, and there's no doubt in my mind that you're going to fulfill

54:08.780 --> 54:13.260
all of the dreams and you speak with such passion that I know that you're going to do all of these

54:13.260 --> 54:17.900
great things that you want to do for your community, and as some of you said, for the nation.

54:17.900 --> 54:23.260
So I just appreciate you and congratulations to you for your appointment, and I know that you're

54:23.260 --> 54:29.820
going to do well and represent California well. Congratulations to all of you. Thank you. Member

54:29.820 --> 54:37.900
Lewis? Member Glover-Woods, and then member Olken, and then member Orozco-Gonzalez. Thank you, and I

54:37.900 --> 54:44.140
just will say ditto ditto ditto. I second and third those emotions. All of you young people

54:44.140 --> 54:51.340
are absolutely amazing, and first let me say congratulations to you for being the cream that

54:51.340 --> 54:58.780
has risen to the top in this particular area and being that voice. I'm so excited about what you're

54:58.780 --> 55:04.700
doing in the present and really what you will be doing in the future. Being that voice for the

55:04.700 --> 55:10.460
voiceless in all of those different areas that you've shared with us is something that we need,

55:10.460 --> 55:17.660
and I know your contribution now and your contribution as you continue to go forward

55:17.660 --> 55:23.260
is definitely definitely definitely going to make our world a better place. So again, I say

55:23.260 --> 55:29.420
congratulations to you. Wish you all the best as you go to Washington, whether you're serving there

55:29.420 --> 55:36.700
or serving here, I'm just happy you're serving. Congratulations once again. Thank you so much.

55:37.340 --> 55:43.820
Member Olken? Thank you. I just want to echo again what my colleagues have already said.

55:44.620 --> 55:53.420
I spend my day job is largely in a high school, and I get to see incredible young people every day,

55:54.220 --> 56:02.380
and your leadership, your sense of commitment to others. The thing I think that I love the most

56:02.380 --> 56:09.820
is your belief in the value of every person and wanting to foster conversations across difference

56:10.700 --> 56:19.260
and to show not just how we're different but what we have in common just really resonated

56:19.260 --> 56:28.620
with me, and it stands out, and it's why I think all of us on this board and all educators across

56:28.620 --> 56:38.460
our state do the work we do, and so as we get ready for two days of meeting and thinking about

56:38.460 --> 56:46.620
things at a statewide level, getting back to what it's really about, which is you, is the best

56:46.620 --> 56:50.620
possible start, so I want to thank you for all you've done. Good luck and congratulations,

56:50.620 --> 56:56.220
and thanks for inspiring us this morning. That's already a huge gift that you've given us.

56:57.820 --> 57:00.620
Thank you. Member Roscoe Gonzalez?

57:02.940 --> 57:10.220
I think ditto, right? Exactly what all our members said is I'm so impressed with all that you have

57:10.220 --> 57:16.460
accomplished as a second grade teacher. I want to share your accomplishments with my class

57:16.540 --> 57:22.940
because you're extraordinary role models, and it just gives me so much hope for our future,

57:22.940 --> 57:30.460
and I just think I love the passion of you sharing all your ideas and just your empathy,

57:30.460 --> 57:37.820
kindness, and commitment to what is ahead of, and I'm so excited to see what the future holds for

57:37.820 --> 57:44.380
you because I know it's just not just bright, but it's just illuminating, so adelante to Washington

57:44.380 --> 57:52.460
and good luck, and I know that you will just thrive and shine exemplary, so congratulations.

57:53.900 --> 57:56.380
Thank you, and Member Yoshimoto Tauri?

57:57.500 --> 58:03.260
Thank you. Fiona, Summer, Nathaniel, and Sabrina, I just wanted to say I'm proud not only as an

58:03.260 --> 58:10.860
educator this morning, but also as a mother. You are such an inspiration, and what I notice is that

58:10.860 --> 58:15.740
as you've taken these leadership positions, you expressed today that you're also very much a

58:15.740 --> 58:21.900
learner and very much a listener, and I think that's something that has to be emphasized

58:22.620 --> 58:28.540
because that's going to continue you on your path and creating space for other people's voices,

58:28.540 --> 58:33.340
so I just wanted to say we're all behind you, and be courageous and keep going. Thank you.

58:33.340 --> 58:43.260
Thank you so much. We are so pleased to see you and to send you off on this adventure, as

58:43.900 --> 58:49.180
one of the board members said, you know, you're serving both here and some of you in Washington,

58:49.180 --> 58:55.900
and all of that contribution will make a difference. With that, I think we want to say

58:56.460 --> 59:02.540
congratulations. I don't know if the photos that were to be taken have gotten taken, but hopefully

59:02.540 --> 59:10.140
they have. We'll take one second in case there's any more of that needed, and we will. Thank you

59:10.140 --> 59:16.780
so much for being with us this morning, and we're going to move on now to we're going to conclude

59:16.780 --> 59:21.980
this information item, and thank you, Dina. I also want to say for all that you've done to make this

59:21.980 --> 59:31.740
possible, and move on to item number three, and item three is the California assessment of student

59:31.740 --> 59:36.620
performance and progress and the English language proficiency assessments for California update

59:36.620 --> 59:41.900
on program activities. This is an information item. There is no specific recommended action

59:41.900 --> 59:49.500
at this time, and the item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton and Mal Vang of the CDE. Cheryl,

59:50.140 --> 59:56.860
please begin. Good morning, and happy new year, Superintendent Thurman, President Darling-Hammond,

59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.940
Vice President Glover-Woods, and board members. Again, my name is Cheryl Cotton. I'm Deputy

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:06.460
Superintendent of our Instruction, Measurement, and Administration branch. With me today to present

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:11.820
these items are Mal Vang, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division,

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:16.460
and Tony Alpert, Executive Director of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.860
The item before you today is an information item.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:29.580
As we begin a new year, it seems fitting to take a moment and reflect on the great strides

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.220
California has made in its statewide assessment system, and to share with you what's on the

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:40.620
horizon. We'll begin today with an update from both me and Dr. Vang on California's commitment

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.860
to innovation and assessments that support teaching and learning. We'll then turn it over

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:50.060
to Tony Alpert, who will summarize the recent demonstration of concept study and resulting

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:55.100
deeper learning resources in California, of which California was an integral part.

01:00:55.740 --> 01:01:03.740
Two of the goals of California's statewide assessment system are to support teaching and learning

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:09.100
and incorporate technology where appropriate. California transitioned to the California

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:15.740
Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, or CASP, in 2014, and there have been numerous

01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:21.180
advancements throughout the past seven years. Over the next several slides, we will highlight

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.380
accomplishments that have demonstrated California's commitment to innovation

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.740
and assessments that support teaching and learning with a focus on the CASP and the

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:34.780
English Language Proficiency Assessment for California, or LPAC. I would like to begin

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:41.580
with a recent accomplishment regarding California's status in the Federal Assessment Peer Review

01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:47.980
process. I am happy to be able to start off the new year with some positive news regarding

01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:01.180
the peer review status of the CASP and LPAC summative assessments. Assessment Peer Review

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:06.380
is a process during which the CDE submits documents to the U.S. Department of Education,

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:12.300
or ED, demonstrating that California's assessments meet the federal requirements for validity,

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:19.500
reliability, and fairness established for states by the Every Student Succeeds Act,

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:24.860
or ESSA. As new assessments become operational, the CDE must provide additional evidence for

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:31.180
peer review, covering each assessment that is required under ESSA. Peer review is often

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:37.020
an iterative process, with states submitting additional evidence to meet the requirements

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:42.940
as evidence becomes available. In November, we were pleased to receive notice from the ED

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:49.020
that our Smarter Balanced summative assessments in English Language Arts and Literacy, or ELA,

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:57.020
and mathematics fully met all requirements. This is a significant accomplishment for California,

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:03.740
and we are grateful to staff at CDE, ETS, and the consortium for getting us to this result.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:11.740
We also received encouraging results from other assessments that were submitted in 2021 and 2022.

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:16.620
Those assessments were the California Alternate Assessment, or CAAs,

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:22.620
for ELA and mathematics, the California Science Test, or CAST, and the summative

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:29.340
English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, for LPAC. Each assessment was rated

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:35.020
as substantially meets peer review requirements, which means that most elements were fulfilled,

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:39.420
but some additional documents are required in order to fully meet all requirements.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:46.860
In June of 2023, we will submit the additional evidence. In addition, we will be completing our

01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:52.700
first submissions for the summative LPAC, summative alternate LPAC, and CAA for science.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.380
The findings thus far in our peer review feedback reflect both the quality of the assessments

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:03.980
themselves as well as the quality of the evidence documents that were provided and presented for

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:10.220
evaluation. The California assessment system, which includes both the CAST and the LPAC,

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:15.100
has been many years in the making, and collectively they reflect California's commitment

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:19.420
to innovation and assessments that support teaching and learning.

01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.820
And now I will turn it over to Mal Vang to provide some background

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:35.420
on the development and administration of California's assessments. Thank you.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:53.980
Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning. And I'd like to express my happy New Year greetings to you.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:04.060
And congratulations, Superintendent Thurmond. I want it on your re-election. I am happy to be

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:11.500
a part of this organization. And just a couple other words of congratulations to our

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:15.180
President Darling-Hammond and Vice President Glover-Words on your

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:22.700
new roles or continuing in your new roles. As Cheryl mentioned, I'm Mal Vang. I'm the Director

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:27.420
for the Assessment Development and Administration Division at the California Department of Education.

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:32.140
And I look forward to working with, continuing to work with all of you.

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:41.340
With our next slide, I would like to just give a little background on our transition as Cheryl

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:50.220
set the stage that as the State Board of Education has adopted new standards in our state,

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:58.460
for example, we continue to develop academic assessments to meet these challenging standards.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:05.180
And after the State Board's adoption of the Common Core State Standards in English Language, Arts,

01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:15.420
and Literacy and Mathematics in 2010, California joined the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:25.900
in that academic year of 2010-2011 with the understanding that this would bring immense

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:35.180
benefit when we are joined and being a part of a multi-state consortium. So by joining the

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:42.620
Smarter Balanced Consortium, we offered, we can offer at that time our nearly 300,000 educators

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:48.940
in our state a comprehensive assessment system that reached far beyond just the end of year

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:55.260
summative assessments and focused on supporting teaching and learning and expanding the system

01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:01.580
to also include interim assessments and formative assessment resources that we never had before.

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:07.580
And they're intended to be used by educators in a manner that best meets the needs of their students.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:14.380
So California's previous assessment system, Prior to CAFS, was the standardized testing and

01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:23.100
reporting program, or STAR as many of you might remember, that came to an end in 2014. And in 2015,

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:28.460
California officially transitioned to computer-based testing with the first operational

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:33.900
administration of the Smarter Balanced summative assessments for English Language, Arts, and

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:40.060
Mathematics. And these assessments were our first use of computer-adapted testing in statewide

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:47.900
assessments, meaning that students receive items customized to match their level of knowledge,

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:54.060
resulting in more precise measures of student performance. And in addition, these assessments

01:07:54.060 --> 01:08:00.780
were the state's first use of innovative assessment types such as technology-enhanced items like drag

01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:08.300
and drop and graphing, selected response, constructed response, including performance tasks as well.

01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:16.940
And then in 2017-18, the state's previous English Language development assessment program, which was

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:24.220
called the California English Language Development Test, or SALT, was replaced by the LPAC. And that

01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:31.500
began with a paper-pencil assessment and transitioned to online as well. So while the CDE offers a

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:39.740
variety of CASP and LPAC-related professional learning opportunities each year, in 2019-20,

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:47.660
the CDE hosted the inaugural California Assessment Conference, and this change provided an opportunity

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:54.540
for local educational agency staff to access through one event key elements of assessment-related

01:08:54.540 --> 01:09:01.420
trainings offered by the CDE and hear directly from our colleagues or their colleagues throughout

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:06.380
the state about how they are implementing parts of the state assessment system locally.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:13.740
And this mix of professional learning opportunities and sharing of local best practices was well

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:21.660
received and became an annual event hosted by the CDE through its contract with the

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:33.420
Sacramento County Office of Education. In terms of developing our assessments, to get to that first

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:40.860
operational administration, offering a quick little timeline for the CASP and the LPAC. Again,

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:48.780
as each set of standards were adopted, the CDE worked with our contractor ETS to develop and

01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:54.620
administer assessments that are aligned to these standards. And from the time that a set of standards

01:09:54.620 --> 01:10:00.140
is adopted, it can take several years until the assessments can be administered operationally.

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:06.940
So by operationally, I mean the point at which the results from the assessment can be

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:13.820
usable for the purpose of making determinations based on a score. And prior to the operational

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:19.820
administration, a host of activities must occur from the development of a high-level test design

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.620
and blueprint to item development, pilot testing, and field testing.

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:32.860
The first CASP assessments that were administered operationally were the Smarter Balanced summative

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:40.460
assessments. And in that same year, Smarter Balanced also launched the first set of interim

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:47.660
assessments operationally, and then the Digital Library of Formative Assessment tools. And although

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:52.780
being a member of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium, California had access to the English

01:10:53.740 --> 01:11:01.180
Language Arts and Mathematics assessments, we needed to design and develop and administer

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.540
the science test, the alternate assessments for English Math and Science, as well as the English

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:12.700
Language Proficiency assessments. And many California teachers participated, and their

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:19.180
contributions were instrumental in the development of all of our statewide assessments. In each of

01:11:19.180 --> 01:11:26.780
these years, in 2015-16, was the first operational administration of our alternate assessments for

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:34.380
English Language Arts and Mathematics. And then in 2017-18, we had the through the 21st with

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:42.140
initial and summative ALPAC assessments. They began with paper format and transitioned to

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:48.540
online. And then in 2018-19 was the first time we had the California science test and the

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:56.540
Spanish assessment operationally. And this past year, in 2021-22, was when we finally

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:01.260
had the California alternate assessment for science administered operationally.

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:12.860
And the first operational administration of our summative alternate ALPAC occurred in the 2021

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:18.460
year. And the first operational administration of the initial ALPAC is occurring this year in

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:28.780
2022-23. So the next assessment on the horizon to be expanded is the expanded California

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:36.140
assessment, Spanish assessment, which beginning in 2024-25, we will include the speaking and

01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:47.020
full right. And with that, we continue to study in terms of innovations in progress. We continue

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:55.260
to study and consider innovations to California's assessment system. And in 2021-22, Smarter Balance

01:12:55.260 --> 01:13:01.500
conducted a demonstration of concept study to begin examining how performance tasks can support

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:07.260
learning throughout the year. Shortly, Tony Albre will be providing more information on that study.

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:13.740
But the SBE, CDE, and ETS are laying the foundation by connecting with

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:23.340
state assessment practitioners and national experts for the development of the CAST

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:29.740
innovations concept study, paper, excuse me, that will be brought before the board later this year.

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:36.540
And ETS and CDE are also working toward implementing the CAST and ALPAC interim assessments

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:44.220
for the 23-24 school year. And implementing these assessments involve making many changes

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:49.660
to multiple systems, including but not limited to our test delivery system, teacher hand scoring

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:57.660
system, data entry interface, and the California educator reporting system. So with that, highlighting

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:04.460
these innovations that are still in progress, I will turn this presentation over to Tony Albre,

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:10.300
who will provide an overview of the recent demonstration of concept study and a group

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:16.380
of resources that resulted from the study called our integrated deeper learning resources.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:21.820
And Tony will be presenting virtually. So Tony, I'm going to hand it over to you.

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:30.220
Thank you, Mao. And thank you, Cheryl, for the overview. It's, I think, really powerful

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:36.940
to have this conversation about innovation with the understanding that California is taking these

01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:46.620
steps from a position of strength with a strong description of priorities and investment over

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:54.540
a decade now to transition to a more powerful system that doesn't just do an end of year check

01:14:54.540 --> 01:15:00.540
but supports instruction throughout the year. And toward that end, then, consistent with what Mao

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:08.780
described, we collaborated with President, State Board President Linda Darling-Hammond

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:14.620
and CDE and some other partners to really investigate what can we do more,

01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:18.540
how can we help more. So next slide, please.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:30.220
In addition to the California Department and the State Board, we also included some

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:36.860
partnerships, collaboration with the new teacher center, who helped us address the professional

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:42.780
learning needs of educators as we consider both changes to the system, to a system and

01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:48.620
maintenance to the system. So there's managing change, and then there's supporting implementation,

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:56.300
which really depends a lot on the information that we're able to provide to teachers

01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:04.220
in advance and during the implementation of a system. And then WestEd supported our work

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:10.140
by helping develop some of the teacher resources that were included in the demonstration.

01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:11.420
Next slide.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:21.660
As Mao described, the primary purpose of this was to investigate how can the Smarter Balanced

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:27.420
summative assessment better support teaching and learning. And it was a grounding, a founding

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:33.500
principle for the assessment system. And we have tools for teachers and the interim assessments

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:42.700
that more clearly support teachers as they improve their practice and support the individual

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:48.300
needs of their students. But the summative assessment, that relationship isn't particularly

01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:57.020
clear during the year. It's more clear how it can be used after the year is over, but we wanted to

01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:05.980
push a little bit further. And in part, the state board's request is we think about how we reduce

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:13.420
the footprint of the end of the year test while we spread that out a little bit

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:22.700
so that districts might have more flexibility in providing data that supports a summative assessment

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:31.900
and consistent data statewide, but also doesn't concentrate it so much in a single point in time

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:40.460
to make it all work a little bit easier. Next slide. So as a reminder or an introduction,

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:48.620
the Smarter Balanced theory of action that we developed well over a decade ago now, which is

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:55.900
hard to believe, it's pretty basic. And that is the premise that the way we support

01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:02.380
improvements in teaching and learning is that we help teachers by providing resources that they need.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:08.700
And the Smarter Balanced assessment was then defined with three major components, the summative

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:14.860
assessment, the interim assessment, and then tools for teachers, which supports that formative

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:22.620
assessment process that's so essential to changing practice in real time to meet students' real time

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:29.660
needs. So the premise is that if you have the standards and you provide the resources that are

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:37.580
helpful to improve teaching, then students will learn more and they will leave high school with

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:43.820
choices rather than having the choices defined for them based on their opportunities or their

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:52.780
background. And so really making available the full array of opportunities that students should have

01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:58.380
based on providing them high quality learning opportunities. Next slide.

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:09.980
So more specifically in terms of this particular slice of what is a much larger issue about

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:15.900
improving teaching and learning, we asked three basic questions. The first that I

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:23.740
touched on is can we reduce the footprint of the summative assessment at the end of the year

01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:30.380
by giving more flexibility to administer the performance task earlier in the year

01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:37.500
based on the needs of the district or school, the needs of the teacher, the needs of the student,

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:48.060
how that might fit better. The next question was can we provide resources that help teachers better

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:55.420
understand and better address the higher order thinking skills that the performance test measure

01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:02.140
with the goal not that students do better on the test, but the goal that teaching is improved and

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:09.100
that students have access to these skills and can apply their skills during the year so that they

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:17.340
are more successful in retaining them and as a consequence of that demonstrating it. But really

01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:25.580
the focus was on that teaching and learning process. And then the essential question is

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:33.180
what supports do educators need to be able to engage in these tasks to improve their

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:39.340
teaching of higher order thinking skills and adjust to their students' needs.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:50.860
Next. So as a level setting opportunity, I wanted to describe the Smarter Balanced

01:20:50.860 --> 01:21:00.060
Performance Task and really, oh, Linda, a huge thank you for her continuing support

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:08.940
in helping to make available this unique system. It was a hard fought change 10 years ago and still

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:15.660
is unique in that the Smarter Balanced Performance Tasks are designed to provide students with that

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:21.900
opportunity to demonstrate their higher order thinking skills and it was designed in a way to

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:33.580
be consistent with how K-12 educators and higher ed faculty provide instruction and the activities

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:39.980
and the demonstration of skills that they expect in authentic settings so that when we're measuring

01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.860
these knowledge and skills, it's measuring in a fashion that's consistent with the type of

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:54.700
application that students need to do in their post-secondary objectives. And so we asked students

01:21:54.700 --> 01:22:03.180
to explore and analyze really real world type settings. So in the context of English language

01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:10.300
arts, they're asked to review three informational articles that are complex and then they're asked

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:17.980
to write an analytical essay that utilizes evidence from those informational articles to

01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:26.140
either provide a rhetorical or argumentative essay as the case or narrative as appropriate

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:32.540
for the grade. And for mathematics, the performance task is unique in that it asks students to address

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:41.580
a real world problem from multiple angles and then not only to analyze the problem,

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:49.740
but also communicate their approach to solving the problem and that's essential in business

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:55.900
environments as well as to be successful in more collaborative environments in post-secondary

01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:04.060
education and it's a very difficult concept to otherwise measure on a summative assessment.

01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:06.700
Next slide.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:16.940
So as we're thinking about using this performance test as a starting point

01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:24.380
for measuring these higher order thinking skills, sometimes called 21st century skills,

01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:33.820
sometimes called practices or operations, lots of different labels, but those are critical

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:40.380
thinking skills that we value that can be generalized across a variety of topics.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:51.740
We implemented this study in fall of 2021 and it was difficult to gain participation

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:55.980
in part because schools and districts were still recovering from the pandemic.

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:07.820
And similarly, educator availability was limited during the school day in part because substitute

01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:13.900
teachers weren't available, students' needs were much greater, teachers were absent in and of

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:19.500
themselves due to illness or other taking care of family members. So with that context, it was

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:26.700
just want to help folks understand that this was possibly the most difficult time

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:33.580
ever to initiate a study, especially a study that addressed higher order thinking skills

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:40.780
and not just the minimum level of content that might otherwise be addressed in a different study.

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:46.300
We are very appreciative that two California school districts participated

01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:56.380
with 63 educators. So in the grand scheme of things, it's a wonderful contribution for these

01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:03.900
educators and I can't express my gratitude enough. We want to be limited though in the degree to

01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:11.500
which we apply the results of this and generalize the results of this study, but it is certainly a

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:18.620
good start to the conversation. As part of their engagement, educators attended four

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:25.260
virtual professional development sessions and those really were intended to help teachers

01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:31.020
understand the content standards associated with the critical thinking skills that we value

01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:42.860
so highly and to support their identification and their adoption and incorporation of instructional

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:49.980
strategies and formative assessment strategies that helps students better learn those higher

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:57.100
order thinking skills. As part of this, they implemented a resource that we now call the

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:02.300
integrated deeper learning resource that Mao mentioned. It's currently available in tools

01:26:02.300 --> 01:26:10.700
for teachers as a support for all educators and that was designed to directly walk teachers through

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:17.660
some lessons and activities that help address the higher order thinking skills

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:23.180
consistent with the teacher's instructional scope and sequence.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:31.180
And then they administered interim assessment performance tasks and most critically the

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:38.060
professional learning session addressed the scoring of that task. So applying the smart balance

01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:46.860
rubric to the student work, level setting on that performance expectation that we collectively agree

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:55.500
on and then identifying those features of the text that are exemplars of both the requisite

01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.420
level of performance that we're seeking but also the indications that the student isn't

01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:07.100
performing well so that teachers have a better understanding of the features of the student's

01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:16.460
response that either are indicative of proficiency or indicative of not yet proficient.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:23.260
And then as part of the process the educators participated in surveys and focus groups

01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:31.260
wherein they described their experience in the demonstration of concept. Next slide.

01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:41.820
So a little bit more about the performance task design. It's as we think about how teachers

01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:47.420
utilize this resource. It was based on an evidence-centered design approach where we asked

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:52.780
what are the types of evidence that students should provide in support of a claim that they

01:27:52.780 --> 01:28:00.860
are proficient. It was based on a foundation of universal design and accessibility and we can

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:05.020
talk a little bit more about all the features that are available to students both as

01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:11.260
universal tools but also as designated supports or accommodations. And as I described it was

01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:18.060
vetted well throughout the design process with the educators who would rely on these data

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:25.260
to help ensure that they represent the content that they are otherwise asking students to learn.

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:31.660
We did engage in cognitive labs with the students to make sure that the evidence that we think we

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:36.460
were collecting or we thought we were collecting is in fact representative of what the student's

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:43.820
cognitive process and the application of their knowledge described. And then we piloted the task

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:56.060
to refine them based on the data. Next slide. So one of the founding principles of Smarter Balanced

01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:03.420
is that we incorporate the educators, the people that need to use the system into the design

01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:09.740
and the development of the system. And so educators help write and review these performance

01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:17.900
tasks both in terms of content alignment as well as trying to minimize any bias and be attentive

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:24.540
to sensitive topics that might prevent students from being able to engage in the test and

01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:32.620
demonstrate their knowledge and skills. For ELA we also engage with educators to select the passages

01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:41.340
that are the founding body of evidence for the students writing. And in math because ELA tests

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:48.780
tend to be pretty consistent in terms of their difficulty. But math we have to have a unique

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:56.220
rubric for each performance task. We engage in some small scale trials which I think Linda has

01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:01.820
referred to as smoke testing to make sure that they work out and have a good chance of successfully

01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:07.500
being field tested. The final step is field testing and then we go through the rigorous

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:13.820
psychometric evaluation to make sure that these tasks are as free of bias as possible and

01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:20.540
describe students' knowledge and skills in a consistent way across years. Next slide.

01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:29.900
So as a grounding as we think about what are critical thinking skills, I'm not going to go

01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:35.500
into detail about this, but I wanted to make sure that we're aware of some of the different

01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:42.860
tasks that are necessary to describe the full body of knowledge incorporated into California's

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:49.980
content standards, but to differentiate what are otherwise considered more foundational skills or

01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:57.180
lower level skills for lack of a better term as compared to these higher order thinking skills.

01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:08.060
And we can for ELA, we use a taxonomy described by Webb where level one is about recall,

01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:17.820
level two incorporates comprehension and synthesis within a text, level three gets more

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:23.100
at analytical and synthesis across multiple texts. So next slide.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:34.700
And then level four, which is very difficult to measure on a single point in time assessment

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:42.140
is about that more extended engagement in understanding content and applying

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:51.020
problem solving thinking skills and other related knowledge and skills into an artifact or some

01:31:51.020 --> 01:32:00.940
other demonstration of learning. So the performance task gets a little at level four. It's notable

01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:07.340
that Webb describes that extended time is necessary probably, but not sufficient to describe

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:13.900
an extended activity given that you could have extended incorporation of recall as an example,

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:21.180
but that wouldn't get at this notion of a long-term engagement in a complex application of skill.

01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:27.900
But it's principally a level three type activity. We can go to the next slide.

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:37.260
And so when we're talking about math, we're incorporating some of the cognitive processes

01:32:37.340 --> 01:32:44.220
that students engage in as they solve problems, as well as the difficulty of or the type of task

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:52.060
that they're using to demonstrate. And so we incorporated a combination of cognitive

01:32:52.780 --> 01:32:59.500
rigor matrix with depth of knowledge. And so similar to ELA, but slightly different is that

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:07.100
DOK is about following simple procedures, calculating operational use of formula.

01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:15.100
DOK2 is about selecting the appropriate procedure and tools amidst a variety of

01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:26.700
opportunities to solve a problem. And level three is designing an approach to solving a problem for

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:34.060
a specific research question, as well as using reasoning and planning and providing supporting

01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:41.180
evidence for the choices and the solution. And then level four is that more extended approach

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:52.540
to a larger holistic solution to a complex problem. Next slide. So as we think then about

01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:57.660
how do we prepare students, how do we help teachers actually prepare their students

01:33:57.660 --> 01:34:05.180
to learn these really important skills and not just focus on the lower level skills of recall

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:14.380
or operations, but fully address and embrace the application of their skills in terms of reasoning

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:21.420
and communication and organization and design. We provided a resource that we now call the

01:34:21.420 --> 01:34:31.980
integrated deep learning resources. Next slide. And originally we named it the performance task

01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:38.460
support activity, but I think we got some early feedback from this esteemed body that it looked

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:44.620
like we were trying to prepare students for success on the performance task. And that was

01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:53.820
not the case. And so to at least address that initial misunderstanding, we renamed it to better

01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:59.900
clarify that these are resources that are designed to support the instruction process,

01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:05.980
which we believe would help students perform better on an assessment, but that is not the

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:13.660
principal goal. And it incorporates as part of the approach, it incorporates an understanding

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:21.100
or description of the content standards, walks teachers through potential student learning goals

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:28.940
that the teacher will address, provides scaffolding for the teacher to help support students as they

01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:36.860
engage in an activity, as well as provide some description of plausible student responses

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:45.260
to specific activities that the educator can provide to elicit students' demonstrations of

01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:56.940
higher order thinking skills. Next slide. Embedded in the approach to the embedded deeper learning

01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:05.980
resources is the utilization of a cognitive framework called ways of knowing. And we grounded

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:14.460
our approach in research, and there's a paper that we published authored by Paulina Bernacchi

01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:21.260
that kind of consolidates all of the available information about how ways of knowing can be a

01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:29.660
powerful resource, a powerful approach to help instruction. And I'm by no means an expert on this,

01:36:30.380 --> 01:36:38.380
but briefly, using ways of knowing during instruction is a means of accessing these more

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:45.180
complicated concepts, but in a way that draws on students' backgrounds, knowledge and experience

01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:51.820
to help them make relevant these skills and applying them in a way that is engaging and

01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:59.020
meaningful for them so that they can truly learn the skills in a manner that's consistent with

01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:06.940
how they see the world. Which is, it's not about changing the standard, it's about changing the

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:15.180
context during instruction so that it's relevant and that students can utilize their assets

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:19.740
during instruction to be successful. Next slide.

01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:26.300
Similar grounding is the formative assessment process that we utilize. There are four components

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:34.940
to our process. We support teachers as they clarify what is going to be learned, how they elicit

01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:41.580
information from students about what they have learned and the degree to which they can

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:47.900
demonstrate their knowledge and skills, support teachers as they interpret their knowledge and

01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:53.820
support teachers as they interpret that evidence, and then the what next, how do they act on it.

01:37:56.300 --> 01:38:02.380
These elements or attributes of the formative assessment process are incorporated into

01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:09.500
the deeper learning resource, both to support the teacher in the application of that resource,

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:16.700
but also to model how they might apply a similar formative assessment process in other circumstances.

01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:27.180
Next slide. So the professional learning that educators participated in and a huge thank you

01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:33.900
and acknowledgement of the NTC's work, new teachers work, new teacher centers work on this product.

01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:44.620
Next slide. The goals were to deepen teachers understanding of the cognitive process and

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:54.460
cognitive demands that students need to engage in in order to provide evidence of their higher

01:38:54.460 --> 01:39:01.900
order thinking skills and also identify and adopt key instructional practices that they can utilize

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:08.540
to help students learn and be proficient and demonstrate those skills. Next slide.

01:39:09.020 --> 01:39:17.100
There were four sessions. These are the one started with the grounding in the standards,

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:24.380
then it was about helping students apply their knowledge in a related to those standards in a

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:31.020
context different than the performance task, but related to the types of evidence that students

01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:37.660
would be providing in a performance task, then engaging in that scoring process where teachers

01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:45.100
apply the rubric and look at student work and discuss the exemplars of proficiency so that they

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:51.100
can better apply that in their own instructional context and then how to utilize that data to

01:39:51.100 --> 01:40:00.540
support their instructional plan. Next slide. As part of the process, there were three steps.

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:11.260
They reviewed a performance task as an exemplar of the demonstrations of skill, the elicitations

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:18.860
that would be required. Teachers engaged in a reflection of what are the types of instruction

01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:23.740
that need to occur, what are the instructional events that need to occur so that students can

01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:30.860
actually master these skills, and then how can they apply that in their classroom practice

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.380
to better support their students. Next slide.

01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:46.140
Some considerations that teachers incorporated were looking at the tasks or the

01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:53.980
texts and asking do they request students to engage in tasks, texts that are similarly complex

01:40:53.980 --> 01:41:00.940
or as they consider the performance that they're hoping students will have, and then other types

01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:06.620
of questions that they ask students to answer, are they in fact evidence-based, are they text-based,

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:14.220
or are they drawing on information that isn't necessarily exclusively available from the text,

01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:21.580
and then do their instructional activities, do they get at those higher order thinking

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:28.940
skills around synthesis, analysis, and holistic approaches to problems. Next slide.

01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:42.380
Teachers were asked as an example to identify the specific skills that students would need in

01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:50.940
order to reach a proficient level on the rubric or on the overall on the task related to higher

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:58.620
order thinking skills, and then they engaged in an analysis of their scope and sequence to identify

01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:06.220
when they might administer this embedded deep learning resource that starts to get at activities

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:11.660
that directly relate to the higher order thinking skills, and when they might also administer a

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:19.500
summative assessment interim performance task to consistently and systematically understand

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.700
how well students have learned those skills. Next slide.

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:35.180
As an outcome then of the professional learning events we created in collaboration with new

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:41.020
teacher centers some deeper learning educator modules that are also now available in tools

01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:47.820
for teachers that address these professional learning events that I described earlier. Next slide.

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:57.420
So some results, and with the caveat that this is a very small sample, it was a unique time,

01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:02.700
hopefully a unique time in our history, we did get some really positive feedback, and that is

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:11.100
70 percent of the responses, and it's there were some repeated responses in there, but we can

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:17.020
for the purpose of this conversation we can say 70 percent of teachers felt that the instructional

01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:24.220
resources and performance tasks were useful to inform lesson planning, which is incredibly

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:30.300
powerful affirmation of the design of the performance tasks to support instructional

01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:38.220
planning, and then 77 percent felt confident that they could use the task the data from the task to

01:43:38.220 --> 01:43:44.780
actually inform instructional decision. So being able to use the tasks as a signal for instruction,

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:52.060
which was always a hope that we have, but now to get that validation that it is it is feasible,

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:59.340
the design works, that teachers can use these tasks as signals for the type of instructional

01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:04.540
activities that they need students to engage in to be successful, to acquire these knowledge and

01:44:04.540 --> 01:44:11.820
skills, and then that the data then can be useful to actually adjust and fine-tune their instruction

01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:15.260
are wonderful affirmations. Next slide.

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:28.060
Not surprising to us, but continuing affirmation that teachers most value those scoring events

01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:31.580
where they look at the rubric, they look at student work, they discuss

01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:40.220
which exemplars are indicative of proficiency and the demonstrations of student work that are

01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:47.820
indicative of gaps or needs needing for improvement. The other sessions were highly rated, but

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:54.860
by far scoring, the sessions regarding scoring were most valuable. Next slide.

01:44:58.220 --> 01:45:06.060
Some quotes about from the teachers that help give some more flavor, some context to their experience.

01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:14.220
The takeaway for the for some teachers was about how they were able to use this information to

01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:22.460
engage with students around the high order thinking skills and help fine-tune their conversations about

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.860
how students need to change their or what students need to do differently in order to

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.180
improve their performance and have teachers consider that as well

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:39.180
regarding the tasks that they're asking students to engage in and are they really supporting them

01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:43.660
sufficiently at the depth that students require. Next slide.

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:54.540
The rubric-based approach and as a part of a planning of instruction is incredibly powerful

01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:01.340
and an affirmation that at least one teacher is going to shift her focus

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:08.060
and better incorporating informational tasks into her instructions so that students can

01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:12.060
build up their repertoire in that area. Next slide.

01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:22.700
Some issues and there are many. This is about continuous improvement which we've been

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:29.020
engaged in over the past decade or so but the PTSAs are hard to administer in a single class

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:37.340
period. There's a lot a lot that's going into those and so we tried to make it as efficient

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:43.580
as possible and fit within a single class period and we weren't entirely successful so we'll

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:50.540
revisit what does that structure look like so that it can be more easily administered and support

01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:57.180
teachers better and the professional learning we heard there were some teachers that knew this

01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:03.900
material and felt like it was redundant with what they already know and other teachers who

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:09.180
are newer teachers really valued the information so really thinking about differentiation

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:16.860
of content based on the teacher's experience is going to be critical moving forward. Next slide.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:26.940
The notion that teachers are going to be able to incorporate these resources

01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:33.260
into their instruction requires some significant advanced planning both at the state level but also

01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:39.020
within the LEA and the classroom depending on the flexibility that teachers have regarding

01:47:39.020 --> 01:47:44.700
their instructional scope and sequence but to the extent that things drop down from the sky

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:53.820
after they already have their plan laid out is a recipe for failure and so thinking about how can

01:47:53.820 --> 01:48:02.540
these processes be established to allow multiple people at every level of the educational enterprise

01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:10.460
better understand the process and better plan in advance is critical to success. Next slide.

01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:18.060
Teachers expressed concern about although this demonstration utilizes interim performance tasks

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:27.420
the angst the the attention that we need to be brought into the process to better incorporate

01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:33.100
to do something similar with the summative performance task requires that additional level

01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:41.020
of planning to make sure that districts support the schools and that there's a consistent

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:48.300
understanding of the timing of the both instructional events and the assessment events. Next slide.

01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:58.700
So next steps we're going to continue to discuss possible models for adding flexibility into the

01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:04.940
summative assessment with a focus on these higher order thinking skills. We're going to vet different

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:10.940
models with technical experts and and of course incorporate educators because we need to make sure

01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:17.500
that the system works for them and works for their students and then we'll design another pilot

01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:25.100
that supports California's priorities and really provides a clear value proposition to districts

01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:31.260
regarding how this will help their teachers help their students so that we can encourage

01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:46.860
participation and and make make really valuable changes. So that is our slide. Thank you. At this

01:49:46.860 --> 01:49:52.380
point it'd be great. Thank you so much. Please put up the public comments slide. Thank you.

01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:02.380
So that we can receive any public comments. Members of the public who wish to provide comments

01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:07.100
should do so by calling the telephone number that will be on the slide when it goes up

01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:13.820
and dialing the access code provided on that slide. There we go. And while we're waiting I

01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:21.260
want to ask member Orozco-Gonzalez if she has any initial comments before me. We'll take any

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.660
clarifying questions go to public comment and then come back for board discussion.

01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:34.460
Member Orozco-Gonzalez. Yes. Well yeah I lots of information. I think I'm most interested in

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:40.460
to see how the new instructional professional resources to support integrated deeper learning

01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:45.580
will help support classroom teachers to elevate classroom learning. The two sets of resources for

01:50:45.660 --> 01:50:52.380
educators are now available and I'd like to see how those are incorporated in the classroom.

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.940
I think the integrated deeper learning resources the instructional resources support educators

01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:03.900
instruction in the full range of higher order thinking skills is going to be key. I think it's

01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:09.740
going to be all the supports that are in currently. I found that some of the feedback that was given

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:15.820
by teachers would be resonated also by me which is section sessions regarding scoring was found

01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:21.740
most beneficial. I know that when I participated in these sessions just looking at student samples

01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:28.540
and having that collaborative conversation with my colleagues has been key to seeing how we how we

01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:34.780
evaluate and we follow the rubric. So I think that that's going to continue to be a good benefit for

01:51:34.780 --> 01:51:40.860
teachers also the differentiation of professional learning that needs to be tailored to the

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:46.620
different teacher needs. I'm a proficient educator when it comes to assessments and I know when I sit

01:51:46.620 --> 01:51:52.300
in my grade level meetings and at the district level and sometimes even at the statewide when

01:51:52.300 --> 01:52:00.220
we have workshops that invite teachers throughout the state it's always key to have that differentiation

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:05.500
because there are multiple levels to where teachers are at and I think that that will also

01:52:05.500 --> 01:52:11.740
help elevate student learning and the more I can say for the next steps is yes incorporate as many

01:52:11.740 --> 01:52:17.020
educators at different levels to give feedback to participate in these professional learning

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:23.340
opportunities because the more that we dive in as educators and we're provided with those opportunities

01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:28.700
I think that the students will have a better opportunity to succeeding in these performance

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:34.460
tasks. I'm excited to see the deeper level educator modules I think that these professional

01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:40.460
learning resources will definitely provide the professional learning community an opportunity

01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:50.940
to dive in and have the opportunity to to present it to their local agencies to just down to nuclear

01:52:50.940 --> 01:52:56.780
to the classroom where you have those grade level meetings where teachers plan and collaborate it's

01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:03.340
that tailoring that time that they spend looking at these assessments that will really

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.980
meet the needs of our students so thank you for all the information going forward

01:53:07.980 --> 01:53:15.660
incorporate as many educators as you can. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll just note that

01:53:16.940 --> 01:53:21.740
Smarter Balanced has been on the forefront of trying to really move towards assessment

01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:30.460
of for and as learning in a variety of ways so a lot of those were detailed it's exciting to see

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:38.860
some potential next steps in doing that. Tony mentioned that I was a strong advocate for

01:53:38.860 --> 01:53:43.820
performance tasks as part of assessment when Smarter Balanced was founded I was once on the

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:53.100
technical advisory board for the assessment and the 10 or so states that are involved in Smarter

01:53:53.100 --> 01:54:00.380
Balanced have been those that have really wanted to lift up the higher order thinking skills and

01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:06.300
21st century skills that we all started talking about in the 1990s but are still trying to get to

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.420
in our curriculum instruction and assessment system so the idea for this

01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.740
demonstration of concept really began during the pandemic as we were trying to figure out

01:54:17.740 --> 01:54:24.060
how to make it possible for people to engage in assessment in under the challenging conditions

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:29.340
but there are now a number of states that are looking at ways across subject areas to

01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:37.660
make assessment much more part of the instructional process during the school year

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:41.980
not just at the end of the year so it will be interesting to see what is plausible

01:54:42.620 --> 01:54:47.820
and productive and supportive of the teaching and learning process as member

01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:55.020
Oresco Gonzalez says it's really to support educators and students in the learning process

01:54:55.020 --> 01:55:01.260
that we would undertake any of the potential moves that would evolve from

01:55:01.820 --> 01:55:08.940
this kind of exploration so thanks to Tony for leading it I want to let board members if you

01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:16.300
have clarifying questions about specifics get those on the table now hold the bigger discussion

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:22.700
until after we have public comment so with that are there any clarifying questions at this moment

01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:27.420
before we go to public comment yes member Lewis

01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:36.620
just one question you know in the report because of the range of readiness that the teachers

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:43.100
reported during that professional learning you know some found the information you know regarding

01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:50.060
the performance tasks that information kind of difficult and some felt like it was repetitive

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:57.900
is there any timeline yet for the next steps to be able to reach more educators and prepare

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:07.980
Tony do you have a response to that yes President Darling-Hammond and member Lewis thank you for

01:56:07.980 --> 01:56:15.020
the question so I think some additional context that's really critical to as a foundation is that

01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:19.820
California is unique in the volume of professional learning events that it

01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:28.460
provides on a on an annual basis and there's I think 12 different workshops and and 24 or

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:35.020
and 12 different settings across the state for each workshop so this demonstration concept is

01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:43.820
a small slice of what otherwise is a large body of professional learning that CDE provides

01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:51.180
we're not quite sure how to fine tune yet the professional learning because we don't yet know

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:58.860
what the focus will be for the next pilot but it's more than likely going to incorporate the

01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:08.700
scoring event as as a principal focus and then we'll consider what other knowledge and skills

01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:14.220
what other adult learning goals we need to address but certainly giving some opportunities

01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:21.580
for people to step in later into the session if they already have the grounding but to engage for

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:25.420
instance if they already know the rubric they don't need to learn about the rubric but then

01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:31.180
to engage in the scoring event where that collaborative review of student work and that

01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:38.060
that wonderful argument that can occur about those threshold demonstrations of performance

01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:43.260
they might be able to engage in that successfully and have that be facilitated by an expert

01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:50.780
but we'll continue to consider what can we provide in addition to what California already provides

01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:58.140
as we move forward thank you any other clarifying questions at this moment

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:03.820
all right let's go ahead to public comment and then we can come back and have a more complete

01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:08.940
discussion if anyone wants to call in for public comment please dial the number

01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:17.580
showed on the slide and punch in the access code comments are limited to one minute do we have any

01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:22.140
public comment yes we do it looks like we have a couple callers in the queue i will open the

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:27.580
phone line now terrific thank you good morning please state your name and affiliation for the

01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:29.660
record you have one minute your time starts now

01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:36.940
Peter Ahern California Association of Science Educators speaking on behalf of the Coalition

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:41.660
of Science Educators and Organizations we are grateful to CDE for their work on getting CAS

01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:46.380
to meet the federal requirements we are excited about the work on the CAS assessment innovations

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:50.540
and the interim assessments and look forward to following the progress and supporting the work

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:55.180
we understand from CDE's timeline that scientists plan to be on the dashboard in 2024

01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.900
we are disappointed by this timeline since 2023 is the year that we have two years of data

01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:03.660
and our understanding has been that science would be on the dashboard once two years of valid and

01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:08.140
reliable data were available we ask again that there be at least be a placeholder in this year's

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:12.860
dashboard to signal to districts that they need to invest in science education many districts have

01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:17.980
not yet invested in NGSS curriculum and professional learning and are not likely to do so until science

01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:22.460
is included on the main dashboard having a strong science education for all students is vital to

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:27.100
provide equitable access to STEM career pathways it is also critical that California has a science

01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:34.140
literate workforce and citizenry thank you thank you next caller please state your name and

01:59:34.140 --> 01:59:36.860
affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:44.220
hello my name is Melissa Martucci and I'm a high school science teacher in the central valley

01:59:44.220 --> 01:59:49.180
my district serves a high number of disadvantaged students we are very excited to see that the CAS

01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:54.700
results have a link on the California dashboard for 2022 indicating the importance and relevance

01:59:54.700 --> 02:00:00.140
of creating a scientifically literate community however with the high number of STEM jobs available

02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:04.140
and low number of Californians from underrepresented student groups prepared for

02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:08.860
these positions I feel it is of the utmost importance to place science on the dashboard

02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:12.940
in a way that highlights and supports the need to increase diversity in STEM fields

02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:17.580
to do this districts need to make science a priority districts rely heavily on indicators

02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:21.740
from the dashboard for guidance on setting priorities thus I urge the state board of

02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:27.500
education to include a performance level for the CAS the science test in 2023 so that all

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:31.820
districts and principals can make science a priority as they develop or refine their LCAP

02:00:31.820 --> 02:00:37.180
plans and treat core areas equally especially in the elementary grades rather than masking its

02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:42.540
presence thank you for your time and diligence in this matter thank you that concludes public

02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:50.300
comment for item number three all right and it reminds us that the evolution of CAS is also

02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:57.020
on the agenda that we heard about in this informational item now we can open up the

02:00:57.020 --> 02:01:05.820
floor for discussion and any comments that folks would like to make about the evolution of the

02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:11.340
system we will be looking by the way for an opportunity for a more in-depth conversation

02:01:11.340 --> 02:01:19.820
among the board members about where assessments should and could go in our state but this is a

02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:23.980
good introduction to some of what is being thought about in the department

02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:29.580
yes member Glover Woods

02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:39.740
thank you I had just a couple of questions and again just to reiterate I believe

02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:43.340
President Darling-Hammond what you said and what we've heard throughout the presentation

02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:49.260
regarding the importance and really the purpose of the assessment which is to guide instruction

02:01:49.260 --> 02:01:56.460
for students and I really do believe that the evolution that we are going to see with our

02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:03.660
assessments and assessment system will help to lead us closer to that goal I have two questions

02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:10.380
one is in regard to the peer review and the second is in regard to the performance task pilot

02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:18.300
that just took place so first for the peer review question I do realize that we received the I believe

02:02:18.300 --> 02:02:27.020
fully meets ranking for the SBAC ELA and math blueprints but that was for the full form and

02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:33.100
we are using the adjusted blueprint now can you give us some insight as to

02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:40.220
if there will be a peer review of the adjusted blueprints and if so what the timeline will be

02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:48.220
for us to know if those adjusted blueprints fully meet the peer review as the form full form does

02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:55.740
so that's question number one that sounds like it goes to mal so mal if you can help us with that

02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:09.900
is my mic on yes we can hear you okay yes although we are fully meet requirements for

02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:15.900
our Smarter Balanced summative assessments for English and math are for the full form blueprints

02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:22.540
so some the US Department of Ed did indicate that they are aware that we are using the adjusted

02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:28.220
blueprints and they asked for some additional evidence that will be required to support the

02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:36.780
adjusted blueprint forms and as as Smarter Balanced is working on the composite claim scores that we

02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:46.940
hope to provide sometime this year to as additional evidence that the US Department of Ed will be

02:03:46.940 --> 02:03:52.860
receiving to help us pass this additional step of requiring additional

02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:59.420
evidence to support our adjusted blueprints and Tony I may feel free to add anything to

02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:08.940
I think you covered most of it just add that the US Department I think is currently planning on

02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:17.100
reviewing evidence in June Smarter Balanced was able to was not able to evaluate the

02:04:17.100 --> 02:04:25.820
adjusted blueprint in spring of 21 because the participation was not consistent enough across

02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:35.740
all of our members but then and then in spring 22 where we had a full administration we just finally

02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:41.820
got all the data from our state so pretty long shadow between the administration and when

02:04:41.820 --> 02:04:47.980
states are able to clean the data associated with the demographics and it's part of their production

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:53.500
process for ayp and now we're going to engage in those technical analyses in support of

02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:59.980
a body of information available in june thank you tony and mal because I know that there is

02:05:00.620 --> 02:05:06.300
of course strong support for utilizing the adjusted blueprint and being able to get that

02:05:06.300 --> 02:05:11.580
feedback when it is appropriate to do so within all of the timelines you guys shared will be very

02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:18.140
helpful and my second is actually not even a question just a comment about the performance

02:05:18.140 --> 02:05:24.540
task pilot and first let me say how encouraging it is that that pilot continued even in the midst

02:05:24.540 --> 02:05:30.700
of everything that was going on during our response to the pandemic and I'm quite encouraged

02:05:30.700 --> 02:05:36.620
and excited that there will be an additional pilot that will give some more information

02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:43.500
under I would say a more normal setting that we have so that that information can be utilized

02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:48.780
and even compared to the information we received from the pilot that has just completed

02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:55.580
with again knowing the goal is to really take those performance tasks and allow for them to be

02:05:55.580 --> 02:06:01.660
a more integral part of instruction during the school year so again it meets that goal of helping

02:06:01.660 --> 02:06:07.260
to drive and support teaching and learning and not just seen as kind of this thing we do at the end

02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:13.980
of the year and then move forward from it so thank you again and thanks cheryl mount and tony for such

02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:21.820
a comprehensive presentation. Thank you. Member Yoshimoto-Towry and then Member Escobedo.

02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:31.100
Thank you Board President. I also wanted to thank the educators in the two districts knowing that

02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:36.540
there were less than ideal you know situations at the time and the department and the consortium

02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:40.220
because I think I was thinking about the four young people that were with us this morning

02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:47.580
and the fact that all of their dreams depend on higher order thinking skills and the fact that

02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:51.900
you know fixing climate change for example and the emphasis on fact speed accuracy

02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:57.500
are necessary but they're not really sufficient particularly in this digital age where we can

02:06:57.500 --> 02:07:03.260
get the recall on our smartphone so quickly so and I also just wanted to note that the what excited

02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:09.260
me about the study was that the calibration of the performance task invites the grown-ups right

02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:13.100
to do the same kind of collaboration and have the same kind of growth opportunities

02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:19.500
so we're seeing that at multiple levels in the system when we have that and then so thank you

02:07:19.500 --> 02:07:25.500
for that and then secondly I just had a comment about the the outreach opportunities there was

02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:31.900
a chart in one of the handouts that listed all of the outreach opportunities for the the work

02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:38.220
that's been done on CASP and I wanted to share just perhaps a suggestion that

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:43.900
in definitely in large districts but even in small and medium-sized districts

02:07:44.540 --> 02:07:49.820
the data coordinators are often not the same people that are the heads of instruction the

02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:57.340
heads that supervise schools and also the heads that that handle communication in the district

02:07:57.340 --> 02:08:06.300
and so when I was a member of the trail urban district group the TUDA for the NAEP we had the

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:12.860
opportunity to bring the the head of instruction the head of the you know data the head of

02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:19.100
communications together to learn this information that you shared today in a very brief setting

02:08:20.140 --> 02:08:24.300
and then they could go back and talk with their data data representatives and I thought that that

02:08:24.300 --> 02:08:29.740
was a really effective way of getting the information out and sort of heightening the

02:08:29.740 --> 02:08:34.620
opportunity in front of all of us to use some of these incredible tools that you're developing

02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:39.340
so I just wanted to recommend that as a as a next step thank you terrific thank you

02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:48.380
member Escobedo and then member Rodriguez I just appreciate the innovation of California and the

02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:56.540
efforts of elevating the okay in the system which is so drastically needed and I just wanted to ask

02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:05.580
one is there any outreach to teacher preparation programs especially when I reflect on slide 35

02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:13.260
where where teachers felt that preparing students for the performance task and planning for

02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:21.260
instruction really ranked you know lower than than the other responses that you know as we

02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:26.460
embark in this journey I hope that we're reaching out to teacher preparation programs

02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:34.220
to ensure our teachers are well prepared from the beginning and understanding you know how to plan

02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:42.620
and really instruct our students these type of higher level thinking skills because it's not

02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:48.700
just the activity right but it's the type of questions you pose as well and it takes

02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:54.540
collaboration to it takes really thoughtful planning so just just wondering if there are

02:09:54.540 --> 02:10:06.620
any plans for that um is that a question you think for Tony yes yes yes Tony that's coming to you

02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:16.140
thank you President Darling-Hammond and member Escobedo um it's uh it's a necessary step

02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:22.620
and uh part of our we do have a strong relationship with California State University

02:10:22.620 --> 02:10:31.260
through the EAP program and really CSU is a foundational guide for the consortium's assessment

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:36.780
design as a as a considered what does an assessment that measures college readiness

02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:46.620
in k-12 look like and so there's a lot of of connections via that

02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:56.780
incorporating the tools and the resources from the training into teacher prep programs has been

02:10:56.780 --> 02:11:04.860
a challenge i would have to say and there's there's logistical issues there's um uh human

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:09.340
issues and dealing with humans always it'd be easier to deal with humans if we didn't have to

02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:17.500
deal with humans i think um but um it's it just gets it gets complex so i think having a a state

02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:25.340
level goal um to be able to incorporate some of these resources into higher ed curricula

02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:32.700
might be a helpful positive force and if there's a way that we can convene uh interest in parties

02:11:32.700 --> 02:11:38.220
that can help contribute to that um that direction i think that would help move things forward

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:46.460
but it's hard for us to do it at the consortium level um uh otherwise okay thank you thank you

02:11:46.460 --> 02:11:55.900
tony uh member rodriguez yes thank you and thank you so much for uh what i see is a very uplifting

02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:03.900
presentation the scene assessment and deeper learning and higher order thinking

02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:11.740
all in the same presentation really fills me with uh with joy and hope uh when

02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:18.940
you know i was i was very fortunate in 2000 when i was uh went through my teacher preparation program

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:25.900
and was trained in performance assessments and performance tasks uh deeper learning

02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:33.420
and then suffered through teaching during no child left behind with you know a b or c

02:12:34.220 --> 02:12:41.340
if you have any doubts choose c and i was ready to leave the profession and um i was in tears

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:49.260
when i ran into president darling hammond at a national board um conference and i told her i

02:12:49.260 --> 02:12:55.020
said i i think i'm done and she said hang in there we have some great things coming down um you know

02:12:55.020 --> 02:13:03.500
in california some great changes are are on the way and this was i think in 2008 uh when i when i

02:13:03.660 --> 02:13:12.140
ran into her so i'm happy to see this this is the the horizon um and and performance tasks i think

02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:20.940
um you know when when i think about like the national board process uh at tpas right you know

02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:26.780
i think those are great preparations the because they're it's authentic assessment which is what

02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:33.820
uh you know when i when i assess my students with performance tasks um or you know project tasks

02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:40.060
they it's i get authentic information right you know like with the national board uh and in and in

02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:47.500
my teacher prep where we would analyze gaps in students thinking based on their the performance

02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:55.020
assessments and um so i think creating a practice of that uh and enforcing it with uh our own

02:13:55.500 --> 02:14:02.940
teacher performance assessments is a wonderful step in this direction uh right and and taking

02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:10.460
using assessment to guide deeper learning um now i did have a question and and i'm not sure if you

02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:17.420
have information uh but you know with the 70 of teachers felt that the resources and performance

02:14:17.420 --> 02:14:24.700
tasks were useful and i understand that's the circumstances um as member uh yoshimoto tari

02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:29.340
mentioned probably weren't the best for some of the teachers because of everything that was

02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:36.700
happening but did you have any information on the 30 percent who didn't what like maybe what they

02:14:36.700 --> 02:14:47.020
felt that they needed more of or less of tony thank you uh i don't know specifically

02:14:48.060 --> 02:14:55.100
helpful for us to analyze the data that way what we did here though is this uh the the gap between

02:14:57.100 --> 02:15:05.740
when the teachers better understood the activities and uh the the specific instructional scope and

02:15:05.740 --> 02:15:11.340
sequence that they had already planned so uh because we ended up starting this discussion

02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:18.700
in fall uh and the district had already established a systematic date as to when

02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:24.540
the interim assessment performance tasks were administered wasn't that coherence that we were

02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:30.060
seeking uh from a teacher's perspective regarding the measure uh that they were

02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:36.700
administering and the instruction that they were providing so uh i think uh had the professional

02:15:36.700 --> 02:15:43.180
learning event around using the instructional tasks as a signal for instruction had that happened

02:15:43.180 --> 02:15:50.140
in august or or during the professional learning events prior to the solidification of the

02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:56.380
instructional plan we probably would have gotten more positive uh responses and that's something

02:15:56.380 --> 02:16:01.660
that we're trying to consider as we think about what are the requisite uh elements that need to

02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:12.460
be in place for this theory of action to to come into being thank you so much and lastly um uh in

02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:18.860
regard to the higher order thinking and what uh member yoshimoto taori uh talked about you know

02:16:18.860 --> 02:16:23.020
the students that we saw this morning and how those skills are necessary they're necessary

02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:29.020
for problem solving and uh when i was in teacher prep school we used to call higher order thinking

02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:35.740
skills the huts and um that was our you know like wanted to make sure that we had that in there so

02:16:35.740 --> 02:16:42.140
you reminded me of that thank you all right thank you very much i think we've heard from

02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:46.860
everyone who wants to contribute at this point as i say this will be an ongoing conversation

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:53.580
with members of the board so uh this is just a taste of what is to come i want to thank tony

02:16:53.660 --> 02:17:00.940
and sheryl and mal for all of their presentations and this concludes this information item we can

02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:10.380
take a little break uh it's 10 47 so i will see you back at uh 1102 see you then

02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:21.420
please leave your uh stay in the meeting but just

02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:27.420
stay in the meeting

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:33.500

presented by pete callis of the cde pete please begin good morning president darlene hammon state

02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:28.700
board members and chief deputy nicely so i'm here to present on the california technical education

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:34.380
incentive grant program i'll talk about the program overview and funding the i'll do an

02:19:34.380 --> 02:19:40.380
allocation example and then we'll request for approval of the allocations so an overview the

02:19:40.380 --> 02:19:45.420
program was established as a state education economic and workforce development initiative

02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:51.340
to provide pupils in kindergarten through grade 12 with knowledge and skills necessary to transition

02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:57.420
to employment and post-secondary education the funding began in 2015 as a three-year program we

02:19:57.420 --> 02:20:05.740
received 900 million dollars over three years the first year was 2015-16 we had 450 million

02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:13.020
dollars with a one-to-one match requirement 2016-17 we had 300 million dollars with a 1.5

02:20:13.020 --> 02:20:20.620
to 1 match requirement in 2017-18 we had 150 million dollars with a two-to-one match requirement

02:20:20.620 --> 02:20:30.060
the funding was extended in 2018-19 through 2021 for 150 million dollars per year at a two-to-one

02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:37.100
match in 2021-22 the funding amount was increased to 300 million dollars

02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:46.460
of ongoing funds at a two-to-one match and this year 22-23 is 300 million dollars ongoing funding

02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:47.660
with a two-to-one match

02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:57.420
so an overview of this year for the funding CTIG is a formula-based competitive grant program

02:20:57.420 --> 02:21:04.940
70 percent of the funding is for base calculated over calculated on the LEA's average daily

02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:10.940
attendance 30 percent of the formula is based on eight positive considerations four positive

02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:16.700
considerations are at five percent three positive considerations are at two percent each and one

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:23.740
positive consideration is at four percent there are three funding groups associated with the ADA

02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:29.500
for each of the LEA's four percent of the funding or 12 million dollars is designated for applicants

02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:36.540
with ADA of less than or equal to 140 eight percent or 24 million dollars is designated for

02:21:36.540 --> 02:21:44.780
applicants with ADA of more than 140 but less than or equal to 550 88 percent of the funding

02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:50.780
or 264 million dollars is designated for applicants with ADA of more than 550

02:21:52.540 --> 02:22:00.300
2022-23 CTIG was determined by a formula calculation or the LEA match so in other words

02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:05.900
the allocation for each of the LEA's was the lower of the two if the LEA had the

02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:11.020
calculate their calculated allocation was lower than the match they received the allocation

02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:16.460
if their calculated allocation was above their match they would receive up to their match for

02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:25.980
their allocation and that's in statute so in 2022-23 the CTIG allocations for round 8a funds

02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:34.220
available total funds available were 300 million dollars we had 383 total applications of the 383

02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:43.820
375 applications were approved the total ask based on the LEA's match for all the applicants

02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:52.380
we had an ask of 398 million 290 thousand 530 dollars total funds that we allocated

02:22:52.380 --> 02:22:58.380
that we have allocated in the round 8a that we're asking for approval today is 265 million

02:22:58.380 --> 02:23:08.140
572 thousand 347 dollars which leaves us we we are just completing around 8b for this funding

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:14.860
with a total amount available of 34 million four hundred and twenty seven thousand dollars

02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:18.940
four hundred twenty seven thousand six hundred and fifty three dollars for round 8b

02:23:20.940 --> 02:23:30.140
so an example of how we do the calculation for an allocation for one LEA and this is for a fictitious

02:23:30.140 --> 02:23:37.420
school birch tree high school their ADA is 1000 their unduplicated pupil count is 900

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:44.060
of the positive considerations they are rural they have a high dropout rate a high unemployment

02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:54.380
rate and the high collaboration across with other entities so their base rate of for they fall into

02:23:54.380 --> 02:24:02.780
the upper level category of over 550 ADA so their base is calculated on nine ninety six dollars and

02:24:02.780 --> 02:24:09.020
sixty four cents per ADA times a thousand which leaves them with their ADA share is ninety six

02:24:09.020 --> 02:24:15.260
thousand six hundred and forty dollars they are considered rural their rural rate is forty one

02:24:15.260 --> 02:24:22.540
dollars and fifty four cents per ADA which gives them a rural share of forty one thousand five

02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:28.300
hundred and forty dollars their next positive consideration is their collaboration share which

02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:35.420
is six dollars and thirty six cents per ADA that gives them sixty three hundred and sixty dollars

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:41.740
for their collaboration share their unduplicated count is five dollars and eight cents per

02:24:41.740 --> 02:24:49.020
unduplicated remember that calculation is based on 900 not a thousand which gives their unduplicated

02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:54.620
share four thousand five hundred and seventy two dollars the dropout rate the high dropout rate

02:24:54.620 --> 02:25:00.860
calculation is eight dollars and seventy four cents per ADA which gives them eight thousand seven

02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:06.940
hundred and forty dollars and then their high unemployment rate share is based on seventeen dollars

02:25:06.940 --> 02:25:13.100
and twelve cents so they would receive seventeen thousand one hundred and twenty dollars their total

02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:20.060
calculation added up between the base and all their positive considerations is one hundred and seventy

02:25:20.060 --> 02:25:26.300
four thousand nine hundred and seventy two dollars their maximum match was the two to one match was

02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:31.580
two hundred and twenty thousand so you can see they were their allocation is based on their total

02:25:31.580 --> 02:25:36.060
calculation because it's the lower of the two numbers it's below their match

02:25:39.180 --> 02:25:43.340
so our recommendation CDE recommends approval of the career technical

02:25:43.340 --> 02:25:47.980
education incentive grant program 2022-23 allocations

02:25:47.980 --> 02:26:02.060
all right thank you so much Pete we're going to put up the public comment slide we'll open the phone

02:26:02.060 --> 02:26:07.500
line now for the public comment queue members of the public wishing to provide comment may do so by

02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:13.260
calling the telephone number and using the access code shown on this slide and while we're waiting

02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:18.140
I'd like to ask our is our liaisons member McQuillin and member Rodriguez

02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:22.780
if they have any initial comments member McQuillin

02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:32.700
yes thank you I want to say thank you to Peter for all the work on this and you know

02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:39.740
when I think of CTE in this whole area you know I think we're just realizing what this means to us

02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:45.420
in the state of California and our future workforce you know the skills based positions

02:26:45.420 --> 02:26:53.100
that CTE represents you know from IT and the computers we're on right now for them to function

02:26:53.100 --> 02:27:00.140
well and and when we have problems with them it's the CTE folks who are going to come and repair them

02:27:00.140 --> 02:27:06.620
or I think of all the the wave of EV vehicles electric vehicles and what are we going to do

02:27:06.620 --> 02:27:15.100
when they break down I mean this area is becoming so important to to us and our futures

02:27:15.100 --> 02:27:20.700
here in California I really appreciate the breakdown and you giving those examples of

02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:29.820
how the allocations are are are given out Pete you know in incorporating areas where there's

02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:38.140
high unemployment in the rural areas getting recognized and some points there there are really

02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:44.620
some differences in California when you think of the jobs CTE jobs in rural areas compared to our

02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:51.980
urban areas so I appreciate that area very much so it's a you presented a very high

02:27:52.220 --> 02:28:00.700
rate of those who did succeed I think it was only eight or nine who did not succeed in their

02:28:00.700 --> 02:28:05.580
applications I'm wondering if there were any themes there of any of those applications who

02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:12.860
did not get funded but anyway thank you for your work in the presentation we can come back to that

02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:20.780
question later on thank you so much member Rodriguez also thank you for the presentation

02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:29.660
and member McQuillin covered everything thank you terrific are there any clarifying questions

02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:32.300
that anyone has before we go to public comment

02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.980
I'm not seeing any of those so let's see if there's anybody in the public comment queue

02:28:41.100 --> 02:28:45.900
we don't have any callers in the queue so that concludes public comment for item number four

02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:49.580
all right so we can now open it up for board discussion

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:58.060
and member McQuillin if you want to ask that question of Mr. Callis please feel free and any

02:28:58.060 --> 02:29:03.980
other questions that folks have or comments if I could just if there were any themes of folks who

02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:11.180
did not get funded any themes of those applications that were not successful thank you yeah so I can

02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:16.540
address that a majority of them as you said there were eight or nine a majority of them just did

02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:22.060
not complete the application process and we reached out to them even after the the closing date

02:29:22.060 --> 02:29:26.460
to assist them if they wanted to you know if something happened tech like you were talking

02:29:26.460 --> 02:29:31.740
about earlier if technology fails we're there to assist them and we followed up with all of

02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:36.540
the applicants that did not complete their applications to assist them with completion

02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:39.900
some of them chose to not move forward with them

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:48.300
they have a chance in the eight b round to go after it again right if they were not successful

02:29:48.300 --> 02:29:50.140
correct thank you

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:57.660
terrific and you know thanks to the staff for doing that you know careful follow-up

02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:05.420
if there are no other questions or comments then we can take a motion

02:30:06.620 --> 02:30:14.860
so i have a motion to approve the allocations member Bacallan yes do I see your hand go up

02:30:14.860 --> 02:30:21.420

it and we can take a break for lunch an early lunch our next item is probably a good hour

02:31:23.740 --> 02:31:28.780
and a half long item so we don't I don't want to get us started on that and then you know we

02:31:28.780 --> 02:31:35.020
make it hangry before the end of it so those of you who work in high schools are familiar with

02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:39.020
the staged lunches you know just think of yourself as getting the first lunch

02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:50.220

item five is the update on the implementation of the integrated local state and federal

02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:58.460
accountability and continuous improvement system information item related to the

02:32:58.460 --> 02:33:02.940
implementation and use of school climate surveys to improve outcomes as required in the state

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:08.780
board of education adopted local indicator self-reflection tool for priority six which

02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:15.180
is school climate this is an information item no action is recommended at this time the item will

02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:21.660
be presented by William McGee of the department of education Rebecca Serna and Tom Hanson of West

02:33:21.660 --> 02:33:29.500
Ed and Nicole DeWitt and Sharon Rubocava of San Diego Unified William great to see you please begin

02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:35.900
great thank you and good afternoon to everyone hello president Darling-Hammond vice president

02:33:35.900 --> 02:33:42.780
Glover-Woods state board of education members superintendent chief deputy officer staff and

02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:46.700
community my name is William McGee i'm the division director of the student achievement

02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:57.180
and support division and we are happy to be here today to discuss our item so just a little bit of

02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:02.380
an overview for you all we appreciate the opportunity to explore priority six self-reflection

02:34:02.380 --> 02:34:09.100
tool and to be able to provide background on the tool and an overview the center for school climate

02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:15.740
at west ed will talk about their work and supporting california's lea's as well as introducing

02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:21.660
lea to talk about their practices and utilizing the tool this was great because it provided an

02:34:21.660 --> 02:34:27.660
opportunity at continued collaboration collaboration my team unity sacremoto and

02:34:27.660 --> 02:34:34.060
radine girola collaborated with the whole child division tom herman and hilva chan and this was

02:34:34.060 --> 02:34:39.500
an opportunity for me as a new member of cde to meet the west ed team and san diego unified

02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:43.980
school district so we're excited that the board is engaged in this conversation today

02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:51.660
so i'll read this slide just to ground us in the work of local indicator performance standards

02:34:52.380 --> 02:34:56.940
for the local indicators the state board of education adopted performance standards that

02:34:56.940 --> 02:35:03.340
require an lea to annually measure its progress and meeting the requirements of the specific

02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:11.260
lcff priority report the results as a part of a non-consent item at the same public meeting of

02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:17.660
local governing board body at which the l cap is adopted and report results to the public

02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:22.700
through the dashboard utilizing the state board of education adopted self-reflection tools for

02:35:22.700 --> 02:35:29.980
each local indicator an lea uses the state board of education adopted self-reflection tools to

02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:35.340
report its progress through the dashboard the collection and reflection on locally available

02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:41.820
relevant to progress regarding local priority areas is intended to support leas in completing

02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:46.940
the self-reflection tools reporting in the dashboard and in local planning and improvement

02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:57.580
efforts a little bit about the self-reflection tool history for priority six in 2016 the board

02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:04.940
adopted priority six reflection tool and then in response to improvement in the tool in 2017

02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:13.500
the cde convened the school conditions and climate work group which then looked at the tool made

02:36:13.500 --> 02:36:21.900
some recommendations and the state board then revised priority six and so basically the revisions

02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:26.860
with the recommendations are what we are using now for the priority six self-reflection tool

02:36:29.900 --> 02:36:35.260
in this presentation we'll touch on all of the various components of the l cap template and

02:36:35.260 --> 02:36:41.660
instructions lea's are to provide a narrative summary of the local administration and analysis

02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:48.140
of a local climate survey the survey is to be conducted at a minimum every other year

02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:54.460
a narrative of the survey should be input on the california school dashboard which then is made

02:36:54.460 --> 02:36:57.820
public

02:37:01.100 --> 02:37:07.260
lea's will have an opportunity to include differences among student groups from the survey

02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:14.060
for surveys that provide an overall score the lea can report the overall score for all students

02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:21.500
and student groups the lea may also include an analysis of a subset of specific items

02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:24.620
and additional data collection tools that are relevant

02:37:24.620 --> 02:37:30.220
to the school conditions and the climate to really help them narrow down what they're working with

02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:38.700
here is the priority six school climate self-reflection tool

02:37:39.900 --> 02:37:47.260
so again it's all about data meaning and use when reporting on the dashboard

02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:54.540
an lea shall include these components data reflect on the results and share what the lea learned

02:37:55.820 --> 02:38:02.140
meaning making sense of the data breaking it down by grade level student group what does the data

02:38:02.140 --> 02:38:11.020
show us strengths and or growth areas for the lea and finally use making the data actionable

02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:14.940
how will the lea utilize the data to make changes

02:38:14.940 --> 02:38:19.020
and or strengthen and continue practices that are effective

02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:30.220
while a comprehensive analysis was not done a review of three counties with the total of 258

02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:39.180
lea's show very few lea's disaggregated data via student groups at the local levels lea's

02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:44.940
disaggregate the data for their local review context for grade span topics and other items

02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:50.780
not many lea's disaggregated their data based on specific student groups

02:38:56.220 --> 02:39:00.540
cde in partnership with west ed hosted a webinar on december 5th

02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:07.180
digging deeper into school climate to inform your l cap there were over 380 participants who

02:39:07.180 --> 02:39:13.820
joined the webinar to learn various topics such as how lea's can explore school climate data to

02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:20.780
be included in l caps ways to dig deeper and understand school climate data anaheim union

02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:25.820
high school district's approach with engaging educational partners in this process was highlighted

02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:32.460
here

02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:41.740
what west ed does is they provide different levels of support to california's lea's

02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:50.300
they hosted a series of webinars through from january through june where over 200 lea's participated

02:39:50.700 --> 02:39:57.900
west ed also created a trauma-informed module used for california healthy kids survey

02:39:57.900 --> 02:40:00.940
which was completed and in use now

02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:09.100
the investment in the school climate at west ed led to the establishment of the california center

02:40:09.100 --> 02:40:15.180
for school climate in january 2022 which will provide school climate and data use trainings

02:40:15.340 --> 02:40:22.860
data use trainings and support lea's through june 30th 2024 and now i would like to turn

02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:28.540
it over to rebecca cerna and tom hansen from the california center for school climate

02:40:29.180 --> 02:40:35.900
so

02:40:39.660 --> 02:40:48.620
thank you well as i adjust this okay all right so again um my name is rebecca cerna from west ed

02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:54.220
and i'm here representing the california center for school climate and at the same time acknowledging

02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:59.100
the team that works alongside me in these efforts i'm here to provide a

02:40:59.100 --> 02:41:05.180
context about california center for school climate ccsc and about the importance of

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:13.500
school climate so at the center we have four goals that we work towards we work towards providing

02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:20.700
a relevant and responsive school climate coaching supports to lea's into districts

02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:27.980
and also to support lea's with data use in terms of best practices for using for collecting for

02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:35.020
using and for monitoring school climate data we also serve as a connector across the state for

02:41:35.020 --> 02:41:40.620
lea's and also help them in supporting the dissemination of best practices already in

02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:49.580
existence we also support lea's in in strengthening those relationships that they have with their

02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:50.940
educational partners

02:41:53.420 --> 02:41:58.220
so our center launched in january or the center launched in january of last year

02:41:58.780 --> 02:42:06.860
so it has and we have funding through june of 2024 and through the ccsc we provide various

02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:13.180
supports for example we provide school climate data use virtual sessions like what will mention

02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:19.980
that we provided that we collaborated on with anaheim union high school district we also have

02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:26.700
had a session where we collaborated with u county office of ed and in paradise unified school

02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:33.100
district where they highlighted how they used their school climate data in an effort to support

02:42:33.100 --> 02:42:37.660
post-disaster mobilization efforts after the fire that they experienced in their community

02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:45.100
we also offer peer learning exchanges where our smaller opportunities for districts to come

02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:51.100
together and have conversations around topics of discussion related to school climate topics that

02:42:51.100 --> 02:42:58.220
are selected based on inquiry surveys that they complete we have collaborated with agencies in

02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:03.740
hosting these peer learning exchanges such as children now and also school districts like davis

02:43:03.740 --> 02:43:09.180
joint unified school district we offer school climate professional learning supports

02:43:09.900 --> 02:43:16.940
we host an annual virtual event our next one is scheduled for february 28th and our registration

02:43:16.940 --> 02:43:25.740
for that event will be live on monday where we will be highlighting sessions on community schools

02:43:25.740 --> 02:43:32.860
on culturally responsive pedagogy on how relationships are critical for data use

02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:38.940
practices we have a panel for that session as well and we're culminating the event with our

02:43:38.940 --> 02:43:44.540
youth advisory team now and we also develop resources for the field such as briefs and

02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:51.340
toolkits we co-developed a toolkit with our youth advisory team a group of high school

02:43:51.340 --> 02:43:56.460
students from across california where they developed activities on how to cultivate caring

02:43:56.460 --> 02:44:02.380
relationships among staff and students and we have an audio gallery that hosts audio casts

02:44:02.380 --> 02:44:09.900
highlighting some best practices across the field for example we have one that we worked on with

02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:15.500
shasta county office of education where they highlighted how they co-design culturally

02:44:15.500 --> 02:44:22.220
responsive practices with their tribal partners or one that we collaborated with bahadur valley

02:44:22.220 --> 02:44:29.260
unified school district on a community-based approach of towards student and family well-being

02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:37.180
so those are some of the those things that we do in an effort to support a positive school climate

02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:43.020
so when we're talking about school climate we really frame it under the definition of the national

02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:48.860
center for school climate which it's it's focused on the conditions and the quality

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:54.700
of a school environment that affects the attitudes the behaviors the performance of students and

02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:59.900
staff so it's about the relationships the trusting relationships about the goals and the norms that

02:44:59.900 --> 02:45:04.860
exist about the teaching and learning that happens in the school and about those organizational

02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:12.700
structures and policies that are there and it's all framed under three domains so our three

02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:17.980
domains are also adapted from the national center for safe and supportive learning environments and

02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:24.460
from cde's previous work through california safe and supportive schools work so we frame it under

02:45:24.460 --> 02:45:31.100
belonging and connections under safety and wellness and environment and under the those three domains

02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:36.460
there are sub-domains that exist so for example under belonging and connections it's about the

02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:43.020
relationships and how that's foundational and that has a terrible effect on engaging educational

02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:48.300
partners and on school engagement and student agency and when we think about safety and wellness

02:45:48.300 --> 02:45:53.820
we're thinking about the safety of individuals not just physical safety but emotional and

02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:59.900
psychological safety and we have mental health and wellness supports under safety and wellness

02:45:59.900 --> 02:46:05.020
and then under environment we're really thinking about the physical environment behavioral supports

02:46:05.020 --> 02:46:10.540
instructional environment and diversity equity and inclusion so this framing has really helped

02:46:10.540 --> 02:46:16.460
support districts and really thinking about what are those indicators that they need to be exploring

02:46:16.460 --> 02:46:23.020
in order to continuously monitor school climate data so all of these efforts

02:46:23.980 --> 02:46:28.700
come together you know to support meaningful learning because we know that meaningful learning

02:46:28.700 --> 02:46:35.900
happens when all members of the school community feel safe emotionally mentally psychologically

02:46:35.900 --> 02:46:40.140
and physically valued cared for respected and are engaged

02:46:42.620 --> 02:46:48.140
and their research is growing around school climate and there's more and more research and

02:46:48.140 --> 02:46:52.940
it's all very similar when students report that they feel that they attend schools with a positive

02:46:52.940 --> 02:46:58.380
school climate they report higher levels of school motivation and connectedness there is higher

02:46:58.380 --> 02:47:04.380
levels of attendance there's they score higher on measures of academic performance they're more

02:47:04.940 --> 02:47:12.460
willing to report possible threats safety threats and they're more positive towards their learning

02:47:12.460 --> 02:47:18.380
and it's not just about the positive impacts on the students it's also about the positive impacts

02:47:18.380 --> 02:47:23.580
of the adults in the building so when educators perceive that they work in schools with a positive

02:47:23.580 --> 02:47:29.580
school climate it's they have higher levels of job satisfaction there's less burnout they leave

02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:35.660
the profession less they're more invested in the learning of the students and we think about that

02:47:35.660 --> 02:47:39.980
and then we go deeper so these are like research studies but then we go deeper and we take a look

02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:48.540
at the data in our in our state and fortunately in california we have access to great sources

02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:52.140
of school climate surveys one of them being the california healthy kids survey

02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:59.180
and and this really highlights where why this is also important for california when we have

02:47:59.180 --> 02:48:04.060
33 percent of our seventh graders reporting that they're experiencing chronic sadness and

02:48:04.060 --> 02:48:10.460
hopelessness when 28 percent of them are reporting social emotional distress or when we look at our

02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:16.780
high school students that they report 63 report feeling safe and very safe at school that means

02:48:16.780 --> 02:48:24.300
that 37 are not and when 59 report feeling that they're connected to school 40 are not being

02:48:24.300 --> 02:48:32.620
connected to school so that really highlights why this is critical and important to our students

02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:41.420
and to the adults who work in it at our schools so we have it's you know what's also important

02:48:41.420 --> 02:48:45.900
you know we have survey data but what's also important is to also ask the students so i

02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:52.460
mentioned that we have a youth advisory team as part of ccsc and we have six students that

02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:58.780
are representing the youth advisory team and three of them made this video to highlight

02:48:58.780 --> 02:49:01.660
what school climate means to them and why it's important so

02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:12.620
hello and welcome my name is amaya farias 11th grader at casso world will fundamental high school

02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:17.660
in san juan unified school district and my name is julian brickwood sclar 12th grader at

02:49:17.660 --> 02:49:21.740
serratoga high school in the los gatos serratoga joint union high school district

02:49:23.500 --> 02:49:28.380
my name is alexa southpaw 10th grader at eastlake high school in sweetwater union high school

02:49:28.380 --> 02:49:33.580
district we are all members of the california center for school climates youth advisory team

02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:39.740
a team of six members representing several regions across california in our work with ccsc we provide

02:49:39.740 --> 02:49:44.780
input as well as help to create resources for schools and districts this past spring we

02:49:44.780 --> 02:49:49.740
contributed activities to a resource called cultivating caring relationships toolkit which

02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:55.580
contains activities that help to strengthen staff student relationships we're here today to share

02:49:55.580 --> 02:50:01.180
our perspective about the importance of school climate a positive school climate is important

02:50:01.180 --> 02:50:06.060
to me because in order for youth to feel welcomed and comfortable students to feel accepted for

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:11.580
their different cultures backgrounds identities or ideas an environment that allows for people to

02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:16.540
be themselves without the worry of bullying harassment or judgment really creates a more

02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:22.540
secure and independent person ready for life after school these strong relationships and

02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:27.660
strong support groups that come with this positive climate can be really helpful for a young person's

02:50:27.660 --> 02:50:32.380
mental health and overall experience when it comes to social academic or personal lives

02:50:33.340 --> 02:50:38.220
a positive school climate to me is an environment that works to comfortably increase genuine

02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:43.260
relationships between peers on campus so that teachers and students are structured and supported

02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:50.060
when learning succeeding and struggling to add on to what amaya said a positive school climate to

02:50:50.060 --> 02:50:55.180
me is a place where students are encouraged to embrace their individuality it allows students

02:50:55.180 --> 02:51:00.300
to have peers and staff to go to if they ever need help by supporting students both academically

02:51:00.780 --> 02:51:06.700
and non-academically it sets students up for long-term success thank you all for being here

02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:12.140
today and working toward making schools a positive place for all to be as members of the youth

02:51:12.140 --> 02:51:18.620
advisory team we look forward to continuing to contribute to the work of this california center

02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:26.300
for school climate so when we look at data it's important to reach out you know to students and

02:51:26.300 --> 02:51:31.980
to continue to explore so now i'm going to pass it to tom hansen who's going to share

02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:34.700
oh i'm just trying to move it forward

02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:45.180
hello and on measuring school climate

02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:52.060
so

02:51:54.940 --> 02:52:01.820
great thank you rebecca thank you youth advisory team and thank you president darling hammond and

02:52:01.820 --> 02:52:08.380
the california state board of education what i plan to present here is a brief description

02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:14.060
of the state of the state regarding the measurement of school climate with standardized

02:52:14.060 --> 02:52:17.180
psychometrically validated student surveys

02:52:20.300 --> 02:52:20.700
first

02:52:26.300 --> 02:52:33.500
sorry there we go okay so first just to keep these top of mind let's just review the lcf

02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:42.620
priority six school climate indicators the state indicator is the suspension rate it's the percent

02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:49.820
of students who were suspended for one full day during the school year we the indicators both

02:52:49.820 --> 02:52:59.580
for current rates and then changes over time the local indicator is assessed by local climate

02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:07.500
surveys that capture valid measures of student perceptions of schools student safety and student

02:53:07.500 --> 02:53:13.260
perceptions of school connectedness the requirement is that the school climate

02:53:13.260 --> 02:53:19.340
survey be administered at least every other year and i believe that the annual that there's an

02:53:19.340 --> 02:53:21.020
annual reporting requirement

02:53:24.060 --> 02:53:30.380
okay so the most commonly used school climate surveys in california are the california healthy

02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:39.020
kids survey panorama educations student survey and the youth truth student survey

02:53:40.140 --> 02:53:44.300
the california healthy kids survey and youth truth those those surveys are administered

02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:53.660
anonymously to students panorama education survey is administered so that respondents can be tracked

02:53:53.660 --> 02:54:03.980
over time there are others as well there's the core sel school culture survey that's administered

02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:10.620
by approximately 22 districts in the state it includes a lot of the large districts in the

02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:18.860
state note that the core surveys administered by districts that administer the core oftentimes

02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:27.020
also administer the chks and other survey tools there's also the pbis school climate survey that's

02:54:27.020 --> 02:54:34.060
administered by about 15 districts in the state and plus there are many other sort of locally

02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:43.180
created surveys some with support from other organizations like handover research or gallup

02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:49.660
and some just independently with with by the school districts themselves

02:54:52.460 --> 02:55:02.620
okay so this table shows that between 2021 and 2122 those two academic years the california healthy

02:55:02.620 --> 02:55:12.620
kids survey was administered in 695 districts 299 of those districts administered the survey

02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:19.900
annually so that's 695 districts that represents about 66 67 percent of the

02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:26.540
school districts in the state panorama education was administered in 202 districts

02:55:28.540 --> 02:55:35.260
pretty much all of the panorama education surveys are administered annually and then

02:55:35.260 --> 02:55:42.540
the youth truth was administered in 80 80 districts so if you add those numbers up

02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:50.940
come to a figure around in the high 900s like 977 and that that sort of that number is

02:55:52.380 --> 02:55:58.860
that's a lot of the districts in the state and so the reason that number is so high is because

02:55:58.860 --> 02:56:03.420
many districts administer multiple surveys during that time

02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:10.700
the main story here is that the vast majority of districts

02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:13.900
administer

02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:24.060
oh okay the main story here again is the vast majority of districts in the state

02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:27.580
administer standardized school climate student surveys

02:56:32.220 --> 02:56:38.780
this next slide shows the areas where dimensions of school climate assessed by these surveys

02:56:40.540 --> 02:56:46.940
chks california healthy kids survey panorama and youth truth all measure perceptions of

02:56:46.940 --> 02:56:52.220
school connectedness and belonging and school safety although they measure it differently

02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:58.460
and all measure other important dimensions of school climate caring staff student relationships

02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:01.260
high expectations school engagement

02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:08.060
i just want to point out some of the strengths of the three main surveys

02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:15.340
first multi-item measures of school connectedness and safety are available

02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:22.700
available multi-item measures are better to cover broad topics like school connectedness

02:57:22.700 --> 02:57:31.820
and school belonging just like we would not want to rely on a single test item to measure

02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:38.060
reading comprehension we do not want to rely on a single questionnaire item to measure

02:57:38.700 --> 02:57:40.780
school belonging or some such concept

02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:48.540
multi-item measures also reduce measurement error and improve the precision of the measure

02:57:48.540 --> 02:57:52.380
making the measures more appropriate for for examining trends over time

02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:54.780
for continuous improvement purposes

02:57:58.540 --> 02:58:02.700
the other important strength is that the measures assessed on these standardized

02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:09.260
surveys have been psychometric psychometrically validated so statistical analysis have been

02:58:09.260 --> 02:58:14.540
conducted to provide evidence that the measures measure what they are intended to measure

02:58:14.540 --> 02:58:20.700
and that they are reliable they basically meet established standards of reliability and validity

02:58:25.580 --> 02:58:31.020
as you saw above the survey measures also measure other important aspects of school climate

02:58:31.020 --> 02:58:36.380
student voice meaningful participation perceptions of the physical environment

02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:44.300
peer relationships all three of the surveys assess mental and behavioral health indicators

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:52.140
the chks assesses chronic sadness emotional distress suicide contemplation and other more

02:58:52.140 --> 02:59:02.300
positive aspects of health like optimism the chks the chks with the chks cde has implemented

02:59:02.940 --> 02:59:10.700
a system that sort of identifies districts or schools that have abnormally high suicide

02:59:10.700 --> 02:59:20.860
contemplation scores so as data are processed west ed runs some codes identifies sort of schools

02:59:20.860 --> 02:59:28.700
and districts where the suicide ideation rates are are far above the average and then

02:59:30.700 --> 02:59:37.180
we notify cde about these rates and then cde notifies the school district

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:44.780
and or the school and provides informational resources to address these high rates of suicide

02:59:44.780 --> 02:59:55.180
ideation another strength is that all three surveys are customizable and all three have

02:59:55.180 --> 03:00:02.380
parallel school staff and family surveys so this allows for triangulation of the data for student

03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:12.220
staff and parent reports and finally all three platforms provide data via accessible dashboards

03:00:12.220 --> 03:00:19.260
to disaggregate data for student groups and monitor trends for all students and

03:00:19.260 --> 03:00:23.020
for student groups to aid continuous improvement efforts

03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:33.100
okay this this next slide we've already presented this so we'll present this earlier

03:00:33.740 --> 03:00:39.420
but it very loosely describes suggested reporting requirements for the local indicator

03:00:40.140 --> 03:00:45.660
as will described the self-reflection tool emphasizes reporting with respect to data

03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:56.060
meaning and use of results with respect to data and meaning lea's are asked to report and reflect

03:00:56.060 --> 03:01:04.540
on scores for all students and disaggregated results for student groups with respect to use

03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:12.140
use lea's are asked to report on actions that will be implemented in response to the results

03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:19.020
and the extent to which results reflect the impacts of previously implemented actions

03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:28.540
so this next set of slides just provides an example of how the chks data dashboard provides data

03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:33.740
in a form that can be helpful for continuous improvement efforts

03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:40.700
and can be used to disaggregate data for student groups one simply selects

03:01:42.060 --> 03:01:46.060
sort of the entity sort of the domain and a measure

03:01:48.860 --> 03:01:55.020
in this case perceived safety at school and pardon the resolution of this graphic but this this

03:01:55.020 --> 03:02:01.580
graphic shows the trends and perceived school safety over an eight-year period for a school

03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:12.780
district you can also identify disaggregate data by 15 characteristics this includes sort of a proxy

03:02:12.780 --> 03:02:22.140
for english language proficiency gender gender identity living situation which includes being

03:02:22.140 --> 03:02:27.420
the living situation includes being unhoused students reports of being unhoused or living

03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:33.340
with a foster family there's parental education and race ethnicity so let's see the results for

03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:42.300
race ethnicity here we see that white and asian students report substantially higher rate levels

03:02:42.300 --> 03:02:50.540
of safety at school than african-americans latinx and multi-ethnic students so one can also use

03:02:51.180 --> 03:02:56.460
these data to look at trends by student group to determine whether disparities are shrinking

03:02:56.460 --> 03:03:02.300
or growing across time and again all three surveys the main surveys they have this capacity

03:03:04.620 --> 03:03:07.100
okay i'm going to pass it back to rebecca

03:03:08.940 --> 03:03:12.220
and she's going to talk about data use in action

03:03:12.220 --> 03:03:26.220
okay thank you tom so what does this look like in the field the you know schools you know

03:03:27.020 --> 03:03:33.340
administer these surveys and they use them for their requirements and also

03:03:34.460 --> 03:03:39.900
these measures allow these indicators allow educators and their educational partners

03:03:40.700 --> 03:03:43.980
with the data needed to really think about what are their strengths what are the things that

03:03:43.980 --> 03:03:48.140
they should be celebrating that they're doing well and what are those opportunities for growth

03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:55.580
the needs that they have it also helps to support to identify what goals how to monitor progress

03:03:55.580 --> 03:04:01.980
so as we engage in the work of creating positive school climates that local context is so important

03:04:01.980 --> 03:04:06.460
it's so critical to be able to look by the different characteristics that are available

03:04:07.420 --> 03:04:14.300
by the by the survey that they might be using and to prioritize what they should be focusing on

03:04:15.100 --> 03:04:19.740
but you know effective use of the data is not just about having access to the data it's also

03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:26.620
about engaging your educational partners in these conversations and so that is part of like what we

03:04:26.620 --> 03:04:31.900
are doing through the california center for school climate we're working towards trying to build that

03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:37.740
capacity around data use specifically around school climate data use and will mentioned

03:04:37.740 --> 03:04:43.740
earlier how we host a series of webinars around school climate data use practices

03:04:44.700 --> 03:04:51.500
in last spring between like january and june we hosted a series of webinars attended by 600

03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:58.540
participants representing 201 leas in california another example of another one that we hosted was

03:04:58.540 --> 03:05:03.980
one on street data and centering student-centered approaches to school transformation and we

03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:08.860
collaborated with the street data authors and with the national center for social emotional

03:05:08.860 --> 03:05:16.700
learning and school safety to host that session we also have as part of ccsc a school climate

03:05:16.700 --> 03:05:23.660
data use community of practice where we're working with nine school districts in providing supports

03:05:23.660 --> 03:05:30.540
around data use and what we do is we facilitate a data use workshop where we work with their teams

03:05:30.540 --> 03:05:37.260
with all of their educational partners in doing a data discovery in data mapping and really goal

03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:43.180
setting so that it can inform their sipsa plan so that it can inform their lcat plans we also host

03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:48.140
virtual community practice sessions where we bring together the we're bringing together all of the

03:05:48.140 --> 03:05:54.140
participating leas and on topics that have been identified by these specific leas that are part

03:05:54.140 --> 03:05:59.420
of this community of practice and we provide individual coaching supports to these districts

03:05:59.420 --> 03:06:03.580
in order to offer them that differentiated support that they might need because some of

03:06:03.580 --> 03:06:09.660
these nine districts some are very rural and small and then we have a really a really large

03:06:09.660 --> 03:06:17.980
school district that's part of this group as well so one example of a district is center joint unified

03:06:17.980 --> 03:06:25.340
school district not too far from here we've facilitated their data use workshop and where

03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:31.340
they brought together school staff administrators both at the district level and at the school level

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:36.300
they had counselors they had parents they had fifth grade students and we engaged all

03:06:36.300 --> 03:06:42.060
of their seven schools and conversations around data and and they've also identified some areas

03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:46.780
of focus that they want to work on they're trying to work on desegregating their local school climate

03:06:46.780 --> 03:06:52.380
survey data in this case it's panorama survey that they're using and engaging their educational

03:06:52.380 --> 03:06:59.500
partners in data conversations including students family members and staff and and to disseminate

03:06:59.500 --> 03:07:04.060
what are some best practice approaches to disseminate their local school climate survey

03:07:04.060 --> 03:07:11.180
results and as part of this work we have some county offices of ed have also reached out to us

03:07:11.180 --> 03:07:18.220
in terms of trying to you know that they're also interested in having building that capacity

03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:24.380
around data use and in march we're going to be launching a peer network for county offices of ed

03:07:24.380 --> 03:07:36.700
as part of the center as well so now i am going to pass it to san diego unified there is many

03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:41.660
examples of other districts you know doing a lot of work in san diego unified has been well on

03:07:41.660 --> 03:07:47.820
their journey exploring their school climate data use and so we have with us today nicole dewitt

03:07:47.820 --> 03:07:53.020
executive director of student services at san diego unified and share and ruval cava a program

03:07:53.020 --> 03:07:57.900
manager of counseling and guidance at san diego unified so i'm going to pass it to nicole

03:07:57.900 --> 03:08:07.740
thank you so much for allowing us the opportunity to share the work that we're doing in san diego

03:08:07.740 --> 03:08:18.540
unified our district's use of school culture and climate data is really reflected prominently in

03:08:18.540 --> 03:08:25.020
goal one of our local control accountability plan goal one for our district focuses on cultivating

03:08:25.020 --> 03:08:30.860
inclusive anti-racist and restorative communities here you can see our cycle of continuous

03:08:30.860 --> 03:08:37.100
improvement for our l cap a process that starts with an annual board workshop in june of each year

03:08:37.100 --> 03:08:41.820
with progress monitoring and feedback gathered throughout the month of september through may

03:08:44.300 --> 03:08:50.460
specifically in goal one our actions we take as a district on this slide you can see those actions

03:08:50.460 --> 03:08:56.220
highlighted which include providing restorative schools and classroom communities implementation

03:08:56.220 --> 03:09:02.700
of site equity teams access to wellness services structures for responding to students mental health

03:09:02.700 --> 03:09:09.260
needs and elevating student voice in order to measure progress for those action items we

03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:16.300
utilize the cal school survey with an emphasis on the safety caring relationships high expectations

03:09:16.300 --> 03:09:22.220
and meaningful participation strength in addition to the cal schools data we also use a variety of

03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:27.660
internal metrics that include monthly data tracking for the number of counselor contacts

03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:33.340
mental health referrals and suicide risk assessments as well as real-time data dashboards

03:09:33.340 --> 03:09:38.940
that sync to our student information system and disaggregate data related to suspension rates

03:09:38.940 --> 03:09:45.820
expulsions and chronic absenteeism during our last progress monitoring cycle we highlighted

03:09:45.820 --> 03:09:50.780
the following from the california healthy kids survey for our educational partners to help us

03:09:50.780 --> 03:09:56.860
determine what action steps we may need to revise our ad on this slide you can see trends for our

03:09:56.860 --> 03:10:02.460
elementary schools over the past five years that show a need for growth in the areas of caring

03:10:02.460 --> 03:10:09.900
relationships and social emotional learning for our middle school students we see similar areas

03:10:09.980 --> 03:10:17.180
of need related to school connectedness and caring adult relationships we also paid close

03:10:17.180 --> 03:10:21.420
attention to the five-year trends related to students experiencing chronic sadness and

03:10:21.420 --> 03:10:27.100
hopelessness although the data shows a change rate of plus or minus four the overall number

03:10:27.100 --> 03:10:32.060
still highlights a significant amount of students approximately one-third reporting that they have

03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:38.460
experienced these feelings for high school we performed above the state average in the strands

03:10:38.460 --> 03:10:43.420
of school connectedness and caring adult relationships however we did see decreases

03:10:43.420 --> 03:10:50.300
in both areas since the beginning of the pandemic we also again focused on the percentage of students

03:10:50.300 --> 03:10:55.420
experiencing chronic sadness and hopelessness which had a net change of zero but was higher

03:10:55.420 --> 03:11:02.140
than our middle school rates examining our cal schools data along with the other metrics

03:11:02.140 --> 03:11:08.060
outlined led us to revise action steps during our last LCAP board workshop during that workshop we

03:11:08.060 --> 03:11:13.180
highlighted the need to provide a continuum of social emotional and mental health services

03:11:13.180 --> 03:11:19.980
that included ongoing counselor training mental health services and education lessons for our

03:11:19.980 --> 03:11:25.500
high schools the expansion of our social emotional learning programs at elementary and middle levels

03:11:25.500 --> 03:11:30.140
and community partners to assist in assessing the mental health and social emotional needs

03:11:30.140 --> 03:11:35.660
of our high schools in addition we also plan to implement proactive measures in an effort to

03:11:35.740 --> 03:11:40.060
increase school connectedness and caring relationships through the establishment of

03:11:40.060 --> 03:11:45.420
family services assistants assigned to each neighborhood who focus on decreasing chronic

03:11:45.420 --> 03:11:50.860
absenteeism by removing barriers to needed services i would now like to invite my colleague

03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:54.860
Sharon Rubikova our program manager for counseling and guidance to speak about the

03:11:54.860 --> 03:11:58.940
ways school sites have incorporated the cal schools data into site specific goals

03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:03.900
thank you nicole i could just share the fun stuff so what we're going to be sharing in the next few

03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:11.100
slides is an overview of how we're using the healthy kids data or actually the cal schools data

03:12:11.100 --> 03:12:16.540
within the school plans for student achievement overall but also i'm going to dive into how

03:12:16.540 --> 03:12:20.460
counselors being the program manager of counseling guidance kind of have to share the counseling

03:12:21.180 --> 03:12:26.860
how counselors really drive their students to be successful in their work and in their

03:12:26.940 --> 03:12:33.100
how counselors really drive their their programs so close to 80 percent of our schools are

03:12:33.100 --> 03:12:40.300
formulating goals from the data that is received from the cal schools data so that out of the

03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:48.380
80 percent we have 272 goals and beyond looking at it more we have 63 percent of the goals

03:12:48.380 --> 03:12:54.460
really are dealing with the parent and guardian data that we receive and the goals are more

03:12:54.460 --> 03:13:00.300
involving the involvement the parent involvement the input in decision making perception from

03:13:00.940 --> 03:13:06.220
our participation excuse me from all parent and guardian groups 37 percent of the goals

03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:12.380
are using the data from students and mainly the caring relationships meaningful participation

03:13:12.380 --> 03:13:18.220
and safety so what does that mean okay with the schools we're going to highlight at each level

03:13:18.220 --> 03:13:22.460
the first level that we are going to be highlighting is the elementary school level

03:13:22.460 --> 03:13:29.500
robin erickson is the school counselor and she started at speckles in 2019 and trying to formulate

03:13:29.500 --> 03:13:34.940
the comprehensive school counseling program at speckles she was reviewing the data and the data

03:13:34.940 --> 03:13:41.580
that she was reviewing was the chicks data that we have and she noticed that there is a there is a

03:13:41.580 --> 03:13:47.980
need for student connectedness and meaningful participation so from this what she's been able

03:13:47.980 --> 03:13:54.700
to do is to add programs that make kids want to get to school so for instance no place for

03:13:54.700 --> 03:14:00.940
hate they're in their third year of no place for hate the one that um and the kids just she's she's

03:14:00.940 --> 03:14:06.220
a model school for the no place for hate program through the anti-definition league the art

03:14:06.220 --> 03:14:12.700
enrichment through volunteers for all students what she was able to do is build a community

03:14:12.700 --> 03:14:19.340
relationship with a program and have volunteers art teachers come and teach all students so from

03:14:19.340 --> 03:14:26.140
these those are just two examples of many programs that she started she has seen growth as well as

03:14:26.140 --> 03:14:31.980
gains and students want to come to school so she this is something she reflects on yearly but um

03:14:31.980 --> 03:14:39.740
you know using the california school data she's been able to see progress or improvement louis

03:14:39.740 --> 03:14:45.180
middle school this is an example of what tom was speaking of earlier what dina weiss the head

03:14:45.180 --> 03:14:50.700
counselor there what she is able to do is she does staff meetings and she takes the information from

03:14:50.700 --> 03:14:57.500
the student data the staff data as well as the parent guardian data and then she just lays it

03:14:57.500 --> 03:15:03.740
out on the table and says how is everybody's perception and she does this yearly with staff

03:15:03.740 --> 03:15:09.340
and she doesn't just do the current data she references last year this year and she has been

03:15:09.340 --> 03:15:15.980
able to kind of build programs within at louis middle school with this data as well the two

03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:21.420
programs the two problems that she was seeing at louis middle school and and by problems they

03:15:21.420 --> 03:15:26.460
weren't huge problems but something that needed to be addressed was the caring relationships

03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:33.100
that middle school students found as well as safety so from this what she was able to do

03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:39.820
was restructure the placement of staff during lunch as well as during passing periods

03:15:40.380 --> 03:15:46.060
in order to have the staff be more visible and the students felt more safe they also felt that

03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:52.300
they had could say hi and it wasn't just within a classroom so with with just making that little

03:15:52.300 --> 03:15:58.620
pivot she was able to have improvement on her scores the classroom lessons is an ongoing thing

03:15:58.700 --> 03:16:05.340
that they're doing at louis and they work with another group within san diego unified to do

03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:11.740
bystander conversation and not just let slurs happen so this is something once again that

03:16:11.740 --> 03:16:18.620
is looked upon yearly and finding improvement okay the high school so high school crofford

03:16:18.620 --> 03:16:24.380
heimei chavez there what heimei did was was looking at the data and just by first glance

03:16:24.380 --> 03:16:28.540
you would not think that crofford would have a problem because the what the data with that

03:16:28.540 --> 03:16:34.300
he was referencing was the alcohol use drug use as well as baking and there weren't a lot of

03:16:34.300 --> 03:16:40.060
students that were participating in daily activity or even trying this but what he figured out was

03:16:40.940 --> 03:16:46.300
even though students weren't participating they didn't think it was harmful so and that was like

03:16:46.300 --> 03:16:52.780
red flag so what he was able to do is he was able to utilize an outside agency community agency to

03:16:52.780 --> 03:16:59.900
come in and to do education and workshops and and he was able to deliver this and has been able to

03:16:59.900 --> 03:17:08.220
deliver this in the freshman pe class as well as rot rotc so which is a scary thought that the kids

03:17:08.220 --> 03:17:13.980
may not participate but they don't see anything wrong if they were offered so once again heimei

03:17:13.980 --> 03:17:19.660
did an amazing job and continues to do such at crofford high school the last example that i'm

03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:24.620
going to deal with is morris high school morris high school we actually have an intervention

03:17:24.620 --> 03:17:30.700
counselor there and what an intervention counselor does not typically have a normal caseload but is

03:17:30.700 --> 03:17:37.260
able to really impact students on a deeper level hence interventions and so what what she was able

03:17:37.260 --> 03:17:43.020
to do at morris high school was take the chick's data but then formulate her own needs assessment

03:17:43.020 --> 03:17:47.900
and from the needs assessment she was able to get students the help that they need the two i think

03:17:47.900 --> 03:17:53.580
that are most prominent here is the food insecurity healthy kids data doesn't give the

03:17:53.580 --> 03:17:59.500
food insecurity but what she was able to do was to formulate the questions from the safety questions

03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:05.500
that she had on the chicks data and then pinpoint that there were kids actually that were going home

03:18:05.500 --> 03:18:12.780
with no food so she was able to align the community resources to those students and not only just do

03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:17.660
that one time thing she checks in with them to make sure that the food insecurity is not an issue

03:18:18.380 --> 03:18:23.580
another problem that she was seeing on her campus was that the students didn't have friends and

03:18:23.580 --> 03:18:27.900
these are students that wanted to have friends and so what she was able to do is peers or have

03:18:27.900 --> 03:18:33.740
students paired up with a peer mentoring program and from this they do check-ins the students feel

03:18:33.740 --> 03:18:40.620
like they have a voice and they are feeling more connected to the school site so and with that that

03:18:40.940 --> 03:18:43.740
unified story i would like to pass it back to will

03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:05.100
great thank you for that informative presentation i just want to say thank you to nicole and

03:19:05.100 --> 03:19:10.940
sharon as well as tom herman and tom hansen and hilva rebecca unity and ray dean for all their

03:19:10.940 --> 03:19:16.460
work with this and so now we will turn it over to public comment

03:19:24.780 --> 03:19:31.660
thank you so much to all of the presenters that was really informative

03:19:32.540 --> 03:19:37.660
while we're opening up the phone line for public comment those who would like to comment

03:19:38.460 --> 03:19:43.980
can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that

03:19:43.980 --> 03:19:49.980
is shown now and then i want to ask our liaison vice president glover woods if she has any initial

03:19:49.980 --> 03:19:58.140
comments before i add my own vice president glover woods yes and thank you to everyone who

03:19:58.140 --> 03:20:04.460
gave the presentation definitely appreciate the time that went into bringing forward the

03:20:04.460 --> 03:20:10.860
data as well as the real life experiences in san diego unified i think i'll frame my

03:20:11.420 --> 03:20:16.540
brief comments and i may have others once we come back for board discussion but i think i'll frame

03:20:16.540 --> 03:20:23.580
my comments with a statement that one of the students said on the video that we saw and one

03:20:23.580 --> 03:20:30.460
of the students said that school needs to be a positive place for all to be and i really

03:20:30.460 --> 03:20:37.900
feel that that statement says it all our school climate data really serves almost as a foundation

03:20:37.900 --> 03:20:45.100
for all of the other data because how students experience school very often shows up in many

03:20:45.100 --> 03:20:52.140
other aspects that we look at as far as data is concerned on the dashboard and beyond so as we

03:20:52.140 --> 03:20:59.100
think about it i just want to and as i said i'll probably come back with a more in-depth comment

03:20:59.100 --> 03:21:05.580
regarding this but i want to really kind of bring our thoughts and minds to the desegregation

03:21:06.300 --> 03:21:14.140
of the school climate data we know that it is a may do for our leas it's not something that they

03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:21.420
must do and as was shared at the beginning of the presentation the large majority of leas are not

03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:29.020
disaggregating their school climate data by student group and the concern in regards to

03:21:29.020 --> 03:21:35.580
that is as actions are planned and implemented those actions might miss the mark if that

03:21:35.580 --> 03:21:44.060
disaggregated student group information is not front and center to really show again the experiences

03:21:44.060 --> 03:21:50.780
of all we want the student voice and sometimes the most pervasive student voice we will get

03:21:50.860 --> 03:21:56.940
is from this survey data so um president darley ham and i think i'll kind of just kind of end

03:21:56.940 --> 03:22:02.220
my comment there um again i reserve the right to come back and say more i'm very passionate

03:22:02.220 --> 03:22:07.900
about this and very passionate about all voices being heard but as i said i think i will just

03:22:07.900 --> 03:22:12.620
put a period at the end of that right now until we come back for more conversation

03:22:13.180 --> 03:22:18.060
that sounds great um thank you for getting us going and i'll just add how important this is i

03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:24.060
want to second the remarks that vice president glover woods has made um you know clearly if

03:22:24.060 --> 03:22:30.140
school is in a place that people feel safe and uh carrying environment it's not a place you're

03:22:30.140 --> 03:22:36.540
going to want to be in as we're looking at chronic absenteeism rates that have uh gone up and the

03:22:36.540 --> 03:22:43.260
anxiety that students you know have experienced during this endemic that we're in now and for

03:22:43.260 --> 03:22:50.860
lots of other reasons it's very very important that we um really get the most out of the ability

03:22:50.860 --> 03:22:58.060
to use these kinds of data to make um changes in the ways that schools operate where that is

03:22:58.060 --> 03:23:05.900
important to do uh the um there was a national survey that is done periodically not too long

03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:11.660
ago that found that fewer than 30 of secondary school students in the country felt that they

03:23:11.660 --> 03:23:18.620
were in a caring and um supportive environment so there's a lot of work to do to to create those

03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:24.940
kinds of environments and we know from the science of learning and development that in fact uh social

03:23:24.940 --> 03:23:30.140
and emotional and academic development are like completely linked that we learn much more

03:23:30.140 --> 03:23:36.540
effectively when we feel a sense of trust and belonging when we're not being stigmatized when

03:23:36.620 --> 03:23:42.700
we're not experiencing trauma and to build a climate in which all of that is taking place

03:23:42.700 --> 03:23:48.620
it just takes a lot of explicit effort in schools to you know to create the kind of community and

03:23:48.620 --> 03:23:54.380
supports and these data can be very very helpful as Vice President Glover Woods said the

03:23:54.380 --> 03:24:01.820
disaggregation of the data is also incredibly informative and useful in that process so very

03:24:01.820 --> 03:24:07.820
helpful to be brought up to speed on where we are in the state around this and I look forward to

03:24:07.820 --> 03:24:14.540
to the public comment and the discussion and to see what else we want to be thinking about as we

03:24:15.740 --> 03:24:21.500
really help schools create the kind of environments that will bring students in keep them there and

03:24:21.500 --> 03:24:27.420
enable them to learn most optimally with that I think we want to open unless there are any

03:24:27.420 --> 03:24:33.340
clarifying questions let me just see is there any specific clarifying question that anyone has that

03:24:33.340 --> 03:24:38.540
they want to ask of the presenters if and after that we'll go to public comment and we'll come

03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:47.500
back to discussion so let's go to public comment at this point do we have any buddy queued up for

03:24:47.500 --> 03:24:52.380
public comment yes we do it looks like we have nine people in the queue I will open the phone line

03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:57.660
three terrific good afternoon please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

03:24:57.660 --> 03:25:06.300
minute your time starts now Hi my name is Amanda Dickey I'm the Executive Director of Government

03:25:06.300 --> 03:25:10.780
Relations for the Santa Clara County Office of Education and I really appreciate the great

03:25:10.780 --> 03:25:16.380
conversation today around the use of climate surveys and collecting this data on an ongoing

03:25:16.380 --> 03:25:23.900
basis particularly I want to mention how helpful having this data has been in implementing the

03:25:23.900 --> 03:25:28.540
student behavioral health incentive program which is part of the CYBHI or the Children's

03:25:28.540 --> 03:25:35.260
and Youth Behavioral Health Incentive Program you know that that data from our districts and the

03:25:35.260 --> 03:25:40.620
fact that they regularly participated and collecting data from students really actually helped us get

03:25:40.620 --> 03:25:45.180
so many steps ahead many other counties in implementing these types of programs and these

03:25:45.180 --> 03:25:49.980
investments because we have been looking at that data for a long time and it was really telling us

03:25:49.980 --> 03:25:54.700
you know how severe the mental health needs of students were and and really helped us identify

03:25:54.700 --> 03:25:59.580
the kinds of services and kinds of spaces that they needed and we we used that information both

03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:04.940
to complete the needs assessment that was required through SBHIP the Student Behavioral Health Incentive

03:26:04.940 --> 03:26:10.220
Program but also really to inform you know how we decided to allocate funds and prioritize

03:26:11.020 --> 03:26:17.020
funding so that we were you know our plan is to we have launched the Student Wellness Centers

03:26:17.020 --> 03:26:23.340
on 12 campuses opening another seven this year and we'll continue you know to to be looking at

03:26:23.340 --> 03:26:29.260
the student climate and information as we move forward thank you. Thank you. Next caller please

03:26:29.260 --> 03:26:32.460
state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now.

03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:40.140
Hi my name is Lily Rosenberger I'm a management analyst at the Kern County Office of Education

03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:45.180
I'd like to thank the board for highlighting the impact of school climate on student success

03:26:45.180 --> 03:26:50.140
as an LCAP reviewer I have firsthand knowledge on the efforts LEAs are making to analyze and use

03:26:50.140 --> 03:26:54.700
school climate data to drive their continuous improvement efforts we're seeing districts use

03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:59.580
this data to get to the root causes of other student outcome data such as suspensions academic

03:26:59.580 --> 03:27:04.460
achievement and attendance because of the challenge many districts not only in Kern County but across

03:27:04.460 --> 03:27:09.420
the state are facing in regards to chronic absenteeism LEAs are actually prioritizing school

03:27:09.420 --> 03:27:14.300
climate data to make improvements as a matter of fact this year we had over 30,000 students take

03:27:14.300 --> 03:27:19.580
an additional school connectedness survey to try to get at the story behind chronic absenteeism data

03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:23.980
some of the actions we're seeing districts take based on this data is providing professional

03:27:23.980 --> 03:27:30.300
learning on trauma-informed practices and cultural proficiency and prioritizing funding for NTSS PBIS

03:27:30.300 --> 03:27:35.020
and social emotional learning this need has been so great in our county that our office has created

03:27:35.020 --> 03:27:40.380
a new department focused on equity and inclusion to support our district's improvement efforts

03:27:40.380 --> 03:27:44.940
thank you so much for your attention this afternoon thank you next caller please state

county office of education I'm going to be calling on behalf of my organization and the 40 school

03:28:00.540 --> 03:28:04.940
districts we serve I want to offer our appreciation of and support for the state

03:28:04.940 --> 03:28:10.460
focus on school climate data locally we've come to rely on the youth truth survey as a powerful

03:28:10.460 --> 03:28:16.540
tool for our own continuous improvement within and across LEAs our local youth truth effort

03:28:16.540 --> 03:28:23.100
grew from two pilot high schools back in 2017 to more than 142 school sites across 30 school

03:28:23.100 --> 03:28:29.500
districts this year we've heard from 60,000 Sonoma county students staff and family members and that

03:28:29.500 --> 03:28:35.580
information has been strategically used to inform and even integrated into LCAPs across

03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:40.380
state priority areas in an effort to improve the academic and life outcomes of our students and

03:28:40.380 --> 03:28:45.740
their families the youth truth survey allows us to monitor for whom those efforts are working and

03:28:45.740 --> 03:28:51.340
for whom they're not we're actually able to disaggregate reports across more than 13 demographic

03:28:51.340 --> 03:28:56.060
subgroups that reveal insights related to our students with disabilities multilingual learners

03:28:56.140 --> 03:29:01.500
students of color among others so super excited and appreciative that we're able to spotlight

03:29:01.500 --> 03:29:07.180
our local school climate effort that's become an integral part about how we think about doing

03:29:07.180 --> 03:29:12.620
school in Sonoma county thank you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for

03:29:12.620 --> 03:29:20.860
the record you have one minute your time starts now good afternoon my name is Sally Fox and I

represent the California Association for Bilingual Education CAVE school climate is important in

03:29:27.100 --> 03:29:32.780
providing the necessary socio-cultural environment for success for our 1.1 million English learners

03:29:33.420 --> 03:29:39.180
item five implementation and use of school climate surveys for priority six is an opportunity for

03:29:39.180 --> 03:29:45.900
improvement if we require LEAs to report survey results by student groups and overall score for

03:29:45.900 --> 03:29:52.380
all on another note having a set of four to five key questions that are standard for all LEAs

03:29:52.380 --> 03:29:58.380
would help compare data statewide please help LEAs do better by requiring them to analyze

03:29:58.380 --> 03:30:04.460
surveys and make appropriate changes for the better thank you thank you next caller please

03:30:04.460 --> 03:30:07.740

hello Chair Darling-Hammond and board members my name is Dr. Ashley Girvin and I'm an instructional

03:30:15.500 --> 03:30:20.140
coach at desert sands unified school district and a teach plus california policy fellow

03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:25.100
understanding school culture and climate from only an educator's perspective limits our ability

03:30:25.100 --> 03:30:30.140
to meet the needs of all students when schools look at culture and climate data teachers

03:30:30.140 --> 03:30:34.540
administrators counselors and other staff members are able to assess specific needs of students

03:30:34.540 --> 03:30:39.660
implement supports and monitor progress thank you for taking the time to explore this issue and work

03:30:39.660 --> 03:30:44.060
that the department and what they are doing to support the use of this data more effectively

03:30:44.060 --> 03:30:50.220
nevertheless we were disappointed to learn that the 150 000 designated in the 2021 education budget

03:30:50.220 --> 03:30:55.580
trailer bill to begin this process did not move this critical work forward we hope that the state

03:30:55.580 --> 03:31:01.020
board and department of education can put forward recommendations to get this process back on track

03:31:01.020 --> 03:31:05.340
my teach plus policy fellows and i would love to partner with you and continuing this important

03:31:05.340 --> 03:31:10.540

good afternoon jessica saco on behalf of children now my thanks to president darling hammon and vice

03:31:19.900 --> 03:31:23.420
president glover woods for their comments immediately preceding this public comment period

03:31:23.980 --> 03:31:28.140
school climate happens at the school level we know from a review of the california healthy

03:31:28.140 --> 03:31:33.500
kids survey data that there are often that there are often differences in how demographically

03:31:33.500 --> 03:31:37.660
similar students experience school compared to students and other demographically similar

03:31:38.540 --> 03:31:43.100
groups we also know that schools within a district may have dramatically different climates

03:31:43.100 --> 03:31:48.220
and positive school climates can improve student outcomes it is for these reasons i urge the board

03:31:48.220 --> 03:31:52.940
to consider how our state's accountability system can better support the reporting of school climate

03:31:52.940 --> 03:31:58.380
data at both the school and student group level additionally i urge the board to reflect on the

03:31:58.380 --> 03:32:03.100
lack of accountability and transparency that has been built into our local indicators model

03:32:03.100 --> 03:32:07.260
i refer you to both the equity coalition and alliance for student success letters regarding

03:32:07.260 --> 03:32:12.300
this item for our full comments thank you thank you next caller please state your name and

03:32:12.300 --> 03:32:15.020
affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

03:32:18.220 --> 03:32:22.460
good afternoon i'm sarah lillis executive director teach bus california we're pleased

03:32:22.460 --> 03:32:25.420
that the board is spending this afternoon considering the importance of school climate

03:32:25.420 --> 03:32:29.340
for student success and well-being no one could have made it clear how important positive and

03:32:29.340 --> 03:32:33.100
culturally affirming school climate is than the students you heard from today well we're happy

03:32:33.100 --> 03:32:37.180
that so many schools and aliases have taken advantage of the resources of the ccsd

03:32:37.180 --> 03:32:40.780
we believe there's more the state can do to ensure that we're prioritizing positive school

03:32:40.780 --> 03:32:45.100
climate for all students we'd hope that the other school climate related allocation from the budget

03:32:45.100 --> 03:32:49.340
trailer bowl would have moved us forward to enable statewide comparable data by identifying

03:32:49.340 --> 03:32:53.580
standardized items of school climate surveys and we understand that at the level of the allocation

03:32:53.580 --> 03:32:58.940
150 000 there were no applicants to do this work without that we do not have a view of the disparate

03:32:59.020 --> 03:33:03.740
experiences between schools lea and students moreover the state cannot ensure that schools

03:33:03.740 --> 03:33:07.420
and districts were struggling to provide the positive faith and culturally affirming school

03:33:07.420 --> 03:33:11.820
climate will help get the help they need while the support of west bed is providing represents

03:33:11.820 --> 03:33:15.980
progress we do not know if it's reaching the communities that need it most we recommend the

03:33:15.980 --> 03:33:20.380
state board direct cde staff to provide guidance for how to move forward collecting and reporting

03:33:20.380 --> 03:33:26.060
more consistent school climate survey data across the state thank you thank you next caller please

03:33:26.060 --> 03:33:29.340
state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:39.580
good afternoon this is liz gian with public advocates also for the lcff equity coalition

03:33:40.540 --> 03:33:46.700
the good work presented today by west ed and san diego are commendable i was happy to hear that

03:33:46.700 --> 03:33:52.460
despite different surveys there are similar questions that provide valid and reliable data

03:33:52.460 --> 03:33:57.820
but are they comparable can we require lea to take some action about it the flexibet will

03:33:57.820 --> 03:34:03.500
be currently allowed to lea's on this indicator is a real disservice to students and their families

03:34:03.500 --> 03:34:09.020
and advocates as we try to improve students experiences the dashboard report is not an

03:34:09.020 --> 03:34:14.140
indication of school climate good poor or indifferent it is merely an indicator that

03:34:14.140 --> 03:34:20.060
the lea administered a survey at least every other year in at least one grade within a grade

03:34:20.060 --> 03:34:26.860
band and reported something about it we note that the dashboard report is simply a report that the

03:34:26.860 --> 03:34:35.660
la took these steps but not that they did anything about it vice president clover wood underscored

03:34:35.660 --> 03:34:41.260
that lea should be required to report survey results by student groups and overall score for

03:34:41.260 --> 03:34:47.500
all students lea should be required to include analyses of items on their surveys they are not

03:34:47.580 --> 03:34:54.780
required to do this i echo the comments by sarah lillas just before me that the state can do better

03:34:54.780 --> 03:35:01.180
and we need to move forward to collect and report more consistent school climate survey data thank

03:35:01.180 --> 03:35:05.900
you thank you next caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

03:35:05.900 --> 03:35:13.340
your time starts now good afternoon chair linda darling hammon state board of education members

03:35:13.340 --> 03:35:17.420
my name is caitlin young with the association of california school administrators actually

03:35:17.420 --> 03:35:21.500
understands and values the importance of school climate for student success and well-being our

03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:25.980
school and district leaders rely on data from local school climate surveys to drive improvement

03:35:25.980 --> 03:35:29.740
efforts to ensure our schools are positive environments that support and embrace all of

03:35:29.740 --> 03:35:34.300
our students staff and families whether a minimum requirement that applies to the school's climate

03:35:34.300 --> 03:35:39.340
survey la's rely on the flexibility provided so that they can determine what survey instrument

03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:43.580
and the frequency that is most appropriate and useful for their school communities this flexibility

03:35:43.580 --> 03:35:48.220
is important given the diversity of the students we serve so that the local surveys are responsive

03:35:48.220 --> 03:35:53.100
to our family's cultures languages experiences and other local factors acts also appreciates the

03:35:53.100 --> 03:35:57.900
work of cde and west ed to provide training for lea on interpreting local school climate survey

03:35:57.900 --> 03:36:02.700
data this will help our lea's to be more adept and effective in understanding student voices and

03:36:02.700 --> 03:36:07.420
translating that feedback into needed school improvement efforts thank you thank you next

03:36:07.420 --> 03:36:11.180
caller please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute your time starts now

03:36:14.220 --> 03:36:18.220
good afternoon president darlin hammond vice president glover woods and members of the board

03:36:18.220 --> 03:36:22.620
this is derek lennox with the california county superintendent on behalf of the 58 county

03:36:22.620 --> 03:36:28.140
superintendents of schools we agree a positive school climate is essential to student success

03:36:28.140 --> 03:36:33.820
and collecting these data serve as an important baseline for youth voice to guide the continuous

03:36:33.820 --> 03:36:39.580
improvement plans such as the l cap throughout the state we see lea's utilizing a wide variety

03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:44.140
of tools to evaluate and improve the unique school climates of the district school site and

03:36:44.140 --> 03:36:50.700
classroom levels our lea's use these data to identify and address areas needed to ensure every

03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:55.660
student feels safe and connected to their daily learning environment we've provided more specific

03:36:55.660 --> 03:37:00.380
examples in our letter to the board and would welcome opportunities to continue the discussion

03:37:00.380 --> 03:37:04.940
on the ways our lea's use school climate data to drive their equity work and continuous

03:37:04.940 --> 03:37:11.180
improvement plan thank you thank you that concludes public comment for item number five

03:37:12.620 --> 03:37:17.820
right thank you so much i really appreciate all of the comments from all of the callers

03:37:18.780 --> 03:37:25.660
really an important topic and i now want to open this up for board discussion

03:37:26.060 --> 03:37:32.540
uh and i know that vice president glover woods you are reserving a little bit of time for some

03:37:32.540 --> 03:37:37.580
more comments there but let's see if there are others who also want to get in the mix

03:37:37.580 --> 03:37:45.660
member mcclellan we'll start with you thank you and i really appreciate this topic also on school

03:37:45.660 --> 03:37:51.500
climate especially as we struggle to come out of the pandemic and i heard one of the presenters

03:37:51.500 --> 03:37:59.180
talking about the covid related impacts on some of the data i was curious about additional impacts

03:37:59.180 --> 03:38:05.980
on our current data but it's such an important topic when we hear about substance abuse and

03:38:05.980 --> 03:38:13.500
school violence and all the things that are related to this topic with school with student behavior

03:38:14.380 --> 03:38:19.020
um i'm i'm hoping and i'm sure it's there somewhere that we're connecting

03:38:19.740 --> 03:38:26.380
this effort with the community schools development you know as schools apply for and

03:38:28.460 --> 03:38:36.300
plan the community school efforts and then i'm sure it's there also somewhere about best practices

03:38:36.300 --> 03:38:45.020
as we go through the various lea's and individual schools that we see best practices are promising

03:38:45.020 --> 03:38:53.020
practices where it could be a hotline or other efforts where we're monitoring school the students

03:38:53.020 --> 03:39:00.540
and and and their wellness and that there's a place where those who aren't far far along in

03:39:00.540 --> 03:39:05.740
this process can go to and see those best practices to try to model after those so

03:39:06.460 --> 03:39:12.380
i'm hoping there's an effort there there probably is but thank you for this topic and and i really

03:39:12.380 --> 03:39:19.260
appreciate it thank you thank you so much and just a note that in the legislation for community

03:39:19.260 --> 03:39:26.700
schools it does explicitly call on those schools to work around social emotional learning and

03:39:26.780 --> 03:39:31.900
school climate and restorative practices so to your point we hope that that will actually be

03:39:31.900 --> 03:39:37.740
a very explicit part of the school development process um campatiel brunson

03:39:40.220 --> 03:39:45.660
uh i also just wanted to thank you all for the presentation it was both sobering but also just

03:39:45.660 --> 03:39:52.380
incredibly powerful i i wanted to ask if you could talk a little bit more about how data collection

03:39:52.380 --> 03:40:00.300
looks in the younger grades in the sort of tk kn1 before kids are necessarily quite ready for

03:40:00.300 --> 03:40:07.340
surveys and how parent engagement works for sort of doing the data collection side of the work

03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:11.580
and then also if there are any if you could describe some of the

03:40:13.260 --> 03:40:17.900
practices that are emerging in terms of social emotional learning in those younger years

03:40:18.700 --> 03:40:25.420
uh i guess this could go in part to our wested team but um i'll leave it to the folks at the

03:40:25.420 --> 03:40:28.620
podium to figure out who should start us off on that

03:40:35.820 --> 03:40:40.620
do we have someone who can tackle that question of early learning

03:40:41.260 --> 03:40:45.500
yes we do we're talking about that now for you all we were looking at the item as well

03:40:46.060 --> 03:40:52.700
item as well and so to answer the question we know that we are collecting the data in k5

03:40:52.700 --> 03:40:57.020
i can speak to my practice in the past where students were asked questions

03:40:57.660 --> 03:41:02.780
and the teachers were helping the younger children out but again it does depend on the district

03:41:02.780 --> 03:41:07.340
i can turn it over to tom to see if they have any information too about what they've seen from the

03:41:07.340 --> 03:41:14.700
lea's terrific thank you thank you i i don't i don't have a whole lot uh more to share except

03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:20.940
that there's um there are elementary versions of these of these surveys the chks is administered

03:41:20.940 --> 03:41:26.460
uh there's an elementary version of that survey um unfortunately i don't quite have like the

03:41:26.460 --> 03:41:34.700
numbers of participation it is less than uh the surveys surveys are administered less frequently

03:41:34.780 --> 03:41:40.140
in the elementary schools than in the secondary schools

03:41:41.580 --> 03:41:46.700
but you know i could provide that information at a later time if needed okay that'd be great yeah

03:41:46.700 --> 03:41:52.060
i've actually seen some of this in action maybe some of you have and we have a second grade

03:41:52.060 --> 03:41:57.980
teacher who might be able to chime in on this but sometimes the teachers are reading the questions

03:41:57.980 --> 03:42:03.020
and there are little icons for students to recognize the way in which they might answer

03:42:03.660 --> 03:42:10.860
um member lewis and then member alken uh member glover woods and uh member arusco gonzales if

03:42:10.860 --> 03:42:17.740
you'd like to chime in on how this happens for your second grade or so would be very useful also

03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:27.260
member lewis okay thank you uh president darling ham and thank you um to all of you who uh presented

03:42:27.260 --> 03:42:33.100
that report and it was really great hearing all that information from san diego unified and how

03:42:33.100 --> 03:42:38.860
you're using the data i think it's a great example uh of good use of the data and putting it

03:42:38.860 --> 03:42:45.340
into practice and making uh the school environment uh safe and welcoming and conducive for learning

03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:51.260
for for our students just a just a couple of things uh to point out and then a question

03:42:51.260 --> 03:42:56.860
um vice president glover woods has already brought up the the concern about the disaggregation

03:42:56.860 --> 03:43:04.300
of data but within the calls to and within some of the correspondence we had there was

03:43:04.300 --> 03:43:12.140
a concern about the development of standardized questions that could be used across districts

03:43:12.140 --> 03:43:17.180
across the state so that there's some type of i think it the goal is accountability and making

03:43:17.180 --> 03:43:24.540
sure that the that districts are using the surveys to move things in a positive direction

03:43:25.100 --> 03:43:34.220
for students and student outcomes and i just if i could get information about the the 150 000 that

03:43:34.220 --> 03:43:39.580
was designated it seemed like that there was a process to begin doing that if that's correct

03:43:39.580 --> 03:43:45.980
standardizing a few items to go on the survey because that would also take care of some of

03:43:45.980 --> 03:43:51.900
the concerns that some of the district leaders have about keeping flexibility within the survey

03:43:51.900 --> 03:43:58.060
so that they can make the survey you know contain questions that they feel they're important to

03:43:58.060 --> 03:44:02.780
their district but also giving some standardized questions for everyone to use to be able to

03:44:02.780 --> 03:44:11.500
disaggregate the data by student groups and and also by race ethnicity gender lgbtq all of those

03:44:11.500 --> 03:44:18.540
things to see how students are really faring on our camp campuses and get an honest view of what

03:44:19.100 --> 03:44:26.620
schools and districts need to do to to make them feel comfortable so is that work um what um

03:44:26.620 --> 03:44:32.780
someone mentioned that they couldn't find someone to initiate that project if that's so is there a

03:44:32.780 --> 03:44:40.940
plan b for that and um the plans for moving forward with that i know that's a lot but

03:44:41.580 --> 03:44:49.900
yeah hopefully okay let's answer that maybe about the the process for the developing the

03:44:49.900 --> 03:44:56.460
standardized questions that could be used maybe that question first and then i guess my other

03:44:56.460 --> 03:45:06.300
question is you know as a board do would we have the leverage what is our leverage to be able to

03:45:06.300 --> 03:45:11.420
make the requirements for disaggregating the data if that's a direction that we

03:45:11.980 --> 03:45:17.900
we choose to go to starting discussion about those questions and how to assist districts in in

03:45:18.860 --> 03:45:23.020
making more use of the data because it sounds like a lot of districts are they're they're trying to

03:45:23.020 --> 03:45:27.980
use the data to inform decisions but to make the process even better to make sure that

03:45:28.460 --> 03:45:36.860
um all districts are using the data effectively right and just on that second question this is a

03:45:36.860 --> 03:45:41.900
matter that is in the board's purview so we will be considering those questions as a board

03:45:43.260 --> 03:45:50.060
and okay to william he may want to say something about um your first question which was

03:45:51.420 --> 03:45:54.940
what happened when we did not find someone to respond to the

03:45:55.740 --> 03:46:02.780
uh the earlier rfp william did you want to tackle any of that right now yes absolutely thank you

03:46:02.780 --> 03:46:07.740
president darlingham and to you member louis i do have hilva chan here who's from the whole

03:46:07.740 --> 03:46:12.460
child division that was a question that we did discuss and so she can give us a brief

03:46:12.460 --> 03:46:18.860
update and information on that okay thank you good afternoon i just want to provide a quick

03:46:18.940 --> 03:46:26.060
update so the cde did issue a rfp back in october 2021 trying to find a contractor to provide

03:46:26.620 --> 03:46:32.220
the study trying to conduct a study on the sanitized school comments survey so we only

03:46:32.220 --> 03:46:37.740
received one application and the applicant later withdrew the application because they couldn't

03:46:37.740 --> 03:46:43.900
find a subcontractor to conduct some psychometric studies so we're unable to implement this and the

03:46:43.900 --> 03:46:53.180
money went back to the uh what we reverted back so let me just say that um there's still an interest

03:46:53.180 --> 03:47:00.300
in our uh board consideration of these questions about whether and how we might want to move ahead

03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:07.660
with you know a variety of elements here you know about periodicity the frequency of the survey the

03:47:07.660 --> 03:47:13.500
ways in which it might be analyzed and the extent to which there might be some standards questions

03:47:13.500 --> 03:47:19.020
so those are not off the table they are on our table and we will be you know thinking about these

03:47:19.020 --> 03:47:28.540
things over this month and coming months um member oaken thank you thank you um i i just want to first

03:47:28.540 --> 03:47:37.260
say um in in a way of saying thank you to our presenters that this is yet another um presentation

03:47:37.260 --> 03:47:45.180
at the state board where i'm just blown away by the expert support and work across the state

03:47:46.540 --> 03:47:52.620
and one of the things that's become really clear to me in and having the privilege to sit in this

03:47:52.620 --> 03:48:01.180
seat is um there's so much good work and we can learn so much from each other and so for example

03:48:01.820 --> 03:48:05.980
the california center for school climate i'm going to be on your website myself

03:48:06.780 --> 03:48:13.820
and looking into your resources and san diego unified thank you so much for those very specific

03:48:13.820 --> 03:48:23.020
examples of the way you use school climate data to make changes at both the the sort of micro level

03:48:23.580 --> 03:48:30.540
teachers in the hallways to the macro level staffing and systems of support and that really

03:48:30.540 --> 03:48:38.220
kind of gets to the the heart of my comment which is i think we all know this but one of the really

03:48:38.220 --> 03:48:47.900
important reasons that this school climate data matters is because it can help us make changes

03:48:47.900 --> 03:48:57.260
at both the the micro and the macro level and i think that some of the tension that we're hearing

03:48:57.260 --> 03:49:04.220
between wanting systemized questions or standard questions and wanting schools to be able to

03:49:05.420 --> 03:49:12.380
design questions or or surveys at the site level speaks to that because if you want to if you want

03:49:12.380 --> 03:49:18.460
to make change at the system level we need to be able to see some standardized results and if you

03:49:18.460 --> 03:49:24.460
want to be able to implement change at the very local level you need data that responds to the

03:49:24.460 --> 03:49:36.460
work you're doing and so i appreciate sort of both sets of priorities and i am excited i'm looking

03:49:36.460 --> 03:49:44.300
forward to the conversations where we as a board try and figure out how to balance both of those

03:49:44.300 --> 03:49:54.460
needs in this with this data because as vice president Glover would said i believe how students

03:49:54.460 --> 03:50:01.180
feel at school their sense of safety their sense of connection their sense of inclusion

03:50:03.100 --> 03:50:10.380
if they believe that people there think they matter and can be successful is the most important

03:50:10.380 --> 03:50:14.460
predeterminate for academic success they just go hand in hand and so

03:50:15.420 --> 03:50:20.300
i look forward to more of this conversation and i thank everybody for the good work they're doing

03:50:21.180 --> 03:50:27.740
terrific thank you i have member arusco gonzalez member yoshi mater tari and member glover woods

03:50:27.740 --> 03:50:36.220
cued up member arusco gonzalez thank you again for the presentation and as a second grade teacher

03:50:36.220 --> 03:50:43.420
you know i always think of you know when students attend school with a positive school climate they

03:50:43.420 --> 03:50:49.260
feel valued and they feel seen and it's that connectiveness as a second grade teacher i

03:50:49.260 --> 03:50:54.380
always cultivate classroom chemistry and community by fostering authentic relationships

03:50:55.500 --> 03:51:02.140
understanding how they where and how they come from and when that starts is usually in our morning

03:51:02.140 --> 03:51:08.060
meetings that's a great opportunity for learners to develop empathy as they learn to listen with

03:51:08.060 --> 03:51:15.340
understanding and consider how to best respond to their peers we also partner up and we engage in

03:51:15.340 --> 03:51:25.500
conversations to just discuss our everyday needs and how to navigate relationships sometimes we just

03:51:25.500 --> 03:51:31.900
shine a light on students we on students often teachers overlook certain students so

03:51:31.900 --> 03:51:39.900
i make it a point to have a few students written down on my lesson plans to say kind of a check

03:51:39.900 --> 03:51:46.140
in how they're doing we even develop some collaboration strategies and discussion points

03:51:46.140 --> 03:51:52.140
sentence frames and so forth just to have those critical conversations and give them an opportunity

03:51:52.140 --> 03:51:58.220
to have an engagement and i always say honor student experience reflect on it have time to

03:51:58.940 --> 03:52:06.620
structure inquiry and dialogue in the class as a school wide and as a district we we definitely

03:52:06.620 --> 03:52:12.860
do that we do sometimes our administration pops into our morning meetings even at the district

03:52:12.860 --> 03:52:20.300
level we will have superintendents and and so forth come in and celebrate community at our schools

03:52:20.780 --> 03:52:28.780
and and again it's children feeling connected to school and i recently read an article about how

03:52:28.780 --> 03:52:34.220
because i have a high schooler about how he can be more successful in school and it's the more

03:52:34.220 --> 03:52:40.940
he participates i think of those 40 developmental assets which one of them is to be to feel connected

03:52:40.940 --> 03:52:48.060
and to feel that they're an active participant at schools and he's in sports and in clubs and i feel

03:52:48.060 --> 03:52:54.940
that that's just the beginning of foundation to feel successful and to be seen and feel motivated

03:52:54.940 --> 03:53:02.140
to participate in a community so those are awesome ideas but i know as a second grade teacher it's

03:53:02.140 --> 03:53:08.780
about inclusivity being seen and heard you know i think that giving children opportunities to

03:53:09.820 --> 03:53:14.620
constantly throughout the day to have dialogue and with our peers and with our teachers

03:53:15.260 --> 03:53:20.620
and hopefully those kinds of opportunities show up in the ways that students both respond in the

03:53:20.620 --> 03:53:28.860
classroom and provide information on these kinds of surveys thank you so much back to oh can i do

03:53:28.860 --> 03:53:34.540
that just with that with assessments i just made a connection about that because what i really

03:53:34.540 --> 03:53:41.340
deeply love about performance tasks and when we're having those conversations around that is that

03:53:41.820 --> 03:53:48.220
is that with the opportunity that the students have to explain their thought process that's also

03:53:48.220 --> 03:53:56.940
part of their learning so it's all connected today so thank you. Member Yoshima Otori and then

03:53:56.940 --> 03:54:01.900
member Glover Woods and then we'll come back around to member Rodriguez. Thank you and thank

03:54:01.900 --> 03:54:06.860
you again for this presentation particularly i think what we know and what we're still learning

03:54:06.940 --> 03:54:13.100
about the neuroscience piece what everything i'm reading suggests that school climate indicators

03:54:13.100 --> 03:54:18.460
may in fact have more impact on the other dashboard indicators than we commonly express

03:54:18.460 --> 03:54:25.580
and commonly talk about and so that being said i imagine there's a way to move the process forward

03:54:27.420 --> 03:54:31.580
perhaps in a both and way right which both identify as a subset of standard items

03:54:32.460 --> 03:54:37.740
particularly because i think that uniquely positions indicator six to have across the

03:54:37.740 --> 03:54:42.940
district conversations and across district conversations and use it as an improvement tool

03:54:43.820 --> 03:54:51.900
not just within one LEA and and i think we can do that there's a way to do that in terms of

03:54:51.900 --> 03:54:57.500
change management that still honors stakeholder input maintains options for multiple measure data

03:54:57.500 --> 03:55:02.860
and also provides a solution that honors the LEA's options to address local needs

03:55:03.660 --> 03:55:08.700
so i'm confident that there's a way through that and i'm excited to learn more and be a part of

03:55:08.700 --> 03:55:13.180
that and lastly i just wanted to second what vice president Glover Woods mentioned about

03:55:13.180 --> 03:55:17.740
disaggregated data i think there's great importance in being able to drill down

03:55:18.620 --> 03:55:22.460
in the data because the action steps taken could be very different depending on what that data

03:55:22.460 --> 03:55:28.380
suggests yes thank you so much member Glover Woods then we'll have member Rodriguez and member

03:55:28.380 --> 03:55:36.220
Escobedo thank you and just to continue along with the conversation and the recognition that

03:55:36.220 --> 03:55:42.220
we know students different students experience school in different ways whether it be our intent

03:55:42.220 --> 03:55:50.380
or not that does happen and when i think about our african-american student group our lgbtq plus

03:55:50.380 --> 03:55:58.540
student community newcomers and those who are english learners especially english learners

03:55:58.540 --> 03:56:05.580
that are at the earlier levels of english language proficiency their experiences in school can look

03:56:05.580 --> 03:56:13.260
very different from the experiences of others and just as i reflect on the phenomenal students we

03:56:13.260 --> 03:56:20.860
had an opportunity to hear from today when we were had our earlier item item two and many of

03:56:20.860 --> 03:56:28.220
the students we have opportunity to hear from when we have we had the student community group it

03:56:28.220 --> 03:56:32.060
wasn't the student community group but the students that spoke with us when we were appointing our

03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:36.380
student board member and things of that sort we have students that are having some phenomenal

03:56:36.380 --> 03:56:41.820
experiences on our campuses and again the reality is we have some students who are not

03:56:42.380 --> 03:56:49.340
and one of the key ways for us to get to who those students are and how we can best support

03:56:49.340 --> 03:56:56.540
those students and students overall is through that disaggregation of data as a practitioner my

03:56:56.540 --> 03:57:03.740
thought was okay maybe the data is just way too difficult to disaggregate because i do realize

03:57:03.740 --> 03:57:09.580
at the lea level it's sounds all well and good to say okay you should do this but actually being

03:57:09.580 --> 03:57:15.100
able to do it can always meet with some challenges but i was encouraged by i believe it was tom that

03:57:15.100 --> 03:57:24.460
said the instruments that are being used by the majority of our leas already have that disaggregation

03:57:24.460 --> 03:57:32.700
capability built in so one of the things that i really am encouraging us and would like to see

03:57:32.780 --> 03:57:40.700
us engage in more conversation about in the future is how we can ensure that the school climate data

03:57:41.260 --> 03:57:49.980
is disaggregated by student group and shared and reported in that way one of the other reasons

03:57:49.980 --> 03:57:56.540
for that is how the community can also be partners in this work of creating positive

03:57:56.540 --> 03:58:02.060
experiences for students on campuses we have community groups we have our parents we have

03:58:02.060 --> 03:58:08.060
all types of people in groups and organizations that want to help so that students experience

03:58:08.060 --> 03:58:13.820
school well and are able to be successful having this data disaggregated in such a way that can

03:58:13.820 --> 03:58:20.860
help point to ways we can partner point to actions that can be implemented to make school experience

03:58:20.860 --> 03:58:26.300
a more positive one for our students is something that i think is very important for us to do and i

03:58:26.300 --> 03:58:31.500
do hope we'll be engaging in additional conversation in future meetings thank you

03:58:32.620 --> 03:58:39.580
thank you um member rodriguez and member escapado naomi did i just see your hands start to go up

03:58:40.220 --> 03:58:48.940
no okay just ruminating okay uh member rodriguez thank you president darling hamond and um thank

03:58:49.020 --> 03:58:57.900
you to our presenters the this has uh been a very rich conversation and uh school climate is

03:58:57.900 --> 03:59:07.100
definitely a uh an important factor in student success without a doubt um and i'm very proud of

03:59:07.100 --> 03:59:15.020
the steps that my school district has taken with regard to the surveys um you know we've uh they

03:59:15.100 --> 03:59:21.100
the data is shared with us at staff meetings so we're able to think about and place

03:59:21.820 --> 03:59:27.980
where our students are right how many students are have considered suicide have considered

03:59:29.100 --> 03:59:34.620
have gotten uh close right you know have gone beyond thinking about it and actually have attempted

03:59:34.620 --> 03:59:40.380
it and it really brings a reality to us of who we have in our classrooms right and the emotional

03:59:40.380 --> 03:59:48.860
issues that our students are facing um issues of identity ethnic identity gender identity um

03:59:48.860 --> 03:59:54.300
and it creates you know that empathy that um member arrozco was talking about right you know

03:59:54.300 --> 04:00:00.700
it brings it to us so that we can see what we're going to do with that information um as one of

04:00:00.700 --> 04:00:05.340
the members of the sel team at my school we definitely use this information when we're

04:00:05.340 --> 04:00:11.980
planning activities for our students um and we have a counselor for a day at our school

04:00:11.980 --> 04:00:18.620
so any child that needs to go speak to somebody um they the counselor is available to them and

04:00:18.620 --> 04:00:24.380
our counselors have been trained in crisis intervention so they have tools to find out

04:00:24.380 --> 04:00:30.460
at what level a student is facing crisis um and then they can refer to we also have a mental health

04:00:30.460 --> 04:00:37.980
specialist um that is available to students in crisis so all of this is because of these surveys

04:00:39.020 --> 04:00:46.860
and because of this information and i'd also like to echo the um the desire to see this this data

04:00:46.860 --> 04:00:52.620
disaggregated right and to be able to break it down into the student population that perhaps is

04:00:52.620 --> 04:01:01.180
facing more crises um and i'd also like to add another aspect of school climate which is

04:01:01.740 --> 04:01:08.300
um how that relates to teachers uh right you know as as teachers we're working with our students on

04:01:08.300 --> 04:01:15.660
a daily basis and school climate also affects us certain decisions that are made um that are

04:01:16.460 --> 04:01:22.780
that are leadership made structural decisions and um perhaps there's a way to incorporate

04:01:22.780 --> 04:01:27.260
our voice as well i noticed that you know in the two qr codes that were shared

04:01:28.220 --> 04:01:35.900
one of them the cal schools which is a cd website um it has a school staff survey

04:01:37.260 --> 04:01:43.900
but it's you know and maybe that's a good place to start um but there are other issues about you

04:01:43.900 --> 04:01:49.660
know how decisions are made what the culture of schools are because that uh works that goes to

04:01:50.300 --> 04:01:56.780
teacher satisfaction which goes to teacher burnout how long teachers stay in the classroom

04:01:56.780 --> 04:02:02.140
right all of these issues that we're dealing with at another level and i'd like to quote an article

04:02:02.140 --> 04:02:08.140
um by matthew craft and grace falcon of brown university why school climate matters for teachers

04:02:08.220 --> 04:02:15.580
and students um school climates consist of a constellation of organizational features

04:02:15.580 --> 04:02:21.100
that shape teachers and students experiences strong school climates are characterized by

04:02:21.100 --> 04:02:26.940
supportive leadership teacher collaboration high expectation for students and a collective

04:02:26.940 --> 04:02:31.740
commitment to support student learning teaching is a social career and the relationships that

04:02:31.740 --> 04:02:37.260
teachers have with those who support their work in the classroom administrators and colleagues

04:02:37.260 --> 04:02:42.860
heavily influence teacher satisfaction and success so it's just something that i'd like

04:02:42.860 --> 04:02:49.580
to put out there uh for the future to start thinking about adding um a teacher survey as

04:02:49.580 --> 04:02:59.500
well uh down the line thank you terrific um member escapado dr hammond hided said it so

04:02:59.500 --> 04:03:07.500
eloquently about the color you know what school climate is a whole interaction of not just students

04:03:07.500 --> 04:03:13.580
among each other but the adults and the students which i would also include parents and i'm not

04:03:13.580 --> 04:03:21.580
suggesting for this to be a state level uh luck but perhaps resources that can be provided to

04:03:21.580 --> 04:03:28.780
districts that they can include in their l cap to measure right climate that affects parents as well

04:03:28.780 --> 04:03:36.540
as our teachers and classified as well so i i think uh you know it's a very complex issue and

04:03:36.540 --> 04:03:44.380
the resources that we provide to our districts can help them understand what climate is all about

04:03:44.380 --> 04:03:48.220
so thank you trustee haydee for sharing that as well

04:03:51.260 --> 04:03:56.620
member porter thank you so the conversation i think especially between

04:03:57.580 --> 04:04:03.740
members about empathy and students kind of feeling connected to staff kind of sparked

04:04:04.380 --> 04:04:08.620
what i've seen very successfully implemented in the districts and schools that i've talked to

04:04:08.620 --> 04:04:14.620
and that's having student advisory groups that meet regularly whether it be with principals with

04:04:14.620 --> 04:04:20.220
superintendents on the school or district-wide level and i think this is a great way for students

04:04:20.220 --> 04:04:25.500
to directly engage with their principals with their classified staff and to really feel

04:04:25.500 --> 04:04:31.900
supported at school because it's one thing to kind of have these surveys once a year but it's

04:04:31.900 --> 04:04:38.140
another thing to kind of directly gauge um kind of how students are doing and to have an ongoing

04:04:38.140 --> 04:04:43.340
conversation so that's just something that i would encourage principals superintendents to consider is

04:04:43.340 --> 04:04:47.500
having student advisory groups to kind of continue that ongoing conversation about

04:04:47.500 --> 04:04:50.940
what school climate looks like as it's constantly changing throughout the year

04:04:51.900 --> 04:04:58.460
terrific yeah i think we're getting really down into the roots of the needs in the schools that

04:04:58.460 --> 04:05:04.300
are trying to be responsive to students you know we inherited a factory model 100 years ago and

04:05:04.300 --> 04:05:09.820
we've been trying to make it work for relationships for a long time and some of the changes like what

04:05:09.820 --> 04:05:17.740
you call for member porter around advisory groups that you know give a regular opportunity for a

04:05:18.380 --> 04:05:24.380
family group and social emotional supports in schools is one of the kinds of elements that

04:05:24.380 --> 04:05:30.380
some schools have undertaken that allow us to go beyond measuring climate but actually building

04:05:31.500 --> 04:05:38.140
the kind of climate for concern and caring that we need so i'm really in this conversation just

04:05:38.140 --> 04:05:44.860
proud to be part of this group of board members and really benefited so much from the presentations

04:05:45.340 --> 04:05:53.740
i want to note that our on our dashboard currently you know we have a measure on engagement of

04:05:53.740 --> 04:06:01.020
suspension rates which is intended to incentivize schools to reduce exclusion as a response to

04:06:01.020 --> 04:06:07.740
students and to increase inclusion but there's a lot more that one has to do than simply not

04:06:07.740 --> 04:06:13.660
suspend students you have to create an environment in which there are alternatives to exclusion in

04:06:13.660 --> 04:06:18.380
which there is community building which there's the building of opportunities for conflict

04:06:18.380 --> 04:06:24.780
resolution and community and and support and a lot of schools have been doing that and that

04:06:24.780 --> 04:06:30.700
shows up in their school climate indicators those that have been putting in place things like

04:06:31.980 --> 04:06:38.620
advisories and other support mechanisms for relationships restorative practices which

04:06:38.620 --> 04:06:44.060
include community circles kind of like the morning meeting that you would see in elementary school

04:06:44.060 --> 04:06:50.780
that you know include the opportunities for conflict resolution for you know students to be

04:06:51.340 --> 04:06:58.060
in a conversation with each other about how not to harm each other and how to be supportive of

04:06:58.060 --> 04:07:04.300
each other on a regular basis are really important and there's some evidence coming out some of it

04:07:04.300 --> 04:07:10.380
very recent that when those practices are in place many of them measured through the set of

04:07:10.380 --> 04:07:16.940
items on the healthy kids survey you see gains in achievement you see reductions in exclusion and

04:07:16.940 --> 04:07:24.780
just disparate discipline which often is discriminatory by race you see reductions in

04:07:24.780 --> 04:07:32.460
mental health suicidal ideation and anxiety and depression so we know something about the

04:07:32.460 --> 04:07:41.580
practices that really do make a difference in achievement attendance and self and well-being

04:07:41.580 --> 04:07:49.020
all of which also as member rodriguez said also supports educators in being better connected and

04:07:49.020 --> 04:07:54.460
supported and and having well-being so i think you know we see the value of these surveys those

04:07:54.460 --> 04:08:01.820
that are using them regularly and disaggregating them and really building them into a continuous

04:08:01.820 --> 04:08:07.020
improvement process are getting the benefits their students and their educators are getting

04:08:07.020 --> 04:08:16.220
the benefits of that so i hope that when we come back in march i guess is our next opportunity

04:08:17.340 --> 04:08:23.340
and we see how many districts are already benefiting from this that we could ask the

04:08:23.340 --> 04:08:28.940
cde to bring an item in march that looks at these questions of the frequency of the survey

04:08:29.900 --> 04:08:35.100
the ways in which we have expectations in the self-reflection tool for how those surveys might

04:08:35.100 --> 04:08:42.940
be analyzed and used and whether there is a possibility for some thoughtfully selected

04:08:42.940 --> 04:08:51.420
common items that would as a member all can put it allow for the flexibility of you know local

04:08:52.380 --> 04:08:56.140
engagement around the improvement process and a set of items but also

04:08:56.700 --> 04:09:04.300
allow for some comparison across schools and districts i hope we will be able then to carry

04:09:04.300 --> 04:09:09.260
this conversation forward at that time i also just want to note that there are a number of

04:09:09.260 --> 04:09:15.740
states that do include teacher surveys and so i think that's a whole nother conversation

04:09:16.540 --> 04:09:23.500
of educator and staff surveys that can augment what we learn from students in ways to help us

04:09:23.500 --> 04:09:29.740
build a healthy environment for everyone so something to put in the bicycle parking lot

04:09:30.460 --> 04:09:37.020
for the you know for a future opportunity to discuss as well this is an information item it

04:09:37.020 --> 04:09:45.820
was obviously a rich item and we will return to some of these issues very soon and now we

04:09:45.820 --> 04:09:52.780
have earned another 15 minute break so it is about 1 40 we'll see you back at 1 55

04:11:56.380 --> 04:12:01.820
good afternoon uh this is liz gian with public advocates also for the lcff equity coalition

04:12:02.380 --> 04:12:08.780
regarding item a the board is required under federal law to to approve the school site

04:12:08.780 --> 04:12:16.060
improvement plans these are the comprehensive support and improvement schools we repeat our

04:12:16.060 --> 04:12:22.140
strong concern as we have every year that we don't think you're doing a good enough job in

04:12:22.140 --> 04:12:28.860
overseeing the approval of the school site plans these schools represent the most tenuous school

04:12:28.860 --> 04:12:34.300
sites in the state and they're on the csi list in part because they haven't received the attention

04:12:34.300 --> 04:12:42.300
they need or oversight from their lea the way the department presents them to you is that the

04:12:43.020 --> 04:12:47.740
counties have approved the l caps which are supposed to indicate that these plans have

04:12:47.740 --> 04:12:52.700
been looked at but we don't think that's very comprehensive and we don't think that's good

04:12:52.700 --> 04:12:59.100
enough we think that there's really no external state educational agency actually reviewing

04:12:59.100 --> 04:13:06.380
csi plans and we don't think the federal law requires and it looks like we have

04:13:07.100 --> 04:13:12.380
one more caller um please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one minute

04:13:12.380 --> 04:13:19.820
your time starts now good afternoon jessica saco on behalf of children now the comprehensive

04:13:19.820 --> 04:13:23.900
support and improvement schools are our schools with the lowest five percent of performance across

04:13:23.900 --> 04:13:28.780
multiple state indicators these schools need to make significant improvements and that starts

04:13:28.780 --> 04:13:33.820
with having a local plan to lead their change process you as a board member are being asked

04:13:33.820 --> 04:13:38.220
to approve on a board consent item without discussion a set of school level improvement

04:13:38.220 --> 04:13:43.020
plans for these schools without any external entity reviewing these plans we believe that this

04:13:43.020 --> 04:13:48.860
is an insufficient level of review of our most at-need schools we encourage the board to schedule

04:13:48.860 --> 04:13:55.180
a deeper conversation on this issue and identify how some entity in the broader system of support

04:13:55.180 --> 04:13:59.340
could provide support for these schools by reviewing their plans and making recommendations

04:13:59.340 --> 04:14:05.580
to the board on whether a csi plan should or should not be approved i refer you to both the

04:14:05.580 --> 04:14:10.140
equity coalition and alliance for student success letters regarding this item for our full comment

04:14:10.140 --> 04:14:17.580
thank you thank you and that concludes public comment for the regular consent items uh oh six

04:14:17.580 --> 04:14:18.220
through nine

04:14:21.100 --> 04:14:29.900
okay um given that there's no further public comment i'll ask for a motion on consent items six through nine

tauri back now there she is okay um item five is the developments in the expansion of transitional

04:15:43.500 --> 04:15:50.540
kindergarten update on the universal pre-k and the pre-k to third grade alignment this is exciting

04:15:50.540 --> 04:15:58.140
for us because it's one of our first opportunities to hear how things are going with the scaling up

04:15:58.140 --> 04:16:04.940
of universal pre-k there is no recommended action at this time before we start the presentation i

04:16:04.940 --> 04:16:10.140
just like to help frame the discussion a little bit the adoption of universal pre-k by the

04:16:10.140 --> 04:16:15.260
legislature and the governor expands access to preschool education in a way that is really

04:16:15.260 --> 04:16:21.020
unmatched in scope and quality by any other state in the country you heard reference to that earlier

04:16:21.900 --> 04:16:29.420
today at this historic moment we need to help local education agencies focus on offering pre-k

04:16:29.420 --> 04:16:35.420
programs that are designed to maximize opportunities for developmental growth and encouragement to give

04:16:35.420 --> 04:16:40.460
every child a strong start in school and in reviewing the public comment that we've received

04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:45.580
to date on this item i'm reminded that it's not always clear which entities have decision-making

04:16:45.660 --> 04:16:52.140
authority for early education programs the purview of the state board of education is limited

04:16:52.140 --> 04:16:57.900
to grades k-12 which includes transitional kindergarten as the first year of a two-year

04:16:57.900 --> 04:17:03.020
kindergarten program so the california state preschool program and the other early education

04:17:03.020 --> 04:17:08.460
programs are under the authority of the state superintendent the department of social services

04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:14.860
the legislature and in the case of head start the federal government so there's a multifaceted

04:17:14.860 --> 04:17:22.540
governance structure of which we are a part for the part of for the transitional kindergarten

04:17:23.100 --> 04:17:30.460
element additionally the state board cannot appropriate state funds so we have had some

04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:36.700
comments about places where funding may be needed we do however have responsibility to set policies

04:17:36.700 --> 04:17:43.100
for important tk through 12 programmatic components related to curriculum instruction and assessment

04:17:43.100 --> 04:17:48.780
for determining the accountability measures and data collection for k-12 and this item will provide

04:17:48.780 --> 04:17:53.660
some baseline information for our continuing engagement in this space we look forward to

04:17:53.660 --> 04:17:59.340
continuing to work with the interest holders the department the legislature and the administration

04:17:59.340 --> 04:18:04.700
to fully realize the promise of universal pre-kindergarten and this item will be presented

04:18:04.700 --> 04:18:10.860
by sarah neville morgan and steven profiter of the cde sarah and steven please begin

04:18:10.860 --> 04:18:17.740
thank you so much board chair darling hammon we really are really excited about being before the

04:18:17.740 --> 04:18:24.220
board today to do this historic item so my name is sarah neville morgan and i'm a deputy superintendent

04:18:24.220 --> 04:18:29.820
of public instruction in the opportunities for all branch at the california department of education

04:18:29.820 --> 04:18:34.780
under state superintendent tony thurmond i'm joined today by steven profiter the director

04:18:34.780 --> 04:18:40.220
of the early education division and we're really excited to share all the work we've been doing on

04:18:40.220 --> 04:18:48.700
upk including the expansion of tk before we dive in we wanted to provide some level setting on what

04:18:48.700 --> 04:18:56.220
we mean by upk or universal pre-kindergarten upk is the expansion of the state's mixed delivery

04:18:56.220 --> 04:19:02.540
system to meet the early education needs of three and four-year-old children and their families

04:19:02.540 --> 04:19:08.620
in california we're relying heavily on transitional kindergarten or tk which will be the only program

04:19:08.620 --> 04:19:17.820
universally available to all four-year-old children by 2025-26 upk is an essential part

04:19:17.820 --> 04:19:23.500
of transforming california's educational system and giving every student in california a great

04:19:23.500 --> 04:19:29.580
start the creation of upk in california was recommended by california's master plan for

04:19:29.580 --> 04:19:36.060
early learning and care or our master plan which sets force the goals for the administration to

04:19:36.060 --> 04:19:41.820
establish and support upk the state board of education plays an important role in upk

04:19:41.820 --> 04:19:46.700
because the board has oversight over transitional kindergarten as board member darling hammon laid

04:19:46.700 --> 04:19:52.380
out as this is an important informational item and does not provide any recommendations the

04:19:52.380 --> 04:19:57.980
information we are sharing with you today is intended to ensure you are fully informed about

04:19:57.980 --> 04:20:04.060
the status of tk and how it fits into a bigger picture of upk in this presentation we will

04:20:04.060 --> 04:20:09.820
highlight curriculum assessment instructional materials and workforce requirements and

04:20:09.820 --> 04:20:16.700
professional learning alignment as those areas may come before the board either as tk specific items

04:20:16.700 --> 04:20:22.940
or in the context of other information and action items we also would like to recognize some

04:20:22.940 --> 04:20:28.940
components covered in this item are outside of the board's authority for example investments in

04:20:28.940 --> 04:20:34.220
certain program requirements like adult child ratios among other things however we have included

04:20:34.220 --> 04:20:38.700
them to provide context for the system in which the board's responsibility lies

04:20:40.220 --> 04:20:45.900
california's master plan laid out a roadmap for ensuring california's children thrive in their

04:20:45.900 --> 04:20:53.900
early years and explicitly called for promoting school readiness and increasing long-term school

04:20:53.900 --> 04:21:01.580
performance and educational outcomes by expanding access over time to achieve one year of free

04:21:01.580 --> 04:21:08.220
universally available and inclusive pre-k for all four-year-old children and expanding targeted

04:21:08.220 --> 04:21:14.380
access or targeted universalism to an additional year of publicly funded pre-k for all three-year-old

04:21:14.380 --> 04:21:21.580
children who are income eligible and well as children with disabilities through upk's mixed

04:21:21.580 --> 04:21:28.940
delivery system we will achieve universal access to tk for four-year-old children and have also a

04:21:28.940 --> 04:21:35.020
variety of other pre-k options within the system which will go over in upcoming slides and those

04:21:35.020 --> 04:21:40.220
will serve a growing number of three-year-old children in high quality pre-k programs as well

04:21:40.220 --> 04:21:45.340
as some four-year-olds whose families still choose that as their parent option these not only will

04:21:45.340 --> 04:21:50.060
equip our children with school readiness and healthy development but also prepare them for

04:21:50.060 --> 04:21:56.140
lifelong success i also want to elevate the master plan's recommendation to support children's

04:21:56.140 --> 04:22:02.380
learning and development by investing in our early educator workforce we all know how critical the

04:22:02.380 --> 04:22:07.580
teachers are including providing ongoing opportunities for professional development

04:22:07.580 --> 04:22:15.660
creating new workforce pathways and accelerating and enhancing existing ones and creating a pre-k

04:22:15.660 --> 04:22:21.900
to third grade ece teaching credential and implementing program standards that support

04:22:21.900 --> 04:22:28.140
educators to nurture children's learning and development as we work to follow the road map

04:22:28.140 --> 04:22:33.980
set out in the master plan we want like to emphasize that upk is also a key part of the

04:22:33.980 --> 04:22:42.300
state superintendent's larger transforming schools initiative implementation of upk alongside other

04:22:42.300 --> 04:22:47.660
investments in community schools professional learning anti-bias education mental health programs

04:22:47.660 --> 04:22:52.700
expanded learning programs and universal meals all of those are interconnected and present a

04:22:52.700 --> 04:22:58.380
historic opportunity to transform California schools into safe havens that support and nurture

04:22:58.380 --> 04:23:03.980
the whole child we're really excited about the interconnected nature of these investments

04:23:03.980 --> 04:23:10.860
and the opportunity to leverage them to build a preschool to third grade or p3 alignment in our

04:23:10.860 --> 04:23:17.020
system this historical universal approach to education is an opportunity for California to

04:23:17.020 --> 04:23:23.660
rethink or reimagine our educational system as one that brings equity to all students and families

04:23:23.660 --> 04:23:29.740
and also provides great opportunities for teachers and those interested in becoming teachers

04:23:30.300 --> 04:23:36.460
from those serving the littles all the way up through our pipeline well tk is the only

04:23:36.460 --> 04:23:41.260
universally available program we do want to highlight that it's part of a broader diverse

04:23:41.260 --> 04:23:48.620
and incredibly valuable system of programs serving our youngest learners upk brings together tk as

04:23:48.620 --> 04:23:54.380
well as all of our existing California state preschool programs and federal early education

04:23:54.380 --> 04:24:01.900
programs as well as private child care family child care and expanded learning opportunities

04:24:02.380 --> 04:24:08.780
including before and after school programs that help achieve a full day full year support

04:24:08.780 --> 04:24:12.060
for families and ensure a preschool learning experience

04:24:14.380 --> 04:24:19.820
upk is backed by an abundance of research demonstrating the positive benefits of the

04:24:19.820 --> 04:24:27.660
pre-kindergarten year prior to k-12 in both short and long-term outcomes the most consistently

04:24:27.660 --> 04:24:33.900
identified effects are on academic achievement at the end of pre-k and the beginning of k

04:24:34.540 --> 04:24:40.700
children who participate in quality pre-k have increased school readiness in both academic and

04:24:40.700 --> 04:24:47.100
in social emotional skills children who were able to attend two years of the abbott preschool

04:24:47.100 --> 04:24:53.420
program in new jersey had even stronger gains than those who attended for one year importantly

04:24:54.060 --> 04:24:59.580
much of the research on the early and targeted pre-k programs have indicated the strongest

04:24:59.580 --> 04:25:06.380
effects are for african-american and hispanic latino children multilingual learners and children

04:25:06.380 --> 04:25:12.620
from low-income families when they have access to quality programs in addition long-time evidence

04:25:12.620 --> 04:25:19.900
from the abbasidarian the chicago parent center and new ones from abbott new jersey studies

04:25:19.900 --> 04:25:25.660
indicate that children who attend pre-k experience lower rates of special education placement

04:25:25.660 --> 04:25:32.220
and grade retention in elementary school increased school readiness really lays that foundation for

04:25:32.220 --> 04:25:39.500
later academic success as well both the abbott preschool programs in new jersey and the total

04:25:39.500 --> 04:25:45.660
oklahoma program finds that from third grade through high school children who attended the

04:25:45.660 --> 04:25:51.740
pre-k programs and who continue to have quality learning experiences have higher scores on

04:25:51.740 --> 04:26:00.380
standardized tests in math language and literacy in the perry chicago parent centers and tulsa

04:26:00.380 --> 04:26:05.900
children who attend pre-k also have been found to have a higher likelihood of graduating from high

04:26:05.900 --> 04:26:13.420
school finally research from the early preschool programs abbasidarian perry and the child parent

04:26:14.060 --> 04:26:21.820
um child parent center and the tulsa oklahoma pre-k programs have shown strong positive effects

04:26:21.820 --> 04:26:29.500
for pre-k attendees in adulthood in tulsa after they turned 18 children who attended their

04:26:29.500 --> 04:26:36.940
school-based pre-k programs had both increased rates of voter registration and voting in elections

04:26:36.940 --> 04:26:43.020
showing stronger civic engagement that was one of those novel found findings that we just learned

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:50.380
about the abbasidarian chicago parent center and tulsa oklahoma programs all identified higher rates

04:26:50.380 --> 04:26:57.980
of college enrollment or attendance for those who attended the pre-k programs in tulsa pre-k

04:26:57.980 --> 04:27:03.660
participants from all racial ethnic groups at higher rates of two-year college enrollment and

04:27:03.660 --> 04:27:10.060
african-american and hispanic participants at higher rates of four-year college enrollment as well

04:27:11.020 --> 04:27:16.780
finally there is evidence of positive effects on adult health from the earliest to pair programs

04:27:17.340 --> 04:27:23.580
among the abbasidarian perry preschool and chicago parent centers they found lower rates of teen

04:27:23.580 --> 04:27:30.460
pregnancy hypertension diabetes and depressive symptoms in children who attended quality pre-k

04:27:30.460 --> 04:27:39.100
programs so a lot there in the rich robust research world moving into our alignment between systems

04:27:39.740 --> 04:27:47.340
upk also serves as a bridge between the early learning and care systems and the tk through 12

04:27:47.340 --> 04:27:54.780
grade or tk to 12 system we know a strong start in pre-k is only beneficial if it is sustained

04:27:55.420 --> 04:28:01.180
and we can't deliver on that promise of upk without the alignment and support of the early

04:28:01.180 --> 04:28:08.220
grades reinforcing and building off and accelerating children's previous pre-k experiences

04:28:09.660 --> 04:28:15.900
because of this the cde has also developed a preschool to third grade or p to three vision

04:28:15.900 --> 04:28:23.180
to set forth the intention and goals of upk to thrive in that broader p to three system

04:28:23.180 --> 04:28:29.020
the graphic you see right now comes from the national p3 center which is supporting us to

04:28:29.020 --> 04:28:37.820
create a strategic plan around p3 our cde mission statement for p3 is that all children have a strong

04:28:37.820 --> 04:28:45.100
and early start to inclusive education through high quality joyful rigorous developmentally

04:28:45.100 --> 04:28:50.380
informed and coherent preschool through third grade learning opportunities to ensure they

04:28:50.380 --> 04:28:57.020
thrive in school and and in life and are college and career ready the goals of this alignment

04:28:57.020 --> 04:29:03.100
initiative are to ensure first that we give all children a strong start for providing them that

04:29:03.100 --> 04:29:08.780
access with at least one year and for that promise for growing at least two years of high

04:29:08.780 --> 04:29:16.300
quality early education experiences two we ensure all pk to three elementary teachers

04:29:16.300 --> 04:29:22.380
are equipped to support and sustain learning by enhancing the teacher's competencies to optimally

04:29:22.380 --> 04:29:27.420
support child learning and development and implement instructional practices to sustain

04:29:27.420 --> 04:29:33.660
children's learning from k to three three we equip education leaders at the county

04:29:33.660 --> 04:29:39.180
district and school level so they understand the value of early education and support strong

04:29:39.180 --> 04:29:44.940
transitions for student success and enact organizational strategies to support meaningful

04:29:44.940 --> 04:29:52.220
alignment across that p to three learning continuum and lastly to empower and support families so they

04:29:52.220 --> 04:29:58.300
have meaningful engagement opportunities across the early years in pk and in the k to three

04:29:58.300 --> 04:30:04.060
settings that encourage them to play an active role as advocates and resources to facilitate the

04:30:04.060 --> 04:30:09.580
growth and development of young learners throughout this presentation you'll hear us making references

04:30:09.580 --> 04:30:17.420
to p3 and demonstrate how children and our young students can reap the benefits of tk and upk

04:30:17.500 --> 04:30:24.380
within a p3 system that ensures developmentally supportive instruction and a focus on the whole

04:30:24.380 --> 04:30:29.740
child i'm now going to pass this over to steve who's going to dive into some of the key elements

04:30:29.740 --> 04:30:38.060
from the item including tk expansion and rollout over to you steve thank you sarah i'll start with

04:30:38.060 --> 04:30:45.020
some context on how tk was created and expanded so first the kindergarten readiness act of 2010

04:30:45.020 --> 04:30:51.020
changed the last eligible birth date for kindergarten from december 2nd to september 1st

04:30:51.020 --> 04:30:56.220
so that all children would enter kindergarten as slightly older five-year-olds by 2014

04:30:56.940 --> 04:31:02.780
to support families whose kindergarten entry would be delayed by this change it established

04:31:02.780 --> 04:31:06.380
transitional kindergarten as the first year of a two-year kindergarten program

04:31:07.260 --> 04:31:13.580
the 2015-16 budget introduced early admittance tk as an option for children with birthdays between

04:31:13.580 --> 04:31:18.540
december 2nd and the end of the school year further bolstering access for children in this

04:31:18.540 --> 04:31:23.980
age range under this option district districts can choose to serve children in this birthday

04:31:23.980 --> 04:31:28.620
range but do not generate funding through average daily attendance for the child until their fifth

04:31:28.620 --> 04:31:36.620
birthday the 2021-22 budget introduced a timeline to achieve universal tk for all four-year-old

04:31:36.620 --> 04:31:42.780
children by 25-26 as well as new tk requirements and provided funding for upk planning and

04:31:42.780 --> 04:31:47.260
implementation and an increase in funding for expanded learning through the expanded learning

04:31:47.260 --> 04:31:54.300
opportunities program to support access to full daycare in the current year's budget 2022-23

04:31:54.300 --> 04:32:00.780
it provided additional lcff funding for tk and established fiscal penalties related to tk average

04:32:00.780 --> 04:32:06.620
class size and teacher to child ratio school districts and charter schools with tk receive an

04:32:06.620 --> 04:32:11.980
add-on to the lcff entitlement for the cost of an additional adult to meet the one to 12 ratio

04:32:11.980 --> 04:32:20.460
in tk classrooms the add-on amount is equal to the tk add-on rate 2813 dollars multiplied by the

04:32:20.460 --> 04:32:26.700
lea's current year tk average daily attendance fiscal penalties applied to any school district

04:32:26.700 --> 04:32:32.620
or charter school with tk enrollment not meeting the requirements for average class size adult to

04:32:32.620 --> 04:32:42.380
child ratio or teacher qualifications beginning in 2020-23-24 by 25-26 we will achieve the full

04:32:42.380 --> 04:32:48.300
implementation of universal tk meaning all children turning four by september 1 will be eligible

04:32:50.860 --> 04:32:58.140
this table included on page 12 of the item shows a timeline for changes in age eligibility for etk

04:32:58.140 --> 04:33:04.460
or early admittance tk and tk during tk expansion showing that two months of birth dates for

04:33:04.460 --> 04:33:10.140
children turning five are added in each year starting this year up until full implementation

04:33:10.140 --> 04:33:14.780
in 25-26 when all children turning four by september 1 will be eligible

04:33:16.780 --> 04:33:24.140
so what does expansion of tk mean for projected enrollment the learning policy institute has

04:33:24.140 --> 04:33:30.780
projected that tk enrollment will more than triple by 25-26 and serve approximately 70 percent

04:33:30.780 --> 04:33:35.100
of the eligible four-year-old population in california at full implementation

04:33:37.660 --> 04:33:45.340
so what is tk implementation looking like right now we've covered all of the areas of tk

04:33:45.340 --> 04:33:50.780
implementation listed here in detail in the item so today we'll highlight areas that are most

04:33:50.780 --> 04:33:57.740
relevant to the board's purview and indicated in green on the slide and those are access curriculum

04:33:57.740 --> 04:34:05.820
assessment workforce qualifications and professional learning the two workforce areas are primarily

04:34:05.820 --> 04:34:10.300
under the purview of the commission on teacher credentialing but are important to understanding

04:34:10.300 --> 04:34:19.180
the implementation of tk in the past two years we've witnessed historic investments to support

04:34:19.180 --> 04:34:27.020
the expansion of tk and the planning and implementation of upk these include the upk

04:34:27.020 --> 04:34:33.100
planning and implementation grant which supports lea's to expand access to upk through creating

04:34:33.100 --> 04:34:40.380
or expanding cspp or tk programs or establishing or strengthening partnerships with other upk

04:34:40.380 --> 04:34:45.900
programs in the lea's area the early education teacher development grant which supports the

04:34:45.900 --> 04:34:51.580
workforce by funding lea's to increase the number of early educators and increase specific

04:34:51.580 --> 04:34:58.700
competencies for tk kindergarten and cspp educators the upk mixed delivery planning grant

04:34:58.700 --> 04:35:02.860
which provides counties with funding to support relationship building among lea's

04:35:02.860 --> 04:35:07.580
the county office of education the local planning council and the local child care

04:35:07.580 --> 04:35:13.740
resource and referral to expand access to the mixed delivery system for three and four-year-old

04:35:13.820 --> 04:35:19.980
children and increase inclusion of children with disabilities our partners at the california

04:35:19.980 --> 04:35:25.420
commission on teacher credentialing have developed a pk3 early childhood specialist teaching

04:35:25.420 --> 04:35:31.980
credential and related to this is a charge from the 2022-23 budget to establish a upk mixed

04:35:31.980 --> 04:35:38.060
delivery quality and access work group that m aims to identify best practices for increasing

04:35:38.060 --> 04:35:43.820
access to high quality universal preschool programs and update preschool standards to

04:35:43.820 --> 04:35:50.700
reflect these practices so overall the cde has seized on the historic opportunity these

04:35:50.700 --> 04:35:55.980
investments have created and is providing extensive support guidance and resources

04:35:56.540 --> 04:36:02.140
including the creation of robust guidance documents to accompany the upk planning and

04:36:02.140 --> 04:36:08.220
implementation grants hosting regular upk webinars and office hours the creation of an

04:36:08.220 --> 04:36:15.260
faq page the launch of the california upk and p3 group on the california educators together

04:36:15.260 --> 04:36:23.340
platform a p3 alignment webinar series and a upk communications campaign including multilingual

04:36:23.340 --> 04:36:30.460
resources for family and community engagement that emphasize the benefits of upk and tk for

04:36:30.460 --> 04:36:34.380
children and families and empower parents to make informed choices

04:36:36.940 --> 04:36:42.460
to support implementation we have in partnership with the commission on teacher credentialing

04:36:42.460 --> 04:36:48.060
been using a constellation approach to guide all of our upk implementation and p3 alignment

04:36:48.060 --> 04:36:53.420
efforts the goal of this approach is to ensure that multiple sectors and levels within the state

04:36:53.420 --> 04:36:58.780
are working together to develop guidance to the field on tk implementation including local

04:36:58.780 --> 04:37:05.020
implementers researchers workforce communications and support systems partners among others

04:37:05.820 --> 04:37:10.540
these partners work together in the five thematic constellations you see in this diagram

04:37:10.540 --> 04:37:17.420
including local implementation and promising practices research workforce development upk

04:37:17.420 --> 04:37:24.780
support systems and partnerships communications and strategy the state leadership team and the

04:37:24.780 --> 04:37:31.100
upk p3 kitchen cabinet with representation from early childhood education organizations

04:37:31.100 --> 04:37:37.580
and state agency partners are the leadership teams setting strategic directions and aligning

04:37:37.580 --> 04:37:45.420
the constellation to meet overarching goals now i'll dive into sharing some successes

04:37:45.420 --> 04:37:53.660
related to access to tk we want to emphasize that when we talk about access access that while

04:37:53.660 --> 04:38:00.940
districts that serve kindergartners must offer tk tk is not mandatory for children to enroll

04:38:00.940 --> 04:38:07.180
and families will continue to be able to choose the program that best fits their needs additionally

04:38:07.180 --> 04:38:11.980
we want to note that this information is intended to provide context as these requirements are

04:38:11.980 --> 04:38:19.740
statutory and outside of the board's preview now while data from 2122 and the current school year

04:38:19.740 --> 04:38:25.980
isn't quite available yet the lpi projects that in this first year of expansion 2223

04:38:26.700 --> 04:38:33.820
137 000 children or 30 30 percent of all four-year-old children will be certain tk

04:38:35.020 --> 04:38:42.220
every lea expected to have tk enrollment received upk planning and implementation grant funds

04:38:42.220 --> 04:38:48.220
and as part of that we're required to present a plan for upk to their local governing board by

04:38:48.300 --> 04:38:57.180
june 30 2022 and submit their plans for upk to the cde in a survey in fall 2022 we have some

04:38:57.180 --> 04:39:01.340
useful data from the survey on the progress towards achieving universal access to tk

04:39:02.540 --> 04:39:09.260
and overall upk implementation with support from lpi we've analyzed a sample which represents the

04:39:09.260 --> 04:39:15.500
majority of these responses including 829 school districts and 594 charter schools

04:39:15.500 --> 04:39:20.300
which is about 97 percent of districts and 85 percent of charters with expected tk enrollment

04:39:21.100 --> 04:39:28.540
and 62 percent of all districts and charters in california in addition to these all 58 county

04:39:28.540 --> 04:39:34.860
offices of education responded to the survey you can refer to attachments three and four of the item

04:39:34.860 --> 04:39:45.180
for the full survey results so data from the surveys show the majority of lea's report

04:39:45.740 --> 04:39:52.540
they intend to offer tk at all sites which would support access to being to be evenly distributed

04:39:52.540 --> 04:39:59.420
geographically they plan to or are considering offering etk or early admittance tk which would

04:39:59.420 --> 04:40:05.820
accelerate expansion beyond the statutory timeline and they intend to offer full-day tk

04:40:05.820 --> 04:40:12.380
which would support families and having the coverage they need additionally 79 percent of

04:40:12.380 --> 04:40:19.020
lea's plan to combine tk with expanded learning programs and 20 with the california state preschool

04:40:19.020 --> 04:40:27.020
program to achieve a full day increased access to tk will have a huge impact on families across

04:40:27.020 --> 04:40:33.820
california especially for the 250 000 children eligible for the california state preschool

04:40:33.820 --> 04:40:40.300
program but unable to enroll due to limited space and also for the families of the 155 000

04:40:40.300 --> 04:40:43.420
children that aren't eligible for the california state preschool program

04:40:44.780 --> 04:40:49.740
lea's are also planning for how to engage families as tk expands with the most common

04:40:49.740 --> 04:40:55.980
strategies including family or parent surveys local control and accountability plan educational

04:40:55.980 --> 04:41:03.180
partner input sessions and engaging school site councils i'll now hand this back over to sarah

04:41:03.740 --> 04:41:09.500
thanks so much steve we're going to go on to curriculum the curriculum requirement for tk

04:41:09.500 --> 04:41:15.420
is to use a modified kindergarten curriculum that is age and developmentally appropriate

04:41:15.900 --> 04:41:21.820
it's also the intent of the legislature that tk curriculum be aligned to the california preschool

04:41:21.820 --> 04:41:28.300
learning foundations in a survey conducted this fall we found tk programs have interpreted this

04:41:28.300 --> 04:41:34.300
language in a tent in a variety of ways before we highlight those results we want to describe

04:41:34.300 --> 04:41:40.220
what a developmentally appropriate curriculum might look like as tk curriculum is under the purview of

04:41:40.220 --> 04:41:48.620
the board at age four children need a lot of hands-on experiences and movement opportunities

04:41:48.620 --> 04:41:55.580
for child-led learning oral language development and peer interaction through play exposure to

04:41:55.660 --> 04:42:02.060
interaction through play exposure to key topics in social emotional learning and developing their

04:42:02.060 --> 04:42:08.940
executive functioning skills and a scope of learning and sequence and foundational math and

04:42:08.940 --> 04:42:14.620
literacy skills these are all components that are based in the science of learning and development

04:42:15.260 --> 04:42:21.020
if you walk into a high quality pre-k classroom this might look like less emphasis on workbooks

04:42:21.100 --> 04:42:26.780
and a whole group instruction and more time spent in small group instruction to work on

04:42:26.780 --> 04:42:33.180
foundational skills these skills are then reinforced during center time and playful

04:42:33.180 --> 04:42:38.780
learning where children get to visit a range of centers or stations to apply their learning

04:42:38.780 --> 04:42:46.300
experiences to the dramatic play area building areas science exploration art games ongoing

04:42:46.300 --> 04:42:52.460
projects and the teachers are able to conduct formative assessments and scaffold the students

04:42:52.460 --> 04:42:59.260
learning an effective developmentally supportive curriculum also includes ample time for children

04:42:59.260 --> 04:43:04.460
to express their thinking through language this means children are not only listening to books

04:43:04.460 --> 04:43:10.860
being read to them but are engaging in discussion and making connections between books and topics

04:43:10.860 --> 04:43:17.900
they are learning and curious about as highlighted earlier in our p3 slide this philosophy of learning

04:43:17.900 --> 04:43:25.260
is needed across all the early grades especially in the pre-k through third grade space to ensure

04:43:25.260 --> 04:43:31.900
learning remains joyful and actively engaging for our youngest learners on page 19 of the item

04:43:31.900 --> 04:43:37.020
you'll see a reference to the boston public schools pre-k through second grade curriculum

04:43:37.020 --> 04:43:44.300
which is a good exemplar of this philosophy in action and also a public pre-k that has strong

04:43:44.300 --> 04:43:51.260
results as we move on to the curriculum approaches the first one that we'll share a little bit about

04:43:51.260 --> 04:43:57.340
is the whole child curriculum in a survey distributed this past fall to our p3 lister

04:43:57.340 --> 04:44:03.980
including educators and administrators in upa programs we asked the field what curricula they

04:44:03.980 --> 04:44:10.380
are currently using for upa and what support they need around curriculum resources presented

04:44:10.380 --> 04:44:17.660
here are results from 210 districts and county office administrators 24 school site administrators

04:44:17.660 --> 04:44:26.460
and principals and 207 tk teachers a total of just over 450 tk programs were represented

04:44:26.540 --> 04:44:33.660
across 305 districts and 53 counties we will walk through some key results on the next few

04:44:33.660 --> 04:44:39.340
slides but just wanted to know this is a subsample of tk programs and may not be

04:44:39.340 --> 04:44:46.780
representative of the larger tk population second about 14 percent of respondents also did not have

04:44:46.780 --> 04:44:53.900
a clear idea of the curriculum used in tk in their district and finally the survey was unable to

04:44:53.900 --> 04:44:58.620
ascertain how well a reported curricular approach is actually being implemented

04:44:58.620 --> 04:45:04.700
which research demonstrates is the critical component for child outcomes participant responses

04:45:04.700 --> 04:45:09.740
were categorized into different curricular approaches for tk the first is what we call

04:45:09.740 --> 04:45:16.220
a pre-k comprehensive or whole child curricula circled here these curricula are very popular

04:45:16.220 --> 04:45:21.580
in public preschool settings and typically highlight a range of developmental skills in

04:45:21.580 --> 04:45:29.340
a play-based frame as you can see in the yellow section 118 or 26 percent of tk sites that

04:45:29.340 --> 04:45:35.820
responded reported using a pre-k comprehensive whole child curriculum although this model can

04:45:35.820 --> 04:45:42.460
be implemented effectively there are a few cautions to note for strengths this curricular approach

04:45:42.460 --> 04:45:48.540
emphasizes play-based learning through child-led centers social emotional learning and developmentally

04:45:48.540 --> 04:45:55.420
informed content however they often lack sufficient explicit guidance on a scope and

04:45:55.420 --> 04:46:01.020
sequence for instruction of math and literacy skills and there is empirical evidence that

04:46:01.020 --> 04:46:07.660
domain specific curricula that target explicit math and literacy skills lead to higher gains

04:46:07.660 --> 04:46:13.740
in math and literacy compared to a whole child curricula alone with the largest achievement gaps

04:46:13.820 --> 04:46:20.460
observed for math skills in particular moving on we'll go to the second curriculum approach

04:46:20.460 --> 04:46:24.140
which is what is most aligned with the boston public schools pre-kindergarten

04:46:24.140 --> 04:46:30.060
model that i mentioned just a little bit earlier 50 tk sites are 11 percent of those who completed

04:46:30.060 --> 04:46:37.100
the survey are currently using a whole child or social emotional curriculum and a pre-k math and

04:46:37.100 --> 04:46:43.580
literacy curriculum that is developmentally appropriate about 10 of our tk sites that

04:46:43.580 --> 04:46:50.140
completed the survey are also using this combination approach and are supplementing using district

04:46:50.140 --> 04:46:56.300
developed math and literacy units instead of the publisher version so a smaller subset we have the

04:46:56.300 --> 04:47:03.820
11 and the 10 again if implemented to fidelity this approach is the most likely to be aligned

04:47:03.820 --> 04:47:09.660
with the science of learning and development emphasizing both the whole child and providing

04:47:09.660 --> 04:47:15.420
that strong foundation in math and literacy however because a combination of curricula

04:47:15.420 --> 04:47:21.500
is required fidelity of implementation can be difficult to achieve and can be more costly as

04:47:21.500 --> 04:47:28.700
the teachers may need additional supports moving on to our curriculum approach number three math

04:47:28.780 --> 04:47:35.900
and literacy and no explicit focus on social emotional learning this last curriculum approach

04:47:35.900 --> 04:47:41.740
runs the risk highest risk of not being developmentally supportive about 90 tk sites

04:47:41.740 --> 04:47:48.300
are 20 percent who responded using pre-k math and literacy curriculum or district developed units

04:47:48.300 --> 04:47:54.540
in math or literacy with no explicit full child or social emotional learning curriculum supplement

04:47:54.540 --> 04:48:01.260
or integration this typically looks like the tk program using a pre-k version of their

04:48:01.260 --> 04:48:07.420
kindergarten curriculum but there is no evidence of an explicit social emotional learning focus

04:48:07.420 --> 04:48:13.180
or time spent in centers or play domains that are really highlighted in our preschool learning

04:48:13.180 --> 04:48:19.580
foundations 10 of the sites reported using the same curriculum they use for kindergarten

04:48:19.580 --> 04:48:24.300
and may have mentioned the use of social emotional learning strategies but did not have an

04:48:24.300 --> 04:48:30.620
explicit focus on social emotional learning or time dedicated in the day for it well this option

04:48:30.620 --> 04:48:37.340
might be the easiest for districts to adopt and use in a tk k combo classroom it's also the least

04:48:37.340 --> 04:48:43.500
likely to support the learning needs of young children and less differentiation is practice

04:48:43.500 --> 04:48:48.860
and social emotional strategies are robust for example adjusting the curriculum for younger

04:48:48.940 --> 04:48:53.740
learners who might not be meeting the kindergarten standards and intentionally

04:48:53.740 --> 04:49:00.940
embedding social emotional topics throughout the curriculum as tk continues to expand to

04:49:00.940 --> 04:49:06.460
younger and younger four-year-olds we want to ensure curriculum is developmentally supportive

04:49:06.460 --> 04:49:12.860
a popular pre-k curriculum approach emphasizes the whole child which highlights how all the

04:49:12.860 --> 04:49:17.980
domains of child development are connected and should be valued for example social emotional

04:49:17.980 --> 04:49:24.060
development is a large component of expressing language and understanding text and executive

04:49:24.060 --> 04:49:30.860
functioning can support math learning and vice versa and the whole child their emotional social

04:49:30.860 --> 04:49:37.180
physical and cognitive well-being are all important and of value for the teacher to nurture

04:49:38.060 --> 04:49:44.140
overall a whole child approach is promised on the fact that learning depends on the combination of

04:49:44.140 --> 04:49:50.220
instructional relational and environmental factors to child experiences along with the

04:49:50.220 --> 04:49:56.460
cognitive social and emotional processes that influence one another as they shape the child's

04:49:56.460 --> 04:50:01.580
growth and development i will flag that that's a huge component around things like community

04:50:01.580 --> 04:50:10.140
schools with tk entering the k-12 system and the creation of a pk to third credential we also have

04:50:10.140 --> 04:50:15.900
an opportunity to adopt these practices from the science of learning and development in grades tk

04:50:15.900 --> 04:50:22.860
through third for example in our tk curriculum survey school and district administrators and

04:50:22.860 --> 04:50:28.780
teacher respondents also listed what supports they would like for curriculum and the top responses

04:50:30.220 --> 04:50:36.060
the top response was support for social emotional learning and adopting more play-based approaches

04:50:36.060 --> 04:50:42.060
in tk so this is clearly a need and an opportunity to introduce whole child practices

04:50:42.060 --> 04:50:48.940
in tk to third more broadly in fact our early learning standards for preschool

04:50:53.340 --> 04:50:58.140
in california are based on whole child development the preschool learning foundations which were

04:50:58.140 --> 04:51:03.260
created by the cde to set the learning expectations for children ages three to five

04:51:03.740 --> 04:51:10.300
serve a similar function as the common core state standards as you'll see detailed in the item the

04:51:10.300 --> 04:51:17.900
first volume was released in 2008 the next in 2010 and the third volume in 2012 because of the

04:51:17.900 --> 04:51:24.220
emphasis on the whole child several domains of learning are highlighted language and literacy

04:51:24.220 --> 04:51:30.780
math science and social sciences but also social emotional development visual and performing arts

04:51:30.780 --> 04:51:36.620
physical development and health we are also adding a new domain approaches to learning which

04:51:36.620 --> 04:51:42.700
covers children's executive functioning and self-regulation skills the cde also developed

04:51:42.700 --> 04:51:48.140
the preschool curriculum frameworks which details how to apply these domains of development to

04:51:48.140 --> 04:51:54.140
learning opportunities in the classroom to give you a better look at the format of the preschool

04:51:54.140 --> 04:52:00.220
learning foundations the one you see on the screen before you is an example of the number sense domain

04:52:00.220 --> 04:52:06.780
in math which details the milestone expected around age four or at the end of the first year

04:52:06.780 --> 04:52:12.700
of preschool and at age five or at the end of the second year of preschool or pre-kindergarten

04:52:13.260 --> 04:52:19.420
the structures represent a foundation or learning expectation and then examples of what that might

04:52:19.420 --> 04:52:26.300
look like in an early learning setting in the 2021 state budget the california department of

04:52:26.380 --> 04:52:31.500
education received funding to revise the preschool learning foundations as part of those

04:52:31.500 --> 04:52:37.660
revisions we're ensuring the content covered it's inclusive of tk additionally we are hoping to

04:52:37.660 --> 04:52:43.820
better align with sub domain categories in the kindergarten common core so that tk teachers can

04:52:43.820 --> 04:52:50.220
more easily crosswalk between those two sets of standards another major goal is to include language

04:52:50.220 --> 04:52:56.060
that is more inclusive of children with disabilities multilingual learners and capture

04:52:56.060 --> 04:53:01.820
the experiences of children from different racial and cultural backgrounds the revision of this

04:53:01.820 --> 04:53:09.500
document will be available in late 2023 we also receive funding to extend the preschool learning

04:53:09.500 --> 04:53:15.420
foundations to third grade to illustrate the developmental continuum across the preschool

04:53:15.660 --> 04:53:23.580
third grade period the plan is to focus on five major domains math language literacy science

04:53:23.580 --> 04:53:28.540
social emotional development and approaches to learning teachers will be able to reference this

04:53:28.540 --> 04:53:34.540
document to understand what development in these skills looks like across the learning trajectory

04:53:34.540 --> 04:53:40.780
as well as having hands-on examples the hope for this resource is to complement the common core

04:53:40.780 --> 04:53:45.340
by illustrating how preschool and developmentally supportive practices

04:53:45.340 --> 04:53:51.020
based on the science of learning and development can be integrated into the early grades while

04:53:51.020 --> 04:53:57.260
also retaining rigorous standards and expectations for learning i'll now hand this back to speed to

04:53:57.260 --> 04:54:06.620
share more about assessments thank you i'll now move on to assessment in tk tk is not required

04:54:06.700 --> 04:54:11.660
to use an ongoing whole child assessment i'll provide some context on assessment tools used

04:54:11.660 --> 04:54:15.580
in early learning and care programs since tk assessment is under the board's purview

04:54:16.460 --> 04:54:22.620
in the california state preschool program programs use the desired results developmental profile or

04:54:22.620 --> 04:54:28.140
drdp assessment twice a year this is a developmentally supportive assessment that aligns with

04:54:28.140 --> 04:54:33.740
principles from the science of learning for a variety of reasons one reason is that it covers

04:54:33.740 --> 04:54:38.620
a breadth of skills not just math and literacy but also looks at expressive and receptive

04:54:38.620 --> 04:54:43.980
language and vocabulary social emotional skills and approaches to learning like self-regulation

04:54:43.980 --> 04:54:50.140
and executive functioning the longer versions of the drdp tool additionally look at other domains

04:54:50.140 --> 04:54:54.860
covered in the preschool learning foundation such as physical development health habits visual and

04:54:54.860 --> 04:54:59.980
performing arts science and social science the second reason is that children are not pulled

04:55:00.060 --> 04:55:04.940
aside to work one-on-one with a teacher or computer screen instead assessment is integrated

04:55:04.940 --> 04:55:09.580
into a child's natural learning environment with a teacher recording observations or prompting the

04:55:09.580 --> 04:55:15.180
child to engage in a specific skill skill they want to assess such as counting during a learning

04:55:15.180 --> 04:55:21.900
activity the third reason is it's aligned to universal design for learning where children

04:55:21.900 --> 04:55:26.940
are able to respond or participate in the assessment in a variety of ways based on their

04:55:26.940 --> 04:55:32.540
home language and ability for example when assessing counting a child who is a dual language

04:55:32.540 --> 04:55:36.380
learner can say numbers in their home language and a child who has trouble sitting still can

04:55:36.380 --> 04:55:41.660
demonstrate the skill by jumping or clapping while they count while results can be calculated to

04:55:41.660 --> 04:55:46.620
form a summative score this assessment is primarily used for formative purposes and

04:55:46.620 --> 04:55:52.140
to assist teachers in individualizing instruction and overall curriculum planning at the classroom

04:55:52.140 --> 04:55:59.740
level this here is an example of the drdp preschool version for one subdomain within math

04:55:59.740 --> 04:56:05.100
number sense and quantity this subdomain captures not only the rope counting skills

04:56:05.100 --> 04:56:09.180
but children's understanding of quantity and making sense of what number means

04:56:09.820 --> 04:56:13.580
to address the developmental continuum of children that could be enrolled in preschool

04:56:13.580 --> 04:56:18.220
a wide range of skills are presented in the measure however at age three or the beginning

04:56:18.220 --> 04:56:22.780
of preschool children are typically in the exploring later or building earlier domain

04:56:23.340 --> 04:56:28.940
and by the end of preschool and transitioning into kindergarten are in building later or integrating

04:56:30.540 --> 04:56:35.900
here is an example from the drdp kindergarten tool where you will see the overlap within

04:56:35.900 --> 04:56:40.460
the preschool tool in the first three levels again to emphasize that there is a developmental

04:56:40.460 --> 04:56:44.940
continuum that is present in kindergarten and different children will fall on different places

04:56:44.940 --> 04:56:50.940
on the continuum even if it is below the kindergarten entry expectations the drdp

04:56:50.940 --> 04:56:55.340
kindergarten tool has actually been adopted by other states to use as a kindergarten entry

04:56:55.340 --> 04:57:00.540
assessment for example the state of illinois has adapted this tool as their mandatory kids

04:57:00.540 --> 04:57:05.580
assessment at a kindergarten entry in the domains of math language literacy social emotional and

04:57:05.580 --> 04:57:11.180
approaches to learning the drdp is also on several states menu of kindergarten assessments to choose

04:57:11.180 --> 04:57:16.220
from we're also aware of some counties in california who have used the drdp kindergarten

04:57:16.220 --> 04:57:24.140
tool in their programs the cd is making changes to the drdp to be more inclusive of tk so that

04:57:24.140 --> 04:57:28.780
programs may more readily adopt it for example you saw that we have a preschool version and a

04:57:28.780 --> 04:57:33.660
kindergarten version but we've heard from teachers that many tk kids either fall on one or the other

04:57:33.660 --> 04:57:38.300
depending on their developmental level so we are now combining the tool into one to cover the

04:57:38.380 --> 04:57:44.220
broader developmental trajectory that children may be presenting in tk we also plan to add

04:57:44.220 --> 04:57:48.620
structured prompts in math and literacy which are essentially direct assessments but still

04:57:48.620 --> 04:57:53.180
embedded in a child's learning experience and can be administered in a small group setting

04:57:53.980 --> 04:57:58.940
we're also extending the drdp to third grade in the domains of social emotional development

04:57:58.940 --> 04:58:04.220
and approaches to learning the hope for this tool is to demonstrate the value of these domains

04:58:04.220 --> 04:58:10.620
of development in the early elementary years as referenced in the item currently 29% of lea's

04:58:10.620 --> 04:58:16.380
are using the drdp and tk but we hope that this tool becomes more accessible for tk programs

04:58:16.380 --> 04:58:21.580
in the future the last thing i'll cover in our assessment section is the lpac requirement

04:58:22.300 --> 04:58:27.180
for both tk and kindergarten and english language proficiency assessment type of grade level

04:58:27.180 --> 04:58:31.900
standards is federally required for students in public schools within the first 30 days of

04:58:31.900 --> 04:58:36.940
enrollment the lpac is based on the kindergarten english language development standards

04:58:36.940 --> 04:58:43.180
however as tk is expanded to younger four-year-old children we will need to explore how to implement

04:58:43.180 --> 04:58:48.620
the reading and writing sections in a developmentally informed and an effective manner since the

04:58:48.620 --> 04:58:54.940
board's purview is over assessments in the lpac we wanted to flag this for you the final aspect

04:58:54.940 --> 04:58:59.580
of tk implementation we want to highlight is support for the workforce while the board does

04:58:59.580 --> 04:59:03.740
not have authority on workforce requirements or investments that support the workforce

04:59:03.740 --> 04:59:07.420
and understanding of the needs and current efforts are important given the essential

04:59:07.420 --> 04:59:14.220
role that educators play in tk implementation so tk teachers must meet the requirements

04:59:14.220 --> 04:59:20.140
and statute by august 1 2023 and these requirements include holding a number of

04:59:20.140 --> 04:59:24.380
credentials one of a number of credentials including a multiple subject credential general

04:59:24.380 --> 04:59:31.580
kindergarten primary t3 credential or others and additional expertise in ece or child development

04:59:31.580 --> 04:59:39.820
to meet the ece requirement specified in education code section 48 000 g4 teachers can get 24 units

04:59:39.820 --> 04:59:44.540
of coursework in early childhood education or child development have professional experience

04:59:44.540 --> 04:59:49.180
comparable to those units or have a child development teacher permit or the upcoming

04:59:49.180 --> 04:59:56.300
pre-k3 ece specialist credential as of july 1 22 the commission on teaching credentialing

04:59:56.300 --> 05:00:00.540
can issue a one-year emergency specialist teaching permit in early childhood education

05:00:01.180 --> 05:00:06.620
these emergency specialist teaching permits in ece also called emergency transitional

05:00:06.620 --> 05:00:11.340
kindergarten permits assist lea's that are not able to recruit a fully credentialed teacher

05:00:11.340 --> 05:00:17.420
for a tk classroom as more children become eligible for tk another aspect of implementation

05:00:17.500 --> 05:00:22.620
is a need for additional teachers the learning policy institute has estimated that as many as

05:00:22.620 --> 05:00:28.300
20 000 tk teachers will be needed for full implementation in 25 26 which means if lea's

05:00:28.300 --> 05:00:34.700
must recruit and hire another 12 to 16 000 teachers in the coming years in addition statute requires

05:00:34.700 --> 05:00:40.860
a one to 12 adult to child ratio in tk starting this year and given that tk is a maximum class

05:00:40.860 --> 05:00:45.020
size of 24 that means at beginning in this year every classroom needs a second adult

05:00:45.740 --> 05:00:51.500
at present that equates to approximately 4 000 additional adults well the full implementation

05:00:51.500 --> 05:00:56.940
in 25 26 up to 20 000 staff members will be needed in this role across the state

05:00:58.300 --> 05:01:03.020
the upk planning and implementation grant survey asked lea's to report what strategies they are

05:01:03.020 --> 05:01:08.220
planning to use to support their local workforce in meeting these requirements districts and charter

05:01:08.220 --> 05:01:12.460
schools are already planning a number of efforts to support both prospective and current teachers

05:01:13.260 --> 05:01:18.220
in this table found on page 25 of the item i want to highlight that many districts and charter schools

05:01:18.220 --> 05:01:22.780
are working in partnership with institutes of higher ed and their county offices of education

05:01:22.780 --> 05:01:28.140
to build the pathways for those prospective teachers and to support current teachers in

05:01:28.140 --> 05:01:33.340
addition lea's report logistical support is available in many places with advising on

05:01:33.340 --> 05:01:38.060
requirements information on scholarships and grant opportunities and in about a quarter of

05:01:38.060 --> 05:01:44.220
school districts and charter schools stipends for teacher tuition in addition to the required

05:01:44.220 --> 05:01:48.940
qualifications for tk teachers professional learning is an essential part of a quality tk

05:01:48.940 --> 05:01:54.540
program teachers leaders and staff will continue to grow as educators particularly in applying the

05:01:54.540 --> 05:01:59.660
science of learning and development in their classrooms ensuring that ongoing opportunities

05:01:59.660 --> 05:02:05.020
for all involved in tk and early education of coaching resources and mentorship will strengthen

05:02:05.020 --> 05:02:09.900
their competencies to understand and meet the developmental needs of diverse learners

05:02:10.860 --> 05:02:16.380
areas of focus for professional learning include social emotional learning language and literacy

05:02:16.380 --> 05:02:21.020
development and instruction for young children math and science development and instruction

05:02:21.020 --> 05:02:25.260
the preschool learning foundations and the use of developmentally informed curriculum

05:02:25.260 --> 05:02:30.380
as highlighted previously other areas for professional learning appropriate for tk

05:02:30.380 --> 05:02:36.060
educators as well as p3 educators and beyond can include anti-bias teaching mitigating implicit

05:02:36.060 --> 05:02:41.900
bias and reducing exclusionary discipline and practices such as suspension trauma-informed

05:02:41.900 --> 05:02:47.660
practice healing and restorative practices serving children with disabilities and supporting

05:02:47.660 --> 05:02:53.660
multilingual learners this table highlights the percentage of school districts and charter

05:02:53.660 --> 05:02:59.180
schools planning to offer professional learning opportunities in their plans or in seven areas

05:02:59.180 --> 05:03:03.900
related to developmentally informed practice this the great news is that more than half of

05:03:03.900 --> 05:03:08.700
school districts and charters have already included each of these areas in their plans

05:03:08.700 --> 05:03:12.940
the strongest responses are for professional learning and literacy and language development

05:03:12.940 --> 05:03:17.660
social emotional development with serving children with disabilities and inclusive settings

05:03:17.660 --> 05:03:21.900
curriculum selections and implementation and math and science instruction close behind

05:03:22.860 --> 05:03:28.700
if you look at table 12 and attachment three of the item you will see a few other topics

05:03:28.700 --> 05:03:33.420
for professional learning such as effective adult child interactions supporting multilingual

05:03:33.420 --> 05:03:38.860
learners using trauma-informed practices and engaging culturally and linguistically diverse

05:03:38.860 --> 05:03:43.900
families which fall under the 50 mark but more than 35 of school districts and charter schools

05:03:43.900 --> 05:03:52.700
plan to include them in addition to local efforts by lea's and their partners significant investments

05:03:52.700 --> 05:03:58.140
have been made at the state level to to support meeting the demand for qualified teachers and

05:03:58.140 --> 05:04:03.260
tk and beyond these investments allow lea's to spend money on teacher and staff recruitment and

05:04:03.260 --> 05:04:08.860
hiring as well as offering financial support to parent teachers and opportunities for future

05:04:08.860 --> 05:04:14.540
teachers to follow pathways into tk additional investments have been made specifically to

05:04:14.540 --> 05:04:19.100
increase availability and accessibility of professional learning for tk and their teachers

05:04:19.100 --> 05:04:24.540
such as the upk planning and implementation grant the early education teaching development grant

05:04:24.620 --> 05:04:31.020
educator effectiveness block grant the which is administered by the cde and provides

05:04:31.020 --> 05:04:38.540
1.5 billion in apportionments through june 26 to support professional learning for teachers

05:04:38.540 --> 05:04:43.580
administrators and paraprofessionals who work with students and classified staff that interact with

05:04:43.580 --> 05:04:49.740
students to provide accelerated reading support the current year budget allocated 15 million in

05:04:49.740 --> 05:04:54.700
one-time funding over three years to support 6 000 teachers and the 20 and the current year

05:04:54.700 --> 05:05:00.060
budget also established the golden state pathways program to support lea's to partner with higher

05:05:00.060 --> 05:05:06.380
education community groups and employers to promote pathways the commission on teacher

05:05:06.380 --> 05:05:11.100
credentialing also has a couple of grants the include the teacher residency grant program

05:05:12.060 --> 05:05:18.300
the one-time grants for four-year integrated teacher preparation programs and the california

05:05:18.300 --> 05:05:22.300
student aid commission last one i'd like to highlight here is the golden state teacher grant

05:05:22.300 --> 05:05:28.380
program an ongoing grant with 100 million in funding per fiscal year between 21 and 26 which

05:05:28.380 --> 05:05:34.860
provides up to 20 000 in individual grants to students in ctc approved professional preparation

05:05:34.860 --> 05:05:41.820
programs who commit to working in high needs fields such as tk one last investment in the

05:05:41.820 --> 05:05:47.580
tk workforce that is important to talk about is the pk3 early childhood specialist specialist

05:05:47.580 --> 05:05:56.140
credential which we will discuss in more detail now we'll briefly now the pk3 ece specialist

05:05:56.140 --> 05:06:00.780
credential is a specific investment that will support the tk workforce as well as other early

05:06:00.780 --> 05:06:05.820
education programs and overall p3 alignment the focus of this credential is the developmentally

05:06:05.820 --> 05:06:10.300
supportive practices and instructional strategies to support children from pre-k to third grade

05:06:10.300 --> 05:06:14.140
and ensuring that teachers can build the types of quality learning opportunities

05:06:14.220 --> 05:06:19.020
and environments that support whole child development build on prior experiences and

05:06:19.020 --> 05:06:25.900
integrate children's experiences characteristics assets abilities and needs the credential standards

05:06:25.900 --> 05:06:31.820
and teaching performance expectations for the pk3 ece specialist credential were approved at the

05:06:31.820 --> 05:06:37.900
october 2022 ctc meeting and the regulations for this credential are currently being developed by

05:06:37.900 --> 05:06:43.740
the ctc with the office of administrative law with an anticipated approval in january 23

05:06:44.140 --> 05:06:45.740
for closing i'll hand it back to sarah

05:06:48.060 --> 05:06:55.500
and we know this has been a really long item very thorough so i will just wrap it up tk and upk are

05:06:55.500 --> 05:07:00.220
tremendous achievements and opportunities to provide children in california with positive

05:07:00.220 --> 05:07:05.980
learning experience their strengths-based play-based approach to joyful engaged learning

05:07:05.980 --> 05:07:11.740
that supports their emotional social cognitive and language development california also has this

05:07:11.740 --> 05:07:17.420
opportunity to implement a p3 frame thereby creating greater potential for lasting school

05:07:17.420 --> 05:07:22.940
outcomes by adopting the science of learning and development principles and full child approaches

05:07:22.940 --> 05:07:28.620
into those early grades and while we didn't have time today we do want to hire two other essential

05:07:28.620 --> 05:07:34.540
areas that we will cover in our item more deeply tomorrow at least one of them in special education

05:07:34.540 --> 05:07:40.540
the importance of inclusion in the inclusion of children with disabilities in both tk and our

05:07:40.540 --> 05:07:45.500
california state preschool program our director of special education mother kelomies will dive

05:07:45.500 --> 05:07:51.180
into that a little bit tomorrow in the special ed annual performance report presentation

05:07:51.820 --> 05:07:56.780
additionally we really want to emphasize the importance of supporting our multilingual learners

05:07:56.780 --> 05:08:02.860
and ensuring that as tk expands so do the supports and programs that foster home language

05:08:02.860 --> 05:08:10.140
of multilingual learners along with the english acquisition that is so fun down foundational as we

05:08:10.140 --> 05:08:15.420
think about all of our children to create that sense and culture of inclusion and belonging

05:08:16.220 --> 05:08:22.860
we also want to acknowledge the governor's 2023-24 proposed budget includes the next year of

05:08:22.860 --> 05:08:28.220
funds for tk expansion which means many more children will benefit for tk for years to come

05:08:29.100 --> 05:08:35.180
finally we want to celebrate the california's historic investment in upk with utk as the

05:08:35.180 --> 05:08:41.340
foundational component is an investment in the future of california it creates a monumental

05:08:41.340 --> 05:08:46.860
impact for children who participate their families and their communities supporting children's

05:08:46.860 --> 05:08:52.140
development and foundational learning in their early years can increase their success in school

05:08:52.140 --> 05:08:58.540
and in life promoting positive health career and social outcomes in adulthood building up

05:08:58.540 --> 05:09:03.580
these strengths in children build strengths in their families and their communities and provide

05:09:03.580 --> 05:09:09.260
social and economic benefits to society as the whole this concludes our presentation

05:09:09.260 --> 05:09:13.980
so i'll hand it back over to our board chair and darling hammon

05:09:16.380 --> 05:09:23.180
thank you so much sarah and steven the extraordinary work that you are doing is really

05:09:23.180 --> 05:09:30.540
visible across every dimension of tk across a very complicated mixed delivery system

05:09:31.180 --> 05:09:37.340
bringing coherence and thoughtfulness to all of these elements with multiple agencies including

05:09:37.900 --> 05:09:49.020
cde and the ctc dss etc so we're we're very grateful to you for all of this effort we're

05:09:49.020 --> 05:09:57.260
going to go to the public comments slide and get the public comment queuing up right now those who'd

05:09:57.260 --> 05:10:02.620
like to call in can use the telephone number and the access code provided on the slide that is

05:10:02.620 --> 05:10:07.580
shown now i'd like to remind everyone of the framing comments i made at the beginning of this

05:10:07.580 --> 05:10:15.020
item and the state board's you know particular limited authority in this space and while we're

05:10:15.020 --> 05:10:20.780
waiting i want to ask our member patil broncette if she would like to kick us off with some comments

05:10:21.740 --> 05:10:29.100
thank you so i also just want to join our board president in thanking sarah and steven and also

05:10:29.100 --> 05:10:35.180
superintendent thurman for not only an incredible presentation but for incredible leadership and

05:10:35.180 --> 05:10:41.180
tenacity in rolling out what is an entirely new grade in california which has not been

05:10:41.180 --> 05:10:48.220
done in a couple of hundred years so it is a historic moment and and one that has required

05:10:49.020 --> 05:10:54.940
an incredible amount of labor but i think it has been a labor of love so i'm just incredibly

05:10:54.940 --> 05:11:02.060
appreciative of the work that cd has undertaken in order to actually move this forward i also

05:11:02.060 --> 05:11:09.180
just wanted to reflect on on an earlier comment that our board president mentioned about the

05:11:09.180 --> 05:11:16.540
scale of this program this will be the largest pre-k program for four-year-olds in the country

05:11:17.420 --> 05:11:23.260
and also just even to put it in the broader context of the multiple investments that the

05:11:23.260 --> 05:11:28.620
governor has made on the early side of early learning inclusive of the state preschool program

05:11:28.620 --> 05:11:36.140
and child care at full implementation california will be overseeing more early learning early care

05:11:36.140 --> 05:11:43.260
and learning seats in california than the entire of the federal government's investments in head

05:11:43.340 --> 05:11:49.100
start across all 50 states so it is an epic undertaking and it is i think incredibly exciting

05:11:49.100 --> 05:11:54.860
and and just want to salute the work that is being done across the multiple agencies to make that

05:11:54.860 --> 05:12:00.780
happen it is also i think equally important to recognize that it's it's not just a scale

05:12:00.780 --> 05:12:06.140
undertaking many of the impacts that sarah talked through in terms of school records

05:12:06.140 --> 05:12:10.620
terms of academic social emotional learning are all incredibly

05:12:12.860 --> 05:12:18.860
and the the data point that always i think stays with me is from getting down to facts around this

05:12:18.860 --> 05:12:26.860
idea that even though california's school districts are actually beating national averages already

05:12:26.860 --> 05:12:33.660
in terms of annual growth for the k-12 students because so many kids in california start in third

05:12:33.660 --> 05:12:41.020
grade almost a full academic year behind the catch-up is very very difficult and so the early

05:12:41.020 --> 05:12:47.820
learning investment i think that is being brought forward with utk is really a incredibly important

05:12:47.820 --> 05:12:53.740
strategy for making sure that all of that good work that's done in the later years does not have

05:12:53.740 --> 05:13:00.380
to be catch-up but can just be progress which is obviously i think what what all kids and families

05:13:00.380 --> 05:13:06.860
and supporters of public education want the last thing i'll just say is that i think across a number

05:13:06.860 --> 05:13:15.100
of the points in the powerpoint sarah and and steven both mentioned that this is a p to three

05:13:15.820 --> 05:13:21.340
frame and so this is work that connects not just for the year of utk but has implications

05:13:22.220 --> 05:13:29.660
relation and for ongoing work and coordination with three trajectories so that is super exciting

05:13:30.620 --> 05:13:39.100
i keep thinking of kamala harris saying that she was it was she was the first but not the last

05:13:39.100 --> 05:13:44.540
and i i think this will be the first sort of moment of thinking for so many school districts

05:13:44.540 --> 05:13:48.940
about how to work with early learning but it certainly will not be the last and there's lots

05:13:48.940 --> 05:13:56.460
of exciting work ahead so thank you guys again thank you i think unless there are there any

05:13:56.460 --> 05:14:03.100
clarifying questions that need to be asked now and then we'll get to go to public comment and

05:14:03.100 --> 05:14:10.060
come back for discussion vice president glover woods thank you i have just a quick clarifying

05:14:10.060 --> 05:14:15.340
question is the lpac currently administered to our tk students

05:14:18.540 --> 05:14:25.580
yes it is okay thank you sarah thank you right and that question will be in front of us as we

05:14:25.580 --> 05:14:33.580
get to younger and younger four-year-olds okay i see no other hands at the moment so let's go

05:14:33.580 --> 05:14:38.540
to public comment if there is some uh yes we do have one caller in the queue i will open the

05:14:38.540 --> 05:14:43.900
phone line now okay afternoon please state your name and affiliation for the record you have one

05:14:43.900 --> 05:14:51.420
minute your time starts now uh good afternoon jessica saco on behalf of children now we applaud

05:14:51.420 --> 05:14:56.300
the progress the state is making towards offering upk to all four-year-olds we are pleased the board

05:14:56.300 --> 05:15:00.700
has made space in its package agenda to receive an update and provide their perspectives on this

05:15:00.700 --> 05:15:05.660
important education initiative i applaud deputy superintendent sarah neville morgan and her team

05:15:05.660 --> 05:15:10.300
for the deliberate framing of the work before us as universal pre-k made up of transitional

05:15:10.300 --> 05:15:15.980
kindergarten csp head start expanded learning and private preschool providers and full recognition

05:15:15.980 --> 05:15:20.700
of the unique early learning and care needs of young children and their families progress to

05:15:20.700 --> 05:15:24.860
date is significant and there are still several implementation issues to be addressed which we

05:15:24.860 --> 05:15:29.100
describe in our letter i draw your attention to the role the state board and department can

05:15:29.100 --> 05:15:33.580
take in supporting and retaining the existing teacher workforce through promoting the utilization

05:15:33.580 --> 05:15:38.300
of educator effectiveness funds to support teachers in improving and growing their craft

05:15:38.300 --> 05:15:44.700
as younger children enter tk classrooms similarly the content and curriculum for tk classrooms must

05:15:44.700 --> 05:15:50.460
evolve to meet the developmental and educational needs of children as young as 48 months who will

05:15:50.460 --> 05:15:58.220
become tk students by 2526 thank you for your time thank you okay that concludes public comment

05:15:58.220 --> 05:16:09.580
for item number 10 thank you very much both for that amazing presentation and the thoughtful

05:16:09.580 --> 05:16:15.100
public comment and now is their board discussion i remind you this is an information item it's

05:16:15.100 --> 05:16:21.980
going to set the table for the work that we may need to do in the future but there's no decisions

05:16:21.980 --> 05:16:26.060
today any comments or questions

05:16:30.780 --> 05:16:36.940
member mccullin and then vice president glover woods yes thank you thank you for this item

05:16:37.420 --> 05:16:44.860
it's really exciting where you can capture additional children to have a preschool

05:16:44.860 --> 05:16:51.100
experience those that might be missing i'm so happy that we included head starts too and in

05:16:51.100 --> 05:16:59.020
the discussion and coordination i have a question on is there any type of recommended number of

05:16:59.100 --> 05:17:05.980
minutes or time for the pk programs thank you

05:17:08.540 --> 05:17:09.500
sarah steven

05:17:12.060 --> 05:17:18.620
how are you thinking about the time frame there's rank there's required minutes

05:17:19.500 --> 05:17:25.820
as part of tk so i think it's 180 instructional minutes but i'm getting confirmation on that

05:17:26.780 --> 05:17:33.020
yeah and then of course the way that it's framed is to be incorporated in

05:17:33.660 --> 05:17:39.740
to the extent possible full day program do you want to speak to that sarah as well yeah so it's

05:17:39.740 --> 05:17:47.260
180 instructional minutes or 36 000 minutes a year and that's within as you look at the expanded

05:17:47.260 --> 05:17:54.300
learning opportunities program the nine hours of programming if families so choose so that if the

05:17:54.300 --> 05:18:01.100
tk program is part day or school day you can still have some hours of the expanded learning

05:18:01.100 --> 05:18:05.740
program coming around that or in some cases they're using the california state preschool

05:18:05.740 --> 05:18:13.100
program or even head start to partner with for those so just to the layers of complexity

05:18:14.060 --> 05:18:20.700
there are part day and full day programs and then extended day wraparounds that are all being

05:18:20.700 --> 05:18:28.860
coordinated anything else okay member glover woods and then member yeshimoto tari and then

05:18:28.860 --> 05:18:35.340
member rodriguez thank you um steven and sarah thank you so much for such a comprehensive

05:18:35.340 --> 05:18:41.100
presentation and a comprehensive board item it's just very refreshing to be able to have

05:18:41.100 --> 05:18:47.900
conversation about what's happening with our our littles if you will and how critical that is to

05:18:47.980 --> 05:18:54.940
all of the other things we look at with grad rate and ele and math proficiency that foundation

05:18:54.940 --> 05:19:01.660
really starts with our our youngest learners and what we do to support them so i more this is more

05:19:01.660 --> 05:19:07.660
of a comment not a question at all but just to emphasize a statement that was in our board item

05:19:07.660 --> 05:19:14.220
which was that as we're thinking about transitional kindergarten and the curriculum and the practices

05:19:14.300 --> 05:19:21.660
that it's really about looking at taking those practices and pushing them up through k and through

05:19:21.660 --> 05:19:27.980
three as opposed to taking those education the elementary practices let's say in first and second

05:19:27.980 --> 05:19:33.260
grade and pushing them down it's going to be really critical um it's already been critical for

05:19:33.260 --> 05:19:37.500
transitional kindergarten because we've had that grade for for a little bit of time as we saw in

05:19:37.500 --> 05:19:43.420
the timeline but even as we expand it now to younger four-year-olds it's going to be critical

05:19:43.420 --> 05:19:48.620
that the curriculum and assessment is not kindergarten light but that it is actually

05:19:48.620 --> 05:19:55.900
developmentally appropriate for children coming in at that age and to set them up for success so

05:19:55.900 --> 05:20:01.900
thank you again for your presentation and i look forward to more conversation on this topic

05:20:03.420 --> 05:20:09.580
thank you so much um i think next is member yoshimoto tori then member rodriguez and then member

05:20:09.580 --> 05:20:16.300
oaken uh that was so articulately said vice president glover woods i i'm not going to repeat

05:20:16.300 --> 05:20:21.900
that uh in my own words because uh that was that's part of my concern this is a proud moment

05:20:22.620 --> 05:20:30.940
it's very very exciting uh and i would extend you know to connect with what you said of my

05:20:31.580 --> 05:20:39.500
wondering i suppose about the bridge between you know mixed delivery upk

05:20:40.140 --> 05:20:45.900
including transitional kindergarten but also being under the tk being under the purview of the sve

05:20:46.860 --> 05:20:53.100
just to the conversations around uh state frameworks coming up in the future which

05:20:53.820 --> 05:21:00.220
have connections to state adoptions for k-8 and wondering how we might be able to

05:21:01.100 --> 05:21:08.140
uh really have a seamless bridge you know particular in the mixed delivery model so that

05:21:08.140 --> 05:21:14.060
we're ensuring that there are developmentally supportive and appropriate expectations for our

05:21:14.060 --> 05:21:20.460
tk students but also for students that are in other programs in the mixed delivery model who

05:21:20.460 --> 05:21:24.460
will be joining their peers in the second year of kindergarten and elementary school

05:21:25.100 --> 05:21:29.660
and so i look forward to that conversation which doesn't need a necessarily a response today

05:21:30.220 --> 05:21:37.020
um particularly around the um the curriculum and you know the adoption pieces

05:21:37.980 --> 05:21:42.140
and then secondly and maybe this connects with the conversation tomorrow um

05:21:43.900 --> 05:21:48.220
so maybe a comment and not necessarily a question at this point but i noticed in the

05:21:48.220 --> 05:21:55.340
a supporting documentation that uh first was excited to see that for the state preschools

05:21:55.980 --> 05:22:00.140
contracting agencies that the set-aside amount for students with disabilities

05:22:00.140 --> 05:22:06.620
is increasing in the coming years um each year just a little bit more through 2024-25

05:22:07.340 --> 05:22:12.300
and that we expect that to increase um the percentages of three or four-year-old students

05:22:12.300 --> 05:22:17.180
since in state preschool with iups but that also that we didn't have the data on

05:22:18.140 --> 05:22:23.500
how many students in our state preschools were having that inclusive experience yet and so i was

05:22:23.500 --> 05:22:30.380
wondering about what are like what the next steps are to be able to capture that data or maybe

05:22:30.380 --> 05:22:35.500
perhaps what the barriers are that need to be problem solved and i'm happy to wait until

05:22:35.500 --> 05:22:41.260
tomorrow if that's more appropriate i'll do just a tiny response and then we can capture it a

05:22:41.260 --> 05:22:45.580
little bit more over there so first about the preschool learning foundations we so agree and

05:22:45.580 --> 05:22:51.820
it was wonderful to hear that they are required for use in our california state preschool program

05:22:51.820 --> 05:22:56.540
and a lot i would say probably in california all of the head starts also use the preschool

05:22:56.540 --> 05:23:04.140
learning foundations as well and then a lot of our title 22 sort of private pk programs also

05:23:04.140 --> 05:23:09.500
access them we make those freely available so there is much more expanded use of those

05:23:09.500 --> 05:23:14.540
across the state um so we'll see greater and greater alignment and then as we look at our

05:23:14.540 --> 05:23:20.300
littles with disabilities and including them one of the things that happened in this current year

05:23:20.300 --> 05:23:26.940
so sort of last year's budget cycle is um better data collection and so not only will are there

05:23:26.940 --> 05:23:33.420
requirements around pulling out tk as a separate indicator and grade basically to follow that but

05:23:33.420 --> 05:23:39.580
there are some around california state preschool program and our lea's where we will get the student

05:23:39.580 --> 05:23:44.780
identifier and that will also help us understand a little bit more about the children so that is

05:23:44.860 --> 05:23:50.860
something we continue to look at within cde as we look at what we call results count and wanting

05:23:50.860 --> 05:23:58.300
to use data to then inform our practice and how we're supporting our programs more thank you thank

05:23:58.300 --> 05:24:05.420
you so much member rodriguez um yes i have so much to say and i'm filled with excitement but i'm just

05:24:05.500 --> 05:24:16.140
going to keep it at my uh hats off my applause to everyone who has um gotten this initiative

05:24:16.140 --> 05:24:22.860
this far it's been a lot of work i remember um during governor newsom's first election he

05:24:22.860 --> 05:24:31.260
talked about how important it is to close that achievement gap in zero to three and um you know

05:24:31.260 --> 05:24:37.820
and seeing this uh come to fruition just fills me with joy so thank you thank you to everyone

05:24:37.820 --> 05:24:42.780
at every level terrific member alken

05:24:46.380 --> 05:24:54.140
i just want to echo the excitement um and also um you know i was struck by there was a slide about

05:24:54.220 --> 05:25:01.740
developmentally supportive curriculum and there was sort of a list of things that um a classroom

05:25:01.740 --> 05:25:06.700
should include or the curriculum should include that was developmentally appropriate and it was

05:25:06.700 --> 05:25:16.700
small groups rather than direct instruction and um there's a whole list and um what i noted was

05:25:16.700 --> 05:25:22.220
those are all the same things that i think are developmentally appropriate at the high school

05:25:22.220 --> 05:25:26.700
level or the middle school level um because they're so informed by the science of learning

05:25:26.700 --> 05:25:32.700
and development and um so the thing one of the things i'm most excited for and this is maybe a

05:25:32.700 --> 05:25:42.220
little um just based on the context in which um i've worked professionally is the ways in which

05:25:42.220 --> 05:25:49.500
the science of learning and development are driving the the the way we're in the way we're

05:25:49.500 --> 05:25:55.100
building the program the way the credentialing is going to be established the thinking around

05:25:55.100 --> 05:26:01.020
classrooms the thinking about curriculum and that that's not just tk but making its way up

05:26:01.020 --> 05:26:11.580
through third grade and hopefully really impacting the rest of our tk tk through 12 program as well

05:26:11.580 --> 05:26:18.940
and i just think that's a huge hugely exciting development for the state of california that we

05:26:18.940 --> 05:26:27.340
have this opportunity to um have the science of development be at the starting place of our

05:26:27.340 --> 05:26:32.380
program plan rather than commit working backwards and trying to figure out how to fix what we've

05:26:33.260 --> 05:26:43.020
inherited and was not planned around the way young people learn um all this time so yay thank you

05:26:43.740 --> 05:26:50.700
thank you member patilla bronson i just was prompted in hearing both sharon

05:26:51.900 --> 05:26:57.100
and allison's comments about the curriculum frameworks um to just flag that there are

05:26:57.100 --> 05:27:05.180
opportunities i think ahead to think about how how to incorporate um things from the preschool

05:27:05.180 --> 05:27:11.260
learning foundation more explicitly um the power of those frameworks oftentimes moves mountains

05:27:11.260 --> 05:27:19.660
and publishers and wanting to to sort of take that up in the future around how to make that

05:27:19.660 --> 05:27:26.140
more explicit and make the alignment not just legislative intent language but more more explicit

05:27:26.140 --> 05:27:35.420
and seamless yeah i noticed when we were when sarah and steven were talking about the curriculum

05:27:35.420 --> 05:27:39.420
and the nature of developmentally appropriate practice how many people had smiles on their faces

05:27:39.420 --> 05:27:47.660
so it is something that you know we want to build on throughout the grades well this is an

05:27:47.660 --> 05:27:54.220
inspiring and informative session it is an informational session we will have other decisions

05:27:54.220 --> 05:28:01.100
down the road we really appreciate it you gave us a wonderful inspiring end to our first board day

05:28:01.100 --> 05:28:08.700
and with that seeing no further discussion i want to thank sarah i want to thank steven all of the

05:28:08.700 --> 05:28:14.380
staff at cde who have been involved with this and in the other agencies who have been collaborating

05:28:15.100 --> 05:28:21.900
and our state board staff as well who have really helped to facilitate some of the actions that were

05:28:21.900 --> 05:28:27.260
needed to start this program off on such a good foot tomorrow we will meet in close session to

05:28:27.260 --> 05:28:34.460
