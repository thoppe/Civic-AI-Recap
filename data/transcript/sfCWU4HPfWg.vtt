WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
Thank you so much for joining.

00:05.760 --> 00:06.760
I'm Elizabeth Garlow.

00:06.760 --> 00:11.280
I'm a senior fellow with the new practice lab at New America.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.880
And last November, New America, in partnership with the Biden administration, hosted a gathering

00:15.880 --> 00:20.520
on policy design and implementation for equitable well-being.

00:20.520 --> 00:25.020
This was on the heels of a design sprint that we did with the Census Bureau and the Departments

00:25.020 --> 00:30.340
of Commerce and Treasury through an initiative called the Opportunity Project to develop

00:30.340 --> 00:34.940
tools that could help with the design and implementation of well-being measures.

00:34.940 --> 00:39.720
So throughout these gatherings and that sprint, we've cultivated this unlikely cross-section

00:39.720 --> 00:46.060
of policymakers, social and grassroots movement leaders across the U.S.

00:46.060 --> 00:51.440
We're coming together to really deep dive on data measurement framework and narrative

00:51.440 --> 00:55.880
building considerations to advance equitable well-being.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.520
So a group of participants, many of you are here today, have shared their interest in

00:59.520 --> 01:01.600
continued learning and exchange.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.280
And that is the purpose of our time together today.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.880
So as we open up, I'd like to ask two of my co-hosts to quickly introduce themselves,

01:09.880 --> 01:11.480
Tony Gadati and Amanda Janou.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.440
I'll turn it over to you.

01:13.440 --> 01:17.760
My name is Tony Gadati and I'm a JHD fellow at Harvard University's Edmund and Lily Safra

01:17.760 --> 01:19.120
Center for Ethics.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.640
The U.S. Health and Democracy Impact Initiative is a partnership between researchers, policymakers

01:23.640 --> 01:27.840
and stakeholders working to deliver ethics-based, impactful and timely solutions to urgent public

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
problems.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.140
We're so glad to be with you and co-sponsor this event because we know that meaningful

01:32.140 --> 01:37.040
prioritization of well-being and quality of life requires a whole-of-government approach

01:37.040 --> 01:38.040
to learning and policymaking.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.280
I look forward to hearing the discussions in today's webinar.

01:41.280 --> 01:43.240
Amanda, over to you.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.120
Hi, good morning, everyone.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.120
My name is Amanda Janou and I work as the economics and policy lead for the Well-being

01:50.120 --> 01:55.840
Economy Alliance, or WE ALL, which is a global movement of actors who recognize that economic

01:55.840 --> 02:00.360
growth accompanied by worsening social and environmental outcomes really can't be considered

02:00.360 --> 02:01.360
success.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.480
But that turning things around is going to require us to change the way we think, the

02:05.480 --> 02:08.840
way we act, and really critically the way we measure success.

02:08.840 --> 02:13.720
And a really important example in this movement is the well-being economy governments who

02:13.720 --> 02:20.200
have all moved beyond GDP to develop holistic well-being frameworks and indicators that

02:20.200 --> 02:25.320
begin to evaluate their societal progress by their level of social and ecological well-being.

02:25.320 --> 02:30.160
And Canada's quality of life framework is one of my personal favorites as they not only

02:30.160 --> 02:34.680
are measuring dimensions such as social connection and a sense of meaning and purpose, which

02:34.680 --> 02:41.760
especially this week we've heard is so critically urgent to begin looking more at within our

02:41.800 --> 02:44.080
own country here in the United States.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.640
But I'm just really excited that they'll be able to share a bit about their vision and

02:47.640 --> 02:51.800
learnings with our U.S. government here as well.

02:51.800 --> 02:55.360
And I just want to also share for anybody who's interested in learning more about the

02:55.360 --> 02:58.520
well-being economy government's work, I'm going to post it in the chat.

02:58.520 --> 03:03.520
They're hosting a gathering next month in Iceland where they're going to be diving into

03:03.520 --> 03:10.440
more discussions around well-being measurements, budgeting systems, and many other topics.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.920
Thank you so much, Amanda.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.720
So welcome to all of you.

03:13.720 --> 03:18.800
We have an amazing core group of U.S. federal policymakers, state and local policy leaders,

03:18.800 --> 03:22.600
and others who are really committed to well-being policy.

03:22.600 --> 03:27.240
And then we have these incredible colleagues in Canada who've been developing and spearheading

03:27.240 --> 03:31.080
early implementation of their quality of life framework, as Amanda just shared.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.360
So before we hear from them, I'd just like to turn it over to Rear Admiral Paul Reed,

03:35.360 --> 03:39.180
the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human

03:39.220 --> 03:40.220
Services.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.420
Admiral Reed and his colleague, Aaron McDonald, and their team are spearheading the U.S.

03:44.420 --> 03:49.460
Equitable Long-Term Recovery and Resilience Initiative, which is this incredible government-wide

03:49.460 --> 03:52.420
approach to improve well-being and long-term resilience in the U.S.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.220
So I'll turn it over to Admiral Reed.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.300
Thank you, Elizabeth.

03:57.020 --> 04:01.380
I'm just going to apologize upfront for my voice battling through a bit of laryngitis,

04:01.660 --> 04:05.380
but I am very happy to be here today and I'm thrilled that this meeting is occurring,

04:05.580 --> 04:07.100
particularly at this point in time.

04:07.500 --> 04:13.420
I consider it a bit of non-randomness that we're having this convening because I see

04:13.420 --> 04:16.060
a convergence of a whole bunch of activities occurring.

04:16.700 --> 04:20.940
And to be able to be in conversation with our Canadian colleagues on the work that they

04:20.940 --> 04:27.140
have historically done and continue to do is just incredibly informative at this moment

04:27.140 --> 04:30.020
for us to consider moving forward in a number of different ways.

04:30.620 --> 04:35.780
From where I sit as the Director of the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion

04:35.780 --> 04:42.940
within HHS, where we house our Hallmark program, Healthy People 2030, and have housed it

04:42.940 --> 04:49.820
for over 40 years, I think speaking from that position and that perspective, we've seen

04:49.820 --> 04:55.020
a very natural evolution over four decades and then some in the way in which healthy

04:55.020 --> 05:00.860
people entertains upstream factors, social determinants, and a broader perspective, a

05:00.860 --> 05:03.940
broader lens towards measuring health and now well-being.

05:04.780 --> 05:08.420
And we see that trajectory continuing into the next iteration.

05:08.820 --> 05:12.500
We're looking in the next couple of years to starting the process for developing Healthy

05:12.500 --> 05:13.580
People 2040.

05:14.180 --> 05:20.780
And part of that timeliness of this conversation is how this dialogue can be informative into

05:20.780 --> 05:23.700
the next steps of developing Healthy People 2040.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.540
That's just one of those convergences, as I mentioned.

05:27.380 --> 05:33.020
The other is, as Elizabeth mentioned, I've had the pleasure of being an Executive Shepard,

05:33.020 --> 05:38.980
if you will, for the Equitable Long-Terming Recovery and Resilience Plan, which now has

05:38.980 --> 05:45.900
a three-year history to it, born of the early stages of the pandemic response, when very

05:45.900 --> 05:52.820
difficult questions were asked of a cohort within the whole-of-government response

05:52.820 --> 05:57.780
framework around what the implications of the pandemic were going to mean for the federal

05:57.780 --> 06:03.980
government and for the whole of society, particularly entertaining a very complicated

06:03.980 --> 06:10.060
question, which is, what does the federal government need to do in the long term as we

06:10.060 --> 06:15.740
come through the pandemic response, through the recovery, and look to a long-term future in

06:15.740 --> 06:19.980
building out resilience for the nation, building to a higher level of resilience in this

06:19.980 --> 06:22.020
country than we knew in 2019?

06:22.500 --> 06:27.020
A very profound question with a lot of ramifications, not only for the federal government,

06:27.940 --> 06:31.580
but also for the way in which the federal government interacts with the whole of society.

06:32.740 --> 06:37.860
And we've been doing a great deal of work in that space, as Elizabeth alluded to, and as

06:37.860 --> 06:41.220
Erin will speak to a bit, I think, as well in our conversations later this hour.

06:43.220 --> 06:48.980
We believe the framework that the Canadians have developed and are utilizing ought to be

06:48.980 --> 06:51.300
very informative into that process as well.

06:51.980 --> 06:56.420
And we believe also, I'll speak for myself, I firmly believe that the work we're doing to

06:56.420 --> 07:02.180
develop a measurement strategy around resilience and all of its components is also going to be

07:02.180 --> 07:08.820
complementary to the next iteration of the Health and People 2040, and the way in which we

07:08.820 --> 07:13.580
look to expand on well-being as a concept and a measurement strategy around that as well.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.420
So with those remarks, I'll be quiet.

07:16.780 --> 07:20.660
My voice is probably going to force me to be anyway, and I'm going to get out of a way of

07:20.660 --> 07:24.900
great conversation. But I very much appreciate everybody being here, especially to hear from

07:24.900 --> 07:26.180
our Canadian colleagues. Thank you.

07:27.140 --> 07:31.140
Thank you so much, Admiral Reed, and we heard you loud and clear even through the laryngitis.

07:31.140 --> 07:32.100
So thank you for that.

07:32.780 --> 07:38.340
So I'm excited to turn it over to our colleagues in Canada who will share for about 20 minutes some

07:38.340 --> 07:41.780
background on their work with the Quality of Life Framework, and then we'll turn it over to Erin

07:41.780 --> 07:47.700
McDonald within HHS and the lead on the Equitable Long-Term Recovery and Resilience Plan to share

07:47.700 --> 07:48.860
some questions with our guests.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.020
So, Harry Walansky, I will start with you first.

07:52.020 --> 07:56.300
If you could please introduce yourself and then share some of your presentation, we would

07:56.300 --> 07:58.220
be delighted. Thank you so much.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.780
Thanks for the introduction.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.780
So delighted to be here to hear about the momentum that's coalescing together in different

08:05.780 --> 08:08.020
sort of parts of society.

08:08.380 --> 08:12.140
So not just within government, but civil society and all of that.

08:12.140 --> 08:14.620
I think that really mirrors our experience here in Canada.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.140
My name is Carrie Walansky.

08:17.700 --> 08:22.300
I come to you with two hats to talk about one of my very favorite topics, which is the

08:22.300 --> 08:24.740
story of origin of Canada's Quality of Life Framework.

08:25.740 --> 08:31.380
I have two hats because at the beginning of the development of Canada's Quality of Life

08:31.380 --> 08:35.900
Framework, I was the director responsible from a policy standpoint of that work in the

08:35.900 --> 08:39.380
Department of Finance, so tied into the budget process.

08:39.940 --> 08:45.580
I've now moved to Statistics Canada, which is responsible for the program of Quality of

08:45.580 --> 08:52.340
Life Statistics. So very much keen on taking this work to that sort of next level.

08:53.140 --> 08:58.020
So I'm going to be talking to you from both of those hats because a lot of your questions

08:58.020 --> 09:00.100
have talked about sort of how did we get here.

09:00.380 --> 09:05.820
So I'm going to start with almost my kind of finance voice and then shift into Statistics

09:05.820 --> 09:10.700
Canada. So if you wouldn't mind displaying the slides, we can go straight to the second

09:10.700 --> 09:21.860
one. So in distilling the international conversation in this space, there's such a

09:21.860 --> 09:28.340
clear convergence of the momentum around these three things, these three thematic areas.

09:28.660 --> 09:32.060
So people call it different things, could be quality of life, could be well-being, could

09:32.060 --> 09:36.980
be the social determinants of health, could be the multidimensional aspects of poverty.

09:36.980 --> 09:38.860
There are different ways into this conversation.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.420
But the core idea there is we need to be multidimensional and holistic and look at how

09:43.420 --> 09:48.420
the pieces fit together in terms of social, economic and environmental considerations.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.060
So that's sort of a thematic lens.

09:50.420 --> 09:54.460
But there's also this issue of equality, distributions, differences in outcomes for

09:54.460 --> 09:57.260
different groups and how you reflect that story.

09:57.580 --> 10:00.860
And then there's this sort of sustainability and resilience.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.900
So what does this all look like in terms of the trajectory and pathway we're on?

10:04.900 --> 10:07.060
What are the implications of our decisions today?

10:07.060 --> 10:09.460
What are the long term impacts and considerations?

10:09.780 --> 10:13.620
And sometimes sustainability gets wrapped into a conversation about climate change,

10:13.620 --> 10:18.060
which is obviously fundamentally important to the conversation about sustainability.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.380
But our frame for sustainability is broader than that.

10:21.380 --> 10:25.740
It's also about a life course approach to education and learning.

10:25.740 --> 10:29.900
It's about prevention and health and that sort of thing.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.620
So next slide, please.

10:35.900 --> 10:41.700
So this is I refer to this a moment ago, our process steps in our story of origin.

10:42.020 --> 10:47.700
We had direction from the prime minister to the minister for middle class prosperity

10:47.700 --> 10:52.940
and associate minister of finance at the time in his mandate letter at the beginning

10:52.940 --> 10:59.620
of the twenty nineteen mandate to lead work directly referencing work internationally

10:59.620 --> 11:04.620
by New Zealand and Scotland on integrating quality of life measurements better into the

11:04.620 --> 11:07.500
budgeting and policy development process.

11:08.060 --> 11:12.860
And so we'll talk a bit more about the process of how we got to the release and budget

11:13.020 --> 11:19.700
2021 of our framework and our approach to implementing in the in the budget process

11:20.460 --> 11:22.100
in budget 20. Sorry.

11:22.100 --> 11:29.140
And in the next mandate in twenty twenty one, the minister for middle class prosperity

11:29.140 --> 11:33.420
became the president of the Treasury Board and this work came with her.

11:33.740 --> 11:38.620
So my colleague Stephanie will talk about the role that the Treasury Board that supports

11:38.620 --> 11:41.940
her now plays in the implementation and leadership of this work government wide.

11:42.140 --> 11:46.020
But interestingly, the mandate letters which go from the prime minister, all ministers

11:46.020 --> 11:50.500
in the cabinet, all include this reference to integrating quality of life considerations

11:50.500 --> 11:52.780
into their decision making processes.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.980
So it's no longer just the responsibility of one minister.

11:55.980 --> 12:00.740
It's the responsibility of all ministers in cabinet to think about this alongside a

12:00.740 --> 12:05.460
practice. We have the longstanding practice to think about gender based analysis plus

12:05.780 --> 12:09.300
the plus being a broad range of other diversity considerations.

12:10.100 --> 12:15.060
And then with my stat can hat, we launched our quality of life hub in March twenty twenty

12:15.060 --> 12:20.580
two, which is the sort of public facing mechanism by which we bring together the measurement

12:20.580 --> 12:23.660
of the indicators and the framework that was launched in budget twenty twenty one.

12:24.260 --> 12:25.500
So next slide, please.

12:28.020 --> 12:32.220
Here it is. This is our framework and there's a lot going on here.

12:32.500 --> 12:36.580
But let me tell you about the architecture, which is actually deceptively simple.

12:36.780 --> 12:39.620
We worked hard to do the hard work to keep things simple.

12:39.620 --> 12:41.340
So it's got these five domains.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.740
And if you think back to the one, two, three in that first slide, the five domains are

12:45.740 --> 12:48.820
our way of trying to get at the multidimensional aspects of well-being.

12:48.980 --> 12:54.380
So prosperity, which includes housing, health, poverty, that sort of thing, health, which

12:54.380 --> 12:58.140
includes mental health as well as the care system and a positive mental health frame,

12:58.140 --> 13:03.380
importantly, society, which includes things like relationships to your community, to

13:03.500 --> 13:09.740
friends and family, time use, that sort of thing, environment, which includes the air

13:09.740 --> 13:12.660
quality and water quality. So how is your environment impacting humans?

13:12.660 --> 13:17.980
But also things like conservation and climate change.

13:18.660 --> 13:22.300
And is our environment healthy to keep sustaining us?

13:22.500 --> 13:27.340
And then good governance, which has, for example, trusted institutions, crime and safety,

13:27.980 --> 13:29.860
discrimination, human rights, that sort of thing.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.140
So we have the five domains of our framework.

13:32.140 --> 13:35.500
And then if you think again back to that one, two, three, we have these two crosscutting

13:35.500 --> 13:40.060
lenses. So if that was one, the domains are one and they're supported by a set of 84

13:40.060 --> 13:45.060
indicators. Two is this crosscutting lens on fairness and inclusion.

13:45.220 --> 13:50.340
So that is that gender based analysis plus practice of looking at each of the indicators,

13:50.340 --> 13:54.500
not just as a national average, but as a distributional picture.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.180
So what's happening underneath that are groups falling behind, et cetera.

13:58.420 --> 14:02.300
Then we also have a crosscutting sustainability and resilience lens.

14:03.100 --> 14:06.540
And that one is meant to get at that long term dimensions.

14:06.540 --> 14:10.420
And I'll be really interested, to be honest, to hear where your work goes on resilience.

14:10.700 --> 14:15.100
I think our framework is probably in its infancy on that element.

14:15.660 --> 14:18.180
It's there. People are asked to think about it in their work.

14:18.180 --> 14:19.620
It's not fully developed.

14:21.380 --> 14:22.300
Next slide, please.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.660
So in terms of the development of the framework, you had mentioned your

14:26.660 --> 14:32.620
intersectoral collaboration, that was very and the whole of government focus, very

14:32.620 --> 14:33.820
relevant for us as well.

14:33.820 --> 14:42.300
We had an interdepartmental group, the deputy minister of finance tasked his

14:42.540 --> 14:47.500
colleagues to form an assistant deputy minister group that met quite regularly

14:47.500 --> 14:49.420
through the period of development of the framework.

14:49.460 --> 14:54.940
And the idea there was to make sure that we were reflecting the existing frameworks

14:54.940 --> 14:58.180
that already were there, the key indicators, the departments were already working

14:58.180 --> 15:03.620
towards that sort of thing, as well as the subject matter expertise being fairly broad.

15:04.380 --> 15:07.860
So one of the things we kicked off with was a mapping exercise where we looked at all

15:07.860 --> 15:08.460
the other frameworks.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.860
So, for example, the Canadian indicator for the framework for the sustainable

15:11.860 --> 15:14.540
development goals, which indicators were they tracking?

15:14.740 --> 15:19.300
And we tried to simplify and distill what we were looking at in terms of

15:19.380 --> 15:23.180
the multitude of frameworks that exist across the government into these sort of

15:23.180 --> 15:28.140
overarching themes that were underpinned by this evidence base globally on life

15:28.140 --> 15:29.700
satisfaction evaluations.

15:30.820 --> 15:36.780
Canada is highly federated and unlike any work I've been involved in, frankly, as

15:36.780 --> 15:41.660
part of the federal government before, this framework goes much beyond the scope of our

15:41.660 --> 15:42.620
responsibilities.

15:43.260 --> 15:47.260
So we did not limit, we used that global evidence base to anchor us in what we

15:47.260 --> 15:50.940
thought we should be measuring rather than starting from what we were doing, proving

15:50.940 --> 15:54.220
it was working. And so that is a feature that's new.

15:54.220 --> 15:58.740
And it makes this kind of a monitoring framework versus, for example, you know, you

15:58.740 --> 16:01.980
could set targets off the back of your monitoring, but there's not targets and

16:01.980 --> 16:06.260
activities clustered against each of these each of these indicators.

16:06.260 --> 16:10.460
We're monitoring things that government may have little to do with in order to see

16:10.460 --> 16:11.460
how Canadians are doing.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.580
Also important in the Canadian context, we're having we're in the process of

16:16.580 --> 16:22.060
renegotiating around the Crown Indigenous relations and also reconciliation.

16:22.780 --> 16:27.500
And so we had conversations with national Indigenous organizations, many of whom have

16:27.500 --> 16:33.340
longstanding wisdom to offer in terms of holistic thinking, asset based framing and

16:33.340 --> 16:35.220
sustainability and long term thinking.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.660
You don't see it reflected right now in the framework architecture because our

16:39.940 --> 16:44.900
decision to support what they were saying was to invest in Indigenous led

16:45.420 --> 16:47.820
framework development and data sovereignty.

16:47.860 --> 16:52.540
So there's investments that came at Budget 2021 in Indigenous data governance.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.900
I do hope that over time that this work will sort of cross pollinate again.

16:56.900 --> 17:00.300
And we have sort of bookmarked that the framework remains evergreen to allow for

17:00.300 --> 17:05.140
that to happen. I mentioned the evidence base, so I won't go that into that again,

17:05.140 --> 17:09.780
just to say that we did talk to it was covid times, we talked to so many experts

17:09.780 --> 17:14.820
in this space were so grateful for their contributions and it was surprising extent

17:14.820 --> 17:18.500
to which even traditional economic stakeholders were along for the ride.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.500
And there was sort of focus on addressing data gaps, this distributional

17:23.500 --> 17:26.780
considerations, the long term perspective that you see represented in the

17:26.780 --> 17:28.620
framework. Next slide, please.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.300
I want to spend a second here because you asked about this idea of ground

17:33.300 --> 17:37.820
truthing. That's new language for me, but we did do this interesting exercise on

17:37.820 --> 17:42.380
public opinion research. And this was in August 2020, sorry, 2020.

17:42.420 --> 17:46.460
So it was early in the pandemic. People were still home and largely.

17:46.820 --> 17:50.620
And it was really interesting. It was one of the most interesting public opinion

17:50.620 --> 17:55.540
research panels the public opinion researchers had ever done because people

17:55.540 --> 17:59.420
were so reflective at that time about what was changing and what it meant for them

17:59.540 --> 18:03.060
and really sort of back to basic truth and principles about what matters.

18:03.060 --> 18:06.420
So these really basic things, physical health, financial security, mental health,

18:06.420 --> 18:10.700
personal safety, and there was a broad support for thinking about government

18:10.700 --> 18:13.420
moving beyond GDP. Next slide, please.

18:14.580 --> 18:18.500
So now I'm going to briefly switch over to my stat can hat.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.420
Say we launched this hub. I'd love for you to check it out.

18:21.860 --> 18:26.380
It's it's I'll make sure somehow I haven't figured out the mechanism, but I'll

18:26.380 --> 18:29.260
make sure you have a link to it so that you can go and explore what's there.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.820
It's still a work in progress. It will always be.

18:32.020 --> 18:34.300
But what it does is it provides the data that we have.

18:34.300 --> 18:38.900
So it pulls together from across Statistics Canada and other data providers,

18:38.900 --> 18:43.100
all of the supporting data and evidence underneath each of those indicators and

18:43.100 --> 18:47.220
related research so that you can access it in sort of a one stop place.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.820
We want to work on its functionality, that sort of thing.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.180
But what it's giving you is, you know, you know, you can go there and get the most

18:53.460 --> 18:56.020
recent data that's available on any of those indicators.

18:56.700 --> 19:00.660
We also have a program to actively look at data gaps and filling data gaps.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.700
And so that could be gaps where we've collected something.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.980
So we don't collect something at all.

19:06.980 --> 19:11.380
It could be gaps where we collect something, but it's, you know, every five years.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.100
So timeliness is the issue.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.940
Could be gaps where we collect something, but it's not disaggregatable

19:17.340 --> 19:20.220
in the way that we'd like to see in terms of the subpopulation

19:21.620 --> 19:25.540
just difference differences, or it could be that it's collected,

19:26.020 --> 19:27.340
but just not published.

19:27.340 --> 19:30.740
So we've been addressing all of those piece by piece.

19:30.740 --> 19:32.180
That's our work program.

19:32.180 --> 19:33.260
So next slide, please.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.140
I want to point to this, we're nearly done, but I want to point to this

19:38.140 --> 19:40.340
as an example of a data gap that we've filled.

19:40.620 --> 19:44.460
This is based on the UK's measure of sense of meaning and purpose.

19:44.460 --> 19:45.580
We adopted their measure.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.900
We think that international standardization is really valuable to build traction

19:48.900 --> 19:51.660
and consensus around these indicators.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.820
And so this is data that was never collected in Canada

19:54.820 --> 19:56.940
before the quality of life framework.

19:56.940 --> 20:00.580
And so it tells you about the distribution regionally of sense of meaning and purpose.

20:00.940 --> 20:03.940
And there's a age split here, age and gender split

20:03.940 --> 20:05.820
that I think is interesting on the bottom.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.980
You can see the lower levels of sense and meaning purpose

20:08.980 --> 20:11.060
around younger men than women, for example.

20:11.780 --> 20:16.180
So, you know, not declaring on what should happen or if anything, as a result of that.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.020
But it's just an interesting example of the sorts of signals

20:19.020 --> 20:21.420
you can see from this monitoring work.

20:21.420 --> 20:25.500
So last slide, I just want to take a moment to talk about

20:26.300 --> 20:28.500
sort of what we're seeing.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.300
One indicator, so it's not going to be a surprise to anybody

20:31.300 --> 20:33.300
that people are feeling the pinch of inflation.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.980
This is a conversation everyone's well familiar with.

20:36.340 --> 20:40.100
But I think to make the point about objective and subjective indicators

20:40.100 --> 20:45.020
and how they can complement one another, if you look at inflation trends,

20:45.500 --> 20:49.180
the growth in inflation starts to slow at the same time

20:49.180 --> 20:52.860
as people start to report having more and more difficulty paying their bills.

20:53.100 --> 20:58.300
So if you look at these three lines, the red line is people who are having

20:58.740 --> 21:00.860
who are finding it easy to pay their bills.

21:00.860 --> 21:06.420
And you can see that big dip in that last quarter, which is Q4 of 2022.

21:06.420 --> 21:11.180
So the winter last winter, you can see that big drop.

21:11.180 --> 21:13.100
So you can see it trending down and then it dropping.

21:13.100 --> 21:16.060
And conversely, the blue line is.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.860
Sorry, I got that backwards.

21:17.860 --> 21:21.660
Red is the easy or very easy, and that's coming down and very difficult

21:21.660 --> 21:23.740
is the blue and it's coming up.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.580
So more people are finding it much harder.

21:25.580 --> 21:28.020
You can see that crossover effect.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.860
So that's just an example of why it's interesting and relevant

21:30.860 --> 21:35.340
to monitor how people experiencing this economic trend

21:36.060 --> 21:38.380
versus just the economic trend itself,

21:39.060 --> 21:41.340
because that's the same time when people started to talk about

21:41.340 --> 21:43.780
the rate of growth slowing and things effectively getting better.

21:44.300 --> 21:48.060
So I'm going to wrap there and hand over to my colleague, Stephanie.

21:51.660 --> 21:52.660
Hello.

21:52.660 --> 21:56.580
So my name is Stephanie Gann and I'm a director of

21:56.580 --> 21:59.460
what he called Frameworks Integration.

21:59.460 --> 22:05.900
It's my team, then, that oversees the implementation of Quality of Life.

22:05.900 --> 22:10.500
The aim is to get it across the decision making cycle.

22:10.500 --> 22:16.820
But we'll get we'll we'll talk about that in some detail in just a moment.

22:16.980 --> 22:20.980
It is that Carrie, with her two hats, is able to cover off

22:20.980 --> 22:24.140
kind of two aspects of the journey.

22:24.980 --> 22:28.340
The one that I will focus on is about how to make it

22:28.340 --> 22:31.620
so that this framework is understood for what it can do

22:32.260 --> 22:37.380
with the tools that we have where I am in the Chartered Board Secretariat.

22:37.380 --> 22:42.100
So could I ask for a little bit more detail on how to make it

22:42.740 --> 22:44.660
in the Chartered Board Secretariat?

22:44.660 --> 22:49.540
So could I ask for my objective projected as possible?

22:59.620 --> 23:01.780
Thank you very much.

23:01.780 --> 23:04.540
So let's go to slide two, actually.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.420
So we understood that

23:09.460 --> 23:13.860
once you have the framework, the quality of life data in mind,

23:14.220 --> 23:19.780
what you naturally will progress to in terms of topics of interest is,

23:20.740 --> 23:26.460
yeah, how how is it going in our story is one about implementation

23:26.820 --> 23:31.220
and kind of what it is taking and what it will take to have

23:31.660 --> 23:34.820
what everyone is interested in, which is the impacts,

23:35.060 --> 23:38.140
the actual positive impacts on quality of life.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.460
And for here, for us, that means the well-being

23:41.940 --> 23:45.580
and quality of life of Canadians. Next slide, please.

23:50.500 --> 23:54.220
So this might be a curious place to start,

23:55.140 --> 23:57.860
although it might be something that's not too

23:58.300 --> 24:01.300
unfamiliar to kind of the policy practitioners.

24:01.980 --> 24:06.140
When we talk implementation in government,

24:06.420 --> 24:10.420
an essential piece of that is looking at the kind of supporting

24:10.620 --> 24:14.460
infrastructure, the nuts and bolts of the inside plumbing

24:14.660 --> 24:16.780
for how decision making happens.

24:17.060 --> 24:21.660
You can't just have a direct impact on on outcomes

24:21.740 --> 24:25.500
without thinking through how it is that decisions are made and how you get there.

24:26.220 --> 24:32.020
And so here what you have is the decision making process as we see it.

24:32.300 --> 24:36.380
The ambition is to see it so that the quality of life framework,

24:37.100 --> 24:41.460
its data and the approach is actually applied at every one of these steps.

24:42.020 --> 24:44.020
So where do we start?

24:44.020 --> 24:47.700
It's with the agenda that the government sets

24:48.020 --> 24:50.140
and the priority is that they identify.

24:50.420 --> 24:53.500
There are a number of different mechanisms by which this occurs.

24:54.420 --> 24:57.100
And so you have some that are listed here.

24:57.100 --> 25:01.060
For instance, the government will kick off every new session of parliament

25:01.060 --> 25:03.460
with a speech from the throne.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.580
There are mandate letters that carry referred to,

25:06.220 --> 25:09.740
which is how the prime minister communicates specific commitments

25:09.740 --> 25:15.060
and expectations to his or her cabinet ministers.

25:16.380 --> 25:21.420
It's with that agenda, then, that the minister of finance

25:21.420 --> 25:28.100
identifies budget priorities based on input from from from all ministers.

25:29.100 --> 25:32.460
This is an important piece

25:32.460 --> 25:36.220
of the quality of life puzzle in that, yes, as much as

25:38.220 --> 25:40.860
as much as we at the Charter Board Secretariat

25:40.860 --> 25:44.100
are responsible for implementing quality of life.

25:44.780 --> 25:48.380
It was by virtue of the mandate letters that this responsibility was clarified

25:48.380 --> 25:55.420
to be that of all ministers is just here at TBS that we need to be supporting them

25:56.420 --> 25:58.780
in their duties.

25:58.780 --> 26:02.180
So what we what we'll get to in just a moment

26:02.180 --> 26:06.140
is about how quality of life is reflected in the budget process.

26:08.340 --> 26:11.460
Once you have your budget priorities,

26:12.260 --> 26:17.140
there is a step of going to cabinet for for discussions

26:17.140 --> 26:19.500
and for outstanding policy authorities.

26:19.860 --> 26:24.140
It's from there that there is a little bit of a handoff to my department.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.820
It's that as the as a TBS, we are secretariat

26:28.820 --> 26:34.620
to the executive cabinet committee known as Treasury Board.

26:35.140 --> 26:39.980
It has a particular role in vetting implementation proposals

26:39.980 --> 26:43.300
of things that have funding, things that have policy authorities.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.860
It's here that we have a number of levers

26:47.580 --> 26:49.700
to make things happen

26:49.740 --> 26:53.900
before things hit the ground running with ministers and departments

26:53.900 --> 26:58.980
are rolling out policies in implementation and monitoring and evaluating them.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.780
So that is the overview of kind of the steps

27:03.420 --> 27:07.500
where we hope to integrate quality of life into the process.

27:08.220 --> 27:13.580
But there is something about how introducing new initiatives,

27:13.580 --> 27:16.300
new ways of thinking, even if they make sense,

27:17.060 --> 27:20.220
how it really just cannot be done all at once.

27:20.580 --> 27:23.340
There are hats, there are leads,

27:23.820 --> 27:29.340
and there is the importance of coordinating.

27:29.700 --> 27:33.740
So I think in this space, even from the government perspective,

27:33.740 --> 27:37.540
where you're supposed to be the strong suit is planning

27:38.860 --> 27:40.980
and making plans and making plans to plan.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.900
But there is a patchiness to it.

27:43.940 --> 27:47.340
I think of introducing new things, even if they matter,

27:47.340 --> 27:49.300
even if they can make a difference.

27:49.300 --> 27:53.260
So there's a little bit of a story of that that we'll look at a little bit

27:53.260 --> 27:56.220
a little bit more. Can I get to the next slide, please?

28:00.740 --> 28:04.700
So what you would have seen in the decision making process

28:04.700 --> 28:08.100
is a number of steps that have

28:09.020 --> 28:12.620
the central agencies or government having in our government

28:12.620 --> 28:16.060
having share, having some responsibility for.

28:16.660 --> 28:22.620
So that's the Preview Council Office that oversees the cabinet process.

28:22.620 --> 28:24.980
It's the department that supports the prime minister.

28:26.860 --> 28:32.020
They are a very important partner for for us.

28:33.060 --> 28:35.500
It is really, though, kind of

28:36.340 --> 28:40.980
finances efforts in implementing quality of life and our efforts as TBS.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.420
That will be the focus here.

28:44.380 --> 28:46.460
But it is that

28:48.460 --> 28:51.700
you'll you'll see that in different jurisdictions,

28:52.060 --> 28:56.580
there normally is the appreciation for how quality of life as a policy

28:56.580 --> 28:58.780
lead needs to reside centrally.

28:59.060 --> 29:02.940
There are some things you give up when you have it somewhere different in

29:04.620 --> 29:05.780
health, let's say,

29:06.780 --> 29:09.700
or in a social department where, let's say,

29:10.380 --> 29:12.740
the work on well-being is significantly more advanced.

29:12.980 --> 29:17.220
You really do give up some some levers, but that is the choice that that you can

29:17.660 --> 29:18.660
that you can make.

29:20.180 --> 29:24.020
There are sometimes decisions to house the lead in

29:25.340 --> 29:27.700
a version of the PCO.

29:28.700 --> 29:33.620
We as you all heard and as we'll talk about more in the next slide,

29:34.140 --> 29:39.220
I can make the choice of putting it in the Treasury or a department of finance.

29:40.220 --> 29:42.420
That creates a certain thank you very much for that.

29:43.140 --> 29:45.300
That creates a certain

29:45.300 --> 29:48.020
foundation and puts you on a certain path.

29:48.460 --> 29:51.100
I don't think there's consensus over

29:52.060 --> 29:54.140
what is what is the best choice.

29:54.140 --> 29:58.340
There has to be some appreciation for where a particular jurisdiction is at

29:58.340 --> 30:00.860
and what levers are available.

30:00.860 --> 30:01.860
Side note.

30:02.940 --> 30:05.540
That we have a Treasury Board secretary, it's a bit weird

30:06.140 --> 30:09.140
to to to lots of lots of partners,

30:09.740 --> 30:14.020
and that's something that we that has advantages and disadvantages.

30:15.460 --> 30:19.300
But more concretely, when we're talking about quality of life implementation, then

30:19.580 --> 30:24.700
and in in budgeting, which is where we kicked it off under

30:25.340 --> 30:27.660
under Carey's work, in fact,

30:27.660 --> 30:30.060
what we're talking about is

30:31.860 --> 30:37.020
in in the course of identity, identifying budget priorities.

30:37.340 --> 30:40.460
Normally, it's the case that the minister of finance will actually have a call out

30:41.220 --> 30:47.820
call up for budget requests from from the rest of cabinet ministers.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.220
And there's a very well defined process for this

30:52.460 --> 30:58.620
and a very particular form that proposals for budget measures takes.

30:59.020 --> 31:02.540
And this becomes really quite important in holding the purse strings.

31:02.540 --> 31:05.460
The Department of Finance is able to set a certain standard

31:05.700 --> 31:09.220
for the kind of information required for budget measures.

31:09.860 --> 31:13.820
And since twenty twenty one, this has included the identification

31:13.820 --> 31:17.340
of expected impacts on quality of life indicators.

31:17.780 --> 31:21.500
This means that at the development of these measures,

31:21.740 --> 31:24.340
this is something that has to be thought about and considered

31:25.980 --> 31:28.260
with some conscientiousness.

31:29.540 --> 31:32.020
So it is that since a budget twenty twenty one,

31:33.020 --> 31:37.180
budgets have been published with an impacts report that summarizes

31:37.460 --> 31:39.980
these impacts on a measure by measure basis.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.740
Now, this ends up being very important for TBS.

31:45.420 --> 31:47.620
Next slide, please.

31:49.780 --> 31:55.660
So it was in late twenty twenty one that the handoff process happened.

31:56.060 --> 31:59.540
So it was now that quality of life was in the budgeting process.

32:00.140 --> 32:02.740
How do we roll it out more generally?

32:03.540 --> 32:07.260
So it's that if we go back, so not actually go back in the deck.

32:07.740 --> 32:10.100
But if you can remember in the decision making process,

32:10.100 --> 32:13.420
when we're at implementation, this is where actually TBS has

32:13.500 --> 32:16.020
quite a significant role.

32:17.380 --> 32:23.100
It is that as in providing support to Treasury Board, again, that statutory

32:24.100 --> 32:25.620
cabinet committee,

32:27.580 --> 32:31.460
it it has a function as the government's management board

32:32.700 --> 32:36.420
and ensures that implementation plans of things that are funded

32:36.420 --> 32:41.780
and have appropriate policy cover are consistent with the government's

32:42.740 --> 32:46.580
TV policy suite, one of which is the policy on results.

32:47.860 --> 32:50.820
So at TBS, it's that

32:50.860 --> 32:55.780
in this capacity, we have a number of tools to establish expected outcomes

32:56.300 --> 33:01.100
for deputy ministers, expectations for management practices

33:01.380 --> 33:05.940
and policies for new program designs, but also for the existing spending base.

33:06.940 --> 33:11.060
And this is pretty important for the kind of change

33:11.060 --> 33:15.300
that we want to see incorporating quality of life into government work.

33:15.980 --> 33:19.460
So these implementation proposals that end up being presented

33:19.460 --> 33:22.900
to the Treasury Board, well, we are wanting

33:24.060 --> 33:27.300
these proposals have a number of components that are required,

33:27.620 --> 33:30.180
including details on program design,

33:31.100 --> 33:35.180
implementation costs, but also expected results.

33:37.100 --> 33:41.100
Importantly, funds approved through budget just cannot be accessed

33:41.100 --> 33:43.820
without approval of of the Treasury Board.

33:43.860 --> 33:49.180
And that is a lever that we that we use and intend to use

33:49.860 --> 33:52.140
with a little bit more vigor.

33:52.140 --> 33:54.900
Going ahead, we are looking at the integration,

33:54.900 --> 33:59.100
the better integration of quality of life data into these proposals,

33:59.260 --> 34:03.700
consideration of the framework in plans for evaluation and performance

34:03.700 --> 34:07.660
measurement, alignment of government program outcomes

34:07.660 --> 34:09.660
with quality of life indicators.

34:09.660 --> 34:14.500
And I would say that TBS also has a very important role

34:14.500 --> 34:16.620
in government wide reporting.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.900
Federal departments prepare an annual plan,

34:21.300 --> 34:25.380
annual reports, rather, on their plans and results achieved.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.980
And the president of the Treasury Board

34:27.980 --> 34:30.740
tables these reports in parliament.

34:30.740 --> 34:35.260
It's that the TBS develops requirements for these plans

34:35.820 --> 34:38.020
and guidance for how to meet them.

34:38.500 --> 34:42.620
And on the reporting front, we're looking at options for how to introduce

34:42.620 --> 34:46.220
something like a common reporting frame on quality of life

34:46.460 --> 34:50.100
that can help shape departmental narratives

34:50.740 --> 34:55.140
in the interest of clarity and transparency to Canadians

34:55.140 --> 34:58.100
and parliamentarians on what we're doing on quality of life.

34:59.260 --> 35:03.020
Because, in fact, that's where more minutes, just a couple of hours.

35:03.420 --> 35:05.420
And then we'll turn to questions.

35:05.420 --> 35:08.300
Sorry, I will try to wrap that up then.

35:08.300 --> 35:10.940
So next slide, please.

35:12.700 --> 35:15.940
So I think maybe I'll tie it up together by saying

35:16.500 --> 35:19.900
it is in it might feel as though

35:20.300 --> 35:24.740
TBS in the role of implementation might feel as though it's inside baseball.

35:25.660 --> 35:29.900
But it is that if you don't get some of these processes and steps in place,

35:30.220 --> 35:34.620
you're kind of shooting darts in in the in the dark.

35:35.980 --> 35:39.620
What matters here is the results at the end.

35:39.740 --> 35:42.140
That is how the approach survives.

35:42.140 --> 35:45.100
That's how you show that it has value.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.820
But on the way there, there are a number of things that have to come into play.

35:48.860 --> 35:53.260
There is a tremendous amount of coronations I mentioned among central agencies,

35:53.580 --> 35:56.380
but also with the departmental community as well.

35:56.740 --> 36:01.140
Quality of life did not show up on the scene, a blank slate.

36:01.180 --> 36:03.180
There was a lot that was going on previously

36:03.180 --> 36:05.980
that was quite well aligned with well-being work.

36:06.220 --> 36:08.420
And it's really important that we acknowledge this

36:08.860 --> 36:11.500
to be able to have the partners to move ahead together.

36:12.500 --> 36:15.660
None of what we're proposing here is trivial.

36:15.900 --> 36:17.100
It's not a checklist.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.060
And it actually requires building some foundational blocks,

36:20.340 --> 36:24.220
including capacity and training and perhaps recruiting differently

36:24.220 --> 36:28.700
for the kind of perspectives we want to see reflected in policy work going ahead.

36:29.540 --> 36:32.940
Kerry had mentioned how the quality of life framework is not just about leavers

36:33.540 --> 36:35.700
and outcomes of the federal government controls.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.100
And for that reason, our engagement with the outer

36:39.260 --> 36:43.660
the outside community is extremely important to say nothing of how it is

36:43.700 --> 36:47.180
that all this work is premised on this idea that Canadians see themselves

36:47.180 --> 36:50.860
in their framework, agree and support that we have identified

36:50.860 --> 36:52.700
the things that that matter.

36:52.700 --> 36:56.540
And for the fact that the work in the framework is evergreen means that that exchange

36:57.660 --> 37:00.820
and of information and feedback is, I think, a crucial piece.

37:01.180 --> 37:03.380
So to tie it all up, maybe I would say that

37:04.780 --> 37:07.620
engagement opportunities like this are very important for us

37:07.620 --> 37:11.460
to be able to learn from other jurisdictions and also other sectors as well.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.580
Thank you for the flex on time.

37:15.420 --> 37:17.340
Great. Thank you, Stephanie.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.740
There is so much to share.

37:18.740 --> 37:22.060
I think it's that's always the challenge of an hour of conversation.

37:22.060 --> 37:24.580
But a first step in that and we'll unpack a little bit.

37:24.580 --> 37:29.300
So thanks to you and Kerry for sharing just the big frame and all of the

37:29.580 --> 37:32.580
kind of pieces, I think we're going to spend a couple of minutes kind of pulling apart.

37:32.580 --> 37:35.340
I have a couple of questions for you both just to reflect on

37:35.820 --> 37:40.340
that align with what you shared and maybe go a little bit deeper into a couple aspects.

37:40.900 --> 37:43.540
I'll mention just I know that we've seen some questions pop through

37:43.540 --> 37:46.220
in the Q&A and the chat, so keep them coming.

37:46.220 --> 37:49.260
And I'm going to include some of the questions that have been shared

37:49.260 --> 37:52.660
into what I'm offering to both of our colleagues to reflect on

37:52.660 --> 37:56.220
because they were aligned with what's on our minds as well as we went into the conversation.

37:56.220 --> 38:00.100
So I think first, one of the things that we

38:00.100 --> 38:04.180
and I know I personally have been really curious about is why quality of life

38:04.220 --> 38:09.700
as the kind of centerpiece or the North Star or the core of the focus for the framework.

38:10.140 --> 38:15.100
And was there any deliberation in terms of how you really oriented towards that

38:15.100 --> 38:19.580
as the centerpiece and were there other kind of directions that were in play

38:19.860 --> 38:23.340
as you develop the approach?

38:23.340 --> 38:26.300
So, yes, there were.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.180
And I mean, this is part of the challenge.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.900
I call this the hall of mirrors.

38:29.900 --> 38:34.300
So while there are a lot of people active in this space,

38:34.540 --> 38:39.060
it's often say the Department of Health, which is essentially creating a framework

38:39.060 --> 38:43.340
which points up to health as the ultimate outcome, or it's the Department of Finance

38:43.580 --> 38:46.980
that's saying, yeah, quality of life is well and good.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.820
But it's really about prosperity at the center of things.

38:51.500 --> 38:55.900
And so there's a lot of alignment in the kind of horizontal thinking.

38:55.900 --> 38:59.700
But when you get to that sort of what are we driving towards, what's the big picture?

39:00.580 --> 39:03.100
That was a bit trickier.

39:03.100 --> 39:08.380
So we did have lots of negotiations and, you know, it's never going to be completely done.

39:09.300 --> 39:14.500
But our sort of idea was that this this was, you know, you don't even though

39:14.500 --> 39:18.060
poverty is an important determinant of health, you don't fix poverty

39:18.060 --> 39:20.060
solely to achieve a health outcome.

39:20.940 --> 39:24.540
You know, poverty is its own determinant of well-being.

39:24.820 --> 39:29.060
And so there's continues to be an active dialogue in this space.

39:30.140 --> 39:33.060
But in terms of quality of life versus, say, well-being,

39:33.060 --> 39:35.820
we actually did public opinion research on that question, too.

39:36.180 --> 39:38.460
Quality of life came out ahead.

39:38.460 --> 39:42.540
Another sort of framing thing that is a bit of attention is, is this just another name

39:42.540 --> 39:46.020
for social as distinct from environment and economic?

39:47.300 --> 39:50.980
And you can see in our framework that that's not where we landed.

39:51.220 --> 39:55.260
This quality of life framework brings in the environment and economy

39:55.260 --> 40:00.380
in a sort of a different way that's more integrative, in my opinion.

40:01.140 --> 40:04.340
So that that's kind of a bit of a a bit of a synopsis,

40:05.420 --> 40:08.100
synopsis of many, many, many discussions.

40:09.620 --> 40:10.660
Super helpful.

40:10.660 --> 40:13.820
Stephanie, do you want to add anything or?

40:13.820 --> 40:19.460
Sure. So it was that we were a little bit less implicated in those discussions

40:20.380 --> 40:21.900
that landed the framework.

40:21.900 --> 40:24.700
But in the course of pursuing implementation,

40:24.700 --> 40:29.700
I think what we find is maybe I would say a couple of things.

40:29.780 --> 40:34.980
The first is that by keeping the door open to the fact that it is evergreen,

40:34.980 --> 40:39.180
I think there is this this this tension as we're rolling out internally.

40:39.380 --> 40:41.820
Is it where we want it to be?

40:42.420 --> 40:44.940
But in terms of the starting point, it's that we have quality of life.

40:44.940 --> 40:48.140
So we're sticking to it for now.

40:48.140 --> 40:53.260
But it is that for the other miss or the other departments

40:54.220 --> 40:58.940
that are grounded in the work that they are they are pursuing,

40:59.260 --> 41:03.820
they are they are proposing other centers, let's say.

41:03.820 --> 41:06.580
Or it's that you have the framework, but you could have different centers.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.860
So let's say they would advocate for a certain center

41:10.780 --> 41:15.020
to say nothing of how I think in the environmental or sustainability space,

41:15.060 --> 41:18.140
there is an expansion of it

41:18.580 --> 41:22.660
that in some circles would be seen as like rival ring, rivaling

41:23.820 --> 41:25.660
what the quality of life is supposed to capture,

41:25.660 --> 41:28.700
which is essentially everything at a certain societal level.

41:29.540 --> 41:33.900
So it's that I think you will have these this this this tension

41:33.900 --> 41:38.580
between competing, competing framers, competing visions of the world.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.140
It's kind of part and parcel of the exercise,

41:41.460 --> 41:44.020
even if you think you've landed something for a little bit.

41:44.580 --> 41:46.980
That's great. Yeah, I think we face the same tension.

41:46.980 --> 41:49.980
But I think where we've come to, at least now, is how do we help

41:50.300 --> 41:54.140
folks from very different points of view see themselves in different frames,

41:54.140 --> 41:57.140
even if they have one orientation and understand it's all related

41:57.700 --> 42:00.100
in terms of the intersections that you're both pointing out?

42:01.300 --> 42:04.300
So I wanted to ask, I know this is a much deeper question than we can get to,

42:04.300 --> 42:08.700
but any insights on how you approach kind of moving from big ideas

42:08.700 --> 42:12.460
or concepts to more operational qualities of measurement,

42:12.460 --> 42:14.580
all of the things that are in the framework that you have,

42:14.580 --> 42:17.220
I think are really important, big ideas.

42:17.420 --> 42:20.460
And then, you know, the quality of how do you make that concrete

42:20.460 --> 42:25.340
in a way that's not burdensome and also feels like it's it's really orienting

42:25.340 --> 42:29.100
to a core set of measures to be helpful in advancing that idea.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.700
So I'm curious if you have any insights about how you approach that.

42:35.220 --> 42:39.060
I think the mapping exercise that we did was sort of a bottom up version of that.

42:39.060 --> 42:40.980
So what are we already measuring that matters?

42:40.980 --> 42:44.260
But then there's sort of a top down approach to where you start from,

42:44.260 --> 42:46.060
you know, what is the big picture, what's our North Star,

42:46.060 --> 42:48.460
what does the evidence say about what we know matters?

42:48.460 --> 42:50.940
And I think both of those things coming together is important

42:50.940 --> 42:54.780
because we included some things in our framework that we didn't have existing

42:54.780 --> 42:58.420
measures for, but also mapping the international landscape matters, too,

42:58.420 --> 43:00.740
as I mentioned in that one example that I provided.

43:01.180 --> 43:05.260
But I think there's sort of a you want to come at it from different perspectives

43:05.620 --> 43:09.740
and try to sort of articulate where you want to be.

43:09.780 --> 43:13.220
And then once you've got a shape to things, then you so so we included measures

43:13.220 --> 43:15.300
in our frameworks that didn't exist.

43:15.300 --> 43:18.860
And I think that's important because then we put in our next steps list.

43:19.300 --> 43:21.820
OK, we have to go and figure it out now to measure that thing.

43:22.340 --> 43:24.620
And so it was a sort of a separate step to say,

43:24.620 --> 43:26.860
what do we think is important to have in the framework?

43:26.860 --> 43:28.700
And then how are we going to measure it?

43:28.700 --> 43:30.420
What's the definition?

43:30.420 --> 43:33.740
And so that work was led by it has been led by Statistics Canada

43:33.980 --> 43:36.540
versus the conceptual framing led by finance.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.260
Right. OK.

43:40.140 --> 43:43.540
I do think the the finance and stats

43:43.540 --> 43:47.300
can work was the heavy lifting and the very first

43:47.540 --> 43:51.580
foundational step to get to anywhere in our implementation work.

43:51.700 --> 43:55.660
This is I think the first discussion that we have to get out of the way of,

43:55.940 --> 43:58.660
oh, what is quality of life that's really nebulous?

43:58.660 --> 44:00.460
It can mean anything.

44:00.460 --> 44:02.700
And our answer is no, no, we have a framework.

44:02.900 --> 44:06.500
There are 84 things we're saying it can mean for now.

44:07.940 --> 44:12.300
And and yes, we might not have data sources for just about

44:12.740 --> 44:14.940
or for all of them, but we're just about there.

44:16.140 --> 44:18.660
But just having identified the indicators, of course,

44:19.140 --> 44:21.340
is not at the end of the project.

44:21.340 --> 44:22.940
That's where we're supposed to be helpful.

44:22.940 --> 44:29.220
So it's like we are as CBS in the business of making the concept real.

44:29.900 --> 44:34.100
So I had mentioned or maybe not in that my title is very long.

44:34.180 --> 44:36.460
My division is results division in TVS.

44:36.740 --> 44:40.580
It needs to go from concept to actual result.

44:40.900 --> 44:45.980
But it could be that it could be that you're looking at,

44:46.820 --> 44:49.700
I guess, different kinds of operationalization.

44:49.900 --> 44:52.980
There is one way in which, oh, yes, just moving the needle on the

44:53.420 --> 44:55.700
the indicators is what you are looking for.

44:56.380 --> 45:00.100
But for us in the machinery of government, we

45:01.220 --> 45:04.500
look at government initiatives on an initiative basis.

45:04.820 --> 45:08.460
And for each, they are they are supposed to be able to say

45:09.340 --> 45:13.780
what they will do for Canadians and to be able to to draw that link

45:14.060 --> 45:16.500
to the quality of life framework.

45:16.500 --> 45:19.740
So maybe that's a good plug for how as much as TVS provides

45:19.740 --> 45:22.420
the like supports to be able to make that happen.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.900
The expertise is not the policy expertise is not here.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.140
The departments tell us how that's possible.

45:28.140 --> 45:30.420
What makes sense, what logic models make sense.

45:31.340 --> 45:33.380
We can only support them in that effort.

45:33.380 --> 45:36.460
That's great. Yeah, that also so that relates to, you know,

45:36.460 --> 45:39.660
a question I know is seeing coming from the audience as well.

45:39.660 --> 45:43.420
And so can you use this language in your remarks about Canadians

45:43.740 --> 45:48.300
seeing themselves in the frame or those those qualities of what the work is?

45:48.300 --> 45:49.380
And I'm curious if you can try.

45:49.380 --> 45:53.340
I know you were both speaking to the robust process of how you engaged

45:53.340 --> 45:56.060
and got feedback and real, you know, work to begin dialogue.

45:56.060 --> 46:00.700
But I'm hoping you can speak to what the level of awareness

46:00.700 --> 46:04.020
and active engagement is in terms of the quality of life framework

46:04.020 --> 46:07.260
or what you're hoping to see that evolve to for kind of the,

46:07.660 --> 46:10.980
you know, normal folks or the folks, you know, across the country

46:11.180 --> 46:14.580
in terms of their ownership or just their awareness of how that framework

46:14.580 --> 46:18.420
is connected to the resources or policies that are, you know,

46:18.420 --> 46:21.060
advancing from, you know, the government.

46:23.740 --> 46:26.740
Kerry, I'll start if that's OK.

46:27.620 --> 46:31.820
I it's a very interesting question, something that I didn't

46:32.780 --> 46:35.460
manage to get out of my presentations, how in some ways

46:35.460 --> 46:38.660
the quality of life file is very unusual for us.

46:38.780 --> 46:41.900
We are not normally this outside facing.

46:41.900 --> 46:46.700
We deal with we deal with the government and supporting the rest of government.

46:48.380 --> 46:51.940
And so I think this question is one that we maybe are still reflecting on

46:53.060 --> 46:55.780
in that we we want the we want the results.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.060
We want the outcomes.

46:57.060 --> 46:59.460
It is almost

46:59.460 --> 47:03.260
maybe the sacrilegious to to those who are closer to the well-being work.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.780
But if it doesn't, if it's not recognized as, you know,

47:07.900 --> 47:13.380
the fruits of the quality of life approach, that could be that could be OK.

47:14.180 --> 47:16.820
It is just that I think in our view, the socialization of the quality

47:16.820 --> 47:21.020
of life framework is an important piece to making sure it stays around

47:21.020 --> 47:24.180
and sets expectations so that the public, you know, demand that

47:24.260 --> 47:26.500
the quality of life outcomes.

47:26.500 --> 47:29.460
But you could end up in a place where the outcomes are achieved

47:30.340 --> 47:33.100
without everyone knowing about the framework.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.180
Yeah, I agree with that. Great point.

47:38.180 --> 47:40.660
Gary, anything to add?

47:40.660 --> 47:44.460
Yeah, I think this work has an element of participatory democracy

47:45.300 --> 47:48.740
and people come to it from a lot of different channels.

47:48.740 --> 47:53.460
And so we had a lot of these conversations early on, and people were starting from,

47:53.460 --> 47:56.620
you know, sometimes they're starting from a population group that of interest.

47:56.620 --> 47:59.420
Sometimes they're starting from the somatic area or what have you.

47:59.420 --> 48:02.780
And so there was, you know, hundreds, hundreds of conversations

48:02.780 --> 48:06.860
with people sort of having a slightly different version of of of their starting point.

48:07.180 --> 48:10.540
And so I think I saw Chris Barrington Lee here.

48:10.540 --> 48:13.540
So I'll give a shout out to work that he's been instrumental in leading,

48:13.820 --> 48:17.300
which is kind of coalescing a community of practice outside of government,

48:17.300 --> 48:20.980
of people, academics, well, actually government and outside of government.

48:21.500 --> 48:22.740
So similar to the structure.

48:22.740 --> 48:26.580
I think that you're building here that that that brings people

48:26.580 --> 48:29.100
into the same conversation with each other.

48:29.100 --> 48:33.380
And I think that's a really valuable contribution that it's, you know,

48:33.860 --> 48:36.180
people are having individual conversations with government,

48:36.180 --> 48:39.260
but it's really valuable for them to be talking together as well

48:39.460 --> 48:43.500
and moving to to to sort of, you know, identify there's going to be some differences,

48:43.500 --> 48:46.020
but also some shared areas of focus.

48:46.420 --> 48:51.700
And that's really valuable to us if we can sort of coalesce around that.

48:52.260 --> 48:54.020
Amazing. Thank you both.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.580
I know, given time, I'm going to hand back to Elizabeth.

48:56.580 --> 48:58.860
But just to say, you know, really appreciate your insights

48:58.860 --> 49:01.420
and reflections on that and a lot more to learn as we go forward.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.460
Thank you so much. Incredible nuts and bolts.

49:05.460 --> 49:07.500
There's so much that we could dig into here.

49:07.500 --> 49:11.100
And there were a number of questions that were coming up to about just kind of more

49:11.100 --> 49:14.380
granular level detail on the quality of measurement, the sort of,

49:14.740 --> 49:18.820
you know, the undergirding questions or data points within your five domains.

49:18.820 --> 49:23.260
And so I do want to remind the audience that we dropped a link to the Quality of Life Hub.

49:23.900 --> 49:27.700
When I first landed on this hub, I was totally blown away

49:27.980 --> 49:30.700
by how much you all have put forth as available to the public.

49:30.700 --> 49:32.860
And so I just want to thank you so much for that.

49:32.860 --> 49:35.900
And thank you for giving us some of the behind the scenes kind of deliberations

49:35.900 --> 49:38.900
and things that helped to really inform the development of all that.

49:39.540 --> 49:42.420
To close us out, I'm going to turn to three U.S.

49:42.420 --> 49:46.500
federal colleagues to just kind of quickly share some of the insights,

49:46.500 --> 49:50.420
what struck them within the context of the work that they're currently doing

49:50.700 --> 49:51.780
as part of this exchange.

49:51.780 --> 49:57.020
So I'm going to turn first to Shannon, then to Sunil and then to Danielle.

49:57.020 --> 50:00.420
So if you could quickly introduce yourself and share just a couple of minutes

50:01.260 --> 50:03.460
to help close us out. Thank you.

50:03.460 --> 50:04.780
Sure. I'm Dr.

50:04.780 --> 50:08.780
Shannon Aravisu, I'm a sociologist and I'm working as a senior advisor

50:08.780 --> 50:12.740
within the office of the chief data officer at the Department of Commerce.

50:13.100 --> 50:16.700
And one of the things that really struck me about your work

50:16.980 --> 50:21.060
is the fact that you have created a North Star for your country

50:21.060 --> 50:25.060
and that you started from first principles around what are the factors

50:25.060 --> 50:29.980
that contribute to national well-being, recognizing that there are many factors,

50:29.980 --> 50:33.140
not just government interventions and programs and policies

50:33.140 --> 50:34.300
that contribute to that well-being.

50:34.300 --> 50:38.260
And so the fact that you created that wide umbrella for so many different

50:38.300 --> 50:44.140
facets of society to fit into, I think, is something that is going to be

50:44.140 --> 50:46.420
hugely instrumental for your success.

50:46.420 --> 50:51.860
And I'm also noticing attention to, you know, change management principles

50:51.860 --> 50:56.060
and coalition building and recognizing that this, you know, to move this forward

50:56.060 --> 51:00.460
is going to require multiple sectors across society working together.

51:00.460 --> 51:04.340
And you provided a framework for businesses to fit in, for nonprofits to fit in.

51:05.340 --> 51:08.260
And I think that's really commendable and inspiring.

51:08.260 --> 51:15.820
I'm so excited to dig in more and also to see how we can evolve

51:15.820 --> 51:20.260
and adapt the current framework that Erin and McDonald and her team

51:20.260 --> 51:22.860
is implementing at the moment.

51:22.860 --> 51:26.060
So I'll pass it over to the rest of my federal government colleagues.

51:27.780 --> 51:29.180
Yes, thank you.

51:29.180 --> 51:33.060
So I'm Sunil Iyengar, director of the Office of Research and Analysis,

51:33.420 --> 51:37.540
very much concerned with metrics and research at the National Endowment for the Arts.

51:37.540 --> 51:42.860
And I'm just loving this discussion, resounding yes to everything Shannon said

51:42.860 --> 51:46.540
and Elizabeth have said in terms of praise of this framework,

51:46.540 --> 51:49.940
just why it resonates for us a quick minute.

51:49.940 --> 51:54.740
So beyond the GDP framework, the NEA actually partners with the U.S.

51:54.740 --> 51:58.220
Bureau of Economic Analysis to measure the arts contribution to GDP,

51:58.220 --> 52:01.100
as do a lot of countries and I think Canada as well.

52:01.100 --> 52:03.980
But we, too, have for years tried to really understand

52:03.980 --> 52:06.980
some of these other benefits of the arts.

52:06.980 --> 52:11.820
And we've we've done that through a couple of things I want to mention.

52:11.820 --> 52:13.740
I'll just say that we actually have worked with,

52:13.740 --> 52:16.900
have corresponded with our colleagues at Statistics Canada

52:16.900 --> 52:19.500
because there's a convention coming up this summer,

52:19.500 --> 52:22.260
the Association of Cultural Economics International.

52:22.260 --> 52:25.540
We're the first time they're actually including a well-being focus,

52:25.540 --> 52:26.220
health and well-being.

52:26.220 --> 52:30.260
So we've actually created a symposium to talk more about this work,

52:30.260 --> 52:33.300
arts and health and well-being measurement specifically.

52:33.300 --> 52:36.780
But, you know, I liked what what Kerry said about objective

52:36.780 --> 52:40.740
and subjective indicators flowing into each other, because let's just face it,

52:40.740 --> 52:44.420
we don't have a lot of hard data at this time, I would submit

52:45.500 --> 52:48.940
in terms of randomized control trials and that kind of those kinds of studies

52:48.940 --> 52:53.860
on the arts direct relationship and causality in terms of causality

52:53.860 --> 52:57.340
to some of the subjective well-being measures or some of the health measures

52:57.340 --> 52:59.540
we constantly talk about.

52:59.540 --> 53:02.460
So that's why we're trying to support research with other federal partners

53:02.460 --> 53:06.500
like the National Institutes of Health on psychology, neuroscience, medical research

53:07.100 --> 53:10.780
to support, you know, to get more of that data that you can then point to.

53:10.980 --> 53:14.580
But I love the fact that the framework you created, as is the equitable

53:14.580 --> 53:18.740
long term recovery resilience framework, is aspirational and starting

53:18.740 --> 53:24.540
really with the theory and what the grounded theory of what these outcome areas are.

53:24.780 --> 53:27.620
And then going in and hopefully having some extra data,

53:27.620 --> 53:30.100
but creating new data where it doesn't exist.

53:30.100 --> 53:33.900
So I'll just quickly say in closing that two aspects of the arts

53:33.900 --> 53:37.900
and I'd love to see the arts referenced more visibly in such frameworks,

53:38.780 --> 53:42.580
creativity and self-expression, which is an outcome area, which doesn't really

53:42.580 --> 53:45.100
may slip between the cracks sometimes when we talk about

53:45.300 --> 53:49.900
intermediate outcomes of well-being and, of course, social socialization.

53:49.900 --> 53:53.500
I know social exchange is a big part of your framework, too.

53:54.220 --> 53:57.700
But, you know, our Surgeon General just released a report, advisory

53:58.300 --> 54:01.900
health advisory for the first time on isolation and the dangers of loneliness

54:01.900 --> 54:04.700
and isolation, and we think the arts have a big role to play.

54:04.700 --> 54:08.260
So we'll be working with the equitable long term recovery resilience framework

54:08.260 --> 54:12.220
and hopefully do some more interagency working group efforts around arts,

54:12.420 --> 54:14.460
health and civic infrastructure.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.220
Thank you so much.

54:16.140 --> 54:19.620
And Sunil, it's the perfect segue, because in order to get to this arts

54:19.620 --> 54:21.620
and cultural, you need public transportation.

54:21.660 --> 54:24.700
So Danielle Nelson, I work at the US Department of Transportation,

54:24.700 --> 54:27.460
one of the nine modes, the federal trans administration.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.300
And I was just really pleased to see the quality of life framework,

54:30.300 --> 54:33.660
including under the environment sector, the walkable communities

54:33.660 --> 54:34.980
and access to public transit.

54:34.980 --> 54:38.620
And so we've been working very closely with our colleagues at Health

54:38.620 --> 54:42.100
Human Services through what's called the Coordinated Council on Access Mobility.

54:42.500 --> 54:46.900
It's a federal member council to improve human services, transportation access.

54:46.900 --> 54:48.980
So just pleasant to be here today.

54:48.980 --> 54:50.060
And I know we're short on time,

54:50.140 --> 54:52.820
so we'll just stop there and pass it back over.

54:52.820 --> 54:54.260
Thank you all so much.

54:54.260 --> 54:57.580
I think you you really helped to illustrate the breadth of learning

54:57.580 --> 54:59.500
that's possible through this kind of exchange.

54:59.500 --> 55:01.140
So thank you.

55:01.140 --> 55:02.860
And thanks to everyone who joined us today.

55:02.860 --> 55:05.500
We will follow up with a recording for your access.

55:05.500 --> 55:07.820
I know several folks were interested in that.

55:07.820 --> 55:11.940
And we also are going to share an invite to our next learning community call,

55:11.940 --> 55:13.660
which will be on June 20th.

55:13.660 --> 55:17.460
So with this learning community, what we're trying to do is sort of pop open

55:17.460 --> 55:20.900
the hood on state, local and federal policy initiatives

55:21.220 --> 55:23.260
that are designed to foster equitable well-being.

55:23.260 --> 55:24.620
