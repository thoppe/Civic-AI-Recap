WEBVTT

00:08.553 --> 00:13.017
Okay, the State Board will convene and we'll begin with the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:15.039 --> 00:26.709
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

00:29.451 --> 00:32.514
Okay, we'll begin today with the report of the superintendent.

00:36.621 --> 00:37.501
Thank you President Kurtz.

00:37.581 --> 00:38.201
Thank you members.

00:39.382 --> 00:39.842
Good day.

00:40.282 --> 00:41.442
It's a good California day, right?

00:42.602 --> 00:59.706
And I'm looking forward to today as we get another look at our ESSA plan and I just want to say at this point in the day, thank you to the great work of our teams, the California Department of Education team, the State Board of Education team,

01:00.595 --> 01:07.818
who have worked so diligently, so cooperatively and creatively, so hard to get the ESSA plan to where it is today.

01:07.898 --> 01:11.279
So we get another chance to discuss ESSA.

01:11.799 --> 01:14.400
Other updates from our last good meeting?

01:15.581 --> 01:17.321
One is an initiative I launched.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.402
We call it Global California 2030.

01:20.963 --> 01:24.304
We're still celebrating the amazing passage of Prop 58.

01:24.344 --> 01:25.244
73% of Californians agreed on something.

01:28.018 --> 01:32.419
They agreed that the antiquated barriers to bilingual education should be removed.

01:33.019 --> 01:45.842
They said yes to dual language capacity, and yes in realizing that we are in a fiercely competitive global economy, that the globe is continually shrinking.

01:47.042 --> 01:50.923
The interest and demand for dual immersion in language programs has skyrocketed.

01:52.173 --> 02:00.675
In May, I visited Coanga Elementary School in Los Angeles, and to a great example of a dual language school.

02:00.695 --> 02:02.315
This is a Korean immersion school.

02:03.096 --> 02:12.258
Again, looking how can we expand our language capacity in all of our schools in California in the way that Coanga School is doing currently.

02:13.118 --> 02:21.580
This is a wonderful example of where I believe all California schools should be going, expanding the teaching and learning of world languages.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.881
Our goal is to dramatically increase the number of students proficient in more than one language by 2030.

02:28.281 --> 02:43.125
I want to thank everyone who attended, including Monica Garcia, the chairwoman of the Los Angeles Unified School District, and Superintendent Austin Buechner, who endorsed Global California and committed to making LAUSD a strong partner in implementing the goals.

02:44.025 --> 02:51.808
Specifically, we want to have by 2030 half of all K-12 students participate in programs leading to proficiency in two or more languages.

02:52.768 --> 02:59.031
At least quadruple, we want to at least quadruple the number of students who receive the state seal of bioliteracy on their high school diplomas.

02:59.931 --> 03:06.256
demonstrating proficiency in more than one language, going from nearly 50,000, as it is today, to over 200,000.

03:06.356 --> 03:13.082
Our goal is to quadruple the number of dual immersion programs that teach languages besides English.

03:14.042 --> 03:16.925
And so, again, a lot of great work has been done.

03:16.965 --> 03:17.465
I want to thank

03:18.746 --> 03:21.747
Elena Fajardo and Veronica Aguilar and Tom Adams.

03:22.227 --> 03:23.888
I don't know if anybody any of them are here.

03:23.928 --> 03:43.016
Tom Adams is here It's his division who spearheaded this details of this plan and this initiative and I thank all of them and I want to thank the EL roadmap committee because they paved the way so to speak they paved the way for this initiative and for further public focus on the needs mostly

03:45.248 --> 03:47.349
Very much good news in the state budget.

03:48.610 --> 03:52.532
Legislature approved the budget with more than $78 million of Prop 98 funds.

03:53.272 --> 04:06.339
In the eight years of Governor Brown's administration, Proposition 98 has risen by $30 billion, and it's been driven, thankfully, by a recovering economy and voter-approved taxes and a keen focus on balancing the budget.

04:07.139 --> 04:15.421
Prop 98 per-pupil spending will reach about 11,600, up more than 4,600 from just eight years back.

04:17.101 --> 04:19.582
Then it was only 7,000 per-pupil, now it's 11,600.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.843
This is hugely significant progress.

04:23.363 --> 04:28.704
However, California still ranks 43rd in the nation in per-pupil spending, so we have some distance to go.

04:29.946 --> 04:37.793
The budget also makes nearly $83 million in investments in the state's new accountability system and capacity building within the statewide system of support.

04:38.054 --> 04:43.639
Thanks to all the advocacy here from President Kirst and your team and our team working together and working with the governor.

04:44.059 --> 04:48.664
This is a recognized need, the state system-wide support.

04:49.865 --> 04:54.029
Other education highlights include extending the career technical education incentive grants.

04:54.889 --> 05:00.774
creating partnerships between local businesses and schools to train students for high demand jobs.

05:01.434 --> 05:07.239
The budget also includes $300 million to help districts develop strategies to raise achievement for low-performing students.

05:08.079 --> 05:16.366
Another $125 million will go for teacher recruitment and training with a focus on special education, STEM, and bilingual teachers.

05:17.106 --> 05:17.527
There's also

05:19.027 --> 05:28.272
An area that I hold close as a very good priority is the classified school employees are amazing partners in schools day in and day out.

05:28.992 --> 05:33.594
This initiative, however, allows those who want to move forward to get a teaching credential.

05:33.634 --> 05:39.877
There's 45 million set aside so our classified employees can become teachers in the schools where they've worked.

05:40.817 --> 05:53.861
A budgetary that still needs working on, in my opinion, much work on over the rest of this session is funding for mental health, for intervention, counseling, professional development, to identify students with needs.

05:54.682 --> 06:07.806
Everywhere I travel up and down the state of California, speaking with teachers, speaking with students, speaking with administrators, speaking with parents, I hear increasing concerns surrounding the level of help available in counseling and professional development

06:08.466 --> 06:18.177
and the increasing concern about the number of students with depression struggling with the idea of suicide and homicidal anger.

06:19.038 --> 06:24.545
I hear this concern from teachers again around the state and three weeks ago I spoke in Washington, D.C.

06:24.605 --> 06:27.288
at the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention

06:27.928 --> 06:33.511
And we went over the horrific statistics of California that the federal CDC just came out with.

06:34.212 --> 06:39.435
45,000 deaths a year, Americans, mostly young Americans taking their lives.

06:40.635 --> 06:44.497
They reported a shocking 25% increase in the last two decades.

06:45.298 --> 06:52.882
So my staff has prepared, and I'll hand this out, a fact sheet on the mental health statistics and the challenges we face.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.384
And I urge us all to work together and invite any of you who want to help

06:56.985 --> 07:02.758
I formed a working group to bring all the agencies involved with mental health and suicide prevention together.

07:06.179 --> 07:09.141
Finally, a good report is an update on the Labor Management Institute.

07:10.101 --> 07:14.243
Another 30 school districts joined in the last couple of weeks.

07:15.303 --> 07:17.164
Over 270 people participated.

07:17.665 --> 07:20.326
It's been the goal to improve labor management relationships.

07:21.006 --> 07:26.749
A large number of schools have been involved over the course of the last five years.

07:27.009 --> 07:30.671
It's having a major positive impact on relations between labor and management.

07:31.931 --> 07:50.917
Finally, we're very proud of the special workshops and forums coordinated by our incredible employees here at CDC, creating real action in the spirit of inclusion to hold Black History Month, Latino Heritage Month, our first ever Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Disability Awareness Month, as well as our most recent, Pride Month.

07:51.757 --> 07:56.882
Stay tuned for the upcoming American Indian Heritage Week, commencing in the final week of September.

07:57.223 --> 08:04.029
And we have really meaningful workshops that take place and professional development for all of our staff and all of our guests.

08:04.689 --> 08:07.312
With that, I look forward to a good board meeting, Mr. President.

08:08.048 --> 08:10.410
Thank you for that comprehensive report.

08:11.511 --> 08:15.475
I have some announcements as is typical at the opening of the board meeting.

08:16.436 --> 08:23.522
First, I'd like to announce we have two University of California Center interns working at the state board office this summer.

08:24.562 --> 08:29.425
They're both here, and when I read through their bios, I'd like them to stand up.

08:29.585 --> 08:36.229
First is Ong Nguyen, who is supporting the work of the California Early Math Project through August 21st.

08:37.189 --> 08:50.297
He is completing his Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and International Relations at the University of California, San Diego, and he is an international student from Myanmar.

08:52.297 --> 08:59.659
Second is Julie Ann Mather is an incoming senior at UCLA where she is majoring in English.

09:00.599 --> 09:10.942
She is working with our communications director, Janet Weeks, to increase the state board's digital media presence through Facebook, Twitter, and our blog.

09:11.882 --> 09:19.904
And so she is also trying to raise the awareness of the California statewide system of support for schools and districts.

09:20.464 --> 09:26.529
She's from Lakeport, California, and they will both be with us into August.

09:27.510 --> 09:29.611
So both of them, you're here, stand up.

09:29.631 --> 09:32.233
There they are, okay.

09:38.055 --> 09:46.120
Finally, I'd like to say in preliminary remarks that this is our last board meeting with our student board member, Jaden Gray.

09:46.300 --> 09:50.863
And we appreciate his dedication and insights over the past year.

09:51.823 --> 10:00.349
And he is going to attend the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and study politics, philosophy, and economics.

10:00.389 --> 10:01.949
That's a very good combination.

10:03.410 --> 10:11.216
Would you please come up and I want to present you with something that we give to the outgoing student member.

10:13.157 --> 10:29.169
First a card, then we give you a certificate of appreciation and accommodation for your work in public service on the California State Board of Education.

10:40.979 --> 10:48.302
Okay, there is one addendum to our agenda today for item 14 related to charter school numbering.

10:49.683 --> 10:56.526
There are seven public school charter hearings on our agenda either today or tomorrow.

10:57.467 --> 11:00.830
Those are items 16 through 22.

11:00.950 --> 11:16.083
We have the regular consent items on our agenda and those regular consent items are 5 through 15 and the waiver items of W1 through W22.

11:19.426 --> 11:32.109
So, board members, any board members wishing to remove items from these proposed consent calendars should advise our executive director, Karen Staff-Walters, by 12 o'clock noon today, Wednesday.

11:33.930 --> 11:46.533
We also wanted to say to the board members that you got your electronic red folder with all the letters and communications to them.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.853
We'll be talking about that.

11:49.196 --> 11:49.676
today.

11:51.117 --> 11:55.518
And speakers, please sign up at the table just outside the room.

11:56.219 --> 11:59.640
Binders are on the table with separate pages for each number.

12:00.180 --> 12:05.362
And sign up on the page for each number that you want to speak on.

12:06.302 --> 12:13.105
There's a general public comment item, item 24, for items not specifically listed on the board's agenda.

12:14.345 --> 12:20.629
Individual speakers will be limited to one minute each for public comment for all items today on Wednesday.

12:21.290 --> 12:33.238
For item two only today, a group of five speakers may sign up together and designate one speaker who will be allocated a total of three minutes for the total group.

12:34.038 --> 12:38.321
If you wish to submit materials, please provide at least 25 copies.

12:39.963 --> 12:44.985
to Amy Bovico who's down there sitting in front at the desk there.

12:46.006 --> 13:00.672
Please introduce yourself if you are a speaker and identify what organization or whether you're introducing yourself to prepare and to represent before the board.

13:02.152 --> 13:07.254
And we have TV monitors for the meeting in room 1103.

13:09.362 --> 13:13.044
if we cannot accommodate the group at our board meeting.

13:13.804 --> 13:15.865
So those are my preliminary announcements.

13:15.985 --> 13:19.766
And so with no further ado, I think we're ready for item one.

13:20.506 --> 13:29.650
And we'll have first the presentation by CDE, by Cindy Kazanis.

13:30.310 --> 13:35.192
And then we'll have technical questions on each

13:36.272 --> 13:39.235
for each board member.

13:39.335 --> 13:45.259
And I think we'll have the technical questions on each of the items are different.

13:45.580 --> 13:54.627
And so at the end of each of the three items, we have the growth model, the safety net methodology and the English learner progress indicator.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.490
We'll have individual chances for technical questions.

13:58.570 --> 14:04.355
And after we're done with that, we'll, of course, have public testimony and then deliberate on where we want to go next.

14:04.535 --> 14:04.695
So

14:05.356 --> 14:07.538
Thank you, and open up the presentation.

14:08.219 --> 14:08.399
Great.

14:08.459 --> 14:12.843
Thank you very much, President Kirst and Superintendent Harlaxton, members of the board.

14:12.883 --> 14:16.787
My name is Cindy Kazanas, the director of the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division.

14:17.788 --> 14:25.355
Just like you were able to introduce some of your interns, I wanted to introduce the intern we have for the summer from Stanford University, Noemi Davila.

14:25.835 --> 14:27.236
If she could just stand for a moment.

14:28.357 --> 14:28.758
Welcome.

14:32.313 --> 14:38.399
And she is helping, this is, I think, our third year of the Stanford internship.

14:38.859 --> 14:43.563
And we've always had great luck with your students, remember Kirst and others.

14:43.644 --> 14:48.608
So she's helping us with building out this accountability system.

14:48.648 --> 14:53.873
So it's always nice to see a fresh face and maybe a future state employee.

14:54.033 --> 14:54.353
Who knows?

14:55.134 --> 14:55.454
Welcome.

14:56.475 --> 15:08.859
So as President Chris mentioned, this is a meaty item and as a result, similar to past practice, we will take a break after each one or pause rather for technical questions.

15:09.699 --> 15:16.622
So we do have three parts of our recommendation today that require action from you.

15:17.282 --> 15:18.605
We're requesting action from you rather.

15:18.705 --> 15:28.825
And then the last two attachments will be a brief update on the ongoing development of the California School Dashboard and our commitment to doing stakeholder outreach.

15:30.666 --> 15:39.089
Today you are going to see pieces of what we have put forward back in an April memo to you for our work plan.

15:39.769 --> 15:48.212
I'm happy to report that we are on track for meeting our deadlines for not only September but November and the release of the dashboard in December.

15:50.706 --> 15:57.850
Even with the hiccups in ESSA, we have been able to stay on focus with the state accountability system.

15:58.571 --> 16:03.154
But it has been quite a bit of excitement over the last 60 days.

16:03.194 --> 16:08.597
So you're going to hear a little bit about what we've been doing to get to this point and how we develop these recommendations.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.316
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Jenny Singh.

16:12.436 --> 16:26.237
I did want to mention that for this section of the item for the growth model, Educational Testing Services does have a technical expert here, so you can feel free to ask those kinds of questions if you have them as Jenny goes through the presentation.

16:31.789 --> 16:32.209
Thank you.

16:32.830 --> 16:35.592
Good morning, President Kurz, Superintendent Torlakson, and board members.

16:36.072 --> 16:43.477
Again, my name is Jenny Singh, and I'm here to present Attachment 1, incorporating a growth model into the dashboard.

16:43.858 --> 16:57.528
You may recall at the last meeting in May, we brought three growth models to you and asked you to select one growth model for us to study further, and you asked us to further explore the residual gain growth model.

16:58.348 --> 17:06.056
You also requested that the Educational Testing Services, or ETS, conduct some further analysis of the RG model.

17:06.236 --> 17:19.250
You may recall when they did their first analysis, we did not have the results from the 2017 Smarter Balance, so we wanted to go ahead and look at the 2017 data to make sure that the model performed consistently over time.

17:20.635 --> 17:28.399
And then you also requested the CDE staff to obtain additional feedback from stakeholders on incorporating the growth model into the dashboard.

17:28.960 --> 17:37.024
So I believe that we have done some extensive feedback from the field and from stakeholders.

17:39.266 --> 17:47.090
And then you also said that you had some questions, actually three questions that you wanted us to respond to at this meeting.

17:47.630 --> 17:50.112
So we're gonna go ahead and start with those three questions.

17:51.357 --> 17:55.678
So, you wanted to know what does the residual gain model tell us?

17:56.058 --> 18:10.803
You know, we're developing an accountability system and we think it's important that when we put in additional indicators that it provides us with the information that is going to be helpful to not only us, but to schools and districts.

18:11.563 --> 18:19.448
So, as you know, the residual gain provides growth for each student and student group with current and prior test scores.

18:20.368 --> 18:26.012
So, it only is for grades four through eight because grade three, of course, they don't have prior test scores.

18:26.932 --> 18:33.836
So, we're looking at a cohort of students from one year to the next and how they've grown.

18:35.277 --> 18:41.199
So, it tells us whether or not a student or a student group met the predicted test scores.

18:41.519 --> 18:49.382
And when I say student, I'm saying that as we're actually performing the analysis, because student group scores would not be going out.

18:49.482 --> 18:55.264
We would only produce school and student group scores to be posted on the web.

18:56.364 --> 18:58.685
So we can tell if they met their predicted test score.

18:59.625 --> 19:08.187
We can tell how far the students or student groups are below their predicted score or how far above their predicted score, right?

19:09.087 --> 19:17.789
And then we can tell whether a school or student group had high or low residual gain growth from the prior year to the current year.

19:18.189 --> 19:19.370
And that's subjective.

19:19.390 --> 19:24.431
You'd have to look at the growth statewide and make a determination on what you consider high and low growth.

19:27.341 --> 19:28.702
So what doesn't it tell us?

19:29.222 --> 19:36.185
Well, it doesn't tell us how far students or student groups who met their predicted targets are from level three.

19:36.625 --> 19:40.707
So many students can meet the predicted target and be below level three.

19:41.788 --> 19:44.189
Students can also meet their target and be above level three.

19:44.349 --> 19:47.050
But this residual gain model doesn't give us that information.

19:48.482 --> 19:50.784
doesn't tell us if the achievement gaps are closing.

19:50.804 --> 19:56.929
And it's my understanding that's an important component that we would like to see in our growth model.

19:57.489 --> 20:05.776
And it doesn't tell us whether meeting or exceeding the predicted targets indicates if a student is on track to proficiency.

20:09.403 --> 20:14.947
And you wanted to know, what does distance from level three change tell us?

20:15.848 --> 20:33.562
So we are using this methodology, and it does tell us, on average, the needed improvement for a school or student group to bring the average student to level three, or to the extent to which the student groups or school exceed level three.

20:34.503 --> 20:43.149
Now this change reflects the difference in how students in the current year performed on the Smarter Balanced assessment compared to the students in the prior year.

20:43.369 --> 20:44.650
So we're not looking at a cohort.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.812
Many of the students are the same, but some students are different.

20:48.453 --> 20:50.494
And that's really important to understand.

20:50.914 --> 20:54.397
So you get two different answers

20:56.277 --> 21:00.739
The growth model provides one set of information and the change provides another.

21:01.119 --> 21:03.619
Also important to understand that there are many growth models.

21:04.100 --> 21:08.281
They're all, and we're gonna use the same data set when we're producing growth model or change.

21:09.061 --> 21:14.543
And depending on the growth model that is selected, you will get a slightly different answer, right?

21:14.883 --> 21:16.043
It's telling you something different.

21:18.482 --> 21:21.063
So we wanted to look at change versus growth.

21:22.043 --> 21:33.086
I've actually, we've limited how much data we can put on the screen here, but I actually provided the full, all the data for all the student groups in ELA and math for you.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.447
You can look at that at your leisure.

21:35.467 --> 21:36.347
I'm sure you'll be thrilled.

21:38.068 --> 21:45.570
So what we wanted to do here is we wanted to really know the difference between change and growth and how it's gonna work in our model.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.611
Because we have a model that's already established.

21:48.271 --> 21:57.088
So, you can see here, important to note that when we're looking at the percent that's meeting the predicted target, really about 50% of all students

21:59.423 --> 22:04.048
and all student groups are meeting the predicted target.

22:04.108 --> 22:09.813
Now we know that would be true for the all student group because that's the way the residual gain model is designed.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.876
50% will meet it, 50% won't.

22:13.077 --> 22:17.261
We were a little surprised that that actually occurred for all student groups as well.

22:18.222 --> 22:20.864
The foster group is the one group that is a little bit low at 46.2%.

22:23.547 --> 22:35.077
Also wanted to point out that sometimes you can have a negative change in the DF3 and a positive change on the residual gain.

22:35.137 --> 22:36.919
You can see that with the white student group.

22:37.599 --> 22:39.381
And the reverse is also true.

22:39.821 --> 22:41.383
You can see that with the foster group.

22:41.783 --> 22:47.608
They had a positive distance from level three and a negative residual gain score.

22:52.367 --> 22:59.989
So we provided a memo in June that included the ETS updated analysis of the residual gain growth model.

23:01.029 --> 23:04.990
And they replicated many of the analysis that was provided in the April model.

23:06.090 --> 23:13.252
ETS used the statewide student level data to compare the 2015 and 16 RG results to the 2016-17 RG results.

23:19.440 --> 23:35.294
So some of the analysis conducted was the relationship with student demographic variables, important analysis, the correlation between the RG model and the relationship with grade configurations, the precision and or reliability of the RG model.

23:36.014 --> 23:42.039
And to no surprise to us, the findings were generally the same, statistically the same.

23:42.059 --> 23:43.581
This model has been around for a long time.

23:44.161 --> 23:46.183
We did not anticipate that it would be that different.

23:49.403 --> 23:55.988
They also compared the year-to-year growth outcomes and found low stability between years.

23:56.768 --> 23:59.270
So we were a little bit surprised with this finding.

23:59.930 --> 24:06.735
So for example, schools with high growth one year are likely to have low growth the following year and vice versa.

24:08.116 --> 24:14.220
So of course when they were presenting this to us, my first question was, do we pick the wrong model?

24:15.512 --> 24:25.117
And they said, well, we actually did this work for the change in distance to met and the conditional percentile rank of gain and found the same results.

24:27.259 --> 24:30.640
I'm not sure that made me feel better, but that's what they found.

24:32.429 --> 24:45.691
And they indicated that such high volatility can make it a little bit difficult for LEAs to use growth for driving decisions, as decisions made one year might be contradicted with the next year's growth data.

24:49.571 --> 24:54.635
And they also indicated that they did look at some data from another state.

24:55.015 --> 25:01.219
Because one of the questions I asked was, is this an issue with our scale scores?

25:01.319 --> 25:02.960
Is this causing it?

25:03.461 --> 25:09.325
And they said they actually had data from a large district in another state that wasn't Smarter Balanced data.

25:10.645 --> 25:12.687
And they got the same results using that data.

25:14.170 --> 25:25.855
And then there have been a couple of studies, and one study that they pointed out was one that was conducted on Nevada's growth model, and it also showed the same volatility in growth from year to year.

25:29.580 --> 25:32.842
So we had all this information, we wanted to take it out to stakeholders.

25:33.702 --> 25:40.626
So we presented, we had five different stakeholder sessions, and we actually conducted a webinar.

25:40.866 --> 25:44.048
In the webinar we had polling questions that people responded to.

25:44.068 --> 25:47.209
We had good attendance in the webinar, a little over 700 people.

25:47.229 --> 25:50.291
So there's a lot of interest and growth model out there.

25:50.651 --> 25:57.815
So all in all, we had presentations where we had about 1,000 individuals participating.

25:58.615 --> 26:01.878
We got feedback that was mixed.

26:02.878 --> 26:13.267
Some presentations we went to, the stakeholders indicated that distance from level three provided them with actionable information that they needed, and they really didn't see a need for a growth model.

26:15.279 --> 26:20.065
Other stakeholders said a growth model could provide additional and useful information.

26:21.287 --> 26:25.712
But they weren't sure that the RG model was going to provide them with the information they wanted.

26:26.193 --> 26:33.181
Because what they really want is they want to know if a student is scoring at a certain has a certain score, how much

26:34.215 --> 26:37.918
can they expect that student to grow from one year to the next?

26:38.679 --> 26:41.021
And of course our residual gain model does not do that.

26:41.842 --> 26:45.705
So that was a little surprising for us also.

26:46.146 --> 26:50.710
So we got a lot of great feedback and very useful information.

26:52.771 --> 27:01.258
So even though the residual gain has some volatility, it still can be useful in some ways, right?

27:01.859 --> 27:07.204
We could use the model to identify outliers for a case study if we so desire to do.

27:07.744 --> 27:19.254
So for example, we could identify schools that are in the fifth quintile in both 2016 and 17, which is approximately 7% of the schools, and we could do a study on that.

27:19.374 --> 27:20.295
So, I mean,

27:20.695 --> 27:26.890
Even though there is some volatility and growth, it still would be useful to identify outliers.

27:31.557 --> 27:42.803
So the recommendation, of course, from the department is to approve further study of the RG growth model using additional years of assessment data as it becomes available.

27:44.344 --> 27:58.492
Additionally, we are recommending not producing the RG results and posting it on the website because we think that there's a likelihood of causing quite a bit of confusion for schools and for districts.

27:59.412 --> 28:06.558
We do know that there are other states that are using growth models and they are using them for their accountability system.

28:06.938 --> 28:17.967
But we also know that other states, when they're using these growth models, they're actually, they're taking all of their indicators and they're combining them together for an overall score.

28:18.687 --> 28:38.799
So the impact of that growth model is much less on schools than the impact of the growth model when we put it in the dashboard because it would be a standalone, possibly could be a standalone component and it would have a much larger impact on the identification of schools and districts.

28:41.451 --> 28:50.215
Other considerations that we need to think about, it is possible that we may need to explore other growth models in order to provide schools and LEAs with the information that they have requested.

28:50.675 --> 29:00.000
I'm not sure there are models out there that would meet their request, but we certainly would want to further explore that.

29:00.740 --> 29:07.063
And in addition, it's important to know that ETS has completed their contracted scope of work related to growth models.

29:11.932 --> 29:13.053
So what are some next steps?

29:13.714 --> 29:22.002
So we definitely we want to continue to provide LEAs and school support on how to analyze their annual assessment results for the LCAP goals.

29:22.642 --> 29:26.406
I think the assessment office has done a great job in this area.

29:26.927 --> 29:34.974
They have, if you go to the CAPS website and you're looking at the data, there is a tab that you can do click on that shows change over time.

29:36.269 --> 29:47.120
So if you want to know about fourth graders, you can click on fourth graders and you can see how fourth graders performed in 2017 and how they performed as third graders in 2016.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.863
So that's very helpful.

29:50.183 --> 29:56.049
They're going to be, of course, adding another year of data so they have a three year trend that people can look at.

29:56.390 --> 29:57.451
That's available online.

29:57.771 --> 30:00.793
So it's available to stakeholders, to schools and LEAs.

30:01.753 --> 30:11.118
And they also developed a really nice report that complements that information.

30:11.519 --> 30:15.661
So what they've produced is they have an average change in scale score.

30:16.201 --> 30:19.382
by subject, grade, and scale score range.

30:19.882 --> 30:34.346
So for example, in math, if you have a student that scored between 2189 to 2200, you can see that the statewide average growth for students in those categories was a growth of like 99.9 points.

30:34.826 --> 30:39.267
So then you can tell if your school performed better or worse or about the same.

30:39.868 --> 30:44.509
So that's a nice addition that you can use with the report that's online.

30:45.409 --> 30:49.332
Also recall that we do have student score reports.

30:50.433 --> 30:55.236
And those are the score reports that go to parents and districts have this information as well.

30:55.316 --> 30:59.499
And those score reports do provide this current score and the prior score.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.740
So you can see the change over time.

31:02.120 --> 31:05.863
And that is really in essence a simple gain growth model.

31:06.583 --> 31:07.784
So we have that information.

31:07.844 --> 31:10.566
So there's a lot of things that have already been done.

31:10.986 --> 31:14.409
And I think that we can continue to provide support to the field in this area.

31:15.630 --> 31:28.560
We would also like to convene a series of meetings with growth model experts, LEA program experts, and stakeholders to obtain further public input on the purpose of the growth model in the accountability system.

31:29.581 --> 31:39.510
So we need to really determine what do we want from the growth model, and then how do we best incorporate that into the dashboard, and which model will meet that purpose.

31:43.453 --> 31:46.829
So with that, I will be happy to answer any questions.

31:47.813 --> 31:51.294
I just wanted to add a couple of context before we conclude.

31:52.194 --> 32:04.639
As Jenny mentioned a couple of times, we would not be able to have done all this work without the support of Michelle Senner and her staff of the assessment division, and of course the ETS contract that was invaluable over the last 18 to 24 months.

32:04.759 --> 32:14.322
And in fact, some of the analysis that they did with our data is something that I don't think that some of the letters that we saw understand

32:14.822 --> 32:17.404
the extent of that, and they don't have access to that data, right?

32:17.424 --> 32:26.831
This is a statewide data set that is unique, obviously, to California, and so we've been very fortunate to have that, be able to utilize that contract.

32:27.451 --> 32:36.478
We also have a very thoughtful process in California when we look at new items, and I wanted to just emphasize, I think Jenny sometimes underestimates what she does versus other states.

32:36.518 --> 32:41.021
When I went to Chicago a couple of months ago, they were telling us how to create a technical design group,

32:41.401 --> 32:42.142
That's really strange.

32:42.162 --> 32:55.958
We've had one for over like a decade or two decades So so there are other states out there that are really behind the ball and we have been fortunate in California to have a lot of expertise over the years going back to Bill Padilla and I'm sure others that I can't even remember and

32:56.278 --> 32:57.999
that have set us towards this path.

32:58.039 --> 33:04.400
And so that when we take something to you, we are confident that it is not only technically sound, but it's fair to schools and the districts.

33:04.481 --> 33:07.741
We don't want to bring something out that is confusing.

33:08.082 --> 33:15.844
In fact, on our technical design group, we have a couple of local educational agency representatives, and they are quick to tell us when something doesn't quite work for the field.

33:16.304 --> 33:31.773
So, in addition to that, one of the things I wanted to acknowledge was Michelle did provide us an opportunity to talk to the assessment technical group, the technical advisory group, and they were really helpful in talking about, you know, looking at assessments and how growth models work.

33:32.593 --> 33:37.016
And I think that there's an urgency out there from others to put something in place.

33:37.297 --> 33:40.699
And we want to, what we're saying today is we want to be thoughtful about it.

33:40.799 --> 33:42.400
We're committed to continuing to look at it.

33:42.520 --> 33:47.564
We have talked to national experts, but we are willing to, again, convene a series of meetings to get us

33:48.484 --> 33:49.365
across the finish line.

33:49.425 --> 33:50.945
It may take us a couple more years.

33:51.866 --> 33:54.187
What we have is working in California.

33:54.207 --> 33:56.168
That's what we heard from our local educational agencies.

33:56.188 --> 33:58.269
You saw that we talked to over a thousand people.

33:58.369 --> 34:03.832
We were astounded that we had on one webinar almost 800 LEA representatives at the end of May.

34:04.032 --> 34:10.415
So they were interested in what we had to provide and they gave us plenty of feedback on what we had to present.

34:11.555 --> 34:18.480
With that, I also wanted to acknowledge Jenny and Kimberly Mudhank, who did present last time, is on vacation or you would have seen her today.

34:19.020 --> 34:21.842
And their leadership has been terrific.

34:21.882 --> 34:24.564
And so just with that, we can open up technical questions.

34:24.664 --> 34:30.268
And again, like we said earlier, ETS is here to respond to those as well, if you have something for them.

34:32.429 --> 34:40.315
Okay, so we're going to have some technical questions now that we can

34:42.293 --> 34:46.215
then have public comment and move into more deliberations.

34:46.615 --> 34:50.717
Do you have information?

34:50.757 --> 34:54.779
One thing we get is all these other states have growth models.

34:55.859 --> 35:03.322
And if you do what I would like if we have it now or you could get it as to why they have them.

35:03.502 --> 35:09.605
Because the growth models are implemented in my recollection of history

35:10.485 --> 35:12.126
for teacher evaluation.

35:12.726 --> 35:20.169
And they were also used to secure federal waivers for under NCLB.

35:20.889 --> 35:23.651
And we're not talking here about teacher evaluation.

35:23.891 --> 35:29.653
By the way, a lot of the teacher evaluation things found the same things, volatility balance scores bouncing around.

35:30.353 --> 35:36.156
So, you know, there's an implication among the letters that we're behind

35:36.936 --> 35:46.261
But maybe we're not behind on this with other states because 40 states did it, but they, you know, they all had another reason for it.

35:46.441 --> 35:53.385
And it's not clear to me that it was the use for teacher evaluation was a resounding success.

35:53.465 --> 35:58.167
It appears to have been pretty much not very effective.

35:58.247 --> 36:04.731
So do you have knowledge on why the other states did this and what they're using them for?

36:06.738 --> 36:12.723
Well, I have knowledge on a few states from some meetings that we've been to, but not on all the states.

36:13.043 --> 36:17.527
So we would have to actually do a little more research on that and bring it back.

36:18.067 --> 36:20.289
The few states that I talked to, you're absolutely right.

36:20.369 --> 36:27.234
They had growth models in place that they received for teacher, that they built for teacher evaluation.

36:29.756 --> 36:36.162
And they just decided that they were going to transition those growth models into the new accountability system under ESSA.

36:36.662 --> 36:42.127
Like I said, that was only, you know, three or four states that I spoke with and I don't have information on the other states.

36:42.727 --> 36:45.630
Yeah, maybe we could look a little bit more broadly because

36:48.176 --> 36:53.578
We should do it because most other states have it, but they were doing it for something else.

36:53.658 --> 37:00.799
I think that would inform it because the allegation is we're really far behind and all of that sort of thing.

37:01.519 --> 37:09.041
And then the other question on your series of meetings, one question is not just for accountability in the dashboard, we want to understand this,

37:09.961 --> 37:15.308
But what's been raised is what decisions by what actors would a growth model inform?

37:15.769 --> 37:17.571
And that's more than accountability.

37:18.913 --> 37:26.162
And some of these growth models seem to be useful for local district information, but they would not be used in a

37:27.384 --> 37:29.405
perhaps in an accountability model.

37:29.505 --> 37:44.999
So I would think that, you know, the meetings you're talking about convening seem a little narrow to me in terms of that kind of a scope and just focusing on accountability and the dashboard.

37:45.980 --> 37:51.965
So is that what you, how did you think about the nature of the subjects for these meetings?

37:53.542 --> 37:57.389
I'm going to be honest, I haven't had a lot of time to think about them at this point.

37:58.331 --> 38:06.305
We have a lot of work to do between now and November, so I know that we won't be doing much until after the first of the year, but maybe Michelle can help us out.

38:08.662 --> 38:10.945
Michelle Center, Director of the Assessment Division.

38:11.926 --> 38:15.551
Of course, we're always happy to collaborate with our Accountability Division.

38:15.591 --> 38:18.675
I think that you've heard how we do that so well.

38:19.636 --> 38:23.200
I think that we're happy to engage in that conversation.

38:23.220 --> 38:26.645
I think that what is a little different in terms of

38:27.185 --> 38:35.131
looking at the assessment information for improving teaching and learning is that we've already for quite some time started that work.

38:35.191 --> 38:36.692
We've already started those workshops.

38:36.752 --> 38:37.833
We've started that training.

38:37.893 --> 38:39.054
We started that messaging.

38:39.094 --> 38:46.480
So we're in a very different spot than we are in terms of talking about growth for accountability.

38:47.680 --> 38:54.466
It would be interesting to engage in the conversation with individuals and also make sure that we are

38:55.631 --> 38:57.084
not creating confusion.

38:58.268 --> 39:01.551
by adding another way of looking at change.

39:02.992 --> 39:09.636
For those of you, for example, we just did a workshop called the data are in now what, right?

39:10.497 --> 39:13.459
Which is exactly that, looking at your data over time.

39:13.499 --> 39:14.519
What is that telling you?

39:14.579 --> 39:16.320
What questions might you have?

39:16.340 --> 39:18.822
And what actions might you want to take?

39:19.382 --> 39:27.488
And that's the kind of information that we support, which is really looking at multiple data points and not necessarily just looking at a growth model.

39:27.968 --> 39:29.708
but always happy to collaborate.

39:31.129 --> 39:31.869
Okay.

39:32.149 --> 39:32.929
Other board members?

39:33.389 --> 39:34.189
Board member Burr.

39:35.850 --> 39:38.930
So are we just asking technical questions?

39:38.950 --> 39:39.290
Yeah.

39:39.390 --> 39:42.491
Because I'd like to make a lot of policy statements here.

39:42.531 --> 39:57.254
But I appreciate, though, Michelle coming up because I think one thing that was really illuminating, Jenny, and I wanted you to kind of go over it again, and maybe this is at a later presentation, is what information is currently available to LEAs

39:57.754 --> 40:05.777
to teachers, to the members of the public about progress on test scores because that seems to be a little bit of a mystery.

40:05.797 --> 40:12.439
I would say I certainly wasn't aware of all of that because I don't get in there and look at all those different tabs.

40:12.879 --> 40:28.905
So I think just for purposes of communication, because to board member, to President Kerr's comment, I think what we're in a little bit of a conundrum here about who needs what information when to make the best decisions on behalf of students.

40:29.745 --> 40:35.008
and what level of information is gonna be helpful to make those kinds of decisions.

40:35.068 --> 40:55.659
So I would just ask that we have maybe a real joint presentation or a walkthrough again of what information is available, what kinds of training, that training that you just mentioned, Michelle, I think is fantastic that, again, putting that information in the hands of principals and teachers is the most important thing to me, and parents, of course.

40:56.139 --> 40:59.300
so that they can be making judgments about their students' success.

41:00.401 --> 41:12.006
What we do in terms of sending signals at the state level about what our expectations are, especially around equity and student growth of subgroups, is a different conversation, I think.

41:12.406 --> 41:17.268
And I think we're conflating the two here in a very technical way that makes us all go,

41:17.928 --> 41:20.289
Oh my God, what are we talking about here?

41:20.949 --> 41:28.232
So I think helping to understand that, again, in a way that's important to the people who are making the decisions would be helpful.

41:29.172 --> 41:41.276
Remember, Bre, I think that's a great idea, particularly the timing that we have with an upcoming release around fall-ish, where we can come back to you and talk to you about all the different data and information that we have out there.

41:42.256 --> 41:53.402
One thing that I'll mention as part of our training, we have this slide, and it really gets you thinking about what is a student trajectory look like.

41:53.962 --> 42:01.006
And for those of us that are parents or those of us who are teachers, you don't really expect that that progress in terms of learning

42:01.406 --> 42:03.607
is necessarily that straight line, do you?

42:04.167 --> 42:05.888
And you kind of expect that, and you recognize that.

42:05.928 --> 42:14.772
And that's OK when we have, from an assessment division, conversations with locals about expectations for students and about how you might inform teaching and learning.

42:15.312 --> 42:21.875
But that's a very different conversation when then you start putting accountability on that and expectations.

42:21.935 --> 42:25.997
So that volatility isn't necessarily something that is

42:27.558 --> 42:33.764
negative or unexpected or a portrayal that something is wrong in the assessment.

42:34.064 --> 42:37.508
But maybe it is something that we should have expected.

42:37.608 --> 42:38.489
Students grow.

42:38.549 --> 42:39.510
They have plateaus.

42:39.870 --> 42:42.112
Those are the normal things that happen in learning.

42:42.873 --> 42:51.441
And I think that we can have that conversation much easier when we're talking about improvements in teaching and learning than you can when you're talking about an accountability system.

42:52.413 --> 42:57.435
And if I could just add one other thing, because this is what scares me a little bit about this conversation.

42:57.576 --> 43:06.420
For the last four or five years, we have made a concerted effort to move away from making decisions based solely on test scores.

43:07.180 --> 43:10.802
And I feel the sucking motion pulling us back in that direction

43:11.622 --> 43:27.749
So I just want to, I also think the conversation, if it can be broadened to talk about a multiple measure system and does it make sense to have one model for a specific piece of that multiple measure system when we don't have it for the rest of those measures.

43:28.389 --> 43:34.593
So I just want to make sure we're always putting this into context because right now all we're talking about is a test score.

43:34.673 --> 43:36.894
And I think that's why it makes me nervous.

43:37.314 --> 43:41.037
I think it makes a lot of our experts on the technical design group nervous.

43:41.517 --> 43:50.222
And I think if you look at the research that President Kirst mentioned about some of the decisions that were being made based on these models, it didn't pan out.

43:50.842 --> 43:53.924
And so I don't want us to put all of our eggs in one basket.

43:55.825 --> 43:56.686
Board Member Strauss.

43:57.284 --> 44:06.657
So I have a several part question and really for clarification as we all grapple with I know we initially talked about wanting a growth model and that there were many states that were using it.

44:06.697 --> 44:13.867
But I know we're finding some challenges and I I read the letters and felt like we needed some more clarification because there's some different.

44:14.787 --> 44:16.829
conclusions, depending on who's writing to us.

44:16.869 --> 44:20.331
So, my first question, I have like three, so just timing.

44:21.332 --> 44:35.761
There were letters from stakeholders regarding CORE's growth model, and CORE's been talking to us for a long time about that, and I just wonder if you could talk, I think you've evaluated that, about the technical aspects of how they're doing that, so I'm

44:36.161 --> 44:46.445
kind of interested in any information that you have, particularly to that approach, because I think there's a question about how we approach it.

44:46.545 --> 44:49.866
And I'm very concerned about the volatility and what it will actually do for us.

44:49.966 --> 44:53.027
So could you just, that's the first part of my question.

44:53.087 --> 44:54.287
Do you have any information?

44:54.567 --> 44:55.948
Have you evaluated that at all?

44:56.624 --> 45:02.646
Yes, we have looked at the core model, and in fact, we had a meeting with some of the core staff around mid-June.

45:03.626 --> 45:10.488
Rick Miller, Noah Bookman, and Julie White attended, and they provided us with some detailed information about their model.

45:10.528 --> 45:18.831
We had a lot of information about it ahead of time, but they provided us with even more information, and it was very helpful to have that conversation with them.

45:19.751 --> 45:34.195
I think it did reinforce our desire to slow down a little bit and do a little more work in this area because the core model has different assumptions about a growth model than we do, right?

45:34.415 --> 45:41.697
So because they have different assumptions, clearly we're looking at it from two different aspects.

45:41.857 --> 45:47.379
And so I think it just reinforces the fact that we need to do a little more exploration on the growth models.

45:48.370 --> 45:52.011
Well, so I agree that we need to take our time.

45:52.032 --> 45:57.414
I really appreciated the input from the technical design group about unintended consequences.

45:57.634 --> 46:00.355
And I am particularly concerned about the volatility.

46:00.395 --> 46:05.997
But I don't want to put more numbers in without understanding why we're putting them in and for what purpose they serve.

46:06.918 --> 46:13.380
And I also think that we need to kind of build on what Member Burr was saying about how we explain it.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.141
Does it help inform teaching and learning?

46:15.261 --> 46:17.042
How do we explain it to our constituencies?

46:17.962 --> 46:24.204
And is the residual gain model, is that the best model?

46:25.305 --> 46:26.405
Or is there a better one?

46:26.725 --> 46:36.769
And so I guess I just wanna support that we need to take our time and I just support the TGE's recommendation that don't throw it away, but take some time and really further evaluate it.

46:37.089 --> 46:38.910
So I think those are my general comments.

46:41.431 --> 46:42.271
Board member Rucker.

46:45.609 --> 46:48.891
First of all, I want to thank you all for this work.

46:48.951 --> 46:53.674
This is very tough and very, very technical and difficult work.

46:53.814 --> 47:07.283
And in layman's terms, there are assumptions about what the data should be telling us or, better yet, how the data should be interpreted to tell us the things we want the data to be telling us.

47:07.843 --> 47:19.687
And that second point is where this discussion about the growth models fall in because people have used the growth model.

47:19.727 --> 47:23.949
The core model is not the only growth model that we've seen in this state.

47:23.989 --> 47:33.332
The other one that we've actually seen published was also published by the Los Angeles Times in their teacher evaluation model and we know that that blew up.

47:33.852 --> 47:49.823
And so my questions go to how these, particularly with the residual gains model, you pointed out that there are differences in assumptions about what the model does or differences in assumptions about how the model would operate.

47:50.243 --> 47:52.785
So my question is about those assumptions.

47:53.365 --> 47:58.129
In looking at, without asking you to tell me what the actual assumptions are,

48:00.390 --> 48:04.793
Because, you know, after the second sentence, frankly, my eyes will glaze over.

48:05.694 --> 48:20.085
But in looking at those assumptions and the differences, doesn't that also mean it changes the calculus on how the elements of the factors in the growth model are actually used?

48:20.165 --> 48:24.908
Is that one of the reasons why understanding the differences in those assumptions are important?

48:25.388 --> 48:26.009
That is correct.

48:26.337 --> 48:29.379
Okay, then my second, so I do understand this.

48:29.479 --> 48:53.354
All right, so then my second question is in looking at, without taking away these local models, both from the LA Times and from CORE, but looking at other states, and I'm gonna separate the question, looking at other Smarter Balanced states that have a growth model, and other states that have a growth model that are not using Smarter Balanced.

48:53.934 --> 48:58.396
There are Smarter Balanced states that also have an RG model.

48:58.856 --> 48:59.857
Is there a difference?

48:59.977 --> 49:02.058
And I understand that there were problems.

49:02.218 --> 49:10.362
The same problems that you discovered in the work that we did in this modeling in California became apparent in other states.

49:11.002 --> 49:23.168
My question is, in those other Smarter Balanced states, are there similarities or differences in the assumptions they had in developing or implementing their RG model that you're aware of?

49:24.371 --> 49:25.672
I do not have that information.

49:25.752 --> 49:26.072
Okay.

49:26.813 --> 49:39.501
And then for the state that you looked at that you said that was a non-smarter balance state that also had the RG model, was there a difference in the assumptions that their model had?

49:40.702 --> 49:43.704
So, ETS had the data from another state.

49:43.904 --> 49:47.547
And what they did is they took that same data and ran

49:49.097 --> 49:50.638
our RRG model with that data.

49:50.878 --> 49:51.198
Okay.

49:51.899 --> 49:52.179
Okay.

49:52.379 --> 50:00.283
And so then my last question is, as it relates to the issue of the volatility, I'm going to tell you now this question is not correct.

50:00.323 --> 50:05.805
I've been trying to figure out a way to ask this question and I still haven't figured out the correct way to ask it.

50:05.865 --> 50:10.548
So you may have to tell me I don't know and that probably is going to be the correct answer.

50:10.908 --> 50:17.411
For this issue of volatility, I know that right now when we look at the way our academic indicator has been developed,

50:17.851 --> 50:26.317
The issue of the distance from level three doesn't have that same fluctuation or volatility in it from grade to grade.

50:26.817 --> 50:30.620
That's a very stable report because of the way you've calculated it.

50:31.301 --> 50:37.365
Is there some way to control, and I'm using the word control on purpose,

50:37.805 --> 50:52.232
to control the way the volatility and the fluctuation volatility works either from year to year or grade to grade as you're following to try to figure out how to do the comparison of this year with last year.

50:52.412 --> 50:56.994
Are there ways that you can do the calculus to control that volatility?

50:57.755 --> 50:59.235
I'm sure there are.

50:59.255 --> 51:01.476
That's what we want to further explore.

51:01.536 --> 51:06.919
But if you want more technical information, we do have someone from ETS who could maybe respond to that.

51:07.651 --> 51:17.498
Maybe not today, but maybe for a future meeting, because that is something I'm very interested in, having read the memo, the information memo that you put out.

51:18.218 --> 51:23.882
My eyes really did fall on and study and study again the explanation about the volatility.

51:24.282 --> 51:41.233
So I am very interested in trying to understand that not as a comparison on how other RG models work, but as a way of understanding whether ultimately a decision is made to use any kind of growth model because I agree with my colleagues.

51:41.713 --> 51:50.806
that the data we're getting right now based on the chart that you gave us, it's not really, it doesn't have any value added for the kind of reporting we're looking for.

51:51.327 --> 51:57.155
But the perception is still there that if California doesn't have a growth model, there's something missing.

51:57.635 --> 52:04.660
in the discussion of our accountability picture because there is still this great expectation about what numbers are supposed to tell us.

52:05.221 --> 52:09.704
And the fact is those numbers don't do that even if we want to have that conversation.

52:09.744 --> 52:11.866
That's a conversation for a different day.

52:11.886 --> 52:21.913
But on the technical side, I really want to make sure we have exhausted the type of technical analysis to determine whether or not we're truly getting any

52:22.686 --> 52:32.809
valuable information that is distinct or distinguishable from what we are currently getting in the dashboard data that's currently being reported.

52:33.190 --> 52:51.036
So I agree with board member Super in saying that we should probably have another update or at least another review about what's actually being reported in the dashboard so we can understand whether or not a growth model has anything else that it can add to the data we're already getting.

52:51.676 --> 52:52.036
Thank you.

52:53.445 --> 52:54.073
Board Member Sun.

52:56.229 --> 53:03.512
So I have very brief technical questions and then probably a little bit more policy-ish statement around this.

53:03.552 --> 53:07.373
So first of all, I do appreciate all the work that you guys have done on this.

53:08.293 --> 53:14.015
The promise of a growth model has been around even prior to LCFF, right?

53:14.035 --> 53:24.879
It was part of PSAA and I get that it has become this holy grail of accountability that we've looked up to and then we're always searching for it and going after it.

53:25.419 --> 53:39.027
So I get that, and I think that it's kind of become something that we just continue to search for, but not really step back and ask the questions, well, why are we actually looking for this?

53:39.587 --> 53:42.969
So I was super disappointed, as you know.

53:43.769 --> 53:49.812
that we have a failure to launch on this particular model that you've done so much work on.

53:50.753 --> 54:02.859
However, I think that stepping two steps back is a good idea, convening the stakeholder group to really discuss why we want this, what information we actually do want.

54:04.339 --> 54:05.539
But I don't want to give up on it.

54:06.139 --> 54:16.241
And so I do appreciate the recommendation with very specific next steps that is about continuing to research and continuing to move forward with it.

54:17.461 --> 54:24.843
You had asked, Jenny, you had stated several things that the current data or the model does not tell us.

54:25.483 --> 54:27.903
Is that because we don't have enough data?

54:28.483 --> 54:32.644
Or is it that even as much data as we can collect, it still won't tell us

54:33.846 --> 54:36.488
It won't, it will never tell us that information.

54:36.508 --> 54:37.949
Okay, it will never tell us that information.

54:38.009 --> 54:44.314
So that says that we really do need to take two giant steps back and really look and ask those questions of why we're doing it.

54:45.936 --> 54:59.186
The other piece is, while I also appreciate that we are not looking at test scores as the only, as a measure and trying to super emphasize test scores, I do think that with all of the

55:00.707 --> 55:19.418
the time and the development of the tests that we have and that it does measure standards, that I would like to see something that looks at the test score results in a different way than what we currently have with the status and growth model that we have.

55:20.038 --> 55:28.503
So whether it gets emphasized or not, I do think that we need to look at that kind of data through different lenses.

55:31.294 --> 55:32.354
That's my thing.

55:32.374 --> 55:33.434
Okay, Board Member Valdez.

55:39.436 --> 55:40.316
First of all, thank you.

55:40.456 --> 55:44.676
I know this has been a journey and we're so proud to have all of you leading our journey, so we appreciate that.

55:44.716 --> 55:45.937
We know it's not a linear journey.

55:45.957 --> 55:47.657
The road is like up and down, right?

55:48.717 --> 55:56.839
And so again, from my lens, being within a district and living this day-to-day, meeting with 80 administrators next week and really thinking about all of this, how do we roll it out?

55:57.059 --> 55:58.179
What are the conversations?

55:58.659 --> 56:13.872
And so my question really centers around, first of all, I wanna say that having clarity is so important and so to not cause confusion, it's so wise to hold off to make sure that when we do have a growth model, because I think we want a growth model.

56:13.892 --> 56:23.380
I don't think anyone would say we don't need a growth model, but we want it to be clear and we want it to work because the growth model should be integrated into this system.

56:24.080 --> 56:24.780
and it should work.

56:25.161 --> 56:39.188
So my question is, as we think about teaching and learning and all of the assessment and accountability, how does this help in the leading and lagging indicator questions that districts have in terms of moving forward, if that makes sense?

56:39.588 --> 56:49.993
So as you're looking at it, we know that it's lagging data, if you will, when it comes to us, but is there an opportunity to begin to think about in that multiple measures concept

56:50.493 --> 56:56.777
that the leading, we can help in that leading indicator data along the route, if that makes sense.

56:56.797 --> 57:16.669
So it's an open-ended question, but it's just something to think about, because from a consumer level, that's really what's gonna make the difference, because yesterday's over, the test is done, that was last year, but as we move forward, and we think about leading indicators, or could we use some of this data to be leading, I guess, is one of the questions I'm asking in a open-ended way.

57:18.545 --> 57:23.150
I think it would be very difficult to use a growth model in that way.

57:23.370 --> 57:32.158
But, of course, our assessment office, I don't know if Michelle wants to address the fact that there are data elements that can be used on an ongoing basis.

57:39.417 --> 57:47.201
I guess I got confused because I wasn't sure if you were suggesting that the growth model be used as that way or recognizing that it can't be used in that way.

57:48.561 --> 57:55.205
So we do, of course, have many resources that are available that can be used as leading indicators.

57:56.605 --> 58:13.432
Many of those are resources that we provide for formative assessment purposes and trainings that we do so that people will know prior to even giving the test, let alone getting the results back, how students are performing relative to our state standards.

58:13.952 --> 58:16.134
So that's the type of information we have.

58:16.194 --> 58:28.144
I'm not sure that that completely meets your need if what you're suggesting is you have that information on a real systematic school-wide type of approach.

58:28.584 --> 58:39.233
If so, we do know of some schools and districts that really are trying to utilize our interim assessments in that way to varying levels of success.

58:40.474 --> 58:43.196
But that's another way of getting that leading information.

58:44.141 --> 58:45.862
So those are the models that we're looking for.

58:45.942 --> 58:49.984
So how are other and I know that this is all so it's tying everything together.

58:50.044 --> 58:50.725
It's the interim.

58:50.825 --> 58:52.025
It's the growth model.

58:52.165 --> 58:54.887
It's distance from that all of that.

58:54.947 --> 58:57.689
How does that really come together in a comprehensive way.

58:57.749 --> 59:00.070
That's just the messaging that would be really really helpful.

59:00.630 --> 59:00.970
Thank you.

59:04.973 --> 59:07.394
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

59:08.527 --> 59:12.348
I apologize for missing the presentation, but I had a flight delay.

59:13.588 --> 59:17.989
And my question is not technical, but it's very policy.

59:18.009 --> 59:28.312
You know, I know that board member Sanchez mentioned or referenced how long this conversation has taken place and it definitely predates me.

59:28.852 --> 59:32.093
But my world in Sacramento started in 2015.

59:32.393 --> 59:36.594
And this conversation started with the idea that we were adopting the Alberta model.

59:37.174 --> 59:40.818
for the accountability system, which was based on averages.

59:41.018 --> 59:46.203
And averages could lose a lot of information as it relates to performance of subgroups.

59:46.563 --> 59:53.190
And in particular, students whose information may seem like they're doing better than they actually are or lower than they actually are.

59:53.710 --> 01:00:03.556
And so I remember President Kurz mentioned, we really ought to measure, find a methodology that helps us measure, are we making gains towards narrowing achievement gaps?

01:00:03.696 --> 01:00:05.837
And that's how this conversation got started.

01:00:06.337 --> 01:00:18.164
So that's a conversation that I wanna have because when I saw the meeting from May that I missed, I believe that board member Sun was really the only one that focused on, are we narrowing achievement gaps?

01:00:18.184 --> 01:00:19.324
What does this mean for equity?

01:00:19.344 --> 01:00:20.465
What does it mean for subgroups?

01:00:20.965 --> 01:00:26.470
And so I understand why at this point we need to take a pause and really revisit what we have.

01:00:26.971 --> 01:00:37.941
But I also think that not putting a timeline for when we will actually come back with something that could be incorporated into the dashboard makes it seem like someday, one day.

01:00:39.722 --> 01:00:41.544
someday doesn't exist on our calendars, right?

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:44.786
I want to see something more concrete.

01:00:45.266 --> 01:00:47.768
I know that there's many states that are doing this.

01:00:47.889 --> 01:00:59.358
It may be different, but I think that we need to start opening up, and I'm excited to see that we have here something about future meetings with growth model experts.

01:00:59.918 --> 01:01:06.143
Even if CORE is not what we're looking for because of the agreements that we have, maybe we need to change the agreements of our assumptions.

01:01:07.204 --> 01:01:09.547
But I think that we need to bring some of those experts.

01:01:09.807 --> 01:01:15.273
USC, Harvard, we received a letter from academics and researchers that are happy to help.

01:01:15.713 --> 01:01:16.854
We should be tapping into them.

01:01:16.915 --> 01:01:18.056
Children now send a letter.

01:01:18.096 --> 01:01:19.077
They seem very knowledgeable.

01:01:19.437 --> 01:01:25.464
There's a lot of people that have the technical expertise that we may not have, and maybe we don't agree with what they're presenting.

01:01:25.524 --> 01:01:27.186
It may not be the model that we're looking for.

01:01:27.706 --> 01:01:44.909
But I think that having an open-ended timeline that doesn't really tell us when is this coming back to the board, when is it 2019 that we hope to have it in the dashboard, 2020, even though that seems like a faraway timeline for most of us that have been waiting for this, at least it's a timeline.

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:52.511
So I'm a little uncomfortable with the fact that we don't have set dates, that we don't have a sense of when this will actually be incorporated.

01:01:56.072 --> 01:01:56.983
Yeah, go ahead.

01:01:57.003 --> 01:01:57.671
Do you want to respond?

01:01:57.691 --> 01:01:57.813
Yeah.

01:01:59.026 --> 01:02:04.749
I just would say that you're going to hear something similar with, I think, the English Learner Progress Indicator.

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:18.257
And so we will regroup and figure out if we can bring you something back, either in a memo between the meetings about sort of a three-year plan for accountability, because we haven't been able to take a breath.

01:02:18.477 --> 01:02:26.322
And we probably need to just take a pause and figure out the next couple of 24 months, 36 months, what does it look like?

01:02:27.182 --> 01:02:34.825
We had given you a six-month timeline or an eight-month timeline back in April, and obviously you're now, you're thinking much further ahead, so.

01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:40.567
Can you scroll back, board member Ortiz-Lacombe wasn't here, back to what it can't tell you.

01:02:41.147 --> 01:02:42.047
You had something.

01:02:43.468 --> 01:02:46.689
Yeah, if achievement gaps are closing, right there.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.318
Yeah.

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:58.448
So I mean, I came into this thinking it might help us with this.

01:02:58.828 --> 01:03:01.831
So I think that's very, very interesting.

01:03:02.071 --> 01:03:07.457
And you confirmed that none of them really do that.

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:14.463
So yeah, I just wanted to make sure you were aware of that.

01:03:15.184 --> 01:03:17.006
I read the memo, and I read the item.

01:03:17.807 --> 01:03:23.594
And so maybe we're not looking at the right model, but I do think that that's why we need to see what other models are working there.

01:03:24.014 --> 01:03:26.457
Texas has the narrowing achievement gap domain.

01:03:27.398 --> 01:03:34.043
typically not one to reference Texas for things, but in this case, you know, they are looking at something similar.

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:41.269
And so let's see what's out there, but maybe diversify the group of folks that are advising us so that we could get there a little faster.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.950
Thanks.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:43.191
Yeah.

01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:52.058
Could you comment on, you know, what was really prominent in the EdSource article yesterday, that the way we're doing it now

01:03:53.631 --> 01:04:01.094
where we're using student groups and there's people moving in and out of these student groups has significant technical problems.

01:04:01.974 --> 01:04:20.140
So that are, you know, what is implied there by some experts, end quote, is that the way we're doing it now is really under the change model has real limitations and then the implication is there

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.641
the growth model might fill in for some of those problems.

01:04:23.721 --> 01:04:32.283
So... So regardless of what model you use, whether it's the change model or the growth model, there are implications on both of them.

01:04:32.383 --> 01:04:35.484
Neither one of them are perfect, as we can see.

01:04:35.924 --> 01:04:44.187
You may recall that last November, November 2017, we had to come back to the board to revise our 5x5 grid.

01:04:45.347 --> 01:04:53.737
And we had to revise that five by five grid because we noticed that there was some there was volatility and we wanted to control for that volatility.

01:04:54.318 --> 01:05:04.089
And so we made sure we had about 15 percent of the schools who would have gone down to at least two performance levels if we did nothing.

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.930
So.

01:05:05.831 --> 01:05:10.455
We were well aware that there was some volatility in our change model.

01:05:10.676 --> 01:05:14.399
We took, I think, the appropriate steps to control for that.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.406
And I think the field is very happy with our academic indicator.

01:05:22.466 --> 01:05:25.529
They seem to think it provides them with useful information.

01:05:25.569 --> 01:05:27.111
They're using it on a regular basis.

01:05:27.931 --> 01:05:30.274
It did take them a little bit of time to adjust.

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:51.453
To to our five by fives and to the you know, the way we were calculating the academic indicator, but I think it I I think that the tdg has provided us with very good guidance and I I think that our academic indicator provides the information that schools and leas can use

01:05:52.405 --> 01:05:59.108
Well, but the criticism was that students migrate in and out of schools and move around.

01:05:59.128 --> 01:06:01.489
As I understand it, I may not have this right.

01:06:01.929 --> 01:06:05.471
And therefore, the way we're doing it has technical errors.

01:06:05.591 --> 01:06:08.612
And it wasn't volatility, as I understood this criticism.

01:06:09.444 --> 01:06:10.025
That is true.

01:06:10.125 --> 01:06:11.846
Students do move in and out of schools.

01:06:11.887 --> 01:06:14.729
That's the difference between the change versus the growth.

01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:20.755
The growth, you're looking at students who had a score from the prior year.

01:06:21.115 --> 01:06:30.004
Recall that we do not put anyone in our model unless they've been at the school for a complete academic year, from fall census day to the first day of testing.

01:06:32.819 --> 01:06:34.560
Yes, students go in and out of schools.

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:41.742
When you're looking at a K-8 school, you're going to have new third graders every year, and your eighth graders are going to leave.

01:06:42.402 --> 01:06:44.862
But a lot of the students are the same.

01:06:44.942 --> 01:06:49.364
So there are some differences, but there's a lot of students that are the same.

01:06:50.004 --> 01:06:58.506
So yes, there are issues with that, but I think our technical design group has addressed them the best that we can with the model that we have.

01:06:58.606 --> 01:07:00.767
With the residual growth model.

01:07:01.989 --> 01:07:02.369
Okay.

01:07:02.749 --> 01:07:05.170
Board Member Berg.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:14.051
So I think it would be helpful, again, as we're going forward, to talk about the value of a cohort model for what purposes.

01:07:14.311 --> 01:07:28.954
Again, does it make sense at the state level to send signals versus an individual student growth model, which you need at the LEA level in order to make judgments about every student that you're trying to serve, every subgroup you're trying to serve.

01:07:29.654 --> 01:07:38.982
Because I'll say to go along with board member Sung's comments, I've been around a long time on this issue since 1992.

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:46.688
And when the API was created, our technical design group said a cohort model works at the state level.

01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:53.473
Because when you aggregate all these students, the transiency, it's kind of noise in the system.

01:07:53.733 --> 01:07:57.315
And for purposes of sending signals at the state level, it's okay.

01:07:57.916 --> 01:08:04.881
So I think it is important to distinguish between the cohort model versus individual student growth model.

01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:09.484
And at what level you need that information, again, in order to make decisions.

01:08:09.584 --> 01:08:12.887
Because I agree with Member Kirsten, I'm a little bit...

01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:27.913
Concerned about people saying well, it's flawed because you're not using individual student growth when in fact There are purposes for a cohort model that may make sense on a policy basis So I think we need to again as we're moving forward.

01:08:28.053 --> 01:08:34.538
I would appreciate if we could sort of sort through some of those issues To make a reasoned decision.

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:35.019
Thanks

01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:50.272
I think the same letter that President Chris referenced also had a statement that I wanted to make sure that folks saw that said that growth to proficiency actually conveys very similar information to the state's status measure, distance from level three, which is not desirable for measuring the effectiveness of schools.

01:08:53.774 --> 01:08:54.775
There's a lot of confusion.

01:08:54.915 --> 01:09:19.749
There's a lot of controversy and in fact one of the people who signed the letter from the researchers co-authored the study in which one of our Researchers who authored our study the original study together that we talked about that's from like four or five years ago that all the states were using and so even even in academia they have disagreements Okay board member Rucker

01:09:22.102 --> 01:09:39.729
Okay, so I want to thank you for going back to what the board did last fall to make adjustments on the dashboard because that was related to my question about what can you control to make adjustments on the way this growth model would work.

01:09:40.449 --> 01:09:44.991
When the adjustments on the 5x5 grid were made,

01:09:45.931 --> 01:10:02.738
My perception at the time when the board took that action is that there was a clear issue that you understood what the volatility was related to and you had come up with a model or a proposal to address and correct that volatility.

01:10:02.778 --> 01:10:08.180
In other words, we knew where the problem was and we knew how to adjust or to make that fix.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:14.322
So my question related to controlling for the volatility, and you know where I'm going on this,

01:10:14.822 --> 01:10:29.948
on this growth model is, you know, is there a way to understand why there's this fluctuation or volatility that can define or suggest solutions for correcting or controlling forward?

01:10:30.508 --> 01:10:39.512
I'm not sure that's apparent yet because it seems to be different from year to year what the issues may actually be.

01:10:39.952 --> 01:10:42.353
And so that's the reason why I today am happy

01:10:42.873 --> 01:10:53.017
to continue living with the question because we don't know in the same way that we knew or understood what was going on with our dashboard.

01:10:54.158 --> 01:11:00.341
And I also read the EdSource article and I'm concerned for the same reason that board member Burr brought up.

01:11:00.781 --> 01:11:10.145
There's a difference in what we at the state level need the growth model to tell us about the performance of schools and subgroups.

01:11:10.785 --> 01:11:19.972
But there's a different, more granular need for what a growth model or any kind of school data report is needed at the school level.

01:11:20.413 --> 01:11:32.562
And so in this conversation about a growth model, a single model is not going to address both statewide and more granular district or school level needs.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:38.707
And so I think that in the conversation that a lot of people have been writing about,

01:11:39.247 --> 01:11:48.036
they are conflating the work of a single report to cover both broader and more granular needs.

01:11:48.076 --> 01:11:55.063
And that was more, I apologize, because that was more a policy observation than a real technical observation.

01:11:55.603 --> 01:12:14.540
But it's very important to understand that that's in all of the letters that I saw and in the report that was in EdSource, there seems to be missing that there is a distinct difference in what is reported or what is needed to be reported at the state level and more granularly.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.700
at the school site or local level.

01:12:17.441 --> 01:12:23.542
And then I have not been at this as long as a lot of other people have.

01:12:23.582 --> 01:12:26.423
So, I'm not going to pretend I have this level of expertise.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:29.964
But I was a classroom teacher when the API was implemented.

01:12:30.424 --> 01:12:36.905
And the thing that offended me that everybody else was touting as the API being the end all and be all.

01:12:37.306 --> 01:12:38.526
Okay, let me change.

01:12:38.546 --> 01:12:39.086
Let me stop.

01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:44.632
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

01:12:45.512 --> 01:13:06.302
It was never a good idea, even at the time, because there was, when the API was created, a large and allowable performance gap among student subgroups so that schools got credit for growth and making gains, even if African-American students were as far as 100 points behind.

01:13:08.163 --> 01:13:09.023
the leading group.

01:13:09.484 --> 01:13:21.168
So it was never a good idea, and it never addressed closing the achievement gap if you create a system that allowed that kind of large performance gap.

01:13:21.648 --> 01:13:34.373
So it may have been touted as a great idea, but this was one African-American classroom teacher who never thought it was, because you created a performance and achievement gap in the accountability system that was approved.

01:13:34.913 --> 01:13:36.214
So that's all I'm going to say about that.

01:13:38.112 --> 01:13:44.697
Okay, I think we're now ready for the second presentation.

01:13:46.098 --> 01:13:46.298
Great.

01:13:46.418 --> 01:13:54.784
So the attachment two is picking up from where we left off last September, in which you approved safety net methodology.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:59.727
And that was just for two indicators, the graduation rate and the suspension rate.

01:14:00.428 --> 01:14:04.650
And again, just to keep in mind, this is for groups that there are 30 to 149 students.

01:14:07.052 --> 01:14:20.964
And the reason that we had presented and you ultimately approved this idea was because we were seeing large swings in data triggered by the results of few students for this group of students.

01:14:21.444 --> 01:14:33.454
So with bringing this to you in September of last year, we committed actually in March and you asked us to move forward with looking at it at the student group level for these two indicators.

01:14:34.071 --> 01:14:45.382
So just as a refresher, what this methodology does is it removes the far left column, which has declined significantly, and the far right column, which has increased significantly.

01:14:45.402 --> 01:14:49.766
So we've created a 3 by 5 grid for just this purpose.

01:14:55.492 --> 01:15:00.459
So what we're recommending is that this be applied to the graduation rate and suspension rate indicators for all students.

01:15:00.579 --> 01:15:01.661
We've done the simulations.

01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:10.113
We were able to take the time this spring to look at it, to obtain stakeholder input on it, as well as make sure that it was technically sound.

01:15:11.916 --> 01:15:15.481
This is the impact on student groups for the graduation rate indicator.

01:15:15.762 --> 01:15:26.175
You see just over, just rather close to 8% of schools affected by this removal of the two columns and moving to a three by five grid.

01:15:26.696 --> 01:15:31.700
You see about 3% moving from a red color to an orange color.

01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.742
Again, these are student groups.

01:15:34.522 --> 01:15:39.846
And for orange to red, so again, moving up just under about a half percent.

01:15:40.347 --> 01:15:45.270
And then taking a step down from blue to green is just a little over 4%.

01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:53.717
So we also provided you the race and ethnicity information in the board item, which is in table two for this attachment.

01:15:54.980 --> 01:16:01.523
The same holds true, or similar pieces hold true for the suspension rate indicator, although it's significantly less.

01:16:01.563 --> 01:16:05.724
So we're just down to about 5% of schools, or rather student groups, being affected.

01:16:06.605 --> 01:16:09.806
So this is, if you're following along in the item, it's Table 3.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:12.407
And then Table 4 looks at race and ethnicity.

01:16:12.827 --> 01:16:17.849
So just to go through the table from red to orange, again moving up, we see about almost 3%

01:16:19.210 --> 01:16:19.970
impact on that.

01:16:20.371 --> 01:16:44.962
Moving up again between orange and yellow less than 1% only 12 student groups and taking a step down between yellow and orange is 2.1% and between blue and green less than 1% so you can see by the total number or by the note changes how many student groups we have in California when we look at individual schools so this is

01:16:46.343 --> 01:16:56.033
This is impactful data, and we did get a tremendous amount of support from our LCFF stakeholder group, at least acknowledgment that this was a good idea to move forward with.

01:16:56.434 --> 01:17:01.399
And keep in mind that is made up of education, advocacy, and the equity groups do attend.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.543
And then we also presented this, rather Jenny presented this.

01:17:06.224 --> 01:17:09.428
not here, to the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

01:17:10.048 --> 01:17:12.651
And they always have something to say.

01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:15.795
And sometimes they tell us what we're doing isn't right.

01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:27.507
For this one, they were very supportive of moving forward with making sure that we were helping these, again, these schools that have swings in this for very few students.

01:17:28.808 --> 01:17:37.531
So the next steps because our work will not be done on this methodology and in fact you saw maybe in one or two letters that said that we should look at other indicators.

01:17:37.891 --> 01:17:49.395
So we are thinking about looking at chronic absenteeism and college career indicator and to go back to member Ortiz-Lacombe's comment we should probably provide you what when we would actually do this.

01:17:49.495 --> 01:17:51.976
So we'll we'll put that in our in our work plan.

01:17:53.703 --> 01:18:05.333
So this is our recommendation that you approve the application of the safety methodology at the student group level for this fall's dashboard, the 2018 dashboard, only for the graduation rate and suspension rate indicators.

01:18:05.993 --> 01:18:08.435
So I'm happy to open up to technical questions if you have any.

01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:11.438
Any technical questions on this?

01:18:14.046 --> 01:18:26.561
You go back to the table for just a second Cindy the the number of student groups impacted and Tell me what that we have 1,600 student groups or it's the total population.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:31.367
I'm gonna have Jenny present this to you because her folks around the data

01:18:33.130 --> 01:18:35.711
Well, I thought we only had like 15.

01:18:35.932 --> 01:18:36.792
So we don't have a total.

01:18:36.832 --> 01:18:40.174
What I noticed is we didn't have a total student group count on this table.

01:18:40.214 --> 01:18:40.794
Yes, that is true.

01:18:40.834 --> 01:18:41.795
We don't have a total.

01:18:42.135 --> 01:18:49.759
So when you're looking at student group, remember we have every school has a possibility of having 13 student groups.

01:18:50.539 --> 01:18:55.842
And so we're looking at all of those schools and we're adding up all the student groups from all the schools.

01:18:56.764 --> 01:18:57.625
Right?

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:02.227
So there's 1,600 student groups that went from red to orange.

01:19:02.608 --> 01:19:05.129
And all of those schools.

01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:10.733
So some of those schools might have had two or three student groups that we looked at, right?

01:19:10.773 --> 01:19:18.297
Because if they're a small school with less than 150 students, maybe all of their student groups would have had that applied to them.

01:19:18.798 --> 01:19:25.622
And of course, there are larger schools that may have very small student groups and that was applied to them as well.

01:19:28.343 --> 01:19:30.164
Thank you for the clarification.

01:19:30.424 --> 01:19:30.724
Thanks.

01:19:33.126 --> 01:19:35.027
No further technical comments on that.

01:19:37.128 --> 01:19:37.188
OK.

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:39.849
We're going to take a break.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.010
Well, let's see.

01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.070
OK.

01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:44.571
You want to take it?

01:19:44.772 --> 01:19:44.892
OK.

01:19:45.032 --> 01:19:51.495
We'll take a short break now and reconvene at three minutes to 10.

01:19:51.555 --> 01:19:52.635
Maybe 10.

01:19:57.842 --> 01:20:14.814
Okay, we're on to the English Learner Progress Indicator.

01:20:18.493 --> 01:20:18.973
Good morning.

01:20:19.033 --> 01:20:28.759
Again, my name is Cindy Kazanis, the Director of the Accountability Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division.

01:20:29.159 --> 01:20:31.040
We're picking up Item 1.

01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:32.921
We're talking about Attachment 3.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:39.044
This is, again, the last piece of the materials that need action.

01:20:42.166 --> 01:20:50.928
Picking up the English learner progress indicator and as way of background actually, I'm going to go back to my entry slide I just wanted to provide a little bit of context.

01:20:51.028 --> 01:21:05.431
This is one of I would say the indicator we've had Fantastic stakeholder input in fact you had asked us to put together a work group about two years ago and that work group has been very helpful we actually

01:21:05.951 --> 01:21:16.245
had a bit of a hiatus because we were changing to new tests and so we've changed those assessments and we picked up the work group again and we've had good participation.

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:21.552
But the other thing I wanted to keep in mind about this particular indicator and this student group

01:21:22.032 --> 01:21:29.259
is that this student group is represented, of course, in every single indicator, and we always look at the progress of our English learners.

01:21:29.279 --> 01:21:36.746
Well, this is the one that looks at progress of English learners, but we look at how English learners are doing not only in assessments, but compared to others, their peers in suspension, if they're

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:38.086
more chronically absent.

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:47.909
And so because we have such history with this group of students, I just want to acknowledge that we are obviously committed to this.

01:21:48.369 --> 01:21:53.231
Even though this year, obviously, you've read to the end of the book, we will not be able to produce a color.

01:21:53.971 --> 01:21:57.212
So let me walk through where we're at and where we're headed.

01:21:58.952 --> 01:22:04.654
Of course, we are guided not only by our state law, but by the Every Student Succeeds Act.

01:22:05.014 --> 01:22:12.997
And so just as a reminder, that law, the federal law, requires us to test our English learners in all grades, so kindergarten through 12th grade.

01:22:13.657 --> 01:22:24.381
And while Title I only requires the EL accountability component to include grades three through eight, and then the same high school test that we all, our 11th graders, take.

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:32.563
We also must include in our accountability system indicator towards English learner progress, towards achieving English language proficiency.

01:22:34.143 --> 01:22:41.004
So what we've been doing over the last year, and let me talk about actually where we came from.

01:22:41.104 --> 01:22:49.206
So this is roll back two years to 2016, when we originally designed the methodology for the English learner progress indicator.

01:22:49.326 --> 01:22:52.787
One of the things we knew was happening was we were changing to a new assessment.

01:22:53.547 --> 01:23:02.372
The methodology was put together with the thought in mind that it could adapt to any assessment that was adopted.

01:23:02.432 --> 01:23:10.736
So if for some reason we move away from LPAC in a couple of years, this methodology was supposed to withstand that transition.

01:23:11.317 --> 01:23:20.061
So the methodology that is, again, we put back forward in June of 2016, had gone through the California Practitioners Advisory Group.

01:23:20.101 --> 01:23:22.803
It had been vetted through many folks.

01:23:23.303 --> 01:23:24.504
we ultimately adopted it.

01:23:24.604 --> 01:23:34.970
So it was with strong support of where we were all looking forward to for our English learners and showing progress.

01:23:37.119 --> 01:23:50.573
We, over the last year, rather a year ago, we provided you a memo, actually Michelle Center provided you a memo we found back in June of 2017, which gave you really how LPAC was going to be implemented.

01:23:50.613 --> 01:23:54.297
And not only on the assessment side, but how it was going to impact accountability.

01:23:54.797 --> 01:24:05.801
And looking back at it over the last couple of days, I realize that we may have been ambitious and over committed to trying to put something in place without doing our due diligence.

01:24:05.861 --> 01:24:12.904
And you heard from me about what we do when we look at new things with growth model and of course our safety net methodology.

01:24:13.344 --> 01:24:14.905
So I would apply the same thing to this.

01:24:15.705 --> 01:24:22.828
We spent the last year talking to national experts such as Pete Goldschmidt, Robert Lankwanti, Gary Cook, Mark Hansen,

01:24:23.308 --> 01:24:29.391
to advise us on how can we implement and transition to this new assessment as quickly as possible.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:36.494
And so much of what you're going to hear today is with that in mind, with the national researchers who have guided us through this.

01:24:36.654 --> 01:24:42.237
And then the other thing I want to say is that while we put together this memo back about a year ago,

01:24:42.717 --> 01:24:48.241
we started realizing about last fall that we weren't going to be on the trajectory we thought we were going to be on.

01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:55.787
And so one of the groups that meets on a regular basis is called the Bilingual Network Advisory Group, or Bilingual Network BCN.

01:24:58.390 --> 01:25:00.291
Coordinator, excuse me, Coordinator Network.

01:25:00.831 --> 01:25:01.551
These acronyms.

01:25:02.652 --> 01:25:09.714
And just to note, Jonathan Eisler of my staff is here as well to answer questions if you have them, but Veronica Aguilar is here too.

01:25:09.794 --> 01:25:13.396
So she's obviously well-steeped in all of these things.

01:25:14.837 --> 01:25:24.023
So, looking at the status for LP, we wanted to make sure that it measures student growth towards English language proficiency.

01:25:24.804 --> 01:25:28.447
And so, to determine that status, student growth results were aggregated.

01:25:28.487 --> 01:25:36.312
What we've done is aggregate them to the school and LA levels to calculate percentage of students who moved up at least one performance level from the prior year.

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:38.514
This is the way we calculate status.

01:25:39.014 --> 01:25:51.937
So the status calculation provides schools and LEAs with important information on how many of their students who are on track to make progress towards, of course, the ultimate goal of English language proficiency.

01:25:52.937 --> 01:26:07.420
And then keep in mind, thinking about this in terms of our old test, CELT, EL students testing at early advanced or advanced on CELT just needed to maintain at the early advanced or advanced level to show proficiency.

01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:15.024
When we look at change, change is of course the percentage point difference between current year status and prior year status.

01:26:15.104 --> 01:26:31.754
And we look at the recommendation that the department put forward that our technical design group affirmed that change should measure year-to-year change in the rate schools and LEAs move up our English language students towards proficiency.

01:26:31.834 --> 01:26:35.636
Change also allows schools and LEAs to determine if they're on track.

01:26:35.956 --> 01:26:37.257
So we want to make sure that, again,

01:26:38.263 --> 01:26:39.956
We're doing that for both status and change.

01:26:41.894 --> 01:26:52.476
So this is our distribution of English learner percent distribution status and change using two years of longitudinal data.

01:26:53.216 --> 01:26:54.477
We used the CELT data.

01:26:55.217 --> 01:27:04.999
And what we did is we revisited what a district level distribution looks like only when two points of CELT data are used for one cohort of students to report status and change.

01:27:05.699 --> 01:27:09.380
So in putting this simulation together, we calculated the district level.

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:20.908
English Language Percent Proficient by aggregating 2016-17 CELT data for current overall performance levels and domain levels to calculate current status for schools and then districts.

01:27:21.529 --> 01:27:27.533
And we performed the same process aggregating prior overall performance levels and domain levels to calculate prior status.

01:27:28.134 --> 01:27:31.496
Change was calculated by subtracting prior status from current status.

01:27:31.596 --> 01:27:33.858
So that's what you see in the column headers.

01:27:35.882 --> 01:27:40.926
Using only two points in time, the change number is positive across all fifth percentile cut points.

01:27:41.547 --> 01:27:54.937
And we find this to be problematic in terms of reporting LB for schools and districts in the five by five grid to provide there is no meaningful differentiation between schools and districts, which is, of course, important to measure performance and required.

01:27:56.758 --> 01:28:06.260
So this is what it actually looks like on the five by five grid, which is something that we don't see in any of our other distributions when we look at, when we've presented them to you before.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.421
So this, of course, greatly concerned us.

01:28:10.301 --> 01:28:22.363
So this result makes it difficult for the LP to inform decisions related to the identification of schools needing assistance because there's no, again, meaningful differentiation here.

01:28:22.423 --> 01:28:24.724
You actually see no districts in the red.

01:28:27.839 --> 01:28:45.648
So why are we having this challenge with only using two years of data and why we're presenting this to you looking at it being a three-year process to implement a performance level for the LP using our new assessment is because change is measured.

01:28:46.589 --> 01:28:48.550
Of course, we've looked at it from other indicators.

01:28:48.570 --> 01:28:49.810
We always look at two years of data.

01:28:50.251 --> 01:28:52.232
We look at a matched cohort, and we want to make sure that

01:28:53.052 --> 01:29:07.090
the percentiles are proficient, but the change does not measure year-to-year change in the rate at which schools and LEAs move English learners towards proficiency as change in the current LP does, or rather this prior LP does.

01:29:07.971 --> 01:29:11.836
So we need to allow for adequate differentiation, which of course I mentioned previously.

01:29:12.416 --> 01:29:24.943
in performance between schools and LEAs and make sure that if we don't provide this meaningful measure, we can't actually determine which LEAs are in need of technical assistance.

01:29:27.438 --> 01:29:32.560
We have, as I mentioned, we've been talking through some of the challenges as early as last fall.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:39.222
We did do a formal presentation and engaged the English Learner Progress Indicator Workgroup in June.

01:29:39.622 --> 01:29:46.384
So June was a busy month with that and other stakeholder feedback sessions that we tried to get this topic in front of.

01:29:47.284 --> 01:29:55.367
So members that were present agreed that they thought that status can only appropriately be reported with two years of

01:29:56.287 --> 01:30:11.765
Summative results so for the 2019 dashboard So if you think about what we're doing similarly to the college career indicator right now, we're reporting the numbers only you don't see a color for status Three years of data they agreed are necessary to reproduce a color.

01:30:12.025 --> 01:30:15.269
So we're looking at 2020 for the California School dashboard

01:30:16.269 --> 01:30:30.897
I was not present at the meeting, but I'm sure they demanded, not just asked, for data reports to be made available through DataQuest, which we are in the process of revising that site and making it easier to use some of the filters to show how our subgroups are doing.

01:30:30.957 --> 01:30:35.900
And so we do have, for example, our long-term English learner data on DataQuest.

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:37.481
We've had that for several years now.

01:30:38.601 --> 01:30:41.882
So what can we do in absence of a color?

01:30:42.023 --> 01:30:56.828
And so we want to make sure, similar to I think some of the conversations we just had about the growth model, what kind of resources can we show are available to use to think about the creation of goals in the local control and accountability plan reporting.

01:30:58.450 --> 01:31:15.423
The other pieces that the work group wanted was to acknowledge that LEAs do have access to their students' data, their English learner data, which they can use and should be using for the LCAP reporting, whether it's their LPAC results, most specifically.

01:31:16.244 --> 01:31:26.686
And then also, they affirmed that, of course, LEAs are obligated by law to monitor English learner student progress towards reaching English proficiency.

01:31:26.986 --> 01:31:29.467
That doesn't go away just because we didn't create a color, of course.

01:31:29.807 --> 01:31:30.867
The laws are still in place.

01:31:31.667 --> 01:31:34.388
And we still monitor schools for that very purpose.

01:31:34.428 --> 01:31:37.989
That's why we have a federal program monitoring office to do that.

01:31:38.869 --> 01:31:43.354
And then finally, CDE, we are committed to revisiting this.

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:47.479
And so, like I said, we've reached out to the known national experts on this.

01:31:47.519 --> 01:31:53.346
We know that we are really at the forefront with our methodology compared to other states.

01:31:54.046 --> 01:31:58.208
But that doesn't mean that we can't keep looking for other ways to do this.

01:31:58.288 --> 01:32:00.570
But we will be bringing this back to you.

01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:08.194
And like I said, we will develop a work plan so that you have an idea of when you're going to see things over the next 6, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months.

01:32:13.188 --> 01:32:16.170
We also wanted to make sure, of course, that it was technically sound.

01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.473
So we took this to our technical design group, also in June.

01:32:20.113 --> 01:32:24.737
And they also agreed to the recommendation that we were making.

01:32:25.698 --> 01:32:31.702
So their thoughts were, of course, status can only be appropriately reported with two years of data.

01:32:33.104 --> 01:32:37.167
So looking at the 2019 for the dashboard.

01:32:37.387 --> 01:32:42.451
And then three years of data will be necessary to produce a valid

01:32:43.374 --> 01:32:46.025
status and change or of course a color for the LP.

01:32:48.624 --> 01:33:01.775
I said this in the beginning, but I'll keep it towards the end because the last bullet there really emphasizes that the TDG wanted to make sure that they acknowledge and we acknowledge, of course, that our English learner students are already included in all dashboard indicators.

01:33:01.915 --> 01:33:13.185
And in fact, several districts are now in differentiated assistance because their English learners were not performing in one or more various indicators.

01:33:15.211 --> 01:33:19.372
So looking at the state plan, there was a couple letters on this in the dashboard.

01:33:20.153 --> 01:33:31.317
What the state plan, which is of course your next item that Marguerite will present, what it does is it outlines our future plans for use of the LP.

01:33:31.997 --> 01:33:37.779
What we've committed to in that is once two years of data are available, we will be reporting status.

01:33:37.799 --> 01:33:40.900
And so that is something I wanted to make sure that I clarified in here.

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.841
And then we've committed to revisiting this methodology

01:33:45.262 --> 01:33:48.344
next year when these two years of results are available.

01:33:50.245 --> 01:33:52.086
So these are our key activities.

01:33:52.546 --> 01:33:57.389
This is perhaps a preview of what I've already committed to.

01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:59.411
So I forgot that this slide was in here.

01:34:00.612 --> 01:34:02.913
You know, what to anticipate from us.

01:34:04.114 --> 01:34:07.516
And perhaps depending on the discussion, we can adjust these.

01:34:07.556 --> 01:34:09.697
I think these are always open for discussion.

01:34:11.319 --> 01:34:17.884
It sounds like if the board wants to hear about this more often than a year from now, of course, we can do that.

01:34:17.984 --> 01:34:26.311
So you will formally adopt on the dashboard report, of course, you're over your next two meetings.

01:34:26.732 --> 01:34:35.299
But looking at your involvement, we are looking for the status cut scores to be approved, of course, a year from next fall, so November of 2019.

01:34:35.639 --> 01:34:38.301
And then as I've already said,

01:34:39.383 --> 01:34:42.327
November of 2020 approve the change cut scores.

01:34:43.048 --> 01:34:53.583
So with that I wanted to open it up for technical questions and like I referenced Veronica and Jonathan are here to assist with responding to questions.

01:34:55.299 --> 01:34:55.939
Go ahead, Mayor Stroud.

01:34:56.059 --> 01:35:05.781
So, first of all, thank you again and the team for all the work, all the outreach, all the stakeholder input on this particular issue.

01:35:05.801 --> 01:35:13.463
I know we're changing to new assessment and I know we want to adopt valid and reliable measures.

01:35:13.523 --> 01:35:20.985
So I appreciate the comment about the question about when the data will be reliable and that we may need more time.

01:35:21.585 --> 01:35:36.714
That being said, I just would say I'm going to make a proposal in the move after public comment, but I'm concerned that we wait three years if there's a possibility that the data would be reliable after two years.

01:35:36.794 --> 01:35:44.879
So I feel like we need to see the second year of data and see what it offers, look at possible consideration for our dashboard.

01:35:45.359 --> 01:35:52.024
at that time, and then if we've got overwhelming evidence that we would not be serving students well, we can consider that as a board.

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:57.288
But I think we care, English learners are a huge population for us to serve.

01:35:57.388 --> 01:36:02.853
If we serve English learners effectively, we impact everything, quality teaching in all of our schools.

01:36:03.453 --> 01:36:11.961
And I just don't want to right now put it out three years till 2020 just to be safe when maybe in 2019 we're okay.

01:36:12.341 --> 01:36:25.634
So I just want to just say publicly to the board as well that I'm going to be making a recommendation that we need to bring it back for further consideration for possible inclusion based on the data we have at the time and not

01:36:27.475 --> 01:36:29.296
at 2019, at the end of two years.

01:36:29.456 --> 01:36:36.839
And then if we're, I would just say, if the data comes back, like we've had to delay because we've got issues in growth model, then we look at it then.

01:36:36.879 --> 01:36:41.421
But I'm not comfortable waiting three years out just to be sure.

01:36:41.441 --> 01:36:42.961
I just wanna say that.

01:36:44.422 --> 01:36:46.103
Okay, board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

01:36:48.104 --> 01:36:49.584
My J sister, I love you so much.

01:36:53.163 --> 01:36:55.546
I love Ileane.

01:36:55.706 --> 01:37:09.364
And I want to acknowledge and, you know, obviously, I had a lot of questions leading up to today, but I definitely want to acknowledge the work of the department, Superintendent Torlakson's leadership when it comes to English learners, of course, Veronica and her team.

01:37:10.964 --> 01:37:19.228
Not sort of, I never, do I think any of us think that this group has been neglected in terms of our work, our policies.

01:37:19.648 --> 01:37:23.009
We pass the EO roadmap, we have the integrated frameworks.

01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:26.010
And I know that they're in each of the indicators.

01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:30.572
However, the EO group looks very differently in each of those indicators, right?

01:37:30.612 --> 01:37:32.493
And the academic indicator, recall that.

01:37:33.713 --> 01:37:37.855
you all voted to include our FIPS students in the academic indicator.

01:37:37.915 --> 01:37:41.956
So it's English learners plus we classify students up to four years.

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:47.198
So that's a slightly different group of students when we look in the academic indicator.

01:37:47.699 --> 01:37:51.000
And it's academics, it's subject matter, it's not language proficiency.

01:37:52.021 --> 01:37:53.902
Suspension, that's school climate.

01:37:54.242 --> 01:37:57.325
For graduation, that's only high school students.

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:03.930
And so this is a critical indicator for us to continue monitoring progress towards language proficiency.

01:38:04.611 --> 01:38:17.482
I was at the EL roadmap kickoff and in small group discussions, there was a teacher that said, I think one of the challenges going back to my school is that we're a high performing school and our English learner population is so small.

01:38:17.922 --> 01:38:24.249
So, it's going to be really hard for us to change practice when people feel like, you know, it's not broken, why fix it?

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:34.599
And I thought about this particular indicator, because this is the indicator that will tell us, are you really a high performing school for all of your students?

01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:38.824
And of course, there's other subgroups that also would have their own indicator, but

01:38:39.925 --> 01:38:47.370
I think for us, I want to agree with Eileen, with Board Member Strauss, that let's come back in 2019 and see.

01:38:47.610 --> 01:38:52.434
I don't want us to go years without public accountability for this particular student group.

01:38:52.834 --> 01:38:56.437
And if in 2019 we have the data, then let's do that.

01:38:56.517 --> 01:39:08.446
Let's start looking at, can we identify, and I know we won't be able to identify for comprehensive or targeted support, because that's on a three-year basis, but we will be able to identify for LEAs at the annual, under LCFF.

01:39:09.056 --> 01:39:09.397
Thank you.

01:39:12.927 --> 01:39:15.395
Okay, any other comments on this item?

01:39:17.432 --> 01:39:19.374
If not, then we're ready for public comment.

01:39:19.394 --> 01:39:21.396
I actually have some good news to share first.

01:39:21.436 --> 01:39:23.618
I have two or three more slides.

01:39:23.678 --> 01:39:28.802
So I wanted to just take the opportunity to do some shout outs.

01:39:29.823 --> 01:39:36.188
The governor in his January budget proposed $300,000 for updating the dashboard's user interface.

01:39:36.949 --> 01:39:39.772
We, of course, supported that and the legislature supported it.

01:39:39.812 --> 01:39:41.953
And of course, the governor signed that into law.

01:39:43.094 --> 01:39:47.057
We have been working with our contractor, which is San Joaquin County Office of Education.

01:39:47.497 --> 01:40:00.706
They released a request for proposal recently, and we did an info session for interested vendors, and we told them about all of the great feedback we've gotten and some of the bad feedback we've gotten.

01:40:00.766 --> 01:40:12.414
You know, really critical of what changes need to be made to the dashboard, and also told them a list of things that we expected them to produce in a prototype, including a Spanish translation version, how that looked.

01:40:12.914 --> 01:40:19.537
So Collaborative Communications, based in Washington, DC, was a successful bidder.

01:40:19.897 --> 01:40:22.218
They've worked with groups like the Data Quality Campaign.

01:40:22.498 --> 01:40:28.781
They worked on Illinois State Report Card, as well as, I think, DC Public Schools, if I'm right.

01:40:29.862 --> 01:40:41.076
They have actually already been on board and provided us an initial design and they will be delivering a prototype to us this weekend.

01:40:42.298 --> 01:40:43.379
I have to make sure that

01:40:45.181 --> 01:40:53.589
You're all aware, but I'm going to remind you that just because we have a design, we then actually have to implement it in a website.

01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:59.093
And so this particular contract was only to give us really the look and feel of it.

01:40:59.734 --> 01:41:02.496
San Joaquin Office of Education will have to actually implement this.

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:10.923
And so we wanted to make sure that we did make sure, rather, when we put out the request for proposals, that they knew what the expectations were as far as

01:41:12.465 --> 01:41:16.028
how San Joaquin works, what kind of software they work with, and such like that.

01:41:16.128 --> 01:41:20.011
So trying to make this as easy of a transition as possible.

01:41:20.391 --> 01:41:28.238
With that said, we have to make some decisions very quickly over the next couple of weeks because San Joaquin will need to get started on implementation.

01:41:28.638 --> 01:41:34.280
because we have committed to the field, like we did last year, that they'll get a month of preview time to look at their data.

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.142
So what we did last year was we opened it up around the first week of November.

01:41:38.222 --> 01:41:44.684
We're planning to do the same this year, and rolling out the indicators, a couple indicators every week.

01:41:44.805 --> 01:41:51.067
And so by the time we get to a public release in December, they are very aware of things.

01:41:51.267 --> 01:41:57.810
If for some reason the department made a mistake in a calculation, we've caught it ahead of time so that it's not something that, you know,

01:41:59.010 --> 01:41:59.831
makes newsworthy.

01:42:00.311 --> 01:42:07.276
So with that in mind, we have reached out and actually the state board staff and Sarah Petrosky has been fantastic.

01:42:07.356 --> 01:42:11.199
I took a little vacation and she got all this done in my absence.

01:42:11.239 --> 01:42:14.301
And so it's great to have that collaboration.

01:42:14.341 --> 01:42:16.963
But next week is going to be a busy week of stakeholder input.

01:42:17.963 --> 01:42:34.553
We actually have PTAs hosting a group of parents for us, AXA is hosting a group of administrators for us, and then we've done invitations to the major education and equity groups for an input session that the vendor is going to host this next week.

01:42:34.653 --> 01:42:38.075
So with that in mind, I just wanted to let you know that

01:42:38.775 --> 01:42:40.196
We are seeing some amazing things.

01:42:40.416 --> 01:42:43.217
You will have a new look and feel for this dashboard.

01:42:43.477 --> 01:42:49.920
And I think you'll be happy with what is ultimately selected and implemented in December.

01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:58.705
And then finally, just to put it all in context, over the last 60 days, we participated in 25 outreach activities.

01:42:58.845 --> 01:43:03.747
And this is as, of course, the year was ending for many schools.

01:43:04.127 --> 01:43:06.108
But we were able to reach about 2,000 individuals.

01:43:06.168 --> 01:43:07.449
And so I think that's really

01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:33.472
Really important, but what I do want to mention is that we still have a long way to go Jenny went to I think there was a migrant the migrant conference was in San Francisco recently and she was offered an opportunity to present and she had a room for 60 or 75 people and we only had 12 participants and so we have to do a better job about getting out there about why it's important that they come to our sessions and they and

01:43:33.752 --> 01:43:43.776
They participate in these meetings and we're going to look at new ways to partner up with outreach on the outreach side over the next couple of months.

01:43:45.016 --> 01:43:47.437
So with that, I am done with my presentation.

01:43:47.457 --> 01:43:48.397
I'll go back to presentation.

01:43:48.437 --> 01:43:50.058
We're now ready for public comment.

01:43:50.918 --> 01:43:51.978
Please call the list.

01:43:53.059 --> 01:44:00.381
Will the following speakers please line up?

01:44:00.401 --> 01:44:00.801
Not now.

01:44:02.142 --> 01:44:02.402
Go ahead.

01:44:03.547 --> 01:44:05.728
Will the following speakers please line up?

01:44:05.848 --> 01:44:30.642
Doug McRae, Katrina Gregana, Andrea Ball, Carrie Heschnell, Samantha Tran, Cesar Cruz, Kimberly Godano, Kelly Joy, Riguel Masrano, Alma Lopez, Martha Alvarez, Felicia Jones, Gabe Garcia, Lee Angela Reed, and Elizabeth Robitalli.

01:44:36.482 --> 01:44:36.882
Good morning.

01:44:36.942 --> 01:44:40.124
I'm Doug McRae, retired education measurement specialist from Monterey.

01:44:41.265 --> 01:44:43.586
I support all three of the staff recommendations today.

01:44:44.326 --> 01:44:46.748
Regarding the action to delay a growth model,

01:44:47.595 --> 01:44:56.219
My primary comment is the Smarter Balanced psychometric infrastructure is currently not strong enough to support a reliable and valid growth model application.

01:44:56.919 --> 01:44:59.740
Details for this statement can be found in your electronic folder.

01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:08.204
I'd also comment true growth model measurement for K-12 tests has been a holy grail for measurement specialists for more than 50 years.

01:45:09.364 --> 01:45:13.427
during which time known uniformly accepted method has generated wide support.

01:45:13.987 --> 01:45:19.752
My personal history goes back to 1966 when I was a grad student intern at one of the major test publishers.

01:45:21.453 --> 01:45:36.203
Regarding three-year plan to implement LP indicator, I'd note yet to be validated operational LPAC scores from last spring based upon preliminary cut scores from last November argue against formal use for accountability beginning fall 2018.

01:45:39.046 --> 01:45:43.358
Adding to reasons for the three-year plan, that adds to reasons.

01:45:43.459 --> 01:45:45.766
More on this topic can be found in your electronic folder.

01:45:46.488 --> 01:45:46.749
Thank you.

01:45:52.472 --> 01:45:55.715
Good morning, Catharina Gargana on behalf of CABE and Californians Together.

01:45:56.175 --> 01:46:03.681
First, we would like to state that we are appreciative of the progress made thus far on integrating the local, state, and federal accountability and continuous improvement system.

01:46:04.201 --> 01:46:05.723
However, we have concerns.

01:46:06.283 --> 01:46:10.787
We would like to echo the comments made by Board Member Strauss and Board Member Ortiz-Licón.

01:46:11.667 --> 01:46:29.898
We have concerns about the suggested three-year timeline for the English learner proficiency indicator and request that the board consider revising the recommendation as outlined in our letter to state that when CDE has two years of data for the LPAC, the board will revisit the LP methodology cut points and timelines for the English language proficiency.

01:46:31.039 --> 01:46:40.310
Additionally, if the proposed three-year timeline for the LP is adopted, there will be no indicator in the state accountability system that looks at progress of current ELs on the dashboard.

01:46:40.751 --> 01:46:49.361
We request that the modification be made to be consistent with the proposal in the SS plan for identifying the bottom 5% Title I schools for targeted support.

01:46:49.721 --> 01:46:50.002
Thank you.

01:46:54.056 --> 01:47:00.318
Thank you, Mr. Chair, members, Superintendent Torlakson, Andrea Ball on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

01:47:01.458 --> 01:47:02.178
Three comments.

01:47:02.858 --> 01:47:13.361
On the growth model, we do think it is important and valuable to continue looking at this and really making progress and helping districts who want this additional perspective on their students' progress.

01:47:13.721 --> 01:47:15.922
So please continue to look at this.

01:47:16.042 --> 01:47:18.563
Take advantage of the expertise that's been offered to you.

01:47:19.563 --> 01:47:31.687
On the English learner progress indicator, we do have a concern about the lack of or the potential to not have districts focus on English learners to the extent we need to.

01:47:32.267 --> 01:47:39.609
Board member Strauss' proposal is one that seems really interesting and hope you will explore if there's valid data in two years to come back and look at that.

01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:53.210
And finally, on the last point that Cindy Kazanis made about the dashboard improvements, we're thrilled, and CSBA would like to offer to help you with that outreach, getting feedback, and participating in the stakeholder work on that.

01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.851
Thank you.

01:47:58.090 --> 01:48:00.792
Good morning, Carrie Hannel with the Education Trust West.

01:48:01.492 --> 01:48:03.154
I want to speak about the student growth measure.

01:48:03.454 --> 01:48:08.137
We are deeply concerned about the continued delay on the student growth measure.

01:48:08.197 --> 01:48:12.160
We need a clear timeline, a short timeline at this point for moving forward.

01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.861
We don't think a three-year plan is adequate.

01:48:15.282 --> 01:48:24.368
We have talked about this for the past 15 years and think that we have enough information, enough data, enough study to make a decision with some additional refinements.

01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:28.313
You say that this doesn't tell us if achievement gaps are closing.

01:48:28.933 --> 01:48:32.817
The status measure and the change measure together don't tell us that either.

01:48:32.977 --> 01:48:34.379
They're extraordinarily volatile.

01:48:34.759 --> 01:48:48.832
What the growth measure does is it provides fair data on schools that have highly mobile populations and on schools that have significant portions of English learners, students with disabilities, or students who are performing very low or very high as compared with their peers.

01:48:49.813 --> 01:48:53.556
What it does do is it helps us address the achievement gap, which is even more important.

01:48:53.916 --> 01:48:58.239
It provides data on student learning, and it helps us identify as a state the schools that need the most support.

01:48:58.279 --> 01:49:04.223
There are schools that are further behind that are making faster progress, and schools that are further behind that are making less progress, and we need to know the difference between the two.

01:49:04.483 --> 01:49:06.265
The state is uniquely positioned to do that.

01:49:06.365 --> 01:49:08.366
Districts and schools do not have this data on their own.

01:49:08.827 --> 01:49:11.829
You have a responsibility to make this data available and use it for accountability purposes.

01:49:11.869 --> 01:49:12.149
Thank you.

01:49:17.833 --> 01:49:19.575
Good morning, Felicia Jones with COPE.

01:49:19.595 --> 01:49:22.477
We represent families and students in the Inland Empire.

01:49:23.358 --> 01:49:31.305
We agree that a student growth measure should happen swiftly and should be included in the dashboard.

01:49:31.345 --> 01:49:35.069
We know too well what our schools look like when they're failing.

01:49:36.009 --> 01:49:40.993
And we also know what they look like when they are actually serving and advancing learning for students.

01:49:41.414 --> 01:49:48.520
But our families should not have to guess on where they're going to find that consistency in their schools.

01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:55.185
Setting this standard makes it possible for us to get it right for students who continue to fall.

01:49:56.566 --> 01:50:01.673
in that achievement gap and for those students whom that gap continues to widen.

01:50:02.433 --> 01:50:10.743
We certainly are, again, supporting a growth measurement and really hope that you will make a decision quickly.

01:50:11.464 --> 01:50:14.388
As a parent, I have been an advocate for a long time.

01:50:15.163 --> 01:50:19.446
and have longed to see this type of measurement for my own child.

01:50:19.867 --> 01:50:22.489
And I know that there are so many other parents that want the same.

01:50:22.969 --> 01:50:28.693
We cannot delay the hopes and dreams of our parents and our students while we try and figure this out.

01:50:28.773 --> 01:50:30.455
Please get it right for our parents and students.

01:50:30.675 --> 01:50:30.935
Thank you.

01:50:35.572 --> 01:50:37.433
Good morning, Samantha Tran with Children Now.

01:50:37.453 --> 01:50:46.156
I just want to say we really do appreciate all the work that Cindy and Jenny and Michelle and the team at CDE and State Board have done over the last several years.

01:50:46.216 --> 01:50:50.638
This lift to create an accountability system is massive and we're all trying to do it for the benefit of kids.

01:50:51.518 --> 01:51:00.146
We recognize that the technical policy and communications issues related to a growth measure are really complex and intricate and interconnected.

01:51:00.166 --> 01:51:05.110
And as such, you know, we recognize that more time is going to be needed.

01:51:05.190 --> 01:51:13.777
But per board member Felice Ortiz-Lacombe's suggestion, a very clear timeline on that front would be highly valued by the field.

01:51:13.817 --> 01:51:15.599
It would give us faith that things are moving forward.

01:51:16.099 --> 01:51:29.868
In addition to that, we would strongly recommend that you bring together a body similar to the PSAA committee that we had before, because it gave us an opportunity for stakeholders and experts to dig into these complex issues together and to really hear each other.

01:51:29.888 --> 01:51:39.935
Because right now, the modes of communication that we're using, you know, letters that are developed on short timelines, one-minute testimony, positive or negative press coverage, it's not serving any of our interests.

01:51:39.975 --> 01:51:45.199
And I think we have much more in common than the different perspectives we have around these issues and the need to resolve them together.

01:51:45.479 --> 01:51:45.739
Thank you.

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:50.980
Good morning.

01:51:51.080 --> 01:51:59.984
My name is Kelly Joy, and I'm a member of the research and policy team at Innovate Public Schools, a nonprofit whose mission is to increase the number of world-class public schools serving low-income students of color.

01:52:00.824 --> 01:52:03.765
We strongly recommend that you do not delay the release of a student growth measure.

01:52:04.325 --> 01:52:10.128
Innovate has a base of several thousand parents who are advocating for ways to improve educational opportunities for their children.

01:52:10.348 --> 01:52:15.450
Reliable data about student learning at the school, district, and state levels absolutely essential to driving these efforts.

01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:19.815
California's current way of tracking differences in student achievement over time is insufficient.

01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:28.826
The education research field is definitely not happy with California's current change indicator and the system that we have now does not control for changing demographics or student mobility.

01:52:29.467 --> 01:52:34.634
This means that it does not follow the same students from year to year and really limits the insights that we can get from that information.

01:52:35.294 --> 01:52:41.417
Delaying the student growth measure would continue to hide inequities in our education system that hold back low-income students and students of color.

01:52:41.898 --> 01:52:48.181
It also makes it difficult to identify the schools that are successfully educating these students and prevents us from learning from those models.

01:52:48.841 --> 01:52:54.184
Parents, researchers, policymakers, and ultimately students would all benefit from a student growth measure.

01:52:54.204 --> 01:52:56.465
We've already waited over 10 years.

01:52:56.485 --> 01:53:01.268
A vote to delay until someday, one day is a vote to deny this critical information to families who deserve it.

01:53:01.348 --> 01:53:01.928
Thank you very much.

01:53:07.677 --> 01:53:08.117
Good morning.

01:53:08.297 --> 01:53:09.317
My name is Alma Lopez.

01:53:09.377 --> 01:53:12.158
I'm a parent advisor at Sac City Unified School District.

01:53:12.978 --> 01:53:15.859
And I'm here to urge you to adopt the growth measure.

01:53:16.259 --> 01:53:21.580
I think it's something imperative because it would allow to measure the rate at which our students are learning from year to year.

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:27.162
And from my experience working with the students but also with their families as a whole, there is a lot of mobility.

01:53:27.482 --> 01:53:32.943
I worked with low income students, a lot of population of English learners and also foster youth.

01:53:33.423 --> 01:53:37.286
And so there is homelessness, right?

01:53:37.306 --> 01:53:43.512
I dealt with a lot of students and families who are going homelessness, who can't afford affordable housing, so they're moving.

01:53:44.072 --> 01:53:48.235
And I think it's important for our students and they deserve to know what their progress is individually.

01:53:48.536 --> 01:53:48.816
Thank you.

01:53:54.693 --> 01:53:56.675
Hi, my name is Kimberly Gudino.

01:53:56.915 --> 01:54:03.480
I am a Brown Issues advisor at a school in South Sacramento, a middle school in South Sacramento.

01:54:04.281 --> 01:54:12.707
And one of my roles and goals as an advisor on campus is to dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline and create a middle school-to-career pipeline.

01:54:13.068 --> 01:54:18.332
And the current growth measure, the current measure, it makes it a lot more difficult for me to do this.

01:54:18.826 --> 01:54:32.438
So the growth measure that we should adopt can be used to predict an average school's yearly growth using average scores of different student groups, which are like low-income, ethnic, and racial groups, and English learners.

01:54:33.038 --> 01:54:36.981
And adopting this measure would help address the needs of our students in our communities that we serve.

01:54:37.222 --> 01:54:37.542
Thank you.

01:54:42.162 --> 01:54:42.762
Good morning, folks.

01:54:42.782 --> 01:54:44.003
My name is Gabriel Garcia.

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:49.225
I work with the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center representing Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese Americans.

01:54:50.045 --> 01:54:58.068
We are in support of the growth measure because we understand that we cannot see how our youth and our students are doing unless we can measure their achievements over time.

01:54:59.269 --> 01:55:02.530
This is especially important for recognizing achievement gaps.

01:55:03.110 --> 01:55:09.756
Like was said earlier, we simply cannot understand unless we are looking not only at growth, but also growth across subgroups.

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:17.382
This is particularly important for Asian American and Pacific Islander youth and communities where oftentimes their data can be reported together.

01:55:17.863 --> 01:55:22.727
By measuring growth over time with subgroups in mind, we definitely believe that

01:55:23.308 --> 01:55:27.173
It is a powerful way for us to address the achievement gaps that persist in our communities.

01:55:27.573 --> 01:55:34.242
That's why we see the growth measure as a first step for evolving California's data systems to actually be reflective of the needs of California's youth.

01:55:34.542 --> 01:55:34.803
Thank you.

01:55:38.795 --> 01:55:43.176
Good morning, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

01:55:43.657 --> 01:55:48.298
We are supportive of the staff recommendations on the three items before you today on item number one.

01:55:49.078 --> 01:55:57.521
We really want to thank the Department of Education staff, State Board of Education staff, because they have been truly working around the clock to get this work done with very thoughtful recommendations.

01:55:58.181 --> 01:56:02.685
On the growth model, AXA continues to support the inclusion of the growth model in the accountability system.

01:56:03.185 --> 01:56:10.791
For us, it's a matter of the timing and definitely finding information as we get more SBAC information over the next couple of years.

01:56:11.612 --> 01:56:18.437
So, we want to ensure that we have the right model that's considered, as well as enough information to ensure that we reduce that volatility.

01:56:19.297 --> 01:56:41.663
On the second item regarding a safety safety net methodology We support the staff recommendation and we also encourage the recommendation that was made about looking into the chronic absenteeism and CCI indicator to see if it should be applied there for the ELPI also support the recommendation and We encourage the staff to consider how to report on the dashboard that that will be in transition over the next year Thank you

01:56:47.699 --> 01:56:49.181
It brings me great joy to be here.

01:56:50.162 --> 01:56:54.087
State Superintendent Torlakson, many moons ago when we had more black hair.

01:56:54.328 --> 01:56:55.830
Could you just introduce your name, please?

01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:57.432
Yeah, my name is Dr. Cesar Cruz.

01:56:58.393 --> 01:57:01.977
You took a stand and you joined us as we went without eating for 26 days.

01:57:02.578 --> 01:57:03.219
That was back in 2004.

01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:05.362
It's great to see you again.

01:57:06.443 --> 01:57:07.784
I prepared the following statement.

01:57:08.424 --> 01:57:14.408
On the K-12 academic journey, some kids are born into elevator-type communities that help them rise to the top.

01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:18.731
Others coast a bit slower, but at the right pace in well-working escalators.

01:57:19.572 --> 01:57:22.574
And then there are those kids who try to climb from broken and missing stairs.

01:57:23.194 --> 01:57:29.739
My name is Dr. Cesar Cruz, and I come from a lot of broken and missing stairs, but I'm a proud California public school baby.

01:57:30.379 --> 01:57:36.143
For 24 years, I've been an educator in Oakland and Richmond, standing in solidarity with kids on their uphill climb.

01:57:37.065 --> 01:57:43.246
We want to measure students' growth, but how can we fairly compare how one group did last year to a random group this year?

01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:48.852
Without this growth data, we will be ill-prepared to appropriately differentiate support.

01:57:49.372 --> 01:57:51.393
In my work, this growth measure is vital.

01:57:51.693 --> 01:57:56.095
I'm designing a new public alternative high school in Oakland for kids who've been pushed out.

01:57:56.815 --> 01:58:05.038
Like one of our board members, Ortiz-Licón, said, we can't schedule this for someday, because someday is not the mythical eighth day in the seven-day week.

01:58:05.358 --> 01:58:06.739
Please schedule it and please vote.

01:58:06.919 --> 01:58:07.559
Thank you so much.

01:58:15.708 --> 01:58:17.230
Good morning, board members.

01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:19.552
My name is Rigel Massaro with Public Advocates.

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:23.375
I'm making comments aligned with the letter submitted by the LCFF Equity Coalition.

01:58:24.035 --> 01:58:28.699
First, we strongly support adoption of a student growth model as part of the dashboard of the new accountability system.

01:58:28.919 --> 01:58:34.764
This information will only contribute to local analyses regarding how to address equity and achievement caps.

01:58:34.844 --> 01:58:40.449
We think it's important to realize that the growth measure information will not drive the entire local conversation.

01:58:41.169 --> 01:58:51.505
Our entire accountability system from the LCAP to the dashboard to the system of support are based on multiple points and years of data, not a single year snapshot on test scores only.

01:58:51.525 --> 01:58:55.791
This can help control for the impact of year-to-year fluctuations in any one measure.

01:58:57.142 --> 01:59:01.124
Secondly, we're pleased to see work plans to make the dashboard more user-friendly.

01:59:01.624 --> 01:59:03.565
We're concerned, however, about the revision.

01:59:04.785 --> 01:59:06.606
We want it to be user-friendly.

01:59:06.846 --> 01:59:12.348
And so to do that, we need robust and not rushed feedback from parent and community stakeholders.

01:59:12.829 --> 01:59:15.930
And the summer months are not a good time to get meaningful stakeholder feedback.

01:59:16.450 --> 01:59:22.613
We support Member Strauss' recommendation also the ELPI indicator be kept to a two-year timeline subject to revision.

01:59:23.053 --> 01:59:23.353
Thank you.

01:59:28.897 --> 01:59:32.318
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

01:59:32.738 --> 01:59:40.641
I want to thank the board and department staff for their tremendous work on the development of and really reviewing the growth model.

01:59:41.361 --> 01:59:48.663
SSDA strongly supports a growth model, particularly as we look at our alternative ed programs, because we think we really need to be able to show that.

01:59:48.963 --> 01:59:50.303
But this delay is imperative.

01:59:50.423 --> 01:59:52.644
It has to be information that's accurate.

01:59:53.004 --> 01:59:57.810
And I think the RG model, while really good, does not provide that at this time.

01:59:58.872 --> 02:00:05.540
When you have one student and you're looking at them from third to fourth grade, they're being compared against different students on different standards.

02:00:05.921 --> 02:00:09.165
It doesn't provide the information that parents really are looking for.

02:00:09.665 --> 02:00:11.046
I think the time will be well spent.

02:00:11.066 --> 02:00:18.070
I also want to thank the department and board staff for looking at the safety net.

02:00:18.430 --> 02:00:29.476
And we think it's really important to do the three by five and particularly appreciate looking at chronic absenteeism, which is a huge issue for some of our rurals and that volatility there.

02:00:29.576 --> 02:00:31.137
So we look forward to being part of the conversation.

02:00:31.237 --> 02:00:31.557
Finally,

02:00:31.817 --> 02:00:41.955
I want to thank the board and department staff for the work on the dashboard interface and the tremendous outreach they've done to include stakeholders in that process.

02:00:42.176 --> 02:00:43.478
We look forward to that conversation.

02:00:43.618 --> 02:00:43.899
Thank you.

02:00:48.991 --> 02:00:51.433
Good morning, I'm Sarah Lillis, the executive director of Teach Plus.

02:00:52.333 --> 02:00:54.875
I'm here also in support of incorporating a growth model.

02:00:54.895 --> 02:00:58.557
We appreciate board members Ortiz-Cohn's request for a concrete timeline.

02:00:58.877 --> 02:01:08.944
We also really would push for really identifying a more robust conversation, whether it is a PSAA model or another model that really incorporates voices from the teachers, because we do feel

02:01:09.464 --> 02:01:35.904
that in our new accountability system where we're really focusing on support and improvement, a growth model is important and meaningful information for educators to have, both in terms of identifying where there is progress and where there isn't progress, and really looking at issues of equity, not necessarily identifying achievement gaps, but if we are to address those students who have been underserved or who have been left behind for so long.

02:01:36.244 --> 02:01:37.686
that this is a really critical measure.

02:01:37.726 --> 02:01:43.391
We also do support on the idea of Board Member Strauss' recommendation on the ELPI.

02:01:43.731 --> 02:01:46.534
We also want to offer our assistance as we're looking at the interface.

02:01:46.854 --> 02:01:51.599
Our educators are really eager to better use the tool of the dashboard and be a part of that conversation.

02:01:51.659 --> 02:01:55.602
So we hope that teachers can not only be at the table, but help lead the process.

02:01:55.863 --> 02:01:56.123
Thank you.

02:02:00.694 --> 02:02:01.414
Hello, board.

02:02:02.555 --> 02:02:03.836
My name is Kathy Serzaga.

02:02:04.636 --> 02:02:10.679
I am a high school math teacher of 30 years, started 1988 in Pennsylvania, New Jersey.

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.561
Past 15 years, I've been teaching in Arizona.

02:02:15.121 --> 02:02:16.902
Just recently, I moved to California.

02:02:17.382 --> 02:02:27.468
I'm showing up at this board meeting because I feel like I have a vested interest in what California has to do in the next 20 years of my potential career before I retire officially.

02:02:28.516 --> 02:02:45.933
I think the things that I want to say is, in your comment of how to control, as a high school math teacher who understands statistics, maybe not necessarily the depth of this controlled model of growth, I would have to say some things that came to my mind is, how do you control student mobility?

02:02:46.033 --> 02:02:47.814
How do you control staff mobility?

02:02:49.556 --> 02:02:51.017
How do you control staff mobility?

02:02:51.077 --> 02:02:52.619
Is that a variable in this equation?

02:02:54.315 --> 02:02:55.416
Has anybody thought about it?

02:02:56.077 --> 02:03:00.462
Is it something to be considered, maybe a column to add to your statistical analysis?

02:03:01.343 --> 02:03:02.965
And how do you control testing?

02:03:03.886 --> 02:03:05.027
In Arizona, there's this.

02:03:05.588 --> 02:03:05.969
Thank you.

02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:07.350
Three tests that have been in and out.

02:03:07.791 --> 02:03:08.071
Thank you.

02:03:12.697 --> 02:03:16.080
Elizabeth Robitaille on behalf of the California Charter Schools Association.

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:28.693
We support the idea of taking more time to get the right growth model, but rather than delay indefinitely, we urge the board to place a high priority on finalizing a growth model in the upcoming school year and publishing a revised dashboard

02:03:29.153 --> 02:03:31.476
in spring of 2019 that includes growth.

02:03:32.017 --> 02:03:44.492
It's important to note that based on analysis that both CCSA and CORE have done independently of each other, that the state's current change indicator in the dashboard is actually equally or more volatile than the growth model that CDE has tested.

02:03:45.313 --> 02:03:54.397
Without an actual growth model, California's dashboard will misidentify as underperforming schools with a large number of low-income students who are actually achieving high growth.

02:03:54.937 --> 02:04:04.740
For charter schools, authorizers are making renewal determinations, in some cases deciding to close schools, when in reality these schools may be substantially positively impacting student learning.

02:04:05.361 --> 02:04:10.663
Therefore, we ask that the state place a high priority on finalizing a new growth measure by next spring.

02:04:10.823 --> 02:04:11.103
Thank you.

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:13.820
Okay, thank you.

02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:21.264
That concludes the testimony and so we're ready for board deliberation and action.

02:04:21.424 --> 02:04:22.385
Board Member Strauss.

02:04:24.005 --> 02:04:29.529
So I'm going to make a proposed substitute recommendation and then we can talk about it as well.

02:04:29.549 --> 02:04:31.870
I think we need a few clarifying points before.

02:04:32.611 --> 02:04:41.457
And really this recommendation actually, I think the original recommendation in the board just wasn't as clear and specific as we need to be really clear about what we want to do as a board.

02:04:41.757 --> 02:04:46.620
And I think it follows based on what we heard in the presentation and in the technical clarification.

02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.001
So it has three parts.

02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:49.442
So bear with me.

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:53.845
And then we're going to pass out paper copies that we just did.

02:04:55.125 --> 02:04:56.966
So this is a substitute recommendation for item one.

02:04:57.046 --> 02:05:12.170
The CDE recommends that the State Board approve number one, further study of the growth model, including but not limited to the impact of future years of assessment data, changes in the model to reduce year-to-year volatility, and consideration of additional growth models.

02:05:12.430 --> 02:05:13.010
That's number one.

02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:18.514
Number two, the recommended proposal to apply the safety net methodology to student groups.

02:05:18.574 --> 02:05:35.447
And number three, the three-year plan for the ELPI with the addition of the CD report to State Board of Education following the collection of the second year of ELPAC data for consideration of options for using the data for accountability purposes in the California School Dashboard in 2019.

02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:40.653
Board member, motion, is it seconded?

02:05:41.714 --> 02:05:42.935
Second by board member Burr.

02:05:43.776 --> 02:05:46.099
Board member comment, member Burr first.

02:05:47.732 --> 02:05:53.195
So just on the motion for a second, and then I want to make a couple comments about the testimony.

02:05:54.435 --> 02:05:55.836
I think this is fine, obviously.

02:05:55.876 --> 02:05:56.396
I second it.

02:05:56.436 --> 02:06:10.002
But I hope that it will incorporate some of the comments that were made during your actual presentation about making sure that we're looking at the data that currently is available at what level, what it can be used for, for particular decision points.

02:06:10.042 --> 02:06:13.324
Because we've used this phrase a couple times.

02:06:13.384 --> 02:06:15.685
I think Member Sun initiated it.

02:06:16.425 --> 02:06:21.128
We have been searching for the Holy Grail for many, many years in California.

02:06:21.408 --> 02:06:25.310
Mr. McRae has been since 1960, middle of the 60s.

02:06:26.071 --> 02:06:28.792
And I just, so I just want people to understand that.

02:06:28.873 --> 02:06:32.154
And I think we may be wishing for something that doesn't exist.

02:06:33.415 --> 02:06:44.419
We'll keep looking and and I have to say that the tenor of the letters Concerned me because they seem to be kind of accusatory that we were not going to try to move forward Which is absolutely not the case.

02:06:44.919 --> 02:06:55.043
We're happy to keep looking at it We want to be clear about what we're using it for and how it will be helpful again at the local level to make decisions on behalf of success for students, so

02:06:55.683 --> 02:07:03.251
I just want to say, Cindy, I know you guys were taking notes that make sure that we're addressing some of those issues and being absolutely transparent.

02:07:04.232 --> 02:07:17.485
I wanted to just make, in addition to my comment about my concern about the letters, which seem to be overly confrontational, I guess, about this topic, which I would like people to think a little bit about.

02:07:18.246 --> 02:07:22.370
There are two points that were made in the testimony that I just think we need to correct.

02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:25.472
We do have an advisory committee on accountability.

02:07:25.572 --> 02:07:29.415
It's called CPAG, the California Practitioners Advisory Group.

02:07:29.435 --> 02:07:32.838
It meets regularly, operates, has teachers.

02:07:32.918 --> 02:07:34.840
It's a very wide-ranging committee.

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:43.827
And again, thanks to Cindy and Jenny and Michelle and Hurst, everybody that goes and makes these presentations invites lots of public input.

02:07:44.708 --> 02:07:49.894
Please pay attention to CPAG if you're interested in having those kinds of discussions.

02:07:50.615 --> 02:07:59.624
The other thing, just to reinforce, and I know everybody knows this, but our accountability system and our funding system is built on what we do for student subgroups.

02:08:00.285 --> 02:08:02.327
It has equity at its core.

02:08:03.328 --> 02:08:11.215
So the comments about not, it seemed like I heard people saying we need a lot more information because you're masking what's happening with subgroups.

02:08:12.156 --> 02:08:23.226
Again, I hope that you'll educate yourself about that and about the data that's available and how important it is that we not make the mistake of the API where we were masking what was happening with subgroups.

02:08:23.906 --> 02:08:34.557
Just wanted to make those comments to make sure that people were clear about how they could provide input and how our data is reported and how we're focused on student subgroup performance.

02:08:36.479 --> 02:08:37.780
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:08:40.323 --> 02:08:40.743
Thank you.

02:08:40.763 --> 02:08:43.466
And I do like the motion, but for number one,

02:08:44.096 --> 02:08:54.583
I would like, you mentioned a memo, and I would like us to identify when that memo with the timeline for further action would come to us for the study of the RG model.

02:08:55.524 --> 02:09:09.433
So if we could be more specific as to when we could expect, you know, so I know there's gonna be further study, but when can we expect some sort of timeline that tells us when this information will be coming back to the board, whether it be as a presentation or via memos?

02:09:10.834 --> 02:09:30.226
And in terms of some of the comments that were made, what I heard was not necessarily that we're negating or not paying attention to equity, but that what we currently have does not give us a measure of whether or not we're closing achievement gaps and how students are progressing.

02:09:30.967 --> 02:09:38.352
Not one cohort, cohort A versus cohort B, but cohort A as they move from one grade level to the next.

02:09:38.812 --> 02:09:41.535
And so I do want to, that's what I heard.

02:09:42.616 --> 02:09:51.927
But I also heard a lot of people wanting to be part of the conversation and I think we should include them because it doesn't become your problem, it becomes our problem.

02:09:52.367 --> 02:09:58.594
And if we're all listening and are challenged by the same methodology and we have to wrestle with the same issue,

02:09:58.974 --> 02:10:06.038
then there's an understanding that it's not them versus us, it's really all of us collectively trying to figure this out.

02:10:06.438 --> 02:10:09.200
So I think opening the conversation really is a win-win.

02:10:10.121 --> 02:10:17.325
We bring more stakeholders, more voices to the table, but it also really dispels the myth that we're trying to do this

02:10:17.845 --> 02:10:24.587
There's technical design group that no one knows who they are and they're not really perhaps focused on the same things we're focused.

02:10:24.607 --> 02:10:26.067
Their urgency is not the same.

02:10:26.448 --> 02:10:36.831
I think people are really concerned with a sense of urgency, of narrowing achievement gaps, making sure that we're really tracking students and really holding ourselves accountable for their progress or lack thereof.

02:10:37.191 --> 02:10:41.112
And so I think that sense of urgency is what's really causing or, you know,

02:10:42.072 --> 02:10:45.375
the comments and I read it more as, how can we help you?

02:10:45.455 --> 02:10:47.417
How can we be part of the same conversation?

02:10:47.437 --> 02:10:49.659
So I think we're all on the same team, people, yay.

02:10:49.679 --> 02:10:53.562
Okay, board member Sun.

02:10:54.023 --> 02:10:58.927
I agree, and I will support the recommendations as they're written here.

02:10:59.267 --> 02:11:09.296
But I also want to emphasize that as we are looking at reducing the volatility and consideration of additional growth models,

02:11:10.156 --> 02:11:19.304
I'd like us to think maybe a little bit outside the box, because it could be perhaps that this growth model, holy grail, does not exist.

02:11:19.745 --> 02:11:26.971
But we do know what the problem is that exists, and it is our challenges in closing the achievement gaps.

02:11:27.331 --> 02:11:35.118
And so we need to be able to measure it in some way and then be able to identify those practices that are accelerating the closing of those gaps.

02:11:36.659 --> 02:11:46.011
If it's not the growth model, if it's some other way of looking at the data or some other way of digging down into the depths of this, then that's fine.

02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:48.834
But I think we all are clear on what the issue is.

02:11:50.176 --> 02:11:54.060
Let's open it up beyond growth model, perhaps, to be able to figure that out.

02:11:55.001 --> 02:12:02.526
And the other piece I would say, I do think that with all of the different, all the work that we have, there's so many priorities.

02:12:02.546 --> 02:12:07.489
I don't want this to fall off the list.

02:12:07.609 --> 02:12:10.411
So I would agree with a very clear timeline.

02:12:11.111 --> 02:12:35.608
And the other piece around this in the stakeholder input is because this is so technical and so nuanced that I do think that there needs to be a specific group of folks who come together to talk about this and with experts in this area, technical experts and access for those who want to hear the conversation and be able to provide input along the way.

02:12:37.805 --> 02:12:40.387
Board member Rucker, I think was next and then Sandoval.

02:12:43.389 --> 02:12:59.201
OK, so first of all, I want to join the chorus of folks who truly appreciates the work that the department does in not only doing this research and working with consultants and stakeholders, but in coming prepared to each of these board members.

02:12:59.361 --> 02:13:03.564
I mean, each of these board meetings to lay out what all of the issues are.

02:13:04.585 --> 02:13:24.558
And so it's always with a certain amount of trepidation when I study the board item that's this board item related to accountability that I have concern not only about how full and how packed the item is, but on all the multiple perspectives on what it is that we should be doing.

02:13:25.174 --> 02:13:46.056
While there has been a great deal of effort to create consonance and create some agreements and consensus about where the priorities are and the direction that this board has taken, there remains this sense of what is the great unanswered or what seems to be the great intractable

02:13:46.636 --> 02:13:48.297
and unresolvable issue.

02:13:48.317 --> 02:13:55.721
You know, this is one of those times again when I find my English major and that degree I have in English of great use to me.

02:13:56.241 --> 02:14:07.848
While people want to talk about or use this metaphor of the growth model as a holy grail, I want to remind you the holy grail was an idea.

02:14:08.468 --> 02:14:09.329
and ideal.

02:14:09.429 --> 02:14:16.635
It was romanticized in literature as something we continue searching for, but it was never attained.

02:14:17.476 --> 02:14:24.422
And so if we want, if the goal is to actually implement a growth model, find a different metaphor.

02:14:24.963 --> 02:14:25.283
Because...

02:14:29.461 --> 02:14:34.382
The most important goal is to figure out how to close the achievement gap.

02:14:34.822 --> 02:14:43.584
And while closing the achievement gap is something that I have observed at the policy level, people have given lip service to for a long time.

02:14:44.064 --> 02:14:55.866
This state adopted an API that said schools were still making growth and gains and could actually be recognized as golden seal schools even when African American students were performing as much as 100 points behind

02:14:57.546 --> 02:14:58.487
everybody else.

02:14:58.887 --> 02:15:02.310
So that is not accountability that closes the achievement gap.

02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:11.718
I think we have to understand what we're looking at in trying to define or quantify what the achievement gap is and how we want to report it.

02:15:11.958 --> 02:15:12.859
That's the first thing.

02:15:13.399 --> 02:15:20.065
And then we have to figure out when we give that report, what are we expecting schools to do with that data?

02:15:20.565 --> 02:15:25.289
When I was a classroom teacher and we would have our meetings about accountability at the beginning of the year,

02:15:25.829 --> 02:15:29.952
It lasted about three minutes because that was about how long it took to say three sentences.

02:15:30.292 --> 02:15:34.174
The test scores are down, raise them, talk to you next year.

02:15:34.594 --> 02:15:48.603
That is not a conversation that raises the achievement gap, nor is simply coming up with a better or more refined way of reporting data the conversation that leads to closing the achievement gap.

02:15:49.278 --> 02:15:58.493
My favorite metaphor has always been from the days when we implemented NCLB is that weighing the pig doesn't make it any fatter.

02:15:59.535 --> 02:16:01.999
Feeding the pig makes the pig fatter.

02:16:02.702 --> 02:16:20.849
So if we're going to close the achievement gap, we have to understand the secret or the work is not in refining the reporting, but providing the important and incremental support to schools that the data says the schools need.

02:16:21.250 --> 02:16:29.293
So I'm happy to continue participating in this conversation about the growth model and about the work that we need to do.

02:16:29.813 --> 02:16:40.318
I think it's important for us to add this data about the English learners for reporting purposes to the accountability model and do that in a more precipitous way.

02:16:40.778 --> 02:16:50.562
But when we finish refining all of these data points and we continue adding more tests and adding more data points, we still need to feed the pig.

02:16:50.582 --> 02:16:53.303
Thank you.

02:16:53.664 --> 02:16:54.564
Board Member Sandoval.

02:16:57.645 --> 02:16:58.406
Thank you, Member Eckert.

02:16:58.446 --> 02:16:59.447
That was really well said.

02:16:59.467 --> 02:16:59.988
Thank you.

02:17:00.668 --> 02:17:01.429
Beautifully said.

02:17:02.470 --> 02:17:09.377
So I just want to thank everyone for breaking down some very complex information so that it's more digestible.

02:17:09.457 --> 02:17:12.200
But I think that we're working hard to get it right.

02:17:13.201 --> 02:17:18.864
And it's going to take time and not that anyone wants to delay narrowing the achievement gap.

02:17:18.904 --> 02:17:25.928
But we have to be really honest about what this information would give us and how we're going to use it to help feed the pig, as you said.

02:17:27.488 --> 02:17:33.551
But I think that the revised motion makes good sense.

02:17:33.891 --> 02:17:36.413
And I also agree that having a timeline.

02:17:36.873 --> 02:17:38.054
Could you go to the item?

02:17:38.374 --> 02:17:40.775
There was not the recommendation, but the next steps.

02:17:41.236 --> 02:17:43.842
that were proposed, especially for the study of the growth model.

02:17:47.388 --> 02:17:49.449
One was looking at the information.

02:17:49.489 --> 02:17:57.634
It was continue to provide LEAs and schools support on how to analyze their annual assessment results to set LCAP goals.

02:17:57.874 --> 02:18:13.503
So I think that more done out in the field to help inform our stakeholders and engage them in conversations about how we can use the information that we're already gathering to inform, improve teaching and learning, and narrow the achievement gap is essential.

02:18:16.997 --> 02:18:17.217
May I?

02:18:17.817 --> 02:18:21.719
Carrick Ashley, Deputy Superintendent, Performance Planning and Technology Branch.

02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:23.340
Thank you for that comment.

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.261
Thank you for the comment.

02:18:24.621 --> 02:18:35.266
I just want to inform you, I guess, that we recently sent out a letter to all superintendents

02:18:36.226 --> 02:18:50.009
telling them that now that we've got the assessment system that we have, they're getting results within two or three weeks from a student being tested, which means they've now had the results about six to eight weeks already.

02:18:50.649 --> 02:19:00.552
And that they do not have to, they should not wait for the state to do a press release on all of the results until they do something with that data.

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:03.893
Because that's some of the information we were hearing back.

02:19:05.458 --> 02:19:11.440
They were reticent to put any data out publicly about it until the state had done a press release.

02:19:11.840 --> 02:19:13.860
So we did send that letter.

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:21.702
People should be using that information to identify gaps, identify needs, address those in their LCAPs.

02:19:22.042 --> 02:19:33.946
They should not be waiting for our press release, just like they should not be waiting for a growth model or an accountability system, because neither one of those things changes teaching and learning.

02:19:35.390 --> 02:19:39.792
The primary purpose of our assessment system is to improve teaching and learning.

02:19:40.532 --> 02:19:46.954
And accountability systems help us point out where needs are, points out where people need assistance.

02:19:47.835 --> 02:19:49.996
But it doesn't change what happens in the classroom.

02:19:50.036 --> 02:19:51.236
And that's the urgency.

02:19:51.276 --> 02:19:55.898
And that's what we want people to do with their assessment data now, not later.

02:19:56.338 --> 02:19:57.979
And so the urgency is there.

02:19:58.379 --> 02:20:01.160
And the data is there available to be used now.

02:20:03.798 --> 02:20:04.559
Okay.

02:20:04.599 --> 02:20:05.519
Any other board members?

02:20:05.739 --> 02:20:06.060
Go ahead.

02:20:06.080 --> 02:20:06.900
Oh, you weren't done.

02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:07.220
I'm sorry.

02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:08.101
No, I wasn't.

02:20:08.141 --> 02:20:20.669
Just that it would be good to have a general, not right now, but perhaps at the next meeting or an information memo, a reasonable timeline for how this work is going to be unfolding.

02:20:21.369 --> 02:20:29.815
And I think how we're going to use the good information that our stakeholders have provided and recommendations and proposed approaches, I think is important.

02:20:30.535 --> 02:20:30.856
Thank you.

02:20:31.696 --> 02:20:32.557
Board member Valdez.

02:20:34.608 --> 02:20:35.268
So a couple of things.

02:20:35.529 --> 02:20:54.381
As we think about the system and we think about, you know, we have LCFF, we have the priorities, we have an LCAP and we have the dashboard and all of that information, there is this real want, if you will, at the local level to let it soak in, to really begin to, as we're working with all of this information.

02:20:54.541 --> 02:20:58.864
But yet there is a concern that it would be lovely to have this growth model.

02:20:58.904 --> 02:21:02.086
We want the growth model, but it has to be able to close those gaps.

02:21:02.126 --> 02:21:03.828
And as we were talking, perhaps,

02:21:04.968 --> 02:21:11.010
instead of being known as a growth model, maybe we're called the closer, but that idea of closing the gap, right?

02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:12.670
So we need to focus in on that.

02:21:13.450 --> 02:21:25.813
One thing that we've heard from the letters and from today is that there are people, groups of, celebrated groups that work with lots of different people to have, and have many different voices, if you will, and perspectives.

02:21:25.873 --> 02:21:31.215
And in the spirit of improvement science, have we thought about not just having stakeholder groups, and I was part of CPAC,

02:21:32.175 --> 02:21:36.757
It was a great opportunity, and they are a very well-represented group.

02:21:37.057 --> 02:21:39.158
But perhaps we do appeal in ourselves.

02:21:39.258 --> 02:21:53.144
We create a problem of practice, and we talk about the problem, and not the problem, but the opportunity, because if the Holy Grail doesn't exist, I think we should be the research, that we should build, like Sun is saying, board member Sun, we become the research.

02:21:53.645 --> 02:22:00.928
And in order to do that, and it's a problem of practice, but an opportunity of practice, to bring together different organizations,

02:22:01.388 --> 02:22:04.692
that have voices, and we have a conversation about it.

02:22:04.752 --> 02:22:08.696
Not just one-to-one conversations, but in this, let's just talk about it.

02:22:08.816 --> 02:22:11.679
And I think that that leads to great action.

02:22:11.780 --> 02:22:13.041
So it's just an idea.

02:22:13.061 --> 02:22:17.005
We're asking counties and districts and different groups to do that.

02:22:17.246 --> 02:22:18.307
Have we done that here?

02:22:22.112 --> 02:22:30.616
So I want to just kind of summarize a point that I'm requesting for CDE in advance of our next meeting, which is in September.

02:22:30.636 --> 02:22:42.120
I think we have an ongoing item on our board agenda on accountability, and I think we should have an item which gives us a full timeline of all the things coming up, the things that we need to work on, what we've agreed to,

02:22:42.680 --> 02:22:47.104
what the work group, when it's going to CPAG, when it's going out for stake, just a whole timeline.

02:22:47.144 --> 02:22:48.746
That would really help clarify.

02:22:48.766 --> 02:22:55.532
I know there's a huge number of stakeholder meetings and inputs, and yet you hear from public, oh, there's no opportunity for input.

02:22:55.612 --> 02:22:59.916
And I know we go to CPAG, and we all talk about it, and yet people say there's no

02:23:00.336 --> 02:23:01.996
group that we can give input to.

02:23:02.016 --> 02:23:08.198
So I just think with the commitment to look at further models and the timeline, I just think it would be really helpful.

02:23:08.218 --> 02:23:14.359
So I'm just making a formal request in the agenda planning for our September meeting that on accountability, we have a full time.

02:23:14.399 --> 02:23:15.720
I think it'd be helpful for everybody.

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:20.901
And I believe you work with one because you have to manage all the projects you guys are working on anyway.

02:23:20.961 --> 02:23:22.961
So I'm just, I think that would help all of us.

02:23:24.342 --> 02:23:26.182
Okay, Board Member Williams.

02:23:29.490 --> 02:23:30.350
Just a small thing.

02:23:30.390 --> 02:23:34.554
I want to emphasize the part of the discussion that I think everyone agrees on.

02:23:35.114 --> 02:23:42.360
That we take the opportunity, since we're taking some time, not too much time, making it a high priority, wanting to move it forward.

02:23:42.881 --> 02:23:47.184
But we take the opportunity to look at something other than the RG model.

02:23:48.105 --> 02:23:50.627
And in the context of asking ourselves,

02:23:51.608 --> 02:23:55.533
As I've heard most of you say, what is it we want out of this?

02:23:55.613 --> 02:23:56.955
What is it we want to know?

02:23:57.316 --> 02:24:04.205
What is it that the state itself, the CDE, the state board wants to get out of a model?

02:24:04.405 --> 02:24:08.991
And what is it that would be most beneficial to the field in terms of using it?

02:24:10.152 --> 02:24:16.859
to not only close achievement gaps, but also to move all students to meeting the standard.

02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:29.151
So in that context, maybe you did this once before and I'm just spacing on it, but some kind of even matrix for me, this is a kind of a technical thing, but

02:24:30.812 --> 02:24:38.655
some kind of matrix about these are the different kinds of models and here's what each state or this field learns from that.

02:24:38.815 --> 02:24:42.056
And these are ways that data can be used and helpful.

02:24:42.917 --> 02:24:46.518
So I agree with moving forward.

02:24:46.658 --> 02:24:50.160
I agree with making it a really high priority to move forward quickly.

02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:52.561
You guys must be just so exhausted.

02:24:53.801 --> 02:25:01.108
And so let me also compliment you, all of you, all of you at CDE for the work that you do on this.

02:25:01.428 --> 02:25:08.614
It's gone on for a very long time and it's very technical and very tedious and complicated and I really appreciate it.

02:25:09.755 --> 02:25:15.260
And so moving forward, moving forward expeditiously, taking into consideration what you've heard,

02:25:16.261 --> 02:25:23.188
considering more than the RG model, and with each one of them asking the question, what is the use of this information?

02:25:23.688 --> 02:25:30.554
How is it going to help either the state make decisions about whether things are moving forward well?

02:25:32.076 --> 02:25:34.017
And how is it going to help schools and teachers

02:25:36.319 --> 02:25:39.041
make decisions about how to improve the performance of their students.

02:25:40.282 --> 02:25:52.371
And I like the idea of another group, but I like the idea of another group with technical people, like the technical advisory group, or their, you know, companions.

02:25:53.171 --> 02:25:58.435
They're people with really deep technical knowledge that we can have a chance to hear them as well.

02:25:59.898 --> 02:26:02.239
Okay, I think that concludes the comments.

02:26:02.259 --> 02:26:11.144
I have talked with the executive director about trying to think about how to get some more resources to help you in these tasks.

02:26:12.385 --> 02:26:17.348
I mean, this is not in a lot of work schedules and the timing is an issue.

02:26:17.428 --> 02:26:19.509
So I just want to let the board know that we're

02:26:20.109 --> 02:26:28.455
we're going to be conferring together and with the board members about how we can bring this about without just saying, here's another task, go do it.

02:26:29.516 --> 02:26:32.598
And do it by, you know, yesterday.

02:26:32.738 --> 02:26:34.940
So we will... Thank you.

02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:35.900
Just a little perspective.

02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:38.142
What districts are doing right now is giving us all their data.

02:26:38.342 --> 02:26:40.644
And that data period closes at the end of next month.

02:26:40.984 --> 02:26:44.887
So between the end of next month, which is really like September 1st and December 1,

02:26:45.547 --> 02:26:50.612
We will be all hands on deck to figure out how to put together this year's dashboard.

02:26:52.213 --> 02:26:54.836
I don't want to overcommit, but we will get you a timeline.

02:26:55.436 --> 02:26:57.619
I just want to put that in perspective.

02:26:57.999 --> 02:27:02.463
It's really important that we get this year's accountability system out and this dashboard out.

02:27:03.644 --> 02:27:05.846
January is after the holidays.

02:27:05.886 --> 02:27:09.909
January is a new day and hopefully we'll have the ESSA plan well behind us.

02:27:09.969 --> 02:27:16.054
So we'll have, you know, identified new districts and we'll have put forward what we have to do for ESSA as well.

02:27:16.074 --> 02:27:24.481
Well, we want to work with you in the interim to talk about how to, you know, while you're doing what you have to do for everything else, how we can move this along.

02:27:24.621 --> 02:27:24.962
Thank you.

02:27:25.442 --> 02:27:25.822
Okay.

02:27:26.523 --> 02:27:27.684
I think we're ready for a vote.

02:27:28.144 --> 02:27:29.525
We have a motion and a second.

02:27:29.625 --> 02:27:31.047
All those in favor, raise your hands.

02:27:31.767 --> 02:27:32.828
Okay, it's unanimous.

02:27:32.968 --> 02:27:33.428
Thank you.

02:27:34.929 --> 02:27:41.174
We're now on to item two and that is the Essa Redux.

02:27:41.194 --> 02:27:45.558
You know, this is like one of these dragons.

02:27:45.618 --> 02:27:50.361
You slay one head and another one comes up and you knock that one off and another one comes up.

02:27:51.822 --> 02:27:52.803
So here we go again.

02:27:52.823 --> 02:27:55.785
Oh, sorry.

02:28:02.794 --> 02:28:14.444
Okay, Marguerite Reese will present for us.

02:28:20.265 --> 02:28:24.609
Good morning, President Kerr, Superintendent Torlakson, and members of the board.

02:28:26.251 --> 02:28:38.002
This morning I will provide information related to item two, update on the development of the California State Plan for the Every Student Succeeds Act, approval of the revisions to the state plan for resubmission to the U.S.

02:28:38.022 --> 02:28:39.103
Department of Education.

02:28:40.526 --> 02:28:49.492
The CDE and state board staff anticipated that the ESSA update provided at the April meeting would be the final state plan development update item.

02:28:49.672 --> 02:28:54.035
And at today's meeting, we would be able to celebrate the approval of California state plan.

02:28:55.036 --> 02:28:56.737
Alas, that did not happen.

02:29:01.152 --> 02:29:01.552
That's right.

02:29:02.893 --> 02:29:17.704
As the board takes one last look at finalizing California's ESSA Consolidated State Plan, I want to very briefly reiterate the foundational elements of the Every Student Succeeds Act, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or ESEA.

02:29:18.885 --> 02:29:23.689
The ESSA maintains the original purpose of ESEA, equal opportunity for all students.

02:29:24.289 --> 02:29:30.053
The act ensures that disadvantaged and high needs students receive the same educational opportunities as their peers.

02:29:31.034 --> 02:29:37.818
As of today, the Secretary of Education has approved 48 state plans from states in addition to the Territory of Puerto Rico.

02:29:37.839 --> 02:29:42.201
It is worth noting that no states were immediately approved upon submission.

02:29:43.002 --> 02:29:44.863
All received at least one round of feedback.

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:52.408
California's approach is somewhat different than most of the states with approved plans and that the State Board weighs in on each draft of the plan.

02:29:53.851 --> 02:30:02.071
Throughout the state plan development process, state board and CD staff have worked together on what has been a highly collaborative development process shared by our two agencies.

02:30:04.383 --> 02:30:18.474
Given that the State Board has received updates from the CDE related to the development of the State Plan at nearly every meeting for the last two and a half years, my comments today related to the State Plan development timeline will be limited to the activities of the last several months.

02:30:19.295 --> 02:30:27.562
Additional historical information is provided in today's board item as well as previous agenda materials archived on the State Board of Education's webpage.

02:30:29.062 --> 02:30:38.807
At the April meeting, the board recommended approval of the revised state plan, which reflected several changes to the related Title I accountability provisions of the ESSA statute.

02:30:39.608 --> 02:30:41.829
The revised state plan was submitted to the U.S.

02:30:41.849 --> 02:30:44.350
Department of Education shortly after the April meeting.

02:30:45.311 --> 02:30:50.233
At the April meeting, the state board also directed the CDE to develop a waiver request to the U.S.

02:30:50.273 --> 02:30:54.496
Department of Education related to the English Learner Progress Indicator, or ELPI.

02:30:55.560 --> 02:31:00.565
California submitted the waiver request in May after incorporating the required stakeholder feedback.

02:31:01.266 --> 02:31:01.586
The U.S.

02:31:01.606 --> 02:31:14.158
Department of Education has 120 days to issue a ruling on the waiver, and as of today, California has not received a formal response related to the request, although we do know that they have received the waiver and are in the process of reviewing it.

02:31:15.672 --> 02:31:20.475
On June 11th, California was surprised to receive an additional feedback letter from the U.S.

02:31:20.495 --> 02:31:29.202
Department of Education indicating that upon their final review of California's proposed state plan, they found a few remaining outstanding issues.

02:31:30.182 --> 02:31:40.009
In an effort to bring resolution to the state plan development process and move California toward full implementation of the federal statute, CDE and state board staff worked closely with the U.S.

02:31:40.029 --> 02:31:44.733
Department of Education to develop what we are certain is a final, final draft.

02:31:45.714 --> 02:31:57.050
Based on those conversations with staff from the ED over the last several weeks, the CDE and State Board staff proposed to make the revisions to the State Plan included in today's meeting materials.

02:31:58.544 --> 02:32:08.815
Prior to today's State Board meeting, the CD hosted a public, in-person, and webinar meeting related to the proposed revisions to the State Plan from the accountability sections on July 2nd.

02:32:09.535 --> 02:32:11.637
Staff walked through the areas of feedback from the U.S.

02:32:11.657 --> 02:32:18.044
Department of Education and described the proposed modifications to California State Plan for over 100 meeting participants.

02:32:19.305 --> 02:32:26.055
The proposed language in the item reflects the changes that the CDE believes need to make in order to have an approvable plan.

02:32:26.596 --> 02:32:35.249
Based on our conversations with ED staff, the CDE is confident that if the board ultimately adopts these revisions, the secretary will finally approve the plan.

02:32:36.499 --> 02:32:40.645
Pending the action of the board today, the CD's prepared to submit the state plan today.

02:32:41.386 --> 02:32:43.249
Once submitted, we are optimistic that the U.S.

02:32:43.289 --> 02:32:46.213
Department of Education will approve our state plan fairly quickly.

02:32:46.714 --> 02:32:49.678
We anticipate receiving a notice of approval in less than a month.

02:32:51.738 --> 02:32:55.799
The slide before you includes the CDE and State Board staff joint recommendation.

02:32:56.120 --> 02:33:00.441
I will read it now and repeat the recommendation slide at the conclusion of the presentation.

02:33:01.341 --> 02:33:09.004
The California Department of Education and State Board of Education staff recommend that the State Board approve the revised state plan for submission to the U.S.

02:33:09.024 --> 02:33:16.327
Department of Education pending the State Board of Education Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the State Board of Education

02:33:17.007 --> 02:33:21.888
correction of any typographical errors, and necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

02:33:24.109 --> 02:33:26.790
There are four attachments related to this item.

02:33:27.330 --> 02:33:34.652
Attachment one includes an overview and summary of the accountability-related items the board will consider today, and a matrix of the U.S.

02:33:34.672 --> 02:33:39.773
Department of Education's June 11th feedback letter cross-referenced with the revised state plan.

02:33:40.753 --> 02:33:44.895
Attachment 2 is the State Plan itself, inclusive of the proposed revisions.

02:33:45.535 --> 02:33:50.857
You will note that this version includes all of the amendments approved by the State Board at the previous Board meetings.

02:33:51.577 --> 02:33:58.240
Only those changes being proposed for the SBE's approval today are reflected with brackets and strikethroughs indicating the various edits.

02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:03.762
Attachment 3 is a resource detailing state plan approval processes in the ESSA statute.

02:34:04.703 --> 02:34:08.544
And attachment 4 is a copy of the letter we received from the U.S.

02:34:08.564 --> 02:34:19.789
Department of Education from Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Jason Botel, indicating to the State Board of Education that his agency has reviewed the state plan draft before you and

02:34:20.369 --> 02:34:24.370
And should the board adopt these changes and subsequently submit this version to the U.S.

02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:29.911
Department of Education, he intends to recommend that Secretary DeVos approve California's state plan.

02:34:32.311 --> 02:34:35.992
The majority of the updates to the state plan are clarifying and technical in nature.

02:34:36.212 --> 02:34:39.513
Therefore, our comments today will focus on just three areas of feedback.

02:34:40.013 --> 02:34:44.774
The chronic absence indicator, college career indicator, and additional targeted support.

02:34:45.882 --> 02:34:52.446
The remaining minor changes are described in attachment one of the agenda materials and in attachment two, the revised state plan.

02:34:54.247 --> 02:35:03.753
Due to the fact that California cannot create a five by five grid for the chronic absence indicator because we only have one year of data from the 2016-17 school year, the U.S.

02:35:03.793 --> 02:35:08.295
Department of Education expressed their concern about this indicator in California's state plan.

02:35:08.976 --> 02:35:14.179
The second year of data from the 2017-18 school year will be available in November of this year.

02:35:14.819 --> 02:35:26.385
In order to address this issue, the CDE proposes to revise the section to indicate that California will not use this indicator for meaningful differentiation until the State Board is able to create the 5x5 grid.

02:35:27.065 --> 02:35:31.788
At that point, California will submit an amendment to the State Plan reflecting that 5x5 grid.

02:35:33.956 --> 02:35:36.418
The issue is identical for the college career indicator.

02:35:37.259 --> 02:35:48.629
Under the current timeline, staff expect to bring the 5 by 5 grids for these indicators to the state board for adoption at the November 2018 meeting and promptly submit the amended state plan with them incorporated.

02:35:49.770 --> 02:35:51.872
This is a technical change, and the U.S.

02:35:51.892 --> 02:35:57.075
Department of Education has not questioned the 5x5 grids the State Board has already approved.

02:35:57.796 --> 02:36:00.198
Therefore, we expect that this will be a straightforward review.

02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:11.226
However, there is always the possibility that some unanticipated technical issue will arise that would prevent the State Board from adopting the 5x5 grids for one or both of these indicators in November.

02:36:11.966 --> 02:36:14.010
This is the conversation we will have with the U.S.

02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:15.834
Department of Education in the fall.

02:36:16.676 --> 02:36:22.447
We will not exclude any indicators that the State Board has approved in our accountability system for the 2018 dashboard.

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:31.301
The final issue we will describe today relates to the number four on this slide, additional targeted support.

02:36:31.922 --> 02:36:37.743
My colleague Jenny Singh, Education Administrator from the Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Division, will join me in just a moment.

02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:49.986
In order to best provide a summary of the proposed changes to the additional targeted support section of the plan, I'll actually begin by taking a few steps back and describing the different types of support as authorized in the ESSA statute.

02:36:50.886 --> 02:36:57.052
The first tier or step of school identification under ESSA is comprehensive support or number one on the slide.

02:36:57.733 --> 02:37:11.366
The CDE anticipates that California will release information regarding the lowest performing 5% of Title I schools that meet California's definition of comprehensive support in conjunction of the release of the 2018 California School Dashboard.

02:37:12.046 --> 02:37:20.629
Similarly, states must identify high schools with graduation rates below 67% for comprehensive support, indicated by number two on the slide.

02:37:21.849 --> 02:37:27.812
The definition of comprehensive support remains unchanged in the version of the state plan included in your materials today.

02:37:28.792 --> 02:37:37.435
The next tier of support identified for improvement under ESSA is schools with consistently underperforming student groups, which is known as targeted support, or number three on the slide.

02:37:38.716 --> 02:37:46.600
The final tier of support and the final tier of schools identified for improvement is known as additional targeted support, number four on the slide.

02:37:47.341 --> 02:37:59.528
Schools identified for targeted support, number three, with one or more student groups performing at or below the level identified in comprehensive support will receive additional targeted support.

02:38:00.609 --> 02:38:01.610
The feedback from the U.S.

02:38:01.650 --> 02:38:11.478
Department of Education in their June 11th letter indicated that California needed to modify how the state planned to identify schools for additional targeted support in order to meet their reading of statute.

02:38:12.018 --> 02:38:16.202
My colleague Jenny Singh will now provide a summary of those changes.

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:23.553
Jenny Singh again.

02:38:24.114 --> 02:38:33.285
So I just want to very briefly go over what happens with schools when they are in certain supports.

02:38:33.906 --> 02:38:35.648
We've had a lot of conversations about this.

02:38:35.688 --> 02:38:39.853
We've had a lot of changes on how we're proposing to identify these schools.

02:38:40.193 --> 02:38:42.396
So we thought a quick review would be very helpful.

02:38:42.956 --> 02:38:50.860
So for the lowest performing 5% and schools with a graduation rate below 67%, they are identified for comprehensive support.

02:38:51.020 --> 02:38:54.682
These schools are being identified once every three years.

02:38:56.343 --> 02:39:00.965
They must develop and implement a comprehensive support and improvement plan.

02:39:02.486 --> 02:39:09.473
This plan must not only be approved by the LEA, but it also must be approved by the State Educational Agency, the SEA.

02:39:10.354 --> 02:39:14.358
So that is something that we will have to do.

02:39:14.458 --> 02:39:19.624
So the SEA must also monitor and periodically review these schools.

02:39:20.324 --> 02:39:24.408
So that is something, again, that is the responsibility of the SEA.

02:39:25.329 --> 02:39:33.032
And then they get identified for more rigorous or intensive interventions if they do not exit within four years.

02:39:33.452 --> 02:39:34.912
And that's what we've had in our plan.

02:39:35.312 --> 02:39:39.874
ESSA allows up to four years before we do more intensive interventions.

02:39:42.955 --> 02:39:46.718
So for targeted support, that's a little bit differently.

02:39:47.858 --> 02:39:52.061
Remember, there's two different types of targeted support, which can get confusing.

02:39:53.022 --> 02:39:56.344
This one is for consistently underperforming student groups.

02:39:57.044 --> 02:40:05.170
And in ESSA, ESSA allows the states to determine what the criteria are for consistently underperforming student groups.

02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:08.092
These schools are identified annually.

02:40:08.752 --> 02:40:16.780
Okay, they must develop and implement a targeted support plan for each student group that meets the identification criteria.

02:40:16.860 --> 02:40:21.946
So their plan is limited to those students that were identified, the student groups that were identified.

02:40:22.666 --> 02:40:25.670
And the plan must be approved at the LEA level.

02:40:25.910 --> 02:40:28.693
So we don't have a role in the targeted support.

02:40:30.407 --> 02:40:33.009
for the consistently underperforming student groups.

02:40:34.069 --> 02:40:37.131
Then we have the additional targeted support.

02:40:37.852 --> 02:40:53.721
And this is where, this was identified in ESSA law that these are the schools that get identified where the student groups on its own meet the same criteria that we're using to identify the lowest performing 5%.

02:40:55.402 --> 02:40:57.364
So we're using the same color combinations.

02:40:58.404 --> 02:41:02.125
Again, here they're being identified every three years.

02:41:03.806 --> 02:41:13.169
They must develop and implement a targeted support and improvement plan for each group that meets that criteria and that plan is approved by the LEA.

02:41:14.289 --> 02:41:20.431
So they get identified for comprehensive support if they do not exit within four years.

02:41:20.832 --> 02:41:22.052
That's what we have in our plan.

02:41:22.452 --> 02:41:24.873
We can go up to four years and we're taking the four years.

02:41:25.533 --> 02:41:31.154
So this group can then move on to more comprehensive support.

02:41:33.335 --> 02:41:50.959
So going back to the consistently underperforming, you have to note that we did make a change in our plan and we had to do that to be able to identify schools for the additional targeted support for 2018 dashboard as we're required to do under ESSA.

02:41:52.339 --> 02:42:00.026
So the definition is a student group that receives at least two color-coded performance ratings.

02:42:00.587 --> 02:42:07.052
And we did this because we didn't want to over-identify schools where they only had one red indicator.

02:42:07.693 --> 02:42:10.475
And that red indicator was suspension.

02:42:10.976 --> 02:42:15.200
So they have to have two color performance ratings.

02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:26.445
And on its own, it would meet the criteria, the same criteria as the Title I schools that are being identified for support, but we're using two years of data.

02:42:26.525 --> 02:42:31.567
We're gonna use the 2017 dashboard and the 2018 dashboard.

02:42:31.867 --> 02:42:37.110
So we're using two years to identify schools for consistently underperforming.

02:42:39.931 --> 02:42:41.672
And with that, I will bring back Marguerite.

02:42:45.031 --> 02:42:45.611
Thanks, Jenny.

02:42:47.492 --> 02:43:10.399
So it's worth reiterating that in the proposed changes, both the consistently underperforming section has a proposed revision as well as the additional targeted support section has a revision in order for California to begin identifying schools for additional targeted support in the 18-19 school year to align with the US Department of Education's reading of statute.

02:43:13.072 --> 02:43:14.453
So here's your recommendation again.

02:43:14.973 --> 02:43:19.555
The CDE and State Board staff recommend that the Board approve the revised plan for submission to the U.S.

02:43:19.595 --> 02:43:30.740
Department of Education pending the State Board of Education Executive Director approval of final revisions requested by the State Board, correction of any typographical errors, and necessary non-substantive clarifying edits.

02:43:31.461 --> 02:43:33.182
And from there, I'll turn it back to President Kirst.

02:43:33.262 --> 02:43:33.542
Thank you.

02:43:34.742 --> 02:43:41.464
Sorry, President Chris, this is Cindy Kazanis, Director of the Analysis Measurement and Accountability Reporting Division at the Department of Education.

02:43:41.564 --> 02:43:56.229
And just picking up from the last items discussion, I wanted to make sure that you were aware in whatever memo we give you about our work plan, there are several pieces of what has just been presented that will require us to revise the state plan, of course, once it's approved by the U.S.

02:43:56.249 --> 02:43:57.289
Department of Education.

02:43:57.349 --> 02:44:01.931
And so we'll try to do in a way that makes sense.

02:44:02.771 --> 02:44:15.278
sort of when you need to take actionable, you'll have an actionable item for those revisions for accountability purposes since that's sort of what's sort of I think not said in this in these slide decks.

02:44:15.338 --> 02:44:24.723
But since we had a robust conversation last time, I want to make sure that you are aware that we are aware of that concern and we will commit to providing that information in a transparent way.

02:44:26.304 --> 02:44:29.346
Okay, so any technical questions on this?

02:44:29.426 --> 02:44:31.327
We can, board member Burr.

02:44:33.866 --> 02:44:47.514
OK, speaking as the number one fan of federal intervention here, I really need Jenny to understand this identification issue.

02:44:47.654 --> 02:45:01.903
And you have to help me understand how this is consistent with the state's approach to accountability, which is what we always said we were going to do, was look through the lens of the state accountability system

02:45:02.783 --> 02:45:15.686
And I worry when I see all these changes here that we are gonna send substantially mixed signals to LEAs and schools about what our expectations are.

02:45:16.347 --> 02:45:21.768
So help me with that because I don't know what it's gonna mean when they get labeled.

02:45:22.088 --> 02:45:26.989
You're one of the five, all of those different targeted, comprehensive, additional targeted.

02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:29.350
What does that mean at the local level?

02:45:30.177 --> 02:45:45.616
in the context of what they're doing, and how does their plan, if I add it up, it's kind of like adding up the aggregate number of student groups, they're gonna have like 25 plans they have to do, and how does that integrate with what we're expecting them to do with an LCAP?

02:45:46.737 --> 02:45:51.421
So I think that's conversations that will happen at future board meetings.

02:45:52.142 --> 02:45:57.086
Once we have an approved plan, we can then discuss how we're going to implement that plan.

02:45:57.566 --> 02:46:05.974
But of course, we're always trying to take into consideration how to make it as easy as possible to utilize things that are already in place.

02:46:06.414 --> 02:46:08.696
So schools already develop a plan.

02:46:08.856 --> 02:46:12.738
This would just be a component that they would have to address.

02:46:13.098 --> 02:46:17.441
But again, that will come up in future conversations for implementation.

02:46:17.641 --> 02:46:20.483
So go back to the slide, because then I'm misunderstanding.

02:46:20.783 --> 02:46:32.050
It looks like if you get labeled as one of these groups that they've targeted, it says must develop, this is additional target, must develop and implement a targeted support and improvement plan.

02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:33.191
That's not a new plan?

02:46:33.591 --> 02:46:34.772
That's under their LCAP?

02:46:35.612 --> 02:46:43.699
We would like to incorporate some of this in with what we currently have, such as the LCAP plans, and all schools develop their own school plans.

02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:55.369
So it is our goal, hopefully, to use plans that we already have so that we don't cause extra burden on schools.

02:46:55.409 --> 02:46:57.551
Yeah, Dave Sapp wants to comment on this, yeah.

02:46:57.771 --> 02:47:01.555
David Sepp, State Board of Education, Deputy Policy Director and Assistant Legal Counsel.

02:47:01.575 --> 02:47:05.238
I think I'll just point back to the discussion we had in April.

02:47:05.759 --> 02:47:12.505
And there was a question, I believe it was Board Member Rucker, who said, there's a lot of stuff to be implemented that isn't in our plan.

02:47:14.006 --> 02:47:15.007
The way the law was written,

02:47:15.908 --> 02:47:19.271
There were certain things that must be captured in the state plan.

02:47:19.631 --> 02:47:24.875
There are other things that are required by the federal law that are not required to be captured in the state plan.

02:47:24.895 --> 02:47:37.584
And this is one of those examples of the exact requirements of what a quote-unquote comprehensive improvement plan or targeted support improvement plan are is actually very open-ended in the federal law.

02:47:37.984 --> 02:47:42.768
And there was no space in the state plan to actually say this is how we will implement it.

02:47:43.588 --> 02:47:52.070
And there are other examples, for example, there's the expenditure reporting requirements, there's these various report cards that we must implement in order to meet the federal law.

02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:58.252
And there is work underway, there's going to be stakeholder engagement once we hopefully have an approved plan on some of these things.

02:47:58.272 --> 02:48:06.434
Because even some of these have moved around a little bit as a result of some of these minor adjustments that we're recommending with this item.

02:48:07.314 --> 02:48:18.140
But we actually do have a memorandum, an info memo that we've been working on to sort of put out to the board once we have an approved plan of these are the outstanding implementation questions.

02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:27.385
Here's the timeline of sort of when stakeholders would have, we would expect to reach out to stakeholders, have those conversations, and here's when it must be finalized for implementation as well.

02:48:27.765 --> 02:48:30.787
But to this specific question, Board Member Burr, I think

02:48:31.647 --> 02:48:41.954
In April, there was a reference on the comprehensive support piece, which I'm just gonna scroll back briefly, about what's sort of required here.

02:48:42.674 --> 02:48:48.738
The board agenda materials in April noted that there's an opportunity within the existing LCAP process.

02:48:48.798 --> 02:49:00.226
We do expect LEAs to be looking at how their schools are doing, and if there's a school that's really struggling, there's an opportunity to sort of make that explicit in the LCAP process, so it wouldn't be something new and different.

02:49:00.846 --> 02:49:05.329
that's imposed as a separate plan, but think about how we can incorporate it into those existing processes.

02:49:05.730 --> 02:49:12.515
The same thing is true at the school level, and I think, you know, what Jenny was alluding to, there's this thing called the single plan for student achievement.

02:49:12.815 --> 02:49:16.998
Sorry, it's called different things, but we'll call it the SIPSA, because we love acronyms in ed policy.

02:49:17.658 --> 02:49:29.083
That, you know, there's an opportunity to think about how for the targeted support, which requires the LEA to approve the plan that the school develops, that's already a requirement under state law.

02:49:29.203 --> 02:49:37.087
The local governing boards must sign off on that single plan that's developed by schools, you know, at the school level involving the school site council, et cetera.

02:49:37.467 --> 02:49:42.149
So those are some of the discussions that are sort of underway, and I think there's going to be more information that'll sort of

02:49:42.449 --> 02:50:05.720
Be forthcoming for stakeholders and update to the board on those Implementation issues as well as which are actually gonna have to come back to the board for further action No, I appreciate what you just said David and I think you know looking at the Sarks looking at the sips is looking at the LCAP Addendum how these all go together.

02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:07.942
That's an opportunity for us as we move forward.

02:50:07.962 --> 02:50:08.602
I appreciate that.

02:50:08.662 --> 02:50:08.882
Thank you

02:50:11.430 --> 02:50:12.351
Board member Rucker.

02:50:14.252 --> 02:50:32.526
I also appreciate all the information that you just gave us David because yeah as I did point out in an earlier meeting there is a lot of information that we're required to implement that's not being addressed in the state plan and it bears on a lot of the questions that board member Burr is raising.

02:50:33.187 --> 02:50:40.272
I think that the other part of the question that I have is for the changes that are being required

02:50:41.522 --> 02:50:45.988
and that are being contemplated by the action the board will take on this item.

02:50:46.449 --> 02:50:58.546
How does it change the work plan for implementing these other items, especially in having conversations, say, for example, with the CPAG or in the ways that we inform the legislature?

02:50:59.066 --> 02:51:07.988
about the work of the school site council and any changes that they are making or recommending concerning the SPSA that could be contemplated on this.

02:51:08.448 --> 02:51:09.369
What are the difference?

02:51:09.469 --> 02:51:19.151
I know the SPSA guide, you can find it on other websites, the old guide, but it's not currently available at this time on the state's website.

02:51:19.591 --> 02:51:23.312
You know, so as you're doing this work, having taken the guide down,

02:51:23.852 --> 02:51:31.299
How are the, how is the public being informed on what changes are being contemplated or what has to happen in changing the guide?

02:51:31.340 --> 02:51:32.601
I think some of the questions

02:51:33.953 --> 02:51:42.541
that board member Burr is raising is really helping us to be mindful of the fact we're not done when we get this plan approved.

02:51:42.601 --> 02:51:47.345
There's still this really is a case of making a mountain out of a molehill.

02:51:47.725 --> 02:51:57.153
By comparison, the state plan itself really is, you know, dwarfed in size in comparison to the rest of the work that still remains to be done.

02:51:57.734 --> 02:52:00.196
So I'm making that comment urging

02:52:00.536 --> 02:52:23.637
that the information memo about the rest of that work maybe needs to come out sooner rather than later because I think that that would resolve some of the anxiety I have in approving this item today because I think that there's a lot of work that the state is charged to do with implementing this, that this plan still does not answer or fully address yet.

02:52:25.054 --> 02:52:27.676
I just wanted to add one thing.

02:52:28.137 --> 02:52:32.241
Although we did take the guide for the SIPSA down, it is back up.

02:52:32.321 --> 02:52:33.061
As of when?

02:52:33.081 --> 02:52:33.382
What's that?

02:52:33.402 --> 02:52:34.042
As of when?

02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:49.540
We can find out.

02:52:49.781 --> 02:52:52.103
We'll find out while you were talking.

02:52:53.425 --> 02:52:54.586
We'll find out and get back to you.

02:52:55.067 --> 02:52:58.510
I'm just going to say last time I checked it wasn't there.

02:52:58.570 --> 02:52:58.951
And we did.

02:52:58.971 --> 02:52:59.952
It was down.

02:53:00.693 --> 02:53:03.876
Because we were trying to align it more closely with LCAP.

02:53:05.274 --> 02:53:11.400
In the meantime, the superintendent has sponsored a bill, AB 716, that's working its way through.

02:53:12.841 --> 02:53:24.552
It'll still be, if it were passed and signed, it would still be SPSA, but the single changes to school plan for student achievement, because single plan was when we had these multiple state programs.

02:53:24.633 --> 02:53:25.533
It was quite a while ago.

02:53:25.553 --> 02:53:26.414
Lots of categorical.

02:53:26.795 --> 02:53:28.356
A lot of categorical programs.

02:53:29.833 --> 02:53:46.447
And what the bill language currently says is that if you follow what would be in Ed Code according to this bill, then you would meet the requirements of a CSI plan, a TSI plan.

02:53:48.249 --> 02:53:55.335
Now, to the extent that we want to include it in the LCAP, that's a discussion to have and we may want to go there, but what this bill would do,

02:53:55.751 --> 02:54:04.835
is that this would allow that to happen, because as Jenny was saying, if you were a Title I school-wide project plan, you already have to have a plan.

02:54:05.056 --> 02:54:06.696
That's a requirement by federal law.

02:54:07.037 --> 02:54:11.779
So this bill would just align kind of our state requirements with those federal requirements.

02:54:12.453 --> 02:54:22.602
And of course, there's already an Ed Code requirement that requires the superintendent of a local school district to make sure that school plans are aligned with their LCAPs.

02:54:22.663 --> 02:54:25.445
And so I'm so happy you brought up that piece of legislation.

02:54:25.505 --> 02:54:28.848
So I'm going to ask you what I hope is not a technical question.

02:54:29.289 --> 02:54:31.471
Does the legislation change

02:54:32.051 --> 02:54:48.782
the schools that are required to have this plan or so that only schools that receive federal funds are required to have this plan or will all schools in the state still be required to have a school site council that writes a school plan for student achievement?

02:54:49.182 --> 02:54:54.325
So current law does not require every school in the state to have a school plan.

02:54:55.706 --> 02:54:56.667
And what's this going to do?

02:54:56.687 --> 02:54:57.868
And this bill does not change that.

02:55:00.057 --> 02:55:12.747
And so I bring that up also because if that were, again, if it were to pass and be signed, then we would once again take down our guidance so that we could update it and make sure that those things are as aligned as possible.

02:55:14.588 --> 02:55:19.852
Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

02:55:20.193 --> 02:55:20.953
I said this before.

02:55:20.973 --> 02:55:26.097
I think the, well, I thought passing the, getting it approved was the easy part.

02:55:27.611 --> 02:55:28.571
Perlina, we're number 48.

02:55:28.671 --> 02:55:30.792
Are we with Florida?

02:55:30.812 --> 02:55:31.913
Who's that?

02:55:31.953 --> 02:55:32.193
Florida?

02:55:32.513 --> 02:55:34.194
Florida, Utah, and California.

02:55:34.214 --> 02:55:36.755
Yeah, Florida, who didn't want to include an LPI indicator.

02:55:36.775 --> 02:55:42.737
Okay, so my concern is also how do we implement this?

02:55:42.837 --> 02:55:50.681
Because when I'm looking at comprehensive support, targeted support, there's going to be notification and identification by the LEA.

02:55:51.841 --> 02:55:53.402
and the plans will go to the LEA.

02:55:54.442 --> 02:55:55.783
And there's different timelines.

02:55:55.843 --> 02:55:57.043
There's going to be three years.

02:55:57.083 --> 02:55:59.364
There's going to be annual identification.

02:55:59.905 --> 02:56:01.025
It's at the school level.

02:56:01.565 --> 02:56:05.747
At some point, though, if they don't exit in four years, they become comprehensive.

02:56:05.827 --> 02:56:10.289
And at that point, we as the SEA are the ones that have to identify.

02:56:10.309 --> 02:56:14.211
And so it will be great to see how do we communicate?

02:56:14.271 --> 02:56:16.072
How does that flow of communication

02:56:17.532 --> 02:56:32.890
happen, the different reports, templates that have to be completed, it would be great for us to see all of that because administrators and superintendents, I mean, could focus all their attention just on completing these and not actually implementing them.

02:56:34.432 --> 02:56:46.477
And then there's also expectations that I think are still a little unclear, and I know that for Title III that was raised with the LCAP addendum, and the idea that it would be a one-shot deal.

02:56:46.537 --> 02:56:50.159
You submit it, you describe your professional development, and that's it, you're done.

02:56:50.559 --> 02:56:55.141
But we know that Title III professional development changes, the activities change,

02:56:55.521 --> 02:56:57.542
So how can it be a one-time occurrence, right?

02:56:57.862 --> 02:57:11.430
And so I'm not sure if that is what is being communicated out to the field, but we also need to make sure that we understand what is the frequency that happened with the LCAP template when people thought it's three years and that's it, you could shelve it.

02:57:11.570 --> 02:57:14.952
And then we said, no, you have to update it based on your most current data.

02:57:15.373 --> 02:57:21.997
So I want that same type of guidance when it comes to the addendum, because I think there's a lot of confusion even here

02:57:23.337 --> 02:57:26.019
We're sitting here and we're very confused by this.

02:57:26.259 --> 02:57:30.402
It's a very dense policy when we're looking at LCFF and we're looking at ESSA.

02:57:30.842 --> 02:57:34.845
And some of us know both policies quite well and it's still hard to keep up with it.

02:57:35.285 --> 02:57:50.135
So if we could have a lot of information, I'm interested in the amendments, is that, does the ED have to approve those or is it we have an approved plan, these are the amendments, FYI, are they subject to approval, do we know?

02:57:51.116 --> 02:57:52.638
We do know, and the U.S.

02:57:52.658 --> 02:57:59.606
Department of Education has to approve any subsequent amendments, so there's a formal amendment approval process, just like there was under No Child Left Behind.

02:58:00.728 --> 02:58:01.729
But the U.S.

02:58:01.749 --> 02:58:06.976
Department of Education, Dave's right, hasn't laid out or clarified exactly what that process will entail.

02:58:07.443 --> 02:58:11.627
because we will be submitting amendments for some of the indicators as well as the LPI.

02:58:11.908 --> 02:58:12.308
And the U.S.

02:58:12.348 --> 02:58:16.192
Department of Education is already aware that, you know, more amendments are coming.

02:58:16.232 --> 02:58:19.275
We just have to cross this first hurdle of plan approval.

02:58:19.556 --> 02:58:23.980
What I'll say related to both Member Rutger and Ortiz-Lacombe's comments is

02:58:25.201 --> 02:58:39.376
There are a number of documents essentially sitting on my desk in draft form related to ESSA implementation, sort of guides that show much what these slides have provided of the difference between CSI, TSI, ATSI.

02:58:40.457 --> 02:58:43.660
And we keep revising them and keep holding on to them and we can't

02:58:44.040 --> 02:59:02.140
In good faith release guidance to the field because we don't yet have an approved plan so yes on one hand it was frustrating because we had to go through this exercise of revising the plan and Seeking your approval once again, but it was more deeply frustrating because it put us on hold for these various communications and notifications to the field so

02:59:03.060 --> 02:59:18.189
Hope I can assure you today that CD is working closely with board staff to develop these various materials And we are looking forward to presenting them to you at upcoming meetings as soon as we have that approved plan Thank you Yeah, okay

02:59:19.662 --> 02:59:21.123
I actually wasn't done with Jenny.

02:59:26.887 --> 02:59:28.808
I hope it's an easy question.

02:59:28.928 --> 02:59:33.591
I just want to know on what indicators will these schools be identified?

02:59:33.671 --> 02:59:38.694
Because I heard that we're putting on hold chronic absenteeism and college and career.

02:59:39.114 --> 02:59:41.416
So what are we basing the identification on?

02:59:42.512 --> 02:59:54.782
So we are putting those two indicators on hold, but it's our plan to bring those indicators to have a five by five adopted in November, and then to submit it very quickly to the U.S.

02:59:54.802 --> 03:00:00.627
Department of Education so that we could use those two indicators in the identification process.

03:00:00.907 --> 03:00:02.869
And if we don't, what are they being based on?

03:00:05.086 --> 03:00:08.308
Well, then they're based on the indicators that we currently have in place.

03:00:08.628 --> 03:00:09.209
Which are?

03:00:09.229 --> 03:00:13.672
We have suspension, we have the academic indicator, we have the graduation rate.

03:00:14.412 --> 03:00:18.996
Okay, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't just on test scores.

03:00:19.076 --> 03:00:21.377
No, it's not just on test scores.

03:00:22.138 --> 03:00:22.498
Thank you.

03:00:23.078 --> 03:00:24.880
All right.

03:00:27.041 --> 03:00:28.102
Ready for public comment.

03:00:32.622 --> 03:00:35.044
Will the following speakers please line up?

03:00:35.684 --> 03:00:43.310
Katarina Gregana, Andrea Ball, Samantha Tran, Rigel Massaro, Martha Alvarez.

03:00:53.635 --> 03:00:56.517
Caterina Gregana on behalf of CABE and Californians Together.

03:00:56.537 --> 03:01:06.185
As board member Ortiz-Licon mentioned, we are opposed to the one-time submission of the Title III addenda completed by districts with their 2018-19 LCAPs.

03:01:06.745 --> 03:01:14.972
We believe that the Title III addenda should be submitted by districts every three years with their LCAPs and updated yearly with the annual yearly reviews of the LCAPs.

03:01:15.692 --> 03:01:25.064
Language from the SSA plan describing the process minoring Title III programs and services does not state that this is a one-time occurrence, and we believe that this revision is needed.

03:01:25.344 --> 03:01:25.605
Thank you.

03:01:29.619 --> 03:01:33.203
Thank you, Andrea Ball, on behalf of the California School Boards Association.

03:01:33.684 --> 03:01:39.190
We want to thank the department, the board staff, and you board members for your stamina and continued attention to this.

03:01:40.572 --> 03:01:46.298
Really, anyway, we support submitting, making the recommended revisions, submitting it.

03:01:46.518 --> 03:01:50.403
We look forward to continuing to work with you on the implementation and the outreach and

03:01:50.863 --> 03:01:56.651
particularly what is the system of support and the support for the Title I schools identified going to look like.

03:01:57.111 --> 03:02:00.155
CSBA looks forward to joining you in that effort.

03:02:00.455 --> 03:02:00.736
Thank you.

03:02:06.829 --> 03:02:09.091
Morning, Rigel Massara with Public Advocates.

03:02:09.171 --> 03:02:13.675
We also urge approval and submission of the state ESSA plan.

03:02:14.356 --> 03:02:21.802
We do ask that the board and the department have robust stakeholder engagement around the development of the local federal plans.

03:02:22.663 --> 03:02:28.267
The LCFF Equity Coalition certainly looks forward to working with staff and members on that process.

03:02:28.307 --> 03:02:28.628
Thank you.

03:02:32.796 --> 03:02:37.019
Good morning, Marta Alvarez on behalf of AXA, the Association of California School Administrators.

03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:43.645
We also are in support of the revisions that are being proposed today and urge the state board to adopt the revised plan.

03:02:44.405 --> 03:02:49.930
We also would like to comment specifically to member Burr's comments.

03:02:50.370 --> 03:02:52.332
regarding the implementation of the plan.

03:02:53.092 --> 03:03:06.844
Our members, administrators who are the ones responsible for doing any improvement plans, any of the reporting and communication to the public, they are interested in better understanding how does this federal requirements fit and align with California's accountability system.

03:03:07.625 --> 03:03:14.771
To that end, we would like to welcome any opportunity to collaborate to do a webinar or some communication to the field and the public

03:03:15.171 --> 03:03:20.836
In the fall, once we have more information about the alignment and integration between the federal and state accountability system.

03:03:21.276 --> 03:03:23.778
As we know, this plan has been a long time coming.

03:03:24.199 --> 03:03:30.444
And so now once we have it approved, it would be really important to talk about the implementation challenges or any questions that the field might have.

03:03:30.804 --> 03:03:31.145
Thank you.

03:03:36.683 --> 03:03:39.905
Good morning, LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

03:03:40.286 --> 03:03:40.626
Excuse me.

03:03:41.066 --> 03:03:47.431
I want to take a moment to thank State Board and Department staff for their diligence and patience in moving this forward.

03:03:47.451 --> 03:03:53.815
I don't know that we would have gotten here if you hadn't had the key folks involved that have been doing this great work.

03:03:54.275 --> 03:03:55.676
I'm glad it wasn't me.

03:03:55.696 --> 03:04:02.601
I also want to say we support the action being taken today relative to the plan.

03:04:03.301 --> 03:04:12.585
And I want to echo the comments from my colleague from AXA relative to sharing information with the field and being a partner with you to get that information out there.

03:04:13.066 --> 03:04:14.947
We would be happy also to host webinars.

03:04:15.407 --> 03:04:17.768
And I think it would be very helpful to have

03:04:18.468 --> 03:04:27.950
Something that could be shared that explains what is required under the plan and then what other requirements there are that are not part of the plan so folks kind of see the universe.

03:04:29.111 --> 03:04:42.994
And I also think it's important, you know, the department has a bill, ACSA has a bill relative to some of the plans that are required that we keep in mind with the CPSA, with the LCAP and the addition of the federal addendum.

03:04:43.614 --> 03:04:50.259
and the fiscal transparency document and some of these other things, sort of the burden and the balance with capacity.

03:04:50.499 --> 03:04:50.819
Thank you.

03:04:55.562 --> 03:04:56.022
Good morning.

03:04:56.082 --> 03:05:07.850
Samantha Tran with Children Now and we support the staff's recommendation to approve the plan and move it forward and look forward to working with you and the CDE team to work on the implementation pieces.

03:05:08.130 --> 03:05:08.611
Thank you so much.

03:05:12.446 --> 03:05:14.968
Any further discussion or need a motion on this?

03:05:17.510 --> 03:05:18.030
Go ahead.

03:05:18.110 --> 03:05:19.811
Well, first of all, thank the staff.

03:05:19.871 --> 03:05:24.515
Thank the great conversation we had here and our stakeholders for their input as well.

03:05:25.836 --> 03:05:27.157
Very frustrating process.

03:05:27.277 --> 03:05:27.757
I get it.

03:05:28.418 --> 03:05:34.202
And as the liaison for ESSA, it is extremely frustrating that this had to come back again to us.

03:05:35.663 --> 03:05:46.272
And I agree too that there is a myriad and a slew of implementation issues that we still need to work on and in providing information to stakeholders as well.

03:05:46.853 --> 03:05:52.658
However, we cannot move forward in any of that unless we move forward to get this plan approved.

03:05:53.058 --> 03:06:03.170
And from what I have seen in discussions with staff in looking at this proposal, it does not take California off track of where we are going.

03:06:03.470 --> 03:06:08.696
It puts a few little speed bumps in the way, but it does not take us off track.

03:06:09.156 --> 03:06:12.280
So I will move the staff recommendation.

03:06:14.031 --> 03:06:14.211
Okay.

03:06:14.251 --> 03:06:15.191
Moved and seconded.

03:06:15.331 --> 03:06:16.652
Any further board discussion?

03:06:17.672 --> 03:06:17.852
Not.

03:06:17.892 --> 03:06:19.272
All those in favor, raise your hands.

03:06:19.592 --> 03:06:20.072
Okay.

03:06:20.393 --> 03:06:20.833
Thank you.

03:06:23.173 --> 03:06:27.694
And now we're, now we're on to, well, don't, we saw it last time.

03:06:30.855 --> 03:06:31.935
Yeah.

03:06:33.236 --> 03:06:42.538
So we're now on to item three, the request for the contract with ETS and UC Santa Cruz.

03:06:43.117 --> 03:06:43.637
Good morning.

03:06:44.838 --> 03:06:46.278
Michelle Center, Director.

03:06:48.919 --> 03:06:50.159
Take down the PowerPoint.

03:06:53.140 --> 03:06:53.660
Keep going.

03:06:53.921 --> 03:06:54.181
Yeah.

03:06:54.681 --> 03:06:54.741
OK.

03:06:54.761 --> 03:06:56.401
Does that work for you?

03:06:56.421 --> 03:06:56.962
Thank you.

03:07:00.851 --> 03:07:25.466
This is an action item before you that asks the board to authorize the CDE to begin the process of negotiating an amendment to the Educational Testing Services CASP contract and to authorize the CDE to enter into negotiations with UC Santa Cruz to provide an educator reporting system for the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, or ELPAC, as well as other CASP assessments.

03:07:26.326 --> 03:07:38.387
When the governor signed this year's state budget on June 27th, over $54 million was allocated for the development of a computer-based assessment for LPAC, as well as the development of an alternate assessment for LPAC.

03:07:39.577 --> 03:07:46.785
With me in the audience today, in case you have questions or comments, we have representatives from both ETS and UC Santa Cruz.

03:07:47.286 --> 03:07:52.291
John Oswald is vice president at ETS over student and teacher assessments.

03:07:52.932 --> 03:07:59.199
And then Tony Alpert, the executive director of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium at UC Santa Cruz is also here.

03:08:00.498 --> 03:08:08.984
We are excited for this opportunity to more fully develop our LPAC program consistent with our long-term vision for California statewide assessments.

03:08:09.905 --> 03:08:24.094
Key to this vision is a comprehensive technology infrastructure, which is to say a unique network of software and programs that manage assessment production, registration, delivery, data storage and reporting, and educator resources.

03:08:24.955 --> 03:08:32.565
The goal of the infrastructure is to contain a series of integrated modules that appear to users as a single integrated system.

03:08:33.546 --> 03:08:40.075
Once logged in, users should be able to navigate the various components of our system securely and seamlessly.

03:08:41.096 --> 03:08:42.456
I know Member Sunk likes that part.

03:08:43.157 --> 03:08:48.538
In 2016, the Smarter Balanced Technology Hosting Solution project was completed.

03:08:49.318 --> 03:08:54.200
This implemented a technology infrastructure for the Smarter Balanced assessments in California.

03:08:55.120 --> 03:09:06.563
In response to that project, the California legislature then revised education code to require that all California computer-based assessments utilize that same infrastructure when feasible.

03:09:08.086 --> 03:09:20.019
California has since expanded the use of that infrastructure to support the implementation of other state tests, such as our California alternate assessments, as well as our tests for science.

03:09:21.020 --> 03:09:29.149
The expansion of that infrastructure has been successful, with over 16 million assessments administered on that infrastructure just last school year.

03:09:30.347 --> 03:09:38.879
It is important to also note that the department has been investigating the transition of the LPAC to a computer-based test for some time.

03:09:39.940 --> 03:09:46.029
This is a transition that the majority of states have already taken for their English language proficiency assessments.

03:09:47.310 --> 03:10:00.235
In June 2016, the CDE directed our LPAC contractor, ETS, to conduct a study on the feasibility of transitioning the LPAC from a paper-pencil test to a computer-based assessment.

03:10:00.975 --> 03:10:07.698
The final report was presented to the State Board in June 2017 and is posted on our CDE website.

03:10:09.764 --> 03:10:18.242
In the first part of 2018, the CDE engaged in conversations and gathered feedback regarding the LPAC transition to a computer-based test.

03:10:19.144 --> 03:10:36.114
We gathered input from the LPAC Technical Advisory Group, the CISC Regional Assessment Network, the Bilingual Coordinators Network, our Statewide Assessment Group, which contains representatives from many educational associations, as well as the Advisory Commission on Special Education.

03:10:36.834 --> 03:10:45.559
These groups expressed support for the potential transition of the LPAC from paper-pencil to a computer-based assessment as a step in the right direction for that assessment.

03:10:46.806 --> 03:10:53.832
The CDE looks forward to continued collaboration with those stakeholder groups to inform the transition to a computer-based LPAC.

03:10:54.953 --> 03:10:58.656
Additionally, the CDE looks forward to negotiating a thoughtful transition.

03:10:59.257 --> 03:11:05.322
The computer-based assessment for LPAC should use differing approaches to ensure student access and success.

03:11:06.735 --> 03:11:11.537
The department also looks forward to negotiating a contract to expand our educator reporting system.

03:11:12.217 --> 03:11:22.541
We currently use the UC Santa Cruz educator reporting system for our Smarter Balanced interim assessments and we've received great feedback from our educators here in California.

03:11:23.542 --> 03:11:34.126
The expansion would include both LPAC onto that system as well as other CASP assessments that are not yet utilizing that educator reporting system.

03:11:35.782 --> 03:11:43.024
This expansion fits with our vision of an infrastructure for our educators that is seamless and supports the local use of assessment results.

03:11:44.685 --> 03:11:49.488
In support of the vision, the CDE recommends the following actions that support this incorporation.

03:11:50.028 --> 03:12:02.594
One, direct the CDE in consultation with staff from the State Board as well as Department of Finance to negotiate an amendment to the current ETS CAS contract to include work related to administering the LPAC.

03:12:03.355 --> 03:12:05.496
Amend the contract end date from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2022.

03:12:10.038 --> 03:12:13.802
Ensure the following activities are included in the amended scope of work.

03:12:14.643 --> 03:12:24.092
Transitioning the initial and summative LPAC from a paper-pencil test to a computer-based assessment with students and test examiner interfaces where appropriate.

03:12:25.093 --> 03:12:30.318
Ongoing administrations of the paper and pencil LPAC until the computer-based LPAC is complete.

03:12:31.576 --> 03:12:39.702
Activities associated with developing the alternate LPAC, which is a computer-based assessment for students who cannot participate in the current LPAC.

03:12:40.843 --> 03:12:44.646
Ongoing administration of components of the CASP system through the 21-22 school year.

03:12:47.381 --> 03:12:55.208
and direct the CDE to present that draft contract to you at your November 2018 board meeting.

03:12:55.328 --> 03:12:57.750
I'm sure I will look very tired at that meeting.

03:12:59.172 --> 03:13:03.516
For the interagency agreement, the UC Santa Cruz agreement, the CDE recommends the following.

03:13:03.996 --> 03:13:12.868
That you authorize the CDE to enter into negotiations with UC Santa Cruz to provide an educator reporting system for the LPAC and other assessments as appropriate.

03:13:13.669 --> 03:13:19.657
Direct the CDE to present a draft interagency agreement to you at that same November board meeting.

03:13:20.558 --> 03:13:34.961
The final negotiated budgets for ETS and UC Santa Cruz collectively will not exceed $279,862,456 and is subject to appropriation by the legislature.

03:13:38.862 --> 03:13:46.344
So I am happy to answer questions or also happy to bring up representatives from either of those organizations to answer questions.

03:13:48.485 --> 03:13:49.485
Questions from anybody?

03:13:52.364 --> 03:13:54.005
Okay, let's have the public comment.

03:13:55.346 --> 03:13:56.466
We have one speaker.

03:13:56.486 --> 03:13:59.488
Doug McRae, would you please come to the podium?

03:14:06.452 --> 03:14:07.072
Still morning.

03:14:07.653 --> 03:14:11.335
I'm Doug McRae, a retired testing specialist from Monterey.

03:14:12.015 --> 03:14:20.240
I'd support the merging of the two contracts, but I would not support a recommended two-year sole source extension for the merged contract.

03:14:21.274 --> 03:14:26.878
The current expiration for CASP is after the 2020 test administration year.

03:14:27.819 --> 03:14:43.510
An open bid process for a merged contract for initiation at the beginning of the 2021 school year would generate fresh perspectives and varied vendor experiences and expertise, as well as likely cost reductions in the tens of millions of dollars.

03:14:44.410 --> 03:14:46.672
Additional detail on how a merged contract

03:14:47.213 --> 03:14:58.596
would operate over the next two years, as well as elements to be included in an open competition in early 2020, are included in materials submitted to your electronic folder last week.

03:14:58.996 --> 03:15:08.058
So the only thing I'm talking about is the extension of the contract in 2020 up to 2022 on a sole source basis.

03:15:08.678 --> 03:15:08.938
Thank you.

03:15:11.471 --> 03:15:13.272
That ends the public comment.

03:15:14.533 --> 03:15:34.565
I have a question for Michelle and maybe you can't answer it all, but there is a bill moving through the legislature, Assembly Bill 1951, which would allow school districts to substitute ACT or SAT or other approved exams for the Smarter Balanced assessment.

03:15:35.546 --> 03:15:37.067
And I notice that we're merging

03:15:38.087 --> 03:15:46.411
LPAC into a smarter balanced and all one system, does that have any effect?

03:15:46.571 --> 03:15:54.514
I mean, I don't think SAT or ACT were ever designed to do this business.

03:15:54.594 --> 03:16:00.597
Is there anything that you could say about that might cause problems?

03:16:01.758 --> 03:16:06.970
Since it's an integrated system that then culminates with ACT or SAT.

03:16:10.222 --> 03:16:20.410
So just to clarify what we mean by integrated system, the LPAC program and the CASP program are still separate programs in EdCode.

03:16:20.851 --> 03:16:24.554
They're still separate programs in terms of our California Code of Regulations.

03:16:24.614 --> 03:16:26.816
So these two programs still exist.

03:16:27.656 --> 03:16:38.726
The integration is within a contract, which allows us to leverage the work that is already being done in our CASP program to more fully support our LPAC program.

03:16:39.386 --> 03:16:49.854
So, for example, right now we have difficulties in trying to combine trainings to our educators because of how the money is associated and the fact that it's over two contracts.

03:16:50.334 --> 03:16:56.259
Right now we could have, in the future, training where we're talking about both LPAC and CASP at the same time.

03:16:56.639 --> 03:16:58.000
So we're talking about leveraging things.

03:16:58.040 --> 03:17:02.003
We're not talking about combining assessments in any way.

03:17:02.664 --> 03:17:05.246
The assessments still are separate.

03:17:05.706 --> 03:17:14.895
So I don't believe that the combination within a single contract of LPAC and CASP relates to the 1951 bill.

03:17:14.975 --> 03:17:18.358
It does relate or does not?

03:17:18.418 --> 03:17:18.899
Does not.

03:17:19.119 --> 03:17:19.600
Does not.

03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:19.980
Okay.

03:17:21.341 --> 03:17:24.824
Other questions from the board?

03:17:25.825 --> 03:17:26.505
Board member Burr?

03:17:26.606 --> 03:17:38.715
So just to clarify, Michelle, it sounds like you're also trying to use a common platform, especially now that we're moving the paper and pencil test for LPAC onto a digital platform, right?

03:17:40.797 --> 03:17:45.721
So do you want to, could you just say a little more about the proposed extension on the contract?

03:17:46.882 --> 03:17:50.345
What you see the benefits are of extending the current contract?

03:17:50.986 --> 03:17:52.411
Sure, and just to...

03:17:54.522 --> 03:18:04.429
clarify the funding amount includes funding for LPAC all the way back to 18-19, which we currently have a contract with ETS for that time period.

03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:10.614
We would end that contract so that we could enter into this more combined integrated contract.

03:18:10.634 --> 03:18:16.418
So in case that wasn't clear in the budgeted amount, I wanted to clarify that, Member Burr.

03:18:17.319 --> 03:18:21.221
So the question about integration

03:18:22.122 --> 03:18:41.203
Question about extending existing contract versus going out with a new So the rationale for extending the contract the rationale for extending the contract is a concern about this major transition that we are Implementing going from a paper-based assessment to a computer-based assessment is a major transition and

03:18:42.845 --> 03:18:48.114
There is concern about a change in contractor while we're in the middle of such a major transition.

03:18:48.214 --> 03:18:55.927
So that is the reasoning why we have also recommended a two-year extension is so that we can get through that transition period.

03:18:59.075 --> 03:19:01.337
I'm prepared to make a motion if there aren't other questions.

03:19:01.357 --> 03:19:01.958
Okay, go ahead.

03:19:02.538 --> 03:19:04.600
So I would move the department's recommendation.

03:19:04.660 --> 03:19:07.382
Michelle read it to you, but it's quite a long one.

03:19:07.422 --> 03:19:16.629
It deals with both the transition to the electronic form for LPAC as well as the Santa Cruz contract and the two-year extension.

03:19:17.249 --> 03:19:24.491
And I'll just say in making the motion that I am very pleased with the progress we've made in our testing system.

03:19:24.531 --> 03:19:28.273
I think we have wonderful partners with ETS and with Smarter Balanced.

03:19:28.313 --> 03:19:32.274
So, I would move this recommendation without hesitation.

03:19:32.294 --> 03:19:34.935
Okay, second.

03:19:35.455 --> 03:19:36.495
Any further discussion?

03:19:37.556 --> 03:19:39.236
Not all those in favor, raise your hands.

03:19:39.616 --> 03:19:40.757
Okay, that's approved.

03:19:40.837 --> 03:19:41.237
Thank you.

03:19:41.817 --> 03:19:43.178
All right, the board will recess.

03:19:43.258 --> 03:19:44.238
We have lunch and

03:19:48.629 --> 03:19:56.555
Okay, so the board will recess till 1215 and then we'll get our lunch and come back.

03:20:06.923 --> 03:20:09.765
The State Board will reconvene and we're now ready for item 4.

03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:23.477
Michelle Center, Director of the Assessment Development and Administration Division.

03:20:24.018 --> 03:20:32.553
Item 4 is asking for your approval on amendments to the California Code of Regulations related to our LPAC assessment.

03:20:33.487 --> 03:20:52.152
Specifically, the item asks the board to approve the finding of emergency, approve the proposed amended emergency regulations, direct the CDE to circulate the required notice of proposed emergency action, and submit the emergency regulations to the Office of Administrative Law for approval.

03:20:53.012 --> 03:21:03.457
and authorize the CDE to take any necessary action to respond to any direction or concern expressed by the Office of Administrative Law during its review of these documents.

03:21:04.497 --> 03:21:07.118
I'd like to highlight several changes to the regulations.

03:21:07.659 --> 03:21:12.781
The first changes will align the LPAC with the Every Student Succeed Act or ESSA.

03:21:13.461 --> 03:21:21.785
The CDE clarified that ESSA allows only students with the most significant cognitive disabilities to be eligible for an alternate assessment.

03:21:22.802 --> 03:21:30.785
Therefore, the CDE is ensuring that only students with IEPs are eligible for the alternate assessment in these proposed regulations.

03:21:31.865 --> 03:21:42.929
Another proposed change to the regulation consistent with federal flexibility will allow an IEP or Section 504 team to exempt a student from a domain.

03:21:44.189 --> 03:21:49.573
in which no accommodation to that domain is accessible to the student.

03:21:50.313 --> 03:21:57.298
So an example of that would be an English learner with a visual impairment who is not yet familiar with Braille.

03:21:57.858 --> 03:22:00.660
They would be unable to access the reading domain.

03:22:00.920 --> 03:22:04.062
Therefore, they could have an exemption for the reading domain.

03:22:05.123 --> 03:22:15.531
If the IEP team made that determination to exempt them from the reading domain, they would still receive a calculated overall score based on the other three domains.

03:22:16.091 --> 03:22:24.078
The student would also receive a written language score based on performance in the writing domain as well as an estimated reading domain score.

03:22:25.228 --> 03:22:38.652
If the student continues as an English learner, they may be assessed in their reading domain using Braille at a later time if the IEP team determines that it is appropriate to assess them in reading at that time.

03:22:39.912 --> 03:22:48.435
Next, there are proposed revisions and additions to accessibility resources, including our universal tools, designated supports, and accommodations.

03:22:52.222 --> 03:22:53.404
examples of these changes.

03:22:54.024 --> 03:23:00.051
One would be allowing the use of American Sign Language as a mode of communication for our listening and speaking domains.

03:23:00.752 --> 03:23:02.934
This is already allowed for our writing prompts now.

03:23:03.975 --> 03:23:10.523
Allowing highlighting and marking in the textbooks and repeating and pausing audio for our listening domain.

03:23:11.744 --> 03:23:19.493
Finally, the CDE is proposing to eliminate the apportionment deadlines for test administration reports by our local educational agencies.

03:23:20.234 --> 03:23:28.944
This will eliminate the waiver process for apportionment, which we hope to be a benefit to all of us, LEAs, the CDE, as well as the State Board.

03:23:30.464 --> 03:23:39.586
A complete list of bulleted changes can be found in the board item as well as the justification for the emergency process can be found in the finding of emergency.

03:23:40.726 --> 03:23:48.348
You will note based on the changes that I have just documented, these regulations do not pertain to a computer-based assessment.

03:23:48.708 --> 03:23:49.888
Just want to clarify that.

03:23:49.948 --> 03:23:53.729
These are for our current paper pencil administrations of our LPAC.

03:23:55.229 --> 03:23:56.250
That is all I have.

03:23:56.430 --> 03:23:57.770
I am open for questions.

03:23:59.246 --> 03:24:00.586
Board Member Ortiz.

03:24:03.767 --> 03:24:04.207
Thank you.

03:24:04.227 --> 03:24:11.248
I have a question about accepting the students from certain domains and how do we then calculate?

03:24:11.288 --> 03:24:15.809
So let's say that there are only administer the assessment in three out of the four domains.

03:24:16.089 --> 03:24:17.650
So how do we weight that?

03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:19.830
How does a teacher interpret that data?

03:24:19.850 --> 03:24:22.350
Can you give us an example or walk us through that?

03:24:22.691 --> 03:24:24.871
Of course, my psychometricians have left the building.

03:24:28.690 --> 03:24:44.097
So we use all of the information that we have about the student, as well as information that we have about all students, so that we know, typically, a student who has this type of scoring would normally, typically, receive this type of scoring reading.

03:24:44.197 --> 03:24:50.339
For example, if we use my reading example, then we would use that estimated reading score in the calculation.

03:24:50.479 --> 03:24:55.782
It would have the same type of weighting in that score as if it was an administered reading test.

03:24:56.882 --> 03:24:59.723
That being said, of course, I think you are correct.

03:24:59.763 --> 03:25:09.127
We should ensure in any guidance document that we put out that they should take that into consideration when they are making decisions about students and reclassification.

03:25:09.627 --> 03:25:12.468
So happy to make sure that we address that in our documents.

03:25:15.103 --> 03:25:20.807
And just to clarify, we also have the permanent regulations that are before us, but those went to consent.

03:25:21.267 --> 03:25:27.971
However, any changes we do to the emergency regulations will also be reflected on the permanent regulations.

03:25:29.983 --> 03:25:36.667
So I'm not sure if you make changes in these, if we could, we may have to pull it off consent.

03:25:36.708 --> 03:25:39.149
I would, I'm looking to Judy.

03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:40.170
I don't know that we would.

03:25:40.250 --> 03:25:45.253
If there are no changes, then the fact that the next one is on consent would be no problem.

03:25:45.894 --> 03:25:48.796
Yeah, I don't anticipate any, but there goes David Saab.

03:26:02.003 --> 03:26:06.287
So what he just said was that the two items are consistent.

03:26:06.307 --> 03:26:12.192
So if you approve the emergency regs before you, they are identical to the permanent reg package in the item that is on consent.

03:26:20.258 --> 03:26:20.759
They both go out.

03:26:21.698 --> 03:26:22.178
comment period.

03:26:22.439 --> 03:26:23.579
Any other board comments?

03:26:24.940 --> 03:26:26.882
Board member Valdez.

03:26:27.923 --> 03:26:34.488
No, I appreciate this whole process and there's such a need for what this is going to do and so I thank you for the work that you're doing.

03:26:37.790 --> 03:26:39.291
Okay, any public comment?

03:26:40.752 --> 03:26:42.814
Okay, do I have a motion?

03:26:46.016 --> 03:26:46.337
Go ahead.

03:26:49.614 --> 03:26:51.755
motion to move the department's recommendation.

03:26:52.416 --> 03:26:52.996
And I'll second.

03:26:55.558 --> 03:26:58.219
Hearing no further discussion, raise our hands.

03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:00.100
That is approved.

03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:00.700
OK.

03:27:02.181 --> 03:27:03.942
And now we're on to the waivers.

03:27:04.183 --> 03:27:08.025
And I understand two of the waivers have been pulled.

03:27:08.045 --> 03:27:12.347
And so we will both waiver.

03:27:14.569 --> 03:27:15.689
Eileen has to recuse.

03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:17.250
Eileen what?

03:27:17.730 --> 03:27:18.691
She has to recuse herself.

03:27:19.326 --> 03:27:21.508
Oh, okay.

03:27:26.772 --> 03:27:28.913
Board member Strauss has recused herself.

03:27:29.074 --> 03:27:33.317
So we have the consent calendar.

03:27:33.597 --> 03:27:42.544
And so we have on consent, waiver one, waiver two, and waiver four through 22.

03:27:42.584 --> 03:27:42.784
And so

03:27:48.722 --> 03:28:00.952
we can have a motion for Waivers 1 to Waiver 4 through W22 and we will hear Waiver 3.

03:28:06.777 --> 03:28:07.678
Any public comment?

03:28:09.042 --> 03:28:09.282
Okay.

03:28:09.382 --> 03:28:11.064
All those in favor, raise your hands.

03:28:12.264 --> 03:28:12.545
Okay.

03:28:12.585 --> 03:28:15.447
And Waiver 3, I think Eileen Strauss can return.

03:28:16.828 --> 03:28:21.832
So we're going to hear that one and the department will present on Waiver 3.

03:28:23.353 --> 03:28:24.394
Lisa?

03:28:25.474 --> 03:28:25.995
Good afternoon.

03:28:26.015 --> 03:28:27.996
Lisa Constancia from the Charter Schools Division.

03:28:28.016 --> 03:28:30.998
I'm here to present Waiver Number 3.

03:28:31.599 --> 03:28:37.663
It is a request from Contra Costa County Office of Education on behalf of the Golden Gate Charter School.

03:28:38.664 --> 03:28:54.132
And they are requesting to waive a portion of the California Code of Regulations Title 5, Section 11963.6 in order to allow the charter school to request a non-classroom based funding determination for the respective funding time period.

03:28:55.052 --> 03:28:59.835
Golden Gate submitted a determination request after the December 1 deadline.

03:29:00.215 --> 03:29:08.679
So because they missed the deadline, they do have to submit a waiver to allow them to submit the actual funding determination.

03:29:08.719 --> 03:29:12.762
So the waiver has to be approved by the board before they can submit a funding determination.

03:29:13.602 --> 03:29:25.770
So this waiver is to allow Golden Gate, whose first year of operation was 17-18, to submit a retroactive funding request that would cover the period from July 1, 2017 through June 2019.

03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:36.616
If the waiver is approved by the board, then the school may submit a retroactive funding determination for consideration by the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools and then by the State Board of Education.

03:29:37.137 --> 03:29:40.599
CDE staff is recommending approval and I'm here if you have any questions.

03:29:42.731 --> 03:29:47.065
Any board discussion on this item?

03:29:47.547 --> 03:29:48.370
Board member Rucker.

03:29:52.591 --> 03:30:03.496
You know, I recognize that the approval of the waiver of the timeline to apply for the funding determination is purely a ceremonious thing to be done.

03:30:03.956 --> 03:30:19.723
But my concern remains that we continue to have these requests from charters that do understand and do know that these deadlines are in place in the same way that we have school districts that make these requests for adjustments on

03:30:20.163 --> 03:30:23.468
Submitting chart submitting waivers concerning their testing

03:30:25.093 --> 03:30:25.814
apportionments.

03:30:26.214 --> 03:30:37.201
You know, I just think that at a certain point in time, there should be some accountability in the management of this process and in the work that goes on because we continue to see these requests every single year.

03:30:37.722 --> 03:30:39.182
And in some cases, we continue.

03:30:39.323 --> 03:30:45.807
While this is not a repeat offender, my concern is we also continue to see these requests coming.

03:30:46.167 --> 03:30:53.412
And there doesn't seem to be any determination or any work done to try to make sure there's some improvements so that we don't continue to see these.

03:30:54.172 --> 03:31:06.815
Can you tell me if there's any conversation with this LEA or with any of the LEAs that keep making these requests about what this means and about what their responsibilities or obligations are to do this in a timely way?

03:31:08.375 --> 03:31:19.137
What we do in our normal process is we do actually take a look at each year those that are coming up that will need to come up to back to the board for a funding determination.

03:31:19.577 --> 03:31:22.842
So on a yearly basis, we do take a look at those.

03:31:23.162 --> 03:31:26.126
We start emailing them to let them know when the deadlines are.

03:31:26.827 --> 03:31:29.190
The December 1st deadline is for new schools.

03:31:29.711 --> 03:31:33.796
There's a February deadline for those that have been in operation more than a year.

03:31:35.158 --> 03:31:37.419
So we do send out email reminders.

03:31:38.140 --> 03:31:42.864
As we start getting closer, we continue to check our lists to see who we still haven't received.

03:31:42.884 --> 03:31:44.325
Hi, Judy.

03:31:44.546 --> 03:31:47.328
Okay, who we still haven't received a funding determination from.

03:31:47.688 --> 03:31:55.175
So we do make an effort to try and contact them and let them know when the deadlines are and those that we still haven't received a funding determination from.

03:31:56.115 --> 03:31:58.998
But that is kind of the best effort that we do.

03:31:59.038 --> 03:32:02.641
But we do have communication with them to remind them of the deadlines.

03:32:04.028 --> 03:32:07.129
So this is Judy Sias, Chief Counsel with the State Board.

03:32:07.189 --> 03:32:10.430
I would say that the number of waivers has gone down every year.

03:32:10.550 --> 03:32:13.471
So one thing we have looked at is this is just one waiver this time.

03:32:13.911 --> 03:32:21.074
So I would say, you know, CDE has made a real effort to communicate more proactively, like you asked for, like Lisa said, with these charter schools.

03:32:21.094 --> 03:32:23.575
So this is a new charter school that just started last year.

03:32:23.595 --> 03:32:28.817
So they, you know, so I would say that, you know, there have been a lot of efforts and it is improving.

03:32:29.737 --> 03:32:30.057
Thank you.

03:32:31.658 --> 03:32:32.918
Board Member Valdez, did you have

03:32:34.893 --> 03:32:35.774
Just a quick question.

03:32:36.294 --> 03:32:36.935
It might have been in there.

03:32:36.955 --> 03:32:39.577
I don't think I saw it, but why did they miss the deadline?

03:32:40.998 --> 03:32:41.799
Let me check that.

03:32:47.775 --> 03:32:48.676
They're in the waiver.

03:32:48.696 --> 03:33:04.949
They've stated they weren't aware of the December 1st deadline and since they are a new school We do hear that with the new schools that sometimes they're not aware of when they when they do need to submit the funding determination Because they do get advanced funding Through through our fiscal services.

03:33:04.990 --> 03:33:07.532
They do get advanced funding and then in October

03:33:08.272 --> 03:33:12.896
You know, then we start checking those in October, then they submit their attendance reporting to us.

03:33:12.976 --> 03:33:15.058
And as you know, how that goes through.

03:33:15.319 --> 03:33:16.520
So they're receiving the funding.

03:33:16.560 --> 03:33:24.607
In some cases, as new schools, they don't realize that they've missed a deadline to submit a funding determination to us so they can continue to get their funding.

03:33:25.167 --> 03:33:33.074
So Apropos of the comment you made in response to my question, they received an email from you advising you that this deadline was coming up.

03:33:33.855 --> 03:33:44.771
And they're saying, and that's the reason why I asked the question, they're saying in their waiver application they didn't know, and this is despite the fact that you sent them an email saying, please be advised.

03:33:45.252 --> 03:33:46.454
So what is it they didn't know?

03:33:46.494 --> 03:33:48.858
That they need to read the email or that you meant business?

03:33:50.219 --> 03:33:51.160
I'm not sure.

03:33:53.682 --> 03:34:08.434
They just do state that they were not aware of the deadline and their fiscal office calendars didn't update the indicator and they now have it updated as a high priority for them so that they have made changes in sounds like in so that they won't this won't happen again.

03:34:09.435 --> 03:34:09.555
OK.

03:34:09.595 --> 03:34:09.995
All right.

03:34:11.577 --> 03:34:12.377
All right.

03:34:12.477 --> 03:34:13.758
Any public comment on this.

03:34:14.619 --> 03:34:14.979
All right.

03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:16.421
Ready for a motion.

03:34:16.441 --> 03:34:19.023
Oh that's public comment.

03:34:19.043 --> 03:34:19.263
Sorry.

03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:24.930
Hi, Angela DeRamos representing California Teachers Association.

03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:33.593
Because there are no mitigating circumstances for missing the filing deadline, CTA recommends denial of this waiver.

03:34:34.333 --> 03:34:37.834
If I were late on my taxes, I would have to pay a penalty.

03:34:38.235 --> 03:34:47.978
And in this case, when things are not late or things are not put in order when they're supposed to be put, I just worry that the kids eventually will lose because what else is not going to be put in place?

03:34:48.218 --> 03:34:48.478
Thank you.

03:34:50.438 --> 03:34:52.799
Okay, that's the end of the public testimony.

03:34:53.940 --> 03:34:55.140
Ready for a motion on this.

03:35:15.191 --> 03:35:15.951
I move approval.

03:35:17.572 --> 03:35:18.753
Okay, moved and seconded.

03:35:19.423 --> 03:35:20.903
All those in favor, raise your hands.

03:35:22.324 --> 03:35:26.424
Okay, now we're on to the proposed consent calendar.

03:35:26.544 --> 03:35:38.827
These are items 5 through 15, 5 through 15.

03:35:42.528 --> 03:35:44.548
All those items are on the consent calendar.

03:35:44.568 --> 03:35:48.629
Do we have any public testimony on the consent calendar?

03:35:49.580 --> 03:35:49.840
No.

03:35:52.302 --> 03:35:54.224
I move approval of the consent calendar.

03:35:54.244 --> 03:35:58.347
All right.

03:35:58.387 --> 03:35:59.368
No further discussion.

03:35:59.468 --> 03:36:00.949
All those in favor, raise your hands.

03:36:00.969 --> 03:36:03.071
Okay, that's approved.

03:36:03.972 --> 03:36:06.034
So now we're on to the public hearing.

03:36:08.456 --> 03:36:18.404
And so let me say that there are four different charters, petitions that we are considering.

03:36:22.602 --> 03:36:24.784
The commissioner is not here yet.

03:36:24.884 --> 03:36:25.925
They were told to be here at 830.

03:36:26.325 --> 03:36:27.306
We're trying to track them down.

03:36:27.346 --> 03:36:31.309
If we maybe could go to SB priorities real quick and then as soon as they're here.

03:36:31.389 --> 03:36:31.549
Okay.

03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:32.690
Oh, she's coming right now.

03:36:34.592 --> 03:36:35.212
Is she on her way?

03:36:35.232 --> 03:36:37.934
She's here before the break.

03:36:38.215 --> 03:36:39.275
Oh, she was here last night.

03:36:39.376 --> 03:36:42.158
So they might just have took the kids to lunch in the park, I think.

03:36:43.413 --> 03:36:45.295
All right, we'll take SBE priorities.

03:36:45.575 --> 03:36:45.795
Okay.

03:36:46.375 --> 03:36:53.081
All right, so let's move on to item 23, SBE priorities.

03:36:54.082 --> 03:37:01.988
And so on this, I need approval of the minutes and recommendation on that.

03:37:02.669 --> 03:37:05.171
Have a motion, please, and approve the minutes.

03:37:07.973 --> 03:37:09.254
Move approval of the minutes.

03:37:10.235 --> 03:37:10.475
Second.

03:37:10.948 --> 03:37:15.152
Okay, move and second.

03:37:15.192 --> 03:37:17.515
And all those in favor, raise your hands on the minutes.

03:37:17.755 --> 03:37:21.639
Okay, now what we're doing with SBE priorities is to

03:37:24.530 --> 03:37:26.651
We're going to go through alphabetically.

03:37:26.712 --> 03:37:32.416
We used to do it by the liaison and all of that sort of thing, but now we're going to go through alphabetically.

03:37:33.037 --> 03:37:35.739
So we'll start with Member Burr, your activities.

03:37:36.900 --> 03:37:37.961
Thank you, President Kirst.

03:37:38.902 --> 03:37:44.446
My main work has been around the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence, which I chair.

03:37:45.167 --> 03:37:48.450
I'm delighted to say that we selected a new executive director.

03:37:48.550 --> 03:37:50.531
I think I let all of you know that our

03:37:51.292 --> 03:37:55.773
esteemed director, Carl Cohen, announced his retirement effective in August.

03:37:56.653 --> 03:37:59.133
The person we selected is Tom Armolino.

03:37:59.854 --> 03:38:03.314
Tom is the former county superintendent of Shasta County.

03:38:03.754 --> 03:38:06.155
He's also a former school district superintendent.

03:38:06.595 --> 03:38:15.076
And most recently, he was the statewide president of AXA and ran the National Association of School Superintendents.

03:38:15.616 --> 03:38:19.097
So he has a very wide and ranging background.

03:38:20.157 --> 03:38:24.740
I'd like to thank Chief Deputy Price for assisting us with the recruitment.

03:38:24.800 --> 03:38:28.883
And I don't know if you'd like to say anything about Tom, but Tom has already started.

03:38:28.903 --> 03:38:30.144
He started effective July 1.

03:38:30.584 --> 03:38:43.432
I know he has had the opportunity to meet with President Kirst and with Vice President Strauss and is really now making a tour of the state to talk to all of the interested groups about the collaborative and its work.

03:38:43.972 --> 03:38:45.553
And we will be meeting on August 23rd

03:38:47.509 --> 03:38:48.729
to do a planning session.

03:38:48.749 --> 03:38:54.071
It will be a workshop, probably an all-day workshop to start on a long-range strategic plan.

03:38:54.412 --> 03:38:57.032
Because as you all know, now the work is in front of us.

03:38:57.092 --> 03:38:58.713
We've identified the LEAs.

03:38:59.213 --> 03:39:06.916
We've had the, we've actually had the opportunity in the past really to be trying some things out to get them in place going forward.

03:39:07.236 --> 03:39:09.117
But now we know who the LEAs are.

03:39:10.077 --> 03:39:16.683
We'll need our assistance and the subject areas in which we really need to focus So that's going to be Tom's work in front of them.

03:39:16.723 --> 03:39:30.233
So that's what I've been up to I don't know Glenn if you want to say anything Okay, that was important move student board member gray I

03:39:32.421 --> 03:39:36.982
Hey, I think I'm going to just talk a little bit about my experience this year.

03:39:37.462 --> 03:39:39.543
I can't believe it's been a year already.

03:39:39.583 --> 03:39:41.203
Time flies really fast.

03:39:42.403 --> 03:39:46.564
This has definitely been one of the best experiences that I've ever had.

03:39:46.664 --> 03:39:59.207
And I've learned so much, not just about educational policy, but about decision making and looking at issues through multiple lenses, which is something I think is really going to help me and serve me well later on in life.

03:40:01.009 --> 03:40:05.474
If I could sum up this year in one word, it'd definitely be humbling.

03:40:05.834 --> 03:40:18.969
Just knowing all the students that, you know, I represent and just the decisions that I'm making here and knowing how many people they impact is really just, it's kind of mind-boggling and hard to wrap my mind around.

03:40:20.950 --> 03:40:37.904
And just knowing how important each and every student is how much potential each and every student has and Like if this year and some of the events happen this year showed shows us anything it's that students really have a voice and despite the fact that we're young like

03:40:39.165 --> 03:40:44.771
the movements that happened this year just show that the potential that students have to create change.

03:40:45.232 --> 03:40:48.215
So I look forward to Hema very much next year.

03:40:48.235 --> 03:40:49.096
I've talked to her a lot.

03:40:49.336 --> 03:40:50.818
I know she's going to do an amazing job.

03:40:50.858 --> 03:40:51.919
I'm really excited for her.

03:40:53.101 --> 03:40:55.423
And I just like to thank everyone for this year.

03:40:55.784 --> 03:40:56.444
So yeah, thank you.

03:41:01.030 --> 03:41:05.993
And we have a cake in celebration of your ascension.

03:41:06.173 --> 03:41:08.214
And we'll, next break, we'll go out there.

03:41:08.294 --> 03:41:11.476
And so you can look forward to that.

03:41:11.656 --> 03:41:12.117
OK.

03:41:12.597 --> 03:41:13.517
So I'm next.

03:41:13.657 --> 03:41:24.564
And I've been attending meetings that the, to bring the levels of education together, we have, there's been formed a new education leaders

03:41:26.174 --> 03:41:37.222
group, and it's the chief executives of all the higher education systems and the K-12 system.

03:41:37.502 --> 03:41:50.772
And so, not just the chief executives, but the board chairs, which is really unique in California, as far as I know, for all the board chairs to be there with the executives.

03:41:52.193 --> 03:41:57.196
to talk about more of our relationships across the systems.

03:41:59.037 --> 03:42:06.882
And of course, the transition from K-12 education to post-secondary education is a key part of that.

03:42:08.163 --> 03:42:14.366
Tom Torlakson attends, as does Glenn Price and myself, for the K-12 area.

03:42:15.547 --> 03:42:17.708
And these have been interesting conversations.

03:42:17.748 --> 03:42:21.829
There's a work plan going on to come up with ways we can better collaborate.

03:42:22.450 --> 03:42:30.533
We're still in this process and I have nothing to report in a concrete way at this point.

03:42:31.993 --> 03:42:38.476
I also attended on Monday a meeting on the master plan for higher education.

03:42:39.716 --> 03:42:49.741
which was called, there was an earlier one that a lot of public officials came to, and I attended that, and that was last year, and then this one.

03:42:51.162 --> 03:43:01.126
And I think it's been very interesting, and that's another area where, you know, the master plan, as we all know, was written in 1960.

03:43:03.287 --> 03:43:11.513
And it was voted on by a legislature that had LA County with one vote and Siskiyou County with one vote.

03:43:11.653 --> 03:43:14.955
So it was quite a different political.

03:43:15.115 --> 03:43:18.437
And as you may know, there's been a few changes in the economy since 1960.

03:43:19.478 --> 03:43:26.683
All attempts to overhaul the master plan in any significant way, there were five of them, have failed.

03:43:27.964 --> 03:43:39.324
And so I think there was a lot of view, should we even start with the master plan as a way to think about higher education in the 21st century?

03:43:41.394 --> 03:43:46.297
And it's essentially a treaty between systems, the three systems.

03:43:46.417 --> 03:43:48.779
And they have gone into their own postholes.

03:43:48.919 --> 03:43:52.301
And we're in another posthole.

03:43:54.262 --> 03:44:00.485
Clark Kerr was asked, I was at a hearing before he died, why K-12 wasn't in the master plan.

03:44:01.026 --> 03:44:04.748
And the view was, in 1960, that K-12 is just fine.

03:44:04.788 --> 03:44:06.689
The problems are in higher education.

03:44:07.321 --> 03:44:09.985
And I sort of did a double take on that.

03:44:10.005 --> 03:44:14.551
But no need to talk about them.

03:44:14.631 --> 03:44:20.039
So that has grave limitations in that way.

03:44:20.119 --> 03:44:23.564
So there's to be a report to the legislature.

03:44:24.685 --> 03:44:30.228
There is a legislative committee in the assembly to look at the master plan as well.

03:44:30.328 --> 03:44:42.856
But a lot of discussion was, you know, if you put yourself that the master plan is the thing and then we're going to amend that, is that a place to really start your thinking about this?

03:44:42.936 --> 03:44:44.777
Or do you just say, OK, it's there.

03:44:45.197 --> 03:44:47.379
We'll preserve the treaty between systems.

03:44:47.819 --> 03:44:50.981
We could put the master plan in a mausoleum and have, you know,

03:44:51.701 --> 03:44:55.663
people worship before it and incense and so on and then move on.

03:44:57.284 --> 03:45:00.126
And that would, you know, be another way of approaching it.

03:45:00.166 --> 03:45:05.169
So that seems to be at least one of the discussions.

03:45:05.249 --> 03:45:12.313
So these are preliminary, but at least I think we'll be moving on, I think, soon with some recommendations.

03:45:13.113 --> 03:45:14.894
So Board Member Ortiz-Lacombe.

03:45:18.561 --> 03:45:18.921
Thank you.

03:45:18.961 --> 03:45:21.744
I'll start with the health framework.

03:45:22.365 --> 03:45:33.759
And so the Health Subject Matter Committee of the Instructional Quality Commission will be meeting August 13th here at CDE to review over 300 comments received so far on the health education framework.

03:45:34.240 --> 03:45:35.561
It's a very progressive framework.

03:45:35.621 --> 03:45:36.702
I'm very proud of it.

03:45:36.863 --> 03:45:37.383
I know that

03:45:38.624 --> 03:45:44.747
A lot of educators and other experts have come together to give us their best effort in this initial framework.

03:45:46.008 --> 03:45:51.350
Any edits and recommendations made from the public comment will be made to the full IQC in September 2018.

03:45:52.791 --> 03:45:58.514
After 60 days of public review, we should expect to have the framework before us in May of 2019.

03:46:00.464 --> 03:46:09.471
The other liaison report I have is with a committee that's becoming very near and dear to my heart, which is the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.

03:46:10.252 --> 03:46:16.477
And I think that, well, we've seen darker days, especially here in California, the 1990s.

03:46:16.557 --> 03:46:19.539
I think that we're training wheels for what we're experiencing now.

03:46:21.580 --> 03:46:42.831
But I'm so proud that we have something where our students of color could turn and point to a point in history where their people made a significant contribution and that our histories have not always been told, but we have certainly contributed and I'm very happy that we are starting the process.

03:46:43.591 --> 03:46:46.514
to develop this ethnic studies model curriculum.

03:46:46.834 --> 03:46:51.118
And today during the consent items, we approve the timeline of significant events.

03:46:51.919 --> 03:46:55.603
The advisory committee for the model curriculum will begin meeting in February of 2019.

03:46:57.104 --> 03:47:02.789
And all of those that are interested in applying, there will be an application posted from August to October.

03:47:03.190 --> 03:47:05.272
So please do keep an eye out for that.

03:47:07.318 --> 03:47:12.440
For EL, I attended the EL roadmap launch at the Orange County Office of Education.

03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:18.582
Special thanks to Superintendent Al Mijares, who gave us very animated welcome remarks.

03:47:19.202 --> 03:47:25.685
It was a full house of educators, including my husband, who I took so that he could learn a little bit more about the work that we're doing.

03:47:26.886 --> 03:47:29.528
I provided welcome remarks on behalf of the State Board.

03:47:29.688 --> 03:47:40.399
We reflected on the swing that California has experienced from the dark days of Prop 227 to the passage of Prop 58 and the unanimous approval of the EO roadmap by this body.

03:47:41.640 --> 03:47:42.881
Page 6 activities.

03:47:42.941 --> 03:47:50.929
I want to thank Board Member Nikki Sandoval for being our speaker representing the State Board of Education at the Long Beach Unified Dual Immersion Day.

03:47:51.549 --> 03:47:56.711
at Patrick Henry Elementary, where my students attend, my kids attend, as well as her nephew Emiliano.

03:47:57.792 --> 03:48:09.717
Along with board member Sandoval, Senator Lara also spoke, as well as LBUSD leadership, including President Megan Kerr, as well as the district leadership.

03:48:10.037 --> 03:48:11.458
So thank you, Nikki, for joining us.

03:48:13.919 --> 03:48:14.779
Okay.

03:48:14.979 --> 03:48:16.700
Board member Rucker.

03:48:19.408 --> 03:48:25.769
I attended the IQC meeting in May and the next IQC meeting is scheduled to coming up at the end of this month.

03:48:26.810 --> 03:48:36.752
We're continuing the work that's being done on developing not only the standards, but guidances in subject matters, including the world languages, which is the next item coming up.

03:48:36.792 --> 03:48:40.193
We're very excited to see the work that's being done in that area.

03:48:40.853 --> 03:48:46.174
Board member Lee Cohn already spoke about the health framework going out for public comment that was approved.

03:48:46.674 --> 03:48:51.359
That I at that particular IQC meeting at the end of this year.

03:48:51.420 --> 03:49:05.255
We'll see several IQC members who will be termed out and going off One of the thing that's been most interesting in watching the IQC over the time that I have shared the responsibility with board member Strauss is not only the

03:49:06.255 --> 03:49:34.835
The work that they come there to do as policy makers, but their growth as education leaders They start on that position that committee and on that Policy group in one particular position and they have grown and have changed in their work and grown in their own career And it's just nice to see as those people leave the IQC at the end of this year that that will continue I also I have a gift for you all and I'll just pass this down on June 22nd

03:49:36.935 --> 03:49:43.717
At the invitation of department staff, I participated again in the 2018 Early Math Symposium.

03:49:44.577 --> 03:49:46.997
It was held at the Fresno Pacific University.

03:49:47.697 --> 03:49:52.138
I'm giving you a copy of the folder, the packet that was handed out to participants.

03:49:52.498 --> 03:50:04.261
And the reason I wanted to share this with you, Early Math covers the students that we don't necessarily include for guidance and discussion in our frameworks.

03:50:04.801 --> 03:50:16.987
but it focuses not only on mathematics instruction, but good first instruction for students in the early grades beginning with pre-K and going all the way up to kindergarten, first and as well as second grade.

03:50:17.467 --> 03:50:26.412
And as you can see from this, this is a full day of activities and workshops for the teachers who registered and came.

03:50:27.092 --> 03:50:42.322
The work included from several keynote speakers who talked about not only what good math instruction looks like, but what it means to develop mathematical literacy in young students, what their conversations and ideas about mathematics are.

03:50:42.843 --> 03:50:47.546
The program includes for you a copy of information about the breakout sessions.

03:50:48.026 --> 03:50:56.232
And I'm really glad the program also gives you some background about each of the presenters, the people who did these breakout sessions and for

03:50:57.913 --> 03:51:03.558
For Superintendent Torlakson, I had spoken to him with great enthusiasm about John Collins.

03:51:04.019 --> 03:51:10.304
John Collins is not somebody everyone knows about, but he is very well known in many circles.

03:51:10.364 --> 03:51:22.035
John Collins is important for the reason that a lot of my fifth grade boys who may be listening today, and I know some of them do because one of them is a police officer in the Elk Grove Police Department.

03:51:22.055 --> 03:51:23.036
That's a whole other story.

03:51:23.576 --> 03:51:30.021
But these boys, I never had a class where I didn't have a young man who made a paper airplane and launched it in class.

03:51:30.782 --> 03:51:40.430
John Collins is famous because he created and flew the paper airplane that broke the Guinness World Record for continuous flight.

03:51:40.811 --> 03:51:44.454
And that world record was broken here at McClellan Air Force Base.

03:51:45.094 --> 03:51:46.515
in a hangar at McClellan Air Force Base.

03:51:46.555 --> 03:51:49.177
So John was one of the featured speakers.

03:51:49.717 --> 03:51:54.861
And not only did he give a great presentation, his slideshow is there, but he also gave his book out.

03:51:55.281 --> 03:51:59.204
It's an excellent example of the application of STEM and art.

03:51:59.264 --> 03:52:04.107
So his was a true STEAM program, a true STEAM presentation.

03:52:04.588 --> 03:52:11.933
It was very engaging for a full room of teachers learning how to make paper airplanes, but also understanding the math and the science

03:52:12.293 --> 03:52:16.515
behind why paper airplanes are a great application to use in the classroom.

03:52:16.535 --> 03:52:20.596
So it was a wonderful day of learning and workshops and interaction and engagement.

03:52:20.976 --> 03:52:23.657
I'm really happy to bring this handout to you to share with you.

03:52:24.958 --> 03:52:29.860
Okay, I want to mention that in the budget there was 11 million dollars

03:52:31.106 --> 03:52:40.714
for an early math initiative, preschool through grade eight, grade three, sorry.

03:52:41.975 --> 03:52:54.305
And this was carved out of some of our federal funds and is really, I think we'll hear more about it from CDE and the state board staff.

03:52:54.385 --> 03:52:59.129
But I think this is an interesting initiative and was part of the budget.

03:53:01.139 --> 03:53:02.760
Okay, Board Member Sandoval.

03:53:06.264 --> 03:53:09.287
Okay, well, I will start with visual and performing arts.

03:53:10.148 --> 03:53:14.292
The 32nd session of the California State Summer School for the Arts is underway.

03:53:15.033 --> 03:53:23.462
And we have more than 500 students studying animation, creative writing, dance, film, music, theater and visual arts.

03:53:24.322 --> 03:53:31.486
And another important thing to note is that 23 students at least will be receiving college scholarships.

03:53:32.367 --> 03:53:34.068
So they'll continue their study.

03:53:34.608 --> 03:53:46.975
And that the California State Summer School for the Arts has partnered with at least a dozen universities throughout the United States for multiple year tuition discounts for CSSSA graduates.

03:53:47.055 --> 03:53:48.155
So that's really exciting.

03:53:48.936 --> 03:53:50.597
Also with Visual and Performing Arts,

03:53:51.517 --> 03:54:00.903
The Instructional Quality Commission will be meeting later this month to review the updated California art standards and ready them for the 60-day public comment review period.

03:54:01.543 --> 03:54:06.986
And members of the public can review the draft standards on the CDE website starting next month.

03:54:07.767 --> 03:54:12.750
And we can look at taking action on the revised standards in January of 2019.

03:54:13.991 --> 03:54:16.912
And let's see, I wanted to mention

03:54:17.893 --> 03:54:22.757
Patrick Henry Elementary, I had the honor of going to their dual immersion day.

03:54:23.657 --> 03:54:30.062
And it was a really powerful moment for me because I grew up speaking English and Spanish.

03:54:30.442 --> 03:54:33.685
And as an adult, started learning our indigenous language, Samoan.

03:54:34.085 --> 03:54:44.233
So to be able to address students who are speaking two languages in the three languages that I am blessed to know,

03:54:44.913 --> 03:55:04.401
knowing that my grandfather in the 40s went to the Sherman Institute in Riverside and was forbidden to speak any of his indigenous language, that I could stand here in 2018 in Southern California and be able to address at a public school in more than one language and to think that that is our future.

03:55:04.421 --> 03:55:07.262
And I believe that I see us heading in that direction.

03:55:07.302 --> 03:55:09.403
So it was just a wonderful, powerful moment.

03:55:09.443 --> 03:55:12.965
So I'm so grateful for that invitation.

03:55:13.045 --> 03:55:13.585
So thank you.

03:55:14.545 --> 03:55:25.693
Special Education, the Advisory Commission on Special Education met July 20th and, no, June, I had the date wrong, last month, the 20th and the 21st.

03:55:26.153 --> 03:55:34.619
And I want to congratulate Fullerton Joint Union High School District, recipients of this year's Grazer Outstanding Achievement in Learning Goal Award.

03:55:35.099 --> 03:55:38.562
This district serves students in a 50 square mile radius.

03:55:39.222 --> 03:55:45.727
And their adult transition program has resulted in very dramatic increases in employment for students with disabilities.

03:55:46.328 --> 03:55:49.030
So starting with 31% employment rates in 2014 to 96% employed in 2017.

03:55:55.835 --> 03:56:03.478
So this initiative has really done exemplary work in supporting students with disabilities to prepare them for college and career and independent living.

03:56:03.598 --> 03:56:08.040
So that was a really joyful presentation to witness.

03:56:08.500 --> 03:56:13.522
And I also want to acknowledge the work that special education is doing with the data boot camps.

03:56:14.142 --> 03:56:36.114
So, the Special Education Division is looking at data dashboard with those entities that have been identified for assistance, specifically those identified due to outcomes for students with disabilities, and really helping them understand how to use the data to improve teaching and learning for our students.

03:56:37.162 --> 03:56:50.720
And then finally, at the Advisory Commission for Special Education meeting, we heard from the California Teacher Credentialing, or CTC, California Commission for Teacher Credentialing.

03:56:50.740 --> 03:56:52.602
All these acronyms, I'm getting them all twisted today.

03:56:54.284 --> 03:57:01.530
And we learned about the revisions to the program standards and teaching performance expectations for exceptional students.

03:57:01.570 --> 03:57:07.715
So there's mild to moderate and then extensive, moderate and severe support needs credentials.

03:57:07.835 --> 03:57:20.226
And while this is very important work that is being done right now, I do want to convey that I heard commissioners voicing continued concern about how we're supporting and preparing our teachers in general education settings.

03:57:20.846 --> 03:57:24.890
to meet the needs of our students with disabilities, especially as we work towards inclusion.

03:57:26.731 --> 03:57:29.534
We need to be preparing all teachers for the classroom.

03:57:30.114 --> 03:57:42.485
So then we heard from the Family Empowerment Center representatives and they called for more professional learning for classified staff members who work directly with our students with disabilities on campuses.

03:57:42.505 --> 03:57:45.047
These are classroom aides, yard duty personnel,

03:57:46.148 --> 03:57:52.652
They're working with our students daily and we need to support them with improved professional learning opportunities.

03:57:54.173 --> 03:57:54.493
Thank you.

03:57:55.654 --> 03:57:55.874
Okay, good.

03:57:56.014 --> 03:57:56.835
Board Member Sun.

03:57:56.855 --> 03:57:59.276
Thank you.

03:57:59.316 --> 03:58:05.801
Just a quick report on the California Workforce Pathways, a joint advisory committee we met back in May.

03:58:06.241 --> 03:58:14.907
And we now have a set of draft principles which we are ready to start circulating for folks to provide some additional input.

03:58:15.707 --> 03:58:27.233
So we will have a regional meeting in August, August 22nd, for getting some input on the work that we've been doing and then also providing us a little bit more direction on what our next steps will be.

03:58:27.713 --> 03:58:33.576
And I am looking forward to presenting in front of this board, along with my co-chair Pamela Haynes,

03:58:34.676 --> 03:58:55.447
to talk a little bit about our work and what we found in our last year and a half, well, about a year, year and a half now of looking at the CTA pathways and ways that we can better communicate with the community colleges and to work together as we develop our students for the workforce in the 21st century.

03:58:57.782 --> 03:59:04.744
Okay, there also was money in the budget, maybe Glenn, you can, or Karen, for a new CTE.

03:59:05.044 --> 03:59:17.306
It could be implementing some of the older projects we did under the Career Pathways Trust, but a new CTE initiative in collaboration with the community colleges.

03:59:17.646 --> 03:59:19.387
And I think there was how much, Karen?

03:59:20.927 --> 03:59:29.093
$300 million total, including some for the existing K-12 systems as well.

03:59:29.914 --> 03:59:41.722
So the legislature's continued the commitment to career and education in a really positive way with $150 million investment being made in strong workforce program to be implemented by the community college system.

03:59:41.762 --> 03:59:43.763
And K-12 coming.

03:59:44.604 --> 03:59:47.125
It all focuses on K-12.

03:59:47.345 --> 03:59:49.447
And then $150 million to be administered by the department.

03:59:49.847 --> 03:59:54.309
but for us to collaborate closely together, which I think is probably the best part of it.

03:59:55.190 --> 03:59:55.450
Right.

03:59:56.290 --> 03:59:58.491
Yeah, we don't talk about the budget, but we should.

03:59:58.511 --> 04:00:01.713
The budget also had two other aspects of it.

04:00:01.753 --> 04:00:03.674
We're talking about the budget control language, everybody.

04:00:04.955 --> 04:00:14.361
One was a new plan to have a document for the LCAP that reconciles the LCAP to the regular school budget.

04:00:14.601 --> 04:00:21.366
Right now, in some ways, they proceed separately and people can't see how do the things in the LCAP relate to the

04:00:21.946 --> 04:00:22.646
school budget?

04:00:22.766 --> 04:00:27.229
And moreover, how did the things that were in the LCAP, were they actually expended in the school budget?

04:00:27.529 --> 04:00:29.229
Because sometimes they can't hire people.

04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:41.395
So there was extensive language on this new developed part of, I guess you'd call it an instrument or something of that sort.

04:00:41.415 --> 04:00:42.976
Do you want to comment on that?

04:00:45.287 --> 04:00:59.021
You pretty much said it, Dr. Kirsten, and I think it remains to be, it's going to be a separate reporting piece, but I think the holy grail will be to, maybe misuse that word again, would be to look for integration with the LCAP.

04:01:01.094 --> 04:01:03.857
Yeah, and so that and the ultimate objective.

04:01:04.298 --> 04:01:07.662
Yeah, it also has a mentioned school site data in there as well.

04:01:07.742 --> 04:01:19.535
It's really very extensive language and then there is also a budget allocation for improving parent engagement in the LCAP process.

04:01:21.296 --> 04:01:26.378
And that's, you know, I think, badly needed.

04:01:26.638 --> 04:01:28.679
And so that's also been funded.

04:01:28.739 --> 04:01:32.040
There are extra funds for this in the budget.

04:01:32.761 --> 04:01:38.162
Yeah, as most of you know, there's a budget and then there's a bunch of, quote, trailer bill language.

04:01:38.963 --> 04:01:42.284
And it used to be that was technical cleanup in the old days.

04:01:42.744 --> 04:01:45.125
Now there's whole new programs in there.

04:01:45.365 --> 04:01:47.526
And you've got to look at that, too.

04:01:48.226 --> 04:01:48.867
Yeah, I'm sorry.

04:01:48.967 --> 04:01:52.710
I neglected to say there's funding that's coming to the collaborative.

04:01:52.750 --> 04:01:55.392
The community engagement money is coming to the collaborative.

04:01:55.432 --> 04:01:55.832
It is.

04:01:56.132 --> 04:02:10.764
Yes, to put together a process to select a county office or consortium of county offices in collaboration with the department and the board and others to put together community engagement.

04:02:11.484 --> 04:02:17.165
effort to improve community engagement, to create models, because I think our LEAs are struggling with that.

04:02:17.586 --> 04:02:20.446
There's also two other pieces of funding.

04:02:20.666 --> 04:02:21.627
I don't know the amounts.

04:02:21.727 --> 04:02:24.507
Glenn might know, or Dave.

04:02:25.067 --> 04:02:31.509
But one is to select leads for special education, to actually select SELPA leads.

04:02:32.169 --> 04:02:36.270
to help improve our success with students with disabilities.

04:02:36.650 --> 04:02:43.272
And the other one is to select geographic leads, so counties that have content expertise.

04:02:43.652 --> 04:02:46.653
So all of this relates to our system of support.

04:02:46.793 --> 04:02:54.516
Again, now that we know who needs help, we're trying to create this system of folks who are available to provide that assistance.

04:02:56.276 --> 04:03:02.461
for the ladder piece for the geographic lead agencies, which is a really welcome investment in our system of support.

04:03:02.941 --> 04:03:10.447
Those will be county offices that will be supporting and building the capacity of other county offices to provide support to LAAs in the system.

04:03:10.487 --> 04:03:20.073
And we're working hard with the State Board and with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to get those RFAs out very quickly so we can start to get that money invested.

04:03:20.113 --> 04:03:21.114
So be looking for those.

04:03:23.756 --> 04:03:24.717
Vice President Strauss.

04:03:25.327 --> 04:03:33.838
Okay, so I have a report on a variety of issues that some overlap with and complement what some of my members, colleagues have shared.

04:03:33.858 --> 04:03:42.129
In May 14th, I was in North San Diego County with AXA Palomar region, and I gave them an update, which I often do to AXA regions.

04:03:42.970 --> 04:03:45.872
about what we're doing with the dashboard, what are our safety net measures.

04:03:45.972 --> 04:03:51.235
And when I got done with sharing our system of support, I asked them to work in groups and give feedback.

04:03:51.815 --> 04:03:58.980
And we had overwhelming support for the safety net model, just so you know, particularly because they have some small situations there.

04:03:59.020 --> 04:04:00.401
And so that was positive.

04:04:00.421 --> 04:04:06.264
And then we talked a lot about coherence with all the initiatives and all the measures and how you work together.

04:04:06.304 --> 04:04:10.727
And so that seems to be a theme in practitioners' work as they translate

04:04:11.307 --> 04:04:23.992
our work and accountability and improving standards and instruction, how do you lead that in a district where there's so many district priorities going on and how it impacts a teacher and a principal about how much you can actually do effectively.

04:04:24.452 --> 04:04:32.215
So we've done some of the work at AXA Symposium and then the follow-up just listening to the practitioners and sort of what the next steps were, I thought I'd share that.

04:04:32.675 --> 04:04:36.537
And then I was invited on the 16th of May to visit Garden Grove as a follow-up for the

04:04:37.337 --> 04:04:48.726
California Collaborative on District Reform, and got to see just amazing work in dual immersion, amazing work, especially in the early grades, and an avid program in full implementation.

04:04:48.906 --> 04:04:56.191
And then looking at how the district models professional development and capacity building in a large district with a very diverse

04:04:56.611 --> 04:04:57.411
population.

04:04:58.092 --> 04:05:02.774
So it's really, and it's a pretty focused district program with great growth.

04:05:03.174 --> 04:05:07.796
And so that, with long-term consistent leadership at the district level, which I think is significant.

04:05:08.296 --> 04:05:14.458
And then on May 21st, I was in Ventura County at their science leadership meeting on continued NGSS implementation.

04:05:14.978 --> 04:05:21.461
And very exciting to hear Dr. Brian Reeser from Northwestern talk about supporting shifts in classroom practice.

04:05:22.421 --> 04:05:26.804
with NGSS storylines and listening to coherence from students' perspective.

04:05:27.244 --> 04:05:32.707
You're hearing a lot about improvement science in all of our work, and they talked about that model in science as well.

04:05:33.047 --> 04:05:39.831
And just a compliment to Ventura County, who continues to do amazing, continued leadership work in the implementation of NGSS.

04:05:41.512 --> 04:05:56.561
We have a standard steering committee, implementation committee, which is actually a communication group of CDE, state board, and the successor group, the county leads, talking about where are we in a standards implementation, what's going on, what the collaboration committees are doing.

04:05:56.941 --> 04:06:02.825
We have a science collaboration and community of practice, and we have a math science community practice.

04:06:03.845 --> 04:06:07.047
And talking about sort of where are we in all of our different rollouts.

04:06:07.127 --> 04:06:09.329
And we aren't doing much with the LAELD anymore,

04:06:10.345 --> 04:06:14.329
I think we still have a lot we need to do in literacy development.

04:06:15.130 --> 04:06:18.353
And we're talking about where we are in history and the continued need for rollout.

04:06:18.413 --> 04:06:26.741
So that coordination, which I think is good, we meet quarterly to talk about where all the projects are and what the different groups are doing.

04:06:27.521 --> 04:06:31.305
There's another group that we also have a role and CDE also meets with.

04:06:31.665 --> 04:06:39.212
it's called PACRS, you've heard me talk about them, Promoting Authentic College Career and Civic Readiness Assessment System.

04:06:39.232 --> 04:06:43.295
So, besides paper and pencil, what do we do for assessment that's authentic?

04:06:43.816 --> 04:06:49.761
And they've been working on, and Tom Adams gave some update on the history social science framework and where we are in history social science.

04:06:50.702 --> 04:06:57.108
And lots of discussions about how we promote civic engagement among our students, which we know is really important.

04:06:57.708 --> 04:07:01.602
Their plan as they move forward is to continue to build coherence around

04:07:02.276 --> 04:07:14.103
civic engagement, equity and support so that students are college and career ready, but also talk about civic readiness, and then taking a look at what it means for system of support for adult learning.

04:07:14.143 --> 04:07:26.490
So I think the nice thing about having CDE and State Board on some of these advisory commissions that work, or this is not an advisory commission, it's a committee that works together with funding, is that we're trying to be coherent about it and communicate.

04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:28.491
So I think we'll hear more about that.

04:07:29.554 --> 04:07:36.777
The Concurrence Commission, that's another commission that really only meets twice a year, and it's the subject matter projects that do a lot of teacher training in our state.

04:07:37.177 --> 04:07:38.597
So they met June 13th.

04:07:38.677 --> 04:07:45.580
Mostly the June meeting is to deal with continued funding, but Tom Adams did a report on ESSA and where we are and where we hope to be in ESSA.

04:07:46.060 --> 04:07:56.023
And as a result, they are actually having a special meeting with all the leads of the subject matter projects to try to align their resources and their training with the reform efforts that we're involved with.

04:07:56.103 --> 04:07:58.324
So we'll hear more about that, but I think

04:07:59.444 --> 04:08:04.246
We need to all be connected on this conversation, and so Tom did a really nice job of updating them.

04:08:04.826 --> 04:08:23.852
But they are gonna do, in fall of 2019, the UC and CSU is committed to doing a sustainability education summit at UCLA, spotlighting the importance of integrating sustainability and climate change as a critical part of K-12 and higher ed curriculum and coursework, and to show how we can promote that with state standards.

04:08:23.952 --> 04:08:26.392
So I'll get more about it if they're just starting to plan.

04:08:26.432 --> 04:08:28.333
I think Glenn may have some more information about that.

04:08:29.744 --> 04:08:32.385
Yes, we let Board Member Holliday know about that.

04:08:33.245 --> 04:08:39.107
Okay, I'll let him know because they are going to have a first call with the committee, so I'll be glad to do that.

04:08:39.487 --> 04:08:50.531
And then CTC met, and just to support what Member Sandoval was saying, is that there's continued discussion about the need to prepare general education teachers to support special education.

04:08:50.931 --> 04:09:00.775
So it's interesting for us to talk about the need in our advisory commission, for us to talk about the need in our standards to support differentiation of learners, and then to realize what it takes to prepare our teachers.

04:09:01.175 --> 04:09:06.717
So there's an agreement that we need to support all teachers to be prepared to teach special ed.

04:09:07.117 --> 04:09:13.039
There's not an agreement that we're fully there yet as far as the standards, as far as giving teachers literacy strategies.

04:09:13.620 --> 04:09:16.521
And so there'll be continued conversation at the CTC meeting.

04:09:16.541 --> 04:09:19.842
And we have state board liaisons that staff that go along.

04:09:20.743 --> 04:09:27.248
And they did talk about the incentive in the budget items to address the teacher shortage.

04:09:27.789 --> 04:09:34.075
Again, CTC is obviously really important because we are retiring more credentials than we're starting.

04:09:34.415 --> 04:09:36.317
And there's incentives in the area of

04:09:37.017 --> 04:09:44.724
special education, also STEM, and taking a look at issues that we could target to help increase our teaching force.

04:09:45.725 --> 04:09:49.208
Also a need to increase not only in STEM, but in career tech ed.

04:09:49.288 --> 04:09:52.010
So those are areas that we're hearing a priority in the work group.

04:09:52.523 --> 04:09:58.108
that Ting Sung and I think Felicia and Patricia Rucker are involved in.

04:09:58.128 --> 04:10:05.574
And I think we're beginning to see, we're seeing some cross, different committees talking about the need for teacher preparation, preparing our kids well.

04:10:06.594 --> 04:10:14.441
And so you'll hear more about that, about needing to have transition to college and also support for students with exceptional needs.

04:10:14.501 --> 04:10:15.001
And then my

04:10:16.102 --> 04:10:30.910
I have two more things, is that on June 27th to 29th, Glenn Price and I attended, along with Estella Ben-Simon, who's a USC professor, and Lark Park from the governor's office, and Christia Osmena, Christian from the community colleges.

04:10:30.970 --> 04:10:34.012
We attended the Education Commission of the States in Washington, D.C.

04:10:34.032 --> 04:10:37.414
So I'll give you a quick outline of some really exciting things.

04:10:37.474 --> 04:10:40.596
And if anybody wants any of the PowerPoints, it's really interesting.

04:10:40.976 --> 04:10:45.061
There were some plenary sessions where more than 573 education leaders came from 43 states.

04:10:56.514 --> 04:10:57.815
Where is education policy?

04:10:57.875 --> 04:10:59.436
Where have we come and where are we going?

04:10:59.916 --> 04:11:03.498
And what's the theory of the education workforce that's changing?

04:11:03.538 --> 04:11:09.921
And how the population, if you think about all the boomers retiring, they call it the growing of the silver population.

04:11:10.381 --> 04:11:17.665
And then the changing of the diversity of the growing population of the diversity of our, and the changing workforce.

04:11:17.685 --> 04:11:19.046
And then there was one comment.

04:11:19.626 --> 04:11:25.913
about the fact that the person who's going to live to be 150 years old has already been born.

04:11:25.933 --> 04:11:27.475
Is that amazing?

04:11:27.595 --> 04:11:33.141
Anyway, this is from some of the research groups that Glenn and I were sitting at the table together when we heard this statement.

04:11:33.282 --> 04:11:35.023
It won't be probably us, but anyway.

04:11:36.625 --> 04:11:43.509
But they talked about looking at employment pathways, looking at early childhood education, which you hear a lot in California.

04:11:44.530 --> 04:11:47.192
And then all the demographics and how things are changing.

04:11:48.092 --> 04:11:49.733
And then issues of equity and access.

04:11:49.793 --> 04:11:51.654
If all means all, what's it gonna take?

04:11:51.834 --> 04:11:52.895
Which we all talk about.

04:11:52.995 --> 04:11:53.716
What's that mean?

04:11:54.256 --> 04:11:56.077
What does it mean to strengthen school leadership?

04:11:56.177 --> 04:11:58.479
Which our collaborative ration committees talk about.

04:11:58.519 --> 04:11:59.960
Success is talking about that.

04:12:00.580 --> 04:12:05.323
Every subject matter group talks about needing to train leaders as well as training teachers.

04:12:05.983 --> 04:12:13.633
And then they said, so this is sort of interesting, the midterm elections in 2018, 36 states and D.C.

04:12:13.673 --> 04:12:19.040
will hold governor races and there's a guaranteed 16 new governors just because the term limits were one of them.

04:12:20.194 --> 04:12:23.495
Seven states will hold chief state school board elections.

04:12:24.015 --> 04:12:27.436
Seven states and DC hold state board of education elections.

04:12:27.876 --> 04:12:32.138
And 87 out of 99 legislative chambers are going to have general elections.

04:12:32.158 --> 04:12:35.779
So there's a lot of changes going on in ed policy nationally.

04:12:35.799 --> 04:12:38.540
I think we were just taken back by the data.

04:12:39.580 --> 04:12:45.382
And then finally, next week, this is really exciting, on Monday, IQC members

04:12:45.882 --> 04:12:54.690
and the facilitators will come together for reviewers training to review NGSS aligned materials, of which there are 37 different programs.

04:12:55.170 --> 04:13:04.319
And starting Tuesday, all the panels will come together, and by the end of the week, they will have reviewed and recommended which programs are ready for approval.

04:13:04.839 --> 04:13:08.302
It has to go through a process where it goes back to IQC, it'll have another hearing.

04:13:08.402 --> 04:13:11.125
But in November, we're going to be able to approve

04:13:11.685 --> 04:13:14.347
NGSS aligned materials for our state framework.

04:13:14.667 --> 04:13:21.871
So by January, districts will be ready to adopt aligned materials and they've had some time to work on the framework.

04:13:22.252 --> 04:13:27.255
So I think it's really exciting going forward and that's next week here in Sacramento.

04:13:27.735 --> 04:13:29.336
And that ends my report, thank you.

04:13:31.657 --> 04:13:32.418
Member Valdez.

04:13:37.339 --> 04:13:44.723
So this morning, Superintendent Tarlekson talked about the Global California 2030 Initiative.

04:13:44.783 --> 04:13:50.947
And so I had the opportunity in June to attend the World Language Standards Committee.

04:13:51.467 --> 04:13:56.970
And I have to tell you, the group of people, it was their sixth day or the fifth of the sixth day together.

04:13:57.490 --> 04:14:10.133
And what we are doing in terms of bringing teachers and leaders together to have conversations about world language standards coming forward, it's all part of this whole vision, if you will, is phenomenal.

04:14:10.173 --> 04:14:18.274
And so their work now goes forward to IQC, and IQC will be developing the final framework, if you will, over time.

04:14:18.314 --> 04:14:20.455
So we're very excited about the work that they did, so.

04:14:20.475 --> 04:14:23.595
Okay, Board Member Williams.

04:14:28.346 --> 04:14:35.991
This has been primarily computer science year for me, but I still have charters and NGSS.

04:14:36.051 --> 04:14:45.257
On the computer science front, the first-ever California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Planning Advisory Panel,

04:14:48.010 --> 04:14:51.053
CISP, something like that.

04:14:52.935 --> 04:14:57.160
Yeah, it's a really long name that was in the statute.

04:14:57.380 --> 04:15:05.588
They were, this is the panel that was appointed primarily by the governor with a couple appointments by, six appointments by the superintendent.

04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:13.913
and a co-chair by the superintendent, a co-chair by President Kirst, and members of the Senate and the Assembly.

04:15:14.413 --> 04:15:15.934
And so it was a pretty high-level panel.

04:15:15.954 --> 04:15:19.276
They all had to have expertise in some fashion in computer science.

04:15:19.596 --> 04:15:23.058
They weren't all computer scientists, but many were.

04:15:23.799 --> 04:15:31.123
Either they taught computer science in K-12, or this panel in particular, every single slot was designated in the statute.

04:15:32.704 --> 04:15:40.596
So as opposed to standards committees, for instance, they didn't have more than half teachers.

04:15:40.656 --> 04:15:47.707
They had six teachers total and then a variety of other, how many higher ed, how many tech.

04:15:48.047 --> 04:15:49.048
industry, that kind of thing.

04:15:49.528 --> 04:15:51.009
So they have completed their meetings.

04:15:51.069 --> 04:15:52.209
They did that last week.

04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:54.050
They met six days total.

04:15:55.171 --> 04:16:02.875
The law required them to develop recommendations that would broaden the pool of teachers that are qualified to teach computer science.

04:16:03.596 --> 04:16:06.597
And under, there's three main charges in the statute.

04:16:07.118 --> 04:16:10.900
Under each one, there are lots of suggested things that they should look at.

04:16:11.100 --> 04:16:15.002
For instance, on the broadening the pool of teachers, they should be looking at creating

04:16:15.943 --> 04:16:17.184
Well, I'll just read it to you right now.

04:16:17.544 --> 04:16:32.279
They should be looking at creating a teacher certification pathway in computer science, expanding scholarship eligibility and loan forgiveness programs for computer science teachers in low-income and underserved school districts, things like that, teacher preparation, things like that.

04:16:32.799 --> 04:16:35.282
In addition, they were asked to create

04:16:36.443 --> 04:16:47.650
what was called Computer Science Principles, P-L-E-S, that were sort of the big overarching things that should be considered in expanding computer science in California.

04:16:48.090 --> 04:16:56.375
And as you might imagine, there was pretty strong references to the importance of computer science for all students and equity and access issues.

04:16:56.855 --> 04:17:04.520
And then in addition, well, that was actually one of the third things, which included ensuring all pupils have access to quality computer science.

04:17:05.160 --> 04:17:12.702
So the way this is going to finish up is that this group has finalized and reached consensus.

04:17:12.782 --> 04:17:13.903
I attended all six days.

04:17:14.283 --> 04:17:16.783
Finalized and reached consensus on their recommendations.

04:17:17.504 --> 04:17:32.088
Gave permission to the facilitator, CDE facilitator, Barbara Murchison, who did a really fine job, gave permission to her to work with the co-chairs to do any wordsmithing and fixing this and that, tweaking.

04:17:33.389 --> 04:17:40.355
Then that will go to the IQC and the IQC will work with CDE.

04:17:40.415 --> 04:17:49.963
I'm going to get this not quite right because it wasn't spelled out totally clearly in the statute, but the IQC and the CDE will then work together to put together a plan.

04:17:51.224 --> 04:17:53.107
to execute recommendations.

04:17:53.587 --> 04:17:58.494
So this panel is only making recommendations, they're not developing the plan for execution.

04:17:58.774 --> 04:18:00.376
The CDE will be doing that.

04:18:00.597 --> 04:18:05.643
It's going to go out, I think it's the full plan that will go out for public review, come back to the IQC.

04:18:07.325 --> 04:18:15.294
and will come when that's done to the State Board in March of 2019 for consideration of adoption.

04:18:15.994 --> 04:18:29.368
This coming September, the Board will have an opportunity to review the recommendations from this panel, but not the plan for execution, just the recommendations, and to provide input and discuss those recommendations.

04:18:30.409 --> 04:18:35.374
which the CDE will then take with them to do their work and consider that in the plan.

04:18:35.854 --> 04:18:38.657
So that's the Strategic Implementation Planning Commission.

04:18:39.578 --> 04:18:45.483
On computer science standards, they had finished their work and it goes to, and it's been out for public comment.

04:18:46.003 --> 04:18:51.248
Those go to the IQC this month at the IQC meeting on July 26th.

04:18:52.589 --> 04:19:03.735
I will not be coming up to Sacramento for the IQC meeting, but I will be calling in during the estimated one hour that they will be talking about these computer science standards.

04:19:04.295 --> 04:19:08.457
And then those will come to us in September for consideration of adoption as well.

04:19:09.498 --> 04:19:16.282
A little fun thing that I'm going to do, not that the rest of this wasn't fun, but is that I was invited by

04:19:17.502 --> 04:19:40.455
Code.org to go to their training professional development training that they do they call it a teacher con for computer science principals AP and also their middle grades curriculum, which is called Computer science discoveries and they have thousands of teachers from from around the country that that go to these two events that they hold in the summer I'm going in Phoenix

04:19:41.215 --> 04:19:43.516
to Phoenix in two weeks.

04:19:43.956 --> 04:19:48.937
And they have a particularly large number of teachers from California that have signed up for this PD.

04:19:49.918 --> 04:19:55.820
They offer the curriculum and the PD, including the accommodations and the airfare, free of charge for them to get there.

04:19:55.840 --> 04:19:59.281
They just have to sign up and commit to teaching computer science the next year.

04:19:59.881 --> 04:20:01.722
And so they asked me to come.

04:20:01.742 --> 04:20:02.682
I was interested.

04:20:03.550 --> 04:20:04.932
I've been working on this for years.

04:20:04.972 --> 04:20:18.432
I'd never seen a computer science principles course or seen how it's taught, so I was interested in learning, but they also asked me to be there to meet with the teachers, both to give the California teachers an update on California computer science policy,

04:20:18.792 --> 04:20:38.751
and for the teachers to have an opportunity to tell me why they're taking this training, how they plan to use it in their schools, you know, what made them interested, what do they find most interesting about doing this work, why did they choose to do it, what are they having the most difficulty with, what do they wish the state board or CDE might do to support their efforts.

04:20:39.291 --> 04:20:41.173
So, I'll be doing that later this month.

04:20:42.414 --> 04:21:02.853
In addition, staying with the computer science theme, two years ago, I was approached by Dr. Henry Sanchez of the University of California, Boers, to see if I wanted to come up to Oakland to talk with him and his staff, Monica Lynn, about NGSS.

04:21:03.573 --> 04:21:15.197
and about computer science and about Area D. And so, and whether or not computer science, they might want to consider allowing some computer science courses to be approved under Area D and what that would take to do it.

04:21:15.958 --> 04:21:26.782
And since that time, they've undergone a pretty rigorous process to consider this with UC faculty, science faculty, computer science faculty, workforce that met for, I think, 18 months.

04:21:28.428 --> 04:21:34.470
12 months, 18 months, they've made recommendations about how that might happen.

04:21:35.191 --> 04:21:48.736
Those recommendations have gone back to BORS, they've gone to the Academic Senate, they've gone to the UC Assembly, I might be getting some of those names of those groups wrong, and they are now with the UC Office of the President to consider

04:21:49.416 --> 04:21:53.060
how they might handle this approach and this question.

04:21:53.560 --> 04:21:55.202
They do have a really strong interest.

04:21:55.622 --> 04:22:13.119
The UC Boards, especially Dr. Henry Sanchez, who's a pathologist and a scientist, is strongly committed to next-generation science standards, and also articulates an understanding that in today's world, most scientists

04:22:13.780 --> 04:22:22.885
have to also be or work with computer scientists to study big data, to do modeling, to do simulations, engineering design, that kind of thing.

04:22:22.945 --> 04:22:24.546
So he has a really strong interest in this.

04:22:25.026 --> 04:22:26.547
And I was invited last week.

04:22:27.448 --> 04:22:36.773
One of the reasons I'm raising it is because I was invited last week by Dr. Sanchez and Monica to participate in an hour video call with the two of them just to

04:22:37.273 --> 04:22:50.246
give me an update on where they are in this process, to raise ideas they were thinking about, to ask what, you know, what was going on with the State Board, some sort of informal inter-segmental cooperation and collaboration, he called it.

04:22:50.806 --> 04:22:53.269
And it was really interesting and enjoyable for me.

04:22:53.329 --> 04:22:57.693
I really appreciate it and feel honored to be able to communicate with them around this.

04:22:58.454 --> 04:23:00.456
So that's the CS report.

04:23:01.641 --> 04:23:07.066
Of course, I went to the Advisory Commission on Charter Schools last month, my 44th, not counting.

04:23:07.626 --> 04:23:15.193
But it's, I started when, yeah, well, nobody had ever gone.

04:23:15.213 --> 04:23:18.596
A board member had never gone to ACCS before me.

04:23:19.496 --> 04:23:21.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:23:23.320 --> 04:23:24.601
Did she go to ACCS?

04:23:24.621 --> 04:23:29.045
Because I was told when I went that I was the first one to show up.

04:23:30.094 --> 04:23:41.760
Okay, well, she went, she came when I was going, and then, and then when Bruce came on board, then he said, okay, if this is what we do, you know, I'm with you, I'm with you, I'll go.

04:23:42.180 --> 04:23:48.904
So, did that last month, and so feel reasonably prepared for to, to the, those agenda items.

04:23:49.965 --> 04:23:54.690
In addition, I snuck in just a little bit of NGSS time.

04:23:55.051 --> 04:24:07.806
I'm going to surprise Dave Sapp by engaging in a couple of conversations with State Board staff Dave Sapp on the, what process they're using as you heard earlier today to

04:24:08.486 --> 04:24:36.820
Redesign the dashboard and then we had a conversation about how NGSS was going to get included on that dashboard and when that might get included and and I and I was Assured I think you're going to be fine with this statement I was assured that the designers of the dashboard are making sure it's flexible enough in the design that it can accommodate Whatever next thing the board decides to put into it

04:24:37.622 --> 04:24:43.655
That was at least one of the things I was hoping for, so I feel good about that.

04:24:44.417 --> 04:24:47.563
The last thing I want to say is you were talking about early childhood math.

04:24:48.379 --> 04:24:55.905
Well, our Carolyn Pfister was a major driver in pulling that meeting off and supporting it.

04:24:56.165 --> 04:25:02.711
And it's one of the projects, she tells me, she loves the most in her state board role.

04:25:02.771 --> 04:25:11.298
So I'm giving props and kudos to you for that because it looks like it turned out to be a really fabulous event and a great cause.

04:25:15.359 --> 04:25:16.039
That's it for me.

04:25:16.259 --> 04:25:16.620
OK.

04:25:16.680 --> 04:25:21.502
Well that concludes our SBE priorities.

04:25:21.542 --> 04:25:24.483
We have a lot going on that doesn't show up at the meetings.

04:25:24.623 --> 04:25:27.444
I hope people understand that.

04:25:27.524 --> 04:25:30.346
So now we're ready for item 16 through 19.

04:25:30.546 --> 04:25:30.786
This is a

04:25:33.607 --> 04:25:39.889
petitions to establish four Olive Grove charter schools and they will be heard as a single public hearing.

04:25:39.909 --> 04:25:41.069
This is quite unusual.

04:25:42.130 --> 04:25:45.951
First, we will hear a single staff presentation on the four petitions.

04:25:46.991 --> 04:25:55.774
Then the petitioners will have a total of 20 minutes to present in favor of their four petitions in the public hearing.

04:25:56.634 --> 04:26:00.876
The four districts and the County Office of Education will also have 20 minutes

04:26:01.957 --> 04:26:04.318
to present their opposition to the petitions.

04:26:04.938 --> 04:26:13.361
And following the presentation, members of the public will have a chance to comment on all FAR items at two minutes per person.

04:26:15.021 --> 04:26:25.304
So we will start with Lisa to talk about the CDE's analysis and recommendation, and then we'll move directly into the public hearing.

04:26:26.525 --> 04:26:27.925
Jason's cake is ready.

04:26:27.985 --> 04:26:29.906
Those of you that want to go out and get some.

04:26:32.909 --> 04:26:38.094
Okay, I'll go ahead and get started then.

04:26:39.235 --> 04:26:48.766
As President Kirst mentioned, this is item 16 through 19 for Olive Grove Charter Schools, and I'll talk a little bit more as we get through the presentation why these are being combined.

04:26:50.227 --> 04:26:58.453
So just a little bit of background, Olive Grove is a state board authorized charter school currently that is operating multiple resource centers.

04:26:59.034 --> 04:27:04.378
So Olive Grove is seeking to actually restructure each resource center to be an individual charter school.

04:27:04.758 --> 04:27:13.604
So instead of being Olive Grove charter schools with resource centers, they will be each a charter school to come into compliance with the Anderson decision.

04:27:14.645 --> 04:27:24.494
Four of these resource centers, Buellton, Lompoc, Orcutt, Santa Maria, and Santa Barbara are all in Santa Barbara County and are before the State Board today as separate schools.

04:27:25.474 --> 04:27:34.362
Each of the four Olive Grove Resource Centers first petitioned the school district in which they were geographically located and then subsequently to the Santa Barbara County.

04:27:36.584 --> 04:27:42.306
So to give you a little timeline, again, each of the individual petitions were denied by the local school districts.

04:27:42.787 --> 04:27:49.549
Santa Barbara Unified School District denied the Olive Grove Charter School on December 5th by a vote of five to zero.

04:27:50.330 --> 04:27:58.753
Lompoc Unified School District denied the Olive Grove Charter School Lompoc on December 5th, 2017 by a vote of three to one with one abstention.

04:28:00.632 --> 04:28:09.276
The Santa Maria Joint Union High School District denied the Olive Grove Charter School Orcutt Santa Maria on December 12, 2017 by a vote of 5 to 0.

04:28:10.016 --> 04:28:17.059
And then the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District denied the Olive Grove Charter School Buellton on December 12, 2017 by a vote of 5 to 0.

04:28:21.303 --> 04:28:30.930
Subsequently, on March 1st, 2018, the Santa Barbara County Board of Education voted to deny all four petitions at the same meeting by a vote of five to zero.

04:28:31.570 --> 04:28:36.433
The petitioner then subsequently submitted all four petitions on appeal to the state board on March 15th, 2018.

04:28:39.827 --> 04:28:52.774
The CDE is recommending that the State Board hold a public hearing to approve the request to establish all four Olive Grove schools as individual charter schools under the oversight of the State Board for a five-year term of July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2023.

04:28:58.109 --> 04:29:10.455
Our recommendation is based on a sound educational program, that the schools are demonstratively likely to successfully implement the programs, and that we have reasonable comprehensive description of most of the charter elements in the petitions.

04:29:13.636 --> 04:29:16.438
The Advisory Commission on Charter Schools met on June 12, 2018.

04:29:17.918 --> 04:29:25.622
The commission moved staff's recommendation to approve all four petitions to the State Board of Education, and the motions all passed by a vote of seven to one.

04:29:28.467 --> 04:29:32.491
A little history of the schools as a state board authorized charter school.

04:29:32.951 --> 04:29:41.199
So Olive Grove was initially approved at the July 2015 state board meeting for a five year term from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2020.

04:29:41.839 --> 04:29:46.804
They are a TK through 12 independent study program.

04:29:46.984 --> 04:29:54.450
Total enrollment is currently 710 pupils and that is currently two times what was originally stated in their original petition.

04:29:55.251 --> 04:29:58.574
They've had a good financial record under the state board authorization.

04:29:58.594 --> 04:30:04.578
They currently are projected to have a funding balance of over $600,000 with a reserve of over 10%.

04:30:05.299 --> 04:30:11.524
And the audited financial data from 2016-17 report had no significant audit findings that were noted.

04:30:14.051 --> 04:30:18.795
In terms of their academic history, they have been approved for a dashboard alternative school status in the fall of 2017.

04:30:20.657 --> 04:30:39.534
In February of 2018, the school-wide percentage of pupils not meeting state standards in math exceeded statewide averages by more than 15%, but we were in contact with the schools and the school did commit to adjusting their instruction to target their academic deficiencies, and they will talk a little bit about that in their presentation as well.

04:30:40.475 --> 04:30:49.516
During our annual oversight visit of the schools in May 2018, Olive Grove was in compliance with their memo of understanding with the state board and their charter petition at that time.

04:30:52.068 --> 04:31:02.753
In terms of their educational program, the pupils will participate in the independent study blended learning environment program with parent as the primary deliverer of the education program.

04:31:03.333 --> 04:31:10.757
The schools will provide guidance, support, assistance, and resource materials to enable parents to meet the individual needs of each of their pupils.

04:31:11.437 --> 04:31:19.641
Each pupil's academic performance is individualized, and the petitioners are proposing to preserve the current educational program delivered at each of their resource centers.

04:31:21.934 --> 04:31:28.682
In terms of their fiscal analysis, all projected budgets, including ORCUT, are fiscally viable with reserves of 5%.

04:31:29.783 --> 04:31:32.446
And I do have an error in this next bullet here.

04:31:33.087 --> 04:31:39.094
At the ACCS meeting, part of our staff recommendation was that we did have a concern about the budget for ORCUT.

04:31:39.814 --> 04:31:45.339
So, the item requested a balanced budget with a 5% reserve by June 30th, 2018.

04:31:45.939 --> 04:31:53.925
The budget was submitted to CDE on June 14th, 2018 and we did review that budget and did determine that it is fiscally viable.

04:31:54.086 --> 04:31:59.690
They do have a positive ending fund balance and the appropriate reserves for the term of the charter.

04:32:02.498 --> 04:32:09.541
If approved by the State Board, we did find some elements in the petition that we feel do need to be clarified by the petitioner, and I have listed them here.

04:32:10.041 --> 04:32:19.305
If these are approved by the State Board, we will continue to work with the petitioner to ensure we have the appropriate clarifications needed in the petition prior to the school's opening.

04:32:21.491 --> 04:32:25.773
In summary, CDE staff is recommending approval of all four of these petitions.

04:32:26.374 --> 04:32:32.837
They are in good standing with the State Board and have a good sound educational program as well as overall fiscal viability.

04:32:33.478 --> 04:32:39.121
And again, we will work with them on clarification on some of the charter elements in the petition if approved by the State Board.

04:32:40.001 --> 04:32:43.103
I'm available if anyone has any questions at this time.

04:32:44.183 --> 04:32:45.204
Board Member Sandoval.

04:32:47.384 --> 04:32:48.845
Thank you for the summary.

04:32:49.886 --> 04:32:54.609
So this group has been authorized under state board for three years.

04:32:55.090 --> 04:32:55.290
Yes.

04:32:55.610 --> 04:33:00.714
And I didn't find any information about student outcomes in those three years.

04:33:00.734 --> 04:33:02.936
So where's that information?

04:33:03.076 --> 04:33:07.019
I can pull that up for you for some of the information we do have.

04:33:07.059 --> 04:33:13.343
But because of the DASC certification, there really wasn't a lot of academic

04:33:15.785 --> 04:33:17.466
performance data available to us.

04:33:17.606 --> 04:33:17.866
Right.

04:33:17.946 --> 04:33:18.827
Based on test scores?

04:33:18.907 --> 04:33:19.908
Yes, based on test scores.

04:33:19.928 --> 04:33:24.290
But the petitioner does have information in their presentation that they're going to discuss with you as well.

04:33:24.410 --> 04:33:25.471
It is a small number.

04:33:26.272 --> 04:33:28.033
What, 700, you said, students?

04:33:28.073 --> 04:33:28.353
Yes.

04:33:28.613 --> 04:33:34.737
So there would be other measures of student progress over three years than test scores.

04:33:35.399 --> 04:33:36.039
Yes.

04:33:37.199 --> 04:33:38.840
And the petitioner does have that information.

04:33:38.860 --> 04:33:42.580
We didn't include it as part of our presentation because we didn't look at it as a renewal.

04:33:42.840 --> 04:33:43.440
OK.

04:33:43.540 --> 04:33:47.421
But the petitioner does have some of that information to share with the board as well.

04:33:47.661 --> 04:33:47.841
OK.

04:33:48.181 --> 04:33:51.542
And my second question is on the demographic data tables.

04:33:52.362 --> 04:33:57.863
So there is demographic data for the surrounding schools that pupils would otherwise be required to attend.

04:33:58.623 --> 04:34:03.284
So I know this isn't I'm noticing this is not a comprehensive list of the local schools.

04:34:04.344 --> 04:34:04.504
So

04:34:06.232 --> 04:34:19.137
My question is, why are some schools missing from these tables from the local areas where these charters, where the proposed school will, for example, like Santa Maria.

04:34:20.377 --> 04:34:22.618
Santa Maria High School is missing from this table.

04:34:22.938 --> 04:34:25.139
So is Orchid Academy, which is a charter.

04:34:27.265 --> 04:34:31.286
So I feel like I've just that's my question is why are those missing?

04:34:31.526 --> 04:34:43.850
I can take a look at that I don't know the answer to it offhand, but I'll take a look and I can get back to you Yeah, and then I would just strongly recommend looking at the tables for all of those areas because in the Santa Ynez Valley I noticed there were also some missing.

04:34:44.210 --> 04:34:53.833
Okay schools Other comments to Lisa at this point Remember Ortiz Lacone

04:34:55.368 --> 04:35:01.290
This is a general comment, so I'm going to direct it to you versus the school or the district.

04:35:01.890 --> 04:35:06.932
But I noticed that one of the areas that we will monitor is EL reclassification.

04:35:07.392 --> 04:35:10.133
So can you remind me what percent of students are EL?

04:35:11.334 --> 04:35:12.454
I'll have to look that up.

04:35:12.514 --> 04:35:14.615
I'm sorry, I don't have that offhand, but I'll look it up for you.

04:35:15.117 --> 04:35:28.260
So I'm wondering how does the training happen so that a parent is best suited to assist their EL child as they're moving up towards proficiency?

04:35:28.781 --> 04:35:33.622
And I think this is general because it's always a question that I have when I see some of these schools.

04:35:34.863 --> 04:35:41.748
I know that for teachers, we're still trying to make sure that we reach every school to train according to the common core and our standards.

04:35:41.808 --> 04:35:51.495
And there's so many things that are happening at our state right now, so many frameworks, and it's a lift to get all of that support and resources and training to teachers.

04:35:51.935 --> 04:35:55.858
So now you have the parent, that's the primary person delivering.

04:35:56.459 --> 04:35:57.479
How are they meeting?

04:35:57.580 --> 04:35:58.440
How are they trained?

04:35:58.500 --> 04:36:00.382
How do they assist their child?

04:36:01.362 --> 04:36:04.885
to develop language proficiency and everything else.

04:36:04.965 --> 04:36:18.636
And that's just a general question because, again, we've gone through so many shifts and if that's an area of concern, then how are we making sure that the parent who's the main facilitator is actually trained or is qualified to do that?

04:36:19.296 --> 04:36:21.578
I can take a look at that in a general statement.

04:36:25.561 --> 04:36:26.282
Board Member Williams.

04:36:28.849 --> 04:36:56.197
I'll address this in the same context to you as well, but I'm pretty certain we'll probably hear it from the petitioner, which is I think it's important for us to understand, you'd think we would since we approved the school three years ago, but it was a lot of charters ago, that to understand what sorts of families are in this system and are making this their public school choice and why.

04:36:58.359 --> 04:37:06.891
what are the challenges that the students bring to the system and that Olive Growth is helping them with.

04:37:07.291 --> 04:37:09.454
I think that context will help us understand this.

04:37:09.855 --> 04:37:11.978
And I'm sure the petitioner can address that as well.

04:37:13.885 --> 04:37:17.547
Okay, seeing no further comments, then I'm ready to open the public hearing.

04:37:17.667 --> 04:37:24.210
And so first we'll hear from the petition supporters, and then you have 20 minutes.

04:37:25.431 --> 04:37:26.372
Please come forward.

04:37:26.592 --> 04:37:28.393
Identify yourselves as you speak.

04:37:41.961 --> 04:37:42.881
Actually, afternoon now.

04:37:44.163 --> 04:37:45.044
I am Laura Mudge.

04:37:45.124 --> 04:37:47.686
I am the executive director of Olive Grove Charter School.

04:37:47.966 --> 04:37:49.047
And my name is Dawn Wilson.

04:37:49.087 --> 04:37:50.989
I am the COO of Olive Grove Charter School.

04:37:52.551 --> 04:37:52.931
All right.

04:37:53.011 --> 04:37:57.575
So we'll respond to you as we're doing our presentation, if that's OK.

04:37:57.655 --> 04:38:02.480
I actually just spoke with our EL coordinator, and she's going to directly answer that question for you.

04:38:04.281 --> 04:38:14.867
All right, so we're gonna try to do this kind of concisely, but if you have questions, I mean, we have been state board authorized for three years now, so if you have additional questions, we're happy to answer them as well.

04:38:15.987 --> 04:38:31.816
I'm not sure we need to go over everything that was just stated, but Olive Grove Charter School was a dependent charter school previous to this incarnation of Olive Grove that first opened 17 years ago under Los Alivos School District.

04:38:32.896 --> 04:38:36.320
In 2015, Los Olivos decided to go basic aid.

04:38:36.840 --> 04:38:39.263
Well, they wanted to fall further into basic aid.

04:38:39.664 --> 04:38:42.387
With the charter, they weren't able to do that.

04:38:42.407 --> 04:38:50.916
They were worried about LCFF funding changing how they were going to be receiving funds for the students that were not in their district.

04:38:54.545 --> 04:39:02.596
A large group of our staff decided we were going to try to keep all of Grove around for those students that really needed us throughout the county.

04:39:05.151 --> 04:39:06.131
You guys authorized this.

04:39:06.631 --> 04:39:07.311
Thank you so much.

04:39:07.772 --> 04:39:16.794
In 2015, we have a really good and successful track record since then, financially, operationally, and academically.

04:39:16.814 --> 04:39:19.474
Do you want to take the next part?

04:39:19.734 --> 04:39:24.595
We sought the four new charters to comply with the ruling in Anderson versus Shasta lawsuit.

04:39:25.095 --> 04:39:32.697
All four new charters were denied, and we appealed to the State Board of Education last year.

04:39:33.277 --> 04:39:44.267
Based on CDE staff recommendation, we resubmitted to differentiate our four charters, and we resubmitted the petitions to align with local, county, and CDE recommendations already.

04:39:44.827 --> 04:39:48.991
All four petitions were denied the second time, and we are here before you again.

04:39:49.531 --> 04:39:52.734
So in the past four years, we've gone through this appeal process three times.

04:39:53.935 --> 04:39:55.016
It's been a challenge.

04:39:55.976 --> 04:40:03.002
But we do wish to thank the CDE for its recommendation to continue granting us our charter on appeal.

04:40:03.743 --> 04:40:08.267
And we've had a really, really wonderful working relationship with the CDE over the past three years.

04:40:08.307 --> 04:40:09.928
We're really thankful to them for that.

04:40:10.108 --> 04:40:10.589
It's been great.

04:40:11.810 --> 04:40:31.867
We also want to thank the ACCS for its strong support and we definitely concur with all the suggested technical amendments and will implement those by July 31st deadline So as far as our enrollment growth We came to you in 2015 We had around 320 students

04:40:36.155 --> 04:40:38.984
We did tell all of our students.

04:40:39.004 --> 04:40:40.509
We helped them find new placements.

04:40:41.291 --> 04:40:42.756
And we just went through a really

04:40:44.192 --> 04:40:46.434
pretty difficult transitional year that first year.

04:40:46.494 --> 04:40:51.637
We had 104 students at the beginning of the year, went up to 214 students the first year.

04:40:51.757 --> 04:40:56.300
Second year, we started with 276, quickly got back up to our 320 number.

04:40:56.921 --> 04:41:04.286
We thought we were going to stabilize at that point because over the past 17 years, all of Grove Charter was kind of stabilized around 350 students.

04:41:05.187 --> 04:41:09.369
But then we just kept going and enrolling every family that came to us because

04:41:10.390 --> 04:41:31.163
We just saw such a need the parents when they came in with their students Many times we're crying and desperate for I mean literally crying and desperate and so we just kept hiring teachers to support students And we ended the year last year Well the year before with 465 students as you can see then this year this past year we started with 520 ended with about 780 students

04:41:32.404 --> 04:41:38.566
And all of this growth is based of word of mouth and based of recommendations from the local school districts that we work with.

04:41:38.806 --> 04:41:44.008
And this is coming from the counselors, the special ed departments, and also coming from doctors.

04:41:44.068 --> 04:41:46.049
We do not do any marketing.

04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:50.131
We couldn't handle more students than we're already getting.

04:41:50.951 --> 04:41:58.034
But it's the word of mouth that we have gained respect for in the community for dealing with students who are DAS qualified and need specific supports.

04:41:58.714 --> 04:42:00.174
So this is all organic growth.

04:42:00.254 --> 04:42:01.455
None of this has been forced.

04:42:01.755 --> 04:42:06.338
Parole officers bring students to us, child protective agencies.

04:42:07.699 --> 04:42:09.161
Physicians, you already said that.

04:42:11.306 --> 04:42:16.710
So I know there's been some confusion over our dashboard alternative school status.

04:42:17.410 --> 04:42:21.753
Los Olivos never went and applied for ASAM.

04:42:22.934 --> 04:42:26.116
At the time, I mean, there wasn't need for them to.

04:42:26.517 --> 04:42:30.880
When we first became a school, we started looking at our student populations.

04:42:31.020 --> 04:42:37.324
I mean, we knew from our historical data, but we weren't sure if we met that threshold.

04:42:38.185 --> 04:42:40.226
As soon as we started realizing, oh yeah,

04:42:41.828 --> 04:42:43.290
We really do meet this threshold.

04:42:43.631 --> 04:42:47.717
We started the process, but then at that time there was a transition from ASAM to DAS.

04:42:47.957 --> 04:42:57.511
So we are still waiting for those indicators and the eligibility criteria before we finally were able to apply for that status, which we did receive.

04:43:01.135 --> 04:43:13.811
OK, so because of our DAS status, we felt that it was really best to compare our CASP results with other DAS schools in our area, because those are the same students.

04:43:13.871 --> 04:43:15.953
We get a lot of students from those schools as well.

04:43:16.814 --> 04:43:19.998
So when you look at the math CASP results, and again, we are

04:43:21.099 --> 04:43:42.721
We have a lot of improvements planned for this school year coming up, and I can go over those, but when you look at our math results, in comparison to Maple, which is in Lompoc Unified School District, La Cuesta, which is in Santa Barbara, and Delta, which is in Santa Maria Joint, their DAS schools had 0% that met or exceeded math.

04:43:43.702 --> 04:43:50.805
We had 10%, which is low, but at least we do have students that are meeting and exceeding, and we're working on improving that number.

04:43:54.086 --> 04:44:05.651
Our English Language Arts Cast results, you can see we have 41.77% that met or exceeded, and the other local DAS schools weren't really close comparatively.

04:44:06.875 --> 04:44:29.236
We're really proud about that and I do want to point out as we are at the ACCS meeting and one of the chairperson Was talking about the meat and the metons exceeded or met standards When they were comparing it with all Lompoc Unified School District, but that's not comparing apples to apples and we're trying to show you with Dash Dash qualification

04:44:29.696 --> 04:44:34.959
I don't know what it is yet, DAS or DASH, that we are succeeding.

04:44:35.199 --> 04:44:37.000
We are putting a lot of effort into this.

04:44:37.200 --> 04:44:38.680
And we don't accept where we are.

04:44:38.740 --> 04:44:42.642
We keep pushing forward because that's at the success of the student.

04:44:43.083 --> 04:44:49.506
But when you compare apples to apples, we're doing a really good job with the student base that we have.

04:44:49.986 --> 04:44:51.667
And part of that is based on our hiring.

04:44:51.767 --> 04:44:54.128
We don't hire anybody who isn't a warrior for kids.

04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:58.031
And that's really what the start of our interview process is.

04:44:58.131 --> 04:45:02.674
So this is based on dedication that goes far beyond eight hours a day.

04:45:03.294 --> 04:45:04.395
We're really proud of these numbers.

04:45:04.455 --> 04:45:10.980
I know it might not look like this, but when you look at the comparison in our counties, we're doing some really good things.

04:45:12.079 --> 04:45:21.473
And one thing we have found, actually, this past year we started implementing, Olive Grove has never had counselors before, so last year we hired two counselors school-wide.

04:45:22.275 --> 04:45:26.761
Next year we now have four hired, so one at each learning center.

04:45:27.342 --> 04:45:44.428
What we've noticed by, and we have a counselor, well, the head of our counseling department here to discuss what, that we've discovered over this past year is a lot of students that we didn't previously know were parenting or homeless, we've been able to identify since through our counselors.

04:45:44.888 --> 04:45:47.149
And we've been able to put additional supports in for them.

04:45:47.529 --> 04:45:52.671
So our numbers really are higher than what we first qualified with, so.

04:45:53.011 --> 04:45:53.971
Oh wait, this is the new one.

04:45:54.131 --> 04:45:54.812
Oh, okay.

04:45:55.752 --> 04:46:02.473
So our cohort graduation rates combined, well, our cohort graduation rate, 62.5%.

04:46:03.574 --> 04:46:08.555
As you can see, that's about three times higher than Maple and La Cuesta.

04:46:09.495 --> 04:46:17.196
And it's a little below Delta, but when you add in our still enrolled population, we do exceed all the other local DAS schools.

04:46:19.317 --> 04:46:25.198
This is, I think, what we're most proud about because many times our students come to us without having

04:46:26.107 --> 04:46:28.168
had any success in their education.

04:46:28.428 --> 04:46:37.491
And so they come to us and a lot of times you know the parents are desperate and parents do come with their students to our school most of the time.

04:46:37.691 --> 04:46:50.095
Sometimes that they're not able to but the students a lot of times won't even look us in the eye at first and they don't have much self-confidence.

04:46:50.896 --> 04:46:51.276
And so

04:46:52.679 --> 04:47:02.005
you know, very quickly they realize we are advocating for them as a person and as a human being who's worth advocating for.

04:47:02.685 --> 04:47:12.572
So these numbers on the school climate report card are really, really what we're most proud about because these students are feeling successful.

04:47:12.892 --> 04:47:14.413
They feel like they're being supported.

04:47:15.233 --> 04:47:24.623
We're on the 99th percentile both statewide and similar schools and our numbers did even increase over the path from 2017 to 18 so We're happy about that.

04:47:24.703 --> 04:47:25.924
Okay, so

04:47:30.802 --> 04:47:34.723
Our Renaissance growth is really how we track students individually.

04:47:34.803 --> 04:47:36.363
So we test them when they first come in.

04:47:37.704 --> 04:47:40.984
We test them at the beginning of every year, mid-year, and at the end of the year.

04:47:41.905 --> 04:47:46.646
And so in 2016, we started with 276 students.

04:47:46.706 --> 04:47:51.327
So this only reflects the students who were with us for an entire year.

04:47:51.347 --> 04:47:53.527
So you can see we did have growth in both.

04:47:54.007 --> 04:47:59.389
Then this past year, we did start lower, but we had over doubled in students.

04:48:01.952 --> 04:48:04.914
What we liked about this, though, we could see we had made actually greater gains.

04:48:04.974 --> 04:48:09.237
Even though we started lower, we had made greater gains than we made the previous year with these students.

04:48:09.677 --> 04:48:10.497
So that was exciting.

04:48:11.978 --> 04:48:15.200
So we don't have our LPEC scores back, I don't think, yet.

04:48:15.280 --> 04:48:18.262
But I put in our results from the year previous.

04:48:18.722 --> 04:48:25.807
And after we implemented new EL curriculum and supports this past year, we did reclassify 19%, as opposed to only 6% the year before.

04:48:29.690 --> 04:48:37.698
We are increasing, and next year we have plans for further improvements as well.

04:48:39.500 --> 04:48:43.725
All four schools are already admitted to El Dorado Charter SELPA.

04:48:44.225 --> 04:48:46.588
WASC accreditation process has already started.

04:48:46.728 --> 04:48:50.932
OGCS is fully WASC accredited at this moment for grades TK through 12.

04:48:51.913 --> 04:49:08.463
We worked with the auditor and CSMC so fiscal systems are already in place and ready to track each school separately And we worked with our attorneys young median core CSDC CCSA and CSMC to ensure the administration and governance are ready and in place as well

04:49:11.687 --> 04:49:19.318
So again, we're thanking everyone, but I did want to address your concern about ELs, which we'll have our EL staff come and speak as well.

04:49:20.760 --> 04:49:24.746
So we put in a lot of supports for our EL students.

04:49:26.189 --> 04:49:30.073
do have online supports, in-house supports.

04:49:30.673 --> 04:49:33.536
Students meet one-on-one with their teachers and they come for additional classes.

04:49:34.837 --> 04:49:37.159
We've doubled that time for next year as well.

04:49:38.701 --> 04:49:50.832
And while we say parents are the primary deliverers, that's usually in our TK through eighth grade, when students are in high school, we bump up the supports for them so that they get a lot more classroom-based.

04:49:51.572 --> 04:50:16.857
Support throughout the week So and then with Renaissance when we were showing you some of the data We're going to be remapping our SIS system to communicate with Renaissance as soon as we know that we're breaking up the schools And functioning differently, so we'll have better subgroup information And we can probably have that to you guys within 90 days if you have further questions on that Sherry who's going to be handling the remapping is here to answer that

04:50:18.629 --> 04:50:20.571
But we do meet with students individually.

04:50:20.611 --> 04:50:22.874
So really, each student is their own person in our eyes.

04:50:22.934 --> 04:50:29.042
So whether they're e-mail, I mean, to them, they're just, we care about each one individually.

04:50:29.082 --> 04:50:31.685
So we're tracking them as a unique individual.

04:50:31.705 --> 04:50:35.429
And since we are DAS, we're tracking them individually.

04:50:36.710 --> 04:50:38.431
We are DAS qualified.

04:50:38.451 --> 04:50:42.012
I mean, each student, whether or not they're EL, they also have these additional needs.

04:50:42.233 --> 04:50:43.753
They've had gaps in their education.

04:50:43.773 --> 04:50:44.554
They've been homeless.

04:50:44.574 --> 04:50:47.035
There's other things that they have that we're helping them with.

04:50:47.975 --> 04:50:53.738
We started this year, too, also providing bus passes because we noticed kids were not able to make it to support classes.

04:50:53.758 --> 04:50:55.038
So we're trying to find out why.

04:50:55.058 --> 04:50:56.479
Why aren't you able to make it?

04:50:57.239 --> 04:50:59.480
So we're purchasing bus passes.

04:50:59.521 --> 04:51:04.443
We're doing everything we can to help get them to school and accessing those supports.

04:51:05.723 --> 04:51:07.043
That's it, unless you have questions.

04:51:08.304 --> 04:51:08.704
Thank you.

04:51:08.724 --> 04:51:09.144
Okay, thank you.

04:51:09.184 --> 04:51:12.405
We'll have questions later for you.

04:51:12.605 --> 04:51:17.386
And so that now completes the supporters of the petition.

04:51:17.426 --> 04:51:19.246
So the opponents have 20 minutes.

04:51:20.247 --> 04:51:23.507
Opponents to the petition have 20 minutes.

04:51:23.647 --> 04:51:24.468
Please come forward.

04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.610
No, no presentation.

04:51:36.741 --> 04:51:46.547
Does this work?

04:51:48.067 --> 04:51:48.608
Just close it.

04:51:49.949 --> 04:51:50.609
Technology.

04:51:53.090 --> 04:51:55.972
Need that computer science stuff you were talking about earlier.

04:51:57.546 --> 04:52:00.867
All right, well, good afternoon, President Kurse, board members.

04:52:01.907 --> 04:52:02.867
My name is Kevin Fannin.

04:52:02.927 --> 04:52:05.028
I'm with the law firm of Dance Well over Kelly.

04:52:05.408 --> 04:52:08.729
I'm here on behalf of Santa Maria Joint Union High School District.

04:52:09.249 --> 04:52:15.651
Superintendent Mark Richardson requested that I appear at this meeting today on behalf of Santa Maria, and I'm here with

04:52:16.397 --> 04:52:17.559
Hi, I'm Kristen Lindgren.

04:52:17.579 --> 04:52:22.967
I'm with Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, and my firm represents the Santa Ynez Valley Union High School District.

04:52:23.468 --> 04:52:27.314
And Superintendent Scott Corey also asked me to come on his behalf.

04:52:28.696 --> 04:52:31.838
So we are already planned to present together.

04:52:31.938 --> 04:52:39.564
So I'm glad that we ended up with that plan for all four petitions, primarily because they're so similar and a lot of the issues are the same between them.

04:52:39.884 --> 04:52:45.668
But I'm going to start with some sort of broad strokes about this appeal.

04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:49.450
And really, this appeal is not for a new charter school.

04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:52.592
This is an existing charter school with existing operations.

04:52:53.473 --> 04:52:56.795
And we hope that the appeal process should really reflect that.

04:52:59.107 --> 04:53:04.889
The petition should really explain what the charter school is doing and not what it will do in the future.

04:53:05.729 --> 04:53:10.310
And our districts have sort of felt that the petitions were lacking in that respect.

04:53:11.050 --> 04:53:20.773
Now, by way of history, the CD discussed the history of these charter schools, but we want to emphasize that six separate school districts have denied this charter school.

04:53:22.114 --> 04:53:24.634
Of those six districts, four of those petitions were appealed.

04:53:25.355 --> 04:53:26.075
The county board

04:53:27.014 --> 04:53:40.342
denied that petition as well and all these denials have essentially held the same thing that petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program and the chart petition does not contain a reasonably comprehensive description of all the elements.

04:53:40.903 --> 04:53:42.604
We've cited mostly all of the same elements.

04:53:42.964 --> 04:53:50.409
We've come to the same conclusions and we're separate districts with separate staffs and separate councils and we've all came to the same conclusion and

04:53:52.677 --> 04:53:56.780
The petition before you, which the CD didn't mention, was initially appealed to the SBE.

04:53:57.421 --> 04:54:01.844
The CD recommended denial, and then NACCS voted 4 to 3 to deny.

04:54:02.725 --> 04:54:09.750
And then petitioners withdrew for the petitions from consideration, amended those petitions, and then resubmitted them locally to us.

04:54:10.711 --> 04:54:21.760
And as local districts, we kind of expected the petitions to be significantly different to address our concerns since they went back during the appeal, and that was not our feeling.

04:54:22.441 --> 04:54:33.544
And all four districts, including Santa Maria and Santa Ynez, we denied the petitions again, generally on the same findings that were not cured during this process.

04:54:34.425 --> 04:54:47.008
However, this time the CD recommended approval with conditions, many of which are significantly material to the denial, to our denial, and they do not reflect a program that is currently open and existing.

04:54:48.909 --> 04:54:51.450
My colleague will go into these problems in more detail.

04:54:52.369 --> 04:54:57.210
But CDE recommends revisions to the petition for key elements to the program.

04:54:57.490 --> 04:55:07.652
These include the education program, the measurable pupil outcomes, employee qualifications, admission requirements, suspension and expulsion procedures, and the dispute resolution procedures.

04:55:08.332 --> 04:55:10.853
These are key elements of what a charter should propose.

04:55:10.953 --> 04:55:17.915
And if a currently existing charter is already operating, it should be not very difficult to describe those in a meaningful way.

04:55:22.737 --> 04:55:35.945
So just by way of example, and I'm glad we're already speaking about the English learners piece, but a lack of description about serving English learners may be indicative of a lack of serving English learners.

04:55:36.285 --> 04:55:38.046
And the data certainly supports that.

04:55:40.167 --> 04:55:42.528
CD found lots of budget deficiencies.

04:55:42.789 --> 04:55:45.710
They found that the petitioners overstated LCFF revenue.

04:55:46.511 --> 04:55:49.793
And they had to adjust those calculations in order to do its budget analysis.

04:55:50.865 --> 04:56:03.092
They found that the budget understated expenditures for employing health and welfare benefits, and they could not determine whether salaries are reasonable because of a lack of description.

04:56:03.432 --> 04:56:14.819
So what was requested was to submit a new budget by June 30th, and they found that as proposed, the budget was only marginally viable.

04:56:16.279 --> 04:56:18.261
And now a new budget has been submitted.

04:56:22.031 --> 04:56:28.093
data that has been made satisfactory to the CDE, but this was essentially created by the CDE.

04:56:28.374 --> 04:56:36.877
And just in general, when you make a budget, I know when I budget my own expenses, it's very important that I make the budget because I'm the one who's following it.

04:56:37.537 --> 04:56:46.361
So we question the ability to just sort of change a budget right before the approval as an example that it will actually be followed through with.

04:56:47.745 --> 04:56:53.466
And as post-Anderson, I know the state board is really developing a larger portfolio of charter schools.

04:56:54.607 --> 04:57:04.529
And we hope in the future that budgets should be more than marginally viable and that petitions should really reflect their operations that are actually going to occur.

04:57:05.789 --> 04:57:14.771
So as proposed, the CDE, six districts, the Santa Barbara County Board of Education, they all concluded that this petition was

04:57:15.936 --> 04:57:26.446
essentially not within the meaning, would not satisfy the Charter Schools Act and the only way that it could be is for it to be significantly revised with conditions.

04:57:27.446 --> 04:57:32.891
And so we essentially feel that that shouldn't be how charter schools are

04:57:33.834 --> 04:57:35.876
brought forth to the State Board.

04:57:36.736 --> 04:57:40.559
The Education Code and CDE provide resources for school districts and county offices.

04:57:41.260 --> 04:57:44.763
They provide a process, guidelines, a template for review.

04:57:45.103 --> 04:57:51.728
All the districts, including my district, San Ynez, and Santa Barbara County, we've utilized this process, these templates.

04:57:52.289 --> 04:57:59.674
We've all came to the same conclusion, now multiple times, and we've committed significant time and resources in taking this

04:58:00.689 --> 04:58:03.512
sort of, we've taken this process really seriously.

04:58:04.513 --> 04:58:10.058
And we just essentially hope that the state board sort of gives deference to our expertise.

04:58:11.019 --> 04:58:14.202
So my colleague is going to now speak about specifics in the petition.

04:58:14.962 --> 04:58:16.524
And I thank you for this opportunity to speak with you.

04:58:18.459 --> 04:58:18.919
Hello again.

04:58:19.899 --> 04:58:28.201
So we share the concern about English learners in this learning environment with the blended independent study and homeschool environment.

04:58:28.501 --> 04:58:45.385
It's very unclear from the petition how English learner parents will be supported in a way that they'll be able to assist their students in coming up to speed to the point that they can become reclassified or otherwise being able to modify the curriculum for them.

04:58:47.921 --> 04:59:04.461
CDE staff and its recommendation to the advisory commission noted that the EL plan actually fails to contain a comparison of the pupils' performance in basic skills against an empirically established range of performance in basic skills.

04:59:04.881 --> 04:59:19.051
based upon the performance of English proficient pupils of the same age, so that they could demonstrate that a pupil sufficiently has become proficient in the curriculum of native English speakers.

04:59:19.311 --> 04:59:26.636
It maybe feels like a small portion of what we're looking at, but it feels really important that those kind of

04:59:27.516 --> 04:59:33.760
Measures are in place, you know when we we hear that they have a 19% reclassification rate How is that being done?

04:59:33.840 --> 04:59:50.329
We don't know and so that is of a major concern with respect to the EL plan in the charter petition We pulled some numbers and the most recent we were able to find to show that the County of Santa Barbara has a 32% English learner rate

04:59:53.752 --> 04:59:59.822
And the currently operating all Grove Charter School has a 13.4% rate.

05:00:00.142 --> 05:00:02.306
I acknowledge those may be slightly old numbers.

05:00:02.326 --> 05:00:03.808
That's what we were able to pull up.

05:00:04.670 --> 05:00:06.933
But it does seem that there may be

05:00:09.460 --> 05:00:24.098
English learner parents who are not even applying to the school because the program is going to be problematic for them to implement, particularly in TK through eighth grade, where the parents are the primary providers of the educational program.

05:00:27.345 --> 05:00:31.987
Again, as my colleague notes, this is a charter school that's been operating for several years.

05:00:32.367 --> 05:00:38.110
We would expect them to have that information in the charter petition and did not see any of that.

05:00:39.771 --> 05:00:55.119
With respect to measurable pupil outcomes, which is a little bit of a similar issue, CDE noted that the measurable pupil outcomes were not clear in the petition, either with respect to general measurable pupil outcomes

05:00:55.959 --> 05:01:01.341
or with the eight state priorities for the LCAP.

05:01:01.601 --> 05:01:14.205
So what we saw and Santa Maria particularly noted this in their staff report with respect to denial that was adopted by their board is that for the eight state priorities,

05:01:15.485 --> 05:01:21.669
There are listed plans of things that will happen as opposed to actual outcomes for the students.

05:01:21.709 --> 05:01:29.013
So we will increase support or we will provide access to a counselor, but we don't know what those outcomes look like.

05:01:29.113 --> 05:01:34.376
And with respect to the general measurable pupil outcomes, they're pretty vague.

05:01:35.196 --> 05:01:36.097
It's unclear.

05:01:36.297 --> 05:01:43.401
And while I appreciate the petitioner's hard work and the fact that they have increased their test scores, given that,

05:01:44.581 --> 05:01:52.487
We would want to be sure that those measurable pupil outcomes were clearly defined and able to be measured and carried out.

05:01:52.807 --> 05:02:00.232
And it does not appear from at least the face of the petition that that is something that we can count on moving forward with this program.

05:02:03.044 --> 05:02:08.087
With regard to special education, we have sort of a similar concern as we do with English learners.

05:02:08.427 --> 05:02:15.412
It's really unclear how this blended program is going to be able to support the majority of students who are eligible for special education.

05:02:16.813 --> 05:02:20.135
The CDE staff noted that there are no

05:02:20.815 --> 05:02:23.237
Qualifications given for the special education director.

05:02:23.337 --> 05:02:32.023
I'm not sure there is a special education director that information has been sort of evolving throughout this process Which has been long we agree.

05:02:32.043 --> 05:02:32.063
I

05:02:34.639 --> 05:02:40.784
But we are unclear how many special education students are actually being served at this point, or how many will be served.

05:02:41.144 --> 05:02:42.965
The budget seems to indicate not very many.

05:02:43.325 --> 05:02:52.032
And again, we're concerned about the problem of special education parents feeling like they can't bring their students to the school because the supports are not there.

05:02:52.052 --> 05:02:58.316
And they're to be the primary providers, particularly from TK through eighth grade.

05:03:00.498 --> 05:03:02.199
Just a couple other.

05:03:03.301 --> 05:03:05.708
Notes with respect to student discipline.

05:03:05.728 --> 05:03:07.794
There are a couple of issues that popped up.

05:03:08.396 --> 05:03:08.416
I

05:03:10.942 --> 05:03:13.884
And one of them applies to special education as well.

05:03:14.325 --> 05:03:33.480
As you may know, a student who has engaged in certain behavior but is eligible for special education services and is under an IEP, if they engage in severe bodily harm, they bring a weapon to school, they bring illegal drugs to school, there's a process by which they can be given an alternative interim placement for 45 days.

05:03:34.381 --> 05:03:40.125
But you can't do that unless you have an administrative law judge, hearing officer grant that request.

05:03:40.546 --> 05:03:45.789
And the charter provides that.

05:03:46.290 --> 05:03:49.052
That can just be done without a hearing officer's approval.

05:03:49.252 --> 05:03:50.873
The charter school could actually do that 45 day.

05:03:52.474 --> 05:03:58.858
interim placement on its own, which violates federal special education law, which does apply to a charter school.

05:03:59.238 --> 05:04:06.022
So things like that kind of raise concerns about how special education is being carried out in the district.

05:04:06.782 --> 05:04:16.628
Also, the petition does not provide for recent changes to the Charter Schools Act, which requires certain due process requirements for

05:04:17.428 --> 05:04:20.529
suspensions of students of less than 10 days and greater than 10 days.

05:04:21.389 --> 05:04:23.749
And so, yes, that can be fixed in the petition.

05:04:24.189 --> 05:04:37.892
Maybe that's a technical change that needs to be made, but it raises concerns about the knowledge of the petitioners as far as changes to special or to education law, the education code, the monster that we all deal with every day, right?

05:04:38.532 --> 05:04:46.173
And that is something that we need to see in order to approve a petition, which is why our districts have not approved the petition.

05:04:46.693 --> 05:04:52.938
So, those are just some of the most important points that we wanted to make.

05:04:52.958 --> 05:04:59.523
You guys have all the documentation, all of the basis for all of the rejection.

05:04:59.864 --> 05:05:05.949
We didn't want to take your time reiterating everything, but we just wanted to point out a few of those points.

05:05:06.749 --> 05:05:12.674
And again, as my colleague mentioned, we hope that you will agree with all of us.

05:05:13.094 --> 05:05:14.215
Thank you so much for your time.

05:05:14.275 --> 05:05:15.236
We really appreciate it.

05:05:17.320 --> 05:05:18.100
Thank you.

05:05:19.722 --> 05:05:20.883
Okay.

05:05:20.903 --> 05:05:24.426
So, we want to go directly to public comment at this point.

05:05:25.106 --> 05:05:25.426
Okay.

05:05:25.466 --> 05:05:26.827
Directly to public comment.

05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:29.029
Please call the roll.

05:05:29.950 --> 05:05:32.192
Would the following speakers please line up at the podium.

05:05:32.532 --> 05:05:36.075
Wendy Sanders, Elsa Martinez, Mari Mitchell.

05:05:38.897 --> 05:05:39.438
Okay.

05:05:39.458 --> 05:05:41.139
Now the public hearing closed.

05:05:42.620 --> 05:05:42.841
Yeah.

05:05:43.001 --> 05:05:44.342
And people have two minutes.

05:05:45.959 --> 05:05:47.801
I thought you closed it after the public.

05:05:47.841 --> 05:06:04.178
Jennifer Cloud, Allison Reed, Sherry Kynart, Brooke Lawrence, Laurel Severo, Ryan Joy, Brandon Ray Devine, Jim Burke, Lorraine Richards, Angela Deramos, Ramel Antone, and Eric Premack.

05:06:13.405 --> 05:06:18.589
I'm Wendy Sanders, the incoming special education director for the North State Charter JPA.

05:06:19.189 --> 05:06:25.973
The JPA provides special education expertise to charter schools, working closely with the Ed Code Charter SELPA.

05:06:26.754 --> 05:06:36.360
My JPA colleagues and I have been working with the Olive Grove for three years, helping first with setting up a compliant, effective special education program.

05:06:37.041 --> 05:06:42.384
And since, continuing to answer questions related to special education program implementation.

05:06:43.665 --> 05:06:51.550
Olive Grove has actually been sought out by and very responsive to students with disabilities and their families.

05:06:52.270 --> 05:06:56.252
Currently they serve approximately 90 students with disabilities.

05:06:56.272 --> 05:07:12.161
20% of those students came to Olive Grove eligible for IEPs as students with emotional disturbance often because those students were unsuccessful at their district schools and parents report unwelcome.

05:07:13.888 --> 05:07:32.540
The JPA would continue to work with all the Olive Grove schools for the 2018-2019 school year, providing special education consultation, including consultation for any mental health, behavior, suspension, expulsion, and dispute resolution situations that would arise.

05:07:33.621 --> 05:07:42.346
I am confident that Olive Grove schools will continue to meet the unique, wide-ranging needs of special education students on the Central Coast.

05:07:43.007 --> 05:07:43.307
Thank you.

05:07:49.717 --> 05:07:50.358
Good afternoon.

05:07:50.418 --> 05:07:55.543
My name is Maddie Michelle, and this is Elsa Martinez, and she'll be taking up some of my time as well.

05:07:58.706 --> 05:07:59.126
I don't know.

05:08:00.527 --> 05:08:01.048
Not on this?

05:08:01.348 --> 05:08:01.708
This one?

05:08:01.728 --> 05:08:02.369
It's on, yeah.

05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:04.030
Okay, speak up then.

05:08:04.151 --> 05:08:04.951
Okay, sorry.

05:08:05.372 --> 05:08:06.493
My name is Maddie Michelle.

05:08:06.533 --> 05:08:06.753
Okay.

05:08:07.113 --> 05:08:10.737
And this is Elsa Martinez, and she'll be taking up some of my time, so she has less.

05:08:12.515 --> 05:08:17.319
So I came to Olive Grove Charter School because I wasn't on the right path.

05:08:17.799 --> 05:08:21.442
I would always be getting D's and skipping school, doing drugs.

05:08:22.343 --> 05:08:24.124
I was dealing with a lot.

05:08:24.405 --> 05:08:25.806
I was dealing with depression as well.

05:08:26.546 --> 05:08:28.768
School wasn't my thing from the very beginning.

05:08:28.848 --> 05:08:32.571
I was bullied a lot when I was younger and didn't have great experiences with school.

05:08:33.912 --> 05:08:37.874
I never liked school or teacher I just thought of all of them had no passion and just didn't care.

05:08:38.435 --> 05:08:43.558
When I entered high school I moved three times simply because I didn't like school and I would always be ditching.

05:08:44.098 --> 05:08:47.960
Sadly I was stuck in the district until my junior year when I found out about Olive Grove.

05:08:49.341 --> 05:08:53.723
Let me tell you, from the very beginning, they did everything in their power to help me and make sure I succeeded.

05:08:53.743 --> 05:08:55.923
I was truly happy at the school.

05:08:56.243 --> 05:08:57.384
I came in very guarded.

05:08:57.404 --> 05:09:01.385
I had my walls up, and I didn't want any help because of my past experience with school.

05:09:02.446 --> 05:09:04.586
But my teacher never gave up on me or anyone there.

05:09:04.866 --> 05:09:07.387
It was like they were family and they never let you down.

05:09:07.627 --> 05:09:09.128
They helped me get through a lot.

05:09:09.408 --> 05:09:10.608
They understand.

05:09:10.668 --> 05:09:11.449
They ask what's wrong.

05:09:11.489 --> 05:09:12.149
They simply care.

05:09:12.909 --> 05:09:14.810
They saw the potential in me when I didn't.

05:09:14.890 --> 05:09:17.551
They pushed me to do things that I would have never thought of doing.

05:09:18.511 --> 05:09:20.352
I'm not a big fan of public speaking.

05:09:20.433 --> 05:09:22.154
Honestly, I don't like it at all.

05:09:23.154 --> 05:09:30.219
But can you believe I took a speech and debate class with the push of my teacher because he simply believed I was good at speaking and I should work on it?

05:09:31.500 --> 05:09:34.482
Even with my mom, my mom is a Hispanic who doesn't speak English.

05:09:34.642 --> 05:09:39.125
In regular school, nobody did anything to inform her about my behavior, grades, or attendance.

05:09:39.925 --> 05:09:45.630
At Olive Grove, could you believe my teacher would take the time of his day and write a letter to her and translate it on Google Translate?

05:09:46.211 --> 05:09:52.216
He would always be texting her and my brother telling them if I was okay, how I'm doing, if I need help with anything, always.

05:09:53.177 --> 05:09:58.821
My mom... Go ahead.

05:09:59.262 --> 05:09:59.742
I'll go ahead?

05:09:59.942 --> 05:10:03.125
They said that they can't combine the time.

05:10:03.986 --> 05:10:07.809
Oh, well, you can, yeah, then you can talk next, okay?

05:10:09.022 --> 05:10:11.102
I was giving her my time because she had so much to say.

05:10:11.262 --> 05:10:11.963
Oh, OK.

05:10:12.103 --> 05:10:13.463
Well, we'll give you more then.

05:10:13.523 --> 05:10:13.783
Yeah.

05:10:13.823 --> 05:10:14.443
You finish.

05:10:14.563 --> 05:10:16.084
Go ahead.

05:10:16.484 --> 05:10:16.764
OK.

05:10:17.524 --> 05:10:20.785
My mom was very surprised and appreciated very much that someone involved her.

05:10:21.285 --> 05:10:24.185
I definitely felt that I was meant to be in this world.

05:10:24.445 --> 05:10:31.887
If I wouldn't show up to a meeting, my teacher would go crazy trying to contact me, looking for me at my house, because he would not let me go back into my bad habits.

05:10:32.347 --> 05:10:36.008
The whole entire time I've been in school, my best grades were all out of growth.

05:10:36.608 --> 05:10:43.294
My freshman year I went from a 0.83 and over 100 cuts to graduating with 3.2 with zero cuts.

05:10:43.954 --> 05:10:49.219
If you would have told me this today four years ago or just simply saying I would have graduated, I would have never believed you.

05:10:49.939 --> 05:10:51.781
I probably would have dropped out of school by now.

05:10:52.301 --> 05:10:55.984
I'm currently working on going to Allan Hancock to study psychology.

05:10:56.545 --> 05:11:00.528
I wish I would have known the school existed a long time ago because I would have wanted to be here all my life.

05:11:01.089 --> 05:11:03.130
Olive Grove gave me hope in school again and

05:11:04.031 --> 05:11:06.358
And I know I'm not alone in anything, and I'm truly grateful.

05:11:06.819 --> 05:11:07.140
Thank you.

05:11:07.662 --> 05:11:07.963
Thank you.

05:11:14.514 --> 05:11:16.936
Hi, I'm not on speaker.

05:11:16.976 --> 05:11:18.717
Well, I'll just use my teacher voice then.

05:11:20.118 --> 05:11:20.998
I might have cut in line.

05:11:21.098 --> 05:11:22.039
I'm Jennifer Cloud.

05:11:22.079 --> 05:11:25.121
I'm the principal at the Lompoc Olive Grove Charter Learning Center.

05:11:25.982 --> 05:11:28.143
So we had another great successful year.

05:11:28.444 --> 05:11:33.167
And I just brought my little sticky note, teachers love sticky notes, of some things to come.

05:11:34.107 --> 05:11:36.129
So we initiated a STEM program.

05:11:36.149 --> 05:11:38.731
So I was really grateful to hear some feedback about STEM.

05:11:40.763 --> 05:11:44.264
And we're advancing that into third through fifth grade this year.

05:11:45.004 --> 05:11:47.185
So we're really excited to offer that.

05:11:47.465 --> 05:11:51.446
And the parents were really excited to hear that we would proceed forward.

05:11:51.746 --> 05:11:55.267
We have a new science teacher coming in to offer science support labs.

05:11:56.168 --> 05:12:03.110
And he's also going to be offering other supports, programming, someone mentioned that in here.

05:12:04.010 --> 05:12:08.473
And occasionally in our STEM class, we do make paper airplanes and throw them, so Ms.

05:12:08.513 --> 05:12:10.275
Rucker.

05:12:10.875 --> 05:12:13.877
And all in the name of science and STEM, of course.

05:12:14.637 --> 05:12:17.239
And I'm super excited this year.

05:12:17.800 --> 05:12:28.106
The last time I spoke, I was looking forward to the prospect of adopting new ELA curriculum for 6th through 12th grade, which has happened, so I've got my hands on it.

05:12:28.507 --> 05:12:33.210
And I'm developing that along with the other English teachers.

05:12:34.751 --> 05:12:37.052
And we're also adopted new social studies.

05:12:37.192 --> 05:12:41.815
So I'm really looking forward to bringing that on board on the new Common Core curriculum.

05:12:42.676 --> 05:12:45.457
And we also have a new supplemental math support.

05:12:45.497 --> 05:12:47.359
We see a need for that in our classroom.

05:12:48.039 --> 05:12:51.821
And our test scores, unfortunately, they do prove that.

05:12:51.901 --> 05:12:55.904
So we're really working hard to remedy the gap.

05:12:58.478 --> 05:13:00.479
But the counseling services, that's something new.

05:13:00.539 --> 05:13:03.740
I called it my unicorn because when I was a kid, I loved unicorns.

05:13:03.800 --> 05:13:06.421
But they were just like fig bar in my imagination.

05:13:06.461 --> 05:13:09.502
And so now that we have one on the ground, and she's just awesome.

05:13:09.522 --> 05:13:10.523
She wasn't able to attend.

05:13:11.743 --> 05:13:14.924
But she's just offered so much for our students already.

05:13:15.185 --> 05:13:19.626
And I'm really looking forward to working with her next year, this coming year, excuse me.

05:13:22.107 --> 05:13:27.572
I wish I could tell you more about all the fabulous kids we have and the parents, but maybe you'd like to come and visit.

05:13:27.912 --> 05:13:34.218
Thank you very much today.

05:13:34.238 --> 05:13:43.606
Hi, my name is Allison Reed, and I've actually been a teacher at Olive Grove for, this is my 13th year, so I've been around for a while, I've seen a lot.

05:13:44.446 --> 05:13:49.751
And I've always believed in our school, I've always thought we were doing amazing things, but now more than ever, it's just,

05:13:50.251 --> 05:13:58.235
We have gone above and beyond with the support classes we offer, like the EL classes, math and English labs.

05:13:58.475 --> 05:14:02.477
We have more than we have had in a while, and we just keep progressing.

05:14:02.497 --> 05:14:05.839
And that's the biggest thing that I've seen in the 13 years is that we never stop.

05:14:05.859 --> 05:14:07.160
We're always trying to improve.

05:14:07.880 --> 05:14:15.024
And I could sit or stand here and tell you about all the amazing stories that I've seen over the last 13 years, and I keep in touch with a lot of my former students.

05:14:15.585 --> 05:14:22.189
One I just want to bring up is the fact that we do serve students who have anxiety, who can't go to school for a variety of reasons.

05:14:22.229 --> 05:14:26.251
Maybe they're bullied or they have medical issues.

05:14:26.331 --> 05:14:30.313
I had a student this past year who was coming to our school because his older brother was

05:14:31.374 --> 05:14:32.435
Had a rare heart condition.

05:14:32.675 --> 05:14:37.617
He ended up passing away at 19 and the younger brother ended up being diagnosed with the exact same condition.

05:14:37.837 --> 05:14:41.959
So his mom has I mean she had to take him to doctor's appointments in L.A.

05:14:42.140 --> 05:14:43.440
and all over the place.

05:14:43.580 --> 05:14:45.461
And I mean they couldn't attend a regular school.

05:14:45.481 --> 05:14:46.442
They didn't have any options.

05:14:46.822 --> 05:14:47.702
They found Olive Grove.

05:14:47.842 --> 05:14:50.144
And I mean he's doing amazing.

05:14:51.725 --> 05:14:53.386
I think the prognosis is looking good.

05:14:54.247 --> 05:15:02.554
So he's just, I still have him as a student and he's doing really, really well and his mom is just, you know, over the moon to have found us and so he's not missing out on school.

05:15:04.316 --> 05:15:14.685
You know, I have students that I still keep in touch with and it's amazing to see from when they came in and they were, they come in and they just, they don't have faith in school anymore.

05:15:14.705 --> 05:15:16.127
They've been maybe beat down by

05:15:17.488 --> 05:15:20.650
just large groups and not being focused on that individual attention.

05:15:20.750 --> 05:15:26.976
But then when you actually talk to them, you're sitting down and you get to chat about, you know, their home life and, you know, their favorite things to do.

05:15:26.996 --> 05:15:27.936
What are you doing this weekend?

05:15:27.956 --> 05:15:30.919
You know, and they just, you connect with them on a different level.

05:15:32.120 --> 05:15:34.902
And so it's just, it's really cool to have that relationship with them.

05:15:34.922 --> 05:15:35.362
And I really- Time.

05:15:35.382 --> 05:15:35.463
Okay.

05:15:36.383 --> 05:15:36.744
Well, thank you.

05:15:40.828 --> 05:15:41.388
Good afternoon.

05:15:42.029 --> 05:15:45.011
My name is Brooke Lawrence, and I'm a teacher with Olive Grove Charter School.

05:15:45.051 --> 05:15:53.438
I'm also the ELD coordinator, so I just wanted to speak to you a moment about what we offer our students, and our EL students in particular, and answer any questions that you may have.

05:15:54.258 --> 05:15:57.421
So Laura actually did an amazing job covering what we do.

05:15:58.281 --> 05:16:00.624
We have curriculum that is ELD aligned.

05:16:00.664 --> 05:16:03.106
It's common core aligned to the standards.

05:16:03.166 --> 05:16:07.571
And I know our friends had a question about what are their student learning outcomes.

05:16:08.011 --> 05:16:13.857
And ultimately the outcome is that they increase their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writing.

05:16:13.897 --> 05:16:18.502
And that is what our lessons are geared towards every single day.

05:16:19.542 --> 05:16:22.364
We have doubled our supports for those students.

05:16:23.204 --> 05:16:36.370
They have in-class support where they come four hours a week and they'll be receiving that instruction that's aligned to the common core curriculum that they're being given and they're also being exposed to project-based learning units.

05:16:36.390 --> 05:16:42.913
They're going to be receiving experiential learning through field trips and so we do offer a lot of support and

05:16:43.493 --> 05:16:50.600
Honestly, I believe our students receive more support than at a traditional school simply because they have so much one-on-one time with their teachers.

05:16:51.361 --> 05:16:55.444
I have a student this last year and he was with me almost all week.

05:16:55.504 --> 05:16:59.328
He would come in and anytime he had a question, I was right there for him.

05:16:59.668 --> 05:17:01.490
I was able to support him in his learning.

05:17:02.711 --> 05:17:09.093
And this is a story for so many of our students where they can't function in larger group settings as Ali was sharing.

05:17:09.614 --> 05:17:11.534
And this is just a better fit for them.

05:17:11.975 --> 05:17:19.958
And so thank you for considering us because I know that is an option that our students need and that they greatly depend on.

05:17:20.598 --> 05:17:23.219
Are there any questions about our ELD supports?

05:17:24.419 --> 05:17:25.420
We'll have those later.

05:17:25.500 --> 05:17:26.900
This is public testimony.

05:17:27.060 --> 05:17:27.540
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:17:27.600 --> 05:17:27.680
OK.

05:17:28.021 --> 05:17:28.281
Thank you.

05:17:37.435 --> 05:17:40.576
Good evening, I'm Brandon Ray Estrella.

05:17:40.817 --> 05:17:41.257
Can you not hear?

05:17:42.037 --> 05:17:43.278
Yeah, speak up a little if you can.

05:17:43.318 --> 05:17:44.198
OK.

05:17:44.518 --> 05:17:46.019
I've been with Olive Grove for five years.

05:17:46.459 --> 05:17:55.423
I was recommended Olive Grove because they couldn't handle me in public school because I would speak out and I would try to go ahead, which was unrecommended, and looked down upon.

05:17:57.064 --> 05:17:59.265
When I came to Olive Grove, I was terrified.

05:17:59.285 --> 05:18:02.666
I was a social butterfly, and I thought that being homeschooled was going to take that away.

05:18:03.207 --> 05:18:04.947
But the one-on-one teacher, the one-on-one

05:18:06.428 --> 05:18:27.538
like the way the teachers helped me one-on-one it helped me excel in school and see myself do better things so I fell in love with the piano and Olive Grove gave me the time to develop that skill and I've been playing for three years and it's all self-taught and I've made three symphonies and I have performed them

05:18:29.318 --> 05:18:33.399
I started off at Olive Grove with a 2.5 GPA.

05:18:33.919 --> 05:18:38.680
I finished with a 3.8, almost to a 4.0, and graduated early.

05:18:39.560 --> 05:18:42.221
Olive Grove has been there for me, and they're like family.

05:18:44.301 --> 05:18:47.122
The teachers are loving, they're kind, and they're always willing to help.

05:18:48.042 --> 05:18:51.782
They always have time, and that's something that I didn't see in a public school.

05:18:53.143 --> 05:18:54.083
With a class of like 30 people,

05:18:55.203 --> 05:19:02.092
And you don't see people's personalities, because there's always other people over-masking it.

05:19:02.172 --> 05:19:05.896
But they see who you are as a person, and they develop that.

05:19:06.297 --> 05:19:08.119
And it's a beautiful thing to watch.

05:19:09.140 --> 05:19:10.642
I've been a TA for some of the teachers.

05:19:11.703 --> 05:19:23.552
And I've seen kids come and go who have been struggling and seeing how the teachers react to it is so professional and so beautiful and so encouraging to give the kids the hope that they need.

05:19:24.173 --> 05:19:27.616
And being one of that is just amazing and astounding.

05:19:28.576 --> 05:19:29.017
Thank you.

05:19:36.122 --> 05:19:36.582
Right here, right?

05:19:36.702 --> 05:19:36.903
This one?

05:19:38.571 --> 05:19:39.752
Hi, my name is Ryan Joy.

05:19:39.792 --> 05:19:42.715
I'm an education specialist at the Santa Barbara site.

05:19:43.216 --> 05:19:49.741
I just wanted to quickly talk about the importance of our school and our delivery model as it pertains to special education.

05:19:50.802 --> 05:20:00.971
Working with students one-on-one is just so beneficial to me as an educator and to all of our teachers because it allows us to individualize

05:20:02.330 --> 05:20:14.396
Lessons and assignments and instruction to the special needs of our students, which is of course like best practice for all students But it's particularly important when you're talking about Students with different learning disabilities or different strengths and different weaknesses.

05:20:14.476 --> 05:20:26.902
So our model really allows for so much flexibility in that regard And I think it's also what I found this is I don't have the 13 years Ali does this is my first year with our school, but what I found is the one-on-one

05:20:28.599 --> 05:20:51.388
Setting allows you to develop a relationship that is so much more impactful as you've heard from some of these students and so much more motivating and like in our core values group on part of the emotional social emotional team and we've talked about and discussed the importance of like charismatic teachers and developing those relationships and we've all seen cute YouTube videos of teachers standing at the door and doing handshakes with their students and

05:20:52.652 --> 05:20:55.196
to develop relationships like that is so important.

05:20:55.416 --> 05:21:01.945
And our delivery model allows for that so much more than other settings that I've worked in.

05:21:01.965 --> 05:21:05.170
And I just think that's a really important thing that we bring to these students.

05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:06.111
So thank you for your time.

05:21:10.373 --> 05:21:13.874
Hello, my name is Laurel Servo and the Dean of Students at Olive Grove.

05:21:14.555 --> 05:21:18.996
Before I was at Olive Grove, I actually was at Orchid Academy, which I know was mentioned by one of you earlier.

05:21:19.016 --> 05:21:20.937
And I was also the dean there.

05:21:21.077 --> 05:21:25.539
And one of my frustrations was it was a dependent charter with Orchid School District.

05:21:26.319 --> 05:21:32.264
And they had all kinds of stipulations, so a student couldn't start with our school unless they had a 2.0 when they started.

05:21:32.964 --> 05:21:38.228
So they have the best test scores in the county, but when students weren't successful, they were dismissed.

05:21:38.409 --> 05:21:40.390
And so I became frustrated with that.

05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:46.315
And so I came over to Olive Grove, and since being there this year, I just wanted to show a few data points with you.

05:21:47.516 --> 05:21:49.677
We are now four counselors strong.

05:21:49.717 --> 05:21:59.403
Last year we had two and with the two counselors that we had, we had 79% of our students complete the FAFSA and enroll in a community college in the area.

05:22:00.424 --> 05:22:06.248
We established partnerships this year with our local community college and are working on CTE courses for concurrent enrollment.

05:22:07.228 --> 05:22:13.232
The number of students taking community college classes while they're in high school increased by 25% this year.

05:22:13.953 --> 05:22:22.938
And the counselors were able to meet with each student when they come into school and develop a plan for the whole time they're in school that includes their academic and social and emotional support.

05:22:23.699 --> 05:22:34.906
One thing I also wanted to note was that when I asked students how they were referred to us, the majority of the time they're being referred to us by the principal or vice principal or counselor at our local school districts that are denying us.

05:22:35.547 --> 05:22:35.807
Thank you.

05:22:40.247 --> 05:22:40.848
Good afternoon.

05:22:41.469 --> 05:22:49.900
My name is Sherry Kynert and I am a registrar at Olive Grove and information specialist and I've been with them for two years.

05:22:51.162 --> 05:22:54.927
I as well came from the Orchid School District and Orchid Academy High School.

05:22:56.408 --> 05:22:59.729
I worked in the Orkut Union School District for 27 years.

05:23:00.910 --> 05:23:11.335
I was very disillusioned and needed to be re-energized in education, came to Olive Grove and got just that.

05:23:12.155 --> 05:23:26.306
I was fortunate to see the enrollment process as a registrar, to see families come, to see parents literally crying with no options and to be taken in.

05:23:26.826 --> 05:23:36.133
And I was also able to see students that were completely credit deficient come in and after six months,

05:23:37.234 --> 05:23:44.081
Going strong here students that say I Had no place in public education.

05:23:44.101 --> 05:23:58.417
I was lost and I was just told that I'm smart, you know It's an incredible place dedicated extremely professional environment and I have been in education for quite a long time and

05:23:58.978 --> 05:24:10.759
So I feel very blessed and very fortunate to be able to actually see the data, to see the test scores, to be able to print diplomas and participate in graduations.

05:24:11.240 --> 05:24:11.541
Thank you.

05:24:16.425 --> 05:24:17.226
Good afternoon, Borden.

05:24:17.606 --> 05:24:20.409
Ramel Antoine with the California Charter Schools Association.

05:24:20.429 --> 05:24:22.210
I'm just going to keep it really brief.

05:24:22.250 --> 05:24:23.231
Just a couple of things.

05:24:23.972 --> 05:24:25.453
First, the leadership of this school.

05:24:27.135 --> 05:24:30.838
I don't say this often, but this leader, Laura Mudge, is in it for the long haul.

05:24:30.918 --> 05:24:40.166
She's been at this work for a long time and is clearly committed to continuing to retool her process and to bring her team into the process, doing what's best for the kids.

05:24:40.747 --> 05:24:41.808
Ultimately, that's what she's doing.

05:24:43.429 --> 05:24:57.044
You know, she could have just really done the bare minimum and then tried to get that through, but she has gone back to the local district and worked with them through that process and ultimately could not get approved there and is back here before you through a long, arduous process.

05:24:57.084 --> 05:24:59.667
But she is still sticking it out, and that takes grit.

05:24:59.707 --> 05:25:00.548
It takes tenacity.

05:25:01.729 --> 05:25:10.054
What's also important to note is that there are over 700 students who are currently at this school, and these are students who, if they were not at this school, likely would not be at any school.

05:25:10.534 --> 05:25:18.058
And this school is really doing the work of keeping students engaged in the educational system and doing the best that they can while also trying to improve.

05:25:18.719 --> 05:25:26.203
We hear that from the stories of the students that were here today that have spoken, but also from the teachers who have such passion and drive for this work.

05:25:26.644 --> 05:25:29.946
So I urge you, we urge you to consider approval of this school.

05:25:30.166 --> 05:25:30.426
Thank you.

05:25:35.202 --> 05:25:39.685
Good afternoon, Lorraine Richards, California Teachers Association, speaking against the petition.

05:25:40.405 --> 05:25:50.052
In all districts, the petition from this group from a non-classroom based charter was denied by six locals and Santa Barbara County based upon same or similar facts.

05:25:50.472 --> 05:25:58.217
Most significantly, low standards and poor achievement throughout their history have indicated 75% of the students at low performance.

05:25:58.838 --> 05:26:04.682
County referred the petition with unsound and insufficient data to properly implement a successful program.

05:26:05.922 --> 05:26:17.069
Another significant area is financial stability, which was previously addressed as marginal, then resubmitted based on California Department of Education recommendations requests.

05:26:17.729 --> 05:26:21.511
Questionable whether financial capability on their own.

05:26:22.331 --> 05:26:29.615
And lastly, consider this charter has been around since 2002-2003 to make improvements to the application.

05:26:30.036 --> 05:26:33.818
These significant areas mentioned reflect denial.

05:26:33.898 --> 05:26:34.178
Thank you.

05:26:38.675 --> 05:26:44.640
Angela de Ramos, also representing CTA, also speaking against this petition.

05:26:45.001 --> 05:26:57.491
The CDE notes that the Olive Grove Charter needs to address by revision several issues including reclassification criteria, measurable pupil outcome, employee classification, and suspension and expulsion procedures.

05:26:57.912 --> 05:27:00.414
These are not simply technical amendments, however.

05:27:00.794 --> 05:27:05.118
They're significant omissions, making their addition a material change.

05:27:05.799 --> 05:27:17.137
Furthermore the move to belatedly claim as an alternative dashboard school would indicate that the charter at school acknowledges They have not met student academic needs adequately as planned CTA urges the board to deny the petition.

05:27:17.297 --> 05:27:17.578
Thank you

05:27:21.431 --> 05:27:25.933
Good afternoon, Paul Kiefer with Pacific Charter Institute, and I urge you to vote yes on the petition.

05:27:25.953 --> 05:27:32.776
I appreciate CDE and the state board's oversight over the last three years, and I trust that you'll continue to do the good oversight.

05:27:33.016 --> 05:27:37.719
And I know this program, as it grows, obviously is demonstrating that it's meeting the needs of the community.

05:27:37.899 --> 05:27:38.179
Thank you.

05:27:42.728 --> 05:27:44.529
Eric Premack, Charter Schools Development Center.

05:27:44.689 --> 05:27:49.193
We support staff recommendation on this as well as ACCS recommendation.

05:27:49.913 --> 05:28:03.242
We've been working with this group for 17 years, or this school for 17 years since its inception and all of its challenging iterations over time, including helping them through the appeal that you granted a few years back.

05:28:04.363 --> 05:28:11.028
We've been very impressed with their success throughout, but most impressed with the recent leadership team

05:28:12.216 --> 05:28:29.690
They've done a great job financially, operationally, governance, legal, and we strongly suggested that they do interim assessments given the squishiness of the DAS data at this point and are pleased to see that they've done that as well and have strong results to show there.

05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:33.934
We think this one's a slam dunk and urge you to approve all four of them.

05:28:34.074 --> 05:28:34.374
Thank you.

05:28:43.749 --> 05:28:43.949
Hi.

05:28:45.689 --> 05:28:46.590
My name is Jim Burke.

05:28:46.650 --> 05:28:57.572
I'm on the school board for Olive Grove Charter School, which still surprises me, but that's a whole other story, oddly.

05:28:58.972 --> 05:29:11.214
I was 40 years a teacher from the federal government, California state schools, 40 years in the classroom.

05:29:13.911 --> 05:29:30.816
In the last the last five of those years I Was I'm pretty sure I was the first teacher at Olive Grove when the Los Olivos school put it together and I thought I was going to be a tough sell on it, but I

05:29:32.389 --> 05:29:43.378
What that experience gave me was something that I always knew to be true, facing 25 or 30 kids in a classroom, is that I wasn't going to be able to get to very many of them.

05:29:45.020 --> 05:29:46.461
It's just a fact of life.

05:29:46.701 --> 05:29:54.048
With that many kids in a classroom, you have the dominant kids, and you have the kids that aren't quite so much, and I couldn't get them all.

05:29:54.912 --> 05:29:55.833
And that was frustrating.

05:29:56.093 --> 05:29:59.455
Any teacher worth their salt finds that frustrating.

05:29:59.635 --> 05:30:07.921
And I tried putting a mailbox on my desk all bolted and locked up so they could jot notes.

05:30:07.981 --> 05:30:09.783
But that just wasn't personal enough.

05:30:09.803 --> 05:30:15.767
And when I got into the charter school, it just suddenly made sense.

05:30:16.347 --> 05:30:18.849
I could really get down with my kids.

05:30:19.429 --> 05:30:20.470
And they were all ages.

05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:23.192
So it was a wonderful experience.

05:30:28.757 --> 05:30:30.378
Olive Grove is about the individual.

05:30:30.979 --> 05:30:32.400
It's about the individual student.

05:30:32.560 --> 05:30:39.586
And a few weeks ago, I went to the high school graduation.

05:30:41.147 --> 05:30:48.193
And when I saw all those mortarboards flying up in the air, and the kids just so excited, I think it was like 80 of them.

05:30:48.993 --> 05:30:51.475
And the parents and the, am I done?

05:30:53.677 --> 05:30:54.057
Yeah.

05:30:54.137 --> 05:30:55.318
And I'll be done really quick.

05:30:55.378 --> 05:30:58.341
And the parents just hollering and the horns blasting.

05:30:59.284 --> 05:31:03.465
in this gymnasium, and it was just an incredible moment, wonderful moment.

05:31:04.205 --> 05:31:09.367
And I just believe in Olive Grove.

05:31:09.407 --> 05:31:16.289
And I believe in the effort and the difference.

05:31:18.589 --> 05:31:19.029
OK, time.

05:31:19.149 --> 05:31:19.449
Thank you.

05:31:19.469 --> 05:31:26.631
All right, I think the board, before we discuss this, we ought to take a break.

05:31:26.751 --> 05:31:29.012
And so we'll get back a quarter or three.

05:31:43.354 --> 05:31:46.076
Okay, the State Board will reconvene.

05:31:46.136 --> 05:31:49.399
So we're through the public hearing and we've heard the public comment.

05:31:50.539 --> 05:31:54.522
So we're now ready for board member questions.

05:31:56.124 --> 05:31:59.126
And so who wants to start with the questions?

05:32:01.917 --> 05:32:04.140
Well, I think I'd rather have her come later.

05:32:05.101 --> 05:32:05.542
Sue Burr.

05:32:05.722 --> 05:32:17.277
I actually was interested in some of the information I think that Member Sandoval asked about, and I don't know, Lisa, if you have it, but I would like to see the demographics, which I'm pretty sure we haven't seen yet.

05:32:36.423 --> 05:32:39.867
But I do apologize, we made a mistake and left it off of all of the charts.

05:32:40.849 --> 05:32:50.181
So we did do the comparison, but when we pulled Olive Grove total, we didn't pull it by each of the specific resource centers, so we didn't grab the information.

05:32:52.303 --> 05:32:54.907
Let me ask, do you have the demographic information?

05:33:34.560 --> 05:33:37.442
And you're asking about our specific learning centers, right?

05:33:37.462 --> 05:33:39.042
Okay, that's what I thought.

05:33:41.583 --> 05:33:43.864
Yeah, on our student information system, I just have to.

05:33:44.745 --> 05:33:46.185
I have the 17-18.

05:33:46.426 --> 05:33:47.586
But that's for all of them.

05:33:47.806 --> 05:33:51.268
Right, it's not individualized, but it's all of your schools all together.

05:33:51.448 --> 05:33:53.629
So I can at least start with that information.

05:33:56.127 --> 05:33:59.331
So this is the 17-18 information.

05:34:00.152 --> 05:34:06.779
The enrollment, this is from about 521 students, so it's not their 710 that they're currently at.

05:34:07.680 --> 05:34:09.201
But out of those students,

05:34:11.187 --> 05:34:21.554
There are 286 Hispanic or Latino, 196 white students, 16 that are two or more race.

05:34:21.594 --> 05:34:29.440
There are five Filipino, three Asian, four American Indian or Alaska Native, seven African American.

05:34:31.741 --> 05:34:35.404
And that makes up the total of the 521 at that point.

05:34:35.484 --> 05:34:41.247
So it's not the full 700, but that does give you a total of the schools altogether.

05:34:41.548 --> 05:34:42.828
So that's not individual, but.

05:34:42.848 --> 05:34:42.888
OK.

05:34:46.431 --> 05:34:49.213
And if you have the individual, then... Yeah, I'm pulling up right now.

05:34:49.273 --> 05:34:55.157
Once I have the first one up, the others will be easy, because it'll just be a matter of changing the location.

05:34:55.197 --> 05:34:58.599
And if you could also add free and reduced price lunch, special ed.

05:34:58.999 --> 05:35:00.860
I think those are in this report.

05:35:01.160 --> 05:35:01.521
I'll check.

05:35:01.581 --> 05:35:01.881
All right.

05:35:20.239 --> 05:35:23.862
And then a foster youth too, and unhoused youth.

05:35:24.402 --> 05:35:24.682
Yeah.

05:35:24.862 --> 05:35:31.787
And again, some of those numbers like homeless, we have found through our counselors that those numbers are higher.

05:35:32.007 --> 05:35:37.751
And so we'll be inputting those as we get that information in the next school year too as well.

05:35:38.111 --> 05:35:38.391
All right.

05:35:38.531 --> 05:35:40.253
So I have Santa Maria.

05:35:45.407 --> 05:35:48.529
So do you just want by percentages, or what's best?

05:35:48.589 --> 05:35:51.931
And I don't know if there's a way to hook what I'm seeing up so they can view it.

05:35:51.951 --> 05:35:51.991
No?

05:35:52.631 --> 05:35:52.711
OK.

05:35:52.731 --> 05:35:58.975
So Santa Maria, 5.2% American Indian, 0.3% Asian, 0.3% Asian Indian, 3% black or African American, 0.7% declined to state, 3.8% Filipino.

05:36:13.583 --> 05:36:20.005
31.9% Hispanic or Latino and it's just like 0.3% Japanese, 0.3% Laotian, 0.3% Mexican-American.

05:36:20.265 --> 05:36:20.905
Wait, no.

05:36:20.925 --> 05:36:22.046
6.3% Mexican-American.

05:36:22.066 --> 05:36:25.747
Yeah, on here.

05:36:25.767 --> 05:36:27.027
6.3% was a Mexican-American.

05:36:27.087 --> 05:36:27.447
They self-report.

05:36:27.467 --> 05:36:29.628
So 0.7% Middle Eastern, 1% other Asian, 0.7% Samoan, 0.7% unspecified.

05:36:42.739 --> 05:36:43.200
0.3 Vietnamese, 44% white.

05:36:43.260 --> 05:36:44.081
And then 70.1% Hispanic, 29.9% not Hispanic.

05:36:44.101 --> 05:36:44.281
I know.

05:36:44.301 --> 05:36:44.901
Did you have a question?

05:36:44.922 --> 05:36:45.082
Oh, sorry.

05:36:45.102 --> 05:36:45.222
Right.

05:37:05.632 --> 05:37:12.633
Well, when we do our Hispanic and non-Hispanic, that kind of breaks it.

05:37:12.893 --> 05:37:13.033
OK.

05:37:13.273 --> 05:37:14.274
Female, 58.7.

05:37:14.574 --> 05:37:14.954
Male, 41.3.

05:37:16.054 --> 05:37:21.255
And then one thing I did want to state that I didn't state before is 75% of our students are in high school.

05:37:21.495 --> 05:37:25.035
So that's why a lot of our supports are really geared towards high school.

05:37:25.515 --> 05:37:28.016
And then another 15% are junior high.

05:37:28.296 --> 05:37:33.977
So really, students aren't coming to us until they're really to the point where they're having problems at their local school.

05:37:36.678 --> 05:37:46.220
Gifted, 5.6, Title I, 2.1, socioeconomically disadvantaged in Santa Maria, 70.5, special education, 10.8.

05:37:46.260 --> 05:37:52.862
And then our languages in Santa Maria, 13.9%, 1.4 Arabic, 1 mixteco percent, and 11.5% Spanish.

05:38:02.664 --> 05:38:13.947
And then 2.1% students living in hotels, motels, 0.3% licensed children's institution, 5.2% other homeless.

05:38:18.149 --> 05:38:30.312
It says 89.2% permanent housing, but we found a lot of these people are reporting that they have permanent housing when they're living with grandma or someone else that really puts them as a,

05:38:31.226 --> 05:38:36.433
homeless student, 2.4% temporary shelters.

05:38:37.894 --> 05:38:39.697
So that's Santa Maria.

05:38:41.199 --> 05:38:42.701
Okay, so should I go to the next one?

05:38:43.401 --> 05:38:43.602
All right.

05:38:46.065 --> 05:38:47.527
So Lompoc will be next.

05:38:53.922 --> 05:39:03.745
Okay, Lompoc, 8.8% American Indian or Alaska Native, 3.4% Black or African American, 0.7% declined to state, 2% Filipino, 0.7% Hawaiian, 37.4 Hispanic or Latino, 7 Laotian, 6.1 Mexican American, 0.7 Salvadorian, yeah, and

05:39:21.311 --> 05:39:21.911
39.5% white.

05:39:21.931 --> 05:39:22.731
76.9% Hispanic, 23.1% not Hispanic.

05:39:22.751 --> 05:39:24.332
59.9% female, 40.1% male.

05:39:24.392 --> 05:39:24.992
Gifted and talented, 4%.

05:39:25.032 --> 05:39:25.572
Title I, Part C migrant, 2.7.

05:39:25.612 --> 05:39:26.972
Socioeconomically disadvantaged, 74.1.

05:39:27.012 --> 05:39:28.513
And special education, 16.3%.

05:39:49.882 --> 05:39:55.086
And then we only have Spanish 17% ELL at Santa Maria.

05:39:57.428 --> 05:40:00.972
And then again, the homeless reflect the same numbers.

05:40:01.252 --> 05:40:04.595
I could go over them again if you want, but they're pretty much the same.

05:40:09.219 --> 05:40:10.180
Santa Barbara.

05:40:16.365 --> 05:40:23.655
So Santa Barbara, 5.7% American Indian or Alaska Native, 0.5% Argentinian, 1.6% Asian, 3.1% Black or African American, 0.5% declared to state, 0.5% Filipino.

05:40:32.025 --> 05:40:36.646
16.7 Hispanic, 1 Japanese, 6.8 Mexican American, 0.5 Samoan, 0.5 unspecified, 62 white.

05:40:36.666 --> 05:40:38.587
46.4 not Hispanic, 53.6, sorry, 46.4% Hispanic, 53.6 not Hispanic.

05:40:38.607 --> 05:40:38.987
54.7% female, 45.3% male.

05:41:01.720 --> 05:41:10.543
10% gifted, 0.5% Title I migrants, 43.2 socioeconomically disadvantaged, 17.2 special education.

05:41:12.324 --> 05:41:18.126
All 7.8% yells are Spanish.

05:41:18.286 --> 05:41:20.427
7.8, it's a lot less in our Santa Barbara Learning Center.

05:41:21.847 --> 05:41:26.069
And then, which one did I not do, Buellton?

05:41:26.089 --> 05:41:28.250
All right.

05:41:31.570 --> 05:41:35.762
6% American Indian or Alaska Native, 2% declined to state, 8%.

05:41:39.992 --> 05:41:48.215
Hispanic or Latino, 4% Mexican-American, 4% unspecified, 76% white, 24% Hispanic, 76% non-Hispanic, male and female 50-50, 8% gifted and talented, 42% socioeconomically disadvantaged, and 14% special ed.

05:41:48.235 --> 05:41:51.956
6% of the students are Spanish-English language learners at that location.

05:42:09.198 --> 05:42:14.342
So there are differences and they're pretty much reflective of the areas that the students live in.

05:42:14.362 --> 05:42:17.144
Is that it?

05:42:18.064 --> 05:42:18.284
Okay.

05:42:32.615 --> 05:42:38.599
And also I had a question about the absence of some of the schools in those local areas from the data tables.

05:42:40.293 --> 05:42:42.955
if someone could address why they're not included.

05:42:44.376 --> 05:42:52.401
When we have to look at the schools that students would otherwise be required to attend in the local areas, there are some schools that are missing from the tables.

05:42:59.878 --> 05:43:01.820
We do do a random sample.

05:43:02.080 --> 05:43:07.606
So we select five schools within that one to five mile radius of that school.

05:43:08.147 --> 05:43:11.190
And then we do look at the schools where the students would otherwise attend.

05:43:11.671 --> 05:43:16.316
So we don't we may not capture all of the schools but we do try to capture a random sample.

05:43:21.624 --> 05:43:25.667
Yeah, thank you for clarifying that, because that's helpful for me to know.

05:43:25.747 --> 05:43:38.478
But I know that when we already, for example, in the Santa Ynez Valley, the Buellton, looking at that petition, there's an independent charter that's existing that's authorized by district.

05:43:38.598 --> 05:43:40.199
I think it's Walkman District.

05:43:41.180 --> 05:43:47.605
But when that one, a comparable program is absent from the data tables,

05:43:49.987 --> 05:43:54.609
It doesn't give us a complete picture of what options students have in that local area.

05:43:55.149 --> 05:44:05.492
And when we don't have information about other charter schools in that area too, I just feel like there is some very important data missing.

05:44:05.512 --> 05:44:18.917
I think if we're asked to make a decision that's so important, we really have to have a full picture of the context of these different communities where these schools are proposing to be continuing.

05:44:19.597 --> 05:44:19.937
Understood.

05:44:19.977 --> 05:44:22.499
I'll take a better look at that for future items.

05:44:22.979 --> 05:44:28.363
I apologize for that Okay other questions Board member Rucker.

05:44:28.403 --> 05:44:47.455
I think you wanted Okay, so let me begin by saying this was probably and all the time I've been on the board the most frustrating Petition and appeal that I have studied in reading I couldn't decide whether I was reading a plan that was a material revision of

05:44:48.015 --> 05:45:04.390
a plan that had already been approved for a charter that's already a board approved charter, or if this was an appeal for a new charter, or if this was an ongoing running conversation to revisit the Anderson decision.

05:45:04.950 --> 05:45:08.173
The reason I'm saying that this was frustrating is, first of all,

05:45:08.666 --> 05:45:26.341
There was a lot of information that should have been in this charter, particularly as it relates to talking about student services for English learners in particular, since parents are going to be the primary agents of support for those students

05:45:26.841 --> 05:45:34.108
not only on instructional issues, but on support for language development that was never spelled out in the charter.

05:45:34.528 --> 05:45:42.115
And this is not the first charter where I have had issues with what was not included in the charter concerning

05:45:42.635 --> 05:45:48.518
English learners, but this is the petition that was the most spare of information.

05:45:48.878 --> 05:46:01.045
And the reason why I was frustrated is I couldn't understand or decide whether they were simply getting the benefit of being an already existing charter and the staff were relying on information they already knew

05:46:01.585 --> 05:46:14.155
about the operations of the staff in the charter that was not covered in the charter or if the staff simply decided it wasn't required or it was sufficient with the technical recommendations you were making.

05:46:14.635 --> 05:46:17.097
Which goes back to the other reason why I was frustrated.

05:46:17.157 --> 05:46:26.745
Every time I read a charter petition that comes to us on appeal and we have this collection of technical amendments and conditions that you say are non-material,

05:46:27.245 --> 05:46:35.457
Some of them are more material than others and we continue to have this running dispute and debate about what is a material revision and what is not.

05:46:35.817 --> 05:46:42.607
And I don't agree that on some of these conditions that are related to approving this charter that they're not material.

05:46:43.127 --> 05:46:57.632
I don't disagree that the conditions that are being added will improve the petition and will actually address the issues that were connected to why the other districts in the county office would not approve them.

05:46:58.052 --> 05:47:08.396
But because if those amendments are added, if districts had seen that same petition with those added amendments, they probably would have approved it.

05:47:08.736 --> 05:47:13.381
which is what makes me see in my mind that these are material visions.

05:47:13.922 --> 05:47:16.805
But I need to understand as it relates to

05:47:18.311 --> 05:47:31.338
the special education parents, and as it relates to the English learners, I actually heard more in the public testimony about what was going on in the program than I actually read in the charter.

05:47:31.738 --> 05:47:44.825
So I want to, is this level of, I'm asking the department staff because I'm just so surprised at how poorly what was presented to us was actually presented and you still recommended it for approval.

05:47:45.445 --> 05:47:58.212
What actually are you looking for in making these recommendations on this plan that you could approve this and it contains far less information than other plans that we have looked at and approved before.

05:47:58.232 --> 05:48:06.017
So I'm very frustrated because this plan was so poorly developed on areas that are so material to the students they serve.

05:48:06.357 --> 05:48:07.858
This is a charter that's been in place

05:48:08.638 --> 05:48:09.858
for a long time.

05:48:10.319 --> 05:48:36.868
So to me, for them to come to the board and to do this work, even if they weren't coming to us when they submitted this charter for approval at district, it should have been better done based on their experience and the work that they've already been doing for the student population that they so tout that they're so good at, but they don't say anything in this plan about what they're actually doing, particularly for the English learners and the students

05:48:37.248 --> 05:48:39.052
with special education needs.

05:48:39.392 --> 05:48:48.489
It was so poorly done and I'm so frustrated that this is the worst petition I've ever seen turned in and yet we're still being recommended to approve it.

05:48:48.970 --> 05:48:49.832
I don't get it.

05:48:51.941 --> 05:48:52.642
Okay.

05:48:52.882 --> 05:48:58.366
I can tell you that we looked at each petition individually like we do with all the other petitions.

05:48:59.387 --> 05:49:07.233
We did call out what was in the petition that the petitioner stated would cover their EL criteria.

05:49:07.653 --> 05:49:16.860
They did talk specifically about, I'm pulling up their section now, about their methods for English language development.

05:49:17.001 --> 05:49:21.124
They discussed newly approved curriculum that they were going to be offering to the EL students.

05:49:21.704 --> 05:49:25.505
when that curriculum was going to be happening, that they would be working with their students.

05:49:26.386 --> 05:49:31.187
So what we felt was lacking was the information about the EL reclassification.

05:49:31.267 --> 05:49:34.128
We didn't feel like they addressed that in their petition.

05:49:35.209 --> 05:49:38.890
But overall, we did feel that they addressed that piece of the petition.

05:49:39.230 --> 05:49:43.231
But we did look at them specifically as they came in newly this time around.

05:49:44.052 --> 05:49:48.253
We weren't relying on a previous petition they had submitted before the board.

05:49:53.691 --> 05:49:54.472
Board member Strauss.

05:49:56.033 --> 05:50:03.258
So it's my understanding that the reasoning these charter appeals are before us is because of the Shasta decision.

05:50:03.758 --> 05:50:04.719
Am I correct on that?

05:50:05.119 --> 05:50:05.740
That's correct.

05:50:05.900 --> 05:50:09.663
They are still within the current term that they were previously approved by the board.

05:50:09.863 --> 05:50:10.083
Right.

05:50:10.843 --> 05:50:10.963
And

05:50:12.291 --> 05:50:16.394
I mean, I remember hearing about Olive Grove when we heard it in 2015.

05:50:17.034 --> 05:50:23.939
And I just, I think we're clear that they serve a very challenging secondary population.

05:50:25.480 --> 05:50:29.583
One, and I think the testimony from the students was heartfelt.

05:50:30.203 --> 05:50:35.306
And I would just say, I would have taken any one of the teachers that testified to work in my high school in a minute.

05:50:35.447 --> 05:50:38.709
I think these are really committed teachers and leaders.

05:50:39.289 --> 05:50:43.510
who are working to support kids who haven't found the system to work for them.

05:50:44.550 --> 05:50:45.291
And so I thank you.

05:50:46.291 --> 05:50:51.672
Last August, I was very fortunate to spend the day with the Santa Barbara County superintendents.

05:50:52.292 --> 05:51:02.075
And I would say sincerely that there was a lot of discomfort about the Olive Grove program, which we heard today between the challenge of the district and the Olive Grove program.

05:51:02.535 --> 05:51:03.196
And that's too bad.

05:51:03.216 --> 05:51:09.403
I think there's probably a variety of circumstances that have created a lack of positive collaboration.

05:51:10.284 --> 05:51:17.892
But I think we always wish that all the programs that serve a local community could be more collaborative and positive in their work together.

05:51:17.912 --> 05:51:19.234
And I think there's a lot of history.

05:51:19.794 --> 05:51:20.635
that's built on that.

05:51:20.655 --> 05:51:24.978
And I heard that from the districts who sincerely are trying to serve the kids as best they can.

05:51:24.998 --> 05:51:34.844
And I would say as a former high school principal who sincerely tried to serve 3,500 diverse kids, we just didn't connect with every single one as we heard some students today.

05:51:35.985 --> 05:51:48.708
That being said, it's my understanding that they were a collaborative group that had to be broken up into several different charters to meet the Shasta decisions requirement.

05:51:49.108 --> 05:51:51.149
And that's why we're here today.

05:51:51.869 --> 05:51:58.671
And I do appreciate what the attorneys presented as far as the demands and the challenges at the districts in reviewing it.

05:51:59.292 --> 05:52:03.378
I think it's, you hear unanimous lack of support from the district and the county.

05:52:03.579 --> 05:52:04.220
That's what I heard.

05:52:04.520 --> 05:52:08.367
But I hear an amazing heartfelt support for the kids and the program.

05:52:08.527 --> 05:52:10.110
So that's a dilemma for us as well.

05:52:12.198 --> 05:52:29.112
I also heard in the data that the school shared that it's interesting that it's more female than male population, which is interesting, more non-white than white, a poorer population, a higher special ed population than typically is served percentage-wise in the local school.

05:52:29.512 --> 05:52:35.657
These are not the kids that get it the first shot all the time, and we heard that from some students as well.

05:52:36.617 --> 05:52:56.035
Wish if I could fix everything that you'd you'd be a district that was that was working collaboratively and so appreciated the energy and support and I guess that's the dilemma if I Could say going forward that what would be good is because they've been in existence a long time so they have a long time history of not cooperating maybe as well as they could have but I

05:52:56.696 --> 05:53:08.521
If there was a way looking forward, and it isn't just in this situation, but in other charter situations where the animosity builds over time and it's just not as positive a relationship as it could be, I'd like to see it moving forward.

05:53:08.561 --> 05:53:24.149
But I do have to say, this population has special needs and special services that the school's working really hard, and I appreciate the direction to improve English language services, personal counseling services, and things that this population needs to succeed.

05:53:25.649 --> 05:53:27.791
Those are just sort of some highlights of comments.

05:53:27.931 --> 05:53:34.015
And again, these are schools in existence that are coming before us because SHAS required them to come before us at this point.

05:53:35.015 --> 05:53:35.316
Thank you.

05:53:41.497 --> 05:53:44.179
I have a clarification question.

05:53:44.799 --> 05:53:52.183
Is this the same charter proposal that was brought to CDE in 2015 and just replicated and cut up?

05:53:52.203 --> 05:53:58.726
There are new, clean, separate four proposals, but they're the same proposals for all four, correct?

05:54:00.027 --> 05:54:08.693
Okay, and and then my other question is on the the other desk goals in the area Are there other desk goals that these districts who denied?

05:54:08.713 --> 05:54:13.776
that I have available for students Who are at risk to attend?

05:54:14.576 --> 05:54:15.617
I don't know that offhand.

05:54:15.657 --> 05:54:18.759
I can take it take a look and see if there are do you know Laura?

05:54:19.339 --> 05:54:21.681
There should be right.

05:54:21.821 --> 05:54:22.721
Oh That was the chart.

05:54:23.161 --> 05:54:24.122
I didn't say sure.

05:54:24.262 --> 05:54:26.924
Okay, I Think I got the answer.

05:54:26.944 --> 05:54:27.704
It was on the chart.

05:54:27.844 --> 05:54:28.065
Okay.

05:54:28.525 --> 05:54:28.805
Thank you

05:54:30.287 --> 05:54:33.869
Yeah, I'd like to ask, how much of your instruction is online?

05:54:33.929 --> 05:54:36.130
Maybe the school directors could talk about this.

05:54:36.430 --> 05:54:48.076
I wasn't quite clear how much was really online, how much was face-to-face, how you mix together the face-to-face with the online.

05:54:48.977 --> 05:54:50.357
Can you talk a little bit about that?

05:54:55.205 --> 05:54:57.066
Classes that, well, not classes.

05:54:57.126 --> 05:55:02.908
So students can choose a textbook or they can choose online platforms.

05:55:03.268 --> 05:55:07.869
However, our support sessions are face-to-face.

05:55:09.310 --> 05:55:11.831
So it's a blended model.

05:55:12.191 --> 05:55:18.673
We don't have teachers that meet with students much over the internet or anything like that.

05:55:18.793 --> 05:55:23.315
So our instructional piece is live in our learning centers.

05:55:25.023 --> 05:55:30.287
Okay, so there's textbook and there are, you know, there is some instruction on our online courses as well.

05:55:30.708 --> 05:55:33.310
And then we have the additional backup support sessions.

05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:37.073
Right, so it's very different from an online charter.

05:55:37.193 --> 05:55:38.033
It's very different.

05:55:40.375 --> 05:55:43.638
Because most of our supports are in our learning centers.

05:55:44.338 --> 05:55:45.960
Okay, thank you.

05:55:46.060 --> 05:55:47.581
Other board member questions?

05:55:48.682 --> 05:55:49.883
Board member Ortiz-Lacombe.

05:55:51.999 --> 05:55:52.379
Thank you.

05:55:52.399 --> 05:55:56.241
I think there's clearly a need for a school like this.

05:55:56.261 --> 05:56:00.962
There's obviously interest because we've seen the numbers increase.

05:56:01.423 --> 05:56:07.225
But I also think that because we are so far away, we do need to have a complete picture.

05:56:07.245 --> 05:56:09.826
And this is mainly directed to the department.

05:56:10.746 --> 05:56:14.207
You know, board members, you happen to know the area very well.

05:56:14.227 --> 05:56:18.929
I know we've had other schools that have come before us where I know the area very well.

05:56:20.089 --> 05:56:33.075
And one of the things that I've, a comment that I've made in the past is I think it's important for the department to help us see what you're seeing when you're going through all the materials by making sure that we also get the complete picture.

05:56:33.475 --> 05:56:40.959
So in the past we've had proponents that have come up with API to justify their gains or their performance.

05:56:41.679 --> 05:56:44.520
Today we had a charter school that had some limited data.

05:56:44.980 --> 05:56:47.982
What I thought was very interesting was that they had a,

05:56:48.982 --> 05:56:51.244
disproportionate number of Native American students.

05:56:51.284 --> 05:56:56.468
We've never seen so many students serve more than 5% per each of these schools.

05:56:56.868 --> 05:57:05.735
And so for me, that would have been a very interesting data point to see how are Native American students performing compared to other schools in the area.

05:57:05.775 --> 05:57:09.658
You did some comparison, but it was at an aggregate, not by student group.

05:57:10.318 --> 05:57:12.400
You have a large number of Latino students.

05:57:12.460 --> 05:57:16.003
I also thought it was interesting that it was Hispanic, Latino, Mexican American.

05:57:16.543 --> 05:57:19.225
But when we look at our data, that's all one group.

05:57:19.345 --> 05:57:23.367
It's Latino, I prefer Latino over Hispanic, but it's Latino Hispanic.

05:57:24.148 --> 05:57:32.153
And so just having a better and a clean understanding of the data would have been very helpful, including some of the major schools in the community.

05:57:32.653 --> 05:57:34.934
And I really think that that's on us.

05:57:34.994 --> 05:57:45.481
So that's on, well, one, if we authorize it, we are the ones that should be communicating with the other LEAs, but also holding and making sure that that data makes sense to us.

05:57:47.242 --> 05:57:51.164
You know, I used to do the charter, I was a liaison for charter schools when I was at LAUSD.

05:57:51.584 --> 05:57:56.187
And if our proponents didn't have the information, we would make sure they had it before they came before the board.

05:57:56.567 --> 05:58:13.918
And so I think that it's important for that to be like some kind of internal control that happens where you're communicating with proponents, making sure they have a very, a presentation that addresses some of the concerns you heard not only today, but you've heard over and over in terms of what data are they coming forth with,

05:58:14.899 --> 05:58:25.348
Is it a data that provides a complete picture and if they don't then the department can so that we are being very Educated informed when we make our decisions.

05:58:25.949 --> 05:58:35.818
Thank you I just have a question or two for the petitioner.

05:58:35.838 --> 05:58:35.858
I

05:58:48.519 --> 05:58:55.662
So the first one is about the dashboard alternative school status, which I know you're eligible.

05:58:56.862 --> 05:59:14.771
So if 70% are our most vulnerable students, and that's who you're serving, but parents are the primary instructional deliverers, according to the petition, and we've got more than half of the population that you serve to be low income,

05:59:16.403 --> 05:59:17.364
What does that look like?

05:59:17.665 --> 05:59:24.913
How does a working parent, for example, in a low income family deliver instruction to their students?

05:59:26.014 --> 05:59:33.583
So again, 90% of our students are in junior high and high school and we do offer supports

05:59:34.793 --> 05:59:42.989
at our location for students that don't have the, we do have parents who obviously can't support their students and that's why we are there to support them.

05:59:43.390 --> 05:59:46.476
Yes, there are parents who want to be more involved and we really

05:59:47.113 --> 06:00:00.926
feel that in our model there is an increase in their engagement with their students and their students' education because they do come to school and they do see how impactful their support for their students can be.

06:00:01.086 --> 06:00:06.091
And so while not all students have that, we do fill in when that's not available at home.

06:00:07.172 --> 06:00:10.013
And again, to piggyback on that, we are blended models.

06:00:10.173 --> 06:00:14.115
So with each student, we take into consideration the parent involvement.

06:00:14.195 --> 06:00:15.795
Are we able to get a hold of the parents?

06:00:15.855 --> 06:00:17.076
Are they living in a hotel?

06:00:17.576 --> 06:00:20.417
And then we supplement what we need to do to get them on track.

06:00:20.477 --> 06:00:22.098
And you've heard that from our students.

06:00:22.758 --> 06:00:28.083
you've heard it from the teachers as well but we do individually get to know each one of the students.

06:00:28.143 --> 06:00:32.286
Our counselors spend quite a bit of time with each new student and so do our principals.

06:00:32.366 --> 06:00:38.131
They have one-on-one meetings with them and then we create the instruction that they need specifically.

06:00:38.652 --> 06:00:41.714
So if you're living in a hotel room you're not going to have anything.

06:00:41.754 --> 06:00:42.435
We become

06:00:44.389 --> 06:00:47.070
with this incredible staff, we become the surrogate parents.

06:00:47.130 --> 06:00:48.510
And we take on that role for them.

06:00:48.910 --> 06:00:52.971
And it's not something that I think you can take nationally and run with it.

06:00:53.051 --> 06:00:56.431
It's just something that we have a niche that we do really well.

06:00:57.111 --> 06:00:58.792
And that's how we deal with that.

06:00:58.932 --> 06:01:03.053
And when the parents are there, they're honest about what they can do and what they want more support on.

06:01:03.293 --> 06:01:08.574
And so it's a group, collaborative engagement.

06:01:09.194 --> 06:01:09.814
So again.

06:01:10.194 --> 06:01:11.556
We take on what parents can't.

06:01:11.576 --> 06:01:15.960
We found some parents that weren't formerly engaged are now more engaged and taking on more role.

06:01:16.341 --> 06:01:21.126
But I mean, we do say it's the parents, but there are kids too.

06:01:21.346 --> 06:01:25.651
So we take on a huger portion than probably what our petition does state.

06:01:26.931 --> 06:01:27.332
You're right.

06:01:27.672 --> 06:01:40.036
And the other portion when we're talking about EL learners, the one thing that we're able to do with the parents who are involved is when we're having those weekly meetings, the parents are there and we're training the parents.

06:01:40.297 --> 06:01:43.638
So we're teaching the parents how to teach.

06:01:44.338 --> 06:01:46.720
and we're also increasing their capacity as well.

06:01:47.101 --> 06:02:02.976
So it's not, we have a very specific and unique situation where we do have the ability to collaborate very strongly with the parents in that situation and give them the tools that they need to better themselves so that they can better their student or their child.

06:02:03.676 --> 06:02:07.962
But we recognize that after a certain point in a student's education, parents just aren't equipped.

06:02:07.982 --> 06:02:09.844
That's why we have single-subject teachers.

06:02:11.005 --> 06:02:17.213
Every location has a single-subject math, single-subject science, single-subject English to take on.

06:02:18.857 --> 06:02:21.839
you know, the teaching that can't be done by a parent.

06:02:21.899 --> 06:02:22.519
I mean, no parent.

06:02:22.559 --> 06:02:27.041
I mean, I'm really good at math and science, but history is not my strong point.

06:02:27.061 --> 06:02:28.882
I couldn't teach my own child history.

06:02:28.942 --> 06:02:33.264
So that's why we pool in all the supports we have.

06:02:33.945 --> 06:02:34.325
Thank you.

06:02:34.705 --> 06:02:35.886
And then I have a question.

06:02:35.906 --> 06:02:41.429
There are letters in our correspondence file, a date of July 6, where you respond to the specific

06:02:42.749 --> 06:02:43.850
requests for information.

06:02:44.611 --> 06:02:50.957
And the responses are, and I'm paraphrasing, we'll be happy to address it prior to the deadline.

06:02:51.177 --> 06:02:56.301
So most of them were pretty like a one sentence addition.

06:02:57.622 --> 06:03:01.826
And some of them were laws that had happened since we wrote the petition.

06:03:01.866 --> 06:03:04.649
So they weren't even part of the Ed Code at the time.

06:03:04.809 --> 06:03:09.012
So we knew, of course, we're going to add in what wasn't

06:03:09.933 --> 06:03:11.935
Around before the petition was first created.

06:03:11.995 --> 06:03:26.526
So yeah, we're happy to make those additions Okay, and just this is just a comment but in on page 11 petition for the Bulton Center, there's a statement made that And I'll read it

06:03:28.632 --> 06:03:35.641
that the school has a considerable population of Chumash Indians enrolled, but yet there's no information.

06:03:35.981 --> 06:03:45.594
So just a comment is just that when statements or claims are made, as a reader, I appreciate having substantiation to back up the claim.

06:03:46.214 --> 06:03:54.139
And there's just, in that example, I'd love to know what the numbers are of students.

06:03:54.199 --> 06:04:00.743
And I heard percentages and I see projections of percentages, but what does that mean as far as actual students?

06:04:01.443 --> 06:04:04.165
Dealing with small numbers of people.

06:04:04.405 --> 06:04:09.468
So that would be helpful in any future correspondence.

06:04:09.488 --> 06:04:09.848
Thank you.

06:04:12.009 --> 06:04:13.070
I'm taking notes up here.

06:04:13.250 --> 06:04:13.950
That's why I'm so nervous.

06:04:17.712 --> 06:04:18.513
Board Member Rucker.

06:04:20.734 --> 06:04:29.418
Okay, so first of all, as it relates to the work you're doing on developing parents in parental capacity, I need to say I know that that's not something new.

06:04:29.818 --> 06:04:42.225
There was a time when public schools received funding through a Nell Soto grant for teachers to do at-home visits and teach parents things like reading literacy and activities that they could do with their kids at home to

06:04:42.665 --> 06:04:46.026
to do work and help parents become more engaged with their students.

06:04:46.366 --> 06:04:49.568
And so there are a lot of programs that do those things.

06:04:49.968 --> 06:04:54.890
So I'm not saying that I doubt that there's a way to develop that work.

06:04:55.350 --> 06:04:59.491
What I'm saying is, but you didn't spell it out in your petition.

06:04:59.511 --> 06:05:08.615
So I was happy to hear you say just now that you recognize that there's probably some detail that, as has been pointed out by board member Ortiz-Leone,

06:05:09.035 --> 06:05:26.139
We need to have a clearer picture of what you're doing, not just what you've been successful at doing, but in taking on and expanding this program, what it means that's going to be in addition to what you're doing now, what it is you're taking on and what you recognize.

06:05:26.559 --> 06:05:40.463
You're doing not only to develop your capacity to do the work with your students who come to you at your resource centers, but what it means to build out and develop the capacity of the parents who are going to be a critical part of doing this work for students.

06:05:41.064 --> 06:05:42.004
I didn't see that.

06:05:42.564 --> 06:05:43.925
I learned more about you.

06:05:43.945 --> 06:05:51.348
The reason why I didn't ask questions before the public hearing began, before the testimony began, is I wanted to hear what people had to say.

06:05:51.968 --> 06:05:59.952
I learned more about your program and what you were doing from listening to the public testimony than what I actually read in your plan.

06:05:59.972 --> 06:06:04.334
I don't have enough in the plan to understand what you're doing.

06:06:04.794 --> 06:06:11.537
And to quote again from Dr. Richard Elmore, if it's not in the core, if you didn't write it down, it doesn't exist.

06:06:12.827 --> 06:06:13.147
Thank you.

06:06:14.827 --> 06:06:15.768
Board member Williams.

06:06:20.109 --> 06:06:21.669
I just have a question in the process.

06:06:21.929 --> 06:06:28.270
So the six districts that you were petitioning to, what was the process like?

06:06:28.390 --> 06:06:32.111
Was it because so much of this is relational as well as technical.

06:06:32.591 --> 06:06:35.732
So did they work with you or did they only read the petition?

06:06:35.832 --> 06:06:40.093
They invited you to the public hearing and they gave you a report and they made a decision.

06:06:40.393 --> 06:06:42.655
Yes, and I reached out many, many times.

06:06:42.715 --> 06:06:44.736
I mean, I've lived in the community for a long time.

06:06:46.597 --> 06:07:00.026
Previously, I was the Santa Barbara County PTA president, and I'm currently on the state board PTA board, so I engaged with the county many times, with Bill Cerrone previously many times.

06:07:01.427 --> 06:07:09.733
So I have good working relationship in that capacity, but as far as anything to do with charter, it was very just,

06:07:11.013 --> 06:07:13.675
We don't want to talk to, you know, I invited, I've invited them out.

06:07:13.835 --> 06:07:20.299
I invited every district to come meet with us to sit down and see how we're engaging with our students.

06:07:21.420 --> 06:07:26.644
I think one district, Santa Maria did, Santa Maria came and they just kind of walked through.

06:07:26.664 --> 06:07:29.485
They didn't really stay and they left.

06:07:30.046 --> 06:07:38.011
And the special education person really wanted to further engage with our special education team and then

06:07:39.603 --> 06:07:42.206
She was really happy, getting contacts.

06:07:42.386 --> 06:07:44.908
And then I asked our team, have you heard from her?

06:07:45.328 --> 06:07:45.889
Then nothing.

06:07:45.929 --> 06:07:49.072
It was like someone told her, don't bother, is how I felt.

06:07:50.333 --> 06:07:51.113
And I kept reaching out.

06:07:51.153 --> 06:07:51.994
I was very friendly.

06:07:52.014 --> 06:07:54.236
I kept trying to figure out what can we do.

06:07:54.256 --> 06:08:02.003
Because like we've said, we have counselors and principals who are sending students to us.

06:08:02.403 --> 06:08:03.544
And they're their hardest students.

06:08:03.604 --> 06:08:04.045
I get it.

06:08:04.185 --> 06:08:06.066
But if they're sending us their hardest students,

06:08:06.647 --> 06:08:10.349
Do they not want to engage and find out what we're doing with those students?

06:08:10.789 --> 06:08:16.272
And then Santa Barbara's superintendent unannounced walked into the Santa Barbara Resource Center.

06:08:16.732 --> 06:08:18.433
He stayed and talked to Allison.

06:08:18.473 --> 06:08:24.355
She could probably speak more to that, but didn't really observe much.

06:08:24.756 --> 06:08:26.236
And so that was it.

06:08:28.615 --> 06:08:31.297
So they could say they did it, but I didn't feel like they engaged.

06:08:31.397 --> 06:08:35.540
I sent them multiple requests for meetings and engagement.

06:08:36.420 --> 06:08:37.881
And the same with the county.

06:08:37.921 --> 06:08:41.564
I get along really well, like I said, in the PTA capacity with the county superintendent.

06:08:42.124 --> 06:08:45.186
But in the charter capacity, there was just no engagement.

06:08:46.487 --> 06:08:56.053
It was difficult because our students, it was hard on our families and students to read in the newspaper these negative things about their school that they felt so strongly for.

06:08:56.213 --> 06:08:58.335
So it's been a difficult process.

06:09:00.908 --> 06:09:04.832
I feel it mostly for my kids though, because they're the ones that were hurt, you know.

06:09:04.992 --> 06:09:06.213
We can handle it now.

06:09:06.734 --> 06:09:10.377
Yeah, I wonder if any of the district or county people want to comment.

06:09:10.437 --> 06:09:11.638
If not, I understand.

06:09:11.878 --> 06:09:16.363
But, you know, we haven't had enough, any interaction with them.

06:09:18.445 --> 06:09:18.705
Pardon?

06:09:20.669 --> 06:09:22.531
Yeah, county, any comment?

06:09:22.551 --> 06:09:25.573
And these lawyers, these are the first time I'm seeing these lawyers.

06:09:25.613 --> 06:09:31.478
I probably shouldn't say that, but there was a different lawyer that came to the ACCS that's been part of the process for them the whole time.

06:09:31.498 --> 06:09:32.779
This is the first time I'm seeing them.

06:09:33.319 --> 06:09:37.022
And like at the ACCS, there was someone else that we've seen.

06:09:37.162 --> 06:09:38.984
I'm just trying to give the county some time.

06:09:39.164 --> 06:09:39.404
I know.

06:09:39.864 --> 06:09:45.249
I'm going to ask board member Williams, maybe we can get a motion on the floor at least here.

06:09:49.554 --> 06:09:55.098
So I have some thoughts that I'll share having listened to all of this conversation.

06:09:55.198 --> 06:10:05.325
Some of it's a little bit surprising to me because I know that first the ACCS recommended approval and there was only one no.

06:10:05.885 --> 06:10:11.209
The CDE recommends approval and my understanding is that CDE staff

06:10:12.309 --> 06:10:19.212
and state board staff know this charter well because it's a state board charter and has been for three years.

06:10:19.713 --> 06:10:41.103
And they have, my impression is that they have tremendous confidence in the leadership and the importance of the work that this charter does with the students that choose, the students and families that choose to come to this charter for all kinds of reasons of not feeling like they fit in or do well in a regular traditional kind of setting, even a traditional charter setting.

06:10:42.184 --> 06:10:43.586
So they make this choice.

06:10:43.966 --> 06:10:53.460
And as I hear the conversation, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I hear more concerns

06:10:55.282 --> 06:11:18.931
about the lack of what was in the agenda item and in the petition in terms of the detail that some of you wanted, the demographics more clearly spelled out, the instructional model more clearly explained in terms of how much support students get on an on-site location, how they get that.

06:11:18.991 --> 06:11:23.973
There was some, the description of the instructional model where there,

06:11:24.353 --> 06:11:29.857
where 90% of their students are in middle school and high school, that wasn't clear to me either to start with.

06:11:29.937 --> 06:11:31.658
It sounded like it was a, you know, K-12.

06:11:32.439 --> 06:11:39.583
And so that was important information, because obviously that changes how much the parent interaction is needed.

06:11:40.384 --> 06:11:47.689
There were things like that that could have been done better, I think, in the petition and in the CDE agenda item.

06:11:49.456 --> 06:11:50.997
I think maybe they weren't.

06:11:51.878 --> 06:11:53.059
I'm going to speculate here.

06:11:53.079 --> 06:11:57.604
I think maybe they weren't because they were already a state board authorized school.

06:12:01.095 --> 06:12:01.995
Okay, let me finish.

06:12:02.735 --> 06:12:25.581
I think that having them being already a state board authorized school may have, and a high comfort level that I've heard by the staff with the school and the operation, that there may have been a sense of, oh, we already know this school and don't necessarily need to, you know, an unintentional oversight, not something deliberately done.

06:12:26.141 --> 06:12:40.347
And so what I didn't hear in most of the questions is a real concern about the finances, the operations, the governance, or the student academic achievement, or the work that they're doing with students to capture them and move them forward.

06:12:40.808 --> 06:12:43.449
I heard more concerns with why didn't we get this information?

06:12:43.489 --> 06:12:44.910
Why didn't we get this information?

06:12:47.869 --> 06:12:48.889
I didn't put that together.

06:12:49.490 --> 06:13:16.197
I think that the petitioner and the staff heard that we want to make sure that we have all the information that we need to make a decision in a petition, but I didn't hear any concerns about operations, governance, finances, or students that would make me think that we should not go ahead and reauthorize or authorize these schools as new charters under the Shasta rule so that they come into compliance with the Shasta ruling.

06:13:17.117 --> 06:13:20.881
So I'm going to go ahead and make a motion that we authorize these four charters.

06:13:20.901 --> 06:13:23.103
Is there a second?

06:13:28.226 --> 06:13:31.767
Yeah, the motion is moving the CDE recommendation.

06:13:31.807 --> 06:13:32.107
Yes.

06:13:32.527 --> 06:13:32.768
Yes.

06:13:33.808 --> 06:13:51.454
OK, so I just need to say, Board Member Williams, I asked specifically when I made my comments, was the preparation on this item, were there so many gaps because the staff already had a relationship with and knew this charter because it was a board authorized charter?

06:13:52.054 --> 06:13:57.521
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the answer was no, that they looked at this as a new charter.

06:13:57.561 --> 06:14:06.473
They did not consider the things that you just laid out based on their existing relationship with the people who are managing and governing this charter.

06:14:06.974 --> 06:14:07.615
So, no.

06:14:08.075 --> 06:14:13.299
They were not looking at the charter and did their evaluation based on their existing relationship.

06:14:13.339 --> 06:14:16.642
Now, if I misunderstood your answer, please correct me.

06:14:16.722 --> 06:14:32.135
But I thought because I voiced my frustration about what I was looking at based on the fact that I already knew the people submitting the charter were already a charter management organization that had an existing board relationship with.

06:14:32.435 --> 06:14:38.744
And Member Rucker, I may have been getting a piece of cake when you did that, so I apologize if I didn't hear you ask that.

06:14:39.825 --> 06:14:42.829
Okay, let's move on and do we have any discussion on the motion?

06:14:42.969 --> 06:14:44.271
Yes, Board Member Sandoval.

06:14:45.671 --> 06:15:07.029
I still don't I don't have the confidence to support the the motion just I feel like we don't have complete information of the context of each of these Schools, and I also read very carefully the county office analysis, which I thought was very clear factual and thorough

06:15:07.990 --> 06:15:32.991
So I just wanted to state The holes that I feel are present and I don't feel confident that I can support it Because I want to do what's right for for students in these communities and I don't have enough information Based on what was presented today to be able to do that Any other board comments at this point, all right board member Valdez I

06:15:34.306 --> 06:15:50.833
I, too, read the reports and even though there wasn't a relationship, if you will, in terms of let's work together, let's figure this out, staff did diligent work in all six settings to determine whether or not it was viable in all of the different areas.

06:15:51.373 --> 06:15:55.235
And so I, too, feel that I can't support this at this time.

06:15:57.156 --> 06:15:58.176
Board Member Ortiz-Lacon.

06:16:00.007 --> 06:16:01.570
I agree that there are some gaps.

06:16:01.630 --> 06:16:09.941
I think where I'm really conflicted is, to some extent, we should also take some responsibility for the level of information that comes to us.

06:16:10.482 --> 06:16:15.269
And I do like what Santa Barbara County, what they used was very thorough.

06:16:15.749 --> 06:16:20.952
It showed the educational plan, every single section, and why it was sufficient or insufficient.

06:16:21.233 --> 06:16:25.015
And I think that we should take that template so that we can also track it.

06:16:25.155 --> 06:16:31.599
In particular, this charter, since it's authorized by us, so we should have that level of information.

06:16:31.679 --> 06:16:32.300
But I don't

06:16:32.900 --> 06:16:48.796
Know that I want to put the blame on the petitioner for something that we might not have asked him to have Prepared and and so that's where I'm conflicted I don't want to hold them accountable for not giving us a full picture when in fact it was probably our responsibility to have that full picture

06:16:54.096 --> 06:16:56.117
Just a quick comment here in the conversation.

06:16:56.137 --> 06:16:56.958
I mean, I do.

06:16:57.358 --> 06:17:01.420
I, too, am seeing inconsistencies as these are coming to us.

06:17:01.460 --> 06:17:14.047
And I would just really encourage CDE staff maybe to work with liaisons on some consistency in the processes or clarity in processes so that we're clear when we're moving forward.

06:17:14.087 --> 06:17:17.929
We have the information that we need to be able to do the full analysis.

06:17:18.089 --> 06:17:20.411
I agree that, you know, I don't with

06:17:21.011 --> 06:17:23.012
Member Feliz Ortiz Lacone.

06:17:23.052 --> 06:17:49.089
I don't think it's we should be punishing the petitioners For a process that I think we need to probably update a little bit more Okay, so we're ready to vote I think we ought to call the rolls Okay super Jaden gray my cursed hi

06:17:50.484 --> 06:17:51.505
Lisa Ortiz-Lacon?

06:17:51.525 --> 06:17:51.625
Aye.

06:17:53.086 --> 06:17:53.826
Patricia Rucker?

06:17:53.847 --> 06:17:53.887
No.

06:17:55.067 --> 06:17:55.908
Nikki Sandoval?

06:17:57.029 --> 06:17:57.089
No.

06:17:57.109 --> 06:17:57.769
Eileen Strauss?

06:17:57.789 --> 06:17:59.330
No.

06:17:59.350 --> 06:17:59.911
Ting Sung?

06:17:59.931 --> 06:17:59.991
Aye.

06:18:01.652 --> 06:18:02.373
Karen Valdez?

06:18:03.233 --> 06:18:03.313
No.

06:18:03.333 --> 06:18:03.934
Trish Williams?

06:18:05.435 --> 06:18:05.555
Aye.

06:18:05.575 --> 06:18:06.496
The motion passes.

06:18:06.736 --> 06:18:07.917
Okay, the motion passes.

06:18:09.198 --> 06:18:10.619
So the charters are approved.

06:18:14.742 --> 06:18:17.163
So now I'm going to read it.

06:18:17.223 --> 06:18:19.285
We are continuing today's meeting

06:18:19.904 --> 06:18:21.405
until 8.30 a.m.

06:18:21.485 --> 06:18:22.326
tomorrow morning.

06:18:23.026 --> 06:18:26.509
Tomorrow morning, the board will first start with closed session.

06:18:26.769 --> 06:18:37.396
So this is read because we don't want to bring in the audience and have them have to leave, you know, we have closed session.

06:18:37.476 --> 06:18:41.839
So we are continuing today's meeting and we will continue at 8.30 on Thursday.
