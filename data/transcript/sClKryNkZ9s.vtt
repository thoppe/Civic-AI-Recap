Member Sun.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.960
Present.

00:37.960 --> 00:38.960
All members present and accounted for.

00:38.960 --> 00:39.960
Excellent.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.960
I hereby call the jay to present the roll to establish a quorum.

00:40.960 --> 01:09.320
Member Rodriguez, will you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?

01:09.320 --> 01:10.320
Absolutely.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.320
I stand.

01:11.320 --> 01:22.800
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for

01:22.800 --> 01:33.920
which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

01:33.920 --> 01:34.920
Thank you.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.240
We'll now be adjourning into closed session.

01:40.240 --> 01:44.960
Board members, please disconnect from this link and go to the closed session Zoom link.

01:44.960 --> 01:50.200
And during the closed session, the Board will take action or discuss the following cases,

01:50.200 --> 01:56.080
EE versus State and Californians for Equal Rights Foundation versus State.

01:56.080 --> 01:59.200
See you in a moment.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.720
All right.

02:03.720 --> 02:15.480
We are back, and seeing that the Board members are all present, Brooks, will you please call

02:15.480 --> 02:17.920
the roll to establish a quorum?

02:17.920 --> 02:20.920
Member Sun.

02:20.920 --> 02:24.440
So I hear.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.440
Vice President Strauss.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
Here.

02:27.440 --> 02:35.680
Member Rucker.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.120
Member Rodriguez.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.120
Here.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.120
Member Petillo-Brownson.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.040
Here.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.040
Member McQuillan.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.040
Here.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.040
Member Glover-Woods.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.040
Here.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.040
Member Escobedo.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.040
Here.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
President Darling-Hammond.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Here.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
Member Burr.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
Here.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.040
Member Benocca.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
Here.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
Everyone's present.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.040
Terrific.

02:58.040 --> 03:07.040
Item one is our State Board projects and priorities item to take up the annual election of officers

03:07.040 --> 03:08.040
only.

03:08.040 --> 03:12.040
And we will hold an election for office of President, Vice President for 2022.

03:12.040 --> 03:17.040
The bylaws require that the State Superintendent preside over the election of the Vice President

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
for 2022.

03:19.040 --> 03:24.040
The bylaws require that the State Superintendent preside over the election of the President

03:24.040 --> 03:26.040
and other such business as the State Board may direct.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.040
And I will turn the gavel over to State Superintendent Tony Thurmond.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.040
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, members of the Board.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.040
In keeping with Article 4 of the State Board's bylaws, I would like to call for nominations

03:39.040 --> 03:41.040
for the Office of President.

03:41.040 --> 03:48.040
No member may nominate or second the nomination of him or herself.

03:48.040 --> 03:54.040
Six votes are necessary to elect an officer, and each officer elected shall serve for

03:54.040 --> 03:57.040
one year until his or her successor is elected.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.040
I'll open the floor for nominations for the Office of President.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
Are there any nominations?

04:05.040 --> 04:10.040
I would like to nominate Linda Darling-Hammond for the Office of President.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
Second that.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.040
I will second that.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.040
We have a nomination and a second.

04:17.040 --> 04:21.040
We'll now open the phone line for a public comment.

04:21.040 --> 04:33.040
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling 712-432-0075

04:33.040 --> 04:40.040
and entering the access code 651-905.

04:40.040 --> 04:49.040
Again, 712-432-0075, entering the access code 651-905.

04:52.040 --> 04:57.040
I'll ask Mr. Executive Director, is there any public comment at this time?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.040
Just one moment, State Superintendent.

05:00.040 --> 05:03.040
I believe we need to correct the call-in phone number.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
I apologize.

05:05.040 --> 05:09.040
Can we put the slide up, please, with the appropriate phone number?

05:14.040 --> 05:19.040
And we do have usually a slight lag here, so we're just going to give people a couple seconds to see if we have any callers.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
Thank you, sir.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.040
We'll stand by in case anyone calls in for public comment.

05:23.040 --> 05:35.040
It looks like there are currently no people signed up for public comment for this item.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
Thank you.

05:37.040 --> 05:43.040
As there is no public comment, Mr. Executive Director, would you please call the roll?

05:44.040 --> 05:45.040
Member Son.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
Aye.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
Vice President Strauss.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.040
Yes.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
Member Rucker.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.040
Yes, absolutely.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
Member Rodriguez.

06:01.040 --> 06:02.040
Yes.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

06:06.040 --> 06:09.040
Yes, enthusiastically.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.040
Member McQuillan.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.040
Yes.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.040
Member Glover-Woods.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.040
Yes.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Member Escobedo.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
Yes.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
Member Burr.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.040
Aye.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
Member Bonacca.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.040
Aye.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.040
Member Dahlin-Hammond.

06:33.040 --> 06:34.040
Do I vote on this?

06:34.040 --> 06:35.040
Congratulations.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.040
It passes unanimously.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.040
Thank you.

06:43.040 --> 06:53.040
Thank you, Executive Director Allen and board members, and by unanimous vote of the board.

06:53.040 --> 07:00.040
Congratulations, President Dahlin-Hammond, who has been elected to serve as president of the board for 2022.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
It's an honor.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.040
We enthusiastically look forward to serving with you again for another year.

07:05.040 --> 07:10.040
And I'll turn it back to you, President Dahlin-Hammond, for the vice president election.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.040
Thank you so much.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.040
And thanks to all.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.040
I mean, this is in these fractious political times.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.040
It's wonderful to have some common purpose.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.040
And I feel like we have accomplished so much on this board.

07:23.040 --> 07:30.040
And I'm very honored to work with each of you over the coming year to continue that momentum.

07:30.040 --> 07:39.040
And it's now my pleasure to, in keeping with Article 4 of the state board's bylaws, call for nominations for the office of vice president.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.040
No member may nominate or second the nomination for himself or herself.

07:44.040 --> 07:52.040
Six votes are necessary to elect an officer, and each officer elected shall serve for one year or until his or her successor is elected.

07:52.040 --> 07:56.040
And I'll now open the floor for nominations for the office of vice president.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.040
Are there any nominations?

07:58.040 --> 08:04.040
I would like to make a nomination as I end my nine years as vice president.

08:05.040 --> 08:14.040
It is my honor and pleasure to nominate Dr. Cynthia Glover-Woods to serve as the vice president of the state board for 2022.

08:14.040 --> 08:19.040
Thank you. Is there a second for that nomination?

08:19.040 --> 08:22.040
I will second that.

08:22.040 --> 08:26.040
Are there any other nominations?

08:26.040 --> 08:31.040
All right. I think we need to then call for a roll call vote.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.040
I guess that's for any public comments. So do we have a public comment slide that's going up?

08:40.040 --> 08:44.040
It is. One moment.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
We will open the phone line for the public comment queue.

08:47.040 --> 08:57.040
Members of the public wishing to provide comments on this item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code on the slide that is showing now.

08:57.040 --> 09:02.040
And we'll give a little moment of wait time to see if there is any public comment.

09:07.040 --> 09:12.040
President Darlene Hammond, there are currently no, there's currently no one signed up for public comment.

09:12.040 --> 09:17.040
All right, very good. Brooks, can you please call the roll?

09:17.040 --> 09:20.040
Yes. Member Sun.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.040
Yay, aye.

09:22.040 --> 09:24.040
Member Strauss.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.040
Yes.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.040
Member Rucker.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
Yes.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
Member Rodriguez.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.040
Yes.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.040
Yes.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.040
Member McQuillan.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.040
Yes.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.040
Member Glover-Wood.

09:40.040 --> 09:41.040
Yes.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.040
Member Escobedo.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.040
Yes.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.040
President Darlene Hammond.

09:46.040 --> 09:50.040
I like the vote. Yay, aye. I'll take that one.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.040
Member Burr.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.040
Aye.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.040
Member Bonacca.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.040
Aye.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.040
Passes unanimously.

09:58.040 --> 10:06.040
Terrific. It is my pleasure to announce Cynthia Glover-Wood as Vice President for 2022. Congratulations, Cynthia.

10:06.040 --> 10:10.040
And now we're going to move. Yay.

10:10.040 --> 10:14.040
We're going to move to general announcements.

10:14.040 --> 10:21.040
As you know, Governor Newsom released the 2022-23 budget on Monday, referred to as the California blueprint.

10:21.040 --> 10:38.040
Governor Newsom's bold blueprint not only builds on the groundbreaking past investments in California students and schools, but hits yet another historic milestone in funding focused on early learning, literacy for all, pathways to 21st century college and careers, and much more.

10:38.040 --> 10:47.040
Generations of students that come will benefit from this vision, and I'll say more about the exciting details of the budget in my president's report later this morning.

10:47.040 --> 10:52.040
There is one item on the agenda that has an addendum.

10:52.040 --> 11:02.040
Item one, the State Board Screening Committee recommendations for appointments to the Advisory Commission on Special Education and the Instructional Quality Commission.

11:02.040 --> 11:14.040
In terms of the consent calendars, the proposed waiver items are W-1 through W-10, and the proposed regular consent items are items 5 through 10.

11:14.040 --> 11:23.040
Members of the public wishing to call in for public comment should view the live stream of the meeting to know at what point public comment will occur for each item.

11:23.040 --> 11:31.040
Public comment may be provided by dialing the phone number, entering our participant access code, and then following each of the operator's prompts.

11:31.040 --> 11:35.040
Upon dialing in, callers will be added to a caller queue.

11:35.040 --> 11:40.040
The operator will notify callers when it is their turn to provide public comment.

11:40.040 --> 11:48.040
We will also ask callers to please turn down the speaker volume of their computers if they are following the live webcast to avoid an echoing effect.

11:48.040 --> 11:52.040
Public comment will be limited to one minute for each speaker.

11:52.040 --> 12:02.040
Item 13 is the general public comment item during which members of the public may provide comment on matters that are not specifically listed on the Board agenda.

12:02.040 --> 12:17.040
Board members, please mute your microphones when not speaking and keep your cameras on at all times, except during the schedule breaks to ensure that we maintain a quorum throughout today's meeting.

12:17.040 --> 12:27.040
For each item on the agenda, there's an opportunity for you to raise your hand using the Zoom participant window if you'd like to ask a question or make a comment.

12:27.040 --> 12:44.040
We'd like to begin this part of the meeting with the bittersweet opportunity to make farewell tributes to some of our long-standing, historically important Board members.

12:44.040 --> 12:49.040
Member Burr, member Rucker, member Strouss, and member Sun.

12:49.040 --> 13:00.040
And we want to invite some speakers from outside of our team here internally to do so.

13:00.040 --> 13:07.040
And I will start off and then recognize several other folks who are here for this purpose.

13:07.040 --> 13:19.040
We will give an opportunity at the end of the meeting also for Board members each to weigh in and so we'll anticipate some more celebration throughout the day.

13:19.040 --> 13:34.040
I want to recognize that this set of Board members have been really the foundation, they've been instrumental in transforming education in the state of California.

13:34.040 --> 13:38.040
And it is indeed a historic moment as they transition from the Board.

13:38.040 --> 13:49.040
They helped to bring this school system back from the brink of collapse, develop the infrastructure for the local control funding formula and the local control accountability plan.

13:49.040 --> 14:00.040
They redesigned the accountability system so it now focuses on broader measures of educational opportunity as well as educational attainment, looked at in many different ways.

14:00.040 --> 14:07.040
What they have developed led to sweeping changes in the federal law and in the efforts of other states around the country.

14:07.040 --> 14:17.040
It has been the foundation on which we are building the next stage of California's journey to demonstrate what a 21st century education for all can be.

14:17.040 --> 14:27.040
What I'd like to say about each of them myself could fill many hours, but I am charged with keeping us on time during the day, so I will try to be succinct.

14:28.040 --> 14:37.040
Starting with member Burr, Sue, I feel that everything we've been able to do on this Board builds on your vision and your legacy.

14:37.040 --> 14:51.040
Your courage and creativity in developing the work that Governor Brown's administration launched has led to the transformation of California schools so that they offer more equitable and empowering education for all of our students.

14:51.040 --> 14:56.040
You constantly remind us of the history and rationale for our deliberations.

14:56.040 --> 15:11.040
You act with concern and empathy for every part of the education system, from students and educators to school district and county leaders, recognizing that we must all support one another if any of us is to accomplish our goals.

15:11.040 --> 15:21.040
Your thoughtful voice will be missed on the Board, but I hope you will be still available for consultation so we can continue to benefit from your wisdom.

15:21.040 --> 15:27.040
Patricia Rucker, it has been a pleasure and a privilege to serve with you on this Board.

15:27.040 --> 15:39.040
I've appreciated your passion, your eloquence, your deep curriculum knowledge, your sense of humor, and like all of my colleagues, your recipes, among many other things.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.040
You too have been a knowledgeable and faithful historian for us.

15:43.040 --> 15:51.040
You put the issues we confront into perspective, and like the Statue of Liberty, you hold the beacon of equity ever before us.

15:51.040 --> 15:56.040
We will miss your voice at this table and we will reach out often.

15:56.040 --> 16:05.040
Ting, it is a true honor for me to serve with you, first on the Teacher Credential and Commission, and then on the State Board.

16:05.040 --> 16:19.040
Your deep knowledge about education and teaching, your commitment to excellence for schools and educators, your deep concern for all of our kids has truly made a difference, not only in your school, but in the state as a whole.

16:19.040 --> 16:30.040
You never hesitate to ask the hard questions about how we can reach further and do better, and you insist on finding the tools that will help educators to do their difficult jobs.

16:30.040 --> 16:35.040
I have learned so much from you and look forward to continuing to tap your knowledge.

16:35.040 --> 16:46.040
And last, and perhaps shortest, but certainly not least, Member Strauss, Eileen, I have been so lucky and so privileged to work with you.

16:46.040 --> 16:56.040
You have been a spectacular Vice President, so knowledgeable, thoughtful, insightful, and committed to the welfare of all of our children and educators in the state.

16:56.040 --> 17:02.040
You know so much about so many issues. You study and you probe to understand all the angles.

17:02.040 --> 17:09.040
You explain so well how the pieces fit in the grand scheme of the work to build a better system.

17:09.040 --> 17:17.040
You honor the work of the staff here at CDE and State Board and of all the practitioners who are working together in the field.

17:17.040 --> 17:21.040
You delight in every step forward in a way that is truly contagious.

17:21.040 --> 17:27.040
I hesitate to use that word in the current context, but I mean it in the best sense of the word.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.040
And you raise your hand enthusiastically for every task.

17:30.040 --> 17:35.040
So I am quite confident we will find ways to work together in the future.

17:35.040 --> 17:45.040
So I just want to acknowledge all of our members as we invite others to also say a few words.

17:45.040 --> 17:50.040
And we are honored to be joined by Governor Jerry Brown.

17:50.040 --> 17:57.040
It is wonderful to see you, Governor, and please take the mic.

17:57.040 --> 18:04.040
Okay, well thank you. You know I like the mic and I may not give it up, but I will.

18:04.040 --> 18:15.040
Anyway, well I've heard these wonderful words to my appointees Sue Byrd, Pat Rucker, and Ting Sun, and Eileen Strauss.

18:15.040 --> 18:27.040
What a great job. And I know each of these women, some better than others, but they've made a hell of a contribution to a very complex system.

18:27.040 --> 18:38.040
I've learned to appreciate going back as chairman of the charter school that I started in Oakland, the Oakland Military Institute,

18:38.040 --> 18:44.040
that schooling is complex, it's challenging, but so profoundly important.

18:44.040 --> 18:51.040
So the board and its very important work is something that I don't know that Californians really appreciate,

18:51.040 --> 19:01.040
but increasingly I've come to understand it and appreciate it, particularly through my appointees that I've gotten to know over the years.

19:01.040 --> 19:10.040
So more than that, I just want to say congratulations. I don't like to see all this talent just going nowhere.

19:10.040 --> 19:19.040
So I hope that you call upon them and we find new ways to put them to work because these four people have an accumulation of knowledge.

19:19.040 --> 19:26.040
And I have to tell you, as someone who's governor for 16 years, I have a bias toward experience.

19:26.040 --> 19:31.040
When I started, I thought experience was bunk and we didn't need it at all.

19:31.040 --> 19:42.040
Now my theme is there is no substitute for experience and no one has more experience than the four people that you're honoring this morning.

19:42.040 --> 19:54.040
So good luck and happy travels. Please rejoin the official family in some form because we need you and the school system needs you very much.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.040
Awesome. Totally agree.

19:57.040 --> 20:04.040
Thank you, Governor, and thank you for your service at turning this school system in the right direction.

20:04.040 --> 20:10.040
We're going to go to State Superintendent Tony Thurman.

20:10.040 --> 20:13.040
Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Governor Brown.

20:13.040 --> 20:17.040
It's good to see President Kurz, Ms. Karen Staff Walters.

20:17.040 --> 20:26.040
I just want to echo the thanks for the service and incredible service of the board members who we are honoring today.

20:26.040 --> 20:32.040
I would also echo those words that with the incredible knowledge that each of you has and has contributed to,

20:32.040 --> 20:36.040
I know that you will continue to support what we do for California's six million students.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.040
We need you, quite frankly.

20:38.040 --> 20:43.040
We cannot afford to be without your institutional memory and your knowledge, given all that you've done,

20:43.040 --> 20:50.040
whether it's to support the LCFF or to support the history of social science frameworks, the health frameworks,

20:50.040 --> 20:55.040
ethnic studies, even what you've contributed so far in a conversation about the math frameworks.

20:55.040 --> 21:02.040
We don't want to lose what you continue to contribute, and we look forward to your incredible partnership.

21:02.040 --> 21:08.040
Education is a difficult job, and people don't realize how difficult it is, and you all have tackled the toughest issues.

21:08.040 --> 21:13.040
I never thought that the toughest issues we'd experience would be curricular discussions.

21:13.040 --> 21:21.040
They generate an incredible kind of intensity because people have a great deal of care and interest over who tells the perspective

21:21.040 --> 21:28.040
and what perspective is told, and you all have contributed to an incredible legacy of what we do for California students.

21:28.040 --> 21:35.040
Thank you, Suburr, for all your conversations about LCFF, about charter schools and how we create balanced charter school reform.

21:35.040 --> 21:38.040
Thank you for your work and the CCE.

21:38.040 --> 21:46.040
Thank you, Member Son and Rucker, for always talking about equity, the importance of putting equity first and what we do for our students.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.040
We talk about critical thinking.

21:48.040 --> 21:56.040
Board member Rucker, I think you've demonstrated in the questions that you ask in this board meeting that we have to role model critical thinking for our students.

21:56.040 --> 22:05.040
I'm grateful to you for that incredible, incredible contribution that you have made and that I know that you will continue to make.

22:05.040 --> 22:09.040
Board member Strauss, you're the only vice president that I've known on this board.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
It's been an honor to serve with you.

22:11.040 --> 22:18.040
Thank you for continuing to raise important issues, the work that you've done around reading by third grade, your work with CCE,

22:18.040 --> 22:21.040
always asking great questions and supporting the work of our students.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.040
I know that there are many others who want to share and congratulate you.

22:25.040 --> 22:29.040
And so I'm hopeful that what we're just saying is see you later for now.

22:29.040 --> 22:35.040
But looking forward to your service in another iteration, in another form, because California needs you.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.040
But we are a state that is grateful for your incredible service.

22:38.040 --> 22:42.040
Thank you and congratulations.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.040
Thank you.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.040
Former president Mike Kirst.

22:46.040 --> 22:56.040
And before I hand you the mic, I just need to say that I did not have the opportunity to say anything when you left the board because we passed like ships in the night, so to speak.

22:56.040 --> 23:12.040
So I want to take this opportunity also to just say all of the amazing work that was done in that period of time, which we build on every day is a product of your thinking, your efforts, your hard work over those times.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.040
And we should be acknowledging you, too.

23:14.040 --> 23:19.040
So I'm thrilled that you're here to speak to all of your colleagues.

23:19.040 --> 23:22.040
Well, it's an honor and a privilege to make some comments.

23:22.040 --> 23:30.040
I thought I'd make some vignettes about each of these members from the past, starting alphabetically.

23:30.040 --> 23:40.040
Sue Burr, I don't know anybody that was better prepared for the state board than Sue Burr, who worked many, many years in the legislature with crucial legislation.

23:40.040 --> 23:51.040
She was deputy secretary of education under Governor Davis, and she was head of the staff of the county superintendents.

23:51.040 --> 24:08.040
I think one of the biggest things about Sue is that she was our first really executive director, and the major change that has made the board more effective is when Governor Brown moved the state board into his office.

24:08.040 --> 24:14.040
I think people don't understand how important it is for the board to be in the office.

24:14.040 --> 24:21.040
And Sue was the first executive director and special advisor to the governor in that role.

24:21.040 --> 24:26.040
And then Governor Brown appointed her to the board in that regard.

24:26.040 --> 24:32.040
So a vignette on Sue reads the agendas and incredible.

24:32.040 --> 24:43.040
I mean, she would point out something in the third paragraph of page 38 of a 50 page document about what is wrong or an issue with that.

24:43.040 --> 24:48.040
And that's really so tenacious in terms of her work.

24:49.040 --> 24:59.040
And she chaired the steering screening committee for many years, hours and hours, picking our advisory council members.

24:59.040 --> 25:09.040
And she was the chair of the California Commission on Educational Excellence and led that through its crucial formative years.

25:09.040 --> 25:21.040
So that moving from the executive job for the board to the board membership really supercharged, I think her contributions.

25:21.040 --> 25:28.040
Patricia Rucker, she brought the classroom teacher experience.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.040
She talked from that.

25:30.040 --> 25:40.040
We really needed that in terms of her grasp of what was the realities of what our programs were doing to teachers and classrooms.

25:40.040 --> 25:49.040
She also taught mathematics and was crucial in thinking about mathematics and forming the board, working on.

25:49.040 --> 25:52.040
She worked on all the frameworks.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.040
And this is really important and detailed work.

25:57.040 --> 26:04.040
One thing about Pat, Patricia, that I would always remember is her interrogation of witnesses.

26:04.040 --> 26:07.040
She was an excellent interrogator.

26:07.040 --> 26:14.040
She would start off with a bunch of questions and I'd sort of sit there and say, where is she going with this?

26:14.040 --> 26:21.040
And then she'd hone in tighter and tighter and finally unearth and bring out a significant issue.

26:21.040 --> 26:29.040
So she was perhaps our one really good interrogator and got to the bottom of things.

26:29.040 --> 26:36.040
Eileen Strauss brought to the board her background in curriculum and instruction.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
We really needed that.

26:38.040 --> 26:43.040
She had been head of educational services or head of curriculum for school districts.

26:44.040 --> 26:51.040
And she understood how that worked and how to translate it in the local level.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.040
She was our liaison to the California Teacher Commission.

26:56.040 --> 27:02.040
She brought the perspective, I would really stress this, of Southern California to the board.

27:02.040 --> 27:07.040
She was deeply involved in L.A. area education.

27:07.040 --> 27:12.040
And we really needed that perspective from that part of the state.

27:12.040 --> 27:17.040
And lastly, she understood the need for capacity building of educators.

27:17.040 --> 27:20.040
You can't get anything done without strong educators.

27:20.040 --> 27:33.040
And Ting Sun, a credit to Stanford as our program there, she brought the incredible experience of running a school.

27:33.040 --> 27:39.040
So to have a board member who's running a single school, seeing how that works,

27:39.040 --> 27:44.040
working with a charter context, helping us understand that context.

27:44.040 --> 27:51.040
So her insights were really tremendously valuable to the board.

27:51.040 --> 27:57.040
She had a big background as well, worked for the California Department of Education.

27:57.040 --> 28:04.040
So we had so much different experience from all these people from outside that they brought in.

28:04.040 --> 28:10.040
And lastly, I'll say all of us had a terrific camaraderie.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.040
We just enjoyed each other.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.040
It was a lot of fun.

28:14.040 --> 28:21.040
And I'll always treasure my experience with these four members.

28:21.040 --> 28:28.040
What a wonderful vision of the sort of way in which this board has added up.

28:28.040 --> 28:34.040
And it is really true that a board is a distributed set of capacities, right?

28:34.040 --> 28:38.040
And we see that in this group and in the group we now have.

28:38.040 --> 28:44.040
And I'm thrilled to see Karen Staff Walters, who is back here also to say a few words.

28:44.040 --> 28:49.040
Our former executive director, now over at Successive Karen, welcome.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.040
And please take the mic.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.040
Thank you.

28:52.040 --> 29:00.040
Well, you know, listening to Mike talk about the background of the four of you makes me realize, wow, really quite extraordinary.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.040
And you're right, Mike, we had a great camaraderie.

29:03.040 --> 29:11.040
And I know that continues on the board even today, despite the fact that you have to do these virtual meetings for who knows how much longer.

29:11.040 --> 29:14.040
We had the pleasure of spending most of our time together.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.040
And I think that helped build that camaraderie.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.040
But all of you brought in a really unique perspective.

29:20.040 --> 29:30.040
And as I was reflecting on it, Patricia, I realized that you and I have known each other for a very long time in different roles as advocates and lobbyists.

29:30.040 --> 29:36.040
And then you were on the board and I was here at the state board as executive director.

29:36.040 --> 29:41.040
So your dedication to this work has been extraordinary.

29:41.040 --> 29:48.040
Aline, I knew of you in my previous world at ACSA, but then I got to work with you directly.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.040
And I would agree with Tony.

29:50.040 --> 29:54.040
You're the only, you know, vice president I ever worked with.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.040
And so thank you for that.

29:55.040 --> 30:02.040
And your great knowledge about secondary schools was invaluable to us in keeping us on track.

30:02.040 --> 30:09.040
And Ting, I remember the time you and I went to lunch when I had to convince you

30:09.040 --> 30:13.040
that this was going to be a great opportunity for you to serve.

30:13.040 --> 30:15.040
And you were pretty darn skeptical.

30:15.040 --> 30:23.040
I will say that at that particular moment, my powers of persuasion obviously were quite good because you said yes and you've been there ever since.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.040
So thank you for that.

30:25.040 --> 30:38.040
And Sue, I would never have been in this executive director position and worked with all this incredible talent if it hadn't been for several phone calls from Sue Bird trying to convince me that I should say yes to this opportunity.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.040
So thank you, Sue, for your persistence.

30:40.040 --> 30:44.040
And I feel like I follow you around, Sue, in maybe different orders.

30:44.040 --> 30:48.040
But I was at the State Board and now I'm at SESSA in your previous role.

30:48.040 --> 30:55.040
So thank you for having that kind of confidence in me because you were an amazing mentor and role model for me.

30:55.040 --> 31:02.040
And Mike, while you're on the phone, it was an extraordinary pleasure working with you and Linda the same.

31:03.040 --> 31:10.040
I can't imagine having had two different presidents of the Board of the caliber of the two of you and the knowledge and experience you bring.

31:10.040 --> 31:14.040
And Governor Brown, thank you for your confidence in me.

31:14.040 --> 31:24.040
After having that great working relationship, I knew you had the Sue and then taking me on as a stranger and saying, well, if Sue thinks you're good, you must be good.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.040
That was an extraordinary leap that you made.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.040
So thank you for that.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.040
And congratulations to all of you.

31:30.040 --> 31:32.040
Your service has been extraordinary.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.040
Oh, my.

31:34.040 --> 31:38.040
Thank you for all being here.

31:38.040 --> 31:46.040
I'm going to read some recognitions from members of the legislature for each of you.

31:46.040 --> 31:59.040
And then because our initial speakers have been succinct and I intend to continue that thread, I will open it up to board members now and we can continue to honor our guests.

31:59.040 --> 32:04.040
I think we have time for that before we have to move to the next item.

32:04.040 --> 32:11.040
And it's appropriate that we all have this opportunity in the morning room where we can in recognition of their service.

32:11.040 --> 32:15.040
The legislature honored each of the outgoing board members with a legislative resolution.

32:16.040 --> 32:30.040
The resolutions importantly notes that during their decade of service, the state board ushered in a sweeping overhaul of what students learn, how their learning is assessed and how schools and districts are evaluated and supported.

32:30.040 --> 32:46.040
The board approved new learning standards, new curriculum frameworks and instructional materials, new online state assessments and a new multiple measures school dashboard that shines a light on inequities and helps communities track school progress.

32:46.040 --> 33:00.040
The resolution for member Burr from Senator Pan honored her work on the adoption of implementing regulations for the online California school dashboard and the template for the local control and accountability plan.

33:00.040 --> 33:09.040
Noting that these tools have strengthened transparency and empowered communities to invest in people and programs that improve student outcomes.

33:09.040 --> 33:19.040
For member Rucker, the resolution from Assemblymember O'Donnell honors her efforts on the adoption of the history social science curriculum framework in 2016.

33:19.040 --> 33:41.040
This framework set out guidelines for K-12 schools to implement content standards for history and social science instruction that included the contributions of the LGBTQ community, a first for California, and to find the reasoning skills of history that students of history should learn to become curious and knowledgeable scholars.

33:41.040 --> 34:03.040
The resolution from Senator Allen honoring member Strauss notes her significant contributions to support the adoption of the ethnic studies model curriculum that will assist local high schools in developing local ethnic studies courses, classes that researchers say can improve at graduation and college growing rates among all students and especially teens of color.

34:03.040 --> 34:20.040
And member Sun is honored by Assemblymember McCarty for her decades of service in educational policy as a teacher, administrator, and charter school operator, including efforts to develop and support policies and initiatives to improve the quality of learning.

34:20.040 --> 34:41.040
So we want to thank Assemblymembers O'Donnell and McCarty and Senators Allen and Pan and their staffs for helping us recognize the significant contributions that member Burr, Rucker, Strauss, and Sun have made during their lifetime of service, which will continue, including their service to the state board, to the schools and students of California.

34:41.040 --> 34:48.040
I want to add a plus one to Governor Jerry Brown's comments about the value of experience.

34:48.040 --> 35:10.040
I think that what we have been able to accomplish in the last decade or more is really a function of that experience joined with commitment and we will continue to tap yours and hope that you will say yes as we continue that process of learning together and moving the state forward.

35:10.040 --> 35:15.040
At this point, we actually have time for me to open it up to other board members.

35:15.040 --> 35:22.040
I'm thrilled that we can hear from others who would like to make their comments at this point.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.040
And who will start us off?

35:24.040 --> 35:31.040
See, member Rucker would usually be the first person whose hand goes up.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.040
This is a turning of the table.

35:34.040 --> 35:40.040
Member Escovedo, let's start with you and then member Rodriguez.

35:40.040 --> 36:03.040
Well, I think I'm the newest member of this board and I just feel like taking language from the community schools at the four pillars of the State Board of Education are leaving us and I'm just so impressed with hearing what you've done historically in this position.

36:03.040 --> 36:10.040
And, you know, my only regret I didn't get to meet you personally, but I look forward to hopefully in the future to do so.

36:10.040 --> 36:29.040
And I just hope I can continue building upon your legacy and hopefully looking forward to again connecting with you and helping me continue the path that you set forth for this great state of California.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.040
Thank you.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.040
Awesome member Rodriguez.

36:33.040 --> 36:36.040
Thank you. That was beautiful. The four pillars.

36:36.040 --> 36:49.040
Member Escovedo, I just want to say thank you so much as a teacher, a teacher who works with students who has also worked for equity, the work that you have done.

36:49.040 --> 36:58.040
And especially the LCFF that I have benefited from, my students have benefited from and the community and that includes you, Professor Kirst.

36:58.040 --> 37:12.040
I just want to say thank you so much for all of that. And as a historian, I am so saddened that you'll be leaving and saddened from the bottom of my heart because I love your historical memory.

37:13.040 --> 37:24.040
You know, when you, the four of you, when you open your mouth to say something, I feel like, yeah, this is taking us back to, you know, this pillar or that.

37:24.040 --> 37:32.040
So thank you so much. And it is with a heavy heart that I say goodbye. Thank you.

37:32.040 --> 37:37.040
Thanks. Member Patio Bronson and then member Bonanca.

37:37.040 --> 37:57.040
I'll add to the chorus of thank yous for the many years of service and having watched so many of you as an advocate previously, always having been in awe of both the courage and the tenacity that you all brought to building a system that really didn't exist elsewhere.

37:57.040 --> 38:21.040
I remember going to Washington earlier in your tenure and talking to other education advocates and being really just very proud to be a Californian for the creation of a California way that looked different than so many other places and was not really shrinking from

38:21.040 --> 38:32.040
a spirit of innovation that put equity at the center and that launched LCFF and the LCAP process in a way that was very uniquely Californian.

38:32.040 --> 38:47.040
So I think for so many of us thinking about building on your foundation in these next couple of years, we thank you again for your service and are excited to think about what the next phase holds.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.040
Great. Member Bonanca and then member Glover Woods.

38:50.040 --> 39:10.040
Thank you. Well, although I only could serve the past six months with you all, you all have been just the most amazing role models and have taught me so much about what it means to be pragmatic, what it means to be an advocate, and what it means to be a board member.

39:10.040 --> 39:17.040
Your passion is always palpable and you all never fail to stand up for what you believe in.

39:17.040 --> 39:27.040
I know that all of the students of California have so, so, so much to thank you all for and it was truly such an honor to serve with you all.

39:27.040 --> 39:30.040
Member Glover Woods.

39:30.040 --> 39:51.040
I also with a heavy heart and just hate to see the four of you go I can remember watching you when I was a practitioner in the field, even having the opportunity to speak in front of you at public hearings and there's always being an admiration for the conversations that took place at the table.

39:51.040 --> 40:06.040
The inquiries and various thoughts that went into a lot of the policies and practices that we now work with and when I had the opportunity to actually sit on zoom side by side with you.

40:06.040 --> 40:10.040
It was just, it was just almost.

40:10.040 --> 40:20.040
I'm without words it was definitely a dream come true and I'll say Sue I always think of you as the quiet storm.

40:20.040 --> 40:35.040
When you speak, everything you say resonates so strongly. And I appreciate the thoughtfulness that you brought to this work over the years and the questions you continue to ask to make us connect and probe deeper.

40:35.040 --> 40:54.040
Thank you, Patricia. Just, again, loving the comments that you make, and I have to say on a personal level, thank you for all of the delicious recipes I'd like to blame the extra five to seven pounds I've gained on you, but just appreciate having the opportunity to work with you and

40:54.040 --> 41:14.040
Ting and Eileen our time together on the screening committee will forever be etched in my heart and I just thank you for being great mentors and thank you to all of you for leading the way and hope to continue your legacy as we continue serving the students of California.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.040
Thank you so much. I remember McQuillen.

41:17.040 --> 41:26.040
Yes, I just want to say ditto to what's been said so far and thank all of you for your services.

41:26.040 --> 41:30.040
I've learned so much in my short time on the board from all of you.

41:30.040 --> 41:39.040
And you're leaving us with a challenge to try to fill your shoes and continue the efforts here.

41:39.040 --> 41:48.040
The Yurok people would say walk thou, walk thou, a heartfelt thank you for your work and your service.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.040
Thank you.

41:50.040 --> 42:10.040
And there's more to come at the end of the day we wish we were having a big party in Sacramento at one of the hotels and you're really fitting you and I hope that maybe a crown will recede enough for us to do that at some point, but we will return to some additional goodies

42:10.040 --> 42:14.040
and some public comments at the end of the day. We appreciate you so much.

42:14.040 --> 42:26.040
Thank you Governor Brown, President Kirst, Executive Director Walters and State Superintendent for your participation and comments as well.

42:26.040 --> 42:29.040
We're all the Clint.

42:29.040 --> 42:41.040
If any of you would like to make a comment, please feel free and then we'll move on to our items.

42:41.040 --> 42:44.040
Oh, Member Burr.

42:44.040 --> 42:58.040
Well, I don't really know what your plans are for later, but I did at least want to express my gratitude for all of the guests here, especially Governor Brown and President Kirst and Executive Director Walters.

42:58.040 --> 43:02.040
It's just been an amazing opportunity.

43:02.040 --> 43:11.040
And I'll say more at the end of the day, but I did want to be able to express my thanks and gratitude for those guests who joined us.

43:11.040 --> 43:15.040
Thank you.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Any other?

43:17.040 --> 43:19.040
Give a moment.

43:19.040 --> 43:24.040
Ah, Member Rucker and then Member Strauss and then Member Sun.

43:24.040 --> 43:31.040
You know, first of all, I want to thank everyone on the board for your very generous and kind thoughts.

43:31.040 --> 43:39.040
And I especially would like to thank Governor Brown for considering me and making this appointment, taking a risk on somebody who

43:39.040 --> 43:45.040
basically just is a very strong advocate and has very passionate views about education.

43:45.040 --> 43:56.040
When I first met him and I was introduced to him, I just said, I'm just a little colored girl from Warren County, Mississippi, the daughter of an Air Force Sergeant.

43:56.040 --> 44:06.040
But in those two sentences, it says a lot not only about my background, but the reasons and the shoulders that I stood on to sit in this room and to sit on this panel.

44:06.040 --> 44:12.040
If anyone had ever told me I would be doing this work before now, I'd say, oh, you got jokes.

44:12.040 --> 44:18.040
But I'm so grateful for the opportunity to for the smart people I had a chance to work with.

44:18.040 --> 44:22.040
I'm so grateful for the mentoring and the opportunity to work with Dr.

44:22.040 --> 44:28.040
Michael Curse and to sit and talk with him about the possibilities of serving with him on the board.

44:28.040 --> 44:36.040
I'm so grateful to get to know Karen Staff Walters better and to deepen our relationship and our working time together.

44:36.040 --> 44:39.040
I'm so glad I had a chance to work more with Linda Darling-Hammond.

44:39.040 --> 44:44.040
We work together a lot on projects at the California Teachers Association.

44:44.040 --> 44:47.040
So I'm so glad we had a chance to do this.

44:47.040 --> 44:55.040
And I'm very grateful for the two superintendents I had the chance to work with, both Tony Thurman as well as Tom Torlakson.

44:55.040 --> 45:00.040
That's the relationship that I hope will continue to deepen and move forward.

45:00.040 --> 45:10.040
But again, I have to return to the appreciation I have not only for Governor Brown, but also for Governor Newsom, who agreed for that reappointment to that third term,

45:10.040 --> 45:16.040
because this has been a wonderful opportunity to do the work we've done and to make the accomplishments we've made.

45:16.040 --> 45:28.040
I have admired this governor for a very, very long time and the opportunity to be counted as one in his circle of advisors and policy folks.

45:28.040 --> 45:34.040
I am so grateful to be counted in that number and to just simply be remembered for the work that we've done.

45:34.040 --> 45:36.040
So thank you so very much.

45:36.040 --> 45:43.040
And I'm so deeply honored and humbled by the opportunity that was given to me and for the work that I was allowed to do.

45:43.040 --> 45:46.040
So just thank you, thank you, thank you.

45:46.040 --> 45:50.040
Members done.

45:50.040 --> 45:56.040
Yeah, so I'm a little overwhelmed with all the folks and with all of the comments.

45:56.040 --> 45:58.040
Thank you so much.

45:58.040 --> 46:08.040
I, you know, I harken on a lot of the comments that President Mike Hurst said about the collegiality.

46:08.040 --> 46:11.040
That is what I will always remember.

46:11.040 --> 46:17.040
I know that, you know, one can be kind of cynical about policy boards and how much they can accomplish and do.

46:17.040 --> 46:25.040
I think in the time that I have served with all of the wonderful board members past and current,

46:25.040 --> 46:33.040
we've had some wonderful discussions and the critical thinking part that was mentioned, I think, by Superintendent Thurmond.

46:33.040 --> 46:36.040
That is what we have brought in.

46:36.040 --> 46:40.040
And I remember specifically a long discussion.

46:40.040 --> 46:47.040
I don't even remember the topic, but at the end of which President Hurst sat back in his chair and he says,

46:47.040 --> 46:56.040
I'm really proud of us because we had such a deep conversation and it brought up all of our perspectives.

46:56.040 --> 47:01.040
We sometimes did not agree.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.040
Right, Patricia?

47:03.040 --> 47:12.040
However, I think we all have a very, very deep respect for each other and appreciation for the different perspectives that we have brought.

47:12.040 --> 47:20.040
And it makes our policy, it makes our work in California for our students much richer and better.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.040
So thank you all and thank you.

47:23.040 --> 47:28.040
I'm so glad that Karen persuaded me to serve on the board.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.040
It has been an absolute honor.

47:30.040 --> 47:33.040
And thank you again all.

47:33.040 --> 47:40.040
Oh, and the last thing is I do want to also recognize the Department of Education staff, past and present,

47:40.040 --> 47:44.040
who have supported the work of the State Board of Education.

47:44.040 --> 47:57.040
I've also met some wonderful, smart, smart people through the department and in their work that has enhanced and brought our policies to fruition.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.040
Thank you.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.040
And Member Strauss.

48:01.040 --> 48:11.040
So I have to say, 11 years is an amazing opportunity and a chapter, such a significant chapter in my educational leadership career.

48:11.040 --> 48:17.040
And I just have to thank first Governor Brown for the three appointments, for the opportunity to serve.

48:17.040 --> 48:21.040
And Michael Kirst, who I didn't know before I joined the board.

48:21.040 --> 48:24.040
And we got to be great partners and collaborators.

48:24.040 --> 48:30.040
I've gotten so much to appreciate his thought and his perspectives on things.

48:30.040 --> 48:36.040
And then Governor Newsom's fourth appointment and working with Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond.

48:36.040 --> 48:41.040
It's been an amazing opportunity to inform policy to practice.

48:41.040 --> 48:47.040
And I would say when Mike was leaving the board, he said, look, we changed just about everything,

48:47.040 --> 48:59.040
like standards and frameworks and curriculum materials and assessment and accountability and systems of support, like everything.

49:00.040 --> 49:03.040
And when Mike said to me, so what else do we have to do?

49:03.040 --> 49:06.040
And I said, now we have to implement all of that work.

49:06.040 --> 49:10.040
And that's what Linda has done and continues to do.

49:10.040 --> 49:18.040
And along with Governor Brown and Governor Newsom's budgets, they continue to support the building of capacity of teachers and leaders.

49:18.040 --> 49:28.040
And I just so appreciate the honor to be the voice of theory to practice and to gain a whole group of friends and colleagues.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.040
So Mike said that I brought in the Southern California perspective.

49:31.040 --> 49:36.040
But now, like we have friends all over the state and truly we can consider ourselves.

49:36.040 --> 49:40.040
And I know, Cynthia, we haven't met in person, but I'm driving out to Riverside really.

49:40.040 --> 49:48.040
But we are going to have a reunion in person because after 11 years, I think we all feel like we can't end just on Zoom.

49:48.040 --> 49:53.040
And when it's safe, we want to really hug and raise a glass and really toast the work.

49:53.040 --> 50:14.040
But I feel so fortunate to have made to work with colleagues in the state board staff, CD staff, all of our partner organizations and advocacy groups who sat with us to inform the science standards and the science framework and ELA, ELD, and all of our frameworks and rollouts and capacity building.

50:14.040 --> 50:15.040
It takes a village.

50:15.040 --> 50:18.040
And this community has worked together.

50:18.040 --> 50:31.040
And under Mike and Jerry Brown's leadership, they really did bring all the groups together around a common purpose of rethinking our funding and our capacity and our vision going forward.

50:31.040 --> 50:33.040
And I feel so honored.

50:33.040 --> 50:37.040
And I know this is only one chapter and I know we'll have some time at the end of the meeting.

50:37.040 --> 50:46.040
But I think to have brought all the forces together to make a difference over the last 11 years is a huge, significant time.

50:46.040 --> 50:52.040
And I know under Linda Darling-Hammond's leadership and the board members going forward, this work will continue.

50:52.040 --> 50:59.040
I'm excited as I look at funding that will now continue to support all the work we have held so close to us.

51:00.040 --> 51:05.040
But for our kids, for our grandkids going forward, I feel like we are laying such an important foundation.

51:05.040 --> 51:13.040
And I count you all as friends and colleagues and know that our paths will continue to cross because we know another chapter is coming.

51:13.040 --> 51:27.040
And I just want to thank you again for the opportunity and for the friendship and for all the wonderful, thoughtful work in the hearings and all the preparation and the influence we'll have for the next generation of students in California.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.040
So thank you.

51:29.040 --> 51:35.040
Thank you. And thanks for mentioning the grandchildren that you and I share our concerns for.

51:35.040 --> 51:41.040
So with that, we're going to acknowledge these wonderful board members.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.040
Thank our guests for joining us.

51:43.040 --> 51:49.040
We really appreciate you taking time this morning and we'll move on with the agenda.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.040
Thank you.

51:55.040 --> 52:01.040
I'm going to now turn it over to State Superintendent Tony Thurman for his report.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.040
Tony.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.040
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

52:04.040 --> 52:10.040
Thank you again, board members and to all the guests who came to acknowledge our outgoing board members.

52:10.040 --> 52:12.040
And we look forward to, again, your service.

52:12.040 --> 52:15.040
And of course, we're grateful to our current board.

52:15.040 --> 52:17.040
And we're looking forward to what is a new year.

52:17.040 --> 52:23.040
As this is the first time many of us are seeing each other, let me also wish you a happy new year.

52:23.040 --> 52:30.040
It's a time for new beginnings, even though we continue to deal with the challenges that the coronavirus pandemic has provided us.

52:30.040 --> 52:36.040
While it's been a difficult start to a new year for many of our schools, our schools in California are in fact open.

52:36.040 --> 52:50.040
They recognize the importance of providing in-person instruction to our students and offsetting some of the social, emotional, and academic difficulties that many of our students experience during a time when we had no choice but to be in remote learning.

52:50.040 --> 52:57.040
Our schools continue to do what I call working to overcome nearly impossible obstacles.

52:57.040 --> 53:10.040
But they're doing it in spite of challenges like against the backdrop of Omicron, against resources like COVID tests and PPE, and of course against the backdrop of staff shortages.

53:10.040 --> 53:17.040
Again, we have to commend teachers and classified staff and administrators and others to continue to step up.

53:17.040 --> 53:21.040
Substitutes and paras and everyone doing everything that they can.

53:21.040 --> 53:31.040
We have to support and commend our students and our families for their resilience and for their persistence in the face of these very difficult obstacles that we all face.

53:31.040 --> 53:33.040
We are literally fighting for survival.

53:33.040 --> 53:42.040
As many, we've lost loved ones and many continue to be challenged, but we recognize the importance of providing important education for our students.

53:42.040 --> 53:49.040
Thank you to the governor and the Department of Public Health and others for what's now 13 million COVID tests sent to schools since the beginning of December.

53:49.040 --> 53:59.040
I want to also acknowledge so many people working to try and navigate all of the challenges that exist at every single term.

53:59.040 --> 54:08.040
Our county health officers, our county health departments, our first responders, people working in hospitals, we've seen that the spike in cases is so dramatic.

54:08.040 --> 54:12.040
We have to acknowledge all the folks who are doing this incredible work.

54:12.040 --> 54:28.040
I want to acknowledge the California Department of Education staff, state board staff who are doing yeoman's work to answer questions about J13A waivers and school closures and how to get resources to schools in spite of challenges that exist that cannot be controlled.

54:28.040 --> 54:39.040
And so I want to acknowledge all the educational partners in administration, our educator groups, all of them working together to find a way to help us get through these difficult moments.

54:39.040 --> 54:52.040
I want to acknowledge the governor's budget address that we saw earlier this week that triples education spending beyond what we've seen in the last decade in many cases makes some of the highest investments in education that we've ever seen in California history.

54:52.040 --> 55:04.040
And not the least of which is an important cost of living adjustment to help schools as they continue to address high costs to deliver education, to help them address what are we going to do about compensation for educators?

55:04.040 --> 55:09.040
Every single workforce in this nation is experiencing a shortage right now.

55:09.040 --> 55:17.040
No one can find folks and that includes in our education sector with the governor has proposed with the COLA provides great opportunities.

55:17.040 --> 55:26.040
And again, I want to acknowledge the work of Dr. Darling-Hammond and the governor in this year's budget to bring forward examples of ways to support educators and educator training.

55:26.040 --> 55:38.040
And of course to support students in important things like reading and reading coaches and the acknowledgement that there is that we must invest in these skills so that we can help our students.

55:38.040 --> 55:49.040
From the challenges that they've experienced during the pandemic and build skills that will carry them forward in every type of learning that they will ever encounter again in their life.

55:49.040 --> 55:59.040
As we talk about the governor's budget proposal, I want to harken to last year's budget, which we're excited to implement in a way that we think is going to help us transform what happens in California schools.

55:59.040 --> 56:06.040
And again, acknowledging that staff of the Department of Education for important programs that we are working to help implement as we speak.

56:06.040 --> 56:11.040
Community schools, which is on the agenda for discussion later today with our framework.

56:11.040 --> 56:23.040
Universal TK, I have to say so much about what's happening in our early learning and care division and for educators across the state who are envisioning an opportunity for all young people every four year old to get, you know,

56:23.040 --> 56:32.040
Universal TK for us to say that we're going to create more opportunities that this is a pre K through 12 environment and that we're going to support our students going forward.

56:32.040 --> 56:38.040
Universal meals that every student who wants a meal will get two meals regardless of background or paperwork.

56:38.040 --> 56:42.040
Never let these things get in the way of supporting our students.

56:42.040 --> 56:48.040
Since the beginning of the pandemic, our schools have provided upwards of 800 million meals to hungry kids.

56:48.040 --> 56:53.040
School is truly the center and I want to acknowledge all that you all do for our students.

56:53.040 --> 57:06.040
When we make sure kids have a meal, when we make sure they have access to services and health care, we're removing barriers that sometimes complicate their learning experience and we want to make sure that we give that to every single one of our students.

57:06.040 --> 57:11.040
Of course, this last year's budget also includes anti-racism grants.

57:11.040 --> 57:13.040
We must talk about the impacts of race.

57:13.040 --> 57:16.040
We must talk about how we close the achievement gap.

57:16.040 --> 57:25.040
We must talk about the historical impact that racial bias has played and created negative experiences for many of our students and our families.

57:25.040 --> 57:39.040
But we can overcome that, including with the professional development and the training opportunities that this budget provides for helping us to address the issues of race and to recruit and retain new staff who will work in our.

57:39.040 --> 57:53.040
As we turn to what's a new legislative year, you will hear me talking about some of the priorities I've named for us to focus on, including a new legislative proposal that will help us get to 10,000 mental health clinicians.

57:53.040 --> 57:57.040
We've got lots of work to do to help our students in their learning recovery.

57:57.040 --> 58:14.040
But if we can't address the trauma that they have experienced, that we all have experienced, the trauma associated with pandemic, I can't think of a more important issue for us to do as it relates to addressing that trauma by building out the workforce of available counselors to be there to support our students.

58:14.040 --> 58:23.040
You'll hear me talking about a proposal that will allow us to maybe retain 15,000 teachers, keep them in our classrooms by supporting them in their induction programs.

58:23.040 --> 58:32.040
And you'll hear me talking about programs that I think can really help us lead the way as our students continue to learn to recover in their learning.

58:32.040 --> 58:41.040
Dual language programs, an opportunity to recognize that learning a second language supports brain development, that it creates global thinkers of the world.

58:41.040 --> 58:51.040
You'll hear me talking about our reading by third grade initiative where we're putting out some recommendations in just a matter of days and weeks about ways to help support that important milestone.

58:51.040 --> 59:00.040
And I want to acknowledge that more than a million and a half students have already downloaded books through the free book offer that we've made available to them with our partner through the MyON program.

59:01.040 --> 59:11.040
And also want to acknowledge that before we're done, we're going to be putting a million books in the hands of students to help aid and support them and those who do have access to books.

59:11.040 --> 59:28.040
You'll hear us talk about the importance of supporting by literacy, environmental learning, and for us to be intentional about how we support students who've been suspended and pushed out and students who've experienced the impacts of race in our schools and in our communities.

59:28.040 --> 59:34.040
We have big challenges ahead, not the least of which is keeping everyone safe in our schools.

59:34.040 --> 59:42.040
How do we keep our community safe? How do we keep our businesses open? How do we support those who are working to keep us safe in our hospitals and in our health care systems?

59:42.040 --> 59:51.040
We have to address the trauma that our students are experiencing. We have to find ways to help our students recover in their learning and academically.

59:51.040 --> 59:56.040
And of course, we have to set a foundation that will help our students thrive.

59:57.040 --> 01:00:06.040
We can do all these things together and I'm grateful for the resources that we have by our legislature and our state board of education.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:14.040
We look forward to working with you on these priorities and initiatives in 2022 and going forward on behalf of our six million students.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.040
Madam President, this concludes my report.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:21.040
Thank you so very much and thank you for all that you've been doing.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:30.040
I know it's been around the clock for everyone at the department, state board staff, as well as all of our educators in our schools.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:39.040
So I'll just build on those remarks in mind to start with a shout out of love and support to all of our students and families and educators

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:46.040
who are forging ahead valiantly and diligently in the face of the challenges of the latest COVID-19 variant.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:56.040
We see you and we hear you. These are incredibly difficult days. The exhaustion is real. Our workforce and our communities are strained.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:05.040
But I want our education community to know that we're pulling out all the stops to supply you with the resources necessary to keep our schools as safe as possible.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:12.040
Keep students in school to the greatest extent as possible and slow the spread of COVID.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:25.040
Since the start of the pandemic, California has invested $11 billion in the fight against COVID-19 and has saved tens of thousands of lives through the programs of testing and vaccination and support.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:42.040
Throughout most of the fall, we were the safest state in the nation and we continue to be one of the states that is most able to handle the vicissitudes of the pandemic because of the commitments and the investments that we're making.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:54.040
On Friday, Governor Newsom announced a $2.7 billion COVID emergency response package that bolsters testing, accelerates vaccinations and booster efforts.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:03.040
It supports frontline workers. It battles misinformation. We've administered more than 66 million vaccinations and boosters.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:13.040
The plan announced Friday will actually increase that number through in-home vaccination and testing programs to meet Californians where they are and support their health.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:20.040
We will be providing free transportation to vaccination appointments throughout the state to help get more Californians vaccinated and boosted.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:35.040
I know you're aware that for those who have been vaccinated fully, even if they contract Omicron, the likelihood of severe illness is very, very low.

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:41.040
And most of the challenges we have are getting people to be in that much safer space.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:49.040
We've also ramped up testing capacity and provided no-cost testing at 4,400 school sites.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:58.040
And as Superintendent Thurmond noted, the state has delivered approximately 13 million take-home tests to schools since early December.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:17.040
The Cal Office of Emergency Services is working with county offices of education to deliver adult N95 masks to schools, both to manage the surge and the county offices are dealing not only with their own schools, but with helping the schools within their counties.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:32.040
And yesterday, the governor did sign an executive order that will be in place through March 31st to provide staffing flexibility for schools, to support continued safe in-person instruction for students by cutting through the red tape,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:50.040
to allow qualified substitute teachers to help maintain safe learning environments, to have their assignments extended, to provide additional flexibility to support retired teachers who have returned to the classroom and eliminate barriers that may prevent additional retired teachers from returning.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:04:06.040
The governor's long-term strategy to address staffing shortages, as you know, included the $2.9 billion in last year's budget to recruit more teachers and classified staff by underwriting preparation, supporting teacher residencies and grow your own programs,

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:15.040
which many districts have said have been critically important to them in the pandemic year and many more are building for the future.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:26.040
Additional compensation, especially for national board certified teachers who can mentor and serve in high-need schools and providing professional development and training.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:38.040
And so while our focus is on addressing COVID, we also need to look ahead to COVID recovery and beyond that to support schools after this pandemic ends.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:55.040
And it may continue in various forms, but there are once we have helped everyone to be as safe as they can be through vaccination and boosters, we should be able to return to a kind of living that we're all yearning for.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:05:08.040
I know the budget released on Monday built on last year's remarkable investments to further develop a bold vision for re-envisioning public schools as local centers of whole child education.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:18.040
The California blueprint outlines how we can move forward on a whole child, whole school, whole community vision that strengthens California for all.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:26.040
We're going to be working on that through the community schools initiatives and other things we talk about today and into the future.

01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:42.040
Just to give you a few highlights, the state's investment of $119 billion in TK through 12 education, including the highest level of Prop 98 funding in state history, more than double what it was 10 years ago,

01:05:42.040 --> 01:06:03.040
includes the large increase in the local control funding formula that state superintendent mentioned earlier, $3.3 billion and protections against declining enrollment as the number of school aged children in California has been decreasing for a number of years and is projected to continue to decline in some communities.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:13.040
There's another $3.4 billion for expanded learning opportunities before and after school, summer school instruction and integrating arts and music programming.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:23.040
Isn't that nice to hear that come back? Schools will be supported with universal meals support for two meals a day to any student who wants them.

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:32.040
And also resources to build out the kitchen infrastructure to enable fresh meals and support healthy eating and expand the farm to school program.

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:40.040
We have major investments in early childhood care and education that expand access to pre-kindergarten education.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:54.040
We've got our first steps this year towards universal TK by expanding age eligibility for another portion of the four year olds aiming for all of them by 2025.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:07:09.040
We've got additional staff members to reduce pupil student pupil teacher ratios in those TK classes to provide additional funds for access to inclusive preschool for three and four year olds.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:21.040
With a focus on providing high quality supports for students with disabilities, dual language learners, increased funding for state preschool and expanded access to child care up and down the state.

01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:30.040
Some of the teachers for this expanded early childhood program can be launched in their careers through the new funding for college and career pathways.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:46.040
$1.5 billion plus another 500 million for dual credit opportunities to support the development of high school pathway programs focused on education for the first time as well as technology, health care and climate related fields.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:08:03.040
We can launch new educators from teaching career pathways that will extend with their initial early childhood permits if they're going that route into community college and college and begin to build the workforce immediately.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:17.040
We have investments in early literacy, including grants to high need schools to train and hire literacy coaches and reading specialists to guide productive classroom instruction and offer one on one and small group intervention for struggling students.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:22.040
We know a lot about the virtues of high intensity tutoring and how to accomplish it.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:28.040
And we need to make that possible in the places that have the greatest need.

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:36.040
Funding for books in the home through First 5 California and multilingual school and classroom libraries to support reading instruction.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:49.040
As the state superintendent mentioned, his literacy task force will be adding to the whole of the framework for literacy by third grade in California.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:58.040
Expanded investments in special education paired with program improvements, training for educators related to early identification for learning disabilities.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:16.040
And then something that we will get to later, not in this meeting, but in a future meeting, a lot of investment in climate protection and remediation, including a billion plus to support school transportation programs.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:23.040
Focused on greening school bus fleets so that districts can both save money and help save the environment.

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:34.040
And meanwhile, of course, we are working hard to implement the major investments from the last budget for community schools, for mental health services, for educator workforce development, for learning recovery.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.040
We all know these are the right investments at the right time.

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:57.040
They are not only investments in our TK through 12 system or I should say pre K through 12 system, but they are investments that will improve the long term health of communities across our state and bring into close view the California for all that we've all been working toward.

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.040
I know that you're well aware that much of the implementation of these ambitious plans is squarely on our plate.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:18.040
So without further ado, I will move us into our agenda so that we can get down to that business and I'm going to do that by giving you a break before we launch into the community schools discussion.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:32.040
So it is 10 18 now. We will reconvene at 10 30. So you get a 12 minute break now and we will see you again soon. Just turn off your camera and Mike, but don't leave the room.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:50.040
All right, welcome back. Board members, we need to reestablish a quorum. So Brooks is going to call the roll.

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.040
Member Sun.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040
Present.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.040
Member Strauss.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.040
Here.

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.040
Member Rucker.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:00.040
Here.

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.040
Member Rodriguez.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.040
Here.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:05.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040
Here.

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:08.040
Member McQuillan.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.040
Here.

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040
Vice President Glover-Woods.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040
Here.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040
Member Escobedo.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.040
Here.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.040
President Darling-Hammond.

01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040
Here.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.040
Member Burr.

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:22.040
Here.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:24.040
Member Bonacca.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.040
Here.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:27.040
Everyone's present.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:44.040
Terrific. We are now going to turn to item two, which is on our community schools planning. And the item will be presented by Steve Zimmer of the department with Deanna Niebuhr, Pete Callis, and Lisa Borrego available for questions.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.040
And Superintendent Thurman will kick off the presentation for the team.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:50.040
Superintendent, please begin.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:53.040
Thank you, Madam President and members of the board.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:59.040
It's our pleasure to present to you California Community Schools Partnership Program framework.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.040
We've been talking about community schools for quite some time.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:08.040
I know that each of you knows what it is, and I want to thank you for all the ideas you provided and that you'll continue to provide.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:14.040
Just a reminder that there's a nationwide conversation taking place about community schools.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:18.040
And California is leading the way in this conversation.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:25.040
A $3 billion investment of resources to support California schools.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:41.040
There will be planning grants, implementation grants, there will be technical assistance, and there will be resources to support our schools as we continue to try and recover from what is probably the most difficult experience that we're going to ever encounter in our lifetime, dealing with the pandemic.

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:59.040
There will be the opportunity for health resources, mental health resources, social service supports, all kinds of wraparound supports, largely coordinated by a community schools coordinator who will help to direct how those resources get connected to families.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:02.040
But community schools is more than just supports.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:23.040
It gives us a way to transform California schools, to help our schools move away from punishment and to look for restorative practices to support our students, to help us close learning gaps that have impacted students of color and low income students, and to create bright futures for our students and families going before.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:30.040
The framework that is before you has had the contribution of many, many partners.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:38.040
There have been dozens of meetings, there have been town halls, there have been briefings, there have been conversations, there have been consultations.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.040
Everyone has an interest in community schools.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:54.040
Everyone sees it as an opportunity to help us to recover from this difficult moment and to make a difference for all of our schools, whether they be urban, suburban, rural, frontier, you name it.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.040
Community schools offer something for everyone.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:10.040
The community school proves that the school is the center for what we do in many of our communities, and it gives us a way to enhance both teaching and learning and to support the whole child needs of many of our students.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.040
And so we hope that you will appreciate the words in the framework.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:24.040
We look forward to the feedback that you will give us for how to strengthen and enhance it, but we also hope that we will have your approval to move it forward.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:31.040
It gives us a way to create a set of shared understanding of what community schools are.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:40.040
There are definitions, there are examples, there are pillars and commitments that schools are expected to share in common.

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:49.040
But we know that at the end of every single day, every community school will look different according to the community that it is built upon to serve.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:56.040
And so we ask for your feedback today, we ask for your guidance in how we build this framework further, and then how we move it forward.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:15:06.040
But more importantly, how we get on to making it more than just a document that someone will read, but getting to the delivery of the important work that will support six million students across the state.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:16.040
I'm pleased to present to you a number of members of our team, as you've heard from President Darling-Hammond, who will help you and answer any questions that you have.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:28.040
I also want to report on our follow through on the guidance that you have provided us at the previous board meeting to give thought to how community schools integrates with the systems of support.

01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:36.040
How does it impact with what we ask schools to do around LCAP? How do we give it thought so that it is connected to all of the frameworks?

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:44.040
We've decided that it has to be implemented in a way that it connects to all of the important programs to support our six million students.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.040
So we thank you for the feedback. We look forward to the feedback that you'll provide today.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:55.040
And without further ado, allow me to turn the microphone over to Steve Zimmer, who will take you through the remarks in the presentation.

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.040
Thank you very much. I'm looking forward to your feedback.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:06.040
Thank you so much, Superintendent. And I am speaking to you. Good morning, everyone. It's an honor to be here.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:15.040
I'm speaking to you from our State Diagnostic Center in adjacent to Cal State University.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:31.040
I apologize for some of the lighting and technical issues. We couldn't get it quite right this morning, but it is a great honor to speak with you today to bring this item for recommendation.

01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:48.040
I will be presenting a few brief slides. I am joined by Pete Callis, who is our Director of High School and Transitions Division, High School Career Transitions Division in the department.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:57.040
Deanna Niebuhr, who is our Community Schools Coordinator, and Lisa Borrego, who is our Family Engagement Coordinator.

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:16.040
And again, it's a great honor to be able to present this work today. Our recommendation is that the Board of Education approve the proposed California Community Schools Partnership Program Framework and the amendment to the administrative plan.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:33.040
I'm going to talk to you mostly today about the framework. And when we presented in November, we told you that we would begin an engagement process, but we'll talk about a little bit in a later slide.

01:17:33.040 --> 01:18:00.040
We have been able to meet with over 500 interest holders all throughout the state. Students, families, community members, educators, school staff who have shared their stories with us, shared their dreams and aspirations for community schools, shared their experiences in the current system and why community schools are so important to them.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:09.040
And we tried to bring them with us today. We tried to bring them with us to every word in the framework.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:15.040
There's one other thing that I'd like us to do as we begin to look at the framework today.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.040
I'd like us to think about our own schooling experience.

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.040
Our own schools.

01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.040
What did those schools feel like?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.040
What was our relationships there?

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.040
How were we embraced and welcomed?

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:33.040
How were our assets elevated?

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:38.040
Or what were the ways in which we wish that they were?

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:41.040
And I want us to take it even a step further.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:48.040
I want us to think not only about our own schools, our own experience in schools, but who brought us to school?

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:56.040
Our families, our parents or guardians, sometimes our grandparents.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:01.040
How were they welcomed to that school?

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:06.040
How were they viewed as a partner?

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.040
What opportunity did they have to be a decision maker?

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.040
What opportunity do we wish that they would have?

01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:20.040
And so I ask that we hold them with us today as we look at that framework.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:29.040
And think about the families of today and the moment that we're in and how we might be able to transform those relationships.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:38.040
And through transforming those relationships, how might we be able to transform the experience of school, the experience of learning?

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.040
And most importantly, through an equity lens, our outcomes.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:49.040
So in this framework, we will present four pillars of community schools.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:51.040
The key conditions for learning.

01:19:51.040 --> 01:20:07.040
The cornerstone commitments that we are hoping everyone who engages in this journey will make the proven practices in the key roles.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:13.040
Move to the next slide.

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:19.040
So the four pillars or community schools are recognized throughout the state and nationally.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:32.040
They involve integrated student supports, family and community engagement, collaborative leadership, practices for educators and administrators, and extended or expanded learning time and opportunities.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:39.040
These are pillars that are recognized through quality community school programs here in the state and throughout the nation.

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:45.040
Next slide, please.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.040
We also want to focus and we focus on the framework and key conditions for learning.

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.040
After all, this is about learning.

01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:23.040
And so we lean heavily on the science of learning development when we outline that what we expect in our community schools are supportive learning environments that foster strong relationships, a sense of belonging and purpose, instructional strategies that motivate, increase competence, social and emotional learning that foster skills and habits and mindset that enable academic progress, but also a sense of agency.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:33.040
Systems of support that enable healthy development that are responsive to student needs that understand and address learning barriers.

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:37.040
Next slide, please.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.040
Here's where we focus the law of art.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:50.040
What are the cornerstone commitments that we hope that all California community schools will make that we expect they will make?

01:21:50.040 --> 01:22:02.040
We expect that they will commit to being an assets-driven and strength-based school that values and draws on the collective wisdom of students and families and the community.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:15.040
We expect they will have racially just and restorative school clients that nurture and support all students in the totality of school interactions.

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:23.040
We expect that instruction will be powerful, it will be culturally proficient, and that it will be relevant.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.040
It will be centered in the wisdom and the history and the culture of the community.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.040
It will be rooted in practices inspiring.

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:38.040
It's inquiry-oriented, it's project-based and formed by the ideals of co-learning.

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:55.040
And finally, we expect that there will be authentic shared decision-making and participatory practices in all aspects of school governance, and that these practices will genuinely engage students, families, staff, and community members.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.040
Real decision-making about school climate, about instruction, about the delivery of services.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.040
Next slide, please.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:10.040
What are some proven practices that outline this in our framework?

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:13.040
Community asset mapping and gap analysis.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:19.040
I want to point out here how different this is in needs of assessment.

01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.040
We want to focus on assets.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.040
We want our community schools to elevate assets.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:34.040
So we engaged school and community interest holders in a coherent process of identifying and curating those assets.

01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.040
What are those wisdoms throughout the community?

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:47.040
And then once we identify the assets, only then do we look at the gaps, rather than starting with the assumption that there are only needs and gaps.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:51.040
It's a best practice to have a community school coordinated.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:24:08.040
There are many staffing models for this, but we have seen in California and throughout the nation, successful community schools have a discrete position that is responsible for the community school processes, programs, the partnerships, and the implementation strategies of school sites.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:32.040
We've also seen the successful programs, successful community schools, have both site-based and LEA-based advisory councils that meaningfully engage the community, the whole of the community, staff, families, and students in determining the focus and direction of the community schools effort.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:59.040
And we see that successful programs are integrated and aligned with other relevant and important programs, as we talk about many times, existing efforts around restorative practice and racially just schools, our multi-tiered systems of support, our statewide systems of support, our new initiatives around delivery of mental health services, expanding learning time, universal TK, and the statewide literacy initiative, just to mention a few.

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:02.040
Next slide, please.

01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:22.040
We outline key roles in the framework for our LEAs, for our county offices of education as service coordinators, whether or not they apply to be technical assistance centers, convening our local government agencies and making sure those supports can be integrated at the school site.

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:28.040
Technical assistance centers, and we'll talk a little bit about that RFA process.

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:43.040
These will be the key, there will be a statewide lead TA center, and we'll talk about that in a later slide, but our regional TA centers will deliver content in a way that is coherent.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:26:12.040
They will offer coaching and professional development and models of practice, but they will also be attuned to and adjusting this coaching to their understanding of the vast diversity, both geographically and diversity in every way, the rich diversity that is California, to ensure that the TA that is offered regionally is appropriate to the many different types of LEAs that will be available.

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:30.040
And finally, our department, the California Department of Education, we're setting up and evaluating a coherent implementation plan, but also effective assessments as we move forward in this effort.

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.040
Next slide, please.

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:47.040
So we're going to move on to the framework to one significant amendment to the administrative plan that you approve in November, and that is to have a lead technical assistance center RFA.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:59.040
And this lead technical assistance center will be responsible for building content and overarching methodology for the technical assistance across the state.

01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:08.040
We'll be responsible for building an implementation rubric to articulate the benchmarks for community schools implementation, facilitate a community of practice.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:11.040
I think this is particularly important.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:21.040
A community practice amongst the regional technical assistance centers and coordinate and maximize expertise amongst these regional technical assistance centers.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:25.040
This is a transformational process.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:49.040
There will be areas of our state, there will be communities, LEAs and particular schools that are able to establish expertise that can then be shared and exported so that it could be part of accelerating the transformation process through community schools.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:58.040
The RFA for this, for the technical assistance, the regional technical assistance centers will follow this RFA or lead technical assistance center.

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:00.040
Next slide, please.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:02.040
A couple of updates for you.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:12.040
We told you that the planning grant RFA and the implementation grant, the initial implementation grant RFA, the first round for each of these would be in the winter.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040
We're in the winter right now.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:17.040
It will be during the month of February that these will be completed.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:22.040
Next slide, please.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:30.040
We were asked to also do some breakdowns in terms of when we get to implementation grant.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:35.040
You know, just ranges for funding.

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:49.040
So in alignment with other previous grant programs, we've developed this kind of breakdown of small schools, small to medium schools, medium to large schools, and large schools.

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:54.040
Going to the next slide, please.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:00.040
We talked about, I talked about a little bit about our regional forums.

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:17.040
Again, we've been able to complete these during the month of November and December, six virtual forums throughout the state, encompassing many regions from rural and tribal communities to our urban centers.

01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:37.040
And again, we were able to hear from over 500 interest holders directly, and we were able through great collaboration process to break out into small groups and really hear from each participant directly about their vision and priority for community schools in their own neighborhood or region.

01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:54.040
We are in the process of scheduling office hours, and I want to be very open to say we had scheduled during the month of January site visits, or I hope for everybody here would be understandable reasons.

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:57.040
We have postponed those.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:15.040
We do not want schools to be distracted by anything, even positive things, other than keeping their students and staff and family safe right now and continuing to be open to continue the learning process.

01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:23.040
So those two parts of our engagement strategy will really be, you know, through the month of February.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.040
Next slide, please.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:41.040
So here are some additional updates and we want to be very open with you that this is a ongoing process when we left you in November, we said we would report back here in January, but that everything would not be done and everything is not done.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.040
So here are some things that we are still working on, they're still in process.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:53.040
We are still gathering information, we are still listening and co learning prior to the release of the RFA.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:57.040
The RFA process is still in development.

01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:06.040
Specific decisions around grant allocations and the specific timeline is still under discussion.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:13.040
Of course, we are very, very conscious of the pressures on LEAs in this moment.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:19.040
Accountability plan strategy, those conversations are ongoing.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:39.040
We are, as I mentioned in November, we are in the process, the superintendent is in the process of determining a state community schools advisory board, membership for that board, and the scope and cadence of their of their meetings.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:46.040
We are formalizing, we are committed to, but we are still formalizing what our youth engagement component will be.

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:56.040
And we are still, as I mentioned in previous slides, formalizing our TA content infrastructure and the functioning of that TA delivery.

01:31:56.040 --> 01:32:00.040
Next slide, please.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:13.040
And I want to share with you that these discussions have begun within CDE and we plan to continue these discussions and continue to have them become even more robust as we move forward.

01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:18.040
This is not an exhaustive list, but we want you to know our thinking.

01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:43.040
We know that this transformational effort around community schools will only have transformational outcomes, will only have the equity outcomes that the superintendent has charged us with, has articulated his vision for community schools as not only a school transformation initiative,

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:59.040
but as a school transfer, as a, as a equity initiative that transforms outcomes for students who for far too long have had outcomes that have lagged behind it.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:04.040
So, these areas of alignments will help to support that.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:21.040
We are exploring alignment with our state system of support, statewide systems of support, our multi-tiered systems of support, our universal TK initiative, our expanding learning initiatives, our special education program, our college and career readiness programs,

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:38.040
our multilingual support programs, school climate transformation efforts, efforts to expand student mental health, and our educator professional development programs, including the efforts that the superintendent outlined in his introduction,

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:52.040
around our initiatives, around expanding educators of color, educators with shared experience, but also expanding our school mental health providers.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:34:08.040
These are all areas in which we hope to align and build coherence between this California Community Schools Partnership Program and the other essential transformational programs in our, in our state.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.040
Last slide, please.

01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:23.040
So again, our recommendation is that the state board approve the proposed California Community Schools Partnership Program framework and this amendment to the administrative plan.

01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:35.040
I thank the superintendent for his vision, for his leadership. I thank our board president and, and the state board staff for their amazing partnership with us.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:54.040
I think everybody who has participated in our forums, and especially our team at CDE, I may have been presenting today, but they have done just round the clock remarkable work to pull this presentation together.

01:34:54.040 --> 01:35:00.040
It's pretty amazing that we've never met each other in person. It's an honor to work with them.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:25.040
And they have held our students, our families very close to everything that we've done as we've done our level best to meet the assignments that you have given us last in November, and to really honor the aspiration and dreams that we believe can come true through the implementation of this program.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:31.040
Thank you, Madam President, and we're happy to respond to questions from the board.

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:42.040
Thank you, Mrs. Zimmer. Madam President Darling-Hammond, we're turning it back to you, but wanted to also acknowledge you for being such a champion for community schools in our state nationwide.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:56.040
It's been helpful and grateful to have the almost weekly meetings with you and our other board liaison for community schools, Dr. Escobedo. Thank you for your incredible insights in those conversations.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:05.040
We want to thank our partnership with the Stuart Foundation. They've expressed deep interest in supporting this work, and they've supported a number of the staff who are helping us to do this work.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:27.040
And of course, Steve Zimmer, who you just heard from, who's living this day and night, and Deanna Niebuhr together, who have helped to provide for you, Lisa Buretto, Pete Callis, State Board staff, Sarah and Brooke Salin, and of course, our Chief Deputy Superintendent, Mary Nicely, all of whom are all available to answer any questions that you might have.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.040
Turning it back to you, Madam President.

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:41.040
Thank you so much. And thanks to all of the staff who have been working night and day on this at the department. There was a lot of work going on over the break, I know, and we really appreciate it.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:59.040
We're going to put the public comment slide up so that we can see if people can get in the queue. And members of the public who want to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that's shown now.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:16.040
While we're waiting for members of the public to call in, I'll ask Member Escobedo if he has any initial comments before I make my comments as liaisons to this item, and then we'll see if there are clarifying questions before we go to public comment and save our discussion after the public comment.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.040
Member Escobedo.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:39.040
Yes, thank you. And I would like to, again, thank the staff for just the amazing work in drafting this framework. And I want to stress that a good student support system cannot compensate for a weak instructional program.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:38:08.040
And what this framework has is that, has created that symbiotic relationship between a good support system and a solid instructional program. And I just am very impressed with the amount of dedication, the research embedded in this framework that I know we will be able to create excellent decisions.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:34.040
And I'm very impressed on not only which organizations will be receiving this grant, but we will be a research site that many other states will learn from. And I do believe we are in the verge of transforming education through this process.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:55.040
I totally agree. And just want to also both reinforce the point that you made about the integration between the core of schooling and the support services that wrap around and the integration of those around a relationship centered, student centered, thoughtful approach to education generally.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:14.040
And also just commend the State Department staff for all of the attention that they've paid to the feedback that they've gotten in all of those many, many sessions. I know how seriously that has informed the thinking and the writing of the framework.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:34.040
And I also am just thrilled about the decision that the department is taking to really try to infuse and integrate the many programs that get piled up as policy is made into a coherent, integrated approach. That's hard, hard work to do.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:56.040
We know it will not be all that easy, perhaps, but it is really, really important work and we appreciate you taking that on. With that, are there clarifying questions at this point from any of the board members that we need to answer just about the presentation and framework?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:15.040
And I am not seeing any at the moment, so we're going to go to public comment and then we'll come back for our discussion. Do we have public comment? Yes, we do. I will open up the public comment line now for item number two.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:25.040
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:32.040
Hi, my name is Asher Kai. I'm a youth organizer with Californians for Justice.

01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:51.040
Go ahead, caller. Good morning, President Darling-Hammond and State Board of Education members. My name is Asher Kai. I'm a youth organizer with Californians for Justice, a statewide youth organization, and I've come to learn that students are being left out of the decision making process yet again.

01:40:51.040 --> 01:41:06.040
One of the community school pillars is called family and community engagement, so we propose adding students to that pillar, and if we can't change the pillar, then we have to define family engagement as including students.

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:13.040
When I was a student myself at Edison High School several years ago, CFJ ran a campaign called the Student Voice Campaign.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:29.040
And during that entire process, students were seemingly left out of the decision making process around LCFF, which essentially contradicted the main objective of students feeling as though they had a voice to make a difference and be the difference in their schools and communities.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.040
The truth is, students need to be able to utilize their voices.

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.040
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:44.040
Next caller, you have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:52.040
Andre Spearman, parent leader with Faith in Action East Bay Pico California and the California Partnership for the Future of Learning.

01:41:52.040 --> 01:42:07.040
We strongly support the framework's emphasis on shared governance and decision making power. The commitment to ensuring that school and district multi stakeholder bodies demonstrate support from all stakeholders at each step of the process must be a condition of receiving grant funding.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:16.040
These bodies deal with essential, ensuring that students and families of color are equal and respected co-leaders to co-create the transformational vision for community schools.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:25.040
This means that students and families have to be involved in co-creating a multi stakeholder decision making body, along with educators and community partners.

01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:30.040
These teams must be empowered and supported to lead together to reimagine and improve schools and districts.

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:36.040
Nothing less will result as desired transformation vision is at the heart of the community school partnership.

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.040
I thank you and congratulate you on the work being done thus far.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.040
Thank you.

01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:53.040
Next caller, you have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:08.040
Next caller, you have one minute. Your time starts now.

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:17.040
My name is Maritza Benmulis. I am community organizer with Ocopico Education for Liberation and anchor member of the California Partnership for Future Learning.

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:29.040
We appreciate the strong equity focus on the proposed framework and recommend that before adopting the board strengthen the language of the four pillars of community schools by adding shared power to the collaborative leadership and practice pillar.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:35.040
Shared power and authentic partnership between students, family, educators and community partners at every level.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:39.040
School district and state is essential for true racial equity and inclusion.

01:43:39.040 --> 01:43:49.040
Shared governance has also been proven to deepen the level of involvement from students, families, educators, as well as foster greater ownership of schools transformation.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:44:04.040
Additionally, black indigenous people of color and other directly impacted low income students and families, including students with disabilities, must not only be consulted for information and perspective, but their input must actually impact decision on how dollars are invested.

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:11.040
Thank you for considering adding shared power to the collaborative leadership and practices pillar of the framework.

01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:13.040
Thank you.

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:23.040
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:41.040
Good morning. My name is Terry. I am a group tribal member and executive director of the True North Organizing Network. We're a multi-faith, multi-race social justice organization organizing the tribes, Native Americans, Latinx, black and white people throughout humble Del Norte and tribal lands.

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:56.040
We appreciate the community engagement done by CDE to date, including hosting the six regional forums that our organization supported. I appreciate particularly the superintendent's comments this morning when he said that schools are the center of our communities.

01:44:56.040 --> 01:45:06.040
We believe that as well. We look forward to having ongoing opportunity for impacted community members to provide meaningful input on program implementation.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:21.040
And first of all, we are pleased to see the clear focus of equity on the framework. And secondly, impacted community should be able to comment on the upcoming RFAs and its process to ensure that the community schools program remains grounded in the expertise of people who live and work in their communities.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:27.040
Thank you.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.040
Thank you.

01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:37.040
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:50.040
Good morning, Eric Morrison Smith, policy associate with PolicyLink and the Alliance of Boys and Girls College. We appreciate the strong equity focus on the proposed framework and recommend the board make the following amendments to further strengthen before adoption.

01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:58.040
Punitive disciplinary practices and the criminalization of students are inconsistent with the cornerstone commitments to a racially just and restorative school climate.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:12.040
We recommend explicitly prohibiting the use of community school funds for police and school resource officers, school hardening measures or any practices that criminalize students and instead allocate these resources for much needed student services.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:20.040
The Alliance of Boys Men of Color works to expand access to opportunity, health and well-being and transform systems that are filling boys men of color, their families and communities.

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:27.040
Creating safe schools for all students where they are not criminalized and instead are provided support as a foundational component of racially just schools.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:36.040
Thank you for considering our framework amendment, which is rooted in direct engagement of impacted students, families and educators who the community schools program is intended to serve. Thank you.

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.040
Thank you.

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:46.040
Good morning, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:59.040
Erin Apdy on behalf of the California Partnership for the Future of Learning. We urge you to approve the proposed amendment to the administrative plan to add a statewide lead technical assistance center and recommend adding the lead TA center to the framework key roles.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:11.040
Having a lead TA center design content, develop delivery models and facilitate a community of practice will ensure that regional TA providers use best practice models for meaningful and transformative student and family engagement.

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:22.040
And while we support the general approach of connecting implementation grant awards to school size, we believe that a minimum threshold amount is needed to do community schools transformation work well, regardless of school enrollment.

01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:28.040
For example, whether you're an elementary school with 400 students or a comprehensive high school with 1500.

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:39.040
Many of the basic costs of doing asset and needs mapping and planning that authentically engages students, families, educators and community partners would be the same as with the salary for community school coordinator.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:49.040
We appreciate that CDE is continuing to solicit input and urge them to have conversations with folks engaged in this work before finalizing the implementation grant amount tiers in the RFA. Thank you.

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.040
Thank you.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:58.040
Good morning color please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:08.040
Good morning. My name is Michael Juba, and I am representing the California Teachers Association, CTA has outlined many recommendations in our letter, but would like to highlight some now.

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:20.040
We support the approach outlined in the revised plan to identify a lead TA center, and we believe that requiring letters of interest from interested parties would be a beneficial addition to the plan.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:28.040
We believe that there is a lack of information regarding how much LEAs with existing community schools can access and for how long.

01:48:28.040 --> 01:48:40.040
This seems unfair to the LEAs that are ahead of the curve in implementing transformational community schools, such as LA USD Oakland unified San Diego unified and others.

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:56.040
And lastly, CTA recommends a stronger language regarding the democratic decision making process at the site, and the LA level for community schools, as well as bargaining unit sign off on the grant applications to help ensure collaboration.

01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:59.040
Thank you. Thank you.

01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:01.040
Good morning.

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:26.040
Dr. Heyn Kimner with the California Community Schools Learning Exchange. Good morning, we appreciate CDE's inclusive process and the continued development of the CCSPP framework and for delineating the key system level roles and responsibilities that are part of successful implementation.

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:38.040
At the state level to ensure sustainable and transformative system behaviors, we encourage you to very explicitly incentivize opportunities for coordination with and within the system of support.

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:53.040
Technical assistance should not be another competing initiative among many for funding or a siloed programmatic effort. Instead, it must demonstrate and model coherence and alignment across existing and new improvement efforts including the community engagement initiative.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:50:06.040
California MTSS 21st Century School Leadership Academy AB 2083 system of care, Universal TK and ELOP among others. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Hi, good morning. My name is Leticia Garcia on behalf of Riverside County Superintendent of Schools. I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank staff for their work on the equity focused proposed framework with a goal on getting these critical funds out to the field as soon as possible and for prioritizing the first round of implementation grants to be available to existing community school programs to begin meeting the student needs.

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:26.040
We also appreciate and support a streamlined application process that recognizes that the field is overwhelmed with the day to day challenges of staying open for kids. We look forward to continuing to be part of this conversation. And lastly, to the board members retiring. Thank you for your invaluable service over the years and to the 2022 board leadership congratulations on your appointment. Thank you.

01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:28.040
Thank you.

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:36.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:55.040
Good morning, Jessica Socko on behalf of children now. If I'd like to start by appreciating all the work that has gone into the development of this framework. We support the focus on first selecting a statewide lead for the technical center and with that the statewide lead then having an active role in shaping the other technical centers, including

01:51:55.040 --> 01:52:10.040
and appreciate the acknowledgement for technical assistance providers and the need to focus on inclusion of expanded learning, mental and physical health, MTSS, etc. across the state to connect and integrate this work.

01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:21.040
It will take a concerted effort at the state district and school level to ensure that planning and implementation for community schools actively engages community partners and is effectively integrated with the LCAP process.

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:36.040
The CPSA the comprehensive school improvement plans and 12 other major district plans added over the last year. It is especially important that LCAP use of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds are well aligned with the planning of community schools. Thank you.

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.040
Thank you.

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:47.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:54.040
Good morning, Lucero Chavez on behalf of the parent Institute for quality education and a member of the LCFF equity coalition.

01:52:54.040 --> 01:53:01.040
We would like to thank the board for developing the community schools framework and maintaining that equity lens throughout.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:15.040
We're also very thankful for including the input of more than 500 families in the process because an organization that serves more than 18,000 families annually across California, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds.

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:21.040
So we truly believe in the effectiveness of community schools to coordinate resources and opportunities.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:38.040
We also wanted to echo the LCFF coalition's letter and urge the board to include early education in the framework to support language affirming practices for English learners including hiring multilingual staff and support and to align community schools with funding streams like the LCFF and LCAP.

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:43.040
Thank you so much for your work and we look forward to continue being part of this great conversation.

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.040
Thank you.

01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:53.040

Hello, my name is this is Dr. Kendra fair with the California Community Schools Learning Exchange in collaboration with pay with policy analysis for California education at Stanford and the consensus and collaboration program at Sacramento State.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:18.040
CSLX is facilitating a transparent and inclusive process to engage school, community, family and youth stakeholders and identifying the cultures, systems and practices that are foundational to effective community school implementation.

01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:26.040
Our process aligns with and complements the department's community schools framework by continuing to lift up the wisdom of community school practitioners across the state.

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:36.040
We applaud the department's framework and process and centering strength based practices, racially just school climate, culturally proficient instruction and participatory practices.

01:54:36.040 --> 01:54:44.040
The framework offers a North Star and in our work to deepen community school systems and practices CSLX and our collaborators aim to help elaborate the how.

01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:46.040
Thank you so much for this important work.

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.040

Good morning Brianna brands on behalf of the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association representing the 50 county superintendents of schools.

01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:19.040
We believe county offices of education can and should play an essential role in successfully implementing PCFTP as technical assistance centers within a coherent system of supporting school districts as opposed to this item the roles and responsibilities of the statewide

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:27.040
technical assistance center and regional technical assistance centers reflective framework for systems change the county offices are deeply familiar with.

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:31.040
We look forward to the upcoming RFA and thank you for your time.

01:55:31.040 --> 01:55:33.040
Thank you.

01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:44.040

Okay next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:12.040
Good morning President Darling-Hammond and board members this is Liz Guillen for public advocates.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:19.040
We support the four cornerstone commitments in the framework that were outlined by Deputy Superintendent Zimmer this morning.

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:35.040
These commitments though need to be realized and we urge you to make them corners make the cornerstone commitment conditions of receiving grant funding by embedding them in the RFA for LEA and schools and lead and regional technical assistance providers.

01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:51.040
We also recommend providing field guidance as part of the forthcoming implementation rubric to help grantees understand how components of the framework including the cornerstone commitments should be reflected at each stage of the planning and implementation process.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:57:00.040
Lastly we recommend that the TA lead prioritize capacity building to support grantees in executing these commitments.

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:07.040
I'll close by thanking all the outgoing board members for their demonstrated commitment to equity and racial justice.

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.040
Thank you.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:10.040
Thank you.

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:17.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:24.040
My name is Dr. Anya Hurwitz and I'm the executive director of SEAL Sobrato Early Academic Language.

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:31.040
We have been working for well over a decade to center the assets and needs of our state's youngest multilingual learners.

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:40.040
The work to align and integrate early learning and K-12 systems and approaches is critical to move us towards educational equity.

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:48.040
Therefore I urge the State Board of Education and CDE to thread the early learning focus more fully across this framework.

01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:57.040
This investment is an opportunity to do the complicated and necessary work to redesign our systems in ever more thoughtful and intentional ways.

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:07.040
By threading the focus of early learning throughout the framework we will be setting a clear vision for the role of early learning within our educational ecosystems in California.

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:16.040
Furthermore this P-12 alignment must elevate and build upon the cultural and linguistic assets of our communities and children.

01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:21.040
This framework is a prime space to move this forward in powerful ways. Thank you.

01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:22.040
Thank you.

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:30.040

Hi good morning President Donaham and members of the board.

01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:37.040
LeAngela Reed on behalf of the Small School Districts Association.

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:50.040
I'd like to thank the CDE and State Board staff for incorporating the feedback that came in in November and we are particularly appreciative of the recognition of the what we call the super smalls in the enrollment categories.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:55.040
And the streamlined process with everything going on for LEAs.

01:58:55.040 --> 01:59:04.040
We greatly appreciate the awareness of what they're facing and for our small districts the staff shortages hitting particularly hard.

01:59:04.040 --> 01:59:10.040
So we look forward to the technical assistance that will be very helpful in getting these community schools out there to serve our families.

01:59:10.040 --> 01:59:11.040
So we thank you for that.

01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:24.040
I'd like to congratulate the leadership of the board for their election and I will save my comments for our retiring members our leading members for later on but want to thank you all for your service.

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.040
Thank you.

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:35.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

01:59:35.040 --> 01:59:39.040
Hello I'm Shelley Kurth on behalf of the Small School District Association.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:47.040
It is vitally important that the department explicitly address and support the present realities of small and rural districts and charters.

01:59:47.040 --> 02:00:05.040
In effect traditional competitive grant processes historically right off small LEAs especially given the current mandated planning and reporting associated with items like AB 130, UTK, TLOP, LCAP, SR3 on top of our COVID responses.

02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:14.040
SSDA members request that you consider all of the ways that plans and processes can be simplified and consolidated for small and rural districts and charters.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:21.040
We recognize that these are really important and transformative opportunities and we really need your support and guidance.

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:22.040
Thank you.

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.040
Thank you.

02:00:24.040 --> 02:00:32.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:45.040
I'm Marta Hernandez with Californians Together and Speak in strong support of the Community Schools Framework with a recommendation that it be augmented to align with the California English Learner Roadmap Policy.

02:00:45.040 --> 02:01:00.040
A recommendation necessary for community schools to be the powerful model they can be by inclusively speaking to the needs of and embracing English learner and immigrant students and families and uplifting issues of language and bi-literacy.

02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:13.040
You have been provided with a recently developed crosswalk by Californians Together between the four pillars of the traditional community schools model, the EL Roadmap and the Racial Equity Transformational Framework.

02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:24.040
Taking aspects of all three together they provide a strong framework for community schools that can powerfully and inclusively serve linguistically and culturally diverse communities.

02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:35.040
We strongly urge the State Board of Education to incorporate this crosswalk language into the framework and I also extend a big thanks to the outgoing board members.

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:36.040
Thank you very much.

02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.040
Thank you.

02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:45.040
Good morning caller please state your name and affiliation for the record your time starts now.

02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.040
Good morning.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:51.040
My name is Enrique Rocho and I'm here representing the San Diego Unified School District.

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:57.040
We thank the board and the department for the work to develop the grant program for community schools.

02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:12.040
San Diego Unified deeply believes in the mission of community schools and we are working on a plan to transform several of our schools into community schools and we are doing this in partnership with community members and labor representatives.

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:27.040
We appreciate the grant amount recommendations and we just urge the board to maximize funding for school sites as our analysis shows that the average cost can range anywhere from 400,000 to 500,000.

02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:28.040
Thank you very much.

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.040
Thank you.

02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:32.040
That concludes public comment for item number two.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.040
Thank you very much to all the public commenters.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:51.040
I know we are listening closely and taking it all in both for this moment and for all of the work that's going to unfold over the coming months.

02:02:51.040 --> 02:03:01.040
I want to now open up for a board discussion and let me see who's ready to kick that off.

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:09.040
Member Rucker, why am I not surprised that your hand went up first?

02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:16.040
I actually think my colleagues waited to see if I was going to say that.

02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:18.040
Probably true.

02:03:18.040 --> 02:03:27.040
I do need to commend and thank the superintendent as well as the team that he put together to do this work.

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:43.040
I'm going to say frankly in November when I saw not the write-up, I was immersed in the detail and the attention that was paid in the write-up, but I was also convinced that I was going to do this work.

02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:58.040
It's kind of at the start of a major undertaking like this, you are concerned not only about how you're going to do the work, but also understanding and then articulating to everyone else what the scope of the work is going to be.

02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:14.040
And while it's tempting for me to want to see everything done and everything in place at the outset, what I appreciate most from what I heard from Steve Zimmer and his team was the learning curve that they are on as well as the fact that the documents they are creating are

02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:22.040
intended to live in this process and grow in scope, dimension and aspect over the course of this implementation.

02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:31.040
So the only things that I'm going to comment on or at least leave some advice for you to consider are these.

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:47.040
As I heard Superintendent Thurmond say, there is a context within which this is going to be implemented and that is paying attention to the initiatives and the planning that is already in place and continuing and ongoing at the school site.

02:04:47.040 --> 02:05:00.040
So paying attention to how to lay this over as part of the template with the LCAP planning and other school improvement initiatives are very important, and it's very important to have heard that stated today.

02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:06.040
My recommendation is that you are going to be able to do this work.

02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:18.040
My recommendation is the conversation with the other divisions in your department have to be ongoing and continuous, and they need to start working in a vacuum and thinking among yourselves is great because you'll agree with everything you think about.

02:05:18.040 --> 02:05:28.040
But the perspective of hearing from other folks who have done this work already and are deeply involved in this work is going to be very important.

02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:45.040
Because you'll agree with everything you think about, but the perspective of hearing from other folks who have done this work already and are deeply immersed in supporting and working with the schools will give some context to some of the elements you are considering and the guidance that you are offering.

02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:51.040
The second piece that I would like you to think about is coherent.

02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:56.040
Over the scope of time, there's going to naturally be this mission drift.

02:05:56.040 --> 02:06:11.040
There's naturally going to be some things that will be tempting to take on or some issues or actions that you are asked to contemplate and to figure out in some way how to bring under the umbrella of the community school.

02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:26.040
My advice and recommendation is to stay pure, not only with the legislative intent, but to look at and always define the scope of your work by the four pillars that you have articulated in this plan.

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:40.040
They are all encompassing, but at the same time, they are very distinctive and very purposeful and very pointed in the reasons why those pillars serve as the foundational elements for this program.

02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:46.040
And then finally, the last piece of advice I want to offer you is to continue learning.

02:06:46.040 --> 02:06:55.040
You don't know all the answers and I appreciate your humility in saying that today, but the fact is you're never going to know all the answers.

02:06:55.040 --> 02:07:06.040
And this is the question about what is in the best needs of the students and how is this community school fostering the outcomes and the goals that we have laid out here.

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:18.040
Those need to be the questions you continue to live with and not simply strive for the day when you can stand in front of the board and say we have the definitive answer, we know everything.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:27.040
Because if you ever arrive at the moment where you believe you know everything about this program and you have figured it all out, you will ultimately fail this program.

02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:35.040
So I want to thank you for what you've done. Thank you for your expressions of your commitment to collaboration and collegiality.

02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:51.040
But most important, I want to thank you for the exploration that you are undertaking with doing this work and your willingness to humble yourself to live with the questions and to say, I don't know, but this is something worth talking about and exploring.

02:07:51.040 --> 02:08:04.040
Thank you. And I know that is the framework that everyone is bringing to this process. I have Member McQuillin, Glover Woods, Strausper and Son in that order. So Member McQuillin.

02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:17.040
Thank you. And well said, Member Rucker. It's hard to follow that up. You've said it all. But I just want to say my appreciation for this presentation and this overall effort.

02:08:17.040 --> 02:08:28.040
You know, it does seem like it's right on time with what our schools are dealing with right now in the pandemic and trying to, attempting to come out of it.

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:37.040
It seems to be well in order to help our students and our families, our staff deal with the mental health issues.

02:08:37.040 --> 02:09:06.040
I'm also thankful for this entire initiative that it be based in from the community with culture in mind and the technical assistance centers and I'm thankful for that and that we and hopeful that we take into consideration the diversity of our state, the different sizes of our LEAs and districts throughout the state, keeping that in mind.

02:09:06.040 --> 02:09:22.040
And the stress that our staff and our schools are under right now. I'm so thankful that we're kind of expanding out the opportunities for applying over the next couple of years because of that stress.

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:38.040
So many of our schools are dealing with the shortages of staff and positive tests right now and there's a lot coming at our schools right now. I'm very stressed out. So we need to definitely consider that. Thank you.

02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:44.040
Great. Thank you so much. Member Glover Woods.

02:09:44.040 --> 02:10:00.040
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond. First would like just to underscore the gratitude and the thanks for all of the staff that have worked so diligently on getting this framework developed as well as my fellow board members and our state superintendent.

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:17.040
This was definitely not an easy task to undertake, a very important one, but one that was not easy. So thank you for all the work that has gone into developing the framework and future thanks for all the work that's going to go into taking it to the next step.

02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:40.040
I do applaud the addition of the LEAD Technical Assistance Center. That was a critical piece to ensure that we have continuity as this model is implemented throughout our state and also thanks to really listening to so many educational partners throughout our state and incorporating their feedback in what has happened.

02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:55.040
Just a couple of thoughts as we move forward. And these may be thoughts that have already been discussed. So please understand. I know that there's quite a bit that happens in conversations and meetings that we may not always get to hear all of during our meetings.

02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:20.040
One of the first pieces I just want to encourage is to really try to nail down base amounts for the implementation grants. Because there's a matching requirement, I do feel that anyone who is going to want to implement at the LEA level would need to have some dollar figure to be able to work off of.

02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:44.040
And it may also impact whether they decide to apply for a planning grant to move forward. So as quickly as we can at least determine some type of a base amount for the implementation grants, be them tiered by some of the suggestions that have come out in the item by size of school or otherwise, that will be really critical for the field to have.

02:11:44.040 --> 02:12:00.040
Another point of encouragement and thought is around the technical assistance aspect of things. I just can't emphasize enough how helpful graphics and visuals are as we move forward in the process.

02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:14.040
So if there is a way to develop and publicize a graphic related to the timeline for the RFA process for both the planning and implementation grant, I think that could be helpful to the field and to our communities.

02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:42.040
Also, some type of graphic that can give a visual on the interconnectedness we've been talking about this morning, kind of the interconnectedness of the pillars and the commitments to our existing processes for the LCAP, to the system of support entities, having something that is able to visually represent that as well as in a written format will be very, very helpful.

02:12:42.040 --> 02:13:10.040
Lastly, I just encourage everyone to continue working with our educational partners that have provided feedback for the framework. Also keeping in mind some of the feedback we've gotten on incorporating language around the students as educational partners, language and early education, and incorporating that language as appropriate to our pillars and commitments and even language in the RFA document.

02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:26.040
So again, applause, applause for all of the hard work. I think this is going to be another one of those California way implementations. Quite excited about that as we continue to lead work in education. Thank you so much for allowing me to comment.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:54.040
Terrific. I'm going to encourage CDE staff to keep track of points that they may want to respond to, and we will come back after we've heard from everyone. And I know that they're keeping track of all the suggestions as well. And I have in the queue, Member Strauss, Member Burr, Member Sun, Member Buenaca, and Member Rodriguez and Member Patio-Bronson. So Member Strauss.

02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:12.040
Thank you. So I know, first of all, this is a huge investment, $3 billion, a huge transformational opportunity. I know it's supported by Governor Newsom, President Darling-Hammond, and State Superintendent Thurmond, and I know everybody's been working really, really hard to get this developed.

02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:31.040
I just would say the opportunity is huge. The timing right now for the field is challenging. And I think we heard that from our comments, both from board members and from the public, that the field right now is trying to hold on and just keep schools open with the huge pandemic surge and what's happening.

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:53.040
So I want to be thoughtful about going slow to go fast. This is a lot of money over time that could make a significant difference. What we heard also from our board members and from the public is the need to build a coherent, aligned program so that this is not another categorical layer that sits on top.

02:14:53.040 --> 02:15:07.040
And what I heard Deputy Superintendent Zimmer said is we hope to align and build coherence. I think we all hope that. It doesn't feel there yet. It doesn't feel ready. It feels hopeful and it feels thoughtful.

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:30.040
But my worry is that we need to take the time as it evolves, as Member Rucker says, as we learn to develop this so that when we get to our dream of full implementation of community schools surrounding and wrapping around kids, students and community and families, it is well thought out, well organized and layered and connected appropriately.

02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:44.040
So again, I support what Member Gelber-Woods talked about, about the Technical Assistance Center as the first to try to think this through. But I think we need to be very, very thoughtful. I think the words are there.

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:59.040
It right now doesn't feel clear to me how it's going to actually work right now. I think the intent is there. I see the pillars. I see the stakeholder engagement. I hear the models of existing schools, but this is transformational.

02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:20.040
And I think we learned in our last decade, this is going to take time to be thoughtful. And I want to use $3 billion thoughtfully to make the impact that was intended for this program. So again, we need to connect to the system of support to our LCAP and not make this another separate categorical.

02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:39.040
We need to have alignment and coherence. And I'm trusting the team. I know you're meeting weekly, day and night over the weekends to try to get this rolled out. And I just would encourage us to go slow so we can get what we need. And our hope for transformation really is achieved.

02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:53.040
So thank you very much. Thank you. And I'm sure there are things that the staff will want to share about some of the planning that were, you know, not in the succinct presentation. So we'll we will come back around for that.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:17:05.040
I don't know, Steve, if you feel like there's anything you want to clarify at this moment, or shall we wait until we hear all the comments?

02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:12.040
No, only to express appreciation and to reiterate what you said.

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:32.040
Okay, great. And, you know, we do have five years to implement this actually seven, because for those many, many districts that will look for planning grants, which can last for as much as two years, they'll have another five years after that to apply for and receive an implementation grant and execute it.

02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:44.040
So thankfully, we do have a framework of some places ready to roll and others that are going to take their time and a process that needs to figure out how to support both.

02:17:44.040 --> 02:17:52.040
We have next in the queue member Burr, member Sun, member Bonacca, member Rodriguez and member Patio-Bronson.

02:17:52.040 --> 02:18:05.040
Thank you, President Darlingham. And I greatly appreciate the ability to go after Eileen Strauss and Cynthia Glover Woods because they hit on a lot of the topics that I wanted to bring to your attention.

02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:16.040
And I appreciated the modeling that member Rucker provided, which is to give you some advice since we won't be here going forward.

02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:29.040
But so let me just frame what I want to say, because you've heard a lot of the tightening up of the requirements here with the LCAP, especially the dashboard and those kinds of things.

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:43.040
But I want to do a couple of specific things and just first start out by saying I really appreciated what Superintendent Thurman led with of community schools, put the school at the center of services provided to students and to their families.

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:48.040
But I think it's also important and this is where I struggle a little bit with where we are.

02:18:48.040 --> 02:18:56.040
The school is nested in a system. It's part of a district, it's part of a county, it's part of a state system.

02:18:56.040 --> 02:19:12.040
And our history being the historian here with school centered reforms has not been, it's been kind of jagged up and down and I'm sure that Mr. Zimmerer especially will appreciate this having gone through many of these in Los Angeles County.

02:19:12.040 --> 02:19:23.040
So I just think it's important to sort of think about that again, that schools don't exist in isolation, they exist in this much bigger universe, if you will.

02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:41.040
So I just, and to that end, right, the system that the district is being held accountable for by the state and ultimately by the federal government is our local control accountability plan, all of the dashboard indicators, etc.

02:19:41.040 --> 02:19:59.040
So I really encourage us not to, to be very cautious about deviating from that, except in those instances where it might be critical and necessary for the school, but still keeping in mind the additional burden that might be putting on the LEA.

02:19:59.040 --> 02:20:14.040
And there's just a couple of things. I know we're talking about the framework and I will add my voice to the chorus of people who congratulate the staff, both the department staff and the board staff on the progress we've made from our first conversation.

02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:24.040
But there are still, there are a couple of things in the actual item that really kind of caught my attention. One of them has to do with the accountability piece.

02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:33.040
I'm not on the wrong piece of paper here, but I'm going to model what Mike Chris said about me. I do read every word and every page.

02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:41.040
It's actually in the item itself where there's an accountability piece, and it talks about school outcomes.

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:58.040
And my concern again is that we don't want to set up a system where we're setting up different outcomes for community schools or additional outcomes which are burdensome potentially on community schools that don't exist and don't provide comparable information across the system.

02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:06.040
So I would just encourage you to look carefully at that and think about that and how that works.

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:22.040
There's also, I guess there's a comment in the framework which also caught my attention and for all of my colleagues here who worked so diligently on the instructional quality commission that says that community schools will design their own curricula.

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:34.040
And that made me go, whoa, because again, our system has been built for many years on consistent standards, on consistent frameworks, on consistent curriculum guidance.

02:21:34.040 --> 02:21:51.040
So if it's necessary again for the community school to be successful, I think we need to think carefully about that. And again, how does that fit into the bigger system as it relates to what our expectations are for all schools and districts in California?

02:21:51.040 --> 02:22:14.040
And I would just say this is my advice to board members. If I were still going to be here, I would really want to have a tight connection between the board approval even potentially of the RFA or at a minimum board memos that are describing it because as everyone said, and I commend folks who are working their best to learn this, this is a very new endeavor.

02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:28.040
And nobody has all the answers yet as member Rucker articulately said, but I think the board has an important role to keep on top of this as you go along. So I just want to be clear about where the board touch points.

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:38.040
Is it on the RFA? Is it only on the grant awards? And just be thoughtful about that as you move forward. Thank you.

02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.040
Thank you.

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:41.040
Member Sun.

02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:51.040
Hey, so I'm going to continue picking at many of the points that have been brought up that maybe just add a little bit more layering to it.

02:22:51.040 --> 02:23:04.040
One is, it's also want to thank the staff for flushing out the framework and the design of the community schools. I think that was really, really well done and appreciate the work that went into it.

02:23:04.040 --> 02:23:17.040
I want to pick up on the point of coherence. Having Governor Brown and Mike Kirst here earlier today reminds us of the work that was started and the promise to continue that work.

02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:35.040
And therefore everything for coherence sake to be grounded in the LCFF LCAP process that we develop where there is the community input, parents, students, teachers, the results analysis, strategic planning, continuous improvement.

02:23:35.040 --> 02:23:45.040
All those pieces need to be the grounding from which any initiative, including this community schools initiative should begin.

02:23:45.040 --> 02:24:12.040
And just a little bit kind of a lessons learned from the charter world. A couple of things is as you embark on this wonderful vision of creating these schools to attend to the organizational, legal and regulatory barriers that you may very well run into in designing kind of new, brand new schools.

02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:29.040
And it could be anywhere from a archaic Ed code that does not is no longer relevant or regulation that had unintended consequences for block bearing barriers or blockage to to creating something different and innovative.

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:47.040
And because of this, I really encourage some kind of a research documentation process as we embark on this initiative and not just in tracking what worked, but what did not work.

02:24:47.040 --> 02:25:03.040
I think those that's part of that continuous improvement process and in whether this this this technical assistance center or what it might be, but that there be a research and a real kind of analysis portion of this initiative.

02:25:03.040 --> 02:25:19.040
And the last two piece that has also been brought up is around the goals and the outcomes. And we know from having reviewed lots of charters and charters coming up for renewal and all that five years is a charter.

02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:36.040
And so we're we seem to like to set that five year mark, but we also know that without clarity of outcomes and what the expectations are when that fifth year comes up, well, we're not quite sure what to do and where to go.

02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:50.040
So I think, you know, attending that again, kind of lessons learned from looking at the what we've done with with charter schools could help with making this initiative successful.

02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:56.040
Okay, thank you. Member Vinaka.

02:25:56.040 --> 02:26:16.040
Thank you. First of all, I, of course, want to thank the CD staff and Superintendent Thurman for all of the work put into this framework. In particular, I really appreciate the continued effort to involve the input of educational partners in the development of this framework, especially in terms of student input.

02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:30.040
As I've said before, I think that making sure that there is significant emphasis placed on student engagement is crucial because students at the end of the day are going to be most affected by these decisions.

02:26:30.040 --> 02:26:42.040
And so it only makes sense that their voices should be heard accordingly. And so I trust that we will continue to meaningfully engage students in every step of the decision making process.

02:26:42.040 --> 02:26:55.040
My only suggestion for the framework lies in the second pillar of the four pillars of community schools. I would like to see student engagement explicitly mentioned in this pillar.

02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:11.040
I think that unless we're really explicit about student voice and actually listening to that student voice, I worry that students can easily be brushed over, especially in conversations and meetings that are mostly led and populated by adults.

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:19.040
I know that I've experienced this many times at the personal level, and I'm sure many, many other student leaders share that same experience.

02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:27.040
And so I just think being more explicit will just help emphasize the importance that students will play in shaping their own education.

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:33.040
And I think we can all agree on the importance of this. But all in all, I'm really excited to see this investment play out.

02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:44.040
I know that it really directly addresses so many of the concerns that I've heard from students about the achievement gap. And so I'm really excited to see it all play out.

02:27:44.040 --> 02:27:48.040
Thank you. Member Rodriguez.

02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:58.040
Yes, thank you. And I also want to acknowledge Superintendent Thurman, CDE, for all of the work that has been done since our last meeting.

02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:16.040
I would have liked to have seen a little more information, more detailed information about the RFA at this point, only because we do have one more meeting before, right when we start looking at approving this according to what we spoke about in October.

02:28:16.040 --> 02:28:35.040
And I just feel with everything that's happening at school sites right now, we are under a lot of pressure and everybody, you know, one day we're counting on somebody, the next day they're out quarantining, right, because maybe they tested positive.

02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:52.040
And so we're we just have a lot of there's a lot of unknown right now. So as as quickly as this could be done, I would appreciate it because it'll be less pressure for for our sites and for it to be successful.

02:28:52.040 --> 02:29:10.040
And also, you know, I'm not going to repeat what everybody else said, because the comments were wonderful. And I just want to acknowledge our the people who called in and wrote our partners, our educational partners, because there were some very valid points regarding

02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:38.040
Making sure that there there are clauses or or caveats in place that community schools won't be won't have a punitive component. And for policing or things of that nature for our students, right, we want to make sure that it's a place where our students are, are built up and where they're the resources are there to support them.

02:29:38.040 --> 02:29:57.040
Also, as a teacher with a very active bargaining unit. I like the idea of having there be an mo you and have input where applicable right that would be aware applicable because not all school sites have bargaining units, but I think that that's very important for the buy in.

02:29:57.040 --> 02:30:17.040
And especially for the teacher voice if there isn't a union within the school site. And I also want to acknowledge the work that you know our caller Martha done this mentioned right which was the the crosswalk that they created for

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:27.040
The language right, especially with our focus on by literacy and perhaps taking another look at that as we're going through this process.

02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:48.040
And I just want to acknowledge Sue I chuckled a little bit when you were talking about the curriculum, because that is something that stood out for me, but in a different way because of my experience at East Palo Alto High School where we created curriculum using you know college prep standards for

02:30:49.040 --> 02:31:02.040
Students based on the community that they were in right so their freshman year they were studying psychology sociology political philosophy, but they were using the lens within their community so they were examining their community.

02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:17.040
And that's what stood out for me when I saw that because I thought this is so much of what I like to do with my students have them learn the content and be able to examine their community and where they are and how it affects them.

02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:20.040
So anyway, with that, thank you.

02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:22.040
Thank you.

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:25.040
And member Patia Bronson.

02:31:25.040 --> 02:31:38.040
I will join the chorus of thank yous to the superintendent for all of the clear thought and work that has gone into this and progress as well as to Steve Zimmer for the presentation.

02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:43.040
I think I'll just align myself with a number of the comments I think that were made earlier.

02:31:43.040 --> 02:31:48.040
I'll start with the student engagement piece that board member Banaka lifted up.

02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:58.040
I'm thinking about this piece of lifting up student engagement also in the context of some of our prior conversations around civic engagement and civic learning.

02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:08.040
And there's few better opportunities for students to actually engage in shaping what their lives look like than affecting what their schools look like.

02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:18.040
And I think this is a real opportunity to lift up student voice to invite student voice and to center it in a different sort of way.

02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:27.040
In addition, I'll also align myself with the comments earlier from board or board vice chair Glover Woods.

02:32:27.040 --> 02:32:37.040
It has a fun ring to it around the importance of by literacy, integrating the EL roadmap.

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:42.040
And lastly, and this will be no surprise to any anyone here.

02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:45.040
Early education being integrated.

02:32:45.040 --> 02:33:02.040
I think community schools around the country have done really exciting work in terms of getting ahead of achievement gaps by building in community based partnerships for the full of zero to five, not necessarily always school districts offering it directly,

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:11.040
but really making sure that that early education pipeline is a part of the community schools offering.

02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:22.040
I think Steve mentioned or offered this idea that this is ultimately an equity initiative that is aiming to transform outcomes.

02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:33.040
And I think all of that would bolster that process, whether that goes into RFA guidance document, I think is something to in the TBD category.

02:33:33.040 --> 02:33:42.040
But it needs, I think, to be part of what school districts are encouraged to think through as they start to tailor the programming.

02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:45.040
Thanks.

02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:51.040
So I think we've heard from everyone who had their hand raised.

02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:52.040
I'm just double checking.

02:33:52.040 --> 02:34:04.040
I want to just add a small comment as I pass the ball back to Steve Zimmer and Superintendent Thurman for any clarifications that you'd like to make before we take up the motion.

02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:20.040
One of them is, I think, probably many of us assume that families include students, but there's been a lot of recognition that we want to be sure that the student voice is understood to be included in that context.

02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:27.040
The other just small comment is I'm thinking about the many ways in which the term curriculum is used.

02:34:27.040 --> 02:34:33.040
At sort of one level, there are sort of curriculum goals and curriculum frameworks, which we do adopt at this date.

02:34:33.040 --> 02:34:46.040
And then at the level of the school and classroom teacher, there are curriculum decisions being made all the time of the sort that member Rodriguez was talking about is used at many levels.

02:34:46.040 --> 02:35:08.040
I understood it in your framework to be really the decisions that are made appropriately within our curriculum frameworks, et cetera, at the school and classroom level to bring the curriculum to the child and the child to the curriculum, so to speak, as John Dewey put it.

02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:22.040
So you may want to clarify if that is if we've understood things in the way that you intended them, and I'll turn it back to you for any further clarifications and comments before we take up a motion.

02:35:22.040 --> 02:35:27.040
Thank you so much to all of the board members.

02:35:27.040 --> 02:35:32.040
Deeply appreciate the comments and I'll start.

02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:35.040
I'll start President Darling-Hammond, you're absolutely right.

02:35:35.040 --> 02:35:54.040
It has to do with those with that, you know, that those decisions, those instructional decisions, the relevance at the school, at the school site and the school community within the context of the framework.

02:35:54.040 --> 02:36:23.040
I referenced board member Rodriguez's comments about how, you know, really with with listening and shared decision making, we, we, you know, through that listening and co-learning, we're able to create classrooms within the context of the state curricular framework that really honor and uplift the experience of our students and their families and their community.

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:34.040
But also, you know, help to include our students in the process of building that learning environment and ensuring that relevance.

02:36:34.040 --> 02:36:37.040
So thank you for that clarification.

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:46.040
And I just, again, as I said at the beginning, we really do see ourselves as co-learners in this process.

02:36:47.040 --> 02:37:11.040
And this has been, this is like advanced placement co-learning for me with all with all of you and I, and I really, I really, I know our whole team, Pete, Deanna, Lisa, and myself and all the rest of our team really appreciate all the comments and the feedback and the wisdom that you've shared.

02:37:11.040 --> 02:37:18.040
I just want to highlight and clarify a couple of things and then turn it back to the superintendent.

02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:36.040
One is that we really do appreciate the coherence and alignment points and conversations that points and feedback that has been given and want to continue, I think, to address.

02:37:36.040 --> 02:38:05.040
Board member Strauss' comment and honesty, yes, we need to bring this from hope into action and make sure that these conversations that I referenced, solidifying the ways that it was very clear that the board members expect that and that is our priority on building into this because we don't want this to be something that's layered on top.

02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:18.040
We see this as fully aligned and integrated and we'll take the necessary steps to continue to elevate it and make it from hope to real.

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:40.040
And I also just want to highlight and I think the board president did a great job of this, we do need to continue to emphasize student voice and to call out student voice specifically.

02:38:40.040 --> 02:38:56.040
We did see that both as encompassed in family and there are many points in the framework where students are in that communal list.

02:38:56.040 --> 02:39:12.040
I really appreciate board member Bonacca and board member Petula Brunson elevating that and that has been where our heart has been, that just needs to be, again, elevated and actualized.

02:39:12.040 --> 02:39:25.040
And I'll just stop there and say that all of these comments and all of this input is greatly appreciated.

02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:40.040
We will communicate back on certain specific points and I know that these key elements that you brought up will help to guide us moving forward.

02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:48.040
With that, I want to hand it back to the superintendent again with our great thanks for the learning and the wisdom that you shared today.

02:39:48.040 --> 02:39:59.040
Thank you, Mr. Zimmer. Thank you, Madam President and members of the board for what I call gifts. You've given us gifts of thought or as it was placed today, advice.

02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:09.040
And we thank you for that, board member Rucker and Burr and Son and others who have given advice for how this might move forward.

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:22.040
I think as President Darling-Hammond has suggested, community schools is not completely new. It is something that California has a very rich and robust tradition in history in implementing.

02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:31.040
It is true. We are looking at how it is implemented in schools in some new ways, in ways that it can have more transformative effects.

02:40:31.040 --> 02:40:40.040
It is not in any way intended to replace what exists and we actually are very appreciative of the call for looking for continuity, for cohesion.

02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:53.040
There have been many conversations that have taken place in earnest amongst the various divisions and branches at the Department of Education about how does community schools connect to the important work that's been established by the systems of support and LCAP.

02:40:53.040 --> 02:41:00.040
And we will continue to have those conversations with school leaders about how do we help to make those connections.

02:41:00.040 --> 02:41:18.040
I also want to acknowledge that we have heard the feedback that many of you have heard. You pointed it out, board member Burr and others, that schools feel like everything is just falling down on them in terms of opportunities and requirements and it is difficult to balance.

02:41:18.040 --> 02:41:31.040
And we have given a great deal of thought to how community schools can be a resource and how do we implement it in a way where it doesn't feel like one more thing that they have to do because it is more than that.

02:41:31.040 --> 02:41:44.040
It is a powerful resource. As someone who has had a chance to work for community schools and help start full service community schools districts like our board president, we know that it is actually a critically desired resource that our school districts want.

02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:57.040
And so we have been in conversation with school leaders about how it gets implemented to not feel like it's just a laundry list of things that they now have to carry out.

02:41:57.040 --> 02:42:11.040
And if we have it available, there is a graphic that I'd like to share with the board that shows how we've been thinking about community schools in relation to many of the other programs that are coming to our schools like universal TK and universal meals.

02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:25.040
And if we have the graphic, I'd like to show it, but just know that that is how we're thinking about community schools as, yes, we see it as a centerpiece to helping students to heal and to recover and to thrive.

02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:30.040
But we also see is connected to many of the important programs that have been laid out.

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:37.040
And we will continue to have those conversations about how we support the implementation of community schools.

02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:44.040
And I also just want to say thank you, Board Member Bonanca and Patil Bronson for lifting up the importance of student voice.

02:42:44.040 --> 02:42:49.040
We will continue to ensure that there is meaningful student voice and participation at every level.

02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:54.040
We have some meetings that are scheduled where there will be high level student participation.

02:42:55.040 --> 02:43:01.040
We know that the RFA will speak to many of the concerns that we heard from some of the callers.

02:43:01.040 --> 02:43:08.040
And we agree that community schools should never be used to support any hardening kind of resources or use of law enforcement.

02:43:08.040 --> 02:43:19.040
There will be clarity in many ways in the RFA about things that really are not intended to be part of community schools and clarity about what community schools in fact is.

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:24.040
And you are helping us on that very first step with today's framework conversation.

02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:26.040
So with that, we want to say thank you for the feedback.

02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:31.040
As Board Member Rucker says, it's always a chance to learn new information.

02:43:31.040 --> 02:43:43.040
But we're going to be working to build off of California's very robust tradition that already exists in community schools and how to use this opportunity for this very challenging moment that our California schools are in as we speak.

02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:46.040
So thank you, Madam Board President and members of the board.

02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.040
We respectfully ask for your aye vote on this framework and moving forward.

02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:52.040
Thank you.

02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:57.040
I did not see that very wonderful graphics show up.

02:43:57.040 --> 02:44:02.040
But if we don't, aren't in a position to show that this morning, we'll make sure it goes out.

02:44:02.040 --> 02:44:13.040
Perhaps in one of the next board members that goes out as we're continuing to inform the board about all the details that are going to unfold over the coming months.

02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:18.040
We do need to put up the resolution if we can again.

02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:26.040
If someone is personning the video and then we need a motion.

02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:36.040
Can I get a motion to approve the framework and the amendment to the previous administrative plan?

02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:39.040
There we go.

02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:55.040
I would like to make a motion to approve the recommendation that the State Board of Education approve the proposed CCSPP framework and the amendment to the administrative plan.

02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:57.040
Can I get a second?

02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.040
Second.

02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:01.040
Thank you very much.

02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.040
Brooks, will you call the roll for the vote?

02:45:04.040 --> 02:45:06.040

Passes unanimously.

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:44.040
All right.

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:45.040
Terrific.

02:45:45.040 --> 02:45:46.040
This is a wonderful start.

02:45:46.040 --> 02:45:48.040
Thank you so much.

02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:51.040
We have earned ourselves lunch.

02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:57.040
And we can take actually until about 1245.

02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:01.040
So we'll see you back in however many minutes that is.

02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:02.040
See you at 1245.

02:46:02.040 --> 02:46:03.040
Thank you.

02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:05.040
And remember, don't leave the meeting.

02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:09.040
Just turn off your camera and your microphone.

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:15.040
All right.

02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:16.040
Board members, welcome back.

02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:18.040
We need to reestablish a quorum.

02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:21.040
So Brooks is going to call the roll.

Item three is the California assessment of student performance and progress and the English

02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:09.040
language proficiency assessments for California.

02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:13.040

Approval of revisions to the student score reports for the California assessment of student

02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:27.040
performance and progress and the English language proficiency assessments for California.

02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:29.040
And an update on program activities.

02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:35.040
And we are encouraged to approve those amendments.

02:47:35.040 --> 02:47:40.040
And the item will be presented by Cheryl Cotton and Mal Vang of the CDE.

02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:46.040
Cheryl and Mal, please begin.

02:47:46.040 --> 02:47:50.040
Thank you and good morning.

Getting our slide up.

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:54.040
Yep.

02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.040
Thank you.

02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:58.040
Putting the slide up.

02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:30.040
Thank you.

02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:23.040
Now, do you need assistance?

02:49:23.040 --> 02:49:24.040
Thank you.

02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:29.040

Superintendent of Instruction, Measurement, and Administration branch.

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:38.040
The item before you today is an action and an information item.

02:49:38.040 --> 02:49:43.040
Next slide.

02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.040
Today's presentation will cover the following topics.

02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:53.040
We will provide an overview of CDE's recommendation for approval as well as background information

02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:56.040
on the two requested action items for today.

02:49:56.040 --> 02:50:00.040
Then we will give you some CASP and LPAC updates.

02:50:00.040 --> 02:50:06.040
And finally, we will return to the CDE's recommendation for approval.

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:10.040
Then we will give you some CASP and LPAC updates.

02:50:10.040 --> 02:50:15.040
And finally, we will return to the CDE's recommendation for SBE action.

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.040
Now, I will hand the presentation over to Mal Vang, Director of the Assessment Development

02:50:20.040 --> 02:50:22.040
and Administration Division.

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:37.040
Mal?

02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:40.040
Thank you, Cheryl.

02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:43.040
I will begin.

02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:49.040
Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, and esteemed board members, thank you, Cheryl,

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:54.040
for, as you have mentioned, I'm Mal Vang, the Director for the Assessment Development

02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:59.040
and Administration Division at the California Department of Education.

02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:04.040
I just want to let you all know that we also have Mary Ann Arcella, who is the Executive

02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:11.040
Director of K-12 Assessments at ETS, our contractor for our assessments, and Tony Alpert, who

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:15.040
is the Executive Director from the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium.

02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:19.040
I'm here to assist with questions should they arise.

02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:38.040
So I will move on to our next slide.

02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:48.040
I'm not sure why it's not moving.

02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:52.040
Which is a recommendation for approval.

02:51:52.040 --> 02:51:58.040
So the California Department, here is our recommendation for approval.

02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:04.040
The California Department of Education, or CDE, is recommending that the California State

02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:08.040
Board of Education, or SBE, approve the following.

02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:16.040
An amendment extending the contract, contract number CN170202, which would be Amendment

02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:22.040
3, that includes the current California Department of Education and the University of California,

02:52:22.040 --> 02:52:28.040
Santa Cruz, or UCSC Interagency Agreement, as well as the customization, configuration,

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:35.040
and implementation of the California Educator Reporting System, or which we also call SERS,

02:52:35.040 --> 02:52:40.040
as found in Attachments 2, 2A, and 2B.

02:52:40.040 --> 02:52:48.040
And in addition, the California also recommend that the SBE authorize the CDE and SBE staff

02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:54.040
to make any technical edits to the amendment as needed prior to its execution.

02:52:54.040 --> 02:53:03.040
The second action is the revisions to the 2021-22 Student Score Reports, or SSRs,

02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:07.040
for the California Assessment of Student Performance in Progress, or CAST,

02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:12.040
and the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, or ALPAC,

02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:18.040
as found in the samples in Attachments 3.

02:53:18.040 --> 02:53:26.040
Moving on, I will provide some background information on the CDE's recommendations for approval.

02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:38.040
Beginning with the background on California's, or CDE's, and also the University of,

02:53:38.040 --> 02:53:42.040
sorry, excuse me, I'm just going to see if I can move this over a little bit.

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:51.040
Background on the CDE and the UC Santa Cruz Contract Amendment.

02:53:51.040 --> 02:53:58.040
The California membership in the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium

02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:05.040
does include, or includes, the use of the Consortium's Educator Reporting System.

02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:10.040
The House results from the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments

02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:16.040
and Summative Assessments for English Language Arts and Literacy, and Mathematics.

02:54:16.040 --> 02:54:24.040
So in November 2018, the SBE approved an amendment to that interagency agreement

02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:27.040
with the UC, or the University of California Santa Cruz,

02:54:27.040 --> 02:54:34.040
to include the customization, configuration, and implementation of the Educator Reporting System

02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:40.040
for all CASP results, as well as the summative ALPAC results.

02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:48.040
So at that time, it was done in that way.

02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:54.040
So the reporting system is now, as we call it, the California Educator Reporting System.

02:54:54.040 --> 02:55:00.040
And this current contract, which includes it, along with the interagency agreement,

02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:05.040
is set to expire on June 30, 2022.

02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:11.040
So this contract has really strengthened California's online assessment system

02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.040
by providing this one single source for local educational agency staff

02:55:16.040 --> 02:55:22.040
to access individual and aggregate student results from not only the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessments,

02:55:22.040 --> 02:55:27.040
as I mentioned, for English and Math, and also the summative assessments for English and Math,

02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:34.040
but also our California Science Test, the California Alternate Assessments for English, Math, and Science,

02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:40.040
and the California Spanish Assessment, as well as the summative ALPAC.

02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:46.040
So approval of the scope of work within this amendment will allow for the extension

02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:53.040
of the California Department of Education and University of California Santa Cruz interagency agreement,

02:55:53.040 --> 02:56:00.040
as well as that ongoing customization, configuration, and implementation of the California Educator Reporting System

02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:08.040
through June 30, 2027.

02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:26.040
My computer is a little sticky, so excuse the delay.

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:39.040
Somehow it's not.

02:56:39.040 --> 02:56:48.040
So please note that there is a credit from the University of Santa Cruz

02:56:48.040 --> 02:56:54.040
contract in the amount of 3.9 million that is being applied to this amendment.

02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:03.040
The consortium membership credit was due largely to the summative testing being suspended in the 2019-20 school year

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:15.040
due to the impact of the COVID pandemic and the SBE approval of the adjusted version of the test in the 2021 to be used.

02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:22.040
So the proposed amendment will increase the overall contract with the University of California Santa Cruz

02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:37.040
by $51,733,335 from fiscal years 2022-2023 through June 30, 2027.

02:57:37.040 --> 02:57:50.040
So the total amount would be the $102,032,555 as found in the details in Attachment 2B.

02:57:50.040 --> 02:58:05.040
So any funding or the funding for the 2022-2023 school year and beyond or fiscal years and beyond will be contingent on an annual appropriation being made available from the legislature.

02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:18.040
Next, I will transition to the second action provided and provide background on the revisions to the student score reports or SSRs for each state assessment.

02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:28.040
And on an annual basis, they are reviewed by the State Board of Education and approved by the State Board of Education.

02:58:28.040 --> 02:58:38.040
So the proposed revisions, although minor, they are necessary to reflect the most recent updates to test administration,

02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:48.040
as well as to ensure that the key information regarding student performance is communicated clearly to parents and guardians.

02:58:48.040 --> 02:58:53.040
I'll start with the CAS, the student score report revisions.

02:58:53.040 --> 02:59:02.040
So in order to reflect those recent changes and communicate clearly to parents, we found that some things may be confusing given the changes.

02:59:02.040 --> 02:59:13.040
So we're proposing the following revisions to the 2020 from the 2021 CAS SSRs.

02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:21.040
So it is we're recommending that the school and state averages be removed from each of the CAS SSRs.

02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:28.040
These averages were really historically have been based on a rolling average from the previous three years.

02:59:28.040 --> 02:59:38.040
So the suspension of testing in the 2019-20 school year and with the low testing volumes in the 2020-21 school year,

02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:50.040
that really impacted the calculation of these three year rolling averages to the extent that it would not provide parents and guardians information or informative reference

02:59:50.040 --> 02:59:58.040
to compare 2021-22 student performance, I mean, 2020-21 student performance.

02:59:58.040 --> 03:00:04.040
So due to the use of the adjusted blueprint, again, for the Smarter Balanced Assessments,

03:00:04.040 --> 03:00:14.040
another thing is that the student claim levels or claim reporting categories or results will not be available on the student score report.

03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:26.040
So the language here indicate there's language indicating that this has been updated to remove reference to that year, the 2019-20 school year.

03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:36.040
So and then in addition, one year of score history has been added to the California Spanish Assessment Report.

03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:50.040
An additional technical edit has also been made to the location of what we would call an asterisk or footnote to add more clarity, to improve the clarity on that footnote.

03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:55.040
So that these are the revisions to the CAS reports.

03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:05.040
And then for the LPAC, the California English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, the revisions are technical in nature.

03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:13.040
And these are proposed for the 2021-22 school summative LPAC in which we are in right now.

03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:28.040
So because the alternate LPAC is now operational, there was a footnote indicating on the summative LPAC SSRs that a local alternate assessment was administered,

03:01:28.040 --> 03:01:37.040
as such that asterisk and the footnote will be removed from the student score report specifications.

03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:42.040
Another technical edit is proposed to update.

03:01:42.040 --> 03:01:55.040
There is a double asterisk indicating the use of an unlisted resource because the asterisk and the footnote regarding that administration of the local assessment above would not be applicable.

03:01:55.040 --> 03:02:00.040
The double asterisk should only be one, so we're making that change as well.

03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:12.040
So next, the CDE proposes the addition of a couple tax sections.

03:02:12.040 --> 03:02:26.040
We're proposing the addition of adding a little blurb about the incomplete tests, no score available, and eligible but not tested in the score history section,

03:02:26.040 --> 03:02:35.040
really to provide clarity and specificity for parents and guardians regarding why a score is not indicated in their child's LPAC history.

03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:44.040
So previously, this section indicated only no score available, which did not provide parents and guardians with sufficient information.

03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:59.040
So finally, other than the school year, there are no proposed changes to the initial LPAC student score report or the alternate LPAC student score report for 2021-22.

03:02:59.040 --> 03:03:16.040
The initial LPAC student score report received approval from the State Board of Education in January 2020, and the alternate LPAC student score report received approval in November of 2020.

03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:28.040
So samples of the student score reports for each California assessment with all the proposed revisions where applicable are included in attachments three.

03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:33.040
This includes the sample Lexile Quantile Measures reports as well.

03:03:33.040 --> 03:03:48.040
Other than the year, they were first released in the spring of 2021, and other than the year, we're not proposing any changes at this time.

03:03:48.040 --> 03:04:09.040
So now I would like to share some program updates with you regarding the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, as well as the English Language Proficiency Assessments for California, starting with the CASP or statewide testing windows.

03:04:09.040 --> 03:04:29.040
So as we sit here, the window opened yesterday for the majority of the CASP assessments. It opens on January 1st. This is the statewide testing window, and it goes through July 15th, 2022 for the majority of the test components that are under CASP,

03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:44.040
with the Smarter Balanced Summary of Assessments for English and Math, the California Science Test, the California Alternate Assessments for English and Math, and I will note on the Science Test, and then the California Spanish Assessment.

03:04:44.040 --> 03:05:02.040
And for the California Alternate Assessment for Science, its testing window really opened on September 2021 through the last day of instruction for a particular local educational agency or July 15th, 2022, whichever comes first.

03:05:02.040 --> 03:05:13.040
So local educational agencies have the majority of the school year to administer the California Alternate Assessment for Science.

03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:40.040
Okay, so another key program update I'd like to share with you is that we are in the process of working on a Smarter Balanced Demonstration Concept Study, and this is a partnership really with Smarter Balanced as well as the new teacher center.

03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:57.040
And we are conducting a demonstration of concept study to examine how the performance task can be incorporated into classroom instruction to support students and learning.

03:05:57.040 --> 03:06:19.040
So some of the key components of the study include embedded professional learning for teachers and administrators, administration of the Smarter Balanced Interim Assessment Performance Task, or key ones, which include classroom support activities.

03:06:19.040 --> 03:06:34.040
And then we will gather data and information and analyze insights from teachers and students to better understand their experiences using these performance tasks as part of the study.

03:06:34.040 --> 03:06:49.040
So a team of CDE's Assessment Development and Administration staff contributed to the development of the materials along with the Smarter Balanced and the new teacher center.

03:06:49.040 --> 03:07:02.040
And the professional learning sessions are really for the participation of participating local educational agencies, and that will start this month.

03:07:02.040 --> 03:07:18.040
And just to recap, there was a little bit of an update since our item went out. We will now only have two California local educational agencies participating in this study.

03:07:18.040 --> 03:07:29.040
And those are Val Verde Unified School District and Upper Lake Unified School District, as well as the state of Hawaii, and they have a school district participating.

03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:40.040
Remember, we are part of a larger consortium, so initially the state of Washington was expected to participate as well, but at this time they cannot do so.

03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:50.040
So we will bring forward any updated activities to you later this spring.

03:07:51.040 --> 03:08:04.040
And then some updates to highlight for you about the California Science Test. As I mentioned earlier, the window for the science test also opened yesterday.

03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:13.040
A key update that I wanted to share with you is really the revised blueprint is being implemented this year.

03:08:13.040 --> 03:08:34.040
The CAS revised blueprint, the SBE approved it in January 2020, but due to the COVID pandemic and we had brought to you that previous forms were being continued to use because it wasn't the best to switch test forms in the middle of a pandemic.

03:08:34.040 --> 03:08:52.040
So with the revised blueprint, students are now receiving fewer test questions overall, and they are receiving a minimum of three performance tasks covering the three science domains, which are earth and space sciences, life sciences, and physical sciences.

03:08:52.040 --> 03:09:08.040
So we also have training and practice tests, along with scoring guides and annotated examples are also available on the CAS website to support students and teachers.

03:09:08.040 --> 03:09:29.040
Continuing with the science instructional resources development and placing them in the tools for teachers, the update on that is that we continue to work with California science educators to develop these instructional resources.

03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:44.040
And in total, currently we have the 55 science resources that we have been sharing with local educational agencies, and they're really focused on kindergarten through grade five.

03:09:44.040 --> 03:09:53.040
So the list of the science resources was added to this item in attachment four for your reference.

03:09:53.040 --> 03:10:17.040
In fall of 2021, the CDE worked with a small group of California science educators to develop seven new resources, and the focus of that is really for middle and high school resources, and they will also be added to the tools for teachers website.

03:10:17.040 --> 03:10:30.040
So moving on, I'm going to share the ALPAC statewide testing windows, just some ALPAC updates for you.

03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:34.040
First is the initial ALPAC that really opened in July.

03:10:34.040 --> 03:10:44.040
It was specifically July 6, but really that week of the first through June 30, 2022.

03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:55.040
It's available as students enroll, and they have a home language survey that they have a language other than English.

03:10:55.040 --> 03:11:07.040
They are to be administered the initial ALPAC within the first 30 calendar days, and it's used for that initial identification process.

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:17.040
Then we do have the alternate ALPAC that our first operational field test, remember we could not do this last year, and we postponed it to this year.

03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:39.040
So the window is open from November 1, 2021 through February 15, 2022, and then our Summit of ALPAC, the window will open on February 1, and it will open until May 31 for that administration.

03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:57.040
As in terms of the Summit of ALPAC update in preparation really for the opening of the window, because that's where the majority of our ELs will be taking the test.

03:11:57.040 --> 03:12:13.040
We have the training certification in our training site called the Moodle Training Site, and we have made some adjustments, and it really opened last fall on October 8 with a whole new look and feel.

03:12:13.040 --> 03:12:20.040
It's really based on feedback from the local educational agencies and educators from the field.

03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:48.040
There are a number of key features here in terms of making things a little bit easier to use for the field, but all of these updates have been made to assist examiners in passing the speaking calibration quizzes in order to accurately score students' speaking responses on the Summit of English Language Proficiency Assessments for California.

03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:58.040
And then the alternate ALPAC, I wanted to highlight a couple things about the alternate ALPAC for you.

03:12:58.040 --> 03:13:13.040
So we opened the window up, and it is anticipated that we will collect sufficient data for the standard setting process, which is really a key part of test development.

03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:34.040
It is set for February 22nd through 24th for kindergarten through grade two, and then February 28th through March 2nd will be for the upper grades, grades three through 12.

03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:56.040
We will have a standard setting plan to you in April, probably in the form of a SBE memorandum or information memorandum, and then in May we will come back to you and bring the proposed threshold scores for your review and consideration.

03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:01.040
And with that, I'm towards the end of my presentation.

03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:20.040
I just want to remind people that they can follow us at CDE Assessments, and they could get some of the latest updates following us on Twitter.

03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:29.040
And then before I go and turn this over back to you, Board President, I wanted to mention the revisions to the item.

03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:55.040
We did have some typos in attachment four that we updated, and the first version that we did upload was not accessible for some of the contract documents, so we did do revisions to that as well, just to recall and capture that for the public and our board members here.

03:14:55.040 --> 03:15:00.040
And with that, I'm going to stop sharing and turn it over to you.

03:15:00.040 --> 03:15:05.040
Thank you. We want to put up the public comment slide if you could do that.

03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:06.040
I apologize.

03:15:06.040 --> 03:15:09.040
That's okay. Yeah.

03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:24.040
So we'll open the phone line for public comment queue, and members of the public who wish to provide comment on this item can do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now.

03:15:24.040 --> 03:15:27.040
Perfect timing. Thank you.

03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.040
And you might want to put it in full live mode.

03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:33.040
There we go.

03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:45.040
And while we're waiting for members of the public to call it, I want to ask Member Sun if she has any initial comments before I make my comments, and then we'll see if there are clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:51.040
Member Sun.

03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:55.040
I guess she may not be back yet.

03:15:55.040 --> 03:16:01.040
She had something that came up.

03:16:01.040 --> 03:16:10.040
Okay, I'm going to then go ahead and make my comments and we'll see if there's any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

03:16:10.040 --> 03:16:22.040
First of all, I just want to thank you for all the work that has been going on to, you know, make all of these pieces line up, you know, in relation to what we've had to do during the pandemic and so on.

03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:44.040
I do want to call out for board members' attention the demonstration of concept that you talked about because it is really part of a broader set of concerns that have come about both in California and across the country about how to think about the role of state testing.

03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:57.040
We did shorten the Smarter Balanced portion of the Smarter Balanced test, the CASP, and also the CAST to make it more plausible to do end of year testing.

03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:03.040
There's been, of course, a lot of concern about how to manage testing during these times.

03:17:03.040 --> 03:17:29.040
And in the course of that, there have been conversations both here and across the country about how can we develop assessments that are giving information along the way, not just waiting for a very long set of tests at the end of the year, which is what our current compilation of assessments end up, when you add them all together, end up providing.

03:17:29.040 --> 03:17:58.040
And so this idea of taking the performance tasks, which are the longest portions of the Smarter Balanced tests and letting them be used in the classroom, embedded in an instructional context setting that teachers learn to do, making that possible so that the end of the year assessment is shorter, but also so that there's more engagement with the measurement of the standards throughout the year.

03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:17.040
And so the teachers know more about what the tasks are that students are being asked to undertake and so that they get information along the way about how students are doing is something that, you know, a number of states have been very interested in doing.

03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:39.040
There are a number of states that also have IADA grants, Innovation Authority Demonstration Act grants from the Federal Department of Education, to build curriculum-connected assessments that are often called through-course assessments that happen during the year, but are part of the ultimate scoring for the state assessment system.

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:57.040
So this is just sort of put that in context. This is part of a conversation that's going on both in California. I do want to clarify that we have not annexed Hawaii. It is still its own state, but it is also engaged in this work along with the districts in California that are doing this.

03:18:57.040 --> 03:19:13.040
I know there's great interest in Washington State and we've heard from other states as well that they will be trying to take up this evaluation of possibilities in the coming year when we're not in the middle of all the challenges that we're in the middle of right now.

03:19:13.040 --> 03:19:26.040
I'm very grateful that there are two districts that are so committed to this that they are willing to hang in there and they do have quite a large number of classrooms and teachers involved.

03:19:26.040 --> 03:19:54.040
So we'll want to hear back about the results of that effort to see what is possible to get the pros and cons and evaluation of that. And when we did work through our contract with Educational Testing Service, I know there was also conversation about the possibilities of some of the performance tasks from the science assessment also potentially being used during the school year.

03:19:54.040 --> 03:20:08.040
So this is something we'll be coming back to. I just wanted to flag it for folks so that we know that this is the beginning of an ongoing conversation and appreciate all the work that you and others have done in that regard.

03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:16.040
Are there any clarifying questions from the board before we turn to public comment?

03:20:16.040 --> 03:20:20.040
And let me just make sure that I'm not missing anyone.

03:20:20.040 --> 03:20:25.040
I'm not seeing any clarifying questions, so I think we can go to public comments. Do we have public commenters?

03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:32.040
Yes, we do. There are currently nine people signed up for public comment. I will open the phone line now.

03:20:32.040 --> 03:20:43.040
Good afternoon, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:52.040
Good afternoon, caller.

03:20:52.040 --> 03:20:56.040
Good afternoon, caller.

03:20:56.040 --> 03:21:02.040
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

03:21:02.040 --> 03:21:05.040
Hi, this is Christina Salazar with Californians Together.

03:21:05.040 --> 03:21:14.040
We appreciate the work of the board and the department to provide a stacked version of CAS in Spanish for bi-literacy programs and bi-literate students.

03:21:14.040 --> 03:21:23.040
This board item presents some important valuable new resources to enhance the assessment and new supports for students being assessed and for teachers to prepare their students.

03:21:23.040 --> 03:21:32.040
We would like the board to advise the department to begin the process for developing these resources in Spanish and, if needed, seek funding to support the work.

03:21:32.040 --> 03:21:39.040
We're requesting that the department submit the budget request for assessments that these be embedded in the request from the department.

03:21:39.040 --> 03:21:47.040
Without these equal supports, it puts the students taking the CAS in Spanish at a disadvantage to those taking the assessment in English.

03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:49.040
Thank you very much.

03:21:49.040 --> 03:21:55.040
Thank you.

03:21:55.040 --> 03:22:02.040
Good afternoon. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:08.040
Good morning, Ruth Barajas, or good afternoon, rather. Good, Ruth Barajas from Californians Together.

03:22:08.040 --> 03:22:19.040
In the spring of 2021, a valuable professional learning opportunity was offered for coordinators and teachers on the use of the Lexile Framework for Reading and the Lexile and Quantile Hub tools.

03:22:19.040 --> 03:22:31.040
We urge the department to conduct this session for bilingual teachers administering the California Spanish assessment and provide the tools and resources in Spanish to support the use of Spanish literature rated Lexile levels.

03:22:31.040 --> 03:22:41.040
And so what we, along with this, along with our letter, we've attached a sample list, a resource list, for your reference.

03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:50.040
We also noticed that for all different assessments in the first question on the student report form is the definition for parents, like what is the LPAC?

03:22:50.040 --> 03:22:58.040
That question helps parents understand the content and purpose of the assessments. However, on the initial LPAC, that question is not included.

03:22:58.040 --> 03:23:04.040
And we brought this to the attention of CDE staff, and we understand that this could be a technical change after the approval of the item.

03:23:04.040 --> 03:23:08.040
So we ask that you please support this technical change and approval of this item.

03:23:09.040 --> 03:23:11.040
Thank you, caller. Your time is up.

03:23:11.040 --> 03:23:13.040
Thank you.

03:23:15.040 --> 03:23:20.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:35.040
Caller, with the last four digits, 3582, you are live and you may start your public comment now.

03:23:36.040 --> 03:23:42.040
Oh, hello. My name is Diana Thompson, and I'm an elementary public school teacher and a member of CASE.

03:23:42.040 --> 03:23:50.040
Science must be on the dashboard right along beside ELA and math this year. In my experience, science is not taught in the elementary classrooms.

03:23:50.040 --> 03:23:53.040
The priority is ELA and math since they are on the dashboard.

03:23:53.040 --> 03:24:01.040
It is critical for science education to be valued and taught in grades TK through 16 so we can prepare our students for jobs for the future.

03:24:01.040 --> 03:24:03.040
Medical technology and engineering.

03:24:03.040 --> 03:24:09.040
Assessment is critical, but if the assessment data is not visible to all, then it will not be valued nor recognized.

03:24:09.040 --> 03:24:15.040
Educators, parents, and students need the data on the dashboard so they can ensure equity for all students.

03:24:15.040 --> 03:24:22.040
Science must be on the dashboard so there's accountability and a system of support and better planning and better results for our kids.

03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:27.040
Thank you for allowing my comments and all that you do to support science education for our students.

03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:29.040
Thank you.

03:24:30.040 --> 03:24:35.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:24:38.040 --> 03:24:43.040
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond and Board. This is Liz Guian with Public Advocates.

03:24:43.040 --> 03:24:50.040
I want to underscore a concern from the comments by the LCFS Equity Coalition.

03:24:50.040 --> 03:24:56.040
We are concerned with the loss of some of the information in the CASE assessment report.

03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:04.040
We think it will be more difficult for students and parents to put a student's scores in context without some of the comparison information.

03:25:04.040 --> 03:25:19.040
We think that there has, well, that information is really useful and we expect that in the upcoming testing we're going to, it will be even more relevant because there will be some decline.

03:25:19.040 --> 03:25:36.040
We also want to underscore, I want to underscore, reinforce what my colleagues in California together just testified to by adding the Luxile and Quantile scores to the report.

03:25:36.040 --> 03:25:42.040
And also by making clear on the student report form the purposes.

03:25:42.040 --> 03:25:45.040
Thank you, Cully. Your time is up.

03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:55.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:26:07.040 --> 03:26:12.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:26:12.040 --> 03:26:23.040
Good afternoon, Jessica Falco calling in on behalf of Children Now, specifically relative to the student score report.

03:26:23.040 --> 03:26:30.040
These student reports, students and parents and guardians are seeking context to better understand how their students are doing.

03:26:30.040 --> 03:26:34.040
Unfortunately, the proposed reports take a step in the wrong direction.

03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:41.040
Specifically, the planned reports would eliminate two key reference points for the student scores, school average and state average.

03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:56.040
In addition, there is a missed opportunity to report at the same time on a student's Lexile and Quantile scores, adding additional context as well as access to resources relative to these combined reference points.

03:26:56.040 --> 03:27:04.040
We recommend that the board restore the school and state averages as well as incorporate Lexile and Quantile scores to these reports.

03:27:04.040 --> 03:27:12.040
Further, in September, the board took action to shorten the language arts and math assessments for the Spring 2022 administration.

03:27:12.040 --> 03:27:22.040
To date, there have been mixed messages that we have received about whether this is a one-time change or a permanent shift because the shortened tests are less-

03:27:22.040 --> 03:27:25.040
Thank you, Cully. Your time is up.

03:27:25.040 --> 03:27:27.040
Thank you.

03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:33.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:27:34.040 --> 03:27:47.040
Caller with the last four digits of the phone number, 5085, you are live. You may start your public comment now.

03:27:55.040 --> 03:28:02.040
Okay, next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:28:05.040 --> 03:28:11.040
I'm Hope Oliver, a scientist turned secondary educator and working with CASE.

03:28:11.040 --> 03:28:20.040
I teach in earth, space, life, and physical sciences since the 1990s, days of integrated science instruction that now reach their fullest expression in the NGSS.

03:28:20.040 --> 03:28:26.040
My first-hand experiences as an early adopter of NGSS compel me to advocate for action by the board.

03:28:26.040 --> 03:28:38.040
We're a science placeholder on the dashboard, so every district will plan now to consistently direct resources towards staff training and classroom tools supporting improved performance for all students across California.

03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:51.040
Secondary, best guidance with performance class, integrating earth, space, life, and physical science, so CASE measures development of the habits of mind to ask questions and apply skills in ways connecting the three.

03:28:51.040 --> 03:28:58.040
Justice practiced by me and all who work in STEM fields. Thank you so much for considering my comments.

03:28:58.040 --> 03:29:00.040
Thank you.

03:29:00.040 --> 03:29:06.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:29:06.040 --> 03:29:18.040
Hello, this is Doug McCray, a retired educational measurement specialist from Monterey.

03:29:18.040 --> 03:29:32.040
I'd like to alert you that the attachment number two did not arrive in the public access to the public until this morning.

03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:52.040
I would suggest that any action that you take regarding the financial aspects of the relationship with the Smarter Balanced Consortium that you put off this item until the next board meeting.

03:29:52.040 --> 03:29:56.040
Thank you.

03:29:56.040 --> 03:30:03.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:30:03.040 --> 03:30:12.040
Good afternoon, President Darley Hammond and members of the Board of Education. This is Manuel Bonrostro with Californians Together.

03:30:12.040 --> 03:30:20.040
I want to call your attention to the opportunity presented in Attachment 1 that is focused on outreach and professional development.

03:30:20.040 --> 03:30:29.040
There's an opportunity here to provide needed support for teachers and analyzing student responses and inform implications for teaching and learning.

03:30:29.040 --> 03:30:36.040
We suggest that part of this professional learning include if the responses is from an EL student and at what proficiency level.

03:30:36.040 --> 03:30:43.040
The discourse and the response should be looked at not only for content knowledge but also for English language proficiency.

03:30:43.040 --> 03:30:56.040
Therefore, we urge the inclusion of this professional learning to include an analysis of the discourse of second language learners in addition to the content knowledge when hands querying constructed responses items.

03:30:56.040 --> 03:31:06.040
We also urge the department to conduct this session for bilingual teachers and also to provide tools and resources to support the use of Spanish literature rated by Lexile Level.

03:31:06.040 --> 03:31:11.040
Thank you.

03:31:11.040 --> 03:31:15.040
Your time is up. Thank you.

03:31:15.040 --> 03:31:23.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:31:23.040 --> 03:31:28.040
Good afternoon, members and members of the public.

03:31:28.040 --> 03:31:38.040
My name is Mrs. Arias and I wish to bring to your attention any injustice that are happening and occurring in the special education department.

03:31:38.040 --> 03:31:51.040
I have firsthand experience on how selfless and districts, school districts are denying special education services, especially children.

03:31:51.040 --> 03:32:05.040
Law firms are making profit in taking students into due process and many times when they decide to litigate rather than provide services or assessments.

03:32:05.040 --> 03:32:16.040
I wish to request that you suggest that selfless be audited so you can learn how much of our taxpayer dollars are being spent on litigation.

03:32:16.040 --> 03:32:20.040
Please follow us at the YouTube movement.

03:32:20.040 --> 03:32:23.040
Thank you. Sorry to interrupt.

03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:26.040
I think you would like to speak towards item number four.

03:32:26.040 --> 03:32:29.040
We are currently taking public comment for item number three.

03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:33.040
If you don't mind calling back later on in the afternoon.

03:32:33.040 --> 03:32:38.040
Certainly I will. Okay. Thank you so much.

03:32:38.040 --> 03:32:45.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

03:32:45.040 --> 03:32:49.040
I'm Peter Ahern, president of the California Association of Educators.

03:32:49.040 --> 03:32:52.040
I want to congratulate President Darling-Hammond on her re-election.

03:32:52.040 --> 03:32:58.040
I also want to thank the outgoing board members for their service and especially Eileen Strauss for being a friend to science education.

03:32:58.040 --> 03:33:05.040
I thank CDE for adding science to the Tools for Teachers resources and for exploring embedded performance tasks.

03:33:05.040 --> 03:33:14.040
Since CAS results will be on the dashboard in 2023, it's important that districts know that this is, know this as they develop their LCAP plans.

03:33:14.040 --> 03:33:18.040
Otherwise they won't plan for NGSS and science instruction in advance.

03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:27.040
We have strong evidence that most California teachers do not have NGSS aligned curriculum and haven't had adequate professional development even though the NGSS were approved in 2013.

03:33:27.040 --> 03:33:36.040
The implementation of NGSS exposed deep inequities in which many students do not have access to the science skills that set the foundation for STEM careers.

03:33:36.040 --> 03:33:41.040
We advocate for a science placeholder on the dashboard to let districts know that science results are coming.

03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:47.040
A letter detailing the suggestion was sent to the board by a coalition of California science education leaders. Thank you.

03:33:47.040 --> 03:33:54.040
Thank you. That concludes public comment for item number three.

03:33:54.040 --> 03:33:57.040
Perfect. Thank you. And member Sun has returned.

03:33:57.040 --> 03:34:06.040
And so before we get going into full board discussion, I want to give you an opportunity to offer your thoughts about this item.

03:34:06.040 --> 03:34:11.040
Yes, thank you so much. And I do apologize for coming a bit late into this item.

03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:30.040
And so first of all, I did catch your comments, President Lenny Darling Hammond, around the nationally the movement to look at assessments in a different way and how we assess student learning in a more holistic way and differently than how we have done so in the past.

03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:36.040
So I'm very excited to hear about that and hope to track that work moving forward.

03:34:36.040 --> 03:34:46.040
The other piece on this assessment item, as you see, the assessment division continues to do a lot of work during this time.

03:34:46.040 --> 03:34:53.040
And there have been a number of leadership changes and great people who have come and gone.

03:34:53.040 --> 03:35:08.040
And I just appreciate Mao and her team and the continued work that they have done in this area and recognizing character Ashley and Michelle back in touch and Rachel maves for what they have done in their contributions in the past.

03:35:08.040 --> 03:35:13.040
And now for your work, moving this team forward.

03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:22.040
And when after the board has a chance to have a discussion, I will be ready to move forward CDs recommendations.

03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:25.040
Thank you very much.

03:35:25.040 --> 03:35:32.040
There are a couple of points of clarification that emerged in the course of the caller comments.

03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:43.040
And I wonder if we could just ask Mao or Cheryl to address the plans for getting science on the dashboard and getting the test in Spanish.

03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:51.040
Those were two questions that came up.

03:35:51.040 --> 03:35:58.040
In terms of science on the dashboard, I mean, that would have to be.

03:35:58.040 --> 03:36:03.040
We should probably have Cindy Kazanis on the meeting.

03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:07.040
That's a good point. I'm addressing the questions of the wrong division.

03:36:07.040 --> 03:36:13.040
I think we were waiting till we had at least two years of data to consider that.

03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:17.040
And we are not yet at that point where we have two years of data.

03:36:17.040 --> 03:36:20.040
We may be soon.

03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:27.040
Do you address the question about whether there are plans to put the tests into Spanish?

03:36:27.040 --> 03:36:30.040
The science test or which one?

03:36:30.040 --> 03:36:34.040
I think the caller was referring to the science.

03:36:34.040 --> 03:36:43.040
Well, we have in the science, we do have the stack translations for students of the science in the item.

03:36:43.040 --> 03:36:49.040
It's one of the resource or designated supports.

03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:55.040
If a student should need stack translations, they could have that as a designated support.

03:36:55.040 --> 03:36:58.040
It doesn't change the construct of the test or anything like that.

03:36:58.040 --> 03:37:00.040
So they could access it through that.

03:37:00.040 --> 03:37:08.040
So if you have an English learner who may not have that designated support, they can have it even today.

03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:10.040
Thank you.

03:37:10.040 --> 03:37:13.040
Last clarification, I think.

03:37:13.040 --> 03:37:21.040
There was a question about why we're not reporting district and state average with scores this year.

03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:27.040
And my understanding was that because we did not have a representative sample of students,

03:37:27.040 --> 03:37:33.040
insufficient numbers taking any given test, the smarter balance test in this case,

03:37:33.040 --> 03:37:41.040
that it would be inappropriate to put averages for the state or the district in the report.

03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:45.040
Is that the correct understanding?

03:37:45.040 --> 03:37:48.040
Yes, you understand it correctly.

03:37:48.040 --> 03:37:51.040
We'll have two very lonely years.

03:37:51.040 --> 03:37:55.040
You know, the 2019-20, there was nothing there.

03:37:55.040 --> 03:38:03.040
And then even the low participation in the 2021, as we just released the results.

03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:05.040
Was it only last Friday, Linda?

03:38:05.040 --> 03:38:07.040
It was.

03:38:07.040 --> 03:38:09.040
It feels like years ago.

03:38:09.040 --> 03:38:11.040
Yes.

03:38:11.040 --> 03:38:14.040
2018-19 would be kind of lonely by themselves.

03:38:14.040 --> 03:38:18.040
And they're really rolling years of three previous years.

03:38:18.040 --> 03:38:22.040
So it doesn't even include their current, the most recent year.

03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:26.040
So we thought that would not be very informative for the families.

03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:31.040
They could also look at the public web reporting that has, you know,

03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:36.040
for as many years as they are available, if they should want to look at compared to their own school,

03:38:36.040 --> 03:38:40.040
their own district, county or state, and even grade levels.

03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:46.040
So the reference point they should be looking at in comparison would be the public web reports.

03:38:46.040 --> 03:38:48.040
All right. Thank you.

03:38:48.040 --> 03:38:52.040
Thank you. I think those are the clarification points that came to me as we were listening.

03:38:52.040 --> 03:38:57.040
Let me open up the floor to discussion from the board.

03:38:57.040 --> 03:39:04.040
And went.

03:39:04.040 --> 03:39:08.040
Member Strauss, then member Escobedo, then member Rucker.

03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:14.040
So, Mal, thank you and the team for all the work as this process continues to evolve.

03:39:14.040 --> 03:39:17.040
I just wanted to make a couple of comments.

03:39:17.040 --> 03:39:23.040
First, I recognize that last year I think we had a 24 percent student,

03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:25.040
if I read last week correctly, that took it.

03:39:25.040 --> 03:39:31.040
So I recognize that it isn't a fully reflective of really what assessment happened last year.

03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:34.040
So this year I know we're looking closely.

03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:42.040
I appreciate the effort by the leadership to continue to look at innovative opportunities to not just do a one-time test,

03:39:42.040 --> 03:39:44.040
but throughout the year.

03:39:44.040 --> 03:39:50.040
And I appreciate President Darling-Hammond's comments about our performance tasks and use of them during the year.

03:39:50.040 --> 03:39:57.040
I want to reflect quickly on science since I'm the outgoing second liaison to science.

03:39:57.040 --> 03:40:03.040
And I know all the liaison responsibilities will be reassigned once the new board members come on.

03:40:03.040 --> 03:40:10.040
But let me just say, as our science colleagues said, you know, we adopted in 2013 the standards.

03:40:10.040 --> 03:40:13.040
As we all know, the state process takes a while.

03:40:13.040 --> 03:40:17.040
So first you adopt the standards. We started with an expert panel.

03:40:17.040 --> 03:40:24.040
We had standards. It took us a year and a half to do the framework and then another year and a half or so to get aligned materials.

03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:33.040
And just as districts were piloting and looking for materials that would best meet their students' needs based on our state process, COVID hit.

03:40:33.040 --> 03:40:43.040
And so many districts never did do the final adoption and are just barely thinking about it now with all the other things that districts are thinking about.

03:40:43.040 --> 03:40:48.040
And so I don't want us to lose sight of the fact that science, we all are committed to it.

03:40:48.040 --> 03:40:52.040
We know these standards are 20 years from the last set of standards.

03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:55.040
We need them. We know a lot more about science now.

03:40:55.040 --> 03:41:04.040
And I don't want us to lose sight of how important supporting teachers and leaders and understanding the shifts in next generation science are.

03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:19.040
So what the board made a commitment under President Kirst that when we had valid and reliable data for two years, we would put it on the dashboard, but that it would be valid and reliable,

03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:25.040
which is really important to remember because we don't want to misrepresent what we're learning as we do these assessments.

03:41:25.040 --> 03:41:34.040
But I do want to remind everybody that we need to support districts as they gain back their transition, which now we're hoping will be this fall,

03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:41.040
to remembering that we need to support teachers who don't even necessarily have aligned materials to next generation science.

03:41:41.040 --> 03:41:49.040
And they are administering these assessments, but our students haven't had the ongoing experience that they deserve and need to have going forward.

03:41:49.040 --> 03:42:04.040
So I just want to raise the awareness that the materials, then the training of teachers and the implementation over time before we just test them to see what kids know and that our commitment is when we have valid and reliable data.

03:42:04.040 --> 03:42:10.040
I know there's some proposals in the letters and I trust that the CDE team with state board staff will look at that.

03:42:10.040 --> 03:42:14.040
But I want to remember that we did make that commitment going forward when we were ready.

03:42:14.040 --> 03:42:21.040
And again, I want to thank everybody. I know it's been really, really tough and I know we haven't paid attention because we haven't been able to.

03:42:21.040 --> 03:42:32.040
But as we gain more bandwidth in the next months and in the fall, I would like everyone to remember that that's still really an important element of our system.

03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:33.040
Thank you.

03:42:33.040 --> 03:42:41.040
And I remember us making that commitment and we will return to it in the coming year as we approach those conditions.

03:42:41.040 --> 03:42:44.040
Member Escobedo.

03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:50.040
Yes, well, there was only 24 percent participation rate in CAS.

03:42:50.040 --> 03:42:54.040
There was over 40 percent, I believe, in the Spanish assessment.

03:42:55.040 --> 03:43:13.040
And my wondering is right now the Lexel framework is only provided in English and wonder what the plans are to provide the same framework and those important tools in Spanish.

03:43:13.040 --> 03:43:17.040
Now, are you able to? Yes.

03:43:17.040 --> 03:43:31.040
In terms of planning for the work, of course, we're always open and willing to work with our interest holders and our local educational agency staff when there are needs.

03:43:31.040 --> 03:43:42.040
As as you know, just as someone just mentioned about the adopting the science standards years ago and we're not even having materials in students hands yet.

03:43:42.040 --> 03:43:50.040
We try to develop things as embedded into the system as much as possible.

03:43:50.040 --> 03:44:02.040
So if that is a need that we can make some adjustments to a scope or do a study, conduct a study and be able to learn from that and see how we can embed it.

03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:06.040
That's something that we're open to explore.

03:44:06.040 --> 03:44:11.040
Member Escobedo, did you have any other questions? No, that that would be it.

03:44:11.040 --> 03:44:21.040
And I want to add that it is a great need, especially when you look at the number of dual immersion programs increasing significantly throughout the years.

03:44:21.040 --> 03:44:25.040
Yeah, and we have intentions to increase them further.

03:44:25.040 --> 03:44:30.040
So member Rucker and then member Patio Bronson.

03:44:30.040 --> 03:44:31.040
Thank you very much.

03:44:31.040 --> 03:44:50.040
I want to first of all thank all the participants and interest holders and community partners who chimed in in the public comment, because there are so many things that are going on, especially as we go through this transition and we see these important shifts taking place.

03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:58.040
I want to acknowledge in particular the comments we heard from Californians together in the write up and in the attachments.

03:44:58.040 --> 03:45:14.040
The department has acknowledged the need to do some developmental work in responding to the need for enhancing the assessment tool as examples in looking at what we provide translation for and where the tools are being developed and for what purpose.

03:45:14.040 --> 03:45:22.040
But also in creating new professional learning opportunities as they negotiate new contracts to implement.

03:45:22.040 --> 03:45:31.040
And as Dr. Strauss pointed out, expand our bandwidth and our understandings in the conversations we have about assessments.

03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:38.040
Mal, I'm going to ask you a question about the three year timeline for the new ETS contract.

03:45:38.040 --> 03:45:59.040
And it's okay if you can't give the answer today, but in future presentations, I think it would be helpful for us to see where we are on the timeline of implementing that three year agreement, because that's a long arc of work and funding for the assessment process and for the changes that are contemplated in this contract.

03:45:59.040 --> 03:46:09.040
I think it would be good to have some kind of timeline in front of us so we can see where we are on the implementation mandates that were written into that contract.

03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:19.040
And I know that's not something you can give us today, but in the future, I would appreciate if that's something you could consider as part of your presentation.

03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:23.040
Thank you. Member Patio Brownson.

03:46:23.040 --> 03:46:39.040
And that was actually the primary gist of one of the questions I wanted to ask around the three year timeframe and when is the opportune moment to actually raise up some of those issues around Lexile professional development opportunities.

03:46:39.040 --> 03:47:08.040
One additional point of clarification, I just wanted to make sure that I heard correctly, we're not including the statewide average or the district wide averages because of not having the three years running, but we're only today we are voting to remove that from this particular not to remove that moving forward on an ongoing basis.

03:47:08.040 --> 03:47:19.040
I think one of the public comment speakers raised the question of whether this is a now situation based on data or if this is a this is how we're setting the stage for the future.

03:47:19.040 --> 03:47:23.040
Right now. Do you want to respond to that?

03:47:23.040 --> 03:47:38.040
Yes, this is a now situation because we don't want to, we looked at the reports and we just want to remove things that could be confusing to parents because they're just not available.

03:47:38.040 --> 03:47:41.040
Thank you.

03:47:41.040 --> 03:47:50.040
All right, I see no other hands raised. So with that, is there a motion.

03:47:50.040 --> 03:48:03.040
Yes. So first I have to correct myself. I think I said, Michelle McIntosh, and I met Michelle center. I appreciate Michelle McIntosh, but in a different area.

03:48:03.040 --> 03:48:16.040
And then the. So yes, I would like to go ahead and move the two recommendations if there's no one who objects to be moving both at the same time.

03:48:16.040 --> 03:48:34.040
All right, I had to go ahead and move both recommendations. The first one, the amendment extending the contract that includes the current CD US, UCSC interagency agreement, as well as the customization bigger configuration implementation, etc.

03:48:34.040 --> 03:48:48.040
And then the second one, the minor but necessary revisions to the 2021 22 SSRs for the CASP and the LPAC. And, and I know that this item does come up every year.

03:48:48.040 --> 03:48:57.040
So the board has annually been approving these student reports, so it will definitely come up again next year.

03:48:57.040 --> 03:49:01.040
Perfect. Wait a second.

03:49:01.040 --> 03:49:06.040
I'll second it. Thank you. Any further discussion.

03:49:06.040 --> 03:49:10.040
Hearing none, Brooks, could you call the roll for vote.

03:49:10.040 --> 03:49:12.040
Member Sun.

03:49:12.040 --> 03:49:13.040
Aye.

03:49:13.040 --> 03:49:15.040
Member Strauss.

03:49:15.040 --> 03:49:16.040
Aye.

03:49:16.040 --> 03:49:18.040
Member Rucker.

03:49:18.040 --> 03:49:19.040
Yes.

03:49:19.040 --> 03:49:21.040
Member Rodriguez.

03:49:21.040 --> 03:49:22.040
Yes.

03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:24.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:25.040
Yes.

03:49:25.040 --> 03:49:27.040
Member McQuillan.

03:49:27.040 --> 03:49:28.040
Yes.

03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:31.040
Vice President Glover Woods.

03:49:31.040 --> 03:49:32.040
Yes.

03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:34.040
Member Escobedo.

03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:35.040
Yes.

03:49:35.040 --> 03:49:37.040
President Darling Hammond.

03:49:37.040 --> 03:49:38.040
Yes.

03:49:38.040 --> 03:49:39.040
Member Burr.

03:49:39.040 --> 03:49:40.040
Aye.

03:49:40.040 --> 03:49:42.040
Member Bonacca.

03:49:42.040 --> 03:49:43.040
Aye.

03:49:43.040 --> 03:49:46.040
Motion passes unanimously.

03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:50.040
Okay. Thank you very much, Cheryl and Mal. We appreciate you.

03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:52.040
And we're going to move on to item two.

03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:53.040
Can I just say a word?

03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:54.040
Yes.

03:49:54.040 --> 03:50:00.040
Before I leave, I wanted to, I know that you had the, the celebration earlier, you probably have more.

03:50:00.040 --> 03:50:12.040
But I wanted to thank Vice President Strauss, our member Sun, Member Burr, and Member Rucker for all of their service.

03:50:12.040 --> 03:50:15.040
And the opportunity to work with you all throughout the years.

03:50:15.040 --> 03:50:20.040
I will really miss all of you and your thoughtfulness in all of our conversations.

03:50:20.040 --> 03:50:23.040
And congratulations, Linda, on your continuing role.

03:50:23.040 --> 03:50:27.040
I look forward to continue to work with you.

03:50:27.040 --> 03:50:28.040
Thank you.

03:50:28.040 --> 03:50:32.040
I'm sure everyone appreciates the good, good wishes.

03:50:32.040 --> 03:50:36.040
And with that, we'll move to item four.

03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:47.040
Item four is the State Annual Performance Report for Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 2004, covering Program Year 2020-2021.

03:50:47.040 --> 03:51:02.040
The CDE recommends that we review and approve the executive summary of the FY 2020 Annual Report Performance Report for Part B of IDEA, covering Program Year 2020-2021.

03:51:02.040 --> 03:51:05.040
The item will be presented by Heather Kalamis of CDE.

03:51:05.040 --> 03:51:12.040
And Heather will be joined by Jamie Parsons, Rhonda Marriott, and Lauren Duran from the Orange County Department of Education.

03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:23.040
And Rindy Deval from the Butte County Office of Education, who will be presenting on the California Scale Up MTSS statewide initiative as part of the state's systemic improvement plan.

03:51:23.040 --> 03:51:27.040
So, Heather, I think I see you.

03:51:27.040 --> 03:51:28.040
Please begin.

03:51:28.040 --> 03:51:29.040
Absolutely.

03:51:29.040 --> 03:51:31.040
Good afternoon.

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:50.040
And before we begin today's presentation, I would like to also thank the board members, Super, Patricia Rucker, Ting San, and Eileen Strauss for your leadership and partnership regarding how to best improve outcomes for our students with IEPs across the state of California.

03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:54.040
Your, again, guidance and leadership has been critical for our division.

03:51:54.040 --> 03:51:56.040
So, again, thank you.

03:51:56.040 --> 03:52:03.040
And we look forward to, you know, our past crossing in the future as well.

03:52:03.040 --> 03:52:12.040
During today's presentation, you will have a chance to hear how California has performed on a few key indicators of our Annual Performance Report.

03:52:12.040 --> 03:52:19.040
And we'll also have an update from our partners in Orange and Butte County, California, the California MTSS.

03:52:19.040 --> 03:52:33.040
And as a reminder, once this item is approved, the Annual Performance Report will be submitted to OSEP next month and will conclude our formal reporting cycle to OSEP for this year.

03:52:33.040 --> 03:52:41.040
Next slide.

03:52:41.040 --> 03:52:51.040
In terms of a philosophy and approach to special education, I'm often reminded of a quote or an excerpt from a book by Dr. Tom Hare.

03:52:51.040 --> 03:52:57.040
And this year, more than any other year, I've often thought about what is our purpose in special education?

03:52:57.040 --> 03:52:59.040
What are we ultimately trying to accomplish?

03:52:59.040 --> 03:53:11.040
And so Dr. Hare's message is one that doesn't spend time pathologizing disability, but one that acknowledges the barriers, yet ultimately seeks ways for students to realize their potential as a human being.

03:53:11.040 --> 03:53:23.040
And so our approach within the special education division is to ensure that our students receive those right supports, high quality instruction in a placement that is challenging, yet supportive.

03:53:23.040 --> 03:53:26.040
Next slide.

03:53:26.040 --> 03:53:30.040
We're rounding ourselves in a few numbers that you may or may not have seen before.

03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:39.040
We have seen the total population of students with disabilities has steadily a steady growth rate over time over the past 10 years.

03:53:39.040 --> 03:53:54.040
I think what's interesting about sort of seeing the trajectory of enrollment for our students across the state is the fact that while we have a population of students with disabilities that is growing, meaning more students are being identified for receiving special education supports and services,

03:53:54.040 --> 03:54:02.040
we do see a decline in overall enrollment of students in California in general.

03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:17.040
So just an interesting tidbit, in fact, and certainly something that we will be keeping our eye on and also determining better ways to, again, support, identify our students that are being identified for special education.

03:54:17.040 --> 03:54:20.040
Next slide.

03:54:20.040 --> 03:54:24.040
You've seen this slide before, I think a couple or maybe three times now.

03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:32.040
And this slide again, as you see, is highlighting students with IEPs and the LCFF.

03:54:32.040 --> 03:54:40.040
And you see within each of the pie charts are the representation of our students in each of those categories.

03:54:40.040 --> 03:54:47.040
So again, 13% of our students are also identified as being socioeconomically disadvantaged.

03:54:47.040 --> 03:54:51.040
27% being identified as a foster youth with an IEP.

03:54:51.040 --> 03:55:03.040
And then finally, there are roughly 17% of our students are duly identified as both receiving special education supports and also being identified as an English learner as well.

03:55:03.040 --> 03:55:04.040
Next slide.

03:55:04.040 --> 03:55:07.040
This one as well, you have seen before.

03:55:07.040 --> 03:55:19.040
And again, this is noting that in all of the categories in terms of LCFF, the percentage of students with IEPs that are in one or more of those categories as well.

03:55:19.040 --> 03:55:29.040
So again, a pretty good chunk of our students are also being identified in the LCFF as well.

03:55:29.040 --> 03:55:43.040
And again, just to briefly run through, the annual performance report is prepared, again, using the instructions that have been provided by OSEP at the U.S. Department of Education.

03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:47.040
This is an item that must be approved by the State Board of Education.

03:55:47.040 --> 03:55:59.040
And again, the targets that we discussed in November run from 2020 to 2025, and those were approved at the previous state board meeting in November as well.

03:55:59.040 --> 03:56:12.040
I'm now going to pass it over to Shiloh Duck and Bessie Reel, who will run through some of our highlights and some of our key performance compliance indicators, and then we'll take it from there.

03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:18.040
Good afternoon, board members. It's so lovely to virtually see you again.

03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:24.040
I'm going to, I have to, I control the slides, so I have to make sure they move in the right direction.

03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:32.040
So I'm going to be talking a little bit about the compliance indicators at first and then some of the performance indicators and the data surrounding it.

03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:39.040
Keep in mind that the majority of the data we're going to be talking about today comes from 2020-21 school year.

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:46.040
There are a couple of indicators that are also 2019-20. I will point them out as we go through them.

03:56:46.040 --> 03:57:02.040
I'm going to start with the compliance indicators. In our previous discussions of the State Performance Plan, we didn't cover the compliance indicators in too much depth, in part because the targets for those indicators are set by the U.S. Department of Education.

03:57:02.040 --> 03:57:12.040
We do have a number, about six compliance indicators. I will not be going through each one of them today, but I will be going through a number,

03:57:12.040 --> 03:57:20.040
a couple of them to highlight. They are all presented inside of the actual item itself.

03:57:20.040 --> 03:57:32.040
The first one I wanted to go over is the disproportionality, which is an indicator with a set of indicators that we look at that is tied to something called significant disproportionality.

03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:45.040
Disproportionality is identified within the Individual Disabilities Education Act, and it is a required element that states must evaluate to determine if LEAs have disproportionality.

03:57:45.040 --> 03:57:51.040
If it is consistent over a number of years, it is considered significant disproportionality.

03:57:51.040 --> 03:58:08.040
What we presented in the board item today is just the one-year disproportionality rate, and that requires districts to be identified for a number of elements, and then also to look at their policies, practices, and procedures.

03:58:08.040 --> 03:58:18.040
If a district is disproportionate over three years, they will become significantly disproportionate. What that looks like is that you have LEAs who are identified.

03:58:18.040 --> 03:58:25.040
For the first year, they should be doing a root cause analysis to determine what's happening with their disproportionality rates.

03:58:25.040 --> 03:58:43.040
The second year, they should be changing their practices, but if nothing changes in those two years, they would become significantly disproportionate, meaning there is a fiscal penalty associated with that, where we hold 15% of their Individuals with Disabilities Education Act funds,

03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:49.040
and we set it aside so that they can develop a coordinated Early Intervening Services Plan.

03:58:49.040 --> 03:59:05.040
So I did want to kind of go over that. Those items are presented in, we were not at the zero or 100%, which is the requirement for any of those indicators, but they are part of the item. We'll be able to look at them.

03:59:06.040 --> 03:59:26.040
One indicator that I did want to go over today is the indicator 12, and that is the Early Childhood Transition. So these are children who are in our infant and toddler program, which is often referred to as Part C, and then they are transitioning into the preschool program, and that's often referred to as the Part B program.

03:59:26.040 --> 03:59:35.040
And so this indicator is the Part C to Part B transition. The requirement in law is that those students make that transition by the time they're three years old.

03:59:35.040 --> 03:59:55.040
Unfortunately, due to a lot of reasons, we did have a dip in this data from the previous year. So in 2019, so this is the 1920 data, you'll find that we had 86% of students who made that transition by their third birthday, and unfortunately,

03:59:55.040 --> 04:00:11.040
in 2020-21, only 72% made that transition. Heather, do you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in that data and sort of what we sort of have learned about what we know from that sort of that change from year to year?

04:00:12.040 --> 04:00:33.040
Sure, and thank you, Shiloh. In terms of this particular indicator, you know, obviously, you can see that we did not meet that indicator. And so, you know, one thing I think to note and mention in context to indicator 12 and those transitions is that while those transitions were delayed,

04:00:33.040 --> 04:00:46.040
the three-year-olds in the Part C program were continuing to receive those Part C services, in part, thank you to the extension of the provisional services in the 2021 Budget Act.

04:00:46.040 --> 04:01:03.040
So it wasn't as if, you know, students who were sort of caught transitioning between CMB were not receiving services, they were in fact receiving extension of those Part C services as we recognized some of the challenges and strains on the system as well.

04:01:03.040 --> 04:01:25.040
And I think we're also pleased that the current proposed 22-23 Budget Act supports CDE's efforts to strengthen the transition process of young children with disabilities from that Part C program provided by the regional centers to the federal Part B programs provided by the LEAs.

04:01:25.040 --> 04:01:33.040
And in addition, the budget provides funding to ensure that parents are fully empowered and engaged to participate in the process as well.

04:01:34.040 --> 04:01:50.040
And I'm going to talk a little bit about the performance indicators. I won't go into depth too much into these indicators. You have heard about them over several Board meetings, and I know it's getting late in the afternoon, so we don't want to go over things that you've heard before.

04:01:50.040 --> 04:01:56.040
But I will talk about briefly, but I mostly will focus on the actual data that we're seeing from this year.

04:01:56.040 --> 04:02:13.040
As you know, the pathway of success measured by the annual performance report we see as our preschool LRE or school-age LRE leading into fewer rates of discipline, higher levels of statewide assessments, graduation, and better outcomes for our students with disabilities.

04:02:13.040 --> 04:02:36.040
And that sort of leads to our theory of action. I know you all saw this in the previous year, but our pillars around the work that we do in special education is around, oh, my slides are not advancing.

04:02:36.040 --> 04:02:48.040
How about now? There we go. There's always one technical difficulty. Let me go back and show you sort of our pathway of success that we had already talked about.

04:02:48.040 --> 04:03:05.040
So as you can see, success starts with getting students in the right placements, getting them the supports they need to reduce discipline, increase access to education, increase the outcomes you want to see.

04:03:05.040 --> 04:03:30.040
This is further evidenced in and inside of our theory of action that if we get students in the right placements with the right supports exposed to the high quality instruction that exists in a general education classroom, we will see a reduction in behavior problems and increased access to learning that's exhibited through our statewide assessments and then ultimately graduation and post-school outcomes that we want to see.

04:03:30.040 --> 04:03:44.040
Let's talk about what we see now for our students with disabilities in California. There are a number of performance indicators. We will not be going through every single one of them, probably to your great relief.

04:03:44.040 --> 04:03:52.040
We have selected some of them so that you can see, but they are all represented in the item. So if you would like to review them, they are there as well.

04:03:52.040 --> 04:04:09.040
One thing to note, it is noted here that there are a various number of performance indicators for indicator three. I believe there's about a hundred of them. That's one of the reasons we will not be specifically going over indicator three today, but they are all in the item.

04:04:09.040 --> 04:04:28.040
Let's start with where our path begins, which is indicator six. This is the number of students who are served and received the majority of their special education and related services inside a regular childhood program.

04:04:28.040 --> 04:04:43.040
One thing to note that's very important is this is the first year we're going to see data that does not include five-year-olds in kindergarten. In previous years, this included five-year-olds in kindergarten and in some ways inflated this number.

04:04:43.040 --> 04:05:03.040
So as you can see from the 2019 to the 2020 number, there is quite a bit of drop in both indicators 6A and 6B, and that is in part because of what we are seeing. There's also a new indicator, indicator 6C, which is the students who are served in the home setting.

04:05:03.040 --> 04:05:23.040
Indicator five has not changed with the exception that now five-year-old kindergartners are part of this indicator. As you can see, we did see a small incremental decrease in these indicators.

04:05:23.040 --> 04:05:48.040
What we would want to see is we'd want to see indicators that move downward, or 5A. I'm sorry, 5A we're going to go up and in 5B and C we're going to go downward, meaning we want to see more kids in a general education placement and fewer kids in a separate placement or in a more restrictive environment.

04:05:48.040 --> 04:06:03.040
So as you can see, 5A and 5B and C, we did see in 5B it go down, that's not the direction we want to go, and in 5B and 5C it did go down, but less than what we've seen in previous years.

04:06:03.040 --> 04:06:23.040
Indicator 4A, I did remember to tell you that there are some in these indicators that come from 2019-20. This is one of them. So this is 2019-20 data, and what we see here is the 2019 data, we see about two and a half percent.

04:06:23.040 --> 04:06:45.040
In 2020, we saw 0.5% of students who are suspended greater than 10 days in the school year. Do keep in mind, 2019-20 was a truncated data year, meaning most students were sent home and there was not adequate data tracked during that period of time to identify students who were suspended or expelled.

04:06:45.040 --> 04:06:58.040
The joke always made is I couldn't suspend my students when they were home with me. So that is one of the reasons we're not seeing that data. We do expect some changes to exist over the next couple of years.

04:06:58.040 --> 04:07:22.040
Indicator 1, graduation is also a 2019-20 data set. So one of the things you'll see is you see a very large increase of students who are graduating. I do want to note that there was a change in this calculation. In previous years, we included students who were part of the four-year adjusted cohort rate, which I believe you all are very familiar with.

04:07:23.040 --> 04:07:38.040
The U.S. Department of Education changed this indicator, and now it is a singular one-year rate. So it does take into account students who took five or six years to graduate, but it only looks at the one year. That's one of the reasons you see a pretty significant change in that set of data.

04:07:38.040 --> 04:07:59.040
Indicator 14 is sort of a three-parter. It looks at students who were enrolled within a higher education, within one year of leaving school, students who were in higher education and competitively employed within one year of leaving high school.

04:07:59.040 --> 04:08:19.040
And then 14C is students who had any post-secondary education enrollment or employment one year after high school. It's kind of a rolling indicator. So all the ones who are in 14A are also in 14B. All the ones who are in 14A and B are also in C. It's a rolling indicator.

04:08:19.040 --> 04:08:46.040
One thing to keep in mind is that this is a survey. So we sort of ask LEAs to survey students who left the previous year. So these would have been students who left in 2019-20 and then surveyed in 2021 to see if they had been enrolled in higher education, if they were competitively employed, if they had any employment or education.

04:08:46.040 --> 04:09:10.040
Now there's a lot of different ways that LEAs go about this. Some of them will actually send a paper survey. Some will use an online survey process. Some will call the students on the phone. They've used social media to identify students. There's a lot of ways that LEAs will go through this, but it is about the number of students who responded as opposed to the number of students who left. So that's something to keep in mind.

04:09:11.040 --> 04:09:36.040
So in 2020-20, we did see, so the target is 54% in 2020. We are below that, and we are also below what we saw in 2019-20, meaning that there were fewer students who were enrolled in a higher education enrollment than in the previous year.

04:09:36.040 --> 04:09:54.040
In addition to that, we also saw a drop in students who were competitively employed and or who were enrolled in a post-secondary education. I know we can sort of have a lot of discussion about that, but there is a drop that we are seeing here.

04:09:54.040 --> 04:10:11.040
And then 14C, competitively employed, enrolled in any type of post-secondary education or both, we did see, again, a decrease in this number from the previous year. We did meet our 14C result, but we did not meet our 14A and B result.

04:10:11.040 --> 04:10:34.040
And Heather, do you want to talk a little bit more about our systemic improvement plan? This is our indicator 17. In the past, this indicator has been a separate indicator that was presented in March. That is no longer the timeframe that we need to submit it to the US Department of Education. They would like it all submitted by February 1. So we're presenting it here as well.

04:10:34.040 --> 04:10:54.040
Right. Next slide, please. And so indicator 17, which is our ESSEP, as we call it. And again, I think the ESSEP, again, was developed in phases and is designed to support our statewide accountability system of system of support.

04:10:54.040 --> 04:11:14.040
And again, the goal of our state systemic improvement plan is to achieve alignment and coherence across our state and federal systems to really address those needs of our students with disabilities. And so the outcome data for the ESSEP is also assessment data.

04:11:14.040 --> 04:11:31.040
And so it would be similarly impacted as indicator three for this year. So again, we're seeing a little bit of the impact here from the ESSEP because it is largely comprised of assessment data.

04:11:31.040 --> 04:11:47.040
And again, the process data was delayed since the evidence-based practices that are part of the state systemic improvement plan could not be fully implemented by our technical assistance providers because we were not able to physically visit some of the LEAs and the school sites as well.

04:11:47.040 --> 04:11:57.040
Next slide. This one you've seen before just in terms of our overall monitoring and support for our students.

04:11:57.040 --> 04:12:18.040
And so our goal here really is to, as LEAs are identified in their annual determinations as universal supports, targeted or intensive supports, the level of support from the California Department of Education increases from the special education department and our TA providers.

04:12:18.040 --> 04:12:35.040
So here you see the shakeout of numbers in terms of our LEAs across the state. And then in the bottom right-hand corner, you see the LEAs that have been identified for differentiated assistance for student with disabilities outcomes as well.

04:12:35.040 --> 04:12:59.040
Next slide. In terms of how we, you know, our goal and approach and a pathway to continue improvement upon our indicators in terms of our performance in both compliance and results, we continue to build the statewide system of support in an effort to support our

04:12:59.040 --> 04:13:18.040
LEAs with addressing some of the challenges within, in terms of addressing the outcomes for our students with disabilities. Our highlights of that system really include the special education local plan area, our SELPA system improvement leads, and our SELPA content leads over the past year.

04:13:18.040 --> 04:13:32.040
I think what COVID-19 really did highlight is really how vital of lifeline our system of support improvement leads and our content leads have been during this time and continue to be to supporting our LEAs.

04:13:32.040 --> 04:13:50.040
The number of workshops and webinars and outreach and touch points continue to grow as we continue to address some of the challenges that are surfacing and our TA providers and partners have been right there with us and right there with LEAs to provide, I think, critical and needed supports as well.

04:13:50.040 --> 04:13:52.040
Next slide.

04:13:52.040 --> 04:14:12.040
And to just run down and provide you an overview of who those content leads are. They vary in terms of topic and subject and in geographic location across the state. And while I won't describe what each of them do, you see here, you know, our content leads and sort of what their focus is on.

04:14:12.040 --> 04:14:31.040
And so, again, we work very closely with them, again, to be responsive to the needs of our LEAs, especially during this time, and really adapt our programming and our intent and our supports oftentimes based on the needs of the field at any given moment in time.

04:14:31.040 --> 04:14:34.040
Next slide.

04:14:34.040 --> 04:14:49.040
And once again, so just in terms of next steps for, you know, the state and our system of support, really wanting us to align everything that we do to really get to the classroom, right?

04:14:49.040 --> 04:15:18.040
And so we know that there are multiple systems between a state education agency and the classroom, and so it really requires a coordinated effort of our system of support partners, our technical assistance partners, legislative investments as well to ensure that our efforts are reaching the classroom level, which is our intention in order to, again, make those gains as we all desire as well.

04:15:18.040 --> 04:15:46.040
And at this point in time, I would like to transition over to our multi-tiered system of support partners, California MTSS, and they will walk us through an overview of the critical work that they're doing, again, to improve outcomes for all students and students with disabilities as well and have seen, I think, some really good success in terms of various LEAs who are adopting

04:15:47.040 --> 04:15:58.040
an MTSS system and an MTSS approach and philosophy on how they support students across the state. So I will hand it over to our partners in Orange and Butte County, and we will hear from them at this point in time.

04:15:58.040 --> 04:16:13.040
Good afternoon, State Board and CDE partners. We are pleased to be invited to be here today to provide an overview and an update on the work that we are doing with California MTSS. Next slide, please.

04:16:13.040 --> 04:16:28.040
Go ahead and move to next slide. As part of the California State System of Support and the California MTSS LEAD, we do have representatives here today from the Orange County Department of Education and the Butte County Office of Education.

04:16:28.040 --> 04:16:41.040
I'd like to introduce myself and my colleagues. I'm Jamie Parsons, and I'm the Director of Learning Support Services at the Orange County Department of Ed. With me today, I have Rhonda Marriott Spencer and Lauren Duran, who is our grant evaluator.

04:16:41.040 --> 04:16:56.040
And we have our colleague from Butte County, Rendita Ball, who is the Director of Rural California MTSS. Next slide.

04:16:56.040 --> 04:17:13.040
Can you hear me? Okay. Today we would like to share with you our California MTSS overview, defining exactly what is California MTSS. We'd also like to share our journey, which started in 2016, talk about phases one and two briefly.

04:17:13.040 --> 04:17:29.040
We'd like to share our outcomes so far from phases one and two, and then talk about our next step with phase three, which starts in March. With that, I would like to turn it over to my colleague, Rhonda Marriott, and if you could move to next slide.

04:17:29.040 --> 04:17:39.040
Thank you, Jamie. Happy to be here with everybody today. So yes, I will briefly share an overview of California MTSS. So if we can move to the next slide, please.

04:17:39.040 --> 04:17:53.040
And we would like to share the definition of California MTSS, which is a general education initiative. And as I read the definition, I encourage you to determine words or phrases that resonate with you.

04:17:53.040 --> 04:18:07.040
California's multi-tiered system of support is a comprehensive framework that aligns academic, behavioral, social-emotional learning, and mental health in a fully integrated system of support for the benefit of all students.

04:18:07.040 --> 04:18:20.040
California MTSS offers the potential to create needed systemic change through intentional design and redesign of services and supports to quickly identify and match to the needs of all students.

04:18:20.040 --> 04:18:31.040
This comprehensive framework is designed to provide effective supports for districts and schools to meet the needs of each and every student in the most inclusive and equitable learning environment.

04:18:31.040 --> 04:18:43.040
So as you advance to the next slide, you will see a visual and I'll briefly unpack the framework that supports the implementation of a multi-tiered system of support.

04:18:43.040 --> 04:18:54.040
The California MTSS framework aligns academic, behavioral, social-emotional learning, and mental health supports in a fully integrated system of support for the benefit of all students.

04:18:54.040 --> 04:19:11.040
The five evidence-based domains and features of the California MTSS framework serve as a supportive structure to develop the whole child in the most inclusive and equitable learning environment, thus closing the equity gaps for all students.

04:19:11.040 --> 04:19:25.040
The five domains of the framework include the whole child domain, which includes the features inclusive academic, inclusive behavior, inclusive transformative social-emotional instruction, and mental health supports.

04:19:25.040 --> 04:19:41.040
In order for the needs of the whole child to be met, the essential supporting domains must also be in place, and these include the administrative leadership to ensure there is strong and engaged site leadership and strong educator support.

04:19:41.040 --> 04:19:50.040
The integrated supports domain to enhance a fully integrated organizational structure and strong and positive school climate.

04:19:50.040 --> 04:20:10.040
The family and community engagement domain, which leads to trusting family and community partners, and the inclusive policy structures and practices domain that contributes to strong district and school relationships and LEA or district policy framework.

04:20:10.040 --> 04:20:21.040
We emphasize through the California MTSS framework the importance of the inclusion of all stakeholders involved at all levels of support within each domain.

04:20:21.040 --> 04:20:28.040
And if we go to the next slide, we have a visual of the whole child domain.

04:20:28.040 --> 04:20:41.040
Each domain of the framework includes descriptions and links to evidence-based resources to support a school site and a school district with the implementation of a multi-tiered system of support.

04:20:41.040 --> 04:20:50.040
So this image is of the whole child domain, and the additional four essential domains are also designed in this format.

04:20:50.040 --> 04:21:00.040
Our schools and districts really find this valuable to get a full understanding and also to have access to those evidence-based practices.

04:21:00.040 --> 04:21:08.040
And if you advance, thank you. On the next slide, a multi-tiered system of support is dependent on a continuum of support.

04:21:08.040 --> 04:21:19.040
California MTSS emphasizes the necessity that universal structures must be provided to all students, regardless of eligibility for other services and supports.

04:21:19.040 --> 04:21:30.040
While recognizing, of course, that some students need supplemental support at times, and a few students may occasionally require more intensified supports to be successful.

04:21:30.040 --> 04:21:43.040
The continuum of support is grounded in universal design for learning, differentiated instruction, culturally relevant and responsive teaching, integrated and implemented at all levels of support.

04:21:43.040 --> 04:21:57.040
Through California MTSS, there is an emphasis on the fact that the students are not in the tiers. On the contrary, the supports necessary to meet the needs of students are in the tiers.

04:21:57.040 --> 04:22:05.040
So the next slide will share a visual of our journey with California MTSS. Thank you.

04:22:05.040 --> 04:22:20.040
So in phase one, looking over at the left, the California MTSS journey began in 2016 through the partnership between the California Department of Education, State Board of Education, Orange County and Butte County Offices of Education.

04:22:20.040 --> 04:22:29.040
The capacity of all 58 county offices and over 600 districts was enhanced through the California MTSS foundational training.

04:22:29.040 --> 04:22:41.040
In 2019 and 20, additional funding was received to support a pilot focused on leveraging California MTSS to improve school conditions and climate.

04:22:41.040 --> 04:22:52.040
In 2020, to continue to support our pilot schools, we pivoted to create an online training course for California MTSS pathway certification.

04:22:52.040 --> 04:23:14.040
In 2021, the state allocated additional funding to support phase three, a larger grant program to allow school teams, consortium partners and county offices to build capacity using the certification course and a coaching model to implement effective school-based multi-tiered system of support.

04:23:14.040 --> 04:23:24.040
The next slide is a different visual, but also provides information and represents our journey through California MTSS.

04:23:24.040 --> 04:23:41.040
We have emphasized the importance of whole system engagement, building capacity at the county and local education agency level to better support school site efforts, which ultimately impacts our students, families and communities who are, of course, the purpose of our work.

04:23:41.040 --> 04:23:50.040
And finally, for my portion on the next slide, we would like to highlight the reach and impact of our California MTSS efforts.

04:23:50.040 --> 04:23:59.040
So on row one, phase one offered funding, professional learning and support throughout the state of California.

04:23:59.040 --> 04:24:11.040
In phase two, those 49 school sites engaged in the California MTSS efforts via the support of an assigned coach working directly with the school site principal and the leadership team.

04:24:11.040 --> 04:24:18.040
And now we're ready to embark on phase three of California MTSS, and that begins this year.

04:24:18.040 --> 04:24:22.040
Jamie will elaborate on that coming up shortly in this section.

04:24:22.040 --> 04:24:29.040
And again, they will engage in California MTSS and receive support of an assigned coach.

04:24:29.040 --> 04:24:38.040
So my colleague, Rindy Deval from Butte County Office will now share information on successes and outcomes, as well as our rural schools.

04:24:38.040 --> 04:24:42.040
Thank you, Rhonda. Good afternoon.

04:24:42.040 --> 04:24:55.040
The California Rural Ed Network as the rural arm of California MTSS was launched in response to requests from educators across California during the first cohort of districts engaging in California MTSS implementation.

04:24:55.040 --> 04:25:07.040
Our colleagues in rural areas urged Butte County Office of Education to solidify our commitment to California MTSS in rural California by becoming the amplifier of their voices.

04:25:07.040 --> 04:25:15.040
Since then, our highest achievement in the network has been to create environments that connect rural educators to each other across the state.

04:25:15.040 --> 04:25:25.040
Through virtual formats, we've discussed and strategized continuous improvement practices in serving the whole child in the unique ways in which rural educators excel.

04:25:25.040 --> 04:25:38.040
With the opportunity to share the successes of implementing the California MTSS framework, our rural colleagues are becoming more and more empowered and successful, even as the historical challenges of living and working in rural California continue.

04:25:38.040 --> 04:26:01.040
The Butte County Office of Education's partnership in California MTSS and the system of support has helped the California Rural Ed Network to gain recognition as a hub for folks to engage in essential conversations about racial and social equity, tailored resources and support for California MTSS and the ongoing advocacy for rural educators, students and their families.

04:26:01.040 --> 04:26:06.040
I'm so grateful to be able to introduce the California Rural Ed Network to all of you this afternoon.

04:26:06.040 --> 04:26:15.040
And I'd like to share some successes of California MTSS implementation as well. Thank you. And we'll go to the next slide also.

04:26:15.040 --> 04:26:29.040
So our expected outcomes for California MTSS include those reductions in rates of suspension and expulsion, incidents of bullying and harassment, discipline referrals, referrals to special education, chronic absenteeism, dropout rates.

04:26:29.040 --> 04:26:47.040
While we're also at the same time trying to improve in graduation rates, academic achievement, specifically in English language arts and math, in addition to all academic achievement, specifically highlighting those, as well as the positive school climate and those perceptions of school climate.

04:26:47.040 --> 04:26:50.040
Thanks so much. Go ahead. We'll show you some highlights.

04:26:50.040 --> 04:26:55.040
We'd like to highlight from phase one of the implementation of California MTSS framework.

04:26:55.040 --> 04:27:06.040
By the final year of phase one, schools and LEAs were implementing or sustaining implementation as signified by green and orange, those areas in those horizontal bars.

04:27:06.040 --> 04:27:11.040
On more practices of the California MTSS framework as compared to their baseline.

04:27:11.040 --> 04:27:15.040
So you'll notice the blue and yellow is our baseline data.

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:25.040
And we were into implementing and sustaining implementation. Thank you. Next slide.

04:27:25.040 --> 04:27:36.040
Great. Some phase one student outcome highlights. So cohorts one and two during phase one had a decrease in suspensions by one percentage point.

04:27:36.040 --> 04:27:40.040
Let's go ahead. Next slide. Thanks.

04:27:40.040 --> 04:27:54.040
And in phase one also our cohorts one and two decrease the number of students referred for special education by 93%.

04:27:54.040 --> 04:28:04.040
Also, all three cohorts in phase one showed increases in positive school engagement and supports.

04:28:05.040 --> 04:28:18.040
And now with phase two, wrapping up phase two, implementation of California MTSS framework, our schools in phase two A are making progress toward implementing or sustaining implementation.

04:28:18.040 --> 04:28:26.040
Again, with those green and orange bars on more practices of the California MTSS framework, but remain at the installing level on most items.

04:28:27.040 --> 04:28:36.040
And we will continue to monitor their progress as well through year five, which is in 2023, and hope to see those trends continue.

04:28:36.040 --> 04:28:44.040
I believe that you were to receive a handout or you may receive a handout in the future with more of this detailed data.

04:28:44.040 --> 04:28:51.040
We have it on print as well. I think because of time, we decided to just verbally show you some of the highlights.

04:28:51.040 --> 04:28:57.040
And so that's it for my section. And I think I'll turn it back to Jamie for phase three.

04:28:57.040 --> 04:28:59.040
Yes. Thank you, Rindy. Appreciate that.

04:28:59.040 --> 04:29:07.040
So our next steps we'd like to share with you what we have planned for phase three, which will run from 2022 to 2026.

04:29:07.040 --> 04:29:11.040
You can move to the next slide.

04:29:11.040 --> 04:29:17.040
You can see our California MTSS journey graphic again, if you move all the way to the right in the purple.

04:29:17.040 --> 04:29:27.040
As of 2022, we are now in phase three of our statewide work, which is now wide scale school based implementation of California MTSS.

04:29:27.040 --> 04:29:36.040
In phase one, if you recall, we focused on the LEA implementation and making sure supports were in place at the district level in phases two and three.

04:29:36.040 --> 04:29:38.040
We've moved to school based implementation.

04:29:38.040 --> 04:29:44.040
This time in phase three, we have special emphasis on the social and emotional well-being of our students.

04:29:44.040 --> 04:29:49.040
Next slide.

04:29:49.040 --> 04:29:55.040
With phase three, we had funding and training opportunities for three different types of awardees.

04:29:55.040 --> 04:30:02.040
We had opportunities for individual schools to apply, and we focused on an opportunity for both small school and large school,

04:30:02.040 --> 04:30:08.040
focusing on student enrollment and different funding levels applied to those applications.

04:30:08.040 --> 04:30:19.040
We also had an opportunity for consortia of between two to six partners, and that could include schools as partners or LEAs as partners and county offices could also partner as well.

04:30:19.040 --> 04:30:22.040
The third opportunity is for county offices.

04:30:22.040 --> 04:30:25.040
We want to really focus on our county office colleagues.

04:30:25.040 --> 04:30:36.040
This grant opportunity provides them with an option to increase their capacity and increase the training of staff to become certified California MTSS coaches.

04:30:36.040 --> 04:30:40.040
Next slide, please.

04:30:40.040 --> 04:30:54.040
So our grant goals with phase three is to build capacity through virtual professional learning using the California MTSS pathway certification course and coaching.

04:30:54.040 --> 04:31:00.040
And if we can go back to the next slide.

04:31:00.040 --> 04:31:02.040
If you can move forward two slides.

04:31:02.040 --> 04:31:03.040
There we go.

04:31:03.040 --> 04:31:15.040
The grant goals building school staff capacity through virtual professional learning using the California MTSS pathway certification course and pairing that with a coaching model, which is very important.

04:31:15.040 --> 04:31:23.040
We did allow for schools and consortia to self select the cohort that matched their readiness to engage in this work.

04:31:23.040 --> 04:31:32.040
So they have the opportunity to start with us right away in March of 2022, September next year to start the school year or the following March.

04:31:32.040 --> 04:31:43.040
And again, we would like to offer the opportunity to our county office colleagues to increase the number of staff in their offices who can become those certified coaches for schools in their area and regions.

04:31:43.040 --> 04:31:50.040
Next slide.

04:31:50.040 --> 04:31:53.040
Next slide.

04:31:53.040 --> 04:31:55.040
Go back one.

04:31:55.040 --> 04:31:56.040
Like to talk, go back one.

04:31:56.040 --> 04:31:58.040
We'd like to talk about the coaching model.

04:31:58.040 --> 04:31:59.040
Thank you.

04:31:59.040 --> 04:32:01.040
There we are.

04:32:01.040 --> 04:32:07.040
So the important component of our phase two and phase three is that coaching model.

04:32:07.040 --> 04:32:18.040
And each administrator will be assigned a certified California MTSS coach and that coach may be from their local county office or from their LEA or it could be from our state team.

04:32:18.040 --> 04:32:26.040
And administrators and coaches will meet regularly to plan implementation of California MTSS based on their school's specific needs.

04:32:26.040 --> 04:32:30.040
And then, of course, technical assistance will be provided as needed.

04:32:30.040 --> 04:32:32.040
They can just pick up the phone and call.

04:32:32.040 --> 04:32:34.040
And you can see some of our outcomes there.

04:32:34.040 --> 04:32:44.040
We hope to increase capacity for all staff based on the role they play in their school and, of course, build overall understanding and working knowledge of California MTSS.

04:32:44.040 --> 04:32:49.040
Improve fidelity of implementation as you saw in some of those slides that Rindy showed you.

04:32:49.040 --> 04:33:02.040
We use various measures to ensure that schools are using fidelity in the implementation of this work and improve overall outcomes for our students related to academics, behavior, social and emotional learning, and mental health.

04:33:02.040 --> 04:33:06.040
Next slide.

04:33:06.040 --> 04:33:35.040
Both the coaching and our professional learning through our course incorporate evidence based practices such as those high leverage practices in special education, trauma informed instructional practices, universal design for learning, the whole child, whole school, whole community model, as well as culturally, linguistically relevant and responsive teaching practices, and technical assistance is provided on an ongoing basis by the coach as it applies to the schools.

04:33:36.040 --> 04:33:41.040
Next slide, please.

04:33:41.040 --> 04:33:43.040
Rhonda mentioned this earlier.

04:33:43.040 --> 04:33:53.040
We use this course, this California MTSS pathway certification course for schools in phase two with our schools as we pivoted in 2020.

04:33:53.040 --> 04:34:08.040
This course is a competency based course and includes badging opportunities in three areas, introduction to California MTSS or getting started, foundational elements of MTSS, and role specific pathways.

04:34:08.040 --> 04:34:18.040
The course includes eight modules. It is an interactive course. It takes approximately 50 to 60 hours to complete the course for individual staff members.

04:34:18.040 --> 04:34:22.040
It can be done synchronously or asynchronously as a team.

04:34:22.040 --> 04:34:29.040
The responses that individual participants provide are scored and sent back to the participant.

04:34:29.040 --> 04:34:38.040
And successful completion of the course results in both certification as a California MTSS educator and in your role specific pathway.

04:34:38.040 --> 04:34:41.040
Next slide, please.

04:34:41.040 --> 04:34:44.040
And here are some examples of our role specific pathways.

04:34:44.040 --> 04:35:11.040
The course was built to support. We have pathways for teachers, administrators, school counselors, school psychologists, school based mental health clinicians, paraeducators, coaches, and those are specifically for our county office colleagues, and higher education for our university partners who are beginning to embed California MTSS into pre-service education courses.

04:35:11.040 --> 04:35:14.040
Next slide, please.

04:35:14.040 --> 04:35:31.040
Our next steps are to meet with our awardees next month in February. We'll meet with our county offices on February the 2nd, our schools and consortia mid-month on the 17th, and coaching and course enrollment will begin by March 1st for those schools who selected cohort A.

04:35:31.040 --> 04:35:33.040
Next slide.

04:35:33.040 --> 04:35:44.040
And then finally, I would like to highlight that we will be hosting our fifth annual California MTSS Professional Learning Institute in July 12th through the 14th.

04:35:44.040 --> 04:35:55.040
Our theme this year is Hear Me, Together We Rise. And we intend to have a hybrid model. We will be in person in Anaheim, but also streaming and provided recorded content.

04:35:55.040 --> 04:36:10.040
In the past, we have been proud to have between 3,000 to 4,000 educators in attendance at this conference from all across the state and from other states in the United States. So we really are excited to host this again this year.

04:36:10.040 --> 04:36:21.040
With that, I'm going to turn it over to Heather. Thank you so much for the opportunity to share our content today.

04:36:21.040 --> 04:36:37.040
Great. Thank you so much, Jamie, Rhonda, Lauren, and Rindy for an overview and stepping us through the MTSS framework, your plans, your scaling, and your performance over the past year or so.

04:36:37.040 --> 04:36:55.040
I think what's interesting to note and just sort of thinking and looking and hearing your presentation as well is really an MTSS system really touches upon some of the indicators that you have seen in this previous presentation just a little bit ago as well.

04:36:55.040 --> 04:37:06.040
And so again, a strong MTSS system implemented with fidelity can really, really have a significant impact on student outcomes and student performance as well.

04:37:06.040 --> 04:37:18.040
And so we look forward to the partnership ahead and continued work together again to address the needs of all of our students in California. So again, many thanks to all of you.

04:37:18.040 --> 04:37:44.040
But at this point in time, there is a request for action, and we would request that this item, the APR, including the ESSEP covering the program years 2021-2022, be considered for approval by the State Board of Education for a February submission to OSEP as well.

04:37:44.040 --> 04:37:53.040
Thank you very much. Very appreciate the very thorough review.

04:37:53.040 --> 04:38:03.040
The public comment slide is up. And so we will encourage people who want to comment to queue up now. We'll open the phone line.

04:38:03.040 --> 04:38:15.040
Members of the public wishing to provide comment on this item may do so by calling the telephone number and using the access code provided on the slide that is shown now while we're waiting for members of the public to call in.

04:38:15.040 --> 04:38:24.040
I want to ask Vice President Strauss if she has any initial comments, and then we will see if there are any clarifying questions before we go to public comment.

04:38:24.040 --> 04:38:27.040
Vice President Strauss.

04:38:27.040 --> 04:38:43.040
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond, and thank you, Heather and Shiloh and the whole team for presenting. I recognize this is a requirement that's actually led by the federal government that we all have to align and do the analysis for.

04:38:43.040 --> 04:38:48.040
I understand this goes through 21. I don't think it goes through 22 yet, right?

04:38:48.040 --> 04:38:55.040
This is for federal fiscal year 2021, so school year 2021.

04:38:55.040 --> 04:39:11.040
Yeah, so let me just say I appreciated you highlighting several areas. I know as the liaison to the Advisory Commission on Special Ed, the department uses this process to actually kind of focus their work going forward and try to use it as a growth opportunity.

04:39:11.040 --> 04:39:30.040
I appreciate that the data the last couple years is not showing the same that we were seeing before, but it is a guidance, and I would say the whole idea of disproportionality that you talked about early in the presentation is one that I know districts have paid a lot of attention to and have used it.

04:39:30.040 --> 04:39:44.040
So I appreciate that you dealt with the compliance and also the performance indicators because these are things as we go forward we need to pay attention to as to how are we improving opportunities for our students with special needs.

04:39:44.040 --> 04:39:56.040
I do want to say that I appreciate the MTSS presentation. MTSS is something we talk about in all of our work and literacy and mathematics for everybody, not just students with disabilities.

04:39:56.040 --> 04:40:21.040
I know we have a giant department, I think 1,500 employees, and I know Heather's managing MTSS and that work with special ed, but as I reflect on this morning's conversation about the community schools, I think this is everybody should be in the same room talking about this because as you talk about social, emotional learning and mental health supports and supports in the least restrictive environment, that's absolutely what we want to be talking about in the community school.

04:40:21.040 --> 04:40:35.040
So this is I think a good example of what we need to think about and would ask the board and CDE and state board staff to continue to benefit connecting rather these projects rather than keeping them in separate buckets.

04:40:35.040 --> 04:40:48.040
I know it's challenging. The other thing that I know the Governor Newsom with President Darling-Hammond's guidance has put a lot of money in the last couple years, this year and last year, into professional learning for staff.

04:40:48.040 --> 04:40:59.040
So I appreciated the coaching model that the MTSS talked about. We know all teachers need that support and I appreciated the coaching for the administrators that was highlighted in the MTSS model.

04:40:59.040 --> 04:41:07.040
And I think the professional development to help everybody understand this system as we connect all of our work and build coherence will be important.

04:41:07.040 --> 04:41:23.040
So I just want to thank some of the highlights that Heather Calamese and her team presented and recognize that this is about a required report for the federal government on students with disabilities, but it totally impacts our practice in our schools for all of our students.

04:41:23.040 --> 04:41:28.040
And Heather, when we go back to you, you may want to make a few more comments about how you're using this to guide the work.

04:41:28.040 --> 04:41:40.040
And then I would hope that the CDE and State Board team could continue to remember that this all needs to be in the same room talking about because it's really important opportunities to improve our practice for all kids.

04:41:40.040 --> 04:41:45.040
Thank you very much. I'll recommend approval when we get to that point. Thank you.

04:41:45.040 --> 04:41:52.040
Thanks. Are there any clarifying questions? I'm not seeing any hands raised.

04:41:52.040 --> 04:41:57.040
And seeing none, let's go to public comment.

04:42:06.040 --> 04:42:12.040
Well, we have the phone line open for public comment. If there are any members of the public, I hope so.

04:42:12.040 --> 04:42:16.040
We do have callers. We just have an issue with one of the mics here. Just one moment.

04:42:16.040 --> 04:42:20.040
Okay, great.

04:42:20.040 --> 04:42:36.040
While we're waiting on that, I did want to give me an opportunity to say thank you to all of our members, and all of our members who have been so supportive of the work that we've done in special education.

04:42:36.040 --> 04:42:51.040
I've been around the department for about 10 years, and you all have always been so kind to us when we've come to the board in support of our work and willing to sit in on very long presentations around data and listen intently and provide amazing feedback.

04:42:51.040 --> 04:43:00.040
I remember when I was just like a little baby coming to the board like so scared, but you all were always so kind. And so I just really, really appreciate it.

04:43:00.040 --> 04:43:09.040
And it'll be sad not to see your faces even virtually going forward, but you have still an amazing board, but it would be sad not to see you on every meeting.

04:43:09.040 --> 04:43:16.040
But thank you so much for all of your dedication and support to all students with disabilities in California.

04:43:16.040 --> 04:43:20.040
Okay, President Darling-Hammond, I believe we're ready to take public comment now.

04:43:20.040 --> 04:43:21.040
All right.

04:43:21.040 --> 04:43:28.040
It looks like we have six people signed up for public comment. I will open the phone lines up now.

04:43:28.040 --> 04:43:39.040
Good afternoon, caller. Please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:43:39.040 --> 04:43:44.040
We have two members here speaking. I'll let the first one go first. Thank you.

04:43:44.040 --> 04:43:45.040
Thank you.

04:43:46.040 --> 04:43:55.040
An 11-year-old student. I want to let you know that school districts are suing children to deny services rather than providing education.

04:43:55.040 --> 04:44:09.040
I want to request that you mandate an audit, but first help us to learn how much money is spent on mitigation. Please support the YouTube movement for education, less litigation. Thank you.

04:44:09.040 --> 04:44:10.040
Thank you.

04:44:10.040 --> 04:44:15.040
And is there a second?

04:44:15.040 --> 04:44:20.040
Yes. This is Memphis areas representing the YouTube movement.

04:44:20.040 --> 04:44:28.040
I wish to bring to the light and to your attention the many unjust that are occurring in special education.

04:44:28.040 --> 04:44:35.040
Parents in my local area are being sued to deny them assessments and a proper education.

04:44:35.040 --> 04:44:44.040
I'm an active community member and I see firsthand how districts are following due processes against the special education children.

04:44:44.040 --> 04:44:52.040
Our family was sued to deny a simple assessment that we require for one of our children.

04:44:52.040 --> 04:45:05.040
So I ask if there is any way you can request audits to be completed against help us to learn how money is being spent on education and litigation.

04:45:05.040 --> 04:45:12.040
And this will bring light on how districts are using the funds that are supposed to go to education.

04:45:12.040 --> 04:45:20.040
So please find more information about this on our local website, the YouTube movement for education, less litigation. Thank you very much.

04:45:22.040 --> 04:45:29.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:45:29.040 --> 04:45:34.040
Good afternoon. My name is Scott Turner and I'm speaking on behalf of the self administrators of California.

04:45:34.040 --> 04:45:39.040
Our association is appreciative of the continued focus on improved outcomes for students with disabilities.

04:45:39.040 --> 04:45:45.040
We continue to work closely with CDE and other agency partners on this priority, and we are encouraged to see the amount of detail in this report.

04:45:45.040 --> 04:45:53.040
And today's presentation on the role of SELPAs, including the SELPAs serving as system improvement leads and content leads for students with disabilities in the statewide system of support.

04:45:53.040 --> 04:46:00.040
Our association is also excited for the soon to be released annual assurances support plan enacted in 2018 by AB 1808.

04:46:00.040 --> 04:46:09.040
By July 1 of 2023 and annually thereafter, this new plan will become section C of all local plans and will provide details about how the governing board of the SELPA has determined that the SELPA will one,

04:46:09.040 --> 04:46:21.040
support LEAs in achieving goals, actions and services within their LCAPs, two, connect member LEAs in need of technical assistance to the statewide system of support, and three, support LEAs in meeting all required assurances under the IDEA.

04:46:21.040 --> 04:46:33.040
This additional section of our local plans will be another big step in providing a more coherent accountability system, increasing transportation for the decisions being made in each SELPA through local control, and furthering our collective goal for improving outcomes for students with disabilities.

04:46:33.040 --> 04:46:36.040
Thank you for your time.

04:46:36.040 --> 04:46:43.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. Your time starts now.

04:46:43.040 --> 04:46:55.040
Good afternoon. My name is Jessica Martinez, and I am a member of the Alto Loma School District in the West End SELPA. I wanted to share my concerns with the lack of accountability and special education.

04:46:55.040 --> 04:47:05.040
In my district, despite many, many objections, due process cases are not presented for approval to the school board as the Brown Act requires.

04:47:05.040 --> 04:47:23.040
The decisions are made outside of the public view, and even I, as a board member, am not included in how the decisions are made. Lawyers are paid millions of dollars in the West End SELPA to litigate against students. I ask the state board to please look into these issues. Thank you.

04:47:24.040 --> 04:47:33.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:47:33.040 --> 04:47:44.040
Hello, State Board of Education. I wanted to share concerns regarding special education. It has been the experience in many families that special education students and families are not treated fairly.

04:47:44.040 --> 04:47:59.040
It is important that the LEAs are provided with guidance and assistance so that all students with IEPs are in classes with Gen Ed students and not segregated in a separate special day class.

04:47:59.040 --> 04:48:10.040
I would like to ask that your board request that the California Department of Education conduct an audit to find out if local school boards are approving litigation as required by the Brown Act.

04:48:10.040 --> 04:48:21.040
A lot of money is being spent on litigation and many times the school boards are not even made aware that their special education students are being sued with our educational dollars. Thank you.

04:48:22.040 --> 04:48:30.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:48:31.040 --> 04:48:57.040
Hello. I'm a parent that has dealt with the special education system for almost 15 years. I wanted to comment on performance indicator number 13 for which the target has not been made or met regarding secondary transition and share my story of how broken the special education system is in the West End SELPA.

04:48:57.040 --> 04:49:08.040
I am in the Upland Unified School District and since 2016 Upland Unified and we SELPA have refused to provide my child with any secondary services whatsoever.

04:49:08.040 --> 04:49:19.040
Instead, the district has decided to tie up these services in court and their attorneys of the law firm of Fagan Freeman and Full Frost have made hundreds of thousands of dollars by litigating.

04:49:19.040 --> 04:49:35.040
This is a great injustice and in the West End SELPA the vast majority of students affected are minority students. Please ask for an audit of how SELPAs in California are using education dollars to litigate to deny services to children with disabilities. Thank you.

04:49:35.040 --> 04:49:42.040
Next caller, please state your name and affiliation for the record. You have one minute. Your time starts now.

04:49:42.040 --> 04:49:52.040
Hello, Brianna Bruns on behalf of the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association representing the 58 County Superintendents of Schools.

04:49:52.040 --> 04:49:59.040
We applaud the state's continued efforts and focus on increasing access, inclusion and positive outcomes for students with disabilities in California.

04:49:59.040 --> 04:50:25.040
We recognize that today's item is a status report that will be submitted to the U.S. Department of Education and we see this as a reminder to remain steadfast in our pursuit of equity and improved outcomes for all students. Thank you for your time.

04:50:25.040 --> 04:50:38.040
Thank you. And we have one more public comment that was submitted this afternoon in writing. This person unfortunately was unable to call in this afternoon and would like us to read their public comment.

04:50:38.040 --> 04:50:50.040
So I will do that now. Quote mediations are not working in California. This is in part due to parents being told they cannot bring advocates to mediation only, which is not the law.

04:50:50.040 --> 04:51:00.040
OAH administrative law judges are prohibiting advocates from attending or not allowing advocates to speak. This is a gross violation of children's rights.

04:51:00.040 --> 04:51:12.040
Judge Kamaroff would not allow my advocate to speak and made and made me have an attorney at mediation, costing me thousands of dollars, which did not result in a resolution.

04:51:12.040 --> 04:51:22.040
OAH is biased against parents and is interfering with the resolution process, end quote. And that concludes public comment for item number four.

04:51:22.040 --> 04:51:34.040
And just to clarify, the last comment was provided by staff as a reasonable accommodation requested by the caller. Thank you.

04:51:34.040 --> 04:51:41.040
Thank you. Thank you so much to all the callers. Thank you to all the presenters.

04:51:41.040 --> 04:51:48.040
Lots to chew on here. I want to open this up for any board discussion.

04:51:48.040 --> 04:51:54.040
And that we may need to make a motion.

04:51:54.040 --> 04:52:00.040
Is there any, I see member Burr.

04:52:00.040 --> 04:52:08.040
Get myself off mute. Thank you. First, I just want to express my appreciation to all of the presenters. Excuse me.

04:52:08.040 --> 04:52:22.040
I've had the opportunity to hear a lot about MTSS through my work at the collaborative because the collaborative helps to organize the self content leads and the other work around MTSS.

04:52:22.040 --> 04:52:32.040
So I appreciate you being there. And as always, Heather and Shiloh's presentations are incredibly helpful and illuminating about how our children are doing.

04:52:32.040 --> 04:52:41.040
I just I wanted to kind of tag on to what Eileen Strauss said about MTSS being part of the regular education system.

04:52:41.040 --> 04:52:49.040
We say that we've been saying that for many years and yet the presentation, I don't know, this is going to sound derogatory.

04:52:49.040 --> 04:52:58.040
I don't mean it to be, but it sort of gets pigeonholed with special education presentation on how a specific category of students are doing.

04:52:58.040 --> 04:53:13.040
So I will just reinforce that I hope that it gets bigger exposure and maybe a different venue or in addition to Heather's presentation in future opportunities.

04:53:13.040 --> 04:53:23.040
The other thing that just occurred to me was having heard the conversation this morning about community schools and then hearing the presentation about MTSS right on top of it.

04:53:23.040 --> 04:53:38.040
They seem so similar. So maybe somebody could help me understand both what the differences might be and the similarities and how the community schools are going to build on MTSS or it's the other way around.

04:53:38.040 --> 04:53:46.040
But anyway, it just struck me how consistent they were. Thank you.

04:53:46.040 --> 04:54:00.040
I would I would just like to comment that I think they are intended to build on each other and it relates to a question I'd like to ask, which is we saw the numbers of schools that were being supported in this phase one and phase two and so on.

04:54:00.040 --> 04:54:06.040
It's a relatively small number of schools and districts.

04:54:06.040 --> 04:54:14.040
And I wonder what your estimate is of I mean, I know it's much more expansive in the state than those numbers might suggest.

04:54:14.040 --> 04:54:21.040
So I just wondered if you have an estimate around that.

04:54:21.040 --> 04:54:32.040
I can unmute and answer for phase one. Those numbers may be buried because we had an impact on over 600 districts, which represents multiple schools.

04:54:32.040 --> 04:54:40.040
So those numbers may sound lower than they really are in terms of the work we're doing now with the school based work we have.

04:54:40.040 --> 04:54:50.040
About 88, I'm trying to recall the number of consortia, but it represents over 200 schools in the consortia and about 100 schools in the single schools.

04:54:50.040 --> 04:54:55.040
So we will continue to grow that number and we expect to continue this work down the road.

04:54:55.040 --> 04:55:02.040
So this was an optional and voluntary application for a grant. So schools who are ready to engage in this work did apply.

04:55:02.040 --> 04:55:06.040
And of course, we continue to spread the word. Thank you.

04:55:06.040 --> 04:55:11.040
And I think to member Burr's point, there is a lot of similarity.

04:55:11.040 --> 04:55:21.040
We saw that actually even in the framework for community schools that it's meeting kids where they are and helping them get what they need.

04:55:21.040 --> 04:55:27.040
And so we want them to be hand in glove.

04:55:27.040 --> 04:55:31.040
Are there other questions or comments? I see member Rucker.

04:55:31.040 --> 04:55:40.040
And then I'm going to encourage us to get to a motion because we are running a little behind our anticipated schedule to get you to dinner.

04:55:40.040 --> 04:55:46.040
Thank you. I just wanted to thank the staff for this report. I do look forward to it each year.

04:55:47.040 --> 04:56:01.040
And in fact, I started looking forward to it after hearing Fred Baucom make the report for the first time because I was interested in what the numbers behind the significant disproportionality report actually mean.

04:56:01.040 --> 04:56:14.040
And for me, that particular segment of the report, because it does represent the over representation of the referral of students of color, particularly African-American boys for special education programs.

04:56:14.040 --> 04:56:20.040
And so for me, what lives behind those numbers is not just simply the numbers that were reported.

04:56:20.040 --> 04:56:40.040
But I wanted to take this moment to commend the staff for the work group on significant disproportionality that Shiloh had created, not only to study what the numbers mean, but to understand how the reporting was going to change based on the shift in the federal mandate.

04:56:40.040 --> 04:56:57.040
And what I'm very excited about is this work group now has shifted its focus to really start thinking about problem solving and how to provide the professional development and program support to districts to help them understand what reducing the numbers would look like.

04:56:57.040 --> 04:57:09.040
And what are the appropriate practices in their programs and across the scope of their student support practices that can ameliorate this problem?

04:57:09.040 --> 04:57:15.040
Significant disproportionality is not an intractable problem. It's not insurmountable.

04:57:15.040 --> 04:57:24.040
It requires a reframing of the understanding of what the purposes of a referral to the IEP or the student study process is actually for.

04:57:24.040 --> 04:57:38.040
But also understanding what is missing in providing support and understanding what it means to provide real instructional support that has meaning and context for students of color, particularly for teachers who work with African-American boys.

04:57:38.040 --> 04:57:48.040
So I really do want to commend the department and Shiloh and Heather for undertaking this work because these are some very tough and hard conversations to have with districts.

04:57:48.040 --> 04:57:55.040
But they are very important because they bleed out into and have a rippling effect on the rest of the program.

04:57:55.040 --> 04:58:04.040
And in fact, the educational experience for these students. So I wanted to make sure I called that out.

04:58:05.040 --> 04:58:11.040
Are there any other questions or comments at this point?

04:58:11.040 --> 04:58:15.040
Looks like Jamie wants to maybe make a response to something.

04:58:15.040 --> 04:58:32.040
Yes, I did. I wanted to comment that I didn't want to comment that to your point about the community schools, the state California MTSS team has already begun the work of doing a crosswalk between the principals of community schools and the principals of California MTSS.

04:58:32.040 --> 04:58:36.040
And we're beginning to look at how we can support that effort across the state.

04:58:36.040 --> 04:58:46.040
And of course, one of the things community schools funding will do is give people the resources to implement some of the MTSS practices that do overlap.

04:58:46.040 --> 04:58:50.040
Yes, it is nice partnership between the two.

04:58:50.040 --> 04:58:54.040
Member Strauss, did you just put your hand up?

04:58:54.040 --> 04:58:56.040
I did to make a motion if you're ready.

04:58:56.040 --> 04:58:58.040
Terrific. Thank you. Yes.

04:58:58.040 --> 04:59:17.040
So I move approval of the executive summary of the federal fiscal year 2020 annual performance report for Part B of the IDEA Individuals with Disabilities Education Act covering the program year 2021 as prepared by the special education division.

04:59:17.040 --> 04:59:21.040
Do I have a second?

04:59:21.040 --> 04:59:23.040
I will second.

04:59:23.040 --> 04:59:27.040
Thank you. We have a second and a third and maybe even a fourth.

04:59:27.040 --> 04:59:30.040
Is there any further discussion?

04:59:30.040 --> 04:59:34.040
Brooks, can you please call the roll for the vote?

04:59:34.040 --> 04:59:36.040
Member Sun.

04:59:36.040 --> 04:59:37.040
Aye.

04:59:37.040 --> 04:59:38.040
Member Strauss.

04:59:38.040 --> 04:59:39.040
Yes.

04:59:39.040 --> 04:59:42.040
Member Rucker.

04:59:42.040 --> 04:59:43.040
Yes.

04:59:43.040 --> 04:59:45.040
Member Rodriguez.

04:59:45.040 --> 04:59:46.040
Yes.

04:59:46.040 --> 04:59:48.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

04:59:48.040 --> 04:59:49.040
Yes.

04:59:49.040 --> 04:59:52.040
Member McQuillan.

04:59:52.040 --> 04:59:53.040
Yes.

04:59:53.040 --> 04:59:56.040
Vice President Glover-Woods.

04:59:56.040 --> 04:59:57.040
Yes.

04:59:57.040 --> 04:59:59.040
Member Escobedo.

04:59:59.040 --> 05:00:01.040
Yes.

05:00:01.040 --> 05:00:03.040
President Darling-Hammond.

05:00:03.040 --> 05:00:04.040
Yes.

05:00:04.040 --> 05:00:05.040
Member Burr.

05:00:05.040 --> 05:00:06.040
Aye.

05:00:06.040 --> 05:00:08.040
Member Menaka.

05:00:08.040 --> 05:00:09.040
Aye.

05:00:09.040 --> 05:00:12.040
Motion passes unanimously.

05:00:12.040 --> 05:00:14.040
Terrific. Thank you.

05:00:14.040 --> 05:00:17.040
We're going to take a 10 minute break.

05:00:17.040 --> 05:00:21.040
First, I'd like to be sure that the public comments slide goes back up so that we can

05:00:21.040 --> 05:00:26.040
get people queued up for public comment on the waiver items that we're going to handle

05:00:26.040 --> 05:00:29.040
when we return from the break.

05:00:29.040 --> 05:00:30.040
It is 3.04.

05:00:30.040 --> 05:00:35.040
We'll give you an extra minute and go till 3.15.

05:00:35.040 --> 05:00:37.040
President Darling-Hammond.

05:00:37.040 --> 05:00:38.040
Yes.

05:00:38.040 --> 05:00:42.040
I wanted to just make one brief comment before we transition off to the break.

05:00:42.040 --> 05:00:47.040
Just in response to some of the public comments today, I did want to let everyone know that

05:00:47.040 --> 05:00:52.040
the special education department does have a complaints department.

05:00:52.040 --> 05:00:58.040
We have monitoring staff, so if there are parents that are wishing to contact the CDE

05:00:58.040 --> 05:01:04.040
directly and discuss anything that may be of concern to you, you may access our contact

05:01:04.040 --> 05:01:10.040
information on the CDE website, and we do have a team that stands ready to assist parents

05:01:10.040 --> 05:01:12.040
across the state as well.

05:01:12.040 --> 05:01:14.040
So just wanted to add that in there as well.

05:01:14.040 --> 05:01:16.040
Appreciate that very much.

05:01:16.040 --> 05:01:18.040
Thank you very much, Heather.

05:01:18.040 --> 05:01:23.040
And with that, we will take a break, but please put the public comment slide up, whoever is

05:01:23.040 --> 05:01:27.040
in charge of that, so that we can have people queuing up for the waiver comments.

05:01:27.040 --> 05:01:28.040
Terrific.

05:01:28.040 --> 05:01:35.040
See you at 3.15.

05:01:35.040 --> 05:01:37.040
Okay.

05:01:37.040 --> 05:01:39.040
Welcome back.

05:01:39.040 --> 05:01:44.040
Members, we need to reestablish a quorum, so Brooks is going to call the roll.

05:01:44.040 --> 05:01:46.040
Member Sun.

05:01:46.040 --> 05:01:48.040

05:02:21.040 --> 05:02:23.040
Here.

05:02:23.040 --> 05:02:25.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:25.040 --> 05:02:27.040
Terrific.

05:02:27.040 --> 05:02:31.040
I'd like to take up our waiver consent calendar, which includes waiver items W1 through W10.

05:02:31.040 --> 05:02:33.040
And we'll see if there are any public comments on this waiver.

05:02:33.040 --> 05:02:35.040
Terrific.

05:02:35.040 --> 05:02:37.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:37.040 --> 05:02:39.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:39.040 --> 05:02:41.040

05:02:41.040 --> 05:02:43.040

05:02:43.040 --> 05:02:45.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:45.040 --> 05:02:47.040

05:02:47.040 --> 05:02:49.040

05:02:49.040 --> 05:02:51.040

05:02:51.040 --> 05:02:53.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:53.040 --> 05:02:55.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:55.040 --> 05:02:57.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:57.040 --> 05:02:59.040
We have a quorum.

05:02:59.040 --> 05:03:01.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:01.040 --> 05:03:03.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:03.040 --> 05:03:05.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:05.040 --> 05:03:07.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:07.040 --> 05:03:09.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:09.040 --> 05:03:11.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:11.040 --> 05:03:13.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:13.040 --> 05:03:15.040

05:03:15.040 --> 05:03:17.040

05:03:17.040 --> 05:03:19.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:19.040 --> 05:03:21.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:21.040 --> 05:03:23.040
We have a quorum.

05:03:24.040 --> 05:03:26.040
Good afternoon.

05:03:26.040 --> 05:03:28.040
Please say your name in affiliation for the record.

05:03:28.040 --> 05:03:30.040
Your time starts now.

05:03:35.040 --> 05:03:37.040
Good afternoon, caller.

05:03:37.040 --> 05:03:39.040
It looks like they just hung up.

05:03:42.040 --> 05:03:44.040
Good afternoon, caller.

05:03:44.040 --> 05:03:46.040
Please state your name in affiliation for the record.

05:03:46.040 --> 05:03:48.040
Your time starts now.

05:03:53.040 --> 05:03:58.040
The phone number ending in 0514, you are live.

05:03:58.040 --> 05:04:02.140
And please go ahead and say your public comment.

05:04:04.600 --> 05:04:06.780
Okay, it looks like they are not there.

05:04:09.440 --> 05:04:10.280
All right.

05:04:12.360 --> 05:04:13.600
Good afternoon.

05:04:13.600 --> 05:04:15.920
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:04:15.920 --> 05:04:16.760
You have one minute.

05:04:16.760 --> 05:04:17.900
Your time starts now.

05:04:23.560 --> 05:04:24.400
Hello.

05:04:25.480 --> 05:04:26.320
Go ahead.

05:04:30.680 --> 05:04:31.800
Caller, are you there?

05:04:33.680 --> 05:04:35.000
You are live.

05:04:35.000 --> 05:04:38.420
You can go ahead and give your comment.

05:04:41.080 --> 05:04:41.920
Caller.

05:04:41.920 --> 05:04:42.760
Go ahead.

05:04:50.680 --> 05:04:51.520
Good afternoon.

05:04:51.520 --> 05:04:53.880
Please say your name and affiliation for the record.

05:04:53.880 --> 05:04:55.140
Your time starts now.

05:04:57.120 --> 05:04:58.040
Yes, good afternoon.

05:04:58.040 --> 05:04:59.800
This is Liz Guiana, public advocate

05:04:59.800 --> 05:05:02.000
for the LCFS Equity Coalition.

05:05:03.160 --> 05:05:05.220
I'm speaking to item five.

05:05:05.220 --> 05:05:07.440
This board's approval of the comprehensive

05:05:07.440 --> 05:05:10.000
school improvement plans in item five.

05:05:10.680 --> 05:05:11.880
This isn't item five?

05:05:13.600 --> 05:05:14.440
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:05:14.440 --> 05:05:15.760
I thought these were the waivers.

05:05:15.760 --> 05:05:16.880
No, we're taking up.

05:05:18.080 --> 05:05:19.200
Yes, they are the waivers.

05:05:19.200 --> 05:05:20.040
They are the waivers.

05:05:20.040 --> 05:05:22.920
We're taking up consent waiver items right now.

05:05:22.920 --> 05:05:24.720
W01 to 10.

05:05:24.720 --> 05:05:25.840
Oh, I'm sorry, I moved.

05:05:25.840 --> 05:05:27.120
That's okay.

05:05:27.120 --> 05:05:27.940
Thank you.

05:05:30.240 --> 05:05:32.680
And it looks like that concludes public comment.

05:05:33.720 --> 05:05:36.520
Well, that was the most interesting public comment

05:05:36.520 --> 05:05:37.680
we've had for a while.

05:05:38.680 --> 05:05:40.720
Hearing no further public comment,

05:05:40.720 --> 05:05:44.360
I will ask for a motion on waivers W01 through W10.

05:05:44.360 --> 05:05:45.520
Do I have a motion?

05:05:48.040 --> 05:05:52.360
I move that we approve waivers W01 to W10.

05:05:52.360 --> 05:05:53.200
Thank you.

05:05:53.200 --> 05:05:54.440
Do I have a second?

05:05:54.440 --> 05:05:55.280
Thank you.

05:05:55.280 --> 05:05:57.000
I have a second.

05:05:57.000 --> 05:05:59.840
So with that, we'll hold a roll call vote.

05:05:59.840 --> 05:06:01.660
Brooks, please call the roll.

05:06:01.660 --> 05:06:02.580
Member Sun.

05:06:03.620 --> 05:06:04.540
Yes.

05:06:04.540 --> 05:06:06.100
Member Strauss.

05:06:06.100 --> 05:06:07.040
Yes.

05:06:07.080 --> 05:06:07.960
Member Rucker.

05:06:11.120 --> 05:06:12.080
Yes.

05:06:12.080 --> 05:06:13.880
Member Rodriguez.

05:06:13.880 --> 05:06:14.760
Yes.

05:06:14.760 --> 05:06:16.040
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:06:17.520 --> 05:06:18.360
Yes.

05:06:18.360 --> 05:06:20.000
Member McQuillan.

05:06:20.000 --> 05:06:21.080
Yes.

05:06:21.080 --> 05:06:23.160
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:06:23.160 --> 05:06:24.200
Yes.

05:06:24.200 --> 05:06:25.200
Member Escobedo.

05:06:26.240 --> 05:06:27.480
President Darlin-Hammond.

05:06:28.600 --> 05:06:29.520
Yes.

05:06:29.520 --> 05:06:30.360
Member Burr.

05:06:31.440 --> 05:06:32.340
Aye.

05:06:32.340 --> 05:06:33.180
Member Bonanca.

05:06:34.280 --> 05:06:35.320
Aye.

05:06:35.320 --> 05:06:36.220
Motion passes.

05:06:37.560 --> 05:06:39.920
I'll just note that Member Escobedo was not here

05:06:39.920 --> 05:06:42.960
and is recused from this vote.

05:06:42.960 --> 05:06:45.280
And now we're gonna go to, and now he's back.

05:06:45.280 --> 05:06:46.100
That's perfect.

05:06:46.100 --> 05:06:46.940
Perfect timing.

05:06:46.940 --> 05:06:47.760
Thank you.

05:06:47.760 --> 05:06:48.600
Good to see you.

05:06:48.600 --> 05:06:51.680
We're going to take up regular consent items five through 10

05:06:51.680 --> 05:06:52.920
and we'll now open the phone line

05:06:52.920 --> 05:06:55.560
for the queue for public comment on consent items

05:06:55.560 --> 05:06:58.920
five through 10 and the public comment card

05:06:58.920 --> 05:06:59.760
is still up there.

05:06:59.760 --> 05:07:01.360
Please call that number.

05:07:01.360 --> 05:07:04.760
Use that access code if you have a comment.

05:07:08.040 --> 05:07:11.360
Is there a public comment?

05:07:12.280 --> 05:07:13.920
We may have one public comment.

05:07:13.920 --> 05:07:15.960
I will open the phone line now.

05:07:17.560 --> 05:07:18.400
Good afternoon.

05:07:18.400 --> 05:07:20.000
Caller, please state your name and affiliation

05:07:20.000 --> 05:07:20.820
for the record.

05:07:20.820 --> 05:07:21.860
Your time starts now.

05:07:23.760 --> 05:07:24.960
Yes.

05:07:24.960 --> 05:07:25.960
Oh, am I muted?

05:07:27.200 --> 05:07:28.260
No.

05:07:28.260 --> 05:07:32.020
Are you calling in for regular consent items?

05:07:35.500 --> 05:07:36.340
Caller.

05:07:37.800 --> 05:07:38.920
You are live.

05:07:38.920 --> 05:07:40.360
Do you have a public comment?

05:07:44.880 --> 05:07:47.320
Okay, it looks like that concludes public comment.

05:07:50.160 --> 05:07:53.600
I'm wondering, we had heard from someone

05:07:53.600 --> 05:07:54.760
who was gonna call back,

05:07:54.760 --> 05:07:59.160
but we'll move ahead if we don't have anyone on the line.

05:07:59.160 --> 05:08:00.920
Member Strauss.

05:08:00.920 --> 05:08:03.360
Yeah, I just wanted to make one comment on item seven,

05:08:03.360 --> 05:08:06.800
which is emergency regulation on the physical fitness test.

05:08:06.800 --> 05:08:07.720
Just to make it clear,

05:08:07.720 --> 05:08:09.400
based on some of the letters we got,

05:08:09.400 --> 05:08:12.880
this is an emergency regulation for 120 days.

05:08:12.880 --> 05:08:13.720
That's all.

05:08:13.720 --> 05:08:16.480
So it affects the testing starting February 1st.

05:08:16.480 --> 05:08:19.360
And the superintendent will be working with interest

05:08:19.360 --> 05:08:22.520
and input to bring this back by November

05:08:22.520 --> 05:08:23.720
for an update to the board.

05:08:23.720 --> 05:08:26.000
So I just want to make it clear that it's temporary,

05:08:26.000 --> 05:08:28.800
short-term for this testing window.

05:08:28.800 --> 05:08:29.640
Thank you.

05:08:29.640 --> 05:08:30.480
Appreciate that.

05:08:31.720 --> 05:08:33.920
Seeing that there are no public comments,

05:08:33.920 --> 05:08:38.920
I'll ask for a motion on consent items five through 10.

05:08:39.120 --> 05:08:41.360
President Darwin-Yaman.

05:08:41.360 --> 05:08:42.180
Yes.

05:08:42.180 --> 05:08:43.020
I apologize.

05:08:43.020 --> 05:08:44.240
Because of the lag,

05:08:44.240 --> 05:08:46.720
it appears that we now have some callers in the queue.

05:08:46.720 --> 05:08:48.200
So we'd like to reopen public comment.

05:08:48.200 --> 05:08:51.240
I think there's a little bit of lag in the video stream.

05:08:52.360 --> 05:08:53.600
Okay.

05:08:53.600 --> 05:08:56.280
All right, let's hear our public comment.

05:08:56.280 --> 05:08:58.280
Okay, we have four people in the queue.

05:08:58.280 --> 05:09:01.000
I'm not sure if they want to speak towards the consent items,

05:09:01.000 --> 05:09:02.320
but we will see.

05:09:03.200 --> 05:09:04.880
Caller, please state your name

05:09:04.880 --> 05:09:06.120
and affiliation for the record.

05:09:06.120 --> 05:09:07.380
Your time starts now.

05:09:10.160 --> 05:09:13.000
Good afternoon, Jessica Sacco on behalf of Children Now

05:09:13.000 --> 05:09:15.560
calling in regards to consent item number five,

05:09:15.560 --> 05:09:17.200
the CSI plans.

05:09:17.200 --> 05:09:18.760
The board is being asked to approve

05:09:18.760 --> 05:09:20.540
almost all of the state's CSI plans

05:09:20.540 --> 05:09:22.840
without the plans being effectively reviewed.

05:09:22.840 --> 05:09:25.400
Federal law requires the state education agency

05:09:25.400 --> 05:09:27.600
to approve CSI plans.

05:09:27.600 --> 05:09:29.520
These plans are for the continuous improvement

05:09:29.520 --> 05:09:33.240
of the lowest performing 5% of schools in the state

05:09:33.240 --> 05:09:34.620
across multiple measures.

05:09:34.620 --> 05:09:36.280
It is not a responsibility

05:09:36.280 --> 05:09:37.960
that the board should take lightly.

05:09:37.960 --> 05:09:40.940
Unfortunately, the current process does exactly that.

05:09:40.940 --> 05:09:42.320
School sites develop their plans

05:09:42.320 --> 05:09:43.280
with their school districts.

05:09:43.280 --> 05:09:45.240
The district writes a short summary of these plans

05:09:45.240 --> 05:09:47.520
for all of the schools in the district in their LCAP.

05:09:47.520 --> 05:09:48.920
The COEs approve the LCAPs,

05:09:48.920 --> 05:09:52.200
which is interpreted as approving the CSI plans.

05:09:52.200 --> 05:09:55.760
Thus the board is being asked to reverse stamp the CSI plans.

05:09:55.760 --> 05:09:58.080
It is not sufficient oversight of the CSI plans

05:09:58.080 --> 05:09:59.440
as required by federal law.

05:10:00.360 --> 05:10:01.800
We recommend the board to delay action of approve

05:10:01.800 --> 05:10:03.720
of these plans to require the districts

05:10:03.720 --> 05:10:06.800
to submit the plans to the state to be reviewed formally.

05:10:06.800 --> 05:10:07.640
Thank you.

05:10:07.640 --> 05:10:08.480
Thank you.

05:10:10.000 --> 05:10:10.880
Good afternoon, caller.

05:10:10.880 --> 05:10:12.840
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:10:12.840 --> 05:10:14.020
Your time starts now.

05:10:16.700 --> 05:10:17.540
Good afternoon.

05:10:17.540 --> 05:10:18.640
My name is Michael Duba

05:10:18.640 --> 05:10:21.920
and I am a classroom teacher representing CTA.

05:10:21.920 --> 05:10:24.560
CTA would like to express our continued concerns

05:10:24.560 --> 05:10:27.780
with item 10, the funding determination process

05:10:27.780 --> 05:10:30.060
for non-classroom based charters.

05:10:30.060 --> 05:10:32.340
This process is broken and does not provide

05:10:32.340 --> 05:10:35.180
the level of transparency that we believe is needed

05:10:35.180 --> 05:10:37.180
for the commissioners of the ACCS,

05:10:37.180 --> 05:10:38.600
nor the members of the state board

05:10:38.600 --> 05:10:41.380
to provide appropriate public oversight

05:10:41.380 --> 05:10:43.820
on these funding determinations.

05:10:43.820 --> 05:10:48.820
The moratorium on the new NCBs has been extended until 2025.

05:10:48.940 --> 05:10:51.960
And we believe that this is the time for the CDE

05:10:51.960 --> 05:10:56.180
and the SBE to begin to renew and update the regulations

05:10:56.180 --> 05:10:58.260
that govern this process.

05:10:58.260 --> 05:11:00.460
And there are specific questions raised in our letter

05:11:00.460 --> 05:11:02.940
regarding the lack of transparency on the data

05:11:02.940 --> 05:11:04.820
within the FDF.

05:11:04.820 --> 05:11:09.260
This is a systematic issue within the NCB process.

05:11:09.260 --> 05:11:13.060
CTA looks forward to working with the CDE, SBE,

05:11:13.060 --> 05:11:16.140
and ACCS to fix this broken process.

05:11:16.140 --> 05:11:17.420
Thank you very much.

05:11:17.420 --> 05:11:18.260
Thank you.

05:11:20.340 --> 05:11:21.180
Good afternoon, caller.

05:11:21.180 --> 05:11:23.300
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:11:23.300 --> 05:11:24.520
Your time starts now.

05:11:26.180 --> 05:11:27.020
Thank you.

05:11:30.940 --> 05:11:31.780
Caller, you're live.

05:11:31.780 --> 05:11:34.060
Good afternoon, this is...

05:11:34.060 --> 05:11:34.880
Go ahead.

05:11:34.880 --> 05:11:35.720
Good afternoon.

05:11:35.720 --> 05:11:37.980
My name is Mara Lee Kincaid,

05:11:37.980 --> 05:11:42.100
and I'm a parent with several students

05:11:42.100 --> 05:11:44.620
that attend the San Juan Unified School District.

05:11:44.620 --> 05:11:48.520
And I'm calling in regards to the item for the district

05:11:48.520 --> 05:11:50.260
in regards to their waiver.

05:11:50.260 --> 05:11:53.380
And I'm, as a parent who has lived

05:11:53.380 --> 05:11:55.340
in the Arden Arcade area,

05:11:55.340 --> 05:12:00.340
I am not looking forward to their waiver request,

05:12:01.780 --> 05:12:03.420
not having a representative

05:12:03.420 --> 05:12:07.060
in the most disadvantaged area of the district,

05:12:07.060 --> 05:12:09.420
and the worst performing schools.

05:12:09.420 --> 05:12:12.580
It's not fair that we don't have a representative planned

05:12:12.580 --> 05:12:17.580
for until 2024 when all of the other new trustee areas

05:12:17.580 --> 05:12:20.940
with the vacancies will be getting theirs this year.

05:12:20.940 --> 05:12:24.220
So I'm calling to oppose that.

05:12:24.220 --> 05:12:25.140
Thank you.

05:12:25.140 --> 05:12:25.980
Thank you.

05:12:28.180 --> 05:12:29.020
Good afternoon, caller.

05:12:29.020 --> 05:12:31.140
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:12:31.140 --> 05:12:32.400
Your time starts now.

05:12:37.580 --> 05:12:39.380
Hello, my name is Chris Gentry,

05:12:39.380 --> 05:12:41.140
and I'm a physical education professor

05:12:41.140 --> 05:12:43.540
at California State University, San Bernardino,

05:12:43.540 --> 05:12:45.660
calling about item number seven.

05:12:45.660 --> 05:12:48.220
The reason for me calling is to express my concern

05:12:48.220 --> 05:12:49.500
about changing the PFT

05:12:49.500 --> 05:12:52.900
by removing body composition component of the test.

05:12:52.900 --> 05:12:54.940
Although I know this is not permanent,

05:12:55.740 --> 05:12:57.020
the purpose of the body composition portion of the test

05:12:57.020 --> 05:12:59.500
is to provide students and physical education teachers

05:12:59.500 --> 05:13:02.180
with the current measurement of this component of fitness

05:13:02.180 --> 05:13:04.580
to assist students with health improvements.

05:13:04.580 --> 05:13:06.380
This information is extremely valuable

05:13:06.380 --> 05:13:09.100
to assist students in making appropriate choices

05:13:09.100 --> 05:13:10.580
and supports a proactive approach

05:13:10.580 --> 05:13:12.700
by providing students with important information

05:13:12.700 --> 05:13:13.860
about their health.

05:13:13.860 --> 05:13:16.020
As a former elementary physical education teacher,

05:13:16.020 --> 05:13:19.540
I recall the impact that fitness information provided

05:13:19.540 --> 05:13:22.020
through physical education had for my students.

05:13:22.020 --> 05:13:24.420
It is important that students learn about body composition

05:13:24.420 --> 05:13:27.300
from a young age to make wise choices.

05:13:27.300 --> 05:13:28.700
Please consider removing changes

05:13:28.700 --> 05:13:31.560
to the body composition section of the PFT.

05:13:31.560 --> 05:13:33.100
Thank you very much for your time.

05:13:33.100 --> 05:13:34.580
Thank you.

05:13:34.580 --> 05:13:35.460
Good afternoon, caller.

05:13:35.460 --> 05:13:37.620
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:13:37.620 --> 05:13:38.900
Your time starts now.

05:13:42.500 --> 05:13:45.460
Hi, this is Christina Salazar with Californians Together.

05:13:45.460 --> 05:13:48.320
I am calling regarding item six.

05:13:48.320 --> 05:13:50.960
We support the change being requested in this item

05:13:50.960 --> 05:13:53.220
and understand the need for more flexibility.

05:13:54.460 --> 05:13:57.500
We do ask that, I'm talking to CDE staff,

05:13:57.500 --> 05:13:59.700
there could be a process for field input

05:13:59.700 --> 05:14:02.660
before the final approval of implementation.

05:14:02.660 --> 05:14:05.140
We request that as part of the motion

05:14:05.140 --> 05:14:07.820
to approve this item that the board requests a process

05:14:07.820 --> 05:14:12.180
to develop field input before implementation.

05:14:12.180 --> 05:14:13.000
Thank you.

05:14:13.000 --> 05:14:13.840
Thank you.

05:14:14.700 --> 05:14:15.560
Good afternoon, caller.

05:14:15.560 --> 05:14:17.580
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:14:17.580 --> 05:14:18.860
Your time starts now.

05:14:21.220 --> 05:14:22.540
Thank you.

05:14:22.540 --> 05:14:25.460
My name is Hillary Walters and I'm calling

05:14:25.460 --> 05:14:28.180
for Pacific Valley School.

05:14:29.420 --> 05:14:31.420
We are on item nine.

05:14:31.420 --> 05:14:34.260
We are facing a laxation and we would like to have

05:14:34.260 --> 05:14:37.620
our students speak up on their feelings about

05:14:38.580 --> 05:14:39.580
what it means to them.

05:14:40.340 --> 05:14:41.340
Here's our first student.

05:14:43.740 --> 05:14:45.700
My name is Yvonne. I'm calling for item nine.

05:14:45.700 --> 05:14:47.860
I'm a ninth grade student at Pacific Valley School

05:14:47.860 --> 05:14:49.980
and my mom was here when she was my age.

05:14:49.980 --> 05:14:51.820
One reason why Pacific Valley School needs

05:14:51.860 --> 05:14:54.420
to have the laxation waiver is because online school

05:14:54.420 --> 05:14:56.740
is not an option for kids who live in Big Sur.

05:14:56.740 --> 05:14:59.500
Tony Thurman tried to give children fast internet

05:14:59.500 --> 05:15:02.340
during COVID with the California Teleconnect Fund.

05:15:02.340 --> 05:15:04.580
However, Big Sur's current infrastructure will not

05:15:04.580 --> 05:15:07.020
support the best service nor is it cost effective

05:15:07.020 --> 05:15:08.660
for companies to install.

05:15:08.660 --> 05:15:11.020
Being online also can make you feel isolated and cut off

05:15:11.020 --> 05:15:12.540
from your community and loved ones.

05:15:12.540 --> 05:15:15.220
The isolation of Big Sur and the communities like this

05:15:15.220 --> 05:15:18.100
make it necessary for children to interact with their peers

05:15:18.100 --> 05:15:20.100
in a healthy and constructive environment

05:15:20.100 --> 05:15:21.220
such as a classroom.

05:15:21.260 --> 05:15:23.420
Being in a classroom environment helps me focus

05:15:23.420 --> 05:15:25.460
and helps me get into a productive state of mind.

05:15:25.460 --> 05:15:27.660
Please consider how important the school is to the kids

05:15:27.660 --> 05:15:30.020
of the Big Sur community and the positive impact

05:15:30.020 --> 05:15:31.540
it has on our present and our future.

05:15:33.700 --> 05:15:34.700
Thank you.

05:15:36.620 --> 05:15:37.860
Are there any other callers?

05:15:39.860 --> 05:15:40.860
Next.

05:15:40.860 --> 05:15:41.860
Oh.

05:15:41.860 --> 05:15:42.860
Hi my name's Alexander.

05:15:44.740 --> 05:15:45.740
Go ahead.

05:15:45.740 --> 05:15:46.740
Okay.

05:15:48.340 --> 05:15:49.340
Are they there?

05:15:49.340 --> 05:15:50.340
Yes they are.

05:15:51.340 --> 05:15:52.340
Hi.

05:15:52.340 --> 05:15:53.340
Hi.

05:15:53.340 --> 05:15:54.340
My name is Hannah.

05:15:55.100 --> 05:15:57.340
My name is Hannah and I'm calling for item 9

05:15:57.340 --> 05:15:58.900
and I'm a ninth grade high school student

05:15:58.900 --> 05:15:59.980
at Pacific Valley.

05:15:59.980 --> 05:16:01.660
Pacific Valley schools need to have a permanent

05:16:01.660 --> 05:16:03.660
lapsation waiver because the kids in the U.S.

05:16:03.660 --> 05:16:05.660
should have the right to a free public education

05:16:05.660 --> 05:16:06.980
without hardship.

05:16:06.980 --> 05:16:09.180
According to the forging amendment they should have

05:16:09.180 --> 05:16:12.300
equal education no matter the race ethnic background

05:16:12.820 --> 05:16:14.900
religion or gender or if they're rich or poor.

05:16:14.900 --> 05:16:16.580
It's more difficult for children to succeed

05:16:16.580 --> 05:16:18.260
in life without a proper education.

05:16:18.300 --> 05:16:21.740
The amendment states nor shall any state deprive

05:16:21.740 --> 05:16:25.380
any person of life liberty or property without due

05:16:25.380 --> 05:16:27.700
process of law nor denied to any person

05:16:27.700 --> 05:16:29.020
within its jurisdiction.

05:16:29.020 --> 05:16:30.380
The equal protection of laws.

05:16:30.380 --> 05:16:33.340
My my goal is to go to college and earn a business

05:16:33.340 --> 05:16:36.220
and without our school you will be taking my right

05:16:36.220 --> 05:16:37.660
of life liberty and property.

05:16:37.660 --> 05:16:39.060
In his decision for Brown v.

05:16:39.060 --> 05:16:41.660
the Board of Education Chief Justice Earl

05:16:42.380 --> 05:16:44.940
Chief Justice Earl Warren stated that the education

05:16:44.940 --> 05:16:47.140
is very foundations of good citizenship.

05:16:47.500 --> 05:16:52.060
mixture kids mixture kids are doing their

05:16:52.060 --> 05:16:53.980
part to be good citizens. Will you do yours.

05:16:55.980 --> 05:16:56.500
Thank you.

05:16:56.500 --> 05:16:58.460
Are there any other students who would like to speak.

05:17:00.180 --> 05:17:01.380
There are two more students.

05:17:01.940 --> 05:17:02.660
Okay thank you.

05:17:02.660 --> 05:17:04.940
Hi my name is Alexander Reyes.

05:17:05.700 --> 05:17:10.340
I'm from item 9 and I am a freshman at PV.

05:17:10.340 --> 05:17:14.140
I have lived through floods mud floods and wildfires.

05:17:14.180 --> 05:17:17.140
It's true. Our school is expensive to run.

05:17:17.140 --> 05:17:19.460
It's about a million bucks a year.

05:17:19.460 --> 05:17:21.700
However even though it's expensive we need

05:17:21.700 --> 05:17:22.900
the school to remain open.

05:17:23.580 --> 05:17:26.220
You cannot put a price on a young person's education.

05:17:26.900 --> 05:17:28.220
It is a necessary right.

05:17:29.540 --> 05:17:38.100
Your own California ED Code 6 6 0 1 0 1 2 Part A states

05:17:38.100 --> 05:17:42.700
that you must provide access to educate and an opportunity

05:17:42.740 --> 05:17:47.740
for educational success for all qualified Californians

05:17:48.300 --> 05:17:51.940
especially for those who are not represented in both

05:17:51.940 --> 05:17:58.100
graduating grades from high schools and their

05:17:58.100 --> 05:17:59.900
attendance at California College.

05:17:59.900 --> 05:18:01.060
That's me.

05:18:01.060 --> 05:18:04.340
I'll be the first dead Mexican-American in my

05:18:04.340 --> 05:18:06.060
family and I want an education.

05:18:07.500 --> 05:18:08.500
Thank you.

05:18:09.020 --> 05:18:10.020
All right.

05:18:10.020 --> 05:18:11.020
I.

05:18:11.020 --> 05:18:12.020
Hello.

05:18:12.020 --> 05:18:15.860
My name is Samantha and I'm calling for item 9.

05:18:16.540 --> 05:18:18.220
I was born and raised in Big Sur.

05:18:18.220 --> 05:18:20.100
My mother graduated from PV.

05:18:20.100 --> 05:18:21.980
There has been a school in Big Sur for as long

05:18:21.980 --> 05:18:23.460
as there have been people.

05:18:23.460 --> 05:18:26.220
Pacific Valley School has been a school since 1953.

05:18:26.220 --> 05:18:28.180
Before that Big Sur students were taught

05:18:28.180 --> 05:18:29.180
in the Redwood Schoolhouse.

05:18:29.740 --> 05:18:31.340
Living here is challenging.

05:18:31.340 --> 05:18:34.220
Between all the fires landslides and road closures

05:18:34.220 --> 05:18:36.540
even getting groceries is an all day task.

05:18:36.540 --> 05:18:38.340
Nevertheless we are resilient.

05:18:38.380 --> 05:18:40.380
The people of Big Sur are the only ones that fully

05:18:40.380 --> 05:18:43.580
understand the unique hardships that we face on a daily basis.

05:18:44.220 --> 05:18:47.140
The idea of letting our school go into laxation or to bring

05:18:47.140 --> 05:18:50.140
in an outside force to dictate our education is disregarding

05:18:50.140 --> 05:18:52.260
the unique these unique challenges that we face.

05:18:53.140 --> 05:18:55.220
For these reasons Pacific Valley School must be

05:18:55.220 --> 05:18:56.460
granted a laxation waiver.

05:18:57.060 --> 05:18:59.500
If the school went into laxation we would have to drive

05:18:59.500 --> 05:19:01.140
more than 110 miles a day.

05:19:01.140 --> 05:19:04.580
That is over four hours every day and 20 hours a week.

05:19:04.580 --> 05:19:07.700
According to the National Center for Education Statistics

05:19:07.700 --> 05:19:09.580
the average school day in California is a little

05:19:09.580 --> 05:19:11.860
over six hours or 30 hours a week.

05:19:12.380 --> 05:19:14.900
Sixty six percent of the time dedicated to school

05:19:14.900 --> 05:19:16.020
would be spent traveling.

05:19:17.540 --> 05:19:18.540
Thank you.

05:19:20.340 --> 05:19:22.740
Are there any more students or does that conclude your call.

05:19:24.420 --> 05:19:25.740
That concludes our call.

05:19:25.740 --> 05:19:28.140
But as you can tell we have excellent students

05:19:28.140 --> 05:19:29.860
and we really need this school open.

05:19:29.860 --> 05:19:30.860
Okay.

05:19:30.860 --> 05:19:31.860
Thank you very much.

05:19:34.340 --> 05:19:35.020
Good afternoon.

05:19:35.020 --> 05:19:37.420
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:19:37.500 --> 05:19:38.660
Your time starts now.

05:19:43.820 --> 05:19:44.740
Good afternoon Dr.

05:19:44.740 --> 05:19:46.220
Darling-Hammond and board members.

05:19:46.220 --> 05:19:48.860
Diana Zhu on behalf of the Association of California School

05:19:48.860 --> 05:19:51.620
Administrators actually would like to comment on item six.

05:19:51.620 --> 05:19:54.140
We support the continued use of remote administration

05:19:54.140 --> 05:19:56.860
for the CAPS and LPAC and appreciate the flexibility

05:19:56.860 --> 05:19:58.860
especially during these unprecedented times.

05:19:58.860 --> 05:20:01.380
Currently the proposed amendments to the regulations

05:20:01.380 --> 05:20:03.820
are in broadly and we suggest the language be clarified

05:20:03.820 --> 05:20:06.420
to ensure that the option for remote test sessions

05:20:06.700 --> 05:20:09.460
are at the LEA's discretion depending on student needs.

05:20:09.460 --> 05:20:11.660
Further instruction is also needed to avoid confusion

05:20:11.660 --> 05:20:14.540
on how to pursue remote administration of assessments.

05:20:14.540 --> 05:20:16.980
For these reasons I would suggest the regulations

05:20:16.980 --> 05:20:19.620
explicitly reference the test administration manual

05:20:19.620 --> 05:20:20.220
for guidance.

05:20:20.220 --> 05:20:21.220
Thank you.

05:20:21.220 --> 05:20:22.220
Thank you.

05:20:23.140 --> 05:20:24.740
Good afternoon caller please state your name

05:20:24.740 --> 05:20:25.980
and affiliation for the record.

05:20:25.980 --> 05:20:26.980
Your time starts now.

05:20:30.460 --> 05:20:32.020
Hello my name is Lorraine Richards

05:20:32.020 --> 05:20:34.460
and I am a classroom teacher representing

05:20:34.460 --> 05:20:36.300
California Teachers Association.

05:20:36.380 --> 05:20:38.420
I'm calling regarding item seven.

05:20:39.060 --> 05:20:43.060
CTA strongly supports efforts to eliminate gender bias

05:20:43.060 --> 05:20:46.620
and ableism from state testing and our schools in general.

05:20:46.620 --> 05:20:49.420
And we support CDE's proposal to modify

05:20:49.420 --> 05:20:52.020
the California physical fitness test by eliminating

05:20:52.020 --> 05:20:55.940
the body composition sub test and the related body

05:20:55.940 --> 05:20:57.780
composition healthy fitness zone.

05:20:57.780 --> 05:21:01.700
Additionally CTA strongly supports eliminating practices

05:21:01.700 --> 05:21:04.660
which negatively impact students personal body

05:21:04.700 --> 05:21:08.860
perception and endorses practices that support students

05:21:08.860 --> 05:21:10.900
emotional and mental well-being.

05:21:11.460 --> 05:21:14.460
Physical fitness is an important aspect of students growth

05:21:14.460 --> 05:21:17.820
and development and should lead to lifelong learning habits.

05:21:18.380 --> 05:21:22.300
Not feelings of shame isolation or inadequacy.

05:21:22.300 --> 05:21:23.300
Thank you.

05:21:23.300 --> 05:21:24.300
Thank you.

05:21:25.340 --> 05:21:26.900
Good afternoon caller please state your name

05:21:26.900 --> 05:21:28.260
and affiliation for the record.

05:21:28.260 --> 05:21:29.300
Your time starts now.

05:21:30.060 --> 05:21:31.500
My name is Denise Hopwell.

05:21:31.500 --> 05:21:35.180
I'm a physical educator and an MBCT teacher in L.A.

05:21:35.180 --> 05:21:36.180
USD.

05:21:36.180 --> 05:21:38.300
I'm calling you regarding item seven.

05:21:39.100 --> 05:21:42.220
The PFT scoring information the healthy fitness zone

05:21:42.220 --> 05:21:45.860
is used immediately in the classroom as science

05:21:45.860 --> 05:21:48.020
based individual information.

05:21:48.020 --> 05:21:51.140
Teachers provide meetings for each student about their

05:21:51.140 --> 05:21:54.180
current health related fitness status and assist

05:21:54.180 --> 05:21:56.420
in the formation of their personal goals and

05:21:56.540 --> 05:22:02.180
their actions both at school and at home.

05:22:02.860 --> 05:22:05.780
This provides each student with the individual support

05:22:05.780 --> 05:22:07.460
that they need equity.

05:22:08.260 --> 05:22:11.460
Further I recommend that the state board and the CDE

05:22:11.460 --> 05:22:14.260
work directly with state physical education leaders

05:22:14.260 --> 05:22:16.700
to further examine and address the gaps

05:22:16.700 --> 05:22:21.300
and implementation practices of this significant policy change.

05:22:21.300 --> 05:22:22.300
Thank you.

05:22:22.900 --> 05:22:23.900
Thank you.

05:22:24.900 --> 05:22:27.140
Good afternoon caller please state your name

05:22:27.140 --> 05:22:28.660
and affiliation for the record.

05:22:28.660 --> 05:22:30.420
You have one minute. Your time starts now.

05:22:34.700 --> 05:22:36.140
My name is Scott Rafferty.

05:22:36.140 --> 05:22:38.860
I called earlier to address waiver eight.

05:22:38.860 --> 05:22:41.700
I represent minority voters from Arden Arcade

05:22:41.700 --> 05:22:44.380
who petitioned San Juan to comply with the C.B.R.A.

05:22:44.380 --> 05:22:46.260
by creating seven trustee areas.

05:22:46.940 --> 05:22:50.020
This waiver denies them representation appointed

05:22:50.020 --> 05:22:53.300
or elected for almost five years after that petition

05:22:53.340 --> 05:22:55.740
which was filed in February 2020.

05:22:55.740 --> 05:22:58.980
The C.B.R.A. requires the minority areas have a priority

05:22:58.980 --> 05:23:00.620
in scheduling remedial elections.

05:23:00.620 --> 05:23:03.540
The district failed to appoint to the new seats

05:23:03.540 --> 05:23:06.860
and the county superintendent failed to call a special election

05:23:06.860 --> 05:23:08.020
when they did not.

05:23:08.020 --> 05:23:09.820
This waiver excuses all those duties

05:23:09.820 --> 05:23:12.660
so minority neighborhoods unrepresented for decades

05:23:12.660 --> 05:23:15.540
will not elect until about 2024.

05:23:15.540 --> 05:23:18.340
The matter is in court and the board should not change law

05:23:18.340 --> 05:23:21.300
in the middle of litigation to circumvent the remedial

05:23:21.300 --> 05:23:22.900
jurisdiction of that court.

05:23:23.700 --> 05:23:25.180
Thank you very much.

05:23:25.180 --> 05:23:26.500
Thank you.

05:23:26.500 --> 05:23:28.140
That concludes public comment.

05:23:33.060 --> 05:23:34.340
Thank you very much.

05:23:36.380 --> 05:23:38.620
Given that there is no further public comment,

05:23:38.620 --> 05:23:42.060
I will ask for a motion on consent items five through 10.

05:23:42.980 --> 05:23:43.980
Do I have a motion?

05:23:45.180 --> 05:23:47.980
I will move approval of consent items five through 10.

05:23:48.940 --> 05:23:49.940
Is there a second?

05:23:50.660 --> 05:23:51.500
Second.

05:23:54.660 --> 05:23:55.500
Thank you.

05:23:55.500 --> 05:23:57.460
We'll now hold a roll call.

05:23:57.460 --> 05:24:00.260
Brooke Brooks, can you please call the roll?

05:24:00.260 --> 05:24:01.100
Member Son.

05:24:03.700 --> 05:24:04.660
Aye.

Yes.

05:24:07.420 --> 05:24:08.260
Member Rucker.

05:24:09.500 --> 05:24:10.460
Yes.

05:24:10.460 --> 05:24:11.300
Member Rodriguez.

05:24:12.380 --> 05:24:13.500
Yes.

05:24:13.500 --> 05:24:14.700
Member Petillo-Brownson.

05:24:15.900 --> 05:24:16.820
Yes.

05:24:16.820 --> 05:24:17.700
Member McQuillan.

05:24:19.940 --> 05:24:21.020
Yes.

05:24:21.020 --> 05:24:22.420
Vice President Glover-Woods.

05:24:23.740 --> 05:24:24.820
Yes.

05:24:24.820 --> 05:24:25.660
Member Escobedo.

05:24:26.940 --> 05:24:28.020
Yes.

05:24:28.020 --> 05:24:29.260
President Darlene Hammond.

05:24:30.180 --> 05:24:31.140
Yes.

05:24:31.140 --> 05:24:32.700
Member Burr.

05:24:32.700 --> 05:24:33.700
Aye.

05:24:33.700 --> 05:24:34.540
Member Bonanca.

05:24:35.740 --> 05:24:36.820
Aye.

05:24:36.820 --> 05:24:38.220
Motion passed unanimously.

05:24:39.900 --> 05:24:41.420
Thank you.

05:24:41.420 --> 05:24:43.220
We are gonna move on to item 11,

05:24:43.220 --> 05:24:46.980
which is the 2022 United States Senate Youth Program,

05:24:46.980 --> 05:24:49.900
which recognizes California's selected student delegates

05:24:50.900 --> 05:24:54.580
and alternates, and the CDE recommends that we,

05:24:54.580 --> 05:24:58.140
that I and the SSPI, the state superintendent,

05:24:58.140 --> 05:25:02.100
recognize the selected 2022 U.S. Senate Youth Program

05:25:02.100 --> 05:25:03.180
delegates and alternates.

05:25:03.180 --> 05:25:04.900
What a joyful task.

05:25:04.900 --> 05:25:08.100
And this item will be presented by Dena Fong of the CDE.

05:25:09.180 --> 05:25:10.020
Dena.

05:25:14.980 --> 05:25:16.540
Thank you.

05:25:16.540 --> 05:25:19.180
Good afternoon, President Darlene Hammond,

05:25:19.340 --> 05:25:20.940
State Superintendent Thurman,

05:25:22.260 --> 05:25:25.180
honorable board members, and Chief Deputy Nicely.

05:25:25.180 --> 05:25:28.060
I'm Dena Fong, the United States Senate Youth Coordinator

05:25:28.060 --> 05:25:30.660
for the California Department of Education.

05:25:30.660 --> 05:25:32.860
It's my pleasure to be here today to introduce

05:25:32.860 --> 05:25:37.380
and recognize our 2022 U.S. Senate Youth students.

05:25:37.380 --> 05:25:40.940
The U.S. Senate Youth Program is sponsored by the U.S. Senate

05:25:40.940 --> 05:25:42.500
and funded and administered

05:25:42.500 --> 05:25:45.140
by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation.

05:25:45.140 --> 05:25:48.380
Now in its 60th year, the program provides an opportunity

05:25:48.380 --> 05:25:50.740
to selected students to gain an in-depth view

05:25:50.740 --> 05:25:52.980
of the Senate and the federal government,

05:25:52.980 --> 05:25:54.700
as well as provide a foundation

05:25:54.700 --> 05:25:57.180
for those considering a future in public service

05:25:57.180 --> 05:26:00.340
on the local, state, or national level.

05:26:00.340 --> 05:26:02.700
High school juniors and seniors are nominated

05:26:02.700 --> 05:26:04.140
by their principal to apply

05:26:04.140 --> 05:26:07.140
for this highly competitive merit-based program.

05:26:07.140 --> 05:26:09.740
To qualify, students must currently be serving

05:26:09.740 --> 05:26:12.340
in an elected or appointed leadership position

05:26:12.340 --> 05:26:15.180
in student government or a civic

05:26:15.180 --> 05:26:18.660
or educational organization representing constituency

05:26:18.660 --> 05:26:21.980
and serving others for the entire school year.

05:26:21.980 --> 05:26:25.060
Our students have gone through a rigorous application process

05:26:25.060 --> 05:26:28.180
and were selected based upon their leadership qualities,

05:26:28.180 --> 05:26:30.980
academic achievement, school and community involvement,

05:26:30.980 --> 05:26:33.060
and commitment to public service.

05:26:33.060 --> 05:26:35.740
The last phase of the program is to formally present

05:26:35.740 --> 05:26:39.380
our 2022 Senate Youth delegates and alternates.

05:26:39.380 --> 05:26:41.460
These students are among the best of the best

05:26:41.460 --> 05:26:43.860
in their school, community, and the state.

05:26:43.860 --> 05:26:46.420
There's no doubt they will succeed in whatever they do

05:26:46.420 --> 05:26:48.660
and will serve their communities with passion.

05:26:49.780 --> 05:26:52.700
Our two delegates will represent California

05:26:52.700 --> 05:26:56.100
during a virtual conference from March 5th through 10th,

05:26:56.100 --> 05:26:57.220
where they will participate

05:26:57.220 --> 05:26:59.900
in a comprehensive public service leadership

05:26:59.900 --> 05:27:02.420
and education experience, including speakers

05:27:02.420 --> 05:27:05.980
from the three branches of government and the national media.

05:27:05.980 --> 05:27:09.540
The delegates will each receive a $10,000 college scholarship

05:27:09.540 --> 05:27:12.140
for undergraduate studies with encouragement

05:27:12.140 --> 05:27:15.900
to study coursework in political science or history.

05:27:15.900 --> 05:27:17.420
Now I'd like to take a few minutes

05:27:17.420 --> 05:27:20.260
to introduce each student and give them each time

05:27:20.260 --> 05:27:22.140
to say a few words.

05:27:22.140 --> 05:27:25.300
Our first delegate is Jolene Bacalova,

05:27:26.260 --> 05:27:29.860
a junior at Citrus Valley High School in Redlands.

05:27:29.860 --> 05:27:33.420
She has been described as enthusiastic, diligent,

05:27:33.420 --> 05:27:36.060
and creative, as well as a remarkable person

05:27:36.060 --> 05:27:38.580
who enhances the world around.

05:27:38.580 --> 05:27:40.180
She currently serves as chair

05:27:40.180 --> 05:27:41.940
of the California High School Democrats,

05:27:42.780 --> 05:27:44.740
where she is the highest-ranking high school student

05:27:44.740 --> 05:27:46.180
and the youngest statewide leader

05:27:46.180 --> 05:27:48.380
in the California Democratic Party,

05:27:48.380 --> 05:27:50.380
leading 900-plus activists

05:27:50.380 --> 05:27:53.660
and 55-plus chapters across the state.

05:27:53.660 --> 05:27:56.140
She has interned for assembly-majority leader

05:27:56.140 --> 05:27:59.860
Eloise Gomez Reyes and UN Women Campaigns,

05:27:59.860 --> 05:28:03.740
a rising leader with the Office of American Law Alliance,

05:28:03.740 --> 05:28:05.660
and also president of her school's

05:28:05.660 --> 05:28:07.300
award-winning vocal department,

05:28:07.300 --> 05:28:11.260
where the choir has performed at Carnegie Hall

05:28:11.260 --> 05:28:13.780
and attained prestigious honors.

05:28:13.780 --> 05:28:15.860
She was one of 24 high school students

05:28:15.860 --> 05:28:17.740
selected worldwide to participate

05:28:17.740 --> 05:28:21.500
in Columbia University's social science summer program,

05:28:21.500 --> 05:28:23.940
where she conducted cross-cultural research

05:28:23.940 --> 05:28:26.420
on adolescents' views of government surveillance

05:28:26.420 --> 05:28:28.700
in China and the US.

05:28:28.700 --> 05:28:29.740
During the pandemic,

05:28:29.740 --> 05:28:31.700
in order to meet the needs of the community

05:28:31.700 --> 05:28:35.100
and the desires of students who wanted to volunteer,

05:28:35.100 --> 05:28:37.780
she founded a region-wide organization

05:28:37.780 --> 05:28:40.140
called Inland Teens Respond,

05:28:40.140 --> 05:28:42.620
to connect students with volunteer opportunities

05:28:42.620 --> 05:28:46.380
that could be accomplished with both digitally and in-person

05:28:46.380 --> 05:28:48.500
since many typical service opportunities

05:28:48.500 --> 05:28:50.620
for teens had been shut down.

05:28:50.620 --> 05:28:53.940
Jolaine desires to improve lives for disadvantaged families

05:28:53.940 --> 05:28:55.700
in different areas of the world

05:28:55.700 --> 05:28:58.500
with an emphasis on girls' education.

05:28:58.500 --> 05:29:00.980
She would like to major in global affairs

05:29:00.980 --> 05:29:02.940
and public international law,

05:29:02.940 --> 05:29:05.380
learn a security language like Arabic,

05:29:05.380 --> 05:29:07.540
and someday work for the Foreign Service

05:29:07.540 --> 05:29:08.940
in the State Department.

05:29:08.980 --> 05:29:11.180
Congratulations, Jolaine.

05:29:11.180 --> 05:29:12.460
Thank you, Mistina.

05:29:12.460 --> 05:29:14.900
It goes without being said that I am so honored

05:29:14.900 --> 05:29:17.340
and grateful to have been selected as a delegate.

05:29:18.300 --> 05:29:20.140
I'd like to thank the California Department

05:29:20.140 --> 05:29:23.380
of Education Selection Committee, the Hearst Foundation,

05:29:23.380 --> 05:29:24.660
and of course, the US Senate

05:29:24.660 --> 05:29:27.020
for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

05:29:27.020 --> 05:29:29.100
Growing up as the daughter of immigrants,

05:29:29.100 --> 05:29:31.180
I've always felt that those with the privilege

05:29:31.180 --> 05:29:32.820
of opportunities and resources

05:29:32.820 --> 05:29:35.380
have an inherent responsibility to improve the world.

05:29:35.380 --> 05:29:37.940
So I've been working adjacent to government policy

05:29:37.940 --> 05:29:41.340
to impact meaningful change since I was 13 years old.

05:29:41.340 --> 05:29:43.340
And from the beginning of my journey to now,

05:29:43.340 --> 05:29:44.660
I've been so lucky and blessed

05:29:44.660 --> 05:29:47.220
to have amazing mentors and supporters along the way,

05:29:47.220 --> 05:29:49.740
like my family and friends, my piano teacher,

05:29:49.740 --> 05:29:52.460
my school teachers, like Mrs. McKenzie and Ms. Moon,

05:29:52.460 --> 05:29:54.700
the administration at my high school, and so many others.

05:29:54.700 --> 05:29:56.860
I could not have gotten here without them.

05:29:56.860 --> 05:29:59.260
In the future, I'll definitely be working in public service,

05:29:59.260 --> 05:30:01.740
but I hope with the experience of this program

05:30:01.740 --> 05:30:03.660
that I can work in US foreign policy

05:30:03.660 --> 05:30:05.620
and like Mistina mentioned,

05:30:05.620 --> 05:30:07.780
impacting girls' education around the world.

05:30:07.780 --> 05:30:08.620
Thank you.

05:30:11.060 --> 05:30:12.220
Thank you, Jolene.

05:30:13.540 --> 05:30:18.140
Next, we have our second delegate, Sneha Revener,

05:30:18.140 --> 05:30:22.060
a senior at Evergreen Valley High School in San Jose.

05:30:22.060 --> 05:30:25.180
She has been described as capable and passionate,

05:30:25.180 --> 05:30:28.500
possessing a wisdom and maturity far beyond her years,

05:30:28.500 --> 05:30:30.580
and someone who will make substantial

05:30:30.580 --> 05:30:32.860
and lasting contributions to our society

05:30:32.860 --> 05:30:35.660
as a civic leader and public thinker.

05:30:35.660 --> 05:30:37.300
She serves as a student member

05:30:37.300 --> 05:30:39.740
of the Santa Clara County Office of Education

05:30:39.740 --> 05:30:42.940
Youth Advisory Group Core Advocacy Team,

05:30:42.940 --> 05:30:44.540
where she represents her peers

05:30:44.540 --> 05:30:47.180
in mental health related policy discussions

05:30:47.180 --> 05:30:50.060
through town halls, brainstorming legislation,

05:30:50.060 --> 05:30:53.020
research, and consulting with stakeholders.

05:30:53.020 --> 05:30:56.300
She is the founder and president of ENCODE Justice,

05:30:56.300 --> 05:31:00.380
a youth-led organization mobilizing 300 plus students

05:31:00.380 --> 05:31:03.060
in 25 countries for human rights

05:31:03.060 --> 05:31:05.580
in the age of artificial intelligence

05:31:06.500 --> 05:31:07.660
and a criminal justice lead

05:31:07.660 --> 05:31:09.780
of the High School Democrats of America's

05:31:09.780 --> 05:31:12.460
National Issue Advocacy Committee.

05:31:13.500 --> 05:31:16.660
As editor-in-chief of Students Against Voter Suppressions,

05:31:16.660 --> 05:31:21.260
Youth Digest, Sneha focuses on political journalism,

05:31:21.260 --> 05:31:24.540
writing and editing articles, and tracking bills.

05:31:24.540 --> 05:31:26.740
She is one of only two high school students

05:31:26.740 --> 05:31:28.580
with the Systemic Justice Project

05:31:28.580 --> 05:31:32.220
at Harvard Law School's Justice Initiative,

05:31:32.220 --> 05:31:35.420
a partnership between Harvard and Howard University

05:31:36.260 --> 05:31:38.420
to elevate social justice and legal education.

05:31:38.420 --> 05:31:42.140
Her awards include the Princeton Prize in Race Relations

05:31:42.140 --> 05:31:46.180
and an American Voices Medal nomination from Scholastic.

05:31:46.180 --> 05:31:49.460
Sneha plans to pursue political science in college,

05:31:49.460 --> 05:31:51.820
followed by law school with the desire

05:31:51.820 --> 05:31:54.660
to create a branch of civil rights litigation

05:31:54.660 --> 05:31:58.660
dedicated to redressing algorithm-driven discrimination

05:31:58.660 --> 05:32:00.780
and eventually running for office,

05:32:00.780 --> 05:32:04.380
focusing on a platform that empowers the working class

05:32:04.380 --> 05:32:08.580
and advances racial, social, and economic justice.

05:32:08.580 --> 05:32:10.020
Congratulations, Sneha.

05:32:11.180 --> 05:32:12.180
Thank you so much.

05:32:12.180 --> 05:32:13.900
Hi, my name is Sneha Ravenor.

05:32:13.900 --> 05:32:16.940
I'm a senior at Evergreen Valley High School in San Jose.

05:32:16.940 --> 05:32:18.140
I'm honored to have been selected

05:32:18.140 --> 05:32:20.060
as one of California's delegates

05:32:20.060 --> 05:32:21.980
to the 2022 U.S. Senate Youth Program,

05:32:21.980 --> 05:32:23.180
and I just want to thank all of you here

05:32:23.180 --> 05:32:24.300
at the State Board of Education

05:32:24.300 --> 05:32:26.260
for making this program a possibility.

05:32:26.260 --> 05:32:28.020
This opportunity will accelerate my journey

05:32:28.020 --> 05:32:29.500
in public service.

05:32:29.500 --> 05:32:31.340
One day, I hope to attend law school

05:32:31.340 --> 05:32:34.300
and work at the intersection of technology

05:32:35.180 --> 05:32:36.020
and equity.

05:32:36.020 --> 05:32:37.420
I might litigate 21st century civil rights violations

05:32:37.420 --> 05:32:39.380
that result from automated discrimination.

05:32:39.380 --> 05:32:41.220
My work could usher in a new era,

05:32:41.220 --> 05:32:43.260
that of the algorithmic justice lawyer,

05:32:43.260 --> 05:32:46.260
fighting tooth and nails uphold the public interest.

05:32:46.260 --> 05:32:48.900
I'd also love to someday run for public office.

05:32:48.900 --> 05:32:49.900
Through the Senate Youth Program,

05:32:49.900 --> 05:32:51.180
I'll have the opportunity to work

05:32:51.180 --> 05:32:53.380
to converse their nation's highest leaders,

05:32:53.380 --> 05:32:55.140
to enrich my understanding of political affairs,

05:32:55.140 --> 05:32:57.500
and to bring my goals closer to reality.

05:32:57.500 --> 05:32:59.020
I can't wait to see what this program brings,

05:32:59.020 --> 05:33:00.740
and once again, thank you all for your commitment

05:33:00.740 --> 05:33:01.940
to youth civic engagement.

05:33:01.940 --> 05:33:03.940
I'm so honored to be honored here today.

05:33:05.300 --> 05:33:06.140
Thank you.

05:33:08.140 --> 05:33:10.340
If Jolene or Sneha should be unable

05:33:10.340 --> 05:33:11.980
to participate in Washington Week,

05:33:11.980 --> 05:33:14.860
then one of our alternates will take their place.

05:33:14.860 --> 05:33:17.660
Our first alternate is Zachary Patterson,

05:33:17.660 --> 05:33:21.380
a senior at University City High School in San Diego.

05:33:21.380 --> 05:33:25.300
He has been described as a dedicated elected official

05:33:25.300 --> 05:33:26.980
who shows the passion and intention

05:33:26.980 --> 05:33:29.060
of a leader ready to fight for the success

05:33:29.060 --> 05:33:30.900
of his community.

05:33:30.900 --> 05:33:33.300
Zachary serves as the very first student member

05:33:34.300 --> 05:33:36.860
of the San Diego Unified School Board,

05:33:36.860 --> 05:33:40.340
a position he helped advocate for as the student voice,

05:33:40.340 --> 05:33:41.900
and has held for two years.

05:33:43.260 --> 05:33:45.820
He represents over 100,000 students

05:33:45.820 --> 05:33:48.860
in California's second largest school district.

05:33:48.860 --> 05:33:50.580
One of the key policies he's worked on

05:33:50.580 --> 05:33:52.580
was creating critical board policy

05:33:52.580 --> 05:33:54.940
protecting the mental health of students,

05:33:54.940 --> 05:33:57.860
as well as the policy requiring mental health education

05:33:57.860 --> 05:34:01.620
to be part of a core curriculum for all students.

05:34:01.620 --> 05:34:03.220
Zachary may look familiar to you

05:34:04.140 --> 05:34:04.980
because he was a recent finalist

05:34:04.980 --> 05:34:08.100
for the California State Student Board member position.

05:34:09.300 --> 05:34:10.820
He is the founder and president

05:34:10.820 --> 05:34:13.980
of the California Student Board Member Association,

05:34:13.980 --> 05:34:16.100
which brings together and provides training

05:34:16.100 --> 05:34:18.540
to elected student school board members

05:34:18.540 --> 05:34:23.260
who collectively represent 1.9 million students statewide.

05:34:23.260 --> 05:34:25.580
In addition, he is the first student member

05:34:25.580 --> 05:34:29.500
on the San Diego Unified Council of PTAs

05:34:29.500 --> 05:34:31.860
and a student member on the Chief Justice

05:34:32.500 --> 05:34:35.260
Power of Democracy Steering Committee.

05:34:35.260 --> 05:34:37.860
A passionate advocate who desires to make change,

05:34:37.860 --> 05:34:40.180
Zachary plans to major in political science

05:34:40.180 --> 05:34:43.140
with a focus on education policy and research.

05:34:43.140 --> 05:34:46.220
He desires to become an education policy leader

05:34:46.220 --> 05:34:48.300
and study underlying disparities

05:34:48.300 --> 05:34:51.540
in an effort to improve educational outcomes

05:34:51.540 --> 05:34:53.500
and close the opportunity gap.

05:34:53.500 --> 05:34:55.140
Congratulations, Zachary.

05:34:57.100 --> 05:34:57.920
Thank you.

05:34:57.920 --> 05:34:58.940
Good afternoon, everyone.

05:34:58.940 --> 05:35:00.420
I'm honored to have been a finalist

05:35:00.420 --> 05:35:01.820
for the U.S. Senate Youth Program

05:35:01.820 --> 05:35:03.700
and to be considered for this.

05:35:03.700 --> 05:35:04.780
As I look to the future,

05:35:04.780 --> 05:35:07.940
I hope to work in a similar field to all of you.

05:35:07.940 --> 05:35:09.380
Similar to what you were all discussing

05:35:09.380 --> 05:35:11.220
with the goals of community schools

05:35:11.220 --> 05:35:12.860
in one of our previous items,

05:35:12.860 --> 05:35:14.900
I'd like to more deeply discuss the outcomes

05:35:14.900 --> 05:35:16.540
to close the achievement gap

05:35:16.540 --> 05:35:18.820
as we know one size does not fit all.

05:35:18.820 --> 05:35:19.780
As I move into college,

05:35:19.780 --> 05:35:22.300
I hope to study political science and education

05:35:22.300 --> 05:35:24.220
and gain a stronger understanding

05:35:24.220 --> 05:35:26.860
of the state of education nationwide.

05:35:26.860 --> 05:35:29.740
Working in government challenges you to think analytically

05:35:29.740 --> 05:35:32.660
and in my own experiences as a member of a school board,

05:35:32.660 --> 05:35:35.060
this work is incredibly meaningful.

05:35:35.060 --> 05:35:36.780
One day I would love to be able to serve

05:35:36.780 --> 05:35:38.660
as a member of the state legislator

05:35:38.660 --> 05:35:41.620
and pursue a passion of mine of expanding school boards

05:35:41.620 --> 05:35:44.420
to include full voting rights for student board members,

05:35:44.420 --> 05:35:47.140
just like we have on the State Board of Education.

05:35:47.140 --> 05:35:50.460
It's a tall order, but if you will it, it's no dream.

05:35:50.460 --> 05:35:53.980
I'm super honored to be in this meeting today

05:35:53.980 --> 05:35:57.900
and to be able to be recognized for my work in education

05:35:57.900 --> 05:35:59.340
and I'd like to thank everybody

05:35:59.340 --> 05:36:01.300
who helped put this program together.

05:36:05.260 --> 05:36:06.380
Thank you, Zachary.

05:36:07.220 --> 05:36:10.100
Our second alternate is Jaden Stewart,

05:36:10.100 --> 05:36:13.700
a senior at North Hollywood High School in North Hollywood.

05:36:13.700 --> 05:36:15.700
He has been described as a passionate

05:36:15.700 --> 05:36:18.860
and assertive communicator and attentive listener

05:36:18.860 --> 05:36:21.220
who gets along with everyone because he listens

05:36:21.220 --> 05:36:23.540
and genuinely wants what's best,

05:36:23.540 --> 05:36:27.020
not just in this moment, but for all of our futures.

05:36:27.020 --> 05:36:30.340
He is a member of the Los Angeles Unified School District's

05:36:30.340 --> 05:36:33.540
Superintendent's Student Advisory Council,

05:36:33.540 --> 05:36:36.180
where he serves as Civic Engagement Committee Chair,

05:36:37.260 --> 05:36:39.540
taking the lead to introduce and implement

05:36:39.540 --> 05:36:42.220
the California State Seal of Civic Engagement

05:36:42.220 --> 05:36:44.020
within the district.

05:36:44.020 --> 05:36:47.620
He also serves as the inaugural student spokesperson

05:36:47.620 --> 05:36:51.020
for the LAUSD Student Empowerment Unit

05:36:51.020 --> 05:36:53.700
and is currently co-hosting the first district

05:36:53.740 --> 05:36:57.740
student-run podcast, Education Empowered.

05:36:57.740 --> 05:36:59.500
He is also the captain of his school's

05:36:59.500 --> 05:37:00.980
speech and debate team,

05:37:00.980 --> 05:37:03.860
a model United Nations delegate and mentor,

05:37:03.860 --> 05:37:06.060
and a first-year tenor saxophonist

05:37:06.060 --> 05:37:07.900
and part of the Herbie Hancock Jazz

05:37:07.900 --> 05:37:09.180
and the Classroom combo.

05:37:10.420 --> 05:37:12.300
Jaden, too, may be a familiar face

05:37:12.300 --> 05:37:13.980
since he was a top three finalist

05:37:13.980 --> 05:37:16.580
for the State Board of Education

05:37:16.580 --> 05:37:18.580
student board member position,

05:37:18.580 --> 05:37:20.740
as well as a runner-up for the LAUSD

05:37:20.740 --> 05:37:22.180
student board member position.

05:37:23.140 --> 05:37:25.500
Jaden plans to pursue a double major

05:37:25.500 --> 05:37:28.380
in political science and public policy

05:37:28.380 --> 05:37:31.180
with possible minors in history or rhetoric,

05:37:31.180 --> 05:37:32.820
followed by law school.

05:37:32.820 --> 05:37:35.900
His career goals include constitutional

05:37:35.900 --> 05:37:38.780
or civil rights law focusing on public service

05:37:38.780 --> 05:37:41.420
and improving international policy.

05:37:41.420 --> 05:37:42.860
Congratulations, Jaden.

05:37:44.340 --> 05:37:45.620
Thank you, Ms. Fong.

05:37:45.620 --> 05:37:48.180
Superintendent Thurmond, Dr. Darling Hammond,

05:37:48.180 --> 05:37:50.580
esteemed board and distinguished guests.

05:37:50.620 --> 05:37:52.940
It is a privilege to be here today.

05:37:52.940 --> 05:37:55.380
I am grateful to have been selected for this honor

05:37:55.380 --> 05:37:57.620
and inspired to continue the work

05:37:57.620 --> 05:37:59.580
of representing my community.

05:37:59.580 --> 05:38:03.300
As our world becomes increasingly tumultuous and complex,

05:38:03.300 --> 05:38:06.500
it will take compassionate leaders and public servants

05:38:06.500 --> 05:38:09.100
driven by empathy and determined to meet

05:38:09.100 --> 05:38:12.100
these unprecedented challenges head on.

05:38:12.100 --> 05:38:15.100
The greatest leaders are defined by how they respond

05:38:15.100 --> 05:38:16.860
during immense challenges,

05:38:16.860 --> 05:38:18.780
the ability to create hope

05:38:18.820 --> 05:38:20.780
in the direst of circumstances

05:38:20.780 --> 05:38:25.180
when it seems the most impossible is truly remarkable.

05:38:25.180 --> 05:38:28.020
I will continually work to achieve this ideal,

05:38:28.020 --> 05:38:30.300
whether it be as a public servant in the courtroom

05:38:30.300 --> 05:38:33.900
or in Congress and will strive to always use truth

05:38:33.900 --> 05:38:37.140
and wisdom to enhance the lives of others.

05:38:37.140 --> 05:38:40.180
I'm excited to see where the next step in my journey leads

05:38:40.180 --> 05:38:42.460
as I continue to do the arduous work

05:38:42.460 --> 05:38:45.740
of creating positive change for all people.

05:38:45.740 --> 05:38:46.580
Thank you.

05:38:49.620 --> 05:38:54.620
Congratulations, Jayden, thank you very much.

05:38:55.180 --> 05:38:58.340
Once again, congratulations to all four of our students.

05:38:58.340 --> 05:39:00.580
What I've shared is a small sampling

05:39:00.580 --> 05:39:03.180
of all that they've accomplished.

05:39:03.180 --> 05:39:05.140
And I just wanna add that all of the students

05:39:05.140 --> 05:39:09.060
have been described by their teacher advisor or colleague

05:39:09.060 --> 05:39:12.220
as somebody who stands out from the rest of the group

05:39:12.220 --> 05:39:15.260
as evidence from what you've heard today.

05:39:15.260 --> 05:39:16.780
So I think we can feel confident

05:39:16.780 --> 05:39:21.020
of what they're going to accomplish in the future.

05:39:21.020 --> 05:39:23.460
So I will turn this back to President Darling-Hammond

05:39:23.460 --> 05:39:25.220
and State Superintendent Thurman

05:39:25.220 --> 05:39:27.420
and the other board members to offer congratulations.

05:39:27.420 --> 05:39:28.340
Thank you so much.

05:39:29.460 --> 05:39:31.980
Well, I'll start off by offering congratulations

05:39:31.980 --> 05:39:34.940
and it's very inspiring to think about the roles

05:39:34.940 --> 05:39:39.940
that you will step into and provide leadership for

05:39:40.020 --> 05:39:40.860
in the future.

05:39:40.860 --> 05:39:45.860
So we're excited about both your current situations

05:39:46.660 --> 05:39:49.660
and opportunities and for what you will bring

05:39:49.660 --> 05:39:51.860
to the rest of us in the future.

05:39:51.860 --> 05:39:55.140
I'm going to open the public comment line in a moment

05:39:55.140 --> 05:39:57.860
and I'd like to get the public comments slide up,

05:39:57.860 --> 05:40:00.700
but I will pass the ball in the meantime

05:40:00.700 --> 05:40:02.740
to State Superintendent Tony Thurman.

05:40:03.860 --> 05:40:06.700
Well, thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

05:40:06.700 --> 05:40:09.740
Wow, to say that our future looks bright

05:40:09.740 --> 05:40:11.340
is an understatement.

05:40:11.340 --> 05:40:13.140
I could not have more confidence

05:40:13.140 --> 05:40:14.740
in where things are gonna go for us in the future

05:40:14.740 --> 05:40:18.900
with the representation that we have seen and heard today.

05:40:18.900 --> 05:40:23.660
Senator Bakhlova, sorry, Senator Revenor

05:40:23.660 --> 05:40:28.060
and Senator Alternate Patterson and Stewart,

05:40:28.060 --> 05:40:29.740
incredible comments.

05:40:29.740 --> 05:40:31.340
You're very distinguished.

05:40:31.340 --> 05:40:33.700
We can't wait for the day when you actually

05:40:33.700 --> 05:40:36.460
are representing us in the respective places

05:40:36.460 --> 05:40:40.380
and government and public service that you choose to head to.

05:40:40.380 --> 05:40:43.980
It is inspiring to hear about the intersection of law

05:40:43.980 --> 05:40:47.060
and technology and public service

05:40:47.060 --> 05:40:50.700
and, of course, the way you all have engaged other young voices

05:40:50.700 --> 05:40:53.500
to be involved in the decision-making process.

05:40:53.500 --> 05:40:55.820
Thank you for what each and every one of you is doing.

05:40:55.820 --> 05:40:58.100
Congratulations, it was an honor to talk with you

05:40:58.100 --> 05:40:59.580
at the time of your selection.

05:40:59.580 --> 05:41:00.860
It's an honor to speak with you now

05:41:00.860 --> 05:41:02.620
and to hear the wonderful things you're doing.

05:41:02.620 --> 05:41:03.860
We are in your court,

05:41:03.860 --> 05:41:05.300
and in any way that we can be helpful to you,

05:41:05.300 --> 05:41:06.580
please call on us.

05:41:06.580 --> 05:41:08.980
Congratulations again, young senators,

05:41:08.980 --> 05:41:10.860
and we look forward to the day when you become senators

05:41:10.860 --> 05:41:12.180
and represent all of us.

05:41:12.260 --> 05:41:13.660
Well done, congratulations.

05:41:16.660 --> 05:41:19.140
And I think we're going to open up the phone line

05:41:19.140 --> 05:41:21.140
for public comment if there are any.

05:41:21.140 --> 05:41:23.500
Members of the public wishing to provide comment

05:41:23.500 --> 05:41:25.740
can do so by calling the telephone number

05:41:25.740 --> 05:41:28.020
and using the access code provided on the slide

05:41:28.020 --> 05:41:29.940
that's shown now.

05:41:29.940 --> 05:41:33.380
And so let's see if we have any public comment.

05:41:33.380 --> 05:41:35.780
We do have one person signed up for public comment.

05:41:35.780 --> 05:41:38.180
I will open the phone line now.

05:41:38.180 --> 05:41:39.540
Good afternoon, caller.

05:41:39.540 --> 05:41:41.740
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

05:41:41.740 --> 05:41:42.580
We have one minute.

05:41:42.580 --> 05:41:43.660
Your time starts now.

05:41:47.940 --> 05:41:49.740
Yeah, my name is Brian Adams.

05:41:49.740 --> 05:41:52.380
I'm with Advocates Education Partners.

05:41:52.380 --> 05:41:55.940
I'm a financial consultant for Eagle Collegiate Academy,

05:41:55.940 --> 05:41:56.780
and I've been-

05:41:56.780 --> 05:41:57.620
Oh, wrong item.

05:41:57.620 --> 05:41:59.540
I'm sorry to interrupt.

05:41:59.540 --> 05:42:02.180
I believe you want to speak towards the next item,

05:42:02.180 --> 05:42:03.180
item number 12.

05:42:03.180 --> 05:42:05.340
We would ask that you please call back in.

05:42:06.940 --> 05:42:08.180
Okay, okay.

05:42:08.180 --> 05:42:09.860
Okay, thank you so much.

05:42:09.860 --> 05:42:10.740
Bye bye.

05:42:10.740 --> 05:42:11.580
Thank you.

05:42:14.700 --> 05:42:15.980
All right.

05:42:15.980 --> 05:42:17.300
Any other public comment?

05:42:19.820 --> 05:42:21.660
There may be one more.

05:42:21.660 --> 05:42:23.140
Just one moment.

05:42:23.140 --> 05:42:24.100
Good afternoon, caller.

05:42:24.100 --> 05:42:26.340
Please say your name and affiliation for the record.

05:42:26.340 --> 05:42:27.460
You have one minute.

05:42:27.460 --> 05:42:28.780
Your time starts now.

05:42:32.740 --> 05:42:35.300
Hello, my name is Adriana.

05:42:36.540 --> 05:42:38.700
Good afternoon, State Board of Education.

05:42:38.700 --> 05:42:40.460
I am a special education parent.

05:42:41.180 --> 05:42:43.140
I wanted to thank, call me.

05:42:43.140 --> 05:42:45.340
I'm sorry, caller, I have to interrupt.

05:42:45.340 --> 05:42:47.340
We are currently on item number 11,

05:42:47.340 --> 05:42:50.460
Senate Youth Delegates and Alternates.

05:42:50.460 --> 05:42:51.660
If you don't mind calling back in

05:42:51.660 --> 05:42:55.340
for a general public comment, that's item number 13.

05:42:55.340 --> 05:42:56.180
Thank you so much.

05:42:56.180 --> 05:42:57.020
Yes, sorry.

05:42:58.340 --> 05:42:59.700
Okay, President Darlene Hammond,

05:42:59.700 --> 05:43:02.420
that concludes public comment for this item.

05:43:02.420 --> 05:43:04.020
Yeah, I think we're running a little behind

05:43:04.020 --> 05:43:05.260
our planned schedule,

05:43:05.260 --> 05:43:08.380
so people are anxious to get their comments in.

05:43:08.380 --> 05:43:11.300
Meanwhile, I do want to open up the floor

05:43:11.300 --> 05:43:14.180
if there are any comments from board members

05:43:14.180 --> 05:43:17.620
as we conclude this item.

05:43:17.620 --> 05:43:20.940
And I will start with Member Bonanca,

05:43:20.940 --> 05:43:23.180
and then Member Strauss, Member McQuillan,

05:43:23.180 --> 05:43:25.900
Member Rucker, and Member Clover Woods.

05:43:25.900 --> 05:43:28.060
Thank you, President Darlene Hammond.

05:43:28.060 --> 05:43:30.740
I just have to give such a huge congratulations

05:43:30.740 --> 05:43:34.300
to all of the students selected for this program.

05:43:34.300 --> 05:43:38.220
You all are so incredible and talented and accomplished,

05:43:39.060 --> 05:43:41.940
and you have truly demonstrated an incredible commitment

05:43:41.940 --> 05:43:43.900
to serving your community.

05:43:43.900 --> 05:43:46.060
I've personally had the pleasure of getting to know

05:43:46.060 --> 05:43:47.700
two of the four students here.

05:43:47.700 --> 05:43:50.540
And as Superintendent Thurmond stated,

05:43:50.540 --> 05:43:53.180
these students give me full confidence

05:43:53.180 --> 05:43:55.500
that our future is in the best of hands.

05:43:55.500 --> 05:43:58.580
And so I know that these students are not only going

05:43:58.580 --> 05:44:00.220
to be the future leaders of our state,

05:44:00.220 --> 05:44:02.900
but also the future leaders of our nation.

05:44:02.900 --> 05:44:06.180
Once again, congratulations to all of the students selected.

05:44:09.220 --> 05:44:12.820
And the next person in the queue is Member Strauss,

05:44:12.820 --> 05:44:17.100
and then Member McQuillan, Member Rucker, Member Clover Woods.

05:44:17.100 --> 05:44:21.140
So I just wanna thank the four students who are here,

05:44:21.140 --> 05:44:24.940
and for your articulate comments, for your commitment,

05:44:24.940 --> 05:44:27.860
and for what the future holds for you,

05:44:27.860 --> 05:44:31.540
and for the representation that you have of students

05:44:31.540 --> 05:44:34.300
in our high schools for our future.

05:44:34.300 --> 05:44:38.340
It is so hopeful to listen to how articulate you are,

05:44:38.340 --> 05:44:39.860
how hopeful you are,

05:44:39.860 --> 05:44:42.740
your motivation for equity and social justice.

05:44:42.740 --> 05:44:47.740
And I look forward to your being our elected officials

05:44:47.860 --> 05:44:52.100
and your voice, both in your post-secondary opportunity

05:44:52.100 --> 05:44:53.860
and in your career after that.

05:44:53.860 --> 05:44:55.580
I think we will hear a lot from you.

05:44:55.580 --> 05:44:57.740
And I have to say, as a member of the Board,

05:44:57.740 --> 05:45:00.220
we are so appreciative of everything you do

05:45:00.220 --> 05:45:04.060
to empower student voice and decision-making

05:45:04.060 --> 05:45:06.060
and your local and at the state level.

05:45:06.060 --> 05:45:06.900
So thank you.

05:45:06.900 --> 05:45:09.660
It just makes me proud and hopeful for the future.

05:45:09.660 --> 05:45:10.500
Thank you.

05:45:12.700 --> 05:45:13.940
Member McQuillan.

05:45:14.780 --> 05:45:17.380
Yeah, so I just wanna echo what I heard

05:45:17.380 --> 05:45:19.540
from the other Board members and our superintendent.

05:45:19.540 --> 05:45:21.500
I'm just so proud of all of you.

05:45:21.500 --> 05:45:22.820
It's great to see you again.

05:45:22.820 --> 05:45:25.860
I saw some of you as finalists in the student conference

05:45:25.860 --> 05:45:27.300
a couple months back.

05:45:27.300 --> 05:45:31.420
So, and you would have my vote if you're running for office

05:45:31.420 --> 05:45:32.460
after what I've heard,

05:45:32.780 --> 05:45:36.060
or I would hire you when you become that attorney.

05:45:36.060 --> 05:45:37.300
So thank you very much.

05:45:37.300 --> 05:45:38.900
Very impressed.

05:45:38.900 --> 05:45:40.180
Awesome.

05:45:40.180 --> 05:45:42.460
Member Rucker, then member Glover-Woods,

05:45:42.460 --> 05:45:43.780
member Rodriguez.

05:45:44.860 --> 05:45:45.700
Member Rucker.

05:45:45.700 --> 05:45:46.860
Well, good afternoon.

05:45:46.860 --> 05:45:49.020
I want to add my congratulations

05:45:49.020 --> 05:45:50.540
to what you've already heard.

05:45:50.540 --> 05:45:52.140
You've probably been very accustomed

05:45:52.140 --> 05:45:54.300
to hearing praises peeped upon you,

05:45:54.300 --> 05:45:56.700
but I'm very excited about the future

05:45:56.700 --> 05:45:59.380
that you have laid out in plans for yourself.

05:45:59.380 --> 05:46:01.580
And I, just like a Board member McQuillan,

05:46:01.580 --> 05:46:04.940
I would vote for you or I would hire you as my attorney

05:46:04.940 --> 05:46:08.060
because I appreciate the confidence that you express,

05:46:08.060 --> 05:46:09.900
not only about the work that you wanna do,

05:46:09.900 --> 05:46:12.140
but what you know can be accomplished.

05:46:12.140 --> 05:46:14.060
And I truly appreciate that.

05:46:14.060 --> 05:46:19.060
I also want to give appreciation to the community,

05:46:19.780 --> 05:46:22.540
family and friends and your school

05:46:22.540 --> 05:46:26.380
that definitely supported you and collaborated with you

05:46:26.380 --> 05:46:28.580
on helping you to get to this moment

05:46:28.580 --> 05:46:30.340
and to support your dream.

05:46:30.860 --> 05:46:32.660
I know that your parents are quite proud,

05:46:32.660 --> 05:46:35.420
but I want to let your parents know how proud I am

05:46:35.420 --> 05:46:38.260
as a former classroom teacher of what it meant

05:46:38.260 --> 05:46:40.860
for them to do the work to support you as well.

05:46:40.860 --> 05:46:44.180
So they participate in winning these accolades

05:46:44.180 --> 05:46:45.020
along with you.

05:46:45.020 --> 05:46:46.780
And I want to make sure you know

05:46:46.780 --> 05:46:49.620
I'll be cheering for you from the side.

05:46:49.620 --> 05:46:51.620
And I hope you continue to do well

05:46:51.620 --> 05:46:53.740
and continue to look forward

05:46:53.740 --> 05:46:55.540
to a bright and wonderful future.

05:46:56.820 --> 05:46:57.660
Thank you.

05:46:57.660 --> 05:46:59.740
Member Glover-Woods and then member Rodriguez.

05:47:00.900 --> 05:47:04.820
Well, again, I say congratulations and thank you

05:47:04.820 --> 05:47:07.900
for sharing your ideas, your vision

05:47:07.900 --> 05:47:10.820
and your dreams with us this afternoon.

05:47:10.820 --> 05:47:12.820
As I listened to each and every one of you,

05:47:12.820 --> 05:47:17.820
my heart just got full on just hearing 21st century leaders

05:47:18.380 --> 05:47:20.500
now and knowing how you will be leading

05:47:20.500 --> 05:47:22.620
in the decades to come.

05:47:22.620 --> 05:47:26.140
Our world is in some very good and capable hands

05:47:26.140 --> 05:47:29.220
and I just wish you all the best as you move forward

05:47:29.220 --> 05:47:31.060
in your representation in the conference,

05:47:31.060 --> 05:47:34.060
but also as you move forward in life.

05:47:34.060 --> 05:47:36.340
And I look forward to hearing more

05:47:36.340 --> 05:47:38.540
about the wonderful things you are doing

05:47:38.540 --> 05:47:41.540
and about the wonderful way you'll be impacting our world.

05:47:41.540 --> 05:47:43.900
Thank you so much for sharing yourselves today.

05:47:45.700 --> 05:47:46.540
Thank you.

05:47:46.540 --> 05:47:48.220
And member Rodriguez.

05:47:48.220 --> 05:47:51.180
Yes, I just want to echo the congratulations

05:47:51.180 --> 05:47:54.100
and let you know how inspired I feel by you

05:47:54.100 --> 05:47:56.060
and your leadership.

05:47:56.060 --> 05:48:01.060
And I love that you are leading with inclusion

05:48:01.860 --> 05:48:04.420
and compassion that just shines through

05:48:04.420 --> 05:48:05.500
and thinking about others.

05:48:05.500 --> 05:48:07.580
So I wish you all the best

05:48:07.580 --> 05:48:12.580
and I can't wait to read more about all that you're doing

05:48:12.580 --> 05:48:16.260
and the grandchildren of our board members

05:48:16.260 --> 05:48:17.540
that were mentioned this morning,

05:48:17.540 --> 05:48:19.060
I think are in good hands

05:48:19.060 --> 05:48:20.620
if you're going to be leading our future.

05:48:20.620 --> 05:48:22.900
So I'm hopeful as well.

05:48:23.900 --> 05:48:26.860
I'm particularly invested in that aspiration.

05:48:26.860 --> 05:48:27.700
Thank you.

05:48:28.540 --> 05:48:31.380
So with that, we really want to thank you all.

05:48:31.380 --> 05:48:33.940
We want to applaud you

05:48:33.940 --> 05:48:36.620
and thank you, Dena, for presenting the item.

05:48:40.340 --> 05:48:41.700
Thank you very much.

05:48:44.740 --> 05:48:49.340
And with that, we're going to move ahead to item number 12.

05:48:49.380 --> 05:48:53.820
And I will just flag that we are behind the schedule

05:48:53.820 --> 05:48:55.260
that people were anticipating.

05:48:55.260 --> 05:48:59.300
So some of the callers for the next several items,

05:48:59.300 --> 05:49:03.540
I think are waiting anxiously to call back in.

05:49:04.540 --> 05:49:08.180
Agenda item 12 regarding EGLE Collegiate Academy.

05:49:09.220 --> 05:49:11.140
Consider issuing a notice of violation

05:49:11.140 --> 05:49:15.140
pursuant to California Education Code Section 47607G

05:49:15.780 --> 05:49:19.700
is the item that's before us.

05:49:19.700 --> 05:49:22.860
It will be presented by Stephanie Farland of the CDE

05:49:22.860 --> 05:49:24.900
and Stephanie, I'll let you explain it.

05:49:26.340 --> 05:49:28.100
Go ahead and begin.

05:49:28.100 --> 05:49:29.180
Great, thank you.

05:49:30.220 --> 05:49:32.220
Good afternoon, President Darling-Hammond,

05:49:32.220 --> 05:49:35.180
State Board members, State Superintendent Thurmond

05:49:35.180 --> 05:49:37.020
and Chief Deputy Mary Nicely.

05:49:37.020 --> 05:49:38.380
It's good to be here today.

05:49:39.580 --> 05:49:41.300
I apologize in advance for my voice.

05:49:41.300 --> 05:49:42.540
I'm a little under the weather

05:49:42.540 --> 05:49:44.100
and it sounds a little froggy.

05:49:46.100 --> 05:49:48.140
If it's annoying, if it's too annoying,

05:49:48.140 --> 05:49:50.740
I can have another one of my staff members jump in.

05:49:52.020 --> 05:49:54.020
Before I jump into the item,

05:49:54.020 --> 05:49:59.020
I just want to give my own thank you to members Burr, Son,

05:49:59.220 --> 05:50:01.700
Rucker and Strauss for all the wisdom and guidance

05:50:01.700 --> 05:50:06.180
that you have provided for the many years

05:50:06.180 --> 05:50:07.020
you've been on the Board,

05:50:07.020 --> 05:50:09.020
but also just specifically for me,

05:50:09.020 --> 05:50:11.740
the last two years I've been with the department.

05:50:11.740 --> 05:50:15.180
It's been invaluable, so I appreciate it.

05:50:15.180 --> 05:50:17.060
Thank you so much.

05:50:17.060 --> 05:50:20.820
So today we are coming before the Board

05:50:23.540 --> 05:50:27.380
to ask the Board to issue a notice of violation,

05:50:27.380 --> 05:50:30.060
if we can move on the slide, please,

05:50:33.420 --> 05:50:35.580
for Eagle Collegiate Academy.

05:50:35.580 --> 05:50:37.060
And Eagle Collegiate Academy

05:50:37.060 --> 05:50:41.340
is a currently authorized charter school,

05:50:41.380 --> 05:50:43.660
authorized by the State Board of Education.

05:50:43.660 --> 05:50:46.340
They were authorized in July of 2020.

05:50:47.300 --> 05:50:51.740
Pursuant to Education Code Section 47607G,

05:50:51.740 --> 05:50:54.580
before revocation as the charter school authorizer,

05:50:54.580 --> 05:50:57.340
the State Board shall notify the school of any violation

05:50:57.340 --> 05:50:59.580
and provide the school a reasonable opportunity

05:50:59.580 --> 05:51:01.580
to remedy the violations.

05:51:01.580 --> 05:51:05.180
Today we are going to list out some of those violations

05:51:05.180 --> 05:51:08.260
and at the end ask for the Board

05:51:08.260 --> 05:51:10.580
to issue a notice of violation,

05:51:10.580 --> 05:51:14.100
which is a letter and it is in your attachment.

05:51:18.180 --> 05:51:21.500
There are many reasons why the Board can't,

05:51:21.500 --> 05:51:24.340
why a charter can be revoked

05:51:24.340 --> 05:51:25.980
by the authority that granted the charter,

05:51:25.980 --> 05:51:29.020
which in this case is the State Board of Ed.

05:51:29.020 --> 05:51:32.260
The following reasons are committed to material violation

05:51:32.260 --> 05:51:34.260
of any of the conditions, standards, or procedures

05:51:34.260 --> 05:51:35.900
set forth in the charter,

05:51:35.900 --> 05:51:38.780
fail to meet or pursue any of the people outcomes

05:51:38.780 --> 05:51:40.540
identified in the charter,

05:51:41.500 --> 05:51:45.180
fail to meet generally accepted accounting principles

05:51:45.180 --> 05:51:47.380
or engage in fiscal mismanagement

05:51:47.380 --> 05:51:49.700
or violated any provision of law.

05:51:51.700 --> 05:51:52.540
Next slide.

05:51:54.220 --> 05:51:55.980
There is substantial evidence

05:51:55.980 --> 05:51:59.340
that Eagle Collegiate Academy has engaged in the following,

05:51:59.340 --> 05:52:02.740
fiscal mismanagement, material violations

05:52:02.740 --> 05:52:04.340
of the charter petition

05:52:04.340 --> 05:52:06.940
and violations of provisions of law.

05:52:10.540 --> 05:52:13.020
Our recommendation today will be

05:52:13.020 --> 05:52:15.620
that the State Board of Ed consider issuing

05:52:15.620 --> 05:52:18.620
a notice of violation to Eagle Collegiate Academy

05:52:18.620 --> 05:52:21.820
pursuant to Ed Code section 47607.

05:52:25.340 --> 05:52:27.140
Just to give you a little background

05:52:27.140 --> 05:52:28.620
on the revocation process,

05:52:28.620 --> 05:52:31.700
I know many of you have not gone through that before.

05:52:33.420 --> 05:52:36.460
This first step of the revocation process

05:52:36.460 --> 05:52:38.100
is this notice of violation.

05:52:39.100 --> 05:52:41.260
It does not mean that the school

05:52:41.260 --> 05:52:42.820
will eventually be revoked.

05:52:42.820 --> 05:52:44.580
What the notice of violation is,

05:52:45.500 --> 05:52:48.460
is it allows the charter school

05:52:48.460 --> 05:52:52.260
to present evidence that refutes remedies

05:52:52.260 --> 05:52:54.900
or proposes to remedy the alleged violations.

05:52:55.820 --> 05:52:57.900
They will do this at the February 8th

05:52:57.900 --> 05:53:00.540
Advisory Commission on Charter Schools meeting.

05:53:01.860 --> 05:53:04.300
The ACCS will make a recommendation,

05:53:04.300 --> 05:53:06.260
will take action and make a recommendation

05:53:06.260 --> 05:53:09.860
to the State Board that will be either to continue

05:53:09.860 --> 05:53:12.540
or discontinue the revocation process.

05:53:12.540 --> 05:53:14.740
So this first step is just to give them

05:53:14.740 --> 05:53:19.740
the opportunity to respond to our notice of violation.

05:53:24.140 --> 05:53:26.260
If the recommendation is to continue

05:53:26.260 --> 05:53:28.020
with the revocation process,

05:53:28.020 --> 05:53:31.380
this action will be presented to the State Board of Ed

05:53:31.380 --> 05:53:34.100
at its March 9th and 10th meeting.

05:53:34.380 --> 05:53:37.220
And it is at that meeting that the State Board will decide

05:53:37.220 --> 05:53:42.180
if it should issue a notice of intent to revoke

05:53:42.180 --> 05:53:44.820
and then take action to revoke the charter petition.

05:53:44.820 --> 05:53:48.260
So it's actually two items that you will hear

05:53:48.260 --> 05:53:50.300
if it goes to the March meeting,

05:53:50.300 --> 05:53:52.260
an issue, a notice of intent to revoke,

05:53:52.260 --> 05:53:55.300
and then you will come back the next day

05:53:55.300 --> 05:53:57.380
and vote to either revoke or not.

05:53:58.340 --> 05:54:01.700
So just today, we're only asking that the Board issue

05:54:01.700 --> 05:54:02.860
the notice of violation.

05:54:05.100 --> 05:54:09.060
Okay, I think we went too far.

05:54:09.060 --> 05:54:10.500
We need to go back one.

05:54:10.500 --> 05:54:11.340
Thank you.

05:54:12.180 --> 05:54:14.140
The State Board of Ed approved

05:54:14.140 --> 05:54:16.140
the Eagle Collegiate Academy Charter Petition

05:54:16.140 --> 05:54:19.900
at its July 2020 meeting to establish a new school

05:54:19.900 --> 05:54:22.700
within the boundaries of the Acton-Algo Dulce

05:54:22.700 --> 05:54:24.860
Unified School District.

05:54:24.860 --> 05:54:27.900
It was approved in July of 2020,

05:54:27.900 --> 05:54:29.540
but slated to open at the beginning

05:54:29.540 --> 05:54:31.740
of the current year, 21-22.

05:54:32.580 --> 05:54:37.580
It was approved to offer a classroom-based

05:54:37.980 --> 05:54:40.060
international baccalaureate program.

05:54:41.140 --> 05:54:46.140
It was to serve 168 students in TK kindergarten

05:54:46.340 --> 05:54:49.020
through grade three in its first year of operation.

05:54:49.020 --> 05:54:53.180
So the current year that we are in, 21-22,

05:54:53.180 --> 05:54:55.260
is their first year of operation.

05:54:55.260 --> 05:55:00.260
And then they were to grow to serve 438 students

05:55:01.260 --> 05:55:05.260
through grade eight by 2024-25.

05:55:07.820 --> 05:55:08.860
Next slide.

05:55:11.700 --> 05:55:15.900
So the instances of violation that are outlined

05:55:15.900 --> 05:55:18.820
in your item and in the notice of violation

05:55:18.820 --> 05:55:21.460
as part of the attachments to this item,

05:55:21.460 --> 05:55:24.460
the school has engaged in fiscal mismanagement

05:55:24.460 --> 05:55:27.900
pursuant to Ed Code 47607F3.

05:55:27.900 --> 05:55:31.380
Their budget is based on unrealistic enrollment

05:55:31.380 --> 05:55:34.940
and they are projected to have fiscal insolvency

05:55:34.940 --> 05:55:36.540
by the end of this school year.

05:55:37.740 --> 05:55:39.460
They have committed material violations

05:55:39.460 --> 05:55:41.820
of the approved charter petition,

05:55:41.820 --> 05:55:45.300
specifically failure to acquire appropriate facilities

05:55:45.300 --> 05:55:48.460
prior to the start of the 21-22 school year

05:55:48.460 --> 05:55:51.900
and failure to maintain adequate budget reserves.

05:55:51.900 --> 05:55:53.980
And they have committed a violation of law

05:55:53.980 --> 05:55:57.580
pursuant to Ed Code section 47607F4

05:55:57.580 --> 05:56:00.900
in that they are non-compliant

05:56:00.900 --> 05:56:05.660
in their independent study written agreements and policies.

05:56:09.580 --> 05:56:11.340
So the fiscal mismanagement.

05:56:13.140 --> 05:56:16.180
The ECA, Eagle Collegiate Academy,

05:56:16.180 --> 05:56:18.420
has based and continues to base its budget

05:56:18.420 --> 05:56:19.820
on unrealistic enrollment,

05:56:19.820 --> 05:56:22.100
creating a large anticipated deficit

05:56:22.100 --> 05:56:23.740
in its first year of operation.

05:56:24.780 --> 05:56:26.500
ECA's charter petition,

05:56:26.500 --> 05:56:28.340
which was approved in July, 2020,

05:56:28.340 --> 05:56:32.540
included a prospective enrollment of 168 students.

05:56:32.540 --> 05:56:36.620
ECA has never had more than 15 students enrolled

05:56:36.620 --> 05:56:39.300
at any one time during the 21-22 school year,

05:56:39.300 --> 05:56:41.340
which we are in the middle of.

05:56:41.340 --> 05:56:44.020
They currently have 12 students enrolled.

05:56:48.380 --> 05:56:51.420
Here's just a little timeline

05:56:51.420 --> 05:56:55.260
of their enrollment projections.

05:56:55.300 --> 05:56:57.220
So in May of 2021,

05:56:57.220 --> 05:57:00.820
they reported a prospective enrollment of 131 students.

05:57:01.940 --> 05:57:05.180
What they had projected when they were approved in 2020,

05:57:05.180 --> 05:57:07.780
July, 2020, was 168.

05:57:07.780 --> 05:57:10.980
So in July, 2021,

05:57:11.940 --> 05:57:15.860
they reported an estimated enrollment

05:57:15.860 --> 05:57:20.180
of 168 students via the PENSEC.

05:57:20.180 --> 05:57:22.540
In September, 2021, they communicated

05:57:22.540 --> 05:57:26.060
that school began with an enrollment of 131 students.

05:57:26.060 --> 05:57:28.380
They communicated that to the department.

05:57:28.380 --> 05:57:30.020
In November of 2021,

05:57:30.020 --> 05:57:32.940
they reported a total enrollment count of 12 students

05:57:32.940 --> 05:57:35.420
via the charter school 20-day attendance report.

05:57:36.500 --> 05:57:38.220
And in December, 2021,

05:57:38.220 --> 05:57:41.060
when asked to give us an accounting

05:57:41.060 --> 05:57:44.980
of the number of students every month of the fall semester,

05:57:44.980 --> 05:57:47.460
they reported serving 13 students in September,

05:57:47.460 --> 05:57:50.420
14 in October, 12 in November, and 12 in December.

05:57:53.540 --> 05:57:58.540
So based on the information that reported in its PENSEC,

05:57:59.220 --> 05:58:01.580
and again, PENSEC is pupil estimates

05:58:01.580 --> 05:58:04.260
for new or significantly expanding charters,

05:58:04.260 --> 05:58:09.260
and it's the means by which a new charter school gets funded.

05:58:09.380 --> 05:58:11.900
It's a special advanced apportionment for new charters.

05:58:11.900 --> 05:58:15.660
And so they estimate how many students they'll have enrolled,

05:58:15.660 --> 05:58:17.620
and then that's what they're funded for.

05:58:18.140 --> 05:58:23.140
So based on the information reported in its PENSEC,

05:58:23.580 --> 05:58:28.620
ECA received an apportionment of $611,729

05:58:28.620 --> 05:58:30.460
in the first special advanced apportionment

05:58:30.460 --> 05:58:31.460
for charter schools.

05:58:32.420 --> 05:58:33.980
Based on the information it reported

05:58:33.980 --> 05:58:36.700
in its 20-day attendance report,

05:58:36.700 --> 05:58:41.700
it actually qualified for $119,000 in state aid.

05:58:42.220 --> 05:58:44.020
So they were grossly overpaid

05:58:44.020 --> 05:58:48.460
by an estimated $492,396.

05:58:48.460 --> 05:58:51.020
You'll see an email or a letter that was sent to them

05:58:51.020 --> 05:58:53.060
from the School Fiscal Services Division

05:58:53.060 --> 05:58:56.100
of the Department of Ed that states

05:58:56.100 --> 05:59:01.100
that those LCFF funds will likely be due back to the state,

05:59:01.380 --> 05:59:02.860
and they probably will not receive

05:59:02.860 --> 05:59:05.420
any more principal apportionment payments.

05:59:10.420 --> 05:59:13.540
ECA is not fiscally sustainable.

05:59:13.580 --> 05:59:16.220
We did send them a letter of concern

05:59:16.220 --> 05:59:17.900
prior to this notice of violation.

05:59:17.900 --> 05:59:20.220
So they did get a letter of concern in November,

05:59:20.220 --> 05:59:22.260
and part of that letter of concern

05:59:22.260 --> 05:59:25.700
asked them to submit a new budget projection

05:59:25.700 --> 05:59:28.740
based on the number of kids they currently had.

05:59:30.220 --> 05:59:31.060
They didn't do that.

05:59:31.060 --> 05:59:33.700
They sent us a budget projection saying

05:59:33.700 --> 05:59:35.980
that their estimated enrollment

05:59:35.980 --> 05:59:38.260
through the end of this particular school year

05:59:38.260 --> 05:59:40.580
would be around 58 students.

05:59:41.460 --> 05:59:46.460
And so we went back and actually had our fiscal analysis

05:59:47.460 --> 05:59:50.460
go through their numbers and estimate

05:59:52.620 --> 05:59:55.180
what their budget would be with 12 students,

05:59:55.180 --> 05:59:57.860
because that's how many they have currently.

05:59:57.860 --> 06:00:02.740
We're not certain that they could actually get to the 68,

06:00:02.740 --> 06:00:07.100
much less the 131 or 168 that they had projected before.

06:00:07.100 --> 06:00:10.540
So their budget that they sent back to us,

06:00:11.500 --> 06:00:12.820
based on the letter of concern,

06:00:12.820 --> 06:00:16.260
was overestimated and unrealistic in enrollment,

06:00:16.260 --> 06:00:18.900
and includes an overall negative ending fund balance

06:00:18.900 --> 06:00:21.420
of $1.2 million for this school year.

06:00:24.220 --> 06:00:27.300
Also, as part of the narrative that they sent,

06:00:28.300 --> 06:00:32.300
they claimed that they would be raising $100,000

06:00:34.380 --> 06:00:39.380
to help pay for salaries and retirement benefits.

06:00:40.540 --> 06:00:43.340
But as you know, and we've said many times

06:00:43.340 --> 06:00:47.500
before in charter items, that the reliance on soft funding,

06:00:47.500 --> 06:00:52.500
fundraising and donations is not reliable.

06:00:53.580 --> 06:00:56.700
So as far as we know now, they have not raised any money.

06:00:56.700 --> 06:00:59.980
But we even, if they had, we don't necessarily rely

06:00:59.980 --> 06:01:02.300
on soft funding in our budget estimations.

06:01:03.620 --> 06:01:08.020
They also had in their budget projections

06:01:08.060 --> 06:01:10.580
the public charter school grant program,

06:01:10.580 --> 06:01:12.500
the startup sub-grant funds,

06:01:12.500 --> 06:01:17.500
which if you noticed in your item attachments,

06:01:17.500 --> 06:01:20.500
that grant has been paused.

06:01:23.540 --> 06:01:24.660
As part of the grant program,

06:01:24.660 --> 06:01:25.900
and this is for any charter school,

06:01:25.900 --> 06:01:28.660
they have to meet minimum enrollment requirements.

06:01:28.660 --> 06:01:30.420
And those minimum enrollment requirements

06:01:30.420 --> 06:01:32.180
are at least 75 students.

06:01:32.180 --> 06:01:35.940
So as you see with 12, they're very far below that.

06:01:35.940 --> 06:01:40.660
So they will not as of now receive any more funding

06:01:40.660 --> 06:01:42.860
under the public charter school grant program.

06:01:42.860 --> 06:01:45.140
And they also in the budget that they sent us,

06:01:45.140 --> 06:01:46.940
the new budget that they sent us,

06:01:46.940 --> 06:01:49.380
understated the repayment of LCFF funds.

06:01:49.380 --> 06:01:51.100
If you remember a slide back,

06:01:51.100 --> 06:01:53.180
I had said that they were more likely

06:01:53.180 --> 06:01:57.340
gonna have to pay back a big portion of their LCFF

06:01:57.340 --> 06:01:58.980
to the state of California.

06:01:58.980 --> 06:02:01.980
And they did not include that in their budget projections.

06:02:06.100 --> 06:02:09.260
In terms of material violations of the charter petition,

06:02:10.220 --> 06:02:12.300
ECA failed to open a facility

06:02:12.300 --> 06:02:14.380
as a classroom-based charter school

06:02:14.380 --> 06:02:16.100
by the SBE approved date

06:02:16.100 --> 06:02:19.300
or before the start of the 21-22 school year

06:02:20.300 --> 06:02:23.740
on September 7th, which was their start date.

06:02:23.740 --> 06:02:27.180
And in accordance with the charter petition approved

06:02:27.180 --> 06:02:28.820
by the State Board of Ed.

06:02:28.820 --> 06:02:32.100
Now remember they were approved in July of 2020.

06:02:32.100 --> 06:02:37.100
So they did have a year to obtain a facility.

06:02:40.100 --> 06:02:41.700
And when they were approved,

06:02:41.700 --> 06:02:43.020
they said they had a facility

06:02:43.020 --> 06:02:44.860
and that it would be ready to go by the opening day

06:02:44.860 --> 06:02:46.700
that that facility fell through.

06:02:46.700 --> 06:02:49.820
And so they did not obtain a facility.

06:02:49.820 --> 06:02:53.500
On December 6th, last month, 2021,

06:02:53.500 --> 06:02:54.820
they did inform the department

06:02:54.820 --> 06:02:57.300
that the school had finally obtained a short-term lease

06:02:57.300 --> 06:02:58.540
at a temporary facility.

06:02:59.540 --> 06:03:01.740
I know they wanted to start bringing kids

06:03:02.380 --> 06:03:03.940
in right away, but obviously the department

06:03:03.940 --> 06:03:05.900
has to inspect the facility

06:03:05.900 --> 06:03:08.380
and we found the facility non-compliant.

06:03:10.700 --> 06:03:15.700
And those, the notes from our CDE facility division

06:03:16.140 --> 06:03:17.540
are in your attachments.

06:03:18.620 --> 06:03:20.660
But some of the most pressing issues are,

06:03:20.660 --> 06:03:22.980
number one, they did not have a fire marshal report,

06:03:22.980 --> 06:03:24.460
which is required.

06:03:24.460 --> 06:03:29.300
No E-occupancy certification as required by the MOU.

06:03:29.340 --> 06:03:31.620
It was not ADA compliant.

06:03:31.620 --> 06:03:35.020
And fourth, there's actually a person living there,

06:03:36.860 --> 06:03:41.860
which is unusual and for safety reasons,

06:03:41.980 --> 06:03:44.580
and I'm sure you can think of lots of other reasons,

06:03:44.580 --> 06:03:47.700
not ideal for a school.

06:03:50.020 --> 06:03:53.060
So at the moment, their facility is non-compliant.

06:03:53.060 --> 06:03:54.940
Obviously they have the opportunity

06:03:54.940 --> 06:03:56.700
to bring it up to compliance

06:03:56.700 --> 06:03:58.180
and we will do another visit.

06:03:59.580 --> 06:04:02.940
If they do, to go out to see if they have made

06:04:02.940 --> 06:04:05.700
all the appropriate improvements,

06:04:05.700 --> 06:04:09.180
which again, all of those notes are in your attachment.

06:04:11.220 --> 06:04:13.700
ECA's charter petition as approved by the state board

06:04:13.700 --> 06:04:16.180
outlines a classroom-based IV program.

06:04:17.100 --> 06:04:19.980
It does not include 100% non-classroom-based programs.

06:04:19.980 --> 06:04:24.060
So they are only receiving, the students at ECA

06:04:24.060 --> 06:04:26.620
are only receiving online instruction currently.

06:04:27.580 --> 06:04:31.020
And they don't have a funding determination for that,

06:04:31.020 --> 06:04:34.020
which you know, as you've heard,

06:04:34.020 --> 06:04:37.500
many funding determination items in the past,

06:04:37.500 --> 06:04:39.100
if you're 100% online,

06:04:39.100 --> 06:04:41.220
you would need a funding determination.

06:04:41.220 --> 06:04:43.860
So that's an issue as well.

06:04:46.900 --> 06:04:48.780
So they're 100% online,

06:04:48.780 --> 06:04:51.060
which was not what they were approved for.

06:04:51.060 --> 06:04:52.140
Next slide, please.

06:04:52.740 --> 06:04:57.740
Due to the LCFF repayment and discontinuance

06:04:58.660 --> 06:05:02.380
of PCSGP funding, the CDE projects ECA

06:05:02.380 --> 06:05:05.380
to have a negative ending fund balance of 1.2 million.

06:05:05.380 --> 06:05:08.780
And per section 3.5 of the Memorandum of Understanding,

06:05:08.780 --> 06:05:11.620
the MOU between the SBE and ECA,

06:05:11.620 --> 06:05:15.260
ECA is expected to main reserves at 5% of expenditures

06:05:15.260 --> 06:05:18.540
or $71,000, which they will not have.

06:05:19.780 --> 06:05:20.740
Next slide, please.

06:05:21.740 --> 06:05:23.620
In terms of the violations of law,

06:05:24.580 --> 06:05:26.020
they are non-compliant in their

06:05:26.020 --> 06:05:28.500
independent study written agreements.

06:05:28.500 --> 06:05:31.220
AB 130 and AB 167 have,

06:05:35.620 --> 06:05:39.140
sorry, my date goal is starting to go out a little bit,

06:05:41.060 --> 06:05:44.300
included new provisions and requirements

06:05:44.300 --> 06:05:46.300
for schools who offer independent study.

06:05:47.260 --> 06:05:51.180
We did a review of their independent study

06:05:51.180 --> 06:05:53.020
written agreements and their board policies.

06:05:53.020 --> 06:05:57.580
We also had our independent study group at the department

06:05:57.580 --> 06:05:59.980
review those as well to make sure that

06:05:59.980 --> 06:06:04.980
we had the proper folks reviewing it.

06:06:05.860 --> 06:06:09.540
And we found that they are not in compliant

06:06:09.540 --> 06:06:13.300
with EDCO section 51747, G14 and 5.

06:06:14.060 --> 06:06:18.220
And for a lot of reasons and all of those,

06:06:18.220 --> 06:06:22.860
if you look are also outlined in the attachments.

06:06:25.060 --> 06:06:28.140
Other concerns on December 1, 2021,

06:06:28.140 --> 06:06:31.140
the Eldorado Charter Special Education Local Plan Area,

06:06:31.140 --> 06:06:35.540
which we call CELPA, issued a formal notice of concern

06:06:35.540 --> 06:06:38.220
about ECA's ability to function as an LEA.

06:06:38.220 --> 06:06:41.620
ECA had at the time not set up a child find process.

06:06:41.660 --> 06:06:43.220
And the CELPA was concerned that students

06:06:43.220 --> 06:06:45.980
with disabilities were not receiving their due services.

06:06:45.980 --> 06:06:48.620
And I believe that letter is also in your attachments.

06:06:50.860 --> 06:06:53.100
So for the aforementioned reasons,

06:06:53.100 --> 06:06:55.980
the CDE recommends that the state board consider issuing

06:06:55.980 --> 06:06:58.620
a notice of violation to ECA pursuant to

06:06:58.620 --> 06:07:01.620
EDCO section 47607 G.

06:07:01.620 --> 06:07:04.260
The issuance of a notice of violation to Eagle Collegiate

06:07:04.260 --> 06:07:06.780
in the form of a letter to Eagle Collegiate's board

06:07:06.780 --> 06:07:09.380
is the first step towards possible revocation

06:07:09.380 --> 06:07:10.820
of the charter school.

06:07:10.820 --> 06:07:13.020
The ECA board will be afforded the opportunity

06:07:13.020 --> 06:07:16.220
to remedy the violations and provide a letter of response

06:07:16.220 --> 06:07:18.580
addressing each identified violation pursuant

06:07:18.580 --> 06:07:19.820
to the notice of violation.

06:07:22.780 --> 06:07:26.180
The submitted information will be reviewed by the department

06:07:26.180 --> 06:07:30.700
and presented to the ACCS at its February 8th, 2022 meeting.

06:07:30.700 --> 06:07:33.420
The ACCS will take action on a recommendation

06:07:33.420 --> 06:07:36.380
to the state board that will either be to continue

06:07:36.380 --> 06:07:38.940
or discontinue the revocation process.

06:07:38.940 --> 06:07:41.220
If the recommendation is to continue with revocation,

06:07:41.220 --> 06:07:43.060
this action will be presented to the state board

06:07:43.060 --> 06:07:46.340
at its March 9th, 10th, 2022 meeting.

06:07:49.420 --> 06:07:52.140
So again, the CDE recommends that the state board

06:07:52.140 --> 06:07:55.380
of education consider issuing a notice of violation

06:07:55.380 --> 06:07:57.340
to Eagle Collegiate Academy pursuant

06:07:57.340 --> 06:08:00.140
to EDCO section 47607 G.

06:08:01.700 --> 06:08:03.620
And that concludes my presentation.

06:08:05.260 --> 06:08:07.260
Thank you very much, Stephanie.

06:08:07.300 --> 06:08:10.580
At this point, we'll put the public comment slide up

06:08:10.580 --> 06:08:13.780
and invite people to queue up for public comment

06:08:14.740 --> 06:08:17.260
by calling the telephone number and access code

06:08:17.260 --> 06:08:19.860
provided on the slide that is shown now.

06:08:19.860 --> 06:08:22.060
And while we're waiting for any members of the public

06:08:22.060 --> 06:08:25.060
to call in, I want to ask members Burr and Sun

06:08:25.060 --> 06:08:27.420
if they have any initial comments.

06:08:27.420 --> 06:08:28.260
Member Burr.

06:08:30.900 --> 06:08:33.980
Well, I think that the department has done a very good job

06:08:33.980 --> 06:08:37.060
of laying out the difficulties of the school.

06:08:38.140 --> 06:08:41.380
It's always a sad day when we have to take an action

06:08:41.380 --> 06:08:44.940
like this, but I do think the evidence is fairly compelling.

06:08:44.940 --> 06:08:47.300
And I just want to reiterate what Stephanie said

06:08:47.300 --> 06:08:51.220
a number of times, this is really the first step.

06:08:51.220 --> 06:08:54.100
It doesn't mean that necessarily the board will vote

06:08:54.100 --> 06:08:58.020
to revoke the charter, but it does set in motion

06:08:58.020 --> 06:09:02.380
the necessary notifications and also the opportunity

06:09:02.380 --> 06:09:06.940
for the school to respond, especially at ACCS.

06:09:06.940 --> 06:09:10.860
I just wanted to ask one clarifying question, Stephanie,

06:09:10.860 --> 06:09:12.260
about the recommendation.

06:09:12.260 --> 06:09:15.700
I think the recommendation is that the board

06:09:15.700 --> 06:09:19.420
authorize a letter of violation.

06:09:19.420 --> 06:09:22.300
The wording says the board shall consider it,

06:09:22.300 --> 06:09:25.260
which is a little softer, but anyway,

06:09:25.260 --> 06:09:27.460
we can just clarify that when we get to it.

06:09:27.460 --> 06:09:31.740
And then I'll see if member Sun has any other comments.

06:09:32.380 --> 06:09:33.620
All right.

06:09:33.620 --> 06:09:34.500
Yeah, thank you.

06:09:34.500 --> 06:09:39.500
I agree, and that this is the first step in our process.

06:09:40.700 --> 06:09:43.700
Does not mean that the school will be revoked necessarily,

06:09:43.700 --> 06:09:48.700
but the information, the facts are concerning enough

06:09:48.700 --> 06:09:51.660
that I think we need to start the process,

06:09:51.660 --> 06:09:56.540
especially given that there's such a low enrollment.

06:09:56.540 --> 06:10:01.540
And we knew that starting a school in the middle

06:10:01.820 --> 06:10:04.540
of all this chaos and the pandemic,

06:10:04.540 --> 06:10:07.420
it was going to be a very difficult task.

06:10:07.420 --> 06:10:11.300
And while the language, because this way it's worded in law

06:10:11.300 --> 06:10:15.300
is very harsh and it's fiscal mismanagement,

06:10:16.460 --> 06:10:20.580
violation of A, B, and C, I want to emphasize

06:10:20.580 --> 06:10:25.580
that we're not assigning intent that the school intended

06:10:26.780 --> 06:10:29.300
to not have the full enrollment,

06:10:29.340 --> 06:10:32.140
and we didn't intend to do any of these things.

06:10:32.140 --> 06:10:35.980
Nevertheless, the situation is where the situation is,

06:10:35.980 --> 06:10:40.140
and it is just unsustainable to operate a school

06:10:40.140 --> 06:10:41.700
based on 12 students.

06:10:43.380 --> 06:10:44.220
Thank you.

06:10:45.060 --> 06:10:49.020
If there are clarifying questions, we'll take those.

06:10:49.020 --> 06:10:51.780
And then I'm going to allow some time

06:10:51.780 --> 06:10:55.180
for the school's leaders to address us,

06:10:55.180 --> 06:10:57.220
and then we'll go to public comment.

06:10:57.220 --> 06:10:58.940
Are there any clarifying questions?

06:11:00.300 --> 06:11:03.860
At the moment, I am not seeing any.

06:11:03.860 --> 06:11:07.540
It was a very thorough presentation.

06:11:07.540 --> 06:11:12.180
So with that, I want to allow three minutes of time

06:11:12.180 --> 06:11:15.740
for Ogo Okoye, Johnson, and Ken Higginbotham,

06:11:15.740 --> 06:11:19.380
the school's leaders to address the state board members,

06:11:19.380 --> 06:11:21.180
and then we'll go to public comment.

06:11:21.700 --> 06:11:24.700
Good afternoon, Honorable Board President Darlene Hammond,

06:11:24.700 --> 06:11:29.700
Honorable State Board Members, and CDE staff.

06:11:29.740 --> 06:11:32.740
My name is Dr. Ogo Okoye Johnson,

06:11:34.740 --> 06:11:37.540
and I am the founder and chief executive officer

06:11:37.540 --> 06:11:39.740
of A-Goo Collegiate Academy.

06:11:39.740 --> 06:11:42.660
We are a K through eight public charter school,

06:11:42.660 --> 06:11:45.540
currently serving grades K through third.

06:11:45.540 --> 06:11:48.420
I'm the first and only president of the school,

06:11:48.460 --> 06:11:50.580
serving grades K through third.

06:11:50.580 --> 06:11:53.340
I'm the first and only international baccalaureate,

06:11:53.340 --> 06:11:55.220
primary years program candidate school,

06:11:55.220 --> 06:11:57.140
serving the Antelope Valley

06:11:57.140 --> 06:11:59.780
and the Santa Clarita Valley communities.

06:11:59.780 --> 06:12:01.780
As many of you remember,

06:12:01.780 --> 06:12:02.940
the state board approved

06:12:02.940 --> 06:12:04.540
A-Goo Collegiate's charter petition

06:12:04.540 --> 06:12:06.940
with conditions on July 8, 2020,

06:12:06.940 --> 06:12:08.420
the best day of our lives,

06:12:08.420 --> 06:12:10.380
with a one-year delayed opening

06:12:10.380 --> 06:12:14.500
to begin instruction between July 1, 2021,

06:12:14.500 --> 06:12:17.660
and September 30, 2021.

06:12:17.660 --> 06:12:20.180
The entire A-Goo Collegiate Academy community

06:12:20.180 --> 06:12:22.060
thanks you for that approval.

06:12:22.060 --> 06:12:25.180
Since July 2020, A-Goo Collegiate

06:12:25.180 --> 06:12:27.420
has faced innumerable challenges

06:12:27.420 --> 06:12:30.900
in opening various facilities in Agadirosa,

06:12:30.900 --> 06:12:35.900
which has, of course, impacted enrollment and our budget.

06:12:36.020 --> 06:12:41.020
A-Goo Collegiate has and will continue to work diligently

06:12:41.380 --> 06:12:43.700
to remedy the CDE's concerns,

06:12:43.700 --> 06:12:45.220
because that's our goal.

06:12:46.180 --> 06:12:47.220
For these reasons,

06:12:47.220 --> 06:12:49.380
A-Goo Collegiate respectfully requires

06:12:49.380 --> 06:12:50.660
that the state board decline

06:12:50.660 --> 06:12:53.820
to issue the proposed notice of violation.

06:12:53.820 --> 06:12:58.260
Again, A-Goo Collegiate has and will continue

06:12:58.260 --> 06:13:02.420
to work diligently to remedy the CDE's concerns,

06:13:02.420 --> 06:13:05.580
because we are concerned as well.

06:13:05.580 --> 06:13:09.460
To date, we have remedied or substantially remedied

06:13:09.460 --> 06:13:12.580
the CDE's concerns as follows.

06:13:12.580 --> 06:13:14.620
As to facilities,

06:13:14.620 --> 06:13:17.820
despite earlier facilities challenges,

06:13:17.820 --> 06:13:20.380
A-Goo Collegiate has secured a facility

06:13:20.380 --> 06:13:22.340
in the heart of Agadirosa

06:13:22.340 --> 06:13:23.740
that is near ready to begin

06:13:23.740 --> 06:13:27.700
certain families and students.

06:13:27.700 --> 06:13:30.060
We have been working with CDE staff

06:13:30.060 --> 06:13:32.780
to meet their concerns about the facility

06:13:32.780 --> 06:13:36.220
and are tirelessly preparing for our students' arrival

06:13:36.220 --> 06:13:41.220
on site as soon as CDE approves their site.

06:13:44.860 --> 06:13:47.100
As to enrollment,

06:13:47.100 --> 06:13:48.780
A-Goo Collegiate's law enrollment

06:13:48.780 --> 06:13:51.580
has been directly related to earlier challenges

06:13:51.580 --> 06:13:53.500
in securing a facility.

06:13:53.500 --> 06:13:57.140
We have shared with CDE staff

06:13:57.140 --> 06:14:00.780
A-Goo Collegiate's recent acquisition of a school site

06:14:00.780 --> 06:14:03.460
and further preparation for in-person instruction,

06:14:03.460 --> 06:14:05.500
which has led to a substantial increase

06:14:05.500 --> 06:14:07.180
in use and enrollment commitments

06:14:07.180 --> 06:14:09.340
as evidenced by the many written comments

06:14:09.340 --> 06:14:12.100
submitted by families to the state board.

06:14:12.100 --> 06:14:14.060
As to fiscal sustainability,

06:14:14.380 --> 06:14:17.380
with its restated 2021 projected enrollment,

06:14:17.380 --> 06:14:22.380
reasonable projections for 2022-23 and 2023-24

06:14:22.420 --> 06:14:26.020
and a robust enrollment and development campaign on the way,

06:14:26.020 --> 06:14:27.540
A-Goo Collegiate, in conjunction

06:14:27.540 --> 06:14:29.460
with its back office provider,

06:14:29.460 --> 06:14:31.660
is working together to put up budgets

06:14:31.660 --> 06:14:34.900
that reflect our fiscal sustainability plan,

06:14:34.900 --> 06:14:38.460
which includes, if necessary,

06:14:38.460 --> 06:14:42.020
a repayment plan for any overstated

06:14:42.060 --> 06:14:45.420
LCFF Advanced Apportionment Fund

06:14:45.420 --> 06:14:48.020
that is inclusive of A-Goo Collegiate's two-year

06:14:48.020 --> 06:14:49.820
extended charter program.

06:14:51.260 --> 06:14:52.100
Okay.

06:14:52.100 --> 06:14:52.940
Thank you.

06:14:54.580 --> 06:14:56.580
The academy has been fighting to serve

06:14:56.580 --> 06:14:58.420
sense for more than four years,

06:15:00.740 --> 06:15:05.540
and we will work diligently with CDE staff to make

06:15:05.540 --> 06:15:09.300
so as a result, we are asking the state board

06:15:09.300 --> 06:15:11.860
to please decline to issue the proposed notice

06:15:12.700 --> 06:15:14.980
of violation, pursuant to education code 607-G.

06:15:14.980 --> 06:15:17.100
I'm sorry, your time has come to a close.

06:15:17.100 --> 06:15:22.100
And allow the staff and students to start a thing

06:15:23.380 --> 06:15:24.940
and for approving.

06:15:24.940 --> 06:15:25.780
Thank you.

06:15:25.780 --> 06:15:27.220
We'll move to public comment now.

06:15:31.340 --> 06:15:33.260
Is there any public comment?

06:15:33.260 --> 06:15:35.060
Yes, we do have public comment.

06:15:35.940 --> 06:15:40.460
I'm gonna start with Ken Higginbotham from UCA.

06:15:41.860 --> 06:15:42.700
Ken.

06:15:45.020 --> 06:15:46.220
Good afternoon.

06:15:47.220 --> 06:15:50.060
The approval of the request to keep

06:15:50.060 --> 06:15:54.740
Eagle Collegiate Academy operational is paramount.

06:15:55.740 --> 06:16:00.180
High quality of education, individual growth,

06:16:00.180 --> 06:16:05.260
academic achievement, and community enrichment

06:16:05.260 --> 06:16:09.540
make ECA a top-of-the-line learning

06:16:09.540 --> 06:16:12.620
of institution of learning.

06:16:13.740 --> 06:16:18.500
As board president, this is that I am well-versed

06:16:18.500 --> 06:16:21.820
in executive oversight and operations.

06:16:21.820 --> 06:16:26.820
I believe the foundation for success is evident and strong.

06:16:28.780 --> 06:16:33.620
ECA has really accomplished many tasks

06:16:33.620 --> 06:16:37.620
and actions taken in moving this effort forward.

06:16:38.620 --> 06:16:42.180
The parents, the families, the students,

06:16:42.180 --> 06:16:47.180
the community are in high thought.

06:16:48.460 --> 06:16:50.660
Thank you, that concludes your one minute.

06:16:50.660 --> 06:16:51.700
Thank you, caller.

06:16:51.700 --> 06:16:53.220
That concludes your one minute.

06:16:54.620 --> 06:16:57.140
The community.

06:17:00.460 --> 06:17:02.100
Good afternoon.

06:17:02.100 --> 06:17:04.340
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

06:17:04.340 --> 06:17:05.740

06:17:08.620 --> 06:17:10.260
Good afternoon, caller.

06:17:10.260 --> 06:17:13.100
Ending in 1685, you are live,

06:17:13.100 --> 06:17:15.140
and you may start your public comment now.

06:17:17.660 --> 06:17:18.500
Yes, hi.

06:17:18.500 --> 06:17:21.820
I just wanted to say that I'm very grateful

06:17:21.820 --> 06:17:24.700
for the approval of Eagle Collegiate Academy,

06:17:24.700 --> 06:17:29.700
and I definitely support the mission and vision of ECA,

06:17:29.860 --> 06:17:34.860
and its leadership and its staff are very important.

06:17:35.380 --> 06:17:39.340
Its leadership and its staff are just top-notch,

06:17:39.340 --> 06:17:43.380
and they have overcome truly unique odds

06:17:43.380 --> 06:17:46.740
in the past couple of years,

06:17:46.740 --> 06:17:51.180
and I definitely think that Eagle Collegiate Academy

06:17:51.180 --> 06:17:53.100
is a great school for our children,

06:17:53.100 --> 06:17:55.300
and it's great for the community,

06:17:55.300 --> 06:17:58.100
and it provides a great instructional program,

06:17:58.100 --> 06:18:02.260
and has a staff that's very experienced

06:18:02.260 --> 06:18:04.340
and takes great care of its students and family,

06:18:04.340 --> 06:18:07.300
so that's my comment.

06:18:07.300 --> 06:18:08.140
Thank you.

06:18:09.820 --> 06:18:11.300
Next caller, please state your name

06:18:12.660 --> 06:18:13.980
Your time starts now.

06:18:17.540 --> 06:18:18.460
Hi, good afternoon.

06:18:18.460 --> 06:18:19.740
My name is Dawn Hakim,

06:18:19.740 --> 06:18:22.340
and I work with Eagle Collegiate Academy,

06:18:22.340 --> 06:18:26.300
and I really urge you to work with us.

06:18:26.300 --> 06:18:29.860
We are so dedicated and passionate

06:18:29.860 --> 06:18:33.540
to make this school a success.

06:18:33.540 --> 06:18:37.060
We are the only school offering in our community

06:18:37.060 --> 06:18:41.420
a Primary Years International Baccalaureate Program.

06:18:41.420 --> 06:18:46.260
Our team works tirelessly to provide

06:18:46.260 --> 06:18:49.860
the best education possible for the students we have,

06:18:49.860 --> 06:18:54.860
and we are working so hard to grow our student base

06:18:55.140 --> 06:19:00.140
and to get our facility approved and up and running.

06:19:00.180 --> 06:19:04.300
We really are on the cusp of doing great things,

06:19:04.300 --> 06:19:08.740
so please consider, instead of giving a violation,

06:19:08.740 --> 06:19:11.500
let's work together, let's make this happen.

06:19:11.500 --> 06:19:13.180
We can do it.

06:19:13.180 --> 06:19:15.980
Behind all of these things that you're talking about

06:19:15.980 --> 06:19:19.980
is a team of people that care so much about the students.

06:19:19.980 --> 06:19:20.820
Thank you, caller.

06:19:20.820 --> 06:19:22.660
That's your time is up.

06:19:22.660 --> 06:19:23.500
Thank you.

06:19:25.380 --> 06:19:26.780
Next caller, please state your name

06:19:26.780 --> 06:19:28.140
and affiliation for the record.

06:19:28.140 --> 06:19:29.500
Your time starts now.

06:19:32.540 --> 06:19:33.740
Good afternoon.

06:19:33.740 --> 06:19:35.060
My name is Michael Juba,

06:19:35.060 --> 06:19:38.460
speaking on behalf of the more than 300,000 teachers

06:19:38.460 --> 06:19:40.540
of the California Teachers Association.

06:19:41.460 --> 06:19:44.620
CTA supports the CDE's recommendation

06:19:44.620 --> 06:19:46.220
that the State Board of Education

06:19:46.220 --> 06:19:49.340
issue a notice of violation.

06:19:49.340 --> 06:19:52.700
The issues outlined by the CDE in the item today

06:19:52.700 --> 06:19:55.180
should come as no surprise,

06:19:55.180 --> 06:19:58.180
given that when EGLE Collegiate's original appeal

06:19:58.180 --> 06:20:01.460
was heard by the SPE in July 2020,

06:20:01.460 --> 06:20:05.020
and the CDE at that time recommended to deny the petition

06:20:05.020 --> 06:20:07.380
for the same exact reasons.

06:20:08.300 --> 06:20:12.340
In July 2020, the CDE found that the ECA petition

06:20:12.340 --> 06:20:15.940
was not consistent with the sound educational practice,

06:20:15.940 --> 06:20:19.340
and they were demonstrantly unlikely to implement the program

06:20:19.380 --> 06:20:23.260
due to an unrealistic financial and operational plan.

06:20:23.260 --> 06:20:26.660
CTA recommends that the SPE approve

06:20:26.660 --> 06:20:31.580
the CDE's recommendation and issue a notice of violation.

06:20:31.580 --> 06:20:32.940
Thank you for your time.

06:20:32.940 --> 06:20:33.780
Thank you.

06:20:45.820 --> 06:20:47.940
Hi, my name is Ashley Cussell.

06:20:47.940 --> 06:20:50.620
I am a teacher at EGLE Collegiate Academy,

06:20:56.780 --> 06:20:59.100
wonderful administration.

06:20:59.100 --> 06:21:02.460
This school has tried so hard to meet every need

06:21:02.460 --> 06:21:05.300
and to make sure that we're able to do that.

06:21:05.300 --> 06:21:07.260
And I just want to say thank you

06:21:07.300 --> 06:21:09.260
to the EGLE Collegiate Academy and the EGLE

06:21:09.260 --> 06:21:12.980
School has tried so hard to meet every student's needs.

06:21:12.980 --> 06:21:15.860
And myself as a teacher know the importance

06:21:15.860 --> 06:21:20.380
of giving each of these students every chance to succeed.

06:21:20.380 --> 06:21:23.220
And I know for myself, working with these students,

06:21:23.220 --> 06:21:26.940
they have grown so much already since the beginning

06:21:26.940 --> 06:21:30.140
of the school year with small class sizes,

06:21:30.140 --> 06:21:33.420
we were able to do so much for these students.

06:21:33.420 --> 06:21:36.340
And I know our school is wanting to grow

06:21:36.460 --> 06:21:40.300
so excited to be working in a community in a school

06:21:40.300 --> 06:21:43.140
where these students education is so important

06:21:43.140 --> 06:21:46.380
and is looked at as the highest priority.

06:21:46.380 --> 06:21:48.380
And I'm just happy to be a part of it.

06:21:48.380 --> 06:21:51.020
And I continue to hope to be a part of it

06:21:51.020 --> 06:21:53.540
and hope that EGLE Collegiate Academy

06:21:53.540 --> 06:21:55.580
is given the support it needs.

06:21:55.580 --> 06:21:56.500
Thank you.

06:21:56.500 --> 06:21:57.340
Thank you.

Hi, my name is Alice Kennedy.

06:22:08.860 --> 06:22:12.100
I'm also a teacher at EGLE Collegiate Academy.

06:22:12.100 --> 06:22:14.740
I'm also very dedicated to my students.

06:22:14.740 --> 06:22:16.580
I'm very dedicated to the school.

06:22:16.580 --> 06:22:20.060

06:22:20.060 --> 06:22:23.380

and know that we are extremely dedicated to this school

06:22:27.540 --> 06:22:28.740

06:22:28.740 --> 06:22:31.820

06:22:59.220 --> 06:23:00.500
Hi, this is Jeffrey Forrest.

06:23:00.500 --> 06:23:03.420
I am a board member with EGLE Collegiate Academy.

06:23:03.460 --> 06:23:05.140
The purpose of my communications

06:23:05.140 --> 06:23:09.060
to offer my support and endorsement for ECA.

06:23:09.060 --> 06:23:11.300
The pandemic has exposed inequities

06:23:11.300 --> 06:23:12.820
in the delivery of quality education,

06:23:12.820 --> 06:23:14.860
especially for students of color.

06:23:14.860 --> 06:23:17.460
Since its inception, ECA has been committed

06:23:17.460 --> 06:23:19.060
to ensuring that students such as this

06:23:19.060 --> 06:23:20.260
from all backgrounds, in fact,

06:23:20.260 --> 06:23:23.020
receive an educational experience and prepares them

06:23:23.020 --> 06:23:26.020
to achieve success in these uncertain times.

06:23:26.020 --> 06:23:27.980
Therefore, I'm asking you to give ECA

06:23:27.980 --> 06:23:30.740
generous consideration to continue its efforts

06:23:30.740 --> 06:23:33.300
to provide a solid foundation of education

06:23:34.180 --> 06:23:35.020
and learning to the community it serves.

06:23:35.020 --> 06:23:35.860
Thank you.

06:23:35.860 --> 06:23:36.700
Thank you.

06:23:49.420 --> 06:23:52.420
We've been in regular communication with EGLE Collegiate

06:23:52.420 --> 06:23:55.700
since their inception in July of 2020.

06:23:55.700 --> 06:23:58.380
While we don't disagree with any of the facts presented

06:23:58.380 --> 06:24:00.660
by the Department of Ed today,

06:24:00.660 --> 06:24:02.620
and we recognize that there are problems,

06:24:02.620 --> 06:24:06.660
we also recognize and commend Dr. Johnson and her team

06:24:06.660 --> 06:24:09.860
for all of their dedication and hard work.

06:24:09.860 --> 06:24:12.900
They've really had a rough go with some bad luck

06:24:12.900 --> 06:24:15.620
and opening during a pandemic.

06:24:15.620 --> 06:24:18.380
And we absolutely know that their hearts

06:24:18.380 --> 06:24:19.220
are all in the right places

06:24:19.220 --> 06:24:22.300
and they've been trying to do right by their students.

06:24:22.300 --> 06:24:25.500
We will continue to work with ECA through this process

06:24:25.500 --> 06:24:28.380
and to provide support as they continue.

06:24:28.380 --> 06:24:29.260
Thank you.

06:24:29.260 --> 06:24:30.100
Thank you.

and I'm excited for my children

06:24:42.580 --> 06:24:45.220
to be a part of EGLE Collegiate Academy.

06:24:45.220 --> 06:24:48.300
In addition to their excellent instructional program,

06:24:48.300 --> 06:24:50.340
such as the International Baccalaureate

06:24:50.340 --> 06:24:52.940
Primary Youth Program Candidacy,

06:24:52.940 --> 06:24:56.660
I believe in the strong core values and mission.

06:24:56.820 --> 06:25:00.340
I see how caring and dedicated the ECA staff

06:25:00.340 --> 06:25:04.020
is to one another, especially to her students and family.

06:25:04.020 --> 06:25:07.220
And I know my children will receive a quality education

06:25:07.220 --> 06:25:09.460
at EGLE Collegiate Academy.

06:25:09.460 --> 06:25:10.580

06:25:32.540 --> 06:25:35.020

06:25:35.020 --> 06:25:36.940

06:25:36.940 --> 06:25:37.780

06:29:16.580 --> 06:29:20.020
It is a great school for the children that we serve.

06:29:20.020 --> 06:29:22.660

and I am a parent of ECA.

06:29:54.540 --> 06:29:56.380
My daughter is in a pre-K class here.

06:29:57.340 --> 06:30:02.340
ECA is a school that the Santa Clarita Valley

06:30:02.660 --> 06:30:03.900
has not seen.

06:30:03.900 --> 06:30:07.300
It is an amazing structured program for students

06:30:07.300 --> 06:30:11.100
and I feel like the academics are amazing

06:30:11.100 --> 06:30:13.620
as well as the teachers and the staff.

06:30:13.620 --> 06:30:15.900
They provide our kids loving support

06:30:15.900 --> 06:30:17.780
and really being able to go the distance

06:30:17.780 --> 06:30:20.540
and let them know that they can do all things.

06:30:20.540 --> 06:30:24.980
Also being able to provide also children of color

06:30:24.980 --> 06:30:28.180
a place to be able to express themselves

06:30:28.180 --> 06:30:32.740
and feel wanted and feel like they have a place

06:30:32.740 --> 06:30:34.740
in this world and especially that starts in school.

06:30:34.740 --> 06:30:37.380
So I'd love for you guys to support this school

06:30:37.380 --> 06:30:39.740
and all the teachers and administration is doing it

06:30:39.740 --> 06:30:41.540
and support us as parents for our kids

06:30:41.540 --> 06:30:43.420
to continue to be supported.

06:30:44.300 --> 06:30:45.900

06:31:04.620 --> 06:31:07.700

Oh, hi.

06:31:54.180 --> 06:31:56.060
My name is Mobology Liquidate.

06:31:56.060 --> 06:31:57.780
I'm a parent.

06:32:00.020 --> 06:32:04.300
My children are part of the Eagle Collegiate Academy

06:32:04.300 --> 06:32:07.060
and I'm calling to show my support and endorsement

06:32:07.060 --> 06:32:10.020
for ECA to be in full capacity

06:32:10.020 --> 06:32:12.340
for the benefit of our children.

06:32:12.340 --> 06:32:17.340
I've seen and watched how dedicated the staff

06:32:18.060 --> 06:32:20.980
and the administration has been to making sure

06:32:20.980 --> 06:32:25.500
that our children achieve excellent top-notch education.

06:32:28.260 --> 06:32:30.660
They have supported in many ways,

06:32:30.660 --> 06:32:33.620
given structural academic program,

06:32:34.620 --> 06:32:37.540
keeping the kids involved in all level

06:32:37.540 --> 06:32:40.820
and up to like the physical activities

06:32:40.820 --> 06:32:43.500
and teaching them great independence

06:32:45.020 --> 06:32:47.620
for the kids of Santa Clarita.

06:32:47.620 --> 06:32:52.420
The school will be a great asset to the community

06:32:52.420 --> 06:32:57.180
and to our children of color in this part of town.

06:32:57.180 --> 06:32:59.100
So please support us.

06:32:59.100 --> 06:32:59.940
Thank you, caller.

06:32:59.940 --> 06:33:00.940
When my daughter would like to say something.

06:33:00.940 --> 06:33:01.780
Come on.

06:33:01.780 --> 06:33:02.620
Thank you, caller.

06:33:02.620 --> 06:33:04.260
Say something or time is up.

06:33:04.260 --> 06:33:05.540
Okay, all right, thank you.

06:33:11.220 --> 06:33:12.220
Your time starts now.

06:33:16.980 --> 06:33:19.380
Good evening, board members.

06:33:19.380 --> 06:33:20.420
My name is Janelle Rooley.

06:33:20.420 --> 06:33:22.700
I'm an attorney with the law office of Young Indian Corps.

06:33:22.700 --> 06:33:25.300
I'm here today in support of Eagle Collegiate.

06:33:25.300 --> 06:33:27.380
I do also want to express deep gratitude

06:33:27.380 --> 06:33:31.700
for board members, sorry, Burr, Son, Rucker, Straus

06:33:31.740 --> 06:33:33.900
for your years of support, tough love,

06:33:33.900 --> 06:33:36.700
and spirited discussion around charter school matters.

06:33:36.700 --> 06:33:37.660
As to Eagle Collegiate,

06:33:37.660 --> 06:33:39.460
we ask that the board today hold off

06:33:39.460 --> 06:33:41.420
in issuing the notice of violation.

06:33:41.420 --> 06:33:44.620
Eagle Collegiate has had particularly tough flooding

06:33:44.620 --> 06:33:46.020
trying to open during a pandemic

06:33:46.020 --> 06:33:47.860
in an area where local politics

06:33:47.860 --> 06:33:49.340
have undermined multiple attempts

06:33:49.340 --> 06:33:51.620
to secure a viable facility.

06:33:51.620 --> 06:33:54.460
As you've heard, ECA is about to turn the corner.

06:33:54.460 --> 06:33:56.420
Tacking on a notice of violation right now

06:33:56.420 --> 06:33:58.180
would divert needed resources away

06:33:58.180 --> 06:34:00.780
from getting the school site open,

06:34:00.780 --> 06:34:02.500
which is, of course, counterproductive

06:34:02.500 --> 06:34:05.100
and makes opening even more difficult.

06:34:05.100 --> 06:34:07.700
Eagle Collegiate has shown that the enrollment is there,

06:34:07.700 --> 06:34:09.580
that the facility is imminently ready,

06:34:09.580 --> 06:34:11.100
and that the combination of both of those

06:34:11.100 --> 06:34:13.460
will stabilize the financial picture.

06:34:13.460 --> 06:34:14.860
Please allow Eagle Collegiate

06:34:14.860 --> 06:34:16.740
to continue working with CDE staff

06:34:16.740 --> 06:34:19.580
outside of the formal framework of a notice of violation.

06:34:19.580 --> 06:34:20.420
Thank you.

06:34:20.420 --> 06:34:21.660

Thank you for approving Eagle Collegiate Academy.

06:34:36.820 --> 06:34:39.180
ECA has a great educational program,

06:34:39.180 --> 06:34:42.740
including their IBU Primary Years Candidate Program.

06:34:43.620 --> 06:34:46.460
I look forward to my children and many others

06:34:46.460 --> 06:34:49.140
continuing their education at ECA.

06:34:49.140 --> 06:34:49.980

06:35:10.580 --> 06:35:11.900
Okay, yes.

06:35:11.900 --> 06:35:13.260
My name is Eliana Howe,

06:35:13.260 --> 06:35:15.060
and I'm one of the teachers there,

06:35:15.060 --> 06:35:18.580
and I would like to strongly support the school,

06:35:18.580 --> 06:35:20.820
as well as the fact that many parents

06:35:20.820 --> 06:35:25.020
have asked for this kind of school in this community,

06:35:25.020 --> 06:35:28.740
and we are looking forward to offering

06:35:28.740 --> 06:35:31.740
specialized academic instruction to the students,

06:35:31.740 --> 06:35:34.700
as well as Common Core standards,

06:35:34.700 --> 06:35:37.260
and we have an excellent curriculum

06:35:37.260 --> 06:35:40.460
ready for the students to be able to learn

06:35:40.460 --> 06:35:42.940
how to, in the future,

06:35:42.940 --> 06:35:47.660
how to do business in this world economy.

06:35:47.660 --> 06:35:49.300
So we just want to be sure

06:35:49.300 --> 06:35:51.740
that we have this kind of education in our community.

06:35:51.740 --> 06:35:52.980
Thank you so much.

06:35:52.980 --> 06:35:54.300
Thank you.

06:35:54.300 --> 06:35:55.340
President Darlene Hammond,

06:35:55.340 --> 06:35:57.940
that concludes public comment for item number 12.

06:36:00.340 --> 06:36:01.620
Thank you very much.

06:36:01.620 --> 06:36:03.460
Appreciate all of the public comment

06:36:03.460 --> 06:36:06.700
and the report from the CDE,

06:36:06.700 --> 06:36:10.980
and at this point, we're open for full board discussion

06:36:10.980 --> 06:36:12.300
prior to a motion.

06:36:12.300 --> 06:36:14.900
Is there any board discussion?

06:36:20.140 --> 06:36:23.780
I am not seeing any hands raised.

06:36:23.780 --> 06:36:24.780
Do I have a motion?

06:36:27.660 --> 06:36:29.500
I would move the department's recommendation

06:36:29.500 --> 06:36:33.180
that the board issue a letter of violation to,

06:36:33.180 --> 06:36:36.060
a notice of violation to the Eagle Collegiate and Academy

06:36:36.060 --> 06:36:39.300
per the issues that are raised in the item.

06:36:40.900 --> 06:36:42.500
Is there a second?

06:36:42.500 --> 06:36:43.380
I will second.

06:36:44.260 --> 06:36:47.820
All right, we'll now hold a roll call vote.

06:36:47.820 --> 06:36:49.540
Brooks, please call the roll.

06:36:49.540 --> 06:36:50.380
Number Sun.

06:36:51.580 --> 06:36:52.420
Aye.

06:36:52.420 --> 06:36:54.140
Number Strauss.

06:36:54.140 --> 06:36:55.140
Yes.

06:36:55.140 --> 06:36:55.980
Number Rucker.

06:36:57.260 --> 06:36:58.260
Yes.

06:36:58.260 --> 06:36:59.340
Number Rodriguez.

06:37:00.460 --> 06:37:01.420
Yes.

06:37:01.420 --> 06:37:02.740
Number Petillo-Brownson.

06:37:03.820 --> 06:37:04.780
Yes.

06:37:04.780 --> 06:37:05.780
Number McQuillan.

06:37:07.220 --> 06:37:08.260
Yes.

06:37:08.260 --> 06:37:09.700
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:37:10.860 --> 06:37:11.820
Yes.

06:37:11.820 --> 06:37:12.820
Number Escobedo.

06:37:14.340 --> 06:37:15.380
Yes.

06:37:15.380 --> 06:37:16.780
President Darlene Hammond.

06:37:17.820 --> 06:37:18.740
Yes.

06:37:18.740 --> 06:37:20.180
Number Burr.

06:37:20.180 --> 06:37:21.340
Aye.

06:37:21.340 --> 06:37:22.180
Number Bonanca.

06:37:23.380 --> 06:37:24.540
Aye.

06:37:24.540 --> 06:37:25.940
Motion passes unanimously.

06:37:27.940 --> 06:37:28.780
Thank you.

06:37:28.780 --> 06:37:32.580
And we'll just note again for the record

06:37:32.580 --> 06:37:35.300
that this is not a decision

06:37:35.300 --> 06:37:37.020
about what will happen in the future,

06:37:37.020 --> 06:37:39.180
but it does seem warranted at this time

06:37:39.180 --> 06:37:41.820
and we should look forward to seeing

06:37:41.820 --> 06:37:44.940
if any of these things can be remediated

06:37:44.940 --> 06:37:46.980
in the coming months.

06:37:47.220 --> 06:37:51.820
And I'm going to press ahead to reopen item one.

06:37:51.820 --> 06:37:53.100
I know it's been a long day.

06:37:53.100 --> 06:37:55.220
I appreciate everyone hanging in there

06:37:57.060 --> 06:37:59.180
will be our last item.

06:37:59.180 --> 06:38:02.100
Well, almost our last item before the public comment,

06:38:02.100 --> 06:38:03.700
the general public comment.

06:38:03.700 --> 06:38:05.860
So I will reopen item one to take up

06:38:05.860 --> 06:38:08.700
the State Board Screening Committee recommendations

06:38:08.700 --> 06:38:13.100
regarding appointments to ACSE and IQC.

06:38:13.100 --> 06:38:15.100
We'll take action on the preliminary report

06:38:15.100 --> 06:38:18.620
of actions, draft November 2021 meeting minutes,

06:38:18.620 --> 06:38:20.700
report on our liaison assignments,

06:38:20.700 --> 06:38:23.020
and give final reflections and appreciations

06:38:23.020 --> 06:38:25.020
for our outgoing Board members.

06:38:25.940 --> 06:38:28.260
So I do want to ask Member Strauss

06:38:28.260 --> 06:38:30.660
as Chair of the State Board Screening Committee

06:38:30.660 --> 06:38:32.940
to present the Committee's recommendations.

06:38:32.940 --> 06:38:34.340
And while we're waiting for any members

06:38:34.340 --> 06:38:36.300
of the public to call in,

06:38:36.300 --> 06:38:38.900
do I have a motion from a Board member

06:38:38.900 --> 06:38:43.900
to approve the State Board Screening Committee recommendations?

06:38:46.060 --> 06:38:47.780
Well, do you want me to make the recommendation?

06:38:47.780 --> 06:38:50.220
Yeah, why don't you make the recommendations to it?

06:38:50.220 --> 06:38:52.780
And also I don't have the public comments.

06:38:52.780 --> 06:38:54.340
So why don't you make the recommendations?

06:38:54.340 --> 06:38:55.580
We'll have public comments.

06:38:55.580 --> 06:38:58.260
So let me just say, I would like to say-

06:38:58.260 --> 06:39:00.380
It's a little slip there, I think.

06:39:01.500 --> 06:39:04.100
So I would like to thank my Screening Committee,

06:39:04.100 --> 06:39:07.980
Vice President Glover-Woods and Member Sung and myself.

06:39:07.980 --> 06:39:10.900
And I would just say we had amazing candidates,

06:39:10.900 --> 06:39:13.620
a large number to interview

06:39:13.620 --> 06:39:15.460
for the Advisory Commission on Special Ed

06:39:15.460 --> 06:39:17.540
and the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:39:17.540 --> 06:39:18.620
Very, very thoughtful.

06:39:18.620 --> 06:39:20.900
We interviewed before the holidays.

06:39:20.900 --> 06:39:22.500
So we have a recommendation

06:39:22.500 --> 06:39:25.980
for the Commission on Special Ed for a two-year term.

06:39:25.980 --> 06:39:28.060
Barbara Sorter, the Administrator

06:39:28.060 --> 06:39:30.220
and Special Ed Voc Ed Unit

06:39:30.220 --> 06:39:32.700
with Riverside County Office of Education.

06:39:32.700 --> 06:39:36.060
Her term goes from January 1st, 2022

06:39:36.060 --> 06:39:39.580
to December 31st, 2023.

06:39:39.580 --> 06:39:42.020
We're also recommending two appointments

06:39:42.060 --> 06:39:44.740
to the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:39:44.740 --> 06:39:48.780
Neil McCaffrey, he's principal at Discovery Charter School.

06:39:48.780 --> 06:39:53.340
He represents the charter school leadership category on IQC

06:39:53.340 --> 06:39:58.340
from January 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2025.

06:39:58.780 --> 06:40:02.900
And Nicole Ranaghera, she's a differentiation specials

06:40:02.900 --> 06:40:06.060
with Davis Union High School District.

06:40:06.060 --> 06:40:08.660
She represents teachers of public school.

06:40:08.660 --> 06:40:11.620
Her term also goes from January 1st, 22

06:40:11.620 --> 06:40:14.500
to December 31st, 2025.

06:40:14.500 --> 06:40:17.180
And I recommend the board approve these appointments

06:40:17.180 --> 06:40:19.860
to advise your commission on Special Ed

06:40:19.860 --> 06:40:21.580
and the Instructional Quality Commission.

06:40:21.580 --> 06:40:22.540
Thank you.

06:40:22.540 --> 06:40:23.380
Thank you.

06:40:23.380 --> 06:40:25.780
And now we will see if there's any public comment.

06:40:29.620 --> 06:40:31.900
It looks like there may be one person signed up.

06:40:31.900 --> 06:40:33.900
I will open the phone line.

06:40:33.900 --> 06:40:35.020
Caller, please state your name

06:40:35.020 --> 06:40:36.580
and affiliation for the record.

06:40:36.580 --> 06:40:37.900
Your time starts now.

06:40:39.660 --> 06:40:42.900
Good evening, State Board of Education.

06:40:42.900 --> 06:40:45.100
This is Jessica Sacco from Children Now

06:40:45.100 --> 06:40:48.420
on behalf of the entire education team,

06:40:48.420 --> 06:40:50.540
including Rob Manwearing, Samantha Tran,

06:40:50.540 --> 06:40:54.340
Stefan Blake, Josefina, Nesmith Ramirez,

06:40:54.340 --> 06:40:56.820
and Vincent Stewart, and myself,

06:40:56.820 --> 06:41:00.460
thanking all of the outgoing board members,

06:41:00.460 --> 06:41:03.860
Patricia Rucker, Ting, member Ting,

06:41:03.860 --> 06:41:05.380
Super, and Eileen Strauss.

06:41:05.380 --> 06:41:07.180
The students of California may not know

06:41:07.180 --> 06:41:09.380
of the thousands of combined volunteer hours

06:41:09.380 --> 06:41:11.940
that the four of you have contributed to this work.

06:41:11.940 --> 06:41:13.860
They may not even know your name,

06:41:13.860 --> 06:41:16.780
yet your work has made their educational opportunities

06:41:16.780 --> 06:41:18.100
significantly better.

06:41:19.300 --> 06:41:21.900
Through your leadership on LCFS implementation,

06:41:21.900 --> 06:41:25.380
accountability, building a system of continuous improvement,

06:41:25.380 --> 06:41:28.300
system of support, your leadership in areas

06:41:28.300 --> 06:41:31.620
such as assessment, STEM education, charter schools,

06:41:31.620 --> 06:41:32.980
curriculum instruction,

06:41:32.980 --> 06:41:36.220
Instructional Quality Commission, accountability,

06:41:36.260 --> 06:41:38.580
your institutional knowledge will be missed.

06:41:38.580 --> 06:41:41.900
The joy and enthusiasm that you have brought to this work

06:41:41.900 --> 06:41:43.140
will be missed.

06:41:43.140 --> 06:41:45.300
Thank you, and we wish you the best of luck

06:41:45.300 --> 06:41:47.140
on your future endeavors.

06:41:47.140 --> 06:41:47.980
Thank you.

06:41:50.500 --> 06:41:53.940
All right, and with that, any other?

06:41:53.940 --> 06:41:56.180
I think we may have one more caller.

06:41:56.180 --> 06:41:57.300
Just one moment.

06:41:58.180 --> 06:41:59.340
Caller, please state your name

06:41:59.340 --> 06:42:01.060
and affiliation for the record.

06:42:01.060 --> 06:42:02.420
Your time starts now.

06:42:03.420 --> 06:42:07.100
Good afternoon, Dr. Darling-Hammond and board members.

06:42:07.100 --> 06:42:08.900
Diana Vu on behalf of the Association

06:42:08.900 --> 06:42:10.340
of California School Administrators.

06:42:10.340 --> 06:42:12.260
Actually, I'd like to thank the outgoing board members

06:42:12.260 --> 06:42:14.380
for their leadership during these unprecedented times

06:42:14.380 --> 06:42:16.900
and continuous dedication to California's

06:42:16.900 --> 06:42:18.020
six million students.

06:42:18.020 --> 06:42:20.500
Thank you so much, Dr. Strauss, board member Burr,

06:42:20.500 --> 06:42:22.980
board member Rucker, and Dr. Son for your service

06:42:22.980 --> 06:42:25.620
to improving California's public education system.

06:42:25.620 --> 06:42:28.260
And congratulations to the 2022 board.

06:42:28.260 --> 06:42:29.300
Thank you.

06:42:29.300 --> 06:42:30.820
Thank you.

06:42:30.860 --> 06:42:32.900
Okay, it looks like that concludes public comment

06:42:32.900 --> 06:42:35.500
for this portion of item one.

06:42:35.500 --> 06:42:39.420
And just for anybody who is monitoring the meeting virtually,

06:42:39.420 --> 06:42:42.180
we just wanted to clarify that that was public comment

06:42:42.180 --> 06:42:43.540
actually on the recommendations,

06:42:43.540 --> 06:42:45.580
and there will still be an opportunity to call in

06:42:45.580 --> 06:42:48.180
to thank and celebrate our members in a moment.

06:42:48.180 --> 06:42:50.060
Right, yeah, we were getting to that,

06:42:50.060 --> 06:42:52.100
but we hadn't quite gotten there yet.

06:42:52.100 --> 06:42:53.580
But we have a lot of things in item one,

06:42:53.580 --> 06:42:57.700
so it's a logical mistake.

06:42:57.700 --> 06:43:01.900
So with that, is there any other discussion

06:43:01.900 --> 06:43:04.540
about this item before we take a motion?

06:43:07.260 --> 06:43:10.420
Seeing none, I will happily take a motion.

06:43:10.420 --> 06:43:12.340
So I move approval of the appointments

06:43:12.340 --> 06:43:14.980
from the advisory commission for the screening committee

06:43:14.980 --> 06:43:17.260
to advisory commission on special ed

06:43:17.260 --> 06:43:19.340
and instructional quality commission.

06:43:19.340 --> 06:43:21.300
And do I have a second?

06:43:21.300 --> 06:43:23.620
No, I will second unless, yeah.

06:43:25.260 --> 06:43:27.540
Second and third, thank you very much.

06:43:28.380 --> 06:43:29.220
We'll hold a roll call vote.

06:43:29.220 --> 06:43:30.620
Brooks, can you please call the roll?

06:43:30.620 --> 06:43:32.180

Number Rucker.

06:43:37.260 --> 06:43:38.100
Yes.

06:43:38.100 --> 06:43:39.100
Number Rodriguez.

06:43:40.100 --> 06:43:40.940
Yes.

06:43:40.940 --> 06:43:42.100
Number Petillo-Brownson.

06:43:43.220 --> 06:43:44.060
Yes.

06:43:44.060 --> 06:43:45.020
Number McQuillan.

06:43:46.060 --> 06:43:46.900
Yes.

06:43:46.900 --> 06:43:48.260
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:43:49.140 --> 06:43:49.980
Yes.

06:43:49.980 --> 06:43:50.980
Number Escobedo.

06:43:52.500 --> 06:43:53.460
Yes.

06:43:53.460 --> 06:43:55.340
President Darlin-Hammond.

06:43:55.340 --> 06:43:56.180
Yes.

06:43:56.180 --> 06:43:57.620
Number Burr.

06:43:57.620 --> 06:43:58.460
Aye.

06:43:58.460 --> 06:43:59.300
Number Bonanca.

06:44:00.460 --> 06:44:01.300
Aye.

06:44:01.300 --> 06:44:02.700
Motion carries unanimously.

06:44:04.340 --> 06:44:05.940
Thank you.

06:44:05.940 --> 06:44:10.940
And we will also have an opportunity for public comment

06:44:11.580 --> 06:44:16.580
on the State Board of Education draft

06:44:17.300 --> 06:44:19.340
preliminary report of action and meeting minutes.

06:44:19.340 --> 06:44:22.100
So we're gonna keep that public comment slide up there.

06:44:22.100 --> 06:44:23.460
And while we're waiting for any members

06:44:23.460 --> 06:44:25.060
of the public to call in,

06:44:25.060 --> 06:44:26.700
do I have a motion from a board member

06:44:26.700 --> 06:44:31.700
to approve the November 2021 State Board of Education draft

06:44:31.780 --> 06:44:34.620
preliminary report of action meeting minutes?

06:44:36.780 --> 06:44:38.580
I will move to approve.

06:44:38.580 --> 06:44:39.580
Thank you.

06:44:39.580 --> 06:44:40.660
Do I have a second?

06:44:41.700 --> 06:44:43.420
Second.

06:44:43.420 --> 06:44:44.860
Thank you very much.

06:44:44.860 --> 06:44:46.660
Now, are there any public comments?

06:44:48.060 --> 06:44:49.740
There are no public comments.

06:44:51.100 --> 06:44:52.980
All right, any further discussion?

06:44:53.940 --> 06:44:57.340
We will hold a roll call vote.

06:44:57.340 --> 06:44:58.940
Brooks, please call the roll.

06:44:58.940 --> 06:44:59.780
Number Sun.

06:45:00.980 --> 06:45:01.900
Aye.

06:45:01.900 --> 06:45:02.740
Number Strauss.

06:45:03.620 --> 06:45:04.460
Yes.

06:45:04.460 --> 06:45:05.300
Number Rucker.

06:45:06.500 --> 06:45:07.340
Yes.

06:45:07.340 --> 06:45:08.380
Number Rodriguez.

06:45:10.900 --> 06:45:11.860
Yes.

06:45:11.860 --> 06:45:13.140
Number Petillo-Brownson.

06:45:14.540 --> 06:45:15.380
Yes.

06:45:15.380 --> 06:45:16.340
Number McQuillan.

06:45:17.820 --> 06:45:18.700
Yes.

06:45:18.700 --> 06:45:20.100
Vice President Glover-Woods.

06:45:21.020 --> 06:45:21.860
Yes.

06:45:21.860 --> 06:45:22.700
Number Escobedo.

06:45:24.220 --> 06:45:25.100
Yes.

06:45:25.100 --> 06:45:27.140
President Darlin-Hammond.

06:45:27.140 --> 06:45:27.980
Yes.

06:45:27.980 --> 06:45:29.420
Number Burr.

06:45:29.420 --> 06:45:30.260
Aye.

06:45:30.260 --> 06:45:31.100
Number Bonacca.

06:45:32.140 --> 06:45:33.140
Aye.

06:45:33.140 --> 06:45:34.540
Motion carries unanimously.

06:45:35.660 --> 06:45:37.060
Thank you.

06:45:37.060 --> 06:45:40.140
We have arrived at board member liaison reports,

06:45:40.140 --> 06:45:42.380
and I want to invite the board members

06:45:42.380 --> 06:45:44.300
to report on any liaison activities

06:45:44.300 --> 06:45:48.060
that are not related to items on our January agenda.

06:45:48.060 --> 06:45:49.820
Following that, we are going to have

06:45:49.820 --> 06:45:52.740
any final appreciations through public comment

06:45:52.740 --> 06:45:54.780
for our departing board members

06:45:54.780 --> 06:45:59.460
and a little announcement about what else is coming to you,

06:45:59.460 --> 06:46:02.300
and then we will get to general public comment.

06:46:02.300 --> 06:46:04.300
So that's the order of operations,

06:46:04.300 --> 06:46:07.300
and let's begin by calling on our board members

06:46:07.300 --> 06:46:09.860
in reverse or alphabetical order

06:46:09.860 --> 06:46:13.100
to give their board liaison reports.

06:46:13.100 --> 06:46:14.540
Member Sun.

06:46:14.540 --> 06:46:15.700
Yeah, so I.

06:46:15.700 --> 06:46:18.540
Your last board liaison report.

06:46:18.540 --> 06:46:22.380
I don't have a lot to say at this point.

06:46:22.380 --> 06:46:26.780
The California Workforce Pathways Advisory Committee

06:46:26.780 --> 06:46:28.580
is meeting later this month,

06:46:28.580 --> 06:46:31.580
continuing the work of the California,

06:46:31.580 --> 06:46:34.660
the Career Technical Education State Plan,

06:46:34.660 --> 06:46:37.980
which we've been working on for what, five years now.

06:46:37.980 --> 06:46:41.780
So I will be monitoring from afar

06:46:41.780 --> 06:46:43.900
to see the progress of that.

06:46:43.900 --> 06:46:46.860
And then with helping charters,

06:46:46.860 --> 06:46:48.860
I know that's continues to be dynamic,

06:46:48.860 --> 06:46:52.660
and we covered a charter item today,

06:46:52.660 --> 06:46:55.220
and that's all I have, thank you.

06:46:55.220 --> 06:46:56.740
All right, well, thank you.

06:46:56.740 --> 06:46:59.940
And once again, thank you for your amazing service

06:46:59.940 --> 06:47:03.860
on the board, and I'll move to Vice President Sprouse.

06:47:03.860 --> 06:47:06.340
So President Darlhan, just a question.

06:47:06.340 --> 06:47:09.380
I have some things to report on my liaison reports.

06:47:09.380 --> 06:47:12.100
Is this the time for me to make my own final reflections,

06:47:12.100 --> 06:47:16.140
or do you want me to do that after the liaison reports?

06:47:16.180 --> 06:47:18.940
I think you should go ahead and fold it in.

06:47:18.940 --> 06:47:23.300
Okay, so just a couple of, I had a bunch of liaison reports.

06:47:23.300 --> 06:47:27.660
So I liaison to the California State University Center

06:47:27.660 --> 06:47:29.860
for Advancement of Instruction and Quantitative Reasoning.

06:47:29.860 --> 06:47:32.300
That's the group that's trying to help support

06:47:32.300 --> 06:47:34.580
a fourth year of math with quantitative reasoning,

06:47:34.580 --> 06:47:37.500
which you'll hear a lot about in the math framework,

06:47:37.500 --> 06:47:40.220
and really working hard to take a look at how these,

06:47:40.220 --> 06:47:44.780
the CSU faculty can help our K-12 faculty improve.

06:47:44.780 --> 06:47:46.620
So they are continuing to meet.

06:47:46.620 --> 06:47:51.260
They really want to help do relevant support for content

06:47:51.260 --> 06:47:53.140
and pedagogy knowledge for teachers.

06:47:53.140 --> 06:47:54.740
So just, that's an ongoing thing.

06:47:54.740 --> 06:47:57.460
So just wanted to let you know about that as well.

06:47:57.460 --> 06:47:58.820
As Instructional Quality Commission,

06:47:58.820 --> 06:48:00.820
both Member Rucker and I liaison,

06:48:00.820 --> 06:48:03.940
next week is the orientation for new IQC members.

06:48:03.940 --> 06:48:06.740
So I'm assuming that Member Glover-Woods

06:48:06.740 --> 06:48:09.140
will do the swearing in of the new members,

06:48:09.140 --> 06:48:10.900
but that is next week.

06:48:10.900 --> 06:48:13.420
And then the California Collaborative for District Reform

06:48:13.860 --> 06:48:16.300
will meet on the 29th and 30th of November.

06:48:16.300 --> 06:48:18.860
And they worked on centering equity

06:48:18.860 --> 06:48:20.700
and ensuring whole child wellbeing

06:48:20.700 --> 06:48:23.220
with the pandemic recovery as a focus.

06:48:23.220 --> 06:48:25.140
So you'll appreciate that the conversation

06:48:25.140 --> 06:48:27.540
with districts and policy makers

06:48:27.540 --> 06:48:30.660
was around social-emotional learning, MTSS,

06:48:30.660 --> 06:48:33.740
and communities school approaches needs.

06:48:33.740 --> 06:48:36.500
So again, we are talking about that a lot

06:48:36.500 --> 06:48:37.860
in all of our collaborative work,

06:48:37.860 --> 06:48:40.220
and I think really, really important.

06:48:40.220 --> 06:48:41.460
And as science liaison,

06:48:41.460 --> 06:48:43.700
I appreciated the comments from the science community.

06:48:43.700 --> 06:48:45.020
I just wanted to share,

06:48:45.020 --> 06:48:47.380
they have now published a blueprint for action

06:48:47.380 --> 06:48:49.580
for equitable science education

06:48:49.580 --> 06:48:50.940
and have five priorities,

06:48:50.940 --> 06:48:55.140
including a science and teacher and administrator workforce,

06:48:55.140 --> 06:48:57.260
science that's culturally responsive

06:48:57.260 --> 06:49:02.260
and has appropriate materials in strengthening LEA capacity

06:49:03.180 --> 06:49:05.300
and looking at the science performance indicator,

06:49:05.300 --> 06:49:06.580
which I talked about on the dashboard.

06:49:06.580 --> 06:49:09.540
Anyway, I think they've worked really hard on this blueprint

06:49:09.540 --> 06:49:12.220
and they're willing and continue to collaborate with us.

06:49:12.220 --> 06:49:14.020
And I just wanted to bring that forward

06:49:14.020 --> 06:49:15.860
as a science liaison.

06:49:15.860 --> 06:49:19.540
Member, President Darling-Hammond and I are liaisons

06:49:19.540 --> 06:49:21.620
to the National Association

06:49:21.620 --> 06:49:23.940
of State Boards of Education, NASP.

06:49:23.940 --> 06:49:26.940
We had a meeting on the 21st with Secretary Cardona

06:49:26.940 --> 06:49:29.700
with state board vice chairs and chairs.

06:49:29.700 --> 06:49:31.100
I thought that couple comments

06:49:31.100 --> 06:49:33.860
and Member Darling-Hammond would probably add to it,

06:49:33.860 --> 06:49:36.540
but no question talking about the challenges,

06:49:36.540 --> 06:49:38.780
but the opportunities going forward

06:49:38.780 --> 06:49:41.900
to make public education greater than ever.

06:49:41.900 --> 06:49:44.260
And this is a chance to reset things

06:49:44.260 --> 06:49:45.780
that we didn't like in education,

06:49:45.780 --> 06:49:48.580
which I think many of us would really agree on.

06:49:48.580 --> 06:49:51.620
And so I just appreciate that he focused

06:49:51.620 --> 06:49:53.180
on the positive lessons learned

06:49:53.180 --> 06:49:55.300
and not to lose the urgency

06:49:55.300 --> 06:49:56.940
to embed social emotional learning

06:49:56.940 --> 06:50:00.620
and wellbeing into our schools and to reimagine.

06:50:00.620 --> 06:50:03.100
And especially how hard things are,

06:50:03.100 --> 06:50:06.460
just to remember that we're all working really hard,

06:50:06.460 --> 06:50:08.340
but this is an opportunity.

06:50:08.420 --> 06:50:11.300
And then my final reflection is, let me just say,

06:50:11.300 --> 06:50:15.620
when I came to the board 11 years ago,

06:50:15.620 --> 06:50:18.700
the first time I ended a local board meeting

06:50:18.700 --> 06:50:20.620
where I was in assistant soup at 1 a.m.,

06:50:20.620 --> 06:50:22.180
flew up to Sacramento,

06:50:22.180 --> 06:50:25.100
never been in the CD room before the board room.

06:50:25.100 --> 06:50:27.380
And there was parent revolution,

06:50:27.380 --> 06:50:30.020
lots of bus parents there saying,

06:50:30.020 --> 06:50:31.580
we want our schools to be better.

06:50:31.580 --> 06:50:33.860
And thank goodness for Yvonne Chan,

06:50:33.860 --> 06:50:35.340
who was there at the time who said to me,

06:50:35.340 --> 06:50:37.860
okay, look, here's where you get coffee,

06:50:37.860 --> 06:50:40.660
here's the restroom, here's a you do expense report.

06:50:40.660 --> 06:50:44.060
And since then, my whole world has opened up

06:50:44.060 --> 06:50:45.700
with all of you and the board members

06:50:45.700 --> 06:50:48.500
that I've worked with over the last 11 years.

06:50:48.500 --> 06:50:50.460
So I've had a very wonderful opportunity

06:50:50.460 --> 06:50:52.140
to be liaison to a lot of things.

06:50:52.140 --> 06:50:55.380
I did before IDA, I was the California commission

06:50:55.380 --> 06:50:57.340
on teacher credentialing liaison.

06:50:57.340 --> 06:51:00.100
I was opportunity to do the concurrence commission

06:51:00.100 --> 06:51:01.900
with the subject matter projects,

06:51:01.900 --> 06:51:03.980
the instructional quality commission

06:51:03.980 --> 06:51:07.300
with ELA and ELD and the science frameworks,

06:51:07.340 --> 06:51:09.860
accountability with the system of support,

06:51:09.860 --> 06:51:12.500
the California practitioners advisory group,

06:51:12.500 --> 06:51:15.500
the dashboard advisory commission on special ed,

06:51:15.500 --> 06:51:17.060
I chaired the screening committee,

06:51:17.060 --> 06:51:20.740
we appointed so many amazing people to state commissions.

06:51:20.740 --> 06:51:23.020
I was liaison to the education and pointed

06:51:23.020 --> 06:51:24.980
to the education commission of the states

06:51:24.980 --> 06:51:26.500
and went to the communities of practice

06:51:26.500 --> 06:51:30.020
for science and math, the common core steering committee,

06:51:30.020 --> 06:51:32.540
and all of you will now get these things

06:51:32.540 --> 06:51:35.460
all reorganized to liaison responsibilities.

06:51:35.460 --> 06:51:38.420
Let me just say, these made my work on the board

06:51:38.420 --> 06:51:41.660
so amazing and valuable because I got to work

06:51:41.660 --> 06:51:44.060
with stakeholders and partners

06:51:44.060 --> 06:51:47.540
and working on improving our program.

06:51:47.540 --> 06:51:50.060
Let me just say that what I realized so much

06:51:50.060 --> 06:51:52.980
is the voices and the input matter,

06:51:52.980 --> 06:51:55.220
both in call-ins, both in letters,

06:51:55.220 --> 06:51:57.620
in our working groups and the input

06:51:57.620 --> 06:52:00.620
and that all the input of the voices

06:52:00.620 --> 06:52:03.340
helped improve all of our documents.

06:52:03.340 --> 06:52:04.700
The thing that I think about

06:52:04.700 --> 06:52:07.100
is that we have amazing frameworks

06:52:07.100 --> 06:52:09.700
that we develop as guidance documents

06:52:09.700 --> 06:52:11.460
to the field not required.

06:52:11.460 --> 06:52:13.380
And the thing that I would say to the field

06:52:13.380 --> 06:52:15.900
is before you do any adoptions for materials,

06:52:15.900 --> 06:52:19.220
spend some time using the guidance documents

06:52:19.220 --> 06:52:23.060
so your staff and faculty and leaders know what's there

06:52:23.060 --> 06:52:26.220
so that when they pick materials that we also have vetted,

06:52:26.220 --> 06:52:29.380
they'll have a good sense of what to choose.

06:52:29.380 --> 06:52:31.900
So that's a lesson that I think many of us have learned

06:52:31.900 --> 06:52:34.380
about the resources in our frameworks.

06:52:34.380 --> 06:52:39.060
And let me just say that the voices from policy development

06:52:39.060 --> 06:52:42.780
to practice and implementation are so important.

06:52:42.780 --> 06:52:44.060
We can create great policy,

06:52:44.060 --> 06:52:46.740
but if we don't build capacity for staff and leaders

06:52:46.740 --> 06:52:49.900
to do the implementation, we're not gonna change schools.

06:52:49.900 --> 06:52:53.340
So let me just say, we've learned that if you go slow,

06:52:53.340 --> 06:52:56.060
you actually go fast as you build capacity,

06:52:56.060 --> 06:52:59.620
that money matters, but what you do with it matters more.

06:52:59.660 --> 06:53:02.180
And I just have to say the dedication

06:53:02.180 --> 06:53:05.660
and the commitment at the state process is amazing.

06:53:05.660 --> 06:53:08.580
I'm incredibly optimistic going forward

06:53:08.580 --> 06:53:10.780
about the hope for schools.

06:53:10.780 --> 06:53:12.420
We have amazing funding.

06:53:12.420 --> 06:53:14.900
We have to support our teachers and leaders.

06:53:14.900 --> 06:53:19.900
And I can't think of a more wonderful opportunity

06:53:20.180 --> 06:53:22.540
than this really a capstone for me

06:53:22.540 --> 06:53:24.420
to help guide policy to practice.

06:53:24.420 --> 06:53:26.780
So thank you all for how hard you work

06:53:26.780 --> 06:53:28.700
for what you do every day.

06:53:28.700 --> 06:53:30.620
I look forward to continuing my connections

06:53:30.620 --> 06:53:34.020
with my friends and colleagues and my next chapter

06:53:34.020 --> 06:53:36.540
and with you, and I support the work ahead.

06:53:36.540 --> 06:53:37.380
And thank you.

06:53:37.380 --> 06:53:39.620
This has been the highest opportunity

06:53:39.620 --> 06:53:41.540
for public service in my career.

06:53:41.540 --> 06:53:43.700
And I thank you so much for the opportunity.

06:53:43.700 --> 06:53:44.540
Thank you.

06:53:45.580 --> 06:53:46.420
Thank you.

06:53:48.260 --> 06:53:49.260
Member Rucker.

06:53:50.500 --> 06:53:51.540
Thank you very much.

06:53:51.540 --> 06:53:54.700
And I will take your advice and offer my comments

06:53:54.700 --> 06:53:57.700
as well as my liaison report.

06:53:57.700 --> 06:54:01.580
I have served on this board for a reason and for a season.

06:54:01.580 --> 06:54:04.860
I have to begin by acknowledging the great support

06:54:04.860 --> 06:54:07.500
that I've received from my friends, my family,

06:54:07.500 --> 06:54:09.580
my colleagues and policy advocates

06:54:09.580 --> 06:54:11.180
in the education community,

06:54:11.180 --> 06:54:14.500
particularly at the California Teachers Association.

06:54:14.500 --> 06:54:16.980
Your expectations, your feedback,

06:54:16.980 --> 06:54:18.780
your arguments have sharpened me

06:54:18.780 --> 06:54:21.740
as a blade is honed by the fire and the hammer.

06:54:21.740 --> 06:54:23.500
I leave the board in this season

06:54:23.500 --> 06:54:26.340
that many are calling the winner of our discontent.

06:54:26.340 --> 06:54:29.020
Dr. Richard Levine was my college professor

06:54:29.020 --> 06:54:30.900
under whom I studied Shakespeare.

06:54:30.900 --> 06:54:34.100
And he taught me how to look in the darkness

06:54:34.100 --> 06:54:35.380
and find the light.

06:54:35.380 --> 06:54:38.380
While many people use this quote from Shakespeare

06:54:38.380 --> 06:54:40.180
at the start of a long complaint,

06:54:40.180 --> 06:54:42.620
I actually have a different view.

06:54:42.620 --> 06:54:46.180
There's nothing wrong with public education in California

06:54:46.180 --> 06:54:48.140
for the students who have been fortunate enough

06:54:48.140 --> 06:54:51.620
to attend a school that's safe, has small classes,

06:54:51.620 --> 06:54:54.820
properly trained teachers, supportive leadership.

06:54:54.820 --> 06:54:56.860
And if they're in classrooms with other students

06:54:56.860 --> 06:54:59.420
who are properly cared for and fed,

06:54:59.420 --> 06:55:01.900
if the school has adequate and appropriate programs

06:55:01.900 --> 06:55:03.940
for children who do not speak English

06:55:03.940 --> 06:55:06.300
and children who have special needs,

06:55:06.300 --> 06:55:07.900
if the facilities are modern,

06:55:07.900 --> 06:55:10.060
if the classes have up-to-date materials

06:55:10.060 --> 06:55:12.700
and active parent support is the norm.

06:55:12.700 --> 06:55:15.740
In the schools where the norms are not in place,

06:55:15.740 --> 06:55:18.740
the disparity in the access is more profound

06:55:18.740 --> 06:55:20.940
and these students as well as the educators

06:55:20.980 --> 06:55:24.860
who support them are faced with the hope

06:55:24.860 --> 06:55:27.580
that the board understands those priorities,

06:55:27.580 --> 06:55:30.140
understands their dilemmas and will do the work

06:55:30.140 --> 06:55:32.620
that's needed to create sustainable change.

06:55:32.620 --> 06:55:34.860
And that's been our mission in the entire time

06:55:34.860 --> 06:55:36.380
I have served on the board.

06:55:36.380 --> 06:55:38.420
These are the core values that have informed

06:55:38.420 --> 06:55:41.580
every conversation I've had, every letter I've written,

06:55:41.580 --> 06:55:43.220
every question I've asked

06:55:43.220 --> 06:55:46.140
and every professional decision I've ever made.

06:55:46.140 --> 06:55:49.620
Today we have a list and we've heard from so many people

06:55:49.660 --> 06:55:53.780
about our accomplishments and the milestones we've completed

06:55:53.780 --> 06:55:56.140
during the time I've worked on this board.

06:55:56.140 --> 06:55:58.860
For that time, despite the feelings we've had

06:55:58.860 --> 06:56:02.700
for the past couple of years, I truly feel optimistic.

06:56:02.700 --> 06:56:05.180
I think the unhappiness that has cloaked our hearts

06:56:05.180 --> 06:56:08.380
and our minds really is coming to an end.

06:56:08.380 --> 06:56:09.900
The work to get there though,

06:56:09.900 --> 06:56:12.700
to trudge through this quagmire remains.

06:56:12.700 --> 06:56:16.460
And I'm going to take with me so many fantastic memories

06:56:16.460 --> 06:56:18.860
and stories that I can share over dinner

06:56:18.860 --> 06:56:22.300
that nobody will believe like the time I played charades

06:56:22.300 --> 06:56:25.220
with Karen Ashley, Dead Sigmund and Tom Adams

06:56:25.220 --> 06:56:27.620
in a bar in Washington, DC.

06:56:27.620 --> 06:56:29.420
Although I have met many assignments

06:56:29.420 --> 06:56:30.660
while serving on the board,

06:56:30.660 --> 06:56:33.580
I'm going to focus my final liaison report

06:56:33.580 --> 06:56:35.860
on my principal assignments.

06:56:35.860 --> 06:56:38.700
The National Association of State Boards of Education.

06:56:38.700 --> 06:56:41.580
I truly appreciate the opportunity

06:56:41.580 --> 06:56:45.220
to participate in conferences and get the rich learning

06:56:45.220 --> 06:56:48.460
and professional development afforded by this organization.

06:56:48.460 --> 06:56:50.620
I was thrilled to represent our state

06:56:50.620 --> 06:56:53.740
on their whole child study group last year.

06:56:53.740 --> 06:56:55.540
Instructional Quality Commission.

06:56:55.540 --> 06:56:58.380
Mike Kurch appointed me when he was giving

06:56:58.380 --> 06:57:00.940
subject matter assignments to each of my colleagues,

06:57:00.940 --> 06:57:04.220
he handed me the IPC to start and set up this

06:57:04.220 --> 06:57:07.260
as a brand new entity that was established under law.

06:57:07.260 --> 06:57:10.340
So I want to thank Bill Honick who served as the first chair,

06:57:10.340 --> 06:57:12.940
as well as Tom Adams and Stephanie Gregson,

06:57:12.940 --> 06:57:15.260
who served as the executive director.

06:57:15.260 --> 06:57:18.420
I also want to recognize the talented practitioners

06:57:19.420 --> 06:57:21.260
who have sat with me through those IQC meetings

06:57:21.260 --> 06:57:22.900
and with whom I've had the opportunity

06:57:22.900 --> 06:57:25.140
to laugh and work and learn.

06:57:25.140 --> 06:57:27.860
I must also commend to you the energy, creativity

06:57:27.860 --> 06:57:29.980
and teamwork that are the high standards

06:57:29.980 --> 06:57:32.180
and norms among the Seaford staff

06:57:32.180 --> 06:57:34.980
who have supported the work of the IQC.

06:57:34.980 --> 06:57:36.340
I've also been the liaison

06:57:36.340 --> 06:57:40.380
to the California Military Interstate Children's

06:57:40.380 --> 06:57:41.980
Compact Commission.

06:57:41.980 --> 06:57:44.420
This assignment evolved from simply paying money

06:57:44.420 --> 06:57:47.260
for membership and approving a compact plan

06:57:47.260 --> 06:57:50.820
focused on making sure children who are military dependents

06:57:50.820 --> 06:57:53.940
have the right to transfer into the classes they need

06:57:53.940 --> 06:57:56.020
and to participate equitably in sports

06:57:56.020 --> 06:57:57.700
and other curricular activities,

06:57:57.700 --> 06:57:59.780
to deepening the work this year

06:57:59.780 --> 06:58:02.660
on looking at how to support students with IEPs

06:58:02.660 --> 06:58:05.260
as they move and transfer into our state.

06:58:05.260 --> 06:58:06.660
I want to thank in particular,

06:58:06.660 --> 06:58:09.380
J.C. Ragland for her diligent support

06:58:09.380 --> 06:58:11.460
to get me started with this project,

06:58:11.460 --> 06:58:13.140
as well as all the department staff

06:58:13.140 --> 06:58:16.460
who have helped to launch multiple related initiatives

06:58:16.460 --> 06:58:17.660
for this project.

06:58:17.660 --> 06:58:20.020
It's worth noting that this state's leadership

06:58:20.020 --> 06:58:22.580
helped to create the military identifier

06:58:22.580 --> 06:58:25.300
that's in our state data system.

06:58:25.300 --> 06:58:29.460
I've also worked with King Sun and Taliza Ortiz-Lee Cone

06:58:29.460 --> 06:58:31.740
on the California Workforce Pathways

06:58:31.740 --> 06:58:34.020
at Joint Advisory Committee.

06:58:34.020 --> 06:58:36.460
It was so wonderful and a great honor

06:58:36.460 --> 06:58:39.300
to restart this vital policy work group.

06:58:39.300 --> 06:58:42.020
That work will continue as they work to write

06:58:42.020 --> 06:58:43.820
and develop a new state plan

06:58:43.820 --> 06:58:45.980
for career and technical education.

06:58:45.980 --> 06:58:48.620
And I truly appreciate the deep thinking and dialogue

06:58:48.620 --> 06:58:51.380
that were the norm for discussion on this panel,

06:58:51.380 --> 06:58:53.060
and I will truly miss that.

06:58:53.060 --> 06:58:56.740
There were multiple staff who worked to support this project

06:58:56.740 --> 06:59:00.340
and this game, principally led by the CTE division,

06:59:00.340 --> 06:59:01.900
as well as Dr. Shinny Weber

06:59:01.900 --> 06:59:04.340
from the Community College Chancellor's Office.

06:59:04.340 --> 06:59:06.860
I was also thrilled to be the hostess,

06:59:06.860 --> 06:59:09.420
or to at least be the opening act

06:59:09.420 --> 06:59:11.860
for the California Early Maths Symposium.

06:59:11.860 --> 06:59:14.220
I was thrilled to work with board staff,

06:59:14.220 --> 06:59:16.380
particularly Carolyn Pfister,

06:59:16.380 --> 06:59:21.380
to support the beginning of this curriculum and symposium.

06:59:21.580 --> 06:59:24.340
The 2021 conference welcomed participants

06:59:24.340 --> 06:59:25.820
from around the world.

06:59:25.820 --> 06:59:27.020
As the board moves forward

06:59:27.020 --> 06:59:29.660
to approve the math framework later this year,

06:59:29.660 --> 06:59:31.180
I know the breadth and depth

06:59:31.180 --> 06:59:34.140
of the conference breakout sessions for this symposium

06:59:34.140 --> 06:59:35.980
will continue to grow.

06:59:35.980 --> 06:59:38.900
I also worked on the significant

06:59:38.900 --> 06:59:40.780
disproportionality work group.

06:59:41.660 --> 06:59:43.900
California can be proud of its federal reporting

06:59:43.900 --> 06:59:46.540
and accountability actions that you heard of earlier,

06:59:46.540 --> 06:59:47.900
but I also want to point out

06:59:47.900 --> 06:59:49.980
that the focus of this particular work group

06:59:49.980 --> 06:59:51.300
has shifted now.

06:59:51.300 --> 06:59:53.620
The issues of over-referral of students of color,

06:59:53.620 --> 06:59:55.700
particularly of African-American boys,

06:59:55.700 --> 06:59:59.340
is going to be the focus of problem-solving sessions

06:59:59.340 --> 07:00:03.300
and the agenda for this work group going forward.

07:00:03.300 --> 07:00:05.540
I applaud the initiatives of this work group

07:00:05.540 --> 07:00:08.900
being led by Shiloh Bracero and Hella Calamese

07:00:08.900 --> 07:00:11.980
as they guide the work group in this attention shift

07:00:11.980 --> 07:00:14.540
and focus on problem-solving.

07:00:14.540 --> 07:00:16.820
And finally, for my colleagues on the board,

07:00:16.820 --> 07:00:20.140
I want to thank you for your patience and your due diligence

07:00:20.140 --> 07:00:24.260
in supporting all of the work that I have done

07:00:24.260 --> 07:00:26.060
as it relates to waivers.

07:00:26.060 --> 07:00:28.420
On every single agenda of this board,

07:00:28.420 --> 07:00:31.220
there's a large docket of waiver items.

07:00:31.220 --> 07:00:34.980
I want to thank Judy Sias and all the staff in the department

07:00:34.980 --> 07:00:37.300
with whom I've had the real honor of working with

07:00:37.300 --> 07:00:40.660
and reviewing and preparing these waiver items.

07:00:40.700 --> 07:00:42.180
You have been patient tutors,

07:00:42.180 --> 07:00:45.580
as I learned about selling surplus school properties,

07:00:45.580 --> 07:00:49.100
approving adjustments and bond and indebtedness

07:00:49.100 --> 07:00:51.020
and school board races.

07:00:51.020 --> 07:00:52.900
I'm also grateful for the dialogue

07:00:52.900 --> 07:00:54.740
as we've discussed what it means

07:00:54.740 --> 07:00:57.700
to consider the best interest of the student served

07:00:57.700 --> 07:00:59.300
by approving these waivers.

07:01:00.700 --> 07:01:02.820
You've heard, for those of you who are regular attendees

07:01:02.820 --> 07:01:03.660
to the board meetings,

07:01:03.660 --> 07:01:05.500
you've often heard me mention the fairy tale,

07:01:05.500 --> 07:01:08.620
Sleeping Beauty, as a reference to the fearful lesson

07:01:08.660 --> 07:01:11.180
of failure in naming the all.

07:01:11.180 --> 07:01:13.260
There really are too many names to mention

07:01:13.260 --> 07:01:15.380
and too many projects to review.

07:01:15.380 --> 07:01:17.500
If I did not name those projects

07:01:17.500 --> 07:01:19.220
or I did not name you in particular,

07:01:19.220 --> 07:01:22.300
it's not because I forgot or I didn't think about you,

07:01:22.300 --> 07:01:24.500
but there just is not enough time.

07:01:24.500 --> 07:01:27.180
In all that work, there have been many great days

07:01:27.180 --> 07:01:29.580
and many, many hard conversations.

07:01:29.580 --> 07:01:32.820
As a policy body, I feel we have modeled good practice

07:01:32.820 --> 07:01:35.460
for inclusion and public engagement,

07:01:35.460 --> 07:01:38.180
and I'm confident that work will continue.

07:01:38.260 --> 07:01:41.220
So I will close with this one thought and this one quote.

07:01:41.220 --> 07:01:42.820
You know, I'm a reformed English teacher,

07:01:42.820 --> 07:01:44.940
so I'm always going to give you a quote.

07:01:44.940 --> 07:01:46.740
Abraham Lincoln said,

07:01:46.740 --> 07:01:48.740
we must not be enemies.

07:01:48.740 --> 07:01:50.260
We must not be enemies.

07:01:50.260 --> 07:01:52.780
Though passion may have strained it,

07:01:52.780 --> 07:01:55.500
it must not break our bonds of affection.

07:01:55.500 --> 07:01:59.020
The mystic chords of memory will swell again when touched,

07:01:59.020 --> 07:02:01.060
as surely as they will be

07:02:01.060 --> 07:02:03.260
by the better angels of our nature.

07:02:03.260 --> 07:02:04.260
Thank you so much.

07:02:05.100 --> 07:02:05.940
Thank you.

07:02:07.340 --> 07:02:09.940
And you know, Ting, I'm going to come back to you

07:02:09.940 --> 07:02:12.860
at the end because when you were reporting,

07:02:12.860 --> 07:02:16.780
we didn't have this second part of the report in mind.

07:02:16.780 --> 07:02:19.780
So, but I am going to move now to member Rodriguez

07:02:19.780 --> 07:02:22.220
as we go through the alphabetical list.

07:02:23.540 --> 07:02:24.380
Okay.

07:02:25.700 --> 07:02:30.700
The CTC is proactively addressing the teachers.

07:02:30.700 --> 07:02:33.620
Actually, okay, so I'm giving a round of applause

07:02:33.900 --> 07:02:34.940
I'm giving a report.

07:02:35.940 --> 07:02:38.700
I'm liaison to the CTC and CESA.

07:02:40.020 --> 07:02:41.140
And I hope I got that right.

07:02:41.140 --> 07:02:43.260
I always confuse it with CESA.

07:02:43.260 --> 07:02:48.260
But so the CTC meeting in December proactively addressed

07:02:51.180 --> 07:02:53.780
the teacher shortage and a few of the steps

07:02:53.780 --> 07:02:58.620
that they have taken with regard to the current issues

07:02:58.620 --> 07:03:00.180
that they're facing.

07:03:00.180 --> 07:03:03.340
First of all, teacher candidates were given more time

07:03:04.060 --> 07:03:07.500
to complete tests required to earn a teaching credential

07:03:07.500 --> 07:03:10.100
and learn that their coursework could be taken

07:03:10.100 --> 07:03:12.180
to replace some tests.

07:03:13.900 --> 07:03:16.460
At the meeting, the CTC also extended the deadline

07:03:16.460 --> 07:03:20.740
for teachers to take the RECA, the C-BEST

07:03:20.740 --> 07:03:25.500
and the California subject examination, CESA.

07:03:25.500 --> 07:03:30.500
So about 20% of our state's testing centers are closed.

07:03:31.460 --> 07:03:34.180
Fresno and Oakland are among the areas

07:03:34.180 --> 07:03:38.300
with the least access to testing for teacher candidates.

07:03:38.300 --> 07:03:40.540
And some of the students are taking advantage

07:03:40.540 --> 07:03:42.940
of the online testing options.

07:03:44.500 --> 07:03:47.300
In July, the state budget trailer bill

07:03:47.300 --> 07:03:51.380
provided details for implementing new K through 12 programs

07:03:51.380 --> 07:03:54.580
in the budget and gave teacher candidates

07:03:54.580 --> 07:03:57.940
who were unable to take the required test due to COVID

07:03:57.940 --> 07:04:01.460
until December 31st to complete the tests.

07:04:01.460 --> 07:04:05.020
And the CTC has the authority to extend those deadlines.

07:04:06.580 --> 07:04:07.780
Let's see here.

07:04:07.780 --> 07:04:10.420
The commission unanimously approved

07:04:10.420 --> 07:04:13.180
bilingual authorization 20 hours.

07:04:13.180 --> 07:04:16.900
It was a unanimous approval by CTC commissioners,

07:04:16.900 --> 07:04:21.020
the new bilingual authorization standards, the BTPs,

07:04:21.020 --> 07:04:23.820
and as I said, the 20 hours of field work

07:04:23.820 --> 07:04:25.700
for the bilingual teacher candidates.

07:04:26.620 --> 07:04:31.620
And for the CESA, we had a board meeting on December 16th

07:04:32.620 --> 07:04:37.620
and CESA has renewed its three-year contract with CalArts.

07:04:38.340 --> 07:04:41.260
There were some issues with the renegotiation process

07:04:41.260 --> 07:04:46.260
on that, as you'll hear about as I continue,

07:04:47.140 --> 07:04:49.780
but the three-year contract has been renewed.

07:04:50.460 --> 07:04:55.460
Tuition was at 250 for the 2022 summer session.

07:05:02.260 --> 07:05:06.980
The last time CESA ran an in-person program,

07:05:06.980 --> 07:05:11.460
the tuition in 2019, the tuition was $2,000.

07:05:11.460 --> 07:05:14.340
So that's quite an increase,

07:05:14.340 --> 07:05:19.340
but it's due in part to the fact that

07:05:19.860 --> 07:05:24.740
CalArts has also raised its price for CESA.

07:05:24.740 --> 07:05:28.300
The trustees voted to increase tuition even higher

07:05:28.300 --> 07:05:32.100
to incur additional funding for low-income students

07:05:32.100 --> 07:05:33.780
from across the state.

07:05:33.780 --> 07:05:37.500
So currently, 30% of CESA students on average

07:05:37.500 --> 07:05:39.740
are attending with financial aid.

07:05:39.740 --> 07:05:41.500
The increased tuition will allow

07:05:41.500 --> 07:05:45.140
for almost half the students to attend with aid.

07:05:46.700 --> 07:05:49.380
We'll also be able to increase the scholarship amounts,

07:05:49.980 --> 07:05:51.940
and that's very important to the trustees

07:05:51.940 --> 07:05:55.420
to make sure that students who are underrepresented,

07:05:56.540 --> 07:05:59.500
students of color, low socioeconomic status,

07:05:59.500 --> 07:06:01.980
are represented at the California Summer School

07:06:01.980 --> 07:06:02.820
for the Arts.

07:06:03.980 --> 07:06:05.780
So even with the increase,

07:06:06.660 --> 07:06:11.140
the cost to attend CESA is still dramatically,

07:06:11.140 --> 07:06:13.100
I use the word dramatically on purpose,

07:06:13.100 --> 07:06:15.660
dramatically below public

07:06:15.660 --> 07:06:18.900
and private four-week residential programs in date.

07:06:19.820 --> 07:06:23.700
The trustees also voted to restrict the program

07:06:23.700 --> 07:06:27.260
to in-state students only for 2022.

07:06:28.500 --> 07:06:30.060
As the students are minors,

07:06:31.460 --> 07:06:33.700
they can't reasonably send international

07:06:33.700 --> 07:06:35.540
or out-of-state students home

07:06:35.540 --> 07:06:38.820
who may test positive for COVID-19 upon arrival

07:06:38.820 --> 07:06:40.340
or during the program.

07:06:40.340 --> 07:06:44.260
So that is, it was only a vote for this summer,

07:06:45.020 --> 07:06:46.860
and that concludes my reports.

07:06:47.940 --> 07:06:49.180
Thank you very much.

07:06:50.740 --> 07:06:52.140
Member Patia Brownson.

07:06:57.620 --> 07:07:02.420
So I will highlight two recent task force

07:07:02.420 --> 07:07:06.900
and convenings that deal with the Black Student Achievement

07:07:06.900 --> 07:07:09.780
Task Force with the Department of Education,

07:07:09.780 --> 07:07:14.780
as well as the UTK or UPK and P2-3 Constellation approach

07:07:15.980 --> 07:07:18.540
also with the Department of Education.

07:07:18.540 --> 07:07:22.140
So Superintendent Thurman, who was here earlier,

07:07:22.140 --> 07:07:26.820
but I think actually is now at the task force meeting,

07:07:26.820 --> 07:07:31.820
which I will be joining shortly after we finish here

07:07:32.260 --> 07:07:34.140
around the Black Student Achievement Task Force,

07:07:34.140 --> 07:07:37.380
which has been focusing on teacher diversity,

07:07:37.420 --> 07:07:38.540
academic achievement,

07:07:38.540 --> 07:07:41.300
housing, homelessness, and foster youth,

07:07:41.300 --> 07:07:45.020
the school to prison pipeline, and mental health.

07:07:45.020 --> 07:07:50.020
Recommendations will be coming from a group of luminaries,

07:07:50.100 --> 07:07:52.500
really from across the state, from academia,

07:07:52.500 --> 07:07:55.140
from community-based organizations,

07:07:55.140 --> 07:07:57.460
from school district leadership

07:07:57.460 --> 07:07:59.580
to really dig into this issue

07:07:59.580 --> 07:08:02.220
and make recommendations for the department

07:08:02.220 --> 07:08:06.940
to consider moving forward in the next couple of years.

07:08:06.940 --> 07:08:10.620
The second body that I wanted to highlight

07:08:10.620 --> 07:08:15.620
is looking at the rollout and excitedly implementation now

07:08:17.740 --> 07:08:22.740
of what has been the master plan for early childhood.

07:08:23.020 --> 07:08:26.020
So looking at universal transitional kindergarten

07:08:26.020 --> 07:08:28.700
and the P2-3 pipeline.

07:08:28.700 --> 07:08:31.100
I've been participating in the partnership communications

07:08:31.100 --> 07:08:32.180
and strategy group,

07:08:32.180 --> 07:08:36.420
which crosses a number of different agencies

07:08:36.420 --> 07:08:41.420
and leaders and really focusing on how to make sure

07:08:41.500 --> 07:08:45.500
that a cross-section of leaders from LEAs,

07:08:45.500 --> 07:08:49.220
among them teachers, superintendents, administrators,

07:08:49.220 --> 07:08:52.340
as well as early childhood community-based providers

07:08:52.340 --> 07:08:56.500
and families all understand what some of the offerings

07:08:56.500 --> 07:08:59.780
and opportunities are that are rapidly upcoming.

07:08:59.780 --> 07:09:03.460
So just as a reminder, last year in the budget,

07:09:03.460 --> 07:09:06.220
universal transitional kindergarten was adopted

07:09:07.020 --> 07:09:08.220
with this year as planning,

07:09:08.220 --> 07:09:12.100
but we will very soon be implementing UTK

07:09:12.100 --> 07:09:15.340
in this next school year, which is very exciting.

07:09:15.340 --> 07:09:18.780
And also there's a lot to do and a lot of outreach

07:09:18.780 --> 07:09:21.060
to make sure that all of the partners understand

07:09:21.060 --> 07:09:22.820
what the different roles are,

07:09:22.820 --> 07:09:25.300
what the potential to grow opportunities

07:09:25.300 --> 07:09:26.860
for three-year-olds in particular,

07:09:26.860 --> 07:09:28.260
what the opportunities are

07:09:28.260 --> 07:09:30.820
for universal transitional kindergarten,

07:09:30.820 --> 07:09:34.100
and then also how does that connect to the pipeline

07:09:34.100 --> 07:09:38.140
for going up to third grade in early elementary

07:09:38.140 --> 07:09:41.260
and early literacy, which also is exciting to see

07:09:41.260 --> 07:09:43.460
in the unveiling of the budget.

07:09:44.660 --> 07:09:47.180
Was that yesterday, earlier this week?

07:09:47.180 --> 07:09:50.020
The timeframe is now a little stretchy,

07:09:51.380 --> 07:09:54.060
but I think with all of those,

07:09:54.060 --> 07:09:58.780
there's a real mirror to some of the conversations

07:09:58.780 --> 07:10:01.140
we've had today about how to ensure

07:10:01.140 --> 07:10:03.700
that these are not one-off programs,

07:10:04.260 --> 07:10:05.100
but that they are integrated,

07:10:05.100 --> 07:10:10.100
that they actually layer in ways that are cohesive

07:10:10.340 --> 07:10:12.660
so that when we have the conversation

07:10:12.660 --> 07:10:16.500
about community schools, about universal food programs,

07:10:16.500 --> 07:10:20.220
about the EL Roadmap, about MTSS,

07:10:20.220 --> 07:10:22.020
that these are all being brought to bear

07:10:22.020 --> 07:10:24.980
and made available for young children

07:10:24.980 --> 07:10:27.500
across the continuum as well.

07:10:27.500 --> 07:10:30.500
Last thing I'll just say as a point of gratitude

07:10:30.500 --> 07:10:33.620
is my kids go to LAUSD schools,

07:10:34.500 --> 07:10:37.820
and I live in the LAUSD attendance areas.

07:10:37.820 --> 07:10:40.260
We just opened up schools.

07:10:40.260 --> 07:10:44.540
I just wanna offer gratitude for all of the school leaders

07:10:44.540 --> 07:10:47.860
who in the last two weeks have reopened schools.

07:10:47.860 --> 07:10:51.580
It has not been easy, and we as a state

07:10:51.580 --> 07:10:53.740
have committed to it and are making it happen

07:10:53.740 --> 07:10:56.900
in ways that have not been straightforward,

07:10:56.900 --> 07:11:00.580
but are profoundly impactful for children's learning.

07:11:00.580 --> 07:11:05.580
I also wanna voice gratitude for all of the parents

07:11:05.740 --> 07:11:07.820
who are trusting us to get this right

07:11:07.820 --> 07:11:10.860
and who are bringing their children ready to learn

07:11:10.860 --> 07:11:13.140
and will be on this journey with us.

07:11:13.140 --> 07:11:13.980
So thank you.

07:11:15.300 --> 07:11:17.060
Perfect, thank you.

07:11:17.060 --> 07:11:19.460
I would second any motion.

07:11:19.460 --> 07:11:20.520
Member McQuillan.

07:11:21.620 --> 07:11:23.060
Yes, well said.

07:11:24.460 --> 07:11:29.460
Briefly, not a lot since we had the break in December,

07:11:29.500 --> 07:11:33.220
I know a lot of people are stressed right now in our schools,

07:11:33.220 --> 07:11:35.740
so I definitely second what was just said.

07:11:37.260 --> 07:11:39.940
Looking forward to the California

07:11:39.940 --> 07:11:44.940
work joint pathways group that focuses on CTE.

07:11:45.540 --> 07:11:49.340
We're meeting on Friday, the January 21st

07:11:49.340 --> 07:11:51.620
to continue to work there.

07:11:51.620 --> 07:11:56.060
I also have been invited to the committee,

07:11:56.060 --> 07:11:59.940
the American Indian Oversight Committee for CTE

07:11:59.940 --> 07:12:03.740
that meets this Friday just to give a bit of a report,

07:12:03.740 --> 07:12:06.660
and I think there'll be a real focus on curriculum

07:12:06.660 --> 07:12:09.620
for Native American studies throughout the state

07:12:09.620 --> 07:12:11.060
in their discussion.

07:12:11.060 --> 07:12:14.500
Looking forward to that, but considering the late hour,

07:12:14.500 --> 07:12:16.300
that's all I have to say, thank you.

07:12:17.620 --> 07:12:20.320
Thank you very much, but exciting work.

07:12:22.140 --> 07:12:23.300
Member Glover-Woods.

07:12:24.300 --> 07:12:27.340
I do not have a formal liaison report,

07:12:27.340 --> 07:12:30.180
I just want to send congratulations

07:12:30.180 --> 07:12:34.500
to the recent appointees to the ACSE and the IQC,

07:12:34.500 --> 07:12:38.060
and also gratitude to Member Sun,

07:12:38.060 --> 07:12:41.420
and who will always be to me, Vice President Strauss

07:12:41.420 --> 07:12:44.460
for the leadership on the screening committee

07:12:44.460 --> 07:12:47.540
and all of the work that was done to bring

07:12:47.540 --> 07:12:50.460
two fine candidates forward for consideration today.

07:12:50.940 --> 07:12:53.060
Thank you, and Member Escobedo.

07:12:55.140 --> 07:12:57.580
Yes, I'm excited to report that,

07:12:57.580 --> 07:13:00.540
and I believe it was during mid-December,

07:13:01.500 --> 07:13:04.500
West Ed was awarded a new five-year contract

07:13:04.500 --> 07:13:08.500
to continue to serve as the Regional Educational Laboratory

07:13:08.500 --> 07:13:12.580
West that serves Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah,

07:13:12.580 --> 07:13:17.580
and they were first selected to be in this position

07:13:17.980 --> 07:13:22.980
in 1966, so that's quite an impressive track record,

07:13:24.540 --> 07:13:28.140
and almost simultaneously, they were also selected

07:13:28.140 --> 07:13:32.380
to serve as the Regional Educational Laboratory Northwest,

07:13:32.380 --> 07:13:36.060
which serves Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon,

07:13:36.060 --> 07:13:39.900
and Washington, so this will allow West Ed

07:13:39.900 --> 07:13:43.580
to extend and deepen their partnership services

07:13:43.620 --> 07:13:47.780
and support really throughout the whole Western region

07:13:47.780 --> 07:13:51.540
of our country, so that's great to report.

07:13:51.540 --> 07:13:55.940
Also, we're ending our time with the initiative

07:13:55.940 --> 07:14:00.740
and our workgroups, I'm the co-chair

07:14:00.740 --> 07:14:04.780
of the bilingual multilingual group

07:14:04.780 --> 07:14:09.780
on sharing best practices on enhancing literacy

07:14:09.940 --> 07:14:12.780
for our state, and I believe Friday

07:14:12.780 --> 07:14:15.780
is our final sharing meeting.

07:14:15.780 --> 07:14:18.860
I look forward to sharing some of the results

07:14:18.860 --> 07:14:23.540
of that amazing initiative by the superintendent

07:14:23.540 --> 07:14:25.380
for our next meeting.

07:14:25.380 --> 07:14:26.220
Terrific.

07:14:29.100 --> 07:14:31.740
I'm gonna wait and just say a word at the end,

07:14:31.740 --> 07:14:35.260
and Member Burr, the mic comes to you.

07:14:35.260 --> 07:14:36.900
Thank you.

07:14:36.900 --> 07:14:40.340
First, I'd like to report on my major liaison work

07:14:40.340 --> 07:14:43.940
with the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence.

07:14:43.940 --> 07:14:47.900
We met, our last board meeting was December 2nd,

07:14:47.900 --> 07:14:50.180
and we had a very thorough report

07:14:50.180 --> 07:14:52.500
from Executive Director Matt Navo,

07:14:52.500 --> 07:14:55.580
who spent really his initial months

07:14:55.580 --> 07:14:59.260
as our new executive director between August and December,

07:14:59.260 --> 07:15:03.420
engaged in a major stakeholder feedback sessions.

07:15:03.420 --> 07:15:07.100
He engaged with over 20 educational agencies

07:15:07.100 --> 07:15:10.780
that represented over 140 of our educational partners

07:15:11.740 --> 07:15:15.700
to really sort of dive deep about what CCE was doing well,

07:15:15.700 --> 07:15:17.300
what they needed to improve on,

07:15:17.300 --> 07:15:21.180
how they needed to, what they needed to do going forward

07:15:21.180 --> 07:15:24.100
in the environment in which we're all operating.

07:15:24.100 --> 07:15:27.620
And as a result of that, there's been kind of a re-imagining

07:15:27.620 --> 07:15:31.580
of the vision of CCE, the mission of CCE,

07:15:31.660 --> 07:15:34.140
and the value of CCE.

07:15:34.140 --> 07:15:36.420
And probably the most important work

07:15:36.420 --> 07:15:39.980
is to identify the organization in such a way

07:15:39.980 --> 07:15:42.820
that our stakeholders and our educational partners

07:15:42.820 --> 07:15:45.180
better understand what our work is.

07:15:45.180 --> 07:15:49.780
So Matt and his team have organized around three centers,

07:15:49.780 --> 07:15:53.900
the Center for Statewide Instruction Improvement and Impact,

07:15:53.900 --> 07:15:57.940
the Statewide Center for Teaching, Learning, and Leading,

07:15:57.940 --> 07:16:00.260
and the Center for Transformative Systems

07:16:00.260 --> 07:16:03.300
for Equitable Educational Outcomes.

07:16:03.300 --> 07:16:06.660
So I encourage you all to, if you're interested,

07:16:06.660 --> 07:16:10.780
do a deeper dive into these changes.

07:16:10.780 --> 07:16:13.140
They're all available on the website.

07:16:13.140 --> 07:16:16.420
You can look at Matt's report for the December meeting,

07:16:16.420 --> 07:16:18.780
and I think it will give you a good sense.

07:16:18.780 --> 07:16:22.020
We had a presentation at the board meeting

07:16:22.020 --> 07:16:26.220
from the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Leading,

07:16:26.220 --> 07:16:30.180
which is the center that's headed now by Stephanie Gregson.

07:16:30.740 --> 07:16:32.260
Much of their work has to do

07:16:32.260 --> 07:16:34.260
with the direct technical assistance.

07:16:34.260 --> 07:16:36.500
As I think you know, there are a handful

07:16:36.500 --> 07:16:38.460
of school districts that have been identified

07:16:38.460 --> 07:16:40.620
for direct technical assistance,

07:16:40.620 --> 07:16:44.460
and we had a report on the success of those districts.

07:16:44.460 --> 07:16:48.260
Stephanie is also leading as part of that work

07:16:48.260 --> 07:16:52.220
the Accelerated Learning Grant opportunities.

07:16:52.220 --> 07:16:56.740
The RFP has been issued for the $45 million

07:16:56.740 --> 07:16:59.140
that's available to LEAs

07:16:59.140 --> 07:17:02.060
for Accelerated Learning opportunities,

07:17:03.100 --> 07:17:07.260
and those RFPs are due on January 28th.

07:17:07.260 --> 07:17:09.860
So I'll take just a second.

07:17:09.860 --> 07:17:13.420
First, I want to, gratitude seems to be the word

07:17:13.420 --> 07:17:15.260
that we're all throwing around.

07:17:15.260 --> 07:17:17.380
First, I want to express my deep gratitude

07:17:17.380 --> 07:17:19.260
to President Darling-Hammond

07:17:19.260 --> 07:17:21.300
for separating out these comments,

07:17:21.300 --> 07:17:24.100
because if I had to do this first thing this morning,

07:17:24.100 --> 07:17:25.900
it would have been a different story.

07:17:26.780 --> 07:17:30.860
It was so, I was so moved by all of the comments

07:17:30.860 --> 07:17:32.820
that certainly my colleagues made,

07:17:32.820 --> 07:17:35.820
but the other, our other partners,

07:17:35.820 --> 07:17:38.300
Governor Brown, President Kurst,

07:17:38.300 --> 07:17:42.940
and Karen Staub-Walter's made on our behalf.

07:17:42.940 --> 07:17:46.100
So let me just continue the gratitude feelings.

07:17:46.100 --> 07:17:48.940
First, to Governor Brown and to Governor Newsom

07:17:48.940 --> 07:17:52.460
for providing me with the opportunity of a lifetime

07:17:52.460 --> 07:17:54.980
to serve the public students of California.

07:17:55.980 --> 07:18:00.060
I want to express my deep gratitude to my board colleagues,

07:18:00.060 --> 07:18:01.780
the current board colleagues,

07:18:01.780 --> 07:18:05.060
and I will just say I have a little deep sense of regret

07:18:05.060 --> 07:18:07.820
that I didn't get to know you all in person,

07:18:07.820 --> 07:18:11.100
because as some members made comments earlier today,

07:18:11.100 --> 07:18:14.020
I think with those of us who've been on the board

07:18:14.020 --> 07:18:17.260
for a long time, creating the relationships

07:18:17.260 --> 07:18:20.620
and spending the time together that we were able to,

07:18:20.620 --> 07:18:22.780
really enriched our work.

07:18:23.020 --> 07:18:26.180
I think it was an opportunity to identify

07:18:26.180 --> 07:18:29.780
everybody's unique skills and perspectives,

07:18:29.780 --> 07:18:33.580
and that helped us work in a very cohesive manner,

07:18:33.580 --> 07:18:35.780
again, to improve the lives, I hope,

07:18:35.780 --> 07:18:38.740
of all of our California students.

07:18:38.740 --> 07:18:43.740
I think this cohesive opportunity and policy deliberation

07:18:44.420 --> 07:18:47.780
was really under the incredible guidance,

07:18:47.780 --> 07:18:52.020
first of Mike Kurst and now of President Linda Darling-Hammond

07:18:52.020 --> 07:18:56.300
that create a vision and the opportunity for all of us

07:18:56.300 --> 07:19:00.900
to work together again, to apply our unique expertise.

07:19:00.900 --> 07:19:04.460
And as someone said this morning, we didn't always agree,

07:19:04.460 --> 07:19:06.700
but we always respect each other,

07:19:06.700 --> 07:19:09.940
and we really value the opinion of every single person

07:19:09.940 --> 07:19:11.140
that we've worked with.

07:19:12.380 --> 07:19:13.860
I also want to take an opportunity

07:19:13.860 --> 07:19:17.500
to especially recognize the student board members,

07:19:17.500 --> 07:19:20.060
with whom I've had the pleasure of serving

07:19:20.060 --> 07:19:23.100
and honor of serving over the past nine years.

07:19:23.980 --> 07:19:26.140
These young people, as you all know,

07:19:26.140 --> 07:19:28.860
are incredibly talented and busy,

07:19:28.860 --> 07:19:32.380
as we heard earlier with our United States

07:19:32.380 --> 07:19:37.260
Senate Youth Leaders, but they have always been prepared

07:19:37.260 --> 07:19:39.980
and unbelievably diligent in their service

07:19:39.980 --> 07:19:42.380
to the State Board of Education.

07:19:42.380 --> 07:19:44.620
They've provided invaluable voice

07:19:44.620 --> 07:19:47.020
and contributions to the board,

07:19:47.020 --> 07:19:49.340
and their commitment to public service

07:19:49.340 --> 07:19:51.420
gives me great hope for the future.

07:19:53.220 --> 07:19:58.220
I also cannot say enough about the State Board staff

07:19:59.540 --> 07:20:01.740
and the Department of Education staff.

07:20:03.380 --> 07:20:05.420
Board member Rucker attempted to name people.

07:20:05.420 --> 07:20:06.820
I'm not even going to try to do that

07:20:06.820 --> 07:20:10.620
because I don't want to leave anybody out

07:20:10.620 --> 07:20:12.820
that I've had the opportunity to work with.

07:20:12.820 --> 07:20:16.900
But just to say, without their unbelievable dedication

07:20:16.900 --> 07:20:21.020
and expertise, our board deliberations and decisions

07:20:21.020 --> 07:20:22.940
really would not be possible.

07:20:22.940 --> 07:20:25.260
As you all know, this is a hard job,

07:20:25.260 --> 07:20:28.420
and you have to have an unbelievable depth of knowledge

07:20:28.420 --> 07:20:30.660
to do the work that we do.

07:20:30.660 --> 07:20:34.260
So my heartfelt thanks and gratitude

07:20:34.260 --> 07:20:38.500
to every single member of the Department of Education staff

07:20:38.500 --> 07:20:41.860
and the State Board staff for all of their help.

07:20:41.860 --> 07:20:45.780
And related to that, I also want to express my thanks,

07:20:45.780 --> 07:20:48.820
especially to Superintendent Torlakson,

07:20:48.820 --> 07:20:51.780
and also to Superintendent Thurman,

07:20:51.780 --> 07:20:54.300
who really have worked collaboratively

07:20:54.300 --> 07:20:56.540
with the State Board of Education

07:20:56.540 --> 07:20:58.860
to ensure the highest quality education

07:20:58.860 --> 07:21:01.140
for our students of California.

07:21:01.140 --> 07:21:03.940
As many of you know, when I started this journey

07:21:03.940 --> 07:21:06.940
11 years ago as executive director,

07:21:06.940 --> 07:21:09.700
to say that the relationship between the board

07:21:09.700 --> 07:21:12.660
and the Department of Education was prickly

07:21:12.660 --> 07:21:14.180
is an understatement.

07:21:15.140 --> 07:21:17.980
And so it really, I took it upon myself

07:21:17.980 --> 07:21:21.380
as my personal mission to try to improve that,

07:21:21.380 --> 07:21:23.060
because I didn't, I thought it was working

07:21:23.060 --> 07:21:25.940
at cross purposes for everyone in the state.

07:21:25.940 --> 07:21:27.980
And I hope that I had a little part

07:21:27.980 --> 07:21:31.060
in helping to improve that and making sure

07:21:31.060 --> 07:21:33.820
that everybody was pulling in the same direction.

07:21:34.740 --> 07:21:38.100
So I just will close by saying good luck

07:21:38.100 --> 07:21:41.860
to all of my colleagues that will be continuing

07:21:41.900 --> 07:21:45.020
all of your future endeavors of the board.

07:21:45.020 --> 07:21:48.020
I do stand ready to assist in any way I can

07:21:48.020 --> 07:21:50.580
in my unofficial capacity.

07:21:50.580 --> 07:21:54.060
I do think the future is bright for all of us.

07:21:54.060 --> 07:21:56.420
We have to get a little dark cloud kind of hanging

07:21:56.420 --> 07:21:58.820
over our head that we're trying to get out from under.

07:21:58.820 --> 07:22:02.940
But once we do, I'm full of optimism.

07:22:02.940 --> 07:22:04.380
And to continue the theme,

07:22:04.380 --> 07:22:07.540
my grandkids are counting on you.

07:22:07.540 --> 07:22:09.020
Thank you.

07:22:09.020 --> 07:22:10.100
Awesome, thank you.

07:22:10.940 --> 07:22:14.660
I'm gonna go to board member Bonanca.

07:22:16.460 --> 07:22:18.940
Thank you, President Darling-Hammond.

07:22:18.940 --> 07:22:21.940
In terms of my liaison activities,

07:22:21.940 --> 07:22:23.860
last month I had the privilege

07:22:23.860 --> 07:22:26.700
of attending the annual CSBA conference

07:22:26.700 --> 07:22:30.180
where I participated in the student board member program.

07:22:30.180 --> 07:22:32.380
And I was able to meet student board members

07:22:32.380 --> 07:22:34.700
from all across the state and just listen

07:22:34.700 --> 07:22:37.060
to their perspectives of how COVID

07:22:37.060 --> 07:22:39.300
has affected their district.

07:22:39.300 --> 07:22:41.060
And I felt like I was really able to learn

07:22:41.060 --> 07:22:44.020
from their wisdom and hear what they've identified

07:22:44.020 --> 07:22:47.500
as issues that their students have been facing.

07:22:47.500 --> 07:22:50.460
And I know that one of the most prevalent issues

07:22:50.460 --> 07:22:51.980
that I heard at that conference

07:22:51.980 --> 07:22:54.620
was just the issue of mental health

07:22:54.620 --> 07:22:57.460
and how the pandemic has really affected that.

07:22:57.460 --> 07:22:59.660
And I'm just so proud to see that a lot of our work

07:22:59.660 --> 07:23:02.020
on the board really focuses on student mental health.

07:23:02.020 --> 07:23:03.900
And that's still just always

07:23:03.900 --> 07:23:05.980
at the forefront of our thought.

07:23:06.500 --> 07:23:09.900
I'm also working on picking up

07:23:09.900 --> 07:23:12.180
where member Fatah left off last year

07:23:12.180 --> 07:23:15.220
by working alongside the California Association

07:23:15.220 --> 07:23:16.980
of Student Councils on following up

07:23:16.980 --> 07:23:20.140
on some of the presentations that we heard

07:23:20.140 --> 07:23:23.060
at our last meeting from the students

07:23:23.060 --> 07:23:25.980
at the Student Advisory Board on Education.

07:23:25.980 --> 07:23:28.580
And then finally, I've been hearing

07:23:28.580 --> 07:23:31.740
many students' perspectives on the 2022 revision

07:23:31.740 --> 07:23:33.740
of the mathematics framework.

07:23:33.780 --> 07:23:35.900
And actually tomorrow night,

07:23:35.900 --> 07:23:38.580
I'm gonna be attending a discussion hosted

07:23:38.580 --> 07:23:41.380
by the California Student Board Member Association

07:23:41.380 --> 07:23:43.620
where I'm gonna hear plenty of student voice,

07:23:43.620 --> 07:23:45.740
I'm sure, on this issue.

07:23:45.740 --> 07:23:48.460
I know that students definitely have strong opinions

07:23:48.460 --> 07:23:50.380
from what I've heard thus far.

07:23:50.380 --> 07:23:53.140
And so I'm definitely looking forward to that.

07:23:53.140 --> 07:23:56.260
And that concludes my liaison report.

07:23:56.260 --> 07:23:57.580
Thank you.

07:23:57.580 --> 07:24:00.780
I'm gonna add one comment for mine

07:24:00.780 --> 07:24:02.940
and I wanna give Ting the last word.

07:24:04.340 --> 07:24:06.140
So we'll end on that note

07:24:06.140 --> 07:24:07.940
before we open up to public comment

07:24:07.940 --> 07:24:10.420
for anyone who wants to also share

07:24:11.860 --> 07:24:14.820
departing thoughts for our board members.

07:24:14.820 --> 07:24:17.300
But just to piggyback on the point

07:24:17.300 --> 07:24:20.580
that Eileen made earlier about the work

07:24:20.580 --> 07:24:23.940
that is going on with the National Association

07:24:23.940 --> 07:24:25.140
of State Boards of Education

07:24:25.140 --> 07:24:28.420
and the conversation we had with Dr. Cordona

07:24:28.420 --> 07:24:30.740
from the US Department of Education.

07:24:30.740 --> 07:24:33.300
I just wanna note that a lot of that conversation

07:24:33.820 --> 07:24:36.820
was about looking ahead to the next stages

07:24:36.820 --> 07:24:39.020
in assessment and accountability

07:24:39.020 --> 07:24:41.260
and what will most support students,

07:24:41.260 --> 07:24:43.100
what will most support educators

07:24:43.100 --> 07:24:45.500
in being able to support student learning,

07:24:45.500 --> 07:24:48.460
what will bring opportunity to learn,

07:24:49.900 --> 07:24:53.380
indicators to the force so that we're paying attention

07:24:53.380 --> 07:24:55.620
not only to what students can do,

07:24:55.620 --> 07:24:58.380
but what the opportunities they've had to learn.

07:24:58.380 --> 07:25:03.020
So I just wanna flag that that is a next turn of the page

07:25:03.620 --> 07:25:05.220
that has been flagged for us

07:25:05.220 --> 07:25:08.020
from the Federal Department of Education

07:25:08.020 --> 07:25:09.300
in the course of his comments

07:25:09.300 --> 07:25:13.140
and I've heard Dr. Cordona say this several times before.

07:25:13.140 --> 07:25:15.020
He said, look, assessments ought to be,

07:25:15.020 --> 07:25:16.820
students should even know when they're being assessed.

07:25:16.820 --> 07:25:19.820
They should be engaged in wonderful inquiries and projects

07:25:19.820 --> 07:25:22.020
and we should be able to take data from that

07:25:22.020 --> 07:25:23.740
that helps us guide our teaching and learning.

07:25:23.740 --> 07:25:28.580
So he has a very progressive vision in mind.

07:25:28.580 --> 07:25:32.500
There is a new FAQ out from the department

07:25:32.580 --> 07:25:34.900
inviting states to think about

07:25:34.900 --> 07:25:37.780
how they may want to continue to evolve

07:25:37.780 --> 07:25:40.540
their systems of reporting and accountability

07:25:40.540 --> 07:25:44.420
to take more account of what students experience

07:25:44.420 --> 07:25:46.100
in terms of the climate of their schools,

07:25:46.100 --> 07:25:49.220
in terms of the opportunities for learning.

07:25:49.220 --> 07:25:52.540
And so we will be tapping the wisdom

07:25:52.540 --> 07:25:54.260
of all of our departing board members

07:25:54.260 --> 07:25:58.380
as we undertake our part in thinking about those things

07:25:58.380 --> 07:26:02.420
and resting on the wisdom of our current board members

07:26:03.340 --> 07:26:04.580
to take those next steps.

07:26:04.580 --> 07:26:06.980
And with that, I'm gonna pass the ball to Ting.

07:26:06.980 --> 07:26:10.140
I wanted to say that before you spoke and left

07:26:10.140 --> 07:26:12.220
because Ting, you and I've shared so much

07:26:12.220 --> 07:26:14.820
around this assessment adventure

07:26:14.820 --> 07:26:17.460
and I've relied so much on your thinking

07:26:17.460 --> 07:26:19.500
and your wisdom in that regard.

07:26:19.500 --> 07:26:20.900
So to you.

07:26:20.900 --> 07:26:22.340
Thank you so much.

07:26:24.020 --> 07:26:25.980
So I'm a little bit overwhelmed with emotion

07:26:25.980 --> 07:26:29.620
and I don't have words when that happens to me.

07:26:30.100 --> 07:26:34.300
I wanted to say simply, it has been such a deep honor

07:26:34.300 --> 07:26:37.140
to be a part of this board of education.

07:26:37.140 --> 07:26:41.580
And then I just have five things I wanna leave as wishes

07:26:41.580 --> 07:26:46.420
for those of you who are around the virtual DAs right now

07:26:46.420 --> 07:26:49.220
and who will be continuing because I'm realizing

07:26:49.220 --> 07:26:52.620
that you have not had this kind of experience,

07:26:52.620 --> 07:26:53.980
these experiences.

07:26:53.980 --> 07:26:57.100
So what I wish for you is that you one day

07:26:57.100 --> 07:27:01.820
will have the rush of digging for the right change

07:27:01.820 --> 07:27:05.060
to order your lunch before 10 o'clock.

07:27:05.060 --> 07:27:10.060
So that we can get lunch in time.

07:27:10.460 --> 07:27:15.460
I wish for you that you will experience the fun one day

07:27:19.820 --> 07:27:23.100
of sneaking to the back of the boardroom

07:27:23.100 --> 07:27:25.380
and finding all of the snacks

07:27:25.380 --> 07:27:28.340
that the state board staff has left for you.

07:27:28.340 --> 07:27:30.180
And sometimes they're healthy too.

07:27:31.500 --> 07:27:34.460
But mostly the chocolates are great and the cookies

07:27:34.460 --> 07:27:35.540
and the potato chips.

07:27:37.060 --> 07:27:40.380
What I also wish for you is that you will experience

07:27:40.380 --> 07:27:44.820
the surprise of finding out that you actually have a box,

07:27:44.820 --> 07:27:47.740
a mailbox in the state board office

07:27:47.740 --> 07:27:49.660
and rushing over to it to find

07:27:49.660 --> 07:27:53.420
that it is overflowing with stuff,

07:27:53.420 --> 07:27:56.820
cleaning it out, forgetting that you had a box

07:27:56.820 --> 07:28:01.220
two months later, going back and finding it overfilled again.

07:28:03.300 --> 07:28:07.220
I hope that you someday will experience the joy

07:28:07.220 --> 07:28:09.500
of having a group photo together.

07:28:11.380 --> 07:28:16.380
And this last one, I don't wish it would happen to you

07:28:17.460 --> 07:28:22.460
but to experience the overwhelming appreciation

07:28:24.420 --> 07:28:28.300
and gratitude when three of your colleagues

07:28:28.300 --> 07:28:31.780
jumped to your defense when you're personally attacked

07:28:32.660 --> 07:28:34.580
through a public comment.

07:28:34.580 --> 07:28:38.460
And I will never forget having that experience

07:28:38.460 --> 07:28:41.420
and having my colleagues have my back.

07:28:41.420 --> 07:28:46.420
And that has been one of the most memorable experiences

07:28:46.780 --> 07:28:48.900
I've had on the State Board of Education

07:28:49.900 --> 07:28:52.060
because I think we work together

07:28:52.220 --> 07:28:57.220
and we do respect each other even if we don't agree.

07:28:57.220 --> 07:28:59.780
And the bond that is formed through that

07:29:00.980 --> 07:29:05.500
is something that I will always take with me.

07:29:05.500 --> 07:29:06.340
Thank you.

07:29:07.220 --> 07:29:08.060
That's wonderful.

07:29:10.180 --> 07:29:12.180
What a day, what a day, what a day.

07:29:13.460 --> 07:29:16.380
We are gonna put the public comment card up again

07:29:16.380 --> 07:29:19.260
and we're wanting public comments

07:29:20.100 --> 07:29:23.620
that are to be shared with our departing board members

07:29:23.620 --> 07:29:25.860
if there are any at this juncture

07:29:25.860 --> 07:29:30.860
before we then separately go to general public comment.

07:29:30.900 --> 07:29:34.340
So members of the public wishing to provide comment

07:29:35.300 --> 07:29:39.300
on appreciations for our departing board members

07:29:39.300 --> 07:29:41.580
may do so by calling the number shown

07:29:41.580 --> 07:29:43.020
on the public comment slide

07:29:43.900 --> 07:29:46.460
and using the access code that is there.

07:29:46.460 --> 07:29:47.900
Are there any public comments?

07:29:50.100 --> 07:29:54.700
Good evening, State Board of Education members.

07:29:54.700 --> 07:29:56.860
My name is Michael Juba and I'm a classroom teacher

07:29:56.860 --> 07:29:59.740
speaking on behalf of the California Teachers Association.

07:30:00.660 --> 07:30:03.020
It is with my pleasure that the CTA would like

07:30:03.020 --> 07:30:05.060
to express our thanks and gratitude

07:30:05.060 --> 07:30:08.300
to the State Board members, Sue Burr, Patricia Rucker,

07:30:08.300 --> 07:30:10.500
Ting Sung, and Eileen Strauss.

07:30:11.780 --> 07:30:13.700
To say the least, the state is losing decades

07:30:13.700 --> 07:30:15.460
of school policy expertise

07:30:15.460 --> 07:30:18.300
and the historical context and perspective

07:30:18.300 --> 07:30:19.980
that represents.

07:30:19.980 --> 07:30:23.020
We are grateful for the dedication and wisdom

07:30:23.020 --> 07:30:25.180
that each of you have brought to this institution

07:30:25.180 --> 07:30:28.940
for the students and for the educators of our states.

07:30:28.940 --> 07:30:31.540
And on behalf of the 310,000 members,

07:30:31.540 --> 07:30:33.620
we sincerely thank you for your service.

07:30:37.260 --> 07:30:38.580
Thank you.

07:30:38.580 --> 07:30:39.420
Thank you.

07:30:41.020 --> 07:30:43.700
Next caller, please state your name

07:30:43.700 --> 07:30:45.460
and affiliation for the record.

07:30:46.460 --> 07:30:47.620
You have one minute.

07:30:47.620 --> 07:30:48.780
Your time starts now.

07:30:50.700 --> 07:30:52.500
Is this for board members departing?

07:30:52.500 --> 07:30:53.340
Yes, it is.

07:30:54.580 --> 07:30:55.420
Sorry.

07:30:57.820 --> 07:31:02.220
Okay, it looks like that is all for public comment.

07:31:03.580 --> 07:31:04.420
All right.

07:31:05.940 --> 07:31:09.780
Well, we all look forward to the next chapter

07:31:09.780 --> 07:31:11.540
and to continuing to be in touch with you

07:31:11.540 --> 07:31:14.700
and I appreciate Ting all of your wishes for us.

07:31:15.580 --> 07:31:18.220
I wish those things to the,

07:31:18.220 --> 07:31:19.860
especially the dark chocolates.

07:31:22.300 --> 07:31:26.260
We're now gonna reopen for general public comment.

07:31:27.700 --> 07:31:28.660
Before we do that, though,

07:31:28.660 --> 07:31:32.020
I wanna let you know that in your inboxes now,

07:31:32.020 --> 07:31:35.980
Ting, Sue, Patricia, and Eileen,

07:31:35.980 --> 07:31:38.380
there should be e-cards from us

07:31:38.380 --> 07:31:41.420
and from many, many other people in the universe.

07:31:41.420 --> 07:31:44.460
I do not open them yet because we have one more item,

07:31:44.460 --> 07:31:46.460
but as soon as we hang up the phone

07:31:46.460 --> 07:31:48.580
and close up the Zoom,

07:31:48.580 --> 07:31:51.780
you will find your last gift for the day

07:31:51.780 --> 07:31:53.220
and when we're able to be in person,

07:31:53.220 --> 07:31:57.260
we will have that get together and do this all again.

07:31:57.260 --> 07:32:01.220
So now our last general public comment slide,

07:32:01.220 --> 07:32:04.140
if there are any callers for general public comment

07:32:04.140 --> 07:32:06.420
on items that have not been taken up

07:32:06.420 --> 07:32:08.420
in the printed agenda today,

07:32:08.420 --> 07:32:11.940
we will open the phone line for those callers.

07:32:12.940 --> 07:32:14.780
Okay, I think we may have one caller here

07:32:14.780 --> 07:32:18.180
that would have liked to speak towards the last item.

07:32:18.180 --> 07:32:20.340
I will open the phone line now.

07:32:20.340 --> 07:32:21.180
All right.

07:32:22.460 --> 07:32:24.180
Go ahead, caller.

07:32:24.180 --> 07:32:26.780
Please state your name and affiliation for the record.

07:32:28.180 --> 07:32:29.020
Thank you.

07:32:29.020 --> 07:32:30.340
This is Lee Angela Reed on behalf

07:32:30.340 --> 07:32:33.140
of the Small School Districts Association,

07:32:33.140 --> 07:32:34.300
numerous county offices,

07:32:34.300 --> 07:32:37.140
and on behalf of all of us at Capital Advisors.

07:32:37.140 --> 07:32:38.460
I appreciate the indulgence.

07:32:38.700 --> 07:32:41.300
I'd like to thank members first,

07:32:41.300 --> 07:32:43.980
Dr. Strauss and Son for your vision,

07:32:43.980 --> 07:32:46.860
your strength, your leadership, and your friendship.

07:32:47.780 --> 07:32:49.940
You made our accountability system better

07:32:49.940 --> 07:32:53.260
and you made us better as advocates,

07:32:53.260 --> 07:32:55.260
as education partners,

07:32:55.260 --> 07:32:57.300
and you've inspired us along the way.

07:32:57.300 --> 07:32:59.300
Thank you and we wish you the very best.

07:33:00.620 --> 07:33:01.460
Thank you.

07:33:05.900 --> 07:33:07.380
Next caller, please state your name

07:33:07.380 --> 07:33:08.660
and affiliation for the record.

07:33:08.660 --> 07:33:09.500
Do you have one minute?

07:33:09.500 --> 07:33:10.540
Your time starts now.

07:33:13.940 --> 07:33:15.140
Good evening.

07:33:15.140 --> 07:33:18.980
I'm with the Special Education Advocate Leaders,

07:33:18.980 --> 07:33:22.780
a community group of special education attorneys,

07:33:22.780 --> 07:33:27.780
advocates, and parents with over 1,100 members.

07:33:27.980 --> 07:33:30.900
We are asking the California Department of Education

07:33:30.900 --> 07:33:34.100
to investigate how special education dollars

07:33:34.100 --> 07:33:37.820
are being misused by the West End SELPA.

07:33:37.820 --> 07:33:42.820
We SELPA has spent almost $3 million in one year

07:33:43.260 --> 07:33:45.780
for for-profit litigators

07:33:45.780 --> 07:33:49.460
to deny children's special education services.

07:33:49.460 --> 07:33:53.460
In most cases, the cost of the lawyers is much more

07:33:53.460 --> 07:33:55.540
than the parent request.

07:33:55.540 --> 07:33:59.500
These attorneys are being enabled by the We SELPA

07:33:59.500 --> 07:34:03.620
because they're allocating money to private corporations

07:34:03.700 --> 07:34:05.620
rather than our children.

07:34:05.620 --> 07:34:08.180
Please help us correct this injustice.

07:34:08.180 --> 07:34:09.860
Thank you for your time.

07:34:09.860 --> 07:34:10.700
Thank you.

07:34:13.300 --> 07:34:14.700
Next caller, please state your name

07:34:14.700 --> 07:34:15.980
and affiliation for the record.

07:34:15.980 --> 07:34:16.820
Do you have one minute?

07:34:16.820 --> 07:34:17.980
Your time starts now.

07:34:23.900 --> 07:34:26.140
Good afternoon, State Board of Education.

07:34:26.140 --> 07:34:28.220
I am a special education parent.

07:34:28.220 --> 07:34:30.740
I wanted to thank Ms. Kelamese

07:34:30.740 --> 07:34:33.500
for offering the Compliance Complaint Unit

07:34:34.380 --> 07:34:35.820
as a resource, but sadly,

07:34:35.820 --> 07:34:38.620
that unit is not very parent-friendly

07:34:38.620 --> 07:34:43.620
and for the most part signs the district's compliance.

07:34:45.220 --> 07:34:47.980
It also is very difficult to get public records

07:34:47.980 --> 07:34:49.940
from the CDE, which is a violation

07:34:49.940 --> 07:34:51.780
of the Public Records Act.

07:34:51.780 --> 07:34:54.900
I recently saw on a social media report

07:34:54.900 --> 07:34:57.260
on the bias and non-compliance

07:34:57.260 --> 07:35:00.420
of the Office of Administrative Hearing.

07:35:00.420 --> 07:35:03.340
CDE has an agreement with OAH

07:35:03.340 --> 07:35:05.540
to conduct special education hearings.

07:35:05.540 --> 07:35:07.420
The system is broken on many levels

07:35:07.420 --> 07:35:09.940
as evidenced by the report we heard today

07:35:09.940 --> 07:35:11.900
on the many areas that California

07:35:11.900 --> 07:35:14.540
has not met federal targets.

07:35:14.540 --> 07:35:17.940
We would welcome a meeting with Ms. Kelamese

07:35:17.940 --> 07:35:20.500
to discuss our concerns further.

07:35:20.500 --> 07:35:23.700
Your assistance and guidance is very much appreciated

07:35:23.700 --> 07:35:25.340
and thank you for your time.

07:35:25.340 --> 07:35:26.180
Thank you.

07:35:27.260 --> 07:35:28.620
Next caller, please state your name

07:35:28.620 --> 07:35:29.900
and affiliation for the record.

07:35:29.900 --> 07:35:31.980
You have one minute, your time starts now.

07:35:34.740 --> 07:35:36.460
Greetings board members and staff.

07:35:36.460 --> 07:35:39.020
My name is David Page and I'm speaking on behalf

07:35:39.020 --> 07:35:40.820
of parents and community members

07:35:40.820 --> 07:35:43.820
of San Diego Unified's Lincoln High School

07:35:43.820 --> 07:35:46.500
who deserve investigation of their valid complaint

07:35:46.500 --> 07:35:49.980
accepted by the CDE's UCP division.

07:35:49.980 --> 07:35:52.180
We deserve an explanation for the lack of action,

07:35:52.180 --> 07:35:54.420
delay, and response from CDE's

07:35:54.420 --> 07:35:56.460
well-passed regulatory requirements.

07:35:56.460 --> 07:35:59.180
We're requesting an agenda item for the next board meeting

07:35:59.180 --> 07:36:00.820
as part of your oversight requirements

07:36:00.820 --> 07:36:03.300
that would report caseload,

07:36:03.300 --> 07:36:06.340
number of unresolved cases over 60 days

07:36:06.340 --> 07:36:08.900
and the reason for exceeding the 60 day requirement

07:36:08.900 --> 07:36:10.500
the specifics that indicate the flaws

07:36:10.500 --> 07:36:11.940
or needs of the department

07:36:11.940 --> 07:36:13.420
whose function is to bring resolution

07:36:13.420 --> 07:36:14.940
between parents and districts

07:36:14.940 --> 07:36:17.820
as required by federal state and local law.

07:36:17.820 --> 07:36:19.540
Parents and stakeholders of this state

07:36:19.540 --> 07:36:21.540
deserve at minimum a quarterly report

07:36:21.540 --> 07:36:24.820
of status of complaints in the UCP office care.

07:36:24.820 --> 07:36:27.180
Complaints such as ours involve violations

07:36:27.180 --> 07:36:29.100
of parent involvement, legal assurances,

07:36:30.020 --> 07:36:30.860
and falsified documents.

07:36:30.860 --> 07:36:32.740
If these issues are allowed to go unresolved,

07:36:32.740 --> 07:36:35.700
we've cheapened the parent involvement in the district.

07:36:35.700 --> 07:36:38.260
Thank you, Collie, your time is up.

07:36:38.260 --> 07:36:40.140
For the purpose of your existence, thank you.

07:36:40.140 --> 07:36:41.780
Thank you.

07:36:41.780 --> 07:36:44.140
And we have one more written public comment

07:36:44.140 --> 07:36:45.340
that was submitted as part of

07:36:45.340 --> 07:36:47.780
a reasonable accommodation request.

07:36:47.780 --> 07:36:49.060
I will read that now.

07:36:50.700 --> 07:36:53.660
Quote, the SBE needs to direct the CDE

07:36:53.660 --> 07:36:55.420
to be tougher on repeat offenders

07:36:55.420 --> 07:36:57.860
such as the Irvine Unified School District.

07:36:57.900 --> 07:37:00.660
IUSD has been found out of compliance

07:37:00.660 --> 07:37:04.140
and has failed to follow CDE-ordered corrective actions.

07:37:04.140 --> 07:37:06.300
The CDE must not let districts get away

07:37:06.300 --> 07:37:08.500
with this blatant disregard for the law

07:37:08.500 --> 07:37:11.300
and disregard for the CDE oversight.

07:37:11.300 --> 07:37:13.420
Irvine Unified also intimidates parents

07:37:13.420 --> 07:37:16.020
by bringing attorneys to IEP meetings,

07:37:16.020 --> 07:37:17.180
which is against guidance

07:37:17.180 --> 07:37:19.500
by the U.S. Department of Education.

07:37:19.500 --> 07:37:21.900
Please ensure that Irvine Unified

07:37:21.900 --> 07:37:23.860
follows all corrective actions

07:37:23.860 --> 07:37:26.780
and that it stops intimidating parents, end quote.

07:37:26.780 --> 07:37:30.300
And that concludes general public comment for item 13.

07:37:32.740 --> 07:37:33.900
Well, thank you very much.

07:37:33.900 --> 07:37:35.980
And thanks to all the board members

07:37:35.980 --> 07:37:40.980
for both a historic day and a very intense day.

07:37:42.900 --> 07:37:44.580
We've gotten a lot of good work done.

07:37:44.580 --> 07:37:49.580
We once again wanna bid a very bittersweet farewell

07:37:50.420 --> 07:37:52.420
to our departing members

07:37:52.420 --> 07:37:54.620
and look forward to all the ways

07:37:54.620 --> 07:37:56.380
in which we will continue to engage you

07:37:56.980 --> 07:38:01.020
in the work I took Governor Brown's admonition

07:38:01.020 --> 07:38:03.980
very seriously about how we take advantage

07:38:03.980 --> 07:38:07.540
of all the experience that is represented here.

07:38:07.540 --> 07:38:11.380
This is now the end of our January, 2022 meeting

07:38:11.380 --> 07:38:15.340
and I adjourn it at 5.53 p.m.

07:38:15.340 --> 07:38:16.180
Take care.

07:38:19.900 --> 07:38:20.860
Thanks everybody.
